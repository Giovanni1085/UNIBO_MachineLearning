In presenting Modern London to the notice of the reader, the publishers feel that they have no apology to offer for its appearance in the field of literature to which it more particularly appertains. The scope of such a work is, obviously, of an extended character, its fulfilment representing a lengthened period of faithful labour, and involving the outlay of considerable capital ; and, in view of the object with which the following pages have been prepared \u2014 that of portraying with all possible clearness the prominent phases of London's metropolitan and com mercial greatness \u2014 it is confidently believed that any discrepancy of data which may exist will be overlooked after proper consideration has been given to the nature and requirements of the undertaking. Both the historical and editorial portions of the work will be found authentic and interesting, and though of necessity brief, present, as they are designed to do, a review of the salient features of the great metropolis itself, and of the growth and development of leading London industries, in a manner and form that, it is believed, cannot fail to meet with the approval of all. The sketches of mercantile houses, firms, and companies, are submitted to the attention of the reader, each depicting facts connected therewith calculated to better acquaint the business man with his fellows in commerce, and more fully familiarise the buyer with the seller. The facts embodied in these articles have been secured after no inconsiderable labour on the part of the publishers, editors, and reporters; and, while justly laudatory, have been compiled with due regard to accuracy, and the correct interpretation of the information received. As a carefully prepared review of the wealth and status of notable business men, and of the growth of a wide variety of commercial interests \u2014 an historical, statistical, and biographical epitome of mercantile and municipal results achieved in the world's metropolis \u2014 Modern London is, therefore, issued in the confident expectation that it may worthily accomplish the object of its designation, and, at the same time, through the medium of its extensive circulation, prove a source of permanent profit to those represented in its pages."], [12, ""], [13, "INDEX.

THE WORLD'S METROPOLIS :\u2014 ITS HISTORY, GROWTH, AND IMPORTANCE. INDUSTRIES, FACTS, FIGURES, AND ILLUSTRATIONS. great lexicographer saw in the London of his time the epitome, tbe very essence of a nation's wealth, poverty, passion, folly, pleasure. fashion, misery, happiness \u2014 everything, in short, that entered into the composition of the life of the day, and he loved the place for the very power of its comprehensive nature. \"What would he say could he see it to-day ? To what a degree would the sterling old scholar's convictions bo intensified could he take his place in a carriage on the Underground Railway, or ride on the roof of an omnibus and from that vantage point gaze at the transformations a century has effected in the streets once so dear to his heart and familiar to his eyes, or exchange the rude jolting of the ancient coach over the cobble-stones for the swift rush of the hansom, that \" gondola of the streets,\" over the hard smooth asphalte roadway ! THEEE is, or was, an old and somewhat egotistical Spanish dictum, to the effect that whosoever had not seen Seville had not seen a marvel ; and one cannot help thinking that, were the Londoner of the present day as prone to the gratuitous idolising of persons and places as were the Spaniards of old, an English adapt ation of the saying we refer to might, with excellent show of justice and appropriateness, be applied to that mighty \" province covered with houses \" which is at present the recognised capital, social, commercial, and political, of the British Empire. For, of a certainty, nineteenth-century London is, and bids fair to continue for all time, a very marvel of marvels among the cities of the world. Despite the detractions of many a carping tongue, despite even the absolute and existing drawbacks, disadvantages, faults \u2014 call them what we may \u2014 of the famous town, London stands forth to-day as great a wonder to the eyes of thinking men as ever was proud, haughty Seville, with its tiers of battlemented turrets, to the old Castilian mind ; as worthy of a place among the existent marvels of the earth as ever were the Egyptian Pyramids or the Colossus of Rhodes ; a potent modern representative and remem brancer of as great works as ever men accomplished in the days before the glory had all departed from ancient Bome, or the pride of Assyrian Babylon been trampled in the dust. And we may look again and find one of the most graceful verse writers of his day tuning the delicate lyre of his fancy to sing the praises of \" modern Babylon,\" concerning whose attractions clever Captain Morris has revealed an abstract of his thoughts in the dainty lines \u2014 \" Oh, in town let me live, then, in town let me die. For in truth T can't relish the country, not I ; If one must have a villa in summer to dwell, Oh, give me the sweet shady side of Pall Mall London as it is to-day, with its mountains of brick and mortar, iron and stone, its miles upon miles of crowded streets teeming with busy life, and its millions of human souls, all intent in some degree upon the one great struggle for existence, cannot fail to command, as did the London of a hundred years ago, the admira tion and praise of even the most stoical and matter-of-fact among men. We have many instances of this, both past and' present. Every one knows, or has heard, of the singularly deep and whole souled affection entertained by the learned Dr. Johnson for the great city of his adoption ; and there are few but will recall to memory some one of his many earnest speeches, all tending in the same direction, and almost worded to the same effect, to wit, that the citizen of London was practically the citizen of the civilised world, for in London could be found everything material that man could desire to possess, hope to attain, or wish to avoid. The And thus do extremes meet. Here are two men, representative Londoners, but cast in as widely different moulds as the workshop of Nature possesses, uniting, each in his own peculiar fashion, to speak well and pleasantly of \"famous London town.\" Surely there is little need to search for more in the vast field of expressed opinion that lies between these two significant points. Space here forbids that we should do more than cast a rapid glance over the wondrous old city, with, a history coeval with the dawn of the Christian era, and memories of Celts and Bomans. Saxons, Danes, and Norman knights ; and but slight reference can be made to the stern rivalry and deadly feuds among the early occupiers of the soil, in whose eventual union and ultimate recon ciliat: on lay the establishment of that sturdy and united British race, possessors of an indomitable energy that has made itself felt B"], [18, "MODERN LONDON. 34 and bristled with turrets. It began at the spot where the Tower of London now stands, and following a course indicated by the thoroughfares called the Minories, Houndsditch, and London Wall, to Aldersgate and Ludgate, skirted the Thames from the last named locality to its starting point. Till the last century some portions of it remained, but now there are no traces of it save two or three fragments in London Wall and at Ludgate Hill. Eoman London, from the Tower to Ludgate was about a mile in length, and from the Thames to London Wall half a mile in breadth. Its remains at Cheapside and the Mansion House are found at about eighteen feet below the present surface. The Koman city as at first enclosed must, however, have been smaller, as Koman sepulchres have been found in Moorgate Street, Bishopsgate, and Smithfield, which must then have lain beyond the walled city. The Romans reared fine buildings, extended their power, and brought the civilisation of the world to London ; but when they retired, after nearly five hundred years' occupation, they appear to have left behind them no adequate impression upon the people. When William the Conqueror came, he brought the arts and sciences which the Normans had acquired in Southern Europe. He inaugurated improvements and new ideas, which were produc tive of much good. He granted a charter to the Corporation of the City of London, which secured and enlarged old privileges, after wards strengthened by the Great Charter. In 1560 London com prised about 150,000 inhabitants, and in 1661 Graunt estimated the population at 384,000 ; but in this calculation the inhabitants of the outlying districts were in all probability included. The steady and substantial growth of London, however, began from the epoch of George I. A spirit of enterprise animated all things \u2014 the sur rounding villages were absorbed, the roads developed into paved streets, the fields became covered with dwellings and shops, and a progressive system of municipal government prevailed. The first official census of the City was taken in 1801. The total population of the metropolis, including the city of Westminster, the borough of Southwark, and neighbouring places, was 865,850. The population had increased by more than a million during the next forty years. In 1851 the census returns showed 2,361,650 inhabit ants; in 1861, 2,803,035; in 1871,3,266,989; and 1881, 3,832,450. It will thus be seen that every decade increases the population by about half a million. It can be safely said that the population of London to-day is 4,500,000. It would be difficult to say where London begins or ends. Even the administrative divisions are not in agreement with each other. Originally the municipality of the City exercised jurisdiction over London proper, but the town has so outgrown its original limits that the Corporation is now sur rounded by rivals of more or less powers. Separated into two unequal parts by the Thames, which traverses it from west to east, describ ing many extensive curves, London is situated in four counties, which are on the north Middlesex and Essex, on the south Surrey and Kent. What was the exact origin of the London Corporation it is difficult to say, but it is an ascertained fact that there was a \" Erithguild\" in existence in the time of Athelstan. Like all other guilds, this was probably in the first instance a religious confra ternity. During the Saxon period London was governed by the Bishop and a powerful magistrate called the \" Portreve,\" who may certainly be regarded as the prototype of the Lord Mayor. The remarkable charter granted by William the Conqueror to the City of London commences with the words, \" William the King greets William the Bishop and Godfrey the Portreve.\" The struggle for freedom which the City of London and its municipality\u00b0upheld against the encroachments of the Norman kings is detailed by many historians. This struggle was the foundation of much of that liberty and freedom from oppression which has been the great wherever the foot of civilised man has penetrated, and of an un dying perseverance and commercial aptitude that have built up and given to the world of to-day that stupendous monument to the prowess of man, the mighty city whose ancient name appears as the title of this slender sketch. We have with us to-day the same Westminster Abbey whose time-stained walls saw the union of the Eed and White Roses, listened to the social and religious crash of the Reformation, and echoed to the clanking tread and fiery strife of Cavalier and Roundhead ; the old grey fortress that stands now on the slopes of Tower Hill is the same that gazed out through its mullioned windows across the flowing river for centuries before propeller or paddle-wheel stirred up the mud of the tidal stream, or the screech of the locomotive or the \" puff\" of the panting tug proclaimed a revolution in the conduct of the world's commerce. We have cause to be proud of all such links as these, so ciosely connecting the present with the past ; and they help us now, as we look about us, to realise the one grand fact, that through ages of varying fortunes, through all the perils of fire, famine, pestilence, insurrection, and the sword, London has lived, has flourished, and stands to-day where it has stood for centuries, a very monarch among the resident communities of man. The largest, wealthiest, most populous, most cosmopolitan, busiest, and most influential of the cities of the world, it has posted itself on a pinnacle of superiority \u2014 alone, unapproached, and un approachable. And if we let our thoughts imagine for the moment the great centre of universal trade and commerce, the head-quarters of the earth's English-speaking peoples, the Briton's boast abroad, the foreigner's ill-disguised wonder and admiration in the \"land of rain and fog,\" the golden harvest field of shrewd, far-seeing enter prise, the Slough of Despond of the sluggard, the yawning hope less grave of the soul that faints under the ' ' burden and heat of the day,\" the triumphantly exalted pedestal of the conquering genius that knows not defeat, and scorns to falter while as yet the struggle is unfinished, the battle unwon \u2014 we may find for all these a true and full interpretation in the one word London. The history of London is closely allied with the growth and development of the kingdom. There was a city here long before the Romans came, which the ancient Britons knew as Caer Ludd, or the City of Lud. The present name comes from the Latin Londinium, spoken of by Tacitus as \" a city not indeed dignified by the title of a colony, but frequented by a large number of mer chants and by many ships entering its port.\" London in the days of the Britons was probably little more than a collection of huts on a dry spot in the midst of a marsh, or in a cleared space in the midst of a wood and encompassed by an artifi cial earthwork and ditch. That there was much marsh and forest in the immediate vicinity is proved by tbe character of the deep soil when turned up in digging foundations, and by the small sub terranean streams which still run into the Thames, as at Dowgate, at the Fleet Ditch, at Blackfriars Bridge, &c. After the settle ment of the Romans quite early in the Christian era, London rapidly grew in importance. It was the centre of a considerable maritime commerce, the River Thames affording ready access for shipping. It suffered terribly during the sanguinary struggle between the Romans and the British Queen Boadicea, and was in later times frequently attacked and plundered by roving bands of Franks, Norsemen, Picts, Scots, Danes, and Saxons, who crossed the seas to reap a ruthless harvest from a city -which possessed much commercial wealth. As a Roman colony, London was frequently named Augusta, but was not regarded as the capital of Roman Britain. It was the Bomans who built the old city walls and fixed the position of the city gates. This wall was twenty-two feet high,"], [19, "MODERN LONDON. 35 glory of England, for it taught the people the fact. that however exalted was the dignity cf the monarch, and however sacred his person, he was as much bound by the laws as were his subjects, a matter which in former times kings were apt to forget. Amidst such struggles the municipality of London grew up. Henry Fitz Aylwin, the first Mayor of London, is supposed to have been the son of \"Aylwin Child,\" the founder of Bermondsey Abbey, a mau of enormous wealth. Fitz Aylwin was elected Mayor in 1189, and ruled the City in that capacity .until 1212, twenty-five years. During the Civil Wars London, which had been most exposed to the exactions of the Star Chamber, naturally sided with the Roundheads. It witnessed Charles I. beheaded at the palace of Whitehall in 1649, and Oliver Cromwell proclaimed Lord Protector of England in 1653. In 1660 it saw Charles II. placed on the throne by the restoration. It was turned into a city of mourning and lamentaton in 1664 by the ravages and horrors of the Great Plague, in which over 100,000 citizens died. This was closely fol lowed by another terrible calamity \u2014 the Great Fire of September, 1666, which destroyed 13,000 houses, reducing over one-half the City to ashes. In 1703 London was visited by a fearful storm, by which houses were unroofed and overthrown, the ships in the river driven ashore, and property to the value of over \u00a32,000,000 destroyed, and several hundred people killed.

The City is divided into wards, each of which returns a member of the Upper House or Aldermen, and in certain proportions the members of the Common Council or House of Commons. The Lord Mayor during his year of office is the constitutional king of the City. He is elected by the Livery from the members of the Court of Aldermen below the chair. Two aldermen are returned by the Livery for the court to choose which of the two shall be Lord Mayor. On rare occasions an extremely popular Lord Mayor is re-elected for a second term of office, and instances are on record -where a still longer lease of power has been granted. The Lord Mayor exercises high judicial sanctions as chief magistrate of the B 2 The Great Frost of 1739, lasting from Christmas to St. Valen tine's Day, is memorable from the fair which was held on the frozen surface of the Thames. The City suffered severely during the dark days of the Gordon No-Popery Riots of 1780, and witnessed scenes of fanatical barbarism which will never be repeated. During the latter half of the last century London underwent many changes, many of the finest streets and handsomest buildings dating from that time. Among the latter may be mentioned Somerset House, the Bank, Mansion House, and the Horse Guards. The march of improvement during the past fifty years has been so widespread and rapid as to defy description. The City of London has privileges which it has preserved almost mtact since its foundation, and which successive sovereigns have"], [20, "36 MODERN LONDON. City. The City has from time immemorial enjoyed the high privilege of appointing its own judicial functionaries. The Sheriffs of London are also conjointly Sheriff of the County of Middlesex, and are elected by the Livery. The City has its own police, and the Livery possesses many privileges conferred and confirmed by a series of Royal Charters, of which they are properly tenacious. The Corporation has taxing powers within the boun daries of the City, notably in the case of coal and wine dues. It has expended vast sums of money of late years in improvements of great public advantage, such as Holborn Viaduct, the great markets in Smithfield, Billingsgate, Islington, and Deptford, &c, &c. The official residence of the Lord Mayor is the Mansion direction from Charing Cross, embraces an area ot 090 square miles, with streets and roads aggregating 6,600 miles in length. The annual value of house property is estimated at thirty millions sterling. The consumption of food is something enormous, and the following measurement of the food supply for one year is au thenticated by reliable statistics. 75 miles of oxen, 10 abreast ; 120 miles of sheep, 10 abreast ; 19 miles of calves, 10 abreast; 15 miles of pigs, 10 abreast; 75 acres of poultry, close together ; 20 miles of hares and rabbits, 100 abreast ; a pyramid of loaves of bread 600 feet square and three times the height of St. Paul's ; and to finish with, 1,000 columns of hogsheads of beer, each one mile in height.

The cities of London and Westminster, the boroughs of Finsbury, Marylebone, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Chelsea, Greenwich, South wark, and Lambeth, and the adjoining suburban towns, villages, and hamlets, are all embraced in this great metro polis, containing nearly five millions of inhabitants, and constituting the mightiest centre of wealth, commerce, and population in the world. History can show no such city as London. It is un paralleled, and its statistics are all upon such a gigantic scale that if they were related of some remote and foreign place we should stand amazed at the revelation of them. All races are represented in its population. It has within its boundaries more Irish than Cork and Belfast com bined, more Jews than all Palestine, more Scotchmen than Edinburgh, and more Roman Catholics than Rome. Its population is increasing yearly at about the rate of 50,000. It has 45 people to each acre of ground, and as many as 160 to the acre in the more crowded districts. These live in 750,000 houses plied by various water com panies, and upwards of 150,000,000 of gallons are consumed daily. Over 800,000 persons and 75,000 vehicles enter and depart daily the comparatively small area, 632 acres, of the City of Lon don proper. Within a radius of eight miles of Charing Cross 300 miles of railway are in operation. The streets of the metropolis placed end to end would extend to nearly 3,500 miles. The lighting of these is effected: by 18 gas companies, the streets being illuminated by upwards of one million lamps. In all there are about 3,000 miles of gas mains. The amount of capital invested in gas companies is \u00a3 1 2,000,000, and the total annual gas rental amounts to about \u00a33,000,000. There are 7,000' publicans and beer retailers, and 2,000 wine merchants. Food is supplied by 2,500* butchers, 400 pork butchers, 3,000 bakers, 2S0 poultry dealers, S00 fishmongers, 2,100 greengrocers, 3,000 grocers, 1,S00 dairymen^ 1,250 pastrycooks, and 2,500' chandler's shops.

London is the healthiest city in the world, reliable statistics showing that the death-rate is less than 21 per 1000. It has doubled in size within the last half-century, extending now from Stratford and Blackwall on the east to Kew Bridge and Acton on the west, about 14 miles in length, from Clapham and Herne Hill on the south to Hornsey and Highgate on the north, about 8 miles in breadth, covering an area of 122 square miles.

These, with 12,000 cabs, employ 30,000 horses, and giving employment to about 45,000 men. The climate of London is healthy, and the temperature equable, rising but rarely above 90\u00b0. F., nor falling below 30\u00b0 F. The mean annual temperature of the town is 51\u00b0, and of the rural dis tricts surrounding it only 49\u00b0, the difference in favour of the City being accounted for by its sheltered position and by the thousands"], [21, "MODERN LONDON. 37 Travellers', United Service, United University, Whitehall. Parliament and the Ministers \u2014 the official world \u2014 monopo lise the time-honoured city of Westminster, that portion of the metropolis comprised between St. James's Park and the Thames. The City is the recognised financial and com mercial centre of the Empire. For ages its Lombard Street has been synonymous with banks and banking-houses, Mark Lane with the corn trade, Paternoster Row with booksellers, Mincing Lane with the colonial trade, Fleet Street with the printers, and so on through other branches of trade, each one has its own particular locality. The suburbs of London were originally small villages and hamlets that have been swallowed up by the onward march of the metropolitan builder, and they now constitute in tegral portions of the mighty city. The houses vary in size, and afford innumerable comfortable and spacious homes for the great army of clerks and working people who form such an important part in the sum total of London's wealth and productiveness. A perfect system of rapid transit to and from the suburban districts enables the people resident therein to enjoy the blessing of fresh air at a moderate cost. of lamps and fires which raise the temperature artificially. Dense \\\\ lisTMiNSTEit Abbey. fogs are a peculiarity of London, of which the people are anything but proud. Frequently it is so foggy that it is necessary to light the gas in the middle of the day. During the spring and autumn London is as pleasant a place as one could wish to live in. Divisions of the Metropolis. The divisions of London are numerous and in tricate, furnishing a wide field of industrial activity for the map-maker who wishes to keep up with the times. The great social divisions, which even a -casual visitor cannot fail to be struck with, are the East End, the West End, and the City. The East End is that densely-populated portion of London lying to the north and east of the City. The Docks comprise that section of it along the Thames, and hard by are extensive warehouses connected with the shipping and other trades. The \"tobacco manufactories of Whitechapel have given the locality a world-wide reputation ; Spitalfields is noted for its silk-weavers, and Clerkenwell for its watchmakers. The West End embraces everything that consti tutes London's political, social, and financial great ness. Within its limits are to be found the seat of the Legislature, the clubs, the leading places of amusement, the fashionable shops and palatial resi dences. It is the \"Society\" centre, that is, all those people who have a name, a title, or official position areJocated in the neighbourhood of Hydo Park, and can be circumscribed within a mile radius, taking the bridge over the Serpentine as a centre. Beyond this inner circle other concentric zones extend, losing their aristocratic character ac cordingly as they become more distant, just as circles in the water extend and disappear after a stone has been thrown into a pond. The principal clubs of London are located in Pall Mall and vicinity; these are, the Army and Navy, Athen\u00e6um, Carlton, Conservative, East India, United Service, Junior Carlton, Junior United Service, Naval and Military, Oriental, Oxford and Cambridge, Reform, Westminster Abbey.

In all probability it was formerly only half its present length, and it is possible that the lower portion was added when the title of Lord Mayor was granted. An interesting relic exists in the seal of the mayoralty. Ancient documents state that the old seal was small and uncomely, and it was ordained by the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council assembled in the Guildhall in 1381 that it should be broken and a new one made, which was done, \" artificially and honourably for the exercise of the said office, which new seal should contain, besides the images of SS. Peter and Paul, and under the feet of the said images a shield of tho arms of the said City perfectly graved, with two lions supporting The City Scei-tke. During the reign of Edward III. the Mayor of London was first entitled \"Lord,\" and was allowed to have gold and silver maces carried before him. The present City mace dates only from the time of George II., but the curious old \" baton of office \" called the \" City sceptre \" is certainly quite as old as Edward III. 's reign; in fact, portions of this curious object are thought to date from Saxon times. It is composed of crystal mounted with thin bands of gold, and adorned with pearls and precious stones. It appears to possess several dates, the upper half being much earlier than Eoyal Courts of Justice. The Great Hall. Trainbands, consisting of many thousands of disciplined men, well equipped to hold their own upon a battlefield, and who frequently proved their ability to do so. It was they who guarded the Par liament after the attempt of Charles I. to arrest the five members, all of whom took refuge in Coleman Street. It was chiefly by the support upon which he could rely from the City that William Pitt maintained his successful patriotic efforts for the national honour, and his noble but unavailing protests against the policy which led to the American War of Independence. London has worthily filled a foremost position in the annals of the British the same, with two sergeants-at-arms on either part one ; and two tabernacles, in which above should stand two angels, between whom (above the said images of SS. Peter and Paul) should be set the glorious Virgin.\" This being properly executed, the old seal was delivered to Richard Odih n, chamberlain, who broke it, and this seal is still in use, in spite of all the changes that have since taken place.

It has ever been a champion of liberty and progress and a leader in every good work for the suffering populations of the globe. Its people have won a world-wide celebrity for their intel ligence, thrift, and benevolence, and its name is deservedly honoured as the \" metropolis of the world.\" THE TOWER OF LONDON. Probably no building in the world has such an interesting and varied history as the Tower of London, the mere mention of its name recalling the most stirring events of olden times. It is The New Admiralty- and War Oipice. beyond all question the most interesting monument in London. It is situated at the foot of Tower Street, upon a rising ground, and extends for some distance along the Thames. It has been the scene of great events and is an object of remote antiquity. There is little doubt that for many centuries before the Conquest an important structure stood on this site, tradition saying that Julius C\u00e6sar reared the pile. In 1078 William the Conqueror built the White Tower. Henry L Somerset House. View prom the Embankment. and William Rufus erected St. Thomas's Tower over Traitors' Gate. Henry III. largely improved it. Baliol, Bruce, Wallace, and King John of France were impri soned in it by Edward III., and during the Wat Tyler insurrection it was occupied by Richard II. It was in the White Tower that he abdicated his sovereignty in favour of his cousin Bolingbroke. It was here Henry IV. imprisoned Prince James of Scotland and be headed his brother-in-law, the Earl of Huntingdon. Henry V. brought hither his captives from Agincourt and hence sent Lord Cobham to the stake. Henry VI. was murdered in the Tower, the"], [24, "40 MODERN LONDON. Duke of Clarence was the next victim, then Hastings, and then the two infant princes, Richard of York and Edward V. The Tower has witnessed within its walls some of the darkest crimes in English history. Among the celebrated persons imprisoned and beheaded in or near it are Sir Thomas More, Queen Anne Boleyn, Thomas Crom well, Earl of Essex, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, Queen Catharine Howard, Lord Admiral Seymour of Sudeley, Lord Somer set the Protector, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland, Lady Jane Grey and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, Sir Thomas Overbury, poisoned in 1613, Sir John Eliot, died as a prisoner in 1632, James Fitzroy, Duke of Monmouth, and Simon, Lord Fraser of Lovat, beheaded in 1747, Anne Askew, Archbishop Cranmer, Sir Thomas Wyatt, Earl of Southampton, Sir Walter Raleigh, Earl of Stratford, Archbishop Laud, Viscount Stafford, Lord William Russell, Lord Chancellor Jeffreys, &c, &c. Under George I. the Jacobites were confined in the Tower, and were all executed with the exception of Lords Nithsdale and Winton, who effected their escape. The latest occupants of the Tower as state prisoners were Sir Francis Burdett and the gang of ruffians known as the Cato Street conspirators. Successively a royal residence, a fortress, a court of justice, and a prison, the Tower is now an arsenal, a military store depot, a barrack, and for the general public one of the most interesting places in Europe. Visitors enter the Tower by the Lion's Gate, and are conducted by warders clothed in picturesque costume. They wear the doublet and the head-gear of the Yeomen of the Guard at the time of Henry VHI. On gala days the \" Beefeaters,\" as they are called, are clothed in knee-breeches and stockings, and wear shoes with rosettes. Under the guidance of one of tho warders people in turn visit the Traitor's Gate, the Bloody Tower, where the young princes were murdered, the White Tower, which contains an excellent collection of armour, arranged in chronolo gical order and admirably kept, the crown jewels, which are in a circular glass receptacle hard by, St. Peter's Chapel, and the Beauchamp Tower. In addition to these are the Lion Tower, the Middle Tower, the Salt Tower, the Brick Tower, and the Bowyer Tower. Many curiosities were destroyed in 1841 by a fire which broke out in the Armoury, where a great many small arms had been stored, and more recently it suffered slight damage from an explo sion perpetrated by cowardly miscreants. WESTMINSTER ABBEY. What magic in the name, associated as it is with all that is noble, brave, and honoured in British history. The pen cannot possibly do adequate justice to the glories of this grand old pile of buildings, associated as they are with such memorable events in ancient and modern times. Westminster Abbey stands on low ground on the left embankment of the river, near the Houses of Parliament. It dates its origin back to about A.tj. 616, when a church is said to have been built upon the site in honour of St. Peter, by King Sebert. After being demolished by the Danes, it The Albert Memorial and Albert Hall. Henry VII. in his turn demolished Henry III.'s work, and im mortalised himself by erecting a chapel which now stands behind the head of the cross (in the form of which the building is constructed). The interior of the Abbey is at once imposing and inspiring im- was suisequently rebuilt by King Edgar in 985. To Edward the Confessor, however, is due the foundation and completion of West minster Abbey proper, 1050 to 1065. It remained intact for two centuries, when it was entirely rebuilt by Henry I. and Edward I."], [25, "MODERN LONDON, 41 long to be remembered event. It is in every respect England's Walhalla, or Temple of Fame, interment within its walls being considered the greatest honour which the nation can bestow on the most deserving of her sons. Washington Irving has truly said of pressing one with its simple grandeur. Its height and symmetry of proportions, its \"long-drawn aisles\" and vaulted roof, and the fact that within its walls are buried many of England's wisest and noblest people, cannot fail to render a visit to Westminster a Albert Hall. Interior View. Westminster: \"The spaciousness and gloom of this vast edifice produces a profound and mysterious awe. We step cautiously and softly about, as if fearful of disturbing the hallowed silence of the tomb ; while every footfall whispers along the walls and chatters among tbe sepulchres, making us more sensible of the quiet we have interrupted. It seems as if the awful nature of the place presses down upon the soul, and hushes the beholder into noiseless reve rence. We feel that we are surrounded by the congregated bones of the great men of past times, who have filled history with their deeds and the earth with their renown.\" The total length of the church, including the chapel of Henry VIL, is 515 feet, the transept is 200 feet in length and 80 feet in width, the nave and aisles are 75 feet in breadth, the height of the church being 102 feet and of the towers 225 feet. The building is in the form of a Latin cross, the proportions being perfect in every detail. The chapel at the eastern end, which has always been very much admired, is a true example of the Perpendicular style. The other portions of the church, with few exceptions, are Early English. The chapel of Edward the Confessor lies behind the present altar screen, and contains the shrine of that monarch. The remains of Henry III. are believed to rest here, also those of Edward I., Edward III., and Henry V. Behind the sarcophagus of the last named monarch is the chapel erected by Henry VII. as a burial place for himself. It is a fine specimen of florid Gothic architecture. To the left of the chapel is the burial place of Queen Elizabeth, and to the right that of Mary Queen of Scots. Near by are the tomb of the Due de Montpensier, brother of Louis Philippe, King of France, also that of Lady Augusta Stanley, wife of the late Dean of Westminster and the intimate friend of her Majesty the Queen. A spot of world-wide celebrity is the Poets' Corner, which forms the most southern portion of the arm of the cross. Among the illustrious dead buried here are Charles Dickens, Macaulay, Cum berland, Sheridan, Handel, Campbell, David Garrick, Samuel John son, Chaucer, Gray, Milton, and many others. To tbe sightseer there can be nothing more interesting than a tour of the twelve chapels into which the Abbey is divided. These are St. Edmund's, which contains the tombs of William de Valence, Earl of Pem broke; John of Eltham, son of Edward n. ; William of Windsor and Blanche de la Tour, children of Edward III. There is also a fine statue of Lady Elizabeth Russell and Edward Bulwer, Lord Lytton. In addition there are memorial brasses of Eleanor de Rohun, Duchess of Gloucester, Robert de Waldeby, Archbishop of York, and Frances, Duchess of Suffolk, mother of Lady Jane Grey. St. Benedict's Chapel contains the tombs of Langham, Archbishop of Canterbury, the Countess of Hertford, Cranfield, Lord Treasurer to James I. St. Nicholas' Chapel contains the tomb of Katharine of Valois, wife of Henry V., also the tomb of Sir George Villiers. There are besides interesting monuments to Mildred and Anne, wife and daughter of Lord Burghley, and to the wife of Lord Protector Somerset. In St. Paul's Chapel are the tombs of Lord Bourchier, standard-bearer to Henry V., Sir Thomas Bromley, Chancellor during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Giles Daubny, Sir D. Carleton, and Lord Cottington. There is also a colossal statue of James Watt, tbe celebrated engineer.

Bacon's monument to Admiral Kempenfeldt, one to Sir John Franklin, a tablet to Sir Humphry Davy, and a statue of Telford, the engineer. Henry VII.'s Chapel consists of a nave and two aisles. The nave contains tho stalls of tbe Knights of the Bath, who were installed here up to the beginning of the present century. In the centre of the chapel are the tombs of Henry VII. and his queen, Elizabeth. Near by are the tombs of Margaret, mother of Henry VII. ; of the mother of Darnley, husband of Mary Queen of Scots ; of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and his two sons ; of Queen Eliza beth and Queen Mary; James I. and Anne of Denmark, and their two children ; the Queen of Bohemia and Arabella Stuart ; sarco- Chapel is divided from the choir by a shrine containing a well executed frieze representing incidents in the life of Edward the Confessor. It has this monarch's shrine, erected by Henry III., also the tombs of Edward I., Henry III., and Eleanor, queen of Edward I., Henry V., Edward III., his queen and children, Ed ward IV., and Henry VII., of Richard II. and Anne, his first queen. This chapel contains the two coronation chairs used at the coro nation of the sovereign of this kingdom. One of the chairs con tains the famous stone of Scone, believed to have been Jacob's Pillow. In St. John's Chapel are the tombs of many of tho early Abbots, also that of Lord Hudson, cousin of Queen Elizabeth ; William de Colchester ; Thomas Cecil, Earl of Exeter, and his two wives ; and a monument to Colonel Popham.

An imposing monument to General Wolfe, the hero of Quebec, stands near St. John the Baptist's Chapel. King Sebert, Edmund Crouchback, second son of Edward III., and Anne of Cleves, wife of Henry VILT., are interred in the choir. Many of the more modern monu ments are to be found in the north transept, among which the following are well worth seeing : \u2014 Sir Robert Peel, by Gibson ; Lord Palmerston, by Jackson ; Lord Castlereagh, by Thomas ; Woolner's bust of Richard Cobden ; and Bacon's Lord Chatham. Among the celebrities buried here are Pitt, Fox, Chatham, Grat tan, Castlereagh, Colchester, and Wilberforce, Darwin, Dr. Blow, Arnold, and Dr. Burney. An immense number of memorials, &c, fill the nave of the Abbey. Among those buried here are Ben Jonson, Eobert Stephenson, Sir Charles Barry, Colin Campbell, Lord Clyde, Dr. Livingstone, Sir G. Pollock, Lord Lawrence, and George Peabody. The cloisters contain a number of very old monuments, made doubly interesting by their quaint and reverend inscriptions. Near the cloisters is the Chapter House, erected through tho instrumentality of Henry III. in 1250, and restored by Sir Gilbert Scott in 1865. Englishmen have reason to be proud of such a grand old church as Westminster. Erom the Saxon King Harold to our Queen-Empress Victoria, all the sovereigns of England have been crowned here, and within its stately walls many of them sleep their last sleep. Side by side with her kings are many of England's illustrious children ; poets, men of letters, artists, military and naval heroes, statesmen, and in fact all the phases of our nation's manhood, are represented in this Pantheon of the British Empire."], [27, "MODERN LONDON. 43 fire in 1834 the condition of the building was a national disgrace, for the Cloister, together with the Oratory adjoining, were cut up by walls and partitions, and used as kitchens, sculleries, &c. The whole, however, has been restored, as much of the ancient work being preserved as possible. About the centre of the West Walk of tho Cloisters is a double doorway leading into the Oratory, a beautiful little chapel of the same date as the Cloisters. Its stone roof is a perfect masterpiece of fan -tracery. Over this is another chapel, called the Upper Oratory, now attached to the Private Bills Office. The Upper Oratory is less elaborate than the lower one, and is by some writers presumed to have served as the Chapter House to the Dean and Chapter of St. Stephen's Chapel Royal. It THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT. The anciont Palace of Westminster was originally erected by Edward the Confessor, and it formed for more than five hundred years the chief residence of our English kings. It wa3 enlarged and partly reconstructed by many subsequent monarchs, especially William Rufus, Henry IL, Henry III, Edward I., Edward III., Eichard II. , and Henry VIII. Several of the more important apartments of the ancient palace were in existence up to the time of the disastrous fire which occurred on the 16th of October, 1834. The only portions of the ancient palace now existing are West minster Hall, St. Stephen's Cloisters, the Oratory, and the Crypt of St. Stephen's Chapel, now possesses a fiat wooden roof, and is lighted by square- headed windows. Neither of these chapels is at present used. A doorway at the south-west corner of St. Stephen's Cloister leads to- the Crypt of St. Stephen's- Chapel, which is now used as the chapel of the House of Commons. The Great Staircase is one of the most striking architectural fea- tures of the Houses of Parlia- ment. It ascends to an ele- gant vaulted corridor lead- ing to the Lobby of the House of Commons. The Lobby is a noble looking entrance hall, square in plan, with a very solid and richly carved flat wooden roof. Each side is' divided by the shafts supporting the roof into three bays ; that on the north side leads into the House of Commons. The one opposite to it opens into the great corridor of com munication between the Houses of Lords and Com mons, that to the west to the corridor leading to the mem bers' staircase, that to the east to the Tea Room, &c. The Division Lobbies, to gether with the passages connecting them at either used as a chapel for the House of Commons. The New Palace of West- minster, or Houses of Parlia- ment, have been erected since 1840, from the plans of Sir Charles Barry. The new building is in the richest late Gothic or Perpendicular style, and covers an area of eight acres. It contains 11 courts, 102 staircases, and 1,100 apartments, and has cost in all about \u00a33,000,000. The Clock Tower is 318 feet high, the Middle Tower is 300 feet high, and the Vic- toria Tower is 340 feet high. The immense clock has four dials, each 23 feet in dia- meter. The bell of the Clock Tower, popularly known as \" Big Ben,\" is among the largest in the world, weigh- ing over 13 tons. The river front of the edifice is 942 feet in length, and is adorned with statues of English monarchs from William the Conqueror down to Queen Victoria. Westminster Hall is sup posed to have been erected by William Rufus, but as we _now see it the whole building dates from the reign of Richard II. The entrance The Thames Embankment. end, completely surround the House. These lobbies are beauti fully fitted up, the walls are panelled with oak, the ceilings are of the same material, and all the furniture designed in a correspond ing style. A spacious doorway leads from the Public Lobby to the House of Commons. The first impression upon the stranger entering this world-famed chamber is one of disappointment, for although the place is admirably suited to its requirements, and is really fitted up exceedingly handsomely, all the galleries and benches being adorned with oak panels splendidly carved, yet there is an absence of that architectural magnificence which its very striking ap proaches had led the eye to expect. When, however, one has overcome the first disappointment of finding that the House of for the members of Parliament is on the east side, and leads im mediately to the Members' Porch, a heavily-vaulted, solemn looking entrance hall, communicating with the \" Star Chamber \" Courtyard, Westminster Hall, and by a short passage with the Cloisters of St. Stephen's. Passing through this porch and down a short passage, the members arrive at the Cloak Room, formerly the ancient cloisters of St. Stephen's Chapel. This remarkably beautiful structure is one of the few existing por tions of the ancient palace. It was erected in the year 1526, and is one of tho most elaborate examples of tbe very latest style of Gothic architecture. This beautiful cloister was only just com pleted when the collegiate establishment was suppressed, and it was leased out to Sir Richard Fane. Up to* the time of the great"], [28, "44 MODERN LONDON. bench in front of the table to the right of the Speaker is occupied by the members of the Ministry, that on the left by the leaders of \" her Majesty's Opposition.\" The chief of either party sits at the end farthest removed from the Speaker, and upon the table just before him are two boxes bound with clamps of silver, and having a lock, hinges, aud handles of metal very finely wrought and deli cately engraved. These are the \" Oaths Boxes,\" and contain the form of oath proposed to members of Parliament and a copy of the Scriptures. Between these oath boxes are two metal brackets upon which the mace rests. Commons is not a great cathedral or an immense and magnificent vaulted hall, it will be seen that it is really a very handsome and very appropriately adorned apartment. The seats for the members are ranged parallel to the axis of the chamber, like the stalls in a cathedral, and return right and left on either side of the entrance, half way down the \" House.\" The seats are divided by a passage called \" the Gangway,\" and at the end opposite to the entrance is the Speaker's Chair, a richly carved Gothic throne. In front of this is \"the Table of the House,\" which occupies the space between the opposite benches, leaving a narrow passage on either side. The Mansion House. The Egyptian Hall. The mace, or rather maces, for there are several, are all of a similar form, though of different dates. By a kind of parlia mentary fiction, when the mace is on the table the sovereign is supposed to be present, and it is probably for this reason that from the earliest times these curious symbols of office and authority have been made in the conventionalised form of a head wearing a crown. The mace at present used is probably the most ancient, from the initial C.R. being stamped upon it. It must date either from the reign of Charles I. or II. Considered from an art point of view, it is not a remarkable piece of workmanship, the repousse work being coarsely executed and the design not particularly elegant. It is evidently not all of the same date, and the crown looks more modern than the rest. The crowned rose, thistle, and harp are represented in several places, and the fleur-de-lis also occurs more than once. It is just possible that this maybe the identical \" bauble \" which Crom well ordered to be taken away, but if so it is not so delicate as most\" goldsmiths' work of the period, and the delicate arabesque work which forms so marked a feature of the metal work of the earlier part of the seventeenth century is not to be seen. It is, however, an interesting piece of plate, and, like everything in the Houses of Parliament at the present day, is carefully preserved. At the opposite end of the House, and immediately in front of the"], [29, "MODERN LONDON. 45 entrance, are two low wooden posts or pillars terminating a kind of wooden parapet ; two hollow brass rods draw out from these, tele- scope fashion, and form \" the Bar of the House.\" Close to the Bar sits the Sargeant-at-Arms, and the places of the \" very advanced members\" are immediately behind \"the Bar.\" The Members' Galleries are on either side of the House. The Press Reporters' Galleries are over the Speaker's Chair, and the Ladies' Gallery is behind the stone screen. High up, also behind the Speaker's Chair, the gallery over the entrance is for members of the diplomatic body and the general public. Leading from the galleries are very pretty corridors with conversation nooks, to which members who are not taking part in the debate may retire. These are beautifully designed, the walls and ceilings being panelled with \" linen panels \" and scroll work in carved oak. The Reading Rooms and \" Tea Room\" are at the end of the passage leading from the Lobby of the House of Commons. These are handsome apartments, decorated and fitted up in a style thoroughly in keeping with the architecture of the building. At the end of the Tea Room is a bar and serving room, and near by is a spacious Smoking Room. The Central Hall is a large octagonal structure richly adorned with sculpture, the windows fitted with stained glass, the roof en- crusted with mosaic. This hall is 60 feet in diameter. The four great doorways of the Central Hall lead to the most important sub- divisions of the great Houses of Parliament, viz. the House of Lords, House of Commons, Westminster Hall, and the Com- mittee Rooms. St. Stephen's Hall occupies the site of the old House of Commons or St. Stephen's Chapel. It is a graceful apartment, finely vaulted and lit by large perpendicular windows. At the base of each vaulting shaft is a large pedestal bearing a statue in white marble of some distinguished statesman, Hamp- den, Walpole, Pitt, Burke, Fox, &c. The western doorway of St. Stephen's Hall leads to Westminster Hall. It has been pro- posed during recent years to adorn Westminster Hall with frescoes and decorations. It is to be hoped that this will never be done. The sombre and stately quietness of the effect of this hall are a relief to the eye after the richness of the Houses of Parlia- ment, and they both gain immensely by the contrast. Anything which would lessen or destroy this contrast would be an injury to both. In addition to this there is a solemn and sad seriousness about the past history of this hall which ill suits it for decoration. What adornment could be appropriate in such a place except funeral wreaths and crape hangings ? Who when looking at Westminster Hall for a moment recalls the great banquets which have been held beneath its arched roof, and who does not recall to mind the fate of the unhappy king who in the height of his splendour caused this roof to be erected, little thinking that he was building a hall in which a few years after his own deposition would be pronounced, and he himself driven away to be murdered or starved to death ? Who can but remember the great and good Sir Thomas More having here passed upon him that sentence which has covered his judges with infamy and disgraced the Legislature of the land ; or Stratford condemned to death, in presence of his helpless master whom he had served only too zealously ; or that master himself dragged as a criminal before the representatives of his irritated people ; or the ghastly heads of his judges a few years later exhibited to a howling mob in this hall, after their bodies had been torn from their graves in the neighbouring Abbey ; or Warren Hastings brought up year after year for eight long years before a tribunal which still left it doubtful whether he was an unscrupulous and cruel tyrant who had caused the name of England to be hated, or a stern but faithful protector of his country's interests ? The tawdry banquet which, with its sham velvet hangings and gingerbread canopies, was held to commemorate the coronation of George IV. hardly serves to brighten these recollections, for surely \"a dish of herbs\" would have been far preferable to the stalled ox flavoured with such domestic bliss and \" contentment\" as that sovereign must have brought to the feast. And the mind turns away from this festal scene with disgust, and involuntarily changes to the mournful memories of older times. ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL. St. Paul's Cathedral, the grandest architectural triumph of England's greatest architect, and the crowning effort of his life, was begun in 1675. It is the third church dedicated to St. Paul which has been reared upon this site. The first church was built in 610. This building was burned down in 961 and rebuilt within a year. It was again destroyed by fire in 1087, but was soon re erected, and in 1315 was furnished with a timber spire covered with lead, 520 feet high. The spire was injured by lightning in 1445, but was restored and stood until 1561, when it again fell a prey to the flames. Old St. Paul's was damaged by this fire, and fell into a very dilapidated condition. The subterranean portions of tho half-ruined church were for a time used as workshops and wine cellars. In the reign of Charles I. an extensive restoration was undertaken. The Great Fire of 1666 completely destroyed tho church. Old St. Paul's was remarkable for its splendid shrine and magnificent robes, crosses, jewels, and plate, its chapels, altars, and numerous clergy. Henry VIII. , however, swept its wealth into his treasury. Eight years after the fire, the site was cleared for the present St. Paul's, the first stone of which was laid on the 21st of June, 1675, by the Architect and his lodge of Freemasons, tho original trowel and mallet then used being still preserved in the Lodge of Antiquity, of which Sir Christopher Wren was master. The Church was opened for divine service in 1697 and completed in 1710. The entire cathedral was completed under one architect, Sir Christopher Wren ; one master-mason, Mr. T. Strong ; and one bishop, Dr. Compton, at a cost of \u00a3747,954. Wren was paid \u00a3200 per annum for his services. He lived to the good old age of ninety years, and his chief amusement as an old man was to be carried once a year to look at his noble work. His epitaph over the north door is, \"Beneath is buried Christopher Wren, architect of this Church and City, who lived for more than ninety years, not for himself, but for the public good. Beader, if thou seekest his monument, look around.\" \" The reader,\" says Leigh Hunt, \" does look around, and the whole interior of the Cathedral, which is finer than the outside, seems like a magnificent vault over his single body.\" Macaulay has written, \"In architecture, an art which is half a scienco, an art in which none but a geometrician can excel, an art which has no standard of grace but what is directly or indirectly dependent on utility, an art of which tho creations derive a part at least from mere bulk, our country could boast at the time of the Revolution of one truly great man, Sir Christopher Wren ; and the fire which laid London in ruins, destroying 13,000 houses and 89 churches, gave him an opportunity unprecedented in history of displaying his powers. The austere beauty of the Athenian portico, the gloomy sublimity of the Gothic arcade, he was, like most of his contemporaries, in capable of emulating, and perhaps incapable of appreciating, but no man born on our side of the Alps has imitated with so much success the magnificence of the palace churches of Italy. Even the superb Louis XIV. has left to posterity no work which can bear a comparison with St. Paul's.\" The church, which resembles St. Peter's at Rome, though much smaller, is in the form of a Latin Cross, with lateral projections at the west end of the nave. The dimensions of the building are as follow. Length, 550 feet ; width"], [30, "46 MODERN LONDON. the inner dome. The lantern is surmounted by a ball, and on top of all is a cross. The ball can hold fourteen persons. The interior of the church is magnificently proportioned. The nave and choir are each designed with three arches longi tudinally springing from piers strengthened as well as decorated on their inner faces by an entablature whose cornice reigns through out the nave and church. The entrances from the transepts lead into vestibules, each communicating with the centre and its aisles, formed between two massive piers and the walls at the inter sections of the transepts with the choir and nave. The eight piers are joined by arches springing from one to the other so as to form an octagon. The choir contains some of the finest carvings in tho world. The dome is adorned with scenes from tho life of St. Paul. The choir has one of the finest organs in Great Britain. In its construction some of the pipes from the old organ, built in 1694, are used. The celebrated Whispering Gallery is reached from an of nave, 118 feet ; length of transept, 251 feet ; inner dome, 220 feet in height ; outer dome to top of cross, 372 feet. The upper part of the exterior is of the Composite, the lower of the Corinthian order; the surface is Portland stone. On each side of the facade is a campanile tower 222 feet in height, with statues of the four Evan gelists at the angles. The one on the north side contains a fine peal of twelve bells, hung in 1878, and the other contains the largest bell in England, \"Great Paul,\" weighing about 17 tons. At the west end a noble flight of steps ascends to a doubled portico terminated by a pediment, in the tympanum of which is sculptured the Conversion of St. Paul ; on the apex is a colossal figure of St. Paul, and on the right and left St. Peter and St. James. The domes have a gilt pineapple at the apex of each. A drum in two sections, the lower embellished with Corinthian, the upper with Composite columns, bears the finely proportioned double dome. The lantern above it is supported by a hollow cone of brickwork resting upon The British Museum. Library and Reading Room size and excellent workmanship. Its dial plates are 52 feet in cir cumference, and the numerals are two feet high. The minute hands are 9 feet 9 inches long and weigh 750 lbs. each, and the hour hands are 5 feet 10 inches long and weigh 440 lbs. each. The clock runs for eight days with one winding. Among the principal statues in the church are the following : \u2014 Dr. Johnson by Bacon, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lord Nelson by Flaxman, Lord Cornwallis by Rossi, Sir John Moore by Bacon, Lord Howe by Flaxman, Lord Rodney, Captains Morse and Rivers by Rossi, Sir W.

There are monuments also to General Sir W. Napier, General Sir C. J. Napier, and Admiral Sir C. Napier, angle under the dome by 265 easy steps. A low whisper on one side is distinctly hoard on the opposite. Many thousands of volumes and valuable MSS. relating to old St. Paul's are in the Library over the southern aisle. Leading to the Library is the Geometrical Staircase of 110 steps, built by Sir Christopher Wren. His original design for the church can be seen in the Model Room. The Crypt contains the sarcophagus of Wellington. It consists of an immense block of porphyry resting on a granite base. Near by is the tomb of Sir Thomas Picton, who fell at Waterloo. Di rectly under the centre of the dome is the black marble sarco phagus of Nelson, and on the right is that of Nelson's comrade, Admiral Collingwood, while to the left is that of the Earl of North esk. The hearse used at Wellington's funeral, with its trappings, is in a chamber behind Nelson's sarcophagus.

From the time of the Norman Conquest to the present day Lon don has been the capital of England and Wales. Many of tho noblest characters in English history have been residents of the town, and the historical associations of its Royal Palaces at once places them in the foremost rank of the nation's honoured edifices. William the Conqueror built the Tower to serve the dual purpose of fortress and royal residence. From the year 1097 to 1547 West minster Palace was the residence of the kings. St. James's is the oldest palace which is still the abode of royalty ; it is used now on State ceremonials only. Buckingham Palace, in St. James's Park, is used by Her Majesty whenever she visits the city. The Prince of Wales's town residence is Marlborough House. Kensington Palace is also inhabited by members of the Royal Family. Windsor Castle is the usual residence of the Queen. The Court pensioners have the use of the old palace of Hampton Court. Lambeth Palace is the town residence of the Archbishop of Can terbury. Crosby Hall is now a restaurant. HoUand House, Kensington, is full of historical interest.

The Thames Embankment, extending from Westminster to Blackfriars, on the Middlesex side of the Thames, is a solid river wall of stone eight feet in thickness and forty feet in height. To obtain an idea of what the Thames shore was formerly, we have only to stand on any of the bridges between Charing Cross Viaduct and London Bridge and glance at the right bank of the river. There was in former times, on both sides of the Thames, huge ill looking buildings, warehouses, and wharves, built upon piles so as to permit lighters, barges, and steamers to load or unload direct an operation which is now confined to that part of the river above whose interest they were organised. Many of them maintain excellent schools and charities, which are ap preciated by thousands of the Lon don poor. The Companies and tbe location of their offices are as fol lows : \u2014 Cannon Street Station prom the Thames. Elackfriars. About twenty years ago the Board of Works, assisted by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, the eminent engineer, began the erection of the three magnificent Embankments along the river front, and which are known respectively as the Victoria, Albert, and Chelsea. The Victoria Embankment, on the left bank, extends from West minster Bridge to Blackfriars, about a mile and a quarter. It is one hundred feet wide. Somerset House fronts on this embank ment. It is ornamented b}' some statues and the celebrated Cleo patra Needle. The Chelsea Embankment is also on the left bank, and extends from the Albert Suspension Bridge to Chelsea Suspension Bridge, past Chelsea Hosjutal.

Almost every house on the western side of the new boule vard is occupied by foreign lodgers, the streets most affected by tho Continentals being those of Gerrard, Compton (New and Old), Wardour, Dean, Greek, Dudley, and a few not so well known by name. Even on a fine spring morning when the sun finds his way into the nooks and corners of Soho, there is a dinginess over the entire locality which nothing can thoroughly remove ; there is an utter absence of colour ; and the residents of the quartier are for the most part an unshaven, unkempt army. Heaven knows how hundreds of these poor creatures manage to keep body and soul together. Some are, for certain, skilled ouvriei s, engaged at marble works and at the numerous manufacturing jewellers' and ivory turners' ; not a few are choristers when there is any Italian opera \" going ; \" others are teachers of languages and music, when they RECENT STREET IMPROVEMENTS. The Metropolitan Board of Works is winning the admiration of all Londoners by the energetic manner in which it is pushing to a successful completion many long-needed improvements. Among the recent blessings bestowed by the Board is the Charing Cross Road, connecting Trafalgar Square with Oxford Street, which was recently opened by the Duke of Cambridge. With the con struction of Shaftesbury Avenue and this new thoroughfare the foreign quarter of the metropolis has been, as it were, laid bare for the inspection of the world at large, and the mystery in which the Soho region was for so long enveloped ruthlessly dispelled. Tra ditions, however, are not speedily or easily swept away, and it will be a good many years ere the historic memories of this exception ally interesting section of Old London are buried in the past. The characteristic features of tbe Soho of to-day are the shops of the French \" epicier,\" \" boulanger,\" \" fournisseur,\" \" marchand de vin,\" and the \" blanchisseuse.\" The \"marchand de journaux \" is a conspicuous figure of some of the streets, the newspapers of France and Italy being those in the greatest demand, although Bank of England.

The village of \"Char ing,\" where the new street begins, was once completely detached from London, the addition ofthe \" Cross\" being due to Edward I., who preserved the memory of his deceased wife Eleanor by tho erection ofthe well-known monument. In 1353 the Strand was an open highway, there being no continued street until 1533. St. Mar tin's was literally \" in the Fields.\" Behind Leicester House there stood in 165S the Military Yard, and in the reign of Charles H. M. Foubert had his academy for riding and other exercises here. Gerrard Street, Soho, took its title from Gerrard, Earl of Maccles field, who resided at Gerrard House ; and in this street (close to the new thoroughfare) lived the profligate Lord Mohun, whom the Duke of Hamilton killed in a duel. Coventry House, once the residence of Lord Keeper Coventry, gave its name to Coventry Street. Castle Street, to the left of the first part of tbe new road, will be remembered from the fact that here Archbishop (then Doc tor) Tenison founded in 1685 his celebrated library for the use of his school, which was removed into Leicester Square in 1S72 to enable the National Gallery to be enlarged.

Until General Improve ment and his forces marched into Soho and Seven Dials both sides of Dudley Street were tenanted by vendors of old clothes, old boots, and coals. The side of the street still remaining is rapidly changing its character, and a visit to it lately furnished ample evidence that the glory of the place has departed, and that \" Ichabod \" might be written over every one of the few dismal shops which still disfigure the Avenue. Hereabouts was the once famous Catnach Press, from which issued the \"last dying speeches\" and the \"yards of songs\" which used to be hawked through town and country. To the east of tho \"circus\" formed by the union of the new street and the Avenue is \" Seven Dials,\" a name which has come to be synonymous with all that savours of squalor, rags, and the direst poverty. In reality it is no worse than any other \"poor neighbourhood,\" though its distressful ap pearance is perhaps the more glaring on account of the proximity of \"The Dials\" to the great club quarter, which is, so to speak, \" in the next street.\" The part of St. Martin's Lane in which the somewhat unsavoury spot yclept \"The Dials\" is situated was at one time called the Seven Streets, at another the Marshlands, and at another period \" Cock-and-Pie \" Fields, and it got its rather enigmatical appellation from the seven streets being made to con verge on a centre where there was a pillar, whereon it was proposed to put seven dials. A Doric pillar was erected, and on it six (not seven) faces, or \" dials,\" were placed; but in 1794 pillar and dials and all were removed, in order \" to search for a treasure which was supposed to be concealed there.\" Those who know their London will best appreciate the nature and importance of the latest improvement carried out by the Metro-"], [43, "MODERN LONDON. 59 Scottish, & Australian Bank, 73, Cornhill, E.C. ; Fuller, Banbury, & Co., 77, Lombard Street, E.C. ; German Bank of London, Limited, Bartholomew House, E.C. ; Gillet Bros. & Co., 72, Lombard Street, E.C. ; Glyn, Mills, Currie, & Co., 67, Lombard Street, E.C. ; Gos lings & Sharpe, 19, Fleet Street, E.C. ; Green, Tomkinson, & Lloyd, 32, Nicholas Lane, E.C. ; Grindley & Co., 55, Parliament Street, S.w. ; Harwood, Knight, & Allen, 18, Cornhill, E.C. ; Herries, Far \u2022quhar, & Co., 16, St. James's Street, s.w; Hickie, Borman, &Co., son & Co., 13, Pall Mall, s.w. ; Ridgway & Sons, 2, Waterloo Place, s.w. ; Robarts, Lubbock, & Co., 15, Lombard Street, E.C. ; Rothschild, N.

The limits of size are length, 1 8 inches ; width, 9 inches ; depth, 6 inches. Great advan tage will be derived by the public, from increased rapidity in tho delivery of letters, by the general adoption of street-door letter boxes. Already in many localities these boxes are extensively used, and the Postmaster-General hopes that householders who have not hitherto adopted them will do so. Arrangements can now be made for the collection by town postmen of ordinary letters, &c, from private letter-boxes constructed on private premises.

The mammoth warehouses of this company are the depots of the wine and tobacco importations. St. Katherine's Docks are near the Tower. They cover, with storehouses, &c, about 25 acres. The Commercial Docks at Rotherhithe cover over 75 acres, 59 of which are water. The Grand Surrey Docks, adjoining, are very large and convenient. The}' comprise four separate basins. The East and West India Docks are of extensive area, comprising something like 300 acres. They are situated near Blackwall. The Victoria Docks, below Blackwall, are about 225 acres in extent. Adjoining are the Royal Albert Docks. The Post Office undertakes to construct and maintain private wires and telephone exchanges at annual rentals.

PARCELS BY PASSENGER TRAINS, London's phenomenal growth is a subject of interesting study, and opens up a wide field of speculative theory for the. statistician. One of the ablest newspaper comments on this subject is the fol lowing from a recent issue of the Daily News : \u2014 \"To a great many settled residents in suburban London it is rather a dismal reflection that every spring finds them interned a little deeper in a huge chaos of bricks aud mortar. They make no change of residence, yet every year the fields and the green lanes, the woods and sedgy streams of the country recede farther and farther into the distance. London, it is true, is not increasing just now quite so fast as it has done in the matter of brick and mortar. It did not last year add eighty- six miles of dull, depressing streets to its outer girdle, as it did in 1881 ; but the year before last it added over thirty-five miles, and last year it probably did pretty much the same again. Most of these new streets are cut out of the gardens and orchards, the paddocks and pasture lands immediately surrounding London ; and thousands of Londoners who ten or twenty years ago might take their walking-sticks on Sunday after noons or summer evenings and stroll off for a country ramble, non find themselves practically as far removed from anything of the kind as though they had themselves moved from the suburbs into Cheapside or Smithfield. Every year tho outer ring of the specu lative builder's handiwork widens somewhat, and every year the country-loving suburban resident has to groan in spirit as tin spring-time conies round and he goes out to revisit some favourite spot and finds that it has been wiped out ; that where there was a (MAIN LINE RAILWAYS.)

To tho populace anxious just now to secure North Wool wich Gardens as a public ground, there is no satisfaction in know ing that there is a park at West Ham. To tho people shut up in Clerkenwell it is of no use to point out that Regent's Park lies somewhere up yonder in the north-west ; that out towards tho setting sun there lies Hyde Park, and that away to tho eastward is Victoria Park. Theso may do for holiday resorts ; but when people have ' only one short hour ' for a stroll among flowers and trees, a park is practically inaccessible to them if they have to tramp for half-an-hour to get to it, and half-an-hour to get back. And it should be-borno distinctly in mind that the necessity for open spaces \u2014 in its urgency at least \u2014 is quite of recent origin. London has not only extended, but it has consolidated of late years. Many a quiet lane, many a pleasant by-path, many an open walk amid gardens and hawthorn hedges in the inner suburbs of London, has been ruthlessly overrun by the brick-and-mortar demon within the past ten years. There never was such a necessity as there is now. There never was so large a community doomed to such deso late dreariness as is to be found in vast expanses of suburban London. Every spring finds these expanses more extensive and more remote from rural sights and scenes, without which some of tho wisest and best of the world's philosophers have believed that people cannot be either as happy, as healthy, or as moral as they ought to be.\" PUBLIC OFFICES OF LONDON.

In this year the same Peter Cole-Church began building the bridge of stone, and the work took thirty-three years in completing, being finished in tho year 1209. The bridge, which was about S00 feet long and 30 wide, was covered with houses on each side, an arch of timber connecting them. Near the middle of the bridge was a chapel, whose foundations extended partly over those of the bridge, which afterwards was converted into a dwelling house by the master mason who had laid the foundation of the bridge. On the 10th of July, 1212, this bridge was the scene of an awful catastrophe. A fire occurred at the Southwark end, which brought immense crowds from London to see and extinguish it, but the houses at the City end caught fire bkewise, which prevented their return, while the fire at the south end prevented their ad vancing. The consequence was that they were completely envi roned. Several vessels which approached to take them off were sunk by overcrowding, so that three thousand people lost their lives either by fire or water. In 1282 sour of the arches were borne OLD LONDON BRIDGE. A whole volume might be written about this curious old struc ture, the men who dwelt over its eighteen narrow arches, and the incidents of which from time to time it has been the scene. The first bridge was a timber structure, built about the year 961 by the owner of the ferry, for his own emolument, derivable from the tolls, and continued afterwards in the possession of his daughter. It was burned in the year 1136, in the reign of Stephen, when a great part of the city was also destroyed by the fire. It was after wards repaired and newly built by a priest called Peter Cole-Church, by the help of the revenues of the lands belonging to the bridge View of the Thames.

It was again injured by fire in 1725, and in 1756 all the houses were pulled down. The water works at the Southwark end were begun in 1582, and caught fire and were destroyed in 1774. The toll was discontinued March 27, 1782. August 1, 1831. The length of the present bridge is 928 feet, and within the abutments 782 feet; width of carriageway 33 1 feet. Total cost, \u00a3506,000.

Some fine Saxon specimens of the Confessor's Abbey have been exposed to view somewhat recently. The Babylonian spires are sank, Achaia, Rome, and Egypt moulder down ; but London, the capital of the British Isles, nay, of ' this huge rotundity we tread,' continues to grow with eveu greater luxuriance than when, three-quarters of a century since, our home poet Bung \u2014 '* Returning to the City, Ethelbert's Minster (St. Paul's) was begun. to be rebuilt in 1083, but was destroyed by fire in 1087. It was rebuilt of Caen stone, greatly injured by fire in 1137 ; a now steeple 520 feet high, finished in 1221, was so injured by fire in 1561 that it was taken down. In 1633 Inigo Jones built, at the expense of Charles I., his classic portico; but thirty-three 3*ears later the whole edifice was destroyed in the Great Fire. Thus disappeared the second St. Paul's. We see the lofty spire in the 1543 view of London in the Bodleian Collection at Oxford ; and in Hollar's small \u2022 true and exact prospects ' before and after the fire we see the spireless cathedral.

Our minsters, east and west, have been twice rebuilt ; but the White Tower, the Keep of the Tower of London, built by Bishop Gundulph between 107S and 1081, and bleached by the winds and rains of nearly eight hun dred years, remains the landmark of Eastern London. The Romans had originally a fortress upon the site of our Tower ; but the claim, of Julius C\u00e6sar to founding the White Keep is unsupported by re cords, and is a poetical fiction adopted by Shakspeare in one of his most popular plays, Richard III. The engineers of the present day have strangely swept away many an interesting relic of our metropolitan fortress, and in their work of reconstruction have paid little attention to architectural character ; but they have spared the massive walls and turrets of the White Tower, citadel, or keep \u2014 for many years of itself ' the Tower of London,' the other build ings having been added as outworks. ' ' We have thus incidentally touched the three ancient landmarks of the ' world-city on the banks of Thames,' to show how curiously these points of interest have been maintained throughout the vast extension of the great town. Its distant prospect has been a favourite subject with poets, philosophers, painters, historians, and political writers \u2014 indeed with writers possessing in any degree a reflective turn of mind. About two centuries and a half since Sir John Denham stood upon Cooper's Hill, a charming spot, some twenty miles south-west of London, and here, influent verse, thus. sung its prospect \u2014 Somerset House, from the River. tectural piles, though the fragments of the Roman Wall are chiefly to be traced in vaults and cellars ; and this Roman road exists or is visible but in the name of Watliug-street. These three ancient landmarks of city and suburb rise from their primeval sites. In 610 St. Paul's Minster was founded by Ethelbert, King of Kent ; in 962 it was partly burnt, but repaired the same year. In 839 the city was destroyed by the Danes, and in 886 repaired or rebuilt by Alfred the Great. The Danes extended their ravages to the then distant Thorney Island, and destroyed the church which the pious Sebert had there commenced about 616 ; and which Edgar, some 360 years later, completed, and named from being the minster west of St. Paul's. The abbey was wholly rebuilt by- Edward the Con fessor between 1050 and 1065 ; and here, upon this holy ground, the injunctions of the pious founder have been observed, aud our Sovereigns crowned with his very crown. The Confessor was buried in his new church, which the monarchs of the next 160 years beautified and endowed with rich gifts and legacies. Henry III. rebuilt the church upon the same spot, but hardly was it completed when it was almost destroyed by fire. It was restored in the reigns of Edward I., II., and III. Henry VII. rebuilt the chapel which now bears his name. Successive kings and abbots continued the building on the plan of Henry III., but so slowly that the west-end towers were unfinished in 1714, when they were taken down by Sir Christopher Wren, who built in their place his Grecianised Gothic towers, which, however heterodox in archi- The city lies, And like a mist beneath a hill doth rise, Whose state and wealth, the business and the crowd, Seems at this distance but a darker cloud, And is, to him who rightly thiDgs esteems, No other, in effect, but what it seems ;"], [53, "MODERN LONDON. 69 Where, with like haste, through several ways they run, Some to undo, and some to be undone ; \"While luxury and wealth, like war and peace, raptured eye, Exulting swift, to huge Augusta.

Next the Abbey is St. Margaret's Church, originally built by Edward the Confessor, and rebuilt by Edward I., of which period a few remains exist in the present edifice of various dates. Here is the celebrated Gouda painted window of the Crucifixion, besides much other painted glass. Immediately to the right are the Houses \u2022of Parliament. \" Beyond the Palace of Westminster is seen the noble line of Par liament Street and Whitehall, with Inigo Jones's beautiful Ban queting House (now the Royal Chapel) on the south side : upon a scaffold in the open street, now Whitehall, Charles I. was beheaded.

The mother church of St. George is a stately edifice, built early in the last century ; that of Marylebone is of the pre sent century, the original mother church having been converted into a parish chapel. Three centuries since this was the only building between the village of St. Giles and Primrose Hill ; near by are Tavistock, Gordon, Woburn, Russell, and Bedford Squares.

Holborn, too, was noted for its inns for travellers, a few of which remain. Gerard had a garden in Holborn when he wrote his ' Herbal ; ' Sir Kenclin Digby, Milton, and Dr. Johnson also lived in Holborn ; here, upon the site of Ely Place, was the Bishop of Ely's house, the gardens of which were famed for strawberries ; and in Aggas's plan are shown its vine yard, meadow, kitchen-garden, and orchard. Here Sir Christopher Hatton lived in great state: his name is preserved in Hatton Garden, and the rurality of the district in Saffron Hill, Field Lane, Goldsmith so well described, and Churchill satirised. \"Pie Corner \" was noted for cookshops, and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.

The old Fleet Bridgo between Holborn Hill and Snow Hill was un covered twenty years since. Here, nearly half a century ago, we remember to have seen four offenders in tho pillory, just handy to be pelted by the rabble of Fleet Market, then in Farringdon Street ; and here, upon the east side, was the Fleet Prison, where, to the last, prisoners begged its founder, who also built tho original Hospital of St. Bartholomew, the earliest institution of the kind in London.

Duke of York's Street is St. Martin's-le-Grand, where is the long facade of the General Post Office, upon the site of the ancient college and sanc tuary-. The street northward is Aldersgate, an interesting locality of Old London, the road extending thence to Islington. Leftward of this road is St. John Street, passing the Charterhouse collegiate asylum, school, house, and chapel ; and the third road, on the right, passes, by Prince's and Moorgate Streets, through Finsbury, by the City Road, to the Angel Inn, Islington ; these being tbe three long lines shown in the Picture beyond St. Paul's. \" Before we return we must halt at Finsbury, orFensbury, manor, named from its fenny ground, which was held by the Corpora tion of London by lease from St. Paul's Cathedral from 1315, at an annual rent of 20s. ; the lease expired in 1867.

The present Exchange was de signed by Mr. Tite, F.R.S. : the plan is chiefly from the Pantheon at Rome ; tlie architecture is exuberant, but characteristic of com mercial opulence and civic state ; the material is the finest Port land stone. It was built in three years, and cost \u00a3150,000, some what less than the architect's estimate. The sculptural enrichments, statues, arms, and emblems, are in good taste ; and the architect's -composite is admirable. The grandest feature is tho western portico, larger than any in Great Britain ; the eight columns are 41 feet high, and the entire height of tho portico is 74 feet ; width, 96 feet. The Exchange was opened by Queen Victoria in 1S44, as her Majesty's predecessor, Queen Elizabeth, had opened the first Exchange (Gresham's) in 1570, whoso original grasshopper vane surmounts tho tower. In front of tho Exchange is Chantrey's equestrian statue of Wellington. There are several edifices of very ornate description in this locality ; and hence is seen the lofty decorated tower of Wren's Church of St. Michael, in Cornhill. \"North of the Exchange is the Bank of England, an insulated assemblage of buildings and courts, occupy-ing three acres : it has no external windows. The general architecture is Corinthian, and it was completed by Sir John Soane. \"Nearly facing the west front of the Exchange is tbe Mansion City of London School ; Front View on the Victoria Thames Embankment. House of the Lord Mayor : it has a very fine Corinthian portico, and is altogether of palatial grandeur.

Facing the river is a public terrace or embankment, such as we should hke to see throughout each bank. Opposite is the new Palace of Parliament, between the spires of which we see the vast roof of Westminster Hall. This river front is 800 feet long, just the length of Chelsea Hospital. through the metropolis varies from S00 to 1,500 feet. The river has lost what little character it had for purity; and 'silver Thames' and other poetic phrases have become obsolete. By the altered sewage it is no longer ' fishful ; ' a dip in it resembles a mud-bath ; and many thousands a year are spont in deodorising tho water. Its impurity has become proverbial; and not long since we heard ?. preacher in old Chelsea Church compare a good man, in this world of sinners, to a bright fish ' in the muddy Thames,' the preacher pointing to tho stream flowing past the church. \" Westminster Bridge, of elevation to givo effect to tho Palace of Pariiament, is an elegant hon structure (Page, engineer) to super sede Laveleye's cumbrous stone bridge, which contained nearly doublo the quantity of stone employed in St. Paul's Cathedral, and cost half a million of money in forty years for repairs. \" St. Mary's Church, Lambeth, withits old tower (temp.

Following the roadway of this bridge, you proceed, by Qupen Street, and, crossing Cheapside, by King Street, reach the Guildhall. The exterior is poor modern Gothic, and the interior is spoiled by its flat roof; but the hall is fine, and will hold 6,000 persons. Here has been for four centuries and a-half the \" Town hall \" of London, remembered by the magnificent feasts given here to potentates and princes ; and here are some grand memorials of heroes and kindred patriotic spirits. Returning to the river, we reach Queenhithe, originally a Saxon hithe, and named from its being part of tho dowry of Eleanor, Queen of Henry II. , and in Stow's time the chief water-gate of the City. Its chief trade was corn, emblematic of which tho spire of St. Michael's Church, over against the hithe, has for a vane a gilt ship, which will hold a bushel of grain. We next reach the Fishmongers' Company's Hall, occupying a granite platform at the north-west angle of London. \" Blackfriars Bridge is next reached : as left by Mylne, the archi tect, it was of graceful design, but tho substitution of a solid stone parapet for its balustrade is to bo regretted. Its repairs cost in seven years nearly \u00a375,000. From this bridge the magnificent dome of St. Paul's appears in impressive contrast with the less harmonious body of the building. Viewed from Cheapside, St. Paul's presents an imposing mass : and the western front, with its campanilo, and the majestic dome, is a stupendous termination to the vista of Ludgate Hill ; the group being made more piquant by the spire of St. Martin's, Ludgate. \" The river is next crossed by Southwark Bridge, of iron, cast nearly fifty years since in Yorkshire.

From this point is seen to advan tage, on the opposite bank, tho Priory Church of St. Mary Overy. In its pinnacled tower, 150 feet high, is a set of twelve bells ; the choir and ladye-chapel have been correctly restored ; not so the nave and transepts. Here are buried the early poet Gower and Philip Massinger. Thence to Southwark Bridge is Bankside, anciently noted for its playhouses and pleasure haunts ; great part is now occupied by Barclay & Perkins's vast brewery, which includes the site of Shakspeare's Globe Theatre. \" Below bridge is the pretty river front of Billingsgate, which has been a gate, or quay, for eight centuries.

The group of Decorated buildings to the right is St. George's Roman Catholic Church, Schools, and Convent, designed by Pugin. These are built upon the site of the focus of the ' No Popery ' riots of 1780. The church is rich in painted glass, carving, gold and colour; and will seat three thousand persons. Opposite is Bethlehem Hospital, whither the lunatics were removed from tho hospital in Moorfields. The large and lofty dome was added to the building in 1845, and is about 150 feet from the ground. The group of Gothic buildings on the left is St. Thomas's Church and Schools, in the Westminster Road. \" The long Tudor building to the right is the School for the In digent BUnd, where the children are educated, and, with adults, employed in useful handicraft ; the principal tower and gateway are very picturesque.

The large octagonal build ing in the distance is Surrey Chapel, where the Rev. Rowland Hill was pastor nearly fifty years : he died at the age of eighty-eight, and is buried here. The church beyond, leftward, is Christ Church, Blackfriars Road.

Southwark was likewise an extensive station and cemetery of the Romans during their early dominion in Bri tain, as attested by floors of Roman houses built long before the district received its Saxon name. The ancient interest of Lambeth is concentrated in its Palace, founded in 1262, and which has since been the residence of the Primate of all England. Lambeth was long celebrated for its places of amusement. Vauxhall Gardens were mentioned by Evelyn just two centuries since ; upon the site were recently built a church and art schools. Cuper's, Belvidere, and Cumberland Gardens were also here. The Dog and Duck dates from 1617, the year upon the sculptured sign stone preserved in the garden-wall of Bethlehem Hospital.

Potteries have existed here for two centuries; chemical works, \u25a0soap and candle works, shotworks, and artificial stoneworks, are also Lambeth notabilities. Southwark in the Roman times has been mentioned. It was fortified by the Saxons, burnt by William the Conqueror, rebuilt and sold by Edward III. to the citizens of London. Edward VI. granted an annual fair ; and in 1550 it was constituted a ward of the City. It has sent members to Parliament since temp. Edward I. It had formerly two Mints for coinage.

And now we come to one of the greatest events in the history of the British Empire \u2014 one that will occupy a prominent place in her records while she exercises so powerful an influence in the governing councils of the civilised globe. The 21st June, 1887, the date of Her Majesty Queen Victoria's Jubilee, wiU be handed down to posterity as an event worthy to be recorded by all who ad mire the unblemished and honourable life of a sovereign who has so deeply interested herself in her subjects and leaves an example on record that may well be copied by those who may succeed her. Her history is as pure as it is interesting, but it is beyond our pro vince at the present moment to enter on anything pertaining to a detailed account of her career as a ruler of a mighty empire. Our space is limited, and we must confine ourselves to a merely chronological note. Suffice it to say, then, that in 1837, Queen Victoria ascended the throne, and on the 21st June, 1887, she arrived at the fiftieth 3-ear of her reign. The occasion was made an event of rejoicing in the mercantile metropolis of the world, supported by rulers of every country and the people of every clinie, rendering it a pageant of splendour unprecedented in the annals ot historical events. Her Majesty drove from Buckingham Palace through Piccadilly, Pall Mall, Northumberland Avenue, the Thames Embankment, to Westminster Abbey, where she attended1 a thanksgiving service, surrounded by royalty, nobility, and officers of rank, producing a spectacle so gorgeous that it must leav*\u00bb an indelible impression on the minds of all who had the pleasure o5 witnessing it. It would be impossible to give even an approximate idea of the vast numbers who thronged the streets of the metropolis on the occasion, to do honour to a sovereign they so highly revere.. The enthusiasm that prevailed may better be imagined than de scribed, and the ringing cheers that greeted Her Majesty may be taken to heart by every ruler who witnessed them as a token ot British respect and gratitude extended to a popular sovereign. During the week London presented a scene unexampled in its his tory. Floral decorations and illuminations indescribably magnifi cent adorned the walls of the huge city, producing an aspect of grandeur that must be remembered with pride by every British subject, who must take a pleasure in relating it to his chil dren, and thus handing it down from one generation to another: With this we must close our chronological list and leave future events to future publications.

The London and Lancashire Life Assurance Company, 66, Cornhill, E.C. \u2014 Any review of the relations subsisting between the London of to-day and that most beneficial of all modern institutions \u2014 the system of perfected life assurance, would be singularly incomplete were it devoid of due reference to the past career and present status of the London and Lancashire Life Assurance Company, one of the most prominent among metropolitan and British organisations of its kind. This important company, whose handsome chief offices are situate at the above address, was founded in 1862, with an object which it has ever since that date un- failingly and consistently held in view, viz. \u2014 the transaction of home, foreign, and colonial life assurance business at rates as moderate and under conditions as liberal as should be compatible with the mutual security of itself and its clients. The subscribed capital of the company is 100,000/., vouched for by a wealthy and influential body of shareholders. This capital has been issued in 10,000 shares of 10/. each, of which 1/. has been paid up, and to which 1/. has been added by way of bonus, thus doubling the paid-up capital, and on which increased amount a dividend is paid of 10 per cent., equivalent to 20 per cent, on the original amount of 1/. per share paid up. That extremely sensitive gauge of the stand- ing and condition of all mercantile and financial concerns of the compatiy order \u2014 the Stock Exchange to wit \u2014 has afforded a gratifying indication of the good repute in which the \" London and Lanca- shire \" is held in monetary circles, for the shares of the company are now not to be procured without much difficulty, and have been lately dealt in at the respectable figure of 4/. 5s. The company's progress during the period elapsing since its establishment in 1862 has been marked and continuous, and especially gratifying has been its development within the past ten years, a space of time during which its premium income has been almost trebled. The figures substantiating this statement may here \"be given, and are as follows: \u2014 In 1876 the new assurances effected and policies issued amounted to 329, 705/. ; in 1886 the same class of annual business had increased to 608,870/. In 1876 the new premiums received were 11,168/.; in 1886 they were 22,013/. In 1876 the net premium income was 49,093/., and the accumulated funds 139,983/.; in 1886 the net premium income had grown to the significant figure of 127,442/. ; while the funds stood at 476,772/. These funds are most securely and profit- ably invested, largely in Indian and Colonial Government Stocks and Railway Debentures ; and they, coupled with the additional security of the subscribed capital of 100,000/., and with the fact that absolutely no liability on the part of the assured is incurred, offer a guarantee, quite unquestionable, of the company's ability to fully meet all present and future obligations. For the rest \u2014 it is a well-known fact among the insur ing classes that the directors of the London and Lancashire Company have ever evinced a desire to keep perfectly in touch with the progressive spirit of the age, and to successively adopt all improvements in life assur ance routine that should commend themselves to consideration by reason of merit or feasibility. And in following up their laudable course of ad vancement in this direction, the governing body of the institution have been especially particular in developing all that is worthy of development in the important modern feature of bonus-es, or participation of policy holders in the profits of the business. It will be sufficient here to state that four -fifths, or eighty per cent, of the net profits of the concern are apportioned quinquennially to holders of participating policies, in order to clearly indicate the advantages offered by the company in this noteworthy respect. The assured have the option of applying the bonuses thus apportioned either (1) as an addition to the original sum assured, payable at death, (2) in reduction of future premiums, (3) as a present receipt in cash, or (4) in making polices payable during lifetime. The last valuation for profit-divisioil took place on December 31st, 1887, and the large increase in the company's funds since the preceding declaration of profits left a good surplus for division. The effect of this to policy holders is shown by the following extract from the recently issued Bonus report: \u2014 On policies of five years duration, the bonus declared is equivalent to 56 per cent, of the premiums received during the five years. On policies of ten years duration, it is equivalent to 61 per cent, of the premiums received duriug the five years; and on those of twenty years duration, it is equivalent to 64 per cent, of the premiums received during the five years. As to the policies issued by this prosperous and well-conducted institution, they combine the three great merits of being world-wide in application, indisputable, and non-forfeitable ; and the dis tinguishing features of the company's highly approved and extensively patronised system of operations to-day are : low rates of premium, large bonuses, liberal and non-exacting conditions of assurance, and prompt settlement of claims \u2014 than which no characteristics could be better in ac cordance with all modern requirements. The company has local agencies throughout the United Kingdom, and competently controlled branch offices in Bristol, Belfast, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Merthyr (South Wales), Montreal, Calcutta, and Bombay; and the scope of its business transactions in all branches of life assurance embraces every quarter of the globe. The honourable, equitable, and efficient administra tion ofthe company's affairs by an able aud influential directorate, and the capable manner in which the executive duties and managerial and actuarial functions are discharged by such experienced head-quarters officials as Mr. G. W. Mannering, assistant secretary, and Mr. William Palin Clirehugh, manager and actuary, are to be especially commended ; and nothing could be more praiseworthy than the care and consideration shown by the whole governing body in uniting the individual interests of the company, its shareholders and its policy-holders, and making them one and identical.

It also permits the in stantaneous massing of the entire force to prevent tho spread ot a con flagration should the danger ever necessitate it. The arrangements for awakening the employes in case of fire, are as complete as electrical science and ingenuity can devise. Coils of hose, ready tor instant use, are pro fusely distributed on every floor, in addition to which there is an ample supply of the most improved chemical extinguishers. The end of each of the principal corridors opens directly on to a fire escape, affording easy access to the ground. The corridors and passage ways are illu minated day and night by a system of pilot lights which never go out. A strict rule is, that no matches or tapers be used on the premises. Throughout the day ten alarm stations are guarded, and after 11 p.m. there are no less than 22 under vigilant care. As a further precaution every entrance and exit to each part of the building is equipped with wrought-iron double doors which can be instantly shut. When one takes into consideration the hundreds of persons on the premises at all hours of the day and night the necessity of Buch extensive precautions is at once apparent, and the wise forethought of the firm in this particular is in keeping with the liberal ideas which they entertain for the welfare and safety of all beneath their roof. Messrs. Marshall and Snelgrove give em ployment to over 2,000 persons. About 700 of these board and lodge on the premises. Ever)' possible arrangement has been made for their comfort and happiness. The sleeping apartments are large, well heated and ventilated. There are Libraries for the use of the employes, besides smok ing, committee, reading, and sitting rooms. The kitchen department is a model of neatness and perfection in cooking and mechanical arrangements. Its three roasting ovens have an aggregate capacity of 2,200 lbs. of bref at one roasting. Nothing* but the very best food is served, and by the systematic arrangement of every detail the process of preparing the meals for the large force of hands, is effected with less trouble than prevails in an ordinary private kitchen. Mr. James Marshall, Senr., the founder of the house, retired from active commercial life about sixteen years ago,. after au honourable and prosperous career. He now resides on his estate,. Goldbeater's Farm, Hendon. Mr. Snelgrove retired from business in 1885. Mr. James C. Marshall, son of the founder, is now the respected head of the house. His son, Mr. Arthur J. Marshall, is the junior member of the firm. The perfect system of organisation which the firm has brought into every-day practice, and which conduces greatly b the carrying on of such an immenso business, is one of the secrets of its success. The fame and high reputation of the firm are so familiar to the general public that further comment would he superfluous. It is such establishments which best illustrate the ability and energy of Lon don's commercial community. The position maintained by Messrs. Marshall and Snelgrove is such as is accorded only to those houses whose career has been identified with honourable methods and sterling principles of mercantile integrity. Marshall and Snelgrove, Silk Mercers, Lacemen, Furriers, Drapers, and Carpet Warehousemen, Oxford, Vere, and Honrietta Streets, and Marylebone Lane, W. \u2014 The history of modern mer cantile enterprise has no more striking example of well-directed energies and commercial skill than is to be seen in the career of such a thoroughly representative London establishment as that of Messrs. Marshall and Snel grove. Half a century has rolled by since the foundation of this mammoth concern was laid, and during the intervening years it has steadily developed the field of its operations, and kept pace with the growing demands of a critical public. A record, such as that possessed by this establishment, is creditable alike to its founders and the intelligent community wherein such things are possible. It was on April 10th, 1837, that the house was founded by- Mr. James Marshall. It at once commanded an influential place in metropolitan commercial circles, and under the far-sighted judgment of its founder it soon became the recognised emporium for the most desirable class of the purchasing public. Year by- year, the trade of the house developed and increased its growth. Twelve years ago the present magnificent building was erected, and with its completion was in augurated an era of uninterrupted prosperity. This building, bounded by Oxford, Vere, and Henrietta Streets, and Marylebone Lane, is the most perfectly equipped and arranged establishment of its kind in London. Architecturally it is an ornament to the part of the metropolis in which it is located, and internally its arrangement is the result of study, experience and a thorough appreciation of public requirements. The operations of the establishment are conducted in twenty-five departments, each one complete in itself, and the whole forming a splendid example of systematic organisation. Every modern method and appliance, which in any way tend to facilitate the transaction of business, are brought into requisition. Silks and kindred fabrics, one of the specialities of the establishment, are shown in a profusion and variety unequalled by any house in the world, Messrs. Marshall and Snelgrove being the heaviest purchasers in the Lyons market. Other noteworthy departments are those devoted to laces and embroidery, cloaks, linens, muslins, ribbons, hosiery, flannels, costumes and ball dresses, milb'nery and dressmaking, haberdashery-, flowers, gloves, and jewellery, furnishings, carpets, rugs and floor cloths ; ladies' outfits and children's outfits, shawls, mourning, &c. Each of these is completely stocked with the finest imported and home made goods, in all the latest and most fashionable colours, textures, and designs, all of which are sold at prices compatible with quality and fair dealing. The head of each department is possessed of a thorough know ledge of its requirements. The chief distinctive feature of the house is the superior quality and immense variety of all goods kept in stock. In silk goods it has for years been the leading establishment in the metropolis, while its excellence for mantles, furs, and fine costumes has long been a \" household word.\" It also imports largely every novelty that the increasing energy and talent of continental manufacturers can supply. A tour of its numerous departments will vividly illustrate the perfection attained by the busy workers in the world's industrial centres. Wholesale Detartmen-t. \u2014 This is one of the leading features of the house, and the trade done in this department is of great magni tude. An immense stock is carried, not only the best goods but those of a medium quality being dealt in. With their superior facilities and con nections Messrs. Marshall and Snelgrove are enabled to offer special advantages to customers and to execute the largest orders in the promptest and most satisfactory- manner. The retail trade of the house extends throughout every part of the king dom, two large branch establishments, one at Leeds and one at Scar borough, supply the firm's patrons in their respective districts. A steadily increasing business is transacted with the people of America, both on whole sale and retail lines. Special attention is paid to the taste of American ladies, and in catering to this department of their business the firm have achieved a marked success. The sample department is a prominent feature, and so great are the demands made upon it that machinery is em ployed to cut the numerous fabrics up into samples preparatory to their being bunched and mailed to applicants in all quarters of the globe. As many as 1,000 letters are received daily by the firm, and the demands of this vast correspondence are carefully attended to by- a well-trained postal and correspondence department. In the Counting Rooms upwards of 100 experienced clerks and accountants are employed. The Examining Booms, where all goods are carefully scrutinised by experts, before being placed on sale, are a special feature of the establishment. Nothing is allowed to pass that is in any way imperfect, or would not prove satisfactory in every- particular. Another praiseworthy- and interesting feature of the establishment is its Fire Brigade, composed of employes, who are regularly drilled and thoroughly- equipped to prevent the out break or spread of a conflagration. This Fire Department, organised in December, 1880, has from its inception received every material aid and en couragement from AL. Marshall. He gave a carte blanche order for all the necessary apparatus, his only stipulation being that nothing but the very best and most improved appliances be purchased, and that there be plenty of them. That his wishes were intelligently carried out is seen in tho perfect equipment of the building. The organisation of the Fire Brigade consists of forty enrolled members under the charge of Captain J. J. Jones, and four deputy captains. Alarm signals are located in convenient places throughout the building ; these communicate direct with the captain's headquarters, from which point the alarm can be sent to every, or any special part of the premises as desired. By this arrangement an incipient fire could be quickly subdued, without causing any- excitement or un- Messrs. Arthur Tooth & Sons, Dealers in Works of Art, 5 & 6, Haymarket, S.W. \u2014 Just opposite Her Majesty's Theatre i to be found one of the most attractive and celebrated of London's high class art depots, that controlled by the distinguished house of Messrs. Arthur Tooth & Sons, founded in 1842, as dealers in works of art. The premises occupied at this eligible address take worthy rank among the most complete and well-appointed of their kind in the metropolis, and, indeed, in the kingdom. They comprise the whole of a fine four-story building, the lower facade of which is of coloured marble, while au exceedingly handsome entrance lobby is lined with the same attrac tive material. All the spacious showrooms, of which there is a very numerous suite, are beautifully furnished and richly carpeted ; taste ful displays of rare flowers and plants add wondrously to the artistic character of the general effect. The entire arrangements for the recep tion of patrons, particularly those who visit in such large numbers tin many exhibitions of paintings for which the firm are famous, have been perfected in a manner which leaves absolutely nothing to be desired. Messrs. Arthur Tooth & Sons' displays of artwork aro widely- renowned among all classes of- the picture-loving community, and their advent during their appointed season is awaited by the many who find unfeigned pleasure and profit in attendance at functions of this really elevating character. Throughout the firm's galleries may be seen at almost. any time superb specimens of the pictorial art of all the most eminent lights of the British and foreign schools of modern painting. Indeed it would be difficult to find a more worthy or distinctively advantageous field for the adequate exposition of the merits of such works than the rim saloons so admirably prepared for their accommodation by- this enterprising house. One magnificent exhibition-room in particular, situate at thl rear of their building and possessing an area of sixty by forty superficial feet, is well worthy of a word of individual praise : in matters of lighting, wall accommodation, and general appointment it is certainly not surpassed by any picture showroom of a private character in London. Messrs. Arthur Tooth & Son have constantly on view and on sale paintings in oil and water of the highest order of excellence. The commercial opera tions of the firm are of a most extensive and distinctly superior character. They conduct their flourishing business in a spirit of careful and judicious enterprise which is born of a due regard to the maintenance of old and honourable traditions, and the further development of the eminent repute they at present so deservedly enjoy. Their general trade, both of a home and export character, possesses valuable connections amon\"- the bi classes of custom and patronage in all parts of the world."], [67, "MODERN LONDON. 83 Moore Brothers, Tea Merchants, 35, King William Street, E.C. \u2014 One of the oldest and most eminent houses in the London tea trade is that of Messrs. Moore Brothers, the well-known merchants iu teas and coffee. This distinguished firm, standing prominently forward among the longest-established institutions of its kind in the City, was founded in 1823, and occupies large and very commodious premises, admirably suited to the purposes of the superior trade carried on. Messrs. Moore Brothers' system of business operations is that of direct dealing between importer and consumer. They supply families in all parts of the metropolis and the United Kingdom first hand, in quantities convenient to themselves, at merchants' prices, for ready money, aud ship teas under bond to the various ports in Europe. In this way customers are obviously saved all intermediate profits, anil the economy thus effected is allowed to act beneficially upon the quality of the goods supplied. Messrs. Moore Brothers have always applied themselves in their parti cular line to the demonstration of the trite, but none the less true dictum, that \" the best is the cheapest \" ; whilst their system of supplying families at merchants' prices enables them to supply at their King William Street \u25a0depot teas at prices 10</. to ls. less than charged by the largest dealers in the trade. They always hold very large and carefully selected stocks at a wide range of prices suited to all household and general requirements. Quality is, however, the first of all Messrs. Moore's considerations. It is never sacrificed to mere outwardly-apparent cheapness ; and, even at the lowest rates, the firm's goods can always be relied upon as quite compatible in every essential point with the high standard of general excellence they have at all times scrupulously maintained. Messrs. Moore supply the finest drawing-room tea at 2s. 8d. per lb. ; this is simply magnificent, and a treat for connoisseurs. China Moning is supplied at ls. 3d. per lb., and a special line in Indian and Ceylon tea (which is now very popular) they sell at Is. 6rf. per lb. This last-named blend is of marvellous strength and excellent flavour, and decidedly the cheapest tea in the market. Messrs. Moore Brothers also hold extensive and choice stocks of coffees, chocolate, and cocoa, embodying features of merit in a similar degree to the tea stocks, of which they make a first speciality. The reputation and long standing of this house are a guarantee of its ability and willingness to fully carry out all its undertakings in supplying the public with teas, and associate com modities, of unexceptionable excellence at the lowest possible rates. The firm have not under-estimated the difficulties attending the following up of such a course of business action, but they have relied upon the vast re quirements of this country in the lines in which they engage to accord them a trade of sufficient magnitude to make even merchants' prices remunerative in the aggregate ; and the great success that has thus far attended the operation of their system shows that they were fully justified in the confi dence they reposed in that popular appreciation which seldom fails to reward all worthy efforts made in the public behalf and interest. Messrs. Moore Brothers, in their monthly circular, very reasonablv say, that after consistently pursuing their system of supplying families direct first hand at merchants' prices for the long period of sixty-five years, it is owing to the appreciation of their teas, and to the cheerful recommeudations of their customers, that, without the enormous expenses of sensational adver tising, they have for so many years conducted one of the largest tea and coffee businesses in the United Kingdom. It is to such firms as this that London owes her commercial greatness, and we do but justice in according them this notice. Kindersley & Johnson, Crown. Chemical Works, Marsh Gate Lane, Stratford, E. \u2014 The important chemical manufacturing busi- ness carried on at the Crown Chemical 'Works, in Marsh Gate Lane, Stratford, was founded in 1863 by Mr. W. T. Scott, and carried on till 1886 under the name of Scott & Co., when Mr. Seott retired from the business, and its title was changed to the present form. The proprietors now are Messrs. Kindersley, Johnson, and Hooper, trading as Kindersley & John- son. The two former gentlemen have been associated with and interested in the concern almost from the date of its commencement. The manufactures for which the Crown Chemical Works have become justly celebrated include genuine flowers of sulphur, roll and rock sulphur, acetic acid and acetates, refined Sicilian brimstone, mineral acids (pure and commercial), sulphites and bisulphites of lime, soda, potash, See., and salts of antimony. copper, iron, lead, tin, zinc, &c. The uses of these chemicals are almost legion, and for flowers of sulphur forindia-rubber makers, and treatment of the vine against the odium phylloxera, powder making, roll sulphur for hop drying, special acids for colour and white-lead works, they are justly celebrated, and they are produced and supplied by Messrs. Kindersley & Johnson in great quautity for export and home trade. The wholesale druggists are also large buyers, and manipulate these iu their own laboratories, prepare them for various purposes, and dis- tribute them to the trade throughout the world. The quantity of raw material consumed iu the works is about five thousand tons per annum. For the \" Crown Brand \" of chemicals above-named Messrs. Kindersley & Johnson have long maintained a high reputation, and their productions have a standard name and credit ; their trade mark \" Crown Brand,\" with which all their goods are stamped, is a guarantee of thorough excellence of quality aud perfect reliability. The Crown Works are very extensive, covering more thau three acres of ground, and extending to the river. Here the firm have their own engineering- staff, and engineers' shops fitted with lathes and all requisite machinery for keeping the fine chemical plant of the establishment in proper working order. They have also a cooperage and staff of coopers, and keep their own barges for the conveyance of goods from the works to the docks, aud their teams of beautiful horses and handsome vans testify to the smart way in which the business is carried on. The export trade of the house is one of very notable magnitude, and is most influentially established in the Australian colonies, New Zealand, the Cape, Straits Settlements, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and various parts of the Continent, where the \" Crown Brand \" chemicals hold a position of the highest repute. The home trade is one of much importance, also, and the firm have agents in Manchester and Neweastle-on-Tyne, the whole of the midland counties being worked from the former, while Newcastle attends to the north and Scotland, and London to the south, cast, west, and exportation. The principals of this prominent firm are, respectively, Captain Kindersley, an officer who served in the Indian Mutiny and the Crimean War. He is a justice of the peace for the county of Essex, and his influence, strict integrity, power of organisation, and general tact have contributed much to the success of the business here under notice. The partner in the concern who conducts the numerous chemical operations, and has prac- tically worked the business up to its present size and notoriety, is Mr. James Edward Johnson, and he is a gentleman of keen discernment and much practical and scientific knowledge and experience. He is a Fellow of the Chemical Society, and also of the Institute of Chemistry, member of the Society of Chemical Industry, Society of Dyers and Colourists, and a member of the chemical section of the London Chamber of Com- merce. He sets his staff a bright example of what can be done by patience, perseverance, and real hard work. The other partner, Mr. James Hooper, who has recently joined the firm, takes at present no active part iu the business, hut his connection materially helps the onward progress of the concern, aud he will take up the position Captain Kindersley now occupies in the business, on the retirement ot the latter gentleman. The joint administration of the partners is charac- terised by sound judgment, aud all the features of personal ability, energy, and skill which win and retain the confidence of the trade. John Ponler & Son, Timber Merchants, 228, Cable Street, E. \u2014 Prominent and important among the timber dealing concerns of the east of London stands the well-known house of Messrs. John Ponler & Son, of Cable Street, E., one of the oldest and largest institu- tions of its kind in this part of the metropolis. The business was founded under the name of Ponier in 1822, and was carried on under that name until two years ago, when the last member of the founder's family died. Mr. Boss is now sole proprietor of the concern, with which he has been associated for a number of years, and he, out of a proper regard for the old-established connections of the house, retains the title under which those connections and their valuable attendant trade were built up and secured. Mr. Ross, moreover, is a man of strong business capacity and advanced commercial ideas, and he has proved himself ready and desirous of moving with the times in everything, a fact which will certainly conduce to the further extension of the large business over which he is now pre- siding with marked ability and enterprise. Thus the old connections of the house \u2014 some of them of forty and fifty years standing \u2014 will be care- fully and adequately considered and maintained, while at the same time the policy of the management will lead to the continuous creation of fresh business. And from this it is not difficult to predicate a future of enhanced prosperity for a house so thoroughly worthy of the good fortuue that has always attended its career. Tbe firm deal in every description of timber, from all productive sources, and for all industrial purposes, and hold great stocks, valuable, varied, and of splendid quality, at their Cable Street yards. These premises comprise very large drying grounds, &c, with excellent accommodation for stock, the whole extending from Cable Street to St. George's Churchyard, a distance of nearly 300 feet. The general trade controlled is one of much magnitude and importance, and the house has customers in all parts of London and throughout the A. & H. Poulton, Fur-Skin and Commission Merchants, 2, Butler Street, Milton Street, E.C. \u2014 A well-known warehouse in the City is that belonging to Messrs. A. & H. Poulton, who are merchants dealing largely in fur-skins, &c. The business has been established some years, and is one of the most important in this branch of trade. The firm occupy spacious premises, comprising offices, showrooms, and warehouses on the ground floor and basement. They carry on a very extensive and important trade in mauy valuable kinds of furs, which they import in large quantities. Their large and valuable stocks include many rare and beautiful skins that have been obtained under circumstances of great difficulty. The showrooms present a very attractive appearance, having an extensive stock well arranged and displayed. A very large business is done in both the home and the export departments, the connection in the United Kingdom extending to all parts of the provinces, and embracing the best wholesale houses. The business is very ably conducted under the personal super vision of the proprietors, to whose able and energetic management the firm's success is due, aud through which they have won the respect of home counties. the commercial community. E 2"], [68, "MODERN LONDON. 84 Miers & Levi devote their attention chiefly to the manufacture of women s and children's boots and shoes, and in these branches of the trade they are very extensively engaged. Their large factory is fitted with improved machinery. No expense has been spared to render the works complete in every detail, and the various cutting and sewing machines include some of the most valuable inventions. They employ a large number of hands. Exceptional care is exercised iu having all work of the very best quality A very lar^e trade is done both in the home and export departments. The business is very ably conducted under the personal direction of the proprietors, and much ofthe rapid progress aud success achieved by this firm is due to the able and energetic system of management adopted. E. M. Reilly & Co., Gun Makers, 16, New Oxford Street, W.C. \u2014 This is one of the oldest-established businesses in the gun making industry. Besides the head-quarters near Museum Street, there is an important branch at 277, Oxford Street, near Begent Circus. The firm is well known throughout the Continent, through their haviug, until quite lately, a branch of the business iu Rue Scribe, and later on at 29, Bue Faubourg St. Honore, Paris. This firm is as much respected in India and the colonies as in the United Kingdom. The business was established some seventy years ago by the father of the present principal, aud under the auspices of that gentleman attained a considerable aud widespread reputation, acquiring a large and influential connection both at home, abroad, and iu'the colonies, the proprietor having the honour of being specially appointed gun maker to the King of Portugal, to the King of Spain, and also by letters patent to the King of the Netherlands. The , premises are handsome and showy, well in unison with the noble thorough fare in which they are situated, and a considerable number of skilled employes are engaged throughout the year. The productions of the firm are manifold and varied, and many of their specialities afford ample proof that both father and son have kept pace with the active mechanical pro gress of the times, perfecting all valuable improvements, while ignoring many unpromising attempts which have not answered with other makers. They introduced the breeeh-loading system when all the gun trade opposed and ridiculed such an innovation, though it soon became universal. Later on they laid aside pin-fire, and adopted the central-fire ignition, which has not yet been superseded. Then followed Express rifles, hammerless guns, 1 self-ejector guns, special pigeon guns, in the barrels of which they first I used Sir Joseph Whit worth's compressed steel tubes; their density and superior qualities have loug since been admitted. With these barrels and advanced choke boring they obtained their unparalleled success in pigeon : shooting, by which their patrons won larger amounts in money and prize , eups than s'ecured by any other makers. Considerable success and public notice attended these changes and improvements, which obtained for the house marked distinction, the gold medal of the International Exhibi- tion, London, 1884, being awarded to their exhibit upon that occasion, and their specialities having also gained a silver medal at the International Exhibition, 1885, and prize medals at the following exhibitions, viz. : at London, 1851 and 1862, Paris, 1855, Havre, 1878, and Calcutta, 1883. Their stock is the largest and most varied of any other house in the trade. Every article of their manufacture is of first-class workmanship and finish, being guaranteed for efficiency and safety, and having undergone the severest proof in the rough as well as in the finished state, and having been carefully and accurately tested for correct shooting. Orders by letter or by telegram are promptly and faithfully attended to as if the parties were present, aud the articles, if ready, are forwarded at ouce ; foreign orders also are packed and shipped, or despatched overland without delator trouble to the purchaser. E. M. Reilly & Co. has been for many years the style of this firm, it being found too laborious for one individual to follow up the increasing operations of their trade at home and abroad. The partners and employes possess all the energy, enterprise, and business qualifications requisite 'in the present age, and they have succeeded in maintaining the prestige of the name among sportsmen and connoisseurs, \u25a0who all admire perfection and beauty of workmanship combined with the highest efficiency in the field. E. Izod & Son, Corset Manufacturers, 30, Milk Street, London E.C., England.\u2014 There is no better or more creditably known house in connection with the manufacture of au almost indispensable article of female apparel, into which it has introduced so many valuable construc tive improvements, than that of Messrs. E. Izod & Son, the eminent firm of corset manufacturers, whose offices are located as above. This noted house was founded upwards of twenty-five years ago. The firm show a great . variety of style and attractiveness of manufacture in the \" Izod Patent Cor sets \" whose merits have made them popular in a universal sense. There can 'however, be but one opinion in the minds of all unprejudiced persons after* an examination of the Izod Corsets,\u2014 and that opinion will he a conviction that neither hurt nor barm cau accrue to anyone properly and judiciously wearing these really reliable, and in every respect commendable, improvers of bad figures and beautifiers of good ones. Messrs. Izod, in their manufacture of Patent Corsets, discard all hard and stiff materials, and the natural consequence of this is that their corsets become, instead of a shell or case, a garment, flexible and pliant, adapting themselves to every movement of 'the figure, and yet sustaining, supporting, and restrain ing the figure within such reasonable bounds as are requisite to secure its perfect grace aud symmetry. They are likewise unsurpassed in lightness, strength, sound workmanship and material, durability, exquisite design, unique model, and beauty of finish ; and beyond this surely the most exacting must refrain from asking more. Among the many features of Dovelty\u00b0and attractiveness contained iu the extensive stock shown at the Milk Street warerooms are such items as the \" New Figure Regulator,\" the \" New Golden Reign,\" the \" Circular Hip,\" the \" Ad Bern,\" the \" Artystyque,\" the \" Tourist,\" and many other equally noteworthy varie ties of the Patent Corset, all constructed upon the same principles which have made these goods, collectively, so widely and deservedly famous and popular. The firm also devote particular attention to the making of corsets for the growing figures of young girls. It is well to note also that each pair of \" PateDt Corsets \" made by this house is stamped with the name \"Izod,\" and with the firm's registered trade-mark, an anchor. This is necessary for the consideration of those who desire to obtain the genuine article. The firm control very extensive works at Landport, Hants, where a large staff of hands is constantly employed ; and so great has been the well-merited success of their manufactures, that the Izod Patent Corsets can now be obtained from all respectable drapers and ladies' outfitters in almost any quarter of the globe. Health, the well- known journal edited by Dr. Andrew Wilson, F.B.S.E., &c, observed a short time back : \" But when the dictates of physiology and health are \" observed, and when the corset, like boots, shoes, hats, or any other part \" of our dress is constructed on rational principles, and when it is worn \" in a rational fashion, there can be little question of its healthy nature, \" and still less question of its value as an article of female attire.\" And further on in the same article the writer says : \" In the entire make of \" Messrs. Izod's corsets the principles of anatomical construction have \" been rigidly adhered to, while, unlike many of the recent achievements \" in rational dress, there is an utter absence of awkwardness, and a pre- \" servation of all the normal lines of figure symmetry.\" No better or more eminently authoritative outside recommendation than this could be desired for an article whose own inherent merits constitute for it a potent password to the good opinion and favour of the feminine population of every near or distant land. R,. Mayer & Son, Mineral Water Manufacturers, 46, Myddelton Street, E.C.\u2014 An establishment of great distinction in its particular branch of industrial enterprise is the well-known mineral water works of Messrs. B. Mayer & Son, whose trade mark is a very attractive representation of the statue of Sir Hugh Myddelton, their factory being located in a leading thoroughfare in Clerkenwell, named after that doughty knight. This house was founded in 1840 by Mr. E. Mayer, senr. (and -waspurchased by Mr. A. B. Mayer in 1883), in Goswell Road, aud subse quently transferred to larger premises in Lloyd's Row, where latterly increasing business necessitated the occupaucy of the present extensive premisess The order and general business offices face the street, abutting on a spacious yard, on entering which, to the right, is a range of stabling some 150 feet in length, with bottle and forage stores above, in which capacious building over thirty horses are kept at bait. The best-known and improved machinery obtainable is almost continuously at work, turning out with marked regularity some 4,000 dozens of soda water and lemonade every week. The second floor is devoted to the equally requisite purpose of bottliug the 3,600 dozens of ginger beer brewed on the top floor. The entire establishment is very commodiously arranged. The firm also brew some 3,000 gallons of ginger beer weekly to send out in casks. The great speciality is their \" Champion \" (registered) brewed Jamaica ginger beer, a very superior beverage that is rapidly gaining preference wherever introduced. About ten commercial travellers are permanently employed. The business done is very extensive among the trade all over London, while the private custom is by no means small. The firm members are gentlemen of large experience as mineral water manufacturers, and highly esteemed by their customers. Hamburger, Pool, & Co., Importers of Butch Bacon, 17, Water Lane, E.C. \u2014 A leading house engaged in the wholesale im- portation of Dutch bacon is that of Messrs. Hamburger, Pool, & Co., proprietors of the Dutch Bacon Company. This enterprise was estab- lished in 1883, and since its foundation has received a large patronage from the wholesale provision dealers, packers, and exporters. The base ] of operations conducted by this house relates to the breeding of live stock i in Holland, which were originally imported from Mr. Howard's Brit'innic Farm, Bedfordshire, one of the finest breeds in the world. There thev kill and cure at their own factory at Ede, Gelderland, which is the most extensive of its kind in Hollaud, and thus, handling the best and freshest of everything in their line of their own breeding, cutting, packing, and curing, the house is naturally popular with consumers. The individual members of the firm have brought to bear upon their enterprise sound judgment, tact, and energy, backed by ample capital and experience, and in their particular line have established a reputation which fully entitles them to the respect and confidence of the metropolitan provision market they enjoy in such a marked degree.

Among the leading boot manufacturing firms of tbe East-end of London a very prominent position is taken by Messrs. Miers & Levi, whose business was originally established about ten years ago. Messrs."], [69, "MODERN LONDON. 85 F. Mordan & Co., Manufacturers of Gold Pens, &c, Albion Works, 326, City Road, E.C.\u2014 The old-established and well known firm of Messrs. F. Mordan & Co., manufacturers of gold pens, writing and copying ink, &e., of the Albion Works, is one of the most cisTEDf prominent commercial houses of the metropolis. This yy.yr business was founded in the year 1836, and was for many years carried on in the Goswell Road. The firm was then engaged solely in the manufacture of their Indestruc tible Gold Pens. Subsequently, iu the year 1860, owing to the extension of their business, the rapid development of trade and commerce, aud the increasing demand for these articles, Messrs. F. Mordan & Co. removed their business to the present extensive premises in the City Road. Soon after the removal of the business to this locality, Mr. Mordan became the purchaser of the old-established business of Messrs. Boatwright, Brown, & Co., sealing-wax makers, which, since the year 1796, had been carried on in Watling Street. This firm was for many years, and Messrs. Mordan & Co. are now, the makers of the wax for the Great Seal. For some time Mr. Mordan found it impossible to obtain a suitable writing ink for his gold pens, and was led to prepare what is called the \" Abroticon, or Gold Pen Ink.\" This was a great success, and has since led to the manufacture of all kinds of writing, copying, and ruling inks. With re spect to the manufacture of the celebrated Everlasting Gold Pens, this firm has during the last forty years made above 100,000 of their best (21s.) pens. The number of the lower quality, though it cannot he accurately ascertained, is supposed to be over a million. A pen made of gold, as Mes9rs. Mordan well observe, is in reality the cheapest, be sides being the most pleasant to write with. It is always easy to the hand, has the same smooth gliding motion over all kinds t\" \u2022*ES> Y, of paper, and practically never wears away. If accidentally broken it is not entirely lost, for it can be exchanged for a new i>UWD<j\u00ab pen ofthe same quality at a small charge. Messrs. Mordan & Co. have been awarded manj- medals at the various international exhibitions for the superior quality and excellence of the various products of their manufac tory. The name of F. Mordan & Co. on their goods is a well-known guarantee that they are of the best quality and workmanship. The firm are now commencing the making of quill pens, and are producing large numbers of their celebrated dagger series of steel pens. The business in every department is conducted in a most spirited and enterprising manner, and gives employment to a vast number of skilled and experi enced workmen. Messrs. Mordan & Co., from their old standing, their high position in commercial circles, and the extent and importance of their transactions, rank with the oldest and most influential mercantile houses in the City of London. Maynard, Harris, & Co., General Outfitters, Agents, &.C., 126 and 127, Leadenhall Street, E.C. \u2014 As complete caterers to all the outfitting requirements of travellers to foreign parts, residents abroad, and members of the three services, there is no London firm more promi- nent or better worthy of the marked success they have achieved than Messrs. Maynard, Harris, & Co., the well-known general outfitters, East- India agents, bankers, &c. This eminent house was founded as long ago as 1825, engaging from the first in the important line of business with which its name has since become inseparably' associated; and it has during its long and exceptionally prosperous career built up a trade and con- nection of enormous proportions and widespread extent. The business is of a most comprehensive character as it is at present conducted ; and there is hardly any end to the host of ways, both great and small, iu which Messrs. Maynard, Harris, & Co. can be, aud are, of use to the traveller, sportsman, explorer, official, army, navy, or civil service man. The premises occupied in Leadenhall Street comprise a very commodious and well -situated double shop, handsome in appearance and appointment, and heavily stocked with the wide variety of excellent goods for which this representative house has become so justly celebrated. These stocks constitute in their entirety a perfect and remarkably complete exhibit of everything classifiable under the elastic heading of \" Outfitting.\" Here, first of all, are trunks, portmanteaus, bags, air-tight boxes, despatch boxes, dressing cases, dressiug bags, all kinds of portable camp aud barrack furniture, luncheon baskets, spirit stoves, &c, with a noteworthy novelty in Levinge's Improved Anti-Mosquito Curtains, which have only to be seen to be at once appreciated and approved. Then there is every description of outfitting as regards clothing, from the smallest and most inconsequent item to the largest and most important \u2014 a complete array of requirements for India, the colonies, and foreign lands. In this respect Messrs. Maynard, Harris, & Co. have developed a valuable speciality in outfitting for apprentices in the East Indian and colonial merchant service ; also for all branches ofthe military and naval services, including the regular army, militia, volunteers, royal and merchant navies, and for the diplomatic and civil services generally. All classes of wearing apparel for private use also receive full attention ; and the firm always hold fine stocks of select and reliable goods in shirts, underclothing, hosiery, &c, and in various tailoring fabrics of best quality and newest style and pattern. The next department is that of supplies, and is quite commen- surate in importance and completeness with the other branches of this great business. Here are to be found (not of course actually on view in every instance, but always readily available) carriages, harness, saddlery, furniture, musical and band instruments, china, glass, and earthenware, plate and plated ware, stationery, military and sporting arms, preserved provisions, wines, and all kinds of miscellaneous stores. These goods are supplied by the firm at short notice and in any quantity, as well as suitable in character for any climate. And to this list may be added a great variety of specialities for regimental use, games for recreation rooms, and a vast diversity of other goods that have from time to time been added to the firm's list as occasion or necessity arose. Commodious as are the premises in Leadenhall Street, it is obviously out of the question to suppose that any more than a representative selection from leading lines is, or could be, placed on view in the shop. Messrs. Maynard, Harris, & Co. control extensive stores at 1, Bevis Marks, E.C., where the bulk of their enormous stock is warehoused ; and thence the goods are drafted as required into the Leadenhall Street salerooms, or sent out in quantities to fulfil various large contracts. There are many other special features connected with the business of this important house. The firm, for instance, act as bankers, receiving and disbursing pay, pensions, and family remittances, drawing dividends, opening banking accounts, issuiug letters of credit and drafts upon India and the colonies at current rates of exchange, making investments and effecting sales on the stock market, and otherwise acting as financial attornies and agents. They also forward to any address abroad the home newspapers and periodicals regularly, and supply the same to military libraries, book clubs, societies, reading rooms, &c. everywhere, whether at home or abroad. Special attention is also given to the complete fitting up of officers' and men's quarters, recreation rooms, and libraries. Passages are engaged free of charge to any part of the world, plans of ships, maps, handbooks, and every information being supplied; baggage is collected, shipped, and warehoused ; packages and parcels forwarded by overland route or via. Suez Canal ; and cases are provided, and articles of all kinds packed with care and security. The splendid facilities of the firm, resulting from long establishment and valuable experience, enable them to be of almost in- estimable service to those about to travel to, and take up, a residence in foreign or colonial parts, wheresoever it may be. Messrs. Maynard, Harris, & Co.'s business in all its important branches is conducted with exemplary care, judgment, and ability, and is devoted to the supply of the most reliable and trustworthy goods exclusively, the firm having received no fewer than fourteen gold and silver medals for varied manufactures at the Calcutta International Exhibition, 1884 ; and a silver medal at the Inventions Exhibition, London, 1885. The house has agencies in Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, and Kurrachee, and widespread connections of great value and influence, upholding a most extensive and constantly-growing home, foreign, and colonial trade. A. Hammond & Co., Music Publishers, 5, Vigo Street, W. \u2014 The firm of A. Hammond & Co. is one of the oldest firms in this trade in London, and has been in existence about forty-five years. It was originally founded by the celebrated J ullien, who made the Promenade Concerts so popular, aud was at one time a pupil of Cherubini. He was a clever composer of dance music, and established this publishing firm iu 1842 at Maddox Street, removing to Begent Street in 1846, the present premises being occupied subsequently. Mr. A. Hammond succeeded to the business iu 1858, but died in 1860, the concern having been since carried on by his son, the present proprietor, Mr. J. A. Hammond. The principal feature of Mr. Hammond's business has invariably been instru mental music, more especially dance music. School music, of which the firm holds an unsurpassed stock, is made a special feature of the business. This firm also devotes a deal of its attention to publishing music for the cornet, and they issue some very fine arrangements for that instrument aud piano by W. Winterbottom and J. Levy. Among the latter is the cele brated \"Levyathan Polka,\" which that finest of all executants made so popular. Another important work published by this firm is Winter bottom's \" Complete Tutor for the Cornet,\" which is one of the best out on the subject. Among what may be termed the cheap editions of dance music Messrs. Hammond publish a series of Music Portfolios, which are equal to anything of the kind issued. The selection of pieces, which includes some of the very best dances of Gung'l and Strauss, is worthy the attention of music lovers. The firm is excellently managed, well known, and does a first-class business, wholesale and retail, both in the United Kingdom and abroad."], [70, "86 MODERN LONDON. the making of all kinds of galvanized iron goods for various uses ul purposes. At Brunton's Wharf the works of Messrs. Skaife & Co. are of very large dimensions, covering au area of ground about 200 feet deep, -with a front age to Commercial Boad of 170 feet. The working facilities of this establishment touch perfection in every point relating to an expeditious and economical production of first-class goods, aud both in the high effi cacy of the fine mechanical plant in operation here, and in the number and\" skill of the staff of hands employed, the firm possess distinct and valuable advantages, the good results oi' which are apparent alike in the quality and volume of the output. It may be added that some of the machinery in use in this establishment was made at these works, and from their own designs. The galvanized iron industry is vigorously and successfully carried on in all its branches, and the principal pro. ductions of the' works are as follows :\u2014 Galvanized corrugated sheets, ridging, gutters, Ssc. ; galvanized flat sheets ; galvanized cisterns and tanks, drums for oil, corn bins, wheelbarrows, cattle troughs, cattle cribs, skeps; swing water barrows, garden engines, hose reels, stove pipe, chim ney flues and cowls, cresting and astragals, Ssc, &c. Sheet steel and bar iron are prominent items in the stocks held for supply for all purposes ; andiron work of all descriptions is galvanized on the premises after the best and most approved method. Corrugated sheets for roofing are, obviously, among the leading specialities of the house, for there is hardly any connection in which galvanized iron has proved more valuable than in the roofing, or even the entire shell construction, of buildings of all kinds \u2014 notably churches, schools, sheds for industrial purposes, store houses, and farm buildings. Flat sheets of galvanized iron, and sheets for working up are also largely made by Messrs. Skaife & Co. ; but per haps the house has developed no more important feature than the manu facture of tanks, cisterns, and the other made-up goods named above. In these respects a great success has been achieved, and that solely upon the merits of tbe productions themselves, which are in high repute everywhere at the present day, and are recognised as standard articles in every matter of excellence and reliability. The firm also make a great variety of build ing requisites, which enjoy a similarly high degree of favour both at home and abroad. The capable and energetic manner in which this business has been conducted from the date of its inception has been one of the chief factors in securing and sustaining its prosperity ; and the policy of the administration at the present day is such as to ensure a contiuuance of that prosperity, and a further enhancement of the high position Messrs Skaife & Co. have always held in the public estimation. John Curran, Wholesale Provision and Commission Merchant, 17 and 19, Finsbury Street, E.C. \u2014 That the wholesale pro vision trade conducted in London is of vast importance to the whole of the United Kingdom is a fact well known to all. Some of the merchants in this trade devote their attention to the supplying of retail provision shops, whilst others cater to the requirements of pastrycooks. In this latter branch of the trade there is no house better known or commanding a more extensive connection than that of Mr. John Curran, wholesale and commission provision merchant, of 17 and 19, Finsbury Street, E.C. Commencing business in 1867, Mr. Curran devoted his attention to the cultivation of the pastrycook's branch of the provision trade, and so successful have been his efforts in this line that to-day he stands foremost in his particular line of business. Having had a long experience in the trade, and a consequent knowledge of the market, he is able to operate on the Brewers' Quay and Tooley Street markets with considerable success. Buying largely in butter and eggs of British and foreign pro duction, and receiving large consignments of similar goods for sale on commission, he is enabled to sell at the lowest market price. Mr. Curran supplies pastrycooks not only in all parts of London, but all over the United Kingdom. The connection is of the highest class, and is well looked after by a competent staff of travellers.

This trade has been most ably and vigorously developed from the first, both by the late Mr. Blidberg and by his capable and experienced surviving partner and successor, Mr. Tholander, and under such adminis tration the house has become a factor of great importance in shipping supply, and its business has attained to very large proportions. The premises occupied in Limehouse are extensive and commodious, running quite through from Emmett Street to Bridge Road, a distance of about 200 feet. The Emmett Street frontage rises to an elevation of three lofty flats, and this portion of the premises extends rearwards for 60 feet. The accommodation throughout is of the best character, and the immense stocks held are kept in notable good order, and in perfect condition for immediate delivery. Mr. Tholander is purveyor to the Royal Swedish Navy, and maintains a valuable and influential connection with ship owners and captains, not alone in London, but in all parts of the United Kingdom. Among Continental sailmakers the name of the house is also well and favourably known, and Mr. Tholander's business relations in this latter respect constitute not the least important feature of a system of commercial operations that ranks among the largest and best-developed undertakings of its kind in the metropolis.

In addition to these, bookselling is made a special feature of the business, and the same may be said of stationery and account-book manufacturing. In all these lines Messrs. Watson Bros. are noted throughout the City for the excellence of their work and productions, and their services and goods are consequently in growing demand among the leading commercial establishments of the metropolis and the suburbs. The partners are not merely theoretical men, but have a practical experience of fifty years, and manage their business with ability and enterprise. They are well known in trade circles, and highly esteemed for their integrity and liberal dealing. J. Hubbard, Wholesale and Export Boz Manufacturer, Wholesale Stationer, General Factor, and Printer, 28, Ashwell Road, Roman Boad, Victoria Park, E. \u2014 This business was originally carried on for many years iu Clerkenwell, and has been located at the present address twenty-five years. Every description of plain and fancy card-board boxes, suitable for chemists, jewellers, perfumers, drapers, boots and shoes, &c, are manufactured by the firm, who are entirely wholesale. Paper bags are also manufactured, and a large stock kept of general stationery, packing papers, &c. Printing is also carried on ou the premises, tbe proprietor not only printing labels for the various kinds of boxes, but also doing a large trade in general commercial printing and theatrical printing work. A large staff of workmen is constantly employed. Mr. J. Hubbard personally supervises the various branches, which he conducts with ability and enterprise. He is well known in the neigh bourhood, and greatly respected for the straightforward manner in which he carries out all his business dealings. Cope & Company, Tea Sealers, 9, Mincing Lane, E.C.\u2014 In any notice of the London wholesale tea trade, prominence must be given to the firm of Messrs. Cope & Company. This business was estab lished very many years ago by Mr. A. W. Cutler, but was purchased in 1885 by Messrs. Cope, Agnew, & Smith. Iu 1887 Mr. Claude Lewis Cope became sole partner, and it has since borne his name. The premises in the occupation ofthe firm include a fine suite of offices, handsomely fur nished, and thoroughly well appointed and equipped. The sampling and tasting rooms are convenient and well lighted, and the whole establishment is within a stone's- throw of the great mart of the tea trade\u2014 the Commercial Sale Rooms. Messrs. Cope & Company have a fine connection amongst the retail aud wholesale dealers of both London and the leading pro vincial towns and districts. They employ a numerous body of accom plished and experienced travellers, who cover every portion of the United Kingdom, and whose aggregate turnover reaches a very heavy amount. The acting partners in the firm have the reputation of being skilful buyers and reliable tasters, and are much respected and esteemed in commercial circles. The firm takes high rank in the trade, and its history is one of gratifying progress and great and unusual success. Skaife & Co., Galvanized Iron Manufacturers, Brunton's Wharf, 669 to 673, Commercial Road, Limehouse, E. \u2014 Few industries play a more prominent part in the modern commerce of London than that of galvanized iron manufacture, and no better representative of this im portant trade could readily be found than the well-known house of Messrs. Skaife & Co., of the Patent Galvanized Iron Works, Commercial Road, E. This typical firm was founded between thirty and forty years ago by the father of the present proprietor, now deceased. Mr. Skaife was one of the first who established galvanized iron works in London, nearly forty years ago, and his name is almost as well known as the industry itself. The firm carries on a most important business and industry at the above address, engaging extensively in the production of galvanized iron in bulk, and in"], [71, "MODERN LONDON. 87 J. R. Roberts, Practical Tailor and Juvenile Outfitter, 79 and 81, Mile End Boad, E. \u2014 Prominent among the leading tailors and | outfitters' establishments in the east of London, stands the well-known j house of Mr. J. B. Boberts. The business was founded in 1850. The premises have a frontage of 40 feet to the main road, and have a fiue appearance ; indeed, it would do credit to any business thoroughfare in the metropolis. Every branch of the trade is carried on, both in ready-made clothing and in bespoke work. No. 79 shop is the ready-made depart ment, and contains a very large stock of clothing, while No. 81 shop is the bespoke department, where a large variety of cloths in all the newest patterns are shown. Perfect fit, good style, and the best material are guaranteed by the proprietor, who has had long experience in the trade. A feature of the business is the making of liveries, uniforms, &c. to order. The juvenile outfitting trade of this firm is a very large one, a large stock of boys' suits being held, suitable for children of all ages. A numerous staff of assistants are constantly employed at this establishment. The proprietor conducts his business with great care and ability, paying great attention to the orders of his customers, aud giving them the very best value in return for their money. The connection of the house is a valu able and important one, and includes nearly all the leading residents iu ihe district. for about forty years, till 1829, when Mr. William Green took it, aud he was succeeded in 1849 by his brother, Mr. Samuel Green, with Mr. Branscombe as partner, till 1875, when Mr. Green retired and Mr. Brans- combe became the sole proprietor until the last few years, when his two sons were admitted into partnership ; and the rapid strides the concern has made in their hands is sufficient evidence of their tact and general high business capacities. Mr. Branscombe is now at the head of an estab- lishment that can bear favourable comparison with any of our West- end establishments. The stock is of an inexhaustive and varied character, embracing all that is novel in drapery goods. Suffice it to say that the resources of the concern are such as to place them within the reach of all classes of customers. For silks of a superior quality, costumes, and millinery goods, embodying the latest fashions and improvements, mourning, lace, and household linen this house may be allowed to stand unrivalled. The house-furnishing department exhibits some splendid productions from the hands of the cabinet maker, and in every respect the firm highly deserve the prominence they have attained. The premises are of vast dimensions, containing five ordinary shops, and the general regularity of the interior is such as can only be found in houses of a thoroughly progressive character. A most extensive staff is employed, and the greatest activity is observable in every department. The proprietors are gentlemen of long and matured experience, and their keen and unerring judgment cannot fail to prove invaluable to the com mercial undertakings of Hackney and district. T. Wood, Mineral Waters Manufacturer, 430, Hackney Boad; 78 to 90, Temple Street ; 7, 8, and 9, Seabright Street ; and 4, Hill Street, Hackney Road, E. \u2014 The business conducted by Mr. Thomas Wood stands, by reason of its extent, old establishment, the high quality of its productions and extensive output,_/ne*7e princeps. Indeed, it is open to questien whether, in its particular branch of trade, the establishment can be equalled in the British Isles. It was founded over half a century ago, at a time when the demand for aerated waters was of very smalt -dimensions compared with what it is at the present day. The factory and numerous buildings in connection therewith are of immense extent, and cover a total area of well-nigh three acres. The factory is fitted up in the most effective and complete manner, and iu this respect was finished only last year, so that all the plant and machinery are of the. most modern and improved character. There are departments for lemonade, ginger beer, ginger ale, soda water, seltzer water, potass water, lime juice, orangeade, and many other beverages ; and each section is fitted up with its own special machinery, which is used for no other purpose than the production of the drink in question. In addition to the above departments, there is the cordial manufactory, an extensive building of two floors ; this, too, is fitted up most elaborately with machinery and utensils necessary for the production of all kinds of cordials and fruit syrups, which are turned out iu immense quantities, and in quality second to none, and are put up in pint and quart bottles, also in one gallon jars, at 7\\d., ls. 3d., and 5s. respectively, thus bringing them within the reach of all. Any of these syrups blended with hot, cold, or aerated waters, form a most refreshing and invigorating drink. The superiority and general excellence and purity of the beverages made by this firm are known all over London and within a radius of twelve miles of tbe City. Their purity and refreshing properties have been duly appreciated, and the result is a trade and patronage unsurpassed by any other house in the London mineral water business. In one depart- ment alone there is plant capable of turning out upwards of 20,000 dozens per day, while in the brewed beer section there is one machine capable of bottling twelve gross an hour. The drinks are sold at one shilling per dozen bottles, and niuepence per dozen for splits, with the exception of the ginger beer, which is sold at the rate of eightpence per dozen of thirteen, in stone bottles. The articles are obtainable at the principal hotels and restaurants throughout the metropolis and suburbs. Show tablets and \"order\" post cards are supplied free on application, and the former are \"got up \"in the most striking and attractive styles. So great and so rapidly increasing are the demands upon the firm's resources that 100 hands are constantly employed in the works. The delivery department neces- sitates the employment of a number of horses and vans, which deliver free within a radius of a dozen miles of the works. No charge is made for the bottles, Mr. Wood trusting to his customers' integrity and their due appreciation of his liberality in this regard, and so far with the best results. In consequence of the increase of business, Mr. Wood recently acquired for storage purposes Nos. 290 and 291, Bailway Arches, and adjoining premises at Cambridge Heath. The management is able and energetic, and is the great secret of the prosperity attending the firm's operations. Mr. Wood loses no opportunity of meeting his customers' wishes as far as he possibly can, and invariably supplies an article of the first quality. To these facts, and his steadfast adherence to the strictest -canons of commercial probity and liberality in all transactions, is due the success attending his eminent house in its important branch of the metropolitan victualling trade. John Atterbury, Chronometer, Watch, and Clock Maker, and Manufacturing- Jeweller, 129, Strand, W.C. \u2014 There are few establishments more familiar to habitues of the Strand, or more attractive to the casual passer-by in that busy and pre-eminently interest- ing thoroughfare, than the handsome establishment of Mr. John Atterbury, the well-known manufacturer of chronometers, watches, and clocks. This extensive and successful business was founded in 1875 by Mr. John Atterbury (who had previously for many years been foreman to the late Mr. John Walker, of the Strand aud Cornhill), who still remains sole proprietor of the house, to the management of which, upon thoroughly sound and practical lines, he has devoted all his energies and resources of skill and experience. The shop is elegantly appointed and very taste- fully arranged throughout, and it contains what is undoubtedly one of the fiuest assortments of watches, clocks, chronometers, and gold and gem jewellery to be found in the Strand. Mr. Atterbury, being essentially a practical man, and possessed not alone of the executive skill, but also of the commercial capacity which commands success, had not been in business for himself long before he had firmly established a valuable reputation. This was enhanced and justified by the \"Certificate of the Highest Merit \" awarded to him by the committee of Kew Observa- tory, and his reputation and renown as a chronometer maker are now among the most eminent in London. His stock, as already indicated, is a superb one in every respect, and is largely composed of his own productious \u2014 high-class watches and clocks of splendid finish and perfect structure, made by workmen of long experience, all operating on the premises under Mr. Atterbury's direct supervision; every description of superior jewellery in gold, silver, aud precious stones \u2014 all goods of the first order, of genuine worth and intrinsic value. As a manufacturer of jewellery, and as a dealer in diamonds and precious stones, he is able to produce every description of gem ornaments at exceptionally moderate prices. The stock of gem rings and diamond jewellery is a handsome one, aud such as is not seen in every jeweller's establishment, and this is accounted for by the fact that Mr. Atterbury conducts a widespread business with distingues of all nationalities. Many of the brilliant and valuable ornaments are of most novel and unique design, bearing upon their surface the impress of artistic skill and cultured taste, showing the high appreciation Mr. Atterbury has for the ornate requirements of his cultivated clientele. The watches and chronometers are also specialities of the stock, and embody in themselves all the excellences that the art and skill of the modern horologist have been able to devise and perfect. There are no better or more reliable timekeepers to be had than Mr. Atterbury's watches, all of which are fully warranted in this respect. Mr. Atterbury devotes careful attention to the adjustment of watches and clocks, aud makes valuations for probate in anything appertaining to his line of business. He controls a most extensive and influeudally connected London and country trade, and sends goods to India, the colonies, and various foreign parts wherein he has resident patrons. Frederick L. Page (Sole Agent for Great Britain and Colonies for Johann Maria Farina, Alexianerstrasse No. 5), 101, Leadenhall Street, E.C.\u2014 The name Johann Maria Farina, Alexianerstrasse No. 5, is of world-wide celebrity. The London agency was formerly held by Mr. Braumuller, of Snow Hill, but some three years ago it was transferred to Mr. Frederick L. Page, of the above address. The trade connection is most extensive and widespread, including merchants, chemists, perfumers, and wholesale and retail dealers in every part ofthe empire. Mr. Page is also importer direct of Bock's Golden Eagle cigars, the finest Havanna cigars in the world. Mr. Page is assisted by an effi cient staff, but he himself retains the entire management of the business. He is a gentleman of great experience and first-rate business ability. J. H. Branscombe & Sons, General Drapers and House Furnishers, 331, 331a, 333, 335, and 337, Mare Street, Hackney, E. \u2014 The old-established house of Messrs. J. H. Branscombe & Sons, -whose neat and commodious premises are conveniently located at Mare Street, Hackney, E., has a history dating back about one hundred years, when the business was established by Mr. W. H. Holmes, who continued it"], [72, "88 MODERN LONDON. Lawes' Chemical Manure Company, r>9, Mark Lane, E.C. \u2014 It would be difficult indeed to over-estimate the value of the service ren dered to the cause of agriculture in this and other lands by the world famous house trading under the title specified above. Chemical manures are a mighty factor in agricultural progress and prosperity to-day, and with them in their earliest introduction, intermediate development, and present high attainment of efficacy and esteem, the name of the Lawes' Chemical Manure Company, and that of its distinguished head and founder, Sir John B. Lawes, Bart., will be for all time identified with eminent credit. The researches and discoveries of the illustrious chemist, Baron Liebig, had much to do with the birth of a movement in favour of the more scientific preparation of fertilizing agent6; but to Sir John Lawes belongs the credit of having imparted an irresistible impetus aud onward impulse to that movement by means of his own investigations and the results thereof. After completing his education at Eton and Oxford (where he prosecuted his chemical experiments in the decidedly practical, though not perhaps remarkably useful, fashion of a youth endowed with a lively appreciation of the good points of a joke), Sir John Lawes re turned to his home at Bothamsted, St. Alban's ; and it is upon record that he there, at the age of twenty, equipped one ofthe best bedrooms in the house with every requisite of a well-appointed chemical laboratory-, and entered seriously into what he saw even then was to be the work of his life. From that time to this Rothamsted has been a kind of agricultural Mecca, which the industrious tiller of the soil \u2014 though not actually making pilgrimages thither \u2014 has constantly held in happy thought and remem brance, and to which he has always confidently looked as to a centre of experiment and effort from which should come to him the very best aud most carefully compounded aids to enable him to coax from an indif ferent soil a plenteous harvest. In 1834 Mr. Lawes (now Sir John) commenced his occupation of the famous Home Farm, and what he ac complished there, and the use he made of his achievements, are matters of the widest familiarity in the circles they directly concern, and call for no word of comment bere. As far back as 1844 he established himself as a manufacturer of chemical manures and special fertilizers, resolving to develop this branch of active undertaking to its utmost capacity, aud in sixteen years he was the controller and proprietor of a hundred acres of land lying along the Thames bank at Barking Creek. Here is now concentrated one of the most remarkable industrial systems of its kind extant, and it is safe to affirm that there is not in the world an establish ment devoted to this particular branch of chemical manufacture which equals in magnitude or influence that of the Lawes' Chemical Manure Company at Barking. Anything like a detailed description of these immense works is far beyond the capacity and scope of the present brief sketch; it is only possible here to mention a few salient points which serve to outline the general nature and plan of the operations there carried on. From all parts of the surrounding neighbourhood the position of these works can be accurately determined by the huge chimney stack that towers into the murky air of Barking to a height of 1 75 feet, und measures something like 28 feet in diameter. This great chimney, it is said, has played the role of general doctor and physician in ordinary to the dis trict, and has done this in a peculiar manner. The manufacture of sulphuric acid is practically the basis of this industry, since that chemical product enters as an important ingredient into most of the preparations of the firm. In the production of this agent a small percentage of the acid fumes generated is allowed to escape by the lofty chimney referred to, and these fumes tend to purify the atmosphere of the neighbourhood from what was formerly a chronic tendency to the development of fevers and agues. The whole sanitary effect of the chimney upon the locality in which it stands appears, indeed, to have been remarkable ; and even a case of small-pox was condemned to loneliness and isolation, and speedily died out itself for lack of a congenially infectious atmosphere. Thus the company's works are a distinct local benefit, as well as a source of universal agricultural profit. With regard to the manufacture of sulphuric acid \u2014 it is produced from Spanish pyrites, of which 10,000 tons are imported annually, and the yearly output of acid amounts in all to about 23,000 tons. The immense size of the works, of which the sulphuric acid department is only one section, may be best understood from the fact that their structural parts alone \u2014 factories, warehouses, sheds, and wharves \u2014 cover an area of nearly thirty-five acres. During 1887 the wages expenditure amounted to 24,000/. The workiug staff consists of men and boys, who are well paid, the former earning twenty-two shilliugs, and the latter ten shil lings per week and upwards, on an average. The engineering and mechanical equipment of the entire works can only be described as the perfection ot a plant outfit for such an establishment. The specialities ofthe house consist in the following: \u2014 Lawes' Turnip Manure, Lawes' Dissolved Bones, Lawes' Mangold Manure, Lawes' Cereal Manure, Lawes' Dissolved Peruvian Guano, Lawes' Potato Manure, Lawes' Concentrated Mauure, Lawes' Corn and Grass Manure, and superphosphates of all grades. Each of these is the outcome of Sir John Lawes' assiduous researches and investigations into the science of fertilizing by chemical influence, and each article has fulfilled its allotted mission with results that it is superfluous to say have been in the highest degree satisfactory. In the preparation of the above tbe firm employ their manufacture of sulphuric acid, in conjunction with various products of the earth, viz. : mineral phosphates, guano, bones, hoof and horns, dried blood, nitrate of soda, salt, potash, and sulphate of ammonia. The manures themselves are used not only by most of the principal agriculturists of the United Kingdom, but large quantities are annually shipped to the colonies, the Continent, and America, and the yearly sales now amount to close upon 50,000 tons. The stores at the Barking works are enormous, and, in addition to these, stocks are kept at all railway depots in London, and at Newport, Swansea, Cardiff, Plymouth, Bridport, Wey mouth, Bude, Southampton, Yarmouth, Hull, Exmouth, Teignmouth, Gloucester, Grimsby, Gainsboro', Stockton-on-Tees, Lynn, Cardigan, Saltney, Chester, Penzance, Douglas and Ramsey (Isle of Man), Benviek on-Tweed, Leith, Ardrossan, Grangemouth, Invergordon, Inverness, Glas gow, Aberdeen, Lossiemouth, Jersey and Guernsey, and at nearly every railway station and canal wharf in the United Kingdom ; also at Belfast, Cork, Dundalk, Derry, Galway, Limerick, Wexford, Westport, and Water ford. Agents are established in each of these towns, as also elsewhere ; and the head office for Ireland is at 22, Eden Quay, Dublin. The ad ministration of the affairs of this distinguished and widely influential house is of the most capable and vigorous character ; indeed, it could hardly be otherwise in such thoroughly efficient and experienced hands as those of Mr. Elborough, the general manager ; Mr. J. Morgan, secre tary ; Mr. Wilson, the works superintendent ; and Mr. McAllister, the superintendent of the sulphuric acid department. That Sir John B_ Lawes has won world-wide fame and renown by the successful operation of the great concern he has founded and developed, goes without saying. That his great sen-ices to agriculturists have been amply recognised and well appreciated is evidenced iu his possession of that fame and renown, and is appropriately marked in two other notable and special ways \u2014 one, his dignity as a baronet, conferred upon him in recognition of those services ; the other, the excellent working laboratory at Harpenden Common, near to his residence, equipped at a cost of 2,000/., and pre sented to him as a testimonial from many prominent agriculturists who owed much of their success to the outcome of his labours. In fine, if there is to-day in this country a bond fide and well-developed science of agriculture (which hardly anyone will honestly deny), it is not too much to say that its practical rise, progress, present firm establishment, and bright future promise are largely, if not wholly, attributable to this emi nent baronet, and the notable concern which exists to-day as a monument to his indefatigable will and energy. Wright Bros., Original Patentees and Manufacturers of Kamptulicon, linoleum, Mats, &.e., 48, Cannon Street, E.C. \u2014 An enterprising and deservedly successful firm is that of Messrs. Wright Bros., patentees and manufacturers of kamptulicon, floor coverings, &c, whose warehouse is located as above. This business was originally established in 1843, the present firm succeeding S. Gough & Co. The manufactory is situated in Carlisle Street, Lambeth, S.E., and is equipped with the most improved machinery and appliances. Here is manufactured the kamp tulicon floor coverings, which, for beauty and originality of design, finish, and durability, are unexcelled. The kamptulicon floor cloths are largely used in private and business houses ; they possess the advantages of cleanliness, durability, and comfort, and the best evidence of its merit and popularity is its ever-increasing sale since its introduction in 1843. It is especially useful in private houses for entrance-halls, passages, and stair cases, dining aud breakfast rooms, also for nurseries, bathrooms, billiard rooms, for lining stable stalls, &c. In business houses it is the most desirable floor covering that can be found for offices, board or committee rooms, passages, stairs, &c. Messrs. Wright Bros. keep a large stock of kamptulicon, linoleum, mats, &c. at their Cannon Street warehouse. They supply the article to the members of the Eoyal Family, by whom they are largely patronised, and they also contract for the same to Her Majesty's Government. They do a large wholesale trade, extending throughout all parts ofthe country, and have always maintained the highest standard of excellence in the quality of their specialities. The members of the firm are gentlemen whose integrity and sound business principles have won for them the respect and confidence of the commercial community. G. Buck, Gasfitter, Brass Finisher, Plumber, &c, 312, Gray's Inu Boad, W.C\u2014 Gasfitting, brass finishing, aud plumbing have long occupied a most promment place in the industries ofthe metropolis. In this connection favourable mention may be made of an old-established concern like that carried on under the direction of Mr G Buck Thi* well-known business dates its origin back to 1852, but it was not' till the beginning of 18S0 that Mr. Buck took possession. The concern has always been noted for the general superiority of the work produced, and it is only fair to say that in the bauds of the present proprietor the house baa steadily maintained its reputation. There is no more representative con cern of its kind in its district, and high testimony is borne to its numerous operations. Bell-hanging and speaking-tube fitting constitutes an im portant item in the transactions of the concern, where all descriptions of sanitary and gasfitting work arc executed. Lamps are cleaned and repaired, and in every respect tbe establishment fully deserves the support it enjoys. Good material is used, and only competent workmen employed. Mr. Buck is a practical tradesman, and under his personal supervision patrons can rely on having their interests fully consulted aud guarded"], [73, "MODERN LONDON. 89 Bigg's Technical Education Appliances, Limited, 20, Bucklersbury, London, E.C. \u2014 Though the importance of technical educa tion is daily becoming more and more recognised in this country, it is only during recent years that educationalists and others have become thoroughly alive to the fact that the rapid strides of other nations in the race for commerce are in a very great measure due to tbe existence of schools of this character, thus educating their youth in the sciences and principles inseparable from a thorough knowledge of the trades in which they may elect to earn their living. Notwithstanding this apathy, however, a substantial portion of such demand as has existed has for many years past been supplied by Mr. James Bigg, whose business this company has recently been formed to take over, he acting as managing director. It is essentially of a unique character, as a glance at the company's illustrated catalogue at once shows. Eminent authorities on (as is strongly hoped and anticipated on all sides) to be closely and intimately identified with the national education, there are probably no apparatus, models, or appliances for use in connection therewith which are more thoroughly worthy of general adoption than those which have,, by the enterprising and energetic management of Bigg's Technical Appliances, Limited, been brought before the notice of both Old and New Worlds, in such manner and fashion as to secure unqualified and universal approval. M. A. Brown & Son, Alderney Dairy, High Street, Camden Town, N.W. \u2014 A firm of great antiquity is that of Messrs. M. A. Brown & Son, of the Alderney Dairy. This well-known dairy was estab lished on Shrove Tuesday, in the year 1790, by an ancestor ofthe present proprietors, Mr. Thomas Brown. At that time the now populous district of Camden Town was all open country, and the Alderney Dairy a farm of 280 acres. Gradually, as the population increased, the premise s were rebuilt and enlarged to meet the increasing demands, until, at the present moment, this is the largest dairy business in the north-west district of the metropolis. Some years ago a singular and some what untoward circumstance occurred, which, however, led to a very large development of the business, this being the outbreak of typhoid fever in this locality, in consequence of which the local authorities instituted a vigorous inquiry into the sanitary condition of tbe district. Iu this they were assisted by the firm themselves in every way,. and owing to their combined efforts, the source of mischief was dis covered, and though the firm lost heavily financially, they in no way relaxed their energies to stem the outbreak, for which they received the public thanks of the then medical officer of health, Dr. Murphy : \u2014 \" Upon Messrs. Brown, as the largest milk vendors concerned,. \" has fallen the duty of giving the greatest amount of assistance during \" the inquiry, and it is but fair to them to state that they have not \" allowed their private interest to prevent them from fully aidiDg me in \" my efforts to discover the cause of a calamity for which no blame can \" attach to them.\" It was then that the spirited proprietors of this establishment organised the now perfect system of sanitary arrange ments which prevail throughout the whole of their premises, both in town and country. The excellent example set by Messrs. Brown be came the model for similar arrangements in other dairies, and greatly increased their own popularity aud extended their business. These arrangements receive the closest attention ; each month every person employed upon the establishment, from the proprietors downward, are subjected to a medical examination. In the aggregate, Messrs. Brown have over four hundred cows in full milk ; these are kept in. the country, and the milk, perfectly cooled, comes up by rail twice a day. This firm makes a speciality of nursery milk, which is specially supplied to nurseries and invalids, and forms a very important department of the business, and to insure its high quality, none but the milk from cows selected with great care, and fed expressly to produce milk especially suitable for building up the fabric of the infantile population and for invalids, is devoted to this purpose. Order, regularity, and cleanli ness are the presiding geniuses of this establishment, and to insure the expeditious and regular delivery of the milk, avast number of vans aud horses, with suitable staff, are constantly employed. There are few greater blessings to all classes of society than a regular supply of pure milk, and the appreciation of that supplied by Messrs. Brown is strongly testified by the ever-increasing demands upon the resources of the establishment, which has come to be looked upon more as an indis pensable institution than a private enterprise. educational matters, including the Bt. Hon. Sir Lyon Playfair, K.C.B., M.P., F.B.S., Sir John Lubbock, Bart., M.P., F.E.S., and distinguished members of the Royal Commission on Technical Education, have expressed their approval of the steps which have been taken to bring Mr. Rigg's apparatus still more prominently into notice, and, under their propitious auspices, thus influencing its career. Hitherto intending purchasers from the many varieties of apparatus comprised in the company's catalogue have been unable to see it, consequent on the business being conducted in the country. One ofthe main objects in the formation of this company has been to establish the collection at 20, Bucklersbury, both for the exhibition of that which had hitherto been manufactured by Mr. Bigg, as well as the collection in one central establishment in London of all the requirements of a technical education, irrespective of the particular manufacturer. This object the company is prosecuting with marked encouragement and success, and it is reasonably expected that the public recognition of the necessity for such an establishment will continue to promote its development. The company is now prepared to execute orders for all kinds of apparatus and appliances in the many subjects in science and technology, as arranged by the Science and Art Depart ment and by the City and Guilds of London Institute. The bulk of the apparatus in the catalogue has been recognised and adopted by Govern ment as suitable for science schools, aid under certain forms being granted in its purchase. Numerous foreign, including those of the United States and Japan, as well as the Indian and various colonial, governments are purchasers of the company's manufactures, which, among others, include many illustrations for instruction in applied as well as theoretical mechanics, made to correspond with such standard works as Sir Robert Ball's \"Experimental Mechanics,\" Willis'\" Principles of Mechanism,\" and others, the catalogue reference numbers of the apparatus being those of the figs, in the books illustrated. Many models in machine construction are supplied, and are based on Unwin's \" Machine Design \"; also many finished examples of bridge and ship construction, locomotive and other steam engines, with others far too numerous to mention within the limits of our space. Iu this extension of the business the company has added the sale of diagrams, books, tools, and appliances for manual training schools, school furniture, and, indeed, every requisite necessary in fitting up schools and colleges of this character, and we predict for them a long aud prosperous future. The above illustration is one of many in the company's catalogue, illustrating applied mechanics in a jib crane, from Sir Eobert Ball's work already referred to, the whole of the parts being mentioned in detail, with separate prices. This apparatus was designed by the late Professor Willis, M.A., E.E.S., &c, and from it, bridges, clocks, and many varieties of machines may be constructed. The apparatus, to the manufacture and perfecting of which the entire energies of this well-organised concern are now devoted, possess a brilliant exhibition record, having gained eminent honours throughout the world. Among these may be mentioned\u2014 First Degree of Merit for Educational Apparatus, Sydney, 1879; Gold Medal for Technical Education Ap paratus, Health Exhibition, London, 1884; Diploma of Honour for Models' for Teaching Mechanic Arts, New Orleans, 1884-85; Silver Medal for Models of Machine Construction, Inventions Exhibition, London 1885. And, in short, if technical instruction is henceforward Fowler & Figgin, Hosiers, Glovers, Shirtmakers, and Outfitters, 409 and 157a, Mare Street, Hackney. \u2014 A trade of considerable magnitude iu London, and one that employs numerous establishments, is that of hosiery, glove, shirtmakiDg, and colonial outfitting, and it is in able and experienced hands. A very respectable, old-established firm in this line is that of Messrs. Fowler & Biggin, of 409 and 157a, Mare Street, Hackney, which for many years has enjoyed great prosperity. The shop is spacious, of very attractive appearance, and is elegantly fitted up for stock accommodation and display and for the convenience of the patrons, and the windows are tastefully decorated with choice goods. The stock is large and comprehensive, consisting of hosiery, gloves, shirts, collars, ties, and outfitting articles of every description, including those suitable for the colonies. Another important department of the business is that of sanitary woollen hosiery and underwear, manufactured exclusively from pure undyed wool, the large assortment which is displayed proving the great demand they have for these particular goods.

The firm have factories near Blackburn (these being known as Eishton Mills), and also the Whiteash Mills at Church, near Aecriugton. Both of these establishments cover very large ground areas, and in every department are admirably fitted with all the most modern and latest improvements in special machinery. An enormous number of hands are employed in the various departments, the work being conducted under careful supervision in every branch. Messrs. Peebles & Son manufacture the best classes of paper only. These are mostly- of the varieties known as \" News,\" \" Printings,\" \" Plate,\" \" Chart,\" and writing papers gene rally, also highly glazed papers for what is known as dry printing. In every branch they have gained very great renown for the excellent quality of their products. Their succes's is evidenced in the large and influential connection that is maintained in all parts of the United Kingdom and colonies. Amongst the firms supplied regularly are the Times, Illustrated London News, Graphic, Sporting and Dramatic News, Field, Aforning Post, Standard, Melbourne Argus, and all the other leading newspapers and publishers. The premises occupied, so far as London is concerned, consist only of a suite of offices, with sample-rooms, Sec, fitted iu a very handsome manner. An efficient staff of clerks, &c. is engaged, but all orders are executed direct from the mills. The trade is that of the wholesale department solely, and the connection extends to all parts of the metropolis, and throughout the provinces and colonies. In the branches of the trade to which the firm devote their special attention they are the leading mauufacturers, aud their productions have acquired an unsurpassed reputation wherever they have been introduced. John Kirkaidy & Son, Paint Manufacturers, Oil Mer chants, Manufacturers of Anti-Fouling Composition, Garford Street, West India Dock Road, E. \u2014 This old and noted house was founded as far back as the year 1809, and has been under the control of the Kirkaidy family from the first. A member of that family continues at the present day to direct its affairs, and the business, which is more than three-quarters of a century old, enjoys a very marked degree of prosperity under his administration. Messrs. Kirkaidy conduct a most extensive industry in the preparation of all kinds of paints for marine and general use. Their specialities for renovating the painted parts of ships, and for the general decoration of vessels, have a very large sale, and are held in high estimation in nautical circles ; and Kirkaldy's Patent Anti-Fouling Composition for iron and steel steam aud sailing vessels is a notable production \u2014 one of the oldest established and best articles of the kind in the market. Its success has continuously increased, and no composition of the same order enjoys a higher or more fully deserved favour. As oil merchants Messrs. Kirkaidy hold a position of much prominence, and in this department they have given considerable attention to the refining of high-class engine and cylinder oils, meeting with marked success in the same. Their oils are widely appreciated by engineers for smoothness, purity, and excellent lubricating quality, and they have a large sale both at home and abroad. Messrs. John Kirkaidy & Son occupy extensive and most commodious warehouse and factory premises in Garford Street, where they have every facility for the manufac ture, storage, and loading and unloading of goods. The stocks held here are invariably- of great volume and comprehensiveness, and in perfect coudition for despatch to any part of the world. The firm, who employ a numerous staff of hands, have important branches at the Tilbury Docks and the Royal Albert Dock. The trade controlled is very large, and is being vigorously developed in all directions, and notably in the export department, to which careful attention is devoted. Messrs. Kirkaidy maintain valuable home connections among shipwrights, shipowners, ship builders, and the leading shipping companies ; and all the affairs of their house are directed in a manner which practically ensures the preservation of the firm's eminent prestige and status in the commercial world. Harry Townend & Co., Manufacturers' Agents, 51, 52, and 53, Milton Street, E.C. \u2014 Few firms have developed such a large trade in a comparatively short space of time as Messrs. Harry Townend & Co. The business was originally founded about seven or eight years ago, and is already one of the most important among manufacturers' agents in the City. Their premises consist of very fine showrooms and warehouses on the ground floor of a large building at the foregoing location. In addition the firm occupy the basement, using it as store rooms, packing-rooms, &c. The proprietors have devoted special attention to the arrangement and fitting of the premises, which are in every respect commodious aud suitable. The trade extends to many different branches of what are known as soft goods, though a particularly special feature is made of buttons and trimmings, of which the firm are large importers. The manufacture of this class of goods is carried on largely in various Contineutal centres, and Messrs. Townend & Co., in making their selection of goods, have been careful to trade only with those firms whose goods are of the best make. The proprietors act as agents for the important Not tingham firm of M. Jacoby & Co., renowned lace manufacturers, whose goods command a ready sale all over the world. They represent Messrs. Born & Joachim, of Berlin, extensive manufacturers of wool shawls and ladies' fancy jerseys in all the latest fashions ; also Lane, Lambie, & Cain, of Luton, for straw hats and bonnets ; and Harris Markus, of Fleet wood, for waterproofs of all descriptions. Cotton laces, Valenciennes, Spanish, Maltese, and other varieties are included in the trade in connec tion with this firm. Messrs. Townend keep a very large and valuable stock in every branch of tbe business in which they are engaged. The premises are kept in excelleut order, and throughout the whole of the esta blishment may be traced the results of the able management under which this firm is conducted. The trade extends to all parts of the world, a large connection being maintained in both the home and export departments. Lemin & Wales, Toilet Specialists, &c, 413, Mare Street, Hackney, E. \u2014 Standing on the classic ground on which formerly stood tbe residence of the great philanthropist, John Howard, are the handsome premises of Messrs. Lemin & Wales, the well-known perfumers and toilet specialists. The premises are large and commodious, several rooms being devoted to the various branches of their manufactures. In their labora tory and workshops may be seen the most curious and interesting evolutions anel developments. When one sees, for instance, tresses of swarthy hair change, as if by magic, to rippling gold \u2014 dull, drabby shades instantly charged with warm, bright colour \u2014 and, above all, when one sees every particle of colour taken from dark hair, leaving it white as newly-fallen snow, and is assured that the ingredients used will not stain the most delicate fabric, and are so harmless that they may be used to wash the head of an infant \u2014 when one sees and remembers this, one cannot withhold one's wonder at the potency of this branch of science. This, however, is but one branch of the peculiar industry- which is carried on by Messrs. Lemin & Wales. A very interesting and amusing chapter might be written on other branches, which, to say the least, reveal a mystery not dreamt of in our philosophy. Our space will only permit us to say that the establishment is presided over by Mr. Lander Lemin, whose writings and inventions are well-known in the industrial and commercial world ; that he is assisted by a most able staff of assistants, and that his advice may be obtained, personally or by letter, on all matters connected with the management and culture of the hair. The specialities manufactured for the hair and skin, by the firm, may be obtained through the principal wholesale houses ot' London and our large towns, or direct from their establishment at 413, Mare Street, Hackney. Among the most famous of these preparations may be mentioned \" Electroline,\" \" Scurf Eradicator,\" \" Botanic Water,\" \" Hair Bestorative,\" \" Toilet Gem,\" \" Hair Bestorer,\" \" Rose Milk,\" \" Brilliantine,\" \" Golden Water,\" \" Instantaneous Hair Dye,\" \" Bosaline,\" \" Wiederbringer,\" &c, &c, &c. \" I have a great \" aversion to the publication of testimonials,\" said Mr. Lemin, \" but we \" could publish many volumes of them if we liked. Here are thousands of \" letters from all parts of the world, which speak for themselves. We are \" grateful for all such expressions of satisfaction, but we do not expose \" them to the gaze of the multitude. Our faith is in the intrinsic value of \" our preparations. Our success lies in the fact that each speciality is what \" it pretends to be, aud therefore an advertisement in itself. That, together \" with tbe fact that we have ever regarded ' Shoddy ' as a great commercial \" fiend, to be avoided by every honest man, explains our position to-day. \" Of that position we have no reason to complain.\" F. Pilkington & Co., Iron, Steel, and Hardware Mer chants, 41, Bedhill Street, Cumberland Market, N.W. \u2014 Among the staple industries of this country, the iron, steel, aud hardware trade are prominent, and the well-known house conducted by Messrs. Pilkington & Co., which was established about thirty years agor is a typical representa tive in the line. The premises utilised for the purposes of the business comprise a spacious and well-fixtured warehouse on the ground floor, with an excellent street frontage, and known as \" The Begent Iron Ware house.\" The business carried on is of a large and comprehensive nature, including cut and wrought nails, register stoves, ranges, kitcheners, rain water goods, sash weights, &c, together with all descriptions of boiler plates, sheets, furnace bars, vices, anvils, and all kinds of constructional iron work, as rolled iron joists, girders, &c. Cast and wrought iron work of all descriptions, as required, are supplied at a day's notice. The firm arc well known in the district, and bear a very high reputation for the general superiority of their work in all branches of the business. The firm have recently secured a patent for \\rhat promises to be a very valuable method of fire-proofing model dwellings, mansions built on the \" flats \" system, and buildings generally; also the much talked of necessity of protecting east-iron columns and main girders from the effects of fire and water. The house has a very valuable connection among the leading firms in the building trade and houses in the steel and hardware lines, as well as amongst large contracting firms for constructional iron work. The head of lhe firm, Mr. Francis Pilkington, is well known for his intimate knowledge of all branches of this industry, and highly re spected by his numerous patrons for his prompt execution of all orders entrusted to the firm. A. M. Peebles & Son, Paper Manufacturers, 153, Queen Victoria Street, E.C. \u2014 Among the largest and most renowned houses in the paper making branch of industry a prominent position must be assigned to that carried on by Messrs. A. M. Peebles & Son, whose busi ness is widely known throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. The business was originally founded about fifty years ago, and is carried on, =o far as the productive part of the work is concerned, in Lancashire."], [75, "MODERN LONDON. 91 Charles Wix & Sons, Oil and Italian Warehousemen, Jam and Jelly Manufacturers, 3, Mitre Street, Aldgate, E.C. \u2014 There are few London firms better known or more worthily holding a high position than that of Messrs. Charles Wix & Sons. This eminent house of oil and Italian warehousemen, jam, jelly, tart fruit, pickle aud sauce manu facturers was sounded as far back as 1799, aud its extensive business was for many years carried on with marked and continuous success in Leaden hall Street. The affairs of tbe house are now in the hands of Messrs. W. Copland and W. B. Mack, who ably uphold the long-established reputation of the concern, retaining the old title under which the business has for nearly ninety years been conducted. Messrs. Charles Wix & Sons are merchants and manufacturers in all requisites for oil and Italian ware housemen, and the several lines more particularly specified above con stitute the leading features of the important industrial section of their undertakings. As manufacturers of jams, jellies, bottled fruits, pickles, sauces, and other condiments their reputation stands deservedly high, and their name is associated with a number of superior preparations in these lines that have achieved widespread and well-merited popularity. Large works, affording employment to a very numerous force' of hands, are de voted to this branch of the business in Cornwall road, Lambeth, S.E. The premises in Mitre Street comprise offices and warehouse. The buildings contain four spacious and lofty floors, with a large basement, and have a frontage of 30 feet by a depth of 100 feet, containing a complete stock of the manufactured goods for which the house itself has become so widely famous. The trade controlled is one of much magnitude and importance, and of a wholesale home character, but a valuable and influential export connection also exists, and is being steadily and successfully extended iu various directions. The business, under the guidance of its present capable proprietary, pursues a course of characteristic prosperity, and is conducted upon principles of sound mercantile good faith and integrity. consequently know practically nothing of the locality, its resources, its activity, and its people, have a great revelation in store for them should they ever personally visit this wondrous productive region, with its remarkable industrial energy, and its scores of illustrations of strong commercial spirit and enterprise. Iu that revelation there will be no more telling factor than the large community of fine retail business establishments, prominent among which is that of Messrs. Vesper & Corner, the well-known cabinet makers and house furnishers of Commercial Boad, E. The history of this notable firm dates back over a term of more than sixty years, and it is at once one of the oldest and largest con- cerns of its kind iu the district. Within Messrs. Vesper & Corner's spacious establishment there are exemplified some of our best and highest attainments in the difficult and elaborate art of modern house equipment, and this firm show some classes of superior goods which are quite unsur- passed iu grace and beauty of design, perfect taste, and exquisite finish by any similar articles to be seen in London showrooms. Messrs. Vesper & Corner engage in every branch of artistic and utilitarian cabinet making, upholstery, &c, and are complete house furnishers, undertaking the full equipment of a residence of any size or style with everything requisite to comfort or elegance, or both combined. The departments represented in the firm's warehouses comprise, as principal features, furniture of all kinds, bedsteads and bedding, blankets, quilts, &c, carpets, curtains, linoleums, table linen, table cutlery, furnishing iron- mongery of every description, electro-plate in rich variety, and a fine assortment of china and glass by the best makers. In each of these sections a stock is held which it would be extremely difficult to surpass in any matter of volume, comprehensiveness, careful selection, or the excellent quality of its component items. The furniture, carpet, curtain, and linoleum departments are especially praiseworthy, aud the whole establishment is simply a perfect emporium for the supply of all requisites of appointment fordrawingordining room, hall or library, bedroom, breakfast-room, parlour, or kitchen. The firm specialise the designing of furniture and furnishings, and undertake the complete equipment of a mansion, villa, or other resi- dence in such a manner that perfect harmony in all points \u2014 which is the absolute essential of correct modern house furnishing \u2014 shall be properly- secured and preserved. The most fastidious customer will not fail to meet with satisfaction here, for Messrs. Vesper & Corner accomplish as much as is possible of achievement, in that they show the best producible articles in all departments. The reconciliation of moderate price with excellent quality is notable and perfect at this firm's headquarters, and goods of the most reliable character are stocked in ample variety to meet the requirements of all means and inclinations. Messrs. Vesper & Corner conduct a business the comprehensiveness of which places it beyond the power of this sketch to fully describe. Let it then suffice to say that there is no undertaking that has become associated with the trade of the first class aud complete house furnisher, cabinet manufacturer, and removal contractor which does not come within the scope of their operations ; and in all transactions there are strongly manifested those methods of honour and conscientious integrity which have won for this old-established house the high position aud marked success it now enjoys. Messrs. Vesper & Corner maintain widespread and valuable connections iu town and country, and have the continuous support of a large and influential patronage. Their two warehouses in Commercial Boad are very extensive, and though the exteriors of the premises may not at once convey this impression, their fine interior dimensions aud proportions, perfect arrangement and magnificent stocks, entitle them to classification among the most noteworthy and attractive establishments of their kind in the metropolis. Edwards & Williams, Bookbinders' Block, Roll, and Tool Cutters, -&.C., Cripplegate Works, 27, Jewin Street, E.C. \u2014 One of the most eminent London houses iu its line is that of Messrs. Edwards & Williams, which was established by the present firm members in 1851. The factory and warehouse are well fixtured and appointed throughout. The working plant and machinery employed are of the most modern construc tion. The industrial operations of the firm are very extensive, and comprise the manufacture of all kinds of bookbinders' requisites, endorsing presses and stamps ; the engraving of shirt and collar stamps ; door, window, and stencil plates, and all kinds of copperplate engraving. They also manu facture all descriptions of endorsing, rubber, and marking inks ; endorsing boxes, pads, &e. The great speciality, however, for which the house is highly celebrated, is the production of the Improved Hand Self -inking and Self-acting Numerator, of which the firm are the original inventors and sole manufacturers. This ingeniously-constructed machine is capable of paging consecutively and duplicating with the greatest accuracy and neat ness. It is strongly made in gun-metal frames, handsome in appearance, and reliable in action. A full staff are employed, and the business carried on with push and energy, the establishment being at all times tbe scene of bustling industrial activity in all the departments. The trade is world wide, the firm supplying their goods to almost every branch of trade both at home and abroad. The partners are highly respected by their patrons for their courtesy and expeditious execution of all orders eon fided to their world-famed establishment. J. IT. Selman, Tailor and Outfitter, 26, Moorgate Street, E.C. \u2014 Few tailoring firms in the City have a higher reputation than Mr. J. N. Selman, whose business premises afe located at the above address. This important business was established half a century ago by the late J. Salis bury, and Mr. Selman, during the eleven years of his proprietorship, has not only maintained, but has considerably enhanced, the reputation which is attached to the concern. As a practical tailor, Mr. Selman has been eminently qualified to conduct such a business successfully, and by the dis play of energy and enterprise he has made it one of considerable note. A carefully -selected stockof new goods is always on hand, and the specialities in Scotch Cheviot and tweed suits from 50s. upwards, and evening suits and other garments, give great satisfaction. To facilitate ordering, Mr. Selman gives patterns, with prices, and self-measurement forms free on application. The connection includes many leading bankers, banking officials, merchants, stockbrokers, and gentlemen resident in all parts of London. F^irst-class workmen are employed, and the proprietor, who comes of an old family of eminent tailors, occupies a decidedly high position in the trade. R. Stapleton & Co., Stam;; Collectors, 36, Gresham Street, E.C. \u2014 The collection and arrangement of foreign stamps is one of those interesting studies which afford very pleasant recreation, and which at the same time calls into active requisition the services of those who are in a position to assist philatelists by establishing what may be termed storehouses of choice and rare products of foreign countries. Such a firm is that of Messrs. B. Stapleton & Co., at No. 36, Gresham Street, City, E.C., aud which offers to collectors most valuable advantages in this direction. They have on band one of the largest stocks of used and unused foreign and colonial stamps, and have sheets from ll. to 100/. in value, which they send out on approval on receipt of suitable references. Their stock also includes some of the very rarest stamps known to the philatelic world, and, in fact, the collection of these is one of the chief specialities of the firm, their list containing particulars of stamps without which no collection can be considered complete. Stamps are sold in large or small quantities to suit all classes of the community, and collections of all sizes are purchased on favourable terms. Messrs. Stapleton have numerous correspondents in the colonies and abroad, who give them early intimation of new issues and provisional stamps, and they are thus placed in a position to be of the greatest possible use to collectors. The firm has already a very large London and provincial connection, and sends its goods to all parts of the world. In the hands of these capable and experienced gentlemen the business is capable of inde finite extension, and will no doubt prove a most successful and prosperous undertaking. Vesper & Corner, Artistic Cabinet Makers, Uphol sterers, E-'ouse Furnishers, Removing Contractors, &c, 423, 425, and 451, Commercial Road, E. \u2014 Those persons who know the east of London only through the vague medium of hearsay, who have drawn imaginary and perhaps unfavourable pictures of the district, and who"], [76, "92 MODERN LONDON. industry carried on in London, and one which gives employment to thousands of hands, is the cabinet manufacturing. A well-known house in this trade is that of Mr. E. T. Cairns, which was founded ten years ago. The factory is spacious, and is completely fitted up with every appliance for the business carried on. A good force of experienced hands is em ployed in manufacturing dining, drawing, bedroom, library, and other suites; tables, sideboards, bookcases, and every description of house furniture. Mr. B. T. Cairns manufactures only superior goods, and the materials are carefully selected and tested before being used. The designs of Mr. R. T. Cairns' productions are of great artistic merit, llr. B. T. Cairns carries on a very heavy wholesale trade. He manages with energy and ability. He bears a name which is respected in the trade and the general industrial world, and his status therein is high and well-defined. Henry Bourn, Metal Trades Valuer, Auctioneer and Accountant, 182, Upper Thames Street, E.C. \u2014 With the advance of commerce, the multiplication of trades and the division of labour, there is abundant opportunity afforded to individuals to find that vocation for which they are best adapted, and in which, when found, they are able to exercise whatever ability they possess. In some cases men have spent half their lives in professions for which they have been totally unfitted, and in which they would never have made any headway, consequent upon their tastes and inclinations being in an entirely different direction. But when an individual has found the sphere in which he is best fitted to act, and applies himself thoroughly to master the details of his business or profession, as the case may be, it is most probable that his efforts will not go unnoticed, and that eventually he will reap that reward which his diligence merits. A notable instance in which a gentleman eminently adapted in every way- for his particular profession may be cited is the case of Mr. Henry Bourn, metal trades valuer, auctioneer and accountant, of 182, Upper Thames Street, E.C. It was somewhere about the year 1867 that Mr. Bourn commenced business on his own account at No. 8, Paternoster Bow. Like the majority of beginners, he bad great difficul- ties to contend with before his abilities were recognised. But gradually one client recommended another, until his business grew to be a very extensive one, and at the present time he stands in the foremost ranks of his profession. His business is entirely with the metal trades, which include iron and brass founders and merchants, ironmongers, as well as manufacturers of and dealers in metal goods. Mr. Bourn conducts auctions, valuations, and audits all over England, and has a large bank- ruptcy practice, in connection with which he has been appointed trustee in a large number of cases, many- of which be has successfully wound up, and others are still receiving his attention. Valuations in the trades with which Mr. Bourn is associated can only be conducted by those who are thoroughly conversant with their details, and in this particular branch he has met with exceptional success. Auctions are conducted and sales effected by private contract with equal success, but it is as an arbitrator and referee that he is so widely known, having acted in this latter capacity in the transferring of several very large concerns. In all directions Mr. Henry Bourn has proved himself to be an authoritative and leading member of his profession, and it is mainly owing to the exercise of his undoubted ability, perseverance, and integrity that he has gained the respect of all he has come in contact with. Samuel Hunt, Timber, Deal, and Mahogany Merchant, 100, Pritchards Boad, Hackney Boad, E.\u2014 The metropolitan trade in timber is one of the first importance and of enormous extent, and of yearly increasing value. An influential factor in this connection is the widely-known business carried on under the able control and proprietor ship of Mr. George Edward Hunt, at 100, Pritchards Road, Hackney Road, E., and which was founded over half a century ago. 'The premises are very extensive, suitably fitted and arranged in the most complete aud effective manner. They are divided into different departments, according to the class of timber and to the state of preparation for use in which they are to be put on the market. The machinery used is of the most modern and perfect labour-saving kind. The operations of the house cover the whole field of the timber trade. Deal and mahogany are, however, the principal features, and the transactions in these lines are of a valuable and rapidly-growing character. Oak post plank sills, oak fencino*, dry white and yellow deals, pine planks, battens, yellow floor boards', matched boards, deals, planks, and many useful furniture woods, such as walnut, mahogany, oak, &c. ; wheelwrights' timber, scaffold poles, plasterers' laths, &c. are special branches of the business, in which a lar<?e trade is done with a connection which extends to a radius of many miles from the establishment. The finest doors and mouldings are im ported from Sweden and America, and sold at prices that no house in the same line can surpass for moderation. These doors range in price from 6s. Id. for the inside four-panelled, to 20s. for the 2 in. thick 2 feet 10 in. by 6 feet 10 in. front doors for glass, with bolection moulding, with a discount. Mahogany is stocked in large quantities and in all thicknesses. Parties can also have their timber cut to any size. Every sort of mould ing is kept in stock ; indeed, Mr. Hunt's timber yard is one of the most extensive and complete to be seen in East London. Builders and cabinet makers' requisites are held in great variety. An extensive trade is carried on, and this desirable result is the natural consequence ofthe proprietor's energy and ability, which enable him to have a keen and due appreciation of public requirements, and help him to keep abreast of the times by promptly supplying them. The business is conducted on the best lines. and Mr. Hunt spares no effort to maintain tbe old-time repute of au establishment which can lay just claim to being one of the most repre sentative of its class iu the country. Crawford & Co., Patent Improved Carbon Enamel, 27 1, Wellclose Square, E. \u2014 The tendency of casks to become foul is of course a well-known fact, and to such an extent is this the case that the trade have dignified the worst casks with the name of \" stinkers.\" Now under ordinary circumstances the difficulty of even partly purifying one of these casks is very considerable. It would seem, upon the face of the circumstances, that a good enamel must certainly tend to keep casks clean and wholesome, and ensure their perfectly satisfactory condition. Nothing was entirely successful till the introduction of Messrs. Crawford & Co.'s Patent Improved Carbon Enamel. The idea probably emanated with Messrs. Colin P. Matthews & Co., but it was greatly- improved upon by Messrs. Crawford, who purchased the business. There are a great many advantages attaching to the use of this preparation that must strongly recommend it to all brewers, vinegar makers, mineral-water manufac turers, &c. It is easily applied, requiring nothing but ordinary labour and an ordinary amouut of common sense and care ; of course it must be properly applied, and one of the chief points is that the cask must be perfectly dry. it is then suspended over an ordinary spirit draught or a coke stove for a few minutes, aud while warm it is painted ivith a thin coating of the enamel, which is a thick black liquid. This is set fire to ; when the flames have disappeared the enamel will be found to have penetrated and become absorbed in tbe wood, forming a hard, smooth surface that is dry and perfectly impermeable. It may be noticed that the enamel is, so to speak, in the wood, and not merely upon it. The whole process only occupies a few minutes, and the cask is at once ready for immediate use. With new casks there are these advantages \u2014 once enamelled they keep pure and wholesome for at least two years, and a second coating can then be applied at a trifling cost. Great economy is effected by reason of all up-filliug being entirely dispensed with. Ordinary casks when new, if not enamelled, absorb a considerable quantity of the ale, &c, necessitating their being filled up. But where the cask has been enamelled this is unnecessary. Enamelled casks last longer than ordinary ones, the process preserving the wood. The reliability of this enamel is proved by the mere fact that it will resist the action of acetic acid, and thusis useful in other trades besides brewing. Its value for old casks is simply- indisputable. A good far-gone \" stinker \" will take a tremendous amount of firing, scraping, or steaming, and it is veiy questionable whether the result is over and above satisfactory. By Messrs. Crawford's process purity is ensured in a few minutes. The firm are now doing a very large trade, and their patent enamel is in great demand, not only through out the United Kingdom but also abroad. Mason & Co., Builders, Warehouse and Office Fitters', &.c, 19, Barbican, and Compton Street, Goswell Boad, E.C. \u2014 Amongst the many large and influential business establishments situated in the heart of the metropolis is the well-known firm of Messrs. Mason & Co., of 19, Barbican, E.C., and Compton Street, Goswell Boad, builders, warehouse and office fitters, plumbers, gasfitters, and decorators. For years this firm has been most extensively engaged in this business, and has carried out successfully many large and important contracts for the decora tion and fitting of some of the largest warehouses and offices, both public aud private, in the metropolis. A special feature of this business, and one in which Messrs. Mason & Co. have gained a very high reputation, is the undertaking of sanitary work of every description, and in this branch of business the firm keeps in constant employment a very large staff of experienced workmen. They also do a very large business as plumbers, gasfitters, and decorators, and have a first-class connection amongst the leading City companies and other large establishments. The firm consists of Mr. Jonathan Mason and Mr. Joseph Mason ; the former gentleman, it may be mentioned, is a registered member of the Plumbers^Company, both being thoroughly practical men and well known and respected in the trade. The business is conducted on sound commercial principles, each department receiving the strict personal supervision of the proprietors, and is conducted with characteristic ability, energy, and enterprise. Messrs. Mason & Co. are also the agents for the Plate Glass Insurance Company, as well as the principal fire and life offices, and also keep open a register ofthe best properties to be let in this neighbourhood, which is well patronised by many large estate and property holders. Messrs. Mason & Co. hold a very high position in business circles in the City, and, from the extent and importance of their operations, rank with the largest and most influential establishments engaged in this business itt the City of London. B. T. Cairns, Cabinet Manufacturer, 23a, Well Street, Mare Street, Hackney, E. \u2014 One of the most important branches of"], [77, "MODERN LONDON. 93 G. Venables & Co.'s Pianoforte Show rooms, 187 and 189, Essex Boad, aud 2 and 4, Canonbury Boad, Islington, N. \u2014 There is no name so widely know n in the pianoforte trade iii the north of London \u25a0as that of \" Venables.\" The business has been in existence since 1830, more than half a century ago, bringing us back to a period when the names of pianoforte manufacturers could have been counted on one's \u25a0fingers. The late Mr. Charles Venables, who was the founder of the business, was au employe of the then well-known firm of Stodart & Co., in whose service, and that of other high-class firms, he gained valuable experience, which he afterwards turned to such excellent account ; the fact of his having always been accustomed to good workmanship may, no doubt, be the secret of the sterling character of the work always to be found in a \" Venables \" piano, no matter of what class. Wonderful progress has been made by the firm siuce the death of the founder, the business having made rapid strides, until the name is now known far and wide. Messrs. Venables' establishment is one of the largest aud best stocked of the kind in London. Their extensive showrooms contain one of the finest displays of pianofortes to be met with in the metropolis, embracing pianos of all designs aud prices, from the uupretending pianette to the more imposing grand. One very important feature in the pianos supplied by this firm is the thoroughly substantial character of the lower _^^^^^ \u2014 _^. classes, which, although not so which they still have, at 20 and 21, Little Britain. They have also a branch at Elthorne and Sunnyside Boads, Hornsey Rise. They thus command a very extensive trade, and have achieved a great amount of success in the manufacture of all descriptions of trunks, chests, boxes, packing cases, &c. The firm devote special attention to two branches. One of these is the construction of packing cases, in which the firm are certainly unsurpassed for excellence of material and con struction. Another important feature of the business will be thoroughly understood by the term of \" undertaking,\" in which the firm have gained a great reputation. Messrs. Illman employ a large staff. A large and wide spread connection is maintained throughout London and the provinces. Mr. Illman, senr., the principal partner, is a gentleman highly respected and of great influence in the City. He was churchwarden and overseer of the parish of St. Mary Staining, and has been one of the guardians of the poor for more than sixteen years. At the present time he is also churchwarden and overseer again of St. Mary Staining ; was churchwarden and overseer of St. Botolph, Aldersgate, about fourteen years ago, and was presented with a service of plate to the amount of about 80/. Aug. Brehmer, Patent Book Stitching Machines, 33 and 35, Moor Lane, E.C., and at Paris aud Vienna. \u2014 One of the most notable of metropolitan industrial concerns is that controlled by Mr. Aug. Brehmer, whose British works and commercial head-quarters are as above. This importaut house was founded in London in 1870. Mr. Brehmer's manufactures in book sewing and stitching machines, all of which are of his own invention and improvement, are fully and creditably meeting all requirements in point of constructive merit and operative efficacy. The premises occupied at Moor Lane are of very considerable extent, and in addition to this London establishment, works covering a great area of ground, and employing a very large number of hands, are controlled at Leipzig, and a flourishing branch is vigorously and successfully conducted at Philadelphia, U.S.A. The Moor Lane showrooms are very spacious, commodious, and admirably laid out, and here a singularly complete aud interesting display is made of the various mechanical productions with which the name of the house has become so creditably identified. Every description of wire and thread sewing and stitching apparatus is shown, together with a number of other mechanical appliances of high utility for book-binding and book-making purposes. Space forbids the mention in detail of the many classes of machines placed on view in this exhaustive and attractive exhibit ; but among a host of noteworthy features perhaps the most prominent are the following : \u2014 The Patent Wire Stitching and Binding Machine, for hand or treadle power (1); the Patent Automatic Wire Stitching and Binding Machine, for steam or treadle power (4) ; the Patent Hand Wire Stitching Machine (5) ; the Patent Automatic Wire Stitching Machine, for treadle power (6) ; the Patent Automatic Wire Stitching Machines, for hand or treadle power (7 and 8) ; the Patent Wire Book Sewing Machine, for various classes of book work, including pamphlets, account books, and letterpress volumes ; the Patent Thread Book Sewing Machine, for sewing letterpress work in varying sizes and of any thickness ; and the Patent Book Bounding Machine, for rounding the backs of volumes. Each of these apparatuses is characterised by many points of peculiar excellence and capacity. The firm's manufactures have obtained many exhibition honours, which include a silver medal at the Inventions Exhibition, 1885 ; a gold medal, Liverpool, 1886 ; and a gold medal, Antwerp, 1885. The firm have lately introduced their Patent Wire Stitched Folding Boxes, which are remarkable for their economy, strength, neatness, and saving of space and shipping expenses. They are invaluable for a variety of purposes, and, indeed, to all packers and exporters. Mr. Brehmer's business is personally conducted with marked ability and enter prise, and a very large and valuably connected manufacturers' supply trade is controlled, its operations extending to all quarters of the globe. elaborate in external appear ance, nor perhaps so powerful in tone as the higher priced instruments, are nevertheless equally reliable as regards their lasting qualities. While bringing out a piano that should, so far as possible, come within the reach of all as regards price, Messrs. Vena bles have always been careful to avoid going to extremes in ihis matter, aud producing an instrument that should in any way damage their reputation. In looking through the showrooms we were particularly struck by the artistic taste displayed and the great variety of designs in the cases of the pianos ; the old-fashioned silk and fret fronts appear to be quite things of the past, in place of which we found ourselves confronted with panels of choice marquetterie work, others of embossed work on dull grouud, the flowers of which were taste fully relieved with gold, and exquisite designs in hand-painted panels. A great impetus was given to the business of the firm by the introduction of the \" Three Years Purchase System,\" of which Messrs. Venables were among the earliest pioneers. Like others in the trade, Messrs. Venables have adopted iron frames in most of their pianos, which has greatly [9 (IKrTzzSMir- ' ' increased the strength and dura- 1 j]HI|3\u00a33m| S55&?fil\u00a7Slli|\u00abH bility of the instruments, as well -IHgSj; \u00c6^\u00b0\u2122^ffl||EB8li as improved their tone.

Another important improvement was introduced in cabin pianos, by which the hammers are waterproofed so as to piotect them from the absorption of \u25a0moisture from the atmosphere, a danger likely to occur at sea or in tropical climates, which hardens the felt and injures the toue. It being necessary to leave the frout part of the hammers untouched by the pre paration, a concave transverse bar is provided which falls automatically -when the key frame is closed, thereby effectually protecting the exposed part of the hammers when the instrument is not in use. The firm have also a special way of securing the panels of pianos by means of a bevelled screw, which prevents that unpleasant buzz so frequently heard when a piano is being played upon. One of the latest improvements is a desk for short-sighted pianists, which by hinged arms at the top can be drawn forward some inches nearer the sight. We believe all the foregoing nave been secured by royal letters patent. We should also mention that although Messrs. Venables are more widely- and better known in connection with pianos, they have also a large stock of American organs and har moniums, and are agents for the well-known \" Stirling Organ Company-,\" of whose manufacture they have some fine specimens. Eschinann Bros. & Walsh, Manufacturers of Surgical Instruments, &.C., 23, Bartholomew Square, St. Luke's, E.C. \u2014 The metropolitan trade in surgical instruments of all descriptions is one of enormous and daily extending dimensions. Many firms of high standing are engaged in this scientific industry, and among them a prominent position is maintained by the well-known and old-established house of Eschmann Bros. & Walsh. This renowned establishment was founded sixty years ago. The founders, Messrs. Eschmann Bros. & Walsh, retired some years ago, when they were succeeded by Mr. Walsh, junior, son of the original partner of the firm. The firm's operations cover the whole field of the surgical appliance and instrument industry. Their staple lines are elastic gum and instruments of every description. The soft silk flexible catheters, of which Mr. Walsh is the inventor and sole manufac turer, is a leading speciality, in which the productions of the house have \u25a0won wide repute. Sea tangle (laminaria digitata) and carbolised sponge tents are also manufactured iu the most perfect manner, and offered to the trade at prices that command a large sale. All the multifarious sundries incidental to such a trade are made and stocked in great variety. The house does a very large home and export trade, and in the latter branch their connection in America, Spain, and the Colonies is a very widespread and valuable one. They employ a large staff. Mr. Walsh possesses a complete knowledge of the details of tbe business, aud the success attend ing bis management of the firm is the best proof of his capacity and com mercial enterprise. Illman & Sons, Packing Case Makers, 33, Noble Street, E.C. \u2014 Among the leading firms engaged in the manufacture of packing \u25a0cases and similar goods are Messrs. Illman & Sons. The husiness was originally founded about seventy years ago by the grandfather of the present senior partner, whose two sons are now in partnership with him. At that time the firm simply occupied the premises in Noble \"Street. About forty-five years ago the firm opened an establishment,"], [78, "94 MODERN LONDON. this was one of the oldest iron depots in the metropolis, and the business. therefore takes a very leading position among similar establishments.

In this branch the firm have introduced an improved form, which they have patented, and which has been awarded a large number of prize medals at different important exhibitions. This patent wall-tie can be supplied either galvanized, or coated with Dr. Angus Smith's solution. The success achieved by this patent is unsurpassed by that of any similar invention. A very large connection is -maintained among the principal wholesale and retail houses and the most renowned buildiDg firms. Both in London and the provinces a large trade is done. There is also an extensive business in the export department, and the firm may be regarded as one of the most successful and thriving in London. S. Clark & Co., Park Street Works, Islington.\u2014 It was many years after the introduction of gas as an illuminator that its appli cation to other purposes, as heating, cooking, &c, was much studied. Recently, however, many very important improve ments have been introduced into the manufacture of the stoves and apparatus used for these purposes. Of these the system known as Clark's Patent Im proved \" Syphon\" Hygienic Gas Stoves is the most recent. The business, known for some years as the Hygienic Heating and Lighting Company, Limited, of the Park Street Works, Islington, engaged in the manufacture of these stoves, has been bought over, together with the original patents of Clark's Syphon Heating Gas Stoves, by Mr. S. Clark, who is the original inventor and patentee of the system, and will in future be carried on under the style of Messrs. S. Clark & Co., Syphon Works, Park Street, Islington. An important feature of the Syphon Hygienic Con densing Stove is that they are so constructed as to be applicable both for heating and lighting purposes. No flue is required, there being no smoke; no smell, no dirt or trouble, and no danger. It is also made as a licensed victualler's bar stove. The heat is generated by two Argand burners, the cost of gas being under three farthings an J.

It is a very elegant and ornamental article, being made in two different sizes, and is acknowledged by the trade in general to be beyond comparison the most useful, convenient, and handsome bar stove ever introduced to the public, and is certainly the least expensive. It gives more heat than an ordinary coal fire. This business is conducted in a most energetic and enterprising manner. Each syphon stove is supplied with a gas governor, giving a regular flame under varying pres sures. They are also now constructed so that a moist or dry atmosphere is obtainable at will. Mr. S. Clark, in consequence of the large demand for these stoves, has just removed into new and very commodious pre mises, known as the Syphon Works.

Perrott & Perrott, Packers, Clothworkers, Pressers, Finishers, and Pattern Book Makers, Tenter Street, Little Moor fields, E.C. \u2014 The energy and enterprise which are so eminently charac teristic of the mercantile men of the City of London are nowhere more apparent than in the extensive establishment of Messrs.

The fundamental principles upon which the business of the Equitable Society is based may be briefly enumerated as follows : \u2014 No insurance business other than life assurance, annuities, and endowments is transacted. All policies are practically unconditional, unchallengeable, and indefeasible on any ground whatever, every policy issued by the Equitable Society becoming absolutely- indisputable at the end of three years. The premiums are very moderate, combining the benefits of the moderate premiums of the proprietary- system with the full participation in the profits ofthe mutual plan. Claims are paid immediately on proof of death and title in London, or at any office of the society, as may be elected by the claimant. Under the American system of life assurance the Equitable Society is compelled to make detailed reports to the insur ance departments of the various States in which it transacts business. Its condition is periodically examined by the department of it? own State, and a balance sheet is returned annually to the London Board of Trade. As a special security for the society's policy-holders in Great Britain and Ireland, a deposit of 100,000/. is held by the Bank of England in the name of the trustees, the Bight Honourable the Earl of Denbigh, the Bight Honourable the Earl of Kintore, aud Sir Joseph C. Lee. The London Board of Directors consists of the following well-known gentlemen: Thomas Brooke, Esq., E. H. Bayley, the Hon. Sir Alexander Hamilton Gordon, K.C.B., Geo. W. Parker, and W. Sedgwjck Sauuders, Esq., M.D., F.S.A. The bankers are the Bank of England and Messrs. Smith, Payne, & Smiths. Mr. G. W. Parker, the managing director for Great Britain and Ireland, is a gentleman well known and highly respectedin the leading London financial circles. Under his efficient management tbe business ofthe Equitable Society has steadily* prospered and grown apace, and it stands to-day at the very head of the great fiscal corporations of the world, for not only does it transact a larger annual new business than any other company, but the amount of outstanding assurance on its books is larger than that of any other office. It has a larger premium than any other office, and, what is more important than all other considerations, its surplus is larger than that of any other company in the world. The new business for the first quarter of 1887 alone shows an increase over the corresponding quarter of 1886 of nearly 1,400,000/. The outstanding assurance shows an increase of nearly 5,000,000/., so that the assurance in force may now be stated at 105,000,000/., and the invested funds exceed 17,500,000/. The Equitable Society is the most influential assur ance society in the United States. Its success has been marked in Great Britain, throughout Northern Europe, in Canada, and Australia ; in fact, its career in all parts of the world is a triumphant record of what can be achieved by sound and energetic business efforts. hadwarehouse and factory,and car ried on a rapidly-increasing trade in the manufacture of silk hats, felt hats, caps, helmets, &c. The extent to which the business very soon had increased necessitated a removal to a more commodious establishment, and was therefore transferred to 41, Charterhouse Square, adjoining Aldersgate Street Station, and therefore is very conveniently located for the despatch of business. The manu facturing was carried on here for a few years, but as it was required for warehouse purposes, in order to meet the requirements of in creasing trade, the mauufacturing is carried on at more suitable places in the east of London and elsewhere, where a great number of hands are employed. The stock kept at the warehouse is probably one of the largest of hats and caps in the City. It comprises all descriptions of hats, caps, helmets, and straw hats of every variety of shape, size, and style. The firm have gained an unsurpassed reputation for the quality- of their goods, every article manufactured being superior in quality, workmanship, and style. Messrs. Hargroves & Co. have erected a large showroom, where they display a varied assortment of goods suitable for all parts of the United Kingdom, the Continent, and all parts of the world. Another noticeable feature in con nection with the method of conducting business in this firm is the com mendable enterprise exhibited in introducing novelties, new fashions, &c, in which a marked success has been achieved. A very extensive trade is done not only in London, but throughout the provinces generally. In addition the firm exports to the colonies. Commercial ability- and com mendable enterprise have combined in placing this firm in a very promi nent and honourable position in the trade. They gained a diploma at the Paris Exhibition, 1878, also at the Melbourne Exhibition, 1881, and in London, 1883. Demetrius N. Petrides Sc Co., Sponge Importers, 70* and 71, Bishopsgate Street Within, E.C. \u2014 SPONGE is an article of com merce well known to all, though probably few people give any thought to the difficulty and risk incurred in obtaining it. The majority of the sponge used comes from the Mediterranean Sea, and is obtained by means of diving. All along the coasts of Syria and Egypt there are depots where the trade is carried on, and the divers dispose of the sponge they have succeeded in obtaining. Among the firms having depots in the neighbourhood of this industry, one of the most renowned is that of Demetrius N. Petrides & Co.. a well-known house having offices at 70 and 71, Bishopsgate Street Within, London, E.C. The business has been in existence above twenty -five years, and has now become one ofthe foremost in the trade. The firm have depots on the various islands, where they purchase the sponge from the divers. It is then shipped to this country, and a large trade is done in supplying the principal wholesale houses, not only in the United Kingdom but also in France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, &c. The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, London Office, 81, Cheapside, E.C. (Geo. W. Parker, Esq., Managing Director ; A. Munkittrick, junr., Secretary). \u2014 The life insur- ance system has been for many years a powerful force in the progress and advancement of modern civilisation. In no other way than by means of life insurance can a person whose income is wholly or mainly dependent on his own exertions secure a large and immediate provision for wife or children in the event of his early death. That greatett of English writers, Dickens, has said, '*' No matter what may be the object of your solicitude, Be Assured ; \" whether you are thinking of the maintenance of general health, or of \" comfort and competence in your old age, or ofthe interests of wife and \" children when you may be no more, or of a provision for your boy \" when he reaches mature age, or of the happy marriage and the wedding \" portion of your little daughter, one day to be, you hope, a blushing bride, \" now a tiny, prattling fairy of two or three years \u2014 never mind the \" subject matter \u2014 Be Assured.\" Many thousands of life polices are aunually effected in this country with the above object. As showing the extent, of the business transacted by British life offices, it may be stated that their total income from premiums and interest amount to about 25,000,000/., and their total life assurance funds to about 140,000,000/. One of the most reliable and successful assurance organisations in the world is the Equitable Life Assurance Society ofthe United States, whose London office is in Cheapside, E.C. The society was founded in America iu July 1859, and from its very inception enjoyed a phenomenally success- ful career, a fact which speaks more than volumes for the sound judgment, honourable methods, and executive ability which have at all times cha- racterised its management. The society commenced business in Great Britain in 1867, and about sixteen years ago opened a central office at No. 1, Princess Street, Bank. The business of the society in this country- increased steadily- from year to year, until it had obtained proportions which necessitated larger offices, and in January 1881 possession was taken of the premises at present occupied. The society- transacts the business of life assurance upon the mutual principle, by which the whole of the profits belong to those assured ; in fact, the Equitable is, of all assurance offices, most deserving of being designated a mutual company. This is not simply due to the above-mentioned fact that all the profits of the business belong to policy-holders, but more especially because it has originated all the important reforms and improvements in that efficient H.

M-n- Palmer, Foreign Stamp Merchant, 281, Strand, \u2022 , , Pursmts m whlch men as well as women of culture now indulge are so numerous, and in many eases so diversified, that to <dve a name which will be handed down to future philatelists as one of the highest authorities and greatest benefactors to the stamp world of the nineteenth century. a descriptive account of each aud every one would take more room than space will permit in this instance. But since there are some of these pursuits of a more edifying nature than others, it may not prove uninteresting to give a brief sketch of the study of philately, which may be justly- ranked amongst the most instructive and fashion able pastimes of the present day. Philately, or stamp col lecting as it is sometimes called, was originated by Mr. J. W. Palmer, of the Strand, London, somewhere about 1857, and during the last decade this particular pursuit has developed with remark able rapidity, not only in England, but all over the world. Sovereigns in palaces, statesmen in mansions, law yers in chambers, and clergy- Robert Roberts & Co., Woollen Warehousemen, 13, London Wall, E.C. \u2014 In reviewing historically the various trades, indus tries, and occupations which contribute so materially to the commercial prosperity of the metropolis, it is most interesting and gratifying to meet with a firm of such standing and business connections as that of Messrs. Eobert Boberts & Co., woollen warehousemen. Glancing in the first place at the early history of this well-known house of business, we find that it was established over one hundred years ago in Aldgate, and, with the development of trade and commerce, has gradually increased its connections and extended its departments, as now to be well recognised as one of the largest and most influential houses in the trade. Messrs. Boberts & Co. occupy very extensive premises, comprising spacious warehouse and a handsome suite of well appointed offices and counting house, and hold an immense stock of woollen goods of the best quality and most fashionable styles. They have a first-class connection amongst the leading West-end and City tailors and country outfitting establishments. The business is purely wholesale, and is conducted with characteristic ability, euergy, and enterprise. With respect to a firm of such great antiquity and high commercial standing, any special commendation or praise would be superfluous. Messrs. Boberts & Co. have, however, from their long association with the commerce of the City of London, and the extent and importance of their operations, gained a leading position amongst the largest and most influential of the great mercantile houses of the metropolis. men in libraries \u2014 all have their stamp album, and each now vies with the other to obtain the best collection of stamps. Evidently, then, as philately enlists amongst its votaries such eminent personages as these, it can be no mean pursuit, no inere frivolous occupation of time. That there is an incalculable amount of benefit to be derived from a study of the stamps of nations has been testified to over and over again by persons so engaged, who have had their store of geographical and historical knowledge considerably en riched. With the pursuit of this study there naturally came into existence the stamp dealer, whose business consists of buying and selling rare foreign and colonial stamps. In this business advantage was taken by some unscrupulous dealers to pass off to collectors forgeries as genuine stamps, for to detect a fraudulent stamp is a faculty not possessed by \u25a0everybody, and many old philatelists have been deceived in this respect. It is only those persons who have made stamp collecting a life-long study that are able to detect a forgery, but these experts are few and far between, and a collector is very often in doubt as to the genuineness of a stamp, so that it will be a source of gratification to them to know that for upwards of thirty years Mr. J. W. Palmer, of the Strand, has prac tised as a philatelist, and it may be safely said that there is no greater living authority on stamps. From the very commencement of his practice Mr. Palmer has been the inveterate enemy of forgers, and one of the means which he adopted to counteract their nefarious traffic was that of expressing his opinion gratis upon all stamps submitted to his inspection. Such an offer as this met with au immediate response from \u25a0collectors in all parts of the world, who were not slow to recognise the liberal proposal. Even at the present time the greater part of Mr. Palmer's attention is devoted to gratuitously advising on philately, and every morning at his offices, 2*1, Strand, are to be seen large quantities of letters, bearing the postmarks of every nationality in the Postal Union, containing, in some cases, hundreds of stamps, which have been sent for his inspection and opinion. The principal part of his business is con .ducted by correspondence, and on receipt of a reference to a well-known house of business or a banker, he will forward to any part of the world sheets of rare foreign stamps on approval. To give some idea of the amount of capital necessary to carry on his business, it may be stated that he has at the present time in circulation, on approval alone, upwards of 4,000/. of rare specimens of stamps. If a collector has been unable to complete his set, let him place himself in communication with Mr. Palmer, who has the largest stock of stamps in the world, and who is credited with haviDg completed more sets than any other dealer extant. To bring the pursuit of philately within the reach of all, Mr. Palmer recently instituted an exchange, through the medium of which stamps varying in value from Is. to 100/. may be obtained for anything and everything. In addition to conducting the business of foreign stamp merchant, Mr. Palmer is an author and a publisher. He is also the editor of a little journal\u2014 Bric-a-Brac \u2014 issued monthly, which has become the acknowledged organ of philatelists. It was entirely owing to Mr. Palmer's indefatigable exertions that a clause of special benefit to collectors was inserted in the Post Office Protection Act of 1884. Parliament recognised the valuable assistance he had rendered to the government in the detection of forged stamps by designating the seventh clause of the previously-mentioned Act \" Palmer's.\" From this neces sarily brief sketch it will be seen that philately is not only an instructive and interesting pastime, hut also a profitable pursuit ; and by Mr. Palmer's .zealous labours, he has not only helped to clarify the atmosphere of the stamp world of the evils which formerly permeated it, but he has gained T.

T. G. Hastings & Nephew. The business was originally founded some seventy years ago, and, by reason of the great skill and excellent practical judgment which have ever characterised its operations, the house early secured a trade and connection far ahead of any house in its line. The firm deal generally in butter, cheese, hams, bacon, and kindred staple food supplies, exporting through their branch house at Botterdam, and buying extensively in the English markets. Their export trade is of large annual volume, both from London and Botterdam direct, to all points of South America, Australia, India, China, and elsewhere, their exportations to Brazil in these lines of provisions being larger than those of any contemporary metropolitan establishment, and the firm, giving as they do their closest personal atten tion tc every detail of their extensive business, are enabled to promptly execute all orders, and in a manner entirely satisfactory to their patrons. It is such firms as this that go to constitute the exponents of the various branches of metropolitan industry, aud they well merit the high degree of prominence to which their own energy and enterprise have, during a period of nearly three-quarters of a century, unerringly attained. From its earliest establishment, iu fact, this house has been a favourite source of supply in this line of trade, and those forming business relations with it will obtain such advantages as are in accord with an honourable record of so long a standing.

The entire stock is maintained in admirable order. But large as the establishment is, and great as is the manufacturing and warehousing accommodation afforded, it is all too little to meet the space demands ot an ever-growing business. Mr. Burluraux carries on a irade of a principally wholesale character, and, in addition to the liberal support ot a numerous and influential home circle of patrons, he enjoys the benefits of a valuable and widespread connection extending to all parts of the world, she business operations of his house are in all respects conducted with commendable energy and activity - and the well-merited commercial prosperity which has thus fur closely attended its long and hoTurato career gives every indication of being the strongest and most ZtifL feature of its fortunes in time to come. bldluim6"], [81, "MODEEN LONDON. 97 very best style of the modern clothiers' art in civil, military, naval, and livery tailoring.

In No. 39 are the silk and satin departments, with stocks of the highest order of excellence and attractiveness. The very richest goods the market affords are here to be Been, and almost side by side with these are utilitarian materials at moderate prices, whose quality is only equalled by their cheapness. At the end of this shop is the mourning department, where every requisite for family mourning and the proper equipment of funeral ceremonies can be obtained. Adjoining No. 39, in a spacious and well-appointed room, are a bank, telegraph office, tele phone and post office, auction, house, and insurance agency, coal supply office, lost property and general information bureau, railway, theatre, conoert, and steamboat ticket office. No. 41 is the haberdashery depart ment, a complete exhibition of every little nick-nack and requisite in minor drapery. Then comes No. 43, one of the most attractive of the Westbourne Grove shops. Here are the laces and furs, the sunshades, umbrellas and gloves, and one cannot help wondering at the amazing enterprise and restless activity which maintain such a stock in a state of continual freshness and novelty. No. 45 is devoted to mantles, ready made or to measure ; No. 47 to jewellery, plate, cutlery, perfumery, and drugs, all retailed at stock prices.

At the rear of No. 55 is a Berlin wool department, and then come a supplementary department at No. 61, Westbourne Grove, the superb wine and spirit vaults and cigar divans whose stocks maintain a standard of high excellence which seems to be the characteristic feature of every section of Mr. Whiteley's house. In Kensington Gardens Square is the refreshment; department. Gaining a spacious hall the visitor turns to the left and comes to a splendidly appointed dining-room upholstered and fixtured in a style which loses nothing by comparison with the best metropolitan hotels. Adjoining this are two other dining saloons, and attached to one of these is a well served refreshment bar. Ascending a staircase from this section the toy department is reached. This is a veritable juvenile paradise. Betracing our steps to the entrance hall, and turning this time to the right, one comes to the excellently appointed and comfortably furnished footmen's waiting room. Close to this is a well-regulated cloak room, and above these two is a gentlemen's waiting room, very handsomely fitted up, and provided with daily and other newspapers. Adjoining this are the well appointed gentlemen's lavatories. Once more back to and down the entrance hall to the refreshment rooms and a few steps give access to the hair-dressing saloons for ladies and gentlemen, each room being fixtured in the best and most approved modern fashion. Adjacent to these is a magnificei.t costume show-room, acknowledged to be the finest of its kind in the world. Here are displayed those splendid specimens of the costumier's art for which the great Bayswater emporium has such a widespread and eminent reputation, and adjoining the show-room itself are fitting-rooms equipped with every convenience tending to give perfect satisfaction to patrons. On the first floor of No. 31 is the department for dressing gowns, shirts, and bespoke juvenile outfitting, in which every attention is devoted to the production of exclusively first-class work both in matters of material and execution. No. 33 contains juvenile outfitting ready made. No. 35 is devoted to youths' and men's ready made clothing, and is also completely and comprehensively stocked with fine goods.

All these sections are most completely stocked, good order and efficient attendance prevail throughout. Every item is purchased in the best markets or made on the premises, is of first quality only, and is sold at lowest remunerative prices. The division walls of the shops from No. 31 to No. 55 inclusive, are. pierced with doorways, thus affording uninterrupted communication from end to end of the establishment. On the second floor of the Westbourne Grove buildings, from Nos. 31 to 55 are shirt cutting and shirt making rooms, workrooms for tailors, dress, mantle, and artificial flower makers, and a room in which the cash received in the whole establishment during the entire day is counted.

It is curious to reflect how inseparably Bayswater in general, and the streets around Westbourne Grove in particular, seem to be almost absorbed in one vast establishment, and to remember how well nigh impossible it is for a thought of the district in question to enter the mind unaccompanied by some allusion to \" Whiteley 's,\" that wonderful elysium of the London \"shopper,\" the morning or afternoon resort, par excellence, in a business sense of metropolitan fashion, the head-quarters of the world-renowned \"Universnl Provider.\" And equally remarkable is it to remember that Whiteley's, with aU ita wealth of commercial and utilitarian marvels, is not a place that can be explored quickly. Indeed it will hardly be surprising if the novice in such matters ae the systematic inspection of huge commercial depots shouldapproachthis task with feelings somewhat akin to those entertained by the traveller about to make bis first swift descent per steamboat of the rushing Eapids of Lachine. But when once the steep plunge has been accomplished, when once the mighty tour of the acres of shops which now comprise the domain of the Universal Provider has been satisfactorily completed, how difficult it is to counteract the desire to enjoy the delightful experience all over again ! And after such a bewildering introduction to the wonders of well-nigh every con ceivable business enterprise rolled into one, cannot the astounded inspector readily be pardoned for ransacking his brain almost vainly for some ade quate title to bestow upon such a stupendous aggregation of mercantile pursuits ? Depot, emporium, bazaar, warehouse \u2014 none of these seem to possess the slightest descriptive power. Whiteley's is an immense symposium of the arts and industries of the nation and of the world ; a grand review of everything that goes to make life worth living passing in seemingly endless array before critical but bewildered humanity; an international exhibition of the resources and products of earth and air, flood and field, established as one of the greatest \"lions\" of the metropolis. It is now twenty-four years and a few months since Mr. William Whiteley, a native of Yorkshire (where he was born near Wakefield, in 1831) first opened at 31, Westbourne Grove, a shop, with two assistants and an errand boy, which was destined, as he doubtless then little imagined, to be the nucleus of an establishment whose magni tude the world has not yet seen eclipsed. This concern embraces fourteen splendid shops in Westbourne Grove, seven in Queen's Road, four houses in Kensington Gardens Square, Factories in Douglas Place, an entire street of residential quarters devoted to the uses of a large proportion of a staff of employes now numbering upwards of 6,500 souls, a stock and dairy farm at Finchley of over two hundred acres \u2014 in short, every feature that could be deemed necessary to constitute a veritable colossus among mercantile houses. The fourteen shops in the Westbourne Grove section of Whiteley's emporium range from Nos. 31 to 55 and 61 in that thoroughfare, and are located in a terrace of splendid business edifices three storeys in height, with a street frontage of 300 feet. In the basement there are a large double-doored strong room and safe, wherein is put all the cash which finds its way into the establishment. At one side of the strong-room door is a spiral staircase connecting the basement with the upper counting-house, whichis managed by 1 60 clerical assistants. Next is the matching room, where all coloured goods are \" matched,\" the process taking place in daylight only, and adjoining this are the porters' cash room, for the receipt of moneys collected by porters and vanmen, the special parcel post department, where urgently required goods are packed and dispatched instanter, and the pattern room, whence are sent forth patterns of all goods in stock. Then come the first and second country departments, for the making up and forwarding of all country goods, the country order, correspondence, and foreign depart ments, whose titles suggest fully their important uses, and the approba tion room, from which are dispatched aU articles ordered on approval hy customers resident in or out of town. In this wonderful basement the next place of interest is one of the male dining-rooms, with accommodation fur 120 assistants at a time, and following this the well-fitted kitchen, the buyers' dining-room, the female assistants' dining-rooms, seating 100 at a time, and then another male assistants' dining-room also for 100 hands, a bread-cutting room equipped with appropriate machinery adjoining. This brings the visitor to the Westbourne Grove despatch department, a large room of commodious arrangement, fitted all round the walls with capacious fixtures, each labelled with the name of a district. The goods in parcels are placed in these fixtures and from them collected by a staff of porteis who load the vans. Ascending a broad staircase from the despatch room the loading stage is gained, a. large covered shed into which the vans are backed and wherein ten of these ever-busy conveyances can be loaded at a time. Mr. Whiteley's system of delivery by his own vehicles is as well-nigh perfect in its operation as possible. The scheme has a radius of twenty-five miles from the Bays water centre. For long country journeys extra depots have been insti tuted at Heyes, Croydon, Epsom, and numerous other places, where relays of horses are to be had, every depot being under the sole control of the house. A stud of 320 horses and a total of 145 vehicles are impressed into the service of this immense delivery system. Entering the ground-floor area in Westbourne Grove, No. 31 is a hat store, and therein every kind of covering for the head which the ingenuity or fashionable eccentricity of man or woman has yet conceived may be obtained No. 33 is the bespoke tailoring department, with a splendid itock of piece goods and unsurpassed facilities for the execution in the E"], [82, "98 MODEEN LONDON.

Next are the linen stock room, where all the goods are stacked in bales as they come direct from the mills, the Oriental, oilcloth and floorcloth, and carpet stock rooms literally packed with valuable merchandise, and the extensive engine house. Here are engines aggregating 400 horse-power, part of which is utilised for supplying the emporium with electric light, there being no fewer than 3,400 incandescent and 120 arc lamps in the establishment, and part for operating the eight elevators of the place, and for driving the 173 different machines for manufacturing purposes, whose activity is as ceaseless as their productive capacity is marvellous. And last comes the bread, biscuit, and pastry bakery, with many wonderful machines for rolling dough, cleaning currants and raisins, and cutting candied peel. All these sections are maintained in most exemplary order and cleanliness, and each is isolated from the other by double doors of iron. Then up once more and through the Queen's Boad ground-floor range. Starting with No. 147, Queen's Boad, there is to be seen the household furniture department, with a remarkable stock of fine modern and antique furni ture. Next door, at No. 149, is yet another department which can only be set down as magnificent. Here are carpets and floor coverings of every species and quality known to the trade, both foreign and domestic. In the centre of the rearward portion of Nos. 147 and 149 is the Oriental department, a very leaf out of an Eastern fairy tale, with its tiled floor, unique appointments, and amazing assortment of specialities. At the extreme rear of No. 149 is the building, paperhanging, and electric department, exemplifying every notable feature in those three significant branches. No. 151 is the linen department, exhaustively and heavily stocked, with counting-house at the rear, and coal, forage, French cleaning, dyeing, and shipping order departments beyond. In the centre of the rears of 151 and 153 is another superbly furnished refreshment saloon, wherein may be obtained all kinds of French and fancy confectionery and other dainty edibles. No. 153 itself is set apart for the display of china and earthenware of every description, and a dazzling display it is, full of brilliancy of tint and hue. Then at No. 155 are situate the ironmongery show and sale rooms. From a needle to a ship's anchor everything is here or within reach at a moment's notice. In the centre of the rears of 155 and 157 is an annexe, half of which is utilised for the purposes of a floral department, charming in its every feature, with a superb fernery at one end, the other half being devoted to a zoological section wherein the natural kingdom is represented with exhaustive completeness. No. 157 is a bread, cake and grocery, cigar and tobacco department, heavily and attractively stocked. There is a seeds department at the rear. No. 159, an immensely comprehensive department, is stocked with an enormous variety of goods particularly attractive in character, and containing sections for bottled beer, wines, cooked meats, butter, cheese, vegetables, together with butcher's, poulterer's and fishmonger's shops, to the latter of which is attached a fish bar where those tempting little fish luncheons popularly denominated \" snacks \" may be had at all hours. Each of these Queen's Boad ground- floor shops has a depth of 200 to 300 feet and a street frontage of 60 feet. Behind the shops are the stables, and the very extensive factory in Douglas Place, which latter includes the builders', cabinet makers', carpenters', smiths', and gas fitters' workshops, and a large farriers' shop and coach builders' department are adjacent to the stables. At the rear of these shops also is the Queen's Boad. establishment loading stage, with accommodation for ten vans at a time. This completes the ground-floor, and, ascending to 147, Queen's Boad first floor, we find the bedding and upholstery departments, and passing along to No. 149, and from thence straight through to 169 again, there follow in quick succession the sections for furnishing drapery, Venetian blinds, cornices, &c, trunks, travelling bags, and every requisite for the use of voyageurs, glass ware, with specimens of the richest, rarest, and most beautiful merchandise obtainable always on view, brushes and turnery (a noteworthy stock), pianos, smears work, and photography, whose features must be seen to be properly appreciated ; and the comprehensive stock of goods for hire, embracing accessories of all possible kinds for balls, parties, dinners, and every conceivable description of indoor and outdoor entertainment. Then up to the second floor, where are the grocery stock room and ware- house, the French cleaning and dyeing work-room, the stationery folding and the sewing departments, the mattress and bed-making, trunk and blind-making, linen -marking and hemming departments, the cabinet repairs workshop, and the furniture stuffing department. Up once more and the third floor shows the commodious and well-arranged dining- rooms for the Queen's Boad staff, together with a spacious and thoroughly equipped printing office. Then down again, through the labyrinthine pas- sages, corridors, show-rooms, among the piles and tiers of goods, constituting a stock of value well-nigh incalculable, amid a buzz of voices and a steady hum of business activity which rests not from half-past eiL'ht a.m. until seven p.m. Out into the street, and the exploration of \" Whiteley's \" is over. The grand circuit has been completed, the tourist has traversed a world of industry, art, and commerce from Dan to Beersheba, and it is small wonder that a degree of bewilderment ensues. Futile and frivolous would be any attempt to enumerate even a tithe of the seasonable specialities shown by Mr. William Whiteley, and set forth in detail in the pages of his wondrous catalogue. Where is the need for such enumeration ? William Whiteley sells everything, universal provision is the one great speciality of the houBe, that is the very raison d'etre of the establishment, and never was an aim more assiduously pursued, an object more completely achieved. There would accrue to all these merits no extra jot of excellence by any amount of dissertation, they are self sufficient, self-supporting, and it is indeed difficult after a visit of inspec tion to the house of the Universal Provider to subscribe without prejudice and reluctance to the time-honoured dictum that \" Nothing is Perfect.\" Surely Whiteley's must be perfect. And as to the manner in which Mr. AVilliam Whiteley conducts this gigantic emporium of his, what more can be said than that he has achieved all that man can achieve in the world of industry and trade ? Everything that indomitable energy, indefatigable determination, unremitting enterprise, irreproachable integrity, and a business aptitude, rare even in these competitive days, could do, he has accomplished. And all tbe abstract attributes, possessed by him in a remarkable degree, when added to many an estimable quality of character and heart, have not alone placed Mr. William Whiteley at the head of the largest store, the most numerous staff, the most comprehensive business, and one of tbe most widespread commercial connections in the world, but have secured for him the personal regard, confidence and esteem of employes and patrons alike throughout the United Kingdom, and have won him individual celebrity as far-reaching in all quarters of the globe as the renowned operations in universal catering, whose successful and conscientious prosecution has brought him the mercantile prospe/ity and personal fame he now so justly enjoys. \u2022 * * \u2022 \u2022 The details of the above necessarily brief sketch will, it is hoped, convey in some degree an idea of the leading features of the Universal Provider's vast emporium as it stood up to six o'clock in the evening of Saturday, August 6th, 18S7- An hour later fire and smoke issued in volumes from the Douglas Place factory ; the conflagration spread with a rapidity that admits of but one satisfactory explanation of its fierceness ; and when, after raging with fury during the greater portion of the night and following morning, the flames were at length brought under control, Queen's Boad, Bayswater, presented a spectacle that has, happily, rarely been familiar to residents in its vicinity, and of five of Mr. Whiteley's seven magnificent shops in that handsome and progressive thoroughfare, nothing remained but blackened and shattered waBs and piles of hot, smouldering ruins. Thus, for the fifth time during his career in the com mercial worid of London, has Mr. William Whiteley been visited with the bitter misfortune of a disastrous conflagration, the calamity on this occasion considerably surpassing in deplorable effect each and all of its predecessors, any one of which would have been in itself sufficient to terminate, or at least to almost fatally interrupt, the advancement of any ordinary business house. And the misfortune in this case is rendered doubly acute, alike to Mr. Whiteley himself and to the whole right-minded mercantile and general community who sympathise with him in his great loss, by the manifest fact that, all things calmly and judicially considered, each evidence weighed, and every detail of the fire's outbreak and progress reviewed without prejudice, it is practically impossible to assign the origin of the catastrophe to any other casue than that of incendiarism. Everything in connection with tho disaster has pointed to the same conclusion, and no other theory has obtained any plausible foundation in fact. For the fine structural character of all Mr. Whiteloy's buildings, and the excellent precautions that have always been taken to render them as far as possible secure from the effects of an extended conflagration, are facts widely familiar to metropolitan residents ; and the amazing, almost systematic, rapidity with which the fire on this occasion communicated itself from shop to Bhop (despite the existence of steel doors, and other devices of an equally effective kind under all ordinary circumstances), can only be regarded as the outcome of a scheme of wholesale arson, carefully developed and as carefully carried out. It is difficult to conceive the full depth of a malignity capable of planning and effecting the wanton destruction of an establishment that has not only become a mercantile wonder in the land, but a convenience to thousands of all classes of the community, who could not fail to deplore its extinction equally and in common with its eminent and highly respected founder and proprietor. And hardly anyone will deny that the public in vast numbers share with Mr. Whiteley the good fortune which intervened to check the conflagration before it had completely accomplished the in famous design of its originator. As it is, the loss on stock and property is tremendous, and would have proved an insurmountable discouragement to many another man than Mr*. William Whiteley. The fire, in the entirety of its consequences, has proved to be the most calamitous of all those from which he had previously suffered, the loss being certainly not less than half a million sterling, upon which enormous sum the in surance is virtually nil. This latter fact is undoubtedly the hardest of all. But such a man as Mr. William Whiteley\u2014 a man who has absolutely commanded success by the sheer force of an indomitable will \u2014is not to be daunted by misfortune, even in multiplied visits. The ruins of the Queen's Boad premises were barely cold when once more the work of restoration was inaugurated ; and, perfect as was the splendid pile destroyed, that which is now rapidlv replacing it bids fair to illustrate yet again Mr. Whiteley's remarkable\" faculty for turning disaster into actual triumph. In this way the invincible determination of the man shines at its brightest, deriving renewed vigour from every attempted reverse ; and if that traditional sincere admiration for sterling courage and a spirit unconquerable still survives as a national British characteristic it should, in itself alone, constitute an ever-present safeguard in the future for an emporium that has thus far defied all malice and ill-fortune, and is now, for the fifth time, literally rising Ph\u0153nix-like, and more proudly than ever, from the ashes of repeated and unjustifiable destruction"], [83, "MODERN LONDON. 99 N.

In this branch of business the old-established and well-known firm of Mr. N. Abrahams has for many years occupied a leading position. In the year 1851 this arrangement is extremely simple ; priming and boiling over of frothy liquids is absolutely prevented ; the tubes can be easily and quickly cleaned ; no heavy or expensive foundation or framework is required for the apparatus, which occupies little space ; no injury or colouring whatever is incurred by the liquid iu process of concentration ; the system costs less than any other known method of evaporation in vacua, and, finally, it is no mere experiment, but has been fully and crucially tested, always with perfectly satisfactory results, and has evaporated substances hitherto considered impracticable to handle in any vacuum apparatus.

For many years tbe well known house of Mr. Archibald Kerr has occupied a foremost place among the cabinet manufacturing concerns of London, and continues still to maintain its reputation in face of the greatest competition arising from the establishment of rival concerns, as well as from the importation of cheaply manufactured goods. The business was established in 1856, and from a comparatively small beginning it has gradually developed with steady precision, until it is now one of the most noted houses in the trade All descriptions of furniture and cabinet work are turned out, elegance and artistic finish being combined with sound construction and remarkable durability. A wholesale and export trade is carried on, and in the latter the business is rapidly increasing, while in th\u00ab former an old-standing connection has been, and is, well maintained. The premises are suitable for the large trade carried on, and are divided, although near together. No. 12, Hoxton Market is the packing and export warehouse ; No. 9, Hoxton Square is the timber yard, where a large stock of well-selected timber is kept, special attention being given to proper seasoning, so much depending upon this, as shipments are frequently made to tropical countries. No. 22, Hoxton Square contains the handsome showrooms and commodious workshops. The superiority of the work executed by- Mr. Kerr is not to be wondered at, as the family has been connected with the business for many years. Mr. Kerr, senr., in his time worked for some of our largest and best houses, producing to order high specimens of art, suitable for exhibitions as well as for ordinary use.

A moderate staff of workmen is employed, and includes some of the most skilled operatives of the city. Every item is super intended by the proprietor, under whose practical eye and keen judgment only the soundest and best work is allowed to pass. Mr. Kerr occupies a good position among the business men of the metropolis. with various orth\u0153pedic malformations, the house has acquired great success and fame, and hundreds of testimonials have been received testifying to the excellence of its productions. A convenient and elegantly appointed trying-on room is attached to the shop. Wedding, Indian, and colonial outfits are promptly and tastefully executed and prepared. Special designs are submitted for any and every conceivable class of boot and shoe. Designers are kept on the premises for the purpose of in troducing novelties. Dress shoes are made to order, in any colour, -at twenty-four hours notice (when required), and a speciality is made of painted boots and shoes \u2022and embroidery of every kind, including the designing and exe cuting of monograms on boots, shoes, and slippers.

This business is conducted with \u25a0great energy and enterprise, a speciality being in the fitting, which is made on correct anatomical principles, and the measures and sizes carefully registered. Mr. N.

Humber & Co., Limited, Bicycles and Tricycles, 3> , Holborn Viaduct, E.C. \u2014 Messrs. Humber & Co., Limited, of Beeston, Notts., whose productions are triumphs of British inventive genius and mechanical skill, stand in the front rank of the bicycle and tricycle manu facturers of this country. This business was established nineteen years ago by Mr. Thomas Humber. After two changes in the style of the firm the present title was assumed in 1887. Their extensive works are at Beeston, Nottingham, also at Coventry and Wolverhampton. The London warehouse and showrooms contain an extensive stock of the world-famed Humber machines. This firm are the inventors and original manufacturers of the \" Humber \" cycles, their specialities being the \" Cripper \" tricycle for lady or gentleman, or both ; the \" Cripper \" tandem for ladies or gentlemen ; the \" Humber \" tricycle for gentlemen ; the \" Humber \" tandem for lady and gentleman ; the \" Humber \" bicycle, and the \" Humber \" safety bicycle. Convincing proofs of the superiority of these machiues, whether on the road or path, is shown by the records of the National Cyclists Union. Messrs. Humber & Co., Limited, spare no efforts to sustain the standard excellence of their productions, and their success is proved by the large and steadily increasing demand for their bicycles and tricycles. The Yaryan Company (Mr. A. G*. Paine, Eresident), con- trolling- tbe Yaryan System of Evaporation, Palmerston Buildings, 93, Bishopsgate Street Within, E.C. \u2014 This prominent and important concern \u2022constitutes the London office of an American company, and has been recently instituted to introduce into the United Kingdom and its industries the Yaryan System of Evaporation, invented by the president of the American concern \u2014 Mr. Homer T. Yaryan, an American by birth. The system has been in use in America for some considerable time. In addition to the London establishment, a branch house has also been inaugurated in Berlin, and another in Lille, France. Among the many purposes to which the Yaryan Evaporation System has been applied with remarkable success are : \u2014 The evaporating of glue, sugar solutions, tank-water, tannin, extract logwood, glucose, caustic soda, liquid beef, and glycerine, and in the making of condensed milk and the dehydrating of wine. The system may be briefly described as one which performs the process of evapo- Tation and concentration of liquids, in vacuo, within coils of pipe, sur- rounded by steam or other heating medium. It is entirely different from all other known methods of reducing liquids in vacuo, and the principle it involves is so absolutely new that it not only gained the highest award at the late Novelties Exhibition, Philadelphia, but was referred by the judges to the committee on arts and science of that scientific organisation in the United States, the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania, from which eminent source it received a further medallic reward. The system has manifestly many advantages, and among these notable points in its favour the following are chief:\u2014 It is most economical in steam ; it is \u25a0 automatic in action; the liquor is not subjected to high and injurious temperatures for more than a few minutes ; the pumping and mechanical Britannia Company, Makers of Engineers' Tools, London Showrooms, 100, Houndsditch, E.C. ; Works, Colchester. \u2014 Over twenty years ago was established at Colchester the celebrated Britannia Company, manufacturers of engineers' tools and machines for carpenters' and woodworkers' use. In consequence of the large increase and develop ment of their business it was found necessary to open a branch establish ment in London. Among the tools may be mentioned all kinds of lathes, drills, planers, circular and fret saws, and slotting and milling machines, portable forges, gas engines, engraving machines, screw, bolt, and nut machines. The lathes as supplied to the Boyal Navy are splendid specimens of workmanship. The company have obtained a justly deserved celebrity, and are makers to the British and other governments. They manufacture over three hundred varieties of tools, and have special departments for light amateurs' and heavy engineers' tools. Their goods are well known and appreciated in all branches of mechanical industry. F 2"], [84, "MODEEN LONDON. 100 have been of a varied character, and have included considerable operations for the Corporations of London, Southampton, Hastings, Leicester, anil Reading the Conservators of the Eiver Thames, the Trinity House, the counties of Essex, Middlesex, and Surrey, the Lambeth aud Chelsea Water Works Companies, Gas Companies, the War Department, and numerous other public and private establishments. It may, we believe, be said of this firm that it has a deserved reputation for executing faithfully and with despatch such works as are entrusted to it, and that its commercial credit is solidly founded. Tbe present partners are Mr. George Munday and his sons, Mr. Clement and Mr. Philip Munday. The City office is at 8, Savage Gardens, E.C., aud the stores and workshops at Islay Wharf Poplar, E. Bruton & Co., Printers and Advertising Contractors, Moorfields, Upper Thames Street, aud Bishopsgate Street. \u2014 In the very first rank of general printers and advertising contractors, Messrs. Bruton & Co. is a firm that claims very special attention. The printing offices at 28, Tenter Street, Moorfields, include several spacious workrooms, a com modious warehouse, and convenient offices. The type and machinery are of the most modern and approved kinds, and doubtless this accounts for the high reputation this firm has already earned for the work they turn out. Commercial and general printing (such as posters, office stationery, account books, and the like) form the staple business, whilst a consider able amount of work is done for the trade, the connection embracing many of the leading City publishing houses. Messrs. Bruton & Co.'s ad vertising aud bill posting business is carried on at 133, Upper Thames Street. Here the offices are almost unique in their simplicity, considering that they are really the centre of such a vast amount of outdoor work, and the headquarters of a small army of boardmen. Perhaps never is a better glimpse of the \" seamy side \" of this great city obtained thau when the word goes forth that an extra number of \" sandwich men \" are wanted, and the poor fellows mass in their hundreds, and are engaged or rejected, as the case may be. The stabling for the numerous horses and vans is in Gun Yard, Bishopsgate, and here are also situated the workshops for the making of hoardings, sign boards, &c. The advertising business is really the parent concern, having been established for over twelve years, but the same spirit of enterprise pervades both this and the printing office, and it has met with the most gratifying success. Messrs. Bruton & Co. are everywhere spoken of with the greatest respect, and the firm is held to be one of the best conducted and most prosperous in the metropolis. S Schneiders & Son, Cap and Cloth Hat Manufac turers, Puck's Bow, Whitechapel, E.C.\u2014 There are few firms in London that employ so many hands in any branch of manufacture as that of Messrs. S. Schneiders & Son, the well-known cap and cloth hat manu facturers, who are by far the largest makers in this special branch in the metropolis. The business was founded about 1847, and for many years was carried on at St. Mary Street, Whitechapel Boad. The continual increase in the trade, however, necessitated its removal to more commo dious premises, and the present establishment in Buck's Bow was there fore specially built for the firm. The factory is one of the largest in the East-end of London. It forms a spacious five-storied building, and altogether covers an area of upwards of 11,000 square feet. The machinery is of the most improved description. There are no less than 500 sewing machines, all driven by steam, and in the majority of instances these are superintended by women. The cutting machines cut out the various sizes and shapes of the cloth, linings, &c, and some of them will cu> nearly 100 pieces at one stroke. Another department is devoted to the work in embroidery and fancy needlewoik for various designs on chil dren's caps, &c. Another floor is set apart for the blocking of tweed helmets and hats, in addition to which there is also carried on the manu facture of tropical helmets, which are blocked by means of hydraulic presses. As many as 4,000 dozen caps are manufactured per week. The proprietors command a most extensive trade, not only in the United Kingdom, but also with the leading shipping firms. They also carry on a very extensive and important direct export trade to Melbourne, where they have a spacious depot. In addition to the manufacture of hats they also conduct a large business as wholesale clothiers, but this constitutes an entirely separate branch, the factory for which is in Commercial Street and Whitechapel Boad. The business is admirably managed in every department, and occupies a pre-eminent position among all other firms engaged in similar branches of industry. George Beck & Co., Mourning Hat-Band Manufac turers and Warehousemen, 13, Gresham Street, St. Martin's-le- Grand, E.C. \u2014 There are many branches of industry of an important character in the metropolis which have reference to the dead. In this connection attention is merited by that well-known and truly representa tive business of mourning hat-band manufacturers carried on under the style of Geo. Beck & Co., at the foregoing location. The premises are most conveniently and centrally situated, being close to the General Post Office, and consist of office, warehouse, and workrooms. This industry was first established half a century ago, and about ten years later came into the hands of Mr. Beck. This gentleman soon placed the business in a leading position in the trade. In 1873 Mr. J. Sherlock Wilks joined the firm as a partner, and imparted fresh energy and impetus to an already prosperous concern. In 1875 Mr. Beck retired, and Mr. Wilks became the sole proprietor. Owing to the death of Mr. Wilks, the busi ness in 1876 came into the possession of his family, by whom it has been since ably conducted. The business consists in manufacturing for the wholesale, many of the largest and best export houses being supplied. Cloth bands in various widths, from l| in. to 6 in., form the staple trade, three qualities being made, and the prices are fixed at Id., lhl., and Id. per inch. Paramatta, crape, and silk bands are also manufactured to order, the latter going principally to America, and having the seams orna mented with one or two rows of beads. It is right that particular mention should be made here of a special and improved system of cutting, designed and applied by this firm, which is so adapted to the bias of the material that an absolutely flat surface is insured for the band when on the hat, and presenting a most finished appearance. The characteristics of tbe firm may be described as unvarying politeness, care in the selection of a uniform high quality of material, finish of the most perfect kind in the manufacture, and promptitude in the execution and despatch of all orders. Abram & Sons, Law Stationers, Lithographers, and Printers, Middle Temple Gate, Fleet Street, E.C. \u2014 Established for over two centuries, the ancient and time-honoured firm of Messrs. Abram & Sons, law stationers, lithographers, and printers, continues to flourish at the Old House, anciently known as the Post House, Middle Temple Gate (opposite the new Law Courts), Strand. In the Law Times of March 27, 1875, there is an extract referring lo the premises of Messrs. Abram & Sons, and the old house known as the Post House, wherein Messrs. Abram carry on their business, which runs thus : \" The stationer's shop (one oi \" the very old Elizabethan buildings now remaining in London) was sot \" about 120 years, up till 1840, the Old Post House, in Middle Temple \" Lane. Most of the great lawyers of the past 200 years have trodden \" its well- worn boards, as many of the principal ones in both branches of \" the profession do at the present time, and the books of the Old House \" bear record of many great Acts of State. Many of the most important \" Acts of Parliament, notably the Slave Trade Acts, were copied in the \" office, as also, at limes, other most important State documents. Lori \" Brougham, in the days before he became a peer and Lord Chancellor, \" was a frequent visitor,\" &c. The business connection of the firm is large, and extends all over the country. The premises present a very ancient appearance. There is a frontage of about 40 feet, the entrance or door into the shop being in a corner, while the shop is in a recess. The upper part of the building consists of four floors, each overlapping the other by several feet, in the old Elizabethan style, as Staples Inn does in Holborn. The business done consists of the eugrossing, copying, anil translating of deeds and documents, and deciphering aud copying old deeds, drawing plans, specifications for architects and surveyors, illumi nating addresses and ornamental writings of all kinds, printing in all its branches, particularly law priming, and books are occasion ally published by the firm, as they were generations ago. The \u00a3m) inserts advertisements in all the London, country, aud Continental papers, and translations are made when required. The business ha* been in the same family and name for several generations. The interior of the building has undergone little or no alteration since it was built, some three centuries and more ago. A large number of books pub- lished at this establishment in or about the year 1700 may still be seel, and some date before the Great Fire of London (which stopped close to the Temple Gate) in the year 1666. The business house of Abram 4 Sons may well be proud of its antiquity, and after a lapse of some 300 years it is still flourishing, and stands out most prominently amongst the confraternity of law scriveners and publishers as the most ancient of them all. Geo. Munday & Sons, Builders and Contractors, 8, Savage Gardens, E.C., and Islay Wharf, Poplar, E. \u2014 In a city of the great extent of London, it is evident that the building trade must be a very important branch of industry. Amongst the numerous firms engaged in this trade, that of Geo. Munday & Sons, which we have selected as the subject of this notice, is probably one of the oldest, inasmuch as the business was commenced by the grandfather of the present senior partner as far back as 1778. This firm has, until recently, confined its practice to what may be termed engineering work, viz., docks and canals, drainage and river work, bridges, gas and water works, but now, we believe, under takes, in addition to the above, most kinds of general building work. In the early days of railway construction, viz., from 1837 to 1841, the house executed a considerable amount of the work of the Great Eastern (then called the Eastern Counties) Line, but at that period its principal speciality was the construction of sewerage and drainage works, and some important matters were entrusted to and carried out by the firm ; for instance, con siderable works at Cheltenham, Cambridge, the City of London (in which most of the important main lines of sewerage were of the number), and in the urban parts of the counties of Surrey and Kent. In 1843-5, the house was employed by the Senate of Hamburg to construct the new system of sewerage introduced after the disastrous fire of 1842. In 1849 the firm entered into negotiations with the promoters of the Exhibition of 1851, and a provisional engagement was made, which \u2014 this method of proceeding not meeting with the approval of the Boyal Commission \u2014 became inoperative, and the house had no further share in the actual work of the undertaking, but was awarded a medal in recognition of the services rendered. In recent years the works undertaken by the firm"], [85, "MODEEN LONDON. 101 offices, where a large number of hands are employed. The business is very ably conducted under the personal direction of the proprietor. Daniel Greenaway, Letter-press and Lithographic Printer, Designer, Engraver, Wholesale and Export Stationer, 30, Camomile Street, E.C. \u2014 In the vanguard of the leading metropolitan printing firms a high position is held by the well-known house of D. Greenaway, whose head-quarters are centrally located. This business was established in 1857, and its career since has been of the most gratify ing kind. Mr. Greenaway has been fortunate in securing first-class premises. These consist of seven floors, and are fitted up in the most complete *manner with all modern machinery, and every mechanical requi site for the execution of high-class lithographic, and letter-press printing, engraving, general stationery, and patent account books. These are the departments into which the business is divided, and in each a trade of Witton & Witton, Pianoforte Makers, 32, Hanover Street, Islington, N. \u2014 Among the leading firms engaged in tbe manufacture of pianofortes is that of Messrs. Witton & Witton. The business was estab lished in 1 S40. The factory consists of a spacious building, fitted throughout with the most improved machinery and appliances. About fifty hands are engaged. The proprietors have produced some exceptionally- superior toned instruments. The firm make over eighteen pianofortes per week, and this number, although it does not sound very extensive, is more than several ofthe supposed leading houses can produce. Among the firm's specialities a very leading position is taken by their magnificent upright grands, which are full trichord, have a first-class French check action, and are finished in a highly elaborate an-d artistic style. Iu these pianofortes, as in those of some cottages, a very important feature is the overstrung iron frame. It is obvious that by this system a much longer string can be used, and the tone proportionately increased. Another speciality is the \" Hanover \" model, a first-class instrument that not only is a really good one, but also looks it. The firm have gained a first-class reputation throughout the trade for their very superior make and finish, and com mand a large and important business, both wholesale and retail. The \" Metropolitan \" Co-operative Pianoforte Club has been established in connection with this firm, by means of which members can obtain a realiy first-class pianoforte at wholesale prices, on the deferred payment system, without having to pay the usual 30 per cent, interest that the quarterly instalment method so often means. A stamped warranty for ten years is given with every instrument, and the club has met with great success in gaining the favour of the public. Messrs. Witton & Witton take a very prominent position among makers, and conduct a very thriving and successful business. John A. Woolnough & Sons, Bookbinders, Liners, leather Gilders, and Embossers for Cabinet Makers, 29, Hoxton Street, and 30, Hoxton Square, Curtain Boad, E.C. \u2014 Bookbinding and the various branches ofthe leather trade connected therewith give employ ment to a large number of operatives in the metropolis, and are depart ments of industry which have been brought to great perfection. One of the leading London houses in this trade is the noted firm of Messrs. John A. Woolnough & Sons. This is one of the oldest houses in the business to which it is devoted. It is over seventy-five years since the grandfather of the present junior partner laid the foundation of the business, whose career has since been one of uncheckered success. The premises occupied are very extensive, and are fitted in the most complete manner. The opera tions of the house are about equally divided between bookbinding and the manufacture of cabinet-makers' lining, leather gilding, embossing, and chair band making. Heraldic gilding on leather for chair backs is a very special feature with this firm, and a great variety of samples of this beautiful work may be seen executed in the best manner. The devices include, among many others, the royal arms, Prince of Wales' feathers, coronets, the arms of various corporate and municipal bodies, both home and foreign, and handsome leather bindings, with ornate gilding, chaste in design, and perfect in execution. Tables are lined and gilded by this firm. A. proof of excellence in this particular line may be adduced from the fact that tables so lined and gilded by them have found their way to the Sultan of Turkey, to foreign municipal halls, to our own Guild hall, to some of our most prominent public offices, and also to leading hotels. A noticeable feature again is the book-shelf fall edging, in leather, embossed and gilt, in various patterns and designs. The embossing and cutting of this edging is done in a very perfect manner by a machine specially adapted to the purpose, the edges particularly being turned out in a very finished manner. In all these branches a sound trade is done, and the connections are continually being augmented. immense proportions is done. The engraving of bank note--, cheques, eeals, share certificates, and similar commercial requisites, is a special feature of the business, in which an excellent reputation has been secured for high-class work. All sorts of general commercial printing are executed in first-class style. The show-cards made by the house are in great deuiand, owing to their many attractive features. Colour printing is a department iu which Mr. Greenaway excels. Designs are prepared and engraved, and every description of commercial and private stationery is manufactured on the premises in large quantities. A patent ledger has been introduced by the house, and its self-evident advantages have secured for it a wide patronage and steadily-increasing favour among bankers, merchants, insurance offices, aud mercantile firms and others. The connections of the firm are to be found in every part of the world, are very numerous and influential, especially in the British Isles, and are steadily increasing. The business is managed with consummate ability, and it is justly regarded as one of the most representative London printing houses, while its talented and industrious proprietor is greatly esteemed and respected in commercial circles. Joseph Armitage & Co., Tea Merchants, 20, Harp Lane, Great Tower Street, E.C. \u2014 Among the largest and most prominent im porters and wholesale dealers in teas in the metropolis is the firm of Messrs. Joseph Armitage & Co. This reliable house has now been in active operation for the past thirty-three years, ever maintaining, during the long intervening period to the present, the highest of reputations, both as regards the high character of the goods placed on the market, and the honourable methods which have characterised all their operations as im porters, receiving consignments of the choicest and most delicately flavoured grades that come to this market. They are also heavy buyers of other teas in the Mincing Lane market, and carry on an extensive business, supplying wholesale and retail tea dealers, both in London and throughout the provinces. The facilities of the house have expanded with the lapse of years since its establishment, insomuch so that the firm are not only able to promptly execute the largest orders, but to offer induce ments to buyers in the matter of low rates that with difficulty can be duplicated elsewhere. During the time that they have been engaged in the large business which their enterprise and energy have built up, they have secured a reputation for fair dealing and commercial honour that reflects most creditably upon the house, ranking it among the leading representatives of the mercantile industries of the City. J. Bonner & Co., Carpenters, &c, Finsbury Avenue, E.C. \u2014Messrs. J. Bonner & Co. are specially devoted to particular branches of the carpentering trade. Among the more important features of the busi ness is the manufacture of packing cases of all descriptions ; the firm have gained a first-class reputation for superiority and durability of work manship in this line. The manufacture of tin canisters, such as are used for packing tea, coffee, cocoa, rice, sago, &c. for export, is an important part of the business, in which a large trade is done. Messrs. Bonner also execute a great amount of work for the Government, especially in the manufacture of boxes, tables, and in other branches of carpenters' work. The premises occupied consist of spacious workshops, warehouses, and"], [86, "102 MODEEN LONDON. Ryan & Nephew, Saddlers and Harness Manufacturers, 14 and 15, Spring Street, Westbourne Terrace, Hyde Park, W. \u2014 Few industries have attained greater perfection, or a more deserved reputation, in the metropolis than the manufacture of fine saddlery and harness ; and in this connection it is a pleasure to make prominent mention of such an old-established and well-known firm as that of Messrs. Ryan & Nephew. This business was founded forty-six years ago, and from its very inception has enjoyed a prosperous career, a fact which speaks more than volumes for the excellence of the firm's manufactures and the liberal methods which have always characterised the management of their affairs. The premises occupied are of spacious dimensions, with workshops at the rear, where a staff of competent workmen is constantly employed. The firm manu facture and keep in stock every description of best saddlery, harness, horse clothing, stable brushes, and stable requisites of all kinds. The saddlery and harness made by Messrs.

The firm are patronised by the nobility and gentry in town and country. Their goods have always maintained the highest reputation for superior quality. The members of the firm are enterprising and thoroughly reliable business men in all their transactions, and thoroughly merit the success attending their efforts. spacious workshops, with large yard at the rear.

The business was established in 1829. The management throughout is conducted with exceptional ability and energy, and com mands a very widespread and valuable reputation. evidence of the ability and enterprise of its pro prietors, is that of Messrs.

The firm are heavy buyers in the London market of all grades of tea, but, as agents of the Pagoda Ceylon Company, they devote special atten tion to the imports from India and Ceylon, in which thev are interested. The trade mark of the Pagoda Tea Company may 'be taken as a guarantee of the special Ceylon blends. The teas of this company are also made up in leaded packets, which keep out the air and moisture, thus preserving the full flavour and strength of the leaf. A large business is done in meeting the demands of a high-class clientele among the leading provincial grocers and retaU tea dealers. The quality and purity of teas being so much dependent upon the responsibility and honour of the firm through whom they are obtained, dealers find it profitable to procure supplies from houses like the one under review, whose long-established reputation make their representations perfectly reliable.

The premises occupied comprise head-quarters at 58, City Boad, E.C., consisting of a large and commodious building of five floors and a basement, measuring about 120 feet in depth by 50 feet frontage, the whole divided into offices, show rooms, and factory, together with extensive workshops in Bell Yard, Eeatherstone Street, and at Craven Street, N. Messrs. Baker engage very largely in the production of bread-making machinery and ovens, biscuit machinery and ovens, and all descriptions of mechanical apparatus for the making of confectionery and chocolate in all its various forms. In these important lines the firm have perfected and patented many valuable inventions and improvements. The accompanying illustration, representing a working model of a bread well as their novelty, ingenuity, and design, and the bakers' and con fectioners' trades owe much to this enterprising house for the adequate manner in which it has met a number of long-felt requirements. Messrs. Baker & Sons employ power in each of their works and valuable plant in all their manufacturing operations, and retain a staff of between 100 and 200 skilled workmen and artisans. Their business is conducted with all that praiseworthy energy and vigour which have made it the representative industrial feature it is to-day. and biscuit factory, which was specially made for and exhibited at the Manchester Exhibition of 1887, will give our readers some idea of the machines manufactured by this firm. A glance at the illustration will show the mixers, brakes, kneaders, cutting machines, beaters, sifting machines, fruit cleaners, and ovens as they appear in working order ; and to anyone practically conversant with the bread and biscuit manufac turing trades, this picture will be of unusual interest. The manufactures of Messrs. Baker are widely noted for their soundness of construction, as tion and manufacture of cork, and the articles into which this substance so largely enters, is one which occupies a by no means insignificant position. In this branch of commerce the well-known firm of Messrs. S. & A. White & Co., of London and Liverpool, occupies a prominent place. This firm has now been most extensively engaged in the cork business for the past seven years, both as wholesale and retail merchants. The premises are very extensive, and comprise a large four-storied warehouse, with workshops. A large staff is constantly employed. This firm imports most extensively from Spain and Portugal, and holds a very large and valuable stock. Messrs. S. & A. White & Co. do a very large and rapidly increasing business, and have a first-class connection with brewers, wine and spirit merchants, preserve and pickle manufacturers, mineral water manufacturers, &c. The business is conducted with great enterprise, and ranks among the most influential houses in the trade. A. J. Smith & Co., Wines, Spirits, Liqueurs, Beer, and Tea, 259, Edgware Boad, W. \u2014 The wholesale and retail trade in wines and liquors constitutes a most important branch of commercial activity in all parts of the metropolis. Among tbe leading firms in the trade is that of Messrs. A. J. Smith & Co. They have been established many years, and their business has steadily increased. The firm has branch establishments at the following places :\u2014 8, Harrow Boad, Paddington; 28 and 30, King Street, Hammersmith ; 84, King's Boad, Chelsea; 456, Harrow Boad; 178, High Eoad, Kilburn; 223, Walworth Eoad; 66, St. John's Eoad, Clapham Junction ; and High Street (facing the Green), Ealing. At each of these there is kept an extensive, well-selected stock of wines, spirits, liqueurs, cordials, beers, teas, and coffees. Their warehouse and stores are at 15, Irongate Wharf Boad, Paddington, where large quantities of goods are kept for the supply of their various branches. Here also a numerous staff is engaged in the various processes of bottling the wines, spirits, and beers. Messrs. A. J. Smith & Co. have lately introduced special blends of Irish and Scotch whiskies, under the registered brands of \" Ireland's Eye \" and \" Ben-y-Gloe,\" which are likely to take their place among the best of the bottled whiskies in the market. The firm has won an excellent reputation for supplying the best goods at lowest market prices. The members of the firm are enterprising and thoroughly capable business men, and are meeting with well-merited success. Price lists can be had on application, Butler, Nephew, & Co., Port Wine Shippers, 24, Crutched Friars, E.C., and at Oporto. \u2014 The oldest established, and one of the leading houses actively engaged as port wine shippers, is that identified with the honoured name of Butler, Nephew, & Co. The business con- a ducted by the firm was established in Oporto about 1730, and -Tr^r for upwards of a century- and a half has maintained a foremost Xt Tillk iQ tfie trade as importers and dealers in the finer grades O of port wines. They are proprietors of very extensive stores in Oporto, where they hold large stocks of the finest and oldest classes of wines. They occupy eligible premises for the conduct of their home trade at Crutched Friars. Messrs. Butler, as may be inferred, are too widely known to require further comment at our hands, and are well worthy of the high degree of esteem and respect to which they- have attained in City trade circles.

John Alderson, Manufacturer of Ropes, Lines, Twines, Box and Chest Cords and Firewood Tyers, and Stove Orna ments, Marsh Gate Lane, Stratford, London, E. \u2014 One of the most promi nent houses in its line is that of Mr. John Alderson. Originally established at Old Ford, it has been carried on at the present address for twenty two years. The premises comprise large works, covering a large area, aud fitted with every convenience. The firm gives employment to a large staff of competent assistants. The great feature of this establishment is the manufacture of all kinds of hand-made ropes, lines, and twines. It is one of the few houses in London who carry on their trade by hand work only. There are many kinds of line and cord, and also various specialities in the trade, that are made by hand only, and which cannot be successfully made by machinery, and many of the machine line and cord manufacturers frequently have to depend ou this firm for various specialities which they may be asked for in their ordinary routine of business. The house frequently has its resources taxed to the utmost to meet with punctuality the enormous demands made upon it for this class of goods. A special department is that of supplying firewood tyers (or a twine for tying up firewood bundles), and a large and increasing trade is done in this speciality. Mr. Alderson is also engaged in the manufacture of mats, matting, &c, and Manilla and Victoria grass stove ornaments, for which he has secured a great reputation. The business is conducted by Mr. J. Alderson with admirable energy and ability, and he has succeeded in placing his establishment in the first ranks of the rope aud twine industry. Thornton & Son, Auctioneers, Surveyors, and Valuers, 15, Coleman Street, E.C. \u2014 In tracing the career of firms of note in the commercial world it is always interesting to mark the difficulties which have been contended with, and it should prove instructive to observe the manner in which these difficulties have been surmounted. Bead the lives of eminent statesmen, of great generals, of successful business men, and it is generally found that their advance has been due in a very great measure to a powerful determination to succeed, coupled with the posses sion of undoubted ability and a ready adaptability to circumstances. Unfortunately, in the\u00abe competitive times of the nineteenth century, there are too many persons who, instead of determining to overcome an obstacle and endeavouring to prove themselves equal to an emergency, immediately- lose heart on the appearauce of some difficulty, and allow whatever ability they possess to fall into a lethargic state \u2014 the sure fore runner of failure. But the busy, persevering man \u2014 he who works from early dawn till fading night \u2014 he who is ever anxious as to the result of his exertions \u2014 this is the man who makes his way in the world, and who well deserves the prosperity he labours so arduously to obtain. An instance in point may be mentioned by taking a glance at the history of the firm of Messrs. Thornton & Son, auctioneers, surveyors, and valuers, of No. 15, Coleman Street, E.C. Mr. William Blamyre Thornton, the present head of the firm, was originally educated for the Church, but before taking orders, discovered that the vocation which he had studied for would not afford him sufficient scope for the exercise of those remarkable abilities which subsequeut years proved him to possess. Dispelling all thoughts from his mind of entering the Church, he determined to devote himself to a commercial career. Accordingly he associated himself as partner with a foreign bank, the headquarters of which were in France, having a branch establishment in London, and for upwards of eight years he was engaged in travelling backwards and forwards between London and Paris, labouring indefatigably in the development and extension of the influence of the institution with which he was connected. The outbreak ofthe Franco- German War in 1870 seriously impeded the progress of the bank, such heavy losses being incurred through the war that it soon became evident that their capital would be insufficient to carry on the business, and with an action which was exceedingly praiseworthy, they stopped soon enough to meet all their liabilities in full. Undaunted by this sudden reverse of fortune, he returned to England and established himself as partner with a gentleman iu an auctioneer's and surveyor's business. Finding his partner was one ofthe dormant old-school type, void of energy and enter prise, Mr. Thornton forfeited his interest in the business, and in 1876 opened an establishment at No. 1, Finsbury Pavement, City, as an auctioneer and surveyor. At first the business was very limited, but by that indomitable will which characterises his every action, he rapidly developed an extensive connection amongst the leading commercial houses, and the principal brewers, distillers, &c. It is in this latter branch of the business \u2014 the valuation of breweries, distilleries, hotel and public-house properties \u2014 that he has achieved such marked success, and it was owing to this rapid increase of business that a removal was necessitated to more extensive offices at No. 15, Coleman Street \u2014 offices which, by the way, are as handsomely furnished a suite of rooms as will be found in the City. An extensive business is now done in transferring property, both public and private, the clientele of the firm extending not only all over the United Kingdom, but to all parts of the world. Some two years since Mr. Thornton took his son into partnership, and under their joint administrative ability the affairs of the firm are now conducted. Notwith standing the great claims made by business upon Mr. Thornton, he has found time to write an admirable little work entitled, \" How to succeed in a Public-house,\" a book which has proved to be extremely useful to hundreds and \u2014 if one may judge by the circulation \u2014 to thousands of men who were desirous of entering the public line of business, but who were in doubt as to the best medium to adopt to bring about the desired transfer of an hotel or public-house. Mr. Thornton is a member of a syndicate En the City for the promotion of companies for erecting and purchasing hotels and similar property, and in this sphere his influence over financial connections has proved to be of great utility, not only in the furtherance of the objects ofthe syndicates, but in giving a tone and vigour to their Tarious schemes. He was the chief promoter of a poweiful syndicate, with a capital of 110,000/., for the floating of the Victoria Hotel at Man- chester, than which there is no handsomer or more ornate hotel in the world. He is also a promiment member in a syndicate which acquired the old, valuable, and world-famed distillery of Hollands & Co., Limited, the capital in this case being 350,000/., and he is now actively engaged in forming a company for the purchase of the Waterloo and Clarence Hotels at Manchester. These are but a few of the undertakings in which Mr. Thornton has been engaged, still they will be sufficient to show that he is a gentleman of high status in the commercial and financial world. To courage, energy, and determination \u2014 qualities which all Englishmen admire \u2014 the success of Messrs. Thornton & Son has been largely due, and by the judicious exercise of an active, honourable spirit, which is perceptible in all the transactions of the firm, they have secured the confidence and esteem of a clientele that is unequalled by any other house in the same profession. G. Chant, Cabinet Manufacturer, 71 and 73, Leonard Street, City Boad, E.C. \u2014 A very widely noted and important business devoted to cabinet making, &c. is in the proprietorship of Mr. G. Chant, wholesale cabinet manufacturer. This business has been established about twelve years, and a very extensive trade has been developed among the leading houses in the furnishing trade throughout the United Kingdom and colonies. The premises occupied by the proprietor are at 71 and 73, Leonard Street, City Boad, and include spacious workshops, ware houses, and showrooms. The business of manufacturing is carried on at No. 73, the whole of the building being fitted with the most modern appliances that have been designed for use in this description of trade. A large uumber of hands are employed, and from the high-class nature of the work in which the firm are engaged, these have been selected from the most skilled artizans in the trade. No. 71 is devoted to the purposes of a showroom, and contains a very extensive and valuable stock of goods of very superior manufacture, both as to material and workmanship. Unlike many so-called manufacturers, Mr. Chant exhibits nothing but what be actually makes, and he is therefore enabled to guarantee the durability of the workmanship. The firm devote special attention to the manufacture of sideboards, &c, which constitute a leading feature of tbe business. The stock includes many highly artistic specimens of the firm's work in this branch. The proprietor has studiously avoided any connection with what is generally understood by the term of the \" cheap \" trade, the work executed at this establishment being rigidly confined to the highest class. Most of the designs have been introduced specially by this firm, the proprietor directing particular attention to the pro duction of artistic novelties. In every department of the business the valuable stock displays the ability and skill that has been exercised in design and workmanship, and the firm bears a reputation that is cer tainly unsurpassed in the trade. A very extensive business is done in supplying the leading wholesale and retail houses throughout the king dom, and the establishment is widely noted both in the metropolis and the provinces. W. Collins, Builder, Decorator, Plumber, Gasfitter, and General House Repairer, 169, Bow Boad, E. \u2014 Among the many houses devoted to this branch of trade, a very prominent position is held by that under the control of Mr. W. Collins, whose head-quarters are situated at the above address. This widely-known establishment has been but two years in its present position, but the business was founded many years ago, and has always maintained a good reputation. The premises occupied are of considerable extent, and consist of work yard and offices atlached. A numerous and highly skilled staff of workmen are constautly employed iu executing the various contracts with which Mr. Collins is entrusted. The operations of the house em brace building in all its branches, plain and ornamental decorating of every kind, plumbing and gasfitting, and all sorts of work coming under the head of general repairs. Plumbing, painting, carpentering, white washing, bricklaying and plastering, the prevention of water waste, paper hanging, the fitting of gas and baths in all styles, and the putting up of coppers, ranges, and copper sets, are all undertaken and carried through in a manner perfect in every detail. Cisterns are fitted and repaired, and sanitary work of every description is executed iu the best style. The stock is very large, and embraces all sorts of general fittings in connection with the foregoing branches of work \u2014 gas globes aud fittings, brackets and piping. In spring cleaning, painting, and repairing the repute of the house could not be surpassed. High quality, cleanli ness, and cheapness are characteristic of everything done by the firm, which is conducted on the best commercial lines, and is eminently worthy of the conspicuous success it has attained."], [89, "MODERN LONDON. 105 Arthur Allison & Co., Pianoforte Manufacturers, Leighton Boad, N.W. \u2014 Long known as the name of Allison has been in connection with the manufacture of pianofortes, a brief recital of the cir cumstances attending the establishment of the firm of Arthur Allison & Co. may not be uninteresting. Originally founded by Eobert and Thomas Allison, with Balph Allison as manager and foreman, under the title of Allison & Allison, the firm dissolved partnership in the year 1848, Eobert carrying on business in Eegent Street, and Thomas in Dean Street, whilst Balph Allison established himself in Wardour Street. Thomas died about the year 1851, and Eobert, who is still living, retired from the trade. Balph Allison, after establishing a very successful business, died in 1864, leaving three sons, John, Balph, and James. Balph dying iu 1872, the business was carried on by John, at whose death, in 1883, the stock and trade mark were sold by auction, the latter being purchased by a limited liability company. Mr. James Arthur Allison, the sole surviving son of Balph Allison, in conjunction with his partner, Mr. Walter S. Murdoch, had previously established the present firm of Arthur Allison & Co., at Apollo Works, Leighton Boad, Kentish Town. Mr. James Arthur Allison retired from the firm some short time ago, and the business is now the property of Mr. Walter S. Murdoch, who is ably assisted by his two sons, one of whom has obtained a large amount of experience in Chickerino-s, and the largest piano factories in the United States. From the com- racteristic, forgetting altogether the questions of tone, touch, and durability. Messrs. Arthur Allison & Co. gained the prize medal for good tone of pianos at the Exhibition of 1885, and anyone who has heard their piano fortes must admit it was well deserved. That no effort is wanting to maintain their pre-eminent position, the excellence of tone and elegance of design, displayed alike in the striking upright grand of the drawing room and the modest but not less effective cottage piano, are sufficient warranty from an artistic point, as the numerous recurring orders from pianoforte dealers throughout the United Kingdom and abroad are satis factory from a commercial one. Wallis, Sons, & Lidstone, Provision Importers, Custom House and Wool Quay, Lower Thames Street, E.C. \u2014 The importation of all descriptions of provisions is a very important branch of commerce that occupies the attention of many of the largest and most influential houses in the City. Among these a very prominent position is held by the well-known firm of Messrs. Wallis, Sons, & Lidstone, which has been established about fifteen years. It is essentially a representative house in this trade, dealing largely in all branches of the business and importing on a very extensive scale from various parts abroad. A great proportion of the trade is done in all kinds of provisions from Ireland and the Continent, extending as far north as Finland, from America, New Zealand, and Australia. In each of these directions the trade has very largely increased of late years, owing to the increased inability of the home production to meet even a fairly large proportion of the want. As the population in creases in this country, so must the provision trade become more and more important. The firm above forms a most notable factor in the trade, few houses dealing so extensively in all classes of goods. The proprietors devote considerable attention to dairy produce, and especially to Danish, French, and colonial butters, which they import in large quantities. Mar garine is also an important feature, in which the firm have achieved wide spread renown. Their spacious cellarage offers great advantages for the importation of hams and bacon. These come principally from Denmark and America, and also from Ireland, the latter being of very superior quality. The firm's trade is solely confined to the wholesale department, and they supply wholesale merchants only. Within these limits their connection extends to all parts of the kingdom, and is constantly in creasing in all directions. They occupy very spacious premises by the side of the Thames, having one ofthe finest cellarages in London, which thus affords every facility for the goods being brought direct to the depot by water, and stored in cool in the hottest weather. It is also in the centre of the provision market, being opposite the Exchange, where the firm do a large amount of business. They are constantly receiving large consign ments of produce from all parts of the world. In every department the firm have gained a great reputation for the admirable quality of the goods dealt in, and by this means they have developed one of the largest and most successful businesses in the trade. Puerst Bros., Merchants, 4, Copthall Buildings, E.C.\u2014 Among the large and influential mercantile nouses for which the metro- polis is so widely famed, there are few that have attained such a measure of success and popularity as that of Messrs. Fuerst Bros. This firm was fmnded in 1884. The partners in this firm, Messrs. Joseph F. Fuerst aud Jules Fuerst, are importers and exporters of oils, chemicals, and drugs, wholesale druggists, and oil merchants, and have developed a very extensive trade in every branch. They are already widely known, and hold an excellent position both in the home and foreign markets and on the Exchange. Their monthly price current is one of the most complete publications of this description extant, and has to a very great extent been the means of placing the firm in the position they now occupy. In com- piling this, the particular object the firm have sought to attain has been to have on their list articles of every-day requirements. The result of this has been to make their price current a kind of work of reference that is much sought after, and the proprietors have frequently been complimented upon and thanked for its publication. Many valuable chemicals and acids are included in this list that it would be difficult to find in any other single publication. Taking the trade throughout into consideration, the chief spe- cialities are Castor Oil, Olive Oil, Nut and Sesame Oil, Befined Camphor, and Special AVines and Spirits for Medicinal Purposes. There are also botanic drugs, pharmacy extracts generally, animal and mineral oils, and perfumery extracts, in addition to various heavy chemicals, minerals, metals, &c. Dairy preparations also form an important branch ofthe trade, and include such as butter and cheese colouring and flavouring. The trade is entirely with wholesale houses, and there is hardly a branch of industry con- ducted in the United Kingdom to which one or more of Fuerst's specialities or ordinary commodities are not requisite. In most of the principal Thames wharves there are large quantities of the firm's imports stored, awaiting the instructions of the customers who have ordered them. Messrs. Fuerst's connection extends to all parts of the United Kingdom and colonies among the principal wholesale houses. In addition to the home trade, an enormous amount of business is done through the medium of the export department. The premises in London comprise a handsomely fitted suite of offices, where a large and efficient staff is engaged. Through out every detail and department of the trade the business is conducted upon sound commercial principles, and with exceptional ability and energy. The telephone number ofthe firm is 462. raencement the business made rapid strides, the care and attention shown in the construction of the instruments appealing at once to, and ensuring a lasting hold upon, the favour of the musical world. The premises occupied by Messrs. Arthur Allison are very extensive, and are fitted throughout with all the most improved machinery and appliances incidental to the manufacture. A large staff is engaged, selected from the most skilled artizans in the trade, and the workmanship exhibited in every article emanating from this firm is of the highest class. Messrs. Arthur Allison & Co. are exceptionally successful in regard to the question of tone, and it would be impossible to find any firm producing instruments superior in this respect, while, on the other hand, it would not be easy to find more than a very few that are even equal. One of their specialities, style L, is a really first-class instrument, with great power of tone and durability, splendidly constructed, with iron frame, trichord throughout, and finished in a superior style in rosewood walnut, or ebonized and gold cases. One of the firm's latest novelties is the \" Japanese Model.\" The speciality of this instrument consists in the unique designs of its panels, which have been specially executed in Japan for Messrs. Allison. So high are the artistic merits of these designs, that several members of the aristocracy have purchased the panels by themselves, and after getting them, have placed on the walls of their private galleries. The firm's success has been achieved by the exercise of able and energetic managerial ability, and by conscientiously producing a first-class instrument adapted to the require ments of the public.

The claims of the year arose in respect of 102 policies insuring 82 lives for 58,033/. 13s. 4</.; and to this sum was added in bonuses 20,187/. 10s. Comparing the actual claims with those expected, the amount called for and paid was 16,122/. less than was anticipated; and the average bonus paid on each 100/. assured on the with-profit scale, where the bonuses had not been com muted or otherwise applied, was 41/. As. The funds of the society are securely invested, largely in Government, railway, and mortgages of freehold ground rents and house property, and these investments are yielding a satisfactory average rate of interest which materially swells the total gross revenue. With regard to the nature of the society's business operations little can be said, in view of the age and well known high standing of the institution, that is not already fairly familiar to the insuring public in general. Undoubtedly the great point to be considered by members holding with-profit policies is the annual valuation of assets and liabilities and the yearly apportioning of profits to participating members. This is, obviously, one of the prime advantages ofthe society's strictly mutual system. There are also many other meritorious features in the status of the company, not the least im portant of these being the fact that every policy is unconditionally and absolutely free and indisputable after it has been in force five years, and the life assured has attained the age of thirty years ; no extra premium is then charged for climatic or war risk in any part of the world. The premiums in all instances are moderate, and especially so at the younger ages ; and, after eight annual payments have been made, the bonus can be applied to reduce the premiums of with-profit policies. It is also note worthy that the society's surrender values are very liberal ; and that a policy which has lapsed by non-payment of the premium within the allowed days of grace (thirty days for an annual and fifteen days for a half-yearly policy) may be revived at any time without the production of a certificate of the good health of the life assured, so long as the unpaid premiums, with interest and fine, do not exceed the surrender value. Policies which have lapsed since the 1st January 1887 may be revived at any time, on the same conditions. The society is prepared to grant loans on policies almost to the full extent of the surrender value, provided such value does not stand lower than 5/. ; and also upon freehold property in the United Kingdom in sums of not less than 500/., and on life interests, reversions, or incomes legally assignable, together with a policy effected with the society of, at least, an equal amount. The financial position of the Mutual Life Assurance Society is indisputably strong ; the directorate is of a most influential and eminently reputable character ; and there is no liability at- taching to membership in the society, the company's deed of settlement precluding by its well-defined terms and conditions any such possibility. The scope of the society's business is widespread and comprehensive ; and the organisation has always enjoyed a splendid reputation for the prompti \" tude and liberality of its claim settlements. The offices of the society are very large and commodious, being situate in one of the handsomest and most spaciousbusiness structures in King Street, Cheapside; and here a numerous and efficient staff is engaged, operating under the most able managerial supervision, including that of Mr. Hubert G. Bowsell, the secretary, and Mr. Henry William Manly, F.I. A., the actuary, who is acknowledged to stand in the front rank of the actuarial profession. All things considered, there is no British institution of its kind more worthy of the complete con- fidence of the insuring classes of the land ; and there is certainly none that has, during a long and prosperous career, more steadfastly proved the justice of its claim to such confidence by unfailing efforts in the behalf of all its members aud constant consultation of their best interests in every respect and particular. Messrs. Henry F. Joel & Co., City Electric Light Works, 31, Wilson Street, Finsbury, E.C. \u2014 For nearly ten years a post of much note and distinction among London firms engaged in electrical engineering has been held by Messrs. Henry F. Joel & Co., proprietors and controllers of the well-known City Electric Light Works. The premises occupied comprise spacious showrooms, warerooms, and work shops, in the latter of which a numerous staff is employed. Messrs. Joel & Co. are well known by reason of their important inventions and advances in electric lighting. Their improvements on the Pilsen arc lamp have achieved exceptionally brilliant success. Iu connection with this branch of their business Messrs. Joel have developed many valuable specialities, among which are a particularly efficient and durable Patent Engine Dynamo, for supplying light by electricity to houses, ships, &c, and the \" Practical \" Battery, for supplying reading lamps, night lamps, surgical lamps, &c. Accumlators, incandescent or glow lamps, and a com plete assortment of accessories for every department of electric lighting are also held in stock in large quantities ; while as a means of economically obtaining effective motive power the Beck Gas Engine (Bollason's patent), equipped with all the latest scientific improvements, is a speciality which has secured widespread recognition. Messrs. Joei & Co.'s installations of electric lighting plant and apparatus have been largely adopted through out the kingdom ; and their Semi-Incandescence Lamp obtained a silver medal and a goid medal at the Electrical Exhibitions of Paris and London, respectively, in 1881 and 1882. Another very noteworthy branch of this firm's business is the manufacture and fitting up of pneumatic and electric house and ship bells. To this important class of work much attention has been devoted, and the results achieved have been extremely satisfactory. Four patents have been taken out by Mr. Joel in pneumatic bells, and the productions of the house in this respect have been fitted up in Her Majesty's Office of Works, in public buildings, hotels, schools, residences, mercantile establishments, and on many steamships, in all of which instances they have given unqualified satisfaction. Further specialities of the house consist in engine-room telegraphs for ships, and a variety of signalling apparatus in which much gratifying success has been achieved, and also in thief detectors or burglar alarms, fire alarms, and fire and police calls. The firm devote particular attention to the installa- tion of electric light systems for photographic purposes. The premises in Wilson Street are maintained in excellent order, and the large, compre- hensive, and valuable stocks there held are kept in the best of condition, constantly ready for despatch to any destination. The business is per- sonally conducted with care, ability, and pronounced success by its enterprising proprietor, Mr. Henry F. Joel, who has built up for his representative house a widespread and valuable connection. A prosperous branch has also been established in Melbourne, through the agency of which the firm have become favourably known throughout the Australian colonies. The Mutual Life Assurance Society, 39, King Street, Cheapside, E.C. \u2014 The Mutual Life Assurance Society, one of the oldest and most notable of English insurance institutions of its particular kind, was established in 1834 with the object of affording to its members every advantage obtainable from the proper working ofthe mutual system of life assurance. This object involved adherence to two fundamental principles of operation \u2014 (1) That the sum assured by every policy is to be a first charge upon the life assurance fund ; and (2) That an equitable share of the profits up to the year of the death of each with-profit member is to be paid with the sum assured by his policy. These principles have been closely followed out, and to their faithful exemplification and the bond of confidence thereby established between the society and its members \u2014 whose interests, of course, go hand in hand \u2014 must be attributed the notable success achieved by tbe organisation. Indeed, so confident were the pro jectors of the society in its ultimate success, that they started it upon its business career some fifty -three years ago without any subscribed capital, thus obviating the necessity of paying dividends to shareholders, who do not exist in connection with this company ; and, in view of the fact that by this means the fullest consideration was shown for the interests of those who might become members \u2014 i.e., policy-holders \u2014 it is gratifying to note that these anticipations of future prosperity have been in every respect amply realised. In this connection, witness a few figures: At the close ofthe society's first financial year the life assurance fund amounted to 3,328/., or 3/. 8s. llrf. per cent, on the sum assured. At the close of the last financial year (February 1887) the life fund had grown to the remark able total of 1,163,958/. or 42/. 12s. 6d. per cent, on the sum assured. When it is remembered that in a general way 33^ per cent, (or 33/. 6s. Sd. per cent.) upon the sum assured is considered a fair or requisite average to be shown by the life fund of an assurance office, it will be seen that the above percentage of the \" Mutual Life \" is of a particularly gratifying magnitude. The steady growth of the society's business since 1834, as illustrated by the few figures given above, is fully indicative of the able and judicious manner in which the affairs of the association have been ad ministered, and is a pleasing justification of the confidence reposed in the enterprise alike by its far-seeing projectors and by the discriminating public. The directors report presented to the members at the fifty-third annual general meeting, held on February 16th, 1887, was of a most satisfactory- nature. By it was shown that during the year just then closed 426 proposals for assurance, amounting to 230,060/., were submitted Finsbury Park Machine Co., 216 aud 218, Seven Sisters Eoad, Finsbury Park, N. \u2014 There is probably no business of modern times that has made more rapid strides in importance than the domestic machine trade. In this connection it is but fair to make mention of the extensive and comprehensive concern presided over by Mr. Henry Luckett, whose commanding corner premises are conveniently situated, and are popularly known as the \" Finsbury Park Machine Co.\" This business was estab lished five years ago, and from its inception it has made a most favourable impression on all who have been interested in its operations. It is a recognised agency for every kind of sewing machine, aud for the laundry machinery of \" Harper Twelvetrees.\" There is no house in the metropolis where a better selection of any labour-saving machine is procurable. The stock is very large, and prices are reasonably moderate. Large cash discounts are allowed, or, if preferred, instalments are received, the goods being delivered on the first payment, carriage free. A free trial at home is permitted before purchase. A most comprehensive business has been built up, and conutry orders, which are also delivered carriage free, are extensive and rapidly increasing. Mr. Luckett is a gentleman of long experience in this class of business, and his untiring zeal and energy, together with the guaranteed quality of the goods sold, are sufficient to earn for the establishment universal esteem. The business has also a branch establishment at 150, Kentish Town Boad, N.W."], [91, "MODEEN LONDON. 107 Shoobert & Grove, Wine Merchants, Halfmoon Street, Bishopsgate, E.C. \u2014 One of the oldest-established houses in the wine trade is that of Messrs. Shoobert & Grove, whose business was founded in 1800. \" your obedient servants, Arthur Hill Hassell, M.D., Loud., Ebury Gcdwin \"Clayton, F.C.S. \u2014 To Messrs. J. B. Freeman & Son.\" Employment is provided for a large staff. Special attention is devoted to hand-made cigars. The proprietors are men of long standing in the trade, and their untiring enterprise and high business capacity have earned for them widespread support. Throughout its entire career it has always remained in the hands of the same family. The business consists in bottling wines, spirits, and other liquors, both for the home trade and export, and private families. It is well known that wines improve and increase in value according to the length of time that they may have been in bottle. Few people give any thought to the immense outlay of capital incidental to this trade. Wines to the value of thousands of pounds are often bottled aud stored away for ten, twenty, even thirty years, and represent, therefore, an enormous amount of capital. Messrs. Shoobert & Grove occupy a very prominent position among wine merchants and bottlers. Their trade is essentially a comprehensive one, and the manner in which they conduct their business enables them to meet the requirements of all classes of consumers. They import the most renowned brands, as well as good useful lines, at moderate prices, and command a very exten sive business in bottling these for the The London and Glasgow Tea Importers Association, 12, Fenchurch Street, E.C. \u2014 Early in the year 1887 was founded the London and Glasgow Tea Importers Association, an organisation which has taken up and successfully held a position of much prominence in the London tea trade. The proprietary of the association consists in a com bination of wholesale tea dealers, and its object is the supplying of retail dealers and grocers throughout the United Kingdom with the best classes of tea direct from the plantations of India, China, and Ceylon. The retailer thus secures his goods at a lower price than usual, and is able to obtain first-crop teas instead of those of the third picking. Everyone who is in any degree conversant with the methods of tea planting knows that the entire \" plant \" of a garden is subjected in one season to three pickings. The first of these takes place when the leaf is young and in its finest con dition ; the second collects the best of what is left over from the first ; and the third, which does not take place until much of the leaf has lost its inherent sap and virtue, secures little else than dead, dry, and mouldy material \u2014 in fact, mere sweepings. It is this latter class of tea which is sold frequently at such ridiculously low prices. The praiseworthy en deavour of the association now under notice is to supply the retailer with a leaf that will prove to be its own recommendation. A marked degree of success has thus far attended the operations of the concern, and it is pleasing to note in this fact a readiness in the trade to recognise and support all worthy efforts to elevate the tone and standard of this, one of the most important lines of British commercial enterprise. The London and Glasgow Tea Importers Association occupy spacious and commodious offices and salerooms ; and at 17, Philpot Lane, close by, they hold a large quantity of superior tea in warehouse. They are also proprietors of the Angapore Tea Estate. Travellers are employed, who visit all parts of the United Kingdom, and a very extensive and im portant trade is controlled, which takes growing effect among retailers throughout the metropolis and provinces. The association has received the most flattering criticisms from influential Press organs ; and the affairs of the association are most capably conducted, the main principles of its existence being constantly held in view by the management. Upon this basis it has thoroughly succeeded in winning the confidence and support of a large section of that department ofthe tea trade to which it is its object to cater. trade and private families. Their premises in Halfmoon Street are admir ably adapted to this purpose, and also for warehousing wines, which they undertake at very low rates. An efficient staff is engaged. In addition to dealing with wines, they supply bottles of every description to wine merchants, and they also do a large business in bottling spirits. A large trade is done both in the United Kingdom and abroad, the firm having a very widespread and influential connection in all parts. The business has always ranked among the best houses, and with a first-class reputation of nearly ninety years' standing, the firm is one of the most thriving and successful among those similarly engaged. J. R. Freeman & Son, Tobacco and Cigar Manufac- turers, 172, 174, and 176, St. John's Boad, Hoxton, N. \u2014 Tobacco, snuff, and cigar manufacturers have long occupied a most prominent place in the mercantile circles of the metropolis. A thoroughly representative concern is that carried on by Messrs. J. B. Freeman & Son, whose neat and spacious premises are conveniently situated as above. This well- known business was established so far back as 1853, and from the very date of its origin has made rapid strides in public confidence, and con- tinues still to develop itself with gratifying rapidity. There is no firm in the trade that has made greater progress, nor one that can point to a more influential patronage. The factory and offices are most commodious, and admirably adapted for the operations of an extensive business, all the arrangements being of a most systematic character. Messrs. Freeman & Son are entitled to special mention as the absolute representative manu- facturing firm of British brands of cigars, which are of the highest quality and most finished make. This important industry owes its improvement and development to the zeal, attention, skill, and untiring energy of the firm, one of whom was examined before a select committee of the House of Commons as an expert, to give his views as to the use of fraudulent trade marks in connection with the cigar industry. The evidence then given by Mr. Freeman tended to hasten much-needed legislation in this direction. Another noted feature with this firm is the special attention given to that all-essential matter, \" maturing,\" upon which so much depends. A. T. Booth's Patent Process is adopted, by which great saving in time is effected, a uniformity in the maturing of each cigar is guaran- teed, and the fine flavour and fragrance is not impaired, as is invariably the case when gas, steam, or hot water are used. The two following analytical testimonials sufficiently prove that the plan followed by this firm is the correct one : \u2014 \" 32, Brook Street, Holborn, E.C., September \" 16th, 1885. Sirs, \u2014 I have carefully examined the cigars matured by Mr. \" A. T. Booth's Process. I find that no injurious substances have been \" introduced into them by it, the moisture more uniformly- and perfectly \" removed, and the alkaloids are not affected. The analysis also \" proves that the cigars are made of a very high-class tobacco. \u2014 Yours \" faithfully, Eobert Alison, Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry, late Assis- \" tant Chemist to the War Department.\u2014 To Messrs. J. B. Freeman & Son.\" \" Chemical Laboratory, 54, Holborn Viaduct, London, E.C., October 7th, \" 1885. Gentlemen, \u2014 As the result of a careful examination ofthe sample \" of cigars left with us on the 30th ult, we are of opinion that the samples '' stated to have been dried by A. T. Booth's Patent Process were distinctly \" superior in flavour and other characteristics to those which we had been \" informed were dried by heat. We also found that the cigars had been \"manufactured from genuine tobacco of good quality. \u2014 We are, gentlemen, W. Boaz, Engineer, 29, West India Dock Eoad, Limehouse, E. \u2014 The well-known house of Mr. W. Boaz is devoted to the carrying on of a general engineering business, but it is especially noted at the present time for the development of three remarkable specialities. These are : The Boaz Patent Tube Stopper, for marine and other boilers ; the Boaz Patent Boiler and Condenser Tube Scraper ; and steel wire brooms and brushes. The production of these articles now occupies almost the entire time and attention of the house and its proprietor. The Patent Tube Stopper is without a superior, and many leading engineers have pronounced it the most effective article of the kind in the market. A defective or leaky tube can be immediately stopped without reducing pressure, by passing the apparatus through the leaky tube from the front end of the boiler and screwing up the nut, which action expands the rubber washers and makes the tube tight at each end. A shield is provided to prevent the person being scalded while applying the apparatus ; and the tube can be thoroughly and completely stopped in two minutes. This tube stopper has been supplied to hundreds of large and important steamships, and it also enjoys the favour and patronage of the Honour- able Corporation of the Trinity House, several foreign governments, and many of the leading steam shipping companies. The Patent Boiler and Condenser Tube Scraper is a most efficacious appliance, constructed upon an excellent principle, and possessing a great many unique ad- vantages. It has every desirable quality of durability, simplicity, and effective action in its favour. Mr. Boaz is celebrated for his manu- factures in steel wire brushes adapted for cleaning hot castings, and for general foundry use ; also for steel wire sweeping brooms for all coarse sweeping, and spiral boiler tube brushes in steel or brass wire, hair, iron wire, whalebone or fibre. These he manufactures very extensively, and supplies to engineers, founders, &c. General engineering is carried on to a considerable extent, and all kinds of ships' fittings are held in stock. The business is a notable one in every respect. The trade controlled is a large one. Mr. Boaz holds many testimonials from sources of high noteworthiness, affirming the excellence of his productions ; and medallic awards from the Boyal Aquarium Maritime and Piscatorial Exhibition, 1877; the North-East Coast Exhibition, 1882; the Crystal Palace Exhibition, 1884 ; and tbe Inventions Exhibition, 1885. The premises occupied in West India Dock Boad are extensive, commodious, and thoroughly well equipped, and afford every facility for the effectual con duct of a first-class industry."], [92, "108 MODEEN LONDON. The Ladies' Dress Association, Limited, 71 and 70, Jermyn Street, and 25, Bury Street, St. James's, S.W.\u2014 On the first of June 187 S was opened the Ladies' Dress Association, Limited, which was incorporated under the Companies Acts of 1862 and 1857 on May 2nd 1877, and is now widely known as one of the most deservedly prominent institutions of its kind \"in the metropolis. The association was established with the object of suppyling to its members \" every description of ladies' and children's dress and wearing apparel, and materials for the *| same, on the sound principlesof cash trading adopted by the co-operative \" societies.\" Its advantages are embodied in the fact that it was founded for the mutual benefit of its members, and not for the mere purpose of making profits, and its extensive business operations and large member ship rollto-day amply attest the appreciation that has been accorded to it. The society occupies a large and exceedingly commodious establish ment, which was formerly- the Universities Club, and has undergone con siderable enlargement and alteration to meet the requirements of the business. The warehouse contains five spacious and admirably arranged floors. The ground floor is set apart chiefly for the display and sale of silk and fancy dress materials in one department ; lace, hosiery, ribbons, sunshades, gloves, and general fancy articles, trunks, bags, and* umbrellas in another; and household linen and general drapery in a third. On the first floor are the very extensive and exhaustively stocked departments for silk costumes, ball dresses, and one for stuff costumes and washable dress materials, in which sections some beautiful goods and elegant cos tume designs are shown ; and on the same floor another most commodious department for mantles, furs, and the boot and shoe department. Here also are the handsomely appointed and well equipped fitting-rooms. The second floor is devoted to millinery, flowers and feathers, and ladies' and children's \u2022outfitting and baby linen, and trousseaux. Of all the departments those for costumes, mantles, and millinery will of course take chief rank. The first-named is exceedingly fortunate in possessing the services of one of the cleverest fitters in London, and also of a staff of superior cutters ; the work produced, therefore, is of the highest order of excellence. All the millinery work is done on the premises from the best Parisian models and the conceptions of the society's own talented designer. On the third floor is a handsomely furnished room, regularly supplied with the current maga zines and ladies' journals, and so fitted up as to form a most comfortable and attractive lounge and waiting-room. Adjoining this is the admirably appointed refreshment-room, situate in the front part of the building, in which hot and cold refreshments are constantly obtainable. All the various rooms and departments are maintained in perfect order. The several floors are approached by means of a broad and handsome staircase. The work-rooms of the association are five in number, and are located on the second, third, and fourth floors. These are all well lighted and well ventilated, and give employment to about 120 female operatives. The assistant staff numbers about 100, chiefly young ladies, all of them living upon the premises, or in quarters provided by the association. They all \u2022dine and take tea on the premises. The managerial and clerical depart ments are upon the ground floor, the staff being under the able supervision of a board of directors, and Mr. C. W. Kennett, the secretary, and Mr. J. W. Scrivener, the general manager. The Ladies' Dress Association, Limited, has of late years very much improved under the present management, and has satisfactorily increased the number of its members and the volume of the yearly business transacted. The patronage enjoyed by the association is of a most distinguished order. Its shareholders and life and annual members come from the most eminent social and aristocratic ranks. As a commercial enterprise the success of the asso ciation is now assured, and its prosperity is steadily growing. We hope its good fortune will continue and remain eminently gratifying to directors and shareholders alike. The business has been established about twenty-five years, has had a most successful career, and gained a very large and influential connection among the leading members of the aristocracy, &c. throughout the locality. The stock is characterised by excellent workmanship and superior material. A considerable proportion of the trade is done in connection with the bespoke department. All orders are executed by a staff of specially chosen workmen, and are carried out with promptitude and despatch. The business is admirably managed, and has attained to very considerable importance. The house has au important manufactory at Hoxton, sup plying an enormous connection in that neighbourhood. Great ability and energy have been displayed, and the success achieved has been well merited. James Barker & Son, Monumental Masons, 86 and 88, Eichmond Boad, West Brompton, and at 146, Lillie Eoad, Fulham, S.W. \u2014 One of the most prominent of London houses representing the art of stonemasonry is that conducted by Messrs. James Barker & Son, which was founded in 1843, and has always remained in the same family. The premises occupied are spacious, and comprise two shops used as show rooms, having a fine street frontage, and being fitted with every appoint ment for that purpose, while in the rear of the premises are capacious sheds in which all kinds of stone-carving are executed. The monuments produced by the house are of unique and costly description. Obelisks, broken columns, plain and ornamental crosses, slabs, &c. are displayed in the spacious showrooms with great taste and skill, and are highly credit able works of art, being original in design and cut with great clearness, and are in every case vivid representations of the objects and forms intended. Special care is directed to the selection of the best material. Tombs of the most elaborate and of the simplest kind are erected at very moderate terms in any part of the country, and prepared for export. Memorials cleaned, restored, and painted. Inscriptions engraved in granite, marble, and stone, and filled with imperishable lead. Designs and all other information will be forwarded on application. A large staff of experienced artificers are permanently employed, and the patronage bestowed on the house is of the very highest class, being principally from among the aristocracy and opulent classes of society. The partners are well known to be of the high commercial status, and highly esteemed by their distinguished patrons. Henry Stokes, Watchmaker, Goldsmith, and Diamond Merchant, 4, Somerset Terrace, Kensington High Street, W. \u2014 The oldest establishment of its kind in Kensington is that now controlled by Mr. Henry Stokes, watchmaker, jeweller, goldsmith, and silversmith. This house was originally founded over fifty years ago by a Mr. Wright, who was subse quently succeeded by Mr. Stokes, and the latter gentleman later on taking over the establishment of Messrs. J. Toms & Co., which has also been established fifty years, amalgamated the two under the present title. Tbe premises are spacious, and thoroughly well laid out with a well-arranged display of gold and silver watches, gold, silver, and gem jewellery, and plate of all descriptions. The workshops, which have been rebuilt, are situate at the rear of the premises. They are admirably fitted up, and equipped with the most improved machinery. A large staff of workmen are employed in the various branches of the business. Mr. Henry Stokes is a gentleman of sound practical experience in every branch of his craft. He makes a speciality of diamond mounting and the resetting of old jewels, doing in these lines some exquisite work of the most delicate. character ; and his watch and clock repairing department is noted through out the district for the effective manner in which it executes all and every commission. T. A. Dollar, Veterinary Surgeon, 56, New Bond Street, and 47, 49 and 51, Little Cadogan Place, S.W.\u2014 One of the leading and most widely known veterinary surgeons in the metropolis is Mr. T. A. Dollar. He has been established thirty-five yeais, and has built up a widespread and high-class connection. He has been honoured by a special appointment to H.B.H. the Prince of Wales, and received the only prize medal awarded at the International Exhibition of 1862, and medals atthe Paris and Dublin Exhibitions of 1867 and 1865 respectively for superior construction of horse shoes. His horse infirmaries and veteri nary forges are at 56, New Bond Street ; 47, 49a, and 51, Little Cadogan Place, S.W. ; Eccleston Place, Eaton Square ; and at Kendal Mews, Baker Street ; Wells House Farm, East Acton, loose boxes, straw yard, and paddocks; and 11 and 12, Belvedere Boad, Lambeth, S.W. ; and a veterinary forge at 61, Horsefeiry Boad, Westminster. His skill and experience are well known and appreciated among the principal horse owners of the country, and he is a recognised authority in all matters pertaining to his profession. Owing to early training, he is eminently qualified to act as consulting veterinary surgeon in cases of disease to any ofthe domestic animals. B. Bruce, Bootmaker, 165, Brompton Eoad, S.W.\u2014 One of the best-known and most thriving businesses in Brompton Eoad is that of Mr. Benjamin Bruce, who occupies spacious and well-fitted premises."], [93, "109 MODEEN LONDON. Peter Robinson, Silk, Drapery, and Mourning Ware houseman, Oxford Street, W. \u2014 No mercantile house in the world is better known than that of Peter Bobinson. In 1833 the business was established on the north-west side of Oxford Street, between Great Portland Street and Begent Circus. From a comparatively small begin ning it steadily developed, its progress being commensurate with the energy and sound judgment displayed in its management. The public quickly recognised tho many advantages to be derived from patronizing an establishment where ready money procured the best and most desir able goods, at lowest possible prices consistent with quality and fair dealing. The increasing volume of trade necessitated larger premises, and from time to time these were added to tbe Oxford Street premises. A fuither development of the trade followed and it was soon found necessary to find additional quarters. These were procured in Begent Street, and extend to Argyll Street, and since then other buildings in Begent Street, Great Portland and Little Portland Streets, have been added. The premises thus occupied have an immense area, all of which is essentially necessary for the adequate display of the exten sive stock. The establishment is equipped throughout with every modern facility and convenience for the transaction of business, and the result of the proprietor's complete system of organization is apparent in the different departments. Everything moves like clockwork ; each one of the hundreds of employes knows his or her duty and duly performs it, while by the wise rules laid down there is no confusion incidental to the carrying on of such an extensive business, and a prompt and satisfactory service by all assistants is a noteworthy feature of the establishment. The stock on hand is one of the largest, as it is the most complete in Lon don. There are upwards of twenty-five departments, each covering a special branch of the trade, and where customers can go direct, knowing that there are the special goods they desire to see, and at prices which will meet the requirements of all ; in fact it is in every respect the model Drapery establishment of the world. It bandles the finest fabrics from the principal British and Continental manufacturing centres. In silk goods the house has, for many years, been one of the largest buyers in the Lyons market, while its speciality for mantles, costumes, and ladies' clothing has long been recognised, its products in this line being unex ceUed for beauty and originality of design, superiority of workmanship and finish. The house also imports largely every artistic novelty that the increasing energy and talent of foreign manufacturers can supply. Each department is therefore kept constantly replenished with everything new and desirable. They vie with each other in the extent and excel lence of their displays, and the very powerful evidences of the great trade conducted by the house are potently supplemented by a glance at the list of those departments into which it has been found necessary for perfect convenience to subdivide the establishment. A few of the most im portant of these are departments for silks and velvets, mantles, costumes, ball and fancy dresses, dress fabrics, shawls, millinery, laces, furs, hosiery, gloves, children's garments, ladies' outfits, boys' outfits, house hold linens, sheetings and blankets. Then there is a section devoted entirely to fancy household articles and ornaments, and another to boots and shoes. The Court and general mourning warehouse is situated in Begent Street. This portion of the establishment offers superior advan tages to the nobility and families of the highest rank, and also to those of limited means. It constitutes the largest mourning warehouse in Lon don, and the stock of made-up articles which it contains is the most ex tensive that can be seen in any one establishment in the kingdom. The dressmaking department is another noteworthy feature of the house. It is'thoroughly equipped to execute aU orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. The establishment gives employment to about one thousand five hundred persons. Of these upwards of six hundred board and lodge on the premises. Every arrangement has been made for their comfort and safety. There are sitting and smoking rooms, and a library of four thousand volumes for their use. The kitchen and dining rooms are models of neatness and perfect equipment, and the entire arrangements are satisfactory in every respect. The establishment is lighted throughout by a combination system of arc and incandescent ktmps. No expense has been spared in making the result a complete success, and the most sanguine hopes have been realised. The engine room is located twenty-seven feet below the ground level, and contains two powerful engines, each one being capable of furnishing sufficient power for tbe illuminating apparatus. Three dynamos are employed for tho arc lamps, and an Edison-Hopkinson Shunt machine, making one thousand one hundred revolutions per minute, charges the fifty-three accumulators. There are forty-two arc lamps in use, each of one thousand candle power, and two hundred and forty-five incandescent lamps of twenty candle power each, and also a compound- wound \" New Ph\u0153nix \" dynamo, capable of running four hundred lights. The brass fittings for the latter are uniform throughout the buildings, and in an emergency g/S can be used. Much attention has been paid in perfecting a system of switches, &c, whereby the light can be lessened or increased as desired. In the construction of this electro-light plant particular atten tion has been given to safety as weU as to utility. Ample precautions are in existence to prevent the outbreak of and quickly subdue a conflagration, tbe employes being thoroughly drilled and instructed, and a\u00b0splendid equipment of approved fire apparatus is at hand. For the rapid delivery of goods there is a large number of carts and horses, in addition to a special express service for parcels requiring immediate dispatch. In addition to the immense metropolitan and suburban trade of the house, it has customers in all parts of the kingdom and the Continent. There is a special department for country orders, and its operations have attained proportions of great magnitude. The perfect organization of this immense business is one ofthe secrets of its success. It is an estab lishment worthy of its founder, and a good illustration of what can be accomplished by enterprise and straightforward business principles. It is such houses that best demonstrate the solidity and supremacy of London's commercial community, and its career is highly creditable, both to its proprietor and the mighty city in which it is located. Mr. Peter Bobin son is a gentleman whose ability and sterling personal qualifications have won for him the esteem and respect of our leading circles, and the success he has achieved is as substantial as it is well deserved. Smalpage & Son, Tailors, 41 and 43, Maddox Street, W. \u2014 The distinguished house of Messrs. Smalpage and Son, Tailors and Outfitters, has a record of nearly two centuries in the annals of the West-End gentlemen's outfitting trade. This widely-known establishment occupies premises comprising the whole of two well-located four-storey buildings, constituting a depot of singularly commodious dimensions and exceptional convenience fur the transaction of a large and widespread business. On the ground floor are located the offices and cutting rooms : on the first floor the show and fitting rooms, which are magnificently fitted and furnished as reception rooms, securing at once the privacy, comfort and convenience of the numerous influential and high-class patrons of the establishment. The goods shown, comprising fabrics of all kinds for suitings, are in every instance of the finest quality ; and in the various branches in which they engage, Messrs. Smalpage and Son are renowned far and near for the uniform excellence and thorough reliability of every item in their extensive output. The trade of the house is of widespread dimensions, with connections that take effect in every part of the world ; and the circle of patronage enjoyed is of a most distinguished order. A large force of hands is constantly employed ; and an American branch is controlled at 44, East Twenty-third Street, New York. The firm arc also agents for the White Star Line of Eoyal and U. S. Mail Steamers. Mr. John Henry Smalpage is the sole partner of the firm, and he conducts his business upon a basis of enterprise that is strictly commen surate with the excellent reputation which has, for two hundred years, attended the career of his eminent house. Oxenham's Auction Booms (Brown & Tooth), 187 and 189, Oxford Street, W. \u2014 Perhaps no establishment in London, connected with the profession of the auctioneer, is more widely or favour ably known to the public and the various trades than that controlled by Messrs. Brown and Tooth, under tbe title of Oxenham's Auction Booms. This celebrated mart was originated as far back as 1804. In 1870 the buildings were destroyed by fire, but rebuilt in 1871, and again enlarged and improved in 1875 and 1880. The premises as they now stand con stitute one of the most complete buildings for the uses to which they- are devoted to be found anywhere within the limits of the metropolis. The various buildings have frontages of 30 feet in Oxford Street, 49 feet in Blenheim Street, and 72 feet in Blenheim Mews, but owing to the diver sified laying out ofthe ground-plan they cover much more space than these stated figures indicate at first sight. The internal arrangements consist of fourteen floors of warehouses, with an additional storeroom in the basement measuring 38 by 30 feet. There are auction rooms, lettered A. to G. inclusive, and comprising a total of six floors, while two floors are used as bedding rooms, and a large space is occupied by the commcv dious and well-appointed offices. Up through the centre of the principal wing runs a large open space from ground floor to roof, for purposes of perfect light and ventilation. Than these magnificent premises, with the immense bulk of warehoused property contained therein, and the army of assistants employed in their management, no more conclusive demon stration could be given of the exalted position held by the establishment. There are seven distinct entrances to the buildings, affording unequalled facilities for the receipt and delivery of goods, and the total of the floor area exceeds 21,000 feet, the principal rooms being 20 feet in height. The business conducted by Messrs. Brown and Tooth ranges over the whole extent of auctioneering practice, and includes sales of houses of furniture, fixtures, books, wines, wearing apparel, and the disposal of almost every description of property. A special department is devoted to. the sale and letting of lands, houses, and business premises, and to the collection of rents. This section of the business is conducted with the most scrupulous exactness and attention to the interests of clients ; and the sales in connection with it are held periodically by Messrs. Brown and Tooth, at the Mart, in Tokenhouse Yard, E.C. This establishment makes valuations for probate, transfer and other purposes at moderate rates, and conducts sales at private houses. Sales of household effects are held on Fridays and Tuesdays, Mondays and Thursdays being observed for special auctions. The large attendance of buyers at the sale-rooms is a constant assurance of fair auction prices being realised, and the auctioneers make a point, if such be the preference of clients, of purchasing the goods and taking the risk of sale upon themselves. The old establishment of this eminent institution, the high repute in which it is held throughout thc kingdom, its vast facilities, central position, and the well-known ability of its experienced proprietors, have all combined to give Oxenham's Auction Booms one of the most extensive and distinguished circles es patronage enjoyed by any house of its kind in Great Britain."], [94, "110 MODEEN LONDON. Thrupp & Maberly, Carriage and Harness Makers, 425, Oxford Street, W. \u2014 The distinguished house of Messrs. Thrupp & Maberly, Carriage Builders and Harness Makers, was founded in 1774, under the style of Joseph Thrupp and Co. Thirty years ago, Messrs. Maberly and Son, of Welbeck Street, joined the firm, and the present title has obtained since that date. The fine premises now occu pied stand on the site of the original establishment, and were erected in 1884. They consist of a magnificent pile of buildings, built of red brick, with terra-cotta and granite facings, and situate between Oxford, George, and Queen Streets. The unsurpassed street frontage thus obtained is utilised to the greatest advantage, and a superb series of plate-glass windows afford perfect means of inspecting the carriages within. These buildings, among the largest of their kind in London, are handsomely finished internally, are fitted up with all the latest improvements, and are subdivided throughout their four storeys into a most conveniently arranged suite of show-rooms, and spacious, well-lighted workshops. In tho latter about one hundred and twenty hands are engaged, while in addition many are employed outside. The display of carriages in the handsome show-rooms is of splendid proportions, exhaustive variety, and attractive appearance. Messrs. Thrupp and Maberly's productions in the carriage-building Une are second to none; and no more ample evidence of this sweeping assertion could he desired than the ocular demonstration afforded by a visit of inspection. This firm are particularly noted for their Victorias, and they introduced that most graceful of all light four wheel carriages, the Vis-a-vis Victoria. Other specialities are Broug hams, miniature landaus, phaetons, omnibuses, &c, &c, and in every line of their manufactures the object of the firm appear to be the attain ment of the acme of grace and lightness in conjunction with perfect strength and durability-. In connection with their carriage department, Messrs. Thrupp and Maberly carry a fine stock of second-hand carriages, for sale, or on hire hy the month, year, or term of years ; carriages are sold on the three years' system ; their customers' carriages and harness when not in use are warehoused and insured from fire ; and repairs are executed hy estimate, while experienced men attend to the oiling of vehicles, within twenty miles of London, at fixed yearly rates. Of com mensurate completeness in appointments and stock is the harness depart ment, wherein Messrs. Thrupp and Maberly exhibit everything in the lines of horse, carriage, and stable fittings; single and double sets of hand sewn harness, saddlery, horse clothing, stable utensils, knee aprons, whips, and india-rubber, cocoa and sheepskin mats, are displayed ; and the quality of material and workmanship, with the fineness of finish, is in every case of the very highest order. Horses are measured and fitted free of charge within the Metropolitan postal district, and harness is made to order or let on hire for a term of years, the repairs being executed at the expense of the house. In this, as in the carriage department, every item of the stock is manufactured on the premises by the best skUled labour and under the most careful supervision. Messrs. Thrupp and Maberly are coach-builders by appointment to the Queen, and are honoured with a large share of the royal patronage in this respect. Ten years ago her Majesty's dress coaches were converted into semi-state ones by this house, and during the intervening years, several new carriages have been built for the royal stalls in London and at Windsor. The royal warrant of the of Portugal was held by this firm under her Majesty Maria da Gloria. The home trade of Messrs. Thrupp and Maberly is of widespread dimen sions. The export branch is also extensive, and the fame of this house is well established in Portugal, Bussia, India and Australia. The members of the present house are respectively Mr. G. H. Maberly, Mr. G. A. Thrupp, Mr. G. Herbert Thrupp, Mr. B. J. Durham, and Mr. B. W. Thornton. designs, formulated by their own artists on the premises, for costumes, baB dresses, dinner dresses, brides-maids' trousseaux, garden party, his torical and fancy dress costumes of every description, hats, mantles, and children's apparel, in styles at once unique, tasteful, and fashionable. All these designs can be subsequently made up in tho most thoroughly artistic and effective manner in materials and fabrics for the trade with which Messrs. Stephens have so closely identified themselves. The firm have made a special study of colour in their practice of the art of costuming, and their facilities enable them to produce dresses of every description, whose characteristics shall be the perfection of fit and grace. In this lofty aim the proprietors are ably seconded by their numerous and highly skilled executive staff. All present evidences indicate that Messrs. A. Stephens & Co. have accomplished nothing less than the inauguration of a new epoch in the construction of ladies' costumes and children's dresses, in which perfect taste and graceful design are destined to play more important parts than hitherto. The business of this house is conducted with most com mendable energy and enterprise ; and though they are as yet but compara tively youthful factors in metropolitan commercial circles, the branches controlled by Messrs. A. Stephens & Co. have by the sheer force of their attractiveness advanced to posts of great and well-merited prominence, and secured for themselves a liberal and increasing share of the best town and country patronage. Novello, Ewer & Co., Music Publishers, 1, Berners Street, W., and 80 and 81, Queen Street, Cheapside, E.C.\u2014Estab lished as long ago as 1832, the distinguished house of Messrs. Novello, Ewer & Co. has, ever since its inception, been intimately associated with the most prominent phases of advancement in the metropolitan music publish ing trade. The head-quarters of the house are at the Berners Street address, and there a commanding building of four floors, with a basement, is occupied. Externally- the appearance of the edifice is handsome and attractive ; internally the effect of the decoration employed is excellent. The ground floor, a spacious saile some ninety by forty feet, is utilised entirely for the purposes of the vast retail trade of the establishment. The general appearance of this immensedepartment is thoroughly characteristic of the entire depot, and indicative of the large and important business interests which find their centre of operations therein. In prominent positions on either side of the principal entrance stand admirable busts of Beethoven and the Abbe Liszt, suggesting to the visitor the many musical associations of the depot with these virtuosi ; and this impression is deepened and accentuated by sight of the long rows of fixtures ranged upon the walls, and crowded with musical publications, as also are the ranks of stands arranged down the centre of the room, and affording advantageous means of display for the various vocal and instrumental works upon them exhibited. At the end of the apartment farthest from the main entrance handsome stained glass windows admit the light in many hues and tints, and greatly- enhance the already fine effect of one of the most admirably arranged and most commodious music sale-rooms in the metropolis. All the other portions of the extensive premises are used as offices and warerooms. The appointments of all are excellent ; and the stock contained in the various storing departments is of enormous proportions and great comprehensiveness. Messrs. Novello, Ewer & Co. devote their attention most particularly to the publication of sacred music ; and in connection with this line of operation, their name is known and celebrated wherever the art finds civilised devotees. Detailed specification of the various musical works issued by the house is of course quite out of the question in these pages ; the bulky and admirably- printed and arranged catalogues issued by the firm are alone equal to the adequate performance of this task. It is perhaps unnecessary, in face of the renown attaching to the name of the house, to state that everything that is worthy of consideration in relation to the art of sacred song will be found duly enumerated in its lists, or may be obtained upon the shortest possible notice through its influential agency. Solos for all voices, anthems, services, chants, psalters, hymns and carols, oratorios and cantatas, choruses, duets, trios and quartettes, by the most eminent composers, past and present, all find full and complete representation ; and Novello, Ewer & Co.'s editions in all these lines are noted for typographical and general excellence of the highest order. This house also publishes the well-known organ of tho musical profession, the Musical Times, whose circulation extends to every quarter of the globe, and far exceeds that of any other similar journal either domestic or foreign. The printing works* of Messrs. Novello, Ewer & Co. are at Nos. b9 and 70, Dean Street, Soho; and their extensive bookbinding works are located at Nos. Ill, 113, and 115, Southwark Street, S.E. In both these establishments a large force of operatives is employed, and the assistant staff's at the Queen Street and Berners Street depots are numerous and highly efficient. The American branch of the house, equally renowned in the New World with its great parent establishment in the old, is situated at 129, Fifth Avenue, New York, and through its agency the interests of the firm in the Western Hemisphere are admirably fostered and upheld. Messrs. Novello, Ewer \u25a0S: Co.'s trading operations are enormous; their widespread connections extend to every part of the inhabited world ; and it is safe to say that there is not a cathedral, church, chapel. Or other institution devoted to the practice of sacred music in either its vocal or instrumental branches, within whose walls some one or more items of the multitude of publications issued by this house have not at some time found their way. A. Stephens & Co., Art Fabrics and Costumes, 326 & 291, Begent Street, W.\u2014 One of the most noteworthy of West End houses in its line is that of Messrs. A. Stephens & Co., importers of Indian silks, cashmeres, and art fabrics. At 326, Begent Street, this prominent house, which was sounded under its present title in 1885, conducts a most extensive depot for the import and sale of art fabrics of all descriptions. At the latter (No. 291) the firm has recently opened up a fine suite of hand somely appointed show-rooms wherein are exemplified some of the daintiest phases of artistic costuming of which the metropolis affords an instance. Messrs. A. Stephens & Co. conduct very large operations as importers of Indian silks, fine cashmeres and Oriental fabrics of the most attractive character. They have perfected arrangements whereby all varieties of these beautiful goods can be supplied to customers at most inexpensive rates. They have succeeded in making the selections for their rich, com prehensive, and exhaustively varied stock in such a manner as shall com bine the finest quality of material with the highest artistic merit, the most \u2022effective colourings, and the lowest possible prices. Their object now is to promote the use of these fabrics for tasteful and artistic costume purposes. With this in view the new show-rooms were opened at 291, Begent Street. There Messrs. Stephens display designs and styles, original and unique, which for genuine grace and beauty of conception it would seem almost impossible to surpass. They are provided for ladies and children in charming variety, and are devised for making up in the several classes of material. To judge from the specimens on view it would certainly seem that nothing has yet been introduced by the costumier's art capable in any respect of excelling in graceful construction the examples of artistic apparel to whose production the firm are now devoting their care and attention. The house makes a special feature of the furmshiDg of original"], [95, "MODEEN LONDON. 111 M. Samuel & Co., Shell Merchants and Manufac turers, and Japanese and Oriental Importers, 31, Houndsditch, E.C.\u2014 No record of the great representative business institutions of East Central London would be complete without due reference to the notable establishment of Messrs. M. Samuel & Co., whose depdt and warehouses are of immense proportions. This exceptionally extensive wholesale business has been in existenoe for over 100 years, and it has always been controlled by members of the family of Messrs. Samuel. The premises occupied are of great extent and singularly commodious character. The space granted by the premises for wareroom and showroom purposes lies mainly in the rear of the Houndsditch frontage, and extends right through to Duke Street, far beyond the rear of the adjoining shops, con stituting a total area to each floor in the warehouse of 6,000 superficial feet. In this establishment every facility exists for the satisfactory and expeditious conduct of an enormous trade. Messrs. M. Samuel & Co. carry on at these, their long-established head-quarters, two distinct businesses, both of which rank among the largest of their kind in London, while one of them is almost unique. This is the importation and making up of shells of all descriptions, a line in which the house was originally founded, and which has been masterfully developed. In the importation and collection of every conceivable kind and class of ornamental shells from every quarter of the globe, and in the manufacture of the same into all descriptions of useful and decorative articles, Messrs. Samuel stand practically unrivalled. This business was originally inaugurated in Smithfield, but has for many years been located at the present address. In the capacious basement, with its 6,000 feet of floor space, are stored the various kinds of shells as they are imported and collected. Here huge chests are piled one upon another in lofty stacks reaching from floor to ceiling, and these contain enormous quantities of shells of every species known to, and of value in, modern commerce. Mother-of-pearl forms a leading feature in the stock ; and it may- here be mentioned that Messrs. Samuel are among our largest manufacturers of pearl jewellery, buttons, and other products of the pearl shell. Adjoining the basement are the washing and cleaning departments, where all the shells are prepared for the manufactory, which latter occupies the three upper floors of the premises, and contains a most valuable and extensive plant of improved machinery. Here a skilled staff of 220 hands is employed, and all the various industrial processes connected with the production of fancy shell boxes, shell jewellery, picture and looking-glass frames, pearl cards, Christmas cards with shell embellishments, and with every kind of pearl and tortoiseshell working and button manufacture, are fully and most creditably exemplified. In addition to this industry the firm are also shell merchants, and most extensively supply this class of goods to leading houses of shell and mother-of-pearl dealers and workers throughout the kingdom. Turning to the second branch of Messrs. Samuel's business, it will be readily seen that they stand well to the front among the largest importers of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian fancy goods in London. Of Japanese and Chinese fancy goods the firm are the oldest and first importers in Europe. This department was instituted some twelve years ago, when Oriental art manu factures and fancy articles, particularly of Japanese production, first be came widely popular in this country ; and during the period thus elapsing the branch has been most energetically and successfully developed. The firm have now no fewer than four houses in Japan, together with three or four other dep6ts in leading centres in China, and the facilities thus pos sessed place them among the first of metropolitan concerns in the receipt of novefities of all kinds in Chinese and Japanese manufactures. Of all kinds of Chinese and Japanese fancy and decorative goods, and of Benares, Gujerat and Mooradabad art wares, the firm hold an immense stock, advantageously displayed. This showroom really commands attention by the power of its almost exceptional attractiveness ; and the picture it presents, with its rich and profuse array of novel, unique, and eminently beautiful goods, embodying all the artistic taste and technical skill of workmanship so characteristic of Oriental artizan productions, is more like a scene from some enchanted land pourtrayed in the Arabian Nights than a view of a representative wareroom. To briefly summarise Messrs. Samuel's entire stock, it is found to contain nine distinct departments ; and these, enumerated under their respective heads, comprise shells of every description, shell and bead work, shell purses, shell boxes, pearl and tortoiseshell work, jewellery, &c., buttons, fancy cards, and Oriental goods. By this stock in its entirety an immense capital is represented ; and a tour of inspection of its various interesting divisions will tell a wondrous tale of enterprise displayed and untiring energy expended in first rendering it so vastly comprehensive, and then maintaining it at its present notable level of exhaustive completeness. The house enjoys a world-wide connection of great value and influence, and a trade of enormous proportions is controlled throughout the United Kingdom, India, the colonies, and practically every quarter of the globe. establishments in this branch of trade, and giving constant employment to a large number of skilled workmen. This firm has a high repu tation for artistic and decorative work, and many private mansions and public buildings in Kensington bear testimony to the skill and talent of this establishment. The proprietor, Mr. Walter Nash, is well known as a thoroughly practical man, possessed of artistic talent of no mean order. He has had a long and honourable connection with this business, and by his energy, business ability, and courtesy gained a high and well-deserved reputation. Thomas R. Willis, Organ Builder, and Manufacturer and Importer of Musical Instruments, 2y, Minories, E. \u2014 Prominent amongst the business premises of the Minories is the establishment of Mr. Thomas R. Willis, manufacturer and importer of all kinds of musical instruments. The house was founded in the year 1 827, and dur ing the more than sixty years of its existence has enjoyed an almost unbroken and uniform prosperity. The premises include commodious and handsome showroom on the ground floor, several spacious stock and work rooms over, and a large manufactory in the rear. Mr. Willis supplies (either of his own manufacture or imported) every descrip tion of musical instruments \u2014 brass, reed, or wind, pianos, harmoniums, organs, drums, cymbals, violins, &c. &c. All necessary materials for organ building, including stop heads, pipe feet and rack pillars, stopper han dles, pallet springs, leather nuts, tap wires, manuals, pedals, wind gauges, squares, roller arms and studs, tubing, leather for all purposes, bellows, sound boards, pedal springs, red cloths, back falls and frames, reed knives, reeds, tongues, and pipe metal, may be purchased on the premises, a most comprehensive and varied stock being held. As an organ builder on a fairly large scale Mr. Willis has been very successful, and he has erected numerous instruments of a high class for use in churches and public halls. The connection is widespread and extensive ; the working staff is made up of experienced and accomplished hands ; and the total annual business amounts to a handsome sum. Mr. Willis himself retains the active management of the business, and year by year enhances the prestige of the house. He is well known in musical and professional circles, where his talents, his genial nature, and unfailing courtesy make him especially popular. A. Braun & Wustlich, Printers, Engravers, &c.f 19, Little Alie Street, Commercial Boad, E. \u2014 In no branch of industry have more rapid strides been made within the past half-century than in that of printing in lithographic and engraving work. Among the many establishments in this city making a speciality of high-class productions of this type in connection with a general line of all kinds of commercial printing is that of Messrs. A. Braun & Wustlich. This representative concern was originally established by its present proprietors in Bury Court, St. Mary Axe, as far back as 1852, and was removed to their pre sent commodious quarters in 1879. They execute every conceivable class of printing from a card to a book, but make an especial feature of getting up embossed show-cards, labels, and kindred work in gold and colours, which for beauty, high finish, and artistic design cannot be excelled by any contemporary establishment in the United Kingdom. The firm do a business of colossal magnitude in this department, numbering among their customers many of the leading London business houses and pro vincial firms, and enjoying almost a monopoly in the production of fancy labels for wines and spirits, preserves, cordials, biscuit boxes, canned goods, &c. The premises occupied consist of an eligible four-story and basement building, fitted with steam power and all modern machinery and printing accessories. Jarman & Co., Tin Canister Manufacturers, 16, 17. and 1 8, Duke Street, E.C. \u2014 There are hardly any articles manufactured that enter more directly into the use of all branches of business than tin canisters and packing cases. A prominent London house engaged in this special line of production is that of Messrs. Jarman & Co., which was established in 1883, and has since built up a large local, provincial, and export trade. The premises occupied are very spacious and commodious, and comprise eligible workshops, admirably arranged and equipped with all the latest improved machinery. Employment is provided for a large force of skilled and experienced operatives. The products ofthe house include all kinds of plain and fancy canisters, varnish and oil bottles, tea and coffee tins, japanned deed and cash boxes, tin-lined wood packing cases, plain and decorated cigarette boxes, See., which are principally manufactured to order. Any desired style or shape is made, and the reputation attained for first-class workmanship and tasteful designs by this house is unexcelled. The firm are painstaking and honourable manufacturers, who study carefully the wants of the trade, and by producing a reliable quality of goods at fair prices, have built' up their present extensive and rapidly widening business. Walter Nash, Builder and Decorator, IS, Earl's Court Road, and Newland Terrace, Kensington, W. \u2014 In the neighbourhood of Kensington, a builder of enterprise and proved ability is Mr. Walter Nash, who has for the last twenty years carried on most successfully a large and increasing business. During the last twelve years the business of the house has been conducted in the present premises, with the workshops and saw-mills at 15, Earl's Court Boad. These latter are very extensive and complete in all their arrangements, forming one of the most complete"], [96, "112 MODERN LONDON. H. Overtoil, Fishmonger, Poulterer, Ice Merchant, and licensed Came Sealer, 3a, 4, 5, 6, Victoria Buildings, Pimlico, S.W. \u2014 In the metropolitan districts of London it would be difficult to find a more valuable or extensive business of its kind than that carried on by- Mr. H. Overton, whose extensive premises are centrally located in the midst of a first-class neighbourhood at Nos. 3a, 4, 5, and 6, Victoria Buildings, Pimlico. S.W. About seventeen years ago this now popular conceru was established, and from the very date of its inception it gave proofs of attaining a high degree of success. As a fishmonger, poulterer, ice merchant, and a licensed dealer in game, the establishment of Mr. Overtoil has no rival in the locality. The stock is of the soundest and its present sole proprietor at the above address in Blackfriars, where a very Iar<-*e sawing aud planing industry is carried on, and where there are excellent premises and a fiue plant of modern machinery. Iu connection with these mills Mr. Haggis has large yards for storing timber at Boupell Street, Lambeth, and Ewer Street, Southwark, both about a quarter of a mile distant. Siuce Mr. Haggis first commenced his operations the business has greatly developed in magnitude and importance, and has long since outgrown\" the accommodation afforded by its original Brunswick Street premises. These still constitute the headquarters of tbe house, but although they are notably large and commodious \u2014 having a frontage of 130 feet, and running back to a great depth \u2014 they are much smaller than the establishment at King's Cross (New Wharf, Boad, Caledonian Boad). At this latter location Mr. Haggis has premises and yards of most ex- L-& tensive dimensions on the Begents Canal and iffS^-^SS\u0153EL Battle Bridge Basin, whilst at Paddington, also g^^^^^MlitergWmnf on the canal, he has mills for sawing (but uot planing), aud whaif premises ; and the three \u2014 - ---==^!I~~ii^Ei establishments combined, with their several out- fits of machinery, represent the largest area of works, and doubtless the largest complement cf plant, devoted to the sawing and planing trade by any single private firm in London. His facilities for timber conversion and preparation are undoubtedly of an exceptionally high order, the mechanical equipment of each of his large establishments comprising a magnificent array of improved quick-working circular saw benches, deal and log sawing frames and planing ma chinery of the best type. This one fact speaks sufficiently for the volume of business doue, and for the just claim of this noteworthy house to prominent rank and mention among the typical metropolitan industrial concerns it is the purpose of this work to concisely review. J. J. Keliher & Co., Letterpress Hand Lithographic Account Makers, &.c. 33. King William Street, E.C. \u2014 A well-known house representing the printing trade is that conducted by Messrs. J. J. Keliher & Co., which was founded by them in 1885. The premises occupied are extensive, and are well apportioned as composing and machine rooms, warehouses, &c, the entire depot being excellently fixtured and appointed. The working plant and machinery utilised in the business is of the most modern construction, and kept in good order. The industrial operations- of the house consist of the turning out of all kinds of mercantile printing and lithography, while the branch to which special attention is devoted is the manufacture of account books for all kinds of commercial operations. They are also printers and proprietors of the Volunteer Record and Shooting News, the popular volunteer paper, and have also developed duritif the last two years a depot for military publications and volunteer requisites. The business is well organised, and a large staff of skilled operatives is- permanently employed. Tact and energy are eveiywhere conspicuous elements in the conduct of the establishment. The trade is almost entirely of a metropolitan character, beiDg well established among the leading bankers, public companies, and large mercantile houses. The chief part- ner, Mr. Keliher, is a gentleman well known in the trade for his business integrity and practical knowledge of printing, having been for many years connected with the celebrated house of Letts, Son, & Co., Limited, the far-famed diary publishers. He always extends the greatest courtesy to his patrons, and the prompt attention given to all orders has gained for him the esteem and regard of his numerous customers. most representative character, and whether in fish, poultry, or game, a customer can always rely upon obtaining what he requires at prices so moderate that the resources of the concern are placed within the reach of all classes. The house has long since attained most distinguished promi nence trom the select and influential character of its patronage. The elite of the neighbourhood are included in the coDuection, and it must be a highly important feature in its operations to cater for both Houses of Parliament. This fact alone is sufficient to show the favourable character of the establishment, and the degree of confidence it has secured from all classes of society. The premises are most eligibly situated opposite Victoria Station ; they are of enormous dimensions, divided into depart ments, one portion of the building being devoted to an oyster luncheon bar and restaurant, while the remainder is occupied in the general trade of the establishment. A branch is situated at 45, Wilton Boad, in the imme diate neighbourhood. For cleanliness and general regularity they cannot be surpassed, and the fittings are of a most elaborate character. Mr. Overton received a diploma from the Fisheries Exhibition for services rendered, and from the Inventions Exhibition received a certificate of thanks for the same cause. The restaurant is fitted up in the most artistic manner, and affords accommodation for seventy persons. It is very con venient for theatre-goers, as it remains open till 12.30 p.m. A large staff is employed, and the proprietor gives his personal attention to the busi ness.

Kibby, Burnishing and General Ironmonger, Lock smith, and Bellhanger, 94 and 96, Stratford Grove, Stratford, E \u2014 One of the oldest and best known ironmongery establishments, not ouly in Stratford hut in the entire east-end of London, is that conducted by Mr. W. Kibby, at 94 aud 96, Stratford Grove. Established in 1773 (considerably over a century ago), it has ever since maintained a position almost unique among metropolitan concerns in the ironmongery busiuess- The premises occupied are fitted and arranged in the most substantial, neat, and complete manner. The stock of goods on hand is in its line one of the most comprehensive, embracing everything known to the trade, in cluding builders' requisites of all descriptions. General repairs and smiths' work of all descriptions are executed by workmen on the premises. The repute of the house among builders in all paits of the metropolis'stands very high. The premises run back to a depth of about 100 feet, and possess a frontage of considerable extent ; an idea may therefore be formed from a knowledge of tbe fact that the building is filled to its utmost capacity with goods suited to meet all demands that may be made upon its resources. Mr. Kibby has been in possession of the establishment for the past thirty-sour years. During this period he has greatly extended the connections of the house, and built up a reputation for honourable dealing that enables him to adequately maintain the long-established repute he so justly deserves Harvey & Sons, Tailors and Outfitters, Palmerston Buildings, .'it, Old Broad Street, E.C. \u2014 Among the leading City tailoring houses undoubted preference should be given to such firms as Messrs. Harvey & Sons, of Palmerston Buildings, 34, Old Broad Street, E.C. This concern was established in 1865 by Mr. U.S. Harvey, in Cornhill, from whence he removed to Change Alley, and, three years ago, to the present address. Mr. Harvey has since been joined by his sons, and they have formed a business of first-class reputation. Mr. Harvey is a cutter of superior ability, and the members of the firm are all tailors of practical experience. A first-class stock of materials is kept well up to date in patterns and textures. The firm are practical shirt makers, and do a large business in general outfitting, making up complete outfits for India and the Colonies, and among all the numerous patrons of the establishment the proprietors are held in high esteem and respect.

This establishment, known as the \" China Tea House,\" was founded by a Mr. Christie, as has been stated, early in the present century. This gentleman was suc ceeded by a Mr. Barker, when subsequently the business was taken over by Messrs. Harvey and Shillingford, under which title it is now carried on. To begin with, Messrs. Harvey & Shillingford are importers of both tea and coffee, these two indispensable articles having been made the leading lines of .his firm ever since its foundation, and for their excellence the China Tea House has gained a high reputation. Being, as we have said, importers of tea and coffee, Messrs. Harvey & Shillingford have many advantages over ordinary dealers, importing as they do in such vast quantities, and exercising in the selection and blending of their teas that care and judgment which are only acquired by proper training and lon-r experience. The same may be said of the coffees sold by this firm ; per sonal supervision is given to the roasting of the raw bean, and to the important point of supplying it always freshly ground. The French coffee prepared and packed by Messrs. Harvey & Shillingford is a mixture of very fine East India and plantation coffee, with only the necessary \u2022quantity of chicory ground with it to absorb the volatile essence of the coffee, which renders it better and more economical than pure coffee, as it will keep its strength and flavour longer. Of general groceries this firm holds very large stocks ; dealing only with the best houses, and buying for cash, Messrs. Harvey & Shillingford are enabled to offer goods of the finest quality at prices which, in many cases, are below manufacturers' prices to smaller buyers. The head establishment is situated as above, and the branches at 34, Stamford Hill ; 3, Stroud Green Boad ; 86, High Boad Kilburn; and at 36, High Street, Hampstead. This old-established house, by reason of its long association with this locality, has come to be re garded more in the light of an indispensable institution than as a private \u25a0enterprise. The present proprietor of the business, Mr. Shilliugford, is a gentleman who has had a long practical experience, and whose business abilities, energy, and enterprise have placed him in tbe possession of one \u25a0of the largest and most flourishing establishments in the north of London.

The offices and warehouses are extensive, well situated, and admirably adapted in every way to the requirements of the trade. The stock comprises leathers of all varieties, such as East India tanned skins or Persians, mock kid Persians, imitation Strasbourg moroccos, levant goats, glace goats, black and coloured roans, white and black beading, coloured skivers, glace, calf, and glove kid, and calf kid roundings. This business is con ducted with great energy and enterprise, and possesses one of the best connections in the trade. Mr. Jacobs exhibited at the Agricultural Hall in 1882, and at the Crystal Palace in 1884, and was very highly com mended at both; and the opinions of the various trade journals on these exhibits were of a flattering character. John Lovett King, Music Publisher, &c, Highbury Corner, St. Paul's Boad, N. \u2014 London is the head-quarters of the music publishing trade, and many of the firms engaged in it are known all over the world. A thoroughly representative house in this line is that known as \" King's Music Warehouse,\" which was established at 86, Upper Street, in 1863, by Mr. John King, sen., removing to the present address in 1879. Mr. John King, sen., formerly partner in the firm of Messrs. Moore & Co. (now Moore & Moore), carried on the business until his death in 1871, when he was succeeded by his son, Mr. John Lovett King, the present proprietor. The shop occupied is spacious, lofty, of attractive appearance, and elegantly fitted up to meet the requirements of the trade. Over the shop is a large lofty room, with excellent acoustic properties, and eminently suitable for music practice and lessons.

Barlow, Wholesale Tin Box Manufacturer, 115, Great Cambridge Street, Hackney Boad, E.\u2014 The various uses to which tin boxes are applied in the general routine of business provides a most valuable and extensive field for the operations of the enterprising manufacturer.

The superiority of its manufactures is manifest in every item in stock. The productions of the establishment have obtained a widespread notoriety. The variety of uses to which they are put, and the numerous manufacturers who use them, have given them a circulation that has proved a valuable advertisement to the inexhaustive resources of Mr. Barlow.

Under his tuition Mr. Fuller has proved himself an expert pupil, and his present prominence and activity cannot fail to perpetuate the memory of his uncle's ability and reputation. The same superiority that was visible in the manufactures of Mr. Clarke is noticeable in the productions of the con cern under review. No house in the trade manufactures in larger quantities, and the export transactions alone are of considerable importance. This popular instrument is manufactured from different material, brass, tin (plain, crystallised, and decorated) &c, and for artistic finish, sound construction, with the necessary tone, the excellence of every article cannot be surpassed.

This establishment has an interesting history extending over many years, upon which it claims the distinction of being the oldest commercial house in the district. However this may be, it is at once apparent, even to an ordinary observer, that it is the best and most exten- sive in its line. As grocers, Italian warehousemen, and wine and spirit merchants, their establishment is one of the best concerns in the metropolis, and it is unquestionably the most prominent in East London. From the earliest period Messrs. Felgate & Son have made excellence a sine qua non in all their operations. About eight years ago they purchased the old-established wholesale wine and spirit merchant's business of Bose Neal & Son, of 252, Mare Street, and in these separate premises this important branch receives constant and minute attention. By availing themselves fully of the advantages of the Government Bonded Stores for maturing to the requisite age their importations of foreign wines and spirits and their purchases of Scotch and Irish malt whisky, the whole of these premises are available for the subsequent operations of bottling, &c. To this business has been added that of Messrs. Dennis Bros., wine merchants, formerly of Hackney, purchased by Messrs. Felgate & Son about five years since. The character of the operations at 264, Mare Street is not confined to the ordinary grocer's business, inclusive as it is of a high-class family trade, but is largely wholesale in the direction of catering for public institutions, such as workhouses, asylums, hospitals, and schools, which are supplied from their warehouse in Jerusalem Square. No firm in the metropolis has better resources, and the entire establishment is a remarkable exhibition of good taste, activity, and commercial prosperity.

S. Batti & Co., Proprietors and Manufacturers of Patent Medicines, 3, Jeffrey's Square, St. Mary Axe, E.C. \u2014 The patient and oftentimes laborious research which is being constantly made into the secrets of the vegetable kingdom is occasionally rewarded by the discovery of some powerful remedial agent that speedily proves itself of priceless value as a pain-curer. Amongst the very latest, and certainly amongst the most important of such discoveries, \" Meuphrosine \" may certainly be placed. Meuphrosine, the great sleep tonic, is described as a pure hydro-carbon, the extract of a South American root. It is claimed for Meuphrosine that it induces gentle, quiet, dreamless sleep for the overworked and the brain-weary, and that its constant use even is not attended with any deleterious or even objectionable results. Meuphrosine, indeed, tends to a perfect cure of sleeplessness, however caused ; also nervous complaints. It is declared absolutely free of opium, aconite, morphia, paraldehyde, bromides, Indian hemp and amylic compounds, laudanum, henbane, or chloral, or anything injurious. This is proved by analysis. It does not affect the action of the heart nor depress the brain, bat is a powerful aid to digestion. Although but very recently introduced into this country it has already found immense favour, while in India and China, for which countries it is especially suitable on account of the prevailing sleeplessness there, there is no doubt the sale will eventually be enormous when it becomes more widely known. The firm occupy capital warehouse, packing-room, and excellent offices. The principals are much respected and esteemed in the City of London. A.

Pantazidis, which, although only of recent estab lishment, bids fair to take a leading position in the trade. The importation of Egyptian cigarettes is now of considerable extent and importance among the foreign goods which find their way into the English markets ; but, like all other goods, many varieties are introduced which are not of genuinely good quality, and it is to such houses as the one now under notice to 'whom we are largely indebted for the introduction of the high-class and thoroughly reliable article. Mr. Pantazidis has had considerable experience in the cigar and cigarette trade, and is thereby enabled to offer special brands imported from Cairo direct from his factory, which is one of the best and largest in that city. A connection has been secured, and is well maintained, with the leading tobacconists in various parts of London and provinces, as well as a large trade with hotels, restaurants, clubs, and institutions, who are always well stocked with the various specialities and choice brands for which this house has already obtained so high a reputation."], [108, "124 MODEEN LONDON.

Fisher & Co., and known as the \" White Horse Brewery.\" The premises are far too small now for tbe trade carried on, and Messrs. Fisher & Co. are about to build a large and substantial brewery on the site of the old one, which has been established for just upon a hundred years. The secret of Messrs. Fisher Se Co.'s success has been a rule which they laid down some years ago, that their ales and stouts should be brewed from malt and hops only, and they give a guarantee on each cask sent out that such is the case. We believe that Messrs. Fisher & Co. are the only brewers in London who strictly adhere to this rule ; and it is for this cause that their ales and stouts are recommended by most of the celebrated West-end doctors, who have hitherto forbidden alcohol to patients suffering from gout, rheumatism. Sec, in consequence of the injury caused to the system by sugar, but who now safely recommend their Ales as a tonic for giving an appetite, and their Stouts as a restorative to those who are suffering from debility, sleeplessness, and a lack of nerve power.

In 1876 Mr. Higham purchased Mr. Dickinson's share in the business, and has since carried it on under his own name, employing about a dozen hands. The leading feature of the business is the supply of second-hand and reduced-priced new theological works, and it is open to question whether any single firm in the world has such an extensive assortment of works of this particular kind. The catalogue alone forms a very considerable-sized volume, comprising upwards of 14,000 items. About twelve months ago Mr. Higham added the mis cellaneous book trade to his business.

Model & Co., which was founded many years ago. This eminent firm, formerly located iu Howland Street, Tottenham Court Road, now occupies a most extensive and commodious suite of business and manufacturing premises, comprising a fine square block of four floors, with au area of fifty by eighty feet. Here Messrs. Model & Co. carry on very important operations in the manufacture of many classes of Japanese and other goods in bam boo, in connection with which they have achieved widespread celebrity.

Millets, Son, Ss Co., Wood Heel Manufacturers, 32a, Scrutton Street, Curtain Boad, E.C. \u2014 A prominent position in London trade must be given to Messrs. Millett, Son, Se Co., Limited, who manu facture wooden heels for boots and shoes. English artizans owe a deep debt of gratitude, if only in the way of example, to this noted firm for encouraging native industry in preference to depending upon foreign supply. The firm have patented their specialities, and this is the only house in the United Kingdom which manufactures wood heels. These patents were introduced by Mr. T. P. Millet I and his son, who is the head of this thriving concern. Mr. Millett recently formed his concern into a limited company for the purpose of developing the industry to the fullest extent. The company now holds patents for the wood turning machinery- and all its processes for the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Austria, America^ Canada, Victoria, and New South Wales. The German patent has been applied for, and it is anticipated at an early date this will be granted. The building in which the operatious of the company are carried on consists of a substantial four-storied structure, which is stocked with the patent machinery of Mr. Millett, and there is ample room for the employment of the several hundreds of hands engaged in the producing of wooden heels. These heels are largely used for ladies' dress shoes, and it is expected that they will eventually take the place of leather heels on walking shoes. To say that the success achieved is well deserved hardly expresses the amount of credit due to the proprietors, who have sounded and deve loped a very important and thriving branch of industry in this country.

W. Dart Se Co. This business was established originally in 1680, and has been carried on continuously at the same site. It is an historical fact worthy of mention, that it was here phosphorus was first made, and alchemy practised, and at the time it was a favourite meeting place for the leading chemists and philosophers of the day, who came to see tbe experiments which resulted so successfully. Under the enterprising management of the present firm the business has continued its prosperity. In addition to a general business as chemists, Messrs. W. Dart & Co. manufacture a number of excellent preparations, such as Bismuth, Carmine, Carbolized Sulphurine Lotion for diseases of the skin, Sulphur and Sarsaparilla for the blood, Sec Podophylin (or may apple), a valuable drug \u2014 a remedy for liver disorders \u2014 was first introduced in the form of pills by Mr. Dart in 1859. They have been recommended by many eminent physicians, and are still recognised as the only genuine vegetable antibilious aperient. Other standard preparations are Dart's Devonshire drink, Dart's ozonised tincture, and Dart's seaweed soap. These preparations are sold by leading pharmacies everywhere.

Hall & Sons, of the above address. This business was established over fifty years ago, and has enjoyed a prosperous career. The firm has won a national reputation for the superiority- and fine workmanship of its boots and shoes. The premises occupied at each of the above-mentioned addresses are fitted up iu a superior manner. A large stock of the best hand-made boots and shoes for ladies and gentlemen is kept. The lead ing speciality of the house is the leather known as Pannus Corium, which is remarkably soft and flexible, and is invaluable for those with tender feet or afflicted with orthop\u00e6dic ailments. The firm has a widespread and high-class connection in all parts of London and the country. It is such establishments as this that are the leading exponents of the various branches of metropolitan trade, and they well deserve the prominent position which the enterprise and ability of their proprietors have attained. H Leapman, Watchmaker and Jeweller, and Fur chaser and Dealer of Bankrupt Stocks, 1, Finsbury Pavement, E.C. \u2014This business has been in active operation considerably over seven years and has proved remarkably successful. The premises consist of an extremely handsome shop, occupying a commanding corner position. There are a commodious warehouse aud capital office attached. The shop is remarkably well furnished, and the stock is displayed with excellent taste. In addition to his customary trade as watchmaker and jeweller, Mr. Leapman makes a speciality of many cheap lines of fancy and other goods sold at prices very much under the ordinary rates. In these especially cheap lines Mr. Leapman has now secured a wide reputation, and his windows are always eagerly scanned by those in search of good value and exceptional bargains.

Mr. Lampard holds very large stocks in all departments incidental to grocers' business, these consisting of goods of the most superior quality in the market. As he buys very largely, he is enabled to supply customers at precisely the same prices as co-operative and other stores, but with no charge for ticket of membership, or other important incidentals peculiar to these institutions, and at the same time provide a greatly superior article. Among the specialities for which the firm are particularly noted a very prominent position is given to coffee. In this department the firm have gained great notoriety by the sale of what is known as Abbiss' Prepared Coffee. This is a most nutritious beverage, and consists of the finest coffee and chicory blended according to the recipe of the late Alderman Abbiss. Some people pretend to have a violent horror of chicory, but that is a very great mistake, and the best drinking coffees are undoubtedly those that contain a little chicory. This particular article is very cheap, viz., 3 lbs. in a tin for 2s. 6d., and is used by large consumers, and is very economical. Pure coffees up to 2s. per lb. are supplied to some of the first families in the land. Another leading feature consists of Belfe's Cocoa, which has been before the public for upwards of thirty years, during which time it has been very successful in gaining the public favour, both at home and abroad. The proprietor devotes special attention to the importation of tea, and supplies the public with all the most renowned and choice growths both of India and China. Fancy fruits, packed in very hand some boxes, as well as in plain wood, or sold loose, forms a very con siderable branch of this business. Mr. Lampard having at times very important orders in hand for presents, &c., a large and varied stock is always kept. A very large busiuess is done in all parts of the metropolis and the country, and the firm is one of the most thriving in the trade. J. W. Beegleniyer & Co., Tailors, 7, Finsbury Pavement, E.C. \u2014 Among the high-class tailors of the City, one of the best-known firms is that of Messrs. J. W. Beeglemyer Se Co., who are tbe proprietors of a very thriving business. Although the business has only been established about eight years, the proprietors have rapidly developed a very large and important trade, especially among the principal leading mercantile houses in the City and on the Continent. The proprietors have confined their attention strictly to the high-class trade. The stock of suitings and dress fabrics is certainly unsurpassed in London, and includes all the latest designs and patterns that have become popular. The showroom presents a very attractive appearance, being handsomely fitted, and contains a fine display of superior cloth, &c. Again, in the questions of make and design, the firm have directed their attention solely to producing garments of unsurpassed excellence, both for gentlemen's and ladies' wear. A large staff of highly experienced cutters are engaged, and the work is executed throughout by the most skilled workmen. Very careful supervision is exercised over every department. Proceeding on these lines the firm have acquired a first-class reputation, and have gained a very widespread and influential connection. Originally it was established in Fore Street, but the requirements of a largely increased trade led to its removal to the present commodious premises, which consist of spacious saloons, show rooms, workshops, Sec The business is ably conducted, and is now one of the most important in the trade. Jas. B. Hawkins, Publisher, 17, Paternoster Bow, E.C.\u2014 A very important branch of publishing is done in connection with the issue of ehromo-printed scripture text books, interleaved with selections from the poems of such well-known hymn writers as F. E. Havergal, Dr. Bonar, Charlotte Murray, and others. Among the leading firms thus engaged, the position of pioneer may very fairly be taken by that in the proprietorship of Mr. James E. Hawkins, whose business has been iu existence a great number of years, and who was the first to make this new departure in the publishing trade. Perhaps Mr. Hawkins' \" leading line \" in this connection is the issue of the Sixpenny Scripture Booklets, printed in colours and monotints. These commenced in 1887 with the \" Heavenly Dew \" series, which proved one of the greatest successes of the publishing * r-\\Hb season. They Wolff's Konditorei, S5, Ludgate Hill, E.C.\u2014 Upwards of twenty years ago was founded in Old Broad Street, in premises which were eventually pulled down, the well-known and notable establishment which has for the past fourteen years been conducted at 55, Ludgate Hill, E.C., under the familiar title of Wolff's Konditorei. This representative house was instituted for the sale of essentially German confectionery, and throughout the whole of a lengthy and prosperous career this one object has been closely and most creditably adhered to. Mr. Wolff occupies a large, handsomely-appointed, and well-lighted shop and refreshment-room on the ground floor, with extensive workrooms in the basement. The latter are fitted up and equipped upon the most approved principles, and in it a staff of thoroughly well-qualified and experienced German confectioners are constantly engaged in the production of the very finest German pastry and sweetmeats. Large aud distinctly superior stocks of these goods are held, and all specialite productions of the high-class \" Konditor \" are extensively dealt in. The refreshment room is well patronised. The patrons and frequenters of the Konditorei are chiefly Germans, and people who have resided in Germany ; but English people come in steadily increasing numbers, and include many of the aristocracy and best families. are followed this year by the \" Grace and Glory \" series, which is a distinct advance upon theformeroue.

Terry, Marble Mason, 33, Hoxton Square, E.C.\u2014 A very widely noted aud important busiuess in the marble masonry branch of trade is carried on by Mr. S. Terry, and has been established about fifteen years. This gentleman has a first-class reputation in all parts of the metropolis, more especially among builders. Employment is given to a large number of hands. In supplying builders Mr. Terry maintains a prominent position, and executes a large amount of highly artistic work. Chimney pieces are the leading features of this department, of many novel and special designs. A large business is done in fender curbs, &c, in various forms and sizes, and in addition to supplying marble work, great attention is given to what is known as enamelled slate, in which a very important business is done. Architects' designs are carefully carried out, and every description of plain and ornamental work is executed. A very extensive and influential connection exists among cabinet makers for marble slabs, tops, &c. A very extensive business is done, and Mr. Terry has gained a widespread and valuable reputation throughout the trade. of ;the beauty of the work. They are rightly described by a leading trade journal as \" tbe prettiest and, at the same time, cheapest booklets \" ever brought before the trade.\" The series of Autograph and Birthday Albums is also an interesting feature. These are printed in several colours, each page having a choice design upon it and a space for a friend's auto graph. The firm occupies very superior premises at the above address, whence the wholesale trade is supplied, and has also a branch establish ment for retail business at 36, Baker Street, W. Each of these make a very attractive display of chromo books, cards, texts, &c.

W. H. Oldridge, Leather Seller, 24, Stanhope Street, Newcastle Street, Strand, W.C\u2014 Mr. W. H. lOldridge's establishment was founded in 1837, and is one well known throughout the trade and by the public. The premises are of very considerable extent, the firm occu pying the whole ofthe building, and employing a numerous and efficient staff of hands. The chief feature of the business is the manufacture of uppers, which is carried on very largely, and has become widely noted among the high-class firms of bootmakers, &c. Mr. Oldridge includes among his important connection Her Majesty's Government, for whom he fulfils many extensive orders and contracts. The excellent workmanship displayed in the manufacture, combined with the first-class quality of the material u6ed, have resulted in this firm taking a most prominent position in the trade, and largely extending the connection in all parts of the country. Mr. Oldridge has managed his business with great ability, and been rewarded by a most successful and thriving trade. Geo. Lampard, Tea and Coffee Dealer and Grocer, 44, Bishopsgate Within, E.C. \u2014 There are not many firms that can go back to 1725 for the date of their origin, as can that now in the proprietorship of Mr. George Lampard. It is, with one exception, the oldest house in the tea and coffee trade throughout London. The proprietor is widely known as a tea and coffee merchant and grocer, and carries on a very thriving trade among private families and large institutions in all parts of London and the country. The chief premises are at 44, Bishopsgate"], [113, "MODEEN LONDON. 129 Steinway & Sons, Pianoforte Makers, 15 & 17, Lower Seymour Street, Portman Squire, W. \u2014 In 1853 the founder, coming n-iginally from Brunswick, Germany, established in New York the famous house of Steinway & Sons, which has since that date achieved a renown probably unprecedented in its world-wide extent in the annals of the piano manufacturing industry. This distinguished house, in addition to its headquarters in and near New York, and in addition also to a depot for the Continent of Europe, at St. Pauli, Rosen strassc, 20\u201424, in Hamburg, controls a separate house devoted to the interests of its very extensive connection in England and Great Britain generally. This house is situate at Nos. 15 & 17, Lower Seymour Street, Portman Square, \"W., and is familiar to every musical ear in the metropolis as Steinway Hall. Properly speaking, the hall rather adjoins the two numbers given than is included in them, and the latter embraces more particularly the offices and executive departments of the house. The premises, in their entirety, consist of two large and exceedingly commodious buildings, that comprising the hall being especially handsome and of fine outward appearance. The spacious and elegantly appointed show-rooms are situated upon the ground, and also upon the upper floors, and contain a superb stoi-k of Steinway pianofortes in every style, size, pattern and material, coming within the all-embracing scope of the firm's manufacturing operations. There are also fine regulating and repairing rooms, and lastly the excellent concert hall, one of the hand somest aud best patronized of its kind in the metropolis. The hall is admirably and most comfortably fitted up ; has accommodation for an audience of six hundred persons ; possesses effective acoustic properties ; and is tho scene, on an average, of two concerts daily during the height of the musical season. It does not come within our province here to discuss at any length the acknowledged superiority of Messrs. Stein way's pianofortes. But the rare qualities of these instruments are a subject of too great importance to be lightly passed over, although the exigencies of space forbid exhaustive comment. In view of this, however, it is as consolatory as it is eminently gratifying from an artistic standpoint, to remember that musicians and amateurs of every nationality are agreed ripon the opinion that as exponents ofthe highest phases of the grand art of piano building, and as exemplifiers of what can be attained and achieved in that art by the exercise of the highest technical knowledge and skill, Steinway & Sons stand to-day, and this may be said without seeming invidiousness, unequalled, and certainly unsurpassed. Everyone knows, either by practical experience or by authentic hearsay, of the wondrous improvements wrought and effected by this distinguished house in the manufacture of the m03t popular instrument of its own or any other age. Everyone is familiar with the names, at least, of the most salient of these improvements \u2014 ofthe new application of the Overstrung System, by spreading the strings in the form of a. fan upon the elongated sound-board bridges; of the valuable in vention of the Cupola Capo d'Astro Bar, which unyieldingly resists the strain of the strings concentrated upon it, thus rendering it possible to resist the pull of the btrings in a Steinway concert grand to the unequalled extent of 75,000 lbs ; shaped metal frames, in connection with the new construction of the inner and external casing in a number of layers of uninterrupted long-fibred wood, thus doing away with the grave disadvantage in grand pianos, of weakness at the treble part, where the arch of the case begins \u2014 \u25a0 a weakness so frequently manifested in instruments whose cases are constructed upon the old-fashioned principle with short pieces of wood ; of the purification of tone secured by the newly invented Steinway duplex scaling, resulting in a great increase oi duration in sound, and in a capacity for long remaining in tune and of the valuable application of a new tone -sustaining pedal, whose title suggests its utility; of the metallic tubular action frame, being entirely impervious to atmospheric influenced in connection with the new design of encasement, resulting in unerring precision, power, and delicacy of touch combined with durability. There are few indeed among the lovers of a perfect piano who are not familiar with the nature of these improvements, and ofthe countless en hancements of tone, purity, power, organ-like richness, and duration of sound, mechanical durability and lightness and quickness of action and response to which they give rise. In the face of the far-reaching renown thus achieved by these ma gnificent instruments in all their varieties of style, and of the laudatory commendation they have received over the signatures of such masters of their art as the late Abbe Liszt, Richard Wagner, Anton Rubinstein, and Hector Berlioz, further comment at our hands would be superfluous, if not actually tedious. And again, were still further proof of the superb quality of the Steinway pianofortes needed, the exhibition honours in all parts of the world of which the firm have been the recipients would more than meet the most exacting demands in this respect. From the date of its establishment up to the year 1862 the house of Messrs. Steinway received no fewer than thirty-five first premiums at the principal fairs of the United States, and since 1862 their pianofortes have been exhibited at tho world's international exhibitions only. At London, in 1862, they were awarded a first prize medal ; at Paris, in 1867, they obtained a grand gold medal, embodying most especial commendation ; at Vienna, in 1873, although the firm did not actually exhibit they met with that \" imitation \" which is the \" sincerest flattery,\" as recorded by the official reporter, who stated that \" more than two-thirds of the pianofortes exhibited were imitations of the Steinway Instruments.\" At the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, the house obtained the eminent distinction of the highest awards for the best pianofortes and the best pianoforte material, with the unanimous agreement of the judges that their instruments embraced \" The highest degree of excellence in all their styles ; \" at tho International Inventions Exhibition, Lindon, 1SS5, Steinway & Sons obtained the highest award in the power of the jury to grant, viz. : the \" Gold Medal, awarded to Steinway & Sons for giand and upright pianos, for general excellence, and several meriterioua aud useful inventions ; \" and in addition to all this they secured from tho illustrious Society of Arts, London, the distinguished honour of their Grand Gold Medal, awarded upon the recommendation of the jury of the Inventions Exhibition for tho best pianos in that exhibition, and for \" Beveral meritorious and useful inventions.\" Surely these honours suffice to amply justify the world-wide renown and repute that have attended the production and dissemination of the Steinway pianofortes. Stein way & Sons' pianoforte finishing manufactory is among tho largest and most notable of New York's immense industrial establishments ; and their magnificent show-rooms, located atNos. 107 \u2014 111, East Fourteenth Street, and associated with the American Steinway Hall, an institution of long-founded musical fame, are among the most attractive commercial and artistic depots to be found within the limits of the \"Empire City.\" In addition to this they control exceedingly extensive piano case and action factories, foundries, metal works, drying kilns, saw mills, and timber yards and basins, at Astoria, opposite One Hundred and Twentieth Street, New York City, where their establishment, forming a veritable industrial city in miniature, has come to be of such local significance that it is popularly known by the single appellation of \" Steinway.\" At Hamburg, also, the finishing factory of the house is upon a scale of great magnitude, and in the several centres of operations the firm afford employment to over a thousand hands, embracing labourers and skilled artisans of every conceivable class that can be associated with the making of any part whatever of a pianoforte. The London depot is conducted under the most able and energetic managerial supervision, catering with tho utmost care and satisfactory results to a widespread clientele in all parts of the United Eingdom. The aggregate trade of the house is enormou\", and of world wide extent ; the connection maintained among the highest musical circles in all quarters of the globe is of a most distinguished order, aud the reputation that has brought fame and renown to the Steinway instruments, wherever the art of music finds civilised exposition, is sustained in a manner which year by year tends to still further enhance its eminence and extend in every land and amongst every people the almost universal patronage secured. Fortnnm, Mason, & Co., Purveyors, 181, 182, 183, Piccadilly, W. \u2014 The distinguished house of Messrs. Fortnum, Mason, & Co. , purveyors to her Majesty, was founded nearly one hundred years ago at its present address. The premises occupied were rebuilt about 1827, and now constitute a most commodious and admirably arranged depot, of superb appointment in every department. The basement is devoted to the storing of an enormous stock of superior and carefully selected wines, among which are to be found the finest brands and vintages in ports, sherries, hocks, and Moselles, clarets, champagnes, Madeira, Sauternes, Burgundy, and wines of the Rhone, together with liqueurs, Cognacs, and fine spirits. On the ground-floor are the well-fixtured and heavily stocked wine sale room and the provision department. This latter is splendidly fitted up. The floor is covered with oilcloth, protected in the parts most exposed to wear by crimson carpets, and the fixtures and appointments throughout are in most superior style. In this department centres perhaps the chief feature of Messrs. Fortnum, Mason, & Co.'s extensive operations, that of provision purveying. The fine stock here displayed includes sine teas, coffees, cocoas, and chocolates ; sugars, spices, and condiments ; preserved fruits ; honey, marmalades, jams, and jellies ; specialities for the nursery and for invalids ; French confectionery ; all the daintiest foreign comestibles ; and preserved provisions, specially and most carefully prepared, and par ticularly suited to yachting and pleasure parties, sea-going vessels, and the uses of the family. Every requisite for the table is to be found within the spacious confines of this attractive emporium, and superior quality is the one distinguishing feature of each item. At the back of this prin cipal shop axe the neatly and tastefully furnished private offices of the firm ; and at the extreme rear of the premises are the export aud packing departments, the former heavily stocked with hams, bacon, teas, sugars, coffees, and other staple groceries. The upper portiona of the building are utilised as supplementary store-rooms. The fine show-windows, facing upon Piccadilly and Duke Street, are attractively dressed, and contain a miscellaneous collection of specimens of the high-class pro visions to be found in such profusion within. As purveyors of every description of high-class comestibles, Messrs. Fortnum, Mason, & Co. occupy a position of acknowledged pre-eminence among contemporaries in their line. They hold appointments to the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, and other members of the Royal Family, and numerous foreign potentates, and have been awarded high inedallic honours at London, 1S51 and 1S62, and Moscow, 1872. Their house has been mentioned in Dickens's \" Old London.\" The firm employ a large number of hands, many of whom have been for upwards of thirty years in their service. The Indian and colonial connections of the house aro of great extent, and an export trade is conducted which takes effect in every quarter of the world. The management of this widely-known and eminent establishment is characterised by energy and ability of tho highest order, and has always been such, that the house, from ita incep tion, has held and consistently maintained a commanding position among its competitors. The members of the firm are men of the highest social and commercial status.

At the Sydney Inter national Exhibition, 1879, Messrs. Griffin & Sons were awarded a special prize medal for chemical apparatus and graduated test solutions for water analysis by Wanklyn's process. In the manufacture of heating apparatus, Messrs. Griffin & Sons have invented many varieties of furnaces for the melting and reduction of metals, both by gas and the oil lamp ; their oil-lamp furnace for melting metals at a white heat is specially worthy of attention, being quite as powerful as the best gas furnaces, and is invaluable to those who have not the command of coal gas. This ex tensive and well-known business is carried on in splendid premises, with a noble facade, having one hundred feet frontage, and consisting of base ment and four floors above. Established now over sixty years, Messrs. Griffin & Sons have become the best-known house in the trade, both at home and abroad. The success of the firm is, doubtless, due to the scientific attainments of the founder, to his inventive genius, and the popularity of his scientific publications, combined with his well-known integrity and uprightness in all commercial transactions. It is such houses as this that enable the metropolis to strengthen and maintain its claim to the scientific and commercial supremacy of the world. Dickins & Jones, Hanover House, 232 and 234, Regent Street, W. \u2014 About one hundred years ago was established, originally in Oxford Street, the noted house known at the present day as that of Dickens & Jones. This eminent firm was first founded as Dickins & Smith, at the sign of the \" Golden Lion.\" In 1835, when tho business was removed to its present address, the style of the firm became Dickens, Smith, & Stevens ; and thirty years ago the present title was adopted It is interesting to note that the original sign of the \"Golden Lion\" is still to be seen outside the entrance to the present fine establish ment, it being in this connection one of the very few old-fashioned signs now remaining in London. The premises now occupied by this house are the result of successive enlargements and improvements since 1835, ren dered necessary by the continuously progressive character of the business, and stand to-day one of the finest business edifices in Begent Street. The block is of great extent, and comprises two houses in Begent Street and two in Argyll Street converted into virtually- one establishment, and most handsomely appointed throughout. The entire indoor and outdoor staff numbers about two hundred hands, and of these most of the Bhop assistants live on the premises, the residential accommodation for that purpose being excellent in all respects. This house was originally highly renowned as a leading establishment for linens ; but the main features of tho business now conducted consists, in addition to the linen department, which still maintains its eminence, in laces, costumes, mantles, and dressmaker's fine fancy goods. The display in the admirably arranged show-rooms is rich and attractive. Particularly is this the case in the lace depart ment, where are to be seen beautiful goods of almost every conceivable variety. There are some especially fine lines in antique Valenciennes, real Torchon, Mauresque point, in exquisite designs, and Chantilly ; while the lace handkerchiefs in various styles and materials must be seen to be appreciated. The completeness of the stock in this section is sustained in the costume, mantle, underclothing, glove, umbrella, and household linen departments. Specialities are made of wedding trousseaux, layettes, and fine evening and dinner dresses ; and in every line of the superb stock held the distinguishing features of high quality of material, good taste in design, and beauty and fine finish of workmanship are always prominent. The careful and artistic manner in which the entire stock is exhibited and arranged is no less worthy of high commendation than tho many and varied items of which the display is composed. As all Messrs. Dickins & Jones's goods are distinctly first quality, their patronage is of a correspond ingly superior order, and they have in their books many names of both home and foreign eminence. They have at different times supplied goods to most of the members of the royal family and to nearly all the courts of Europe, and their customers are numbered largely among the aristo cracy and the British merchant princes. The firm held a special appoint ment to the late King of Spain, and their establishment was honoured by a visit from his Majesty, and also from the late King Louis Philippe of Fiance, and many other distinguished personages. The general trade of the house, with connections of great and widespread influence, extends to all parts of the world, its foundation in India being particularly strong. The firm carry on one of the largest postal businesses in London, receiving every day a very great number of letters, to attend to which alone a numerous staff is specially detailed. The present partners are Mr. C. J. Dickins, Mr. H. F. Dickins, and Mr. J. P. Jones ; and these gentlemen, holding in view the high repute that has always attached to their dis tinguished house, spare no effort in the adequate maintenance of its exalted position, and the further enhancement of its well-merited renown in the commercial world. Waukenphast & Co., Boots and Shoes, Haymarket, S.W. \u2014 The distinguished house of Messrs. Waukenphast & Co., whose name has become a synonym in almost every part of the world for easy and true fitting boots and shoes, was founded in London some twenty years ago, and their fine shop in the Haymarket, with its admirable display of high class ladies' and gentlemen's footwear, is one of the most familiar and most attractivebusiness depots in that thoroughfare. The entire premises occupied are most extensive and commodious. The building has a street frontage of fifty feet, with lofty and spacious windows, and a rearward depth of about a hundred and thirty feet ; and the architectural style of the interior lends itself to the purpose of substantial and handsome appointment. The opportunities thus offered have been taken full advantage of, and no ex pense has been spared in making the capacious store what it really is \u2014 the finest suite of boot and shoe sale-rooms in the metropolis. At the rear of the first or gentlemen's show-room is a large and handsomely furnished saloon utilised as a special ladies' department. Particular attention is de voted to this important section, and Messrs. Waukenphast show therein a most attractive stock of ladies' fashionable boots and shoes, embracing all the newest styles in English and French goods, as well as of their own inimitable make. In this section also is included a fine selection of children's and young gentlemen's boots and shoes of Messrs. Wauken phast's own manufacture. In this latter connection the importance of the greatest care being devoted to the matter of true and perfect fit is obvious, and this firm have not failed to accord it the most ample recognition in catering for the more youthful portion of their clieritile. In the gentle men's department the stock is of course replete with a rich variety of foot wear. All the best classes of walking, military, and dress boots and shoes are shown ; and specialities consist in light summer boots of every descrip tion, for park, promenade, and ordinary uso, and also in touring and shooting boots, in which lines the goods held in stock have certainly been brought as near to perfection in make and material as it is possible to attain. Every item in each branch of the entire stock, when made by this firm, is stamped on the soles with their well-known trade mark, thus affording a guarantee of genuineness. A walk through these magnificent and perfectly appointed show-rooms, and an inspection of the unique ex cellence of each section of the stock therein contained, naturally suggest thoughts and inquiries as to the origin of the singularly complete syTstem of manufacture now so successfully conducted by this notable house. The renown of Messrs. Waukenphast as makers of boots and shoes is, however, too universal to require any accentuation here. Mention can only be made of what is already well known \u2014 tho object with which the firm first entered into their present sphere of operations : the laudable one of supplying a true-fitting boot or shoe that should combine with the advantages ofthe highest order of style and shape, the additional recom mendation of the most reasonable cash price that could be deemed compatible with the excellence of the article offered. With this end in view, the firm rigidly adhered to the uso of the best material and the em ployment of the most skilled and experienced workmen. Added to this, they designed and constructed every item of their enormous stock upon the strictest anatomical principles. The results of the principles thus adopted, and of the admirable manner in which it has been carried out, are apparent in the full satisfaction of patrons resident in every part of the civil ised world. Messrs. Waukenphast & Co. have agencies in every quarter of the globe : fr..m the United Kingdom itself to Australia and New Zea land, from Cape Colony to Canada, from India to the United States. In Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, the firm has very prosperous agencies, anil in each of those centres does a verv extensive trade ; and in all these lands the famous productions of their system may be readily obtained. The trade conducted by the house is of world-wide extent. The home patronage enjoyed is of a most distinguished order ; and testi monials from many a distant clime speak for the merits of their noted wares, and strongly indicate the fact that, as long as the value and advan tage of perfect fit, style, shape, and comfort in footwear are recognised, the admirable system of which Messrs. Waukenphast are the eminent exponents will continue to meet with the liberal meed of support and appreciation to which it is so justly entitled. Messrs. John J. Griffin & Sons, Manufacturers and Im porters of Chemical and Philosophical Apparatus, 22, Garrick Street, Covent Garden, W.C. \u2014 The science of chemistry has, during the last fifty or sixty years, developed in extent and in applicability to such enormous pro portions that the manufacture of apparatus and sundries used in analysis and scientific research has become an industry of the greatest importance, and one requiring for its successful prosecution an amount of ability and special training scarcely less than those required for the scienccsthemselves. The well-known firm of Messrs. John J. Griffin & Sons are acknowledged to be the originators of this industry. Founded in 1826, when the science of chemistry was emerging from its childhood, this firm has grown up as it were w ith it, and has contributed in an eminent degree to popularise the teaching of chemistry and kindred sciences in the schools and colleges, by the invention of delicate and scientifically constructed apparatus which greatly facilitate the operations of the lecture-room and the laboratory. The founder of this well-known firm was himself one of the first members of the Chemical Society, and a gentleman well-known in the profession as an author of scientific works, amongst which may be mentioned, \" Chemical Recreations,\" now in its tenth edition ; \" The Chemical Testing of Wines and Spirits,\" a very handy book, containing ready processes for the determination of the proportions of the chief constituents of wines ; \" A System of Crystallography,\" with its application to mineralogy ; also \"Scientific Handicraft,\" a course of elementary experiments serving to demonstrate the fundamental facts of physical sciences. All these works have been well received, and enjoy a popularity and widespread circula tion worthy of their great merit. At the first exhibition, heldin London in 18-51, Messrs. Griffin & Sons were awarded a prize medal for philosophical instruments and for economical and convenient chemical apparatus. At the International Exhibition of 1862 they also received a medal for philo sophical instruments and processes depending on their use, and one for"], [115, "MODERN LONDON. 131 T. W. Helliwell (of Brighouse, Yorkshire), 5, Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, S.W.\u2014 The London depot of the eminent house of Mr. T. W. Helliwell, controlling very extensive industrial works at Brighouse, Yorkshire, is located at the above address. At the Yorkshire head-quarters the operations conducted embrace all branches of patent glazing, zinc roofing, and horticultural building, perfected in ac cordance with Mr. Helliwell's patent new systems of imperishable glazing without putty, and zinc roofing without external fastenings. Mr. Helli- well's patent glazing systems are widely and favourably known to residents in all parts of the kingdom. The works at Brighouse, in Yorkshire, are fitted up with all the most modern machinery, and are capable of turning out a mile a day of glazing bars. These bars are made in zinc, copper, muntz metal, or steel. A large trade is done with the Colonies and America, and the bars and glass are packed with minute instructions as to fixing, so that no mistake can happen. As regards glazing, the advantages most prominent and important in Mr. Helliwell's system are non-usage of putty, nooutside and but little inside painting, no breakage from contraction or expansion, immense saving in maintenance and repairs, no increase in total cost over the old ordinary style, no drips from condensation, ability to be glazed in any weather, roofs light in appearance, and yet strong, no rattle, and no injury from vibration of trains or machinery, perfection of light, and the adaptability of straight glass to circular roofs. In the matter of zinc roofing, the advantages of Mr. Helliwell's process are \u2014 no solder is used in any part of the roof, there are no holes through the zinc work in any part, no external fastenings, full play is allowed in every direction for contraction and expansion, and if any alteration is necessary, the zinc roofing can be removed with ease and without damage, and can be as readily and safely replaced. Galvanized iron may be fixed on the same system, and with the same excellent results. In connection with his zinc roofing, it may be mentioned that Mr. T. W. Helliwell imports the best Silesian and Vieille Montagne zinc direct from the works. His systems have been adopted by the leading railway companies, markets, factories, weaving sheds, and for horticultural works of every description. The most striking exemplification of the fine appearance and thorough efficacy of his plan of zinc covering and glazing is to be seen in the magnificent circular roof of \" Olympia,\" the National Agricultural Hall at Addison Road, South Kensington, which was covered by Mr. Helliwell's process and under his direction in the remarkably short period of twelve weeks' time in the depth of winter. Many other notable buildings and railway stations in all parts of the kingdom have been covered in this manner also ; and the popularity of Mr. Helliwell's horticultural structures, con servatories, greenhouses, and other edifices of a similar kind is widespread. The systems of this firm have obtained high medallic honours, among them being the gold medal, Jubilee of Railways, Paris, silver medal, Agricultural and Horticultural Show, Manchester, first prize at York Ex hibition, the Banksian Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society, and the First Diploma at Forestry Exhibition, Edinburgh. The trade of the house is old-established, widespread, and well-connected ; and the business in all its branches is conducted with the most commendable energy and enterprise. Henry Johnson & Sons, Custom House, Shipping, and Forwarding Agents, 39, Great Tower Street, E.C. \u2014 As far back as the year 1814 the well-known house named above was founded in London by a Mr. Chinnery, who was subsequently joined by Mr. Henry Johnson and Mr. Samuel Chinnery, son of the founder. The firm then operated as Chinnery & Johnson, until the decease of the former and also the son of the same, when the title Henry Johnson & Sons was adopted, Mr. Johnson taking his sons as partners. The undertakings of this house embrace general shipping and forwarding transactions of all kinds. They forward by ship or steamer every class of freight and merchan dise to all parts of the world. They are foreign traffic agents to the Midland and the London, Chatham, and Dover Bailway Companies. The Continental operations of the firm are particularly important in their relation to British trade and commerce. The forwarding system of the house is in splendid working order, admirably organised and valuably connected. Messrs. Johnson & Sons are Custom House agents by authority. They also conduct transactions of considerable importance as general wine merchants, but this branch is quite subsidiary to the shipping and forwarding department. The firm occupy spacious and commodious premises, comprising general offices on the ground floor, and the accountant's department on the floor above. A branch establishment is controlled at 57, Bue D'Hauteville, Paris. The house is a most im portant and influential factor in the commercial world. William Holmes, Engraver, Lithographic, Letter- press, and Copper-plate Printer, 36, Basinghall Street, E.C. \u2014 Among the various trades and industries which contribute so materially to the commercial prosperity of the City of London, it is particularly gratifying to meet with a firm of such old standing and extensive business connections as that of Mr. William Holmes. The business was established over fifty-five years ago by a Mr. Waters, and was most success- fully carried on by him for many years, when subsequently the business was taken over by Mr. W. Holmes, a gentleman who has had a long practical experience in the trade. Each department is presided over by a competent manager, having a special knowledge of the work under his charge. Mr. Holmes does a very extensive business in lithographic, letter-press, and copper-plate printing, book illustrations, maps and plans of estates, colour printing, show boards, labels, invoices, circulars, and the lithographing of law forms and writings, and the printing of bank cheques and share certificates. In the office can be seen some beautiful specimens of this firm's work, which in clearness and excellence of execu- tion well display the superior talent of the operatives employed. The business in every department is conducted with characteristic ability, energy, and enterprise. The proprietor, Mr. W. Holmes, occupies a first- class position in commercial circles, and, by his well-known integrity and great business capacity, has gained the esteem and confidence of a very high-class and valuable connection.

Piesse & Lubin, Perfumery Factors, 2, New Bond Street, W. \u2014 The eminent house of Piesse & Lubin was founded between thirty-five and forty years ago under the same title and at its present address. The extensive premises occupied comprise a fine building of five storeys ; the elegantly appointed ground floor of which is devoted to the purposes of the retail trade solely, and constitutes one of the handsomest depots of its kind in the metropolis. The upper floors are used for manufacturing purposes, and are of great extent and most commodious arrangement. A bonded warehouse is conducted at St. Katherine's Docks, and the firm also control flower farms and stills at Mitcham, in SurreyT, and at Nice and Grasse, with a branch factory in Mill Street, Regent Street, W. Piesse & Lubin devote their entire attention to the distillation of the odours of plants and flowers, and in this connection their productive capacities are of almost unrivalled extent. The stock carried is enormous, and is distinguished by the greatest variety as well as for the thorough excellence of every item. The assortment in its entirety is too complete to allow of detailed review, but it is not too much to say that Piesse & Lubin hold everything that is likely to be called for by the patrons of a high-class perfumery establishment. They import ambergris musk, civet, Sinai manna, Pistachio nuts, vanilla, and otto of roses, and many of the rarest perfumes distilled in foreign climes. Among their manufactures are also to be found such items as toilet powders, odorous vinegars, dentifrices, pomatums, scented oils, perfumed soaps, cold cream, glycerine jelly, ivy paste, and toilet preparations generally ; whil6 their famous brands of scented waters, spirit of lavender, and scents for the hand kerchief have gained a world-wide and lasting renown. Their stock is further supplemented by a most attractive array of toilet fancy goods ; among which are many tasteful and novel conceits of various descriptions, and an assortment of supremely daintily and elegantly fitted toilet cases, in different kinds of fancy woods, and upholstered in Russia and other favourite leathers. Refined soaps, sponges, sachet powders, bath herbs, fumigating ribbons, and eau de Cologne are features of a stock whose every item is worthy of far more than passing note. This firm are also the manufacturers of the delightful fumigant known as Ribbon of Bruges. Some idea of the popularity of this article may be gathered from the fact that notwithstanding various unsuccessful attempts to imitate its exquisite perfume, several miles of it are weekly turned out from the factory in Mill Street. It is sold by almost every druggist and perfumer through out the civilised world. Piesse & Lubin devote careful attention to the compounding of private perfumery recipes, which they accomplish with absolute infallibility. The goods of this house wherever exhibited have been uniformly successful. London, 1851 and 1862; Paris, 1867, 1871, and 1878; Amsterdam, 1869; Moscow, 1872; Dublin, 1865; Vienna, 1873; and Philadelphia, 1876, all tell the same tale of honours achieved and medals awarded. The firm are also perfumers by patronage to the Courts of St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, London, Athens, and Brazil, and enjoy the support of a moBt distinguished circle of customers, in addition to an extensive home and foreign trading con nection. The business has always been conducted in the true spirit of commercial enterprise ; nothing has been left undone that might in the slightest degree conduce to the satisfaction of patrons, and all evidence now goes to make patent the fact that public appreciation has not fallen short in its reciprocal duties, but continues to uphold the house in the eminent position to which it has so justly attained. The chiefs of this firm have devoted considerable attention to the extension of the perfumery trade in this country ; originally almost exclusively French, it has, mainly through their efforts, been Anglicised. Their works, The Art of Perfumery, La Chiinie des Odeurs et des Parfums, Olfactics, &c, are standard authorities on the subjects of which they treat, and are widely read, having been translated into most European languages. From their pens emanate the articles on \" Perfumery \" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Chambers's Encyclop\u00e6dia and other such important publications. for sport in any part of the world, as snipe or tiger can be shot by simply using cartridges loaded with shot or ball. Its price is very moderate, namely, \u00a327. Another speciality of the house is a patent sour-barrel B.L. hammerless gun and express rifle, also a four-barrel hammerless pistol. Mr. Lancaster's latest hammerless gun is highly praised by all competent judges for its perfect automatic or independent safeties and automatic blocking safety for the main springs. This embodies strength and simplicity, ease of manipulation and stripping for cleaning pur poses. Another very successful speciality of this houso is the \"Spencer Repeating Shot Gun,\" a long-sought-for desideratum for sportsmen. This gun can be fired six times in three seconds. It is light, the parts are made of the best forged steel, and are interchangeable. This is a really first class gun at a very reasonable price. In the manufacture of his guns, rifles, and pistols, Mr. Lancaster uses nothing but the very best materials, and employs none but the most experienced workmen. With the superior facilities at his command, he is enabled to offer special advantages to customers, and to fill all orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. The showrooms contain a splendid assortment of the productions of the house. Mr. Lancaster is a gentleman whoso progressive enterprise and sterling integrity have won the esteem and confidence of the com mercial community. Charles Russ, Court Furrier, 70, New Bond Street, W.\u2014 Often has the secret of England's greatness been attributed to the wealth and vast character of her manufactures, and there is some amount of truth after all in the old emperor's sneer that we are a nation of shopkeepers. But if it be so, we are proud of the fact, for upon England's commerce depends the greater part of the civilised world. There is not a manufactory in England that does not play its part, how ever humble, in spreading civilisation and opening up commerce between nation and nation. London, as the great national centre of commercial activity, has in no industry attained greater perfection or a more deserved reputation than in the production of fine furs. In this connection it is a pleasure to make prominent mention of such a thoroughly representative establishment as that of Mr. Charles Buss, Court Furrier, 70, New Bond Street. This business was established in 1865, and from its inception has enjoyed a prosperous career, its growth being in keeping with the sound judgment and activity displayed in its management. The premises occupied are spacious and commodious, admirably arranged and equipped with every requisite for the transaction of business, a large force of skilled hands being engaged. The stock held is the largest, as it is tho most complete assortment of fine furs in the metropolis. Every depart ment of the furrier's trade is carried on successfully by Mr. Russ. He is a heavy purchaser in the leading markets of the world, and manufactures all his own goods from the raw material. Employing none but the best and most experienced help, and giving close personal supervision to all details, he is enabled to produce goods which for beauty and originality of design and superiority of workmanship are unexcelled. He does a large and high-class retail trade with the rank and fashion of the metropolis, and is furrier by appointment to several courts. Among his leading specialities are fur seal mantles, fur-lined travelling cloaks and coats, carriage wrappers, &c. With the superior facilities at his command, Mr. Russ is able to offer special advantages to customers, and to execute all orders with despatch. The merit of his goods is evidenced by the high appreciation in which they are held by the best classes, and in addition to this fact Mr. Russ was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. In the wholesale department of his business he does a trade which extends to all parts of the world. His connections are of a superior character and his reputation in the commercial world is of tho highest. Personally Mr. Russ is an energetic, clearheaded business man, honourable and exact in all transactions, and highly esteemed for his strict integrity and sterling personal worth. The success that he has achieved is as substantial as it is well deserved, and the career of his establishment is creditable alike to himself and the great industry in which he is an important factor. Charles Lancaster, Guns, Rifles, and Pistols, 151, New Bond Street, W. \u2014 A most important branch of metropolitan industry is the manufacture of guns, rifles, and pistols, and in this connection it is a pleasure to make prominent mention of an old-established and thoroughly representative house, and one whose productions have won a world-wide reputation for superiority and reliability. We refer to that of Mr. Charles Lancaster. This houso was established in 1826, and from a comparatively small beginning its trade has steadily developed and increased, its growth being in keeping with the energy- and sound judgment displayed in its management. The premises occupied at 151, New Bond Street, are spa cious and commodious, admirably arranged, aud fitted up in a very attrac tive manner. The manufactory is at No. 2, Little Burton Street, where a force of expert workmen is employed, in addition to a complete equipment of the most improved modern machinery and appliances. The guns and rifles manufactured by this establishment are triumphs of inventive genius and mechanical skill. They have been awarded seventeen first-class prizes and medals, among which may be mentioned three medals at the Inter national Exhibition, Calcutta, and the gold medal at the International Inventions Exhibition. Mr. Charles Lancaster is the inventor of a non fouling smooth oval-bore rifling, which is the best and most valuable pro duction in the gun-making trade. \"The Colindian \" (registered), a rifled gun for shot and conical-shaped \" express\" bullets, is the best weapon Arup Bros., The Ipsen Terra Cotta & Fine Art Pot tery Works, Copenhagen : 120, New Bond Street, W. \u2014 One of the most famous establishments in Europe devoted to the production of terra cotta and fine art pottery, is the Ipsen works, located at Copen hagen, Denmark.

They also receive from time to time large consignments of sponge, consisting of stable and carriage sponges ; and bath and toilet cups, including some very fine specimens which they exhibit at their warehouses, and supply to shippers and large buyers. Specialities are numerous, and some are of high merit, notably Vickery's Air Pannels, whereby a saddle may be instantaneously adjusted to fit any horse without professional assistance, and Scott's Patent Safety Stirrup, one of the simplest and best contrivances of the kind yet introduced. All the firm's manufactures in saddlery and harness are hand-stitched and London-made, and are remarkable for strength, durability, soundness of material, and great beauty and fineness of finish. Messrs. Jenkinson were awarded a prize medal at the Calcutta Exhibition of 1883-84, for superiority of workmanship and excellency of design. A numerous force of skilled workmen is employed. The trade controlled is wholesale and of great magnitude, and the firm do a great volume of business with leading We6t-end houses, and maintain a valuable and influential connection among wholesale and retail firms in all parts of the world at large. Joseph Prime & Sons, Export Provision Merchants, 27, Commercial Street, E. \u2014 The export provision trade of the metropolis is of very great value and extent, and certainly one of the most important branches of commerce for which the capital has acquired such universal fame. In referring to this department of industry, it is a matter of simple justice to make prominent mention of an old-established and leading firm such as Joseph Prime & Sons. This firm was founded in 1829, and is consequently one of the oldest in the export provision trade of London. They occupy very extensive and admirably fitted and arranged premises at the above address. All sorts of provisions are dealt in, and special features are made of cheese, hams, and bacon, for the excellence of which the firm has acquired a widespread reputation. The connections of the house are of far-reaching effect, and embrace in particular the leading shipping firms in the City and other parts of the country. The principal markets for the firm's produce are South America, India, and the colonies, in all of which Messrs. Prime & Sons have long been held in high esteem. They make a special point of dealing in produce of the first class only. Their sources of supply are so extensive and so varied that they always have their stock fresh and full, and are ever in a position to execute any order. Their goods are sold at the lowest remunerative prices. For all these reasons the trade is influential and very steady, and the firm is justly entitled to be regarded as a thoroughly representative metropolitan establishment in the export provision and produce trade. and silver work, gem jewellery, writing cases, electro -plated goods, dressing eases, art stationery, fine cutlery, and fancy goods of the finest English and foreign manufacture, all tastefully arranged in the handsome W. Rammage Ss Co., Engineers, Ironfounders, and Iron Contractors, 42, Old Broad Street, E.C. \u2014 One of the well-known London firms is that of Messrs. W. Eammage & Co., engineers, of 42, Old Broad Street. This representative house was established about ten years ago by Mr. William Eammage, who had previously had thirty years' experience in engineering and ironfounding work, and who has since been joined by his son, Mr. A. W. Eammage, CE. The special branch of the trade followed by the firm consists in constructional ironwork for large buildings of all descriptions. In this department Messrs. Eammage do a very extensive trade, supplying girders, columns, pillars, joists, plates, cisterns, and other indispensable ironwork to builders, architects, and con tractors all over the country. They provided part of the ironwork for the huge structure of \" Olympia,\" at West Kensington ; and several hundred tons of their constructional ironwork was used in the building of Winchester House, Old Broad Street. Especially beneficial to the firm has been the introduction of Mr. A. W. Bammage's two valuable patents \u2014 Rammage's Patent Steel Decking for Bailway Bridge Floors, and Bammage's Patent Composite Fire-proof Column. The first-named has been very favourably reported upon by many eminent railway engineers. By stretching the patent steel decking across the floor of the bridge, an enormous additional strength is imparted to it, quite obviating the use of the powerful iron cross-girders hitherto generally employed. The patent composite column consists of a powerful steel inside column, in the diametrical form of a cross, encased in a steel cylindrical column of great strength, rivetted together, the spaces intervening between the two being filled compactly with concrete. When submitted to intense heat the concrete lining preserves the inner column, and the latter being firmly rivetted to the outer cylinder, the whole support remains perfectly intact. The firm is about to be formed into a limited liability company. Illustrated sheets are sent out by the house, on application, to all intending purchasers. showrooms. The most unique and artistic novelties that inventive genius and manufacturing skill can produce in any part ofthe world may be found at this establishment. Mr. Barker travels the Continent in search of fresh novelties. His superior facilities and connections enable him to offer special advantages whereby he is enabled to meet any order. The affairs of this house are conducted upon a sound and honourable basis, and the success attending his efforts is the natural result of this. Mr. Barker is an energetic, clear-headed business man, and is esteemed for his strict integrity aud ability; and the patronage secured is drawn largely from the rank, wealth, and fashion of the kingdom. The above illustrations represent two of Mr. Barker's most recently patented novelties. W. Jenkinson & Co., Manufacturers of Hand-stitched Saddlery and Harness, 44.

The fine show window looking upon Picca dilly is always most tastefully dressed, and its contents being changed every week, it naturally forms a feature of great attraction to the habitues of the great fashionable West End promenade. The interior aspect of the depot is, one might say, absolutely fascinating, rich, and tasteful in the highest degree. There are few species of artistic ware so conducive to the general attractiveness of the place in which it is displayed as fine sculp ture ; and the show-room of Messrs. Bellman & Ivey is literally crowded \u25a0with beautifully wrought pedestals, supporting busts, statues, and statu ettes of exquisite workmanship, and in a variety of materials, including bronze, marble, and terra-cotta. The display is as admirable in the arrangement of its every detail as it is complete in the number of the various items which go to make up its rich entirety. Another exhibition gallery, at the rear of the principal shop, is fitted up in a manner most artistic. At the back is placed an elaborately chased and carved marble screen, in the centre of which is a long mirror. Before the mirror is a pedestal, upon which reposes a fine statue of white marble, and on either side of which is placed a plant of delicate foliage. The floor is covered with a neutral blue cloth carpet, imparting a peculiar richness to the room ; and the effect is completed by the suberb selec tion of high-class works which are harmoniously grouped in every vantage spot of the gallery. There are marbles by Nelson Maclean, fine originals by. Papworth, ideal busts from the chisel of Cowper, the great American sculptor ; works by \"the leading Italian masters ; originals in terra-cotta, by Drury and Van der Straeten ; a collection of fine bronze work from the principal European founders, including medals and bronzes of the Paris salons, and a most attractive assortment of Russian bronzes, modelled by Lieberich and Gratchoff . Messrs. Bellman & Ivey also display the celebrated Tanagra figures of R. Lechner, of Vienna, beautiful works reproduced from the gems of the Berlin Museum, the Paris Louvre, and other famous public and private collections ; and they deal largely in real marble, Algerian onyx, and other materials adaptable to the uses of the sculptor's art. Perhaps the greatest speciality of this house, however, is embodied in their celebrated Scagliola marble, a substance suited to all purposes in which other marbles are employed, such as for columns, pilasters, wall lining, dados, architraves, and span drils in building, and for pedestals for statuary, bronzes, and other sculptured work. For all purposes of interior decoration it is admirably adapted ; it can be turned, moulded, or cast to any shape or design ; is practically indestructible with ordinary care ; is always from one-fifth to one-third the price of marble, and is light, durable, and susceptible of a brilliant and perfectly natural polish, which will, when properly executed endure for many years without requiring renewal. In this material Messrs. Bellman & Ivey handle in all some thirty varieties. They are also the original patentees of Parian cement, a material which is now acknowledged by the most eminent builders to be an indispensable factor of wall-work, where durability is the desideratum. The polished variety of this cement is of a highly decorative nature, and is capable of taking and retaining the most delicate tints. Both Scagliola marble and Parian cement have been introduced by this firm into their most extensive build ing operations ; and numbers of the finest private residences and public edifices in the kingdom testify to the advantages that have resulted from their use. Messrs. Bellman & Ivey hold a special appointment to her Majesty the Queen ; they have enjoyed the patronage of H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and of his late Royal Highness Prince Leopold, together with that of the nobility, gentry, and leading architects ; and they are large contractors to her Majesty's Government. Prize medals were awarded to this house for the excellence of its exhibits at the great exhibitions, London, 1851 and 1862. The firm's works are situate in Edward Street, Dorset Square, N.W., and in Vine Street, Clerkenwell, E.C., where they employs staff of about eighty operatives. Messrs. Bellman & Ivey cater for a superior class of custom ; they send their goods to every part of the world, and enjoy a prestige and prosperity that are the results of the admirable and energetic manner in which their eminent business has ever been con dneted. their well-known productions to the stock of tbe establishment in hand ware. In every department this firm has a first-class trade. Only the best kinds of each article are kept, and the business is very extensive. In this particular business this is one of the principal firms in the West End, and has a renowned and widespread reputation. J. B. Johnstone, Military Tailor, 34, Sackville Street, W. \u2014 Forty years ago was founded the eminent house of Mr. J. B. John stone, military tailor and cap and accoutrement maker, who has for the past thirty-three years been located at his present address. The premises here occupied comprise a spacious three-storey edifice, the whole of which is devoted to the purposes of the business. In the basement is to be found the packing room, where all goods are made up. On the first floor is situate the handsomely appointed pattern and reception room, tastefully furnished, and admirably stocked with a well-arranged and exhaustive assortment of high-class piece goods. Adjoining these is the well ordered and fixtured cutting room. On the second floor are located the counting-house, neatly and conveniently fitted up ; three fitting rooms, handsomely furnished, and equipped with large patent gilt-framed robing mirrors; also artificial or \"dummy\" horses*, with steps to mount, for ladies' convenience in trying on riding-habits ; and lavatories. On the top floor are the workrooms, well lighted, ventilated, and benched, and notably neat, clean, and in good order. Mr. Johnstone produces the highest class of ladies' and gentlemen's tailoring only, and employs a staff of over sixty operatives of tried skill and efficiency. The goods of this house are sent to all parts of the world ; and a flourishing branch depot is in active operation at 59, Dawson Street, Dublin. Mr. Johnstone has been honoured with the patronage of several members of the royal family, and of the most distinguished circles of home and foreign custom ; and every department of his deservedly prosperous business is conducted in a manner quite commensurate with its long establishment and eminent repute among its West End contemporaries. Day & Martin, 97, High Holborn, W.C. \u2014 The history of modern mercantile enterprise has no more striking example of well-directed energies and commercial skill than is to be seen in the career of such a thoroughly representative London establishment as that of Messrs. Day & Martin, manufacturers of blacking and kindred products. A century and over has rolled by since the foundation of this concern was laid, and during the intervening years it has steadily developed the field of its operations and kept pace with the growing demands of a critical world. Messrs. Day & Martin's mammoth ware house is one of the architectural features of an historic thoroughfare. The building is of spacious dimensions, and is equipped throughout with every facility and convenience for the transaction of business. Employ ment is given to upwards of 200 hands. An immense stock, including a complete assortment of all the celebrated manufactures of the firm, is stored in this warehouse, and throughout the entire establishment there prevails a perfect system of organization, which facilitates the transaction of business, and insures the prompt and satisfactory execution of all orders. The firm has another very extensive establishment at No. 61, Com mercial Road, Liverpool. They have established agencies in every trade centre of the earth, and, as may be inferred, the manufacturing faculties necessary to supply the demand are upon an equal scale of magnitude. The specialities of this house have again and again demonstrated then superiority over all others when placed in competition. At the Paris Exhibition of 1867 the only prize medal for blacking was awarded to Day & Martin. They received a gold medal and diploma of honour at the Boston, U.S.A., Exhibition of 1883, and were awarded the only gold medal at the London International and Universal Exhibition of 1884. Messrs. Day & Martin are manufacturers to her Majesty the Queen, and are contractors to the Army and Navy. Although the firm manufactures numerous articles, it is in the matter of their celebrated Japan Liquid and Oil Paste Blacking that they are most widely known. These are manufactured from the very best materials for nourishing and preserving all kinds of leather, and produce a high and lasting polish. Another celebrated production of the house is its kid renovating polish, which has a reaUy wonderful effect upon kid that has become \" roughed\" or tanned with age. Other justly famed specialities of the house are Brunswick black and Berlin black, brass burnishing paste, harness blacking, waterproof dubbin, and ladies' blacking. The standard reputation of these goods, both with the trade and public, is established beyond the requirements of praise. The liberality which has at all times characterized the management of this old reliable house is well illustrated hy the fact that it haB from time to time fully equipped over one thousand men and boys as shoeblacks, upon no other condition than that of their possessing a good character. Many other instances of liberality could be cited, and it is not to be wondered at that every shoeblack in the kingdom exhibits on the front of his box the statement, \" Day and Martin's is the best blacking.\" The firm has been for years an important factor m the industrial activity of London. Its name has been a shining light in the annals of progress, and has been immortalized on one of the happiest pages of English fiction\u2014 Pickwick. The affairs of the house are under the able guidance of one whose judgment and ability are in keeping with the time-honoured traditions of the establishment. D. L. lord, Hosier, &c, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, Burlington Arcade, W. \u2014 Mr. D. L. Lord is the proprietor of one of the principal houses of business in the Burlington Arcade, trading as hosier, glover, and shirt-maker. The shops are five in number, and the division walla having been removed, form one large establishment, which contains a varied and extensive stock. A large staff is necessarily employed in this business, and the artistic manner in which the assistants dress the res pective windows with gloves, ties, shirts, &c, is one of the features of the Arcade. A great trade is done in shirts, for the quality, workman ship, and fit of which this firm is very widely noted. A large and varied stock of all kinds of hosiery is held by Mr. Lord. Gloves, of which the beet kinds are kept, also form a very important branch of this business. Worcuoter, Ludlow, Yeovil, Leominster, and Woodstock, all contribute"], [119, "MODEKN LONDON. 135 Dakin & Co., Tea and Coffee Merchants, 1, St. Paul's Churchyard, E.C. \u2014 There are few, indeed, among those in London who really love and appreciate the merits and value of genuine high-class teas and coflees, to whom the name of Messrs. Dakin & Co. is not pleasingly familiar. This eminent house, whose name has practically become a synonym for purity and excellence in teas and coffees, was founded in 1844 by Mr. William Dakin, the present principal, whose avowed object in instituting the firm and establishment was to supply the public with tea and coffee of absolute purity, and with that class of goods alone. The course thus marked out at the commencement of the career of the house has never once been swerved from ; the object held up to be achieved has been attained in every sense ; and the well-ordered depot of Messrs. Dakin in St. Paul's Churchyard, and also at the other addresses to be mentioned hereinafter, continues to be to-day, as it has ever been, an establishment whereat critical judges of colonial produce may depend upon finding something to meet their most fastidious requirement, and where those who, though appreciative, do not pose as connoisseurs may rely upon conscientious catering without fear of imposition. Messrs. Dakin & Co.'s business has always been conducted from head-quarters at its present address in St. Paul's Churchyard, a spot familiarly and commonly known as No. 1, London; and in connection with this chief establishment flourishing branches exist at Oxford Circus, W., and at Nos. 63, 65, and 67, and 77, Carter Lane, E.C. All four establishments are constantly under the watchful care and personal supervision of the bead of the house ; the premises in each case are large, commodious, well-appointed, and attractively arranged ; the best of good order aud neatness prevails at every depot ; and a numerous and competent staff afford prompt and efficient attendance to the wants and requirements of customers. The firm hold very large and comprehensive stocks in tea and coffee, em- bracing all the very finest growths and output of the world's most famous plantations. In addition to selling their teas in the original packages as imported direct from the gardens in India, China, Ceylon, and Japan, Messrs. Dakin & Co. have brought to perfection several delicious blends, the process of blending being accomplished with the assistance of improved and effective machinery. The knowledge of how properly, judiciously, and with good result to blend certain teas is not a secret acquired in an hour, nor in a day, a month, or a year. The blender of teas, whose operations are to culminate in a harmonious and pleasing effect, must be a man of long and varied experienced in every branch of the business \u2014 quite as much so, in fact, as the actual buyer of the teas at the plantations or elsewhere ; and of such reliable stamp are both buyers and blenders in Messrs. Dakin's establishment, a fact to which must be accorded no small meed of credit for the renown and popularity achieved and attained by the teas of this firm. And as to coffee, that much mal- treated and indispensable factor in the sum total of our everyday com- forts \u2014 a greater celebrity, if that be possible, attaches to the name of the house in this respect. Messrs. Dakin Se Co. control and operate a patent process for roasting coffee in silver cylinders, a method which has been pronounced by many competent judges to be the best mode known of pre- paring the raw berry for grinding and consumption. Everyone who makes it a point to have the best coffee procurable must be to some extent familiar with the fragrant decoction resulting from this process of Messrs. Dakin's. Coffee thus prepared has become popular from one end of the country to the other, and Dakin's Patent Coffee is a household word now in English domestic circles, while the demand for this admirably prepared commodity is annually increasing in a manner commensurate with its purity and excellence. The firm have b\u00aben very successful in obtaining eminent exhibition honours for their valuable apparatus and method, including many prizes and medals of noteworthy degree. The machinery utilised under this patent system for roasting coffee can be seen in operation at No. 77, Carter Lane, E.C. One word more, and that will apply to the prices asked by Messrs. Dakin & Co. It must first of all be remembered and noted as a patent fact that it is extremely hard to fully reconcile excessive cheapness with any degree of superiority or high excellence in the goods offered \u2014 just as hard as it is to reconcile excessive expensiveness with the reasonable purse-capacity of a purchaser economically inclined ; and when these points have been carefully con- sidered, and Messrs. Dakin's prices inspected, it will be readily seen that they have established themselves in the happy medium between these two extremes. Their goods are not cheap, but they are exclusively superior and reliable ; neither are they dear, for strict moderation in price has been made a rule in so far as it can be deemed compatible with the undoubted excellence and high-class quality of every article held in stock. The con nections of the house are widespread, valuable, and of long-founded in fluence ; the business is conducted with the most commendable energy by its enterprising and deservedly successful proprietor ; and a trade is con trolled whose operations extend to all parts of the metropolis and through out the entire United Kingdom. which, for Great Britain and Ireland, are in Cheapside, E.C. This widely- known and highly-reputed institution was founded in 1845, and is conducted under the official supervision of the Insurance Department of the Government of the State of New York, whose minute investigation into every insurance operation within the limits of its jurisdiction consti tutes a splendid safeguard to the assuring classes. The reports of the company are also deposited annually- with the Board of Trade in Great Britain, in accordance with the Life Assurance Companies Act, 1870; and over 70,00u/. sterling (#350,000) has been also deposited in United States Bonds, with the distinguished trustees of the company for Great Britain and Ireland, as additional security for the representatives of deceased policy-holders. The three following figures will amply demon strate the undoubted stability of this great insurance organisation. At the close of the company's financial year ending December 31st, 1887, the accumulated funds amounted to the enormous total of 16,976,616/.; while the surplus over liabilities by the new State standard of valuation (4 per actuaries') was 2,437,611/., and the income for the year at 4,442,560/. Nothing could well! be more satisfactory than this pros perous state of affairs, and nothing could better prove the admirable system under which the company's transactions are managed and regu lated. The accumulated funds of the company are advantageously and securely invested ; the company is mutual in character, and no liability is incurred by its policy-holders ; there are no shareholders, all profits belong to policy-holders, and apportionments in this respect are made annually. These are points in the company's regulations which are worthy of con sideration, embodying as they do the most beneficial features that can appertain to any plan of modern life insurance, which, it is to be noted, is the only branch of assurance engaged in by the \" New York Life.\" It would be beyond the province of this necessarily brief sketch to enter closely into the company's chief features of assurance business, which are, also, too well and extensively known in a general way to require any such discussion. A few words may, however, be worthily devoted to a brief description of the New York Life Co's. newest departure in system, which stands forth as, undoubtedly, the latest advance in life insurance. This novel plan is termed, \"The Non-Forfeiting Tontine Limited Endowment Plan,\" under which are embodied in a single policy all the most notable and valuable features which the ingenuity of expert actuaries in life insurance has yet brought to light. This most noteworthy scheme em braces no fewer than seven distinct advantages, which are, briefly, as follows: \u2014 Insurance for a definite amount, or for an amount increasing with each premium paid, as desired ; a definite cash endowment, and a tontine dividend, to policies in force at the end of endowment and tontine periods, corresponding either to ten, fifteen, or twenty years ; insurance for the full amount of the policy, extended for as long a time as the value of the policy will carry it, within the endowment period, in case of dis continuance of payment of premiums after three years ; a grace of one month in the payment of premiums (subject to a fine), during which time the policy-holder's security is unimpaired ; three valuable options, including cash value to policy-holders who survive their tontine and endowment periods and keep their policies in force ; practical freedom of action, with respect to occupation, residence, and travel, after two years ; aud the payment of death claims immediately upon the company's approval of the required proofs of death. These seven remarkable points call for no comment here. They carry, primi facie, evidences of their own merits and benefits, and they are in every respect worthy alike of the attention of the assuring classes everywhere, and of the characteristic enterprise of the great institution by which they have been formulated. As an insurance office |of the very first class the New York Life Co. stands second to none on either side of the Atlantic, either in point of the eminent repute it has always sustained, the influential character of its governing body, or the unsurpassed protection it offers to its clients and their repre sentatives in indisputable guarantees of its ability to more than meet all its obligations. The company's immense building at Nos. 346 and 348, Broadway, New York, containing the head offices of the institution, is one of the finest commercial structures in the Empire City, and affords in yet another form a proof of the enterprise that has placed this representative organisation in the front rank of its contemporaries all over the world. The London offices in Cheapside are also spacious, commodious, and handsomely appointed ; and here is engaged a numerous and highly efficient staff, operating under the capable and experienced supervision of Mr. J. Fisher Smith, the company's general manager for the department of Great Britain and Ireland. There are also influential committees of reference for Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and all England ; and branch offices under able control are well and prosperously established in Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, and Belfast. The growth ofthe company's business has ever been most remarkable, and in the last ten years the accumulated funds have been raised from 7,558,016/. to 16,976,616/., while the total annual income has increased during the same period from 1,573,639/. to 4,442,560/. The clientele of the New York Life Insurance Co. is now enormous in number and practically universal in residence ; and its honourable record of more than forty years in the insurance world, coupled with the integrity of its administration, its great w-ealth, and the liberality of its dealings, has endowed this eminent institution with a British popularity and public favour of the highest and most gratifying order. The New York Life Insurance Co., 76 and 77, Cheapside, JE c \u2014Prominent among the most distinguished of t*_ose great American associations to whose enterprise and fertility of resource life assurance owes in a lar\u00b0*e measure its present well-deserved popularity and purity of principle stands the New York Life Insurance Co., the chief offices of"], [120, "136 MODEEN LONDON. great stores of grain were laid up here by Roger Ashley, the Mayor, to meet the great scarcity- of wheat in the City at that time ; and in 1516 the Market was the scene of a serious riot and disturbance, when the apprentices attacked the foreign merchants selling wares therein. In 1534-35 strenuous but futile efforts were made to have Leadenhall transformed into a bourse for the assembly of merchants ; and iu 1546, when the corpse of Eing Henry VIII. laid in state at Westminster, the Market is to be remembered as the seene of the magnificent and creditable charity of the Bishop of Worcester to the poor of the City. Even as early as 1734 the importance of Leadenhall as a Market is something to reflect upon, for official statistics show that in that year as many as 34,000 geese were sold there immediately prior to Michaelmas Day. It is worthy of note that Leadenhall Market escaped the Great Fire of 1666, which was hardly anywhere more disastrously destructive than iu its immediate vicinity. Leadenhall Market, as it has been best known in modern days, was built in 1730, and from that date for nearly a century and a half enjoyed much prosperity, its success and great popularity being influenced by its singularly convenient position, and also by the exhaustive variety of the provisions and live stock exposed for sale within its limits by successive generations of enterprising purveyors. It fell upon days some short time ago, however, which threatened for awhile to be exceedingly unpromising in their outcome, for the \" powers that be \" in the City resolved upon no less sweeping a measure than the complete abolition of the Market. Fortunately- for the place and for its commercial interests, some of the tenants of the Market at that trying time recognised that they possessed certain vested rights in the threatened establishment, whereupon Mr. James Godwin, assisted by Mr. Dowling and others, very properly and most manfully- undertook the maintenance of those rights to the uttermost of their ability. That ability proved fully equal to tbe occasion ; the City Council abandoned the projected abolition, and not only the retention of the Market was secured, but its improvement was at once undertaken. From the designs of Sir Horace Jones, and to a considerable extent in the light, airy, and attractive, yet strong and massive, style of architecture so successfully employed by Sir Joseph Paxton in the erection of the Great Exhibition Building of 1851 (now the Crystal Palace), the new Leadenhall Market was constructed and completed. In its present form, it needs no introduction to readers of this review, and few, if any, will gainsay the statement that it stands now among the most commodious and well-arranged of all structures within the metropolitan area devoted to a similar purpose. The new Market Leadenhall Market. \u2014 If there is any locality in Modern London that offers a broad and interesting field for the labour of the reviewer \u2014 a field far too broad, in fact, to be adequately covered by the present brief and superficial sketch \u2014 that locality is certainly old and historic Leadenhall. There are few quarters of London that should be regarded by metropolitan residents with more kindly- sentiments, for Leadenhall not only suggests pleasing reminiscences of the past \u2014 between which and the present day it is a notable connecting link \u2014 but it holds a position that brings, or should bring, it still more within the scope of average man's affections. For quite as lengthy a period as most people care to mentally gaze back over, Leadenhall has occupied a post of unexcelled prominence as a purveyor of certain very necessary classes of comestibles, and of certain almost equally desirable classes of live stock, to many a thousand dwellers within and around the limits of Cockaigne; and it is upon the score of its services as a source of supply for meat and for game, for geese and turkeys, and fine fat pullets, for live rabbits and fowls, various dogs, rare of breed or useful of character, and even for the harmless, necessary cat, much in demand in shipping circles to wage exterminating war against the rats that swarm in every vessel entering or sailing from the port of London, that Leadenhall puts forth its strongest claim to the regard of the great metropolis and its teeming population. Mighty changes have been wrought in the topographical features of the capital and its environs since the early days of the fourteenth century, and it would be decidedly interesting to know what impressions the present sine structure of Leadenhall Market would produce upon the worthy citizens of that remote period \u2014 citizens who knew Leadenhall in those distant days (1309) as a manor house apper taining to Sir Hugh Nevill, by whose widow it was, in 1 362, enfeoffed to Eichard, Earl of Arundel. The place then passed through a succession of ownerships until, in 1408, it came into the possession of Eichard Whittington, of traditional renown. He, in 1411, disposed of it to the Mayor and Commonalty of the City of London ; and in 1443, under authority of licence procured by the Mayor (John Hatherlv) from the Eing (Henry VI.), Leadenhall Market was eventually established. From that day down to the present time, its history has been eventful and interesting in a degree not usually associated with places devoted to the exhibition and sale of marketable commodities. Simon Eyre, a noted Citizen and Draper (circa 1444), wrought many improvements in the Market, and founded on its eastern side a chapel, a portion of the walls of which was brought to light whilst alterations were recently being made in the basement of the premises of Messrs. Dowling & Son, well-known tenants of the Market to-day. Leadenhall was also used as a store for warlike munitions for the City ; and in 1503 we find prominent reference to it as a Market in a petition made to the Mayor to prevent foreigners from offering their wares for sale at any other spot in the City. Iu 1512 was completed in 1881, and was opened by Sir Whittaker Ellis, then Lord Mayor. It is interesting to record that Messrs. Dowlin-r, previously mentioned in this sketch, effected the first sale in the new buildin\", that sale taking the form of a whole pig, ordered by Sir Whittaker Ellis to be sent to the Mansion House. At this point it will be but simple justice to"], [121, "MODEEN LONDON. 137 make brief mention of those firms, the influence and efforts of whose well-known principals were largely instrumental in preserving Leadenhall Market from the abolition which threatened it ; and among these cham pions of the famous Market, there are no more prominent names than those of Mr. James Godwin, probably the oldest-established butcher, in Half-Moon Passage ; Mr. Benjamin Hotine, noted as one of the Market's foremost dealers in fish and game ; Mr. John Frank, in poultry ; and Messrs. Dowling & Son, famous as vendors of pork, pork pies, sausages, and other edibles of porcine origin; while the foreign meat trade is represented by the firm of John S. Fitter & Sons. These eminent firms not only did valiant and excellent service in securing the retention of Leadenhall Market in the public interest, but they also contribute largely to the maintenance of its old-time traditions of notoriety \u2014 the credit and renown of the place as one of the first of London markets. There are certainly few visitors to the famous locality of Leadenhall who have not paused in honest admiration before the several premises of these well reputed dealers, and east wistful glances upon their tempting stocks, so full of gastronomic suggestion and inspiration ; or actuated, haply, by more practical and provident motives, seized the opportunity to make timely, judicious, and profitable investment in a prime joint at Godwin's, a delicious pork pie or pasty at Dowling's, a fish or a pheasant at Hotine's, or a fowl, for which Mr. Frank has established a reputation. Many a page might easily and pleasantly be filled in recounting a tithe of the features of interest that characterize the Leadenhall Market of to-day, and suggest comparisons with like features in the past ; but the limits of our review are already exhausted in detailing the foregoing few, brief, but authentic facts. \" Old Leadenhall \" has lost none of its interest, and above all has parted with none of the esteem and favour of those citizens to whom it is easy and convenient of access ; and the enter prise, energy, and creditable business principles of its tenants amply suffice to still constitute it one of the most prosperous, well-patronised, and popular of London markets. Our readers, in the text immediately following this historical sketch of the leading provision emporium of the metropolis, will find an accurate and concise account of the foundation, progress, and actual status of some firms located therein which are in all respects thoroughly representative of an important section of the great victualling trade of the capital. Mr. Walter Davis. The premises occupied in Gracechurch Street (the same site having always been associated with the career of the house) are spacious and commodious, comprising a roomy shop of excellent appointment, well situated, and possessing a capital frontage to the above named busy thoroughfare. The cellars in which the cheese is stored are very striking specimens of ancient architecture ; the walls are several feet thick, and archways lead from one chamber to another. This part of the premises was built many hundred years ago. The whole concern is kept in excellent order, and will well repay inspection. Here are held very large and superior stocks, embracing articles of the best obtainable character in butter, eggs, cheese, bacon, and family provisions generally, all goods being kept in prime condition, fresh supplies constantly received from the most noted sources, and every item in the stock of the first quality and utmost reliability exclusively. In this way do Messrs. Boote & Davis uphold the old-time traditions of their house, and sustain a reputation founded long ago for the excellence of all their high-class goods. The business is conducted with ability and energy in all its branches, and a large and competent staff is employed. Every arrange ment is complete for the reception and service of customers at the shop, where good order and neatness prevail, and the entire establishment ranks among the best managed and most attractive of its kind in the City. The trade controlled is wholly of a family character, with very widespread, valuable, and long-founded connections ; and the extensive business thus carried on calls into requisition the services of vans, which arc in con stant use, travelling a metropolitan round of twelve to fourteen miles, calling for the orders of the firm's far-reaching circle of patronage, and delivering large quantities of goods over the same circuit every day. Dowling & Son, Wholesale Provision Merchants, Leadenhall Market, E.C. \u2014 Every one frequenting \" Leadenhall Market,\" whether in the capacity of buyers or merely as visitors, cannot fail to note the conspicuous and handsomely-fitted shop of \" Messrs. Dowling Se Son,\" wholesale provision merchants. This is one of the oldest-established and most renowned shops of the market, and certainly does one ofthe largest trades. It was one of the most prominent sales men's establishments in the time of the old market, but has materially improved, both in appearance and the greater extent of accommodation afforded it, since the reconstruction of Leadenhall Market by the Corpora tion of London a few years ago. The firm are noted for the sale of the finest dairy-fed pork sent to London, but their leading speciality is \" Dowling's \" Celebrated Pork Sausages, an article they have an excellent reputation for, and which it is only a truism to say this firm trade more largely in than any other maker in London. Dowling's pork sausages are bought and eaten by the thousand in the city alone every day; they are as well known, and form as much a necessary adjunct to the counter of the luncheon bars and taverns of the city, as a first-rate glass of bitter or stout. They form the substantial mid-day \" snack \" of the busy clerk or toiling warehouse employe, and are decidedly wholesome, toothsome, genuine, and cheap. It would be a matter of considerable difficulty to find their equal as a light and nutritious article of food. The firm also do largely* in fine peat smoked hams and York hams, but for best dairy-fed country pork no similar establishment in London can compete with them. Tbe trade operations are on a most extensive scale, many hundreds of tons of high-class provisions passing through their hands annually, their name being familiar to every tavern and restaurant keeper of note throughout the metropolis, in addition to which there is a large family and whole sale trade. The premises occupied are large and commodious, fitted re gardless of cost, and afford employment to a considerable staff. The principal of the partnership, Mr. J. L. Dowling, is a gentleman of high repute in the City, of weil-known strict integrity, and very widely respected as an old citizen. James Godwin & Co., Meat Salesmen and Contractors, 16 and 17, Grand Avenue, Leadenhall Market, E.C. \u2014 The supply and distribution of the vast quantities of animal food required for the daily consumption of the enormous population of the metropolis form a subject of deep interest to many of our most eminent social economists and reformers, but as our business is at present connected with those estab- lishments engaged in the sale of meat, our attention is specially directed to the old-established and well-known firm of Messrs. James Godwin Se Co., meat salesmen and contractors, of the above address. Eeverting, in the first place, to the early history of this firm and their predecessors, we find that the business was established in the year 1818, and is re- cognised as one of the oldest engaged solely in the sale of English and Scotch meat in the metropolis. Messrs. Godwin & Co. carry on their busi- ness in one of the largest and best-appointed shops in the Leadenhall Market, with spacious cold air chambers underneath for the preservation of the meat in hot weather, and every convenience for carrying on their extensive trade to the best advantage. This firm has a first-class connection amongst the best clubs, hotels, restaurants, taverns, &c, and contract largely with the principal steamship companies for their supply of fresh meat, and a large trade is also done amongst private families. With respect to such an old-established and highly connected firm as Messrs. Godwin Se Co., any special commendation or praise is unnecessary, and would be superfluous ; it may be said, however, that the business is con- ducted with characteristic energy and enterprise, and is thoroughly repre- sentative of this branch of trade. It may not be generally known that it was owing to the exertions of Mr. Godwin and two or three other gentlemen that the present historic site of Leadenhall Market was secured as a free market for ever for the people, and the present noble structure erected thereon. In accomplishing this Mr. Godwin and his co-workers did a public service in affording increased facilities for the food supply of the metropolis and the intercourse of buyer and seller. Great credit is due to those concerned for having succeeded in thus preserving one ofthe most notable of the landmarks of ancient London. Messrs. Godwin & Co. are well known for their sound judgment and skill in recognising the quality of meat, and exercise that care and attention in this matter which has gained them such a high reputation and the continued support and patronage of a high-class and valuable connection. Benjamin Hotine & Co., Fishmongers, Poulterers, and Game Sealers, Leadenhall Market, E.C. \u2014 A notable house in the fish, game, and poultry trade is that conducted by Messrs. Benjamin Hotine & Co., which has been established over half a century, and is con- sequently a leading firm in this section of the English provision trade, while the quality of its productions places it in a position of great distinction. The depot is situated in a central position in the market, commodiously arranged, and well fixtured for all trade purposes. The firm at all seasons make an attractive display, which always commands public attention, their consignments of fish and poultry being from the best and most famous sources of supply in the kingdom, and especially large are their consignments of game from the most highly-valued covers in the country. The business is well organised and carried on with great tactand skill, a large staff of assistants being employed, and the emporium usually presenting a scene of sound business activity, especially during the time allotted for the despatch of suburban and city orders. Tbe trade done is very extensive, being particularly well established among the leading families in all parts of London, while the circle of large consumers comprises the principal hotels and restaurants of the metropolis. The members of the firm are well known as gentlemen of the highest business integrity and as practical tradesmen conversant with every branch of their business, being held in great respect by their customers for their courtesy to them on all occasions Boote & Davis, Family Cheesemongers and Provision Merchants, 77, Gracechurch Street. E.C. \u2014 One of the oldest and most prominent among representative City houses in its line is that of Messrs. Boote & Davis, the well-known family cheesemongers and provision merchants. This firm was established before the Great Fire of London. Upwards of one hundred years ago it was in the possession of Messrs.

This prominent hou-e was founded upwards of sixty-five years ago, and occu pies extensive premises, handsomely and conveniently fitted up, and situate in a good central position in the market. Here are always to be found large and comprehensive stocks of game in the various seasons, and of poultry of every description, all of superior quality and in prime condition. John Frank enjoys an enviable reputation in this latter respect, being widely known as a purveyor of only the best classes of goods in his important line, and to this well-established good name is attributable the high confidence in which his house is held by its many customers in all parts of town and country. The firm's trade is entirely wholesale in character, and is of exceptionally extensive range and volume, its operations extending widely among the retail dealers in game and poultry throughout the kingdom generally. During the summer months an additional feature is included in the business done, for then Mr. John Frank carries on a large trade with retail poulterers at the principal seaside resorts, who depend upon this market to a great extent for their necessary supplies. The business of the house in all its departments is conducted with conspicuous ability and judgment, and the firm's valuable and desirable trade connections become more widespread and influential every year in all quarters of the metropolis and provinces. John S. Fitter Ss Son, English, Colonial, and Foreign Meat Salesmen, 8 and 9, Grand Avenue, Leadenhall Market, E.C. \u2014 For upwards of thirty years the firm of Messrs. John S. Fitter & Son, the well-known English, foreign, and colonial meat salesmen, has been one of the most prominent business houses connected with Leadenhall Market. This eminent house has also for the period men tioned been continuously under the sole control of its present proprietor, and holds now, as in the past, a post of much note and distinction as the largest and most important retail meat purveying establishment in the trade. The premises occupied in the Leadenhall Market comprise a spacious and exceptionally handsome shop and depot, very advantage ously situated at 8 and 9, in the Grand Avenue, just where that principal thoroughfare is intersected by another main artery of the market. The corner site thus constituted affords to Messrs. John S. Fitter & Son most admirable facilities of shop frontage, and gives them opportunities for display which are never neglected. The shop always stands among the most attractive in the market, and a particularly choice and well-assorted stock of prime English beef, mutton, pork, and veal, best American beef, calves' heads, feet and sweetbreads, ox tails, tongues, and kidneys is constantly held in readiness to meet the extensive demands of a most important and flourishing trade. The firm is a thoroughly representative one, engaging very largely in every leading branch of meat supply, and conducting a high-class and exceedingly prosperous business. Messrs. John S. Fitter & Son were the first to introduce to the notice of private customers those excellent classes of frozen meats from colonial sources of supply which are now such an important factor in the British meat trade ; and to their earnest efforts in behalf of this kind of flesh food (for which they were, together with Mr. W. S. Fitter, the earliest appointed agents in England) must be largely attributed the complete overcoming of the unreasoning prejudice which at first existed against frozen meats. It is now little more than five years ago since this energetic and enterprising firm commenced their retail operations in frozen meat from the Australian Colouies \u2014 New Zealand in particular \u2014 and in that short space of time the splendid character and quality of the prime goods they offered to the public, at a price bringing them within the reach of every section of the community, have commanded public admiration and support, over-ruled every shortsighted objection that never had any ground for existence, and created a demand for frozen meat that is growing with remarkable rapidity year by year. The chief source from which the firm now draw their supplies in this line is New Zealand, where the mutton is all grass-fed, and strongly resembles the best products of the Welsh and Southdown districts, and the trade they have built up in this one respect is now of immense proportions and extent. In the basement of Messrs. Fitter & Son's premises in the Grand Avenue are extensive vaults, specially constructed and fitted up as cold-air stores. Here is an excellent system of cold dry-air rooms, supplied atmospherically by one of Lightfoot's patent cold dry-air refrigerating machines, operated by a gas engine. In these chambers the firm are enabled to store their frozen meat as it is received from the Colonies, and keep it in its original fresh and wholesome state. Such is the excellent character of these refrigerating rooms, that it is quite possible to maintain the meat in a condition of perfect sweetness, soundness, and purity for several weeks. Messrs. John S. Fitter & Son contract at special rates for the supplying of families, schools, shipping, and taverns, and all large consumers, and have an excellent system of delivery by their own vans, operating daily throughout the West-end. The firm enjoy a most eminent reputation among a widespread and valuable circle of con- nections in all parts of town and country ; and their well-ordered and attractive establishment, where every item of goods sold is of first quality and reliability, is in constant receipt of liberal support at the hands of an influential and desirable class of metropolitan and provincial custom. centrated beef tea, &c, those known as the \" Lion \" brand have for a long time taken a pre-eminent position. These were introduced to the public about six years ago. Extensive premises are occupied. A large staff is engaged in the manufacture of various descriptions of concentrated meat. The firm have speedily gained a first-class reputation for the very superior quality of all their preparations, which are manufactured from the finest descriptions of British meat. Among the specialities may be men tioned a concentrated form of turtle soup, which has a very extensive sale, aud stock for various other soups. Many of the preparations are specially adapted for the use of invalids, such as essence of beef, mutton, chicken, &c, beef tea jelly, aud various others, which are now being all put up in glass instead of tin. The firm is noted in connection with the manufacture of very superior sauces and relishes, in which it excels, and produces an unsurpassed quality. A very extensive trade is carried on, both home and export, goods being sent all over the world. The business is very ably managed, and conducted with considerable energy. ln comparatively a few years an extensive connection has been gained, and a large and important trade developed, the firm now taking a leading position in this branch of busiuess, especially being the pioneers in introducing these delicacies in glass. W. Moorhead & Co., Linen Merchants, 5, Oat Lane, Wood Street, E.C. \u2014 There are few branches of the textile trade of this country which equal in value or extent that devoted to the manufacture and sale of linen. In reviewing this important branch of industry in the pages of \" Modern London,\" one of the representative houses that may be chosen for comment is W. Moorhead Se Co. Mr. Moorhead, the senior partner, has been engaged in the linen trade in the metropolis since the year 1862, so that it has been in existence over a quarter of a ceutury, and during all that time has held its place in the front rank of its many com petitors. The stocks of every description of linen are large, and so varied that no one, how fastidious soever his or her taste may be, need leave the pre mises without having their requiremeuts satisfied. Cambric and linen hand kerchiefs are held in great variety, and, together with the linen, are sold in large quantities to the leading wholesale and shipping houses to which Messrs. Moorhead & Co. confine their operations. The connection is widespread, and is continually being added to by energetic travellers. The business is admirably managed, and, taken all round, the firm is one of the best known and very popular in the linen trade of the metropolis."], [123, "MODERN LONDON. 139 Dehenham & Freebody, Warehousemen and Im porters, Costumiers, and Outfitters, Wigmore Street and Welbeck Street, W. \u2014 It is safe to say that there exists no British firm of modern times whose name is more creditably familiir to the ears of metro politan residents generally and of dwellers in the West End in particular, than is that of Messrs. Debenham and Freebody, Wholesale and Retail Silk Mercers, Haberdashers, Costumiers and Outfitters. This widely-re nowned and distinguished house was founded aboutone hundred years ago, under the style of Flint and Clark, and controls to-day one of the largest and most attractive depots for the sale of those linos of goods in which it so extensively operates that can be found within the limits of the metropolis. The premises occupied by Messrs. Debenham and Freebody comprise a magnificent block of buildings bounded by Wigmore Street, Welbeck Street, and Mill Hill Place. These premises were rebuilt some four years ago and now possess a frontage upon Wigmore Street of about 130 feet, a rearward depth of 100 feet, and contains five complete floors and two spacious basements. The counting-house department is most perfect in every feature of its appointment ; twenty desks afford accommodation for a clerical staff to the number of eighty ; admirably equipped order rooms and post-order rooms adjoin the counting-house, replete with every convenience, and the fitting-up of the various private offices has been carried out upon a scale of much tasteful elegance. The whole of the building is heated by hot water, generated hy four furnaces in the lower basement, and is lighted throughout by gas and electric light. The system adopted for protection from fire is most perfect in all its details. There is an organized fire brigade for this purpose, all the members of which sleep on the premises ; and constant fire drill is engaged in, with wet drill once in three months. Commercially con sidered, the establishment of Messrs. Debenham and Freebody is divided into twenty departments, among which are to be found those devoted respectively to silks, costumes, mantles, ball dresses, mourning, boys' tailoring, ribbons, hosiery, haberdashery, fancy goods, juvenile goods, lace, flowers, millinery, Oriental goods, &c, &c. Each of these sections is under the most competent managerial supervision, is served by an efficient staff of trained assistants, and is possessed of every improved equipment for the perfect convenience and comfort of patrons. As ware housemen and importers, Messrs. Debenham and Freebody conduct opera tions upon a scale of great magnitude, and hold enormous stocks in each of the many lines to which their depot is devoted. The firm find the pages of a bulky and admirably arranged price-list none too voluminous for the specification of merely a choice selection from among the vast col lection of high-class ware3 with whose sale their name has so long been associated ; and it can, therefore, hardly be supposed that within the necessarily circumscribed limits of this review any adequate idea could be given of the exhaustive comprehensiveness of the several stocks exhibited in their well-ordered show-rooms. If a selection can be made without seeming invidiousness, the most attractive of all the departments con trolled by the house is that set apart for ladies' costumes, and embracing the sections for ball, evening, dinner and court dresses, morning and tea gowns, promenade and visiting costumes, and riding habits. This depart ment, with its superb stock, which has been subjected to a system of most perfect arrangement and classification, furnishes an amply demonstrative instance ofthe wide range and scope ofthe firm's business operations, and may be set down as fully indicative and representative, as regards com pleteness in every detail, of the establishment in its entirety. Features of most signal excellence in quality of material, design, and workmanship characterize every item in the display made by this department, and give perfect exemplification of every branch of the costumier's art as applied to the production of ladies' fashionable apparel. And were all the other sections of the depot here reviewed, words of precisely similar commen dation would be applicable. It is, however, particularly worthy of note that Messrs. Debenham and Freebody have developed a valuable and important series of specialities in Japanese cabinets, bamboo and Turkish coffee tables, brackets, Oriental porcelain, and various classes of art furniture of singular attractiveness ; and in this connection must be mentioned the Flora stove decoration (registered). This is a genuine novelty in screens, made of plaited green rushes, and decorated in drapery of plush or silk, tied with bows of ribbon. The effect thus produced is charmingly artistic, and a more unique or thoroughly tasteful stove screen could hardly be imngined. Messrs. Dehenham and Freebody's haberdashery' cabinets, their superb lace stock, their dainty lines of parasols, and their attractive novelties in fans, and lamp and candle shades, are all well worthy of enumeration ; but the limits of space forbid that descriptive attention to which each division of their splendid stock is so justly entitled. Messrs. Debenham and Freebody's establishment affords employment to no less than six hundred and eighty hands, viz., four hundred and sixty assistants and two hundred and twenty work people. Every one of the assistants is provided with meals on the premises, thus necessitating the further employment of a large force of cooks and servants ; and to this total must again be added six country and nine town travellers, who promote the interests of their house among the trade. The business is conducted upon the most perfect principles of commercial accuracy, this being especially the cuse in the post-order department. One large room is devoted to the filing of old post-orders, which are kept for a period of five years, and any given one of which can be referred to at a minute's notice. An idea of the magnitude of this department of the firm's business may be gleaned from the fact that duiing 1886 upwards of two hundred thousand letters were received by post ; and the precision which characterizes the conduct of the department is indi cated in the additional fact that not one letter in a hundred thousand goes astray after its delivery at the depot. The trading operations of Messrs. Debenham and Freebody, both wholesale and retail in character, are of enormous extent ; and their commercial connections take widespread effect in every quarter of the globe. Their famous establishment enjoys the patronage of the most distinguished home circles ; and an honourable record dating back well into the last century, joined to high repute for thorough and conscientious catering to the requirements of its thousands of customers of to-day, has sufficed to establish their famous house in a post of most eminent distinction among the first fashionable emporia of the land. Squire & Sons, Chemists and Druggists to the Queen, Oxford Street, corner of Duke Street, W. \u2014 The business now con ducted by Messrs. Squire and Sons, Chemists and Druggists to the Queen, was established as long ago as 1791, and the present firm, one of the most eminent of English houses in its line, was founded in 1831 by the late Mr. Peter Squire. This gentleman was president for three years of the Pharmaceutical Society, and was the author of the celebrated work entitled \" Squire's Companion to the British Pharmacop\u0153ia,\" now (1886) in its fourteenth edition, and of which edition the sale already exceeds eight thousand copies. The firm subsequently became P. and P. W. Squire, and is now known as Squire and Sons. The premises occupied were rebuilt and greatly extended in 1871-2, and now present a most stately and attractive appearance. The frontage afforded by the desirable corner site occupied is very fine, and, in addition to the handsomely ap pointed shop, the establishment controls three upper floors, all utilised for the purposes of the busiuess, and a spacious basement, three times the size of the shop, which is devoted to the uses of laboratory, and manufactory for special preparations. A fine stock is held, and every item in the long list of drugs and chemicals handled by the firm is subjected to careful test and analysis before being relegated to the stock shelves. Messrs. Squire and Sons do the largest dispensing business in London, there being in their establishment a staff of ten assistants busily engaged entirely in this one department. The total force employed numbers about thirty-five hands. Perhaps the two most prominent specialities of the stock held by this house are \"Squire's Chemical Food,\" a preparation of widespread renown, and their well-known feature in \" Medicine Chests.\" These latter are supplied to patrons both at home and abroad, and are constructed with a patent spring, which is so contrived that the stoppers of the bottles do not require to be capped. The ever-increasing demand for these chests is based upon many high qualities of excellence which merit the most unequivocal recognition. Messrs. Squire and Sous are Chemists and Druggists to the Queen, and obtained their several Royal Warrants of Appointment at the following dates : to the Duchess of Kent and Princess Victoria, October 28th, 1836 ; to her Majesty the Queen, August 8th, 1837; to Prince Consort, August 7th, 1840. and to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, July 24th, 1863. In addition to these they hold several other appointments, and supply almost every member of the Royal Family, and many of the Royal Courts. The home patronage enjoyed is of the most distinguished order, and a wholesale and export trade is conducted whose opei ations take effect in every quarter of the world. The partners are Mr. Peter Wyatt Squire and Mr. Alfred Herbert Squire, and these gentlemen conduct their extensive business upon those strictly first-class lines which have ever formed the com mercial groundwork of a house whose long career has been one of the greatest distinction in the annals of the British Pharmaceutical trade. The telephone number of the firm is 3,798. Jules Duvelleroy, Fan Manufacturer, 167, Eegent Street, W. \u2014 One of the most eminent West End houses in its line is that of M. Jules Duvelleroy, manufacturer of fans, established under the present title in 1847. The premises occupied comprise a handsome show room with work-rooms above. A most superb stock is kept on hand, con sisting of artistic, antique, and modern fans of every conceivable description. The manufacture of fans constitutes the entire raison d'etre of M. Duvel leroy's business, and the goods he displays, all of which are produced either in his London or Paris manufactories, are of most exquisite design, beauty of finish, and quality of material and workmanship. An idea may be gleaned of the immense range of the stock exhibited when it is stated that the display includes fans varying in price from sixpence to three hundred pounds ! A department is also devoted to the repairing of fans. The home trade of this prominent house is of the highest order, its patrons being chiefly from the ranks of the aristocracy ; while its foreign connec tions are of world-wide extent. M. Duvelleroy holds the Royal Warrant of Appointment to her Majesty the Queen. He is also honoured with the patronage of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, Princess Christian, Princess Louise, Princess Beatrice, the Duchess of Edinburgh, the Duchess of Teck, Prince Albert Victor of Wales, and has, in fact, served the whole of the royal family, and also members of all the courts of Europe."], [124, "140 MODEEN LONDON. London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Company, 74, King William Street, E.C. \u2014 A prominent name in British fire insur ance circles, and one that has well earned the distinction by which it is now characterised, is that of the London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Company, occupying a handsome suite of large and well-appointed metropolitan offices at 74, King William Street, E.C. This noteworthy institution, whose head offices are situate at 11, Dale Street, Liverpool, was founded in that city in 1862, and has from the date of its inception enjoyed a career of marked and ever-progressive prosperity. Its financial position is one of assured stability, as may be gleaned from the following statement of monetary assets, founded upon the standing of the concern at the close of the business year of 1888: \u2014 the house extends throughout the City and vicinity, the bulk of the goods being taken by local manufacturers. Mr. Burton's chief aim is to satisfy his clients, and he may well expect a continuance of the prosperity which has ever attended the operations of his establishment. J. B. Bobinson, Glass, White Lead, Oil, Colour, Varnish, and Brush Merchant, 14, Moor Lane, Cripplegate, E.C. \u2014 The oil and colour industry in the metropolis is, as the population increases, yearly growing in importance. Among the well-known and rather select esta blishments in this trade a notable place is held by the house conducted by Mr. J. B. Robinson at the foregoing address. This concern was founded eleven years ago, and its career since has been one of unbroken progress. Tbe premises occupied stand on a fine corner site, and comprise base ment, ground floor, and floor above, all fitted up and arranged in the most attractive manner. The stock is very complete, but Mr. Robinson gives special attention to glass, white lead, oils, colours, varnish, and brushes. In these leading branches he holds one of the best and most serviceable stocks in the possession of any similar establishment in London. The goods are sold at moderate rates. The connection formed, though chiefly local, is of the best class, and ensures a steady and lucra tive trade. Mr. Robinson is an able and energetic tradesman, whose every transaction is marked by integrity and liberality. \u00a3 s. d.

Id.; a balance to the company's credit on the year's transactions, after deducting all commissions and expenses, and including interest on investments and other receipts, of 70,394/. 16s. 2<f., which, with the balance from 1886 of 76,412/. 16s. 6d., makes a total credit of 146,807/. 12s.

Out of this amount 30,C00/. was carried to reserve and re-insurance fund, making the same 330,000/., as above stated, and with the remainder, after payment of a dividend of 12 per cent, (free of income tax), a net balance is constituted of 94,583/. 12s. 8d., which has been carried forward to 1888. The financial soundness of the company, as represented by its large reserve, and by a commensurately large capital subscribed by a numerous and influential proprietary, affords an unques tionable guarantee of security to policy-holders ; and the outcomo of last year's operations, as given above, amply shows in what measure this security, coupled with the other good points of the institution, is appre ciated by the insuring classes in general. The company transacts fire business only, and its laudable object has at all times been the simplifica tion of routine in as far as such simplification is possible. Its policies cover English and foreign risks, are liberal in spirit and conditions, and deal with almost every description of property ; and surveys are made and rates quoted without trouble or expense to clients. Prompt settle ment of claims has ever been a distinguishing feature of this company's dealings, and its manner of constitution frees policy-holders absolutely from any incurrence of liability. Branch offices are controlled, in addition to the Liverpool head-quarters and the London establishment, at Dublin, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Manchester, and Newcastle-on-Tyne, each office being under competent resident management. A highly efficient staff of clerks and surveyors is attached to the London office, which is ably super vised by Mr. W. P. Reynolds, the London secretary ; and the general executive includes the names of Mr. C. G. Fothergill, manager and secretary to tbe company, and Mr. J. B. Moffat, sub-manager. The directorate is one of much individual and collective wealth, influence, and personal high standing ; and the whole administration of the company's affairs is characterised by the maintenance of an eminent spirit of equity and honourable integrity. The operations of the organisation are practically world-wide. Sadleir & Entrop, Agents and Commission Merchants, 15, Hamsell Street. \u2014 Only the initiated can understand how immense is the trade done, and capital sunk, in what may be called the \"incidentals\" of the clothing industry. Foremost among the goods coming under this designation are trimmings and buttons. One of the most representative and best-known concerns engaged in this department is the firm of Sadleir & Entrop, of the above address. This noted house was founded twelve years ago, and has always held a foremost place in the ranks of those carrying on the same business. The premises are spacious, and comprise warehouse and offices on the ground floor and basement. The firm make a special feature of dealing only in the best goods produced in the various branches to which they are devoted. Some of their trimmings and buttons are remarkably beautiful, and, notwithstanding their many points of superiority, they are sold at very low prices. The connection enjoyed by the house is very widespread. The business is conducted with tact and ability, and on the most honourable and liberal lines. The Highbury Machine Co., 33, Holloway Boad, N.\u2014 Amongst the many industries carried on in the metropolis, there are few occupying a position of greater usefulness than the Highbury Slachine Co. This business has been in operation for more than thirty years, and ten years ago was converted into a company under the above title. Tra dition states that the building occupied is over 300 years old. Many useful alterations have been made to adapt it to its present purpose and fit it with the best and most improved machinery and appliances. It is now one ofthe most complete establishments iu tbe north cf London, and gives constant employment to a large staff of skilled workmen. A speci ality of this firm's manufacture is the \" Highbury Washer, Wringer, and Mangle \" combined. This most useful article is very popular, and was awarded the prize medal at the International Health Exhibition. Other branches of the manufacture consist of laundry machines, sewing machines, perambulators, bassinettes, invalid and Bath chairs, milk perambulators, &c. The company hold a very large stock of harmoniums, pianos, &c. They have two branch establishments at 73, Holloway Road, and 9, Noel Park Terrace, Green Lanes, Wood Green, N.

Morris Ss Porteous, Printers, Stationers, &c, 75, Mark Lane, E.C. \u2014 The industries of the British metropolis undoubtedly cover every branch of skilled activity, and yet we doubt if there is one of greater importance or one requiring a more trained experience and ability than that comprehended under the various subdivisions of printing. One ofthe best-equipped houses in this line is that of Messrs. Morris & Porteous, of the above address. This enterprise was origi nally established in 1842 by Messrs. Shepperd & Morris. In conse quence of increasing trade, it was recently removed to its present eligible situation. The premises occupied are very spacious, and are fully pro vided with splendid presses and numbering and cutting machines of the most approved patterns, by means of which the work produced is accomplished with despatch and iu the best possible manner. A large number of skilled and experienced operatives are employed. The house carries on a general commercial letter-press and lithographic printing trade, deals extensively as wholesale and export stationers, and makes a speciality of the manufacture of account books, journals, day books, ledgers, &c, which are unsurpassed for quality and workmanship by those of any other first-class firms in the City. Throughout the establishment there pervades a system of order that facilitates the transaction of business, and makes tbe house in every respect a pleasant one with which to establish trade relations. Deane & Winfield, Wholesale and Export Cork Manu facturers, and Contractors to H.M.

Deane & Winfield, wholesale and export cork manufacturers. This business is carried on in a very extensive manufactory, admirably adapted to the requirements of the trade. A special feature of this busi ness is the cutting of cork for hat linings, helmets, and army caps, socks, and the soles of boots, &c, also beautifully-cut sheets for entomological purposes. This industry gives employment to a large number of skilled and experienced workpeople. Messrs. Deane & Winfield rank amongst the largest importers of cork in the rough state in London, and export the manufactured articles to all parts of the world. The firm occupies an excellent position in commercial circles, and the extent of their busi ness transactions entitles them to a prominent place amongst the mercantile establishments of their district. A guarantee of soundness of material and finished workmanship is afforded by the fact that the firm are contractors to H.M. War Department. John Burton, Manufacturer of Packing Cases, Ssc, Lower Whitecross Street, Cripplegate, E.C. \u2014 Few articles manufactured enter more directly into the uses of all branches of business than packing cases. A prominent house engaged in this trade is that of Mr. John Burton. This factory has now been established for upwards of fifty years, and, by reason of the high-class character of the goods produced, has always enjoyed a liberal and substantial patronage. The premises occu pied are very spacious and commodious, and comprise a substantial three-storied building, 50 by 150 feet in dimensions.

Taylor, controlling a well-known and most extensive meat, poultry, and provision business, was founded as long ago as 1816. The premises occupied are singularly spacious, com modious, and striking in appearance. They comprise a fine corner site, with a frontage of about one hundred and twenty feet, which is composed of superb glass show-windows, and supported by handsome granite pillars. No expense has been spared in fitting up and appointing the interior of tory and Construction of the Organ.\" Under the premises are fire-proof cellars, wherein are stored more than 100,000 engraved music plates of over 18,000 publications. There is also a stately pile of warehouses and stockrooms in the rear adjoining the premises, all parts of which, from base to summit, are shelved and laden with music of every description. No order is considered too insignificant for careful attention. This firm's pianofortes (of which they make several classes), in various sizes and prices to meet all requirements, are meeting with singular favour through out their extensive connection, and well maintain the reputation of the \u25a0house for supplying a thoroughly reliable and excellent instru- ment, containing all the modern advantages in construction, at a very reasonable price, and without charging for a name, as so often happens. The firm are the sole London agents for the celebrated Clarabella Organs, manufactured at Wor- cester, Mass., U.S.A. The gentlemen constituting the firm are of good status in the musical profession, and highly respected by their distinguished customers for the efficient manner in which their business is conducted. IM. Whellens, 171, 173, 177, York Eoad, Camden Road, N. \u2014 The energy and enterprise of the business men of London is nowhere more fully developed than in those establishments which combine in many departments the sale of a variety of goods. Prominent amongst these establish- ments is the well-known firm of Mr. Matthew Whellens. It is now more than twenty years since this business was first founded ; it has gradually developed from small beginnings to its present magnitude and importance. The business is carried on in large and commodious premises, well adapted to the requirements of the trade, and forming in its many departments one of the most comprehensive establishments of its kind in the metropolis. Each department is presided over by a competent manager, assisted by a staff of employees, specially trained and thoroughly au fait in every detail of their particular branch. The showrooms are very extensive, and filled with a large and well-selected stock of goods, com- prising new dress goods of both foreign and English manu- facture, cashmeres and merinos at extraordinary low prices and splendid value. In the silk department is displayed some splendid black and corded silk, as well as brocaded silks and satins, and the increasing demand for these articles indicates the return to popular favour of these useful dresses ; plushes and velveteens are also exhibited in every variety. The costume and dressmaking department is very extensive, the fit is guaranteed, and of the latest fashion, and the work of the highest class. The mantle department, both for ladies and children, contains some of the newest and most elaborate styles ; in fact, this part of the business is done so ex- ceptionally well that orders are sent from all parts of the country on account of the beautiful designs, Mr. Matthew ing in constant communication with the leading costumiers. Wedding and mourning orders are promptly and ably executed. Patterns of all kinds are forwarded by post. It would be impossible, in a review like the present, to do ample justice to each department of this extensive emporium, but suffice it to say that every requisite for personal clothing and adornment and for household and domestic use are to be found here. In addition to this establishment, a large business is done in general dress goods, millinery, underclothing, &c, &c, at 4, 9, and 10, High Road, Balham, and very fine premises, with a splendid stock of drapery of the highest class, are occupied at 21, Fitzjohn's Avenue, South Hampstead. Stationery, ornamental pottery, &c. are also dealt in on a large scale. This business is conducted with great ability, energy, and enterprise ; and the arrangements made for the comfort and welfare of those employed in the establishment reflect great credit on the proprietor. Mr. Matthew Whellens is a gentleman who has had a long and honourable connection with this business, and has gained the esteem and confidence of a very extensive and valuable connection. the roomy shop. The house holds very large and exhaustively varied stocks of fine provisions ; meat, poultry, game of all kinds in season, choice butter, cheese, bacon, fine York hams, dairy-fed pork, and home-made pork and beef sausages are a few of the many inviting specialities dis played; and the freshness, cleanliness, and perfect arrangement of each item are most commendable. Mr. Taylor's close communication with the best sources of supply in all parts of the country enables him to constantly maintain the high excellence of his stock, and thus to cater with the most satisfactory results to his numerous and influential clientele. He employs a large force of assistants, with horses, carts, &c, and conducts his business with laudable energy and attention to customers' requirements. The trade of the house is large, and possesses long- established, high class and valuable connections in all parts of town and country. Robert Cocks & Co., Music Publishers and Pianoforte Makers, 6, New Burlington Street, Begent Street, W.\u2014 The publication of music is an important branch of trade in the metropolis, and is appro- priately represented by the far-famed establishment of Messrs. Eobert Cocks & Co. This house has had the honour of being patronised by Her Majesty the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and the late Napoleon III. The warehouse is of considerable dimensions, and the fixtures are of an elaborate description, accompanied by a profuse display of music and musical instruments. The trade is of a high-class and extensive nature, employing many assistants. This is one of the oldest and best-known music publishing firms in the metropolis. The business was originally founded at No. 20, Princes Street, Hanover Square, by the late Mr. Eobert Cocks, in 1823. It was continued there for twenty-one years, and ultimately removed to the present address, formerly the mansion of the late eccentric Duchess of Cork and Orrery. The premises have a depth of 150 feet. At the entrance may be seen shelves replete with standard and classical works of solid and permanent worth issued by the firm, such as \" Czerny's School of Practical Compo- sition and the Pianoforte,\" Spohr's and Campagnot's \" Violin Schools,\" Albrechisberger's and Cherubini's \"Treatises on Counterpoint,\" \"Bertim's Method \" \" J. S. Bach's Pianoforte,\" and Hopkin's and Rimbault's \" His- St. James's Hotel, 77, Piccadilly, W\".\u2014 The St. James's Hotel was established about seventy years ago, and was known as the Gloucester Coffee House, and was rebuilt about 1862. The building is six stories high, and so extensive that it is capable of accommodating thirty separate families. It has been recently redecorated throughout and refurnished in high-class modern style, and is one of the best hotels in the neighbour hood. No less than fifty attendants are engaged, and the management is in the hands of Mr. C. Diette, late of the Bristol Hotel, a gentleman well known in hotel circles in this country. The hotel possesses many special advantages, not the least of which is the fact of commanding a fine view of the Green Park and Buckingham Palace. Telephonic communication has been fitted up, with the additional benefit of the electric light through out, and an American lift. The hotel has long been celebrated for its French cuisine, and also for the excellent quality of the wines, &c. supplied. The management is carried on with conspicuous ability and energy. These considerations, added to its splendid appearance and situation, have made it one ofthe favourite hotels ofthe West-end."], [126, "142 MODEEN LONDON. Laycock's Dairy Farm (Frederick Dodson, Manager), 294, Liverpool Road, Islington, N. \u2014 There is no branch of trade in the metropolis that has attained a higher degree of popularity than the dairy business. An old-established and highly-reputable house in this line is that carried on under the style of Laycock's Dairy Farm, whose spacious premises occupy a commanding position. This business was established so far back as 1720 by Mr. Richard Laycock, whose name it still bears, and was continued by him until his decease, which occurred in 1797, brought his connection with it to a termination. This business claims not only to be the oldest house of its kind in the district, but is admitted to be a special feature of North London antiquity. The busi ness is now carried on by a firm styling themselves Laycock & Co., under the management of Mr. Frederick Dodson, and it is only fair to say that no effort is spared that is calculated to maintain the reputation handed down to them by their predecessors, and doing justice to the traditions of a name that is so well known in the neighbourhood. There is no firm of their kind in the metropolis that can produce a more favourable record of their operations. They have made the name of Laycock a household word in the district, and there appears no reason why they should not further develop themselves. No firm have more extensive facilities for the prosecution of their business. They have branches at Tufnell Park and Barnsbury, where they keep a large number of cows. Milk is delivered daily at these establishments from the country, and large consignments of butter are received from Bristol and other reputable centres of the butter trade. The quality of their goods is of a most superior character, having long since stood the test of the most critical analysis. A most commendable feature in the operations of the concern is the judicious selection made in the choice of a manager. No man is more intimately acquainted'with the responsible duties of his office than Mr. Dodson, and Laycock's Dairy Farm cannot fail to prosper under his direction. Improving Fish Culture. \u2014 Fish culture, carried on in accordance with scientific principles, gives promise of assuming a high importance in an economic sense. It is of great value and usefulness to the nation to introduce new fish or propagate other valuable food fishes, and to repopulate the depleted waters. The basic theory of fish cultural work is not generally comprehended. It is looked upon by many as partaking very much of visionary speculation, but it is rather the result of the cold calculation of men, who have in their composition more of sound common sense than of ornamental qualities. However, the work moves along steadily in line with the general progress, and each year records an advance. In fish culture we improve on nature. We know better how to do it than does Dame Nature herself. The number of eggs spawned by a single fish is simply astounding. We speak of millions without the slightest comprehension of its meaning. A 75 lb. codfish is estimated to yield over 9,000,000 of eggs. Thus the progeny of a single fish, if all matured, would equal the population of some very important countries. And yet, in spite of all this wonderful fecundity, without man's aid the fishes must continue to decrease, because of the enormous increase of destruction through man's own agency in their use as food, through the pollution of waters naturally attending the increase of population. I was some time ago in the aquarium of the Zoo Gardens, and there saw \"Paul's discovery to produce the natural living food for the fry.\" On examination I find the water in it actually swarmed with tiny little animals (thousands and thousands of them) hurrying to and fro ; and I hear that Mr. Paul, the pisciculturist in the Euston Eoad, has discovered how to produce these micro- scopical ani- mals by the millions, at any time, at any place, in any quantity, Coates & May, Tie and Scarf Manufacturers, 16, Australian Avenue, and 15, Jewin Crescent, E.C. \u2014 One of the largest and most important of London firms engaging in the manufacture and wholesale supply of ties and scarfs is that of Messrs. Coates & May. This representative house was founded by its present proprietary in 1872. Its business has steadily and rapidly increased, necessitating almost annual enlargement of the premises occupied. Here the designing of goods and a considerable part of the manufacturing thereof are carried on, and a numerous staff is constantly employed. Messrs. Coates & May are manufacturers of every description of gentlemen's neckwear, producing goods of first-class make exclusively, but in all qualities, as well as in every new and prevailing style. This house has, ever since the date of its establishment, been constantly to the front in the introduction of novelties, and its numerous new and decidedly meritorious designs, which each succeeding season finds upon the market, have invariably caught the popular fancy. Messrs. Coates & May employ no travellers, the excel lence, material, originality, and fine finish of their manufactures calling for no extraneous aid in securing the favour of the trade, among which they are so well and widely known. The business of the house is conducted with the ability and progressive enterprise that are characteristic of its proprietary, and in addition to a home wholesale trade of great magni tude, devoted to the supplying of wholesale and shipping houses through out London and the provinces, a very large and continuously increasii-, export business is controlled, especially to Japan, China, India, Australia! and other British colonies. The members of the firm are personally respected throughout the trade, their honourable dealings with their customers both at home and abroad having won for them widespread confidence and esteem ; and Mr. Coates, the senior partner, is a liberal donor to tbe various benevolent institutions, his name, as one of the honorary secretaries, being closely and creditably associated with the welfare and progress of the Children's Home Orphanage and Befu\"-e, an organisation which has for its laudable object the rescuing of the destitute and forsaken waifs and strays of the great metropolis. inexpensive- ly. This is a great advance iu fish culture *, now it will be possible to rear perch, burbot, and any fish, in any quantity, nearly costless, which was up to the present time not possible. Again, trout-salmon may* now be reared much quicker, as it is natural that the little fry, in only opening their mouth, must take the animalcul\u00e6 in its body, and must feed on it ; besides, the natural food will be taken more eagerly than the artificial food ; again, the natural food will and must produce a more natural, a finer quality of fish, than the substituted food, which consists chiefly of boiled liver, and of course cannot be as nourishing as the natural food, which is all digested, whereas it is estimated \u00a7 parts of the liver passes away undigested ; the consequence is that the fish will grow with their natural food three times as quick as at present, and there will be less cost and very much less labour, as by boiled liver the attendant must pay every attention and take every piece not consumed out of the feeding boxes, or it will foul and destroy, through fungus, the whole fry. It is, in fact, impossible to foresee the vast importance of this discovery to the fish culturist. Trout and salmon may now be produced in any quantity, and so may other fish, and may be sold at 6<2. a pound. It will give an enormous increase in our exchequer if fish should be more cultivated in our own country ; it would give employment to thousands of people, it would open new channels for the trade, other industries would derive great benefit, as there must be nets, boxes, tools, &c, &c. ; and, the greatest factor of all, the nation would be supplied with a wholesome, cheap, nutritious food. I am told that a pisciculture society has been formed by scientific men and the nobility, with the aid of the most able authorities on fish culture, to work Mr. Paul's discovery, and that Admiral His Serene Highness Prince Victor of Hohenloe Langenburg is one of the patrons. Particulars maybe had of the secretary, 177, Euston Road, N.W. William Jones, Pickle Manufacturer, Ssc, Laycock's Yard, Liverpool Road, Islington, N. \u2014 In the manufacture of pickles and various other articles coming under the title of preserves, there is no city in Europe that exhibits greater activity than London. In this connection it is a pleasure to make favourable mention of an important and highly represen tative concern like that carried on by Mr. William Jones, whose premises are conveniently located. This well-known house was established about 1877, and from the date of its origin has made rapid strides in popularity. This establishment has long been noted for its \" genuine \" pickles, such as onions and cabbage, and other vegetable relishes. Jams and general preserve goods constitute a most important item in the operations of this house, and the wholesale trade commanded is extensive and highly valuable. The superior quality of its goods has earned for it a widespread recognition, and its productions find a ready sale in all the markets of Great Britain. The premises are of moderate dimensions, and the fittings and other appliances harmonise admirably with the nature of the trade. A large staff of women is employed in the manufactory, and the greatest activity prevails. The proprietor gives his personal attention to the business, and no man gives more visible signs of his ability to meet the demands made upon his resources. He is a gentleman of long experience in this class of trade. Geo. A. Mann & Co., Cut-out Mounts, Mounting Boards, and Sundries, 12 and 14, Bury Street, Bloomsbury Square, W.C\u2014 The manufacture of cut-out mounts, mounting boards and the many sundries used by photographic dealers, carvers,\"gilders, &c, con stitutes a most important branch of industrial activity. Among the leading representatives of the trade in London is the well-known house of Geo. A. Mann & Co. This firm's business was established about thirty years ago, and has developed into one of considerable magnitude, being at present the oldest in its line. The firm manufacture specialities, for which their fame is world-wide, for their reputation on the Continent and in our colonies is scarcely less than at home. Their admirable specimens of cut-out mounts, passepartout, and mounting boards are well known among photographers, and much appreciated. They are noted for their beauty and originality of design, whilst their superiority of workmanship, finish, and durability have gained for them the con tinuous demand which has resulted in the present growth of the business. Mr. Geo. A. Mann, the head of the establishment, is a gentleman whose integrity and sound business principles have won the esteem and respect of those of the commercial community with whom he has come in contact."], [127, "MODEEN LONDON. 143 Carter & Peek, Fishing Tackle Manufacturers, 137, St. John Street Boad, E.C. \u2014 Fishing as a sport is probably more generally- popular than any other pastime. It should be duly impressed upon all would-be an- Jglers that success to a very great extent de- of every description. The firm's varnishes and finely-ground colours for the use of coach builders, painters, and others have long been renowned for their purity, durability, and general excellence, and are consequently in great demand in all parts of the country. The multiplicity of Messrs. Gorringe & Co.'s productions may be gathered from the fact that they can supply, completely and throughout, anything required by a decorator, painter, or carriage builder. The business is conducted with great energy and enterprise, giving employment to a very large number of skilled and experienced workmen. Messrs. Gorringe & Co., in addition to their extensive and high-class home connection, do a large export business. Possessing as they do a first-cUss position in commercial circles, the importance and magnitude of their operations entitle them to rank with the largest and most influential of our great commercial establishments. pends upon the class of tackle provided, and it is therefore extremely advantageous to know those firms that may be depended upon in this respect. One of the most noted is that of Messrs. Carter & Peek, a house that has been in existence upwards of a century. When it was originally founded by Mr. Carter, more than a hundred years ago, it was carried on under his Peter Moller's Cod Liver Oil, 43, Snow Hill, Holborn Viaduct, E.C. \u2014 The value of cod liver oil from a medicinal point of view is of course indisputable. The very first consideration in its extraction aud preparation must be its purity, \u2014 the obtaining of pure, fresh oil without water \u2014 and yet, strange to say, this is just where a large proportion of the cod liver oil usually sold name solely ; it was afterwards known as Carter & Sons, and subsequently as Carter Se Peek, and under each title has gained almost world-wide fame. The firm's establishment is situated at the corner of St. John Street Boad and Myddelton Place, in close proximity to the Sadlers Wells Theatre. The frontage is of considerable extent, especially in Myddelton Place, where it extends to above 120 feet. The upper floors are used as a factory, where a large number of hands are employed in various depart ments. The showrooms present a very attractive appearance, and are heavily stocked with every requisite for all descriptions of fishing. There are large storage sheds in Merlin Place for seasoning timber and cane, where an extensive stock of timber is seasoned for at least five years \u2014 a most important feature, and most necessary for the successful manufacture of rods. A very important feature is the collection of rods, which include fly rods, punt rods, trolling rods, bottom and general rods, walking-stick rods, and a great variety of other descriptions of a special character. These are of the most reliable quality, are well fitted, and in every respect the very best class of goods. Special mention must be made of the firm's hooks, lines, flies, and baits. Any angler well knows that the chief item demanding careful attention is that part of the tackle presented to the fish. One might have the most magnificent rod ever made, but unless his hooks and bait are properly \" rigged, \" and his lines trustworthy, his chances of success will be infinitesimal. The firm have therefore devoted very careful attention to this subject, and supply everything of the very best quality ; in fact, there is nothing the enterprising angler can possibly require that cannot be ob tained at this establishment. It is also advisable to notice that most of these goods are manufactured, or at least finished, on the premises. So far, mention has only been made ofthe requirements that are incidental to angling or river fishing, but the firm also supply all requisites for sea fishing, or at least so far as it is practised from a sporting point of view. Lines mounted on frames, india rubber sand eels for pollock and bass ; spinners, leads of all sizes, paternosters, loose sea hooks, conger hooks snooded on wire (a very necessary precaution), and a host of similar appliances are kept in stock on a very extensive scale. A very large business is done, not only in London, but in all parts of the United Kingdom, and, through the export department, in all parts of the world. The reputation of the firm is undoubtedly unsurpassed by any house in the trade, and there are few establishments where the proprietors can look back with such satisfaction upon a lengthy, honourable, and success ful careeE. absolutely fails. Partly from want of knowledge, and partly from a desire to obtain quantity in preference to quality, all kinds of livers are used, \u2014 good, bad, and indifferent \u2014 and from ling, hake, haddock, and especially the coal fish, all of which yield oil plentifully, but which is quite unsuitable for medicinal purposes. A large amount of faith has therefore to be exercised, and this gives rise to the absolute necessity of purchasing oil that is made by a firm upon whom thorough reliance may be placed; such a firm is trading as above, under the sty-le of Peter Moller. About 1853 Mr. Peter Midler, whose name is now known all over the world, turned his attention to remedying the defects in the wretched system of extracting the oil then so generally in vogue. A gentleman wrote to him asking his opinion on the subject of the best way of extracting the oil. Mr. Moller replied that he con sidered steam as the best agent. This correspondence was the origin of that widely-renowned preparation known as Moller's Cod Liver Oil. Mr. Moller's method is far from being any secret. It simply consists, first, in the selection of the livers, afterwards mincing, and then heating them ex ternally by steam, filtering the oil when drawn off. The lower the tempera ture the better the oil. But then the question arises, If this be the simple method of preparation, whence arises the unmistakable superiority of Moller's Cod Liver Oil ? Simply in the kind of livers that are used, aud the cleanliness exercised. At their principal fishing station, established at Stamsund, in the Lofoten Islands, the firm are, so to speak, on the spot, and obtain the livers perfectly fresh. At Mr. Moller's factory the most scrupu lous care is exercised in selecting the livers, his many years' experience and knowledge of his countrymen and their ways greatly aiding him in this. The livers are treated according to the firm's method while in a perfectly fresh state; all diseased, small, and poor livers are thrown away, and only the largest and finest are used. A very celebrated writer, M. Paul de Chaillu, in his work called \" Land of the Midnight Sun,\" gives some interesting details of Peter Moller's factory, which he visited. He admits to having been surprised to see the number of diseased and lean livers that had to be discarded, and he speaks in terms of the highest praise respecting the \" extreme care taken in all stages of the preparation of the oil.\" The Consul-General of the United States, in his last report, devotes some pages to the description of his visit to Peter Moller's fishery and the methods of producing oil. The superiority of this description of cod liver oil is stdl further proved by the fact that nineteen highest prizes have been awarded at different exhibitions. The firm have had a warehouse in London for many years, and is the only- Norwegian firm in this country importing Cod Liver Oil and supplying direct to the consumers in bottles ; they now occupy premises at 43, Snow Hill, Holborn Viaduct. An enormous trade is done all over the world, and Mr. Peter Moller's system of manufacture is acknowledged to be by far the best in the market. This reputation has led to numerous imita tions, and it has been felt necessary to adopt and register a trade mark (as shown above) for the protection of the public. Gorringe, B., & Co., Varnish, Colour, and White Lead Manufacturers, Brewery Boad, Caledonian Boad, Islington, N. \u2014 An historical review of the trades, industries, and manufactures of the metro polis is frequently not only interesting but. instructive, as displaying the origin and gradual development of some of the most gigantic establish ments the world has ever known. A century is a long time to look back upon, but it was anterior to this period, viz., in 1765, that the extensive and well-known business of Messrs. B. Gorringe & Co., varnish, colour, and white lead manufacturers, was founded. The extensive premises on which this business is carried on were built specially to ensure the safety of the valuable but highly inflammable materials employed in the process of manufacture. They cover a large area of ground, and are fitted with the best and most improved machinery and appliances. The manufacture comprises all kinds of varnishes, colours, &c, in every shade and variety, this firm being the largest importers in England of the various earths and mineral? used in this manufacture, and hold the largest stocks in the United Kingdom of varnishes, colours, Italian and Oxford ochres, Turkey amber, siennas, oxides, Indian and Turkey reds, these latter being specialities, and in these Messrs. Gorringe & Co. are acknowledged to excel every other house in the trade. In the Indian and Turkey reds they have upwards of fifty different shades. Large stocks are also held of the various oils used for painting purposes, lubricating machinery, &c, as well as painting and distempering brushes, writing and graining tools J. Pike, Manufacturing Confectioner (Ph\u0153nix Confec tionery Company), Northampton Street, Cambridge Road, Mile End, E. \u2014 Manufacturing confectionery has long occupied a prominent place in the ranks of British industry. A prominent metropolitan house in this connection is that conducted by Mr. J. Pike. This business has been established about five years, and was formerly carried on under the style of Wright Se Pike. Mr. Pike spaivs no effort to-day to main tain the well-known reputation of his business. There is no house in the metropolis that manufactures a purer or a better article, and no further proofs of superiority need be required than the extensive patronage com manded. The premises are well fitted with machinery and other necessary appliances, and under the personal superv'sion of the proprietor the work proceeds with commendable regularity."], [128, "144 MODEEN LONDON. The London Share and Debenture Company, Limited, 7, Union Court, Old Broad Street, E.C., (authorised capital, 1,000,000/.)\u2014 The company invest in the shares and debentures of joint stock under takings, besides acting as financial agents, and are acquiring an especial prominence as proprietors of the \" Compiled List of Inves tors.\" This truly colossal piece of classified work is destined to meet a long-existent requirement experienced in financial and company circles for a reliable and concise, yet complete list of names, not merely of absolute investors, though these, of course, will be in a majority, but also of \" likely \" men to be approached in such matters. It is, in short, the company's object to supply promoters of companies and projectors of financial investment schemes with a list of names of the most voluminous character that shall be of ample service to them in determining the most promising and likely quarters to which to send prospectuses of their new organisations. To this end the company have, at the cost of great labour, and at a proportionately large expense, obtained lists of shareholders in nearly eight hundred companies of all kinds, embodying a total number of 200,000 different investors, which is calculated to be about one half ofthe entire number of investors in the United Kingdom. The company pur pose to secure the names of all investors eventually, thus bringing their list up to an estimated total of 400,000 names. That the work thus far has been one of prodigious labour may be understood from the fact that out of the entirety of names secured, about 400,000 have had to be weeded out as non-effective by various causes. This careful elimination process has obviously enhanced the value of the Compiled List in a very high degree, and the amount saved in addressing from it, as compared with individual lists or partially classified lists, will unquestionably be very large for many reasons. The Compiled List is completely classified, eighteen distinct classes of investments having thus far been developed, and the names of investors therein admirably arranged in connection with those classes. The gross number of shareholders in the companies entered, and in course of being entered, up to the last time of counting was 600,000, and the number of effective names derived from this total, after excluding duplicates, triplicates, Sec, and making other desirable eliminations, amounted to barely 200,000. This speaks for the sound and careful principles upon which the List is being compiled. By addressing only one member of each family the number is further reduced to 175,000, or less. In other words, 175,000 prospectuses addressed from the Compiled List will go as far and have as good results as 600,000 addressed from unchecked individual lists, in which a host of duplicate, triplicate, and other non-effective names are bound to occur. The saving in postage and prospectuses thus effected by the employment of the Compiled List is little less than startling. It represents the difference between 600,000 and 175,000, or 425,000 prospectuses, which, with halfpenny postage, means a saving of over 2,000/., or, with penny postage, of something like 2,900/. or 3,000/. And, in addition to this, it quite obviates the real damage done by sending numbers of copies inadvertently to the same person, who, because obviously an habitual investor, is clearly of the class most likely to favourably consider a new enterprise. On the whole, then, it is manifest that the \" Compiled List of Investors \" is a work as valuable in character as it is great in magni tude, and its ultimate completion ought to, and undoubtedly will, mark an epoch in the method of systematically promoting new financial aud commercial ventures and investments. The manner in which the London Share and Debenture Company, Limited, are repaid for all this labour and expense is in itself a distinct recommendation of the List. The recom pense takes a simple and equitable proportionate form, and is derived from a rate of commission, charged according to the amount of capital subscribed by those to whom prospectuses have been forwarded by the company, who, it should be noted, undertake the addressing and despatching of the papers to the persons whose names are selected from the Compiled List. In Union Court, Old Broad Street, the company occupy several suites of offices, where the List is open to inspection by promoters. Here also is employed a staff of 60 to 70 lady clerks, all of whom are busily engaged in addressing prospectuses to possible investors. The executive routine of the business is in thoroughly capable hands, and is under the direct super vision of Mr. Le Buey, the able chairman of the company. The com pany has already been very successful in its operations, and when the List is completed \u2014 that is, when it embodies the full complement of 400,000 names \u2014 the organisation will, from the admirable and most valuable nature of the advantages it will be able to afford, occupy a well-defined position among the most important factors in the promotion of financial negotiations.

W. Dixon & Co. The premises at the above address have been occupied for the past eight years, and are of a distinctly superior order. They comprise large and handsome ground-floor shops and showrooms. The chief operations engaged in by this eminent house consist in the supply of boys' and youths' cloth ing, in which an enormous and ex haustively varied stock is constantly held, and certainly nothing in the way of wearing apparel that could possibly enter into the requirements of \" Our Boys \" has been omitted from this wondrously comprehen sive array. All styles, materials, and prices are represented in the stock, and all classes of the com munity are catered for. For in stance, boys' suits, for ages between two and twelve years, run from the 2s. lid. cloth outfit to the 50s. plush and silk suit ; and Messrs. Dixon provide youths' suits for all ages up to eighteen years, at equally cheap and wide-ranging prices, with a speciality in fine Eton suits of the most correct cut at the amazingly low figure of 25s. The firm con- stantly hold very large and well-assorted stocks of boots, shoes, and slippers, hosiery, shirts and ties, hats and caps, gloves, bags, school boxes, toys, boys' cricketing paraphernalia, dressing gowns, tennis and cricketing suits, &c, &c, with an extensive and carefully chosen selection of fine woollens for the bespoke tailoring department. \" Our Boys' \" Clothing Co. control a very extensive factory at Nottingham, employing thereat some 300 hands, and they have branch addresses in all parts of the kingdom. Messrs. W. Dixon & Co. conduct their important business with the most commendable energy and enterprise, and enjoy the benefits of a flourishing and always growing trade'. B. Bateman & Co., Manufacturers and Designers of Upholsterers' Trimmings, &.C., Embroiderers and Makers of Valances, Draperies, and Curtains to the Trade, Queen's Buildings, 179, Tottenham Court Eoad, W.\u2014 An important branch of industrial activity, and one deserving of special mention in this historical review of London's great mercantile and manufacturing interests, is the trade in upholsterers' trimmings, fringes, tassels, aud kindred products. One of the leading and most thoroughly representative firms in this line of business is that of Messrs. E. Bateman & Co. They have been estab lished since 1866, and their business has steadily developed and increased. The premises occupied are spacious, and admirably arranged and equipped with every requisite for the transaction of business. Employment is given to a large force of skilled assistants. The firm are manufacturers and designers of upholsterers' trimmings, artistic and antique fringes, laces, tassels and gimps, and are makers of valances, draperies, and curtains to the trade. Their productions are unexcelled for beauty and originality of design, superiority of workmanship, finish, and durability. These goods have a standard reputation in the trade, and with the superior facilities at their command they are enabled to offer the best terms to customers. The enterprise of this house in producing artistic novelties in all branches of its business is well known, and its goods give universal satisfaction. The head of the firm, Mr. Edwin Bateman, is a gentleman whose integrity and ability have won the esteem and' con fidence of the commercial circles in which he moves. The Hope Foundry Co., 5, Upper Thames Street, E.C.\u2014 Prominent among the many noteworthy concerns whose business activity, centred in Upper Thames Street, has made that thoroughfare practically the head-quarters of the City's great iron-founding trade, stands the Hope Foundry Co., whose career thus far has been marked by a development and progress which give promise of much prosperity iu time to come. The undertakings of the Hope Foundry Co. comprise the supplying of all kinds of castings and iron-foundry productions, among the principal items of which are stoves, ranges, kitcheners, baths, cisterns, rain-water goods, boilers, a*id many other appliances and articles of an allied nature. Banges and kitcheners constitute the leading line of stock, a very attractive display being made in these goods, and the sptcialite of this department is the"], [129, "MODEEN LONDON. 145 Edward Longley, House Furnisher and House Agent, 180, King Street West, Hammersmith, W. \u2014 Among the leading and de servedly successful commercial enterprises of Hammersmith is that of Mr. Edward Longley, house furnisher and house agent. This business was established fifty years ago, and from its inception has enjoyed a prosper ous career. The premises occupied are of spacious dimensions, and well fitted. The showrooms contain a large and. valuable stock of carpets, floorcloths, and, in fact, everything that can in any way add to the comfort and beauty of a home. Mr. Longley is the inventor and patentee of a new folding cot, which is taking a leading place amongst articles of the kind, as it is at once simple, artistic, and durable. Mr. Longley has a widespread and first-class connection, and his establishment is deservedly popular. He does a large business as house agent, and makes valuations for probate and other purposes. He is agent to the County Fire Office, Provident Life Office, Employers' Liability Corporation, and General Accident Assurance. He gives personal attention to all business, and has been remarkably successful. superiority of every article produced. The hands employed are carefully selected from the most skilled and experienced artizans, and nothing is omitted, either in the quality of the material or the system of manufacture, to produce goods that are in keeping with the reputation of the firm. A very extensive trade is done among the nobdity and gentry, not only in the metropolis but also throughout the TTnited Kingdom generally. In addition to the home trade, a very consideiable amount of business is done among patrons abroad, goods being exported to India, the Colonies generally, and the United States. As an instance of the scope that may be comprised by a good reputation, it may be specially noted that the quality of his saddlery and harness is highly appreciated in the United States, where a large and inf uential connection has been developed. The business is conducted throughout with marked ability and commendable energy, and deservedly ranks among the very foremost houses engaged in this impor tant industry. G. D. Taviner, F.R.H.S., Florist, Bayswater Hill, W.\u2014 An attractive and prominent feature in the line of artistic industries is the business of the florist, which is worthily exemplified in the well-known nurseries on Bayswater Hill, W., conducted by Mr. G. D. Taviner, Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, which were started by him some twenty years since, and have long been recognised as the leading estab lishment of their kind in the neighbourhood. The premises occupied are very extensive, and consist of a large double- fronted shop, with spacious windows decorated with choice flowers, the interior being fitted up in the similitude of a conservatory, and well stocked with exotic and other flowering and foliage plants of great beauty. Fresh cut flowers are supplied daily, and wedding bouquets and funeral wreaths and crosses made on the shortest notice. The staff employed in the nursery grounds and other departments of the business are thoroughly experienced in all the details of the horticulturist's art, and thorough organisation is exercised in every department. The trade is very extensive and of the highest class, the proprietor holding the special appointments to H.R.H. the Princess of Wales and H.R.H. the Princess Louise, and supplying the leading members of the aristocracy and gentry in the West-end. The proprietor is well known as a gentleman of great experience as a horticulturist, and is highly esteemed by his distinguished patrons for his courtesy and the careful organisation of his business, by which is ensured the prompt execution of all orders entrusted to his care. A. Ss H. Beatson, Milliners, Drapers, Ladies' and Babies' Outfitters, \u2022i.e., 268 and 270, Seven Sisters Eoad, Finsbury Park, N. \u2014 The vast population of the metropolis renders the millinery and general outfitting a most valuable branch of trade. In North London there is probably no house in this particular trade that has continued to develop its resources more steadily than that in the hands of A. & H. Beatson. Established in a very small way, with but limited resources, about nineteen years ago, energy, activity, and perseverance have made it one of the most prominent houses in the district. To supply a first-class article and appeal to a superior and influential patronage have been made the principal features of the business. The premises are very imposing, and cannot fail to attract the atten tion of the most ordinary observer. They contain large and varied stocks of hosiery and outfitting goods, special attention being paid to millinery and ladies' general wearing apparel. A large staff is employed, and the proprietors are untiring in their attention to maintain the reputa tion they have secured. Jones & Co., Tobacco Cutters and Importers of Havannan Cigars, Manilla Cheroots, -&.C., 5, King Street, and 28, Broadway, Hammersmith, W. \u2014 The leading firm of tobacco and cigar merchants in Hammersmith is Messrs. Jones & Co. This business was established originally in 1844, and its career is a good illustration of what can be accomplished by enterprise and liberal dealing. The premises occupied are of spacious dimensions, and fitted up in a neat and attractive manner. A large and carefully selected stock of Havannah cigars is kept. They are tobacco cutters, and are thus enabled to offer special advantages to customers. About three years ago the branch establishment at 28, Broadway was opened, and recently another was established at Walham Green. The success the firm are achieving is substantial and well-deserved. Mr. A. I. Jones, the proprietor, is an energetic and thoroughly reliable business man. John Douglas, Bstate Manager, &c, 12, Exhibition Road, South Kensington, S.W. \u2014 The business that is so successfully carried on by the proprietor of the above firm is one that may be considered as of a somewhat comprehensive nature. It may, for convenience of descrip tion, be considered as comprising two distinct branches, namely, that in which the proprietor acts as estate manager and transacts a large amount of business incidental to this department ; and that in which he is engaged in the practical work of house decoration, &c. The work done by an energetic estate agent is exceedingly important regarded from several points. Take, for instance, the letting of houses, either furnished or unfurnished, and it will generally be found that the individual that endeavours to dispose of his property himself will spend a considerable sum in advertising, &c, with very little result. The same may be said of people that are seeking houses for themselves. They often spend weeks in fruitless endeavours to find one suitable to their requirements, when, at a great saving of time and expense, they could probably discover what they require in a few minutes by a visit to an establishment like that of Mr. John Douglas. Of course it all depends upon the class of firm consulted, and some little care is necessary to be exercised in this respect. The success achieved in this direction by Mr. Douglas is undeniable, and is very conclusively proved in the extent and importance of his con nection. It is in having such a large connection that the advantage of patronising Mr. Douglas's office consists, as he is thus enabled to dispose of or let property expeditiously. The charges for transacting business of this kind are extremely moderate, and will compare favourably with those usually charged. Mr. Douglas's office is in a neighbourhood where there are great facilities for the development of a business of this description. In the practical work of building and house decoration the proprietor is becoming widely renowned, and more particularly in connection with sanitary work. This is a very important subject, that it is consoling to know receives much greater attention at the present time than formerly. Too much stress can hardly be laid upon the vast importance of exer cising due care in all matters of sanitation, and the individual who wilfully neglects this is committing an almost unpardonable crime against his fellow creatures. Probably half the diseases in the world arise more or less from defects in sanitary arrangements. Mr. Douglas has devoted great attention to this branch of building industry, and carries out his work upon the most approved scientific principles, with results that may fairly challenge comparison with any house in the trade. Other branches of his business include the work of surveyor, auctioneer, art decorator, and furnisher, and many other similar branches. A very large business is done in every department, and the success that has been achieved may he justly ascribed to the very exceptional ability and the energetic managerial capacity of the proprietor. James Heavens, Saddler and Harness Maker, 28, South Molton Street, W. \u2014 In any large city or town it is very evident that the industry of saddlery and harness making must of necessity hold a position of importance second to few. London is, of course, pre- eminently noted in this connection, and this not only in the branches of the trade that undertake the supply of the descriptions of harness used for ordinary purposes, but also in those departments where, from obvious reasons, the work is of a much higher class. Thus while some of the large firms devote their attention to the production of goods to suit all classes of commercial interests, there are others that exclusively cultivate the higher branches of the manufacture and command a corre- spondingly influential circle of patrons. It is to this latter class of esta- blishment that the business of Mr. James Heavens belongs. Established as far back as 1824, this well-known business may be considered as essen- tially representative of the industry viewed in its higher grades, and there are few houses that have either achieved so much success in the manufac- ture or so consistently maintained a first-class reputation. Although undertaking, as occasion may require, all departments of the work, Mr. Heavens has directed his attention chiefly to certain special and important features in the trade for which he has become more particularly noted. Prominent among these is the manufacture of the various requisites in connection with saddlery incidental to hunting, racing and steeple-chasing. It is almost unnecessary to remark that the mere fact of the work taking this direction proves conclusively that it is executed for patrons among the best classes of society, and is consequently of a very superior order. Both material and workmanship are necessarily the very best that can be produced, and every article manufactured is finished with exceptional care. Again, Mr. Heavens is very largely en gaged in producing all descriptions of outfits for cavalry and infantry officers, this likewise rendering equally imperative the production of the highest' forms of durable, perfectly finished, and elegant work. It should be noted that this work is executed upon the premises in every instance, thus affording the proprietor, who is well known for his practical ability, every facility for exercising his careful supervision and ensuring the I"], [130, "146 MODERN LONDON. Cuddeford Bros. & Co., Wine and Spirit Merchants and Agents, Miles Lane, E.C. \u2014 This prominent and influential house was founded originally as far back as 1852 by Mr. B. Cuddeford. In 1861 the style of the firm was changed from E. Cuddeford to Cuddeford Bros., and in 1862 the present well-known title was adopted. The principal is now Mr. John Cuddeford, under whose capable and vigorous direction the house has become widely popular in the trade, and has developed a very great volume of valuable wholesale business. The firm are principally wine and spirit agents for celebrated producers and distillers, and act as representatives for leading firms at Eudesheim, Cognac, Bordeaux and Beaune, all the houses in question being those of notable growers and shippers of favourite brands in French and German wines and Cognac brandy. Messrs. Cuddeford Bros. & Co. receive consignments direct from these great sources of production, handling some of the finest growths and vintages there brought to perfection, and supply the same in large quantities and parcels to the wholesale wine and spirit merchants. The trade thus controlled is one of great importance, and is valuably and influentially connected in all parts of London and the country. The general commercial methods and honourable dealings of the firm have brought them into high repute among all with whom they maintain business dealings of any kind. At the Miles Lane address the premises occupied comprise two spacious five-story buildings, forming commodious offices and stores ; and directly opposite to this establishment is the entrance to the duty-paid cellars of the house, where is held an extensive and complete stock, consisting of burgundies, champagnes, clarets, hocks, ports, sherries, cognac, whiskies, &c, in fact, almost every description of foreign wines, spirits and liqueurs. reputation as high-cla6S and artistic tailors and habit makers. Mr. E. Lee, the present head of the house, was with Messrs. Turner & Co. for over twelve years as manager, and previous to his connection with the house he now owns and conducts, he had acquired valuable experience in leading City and West-end establishments. Becently, on Messrs. Turner & Co. relinquishing business, Mr. Lee acquired, by purchase, the concern which he had so long and with such conspicuous success conducted. The trade of the house is almost entirely a bespoke one, strong support coming from tbe leading residents in the locality, also a capital connection in the West-end of London, and from the vast numbers of ships' officers fre quenting the docks to which the establishment is contiguous. The assortment of suitings, coatings, and trowserings always kept on hand is of the most comprehensive kind, special features being made of Scotch cheviots and tweeds, diagonals, and West of England goods. Every fashionable material is included in the stock. The house is managed with all the ability and enterprise for which its energetic proprietor has become noted, and is well worthy the consistent support of all in its vicinity who may value a perfectly fitting garment, made of the best material, in the best manner, and sold at a moderate cost. Zohel & Son, Euston Wreath and Cross Emporium, Architectural and Ornamental Art Metal Works, Metal Plant and Flower Manufacturers, 153, Euston Boad, N.W. \u2014 One of the most eminent of London houses in its line is that conducted by Messrs. Zobel & Son, which was established in 1844. The premises occupied by the firm are of extensive proportions, and contain large and well-appointed showrooms on the ground floor, and spacious work shops iu the rear. The stock of working plant and materials is very extensive, the firm being the principal house engaged in the trade, and the specimens of work executed exhibited in their showrooms are very original and unique in design, and the finest of the kind in London. The firm make all their own goods, and employ about twenty men and a large number of young women in the manufacture of every description of metal and porcelain everlasting Cape flower wreaths, crosses, and immortelles for decorating tombstones, graves, &c, of which some 5,000 are always in stock to select from. For the convenience of country customers and others, metal wreaths in white or green foliage, beautifully decorated with roses, camelias, may-blossoms, and forget-me-nots are sent free by parcels post on receipt of the published price in postal or money order. Inscrip tions or names in black, blue, or white beaded letters, or tablets, which have of late taken the place of beaded letters, are made to order while customers wait, and wreath cases and shades supplied from ls. each. Trough crosses, circles, anchors, or hearts for cut flowers are also on sale in Treat variety, and shippers and the trade supplied with metal wash stands and toilet sets complete, in oak or maple, at fabulously low prices. The firm bold ten prize medals, awarded for the best imitations of trees, plants, and flowers in metal. The trade is very widespread, and of the hio-hest class. Messrs. Zobel & Son are of the highest standing in the trade, and practically acquainted with all details, and their showrooms are well worthy of a visit. Davy (from Hammond's, Wholesale and Manufacturing School and General Stationers), 479, Commercial Boad East. \u2014 The prominent firm of Davy (from Hammond's), is a concern dating its history back over a term of nearly thirty years. Mr. Davy, the principal of this house, is a gentleman well and favourably known by reason of the close study he has made of all kinds of school stationery ; and the trade he has built up aud the patronage he enjoys not only compare favourably with any in London of the same description, but give one more evidence of the fact that the East is as well advanced commercially as almost any other metropolitan district. There is nothing in the way of general and commercial stationery that is not handled by this firm, but the best developed speciality is school stationery, and in this the house has a distinguished name. Improvements in all our methods of education, and enhanced conveniences in the imparting and acquisition of knowledge at our schools of every class, have given a distinct impetus to the trade of the school stationer ; and those firms who can intelligently perceive the requirements of our educational system, and competently meet the same, are achieving a well-merited success. Such a house as this is the one under notice. It would be invidious within the brief limits of our sketch to specialise particular items of this firm's fine stock, since all are so excellent, and space forbids a complete description. Still, mention must be made of Mr. Davy's atlases. These are published in great variety for the use of all grades of students and pupils, and ranging in price from one penny upwards. They embrace the entire range of general geographical teaching, and we have not seen anything more fully calculated to give entire satisfaction. Mr. Davy's latest publication in this department is the Imperial Globe Atlas, a really important work, handsomely got up, well bound, and embodying material of the very best class. There is an index of 20,000 names of places, with latitude and longitude and their positions on the maps ; and the whole is issued at the exceedingly moderate price of three shillings. It could hardly be equalled for five shillings at any ordinary establishment. New works for schools are always originating here, and Mr. Davy publishes exercise books, in sets ; also writing and dictation books, blotting books, combined slate and paper books, readers, arithmetics, geographies, grammars, Sec, in the most complete variety. Another notable speciality is the \" Sir Humphrey Davy Pen.\" This has a curved point, allowing it to glide freely over the paper without sticking or scratching, and, being gilt, it does not corrode. It is one of the best and most economical nibs in the market, even in these days of inexhaustible pen novelties. The firm supply the Board schools and leading commercial and collegiate schools in town and country, and a very large general trade is done. Mr. Davy also engages extensively in the importation of foreign fancy goods. The premises are spacious, com modious, well appointed, and heavily stocked ; and the business is energetically conducted in person by its able and experienced chief. W. Curtis, Marquee, Tent, and Tarpaulin Manu facturer, 142, Lisson Grove, Marylebone, N.W. \u2014 The old-established and well-known firm of Mr. W. Curtis, tent and tarpaulin manufacturer, of 142, Lisson Grove, Maryle bone, comes prominently before our notice, and has special claims upon our consideration. The business was established over twenty years ago at Princess Street, and afterwards in Church Street, when subsequently it was removed to the present extensive and commodious premises, which comprise a handsome cornershop and large showrooms, with a suite of well-appointed offices, the whole having a frontage of 60 feet. The manufactory and works are situated at 29, Paul Street, Portman Market, where a large staff is employed. Mr. Curtis here manufactures marquees, tents, rick cloths, flags, tarpaulins, shop blinds, awnings, ropes, &c, and is by special appointment maker of tents and nets to the Marylebone Cricket Club. Mr. Curtis has also invented many most useful and important improvements, particularly in the ventilation and ornamental lining of tents and marquees. Amongst the numerous manufactures which may be mentioned are the circular tent (as shown in cut above), varying in size from 21 to 50 feet in diameter, the gipsy tent, marquees, and square tents in every size, cricket and lawn-tennis nets, Florentine and Spanish blinds, door and balcony awnings, &c. This firm does a very extensive trade in these goods with all parts of the world. The business in every department is conducted with characteristic ability and energy. There are few men better known in the business than Mr. W. Curtis, whose well-known integrity has gained the esteem and confidence of a most extensive connection. B. Lee & Co., Tailors and Habit Makers, 185, East India Dock Boad, E. \u2014 London tailoring has a world-wide renown for superior cut and workmanship and excellence of finish. This has been the case especially during the last twenty years, and is entirely due to the fact that such able exponents of the tailor's art as Mr. B. Lee, of East India Dock Boad, E., have been engaged in building up a sound trade for themselves. The premises occupied by Mr. Lee consist of a spacious shop, with suitable workrooms. The former is handsomely and sub stantially fitted and stocked to repletion, the window show being very attractive and neatly arranged. The business is, of its classi, the oldest in the busy district in which it is located. Half a century ago it was established by Messrs. T. Turner & Co., who in their time bore an eminent"], [131, "MODEEN LONDON. 147 Thomas XTunn & Sons, Wines, Spirits, Groceries, &c, 44, Lamb's Conduit Street, W.C\u2014 As long ago as 1801 was founded by the grandfather of the present proprietor the well-known and prominent establishment of Messrs. Thomas Nunn & Sons, grocers and wine mer chants, with extensive bonded stores in London, Glasgow, and Dublin, and large wine vaults at 25, 27 and 29, Emerald Street, W.C. This old and noted heuse occupies at the first of the above-named addresses very commodious headquarters, comprising a fine ground-floor shop, with excellent street frontage and lofty Bhow-windows, and possessing a depth of about 120 feet, together with a spacious basement, the whole being handsomely appointed and well-equipped throughout with every conve nience. This firm ranks among the leading purveyors of the vicinity, and holds very large and comprehensive stocks. The departments com prise the following : sections for teas, coffees, and cocoas ; preserved fruits and confectionery ; provisions, including fish in tins, hams, tongues, and potted meats ; stationery ; staple and special groceries, Italian goods, and fine comestibles. Prominent among which may be mentioned 8 unn's Made Mustard, to which the house pays great attention. This excellent article is prepared by a peculiar process, by which the pungent properties of the essential oil are fully retained. The mustard is not flavoured in any way, is always ready for use, obviates the necessity of continual mixing, is very economical, and will be found as fresh to the palate after the lapse of years as that made on the instant. Captains of vessels and residents in the tropics will find it invaluable. Drugs, patent medicines, and proprietary articles ; perfumery and all toilet requisites ; and brooms, brushes, turnery, and ironmongery. From the foregoing it will readily be seen that Messrs. Nunn's extensive stores partake largely of the cha racter of a general supply establishment. AU goods are of the first class in matters of quality, freshness, and all-round reliability ; and the firm have formulated a 6cale of prices upon a basis of moderateness, whose advantages cannot fail to secure the full appreciation of cash purchasers, while their booking charges retain their wonted reasonable characteristics. But there yet remains for mention perhaps the most important depart ment of Messrs. Nunn's entire depot. This is \u2014 shown became instrumental in eventually effecting a complete revolution in the character of similar English productions. The Exhibition Com mittee, which included the late Sir John Herschell among a list of iUustrious names, made a most minute investigation of the various dis plays in the scientific department of the exhibition ; and, when, subse quently, the results of this inspection were made manifest, great was the surprise, and, doubtless, also the chagrin, of the older firms to learn that Negretti & Zambra had been awarded the Only Prize Medal for meteorological instruments. However, there was no surprise manifested on the part of the critical public. The instruments then exhibited by the firm were such as had never been seen by other manufacturers with the exception of Messrs. Newman & Son, whose business was afterwards bought by Negretti & Zambra. Messrs. Newman & Son were the only firm that received any award whatever in the same line This was practically the opening of a record of unsurpassed success. After thirty-six years experience they stand to-day as authorities of the greatest weight on all points connected with the many branches of modern science to whose interests their inventions are devoted. In a per sonal interview with the members ofthe committee above referred to, the attention of the firm was drawn to the great need existing in those days for a Self -Registering Standard Maximum Thermometer; and in the course of the following twelve months Mr. Negretti (now deceased) and Mr. Zambra invented, in conjunction, and perfected an instrument which fully feU in with the views expressed on the subject by the eminent scientists of the committee ; and for fourteen years subsequently they were the sole makers of the same. This class of instrument still constitutes one of the firm's leading specialities ; and the latest and, perhaps, most important of all their notable developments in thermometer manufacture, is mani fested in Negretti & Zambra's Patent Standard Deep-sea Thermometer, mounted in outer jacket and capable of resisting a pressure of three and a-half tons, whose title fully defines its utility and purpose. Among the many items of absorbing interest to the scientific student with which the show-rooms of the firm abound, are complete selections of photographic apparatus, aneroid, dial, and pediment barometers, in great variety of handsome designs ; achromatic microscopes and microscopical apparatus of every description, with objects and specimens for examina tion ; nautical instruments, including quadrants, sextants, compasses, marine telescopes, sa.linometers, drawing instruments, &c. ; a particularly choice selection of spectacles, eyeglasses and eye preservers, and general optical goods ; a series of mathematical surveying instruments con structed upon the most recently improved principles perfected by this house, and beautifully made and finished ; a large stock of standard thermometers, together with hygrometers, rain gauges, and similar atmospheric apparatus ; and the complete assortment of standard in struments required for the equipment of meteorological stations, in accordance with the regulations of the Boyal Meteorological Society, and made by Negretti & Zambra. One prominent speciality is Jordan's (Patent) Photographic Sunshine Recorder, a remarkably ingenious, yet very simple, little apparatus for keeping \"tally\" of the daily duration of bright sunshine by photographic processes. The entire display of Negretti & Zambra, apart from its technical interest, possesses many features of rare attraction, exhibiting much that is beautiful in finely finished and delicate workmanship. Mr. Negretti, during his life time, interviewed, by command, the Queen and the late Prince Consort at Osborne, with the result that a complete set of meteorological and other scientific instruments was fixed up by the firm at the Royal residence in the Isle of Wight. Since then Messrs. Negretti & Zambra have executed the principal portion of similar work for the Royal Family. They hold appointments to her Majesty the Queen and H.R.H. the Prince of Wales ; and are makers of meteorological and scientific instruments to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich ; H.M. Government Departments ; Kew Observatory ; Royal Meteorological Society, &c. They control branches at 122, Regent Street, W. (formerly the business of Mr. Newman), and at 45, Cornhill, E.C. ; they supply the chief Foreign and Colonial Governments ; their house is recognised as leading the vanguard of pro gress in every phase of each modern scientific-industrial problem ; and their trading operations and commercial connections are of a most im portant, widespread, and influential character in every quarter of the globe. It may not be out of place here, whilst speaking of the firm's original and special technical business, to say that in a separate department of their business they have a special organisation as commission merchants, and in that capacity have for more than twenty years conducted satis factorily an increasing foreign business. The bulk of this business is with large importing houses in the South American Republics, at the present time one of tie largest markets for English manufactures, and so important is their business in that direction that the house of Negretti & Zambra is as weU known to-day in Monte Video, Buenos Ayres, and some others of the large towns, as it is in London. The firm are almost weekly being offered inventions and suggestions by scientists, some of which they are instrumental in perfecting. Amongst agencies for the United Kingdom, Negretti & Zambra have been for years the sole repre sentatives of Mr. Bouerden, the inventor of the steam pressure and vacuum gauge bearing his name, and which gauges are exclusively used in our navy, they being made specially for the latter to meet special requirements, amongst which attention may be called to the high pres sure gauges for compressed-air engines in the torpedo boats. They also represent Messrs. Ritchie & Sons in Europe for their perfected and patented spirit compasses, which are so much preferred to any others in cold climates. THE WINE, SPIEIT, AND BEEE DEPAETMENT. In this connection very large and attractive stocks are held, and valuable specialities are numerous. The firm imports and bottles all its wine, and thus can guarantee purity and quality. Among the wines, in addition to a choice general selection, are special features in the firm's famous and exclusive Bronte Marsala, a wondrously cheap and palatable wine, and in their several direct importations of champagne, notably the \"DupleBsis Mornay,\" a singularly select and high-class brand, for which this house holds the sole agency for the United Kingdom. La liqueurs, there are all the best brands, both foreign and domestic, with a particular line in green ginger liqueur, a very recherche article. Among the spirits a very prominent speciality is the well-known and celebrated Deeside Scotch whisky, a mild and well-matured, full-flavoured, and healthy distillation ; the beers, ales, and stouts, are all from the best and most favourite brewers ; and particular attention is being directed to a really excellent article in real Devonshire still hard cider on draught at two shillings per gallon. This is a cider well worthy of the great success it is achieving. Throughout every department of Messrs. Nunn's fine and well-regulated establishment, the perfection of order reigns supreme, and the arrangements of the vast stocks, down even to the minutest details, is admirably effective and tasteful. The business is conducted under personal supervision with great energy and ability ; the system of opera tions has been regulated with a view to the complete convenience and full satisfaction of patrons wherever resident ; the liberal support of the best classes of custom is enjoyed, and the firm's long-sustained eminent repute has endowed their house with an important and valuable connection wide spread in all parts of town and country. Negretti & Zamora, Scientific Instrument Maters, Holborn Viaduct, E.C. \u2014 At the north-eastern corner of the junction be- tween \" the Viaduct \" and Holborn Circus, stands an establishment of fame in the annals of metropolitan technical industries, and of renown throughout the entire scientific world, the extensive depot of Messrs. Negretti & Zambra, standard meteorological and scientific instrument Makers. This distinguished house occupies at the above admirable location a large and very handsomely appointed suite of business pre- mises, comprising the entire ground floor and a portion of the upper flats in a fine building of commodious dimensions and striking struc- tural appearance. And in the various departments into which this eligible establishment is subdivided are conducted those operations in the manufacture of appliances for every branch of scientific research, whose important character and meritorious results have endowed the firm with a celebrity that is universal. Prior to the Great Exhibition of 1851, Negretti & Zambra had worked only in connection with the trade. They had travelled in all parts of the European Continent, and had found, by judicious observation, that in the matter of scientific instruments, and particularly those of a meteorological nature, England and English manufactures were far behind in the great race of progress when compared with other Continental nations. They therefore took steps to secure a stand at the Great Exhibition, and there displayed a selection of meteorological apparatus, made by themselves, of such perfect novelty and manifest worth that widespread attention was at once drawn to their exhibit, and with such excellent result that the instruments I 2"], [132, "148 MODERN LONDON. illustrious namesake\u2014 one of tho greatest painters, and undoubtedly the most eminent satirist of his age\u2014 the Messrs. Hogarth of to-day give special prominence to their dealings in pictorial works. Their display of this class of artistic product is exceptionally attractive, and is worthy of the most careful consideration. Other important departments are the making and regilding of picture frames ; the cleaning of prints and drawings that have become injured by mildew and other stains, and the mounting of the same in first-class style ; and that specially noteworthy branch, the cleaning, lining, and restoring of oil paintings. All these works are car ried out by a thoroughly trustworthy and efficient staff of operatives under the most careful personal supervision. Messrs. Hogarth & Son hold a special appointment to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, and the high esteem in which their house is held by the many who have had recourse to their artistic establishment has secured them a widespread and select class of metropolitan and provincial patronage. Thos. Wallis & Co., Drapers and Furnishing Ware housemen, Holborn Circus, E.C. \u2014 One of the most prominent establish ments in the locality of which it is such an important structural and mercantile feature, is that controlled by Messrs. Thomas Wallis & Co., drapers, Manchester warehousemen, and general furnishers. This dis tinguished house was founded as long ago as 1826 by Mr. Charles Meeking, on what was then Holborn Hill. The original premises, which adjoined the churchyard of St. Andrew's Church, disappeared in 1866, when the fine level roadway known as Holborn Viaduct replaced the steep declivities of Holborn and Snow Hills, and the present premises \u2014 a handsome stone structure of five storeys \u2014 were erected on an adjacent site, ranging along the south side of Holborn, from Bartlett's Buildings to Fetter Lane, an unrivalled street frontage, possessing a rearward depth of very con siderable extent. The whole interior of this imposing building is systematically apportioned off into distinct departments by fireproof walls, with double iron doors, and the ceilings of each section are also fireproof. The arrangement of the establishment is throughout of the most admirable character. In the spacious basement are situate an apartment for making up carpets. Here also are the several commodious wholesale departments, which send all over the world the following goods : house hold drapery and linens ; silks ; dress materials of all sorts ; mantles and costumes ; hosiery, haberdashery, gloves, lace, and general fancy drapery ; carpets, curtains, furniture, &c, &c. Then there are the country order room and the extensive packing departments. A broad corridor runs all round the basement, and in it all goods are marked off from the invoices prior to their being passed into the adjoining ware-rooms. Here are piled on all sides the enormous reserve stocks which feed, what is the chief department of this business, the retail branch, to which the whole upper portion of the building is devoted. This latter is first to he met with on the ground-floor of the building, and presents at all times and in all its divisions an aspect of wondrous commercial activity. One of the first departments encountered is that wherein are the extensive stocks of calicoes, flannels, blankets, counterpanes, table linen, and all the various articles comprised in the name of household drapery. Then come sections for silks, velvets and velveteens ; for coloured dress goods ; for haber dashery, lace, ribbons, gloves and hosiery ; mourning goods ; furnishing materials, including a fine assortment of cretonnes and tapestries ; English carpets ; and foreign carpets, including Turkish and Indian wares, beauti ful and artistic in design and blending of colours. AB these departments are completely stocked with merchandise of the very first quality, and the perfection of system and regularity prevails in all quarters. Ascending a staircase from the carpet section, and crossing a bridge into a new build ing, the section for bedroom furniture of all kinds is gained. Here is a most attractive array of beds, bedsteads, wardrobes, dressing tables, wash stands, chairs, &c, all goods of first-class character, admirably arranged; and adjoining this room is a well-equipped upholstery department. Re turning to the front of the main building, and passing along the first-floor, there are to be seen departments for dining-room furniture ; drawing room furniture, includmg some superb specimens in the Louis Seize style, now so much in vogue ; then come shawls and wraps of every description ; umbrellas, sunshades and furs ; millinery and underclothing ; costumes and children's mantles, ladies' mantles; where more mantles are sold in a day than many a London house disposes of in a fortnight, and there are excellently appointed fitting-rooms ; followed by trimmed millinery goods, in which beautiful styles and all the latest novelties are constantly shown. In each instance the display in these sections is of a most attractive order, and the arrangements for the convenience and adequate service of patrons singularly complete. Each depart ment is distinct from its neighbours; all the rooms are lofty, com modious, and weU lighted ; the arrangement of good3 is everywhere most effective ; and it would be impossible to too highly praise the good order maintained throughout the establishment. The principal counting-house is a fine apartment, and calls into requisition the services of a large clerical staff. The firm have an extensive dress making factory at 87, Hatton Garden, near by, and at the same address an office for engaging employes. The staff, all told, numbers many hundreds, of whom nearly four hundred assistants live on the premises. The comfort of this section of the employed force is studiously considered in every respect. The residents occupy roomy and well ventilated apartments, and have the advantage of a fine library, a smoking-room, and a large meeting-room in which prayers are offered every morning at 8 o'clock by the Eev. Mr. Thorne, of Holy Trinity Church, Gray's Inn Eoad, and in which lectures are delivered on winter evenings by leading clergymen and other speakers. The establishment of Messrs. Thomas Wallis & Co. is among the most complete in every particular of which the metropolis can boast. Under the able direction of Mr. Thomas Wallis, the present chief partner, the business of the house is conducted with the greatest energy, and the interests of its extensive connection are studied in every possible way. Edwin Tildesley, Stone and Granite Merchant, 11, Irongate Wharf, Paddington, W.\u2014 The eminent house of Mr. Edwin Tildesley (Telegraphic address: \"Chilmark,\" London; Telephone num ber: 7044), has a record of over fi I ty years' prominent connection with the stone and granite trade of the metropolis. The premises occupied are very extensive, comprising spacious offices, show-room, &c, and large yards where the stone is sawn and fashioned by the most ingenious and highly improved machinery. Depots are also controlled for shipping and receiving purposes at the Westbourne Park Station, G.W.R., and at Kilburn Station, L. & N.W.B. Mr. Tildesley's industrial operations are of a most important character, and include the execution of paviors' contracts, and all classes of masons' work. Specialities have been de veloped in this latter line, a leading feature being the erection of fronts of buildings entirely in stone, and in any style of architecture, or any degree of elaborate ornamentation. Several of the superb facades which now adorn Northumberland Avenue, Finsbury Pavement, Ludgate Hill, &c, are prominent testimonies to the artistic merit of_ Mr. Tildesley's work in this connection. The operative staff employed is numerous, and includes artisans of the highest skill in their respective lines. The busi ness of the house is conducted with energy and ability. The trade done extends throughout the United Kingdom ; and the superior connections now maintained are due to the eminent repute and esteem in which Mr. Tildesley's house has always been held. Cresswell Brothers, Sponge Importers, 2, Ked Lion Square, W.C. \u2014The eminent house of Messrs. Cresswell Brothers, sponge importers and merchants, occupies a leading post in the trade, importing those indispensable toilet accessories into this country from all parts of the world, and holding what is in all probability the largest and most complete stock of sponges existent in any one estab nt. The premises occupied by this well-known firm consist of two houses, that at 13a, Bed Lion Square being utilised as 6tores and warehousing de partment. The other depot (No. 2) constitutes the business headquarters, offices and show-rooms of the house, and is a spacious and well-appointed establish ment possessing an association of considerable interest to the legal mind, inasmuch as it was in days gone by the residence of Blackstone, the author of the famous \"Commentaries.\" Messrs. Cresswell Brothers have stocked the house well-nigh from cellar to garret, and the comprehensive diversity of the display, replete with unique features, is quite bewildering to the uninitiated visitor. Their stock is continually changing in its individual items; and sponges from Smyrna, from Turkey, from Egypt, from the \" Isles of Greece,\" the West Indies, Florida, Keys, and Central American waters, are no sooner in Messrs. Cresswell's ware houses than they are bought up and scattered to all quarters of the land by the demands of the retail trade, only to make way for other consign ments destined in their turn to undergo similar arbitrary dissemination. Messrs. Cresswell Brothers' stock-is a difficult one to keep up, as their purchases have to be made on the fisheries sometimes six to twelve months before the goods are required for sale, and among its many items are noticeable the famous Cuban sponges, first introduced into England by this firm. Messrs. Cresswell are sole agents for the Cuban Sponge Fishing Co., whose superior goods, at once durable, of fine quality, and economical in price, are in great demand in this country, and are obtainable solely through the medium of this house, or the retail trade supplied by them. Messrs. Cresswell Brothers employ in the various departments of their business a staff of about fifty hands. They have branches at 3, Albion Crescent, Glasgow, and 11, Weteringstraat, Amsterdam ; agencies are in operation at Berlin, Hamburg, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Christiana, Brussels, and Lisbon ; and they control buying establishments at Aegena, Greece, Smyrna, and Turkey, where a member of the family watches the interests of the house and transacts the buying portion of the business. Messrs. Cresswell Brothers conduct every branch of their important com mercial enterprise with great energy and ability, and so extensive are the ramifications of their home trade alone that the services of ei\u00b0*ht com mercial travellers are constantly in requisition on the road. The export trade controlled is also of great dimensions, and both branches are in creasing in importance year by year, while valuable connections have been developed and are now consistently maintained in all parts of the world. Messrs. Cresswell Bros. are also very large contractors to Her Majesty's Government. J. Hogarth & Sons, Frintsellers and Publishers, 473, Oxford Street. \u2014 The celebrated firm of J. Hogarth & Sons was founded about 1823, and now occupies a most prominent part in the ranks of those devoted to the higher branches of pictorial art. This firm was originally and for many years located in Great Portland Street, the Haymarket, and y6, Mount Street, Grosvenor Square ; but they removed to their present handsome premises on their completion in 1886. Here the whole of an extensive building is occupied. As is befitting the descendants of their"], [133, "MODEEN LONDON. 149 W. R. Yates, Pentonville Pianoforte Works, Pentonville Hill, N. \u2014 Pianoforte making of all kinds has during the last decade or two made wonderful progress in this country. Many firms of the first importance are occupied in meeting public demands in this branch of business. One such noted establishment is the Pentonville Pianoforte Works, of which Mr. W. R. Yates is the proprietor. This concern was started many years ago by its present controller, in one of the chief thoroughfares, namely, Pentonville Hill, on the grounds at the back of the \" Belvedere,\" famous for its racquet courts and other recreations in past years. What was then a hive of pleasure is now one of industry, as Mr. Yates has covered the ground with factories ; the steam whistle has taken the place of the trumpet, huge stacks of timber the place of flowers, drying rooms the place of fountains, &c. Much as we regret the destroying hands of the builder, this is indeed an exception to the rule, as Mr. Yates has been the cause of giving employment and bringing a vast number of artisans from all parts into the locality. He has since conducted the business with marked ability and merited success. The most prominent will serve as adequate examples. The \" Century \" Bat, first ofthe trio, possesses the advantage of a steel blade adjusted as a spring, with a break between the \" driving \" portion of the bat and the handle, thus obviating the unpleasant stinging sensation frequently conse quent upon the violent concussion of bat and ball, and greatly increasing the driving power of the bat, besides which, the peculiar shape of the handle ensures a better grip than that possessed by any other. The \" Century \" (or 100 runs) Bat is certainly about the best thing of its kind yet introduced. The '\u2022 Trough \" Crease Marker is another of Mr. Bichardson's valuable additions to the requisites of cricket. It is remarkably compact, portable, durable, and effective, and is now used at Lord's and the Oval. The third speciality selected for mention here has been brought out in the interests of that vastly popular and fashionable game, lawn tennis, and consists in tbe appropriately named \" Ever Tight \" Bacquet. This bat combines all the constructive good points of the best English made racquets with exceptional driving power, and the important quality of constant tightness in its strands. Mr. Richardson also holds a large stock of fishing tackle suitable for all lovers of \" the gentle art,\" and this department, though the latest added to the business, is rapidly increasing, orders being received by almost every post from all parts of the country. Useful fancy goods and articles for personal use, high-class cutlery, and a great variety of notable tourists' requisites, are also pro minent items of tbe stock. A special and important part of the business consists of supplying prizes for athletic sports, in which department a separate list is issued, subject to large cash discounts. The business is admirably conducted by its enterprising proprietor, who superintends in person the operations of each department; the house enjoys eminent commercial status and reputation, and- a valuable connection ; and a very large and widespread trade is controlled, extending to all parts of the world. Hopkins & Feggs, General Drapers and House Fur nishers, 60, Shoreditch, E. \u2014 One of the most extensive and noteworthy establishments of its kind in Eastern London is that controlled by the well-known firm of Messrs. Hopkins & Peggs. This old and representa tive house was founded in 1812 by the late Mr. John Hopkins, whose first place of business was situate on the site of the mansion of Sir Thomas Hope Byde, some time Alderman of the City of London. Subsequently the name of the firm underwent several changes, becoming, in turn, Hopkins & Son (1842), Hopkins, Peggs, & Hopkins (1854), and eventu ally Hopkins & Peggs, as at the present day. The proprietary now comprises the two Messrs. Peggs, under whose able control the business has been most rapidly developed. The premises occupied range over six fine shops of very considerable depth, with advantageous frontages and entrances in Shoreditch and in Bethnal Green Boad. The firm have just completed the reconstruction of a large portion of this eligible establish ment. The departments for house furnishing generally they have most successfully developed. Four spacious and specially lighted warehouses have been constructed, with galleries running all round their interiors, for the display of every description of house furniture. A fine new and uniform range of large show windows has been put in ; and the whole establishment in its enlarged and improved form now constitutes a striking architectural advancement in this part of Shoreditch. The lighting of the warehouses is especially to be commended. The ground floor of Messrs. Hopkins & Peggs' establishment is entirely laid out as shops and show rooms for the leading departments of their important business, including those for drapery and upholstery fabrics, furniture, carpets, and all requi sites for the complete house-furnishing trade. The drapery department is particularly noteworthy, and contains a fine assortment of goods in each of its sub-divisions: dress goods, mourning, fancy goods, costumes, mantles, baby-linen, and underclothing. In furniture, carpets, and cabinet-work generally, Messrs. Hopkins & Peggs cater for all classes of the community. The stock of carpets and floor coverings will compare favourably with the best assortments in the trade ; and an excellent display is made in the bedding department, where are shown mattresses, palliasses, and feather-bed sets at all prices. The firm furnish estimates for complete house furnishing free of charge. Messrs. Hopkins & Peggs undertake the removal of household furniture and the warehousing of the same, and at the rear of the Shoreditch premises are the well-arranged stables, designed to accommodate the numerous horses engaged in this branch and in the delivery of goods throughout the metropolitan area. On the ground and first floors of the establishment are found the showrooms for the firm's important millinery and dressmaking departments, together with the spacious workrooms in connection therewith. A numerous staff of highly skilled dressmakers and milliners is employed. The upper floors of the buildings contain the dining-room, library, and sleeping apartments of the large resident staff; and the deep personal interest manifested by the firm in the welfare of their employes, and the careful consideration accorded to everything conducive to the individual comfort and social advancement of their numerous assistants, are in the highest degree creditable to the benevolence and good nature of the partners. A large and well-connected trade is controlled, embracing the whole of London and its suburbs, and extending throughout a very considerable portion of the eastern counties. works and showrooms are contiguous, and are both admirably located at a prominent part of one of North London's chief thoroughfares. The work turned out by the establishment is of a very superior class. For this reason, which is perfectly well known and widely appreciated, a continual flow of orders is the result, and the numerous body of workmen employed is continually kept at high pressure in order to effect their prompt execution. A large space is covered by the works \u2014 over 12,000 feet superficial area \u2014 and they are fitted up with every mechanical appli ance required in the many delicate and exacting processes conducted on the premises. Every conceivable form of piano is manufactured, and the speciality to which great attention is given is the upright grand. In this particular line the firm has won an enviable reputation for the best kind of work, and the pianos with the imprimatur of the house stand high in the estimation of the musical world. The trade is principally wholesale and export. The connections of the house are to be found all over the kingdom, on the Continent, and in America. Even New Zealand and Australia send their quota of orders. The productions of the house are noted for depth, richness and beauty of tone, and delicacy of touch. The concern is managed in a faultless manner by Mr. W. B. Yates, whose great assistants in winning success have been and are his own energy and ability. Henry Richardson, Southern Counties Depot for Sports and Games, 77, Finsbury Pavement, E.C. \u2014 This important business, now carried on by Mr. Henry Bichardson, and widely known as the Southern Counties Depfit for Sports and Games, was founded as far back as 1836, and was taken over by its present proprietor about five years ago. Under the new control many departments were added to the establishment, and those already existing were considerably developed. The premises occupied, conveniently situate close to Moorgate Street Station, are large and commodious, comprising a handsome ground floor shop, with a roomy basement beneath, the whole having a street frontage of thirty feet, and extending back in the rear to about double that distance. Here are held very complete and comprehensive stocks, embracing every class and description of articles and implements necessary to the proper enjoyment of such favourite games, sports, and pastimes as cricket, lawn tennis, football, lacrosse, fencing, boxing, bowls, fishing tackle, hockey, golf, and all manner of outdoor and indoor amusements. Mr. Eichardson is well known in pastime circles for a number of valuable inventions of his own, which reflect high credit at once upon his ingenuity and upon his sound knowledge of the requirements of the several branches of sport and recieation. Among the specialities he has thus developed, three of the"], [134, "150 MODERN LONDON. H. S. Fitter & Sons, Wholesale Meat Salesmen, 142 and 105, London Central Meat Market, E.C. \u2014 Among the old and well-known firms of wholesale meat salesmen is that of Messrs. H. S. Fitter & Sons. This business was established in 1856 in the Leadenhall Market, and was removed to the present address in 1873. From its very inception, being conducted on enterprising lines, the business has steadily prospered, and its successful career furnishes a good illustration of what can be accom plished by well-directed energies and sound business principles. The firm have two establishments in the Central Meat Market, and employ a force of forty men. Their name is well known in all parts of the world, whence meat is sent to the London market, and their latest success is testified by the large consignments of frozen meat they are receiving from New Zealand. Having superior facilities at their command, they are enabled to offer special advantages to their clients, and their every effort seems to be to conduct the business in a thoroughly satisfactory manner. The members of the firm are enterprising and reliable business men, and well deserving of the substantial success they are achieving. Godfrey S. Saunders & Co., Foreign Hardwood Mer chants, 5, New London Street, E.C. \u2014 The diversity of useful and ornamental purposes to which foreign hardwoods can be put, more especially in the lines of table and cabinet making, render their importa tion a most significant feature of commercial activity. A leading and prominent house engaged in this line of trade is that of Messrs. Godfrey S. Saunders Se Co., of the foregoing address. This enterprise has now been in active operation for several years past, and the present wide extent of its business operations affords ample evidence of the superior skill and able management that have from its inception characterised its conduct. The house deals extensively in every description of foreign hardwoods, and they have also a large home and foreign trade with all the leading houses in every branch in which hardwoods are used, notably pianoforte and cutlery manufactories, and with the principal shipbuilders. The con signments of the house are stored at the various docks of discharge, and are of such a heavy character as to fully meet the most exacting demands of the trade. Having thus briefly sketched the facilities of this house, it only remains to be added that its business is conducted on the strictest principles of commercial intregity, and relations once entered into with it are sure to become pleasant, profitable, and permanent. G. F. Tupper, Lithographer, 10, Arthur Street West, E.C. \u2014 One of the oldest houses among lithographers is that originally founded in 1828 by Mr. G. F. Tupper, the most accomplished cali graphist of his time. Although still known under the original title, the business has been carried on for about twenty years by the sons of the late proprietor. Both Mr. G. I. F. Tupper and Mr. A. C. Tupper have been in the business during the whole of their lives, and they are there fore thoroughly experienced. The firm executes all descriptions of litho graphy, and is specially renowned in connection with what is known as sac-simile work. Their works and offices, situated as above, are admir ably fitted with presses, machines, &c, of the most improved and modern form. The offices contain many remarkable specimens of their special work in reproducing autograph letters, &c. Among these may be noted sac-simile letters of Lord Byron, Keats, Thomas Carlyle, Lord Nelson, the Duke of Kent, and a specimen which really ranks as fine-art work, viz., a sac-simile of an Admiralty chart. The connection is widespread and important, both among the trade and the general public, a very large amount of important work being executed in all branches of lithography. The business is ably conducted, and occupies a leading position among the foremost houses in the trade throughout the metropolis. W. Hofer, Manufacturer of Bronze Powders, &c, London and Erlangen (represented by Richard Holer, 37, Upper Thames Street, E.C.). \u2014 London is the recognised centre of the trade in printers' and lithographers' supplies, and in this branch of commercial activity no house stands higher than that of Mr. W. Hofer, manufacturer of bronze powders and brocade, gold, silver, and metal leaf. The business was originally established at Erlangen, Bavaria, some forty years ago, hy Mr. W. Hofer, who has a large factory in that district, and its London representation has been established for the past four years under the management of his son, Mr. Eichard Hofer. The premises here occupied consist of large stockroom and offices, admirably adapted for the storage of supplies, and a sound business is transacted with the leading printers and lithographers of London and the provinces. The bronze powders and brocades manufactured by this house obtained medals for superior excel lence in London in 1862 and 1884, and at Amsterdam in 1883, and are regarded by the trade as the best on the market ; and the Messrs. Hofer enjoy the confidence and esteem of the commercial community, and are fully deserving of the marked degree of success they have attained. Gilbert L. Bauer & Co., Organ and Harmonium Manu facturers, 34, King's Boad, N.W. \u2014 Organ and harmonium manufacturing constitutes a most important and active branch of industry in the north of London. A prominent house in this connection is that conducted by Messrs. Gilbert L. Bauer & Co., whose neat and well-proportioned premises are conveniently situated at 34, King's Boad, St. Pancras. This business was established in 1865, and from the date of its inception each succeeding year has been marked with a degree of development that cannot find a parallel in the operations of any other establishment. Its productions have attained the highest degree of perfection, and no further proofs of their extraordinary merit and superiority need be looked for beyond the official recognition they have commanded at various im portant exhibitions throughout the world. A special production of this house is an instrument known as the Grand Concert Model Harmonium, which obtained a silver medal at the \"Inventories\" in 1885, this being the highest award, as no gold medal was given. Several other features equally meritorious mark the operations of this concern, notably the \" New Bent Beed,\" the \" Double Touch,\" and the \" Pneumatic Fortes.\" In every respect the instruments of this establishment are models of completeness and perfection. They are highly appreciated, and are so constructed as to render them impervious to the severity of any climate. As an instance of their adaptability in this connection it may be mentioned that they are supplied to the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Com pany's boats, and Messrs. Donald Currie's boats, &c, and the connection in the home counties is of a most influential and valuable character. Mr. Gilbert L. Bauer, having served in all upwards of seven years at the bench, both in England and France, has a thorough practical knowledge of all branches of the trade. Mr. Gilbert L. Bauer is a gentleman whose ability in this particular capacity as a manufacturer and as a player has long since been fully recognised, and whose energy and untiring enterprise richly deserve the success he has attained. Edw. S. Johnson, Wholesale and Retail Ironmonger, locksmith. Bellhanger, and Gasfitter, 414, Mare Street, Hackney, E.\u2014 Many very substantial firms are engaged in the ironmongery business, and one of the best medium-class houses is that conducted by Mr. Edw. S. Johnson, at the above address. This business is well known all over the East-end, and was established sixteen years ago. Every item of general ironmongery for household furnishing and domestic use and for cabinet makers is kept on sale in great profusion and variety. Builders' ironmongery is a special feature of the establishment, and this, together with the cabinet makers' fittings, are the most important departments of the business. The concern is well managed, customers are liberally treated, and a moderate price is charged for all goods so that the concern really merits its popularity and success, and its proprietor the respect and esteem of his widespread connection."], [135, "MODEEN LONDON. 151 B. S. Snell, Tin Box and Canister Manufacturer, 41 and 42, Great Prescott Street, Goodman's Fields, E.C.\u2014 An important house in its line is that of Mr. E. S. Snell, tin box and canister manufac turer. This is a very old-established business, having been founded nearly a century ago by Mr. Kirkness, father-in-law of the present proprietor, who successfully built up an extensive trade, which has since been ably maintained and considerably increased by Mr. Snell. The present pre mises, which have been occupied for more than half a century, consist of a spacious building of three stories, and having a street frontage of forty -five feet. The stocks of material and working plant are very ex tensive. A very large business is done in the manufacture of canisters for the reception and stocking of every description of merchandise, especially confectioners' and grocers' goods, and the work of this kind turned out combines the neatest designs with the utmost durability obtain able ; the wide connection enjoyed is ample proof of the superiority of the goods. About fifty hands are employed in the different branches of the factory, which is one of the most important concerns of its kind in this part of London. The proprietor is a gentleman much esteemed by his clients for the promptness with which he carries out all orders entrusted to him. Many of the best English houses are also supplied from this factory. A very large staff of skilled workmen is constantly employed ; and on the average about ten new pianos are turned out weekly during the winter months, the weekly average for the entire year being about six. A large number of hands are employed in the reconstruction of old pianos, these being entirely renovated in tone and touch. In the showrooms in Wenlock Street are exhibited many beautiful specimens of this firm's manufacture, which for elegance of design and richness of tone are unequalled. Many eminent, musicians have expressed high opinions of their excellence. Mr. A. J. Harland has, by his well-known integrity, gained the esteem and confidence of a wide and valuable connection. Samuel Moses, Second-hand Clothing Merchant and Contractor, 65, Mansell Street, E. \u2014 Though many second-hand clothing merchants style themselves Government contractors, as a matter of fact Mr. Samuel Moses is alone entitled to the designation. The business of the firm is enormous, and the premises occupied by Mr. Moses extend from Mansell Street right back into Tenter Street, while there are numerous detached and supplementary warehouses and factories in Great Alie Street and elsewhere, each of which is stocked with second hand clothes of every description. Mr. Moses contracts with the War Office, the Admiralty, the Home Office, tbe India Office, the various constabulary forces, Christ Church Schools, tbe railway companies, the volunteers, and numerous foreign governments for the purchase of left off clothing and uniforms. For the purposes of the business the firm have branches at Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Alexandria, Cairo, and various other places. The larger portion of the clothing is conveyed to the warehouses in Mansell Street, where much of it is cut up and remade into children's clothing, or articles of rough attire for labourers and work ing men. Other portions are resold to various second-hand clothing merchants ; some is sent out to be sold to the natives of Western Africa, who are great admirers of the bright colours of soldiers' clothing. Many of the naval and military officers' uniforms are despatched to the Cape, and sold to the native chiefs. Sometimes the ornaments and gold lace is taken off the uniforms, melted down, and sold to the jewellers. Mr. Moses employs a working staff numbering several hundreds, and is extremely well known in the City. G. T. Atkinson, Wholesale Confectioner, 159 and 161, King's Cross Road, W.C. \u2014 Few trades have advanced so rapidly in ublic favour as that of confectionery. Not long since most goods in this line were introduced to this country from France and Austria, but now we have English houses capable of successfully competing with any establishment on the Continent. A notable example of the truth of this is the well-knowu business belonging to Mr. George T. Atkinson. This concern, which has made its mark in its branch of industry, has been established since 1851, and during all the intervening years its progress has been steady, and of such a character that it holds a leading position among similar metropolitan houses. The business was started by the late Mr. J. G. Hall, who conducted it with great success for many years till it was taken over by its present owner. The premises comprise shop, warehouse, and workshop at the back on the ground floor ; these are all very spacious, and admirably fitted and arranged for the due transaction of the operations to which the house is devoted. All sorts of sweetmeats, bon-bons, lozenges, surprise packets, and the numerous other items included in a confectioner's stock are made on the premises by a com petent staff, and in all the daintiest and most artistic shapes and designs. These are quickly and extensively sold to the large connection enjoyed by the house among the retail shops and other customers in all parts' of the city and suburbs. Mr. Atkinson is thoroughly au fait in all details of his business, and respected by his influential clientele as an honourable and energetic man of business. J. A. Foirez & Co., Wine and Spirit Shippers, 2, Copthall Buildings, Copthall Court, E.C. \u2014 Among the numerous City houses engaged in the shipment and supply of foreign wines and spirits, that of Messrs. J. A. Poirez & Co. holds a position of considerable promi nence. The business in question was founded in 1871, and under capable, conscientious, aud thoroughly judicious direction, it has pursued a course of constant development. Messrs. Poirez are extensive importers of champagnes, clarets, ports, sherries, and hocks, &c, from France, Portu gal, Spain, Germany. Sec, and also of brandy, rum, and gin, which they receive from the leading sources of foreign supply. They deal, further more, in Irish and Scotch whiskies, and London gin, and hold in bond a large and comprehensive stock of carefully selected and first-class goods. A large and important trade is controlled among members of the Stock and Wool Exchanges, bankers, and City merchants of prominence. Messrs. Poirez & Co. make a special point of supplying consumers direct with the best obtainable goods at the lowest available prices, and have developed a widespread and desirable patronage, their customers being numbered among the residents of all parts of London and the surrounding district. B. Puxon & Son, Bacon Dryers, Radsworth Street, Bald- win Street, City Eoad, E.C., and at Bull Yard, St. John's Street, West Smithfield.\u2014 Among the many large and important manufacturing estab- lishments in the vicinity of the City Boad and St. Luke's, none perhaps figure more prominently than the well-known bacon stoves of Messrs. E. Puxon & Son. This first-class business was founded upwards of half a century ago, and its reputation extends throughout the kingdom. The business operations are on a most extensive scale. The firm are dryers of all kinds of bacon and hams for the provision trades. Their method of smoking is on a highly improved system, imparting a very delicious flavour, which is so greatly appreciated by the public and consumers that many leading provision merchants and dealers entrust to this firm tbe whole of their drying business for bacon and hams. The premises in Badsworth Street, Baldwin Street, are very extensive, and comprise a large building and drying rooms containing no fewer than eight stoves, and some idea of the extent of business done may be formed from the fact that each of these stoves measures sixteen feet square, and above them, at some considerable elevation, are hung successive rows of sides of bacon and hams for drying, sawdust fires being kept burning continually. The premises at West Smithfield are similarly arranged, but on a slightly smaller scale. A large amount of drying is done for the salesmen of the metropolitan markets, who retail the bacon and hams from these stoves. The principals are well-known as men of the highest commercial status and strictest integrity. Lewer & Diedrichs, Foreign Agents and Commission Merchants, 147, Cheapside, E.C. \u2014 A rising house representing the general foreign trade is that conducted by Messrs. Lewer & Diedrichs, which was established some three years since. The premises occupied are a third-floor warehouse, fitted with office accommodation and otherwise well appointed. The operations of the house consist in dealing in all kinds of foreign goods, the lines to which special attention is devoted being drapery goods and fancy articles, for both of which the house is already well-known. The business is conducted with tact, push, and energy. The trade is of a wholesale and export nature, and is particularly well established among the wholesale houses and shippers in the City. The partners are men of capacity, and thoroughly acquainted with the home and foreign markets. A. J. Harland, Pianoforte Manufacturer, 65 and 106, Wenlock Street. \u2014 The determination to manufacture nothing but first-class articles has ever been characteristic of the well-known busi ness of Mr. A. J. Harland, pianoforte manufacturer, originally estab lished in the year 1879, in a very modest and unpretentious manner. This business has developed to such proportions as to be recognised as one of the leading houses in the trade. The factory, situated at 1a, Evelyn Street, although very extensive, is scarcely adequate to the demands of the business, and the proprietor is contemplating opening another. The export trade is an important feature, business being done with Australia, China, Africa, and other parts of the world. On the occasion of our visit six fine instruments were being packed for Sydney. These pianos are suitably fitted to adapt them for the various climates. S. M. McBwan, Timber and Veneer Merchant, and Dealer In Cabinet Makers' Hardware, 282, Old Street, E.C. \u2014 In the timber and hardware trade of the metropolis a representative or reliable concern is that carried on by Mrs. S. M. McEwan, whose well-arranged premises are conveniently located. This notable house dates its origin back to 1863. The magnitude of the stock, and the variety ofthe timber goods, &c, are sufficient evidence of the value and stability of the business. Ivory and tortoiseshell are also included in the goods stocked, and in every requisite for cabinet making the resources of the establish ment are sufficient to meet any demand."], [136, "MODEEN LONDON. 152 pany, Limited. It was established several years ago, and its organisation met a long-felt want. This is proved by the large and steadily increasing patronage it enjoys. The speciality of the company is the production of handsomely designed menus, theatrical and other programmes. Talented artists are employed, and the work turned out is unexcelled The Edwardes Menu Company, Limited, 6, Adam Street, Adelphi, W.C. \u2014 An important branch of industrial activity in London, and one which has attained a high degree of perfection, is the designing and manufacturing of artistic menus and programmes.

The company also does an extensive business as advertising contractors, for which it possesses excellent opportunities and connections. Mr. P. J. Edwardes, the secretary, is a gentleman of great ability and energy, and has secured the success of the undertaking he conducts. Under his judicious and enterprising management, the affairs of the company are prospering beyond anticipation, and give promise of a very successful future. for which, it is gratifying to state, the manufacturers of Finsbury have achieved well-merited repute. As if to exemplify their capacity for the production of such goods, Messrs. Fox show some particularly fine specimens of fancy cabinet work, in which an exceptional degree of artistic taste is illustrated ; but no speciality of distinct importance is developed in this line, the firm devoting their chief attention to the manufacture of plain and substantial articles, in which branch they have acquired their most eminent renown. This business is personally con ducted by Messrs. Charles, Thomas, and George Fox, three gentlemen of long practical experience in the trade, and of sound acquaintance with every requirement of the present day in household and other furniture ; and admirable energy and ability are brought to bear upon the direction of every undertaking ofthe house in the representative industry of which it is a deservedly honoured exponent. The firm's connections are of a widespread, valuable, and old-established order ; and a most extensive home and export trade is controlled, taking effect in all parts of the United Kingdom and throughout the British dominions abroad. C. Ss T. Fox & Co., Wholesale Cabinet Makers and Upholsterers, 7, 8, 9, and 10, Eldon Street, Finsbury, E.C One of the most prominent among the many notable houses whose enterprise and industrial activity have made the district of Finsbury one of the greatest furniture manufacturing centres in the world is that of Messrs. C. & T. Fox & Co., the well-known wholesale cabinet makers and upholsterers, of 7, 8, 9 and 10, Eldon Street, E.C. This distinguished firm was founded upwards of sixty years ago, and has, during the period elapsing since its original establishment under the name of Fox, built up and developed a business and industry that are hardly second in magnitude and note worthiness to any in Finsbury. The premises occupied at the above address are very large and commodious, standing upon an advantageous corner site, possessing a total street frontage of about 170 feet, and comprising a fine suite of showrooms, with capacious warehouses at the rear. The building contains a basement and four large floors above, has a commanding appearance, and is in every respect well adapted to the requirements of a great wholesale furniture trade. Messrs. C. & T. Fox & Co. are widely and favourably known as manufacturers of all kinds of cabinet and upholstered goods for the home and export markets, and to these two departments of the industry* their attention is strictly confined and closely directed. The best results have attended this narrowing of operations within well-defined limits, and in cabinet making and upholstery the name of the house has become most creditably identified with the best and most thoroughly reliable classes of work. The stocks held are very extensive, embracing everything in manufactured goods that can be classed under the two heads above mentioned ; and a fine display is made in the well-ordered and attractive showrooms of both plain and polished furniture, all the individual items of which are distinguished by an elegance of design and a beauty of finish which, coupled with much grace and originality of form and a manifest soundness of construction and workmanship, invest the exhibit, collectively, with strong claims upon the attention of all admirers of the reliable furniture Mark Deed & Sons, Leather Merchants, 4*2, High Street, Bloomsbury, W.C., and 18, Tottenham Court Boad, W.\u2014 This first-class and much-respected house was founded in 1846 in High Street, Blooms bury, and the branch in Tottenham Court Boad in 1883. It was originally started by Mr. Mark Deed, the present proprietor, the firm for many years being known as Mark Deed & Sons. Mr. Mark Deed, who has had a practical training in all the branches and details of the trade, in 1 883 opened a branch at 18, Tottenham Court Boad.

Mr. Bingham's premises comprise a corner site, with a large railed-in yard in the front, having a frontage of over 150 feet, premises in the rear, and five showrooms on the ground floor. The stocks held are of a comprehensive nature, a very fine display being made in artistic marble and tile work, such as chimney-pieces and over mantels, which is one of the special features of the business. Several exceedingly well-executed headstones and monuments are also exhibited. A noteworthy speciality in which the house has made a very high repu tation is the manufacture of the celebrated \" Nautilus Grate,\" which is patented in Great Britain, United States, Canada, and Belgium, and received the highest award (silver medal) for dog grates at the Inter- national Health Exhibition, 1884. The Nautilus grate is a fire-brick lined, slow-combustion, smoke-consuming, portable dog stove, in form resembling a nautilus shell or volute, and is the most artistic, scientific, economical, cleanly, and powerful of all domestic fireplaces. There are also on view a large number of slow-combustion stoves of various designs, and all kinds of encaustic and \u00e6sthetic tiled hearths. Mosaic tiled and marble floors are also laid to any pattern desired. Another feature of the business for which the firm is noted is their kitchen ranges, to which very great attention is given. All the working parts of these domestic requisites are so made that when burned out they can be replaced with out the aid of skilled workmen. All the stocks are exceedingly well kept. The trade is very extensive, and of a home and export nature, the pro prietor holding the special appointment to the Queen, and his private custom is of the highest class. The proprietor is well known as a gentle man practically acquainted with all the details of the business, and of the highest commercial status.

The business has been estab- lished about thirty-seven years. When the firm first commenced business few could guess the development their dealings would ere long attain. At the present moment the name of Gordon & Gotch, to the Austra- lasian and New Zealand colonist, is as familiar as household words, whilst the firm itself has made an honourable name in the annals of our British commerce. Nor are their business efforts confined merely to the Antipodes, as they now do an important and increasing business with America, India, the Cape, &c, &c, not only as publishers, exporters of books, periodicals, printing materials, &c, &c, and as advertising agents for the principal newspapers, but also in sewing machines and other useful specialities, more especially the \" American Domestic \" Family and Hand-sewing Machine, of which they sell an enormous quantity from year to year. Their price list of this desirable household addendum shows that it is admirably adapted for many more extended uses than its name would originally lead the uninitiated to suppose, a fact which goes far towards justifying the title which they claim for it \u2014 \" The Model Machine of the Age.\" Messrs. Gordon & Gotch for some years have published \" The Australian Handbook,\" to which useful compendium of antipodian, general, and commercial information they are yearly making valuable and important addenda.

Pearce Sc Heatley, Horticultural Builders and Heating EDijineers, Holloway Boad, N. \u2014 The building trade of London and suburbs is one of great extent, and on the whole it is carried on by eminently respectable houses. Among these, few stand higher in popular estimation in their own particular district than the firm of Pearce & Heatley. They carry on all branches of the business of builders and decorators, but they devote special attention to horticultural building in every depart ment. Indeed, their business chiefly consists in supplying garden and conservatory appliances of every description, from the simplest to the most complex. Portable garden frames, portable greenhouses, with sashes or bars on roof, can be had in any shape, and at prices that defy competition. The \" Speciality \" greenhouse, with staging on both sides, ventilators, ornamental ridge aud finials, is one of the most elegant pro ductions that could grace a garden or private house.

Heating apparatuses comprise the \" Acme \" slow combustion and the Patent Horse-shoe, and saddle, tubular, and other boilers, which are manufactured on a large scale.

Beeman & Roberts, Remington Typewriter, 61, Cheap. side, E.C. \u2014 Upwards of seven years ago was founded the well-known house of Messrs. Beeman & Boberts, who engage very largely in sup plying in all parts of the United Kingdom that admirable mechanical aid to authors, journalists, merchants, professional men, and every body whose calling or avocation necessitates any considerable use of the pen, the Bemington Typewriter. This notable firm commenced their operations in London, at the time above mentioned, as sole agents for the Bemington Machine, but have extended the scope and character of their business until it now also embraces the manufacture of these type writers, a branch of industry which they now vigorously carry on. The premises occupied in Cheapside are spacious and well suited to the purposes of the trade engaged in ; and a large and complete assortment of Bemington typewriters can always be seen at that address. Con cerning the merits of this excellent machine, so much has already been written and said that any extended comment upon its construction and characteristics would in these pages be quite superfluous, being merely a reiteration of facts already well known and quite familiar to the public of both the old and new worlds. The Bemington Typewriter as it now exists is the perfected form of the original machine, first invented in the United States some twenty years ago, to perform, as its name im plies, the office of writing with metallic types in such a manner as to dis pense with any previous use of pen, ink, and paper. It is now universally acknowledged to have no superior in any apparatus of its kind, and stands virtually unrivalled as a thoroughly practical, always reliable, speedy, neat, accurate, aud easily manipulated type-writing machine. It is capable, under ordinarily good control, of attaining more than twice the speed of the pen ; and its legibility, economy, and convenience constitute advantages over the usual methods and implements of writing that render it absolutely invaluable as an accessory to every business man's establishment, and bring it constantly more and more into the favour of those with whom the labour of peu and ink is a daily necessity. There is no fatigue about the operation of a \" Bemington \"; no \" writer's cramp \" to dread ; no danger of error or misunderstanding through illegibility of caligraphy ; and no loss of time in the laborious working out of valuable manuscripts. The success that the machine has achieved, and its triumph over the manual process, are therefore not to be wondered at ; and it is no matter for sur prise that in every Government office, in every bank, mercantile house of importance, lawyer's office, editor's sanctum, author's, clergyman's, and professional man's study the type-writer has found its post of honour, and is doing a work the value of which is every day becoming more fully apparent. It is the outcome of years of patient endeavour towards the attainment of perfection \u2014 the result of lavishly expended money, time, labour and in genuity ; and it stands to-day a bright and perfect exemplification of what man's genius aud perseverance can accomplish in lightening the labours of his fellow men. Messrs. Beeman & Boberts are conducting their business in the manufacture and sale of this excellent machine with great spirit, energy, and enterprise ; aud their house now controls a trade which is most noteworthy as illustrating the successful development of one great speciality, and which exends its operations with ever-growing importance to all parts of Great Britain and Ireland. Clarke & Company, Pattern Card Makers, Whole sale and Manufacturing; Stationers, Account Book Makers, Steam Printers, &.C., 33, 34, and 35, Gutter Lane, E.C. \u2014 A noteworthy and representative house in its important business and industrial line is that of Messrs. Clarke Se Co., the well-known pattern card makers and wholesale and manufacturing stationers, of the above address. This pro minent firm was founded under its present title and proprietary some ten years ago, and it occupies at the above address large and convenient premises, which are mainly devoted to manufacturing and stockroom purposes, and which are admirably suited to the requirements of the im portant trade and industry carried on by the house. Here Messrs. Clarke & Co. have a most complete establishment, fully equipped with every modern convenience, and containing machines of the newest type, and a fixed plant of a most valuable character. Large and comprehensive stocks are held in the spacious warerooms of the multifarious textile fabrics and other articles which are used in the pattern card making departments, and also of commercial and general stationery of every sort and descrip tion. From an industrial point of view the firm's operations are very extensive, including, besides the pattern card industry, which is a speciality of the firm's, the execution of all branches of steam printing, designing,en graving, lithographing, and die-sinking. In these lines, severally and collectively, a splendid reputation has been firmly established for uniform excellence and high-class character of all work turned out. Specialities are very numerous with Messrs. Clarke & Co., chief among which is the pattern card industry before referred to, and from the artistic designs and excellent workmanship turned out from the various departments in which these cards are made, is due the high reputation the firm has obtained for this class of work. Each department is under the supervision of an able and experienced manager, who attends carefully to every detail ; and when we state that among the numerous fabrics that are set up on these cards are silks, satins, plushes, velvets, nets, gauzes, tulles, gossamers, frillings, Sec, Sec, it will be readily believed that great delicacy of touch and neatness of workmanship is required in dealing with such materials. A large assortment of tinted papers is kept iu stock, specially prepared for lace mounting. Among the many different descriptions of cards, we noticed cards representing, by the aid of photo-iithography, such articles as ties, braces, lace curtains, &c, which give very truthful and effective representations of the several articles. Hardware, cutlery, buttons, haber- dashery, blinds, fringes, collars, cuffs, and upholstery goods figure on Messrs. Clarke & Co.'s cards \u2014 indeed, there seems to be scarcely an article in the dry goods and hardware trades that are not represented iu one or other of their departments. Leading features of much value and note have also been developed in catering for the supply of drapers' stationery. In this connection special attention is given to the manufacture and supply, either in stock styles or designed and printed to order, of gum and pin- ning tickets of all kinds, also great varieties of ticket bands and tags for dry goods, paper fasteners, drapers' cloth and fixture boxes. Excellent facilities are possessed for the folding and boxing of robes, in which line the house is largely employed. Account-book manufacturing constitutes another leading branch of this busy firm's comprehensive trade. As drapers' sundriesmen, supplying all classes of stationery requisites for the use of merchants in textile fabrics and general dry-goods, Messrs. Clarke & Co. are particularly well and favourahly known ; and their establish- ment is very largely patronised by leading metropolitan and provincial houses. In general stationery the firm are complete counting-house out- fitters, and in every branch of letterpress printing their name stands well to the fore for excellent work at moderate prices. The business of the house is especially well and energetically conducted ; a large and highly efficient staff is employed in all departments; and a most important wholesale trade is controlled, with connections rapidly being enhanced in value, extent, and influence in every quarter of the United Eingdom. Swann & Co., Packers, &c, 84, Milton Street, E.C. \u2014 In a trading community such as London, the business of packer and forward ing agent is a most important one. Amongst the oldest and best firms in this line may be mentioned Messrs. Swann & Co. The business was founded more than a quarter of a century ago, and is still carried on with remarkable vigour and discretion. The premises in the occu pation of Messrs. Swann & Co. include a commodious warehouse and spacious packing-rooms. Messrs. Swann & Co. undertake the packing and forwarding of every class of goods to any part of the world.

Smart, Black, & Co., and is extensively engaged in the manufacture of Swiss embroideries, ladies' and children's underclothing, baby linen, &c. The business was originally established about 1867, and for some considerable time occupied premises in Gresham Street, but during the last few years has been located in ex tensive warehouses, &c, at 32, London Wall. The building is fitted with all the requisite appliances and machinery for the branch of industry comprised in the business, and a large number of hands are employed in the various departments. Messrs. Smart, Black, & Co. are widely celebrated for the exceptionally superior workmanship displayed in the manufacture of Swiss embroideries and many varieties of white em broideries, &c. Many of the Swiss designs for this very elegant fabric are in imitation of various flowers, Sec, that grow on the lofty mountains of Switzerland and the neighbouring district, where the manufacture is carried on. In addition to the trade in embroideries, &c, the firm is widely known iu connection with the making of superior underclothing for ladies and children, and a very large staff is specially engaged in this depart ment. The business extends far aud wide among a large and influential connection that includes the principal retail firms in the United Kingdom. An export trade is also carried on, the reputation of the firm being well known. Under able and energetic management the business has been rapidly developed in every- branch, and the firm ranks among the leading commercial establishments of the City. Robert Wicks, Mantle Manufacturer, 35, Bread Street, Cheapside, E.C. \u2014 The production of mantles and cloaks in large quantities is a business requiring for its successful management the exercise of per haps more tact, skill, and practical knowledge than almost any other branch of manufacturing industry. Prominent among the houses so en gaged in this city is that of Mr. Kobert Wicks. This house was established by its present proprietor iu 1883, and despite a somewhat recent growth, has already succeeded in establishing most extensive trade relations with the leading wholesale mantle warehouses of London and the provinces. The premises occupied consist of spacious and commodious showroom, designing and cutting department, and offices, constant employment being afforded a large force of skilled operatives. The products of the house consist of every description of ladies' mantles, mantillas, cloaks, sacques, dolmans, and jackets, and the large and annually increasing trade of the bouse is ample evidence of the appreciation which has been accorded to the merits of the goods produced."], [139, "MODERN LONDON. 155 Nicholson Ss Wordley, General Drapers, 197, 199, 201, and 203, High Street, Camden Town, N\u2014 It is very difficult to find a more attractive or better appointed establishment in the north of London than the extensive emporium of Messrs. Nicholson & Wordley. In reviewing historically the trades and industries of the metropolis, a firm of such old standing and great reputation has special claims upon our consideration and attention. Beferring in the first place to the early history of this business, we find that it was founded over fifty years ago by the late Mr. Nicholson, and for some time was carried on as Messrs. Nicholson Se Hood ; subsequently Mr. Wordley, who is a son-in-law of Mr. Nicholson, succeeded to the business, and is now the managing pro prietor. The business premises are very extensive, well situated, and large and valuable connection existing with the Army. They are also importers of Havanna cigars, handling large quantities of prime goods in this line, among which are some of the finest brands that come into England. The great specialities of the house consist in the Prince of Wales Smoking Mixture, and the famous \" 'Varsity Tobaccos,\" two manu factures of pipe tobaccos of peculiarly delicate and agreeable flavour. The stocks held in bond and made up in the warehouse are very large and comprehensive, and the manufacturing operations in the factory call into requisition the services of a staff of between sixty and seventy competent hands. Messrs. Fryer Se Coultman, under the experienced guidance of the principal of the house, conduct their ever-growing business with an energy and enterprise that adequately keep pace with the increasing demands of a progressive industry. The reputation long established by the house for purity and all-round excellence of goods is consistently sustained, and year by year materially widened and enhanced. The home trade is extensive, whilst the export branch disseminates the various noted specialities of the firm over a far-reaching circuit of custom in the British colonies and dependencies. admirably adapted in every way to carry ing on the extensive operations of this firm to the best ad vantage ; the fa-jade of the house is at tractive and substan tial, and the splendid and artistically ar ranged display of goods at once arrests the attention of the purchasing public. The establishment is divided into several departments, each superintended by a competent manager Harris & Chambers, Tailors, 22, Princes Street, Caven dish Square, W. \u2014 Messrs. Harris Se Chambers have been established for more than thirty years. The business was first commenced in Duke Street, was afterwards removed to Market Street, and finally to its present location. The premises consist of a well-fitted shop, with a large cut ting-room, &c. Mr. J. G. Chambers, the sole principal and owner of the firm, has been in it twenty-eight years, and is a man of great experience in the trade. He personally superintends the business, assisted by an efficient staff. Their trade largely consists of naval and military work, .and they have a large Indian and Colonial connection. The business done is with the higher classes of society, and is carried on in all parts of the globe. The firm has a first-class reputatiou, and is well known in the trade. having a special knowledge of the goods under his charge. The drapery business is here conducted most systematically. In the practical dress and mantle making department are large and airy workrooms, where a permanent staff of trained needlewomen, under the direction of competent modistes of taste and experience, is constantly employed. Every labour saving appliance is in use. Messrs. Nicholson & Wordley have instituted a thoroughly-organised system, by which they are enabled to produce the largest amount of highly-finished work at the smallest possible cost. In the other departments are to be found a really splendid stock of dresses, silks, drapery, washing fabrics, fancy drapery, underclothing and baby linen, millinery, mourning, &c. The models of French hats and bonnets displayed by Messrs. Nicholson & Wordley have commanded great admi ration, being \" replicas \" of the prettiest French and English novelties, at about one quarter the usual cost of Paris bonnets and hats. There are few men better known or more highly respected in London than the spirited proprietor of this extensive business, whose untiring energy, well known integrity, and rightly-directed enterprise have been rewarded with the possession of one of the largest and most influential businesses in the north of London. The Decorative Co-Operators' Association, Limited, 405, Oxford Street, W. \u2014 In 1883 was founded the Decorative Co-Operators' Association, Limited, its inception having been suggested by tbe notable Buccess that has attended the career of the \" Maison Leclaire\" in Paris. This old-established firm, developed by the great \" captain of industry \" whose name it bears, now affords employment to ],2o0 workmen, and devotes 75 per cent, of its net profits to these employees, so that since 1842 the aggregate sum thus apportioned in the form of a yearly bonus to the workers, and annuities to the aged, now reaches the considerable sum of over 170,000/. Upon the general lines of this worthy prototype the London association was founded by a few social reformers. Begistered as a joint stock company on the lines of a profit sharing industrial partnership, it is conducted upon the principles of co-operation in its best and truest spirit, i.e., the spirit in which the respective interests of capital and labour are duly considered interests, which in strict justice ought never to be disassociated, and which in the near future must claim universal recognition. The variety of trades combined in the business of a first-class house decorator offered a further stimulus to these pioneers to apply the principles of co-operation in the interest of such skilled artizans as would make it a point of honour conscientiously to carry out tbe object of the association, and, by the excellent quality of their work, reflect credit on the character of British workmen. At the premises of the institution in Oxford Street, orders are taken for the execution of first-class work in every department, such as house painting and decoration, upholstery, plumbing, sanitation, furniture to design or order, electric lighting, gas fitting, Sec, Sec, under the superintendence of a competent manager ; while the services and advice of an architect and surveyor of acknowledged standing are at the command of the clients. On the ground floor of the building is located the shop and showroom, tastefully decorated, well appointed in every respect, and containing a most attractive assortment of both rich and inexpensive materials, suitable for curtains and upholstery of every description, wall papers in great variety, samples of furniture &c. ; this branch of the business being under the superintendence of a woman, f.whose natural taste, developed by sympathetic surroundings, renders her a valuable assistance to purchasers. The list of directors includes the well-known name of the chairman, Mr. Albert Grey, Mr. Cameron Corbett, M.P. (of Glasgow), and Mr. H. B. Graham ; and the secretarial duties of the association are ably and energetically discharged by Miss Mary H. Hart, a lady who has devoted much time and attention to the consideration of the vexed economic problem, the solution of which is so praiseworthily attempted by this institution. Miss Hart is the author of \" Papers on the Beconciliation of Capital and Labour,\" in which she gives evidence of profound research into the details of an all important industrial subject, as well as much effective originality of idea in the promulgation of remedial measures. The Decorative Co-Operators' Association, Limited, has essayed the commencement of a great and laudable work ; and, with a firm basis of reciprocal justice as its operative foundation, it ought not to fall short of the public recognition and appre ciation and eventual success which it so justly merits, and which it is already beginning to attain and enjoy. Fryer & Coultman, Tobacco Manufacturers, 2 and 3, West Smithfield, E.C. \u2014 For more than half a century the eminent firm now trading under the style and title of Messrs. Fryer & Coultman has occupied a post of much prominence and distinction in connection with the tobacco manufacturing industry of London. This well-known house was established in 1836 by Mr. William Fryer ; but prior to his accession to the control of the industry the place had been noted in the neighbourhood as a to bacco factory for over thirty years. Mr. William Fryer did much, however, to con solidate the trade and expand the resources of the house, and upon his death, in 1861, his nephew, Mr. Christopher Fryer, the present sole pro prietor, succeeded to the busi ness. Mr. Christopher Fryer was subsequently joined in partnership by Mr. Coultman. The present title was then adopted, and rapid progress was made under the new directorate. Mr. Coultman died in 1882, and since then the sole control of the busi* ness has devolved once more upon Mr. Christopher Fryer. The firm have occupied their present large and commodious premises in West Smithfield for many years. These comprise a fine lofty building, of massive and extensive proportions, and equipped throughout with the most highly improved modern machinery. Messrs. Fryer & Coultman import and manufacture all classes of smoking tobaccos, cigars, snuff, and roll tobacco ; in the last-named item a very"], [140, "156 MODERN LONDON.

In addition to the immense trade done with the general public, Mr. Fox has a first-class connection amongst the leading hotels, restaurants, and wholesale establishments.

There are few men better known or more highly respected than the pro prietor of this extensive establishment. By his capacity, genial courtesy, aud well-directed energy and enterprise, and by his well-known integrity in all transactions, he has gained the esteem and confidence of a very extensive and valuable connection. Louis Fh. Falck, Manufacturers' Agent for Dolls, Toys, Cblna, Glass, Baskets, Cabinet Goods, Albums, Frames and Fancy Goods, also Rustic Baskets ln Wood, 5, South Street, Finsbury, E.C. \u2014 Manufacturers' agents are, in London, a numerous and influential commercial body. A promiment place in their ranks is held by Mr. Louis P. Falck. This gentleman's business was started by Mr. Falck just a quarter of a century ago. Suitable and spacious premises are occupied at the above address. They contain a large assortment of samples of goods, the productions of the first firms in Germany, France, and America. Mr. Falck probably represents more manufacturers of toys and fancy wares than any other man in the metropolis. Among the important firms that entrust their interests to his care are Ernest Axthelm, Neustadt, Coburg ; V. A. Grundmann, Olbernhau, Saxony, for arks, bricks, and wood toys ; C. F. Eckhardt, Nurnberg, Paris, and Vienna, for general fancy goods and toys; H. Kerling, Michelau, Bavaria, for fancy baskets; F. W. Ereitag, Ohrdruff, Gotha, skin toy and rocking horse manufacturer; C. Kuhnert & Son, Lauscha, Coburg, for glass toys, beads, and similar goods.

The samples on hand are of the most diverse kind, and such as to interest net only the juvenile but the adult portion of the population. A widespread connection has been formed all over the country with the best class of wholesale houses and shippers. The establishment is well managed, and is held in high repute among those requiring the goods it supplies. Mr. Falck is an able man of business, and is much respected. S. S. Wools, \" Champion Cutter,\" 111, 112, and 142, Shoreditch, E.C. \u2014 The busy and prosperous neighbourhood of Hign Street, Shoreditch, is well known as counting among its numerous high class tradesmen some of the best tailors and clothiers in London, and prominently among them is the well-known clothing establishment of Mr. S. S. Wools, the \"Champion Cutter.\" This business has been established now some seven years, and under the same title it has already taken rank among the most noted tailoring establishments of East London. The operations of the house are conducted on a very extensive scale, and embrace the making and sale of all sorts of clothing. Tha leading feature of the business is the bespoke department, which is most liberally patronised. In the \" cutting \" department the proprietor justly claims precedence over rival houses, and judging from the large cumber of his patrons whose garments bespeak the acme of fashion and style and fit, no doubt can exist as to his complete success. The stocks held are very large, and comprise a choice assortment of the best goods of ihe day, including West of England broadcloths, meltons, tweeds, checks, stripes, mixtures, diagonals, serges, alpacas, silks, fancy goods for vests, over coatings, tourists' suits, dust and race coats, bicycle suits, &c. The prices are most moderate in comparison with other tailors, and the style, quality, and workmanship. The principal is well known as a thoroughly prac tical man in his department of trade, of strict integrity, and very widely respected. J. H. Lamb & Co., Pianoforte Action Makers, 9, Hart land Boad, Eentish Town, N.W. \u2014 The extensive and rapid development assumed by the pianoforte trade of the metropolis of late years provides a most valuable and profitable field for the pianoforte action makers to pursue their calling. In this connection favourable mention may be made of a reliable and prominent concern like that carried on under the style of J. H. Lamb & Co. at the above location. This business was established in 1877, but it was not till 1880 that it came into the hands of the present proprietors. Tbe concern has long held a most prominent position in its particular line, and in the hands of the present firm is allowed to rank among the leading establishments of the kingdom. The character and superiority of their manufactures have obtained tbe highest recognition, and their resources are drawn upon by the best pianoforte makers in the kingdom. While they have attained a high degree of celebrity in the metropolis, they have also commanded for their productions universal appreciation all over the kingdom. Their name has become a household word in connection with action making, and their present activity augurs well for further prominence and development. The machinery used is of the latest aud most improved pattern, and in every respect the establish ment is a perfect model of completeness, presenting all the features of sound and judicious management. A large staff is employed. Mr. Lamb is much respected, and this valuable and popular house cannot, in his hands, fail to maintain the popularity it has so long enjoyed. Richard Mills, Fishmonger, Poulterer, and Licensed Sealer in Game, 19, Liverpool Street, City, and at 30, Shore ditch, E.C. \u2014 On coming out of the Great Eastern Bailway Terminus in Liverpool Street, City, the first object that meets the eye is the handsome establishment, with its thirty feet of open frontage, of Eichard Mills, fish monger, poulterer, and licensed dealer in game, which has been in existence for twenty-two years. The extensive supplies which the proprietor receives daily of the three table necessaries of which his trade consists, and which he immediately displays in an attractive manner, cannot fail to impress the public with a sense of the important trade which he does. Everything which is in season, in game, fish, or poultry, makes its appearance in its primest condition in this admirably regulated establishment, and as chance buyers are attracted by the fresh and healthy appearance these edibles present, so are the regular customers willingly placing their orders with Mr. Mills on account of the perfect condition of everything which is shown to them and the unfailing attention their orders receive. In addition to this flourishing concern, the proprietor is in the possession of an important business at 30, Shoreditch, which is only second in its ex tent to that which is conducted at head-quarters. Both establishments are of a decidedly superior description, and the connection of a valuable and widespreading nature. The whole concern is under the personal super vision of its energetic proprietor, who possesses a thorough knowledge of the business. His invariable courtesy to all customers has obtained for Mr. Mills a business of such great importance, and has made his establishment one of the most thriving concerns in the City. Madame Monchablon, Type-Writer Copyist, 26, Austin Friars, Old Broad Street, E.C. \u2014 A useful and deservedly successful busi ness is that conducted by Madame Monchablon, type-writer copyist, which has been established twelve years. At the commencement of the business the operations were confined to the work of one, then three, copying machines, and it was not till six years ago that the public type writing office was opened. The work has so largely increased that at the present day a considerable number of machines are permanently en gaged in the execution of the valuable orders daily received. Madame Monchablon instructs a large staff of female copyists and stenographers in the various branches necessary. Copying for lawyers, authors, and merchants is undertaken, and orders of considerable value are received from various parts of London, the country, and abroad. Madame Mon chablon is herself a remarkably rapid copyist, and possesses enterprising ability, combined with the frank courtesy of a Parisienne, which has obtained for her the enjoyment of a flourishing business and the esteem of a wide circle of patrons. W. J. Calloway, Tailor and Outfitter, 85, Great Tower Street. E.C.\u2014 In the wide range of London businesses there is not one that is conducted with greater energy or ability than tailoring. In con nection with this branch of trade it would be difficult to find a more repre sentative establishment than that conducted by Mr. W. J. Calloway. This business has no long record to boast of, but any disadvantage accruing from this is amply atoned for by the ability, energy, and perseverance of its able proprietor, Mr. Calloway. This gentleman has been very fortunate in securing an excellent site for his business, and his premises are fitted up in a neat and substantial manner. He is a first-class tradesman in the cutting and every other department, and employs only the most skilled and experienced hands. This fact is the best guarantee that can be given for the excellence in cut, fit, and finish of every garment made on the premises, and all the clothes made by Mr. Calloway are noted for each of these points of excellence. He is well patronised by many of the leading City men and others in and around the immediate vicinity of the house. The proprietor is a genial and reliable tradesman, and very popular with his numerous influential customers. Harmer Ss Focock, Shell Fish Merchants, 17, St. Mary at-Hill, Billingsgate, E.C. \u2014 Among the principal firms in the neighbour hood of Billingsgate a very prominent position is taken by that of Messrs. Harmer & Pocock. Both partners were in business separately for many years, and each gained a very widespread connection. Becently they resolved to combine the two businesses. This has proved very successful, and the firm are rapidly extending their trade. The leading features of the business are the sale of shell fish and oysters. The firm supply most of the leading high-clnss houses in the West-end, Sec Shrimps are also a very important feature, in which the firm command a large trade. The proprietors also deal largely in all the varieties of shell fish. They are also extensively engaged as wholesale fish merchants in all other branches, and have a very widespread connection. The firm's trade is chiefly con fined to the metropolitan district, but goods are also sent to inland towns in the neighbourhood of London. A first-class connection is maintained among the principal retail dealers, with whom the firm are extremely popular. The business is very ably and energetically conducted, and the firm is one of the foremost in the market."], [141, "157 MODERN LONDON. W. Beckett, Undertaker, 70, Junction Road, Holloway, N., and 10, Brecknock Boad, Camden Boad, N.\u2014 The vast and enormous development of the population of the metropolis, and the necessarily large mortality, render the funeral undertaking a most valuable branch of business. Among the many houses engaged in this calling in the north metropolitan districts, there is not one that has attained a higher degree of popularity than that carried on by Mr. William Beckett, whose premises are eligibly situated at 70, Junction Boad, Holloway. This well-known concern dates its origin from 1856, when it was cessful issue. Mr. Watt is much respected among commercial men of all classes in the City, and his integrity and conscientiousness are beyond reproach. W. G. Fernley & Co., Letter Manufacturers, and Sign and Notice Board Makers and Contractors, Writers and Decorators, 9, Jewry Street, Fenchurch Street, E.C. \u2014 The almost in calculable number of houses \u2014 a number, too, continually on the increase \u2014 in London affords a fine field for the operations of the sign-writer and general decorator. In this connection a house that is eminently worthy of special mention is that conducted by Messrs. W. G. Fernley & Co. This well-known establishment was founded over half a century ago. The premises occupied are of ample extent, well fitted, and laid out in artistic fashion. Signs are written in any style ; notice boards are made and erected ; designing, gilding, illuminating, wood and marble imitations are executed in the most artistic manner ; wood and glass letters are promptly made and fixed ; brass plates are engraved ; and coats of arms are made to order. These are only a few of the operations engaged in, which embrace everything from simple sign writing to the complete interior and exterior decoration of a cottage or a castle. The partners are men of energy and ability, treat their customers with great liberality, and are much esteemed in general, and especially in trade circles. W. Healing, Linen Draper, Haberdasher, Hosier, Glover, &.C., 171 and 173, New North Boad, N. \u2014 The linen drapery, haberdashery, hosiery, glove, and lace trade of London is of immense importance. A noted house in the trade is that of Mr. W. Healing, which was founded twenty-five years ago, and has been in the present ownership three or four years. The shops are large, of attractive appear ance, and they are fitted up in a most superior manner. The stock is large, and consists of drapery of all kinds, haberdashery, hosiery and millinery, bonnets, hats, shawls, mantles, children's costumes in the latest and most fashionable styles, and other goods. Gents' shirts refitted. This establishment is the largest in the New North Boad, and the stock, for quality, could not be surpassed. Mr. W. Healing carries on a very extensive trade, and an ample staff is employed. Mr. W. Healing thoroughly understands his business, and he is well known and highly respected by the members of the trade. The community also esteem him for his strict integrity, and show their appreciation by patronising and recommending his establishment. Carriage Depot and Stables. founded by the father of the present proprietor. The business could not have succeeded to a more worthy or capable gentleman than the present proprietor. The popularity and reputation handed down to him by his father have been steadily maintained. The resources are of a superior character, and it cannot be wondered that the house is patronised by such an influential and thoroughly high-class connection. Mr. Beckett has upwards of a dozen Belgian horses, as well as a number of the most modern equipages, and no establishment in this line can give fuller satisfaction in every department of its operations. The premises are of moderate dimensions, exhibiting all the traces of modern construc tion, and the fittings are of a superb character, and harmonise admirably with the nature of the business. The proprietor is a gentleman of long experience, acquired under the supervision of his father, and no one can envy him the success he has attained. James Keen, Pure Bedding Manufacturer and House Furnisber, 226, Pentonville Boad, Eing's Cross, N. \u2014 King's Cross is widely known as the head-quarters of the bedding and bed manufacture of the metropolis. In this connection an important establishment is that conducted by Mr. James Keen. This noted house was established in 1875, and has sufficed to secure for it one of the most influential connec tions enjoyed by any similar house in the metropolis. The spacious premises in which the business is conducted are of imposing appearance, and are in all respects well adapted to the business. The manufacturing section is replete with everything that can save or simplify labour or add to the perfection of the work done. Beds of the most substantial, elegant, and novel designs are made in great numbers, and quickly sold to the firm's connections in all parts of the metropolis. Pure bedding is a special feature of the establishment. The Universal Carriage Chair for the nursery is an invention of Mr. Keen's, and its utility and excellence cannot be over-estimated. It can be used in six positions \u2014 as a table chair, low chair, low carriage chair, low chair and play table, play table, and go-cart, and for the use and enjoyment of infants is widely appreciated. Mr. Keen conducts his business with ability and enterprise and the strictest regard for probity and honourable principles. His reputation, therefore, stands high among his many customers. T. L. C. Watt, Partnership Negotiator, Business Transfer and Estate Agent, 66a, Paternoster Bow, E.C. \u2014 Mr. Watt is the best-known man in his important branch of business, not only in the metropolis itself, but in any part of the country. He began his operations over thirty years ago in the street in which he still conducts his business. The premises occupied are of suitable dimensions, and are neatly fitted and suitably arranged. Anyone looking at the London daily papers will see at a glance the importance of such a medium as Mr. Watt. Every transaction in connection with partnership negotiating and business or estate agency work of any kind whatever are undertaken and carried through with the greatest despatch, if such be at all possible. It is com- puted that there are about 20,000 advertisements for partnerships and financial assistance appearing annually- in the London papers. A con- sideration of this fact shows the wide field there is for the operations of the financial agent, or the man who brings the capitalist and the party requiring cash into contact with each other. This is a function which demands a large share of patience, tact, and ability, in all of which qualifications Mr. Watt is singularly gifted. Indeed, in this respect no better proof need be required than the position he holds among those who devote themselves to the same branch of business. He is certainly the lead- ing partnership negotiator in England, and if there should be any doubt on this point, a list of the concerns he has financed and the partnerships lie has arranged (which may be had free on application) will at once con- vince the most incredulous of his success. Estate and business transfer agency work is also undertaken and done in a prompt, effective, and eco- nomical manner. Some of his recent transactions include the finding of directors for public companies, financing slate quarries in North Wales and Cornwall, and introducing capital to paper mills. At present he is engaged on business for clients in San Francisco and Florida. Indeed, there is not a quarter of the globe in which Mr. Watt is not known. His commission is strictly moderate, and always arranged in accordance with the facility or difficulty encountered in carrying each transaction to a sue- C.

Lamm, carver. This business was established twenty years ago, and has been conducted in the present spacious and well-equipped premises for the past twelve years. Mr. Lamm has steadily increased his business, which has prospered owing to the uniform excellence of his goods and the enterprising manner in which it has always been conducted. The showrooms contain a large and valuable collection of oil paintings, engravings, oleographs, &c, also picture frames and mouldings of the most artistic and elegant description. The manufacturing department is equipped with the most improved ap pliances, and a staff of skilled workmen is constantly employed. Mr. Lamm has executed gilding and decorative work at the Boyal Academy, Grosvenor Gallery, Dore Gallery, Colonial Exhibition, American Exhi bition, &c. He has also done a large amount of work in the leading hotels of London, and he has a widespread and high-class patronage in all parts of the United Kingdom. Mr. Lamm is well known and highly esteemed for his enterprise and sterling business capacity."], [142, "158 MODERN LONDON. TJrch & Co., Wholesale and Retail Saddle and Har ness Manufacturers, 84, Long Acre, W.C. \u2014 Among the great in dustries of the metropolis the saddle and harness trade stands prominently to the fore, and no house better represents this particular branch of industry than that of Messrs. Urch Se Co., of the foregoing address. Established in the year 1835, Messrs. Urch & Co. entered upon their commercial career with only a small monetary capital, but a great amount of ability, which, being coupled with a determination to succeed, soon brought about them such a number of clients that within a very short period after their establishment it was found necessary to extend the premises and enlarge the staff. At the commencement of the business the trade consisted of supplying private gentlemen with saddlery, har ness, and horse clothing. This private trade had continued for some years when the firm decided to strike out in a new path in the direction of Government contracts, and accordingly they sent in tenders for the supply of harness and saddlery for the use of the British army. In this step the firm's efforts were successful, and shortly after gaining these contracts they were appointed saddle makers to Boyalty, as well as to H. H. the commensurately important transactions in coffee, sugar, and fruits, the firm enjoying in this respect an old-established and valuable connection among the large retail grocers of the kingdom. A trade of proportionate magnitude is controlled in packet teas, a leading speciality in this line being the firm's Deccoya Ceylon Tea, which enjoys a splendid reputation for purity and quality. Messrs. Duchesne & Bennett conduct their long founded and successful business with due regard to the consistent main tenance of the excellent repute in which their house has at all times been held, and no effort is spared to fully* merit the esteem and confidence of their customers, which they have so long and so worthily retained. R. & J. Hewetson, Corn Factors, 1, Catherine Court, E.C. \u2014 One of the oldest-established houses in the City in connection with the corn trade is that of Messrs. Bobt. & Jno. Hewetson, of 1, Catherine Court, E.C., which offices the firm have occupied since the first com mencement of the business, considerably more than a century ago. Very few houses can date as far back as can this firm, their names in 1760 being the oldest on the books of the Corn Market. There is an entry in the books of the Corn Exchange, dated the 24th July 1769, in which a Mr. John Hewetson applies to the directors for a renewal of the lease of his stand in the market. The firm was founded under the present title, and is now carried on by lineal descendants of the original founders. Another interesting fact in connection with this celebrated house is the existence at the present time of copies of their circulars sent out to the trade, dated 1817. By way of contrast with the many newly-sprung-up firms of little or no repute, it is indeed a pleasure to make mention of such an old-standing and honourable firm as Messrs. E. & J. Hewetson. Their business is a very extensive one, and they hold large and influential con nections with important houses in the trade, but their special feature of commerce is oil cake, to which particular branch they have given great attention, and in which they transact a large business. In addition to their convenient premises in Catherine Court, a stand is held on the Corn Exchange, where the principal part of their business transactions in buying and selling on commission are carried on. The superior quality and high excellence of all their goods have secured for them the confidence of a very extensive circle, and the generally efficient manner in which all their operations are conducted has gained a well-earned reputation. Viceroy of Egypt. The increased trade now demanded a still further enlargement of premises, and the firm then entered into possession of their present premises, which comprise a handsome three-storied corner building, with a fine frontage to Long Acre of 60 feet. The front portion of the establishment is utilised as show and stock rooms, whilst the rear portion, consisting of two large factories, is devoted exclusively to manu facturing those equine equipments for which Messrs. Urch & Co. have gained a world-wide renown. The firm, ever to the front in the way of novelty, has just patented a new double spring bar. By this ingenious patent all possibility of a rider being dragged along the ground is done away with. If a rider should happen to fall the stirrup leather imme diately releases itself from the saddle. An interesting incident connected with the history of this firm took place in the year 1870, at the time of the Franco-German War. Messrs. Urch & Co. received a special order from the French Government for the supply of saddlery and harness, one condition of the order being that the whole of the work should be exe cuted in three months' time. Messrs. Urch & Co. were quite equal to the occasion. They immediately set to work, increased their staff to the extent of 500, worked day and night, and within the specified time com pleted the contract to the entire satisfaction of the French Government. To show how varied are the demands made upon their resources, another instance is given of the firm being recently entrusted with a special order by Mr. Edwardes, of the Gaiety Theatre, in connection with that popular burlesque \" Frankenstein,\" in one seene of which Miss Nellie Farren drives a live horse drawing a sleigh on to the stage. The harness with which the horse was equipped is unique in design, and is made upon the Bussian principle, being the first of its kind ever manufactured in this country. It is beautifully crested, and though only six bells are attached to the bridle, they ring loudly and clearly enough for fifty. Iu addition to Messrs. Urch & Co.'s private trade, they also conduct a large wholesale and export trade, and are continually sending out large consignments of their own manufactures to every quarter of the globe. The stocks made up and kept in reserve are sufficient to meet almost any emergency, so that shippers and the trade can be supplied at a few hours' notice. A visit to this celebrated harness and saddlery emporium is well repaid by the un surpassed display of goods, the quality and elegance of which have materially assisted to place the name of Messrs. Urch & Co. at the very head of the trade. James A. Jacobs & Co., Wholesale Manufacturers of \u25a0Leather Travelling and Carpet Bags, 12, Chapel Street, Milton Street, E.C. \u2014 Among the numerous trades, industries, and manufactures which contribute so materially to the commercial prosperity of the metropolis and the daily employment of its industrial community, the extensive establishment of Messrs. James A. Jacobs & Co. has for many years occupied a very prominent position. This firm is extensively engaged in the wholesale manufacture of leather travelling and carpet bags, boys' satchels, and general leather goods. The business is carried on in extensive premises, well situated and admirably adapted to the trade. Messrs. Jacobs & Co. manufacture their goods in immense quan tities, both for the wholesale trade and for export, and have introduced into their construction many very valuable and original improvements. In the factory a large staff of skilled and experienced workmen are constantly employed, and the showrooms contain many sine specimens of this firm's manufacture. The whole establishment is admirably arranged into separate departments, each having a competent foreman specially skilled in the manufacture of his appointed class of goods. The business in every department is conducted with great ability, energy, and enterprise, and is thoroughly representative of this important industry. Messrs. Jacobs & Co. hold a very large stock of goods of their own manufacture, of superior quality and excellent workmanship. They are also manufac turers of bag frames, Sec., having a factory in St. Luke's, where the process of lock and frame making, stamping, pressing, polishing, and nickel-plating all kinds of metal, is earned on. This firm has a first-class connection amongst the principal wholesale dealers all over the United Kingdom, and also do a steady and rapidly-increasing export business. Stebbing & Co., Importers and Agents, 6, Martin's Lane, Cannon Street, E.C.\u2014 This eminent firm was established in 1843 by Mr. Thomas Stebbing, who in the course of time introduced his sons\u2014 Percival and Alfred\u2014 into the concern. Trading from the commence ment as importers and agents of foreign comestibles, they have developed into oue of the largest importers of sardines in this country. This im portant trade, which had its origin about the year 1850, has now attained enormous proportions. The total importation for 1887 reached the un precedented figure of forty million tins. Messrs. Stebbing & Co. obtain their supplies from leading houses of France, Portugal, and Spain, and the extensive nature of their consignments exercises considerable influence on the London market. Due prominence must be given to their trade in other foreign comestibles. These include petit pois, macaroni, vermicelli, French plums and prunes, Canadian canned lobsters, and preserved pine apples from Singapore, in addition to which are Achiardis olive oil and Gorgona anchovies, and Sorel's colza oil. In all these Messrs Stebbing & Co.'s operations are very extensive. They supply the leading whole sale grocers and provision merchants in London, and also sell largely to shipping firms, by whom their goods are distributed to nearly all the British Colonies, as well as to India, China, and various parts of America. Duchesne Ss Bennett, Wholesale Teas, Coffees, Sugars, &.c, 16, Bury Street, St. Mary Axe, E.C. \u2014 Upwards of a century ago was founded the well-known firm of wholesale dealers in tea, coffee, sugar, and fruit, now trading under the style of Messrs. Duchesne Se Bennett. The original title of this notable house was Dowler & Dockerill, and as the latter of these two names has been associated with the firm until quite recently, it is probable that the style and title of Dockerill, Duchesne, & Bennett is the one most familiar to the trade. Messrs. Duchesne & Bennett occupy very large and commodious premises, in which they hold a most extensive stock of staple groceries of all descriptions, chief among which are important lines of tea, coffee, sugar, spice, and dried fruits. A very large trade in \" bulk \" teas is carried on, in conjunction with"], [143, "MODERN LONDON. 159 Henry Webster, Manufacturer of Perambulators, Mangles, and Sewing Machines, 442 and 444, Harrow Boad, W. \u2014 An attractive and prominent feature in the array of emporia that adorns Harrow Boad is the well-known establishment conducted by Mr, Henry Webster, which was founded some ten years ago. The premises are extensive, and comprise spacious showrooms on the ground floor, the two upper stories and basements being also utilised, while in the rear is a spacious and well-appointed factory. The stock held is of a large and comprehensive character, comprising sewing machines, perambulators, and washing, wringing, and mangling machines. The most prominent of these machines are the \" Standard \" or \" New Home,\" which has no equal, being almost noiseless, and rarely getting out of order. In perambulators the variety is equally charming, every vehicle bearing indelible traits of superior workmanship. A very noticeable feature is the \" Gordon \" Bassinette, which has had an immense sale. The \" Imperial Woodenette \" also claims a large share of public attention, being a very pretty carriage, and deservedly placed among the best and highest class in the market. The \" Model,\" \" Queen,\" and \" Webster \" Washers are machines of undoubted utility and usefulness. The quotations in every instance are remarkable for their fairness, taking into consideration the fact that no common or inferior materials are used, even in the cheapest articles. This is the largest establishment in the kingdom for perambulator and sewing machine repairs. The goods are supplied at reduced prices for cash, or on the hire-purchase system. The stocks are kept in the best con dition, and well arranged. The house has over twenty branches in various parts of the metropolis, the business being personally conducted by the proprietor with great energy and ability. The trade is very extensive, and for the most part confined to London and the suburbs, among the upper and middle classes of society. The proprietor is well known as a gentleman of high commercial status, and practically acquainted with all branches ofthe business. W. Hadden, Refreshment Contractor, 106, Tottenham Court Boad, and Gower Street, W.C. \u2014 Prominent among the leading and most noted refreshment contractors of the metropolis is Mr. W. Hadden. This business was originally established about sixty-six years ago, and from its very inception, being conducted on enterprising and honourable lines, it has steadily prospered. The premises occupied are of spacious dimensions, admirably arranged, and equipped with every trade requisite. Employment is given to a large staff of skilled assistants.

Cleaver, Tailor, 157, Ebury Street, Eaton Square, S.W.\u2014 This business was acquired about fourteen years ago by the present proprietor, who has been very successful in getting together a very large connection. It had been established fifteen years previously. The premises consist of a shop, well fitted, and workrooms, where a very efficient staff of specially selected workmen are engaged. The trade is very extensive, and the firm has always been widely noted for its excel lence of workmanship and superior material, a large stock of which is held. The success of this business is the result of exceptional ability and first-class management, and Mr. Cleaver's connection is continually increasing. Nettleton & Co., Furnishing Ironmongers, 4a, Sloane Square, S.W. \u2014 Messrs. Nettleton & Co. were established in 1810. The premises they occupy comprise a large corner shop divided into store- rooms, workshops, &c, all of which <sj&> are fitted in the most approved style.

The Thomson & Son, Silversmiths, Jewellers, and Fawn brokers, 36 and 37, Chalk Farm Eoad, N.W. \u2014 Pawnbroking has long held a prominent place in the commercial activity of the metropolis. The well-known house of Messrs. Thomson & Son may be ranked among the leading concerns of this kind in Great Britain. Established in 1837, and carrying on a select business, the stability of the firm can stand favourable comparison with that of any similar enterprise in the metropolis. The operations of the establishment are of a singularly varied character, while special attention is given to the pawnbroking department. As silversmiths and jewellers their stock is of a superior character, and some of the best and most influential families in the neighbourhood patronise the establishment. For pottery, cutlery, and china goods their resources are no less remarkable ; and as cigar merchants their operations have attained a high degree of popularity. The premises are of large dimensions, and the fittings and general appointments are of an elaborate description. Valuables are stored away in a special fire-proof strong room, so that customers may entertain no doubt of the safety of their goods. Mr. Thomson has had long practical experience in this particular fine, and no man more highly deserves the success he has attained. business done extends over a consider able variety of trades, and includes gas fitting, bell -hanging, bronzing, repairing brass and tin work, &c, in addition to the ordinary branches of blacksmiths', locksmiths', and housesmiths' work. A special feature consists in the manufac ture of kitchen ranges and stoves, in which department Messrs. Nettleton & Co. have always maintained a very high reputation. A speciality of Messrs. Net tleton & Co. is their patent closed stove, patronised by Her Majesty's Govern ment, for whom upwards of 4,000 have been supplied to the various depart ments. A numerous staff is engaged, consisting chiefly of first-class workmen in the various trades incidental to the business of the firm. A very large trade is done among all classes, and the busi ness is managed in an exceptionally able and energetic manner. The success at tained by this firm has been in every Abrahams' Stores \u2014China, Glass, Lamps, Cutlery, Turnery, and Household Ironmongery, 104, Westbourne Grove, W. \u2014 Continuous success is the real test of the reliability of all business houses. This has been the well-deserved fortune of that popular establish ment known as \"Abrahams' Stores.\" This business was founded six years ago by Mr. J. Abrahams, who does the largest business in his line in this district. The premises are veiy spacious and fitted up in handsome style. The interior is stocked with every description of China, glass, lamps, cutlery, electro- plate, brushes, turnery, and household ironmongery. Mr. Abrahams does both a wholesale and retail trade. He also has a wide spread and high-class patronage in all parts of the country and abroad.

Seward Bros., Family Grocers, Ssc, Wine and Spirit Merchants, 14 and 16, Westbourne Grove, W. \u2014 The house of Messrs. Seward Bros., family grocers, wine and spirit merchants, &c, was founded twenty years ago. The premises devoted by this firm to the purposes of its extensive business are commodious, with excellent warehousing accommodation at the rear. The window display is attractive, and never fails to secure admiring attention. The interior of the principal shop is stocked with the best family groceries, oilmen's and Italian warehouse men's sundries, fine classes of domestic provisions and foreign comestibles, wines, spirits, liqueurs, and bottled beers.

A superior connection is carefully main tained among the most desirable circles of town and country patronage. Leslie & Knight, Estate Agents, Builders, and Contractors, &.C., 31, St. Mary Abbott's Terrace, Kensington, W. \u2014 Messrs. Leslie & Knight have been established about four years, and have very rapidly gained an extensive and high-class connection among the best classes in the neighbourhood. The premises occupied are large, and the offices, &c. are well fitted and arranged. A great feature of the business consists in the large amount of work done in building and decorating, branches in which the firm have attained great celebrity and widespread reputation. A large staff is kept in this department, the workmen being specially chosen from the most skilful in the trade. The business is admirably managed in every respect, the success achieved by this important firm being well merited and deserved."], [144, "MODERN LONDON. 160 Fraenkel Bros., The Universal Tobacconists' Pro viders \u2014 Wholesale, Retail, and Export, 82, Houndsditch, E.C. \u2014 and some closed. The premises occupied are large and commodious, and well fitted up to meet the special requirements of the business, and the general appearance is most attractive and substantial, which is improved by the corner situation. Mr. Charles Sharman conducts funerals in an economical manner, to suit all classes. Many letters from M.P.'s, clergy men, and others, will abundantly- prove that during his long career Mr. Charles Sharman has always succeeded in giving every satisfaction. His extensive business necessitates the employment of a large staff, and he has an establishment at 36, St. Ann's Boad, Stamford Hill, besides others elsewhere, the management throughout being able and energetic. Mr. Charles Sharman is well known in the trade, and he is very popular with the community at large. There are very few firms that are so generally well known among tobacco nists as Messrs. Fraenkel Bros. They may be said to supply absolutely everything necessary to be sold in a tobacconist's establishment cheaper than any other firm in the trade. Consequently Messrs. Fraenkel Bros. have been very appropriately named the Universal Tobacconist Providers. Houndsditch has of late years become considerably identified with this trade, and among the leading firms therein engaged Messrs. Fraenkel's is most decidedly one ofthe very first. Messrs. Fraenkel are really manufac turers of a very large proportion of their fancy goods, and have factories at Paris, Vienna, and St. Claude, from whence they supply their London market. Again, they are also manufacturers of cigars and cigarettes. They are also sole agents for the largest cigar manufacturers in Belgium, namely, Hoebeke Freres, Powels, & Co. They have introduced a cigar called the \" Capital,\" and a capital 2d. cigar it is \u2014 certainly, at the price, it is unsurpassed by any in the market. Messrs. Fraenkel's premises comprise a spacious building, heavily stocked with all kinds of cigars and cigarettes, meerschaum pipes, briar pipes, cigar-tubes, tobacco pouches, clay pipes, and, in fact, all articles requisite in a small shop or a first-class West-end establishment. Messrs. Fraenkel command an immense trade in every branch of their business, and one department that must not be omitted is the trade in foreign cigars, of which the firm import the choicest brands. They are recognised to be the cheapest house in the trade. The business is very ably conducted by Mr. George Fraenkel, who can well advise new beginners how to open a tobacconist's shop, and how to make it pay. F. W. Mackinney, Watch and Clock Maker, Jeweller, and Optician, 156, High Street, Notting Hill, W., and of 263, Liver pool Boad, Islington. \u2014 Prominent among the watch and clock making and jewellery establishments of the metropolis appears the well-known house of Mr. F. W. Mackinney, which was founded in Islington in 1846 by the father of tbe present proprietor, and in Notting Hill by himself in 1862. The high reputation obtained by the father it is the pride of the son to maintain and extend. The premises occupied consist of a centrally situated house, with a spacious shop on the ground floor, having large window space, which is well filled with a stock of watches, clocks, jewellery, and optical goods in great variety. The stock of spectacles and folders displayed in the window is the largest to be seen in the neighbourhood, and which attracts considerable attention. The work shop is in the rear, and is well benched, lighted, and ventilated. The business done is of a medium class, and principally of a local character. The proprietor is well known as a first-class operative in all branches of the business. A. W. Matthews, Manufacturing Stationer, Die Sinker, Relief Stamper, Embosser, and Press Maker, 50, Chiswell Street, Finsbury, E.C. \u2014 Few branches of London trade and commerce are more firmly established, or are carried on with more energy and enterprise, than stationery manufacture and engraving. A striking exemplification of the truth of this is found in the well-known and important business conducted by Mr. Arthur William Matthews at the above address. This establishment was formerly carried on by Messrs. B. Sulman & Co., and upon their retirement in 1884 the business was taken over by the present proprietor (their manager) on his own account. The premises occupied have a good frontage in Chiswell Street, and consist of basement, ground floor warehouse, and three floors above. The fittings and appointments are substantial and high-class. The concern is widely noted for work of the highest and best class in the manufacture of plain and fancy stationery for every purpose, die sinking, relief stamping, and embossing, engraving, and lithographic and copperplate printing. In all these branches the house enjoys an excellent reputation, and the specimens of their work on view give conclusive proof of the fact that the con ception and execution of the work are both artistic and of the first order of merit. Mr. Matthews likewise makes india-rubber and brass endors ing and dating stamps, copying and perforating presses of superior finish. The productions of the house have brought it a widespread and impor tant patronage, and a repute that is unsurpassed by that of any firm similarly engaged. The entire business is under the personal superinten dence of the proprietor, Mr. Matthews, who loses no opportunity of advancing the interests of his house. George Mitton, Letter-press Printer, Lithograper, &c, 27, Camomile Street, Bishopsgate, E.C. \u2014 Success in every department of business depends to a very great extent upon the intelligent proficiency and ability which are brought to bear upon it. This is more particularly true and applicable to the fine and intricate departments of trade such as that in which Mr. George Mitton, of the above address, is engaged. The enterprise was originally founded as far back as 1832 by Mr. Edward Varty, to whom Mr. Mitton succeeded in 1874, aftermany years engagement in the house. A general business is conducted in letter-press and lithographic printing, engraving, and stationery manufacture, the main feature being the production of all kinds of commercial printing, printing for chari table institutions, show cards, bill heads, ornamental calendars, as well as the most artistically-executed colour designs. In the line of calendars a speciality is made, and the work turned out for several of the leading insurance companies, who distribute these goods all over the kingdom, testifies iu the strongest manner to their surpassing excellence. A noticeable feature, too, of the productions of this house is the extraordinary capability they retain to stand the wear and tear of time, specimens of lithographic work being on view at this establishment, which, though originally executed upwards of twenty years ago, still appear as fresh and lustrous as when first turned out. The general printing trade is also covered to a great extent, likewise the manufacture of all kinds of plain and commercial stationery, in which a large export business is annually transacted. The premises occupied consist of an eligible three-story and basement and large well-lighted back building. In the prosecution of the work the best of modern appliances and machinery are utilised, the motive power being supplied by gas engine, constant employment being afforded a large force of skilled and experi enced workmen. In all respects the house occupies a prominent position in its line, both with regard to the character of its work and the admirable principles upon which all its operations are conducted. J. Ronald, Grocery and Provision Stores, 487 King's Eoad, Chelsea, S.W. \u2014 Mr. John Bonald has recently established a first class grocery and provision stores, known as the Greater Cash Stores. The premises occupied present a very attractive appearance, comprising a handsomely fitted corner shop, containing an extensive and choice assortment of the various commodities incidental to the trade. These are of the very best quality, and are supplied to the public at the same prices as at those establishments more generally known by the term of \" Stores.\" Energetic management and a due regard to the requirements of the public have already given this firm a large and influential connection, the proprietor personally conducting the business. A great amount of trade is done, and the establishment gives every indication of being exceedingly prosperous. Mr. Bonald has also lately become associated with his brother, William Bonald, who has been for eighteen years engaged in the plantation and curing of tea, coffee, and other tropical products in the Island of Ceylon, and this firm is now arranging to supply their customers direct from their own property in that island. Conse quently it possesses advantages in favour of the public which few, if any other firm obtains in the metropolis. John Nobbs & Sons, Tailors, Sec, 154 and 155, Upper Street, Islington, N. \u2014 Islington, which fifty years ago was sparsely inhabited, has now a population of 320,000. In this northern suburb, in a house built in 1652, in Oliver Cromwell's time, and which still retains its old appear ance, is carried on the tailoring business of John Nobbs & Sons, who commenced operations over forty years since under the style of Nobbs Bros. The establishment is still carried on by the founder of the business and his sons. The superior operations of this concern, from the very date of its origin, has made the name of Nobbs a household word in the district ; it is also well known in our different colonies, as they are con stantly receiving orders from many of their old customers who have gone abroad or settled there. This firm has long been noted for the style, fit, and durability of every garment made by them, and as only competent cutters are employed it cannot be wondered at that the concern has attained such widespread popularity and commands the patronage of the most influential classes in the locality. In every respect it is but just to say that this is one of the leading houses in its trade in North London. The premises are of ample dimensions, and their trade has so greatly increased that, we understand, they have opened a City branch at 81, Finsbury Pavement, where they seem to be duly appreciated. Charles Sharman, Undertaker, 93, Seven Sisters Boad, N. \u2014 The undertaking trade of London is of great magnitude, in the highest state of perfection, and employs many establishments and hands. A thoroughly representative house in the trade is that of Mr. Charles Shar man, which was established at King's Cross in 1838, and at the present address in 1865, and has been in the present proprietorship for twenty three years. Mr. Charles Sharman is the only undertaker in the district that keeps his own cars, which are most elegant in design, some open,"], [145, "MODERN LONDON. 161 E. J.

Monnery & Son, at the above address. This eminent firm was founded some sixty years ago, and is the oldest institution of the kind in Fenchurch Street. The premises occupied comprise a large double fronted ground-floor shop, with an attractive and advantageous frontage. The external view of the shop gives no adequate idea of the real size of the premises, as they extend some distance back, whilst underneath the shop is a spacious, handsomely-lighted, and well-equipped outfitting room, the world, providing such articles as clothing outfits complete ; cabin fittings and necessaries, as bedding, utensils, &c; cabin boxes and sea chests; clothes bags, folding deck chairs, camp stools, and packing cases of all kinds. These oujmts are prepared complete at certain fixed charges according to their extent and quality, or any of their component items can be purchased separately at proportionate and most moderate rates. The firm are very largely patronised in this branch. They hold appointments as emigrant outfitters to several colonial governments aud other large con .-tractors. The business in all departments is conducted with ability, energy, and conscientious attention to all customers' requirements, and the trade controlled in its entirety ranks among the largest and I most important, most extensive, and well-connected of any similar one in the metropolis. Syers & Co. (Albert J. Wells), Cocoa and Cocoa Butter Merchants, 21, Harp Lane, E.C. \u2014 This is one of the largest and most representative firms in its line in London. They stand in the front ranks of metropolitan importers of Caracas and Spanish Main, and other kinds of cocoa in the bean. The business was established in 1850 by Mr. W. H. L. Syers, and was successful from tbe very first. The sole proprietor is Mr. Albert J. Wells, who has been connected with the busiuess for 33 years. The operations of the house em brace the direct importation of cocoa in the bean, and the supplying of the commodity in that form to manu facturers of prepared cocoa. The firm are also vendors of everything applicable to the trade. Their customers include some of the largest manufacturing houses in the cocoa trade. The trade controlled extends to every quarter of the United Kingdom, and is continuously in creasing in scope aud volume. The premises occupied in Harp Lane comprise spacious offices and saleroom. The business furnishes a noteworthy and pleasing ex ample of mercantile advancement secured by mtthods of tried and well-proven soundness and rectitude. Showroom in Basement. Thomas Gibbs, Family Grocer and Italian Warehouse man, 54, Upper Baker Street, N.W. \u2014 The old-established and well-known firm of Mr. Thomas Gibbs comes prominently before our notice in this industrial review, and by reason of its high standing and extensive business connection has special claims upon our attention. This firm was established in the year 1824 by Messrs. Wortley & Hanbury. Subse quently Mr. Thomas Gibbs took over ihe business, and has gradually increased the departments and extended the connection. The different establishments are located as above, and at 130 and 132, Marylebone Eoad, and 38, Craven Boad, Westbourne Terrace. The business is conducted with characteristic ability, energy, and enterprise ; each department is superin tended by a competent manager, having a special knowledge of the goods under his charge, and aided by a large staff of experienced assistants. The old establishment in Upper Baker Street has been recently pulled down, and in its place has been erected a most attractive \u25a0= r- -y yl shop, occupying a commanding corner position, and fitted \"~i up in a most superb style, conveniently divided and g^s-=-jgj{|| arranged for conducting the grocery business on one \u2014 *MB^fflFffl side and the wine and spirit business on tlie other. BWWHa/ifi The provision department is a most important branch, \u25a0n/1 1 and the house is noted for its breakfast delicacies, in which every description of cabin and general ship furniture and requisites is stowed. The stocks held and displayed in the shop, and tastefully-arranged specimens of which appear in the well-dressed windows, are very extensive and varied, embracing every item requisite to complete a gentleman's outfit, with the exception, perhaps, of hats, and also of boots and shoes. All other necessary articles seem to have found a. prominent place in Messrs. Monnery's exceptionally complete array. White and coloured shirts are there in great diversity, and constitute a leading speciality of the firm. There are also Ceylon cloth and wool shirts ; unshrinkable flannel shirts ; all sorts of woollens for tropical wear, light, cool and sanitary ; Pyjama and Coutas sleeping suits ; hosiery in all the best makes, with specialities in the same line in silk and natural wool ; collars, cuffs, and ties, in seemingly endless variety ; rugs, bags, portmanteaus, umbrellas, dressing gowns, and smoking jackets.

W. Seaward, Funeral Carriage Yard, Hollingsworth Street, Liverpool Eoad ; Chief Office, 207, City Boad, Islington, N.\u2014The enormous population of London necessitates and renders of great public importance the proper sepulture of the dead. In accomplishing this part of the social economy of the metropolis, many firms of the first im portance in a commercial sense find lucrative, if sad, occupation. One of the very first is that conducted by Mr. W. Seaward. This firm was founded close on three-quarters of a century ago in Ironmonger Bow, where it was conducted for over twenty years ; then it was removed to Bath Street, where for thirty-five years a very extensive business was carried on ; hence* it was removed to the present premises, which are very extensive, and ad mirably arranged for the accommodation of a large number of horses. carriages, and hearses. Sixty-five fine horses are constantly engaged, and the staff employed numbers close on fifty. There is a unique feature con nected with the operations ofthe firm, and that is that they manufacture all their own hearses, coaches, and funeral cars on their own premises and by their own workmen. The firm also enjoy their own water supply, as they have a fine well of pure water, from which 1,000 gallons an hour may be obtained. In all their transactions proof of the greatest ability, in tegrity, and liberal dealing is given by the members of the firm, who individually and collectively take a pride in maintaining the eminent re pute of their noted house, and are very popular with their many customers and patrons in the trade, which they also supply. H. W. Mason, Carriage Works, Kingsland Koad, N. \u2014 One of the most important concerns in connection with the carriage building industry is that of Mr. H. W. Mason, of Kingsland Boad, whose carriage works are admirably situated within three minutes of Broad Street, and close to Haggerston Station, E. The firm was founded in 1830 by tbe father of Mr. Mason, and the latter, since he succeeded to the business, has conducted it upon the same honourable principles that have always been its prevailing characteristics, while he has increased the extent of its connections until it has become one ofthe leading concerns in the trade. The works are excellently adapted to the requirements of the various branches of the business, embracing large showrooms and extensive workshops, the latter equipped with all necessary plant, while a large staff of efficient workmen are engaged in turning out work of the best class in style, material, and make. The two floors are connected by a lift, worked by steam power, and capable of bearing any one of the vehicles manufactured. Varnishing is recognised by the firm as of the most vital importance in the finishing of a vehicle, and great attention is paid to this department, the varnish room being so supplied with gas jets that the temperature can be raised or lowered as required. This is the more important as the building of private carriages forms a leading feature in the business. These have been supplied to many leading mem bers ofthe nobility and aristocracy last season. Among others, carriages were built for the Marquis of Abergavenny, K.G., Lord Ashburton, Earl of Harewood, Count Herbert Bismarck, Count Vitythun, Count Camondo, and Baron Dieebman. and others in America, India, Canada, South Africa, and Australia. The high reputation of the work turned out by the firm is further testified by the four prize medals received at the exhibitions of 1851, 1862, 1867, and 1874, while the connection includes residents in all parts of tbe world. Mr. H. W. Mason is a member of the distinguished order of Freemasons, is a freeman of the City of London, and a member of the Worshipful Company of Coach makers. By the display of integrity, the exercise of indomitable per severance, and courageous enterprise, he has raised the concern of which he is tbe proprietor to a position of the first importance, and obtained a reputation which may be truthfully described as universal. J. Tucker, Family Draper, 83 and 85, Newington Green. Eoad, N.\u2014 Family drapery establishments constitute a large and impor tant portion of the commercial houses of North London. Prominent among tbe many enterprises in this connectiou is that of Mr. J. Tucker, whose neat and compact premises are conveniently situated in Newington Green Boad. This business was established about twenty-three years ago, and from its very inception, perseverance, activity, and sterling integrity extended to its operations, and raised it to the prominence it now enjoys. No house in the district can boast a more favourable record; its vast and representative stock, thoroughly complete in all its details, and including articles of a most fashionable and select character. is one of the most complete in the neighbourhood. No further proofs of its merits may be looked for than the extensive patronage it now com mands. The goods are retailed at prices compatible with excellence and superiority. In every respect the concern is a model of completeness. Mr. Tucker is well known in the trade, and his integrity and industry merit the approbation of all who are interested in the operations of an\u00bb honourable business man. Angus's Hotel (Proprietor, W. T. Angus), New Bridge Street, Ludgate Circus, E.C. \u2014 It would be utterly impossible to enumerate the various hotels in the metropolis. There are few more popular estab lishments in the City than that carried on by Mr. Win. Thos. Angus, and popularly known as Angus's Hotel. This popular concern dates its origin back to 1862, and since then it has made wonderful strides in public confidence. Its interior arrangements and control are characterised by the greatest regularity, and numerous visitors bear their unbiassed testimony to the excellent accommodation and general comfort of the establishment. There are altogether about forty bedrooms, and these are almost always occupied. They are most elaborately fitted, aud for clean liness and comfort they are faultless. The tariff is moderate. An efficient staff is employed, and no effort is spared to give the fullest satis faction to all who patronise it. The proprietor is always in attendance since he severed his connection with the Angus Hotel in Argyle Street, Glasgow. His long experience, and his connections with various business men, render him eminently capable of satisfying the tastes of the most fastidious customer. A. E. Randall, Ironmonger, Locksmith, Gas Fitter, Bell Hanger, &.C., 5, North Buildings, Eldon Street. \u2014 Glancing in the first place at the early history of this well-known firm, we find that the busiuess was established over forty years ago by Mr. William Corton, and was subsequently taken over by the present proprietor, Mr. A. E. Kandall, who does a very extensive business as an ironmonger, gas fitter, bell hanger, plumber, carpenter, &c., and manufacturer of iron safes and deed boxes. The business premises are very extensive, and comprise a large warehouse and workshop, with handsome and well-fitted shop, having a frontage of 30 feet by a depth of 50 feet. This firm employs a large* and efficient staff, and does a very extensive and continually increasing business. The establishment in every department receives the strict per sonal supervision of the proprietor, and is conducted with great ability, energy, and enterprise. C. A. Lowe, Seal Jacket Maker, and Fur-lined Mantle Manufacturer, 2 Clapton Pavement, Clapton, E.\u2014 Fur-lined mantles and furs for different articles of wearing apparel have of recent years become so extremely fashionable, that at present considerable activity prevails in this particular branch of trade. A prominent and enterprising concern in this connection is that conducted by Mr. C. A. Lowe, whose handsome and capacious premises are conveniently situated at 2, Clapton Pavement. This business was established about ten years ago at Hackney, but in 1882 it was transferred to Clapton, where its growth has been so rapid that about three years since Mr. Lowe was obliged, in order to cope with the increasing demands, to remove to the above address. In all its chang s its character has undergone very little alteration, except that each succeeding year has marked further development in the nature of its operations, orders coming from the most remote parts of the country-. The large and valuable stock is most select and perfect in character, and the intimate knowledge of the trade possessed by Mr. Lowe, with his command of ample capital, enahling him to secure the very pick of the market. Everything connected with the manufacturing department is carried on under the personal superintendence of the principal, so that in addition to the style and taste so characteristic of every article sent out of his house, buyers may be sure of the most conscientious workmanship, at prices which, having to bear one profit only, will, as we judge, bear favourable comparison with those of any house in the trade. The alteration department is an unusually important feature of the business, a large staff of hands being kept on the premises for the purpose. Here may be seen old fashioned jackets re-made into tight-fitting fashionable shapes \u2014 dolmans, mantillas, &c. Agents are appointed at many provincial towns, whose addresses may be obtained on application, and through whom articles needing alterations, &c, may be forwarded. In concluding this brief notice, we cordially wish Mr. Lowe a continuance of the success he has enjoyed in the past, feeling sure he will amply justify all we have said of him. J. Shephard & Co., Undertakers, 509, Cambridge Road, E. \u2014 The undertaking trade is of considerable magnitude, engaging many establishments which are under able and talented management. A typical firm in this line is that of Messrs. J. Shephard & Co., which was originally founded at Finsbury forty years ago, removing to Hackney twenty years later, and to present address recently. The premises occupied are com modious and convenient, and Messrs. J. Shephard & Co. conduct funerals in first-class, yet economical style. The ears and carriages are of elegant design During their forty years establishment Messrs. J. Shephard & Co. have kept pace with the ideas of the public in these matters, and they have given every satisfaction. They carry on a very lucrative business, their connection is widespread, and in all parts their services are highly appreciated. A. Bach, Watchmaker, 40, Great Russell Street, W.C\u2014 Mr. A. Bach, watchmaker and jeweller, is the proprietor of a very thriving and superior business, located almost opposite the British Museum. The business was established about 1857. The premises include a fairly large shop, well fitted. A great feature of the business is the large amount of work done in repairing of all descriptions. For this branch a particularly skilful staff is engaged. The proprietor of the establishment is iu every respect essentially practical, and has very great experience in every branch of lhe trade. As all work is executed under his immediate supervision, every order executed is finished in a very superior style. A large business is done, and the firm occupies a leading position in the trade. p"], [147, "MODEKN LONDON 163 James Rickard, General Draper, 36 and 38, Hampstead Road, N.W. \u2014 Prominent among modern industries stands the manu facture of flannels, blankets, linens, counterpanes, calicoes, shirtings, prints, &c, some splendid samples of which will be found in the magnifi cent showrooms of Mr. James Rickard, at the above address (near the Euston Road), who keeps an abundant and well-arranged stock of these articles. The premises consist of two double-fronted shops, having a front age of forty feet and a depth of eighty feet, and which, singularly enough, work, everything is carried out in best stylo according to the fashion. Hamilton's \" Elastic \" Dress Suits are now an institution, and have become so solely by the skill, care, and attention bestowed on the making, material, style, and finish of them. John Blkan, Watch, Clock and Jewellery Manu facturer, 35, Liverpool Street, City, E.C. \u2014 One of the most genuinely enterprising and, consequently, one of the mo6t successful of London houses in its line is that of Mr. John Elkan. This continuously pro gressive business was founded by Mr. Elkan in 1873. In that year be entered the wide field of watch trade competition, armed with a determi nation to devote his business energies to the interests of the public, and to supply to the people serviceable and thoroughly reliable watches at wholesale prices for cash. The venture was a bold one, but, like many another enterprise of its kind, has succeeded far beyond its originator's anticipations. Mr. Elkan has never once departed from the course he marked out for himself over fourteen years ago. His house is now decidedly a prime favourite among City watch, clock and jewellery establishments. The premises occupied at 35, Liverpool Street comprise a fine double shop of superior appearance. The floor above is also devoted to the purposes of the business, including offices, workshops, and other departments. At the principal shop (35, Liverpool Street) the display is of a particularly attractive character, and here one window is devoted mostly to gold, and the other to silver goods, with excellent effect. The whole character and arrangement of the place speak volumes for the careful efficiency of its management. The entire business is virtually a speciality, having for its object the supply to the people of articles worthy of the popular attention, at prices within the reach of every class of the community ; and upon this ground it would be invidious to particularise extensively any individual departments of the stock. One of the specialities of the house is \" Our Boys' \" watch, in stout solid silver cases, with crystal glass and a capital movement, warranted for two years, and offered at the marvellously low prices (according to size and style) of 13s. 6d., 21s., and 30s. Another is John Elkan's five guinea i( Foreman's \" silver English lever watch, a superb timekeeper, of fine finish and best workmanship, at 2/. 12s. 6d. This is remarkable as an instance of that \" value for money \" which is the practical trade motto of the house. A third speciality is the \" Per fection \" railway silver English lever watch, of splendid make and finish, usually retailed at eight guineas, and offered by Mr. Elkan at just half that amount. And a fourth feature of note consists in a gentleman's gold English lever watch, embodying every improvement of construction and beauty of finish, in massive 18-carat cases, with a five years' warranty, at 12/. 10s. This latter is, in truth, a magnificent piece of horological workman ship, air-tight, dust-tight, and damp-tight, and is of a class and character frequently commanding as high a price as twenty guineas. The secret of Mr. Elkan's low prices lies in the one magic word \" cash.\" The credit system, in the watch trade at any rate, is emphatically \" not the thing \" for these competitive and pushing times. \" Cash \" is the only medium whereby absolute value for money to be expended can be secured at any reliable house. Mr. John Elkan conducts his remarkably successful business in person, supervising every transaction of the house himself, superintending personally each department of the immense watch manu facture he so ably carries on, and leaving no stone unturned to sustain and enhance the enviable reputation that has been worthily acquired by his two popular establishments. The trade of the house is both of a wholesale and retail character, merchants and shippers, as well as the public, being supplied at the most favourable rates ; and the mercantile connections of the firm exist with growing influence and value in practi \u25a0 cally every quarter of the globe. J. Blackburn & Sons, Russian Mat Importers, 4 and 5, Wormwood Street, E.C. \u2014 The records and history of the old and represen tative firm named above, considered in connection with the high position it at present holds in the branch of trade to which it has long been devoted, furnish a noteworthy example of the results that may be achieved by the steady application of diligence, judgment, and progressive spirit to one particular and somewhat special department of commercial enterprise. The well-known house of Messrs. J. Blackburn & Sons was founded as far back as the year 1 800. There is probably no London or British concern engaged in the importation of Russian mats, and the supply of all descriptions of mats, matting, sacks, bags, rope, twine, &c, which stands higher in the estima tion of a widespread connection, or enters more vigorously into this sphere of business activity. The firm occupy two commodious buildings of three floors, situate near to the corner of Old Broad Street, and hold one of the largest and most comprehensive stocks in the trade. Messrs. J. Black burn & Sons import mats in very large consignments from Archangel, St. Petersburg, Cronstadt, Reval, and other ports, and deal extensively in all kinds of Russian and English-made mats and matting. The reputation enjoyed in these matters is as old as the century, the firm having been prominent and successful from the very first ; and the trade controlled to-day is one of very great volume and influence, its connections lying among leading firms in all parts of the United Kingdom, while valuable and well- developed export relations are maintained with the British colonies in all quarters of the globe. are built upon the ground previously occupied by one of the town reser voirs, an air shaft of which still exists. The floor above the shops is also used as a stock and show room, and is replete with every requisite of the drapery trade. The business was established in 1869, and, pro bably owing to selling a first-class quality of goods at a reasonable price, a thoroughly sound local trade has been built up, and maintained with increasing success ever since ; consequently the premises will ultimately undergo extensive alterations to meet the demands of the increased trade. Family mourning is made a speciality of by the house, and can be supplied on the shortest notice. Personally the proprietor is highly respected for his thorough knowledge of the business, and the successful method in which he conducts his daily increasing trade. H. Hamilton & Co., Civil and Court Tailors, 21, Bedford Street Strand, W.C. \u2014 Amongst the civil and Court tailors of London, the firm of Messrs. H. Hamilton & Co. occupy a leading position, after having been established for the past twenty-five years. Their new premises, situate as above, consist of a very fine shop measuring thirty by forty feet This firm do a large local trade, and are noted for the style and superiority of their work. As Court tailors they are frequently called upon by West-end firms to carry out high-class work, in which this estab lishment is noted for its proficiency. They keep a large and very fine stock of foods, and as the members of the firm personally superintend the K 2"], [148, "164 MODEEN LONDON. \" Crystallised Liqueur Goods,\" special \" Bright Gelatine Gum Goods,\" &c. The business is conducted in a most spirited and enterprising manner, upwards of one hundred skilled and experienced workpeople being con stantly employed. Messrs. Woillaume & Son are among the largest manufacturers of these goods in England, and occupy the highest position in commercial circles. Edwin Inge, Clothier, &c, 32, Seven Sisters Road, Holloway, N. \u2014 There is probably no district of the metropolis that d.s plays greater activity in the ranks of the outfitting trade than Holloway. In this connection favourable mention is merited by the important aud thoroughly representative concern carried on by Mr. Edwin Inge. Established about fifteen years ago, when the neighbourhood could boast of but little significance in commercial activity, this establishment stands to-day one of the most progressive houses in the whole metropolis. As giving an idea of its development, it may be mentioned that about two years ago a branch concern was established at 786, Holloway Boad. As a thoroughly representative clothier he stands unrivalled, and his produc tions have commanded widespread appreciation. Beady-made clothing constitutes the principal item in his operations, but latterly he has given his attention to a bespoke trade, which has proved very successful. In juvenile clothing his connection is extensive and influential. The premises are of modern construction. He employs a large 6taff of the most capable workmen, so that style, fit, and durability* can be safely* guaranteed. J. & J. Slugg, Umbrella, Sunshade, Cane, and Walking Stick Manufacturers, 27 and 29, St. John's Boad, Hoxton, N. \u2014 Umbrella, sunshade, cane, and walking stick manufacturing is a branch of industry that occupies a prominent place in the business operations of the metropolis. A well-knowu concern in this trade is that of Messrs. J. Se J. Slugg, whose neat and well-arranged premises are conveniently situated at St. John's Boad, Hoxton, N. About nine year6 ago this firm com menced its operations, and a first-class position has been attained. Striking liberality and untiring enterprise are marked characteristics of the partners, and have won them the admiration of business men generally, and a widespread connection. Their goods are noted for artistic and superior finish, and no greater proof of their merit need be looked for than the extensive patronage they have commanded. Special attention must be given lo the fact that tbe firm are now introducing handsomely chased gold and silver mounts in walking sticks, umbrellas, and sunshades of every description. These are made to order, in the best style, and of any design, and are really most artistically finished. Employment is given to a large staff of skilled operatives, and prudent purchasers find at Messrs. Slugg's many advantages that are denied to them elsewhere. G. Eockwood, Hosier, Glover, and Shirt Maker, 334 and 336, Holloway Road, N \u2014 To the enormous population of London the hosiery, glove, and shirt making trades owe their magnitude ; but they owe their high state of excellence to the energy, enterprise, and ability of those engaged in them. A thoroughly representative establishment in this business is that of Mr. G. Lockwood, which was originated by the present proprietor eighteen years ago. Mr. G. Lockwood, since the date of his inception, has worked up a very substantial trade, and earned a splendid reputation as the maker of shirts, especially the celebrated \" City Shirt,\" tshe excellence and superiority of which are proved by the great and in creasing demand. The premises, styled the City Hosiery aud Shirt Warehouses, comprise two large, commodious shops of very attractive appearance, and are replete with every fitting appliance for the proper carrying on of the trade ; in fact, the whole establishment speaks volumes for the taste and judgment of the energetic proprietor. The stock, of which a good display is made, is very- extensive and complete, and consists of hosiery of every description and in the newest styles, gloves by noted manufacturers, shirts, collars, dressing robes, serge jackets, waterproofs, umbrellas, dust coats, rugs, mauds, portmanteaus, flannel, regatta, Oxford and linen shirts, including the noted \" City Shirt.\" Shirts and collars are made to measure or pattern, and refits clone on the premises are equal to new. Throughout the stock is of superior quality. Mr. G. Lockwood does a very lucrative business, and his yearly returns show a very* gratifying increase. The politeness and attention shown by this gentleman and his assistants to the numerous patrons renders shopping at this establishment a pleasure, and it is greatly enhanced by the variety, newness, and superiority of the stock. ?o establishment iu the local trade receives, comparatively speaking, more extensive patronage, or is more worthy of it, than that known as the City Hosiery and Shirt Warehouse. J. W. Reed, American Organ, Harmonium, and Piano forte Manufacturer, Handel Works, Hanover Street, Islington, N. \u2014 Among the many* branches of industry which during the last decade have been greatly developed, and found, so to speak, their head-quarters iu Londou, is the manufacture of all sorts of wind and string musical instru ments, and particularly organs, harmoniums, and pianofortes. One of the leading houses engaged in the business is that conducted by Mr. J. W. Beed. This business was established seventeen years ago by the present proprietor. The premises occupied consist of offices and works, and they are very extensive and admirably fitted and arranged. A very large and influential connection has been formed, and is maintained in a manner most consistent with the strictest canons of commercial probity. The quality of Mr. Reed's organs and piauos is of the highest excellence in point of tone, depth, and richness, unexcelled construction, and perfect material. Between 15,000 and 16,000 instruments have been made by the firm. Great attention is given to the making of instruments for tropical climates, tbe wood, leather, Sec. being specially prepared aud poisoned, so that not only climatic effects, but the attacks of insects are successfully resisted. Mr. Beed employs a large number of the most ex perienced hands. Mr. Beed is personally much esteemed by his customers and employees for his integrity and honourable business qualities. J. Pangbourne & Co., Wholesale Leather Merchants, <kc, 15 aud 17, Liverpool Road, Islington, N. \u2014 The many branches of industry in London in which leather is largely used render the trade in this valuable material one of extensive proportions. A thoroughly repre sentative house in this business is that of Messrs. J. Pangbourne & Co., which has been in existence for over twenty years. This firm is the largest and most important of its kind in North London. It contracts to the British Government. The large and commodious premises are fitted up in a very suitable manner, and contain an immense stock of leather of all kinds, which is of the best quality. Messrs. J. Pangbourne Se Co. also manufacture closed uppers, employing thereat an ample staff of able and experienced hands. They also carry on a very extensive trade, under able and energetic management. The partners are gentlemen thoroughly proficient in their trade, and their sterling qualities have gained them the respect of the trade. Edwards & Co., Fancy Repository, 88, Upper Street, Islington, N. \u2014 The trade in fancy goods has now assumed considerable importance. This is especially applicable to the suburban districts. A prominent house in this connection is that carried on by Edwards & Co., who were established in the year 1860. They deal in all kinds of fancy goods, being especially noted for the novelties they are continually bringing out in the way of birthday, Christmas, Easter, and other cards, leather, china, glass, and various other wares. The character of these goods is allowed to be unsurpassed. The stock is of a most inexhaustive and representa tive character, and customers can always rely on obtaining what they require at prices so extremely moderate as to place the concern beyond the reach of competition. Neither time nor money is spared to give every satisfaction to all who patronise the house. No firm is more intimately acquainted with the details of the busiuess than that of Edwards Se Co., aud their energy, activity, and perseverance cannot fail to realise for them a large share of success. Woillaume & Son, Wholesale and Export Confectioners, Ridley Boad, Kingsland, N. \u2014 One of the most noticeable features in Kingsland is the extensive and well-known factory of Messrs. Woillaume & Son, the \" Bee \" Steam Confectionery Works. The business was founded in the year 1850, and Mr. Jules Woillaume was one of the first to establish the manufacture of French confectionery in this country, and succeeded so well that he produced and sold several thousand tons of his specialities, as, for example \u2014 voice jujubes, glycerine pastilles, honey dates, Sec, before their manufacture was attempted by other firms. Having thus gained the lead, this firm has well maintained it. The business premises of Messrs. Woillaume & Son are very extensive, covering an area of half an acre of ground. These works are replete with the most recently improved machinery and appliances. Special features are made of \" Cremes Francais,\" \" Fondants,\" \" Sugar Fancies,\" decorated, \" Con fiserie Francais,\" \" Pastilles de Gomme,\" crystallised, \" Bright Gum Goods,\" \" American Cream,\" \" London Mixtures,\" \" Gelatine Fancy Goods,\" \" Acidulated Crystallised French Jellies,\" special \" Gelatine Gum (Joods,\" \" Crystallised Gelatine Goods,\" \" Conserves,\" \" Pan Goods,\" J. Sherrard, Plain and Fancy Box Manufacturer, 09 and 70, Forston Street, Shepherdess Walk, Hoxton, N. \u2014 The operations of the drapery trade of the metropolis provide an extensive field for the work of the cardboard box manufacturer. In this connection a represen tative concern is that of Mr. J. Sherrard, whose commodious and well appointed premises are conveniently situated. This business was estab lished about fifteen years ago. There are few bouses in the trade that have better facilities for turning out high-class goods, and no further proof of their peculiar merit need be looked for than the influential and valuable patronage they command. In the manufacture of cardboard boxes for hosiers, milliners, und drapers in general this concern has won a good reputation. Some of our most fashionable drapers, &c. patronise the establishment. The premises are of suitable dimensions, and a numerous staff is employed. Mr. Sherrard is well known iu the trade and his connections with commercial men have won for him their respect and confidence. r"], [149, "MODEEN LONDON. 165 Simmons & Tullidge, Carpet Cleaners, Pleasant Grove, York Road, King's Cross, N. \u2014 The cleaning of carpets has now become an easy matter as compared with the old system. Messrs. Simmons & Tullidge have invented, patented, and successfully promoted a machine process for carpet beating, which is at present the only effectual methed by which carpets can be thoroughly freed from dust and moth, without injury to the fabric. This invention has several special advantages Amongst other points of superiority, are expedition ; carpets received one day are returned the next, or iu urgent cases on the same day ; tho roughness iu the removal of dust, every particle of the same not only being expelled, but any possible moth-deposit being thoroughly eradicated at the same time; and the impossibilty of any fabric being subjected to damp. Another feature in the process of the Patent Steam Carpet Beat- William A. Wright, Pianoforte Manufacturer, 20, King's Boad, St. Pancras, N.W. \u2014 Art and music have attained so high a degree of prominence and activity in London of recent years that piano forte manufacturing has assumed a position of great importance. Each succeeding year brings fresh aspirants into the ranks of the trade, and speculations are daily established in all directions of the metropolis. About three years ago Mr. William A. Wright commenced his manufacturing operations, and judging by the success he has already attained, it is easy to form an approximate idea of the stability upon which his perform ances were inaugurated. Of the many eminent qualities possessed by his productions it is almost unnecessary to speak, since the influential and rapidly-developing patronage he has commanded is the best guarantee of merit and general suptriority. His cottage pianos, constructed on iron frames, are instruments that command the highest degree of recognition wherever they are introduced. Art-designing in pianoforte cases is made a spec'ality in the operations of the establishment, and here we are intro duced to some of the finest and most artistic specimens of workmanship imaginable. Iu every respect this is a thoroughly representative estab lishment, and all its connections are worthy of the highest commendation. Mr. Wright is a gentleman of long experience, obtained at the expense of an exacting apprenticeship in some of our leading bouses, aud his energy and ability cannot fail to produce for him an influential position. W. Bryett, Bedstead Manufacturer, Metropolitan Bed stead Works, 472 and 474, Caledonian Road, Islington, N. \u2014 A branch of industry in London of considerable magnitude, and in the highest possible state of excellence, is the manufacture of iron and brass bedsteads, and among the establishments engaged a principal place is held by that of Mr. W. Bryett, of the Metropolitan Bedstead Works, which was originally- estab lished over thirty years ago at Little North Street, by the present pro prietor. This business has been located at the present address for twelve years. The premises are extensive, and admirably equipped wiih every appliance of modern construction applicable to the business carried on. Ouly experienced hands are engaged in manufacturing the brass and iron bedsteads of every description, for which the house is renowned. Mr. W. Bryett carries on a very heavy wholesale home and export trade, and is well known in the industrial world, and is much esteemed for his sterling qualities and talent. ing Works is its non-injurious effect on the fabric as the dust is being expelled from it. Any carpet, large or small as it may be, is placed on the roller of the machine, and the fabric, spreading out over an india rubber bed. is shaken and struck by a number of leather beaters carefully incased in india-rubber, while the liberated particles of dust are instantly drawn away by the powerful and unerring action of a fan. The machinery used is of the most effective kind, and for the purpose to which it is applied may be confidently described as the most perfect yet produced. In the chief works, Pleasant Grove, there are six machines, worked by two steam engines and a gas engine, and with other machinery and plant Messrs. Simmons & Tullidge are capable of dealing with upwards of a quarter of a million of yards, or nearly fifty acres of carpet per week. The immense quantity of dust drawn off from the carpet beating in the machines by the fan is carted away every week and sold to a well-known contractor for manure. The proprietors of this establishment also clean carpets by the new dry or French process. This invention of Messrs. Simmons & Tul lidge for cleaning carpets by machinery has been taken advantage of hy enterprising capitalists in the provinces, to whom the patentees have dis posed of their rights, but they reserve the right of the patent in London for themselves. The business of Messrs. Simmons & Tullidge is one of considerable magnitude. In addition to their works at Pleasant Grove, York Boad, King's Cross, they have works at Latimer Boad, Notting Hill ; Station Boad, Camberwell ; and Zion Boad, New Thornton Heath, Croydon, and new branches are opened at Chelsea, and 1, Brook Street, Kingston. In addition to a clientele which extends over every part of London and its suburbs, Messrs. Simmons Se Tullidge have an immense business throughout the leading carpet and upholstery firms. Another gain to the public, it may be mentioned, is their moderate scale of charges for beating and cleaning carpets, whatever may be the size, small or large. W. E.

Claxton, Cotton Merchants and Wick Manu facturers, George's Square, Hoxton, N. \u2014 In the manufacture of wicks the well-known cotton mills of Messrs. R. & R. Claxton have long been noted. Established about a century ago by the ancestors of the present firm, the operations of the establishment then consisted exclusively of the manufacture of cotton wicks for candles. With the introduction of oii lamps a new departure was necessary in the operations of the concern. Immediately they started the manufacture of lamp wicks, and they have worked most assiduously to maintain the reputation they had established in their original capacity.

He is recognised in the trade as holding a pre-eminent position. Mr. Lamb manufactures all descriptions of jewels incidental to the orders of Freemasonry, and badges and crosses for all societies. At the installation of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales as M.W. Grand Master on April 28th, 1875, the firm made 368 gold jewels for the stewards who officiated upon that occasion. In addition to this extensive order, the firm also manufactured a jewel of the same design as tbe before-mentioned, aud set with sixty-two diamonds, which was presented to the Prince of Wales by the Grand Lodges. A large amount of work is done in the manufacture of masonic clothing, embroidery, furniture, regalia, &c.

All work is executed under the mest careful supervision, and is of the highest degree of excellence in every detail. and highly popular business."], [150, "166 MODEEN LONDON. H. Banwell, Wine, Spirit, and Beer Merchant, 5, Junc tion Place, Dalston Lane, E.\u2014 There is probably no branch of business in the metropolis that is more extensively pursued than the wine and spirit trade. A prominent and thoroughly representative family house in this connection is that of Mr. H. Banwell. This business was established ten years ago, and in 1884 the present proprietor succeeded to it. During his connection with the establishment he has done much to improve it. The concern has long been noted for the excellence of its liquors, and is an \" off-licensed \" house. Only the productions of the best houses are stocked, whether in wines, spirits, aerated waters, or ales. The premises are of suitable dimensions.

Northcroft, Wire Worker, &c, 135, King's Road, Chelsea, S.W. \u2014 An industry occupying a very important place in the trades and manufactures of this country is that of the wire worker. The old-established house of Mr. Wm. Northcroft has special claims on our attention and consideration, on account of the excellence and variety of the goods manufactured, and as one of the oldest makers in the trade. The business is carried on in large and commodious premises, consisting of shop and extensive manufacturing premises attached, replete with all the most modern and improved appliances connected with this industry, and giving constant employment to a large staff of skilled workmen.

Watt, Translator and Interpreter, 6, 7, and 8, Clements Lane, Lombard Street, E.C. \u2014 One of the many evidences of the varied nature of metropolitan activity is afforded by the existence in our midst of gentlemen who devote their undivided attention to the translation and interpretation of foreign languages. In this connection a high position is taken by Mr. J. Watt, ofthe above address, who has been engaged in this profession since 1878. He has a thorough knowledge of all the European languages, and in addition to effecting translations in these, he is able to procure translations of every language in the universe.

John Kensit, Bookseller, 18, Paternoster Bow, E.C. \u2014 There have generally been establishments in the publishing and book selling trade that have been more or less closely connected with some particular forms of religious doctrine, but until lately there was no such depot in tte central London district that was connected with Protestant and Evangelical literature as a special feature. The establishment of what is now known as the City Protestant Book Depot therefore supplies a want that has long been felt, and the success that has been achieved is the result of much commercial enterprise and ability. The premises in Paternoster Row comprise a fairly large shop on the ground floor, with four large floors above, and a basement, used for packing shipping and other large parcels, heavily stocked with a choice selection of books. Several volumes are printed and published under the auspices of Christian aud Protestant associations.

This gentleman commenced his operations in the world of invention some years ago, and, after producing some useful articles in connection with tram-ear work, he turned his attention to the trade of his father, and the one to which he himself served a most exact ing apprenticeship. In this connection he produced the \" Imperial \" and \" Acme \" repeating check action for pianofortes. The greatest proofs of the utility of these articles is to be found in the large demand for them. They have found a ready sale in all the markets of the world, and have made the name of Mr. Squire a household word in piano manufacturing concerns. The premises are of moderate dimensions, and the fittings and appointments harmonise with the general character of the business.

Another speciality with the firm is Major-General Hannynton's Slide Rule, of which Messrs.

Particular attention is- due to the picture of a circular frame, with> medallion of Her Ma- jesty ; this is to be seen in the splendid! work published and written by Mr. Evans. This beautiful piece of workmanship, like al& the others shown in the book, was executed by Mr. Evans himself. All the best mechanical papers have given most favourable reviews of this valuable book, which cannot fail to afford gratification to the talented author. The ivory used in mak- ing this exquisite piece of workmanship was unusually large, one piece being 6j| in. in diameter and f in. thick, while another was 5 in. in diameter and -5^ in. thick. The thirty-two large beads and sixty small ones were taken from smaller ivory, and required a orent amount of care and untiring patience in their production. The medallion of Her Gracious Majesty the Queen was cut from the gold medal awarded to the author at the Inventions Exhibition. J. H.

The business is personally superintended by the proprietor, who is a tho- roughly practical engi- neer, and the large and constant trade done by this firm employs many skilled and experienced workmen.

Hammond, Stationer, &c, 190 and 191, Upper Street, Islington, N. \u2014 There is probably no branch of business mure extensively pursued, nor oue in which a keener spirit of competition is more visible in the metropolis, than the wholesale, retail, manufacturing and school stationery, bookbinding, and printing trade. In this connection an old and thoroughly- representative concern is carried on under the style of C. Hammond, whose spacious premises occupy an eligible position. Established about thirty-six years ago, this concern has experienced the keenest competition. It has surmounted this, and is to-day one of the most flourishing concerns of its kind in North London. A superior stock, \u25a0excellent workmanship, and strict punctuality in all its appointments have established this concern in the confidence of the commercial men of the district. While it enjoys a most extensive and valuable local patronage, its operations have extended themselves to the country and abroad, and its productions are highly appreciated wherever they are introduced. The premises are admirably suited to this particular Hue of trade. The proprietors are gentlemen of the highest standing, earnest, energetic, and well respected. John Walker, Tailor and Juvenile Outfitter, 23, Seven Sisters Road, Holloway, N. \u2014 The clothing trade of London is naturally of great magnitude and importance, employing many hands, and repre senting immense wealth. A thoroughly representative bouse in this trade is that of Mr. John Walker, which was founded by the prcseut proprietor fifteen years ago. As a practical tailor Mr. John Walker has no superior in the neighbourhood, and he has a splendid reputation as a juvenile outfitter, making this branch the speciality of the business. The shop occupied is spacious and commodious, possessing a handsome and extensive frontage, and the window displays a choice selection of clothes, the lay figures showing them off to the best advantage. The interior is also elegantly fitted up with the necessary appliances and fixtures. The stock is very extensive and complete, consisting of clothes for gentlemen and juveniles in the latest and most fashionable styles. The juvenile department is in admirable order, and much patronised, Mr. John Walker fully recognising tbe importance of sound durable material, sufficient to meet the wear and tear of school and juvenile life, and of pretty and tasteful patterns aud styles. There is a splendid assortment of goods, not only in this department, but in the gentlemen's. The order department is under Mr. J. Walker's personal supervision, the cutters are able and experienced, and there is a magnificent stock of materials for the selection of patrons. Mr. John Walker carries on a splendid business, the connection being of long standing and of good-class character. The proprietor's admirahle qualities have made him very popular, and his house is universally assigned a most influential place in the trade. Stephen L. Knaggs, Pianoforte Manufacturer, Park Street, Liverpool Road, N. \u2014 Among the many firms in the piano trade, favourable mention may be made of an old-established and well-known house like that presided over by Mr. Stephen L. Knaggs, whose spacious -and well-appointed premises are centrally and conveniently situated. This gentleman commenced his operations about sixteen years ago at C-amden Town, and removed to Islington about six years afterwards, the Tiusiness still continuing to develop. Larger premises proved to be indis pensable to the interests of the business, and in 1880 the present large and eligible factory was acquired. Here the work is proceeding with the greatest uniformity and success, and has attained a degree of prominence that is recognised to be the outcome of sound and artistic workmanship, combined with the most systematic business methods and a general desire to give the fullest satisfaction. In the manufacture of pianofortes of a superior order this house has long since obtained the highest recognition from critical and competent judges all over the country. The proprietor is a gentleman well known and highly respected in the trade, and no man works more energetically to maintain the prominence he has worked so hard to create. Stedman's Teething Powders, 125, New North Road, Hoxton, N. \u2014 With the manufacture of teething powders the name of Mr. Stedman has long been associated, and his prominence to-day may easily be conjectured from the widespread reputation of his manufactures. Commencing his operations about twenty-two years ago at East Boad, in a very short time his busiuess increased in such magnitude that larger premises became indispensable, and in 1880 be acquired the present eligible building. Here additional facilities have been provided, and the operations of the establishment are pursued with admirable activity. There is no house in Great Britain that can show a more favourable record of its operations, nor one that has attained a greater degree of popularity. Stedman's Teething Powders are now an established article of commerce, and have found their way into all the principal markets of the world. At home there is not a chemist or druggist of any repute that does not keep them in his stock, aud the extensive patronage they have commanded is sufficient evidence of their inestimahle properties.

John Piggott, Outfitter, 115, 116, and 117, Cheapside, E.C. \u2014 Fourteen years ago was founded by its present enterprising proprietor the extensive outfitting establishment of Mr. John Piggott. Mr. Piggott's rapid development of this now most important house affords a highly interesting example of what can be accomplished by dint of energy and vigorous enterprise. The premises occupied are very large and commo- dious. They comprise three spacious shops of excellent appointment and most advantageous street frontage, situate at the corner of Milk Street and Cheapside, and possessing every facility for the adequate carrying on of an important and representative outfitting business. We understand that at present the City Corpora tion are in treaty with Mr. Piggott in reference to the purchase of his interest in the buildings, 1 1 5 and 1 1 6, Cheapside, they being required in the carrying out of the scheme for the widening of Milk Street. The system of trade adopted is of a character pe culiarly well adapted for those gen- ii. A. Davis, Umbrellas, &c, 13, Poultry, E.C.\u2014 One of the leading and most successful establishments in its special line of trade in the City is that of Mr. H. A. Davis, manufacturer and dealer in umbrellas. It was opened for business about seven years ago, and being conducted on enterprising and intelligent lines, it steadily prospered. The premises occupied consist of a well-appointed shop, in which is displayed a large and varied assortment of fancy umbrellas, with gold, silver, ivory, and other mounts. Mr. Davis has exhibited in his window a frame with three representative umbrellas. The first is a specimen of the old fashioned silk and whalebone gamp carried forty years ago, the second the ordinary paragon frame umbrella, and the third a \" Compactum.\" The great contrast of these three umbrellas is very remarkable, and a little amusing. The \" Compactum \" is the most perfect and smallest rolling-up umbrella in the world. Since its introduction the \" Com pactum \" has won its way into great popularity. The invention is the only real departure from the construction and principle of the first umbrella made. It was awarded a prize medal in England and a silver medal at Paris in 1885. Over 60,000 of them have been sold. 'Ihey* are well patronised by- Americans, and the \" Compactum \" umbrella has found its way into all parts of the world. Mr. Davis has a widespread and high-class connection among City and West-end people.

Mr. Piggott's terms are \" No credit : no discount ;\" but every article in stock is marked down at the lowest cash prices consistent with its undoubted excellence. The depart ments into which the enormous stock held by this house has been sub divided suggest the careful attention Mr. Piggott has given to catering for o*entlemen. They include Tailoring, in which every garment is made to order with strict regard to the perfection of style, fit, and finish, and re liability of all materials employed; Hats, a branch in which the goods of this house cannot be beaten, all head-wear coming direct to this depart ment from the operative *, Boots, with a remarkably complete and well assorted stock, embracing styles and sizes to suit all requirements, and possessing unsurpassed facilities for the execution of fiue order work ; Umbrellas, a perfectly representative stock, containing every desirable style in fashionable goods for both ladies and gentlemen; a fine assort ment of Waterproof and Bubber Goods ; a department for Hosiery of all kinds, and one for Bags, Portmanteaus, Trunks, Hat and Dressing Cases, Sec, which has lately been considerably extended, and now contains an exceptionally well-chosen stock ; and a section for the supply of Cricket, Football, aud Tennis requisites. To the perfecting of these several departments in all matters appertaining to the convenience of their arrangement, the effectiveness of their display, and tbe thorough excel lence \"of all their various wares, Mr. Piggott has devoted his best energies, and he has spared no effort in any part of his emporium to fully maiutain the high repute he has ever enjoyed as the proprietor and controller of an establishment whose every detail of order, system, and mercantile equipment has always been irreproachable. This house makes a spe ciality of supplying complete outfits for India, the colonies, and all extreme climates, and in this respect is very largely patronised. Mr. Piggott is liberally supported by a numerous and desirable City clientele, and'liy residents in all parts of town, country, and abroad. W. H.

Bastall & Son are proprietors of a very old-established business as booksellers, stationers, engravers, &c, at Eccleston Street and Ebury Street, Pimlico. The premises are very large, and consist of a handsomely fitted shop, containing a very extensive stock of high-class general and fancy stationery. The business of the firm, which dates back to 1810, embraces all the many varied branches of newspaper agents (forwarding an immense number of papers to all parts of the country, Continent, and the colonies), booksellers, stationers, and advertising agents. Iu addition to these a considerable amount of business is done in the way of printing, bookbinding, &c, for which an efficient staff is engaged. Many other branches of trade are connected with this firm, a very large business being done in the sale of fancy leather goods. The connection is of the highest class. The firm has a reputation of long standing, and occupies a pro minent position iu the trade. which at that time stood in the midst of M garden grounds, where a coach passed once per day to Blackwall. Thence the business was removed to the present larger premises in 1850. The quarters now occupied are iu reality most commodious in point of gene- ral dimensions and equipment. They are provided with machines and presses of the latest pattern, also cutting machines, types and borders of the most modern style, by means of which the best work is accomplished with despatch and in first-class style. A general com mercial printing business is conducted, such as newspaper and book work, letter, note, and bill headings, pamphlets, posting bills, cards, circulars, &c. Mr. Myers is held in the highest estimation in commercial life for his kind and courteous manners and strict integrity, and will be found prompt, liberal and enterprising, and ever solicitous for the benefit of his patrons. George White, Pianoforte Warehouse and Music library, 27, High Street, Kensington, W\u2014 Among the well-known establishments in Kensington is Mr. George White's Pianoforte Ware house and Music Library. This business was established originally by B Morlev about thirty years ago, and has been under the management of its present proprietor three years. Mr. White was formerly for a number of years with Mr. Morley, and he therefore possesses an intimate practical knowledge ofthe trade. The premises occupied are commodious and well equipped. The warerooms contain a fine assortment of pianofortes from the leadiu*** British and Continental manufacturers. They are sold at manufacturefs' prices, and are guaranteed to give perfect satisfaction. The music library contains an extensive collection of the finest compositions of all the workUamed composers. In addition to the above departments, Mr. White repairs and tunes pianos aud musical instruments. He is well known and highly esteemed. F. Lee, Saddler, fee., 65, Long Acre, W.C. \u2014 This is one of the most celebrated businesses of the kind, having been established over thirty years, and attained a position of great importance in the trade. The manufacture of every description of Saddleky and Harnkss Goods is conducted on a very large scale, one of the chief features being that all work is done by hand, no machinery being used at all. About eighty hands are engaged in this establishment. The premises occupied are spacious and commodious. Mr. Lee also owns a large factory in Stafford shire. The business is managed in the most able and energeiic manner.

Humphreys, Harmonium and American Organ Manufacturers, 47, King's Boad, St. Pancras, N.W. \u2014 Among the numerous industries that constitute the commercial activity of the metropolis, the manufacture of harmoniums and American organs takes a most prominent place. There is probably no more representative concern in this connection in Great Britain than that carried on by Messrs. A. & E. Humphreys, whose spacious premises are conveniently situated as above. This business has only been established about five years, and from the date of its origin it has almost created a revolution in the ranks of the trade by the superiority of its goods. This extra ordinary success must be attributed to the tact and unerring judgment of the proprietors, whose untiring enterprise and striking liberality have earned for them a degree of confidence that would prove highly invaluable to any enterprise. A speciality in their operations is the manufacture of an Italian walnut veneered case ornamented with gold inlaid work. This is a highly artistic production, and is much appreciated by competent and critical judges of its various features. They carry on an extensive business, and each succeeding year furnishes further proofs of development. They give employment to a most skilful staff, and in the ranks cf the trade their name is very popular. They give their personal attention to every detail, and their management has assumed a degree of perfection that cannot fail to produce for them the commanding position they so highly deserve. ditious manufacture of all classes of goods in this beautiful and artistic branch of commerce.

The house is well known, and holds a foremost position in the trade as the original and most extensive manufacturers of these goods, having a large and wide spread connection of a wholesale and export nature, The United Artists' Picture Frame Manufactory, (H. J. Murcott), Hanover House, 6, Endell Street, Long Acre, W.C. \u2014 In the foremost ranks of firms that make picture framing a study, stands the United Artists' Picture Frame Manufactory, which was established some twenty-six years ago by Mr. Henry J. Murcott, who in the early part of his career was associated with some of the then leading frame makers. Mr. Murcott experienced some difficulty in endeavouring to supplant the old, heavy, and awkward frames with those of his own manufacture, which were of artistic design, delicate conslruetion, and superior finish. At length he began to receive orders from various artists in different parts of London who had discovered the great artistic taste, studious care, and unusual skill which characterised the frames manufactured by Mr. Murcott, and at the present time his clientele con sists of many distinguished names. A special feature of the business is the restoration of oil paintings, and in this branch of his business he cannot be excelled. For the cleaning and restoring of prints and drawings Mr. Murcott's name is no less celebrated, while as an art expert he is constantly consulted by artists, collectors, and members of the various fine art associations. He is regarded as an experienced, valuable, and desir able authority, who is well worthy the support of his patrons, and who by his strict probity, indomitable energy, and uniform urbanity, has won so large a circle of friends in the art world of England. being particularly well estab lished among the best buying houses in the United Kingdom, while their export trade is grow ing considerably among wholesale buyers abroad, by- whom, as well as the English buyers, the artistic design and su perior quality of all goods manufactured by the company are deservedly appreciated and highly eulogised by the public and the Press all over the world.

The premises occupied are on the ground floor, and comprise an office for receiving goods, well furnished and appointed. The company have added to their business a department exclusively devoted to the Cleaning and Purifying of Beds and Mattresses The process is at once simple and novel. The hair and feathers are all thoroughly sifted by a machine, while jets of disinfectant fluids mixed with soft steam are directed upon them for a considerable time. They are then lifted to the hot-air room, where they are carefully laid out to dry and curl. The company venture to say that their process is not only thorough in its purifying effects, but that the hair and feathers are by their treatment made in all respects equal to new. The speciality of the house is its patent process of dry cleaning, by which garments of all kinds, as well as upholstery hangings, can be renovated without shrinking the material or impairing the colour, or in any way destroying the originality ofthe article cleaned. The working plant and the stock generally are in the best of order. All kinds of dress fabrics, furniture hangings, ladies' and gentlemen's wearing apparel, table covers, curtains, &c. are received for renovation. The quotations made will compare favourably with those of any other house in the trade. The company are well known, and have a wide and valuable connection, their business being principally conducted among the aristocracy and the leading residents of the West-end. The proprietor is a gentleman practically conversant with all branches of the business, and highly respected by his customers. in the business.

Puttick & Simpson, auctioneers of literary property, music, and works of art, in respect to its antiquity and importance, may be regarded as one of the oldest established and most highly connected houses in its particular branch of business. The firm was established in the year 1794, and has had its career of success and usefulness equalled by very few business establishments. The premises occupied were formerly the residence of Sir Joshua Eeynolds, and for the purpose none could be more appropriate.

It comprises the mauufacture of metallic boxes aud other metallic articles, in great variety, some of them of great inge nuity, and requiring for their production delicate and costly machinery, while all are useful and attractive. Mr. Jahucke's articles are invariably of his own in vention, thereby constituting genuine specialities, which he is wisely careful to patent, and of all of which he is the sole manufacturer. Perfection us design and finish, and superiority in quality, are the distinguishing features of the productions of the Canonbury Works, and have earned for them a world-wide reputation. The works are well situated within easy distance of the City, by rail, omnibus, cr tramway.

It generates and gives off a maximum degree -of beat with the consumption of a minimum quantity of gas. As a warm- ing apparatus for offices, apartments, and all buildings, large or small, it has certainly never been surpassed in the matter of moderate expense ; and a recommendation of no small consequence lies in the fact that the stove requires no flue, and is so constructed that it combines the three functions of lighting, warming, and ventilating. The product of combus- tion is condensed through copper tubes, and a current of air is brought in at the base and up to the top of the apparatus through au interior coil, so .arranged that the air is warmed in its passage without coming in contact with the gas, and eventually passes out into the room through an orifice in the upper part of the stove. The appearance of the stove is handsome, its workmanship being excellent, and its design exceedingly neat.

Sheath Brothers, india-rubber, gutta percha, and general manufacturers, of 89, City Boad, E.C. This eminent house was founded upwards of thirty-five years ago, under its present title, and has long stood promi nently forward among the representative industrial firms of London. As merchants and makers of all classes of india-rubber goods the house ranks as one of the very first in the metropolis, and it is not likely that any commercial establishment in the kingdom holds larger or more exhaus tively varied stocks in this line of merchandise, or can show so vast an array of special features whose individual items are distinguished in every detail by such pronounced characteristics of merit. The premises occupied at the above address are very extensive, and comprise, first, a fine ware house and suite of showrooms of ample dimensions, possessing excellent street frontage, and affording exceptional facilities for display of goods. Back of this stands the factory, of great size and commodious arrange ment, ranging over a wide space of ground right through into Park Place, and equipped in every department with a mechanical plant of the most valuable and improved character. Here a very numerous force of hands are employed, and all the goods in which the firm so extensively deal are produced on these premises under careful personal supervision. Messrs. Sheath Brothers enter very largely into the manufacture of a number of important specialities, for which they have acquired a widespread and eminent reputation ; and among the most prominent of these may be mentioned the following : Hose of all descriptions and in various weights of india-rubber and graded degrees of strength for watering purposes, in which line the firm have developed remarkable excellence in all their productions, both as regards actual quality of material and the convenient character of the fittings they have introduced, which strike a very effec- tive death-blow at the old-fashioned and effete watering can. Gymnastic apparatus in elastic rubber, comprising three articles of remarkable merit \u2014 the \" Gymnast A,\" the \" Swing Gymnast B,\" and the \" Universal Chest Expander C \" \u2014 each of which is a gymnasium in itself, very portable, and possessing all those effective qualities of healthful muscle development which are known to exist in properly-made rubber appliances of this kind when used with due judgment and care. Church hearing apparatus ; speaking-tube fittings ; speaking-tube mouthpieces, with whistles and indicating whistles in ivory, ebony, cocus, and box wood, gutta percha, brass, and electro-plate ; flexible speaking tube, covered with worsted or silk in various colours ; and portable pocket flexible conversa- tion and hearing tubes, for the use of persons of defective hearing. In this connection it may be mentioned that the house largely manufactures flexible speaking tube for telephone instruments and apparatus, with which it supplies the Government. The next speciality, and perhaps the most notable of al), consists in the firm's Patent Self-Supplying Water Brushes, for cleansing purposes of all kinds, and particularly for carriages and horses. These invaluable articles, which have proved so well worthy of the great success they have achieved, consist in a brush with a patented hollow- back construction, which, by means of hose connection through the handle, is kept continuously charged with clean water from any receptacle to which the other end of the hose may be attached. This water issues in a constant and voluminous flow through the bristles of the brush, and the effective manner in which all cleansing operations may thus be accom- plished becomes obvious. The brushes have now been before the public for fourteen years, and in every instance of their purchase their use has been thenceforward continued. They stand unique in this respect, and also in the satisfactory, quick, easy, and cleanly manner in which they do their work. They are produced by the firm in a great variety of sizes and styles for various purposes, and have been used continuously since their introduction in Her Majesty's stables, with a record almost as long in the stables of H.B.H. the Prince of Wales, and in those of most of the nobility and gentry. Continuing Messrs. Sheath's long list of valuable specialities, their india-rubber veterinary articles of all kinds, such as horse knee-caps, fetlock boots, horse shoe-pads, See., Sec, are full of interest to anyone concerned in matters equine ; and following these are every description of india-rubber solid punched mats, india-rubber corrugated matting, draught-excluding tubing, patent felt weather strips of excep- tional efficacy, and tubular moulding strips. India-rubber water beds, air beds, mattresses and cushions, seats, pillows, rubber baths, and hot-water bottles, all of the best and most improved construction, find their allotted places in the great array ; and the house has put forth some of its most successful manufacturing efforts in the production of india-rubber, gutta percha, leather, and gut driving bands for threshing and all other machines. All this is supplemented by a complete assortment of india- rubber articles of various kinds for mechanical and domestic purposes, including suction and delivery hose, tubing, valves, washers, india-rubber and self-lubricating packing, bicycle tires, socket rings, sheet rubber insertion sheets and gauze wire insertion sheets ; and beyond these again come a great variety of brass, gun metal, and copper fittings for hose, &c, and more specialities in india-rubber waterproof garments ; improved apparatus for cleaning asphalte roads, paths, drives, ships' decks, &c. ; .eather and canvas hose ; force pumps and garden engines ; ana a perfect host of productions, great and small, in gutta percha and rubber of every class. The space of a brief review like this forbids anything like adequate enumeration of such an enormous and comprehensive stock as that held by Messrs. Sheath Brothers iu their warehouse and showrooms ; and it is only possible to add that anyone requiring anything into whose manufac ture india-rubber and its kindred compounds enter to any great extent can have his or her wants fully supplied through the medium of this representative house. Messrs. Sheath Brothers have an acknowledged reputation as constant producers of worthy and beneficial novelties, something new and uuique being continuously added to their immense diversity of present stock ; and in point of quality in all their manufactures they stand unsurpassed, the excellence of their goods being amply attested by exhibition awards of great noteworthiness, among these being the large and handsome medal presented to the firm by the Council of the International Exhibition, Victoria (Australia), 1866-67. The house holds appointments to Her Majesty the Queen and to H.B.H. the Prince of Wales, and exhibits yearly at the Boyal Agricultural and Smithfield Cattle Club Show, where its goods are always a centre of attraction. It must be mentioned that Messrs. Sheath Brothers, among the many admirable inventions and improvements they are ever introducing, have perfected an Improved Hose Keel, especially suitable for fitting up in hospitals, infirmaries, board schools, and large factories, where an instan taneous supply of water is desirable. This is secured by the peculiar construction of this reel, and firemen, in a place where it is fitted up, can at once commence operations, running the hose off the reel, and at the same time discharging a full and powerful jet of water. This reel has been supplied to the Boyal Naval Hospital, Greenwich ; and it is worthy of note that the firm supply their superior hose to the Post Office and the Admiralty. Messrs. Sheath Brothers conduct every branch of their great industry with exemplary energy and enterprise ; the connections of their house are widespread and valuable, and a trade of great volume and magnitude is controlled, operating with ever-growing influence and importance both at home and abroad. J. Benton & Co., Patent Steam Ship-Biscuit Manu facturers, Universal Biscuit Works, Commercial Boad, E. \u2014 A name of much note and distinction in connection with the manufacture of ships' biscuits in London is that of Messrs. J. Benton & Co., of Commercial Eoad, E. This well-known firm was founded about twenty years ago, and is the outcome of one of the oldest biscuit manufacturers iu London. The high excellence of Messrs. Benton's productions in these goods is too well known to those interested in the matter to need any accentuation here. It has endowed the house with an eminent reputation, and won for it the liberal patronage of the shipping trade of London and of the principal ships' stores and provision merchants. The firm's biscuits are to be found on all the leading steamships, and are held in high favour everywhere. Messrs. Benton have also developed as a special depart ment tbe manufacture of dog biscuits, poultry and game foods, in which they have been exceedingly successful. It is in this connection that the name of Benton is, doubtless, best known to the general public ; and the firm's American meat dog biscuits are recognised by kennel masters and sportsmen as one of the best foods for dogs in the market. Mr. Benton, the head of the house, has made these biscuits a special study in all respects ; and although he is content to let the goods advertise them selves and succeed solely upon their own inherent merits, the business in this department continuously increases, and has now assumed very large proportions. The firm supply the trade only, and many of his customers have greatly enhanced their name and reputation simply by the sale of these dog biscuits. Messrs. Benton have a fine factory and warehouse in the Commercial Boad, just east of Stepney Station. The manufacturing departments are equipped with a most complete and effective plant of steam-power machinery, and supplied by Messrs. T. & T. Vicars, of Liverpool, the eminent biscuit machinery manufacturers, notably amongst these machines being their fine cylindrical mixing machines, gauging and cutting machines, &c. ; but many of the apparatus at work have been expressly designed by Mr. Benton, to meet the re quirements of a growing business. The establishment comprises a large three-story building 120 feet long and 70 feet wide. It is maintained in excellent order throughout, and presents many evidences of the careful and efficient management which, applied by Mr. Benton to every de partment of his business, has made this house celebrated among the commercial and industrial institutions of East London.

The private home custom is also of the highest class, being principally with the aristocracy, from which connection comes large demands for the superior liveries supplied by the house. The sole proprietor, Mr. George Daniels, is well known throughout the trade as a practical tailor, and highly respected by his customers for his urbanity and assiduous attention to all orders entrusted to him. Alfred Bishop & Sons, Manufacturing Chemists, 48, Spelman Street, Mile End New Town, E. \u2014 Among the leading firms of manufacturing chemists a very prominent position is taken by the firm of Alfred Bishop & Sons. Mr. Alfred Bishop in 1857 discovered the Granular Effervescent Citrate of Magnesia, and seeing what a future such an article might have before it, he commenced making it in that year. It instantly became very popular, and a host of imitations were placed on the market. After thirty years, Bis/top's Citrate of Magnesia is still facile princeps, far superior to any of the numerous cheap A. G. Middleton, Photographer, 312, Kingsland Road, N/. \u2014 In looking over the remarkable artistic, industrial, and commercial achievements of modern London, there are few circumstances or events that stand forth more prominently than those connected with the advance ment of photography. This useful and always interesting art progresses and improves continuously ; and in its progress and improvement it receives excellent encouragement at the hands of Mr. A. G. Middleton, of Kingsland Boad, who holds in view a very high artistic ideal iu all his work, and who has by this means become one of the most notable of North London photographers within a comparatively short period of time. Mr. Middleton's premises are large and commodious, and the studio, which is the only revolving one built, is constructed on the most approved principle, and is situated on the ground floor. His work is in every respect excellent and of great artistic merit, and well illustrates the high level of perfection to which the photographic art has attained in London under the auspices of earnest and skilful exponents, bent upon exemplify ing its great resources and capabilities. Mr. Middleton displays at his studio some specimens of his work in the various styles of photography now most approved, and these are all to be highly commended for a distinctness of outline, richness of tone, aud fineness of finish that are not to be met with outside of establishments wherein photography is practised as an art rather than as a trade. Mr. Middleton manifestly spares no trouble or effort to secure a satisfactory and creditable result in each picture ; aud his portraits possess a certain brightness and vivacity that point to excellent resources in the matter of apparatus and appliances, and indicate a thorough knowledge of the best way of employing the same. In every photograph shown the posing is excellent, and it is clear that the portraits are all good likenesses, for they are life-like to a degree. All kinds of out door photography receive Mr. Middleton's careful attention, and any portrait can be enlarged to life-size, or painted in oil or water-colours. Copies may always be had, and Mr. Middleton's enlargements on porcelain touch perfection iu the matter of effect and permanency. In short, his achievements fully entitle him to prominent mention among the most worthy representatives of the photographic art in North London. His tatent is plainly apparant ; he has won local esteem and confidence, and his house is rising to honour and influence, having already secured the support of a valuable connection and gained a large and increasing share of distinguished patronage. imitations in the market. Mr. Bishop also introduced many other granular effervescent preparations, which met with great success, and at once occupied a very prominent position in the market. The business developed so riipidly that in 1869 the present splendid premises were built, and these consist of a very spacious three-storied building, that is admirably fitted throughout with all the necessary appliances and machinery. In the old premises Mr. Bishop for some time carried on the business of general manufacturing chemist, but the demand for his granulated effervescent preparations so rapidly increased that he was compelled to devote his sole attention to this branch of the subject, and manufacture these preparations only. Various medicines are made in the granular effervescent form \u2014 in fact, every description of bright and soluble medicines, as it renders them much more agreeable to take. Alto gether upwards of sixty different varieties are made up as granular preparations. Among the leading specialities are Citrate of Caffeine, a first-class remedy for headaches ; the well-known Citrate of Magnesia, as originally invented by Mr. Bishop in 1857 : and several valuable mineral-water salts are made as granular effervescents, forming a ready and economical means of producing the mineral waters of the Continent. In these the chemical ingredients of the natural springs are represented, and thus an instantaneous and refreshing draught can be obtained in any quantity aud at any time. Citrate of Lithia, a very well-known and popular remedy for gout, is also made ; and the latest introduction is Antipyrin (for migraine), &c. This is by far the most important firm in the world engaged in this special branch of manufacture, aud their preparations are sent to all parts of the globe. An enormous trade is done, and the firm is very widely renowned. On Mr. Bishop's death, in December 1886, his sons, Walter and Alfred Bishop, having been for many years asso ciated with Mr. Bishop in the business, entered into partnership together, and now carry it on on the same lines as their father did. Perpetual injunction in Chancery has been obtained against anyone using their trade mark. T. H. Clark, Tobacco, Snuff, and Cigar Manufacturer, 124, Mile End Boad, E. \u2014 One of the best-known houses in the cigar and tobacco trade is that of Mr. T. H. Clark, manufacturer. This house has been established twenty years, during which time it has secured a high name, and is now the most important in its line in the east of the metro polis. The premises utilised comprise a building of three stories, with good street frontage. The manufactures include some very special brands of cigars, prominent among which are the much-favoured \" Perfect Bliss \" and \" Los Bufalos,\" which are well liked in all the principal hotels and restaurants of the neighbourhood, as well as the leading houses in the trade. The specialities in tobacco are the \" Perfect Bliss \" and \" Old Brown,\" with trade-mark \" Act on the Square,\" each of which are well known, and can be obtained in all parts of the country. A large stock is always on hand. The valuable orders daily received by post testify to the extended patronage enjoyed. In the various manufactures a numerous staff are constantly employed, and goods are delivered by the firm's carts to all parts of London. The entire business is supervised and conducted by the proprietor, who is a gentleman of wide experience in the trade, and who spares no effort in maintaining the valuable reputation he has so long enjoyed. Edward Gates, Wholesale Cabinet and Looking Glass Manufacturer, 61, Curtain Boad, E.C. \u2014 Anyone that has been in Curtain Boad, or is at all familiar with the district, must have noticed the splendid building belonging to Mr. Edward Gates, whose business was founded in the West-end in 1860. Mr. Gates' establishment is a very im posing building, consisting of showrooms, warehouses, and workshops of five floors in height, and covering a large ground-area. Throughout every department due regard has been paid to the fittings, and the several floors communicate by means of a very powerful lift. The proprietor is exten sively engaged as general cabinet manufacturer, and has gained wide spread renown for manufacturing articles that, both in construction and design, are certainly unsurpassed. A large number of hands are employed. Among the leading features of the business may be mentioned the manu facture of looking glasses, and such goods as overmantels, toilet glasses, Sec, in which the firm particularly excel. Many novel aud artistic descriptions of furniture have been introduced with great success, and constitute specialities characteristic of this house. An enormous business is done in both the home and export branches. The firm have a very wide spread aud important connection, and command a thriving and successful business. Daniels & Co., Tailors, 90, Jermyn Street, St. James's, S.W. \u2014 Prominent among the staple industries of the age appears the sartorial art, appropriately represented by the well-known house of Messrs. Daniels & Co., which was founded eighty-five years since. The premises occupied contain a large and handsome showroom, well fixtured, and containing a large stock of best West of England, Scotch, and other well-known cloths, whde at the rear are the cutting and work rooms, well benched, and fitted with every requisite for the prompt making up of materials. The great specialities of the house, in which they have made a widespread reputation, is the manufacture of military uniforms and liveries ; in fact, these specialities constitute in a measure the principal features of the trade of the house, although an extensive business is also done as ordinary tailors. Their uniforms and liveries are celebrated throughout the world for their intrinsic merits, and the other goods pro duced are of an equally high order of merit. Their general business is very extensive, employing a tolerably full force of experienced cutters and tailors on the premises, in addition to a large outdoor staff. The military trade is particularly well established, the firm holding appointments to H. Fawcett, Engravings, Etchings, and Mezzotints, 14, King Street, Covent Garden, W.C. \u2014 A most important branch of commercial activity in the metropolis is the production and sale of fine engravings, etchings, aud kindred works of art. One of the old establish ments in this line is that of Mr. H. Fawcett. This business was estab lished more than seventy years ago, and has been conducted by its present proprietor over forty years. His name is familiar to all collectors of engravings and drawings. Mr. H. Eawcctt's trade is chiefly confined to West-end, county patrons, and the American collectors, by whom, and in art circles generally, he is held in high esteem as a keen connois seur.

This pro minent and thoroughly re presentative firm control at the above address an establishment that ranks among the business features of au eminently mercantile vicinity. The premises are very extensive, having a Armstrong Se Son, Engineers, 55, West India Dock Boad, E. \u2014 The old and notable house of Messrs. Armstrong Se Son was founded between sixty and seventy years ago, under the style of Arm strong & Allen. The firm are general engineers, boiler makers, aud coppersmiths, shipsmiths, brass and iron founders, and brass, tin, and iron plate workers, and in these lines they do a large and important business. A large auxiliary trade is done in the supplying of all descrip tions of ships' ironmongery and metal fittings of every kind, together with engineers' and engine-room stores. Every piece of ironwork from the stem to the stern of a vessel can be supplied by this firm ; and specialities of note have been developed in steering gear, pumps, fire engines, brass and iron ventilators, tested chains, capstans, winches, scuttles, nails, cutlery, lamps, and ship chandlery. At 55, West India Dock Boad, Messrs. Armstrong & Son occupy extensive and commo dious premises as warehouse and works, the whole covering an area of about 6,000 square feet. The works are fully equipped with every facility of improved mechanical apparatus and appliances, and a numerous staff of skilled workmen is employed. The warehouse con tains an immense stock of ships' ironmongery, &c. Messrs. Armstrong have a large foundry opposite, where they execute all kinds of casting work, and are manufacturers of anchors, steering wheels and gear, Sec, &c. The affairs of the house are ably and energetically conducted, and its reputation is among the highest and worthiest in the trade. frontage of about 1 50 feet to Hearn Street, and extending back to a con siderable depth. Their situation is especially advantageous, the site occupied being within two minutes' walk from Broad Street and Liver pool Street Railway Stations, and not many yards from Finsbury Square ; and the commodious and admirably ordered warehouse could hardly be better suited than it is to afford adequate and well-con ditioned accommodation to the immense stock \u2014 or, rather, aggregation of stocks \u2014 this firm constantly hold to the order of their widespread circle of custom. The task of fully and exhaustively setting down the par ticulars of Messrs. Osmond & Matthew's great business would involve nothing less than the compilation of a volume, so comprehensive are the commercial operations in which they engage, and so wide the scope included within the embrace of their trade and stock ramifications. The firm are importers, exporters, and factors in the broadest sense of those words, and their undertakings comprise an immense range of transactions, both as buyers and vendors, in leading home and export markets. They are merchants in all kinds of sundries for oil and colourmen, ironmongers, grocers, Italian warehousemen, drysalters, &c, acting as general pur veyors to these trades in a great variety of ways. They are also suppliers of every description of brush ware, turnery, mats, soaps, domestic utensils and machinery, glues, gums, cements, and a veritable host of other items of merchandise far too numerous to admit of any detail here. In each of these lines exhaustive stocks of superior goods are held, and the house enjoys a splendid reputation as a reliable medium for the supply of the best classes of articles in those branches to which its attention is directed. The business in its entirety is conducted with that ability and skill that is indispensable to the proper and successful management of a concern so comprehensive in the nature of its enterprise ; and an enormous trade is controlled, valuably and influentially connected in all parts of London and the provinces, and extending its far-reaching operations among the great export centres of the colonies and foreign states. Henry Edie & Co., Iron and Brass Founders, The Bow Foundry, Bow, E. \u2014 This well-known firm, dating its history from the year 1832, is one of the oldest as well as one of the largest concerns engaged in the iron and brass founding industry of eastern London. There is probably no metropolitan district more closely or creditably identified with foundry operations than Bow, and tbe Bow Foundry, con trolled by Messrs. Henry Edie & Co., is probably the largest in the district, and is famed for its productions in all kinds of heavy castings. The firm have facilities for turning out castings of a larger calibre than those producible at almost any other London foundry. Castiugs weigh ing six tons are not at all uncommon achievements. The premises occu pied by Messrs. Edie, and devoted to their extensive iron and brass founding operations, are not without historic interest, apart from their industrial notoriety, for they stand on the site of what was formerly an early residence of John Wesley, and cover the very spot upon which he is reputed to have first preached. Some idea of the magnitude of the business may be formed when we state that from nine to ten tons of iron castings is a common daily output. They cast for gas works, water companies, engineers, chemical manufacturers, brewers and distillers, contractors, builders and surveyers, also manufacturing a large number oi machine-gun shells, and produce every description of founding in brass, iron, &c. required by these trades. They specialise the gas works de partment, in which they enjoy the custom of the London gas companies generally, and have been very successful in the production of scrubbers, washers, condensers, purifiers, retort fittings, and all descriptions of gas and chemical plant ; and among brewers and distillers for mash-tuns, fermenting backs, tanks, &c. Fire bars, with quick delivery, are another speciality, excellent facilities being possessed for turning these out expe ditiously and satisfactorily. The personnel ofthe firm of Messrs. Henry Edie & Co. now includes Mr. Outram Monier- Williams and Mr. T. Eowland Hill, jun. The name of Monier- Williams (son of Sir Monier Williams, K.C.I.E.) will at once be recognised by many as one which is intimately associated with that extremely healthful and enjoyable, though in this country most uncertain, sport, skating. A brother of this gentleman has probably done as much as, or more than, any living Englishman to pro mote the interests and popularity of figure-skating here, and has written a highly useful and comprehensive work dealing with the beauties and intricacies of the \" graceful art,\" in which he is himself notably proficient. It is, therefore, appropriate that the Bow Foundry should have developed a prominent speciality in an improved skate, which is achieving wide spread celebrity among lovers of skating under the registered name \" Monier- Williams.\" For figure-skating it has been pronounced un equalled, and far superior to the majority of \" steels \" devised for that purpose. It is supplied to wholesale dealers all over the United King dom. Mr. Eowland Hill, jun., is the son of Thos. Eowland Hill, Esq., formerly head of a notable firm of builders, Messrs. Higgs Se Hill. From first to last, the business of MessTs. Henry Edie & Co. is well and ener getically conducted by its two capable and experienced principals ; and the extensive trade controlled to-day i6 thoroughly consistent in magnitude and character with the traditions and reputation of a house that has for so many years stood before the public as a worthy representative of one of our greatest British industries. E. C. Phillips & Co., Pianoforte Dealers, 415, Mare Street, Hackney, E. \u2014 The pianoforte trade of London is of great magnitude and value, and the establishments engaged are very numerous and in able and experienced hands. A fine business in this trade, conducted on the three years' system of purchase, is that of Messrs. E. C. Phillips Se Co., 415, Mare Street, Hackney, E., and which was originally founded by Miss Phillips thirty years ago, having been in the present hands for some time.

Favarger, Aerated Water Engineer, 76, Turnmill Street, Farringdon Eoad, E.C. \u2014 Many years ago was founded in Paris, under the title of Monsieur Mondollot, the eminent house more recently established in London by Mr. H. Favarger, at 76, Turnmill Street, Farringdon Koad, where a business of great extent and importance is carried on in the issue and supply of all apparatus connected with aerated water manufacture, and also in a variety of other mechanical aud engi- neering appliances of note. The premises occupied at the above address are large, but are, however, of a temporary character, the firm awaiting the reconstruction of their former establishment, recently destroyed by- fire. The premises, as they are now utilised, stand at the end of a large court yard, and comprise spacious offices and showrooms on the ground floor and two upper flats of a commodious building, affording good facilities for the display of an extensive and valuable stock of machinery of various kinds, aud for many important uses. Mr. H. Favarger, however, operates most largely as au aerated water engineer, and his specialities in this line are becoming very widely and favourably known by reason of the many improvements they embody over much of the oid-fashioned apparatus still in use. The leading feature of this branch of Mr. Favarger's trade consists in the Mondollot Patent Double Generators for the con- tinuous and automatic production of carbonic acid gas. These machines constitute such a noteworthy development in the plant of aerated water manufacture, that a few words respecting their nature and advantages will here be in order. The Mondollot Automatic Generators are vessels for generating carbonic acid gas from sulphuric acid and whiting. Instead, however, of working in such a manner as to necessitate the storing of the gas generated in a gasometer, they operate automatically, quite dis- pensing with the gasometer, and producing the carbonic acid gas in exactly the quantity required by the pump or pumps, of any description, that may be working with them. The Mondollot Generators are double in construction. They consist of two separate and distinct generators, each one made to work quite independently of the other, yet both con- nected with the pumps in use by the same pipe. This duality of character enables the generators to be worked one after the other, giving time to renew the materials in each one as they become exhausted, and it also provides against stoppage by the not likely contingency of a breakdown iu one of the generators, in which case the other could at once be put in operation. It would be impossible to enter properly in these brief pages into technical details respecting the mechanical and chemical construction and action of the Mondollot Automatic Generators, but a few words may- be devoted to a brief summary of their manifest advantages, which cannot fail to continuously recommend them to general adoption. The first great feature of the Mondollot system is that it entirely dispenses with the gasometer, and renders the production of the carbonic acid gas continuous and automatic. Then it is remarkable for economy, as the machine does not fail to disengage every possible particle of carbonic acid gas, and it is claimed that the cost of the apparatus is more than saved in two or three seasons by the great reduction in expenditure for sulphuric acid. And other very noteworthy advantages which call for no comment are : Economy of labour and space, the machine being self-acting and dispensing with the bulky gasometer ; purity of the gas generated, by a slow and double purification ; greater sharpness in the aerated water, as the carbonic acid gas is used in a nascent form immediately upon its genera- tion ; no dangerous service of the acid tap, which is opened to its full extent, and the machine left to supply itself ; no possible contamination of the carbonic acid gas, and no waste thereof ; impossibility of explosion, owing to the infallible action of the sensitive safety water valve ; and unique capacity in showing when the materials are exhausted by the level of the water in the vase. Many more points of merit might be cited in commendation of this excellent machine, but sufficient has been said and indicated to show that the Mondollot Generators are worthy of every consideration that can be afforded them in a progressive age. And not alone on mere theory do their good qualities stand, but upon incontestable evidence of practical test and experience. Many of the most eminent British manufacturers of aerated waters are now using these generators with eminently satisfactory results, and in F'rance, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Bussia, Austria, Greece, Hungary, Sicily, Holland, Portugal, Persia, South America and the West Indies, Algeria, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand they have been very extensively adopted, and in every case with gratifying success. Many hundreds, altogether, of the double and single generators (for they are also produced in single form) are now in use, and the more their merits become known the more the demand for them increases, and the long list of commen- datory testimonials grows both in bulk and in value. Mr. H. Favarger also manufactures every other class and description of aerated water and syrup compounding machinery, including bottling and corking machines, syphon fillers, syrup injectors, taps and measures, tincture presses, bottle washing appliances \u2014 every requisite, in fact, for the soda water or aerated beverage manufactory, and his stocks represent, in addition to these, many other mechanical and engineering apparatus of an improved and notable character, from a gas engine to an ice making machine, from a vertical or horizontal steam engine and boiler to a brewer's dray, or a warehouse crane or lift. Specialities of a high order of merit may be mentioned in the \"Express\" Bottle Brushing Machine (Hoddinott's Patent), H. Favarger's New Eapid Syphon Filler, and II. Favarger's New and Im proved Syrup Plants, rigid and practically everlasting. All of these have found many admirers in every quarter of the globe, and it is noteworthy that nothing leaves the warehouse of this enterprising firm that does not possess some strong characteristic of improvement, and embody one or more novelties in construction which are powerful recommendations in days when mechanical progress is indispensable to mechanical success. Mr. Eavarger's noted goods have obtained high exhibition honours for merit and excellence, eminent instances in this connection being medals at Lyons, 1872 ; Vienna, 1S73; Paris, 1875; Philadelphia, 1876; and the gold medal, Paris, 1878. The business of the house is directed with great energy, ability, and enterprise, no effort being spared to maintain and add to the successes and good reputation already so widely and deservedly achieved. The entire establishment in Turnmill Street, where a numerous staff is employed, is kept in the best of order, all the extensive stocks being in splendid condition ; a widespread and valuable connection, well founded, and of much influence in this and many other countries, is enjoyed, and a home and export trade of great volume and importance is controlled, its ramifications extending, as already indicated, to every civilised part of the world. Watkins & Co., Yacht and Boat Builders, Orchard Yard, Blackwall, E. \u2014 This thoroughly representative house was founded upwards of twenty-five years ago by Mr. Watkins, who still continues to administer its affairs as sole proprietor. It would be difficult in the whole of the great port of London to find a house more important and influential than this in connection with the building of all kinds of boats and light vessels for sea and inland service. Few persons seeing a swift, graceful, and perfectly- trimmed yacht \u2014 the very \" poetry of motion \" transferred to the crest of the sea \u2014 would be likely to associate it with the somewhat dingy and always prosaic locality of Blackwall ; and yet, in the yards of Messrs. Watkins, at this same place, are built and equipped some of the highest classes of yachts to be found to-day on any waters. The chief boats for Lord Wolseley's Nile Expedition were constructed here, and there is absolutely nothing in the form of a yacht, launch, or lifeboat, for sail or steam, a navy boat, fishing boat or punt, pleasure or rowing boat of any kind, that Messrs. Watkins have not or cannot make in the very highest style ofthe modern boat-builder's art. All their work is remarkable for correctness of line and beauty of form, every require ment of speed, strength, aud safety being fully satisfied ; and better finished boats have never left a builder's hands than some of those sent out from Orchard Yard. Messrs. Watkins' yachts are supplied to the aristocracy and leading yachtsmen of this country, and are held in very high esteem. They make lifeboats for the Boyal National Lifeboat Institution ; are large contractors to both the British and several foreign governments, making steam launches, &c, for tbe Admiralty- ; and enjoy the patronage of the Honourable Corporation of the Trinity House. The firm have executed many important orders for the German, Italian, Portu guese, Turkish, Brazilian, and Chilian governments, and are now making a number of boats for the Eoumanian government. The works at Orchard Yard are very large, but are frequently tested to their utmost capacity by the demands of this great business ; and at times the firm employ as many as 200 hands on the spot. This is all independent of a fine plant of steam power machinery, which affords splendid working facilities for every department of the industry. A survey of the establish ment is deeply interesting, and shows the great care taken by Messrs. Watkins to ensure the soundness and reliability of everything they do in boat building. This care is especially noticeable in the construction of lifeboats. Ships' lifeboats are a great feature with the firm, and are sup plied by them to the P. and O., and to several other prominent steam shipping companies. The whole business is most capably and energeti cally conducted, and receives the constant personal superintendence of Mr. Watkins, who is a yacht builder of the most exhaustive practical experience, as well as a sailor, and a member of the Institute of Naval Architects.

Star Brush Company, Eden Grove, Holloway, N. \u2014 The highly important firm known as the \" Star \" Brush Company have introduced to the public of this country a very much improved form of brush. This improvement consists in the brushes being made with a solid back. The old system of brush making consisted principally of boring holes through the wood, and after the tufts of hair were placed through the holes and secured with wire, they were covered on the back with a thin veneer. The system adopted by the \" Star \" Brush Company entirely obviates these drawbacks, and consists of boring the holes in a solid back, and only partly through. The great feature of the inven tion is the ingenious manner in which the tufts are fixed by steel wire staples, the machinery used in this branch of the work having been specially invented for the pur pose. The company originated in America, where the invention was first brought out. In 1869 this was brought to England by J. Sheldon & Co., and a small business was established at the Cadby Steam Works, Leather Lane. This developed very rapidly, improved machinery, a special feature being the use of steam for all the drying, heating, and seasoning purposes. Some idea of the extent of this business may be gathered from the fact that between fifteen and twenty pianos are completed weekly. Messrs. Eungblut make a speciality- of the manufacture of the iron-framed pianos for extreme climates. These are guaranteed to 6tand all climatic influences, being made of the best and thoroughly seasoned materials, elegant in design, stand well in tune, and have the most perfect action to insure power and lightness of touch, and, in a word, they cannot be surpassed for quality and price. This business in every department is conducted with great energy and enterprise, and, in addition to the extensive home connection, a very large export trade is carried on. Messrs. C. & J. Eungblut have been long and honourably connected with the business, and occupy a high position in commercial circles, and the extent and magnitude of their transactions entitle them to rank with the largest and most influential houses in this business. and to meet the requirements of an increasing trade, the busiuess was converted into a limited liability company in 1874. English interest was then combined with American, the stock, plant, and goodwill were purchased, and the company started under the chairmanship of Mr. B. C. Bansome, of Ipswich, who was the largest shareholder, whilst Mr. Bradley, who had come over with the inventors, and who to a great extent had carried on the business, was made the managing director. The business at the present premises has rapidly- increased and prospered. The proprietors now own nearly two acres of free hold ground adjoining the Holloway Station, where they are build ing extensive premises. The manufactory is 200 feet iong, and is admirably fitted with improved machinery. Numerous prize medals have been awarded, and the firm command a very extensive trade in all parts of the world. Fred. Southwell, Wholesale Newsagent, 27, Ivy Lane, E.C. \u2014 The well-known bookselling and publishing business of which Mr. Frederick Southwell is the able and energetic proprietor was established by that gentleman about thirty years since, and occupies a very prominent and responsible position as a means of communi cation between provincial and suburban newsagents and the London publishers. It would be an obvious impossibility for booksellers and newsagents at a distance to send up day after day for their supplies of the various newspapers and periodicals, and such houses as these of Mr. Southwell arrange the matter by receiving them in bulk direct from the publishers, and making up parcels for their clients which con tain so many copies of such periodicals, &c. as they may previously order. It is evident that such a business as this, with clients in all parts of the country, requires the most careful organisation, and an attention to details which must be incessant, and in the extensive ware house and offices of Mr. Southwell many thousands of such parcels are despatched with a regularity and a system which could not be surpassed by the Post Office itself. Each day of the week has its allotted series of newspapers and periodicals, from the dailies which are issued in the early hours of the morning to those which come out at certain fixed hours in the day, and to each of the numerous list of customers one or more parcels has to be sent by road or rail every day, the rush being of course much greater towards the end of the week. The loss of a train means delay and loss to the intended recipient, and the greatest care has to be taken to guard against any accident of the kind. In the whole course of his lengthy business career Mr. Southwell has been par ticularly fortunate in the execution of the commissions with which he has been favoured ; and his busy and well-conducted establishment in Ivy Lane is one of the most successful and popular of those which are devoted to this important branch in the prompt diffusion of literature of all kinds. Gammage & Hollingum, Wine and Spirit Merchants, 21 and 22, St. Dunstan's Hill, E.C.\u2014 The business now carried on by Messrs. Gammage & Hollingum was established more than a century ago, and was then known by the title of Messrs. Buck, Fenwick, Se Buck. These gentlemen were succeeded by Messrs. J. Turner, Hunter, & Co., who in turn were followed by the present proprietors. Messrs. Gammage & Hollingum, besides doing a large general trade as wine and spirit mer -chants, are the proprietors of the well-known brand of champagne, \" Buck, Fenwick, & Buck.\" and are also the duly-appointed agents of the old-established house of Filleux Freres, of Cognac. The business premises are very large, and include capacious cellars, stores, sampling-rooms, and a fine suite of handsome offices, remarkably well furnished, and substan tially fitted and appointed. The trade connection is mainly amongst the wholesale dealers of London and the provinces, and a very considerable export business is carried on, especially in rums, with the principal cities in Europe, also with the colonies and other large centres of industry all over the world. The working staff includes several experienced travellers, and numerous clerks and warehousemen. The members of the firm are gentlemen of great experience and ripe judgment, well known in the City, and looked upon as being unusually fortunate, thriving, and successful. Sedgwick & Wilson, Tailors and Habit Makers, 1a Leadenhall Street, E.C. \u2014 A well-known and deservedly successful firm of tailors and habit makers in the City is that of Messrs. Sedgwick & Wilson. The individual partners, Mr. William Sedgwick and Mr. John Wilson, are natives of Derby, where they had first-class experience in the best trade, and afterwards were for twelve years with A. Monarch Kino, of Cornhill and Begent Street. About six years ago they estab lished themselves at their present address, where by personal attention, and the employment of none but first-class workmen, they have built up"], [166, "182 MODERN LONDON. North London establishment. As a thoroughly representative drapery house it has no rival in the locality, and may stand favourable comparison with the best of our West-end concerns. The business is solely confined to the legitimate trade. Any ordinary observer can see how intimately acquainted the proprietors must be with the best manufacturing houses. In selecting his stock no man consults the wants of his patrons more, and in this way he has earned a degree of confidence that is invaluable to any commercial man. Millinery and dressmaking constitute a heavy item in the operations of the establishment, and in this connection a most select and influential trade is commanded. For woollen goods the house has attained a high degree of celebrity. A large staff is employed, and Mr. Burton gives his undivided attention to every detail. His experience, energy, aud activity richly deserve the success he has attained. Albert Pike, Boot and Shoe Manufacturer, Printing House Yard, Hackney Boad, E. \u2014 There is probably no branch of industry more extensively pursued in East London than boot and shoe manufac turing. In this connection an old-established and highly representative concern is that in the hands of Mr. Albert Pike. This business was established about twenty years ago by the father of the present proprietor, who succeeded to it about five years Bince. The establishment has long been noted for the excellence of its boots and shoes. The quality and style of the ladies' goods, to which the principal attention of the house is devoted, is of a character not often surpassed in the Metropolis or else where, and the specimens of glace Polish buttoned boots, with Louis XV. or Wurtemburg heels, are positively perfect in regard to cut, style, aud finish. Bussian leather goods are also stocked iu many varieties, the tops being both wholly of Bussia leather or in combination with patent leather or glace kid. In the last-mentioned combination we noticed what we conceive the prettiest, as well as the most novel, Bussia boot we have seen since the fashion of using this material came in. It was a laced boot with brown Bussia whole golosh, the edge of the golosh having small and neat scollops, and being self toe-capped, while the legs were cut from a fine quality- of glace kid, the darker material being thus uppermost. The effect of this must be seen to be appreciated. Of the whole of the Bussia goods it may be said that in style and finish they formed a most excep tional collection. In the hands of Mr. Albert Pike, the operations of this house have not been retrogressive ; on the contrary, it has advanced in public favour, and each succeeding year gives fresh proofs of con tinued development. The business is purely a wholesale and export one. To give an idea of the magnitude of its transactions, it may be mentioned that employment is provided for seventy hands, including some ofthe most skilled operatives in the metropolis. Foreign markets draw extensively upon the resources of the house. Mr. Pike is much respected in the trade, and his upright, honourable, and systematic business methods have earned for him the respect and confidence of all who are associated with him. Lion Furnishing Company (Proprietor, P. Freedman), 52, High Street, Stoke Newington, N. \u2014 There is probably no branch of business that has made more rapid strides of recent years than the house furnishing trade. A prominent house in this connection is that in the hands of Mr. P. Freedman, carried on under the style of the Lion Fur nishing Company. These premises are situated at 52, High Street, Stoke Newington, and afford every facility for the large aud representative stock to be exhibited with the greatest possible advantage. No house in North London has made more rapid strides in prosperity. This business was established about twenty years ago at Bristol, but it was not till 1884 that it was transferred to North London, where its operations have already made a most favourable impression, in consequence of the vastness of the stock and the superior manufacture of every article that constitutes it. No further proofs of the excellence of the goods are necessary than the success that has been attained. The premises are spacious and well appointed, and no effort is spared to give the fullest degree of satisfaction to all who patronise the establishment. The hire system is the great feature of the house, and is carried on on the most liberal principles. The branches are : The Standard Furnishing Company, 198, The Grove, Stratford, E. ; The Canning Town Furnishing Company, 37, 39, and 41, Bathbone Street, Canning Town, E. ; The Woolwich Furnishing Company, 49, Artillery Place, Woolwich ; The Victoria Furnishing Company, Green Street, Upton Park ; and the Deptford Furnishing Company, New Cross Boad, Deptford. In this way confidence has been ensured, and the pros perity of the business cannot fail to follow. Energy, activity, and enter prise have characterised the management of Mr. Freedman, and no one can envy him the success he has attained. Fred. E. Smith, Purveyor of Fruit and Vegetables, 649 and 651, Holloway Boad, N. \u2014 A trade of enormous magnitude and employing many establishments is that of fruit aud vegetables, and it is in able and experienced bands in the metropolis. A thoroughly repre sentative house in this business is that of Mr. Frederick E. Smith, which was founded by the present proprietor in 1857. The business has greatly increased, and it is one of the largest and best-conducted businesses in the north of London The premises occupied are very extensive, and admirably fitted to meet the trade requirements. The extensive trade necessitates a very large stock of fruit, vegetables, and flowers, which is daily procured from the leading sources ; and Mr. Fred. E. Smith has an excellent reputation for the quality of his goods. A feature of the house is that it supplies every fruit, vegetable, and flower in season as early as they can be obtained in the City and the West-end ; and Mr. Fred. E. Smith also arranges flowers and fruit for wedding, ball, or supper parties, and displays great taste therein. He carries on a very heavy wholesale trade in potatoes, fruit, and vegetables, and has a very extensive family connection extending over the greater part of the north of London. The connection is waited upon daily- for orders, an ample staff is employed, and the management throughout is able and enterprising. Mr. Fred. E. Smith thoroughly understands the trade, and enjoys universal respect and confidence for his honourable methods and courtesy. F. Fletcher & Co., Manufacturers and Importers of Tobacco, Cigars, and Snuff, 104, Caledonian Boad, Islington, N. \u2014 Among the many industries carried on in London, few are of greater importance than the manufacture of tobacco, cigars, and snuff. A capital example of a flourishing house in this trade is afforded by that of Messrs. F. Fletcher & Co., which was founded by the present proprietors six years ago. The premises occupied are extensive, and consist of factory and retail shop adjoining. A large force of skilled hands is employed. The principal tobacco cut and sold is Virginia shag, and the cigars and tobaccos of this firm are highly esteemed for quality, purity, and fragrance. Messrs. F. Fletcher & Co. also import large quantities of cigars of the most noted brands, in which they carry on business as merchants. The retail shop contains a very heavy stock of tobaccos, cigars, snuff, aud all kinds of smoking requisites. Messrs. F. Fletcher & Co. carry on a very extensive retail aud wholesale town trade, and they also have a very fine connection in the country. They bear the highest reputation for the honourable and straightforward method in which they conduct their business, and they are well known in the trade. T. Huldrian, Art Cabinet Manufacturer, 10, Regent's Bow, Queen's Boad, Dalston, E. \u2014 There is no city in the world that shows greater activity in the manufacture of high-class furniture than London. A rising and highly popular concern in this trade is that of Mr. T. Huldrian, whose spacious and well-appointed premises are admirably located. This business was established about five years ago, and from the very date of its inception it has made rapid strides, in consequence of the superior character of its productions. In the manufacture of high-class art cabinet work, such as carved and inlaid ivory sideboards and book eases, the productions of this house have scarcely a rival. Some of the best West-end houses are supplied by the establishment, besides an influ ential connection that has been established with private and distinguished families in all parts of the metropolis. No concern cau show a more favourable record of its operations in such a short time. The proprietor is a most practical workman, and no one applies himself with greater activity- to the duties of his office. He is active, energetic, and highly popular, and his success is the outcome of honest industry and hard work. W. S. Bourlet, Pianoforte Manufacturer, 69, Canonbury Boad, Islington, N. \u2014 Pianoforte manufacturing constitutes a most impor tant item in the general trade of the metropolis. A prominent North London house in this connection is that carried on by Mr. W. S. Bourlet, whose premises are extensive and imposing. This busiuess was established thirty years ago at Theberton Street, N., and was afterwards removed to City Boad ; and after many years of successful occupation of the premises there, the management again decided on returning to their original \u25a0 location, where they made vast improvements. Showrooms were subse quently opened at Canonbury Boad, where some elegant specimens of the productions of the concern may be observed. In the manufacture of instruments of a superior order, combining intrinsic value and use with ornament, this house has long held a most prominent position in therauks of the trade, and its goods find a ready sale in any market in the kingdom. The best and most practical proofs of the merits of the instruments is found in the liberal support and patronage which are extended to the estab lishment. The premises are excellently fitted, and display in no incon siderable manner the careful and judicious management that has been bestowed upon every operation of the concern. The proprietor is well known in the ranks of the trade, and his upright and honourable business methods have earned for him considerable popularity. F. W. Barton, General Draper and Silk Mercer, 57 and 59, Stroud Green Boad, Finsbury Park, N. \u2014 In drawing attention to the commercial houses of North London, it is but fair to make special mention of a most reputable and highly representative concern like that carried on by Mr. F. W. Burton. This business was established about eleven years ago, and even while in its infancy assumed a degree of prominence and popularity unprecedented in the history of any other"], [167, "MODERN LONDON. 183 The London Metallic Capsule Company, Limited, 61, Gracechurch Street, E.C. \u2014 There are few articles more nearly indispen sable to the purposes of the wine, spirit, and beer bottling trade than metallic capsules, which serve at once the double end of an effective seal and a protection against fraudulent tampering with the contents of the bottle upon which they are placed. The metallic capsules most generally in use in this country were, until a recent date, manufactured by the original patentee, Mr. Betts (now Messrs. Betts & Co.), Limited, but the patent having expired, there has lately been formed the London Metallic Capsule Company, with offices at 392, liotherhithe Street, Charles Lynes, Court, Diplomatic, Naval, and Military Tailor, 81, Gracechurch Street, London, E.C. \u2014 Twenty-one years ago was founded by its present proprietor the well-known house of Charles Lynes, court, diplomatic, and country gentlemen's tailor.

Here very extensive and well-assorted stocks of fashionable goods are held, embracing materials in all the newest shades and designs ; and it is upon inspection of this comprehensive display of first-class and highly attractive fabrics that the advantages of the excellent method upon which the business of the house is con- ducted become strongly manifest. For many years S&V.^ -i- Mr. Lynes' system has had for its prime object the rgijj&J establishment of a pers eet mutual confidence between himself and his patrons, and in no way has he found this to be more satisfactorily accomplished than by, first of all, purchasing his goods in the best markets at ready money figures, and, second, by selling them upon the same principles, charging only the lowest y remunerative profit, and dispensing, both in his deal- ~~~~1~ ings with manufacturer and customer, with credit ~PW, \"SJJT . and its attendant high prices.

Botherhithe, S.E. The fresh energy and renewed vigour thus infused into the work have been productive of the best results in an improved manufacture and an increased trade. The company have taken up the business with great enterprise and spirit, and have spared no effort or expense, procuring the most modern machinery in making their pro ductions worthy of the much-extended countenance they are now re ceiving. Improvements must come in time to act beneficially upon any branch of industry, and the metallic capsules are now manufactured in a wide variety of forms, sizes, and colours, suitable for all bottle uses, either in the wine, spirit, beer, vinegar, pickles, drug, or other trades, and with many improved features calculated to greatly enhance their value and utility.

Brown, Kruse, & Co., timber merchants, of the above address, was founded about twenty years ago by Mr. Brown, who still retains his post as principal partner in the firm. When Mr. Brown put up his sawing and planing mills here a score of years since the locality was quite open country, and the populous streets of houses that have since appeared, and now surround his works, have been to a large extent built by him. In the special department of industry carried on at the Ph\u0153nix Mills \u2014 the execution of all kinds of joinery work forthe fitting up of ships' cabins, saloons, &c. \u2014 Messrs. Brown & Kruse are a leading firm. This department may be set down as the great speciality of the house, and the mills have been equipped with a particular care in order to ensure the proper carrying out of every description of work.

Sash work also is a very important feature, and is carried on by Messrs. Brown, Kruse, & Co. upon a scale of magnitude probably unsurpassed. Mention must, however, be made of the very superior class of machinery in operation in the various departments. A finer plant of moulding machinery it would not be possible to find in the metropolis, and the mouldings produced by its aid are of a character and quality fully com mensurate with the marked excellence and effective power of this costly apparatus. The plants of sawing and planing machinery are also of a very high order. All kinds of sawing and planing work is carried on. Power is transmitted to the machinery by two separate engines and boilers placed in different parts of the works, and the general working facilities of the establishment touch perfection at every point.

Browne), Manufacturing and Work ing* Cutler, &.C., 386, Mare Street, Hackney, E. \u2014 Among the many branches of industry carried on in London, a principal place is held by the manufacture of cutlery. The trade in cutlery is of course of immense value, and many establishments are engaged therein, though few manufac ture. An admirable example of the latter class is the business of Mr. W. Knight (late B. Browne), which was founded about twenty years ago. Mr. W. Knight is a most expert manufacturing cutler, and he also carries on business as a silversmith. The premises, consisting of shop and work ing department, are extensive, and admirably fitted up with all modern appliances. The shop contains a very heavy stock of cutlery of all kinds. Tailors' shears and scissors form the speciality of the business, and table knives, &c. are manufactured by able and experienced hands from superior steel and ivory. Mr. W. Knight's shears took a prize in 1879 for excellence, and there is on view some fine specimens of workmanship in the shape of table knives and forks in pearl, which in 1883 gained a certificate of merit. Mr. W. Knight undertakes the grinding and repair ing of cutlery, razors, and scissors, and the work is carried out in first class style. He conducts a very lucrative business. There can be no question of Mr. W. Knight's talent and knowledge of his trade, and he is highly respected. It may be mentioned also that he is the agent for Henry Laurance's improved and celebrated spectacles. The manufac turing and engine rooms are conveniently placed, and one of Otto's gas engines provides ample power. The name of Browne is still retained, although Mr. Knight, who previously managed for Mr. Browne, has taken over the business for some years. In addition to the honours already mentioned, a certificate of merit was awarded to Mr. Knight in May 1886 at the Art and Industrial Exhibition held at St. John-at-Hackney, for a superb case of mother-of-pearl-handled carvers and other cutlery.

The proprietor of this notable depot occupies the whole of a fine four-story building, with large and handsome double-fronted shop and showrooms on the ground floor. Here an ever varying and always attractive display is made of complete suites of house, school, church, and chapel furniture, bedsteads and bedding, ironmongery, crockery, and all kinds of domestic requisites of a like useful nature, carpets in great variety, door-mats and mattings, and, in fact, every description of household equipment. Large manufacturing operations are conducted on the premises, most of the goods in the above named lines being produced in the workshops of the house ; and a reputa tion of enviable eminence has been acquired for the constructive superiority and material soundness of all items in the extensive and diversified stocks.

Alfred & Son, Fishing Tackle Manufacturers, 20, Moorgate Street, E.C. \u2014 There is no establishment in the City that possesses greater attractions for the modern disciples of good Izaak Walton in the piscatorial art than that controlled by the old and well known firm of Messrs. Alfred & Son, at 20, Moorgate Street, E.C. This notable and extensive business was founded as far back as the year 1819, by Mr. William Henry Alfred, whose son and grandson now conduct its affairs under the title given above. The premises comprise a large and commodious shop, situate not far from the Bank, and are familiar to amateur fishermen, far and near, under their characteristic sign of * The Fish and the Float.\" The firm hold a very extensive, varied, and valuable stock of superior goods.

The business is one of the first of its kind in London, and the trade controlled extends to all parts ofthe world, including a very large and valuable country and colonial connection. Messrs. Alfred & Son won gold medals for their goods at the exhibitions of 1880 and 1881, and silver medals, special prizes, and diplomas at those of 1877, 1882, and 1883 ; and they hold the honour of a special appointment to His Boyal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh. J. Jones & Co., Cork Manufacturers and Importers of Foreign Corks, 5, King Street, E.C. \u2014 The wholesale cork trade consti tutes a most important branch of commercial activity, and a well-known house in this trade is that of Messrs. J. Jones & Co. This house was founded in 1848, and from its very inception has steadily prospered and grown apace. The premises occupied at 5, King Street are very spacious and commodious, admirably arranged, and equipped throughout with every facility and convenience. Employment is given to a staff of skilled assistants. The firm manufactures all kinds and sizes of corks, and they hold a large stock of the same, together with the machines and various accessories of a bottling cellar. They do an extensive wholesale trade throughout the United Kingdom, and with the superior facilities at their command they are enabled to offer special advantages to customers, and to execute all orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner, and the success they arc achieving is both substantial and well deserved. G. Butt & Co., Picture Frame and Looking Glass Manufacturers, 53, Great Eastern Street, E.C. \u2014 A very important branch of the furniture trade is the manufacture of picture frames and looking glasses. Prominent amongst metropolitan houses engaged in this trade is Messrs. George Butt & Co.

Squire & Son's Pianofortes.\u2014 There are a few, and only a very few, pianoforte manufacturers of fifty years' standing whose instru ments have sustained the wear of more than a generation and are equal to any that have been made, amongst whom Messrs. B. Squire & Son, of Stanhope Street, Euston Boad, London, stand in the front rank. Their pianos of the present day, taking them in their entirety, are ahead of their competitors ; indeed, we look in vain to find them equalled among the moderate-priced pianos offered to the public. The fact that some of the most respectable and eminent music sellers in the country have had thousands of Messrs. B. Squire & Son's pianos is a testimony to the high class workmanship and the highly scientific principles of their construc tion. The founder of the firm, one of the cleverest men of his day, was skilful, ingenious, and thorough. Many of those improvements which have been generally adopted in the trade were due to his introduction, and not a few inventions were the product of his brain. Among them are a simple but effective check repeater action, known by another name than his, and very much in use in the present day ; also a compensating tubular back or frame, which kept the instrument in tune under variation of temperature better than any other construction. The present enterprising principal, son and pupil of the founder, is as thorough and efficient as his predecessor, producing pianos of great excellence in durability, tone, finish, and design, in elegant taste, pleasing at once the three senses \u2014 touch, hearing, and sight. During the past fifty years many pianoforte manufacturing firms have been established and disappeared, but the firm of B. Squire & Son have not only held their ground but materially advanced, and no doubt the secret of their success has been that they have been ever on the alert to move with the times and to keep to the front in the quality of their instruments, giving careful attention to the minutest details. The competition in the pianoforte business is very keen, and as it is subject to all the subtleties and far-reaching ideals and excellence of musical criticism, a constant progress in general quality and firmness of instru ment are more imperatively demanded than in almost any other branch of manufacture. But it does not follow that the best instrument makers are always found in the most fashionable centres. On the contrary, it is often, not to say generally, found in England, as in France and Germany, and other Continental countries, that people have to look for the makers of the best pianofortes away from aristocratic quarters. Ainong those who have distinguished themselves as first-class makers of pianofortes, especially in recent years, may be mentioned Messrs. B. Squire & Son, whose instruments have gained a widespread reputation for their purity of tone, elasticity of touch, and superior workmanship. The prices of their pianofortes range from the lowest price possible, consistent with quality, so that it may be judged that they fulfil very perfectly the requirements of the musical world. Their pianos specially constructed for India and other adverse climates are known as the best ever found in these climes, and those who possess them strongly recommend them to their friends. the walls of this neat and imposing establishment. On all local topics Mr. Crouch is a recognised authority. The success of the business has been accounted for in many ways, but principally through the superiority of the workmanship in all the departments, while scrupulous cleanliness contributes materially to the popularity of a concern of this description. A varied business is transacted, such as the manufacture of albert chains, hracelets, brooches, earrings, and other fancy hair-work. Every descrip tion of hairdressing and combing on superior and improved principles is also carried on by competent workmen. Ear piercing is made a speciality. They are patronised by some of the most fashionable and influential families in the north of London, and high testimony is always borne to the excellence of their work. The proprietors are highly respected in the neighbourhood, and they have the confidence of all who are associated with them. R. & A. Spalding, Printers and Engravers, 46, High Street, Notting Hill, W. \u2014 Among the trades and industries of the western metropolitan district, most adequate representation is accorded to the ancient and honourable craft of the printer by the well-known and old established house of Messrs. B. & A. Spalding, general and artistic printers and engravers. This notable firm was founded in 1847. The sole proprietor is Mr. B. Spalding. The premises occupied are large and well-appointed throughout. A very large and attractive stock is held, which embraces all kinds of fine fancy stationery, menus, ball pro grammes, invitation cards, and similar specialities, whose printed, en graved, or embossed portions are all executed in that finely finished and truly artistic manner which has made the work of this establishment famous. Art printing, engraving in the highest style and best taste, relief stamping, and heraldic work constitute the leading features of Messrs. Spalding's operations. The business of the firm is conducted with exemplary energy and ability ; a large general trade is controlled ; and it is gratifying to note a continuous expansion of the well-established and valuable connection it has always been the good fortune of Messrs. Spalding to merit and enjoy. J. Downton & Co., Engineers, Boiler Makers, Copper smiths, Brassfounders, &.C., 71, West India Dock Eoad, E. \u2014 There is a vast amount of industrial activity and energy centred in and around the busy West India Dock Boad and the locality that lies on either side of that thoroughfare. This activity finds its chief stimulus in the great shipping trade ofthe port, and consequently the industries en gaged in are of a nature bearing close relation to marine matters. Engineering, boiler making, copper smithing, brassfound ing, plumbing, and shipsmithing are repre sented by many notable firms, and of such firms there are very few of greater prominence than that of Messrs. J. Downton & Co. This is an exceedingly extensive and \" The Franco \" Dry - Cleaning Sanitary Laundry (leon et Cie., Proprietors), 8, Devonshire Terrace, Bayswater, W. \u2014 An eminent establishment in its line is \" The Franco Sanitary Laundry,\" which was founded some twelve years ago. The premises utilised as a laundry and dyeing and cleaning works are admirably adapted to the business, and comprise a neatly-fixtured order-receiving office, with a spacious saloon in the rear, divided into various sections, and well fixtured for all the numerous processes to which articles and fabrics treated by the company's process are subjected. The scope of -(Jie company's general work includes the getting up in a superior style of all and every class of ladies' and gentlemen's linen requisites, as well as children's, servants', and general household fabrics. The great speciality of the house, for which it has attained considerable notoriety, is the dressing of shirts and collars, in which branch they have done a large business for a considerable time with leading City linen houses. The shirts and collars redressed in all cases have the appearance of new articles. Goods of all kinds are dyed and cleaned by the French process. Ladies' dresses, costumes, lace and other curtains, are cleaned by- this process. All carpets, tapestry, draperies, hangings, &c. are cleaned by a steam process upon the shortest notice. Bed furniture and crumb cloths of all descriptions and sizes are calendered, and dyeing and cleaning of all descriptions expeditiously performed ; while shirts, collars, and cuffs are made to measure and repaired. A full staff of experienced assistants are permanently employed, and a hi^h-class trade is done among the aristocracy and the upper classes. The gentlemen constituting the firm are of the highest commercial status, and the gentleman acting in the capacity of manager is practically acquainted with all the details of the trade, and highly respected for his urbanity and courtesy by the patrons of the establishment. well-conducted business, dealing, in its operations, with every one of the several important branches of industry just named, and achieving a marked and continuous success in all of them. The house was established forty years ago, and has had a career of steady prosperity from the first, engaging at all times upon an extensive scale in every branch of general engineering and shipping work in copper, brass, and iron. Messrs. Downton's great speciality, however, consists in the manufacture of portable fire engines for passenger and emigrant ships, and in this connection there is no name which is better known or has associated with it a higher reputation than that of Downton. The engines supplied by this firm are not surpassed for efficiency and all-round worth by any similar apparatus yet introduced, and their high position in the favour and estimation of the shipping community- is an ample testimonial to their merits. Underlined water-closets for yachts and steamers are also prominent among the successful specialities of the house, and these closets are so constructed that pumps become unnecessary for cleansing purposes, their position being such that a constant current of water through and through is maintained. Pumps of various kinds are likewise notable features of Messrs. Downton's manufacture, and for whatever purpose they are supplied they are marked by a general excellence that distinguishes every production of this old and well-known firm. The whole business is to be cited as an excellent type of a well-developed and capably directed marine engineering concern, comprehensive in its opera tions, and thoroughly representative of each and every department com prised in its system of undertakings. The premises in West India Dock Boad are extensive and admirably equipped, and the firm have also their own foundry, and very large and well-appointed works at Boyal Victoria and Albert Docks, Becktou. The business connections of the house are widespread aud valuable, taking effect among the principal ship owners and steamship companies of London ; and all its affairs receive the personal attention of Mr. Downton, whose long experience and practical skill are reflected in every feature of his able and judicious administration of this important industrial concern.

The Bag Manufacturing Supply Association, Limited, 21, Moor Lane, E.C. \u2014 For more reasons than one the well-known insti tution trading under the style of the Bag Manufacturing Supply Asso ciation, Limited, with headquarters at 21, Moor Lane, E.C., should hold a post of prominence in any review of representative industries of modern London. It is prominent on account of its important character and extensive manufacturing and trading operations ; but it is, perhaps, still more noteworthy by reason of the fact that iu it are exemplified some of the best results of the application of true and sound co-operative principles to the conduct of a business enterprise. The association was \u25a0founded some eighteen months ago under perfect co-operative conditions, all the workers being partners and shareholders in the undertaking, with the right of sharing the profits, and a full voice in the election of the com mittee of management. The good points of such a system as this have \"been discussed over and over again, and it is not within the province of this brief sketch to comment upon them at any length. Suffice it to say, -that up to the present (as was to be expected) nothing but good and bene ficial issues have resulted from the working of the plan ; the association has practically adopted that true co-operative motto, \" Identification of interest among all workers in production,\" and the outcome of it all has *been marked and gratifying success.

No small degree of the well-merited commercial success that has thus far attended the career of the association is due to the capable and judicious manner in which Mr. Wilkins, the manager to the institution, has discharged his arduous and responsible duties in directing the steps of the young enterprise upon the course of prosperity it promises for the future to unfailingly follow- ; and under his able and energetic supervision the already extensive home and export trade of the associa tion receives constant impetus, and the valuable connections of the -concern are continuously widened and enhanced in importance in all parts of the kingdom and abroad. biased Excelsior, Christmas, and New Year's Flags, of which the pro prietor is the sole maker.

T. & W. Ide, Glass Benders, Silverers, Bevellers, and Merchants, Glasshouse Fields, Batcliff, E. \u2014 The busiuess carried on by Messrs. T. & W. Ide at Glasshouse Fields, Batcliff, was founded in the year 1830, and has been in the hands of its present proprietors for considerably more than a quarter of a century. The business principally consists of glass bending. The firm have the reputation of being the most skilful benders in the United Kingdom. At the works the largest plates of bent glass in use in any part of the world have been treated. As a consequence of this, their business has assumed most extensive proportions. Since the present proprietary came into possession of the business other notable branches have been added, these being bevelling and silvering for the cabinet-making and looking-glass manufacturing trades, together with drilling, embossing, staining, and general glazing. These departments now receive careful attention, and the whole industry is in a condition of admirable development. The works of the house in Glasshouse Fields are very extensive, but the business has increased so rapidly of late as to necessitate considerable enlargements. The entire premises cover nearly one acre, and are exceedingly commodious in all parts. The mechanical equipment of the place is a notable feature, being of the most modern type throughout, and in some cases the appliances and apparatus in use are quite unique, enabling the firm to execute work that could not, most probably, be done elsewhere. The firm give constant employment to a large force of hands. Messrs. T. & W. Ide maintain a far-reaching and valuable connection, their work going to all parts of the civilised world. The Globus, Limited, Contractors for Advertising on Austrian and Hungarian Railways, 14, St. Mary Axe, E.C. \u2014 One of the most noteworthy of recent departures in general advertising is that which has been effected by the successful company operating under the title of The Globus, Limited, with head offices as above. This important organisation was founded about eighteen years ago, and was turned into an English company in January 1887, and its undertakings embrace the fulfilment of contracts for advertising on Austrian and Hungarian rail ways, and on the stations of the Danube Steamship Company. Although of comparatively recent establishment, the business thus inaugurated has already met with a liberal amount of support. The Globus, Limited, has power to display advertisements advantageously on all the most important Austrian and Hungarian lines, and on the numerous stations of the Danube Steamship Company, and admirable opportunities are thus afforded to British advertisers of bringing their names and wares pro minently before the people of the several large districts included in this extensive system. The Globus Company also undertake, when so desired, to render the advertisements entrusted to them for publication into any language or dialect necessary for their proper comprehension by the public iu Austria-Hungary. The Globus, Limited, controls a branch office at 2, Parkring, Vienna. The head-quarters of the oiganisation are at the above-given address in St. Mary Axe, and from the offices here all the operations of the concern are directed. At the present time the Globus has advertisements upon upwards of 600 stations. The managing director of the company is Mr. Walter Henty. The opportunities offered by the Globus open a field for the extension of British industry and trade throughout the Austrian Empire. H. Smith, Wheelwright, Van and Cart Builder, Spring and Tyresmith, 33, Homer Boad, Hackney, E. \u2014 The enormous com merce of the metropolis rendering the employment of vans, carts, &c. indispensable, the builder of such vehicles is provided with a most valu able field for his operations. In this connection an old-established and reliable concern is that carried on under the direction of Mr. H. Smith. This business was taken over by Mr. Smith about five years ago, but the business dates its origin back to 1864. The concern has always been noted for the superiority of its work. As a wheelwright, van and cart builder, Mr. Smith stands pre-eminently the most noted and popular man in the district. He is no less remarkable as a spring and tyresmith, while he also carries on all kinds of builders' and contractors' work. In every capacity he is himself a most competent workman. This is proved by the fact, that for nine years he was in the employment of the London General Omnibus Company, under the able management of Mr. Crane, and in the early part of that time he made the first brake that was applied to a pair-horse omnibus belonging to tbe company, and which ran from Holloway to the City. During five years Mr. Smith continued making and improving these brakes, and practically, at the present time, every bus belonging to the company is fitted with one. The merit of suggesting ideas and improvements, and effectually carrying them out, may fairly be given to Mr. Smith, and the result is a first-class brake. His acknowledged de-sire to give the fullest satisfaction has earned for him the respect and confidence of all who are associated with him. James Chibbett, Fancy and General Draper, &c, Criterion Buildings, 744, Holloway Boad, N. \u2014 The fancy drapery trade of London is distinguished by the large number of first-class establishments devoted to it. A very good business in this direction is that of Mr. James Chibbett. Although it has been established only six months, Mr. James Chibbett has worked up a fine trade. He occupies large handsome pre mises, which have only been recently erected. The shop is commodious and spacious, of very attractive appearance, and fitted up in a most elegant manner with the necessary fixtures and appointments for the trade and for the convenience of patrons. It is well stocked with fancy drapery of every description, and although Mr. James Chibbett pays special atten tion to fancy drapery, he has in stock a very fine assortment of general goods. These are of superior quality. Mr. Chibbett carries on a very considerable trade. By his honourable dealings and courteous demeanour he has won public esteem and confidence, and his house is steadily pro gressing on the road to success.

J. Austin & Co., whose commodious premises are eligibly situated. The firm commenced operations about 1875, and by sound and well-disciplined management has gradually advanced in public favour. Conscientious, upright, and systematic business methods have contributed materially to its present prominence. There are few firms in the metro polis that have greater or more elaborate facilities for the prosecution of their operations. The plant of machinery is one of the largest and most complete in North London.

The premises are of large dimensions, and for arrangement and regularity they cannot be excelled. The proprietors are well known in the trade, and their stability- and general bearing have long since been established. Wm. Ross & Co., Shipowners, Brokers, and General Merchants, 3, East India Avenue, E.C.\u2014 The old-established and well known firm of Messrs. Wm.

Beverting to the early history of this firm, we find that the business was established many years ago in Glasgow, and was subsequently, about twelve years since, removed to London, where at the present address it has since been carried on.

In this connection an important concern is that carried on by Mr. W. Claridge. This business was established about seven years ago, under the style of Claridge Bros., but in 1886 the establishment was transferred to the present premises, and the concern assumed the title of W. Claridge. Whatever changes the management may have undergone, it is a noteworthy fact that the superior character of the business has not suffered. The productions of the concern are highly appreciated, and it is difficult to give even an approximate idea of the large business that is conducted. Smiths' work constitutes an important item in the operations, and in the manufacture of tyres and springs of superior construction! this house has attained some celebrity. The premises are of suitable dimensions, well fitted, and embracing all that is modern in construction and appointments. Mr. Claridge, by his energy and integrity, has earned for himself a widespread popularity.

Its goods are highly appreciated, and many valuable testimonials are held from competent judges, who have for many years patronised the establishment. The best material is used, and the best workmen only are employed, so that the productions of this concern cannot fail to give full satisfaction.

Jones Brothers, General Warehousemen and departments ; stationery, bazaar, and foreign fancy departments ; funeral furnishing and furniture removal departments, all unite to form one of the most perfect and complete establishments in the world. To say that this business is conducted with ability, energy, and enterprise would give but a very inadequate meed of praise to the proprietors, but the ever-extending connection and the continued increase of sales in each department are the surest guarantee of the favour and popularity of this gigantic establishment. Complete House Furnishers, Holloway, N. \u2014 There is scarcely to be found in the commercial world a parallel instance of the success and popularity which have attended the operations of the gigantic establish ment of Messrs. Jones Brothers, general warehousemen and complete house furnishers, a sketch of whose premises appears above. This splen did business was established less than twenty years ago, in a very modest way at first, but, like all institutions possessing real merit, it has grown with a steadiness and increasing stability that have been the admiration of the public, till at the present time it forms an emporium which for ex tent, completeness, and magnitude of its transactions stands unsurpassed in the north of the metropolis. In the construction of the buildings Messrs. Jones Brothers have spared neither pains nor expense, and in the internal arrangements, as regards the economy of time and labour, almost every thing that the ingenuity of man can devise has been earned into effect. It is scarcely possible in writing to do adequate justice to the beauty and elegance of the show-rooms, the sumptuous manner in which they are fitted and upholstered, and the taste displayed in the distribution of the various decorations, but there is one thing that strikes the visitor imme diately on entering this establishment, namely, the unfailing courtesy and politeness of every one connected with the place ; and these distinctive traits of good breeding have the effect of making the visitor at once feel at ease, and the occupation of shopping and the inspection of this vast emporium an unmitigated delight. Messrs. Jones Brothers sell at the lowest possible profit consistent with fair trading, and adhere to the cash system ; but Messrs. Jones Brothers have instituted a system of weekly books, for groceries and provisions only, for well-known customers, which is duly appreciated by many ; another great convenience is the prompt delivery of goods at the purchaser's own residence, irrespective of distance. Every department of this extensive establishment is complete in itself and is presided over by a manager, with a large staff of assistants having a special knowledge of the goods sold by them, and it is calculated that from two to three thousand customers are served daily. A special feature of this establishment is the elegant and beautifully-fitted buffet, or refreshment department, where light refreshments can be obtained by customers at extraordinarily low prices, and supplied with a promptness and politeness which might well be copied by other establishments. Some idea of the magnitude of this emporium may be gathered from a brief sum mary of the various departments. To commence with the basement, the visitor finds the new departments devoted to the glass and china, ironmon gery, and joinery ; proceeding to the grocery and provision departments, in which is displayed an immense stock of every variety of goods in this class. The mantle, shawl, and fur department is replete with every Parisian and Continental novelty ; the show-cases in this room are perfect works of art, by the well-known firm of Messrs.
