The circumstance of your Lordship being one of the lords of the manor : with the way in which this town and neighbourhood expressed their sympathy with your Lordship during the arduous trial for the just re covery of the Shrewsbury Peerage, and the Alton estates ; and the almost unexampled enthusiasm which the town of Uttoxeter displayed on your Lordship's taking possession of your princely inheritance, in the vicinity of Uttoxeter, all so demonstrative of the esteem in which your lordship is held by all cksses, were some of the inducements (with the additional one, that one of your Lordship's ancestors AValter Chetwynd, Esq., of Ingestre, did good ser vice towards a history of this county) which led me to ask your lordships kind patronage to this my book ; and I sincerely trust it will prove, as I have striven it should, that that kind condescension which you have shown has not been bestowed unworthily.

The History of Uttoxeter, now for the first tirna submitted to tbe public, owes its existence to the visit paid to tbe town a few years ago by that distin guished author, Nathaniel Hawthorn, who, out us admiration for the genius of Dr. Samuel Johnson. came into Staffordshire to visit the places at Lich field rendered memorable by circumstances in the Doctor's life, and to see tbe spot \u2014 interesting above all others in connection with bis name \u2014 which he consecrated by his penance and tears at Uttoxeter. In this latter object he was unsuccessful, for no one was able to point out the spot. It had not been described in books, and he returned, lamenting that tbe place bad not been permanently marked by a fitting memorial, The visit to Uttoxeter of so re markable a person, from a distance of three thou sand miles, for such a purpose, and the appearance shortly afterwards of an article from bis talented pen, created an anxiety in the town to recover a knowledge of so deeply interesting a site. The de-"], [10, "VIII PREFACE. sired information was not, however, elicited, although the matter became a subject of discussion in the press. I consider myself fortunate, through my own enquiries, in being enabled to put the identity of the place of tbe Doctor's penance beyond question. Tbe discovery interested me, and I was led by curiosity, from gathering up some of the traditions of the town, to a more serious enquiry into its pre-historic annals and authentic history. I had not, at first, even the most remote conception of writing a history, nor am I aware of any stimulus that I received, further than the discovery about Dr. Johnson. My research es, in the course of time, brought me a consider able quantity of material, when, as I found no history of the town existed, I bethought me I might attempt to write one. Thus the present history of Uttoxeter has merged into shape. Of the importance of a history of a market-town so ancient as Uttoxeter there cannot be any doubt. Mr. Ward, the laborious author of the \" History of Stoke-upon-Trent,\" has said, \" Every commercial dis trict, large parish, borough, or rural circle, should have its particular history ;\" and a writer in the \" Manchester Examiner,\" February 18th, 1862, in noticing the \" Annals of Kendal,\" evinces his own love of local lore \u2014 a love somehow embedded in hu man * generally \u2014 by these encouraging obser-"], [11, "PREFACE. IX vations \u2014 \" There is scarcely a village or market town throughout Great Britain that would be void of interesting material for historical record, if earnest enquiry were made by some local student.\" The execution of the work is a subject of which the public must be the judge \u2014 it must speak for it self. But I may venture to say that I have not spared any pains to make it complete and interesting, and I hope that I have succeeded in this in a man ner not only to ensure it a welcome in tbe neigh bourhood, but to give it a generally favourable recep tion. To tbe critic, I beg to observe that it is not the production of a person either devoted to a literary calbng, or bving in worldly ease. Being employed as I am, at a mechanical trade, I have been able to devote but very bttle time to its compilation except at nights, after the suspension of labour. In award ing to it, therefore, praise or blame, I would beg that the circumstances under which the History has been produced may be considered. Only for these cir cumstances I would not so far have referred to my self; but these rendered it necessary, and I must plead them as an apology for doing so. In the prospectus wiiich I issued, I promised an appendix to the present volume, and its non-appear ance will require a word of explanation. After, as I thought, I bad finished the work, the \" Survey of"], [12, "X PREFACE. Uttoxeter,\" in MS., by Peter Lightfoot, physician, fell into my hands, and knowing very well what the labour of re-writing the book would be, I resolved to add what interesting matter it contained in an ap pendix. I, however, afterwards, changed my deter mination ; and in writing the History over again, so as to include in it what was valuable in the \" Sur vey,\" I have been enabled, likewise, to improve it in many other respects. I ha-e, already, some reason to believe that the work will not be uninter esting and useless, and this is some satisfaction, if there is no other, for the toil it has involved. The notices of the places in the neighbourhood are brief, but as a whole I think they will be found more complete in the mention of what is curious, and more generally interesting, than any other simi lar notices that have yet appeared. The old plan of Uttoxeter, taken by Dr. Peter Lightfoot, in 1658, of which a fac-simile is given, will be found very interesting ; and the number of engravings will greatly enhance the attraction of the book. The old Grammar School of Alleyne I have not had engraved, although it was promised ; for as it was not the original school-house, but a very plain and more modern brick build ing, it did not possess sufficient interest for an il lustration. To compensate for this, I have, however,"], [13, "PREFACE. XI substitued several other subjects of antiquity of real interest. My thanks are due to Messrs.

Uttoxeter is situated on the eastern borders of Staf fordshu-e (derived, according to Sir Symon Degge's notes to Plott, from Stadeford, the strand shore or bank of a ford) in Totmanslow south, and in the ec clesiastical jurisdiction of the See of Lichfield. It is distant fifteen miles from the county town, and about one hundred and forty from London. The parish consists of Crakemarsh, Creighton, Stramshall, the Woodlands, and the liberty of Loxley, and con-"], [22, "4 HISTORY OF tains about 10,000 acres of land; 2,460 of which are in the township of Uttoxeter; 1,735 in Loxley; 1,066 in Crakemarsh; 1,274 in StramshaU, and 2,419 in the Woodlands. Uttoxeter has an elevated position, to which is due its famed salubrity. The market place lies in a cen tral part of the town, and the main streets have a direct communication with it. These are, High Street having a northern direction, from wiiich, at Uttoxeter Heath, are branch roads to Ashbourne and the Potteries ; Carter Street and Balance Street to wards the wesst, for Stafford and Abbots Bromley ; the Doveridge road on the east for Derby and Bur ton ; and Schoolhouse Lane or Bridge Street, (in which is situated the passenger station of the North Staf fordshire line of railway,) on the south, leading to Marchington and other villages. The Stone-way is reached by Smithy Lane out of High Street, and Tinker's or Susan's Lane out of Carter Street. There are two lanes taking a southward direction from Balance Street, which, although formerly but little frequented, have latterly become busy thoroughfares for traffic from the railway luggage station. These are cabed Pinfold Lane and Spicer's, Spiceall, or Petticoat Lane. The passenger station at Uttoxeter on the Churnet Valley line of railway is at Bull's Bank on the Doveridge road. The derivation of the name, Uttoxeter, has never been satisfactorily ascertained, and bas formed a per plexing question to the etymologist. Indeed, but few persons have attempted it, but have contented them-"], [23, "5 UTTOXETER. selves with simply acknowledging the difficulty with which it is surrounded. The Wotocheshede of Dooms day book has been supposed to be derived from Wudu (wood) and Seade (shade) (1) but then this has been asserted not to have been the name of Uttoxeter as spelt by the Saxons. There are few, perhaps not any, towns whose name has been .spelt in such a variety of ways, and this of itself is sufficient to make its solution perplexing to most people. It is written Uttoxeshather, Utcester, Uttokcester, and Ulcester, besides its common form of Uttoxeter ; and in converse it is pronounced as Utceter, Uxeter, and Utcheter as weU as popularly, Uttoxeter. Assuming the name in Doomsday book to be incorrect, \u2014 and it is well known that great difficulties occur in correctly appro priating tbe names of places as they are written in that invaluable document \u2014 it is so from one of two causes, either that the Norman scribes wilfully perverted the spelling of places through their antipathy to the Saxons, or did so through their ignorance of the lan gauage from which, chiefly, the names of places had been derived. There would, therefore, appear to be no alternative but to accept the name as given by Leland, Camden, and Holbn.shead, and which Cam den states is its Saxon name ; this is, Uttok-cester. The termination is of course from the Latin castrum, a camp, and the prefix has been stated to be derived from the Saxon mattock, a term significant of any place having been disforested or cleared of trees by (1) Ward's History of Stoke-upon-Trent."], [24, "6 HISTORY OF the mattock, or some similar implement of hus bandry. As, however, places where such operations by such implements have been effected, are, literally, both on the Continent and in England, called field'-11 or felled place, that opinion will not be re ceived. The Saxon word stocca, meaning the trunk or stem of a tree, appears much more likely to be its origin. If so, Uttoxeter may signify a town built of wood or on stocks, or surrounded by a stockade, where the Eomans previously had a camp. The prefix has also been supposed to mean an out-take from the forest of Needwood ; but this can scarcely be on the opinion that the site of Uttoxeter was a British settlement, and afterwards a Eoman station before the Saxon occupation of it, for the Saxons would not have given it a name to imply an out-take from a wood unless it had been made by themselves. Neither, for the same reason, can it signify an out-take from a chase for which the word forest was anciently used. It is more agreeable to suppose that the ex pression means that the town was taken out of a camp, or that it is expressive of a camp from which the Romans- have departed.'2' Another view, bow ever, remains to be taken of the prefix, which is afforded in another name by which Uttoxeter is de signated. That name is Tocester,*3' about the mean ing of which there can be no dispute, the To evidently being a variation of Toot or Teut, and implying the fl) Paedutes in Hogg's Instructor. (2) \"Verstigan's Restitution of Decayed Intelligence. (3) Grand Gazeteer."], [25, "7 UTTOXETER. Tootcester, or castra situated near the altar dedicated to Teut. I am inclined to believe that this is the meaning intended to be conveyed in the Woto in Doomsday book. The castra of the Romans is also fo be seen in the cheshede in the same ancient survey, for wherever the Roman Stativ\u00e6(1) were and were so called, the word sede was understood, which meant the same thing as camp. The neighbourhood of Uttoxeter is exceedingly pleasant, its scenery being greatly diversified and filled with sylvan beauty. Its immediate vicinity is remarkable for the number of old lanes, as well as footpaths along the fields, so primitive and rural in their character, and so tempting for a quiet stroU at almost any season and in almost any state of feebng. The High Wood, a little distance to the south of the town, (so called because of its elevation, and from its having formed part of Needwood Forest,) affords some really fine prospects of the surroimding country. From hence, Needwood Forest, extending along un dulating cbffs sweeping down to the south, bfts itself into view, although its grandeur becomes more evi dent as it is approached, particularly in the Wood lands, at the new church, where the scene is one of the richest magnificence. It is, however, to the north from the High Wood that the view is tbe most exten sive and varied. Uttoxeter presents itself on an eminence rising out of a vast basin, the church spire shooting high above all other surrounding buildings.

Owing to the opening of this valley to Ashbourne, Brassington moors and remoter portions of the mountainous tract of north Derbyshire can also be dimly observed in the blue mists of the horizon. There are many charming woody declivities lying about Loxley, but they must be visited to be appre ciated. They may be most favourably viewed on the way to Bramshall and on reaching the ridge on the west side of that village. Perhaps the most interesting features belonging to the valley of the Dove by Uttoxeter are its vast extent and its fertility. Here it expands into many thousand acres of the most productive meadow and grazing land. Leland testified that \" there be wonderful pastures by the Dove.\" This characteristic of the valley has also given existence to various popular sayings, one of wiiich is that \" if a stick be laid down there over-night in spring it will not be found for grass the next morning,\" and in being taken as the standard by which to judge of other land in the kingdom, it has been said, \" it is nearly as good as Dove land.\" It has been further asserted, and probably without any exaggeration, that before the land in the country was cultivated, there was no fat meat in it but what came from the Dove. The wonderful qualities of the land so eulogised are owing to the floods ofthe river \u2014 \"the British Nile\" \u2014 which"], [29, "UTTOXETER. 11 are sometimes sudden and of considerable extent, nearly inundating the whole vaUey, and carrying off sheep and sometimes cattle before any danger is sus pected. A single night, by the melting of snow on the hills, or by a heavy fall of rain, which soon swells both the rivers Churnet and the Dove as well as the Tean brook, which unite then separate volumes before reaching Uttoxeter, readily serves to cause these un expected floods which produce the fertility which has given such fame to the land at Uttoxeter and along the valley for many miles. Hence the saying \u2014\" In April, Dove's flood is worth a king's good.\"-1' Down yon mid dale the British Nile, Fair Dove, comes winding many a mile, And from her copious urn distils The fatness of a thousand hills. \u2014 Needwood Forest. The geology of the neighbourhood of Uttoxeter, an account of which it may be thought ought to have preceded the description of its scenery, may not af ford any very striking points of interest except to those engaged in a patient study of the science. Ut toxeter is built upon what is geologically termed the drift formation, which belongs to the upper tertiary epoch and immediately beneath the materials of the aUuvium. The whole of this kingdom, as well as Europe, except the highest parts, have been sub merged beneath the sea, and the drift is taken as evi dence of a strong current from north to south. It consists of boulders and clay, large blocks of rock, (1) See Plotts', Shaw's, and Nightingale's Histories of Staffordshire, and Leigh's History of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire."], [30, "12 HISTORY OF and accumulations of gravel. The larger materials are considered to have been conveyed from their na tive position in the north in vast masses of ice, which on dissolving have deposited their stony freight at great distances south of where they are naturally found. The gravel contains smaU boulders, sup posed to have been deposited towards the close of the subsidence of the watery element. Uttoxeter itself stands upon a bed of gravel, which appears to ter minate at the lower edge of the town, on the south. The hiUs immediately at each side of the town are of clay and marl. The High Wood running along the south of Uttoxeter consists of clay with large boulders, and in some places, gravel and sand, and others marl. Amongst the boulders are large quan tities of slightly abraided pieces of limestone, and on the top of the High Wood may be found portions many pounds weight. In going along the road from the High Fields, these may be observed lying out on the road sides, and can scarcely have been conveyed there by any natural laws than those wiiich accom panied the drift period. At Oldfield, where excava tions for a new residence have recently been made, pieces of rounded rock, half a hundred weight or more in size, have been dug up. Tbe gravel and boulders afford specimens of most kind of rocks, and from amongst them I have picked up several limestone specimens containing encrinites and bivalves. I have also seen several broken pieces of fossil bone of con siderable thickness from the gravel or drift at Ut toxeter, and their vicinity has been marked by ap-"], [31, "UTTOXETER. 13 pearances, intermingling with the debris, very much resembbng pieces of oxidized copper, bluish in colour, as if they had originally been small and thin copper corns. A very deep drain, perhaps ten or twelve feet deep, was being made in Carter Street last summer, in the previously undisturbed strata, when several fragments of bone of great thickness were met with, as well as the other appearances described. These would appear to be the result of the carbonization of animal substances, similar to those recently discovered by Mr. E. Brown, at Burton-on-Trent, an account of which was read at a recent meeting of the \" Midland Scientific Association,\" at Derby. \u25a01) In Marchington Woodlands the tertiary system has afforded a remark able fossil of the proboscidian tribe, found beneath a bed of marl twenty-one feet in thickness, which, from its dark boggy appearance, must have originaUy been the bed of an ancient lake. The fossil was found by the late Mr. Hall, while sinking a well, but he was prevented from making further search for water by coming upon this dark inky-looking secbment. The whole skeleton of the fossil animal was supposed to have been there embedded, but no part of it was got away with the exception of what was supposed to be the horn of an elk, and it was wrenched off by the aid of a horse and chain. The size of the so-called horn is four feet six inches long, but it has been longer. It is about twelve or fourteen inches in circumferance, and its concentric formation, weight, and slight cur- (li Printed in the \"Reliquary\" Quarterly Journal, vol. 2, p. 206."], [32, "14 HISTORY OF vature only indicate it to be an appendage of some other gigantic creature \u2014 perhaps of the mastodon. When found it was stated to have been richly gilded, an appearance produced by the presence of pyrites or sulphuret of iron. With an account of an interesting discovery shortly to be noticed, I sent a description of the so-called horn to the late Mr. T.

The beautiful metallic appearance he also regarded as singular, as it is more generaby to be found upon fossils of the eocene, the lower tertiary, and oolite days. The tusk is pre served by the son of Mr. Hab1. The vaUey of the Dove consists of the alluvium or post tertiary accumulations in which horns, said in variably to be those of the extinct elk, but wiiich are antlers of the deer, are frequently met with. They have been found at Eaton, and twelve feet in the earth at Eocester. One of the most interesting dis coveries yet made in this superficial deposit by the Dove, and not recorded before, took place a few years since at the Eyes, near Sudbury, in a cutting then in process of making. Along with the antlers of a deer were two trunks of bog-oak \u2014 each twenty feet long \u2014 and a human skull. The skuU is that of a female. This discovery gives rise to several interesting specu lations, and bad the late learned Mr. Bateman been spared, it probably would have formed the subject ot a paper in the \" Rebquary,\" in continuation of a"], [33, ""], [34, "REMAINS FOUND AT SUDBURY."], [35, "UTTOXETER. 15 previous interesting and valuable one by him on the \" Extinct Animals of Derbyshire in their relation to Man,\" which appeared in that valuable antiquarian miscellany. Whether the person, of whom the skull is a portion of the remains, became accidentally en tombed in a bog, or was the victim ofthe Scandinavian punishment of being buried alive in a bog, (to which females were subjected) it would be difficult to decide. It may be said, however, that the discovery does not clash with, but adds confirmation to, the accounts of the late appearance of man upon the present scene, and associates him with this island, and this neigh bourhood in particular, at a very remote period. The skull aud antlers are preserved amongst other curio sities at Sudbury HaU, the seat of Lord Vernon. Mineral springs are incbcative of particular strata, and of these there are several within a few miles of Uttoxeter.

John Bolton Rogerson. It has been common for topographical writers to suspect that Uttoxeter was a British settlement before the Eoman occupation of this island. None, how ever, have yet attempted to furnish any information or reason in support of such a suspicion. Of course there is no historical evidence to be had, but at the same time there are various interesting circum stances which may be advanced, which strongly favour it. The tribe dweUing in this territory, ac cording to Ptolemy, were the Cornavii, a term mean ing \"holy district or country of the priesthood,\" and .strikingly indicative of the general prevalence of Druidical practices for which the then abounding woods and forests, in which they took place, were so favourable. Tlie Cangi, or Woodlanders, who were herdsmen of this tribe, inhabited Cannock Chase which"], [37, "UTTOXETER. 17 is affirmed to have joined Needwood forest, and to have reached even the banks of the Dove, W So that it may reasonably be supposed that for the advantage of the flocks and herds of the extensive pasturage by the Dove, they might select so tempting a spot as Uttoxeter as the site of their residence in such huts as they erected. However, there is decisive evidence both of the existence of the ancient Britons in the neighbourhood of Uttoxeter, and also of the observance of Druidical rites. These facts not only strengthen the likelihood of Uttoxeter having been a settlement of this ancient people, but are a matter of considerable importance, and invest the place with such an interest as the more imposing Celtic remains in the Peak of Derbyshire, and tbe relics of a similar nature in other parts, possess. Toot HU1, on Uttoxeter High Wood, has associations of a similar interesting character, although it has only, tUl now, been mentioned as a Eoman tumulus. The name of Toot HU1 impbes that it was dedi cated to the Celtic deity, Teutates, as an altar. The name of this heathenish god is derived from Du Tath or Deus Taautus. Tot, Toot, or Teut, is an \u00c6theopic word, signifying dog-star, and it is supposed that the Toth of Egypt, deified in the dog-star, was transferred to the Ph\u0153necians who derived their as tronomical knowledge from Egypt. The Ph\u0153necians carried on commercial transactions with this island, (1) Whittaker's History of Manchester. C"], [38, "18 HISTORY OF particularly in tin, and it has been observed that the superstitious worship of this deity was left by them amongst the barbarous islanders. At the same time the Druidic rites of the Celts have been accounted for as having been preserved amongst them from their common origin in the east. It has also even been surmised that some Egyptians had become es tablished amongst them as among other rude nations, and had thus given a peculiar Egyptian character to the Druidic rites of this distant island. Stukely, in his \" Stonehenge Described,\" conceives that the Druids came here from the east in the time of Abra ham.(1) The chronological accounts fix the arrival of the Celts in Britain about one thousand six hundred years before the Christian era, and their migration over the Bosphorous and spread over the western parts of the old world upwards of two thousand years before Christ, or about the time when Abraham is supposed to have Uved. The same heathenish deity was worshipped by the Greeks under the name of Hermes, and by the Eomans as Mercury. Each of the fabulous gods had offices assigned to him peculiar to himself. Teutates, amongst the Britons, was regarded as the god of messengers and traveUers. The tumuli wiiich were dedicated to him, as Toot Hill was on Uttoxeter High Wood, stood on elevated and precipitous places. The reason of this was, as C\u00e6sar relates, that travellers might have guidance and protection along the roads and track- (1) Stonehenge Described by Dr. Stukely."], [39, "19 UTTOXETER. ways, and become prosperous in their commercial enterprises. On Toot Hill, as on all such eminences in the kingdom, the sacred or Beltane fires were kindled and flamed thrice a year at the great festivities of the Druids, in honour of Baal or the sun. One of a pro digious character was lit on May eve on these hills, and produced a remarkable light over the whole country. Fires were again made on Midsummer-eve, and on the eve of the first of November. The last was accompanied with sacrifices and festivities. On this day the people of the country out of a religious sentiment inculcated by the Druids, completeley ex tinguished their fires to rekindle them the same eve, for the ensuing year, by a portion of the consecrated fire from the sacred altars. This was a duty wiiich the head of every family was rigidly obliged to observe, and it was expected that by such observance good luck and prosperity would attend them tiU the return of the eve of the first of November. For the privUege of obtaining the use of this holy fire they had, however, to pay an annual due to the Druids, ;1) which if they ommitted to discharge by the last day of October ensuing, they had no prospect than to live the winter through without fire. No neighbour was permitted to give them any, or allow them tbe use of theirs \u2014 if they did, it was at the risk of excom munication, a fate, as managed by this religious priesthood, worse than death. 1, A small coin said to be worth about threepence."], [40, "20 HISTORY OF At the sacred fires on the first of November it was customary for some person of distinction to take in bis hands the entraUs of the animal sacrificed, and walking barefoot over the coals thrice, carry them to the Druid, who waited at the alter dressed in a whole skin. If he passed through the ordeal unhurt it was considered a favourable omen, and he was applauded ; if otherwise, it was received as an augury of calamity to the whole community. The midsummer fire and sacrifices were for the purpose of obtaining a blessing on the fruits of the earth now becoming ready for gathering, as were those on the first of May that they might grow prosperously. Those of the last of Octo ber were a thank-offering for finishing the harvest. W From Hollingbury being situated close to Toot HiU, it is not improbable that it took its name from another bill or altar dedicated to Belanus or Baal. This is the name under which the Celts worshipped the sun, and the worship of Teutates was generally united with it. In another part of the county there is a hiU caUed HUbury HiU contiguous to a Toot Hill. Indeed, in the survey of Uttoxeter, taken about 1658, by Peter Lightfoot, physician, it is in one place caUed HiU or HoUingbury indifferently. There are several mentions, moreover, of a HoUin HaU in de scriptions of land on the High Wood as in the foUow ing instances : \u2014 \" One tenement and barn and one close adjoining to the High Wood against HoUin HaU,\" and, \" One tenement and two closes adjoinino* (1) Toland's History of the Druids. \u2014Hones Every Day Book."], [41, "21 UTTOXETER. to the High Wood and the lane over against HoUin Hall.\" These references, without tbe slightest doubt, are to HoUingbury, and confirm the supposition that there was an altar there to Baal as weU as one to Teut. In the name of Ashcroft,(1) a close near the High Fields in a direct Une with the High Wood, is also indicated another place of Druid worship. The ash was a tree sacred to the Druids. In the most ancient of languages the word a.sh signifies fire, and the rem nants of fires are to this day called ashes, and there fore the places, where these fires, made chiefly of ash were kept, and have ash in the prefix of then name, as in Ashkelons, and Ashfield, they may properly be concluded to be sites where these ancient rites were observed. There is also a meadow, near Uttoxeter, which anciently bore the name Beale ;2) or Bean mea dow, but now only the latter, which suggests the still greater prevalence in the neighbourhood of Uttoxe ter, of the worship of Baal. The doctrines of the Druids, out of which arose then rites just described, although the account may appear somewhat too favourable, have been remarked upon'3' as more refined and rational in their nature than those of most other rebgious bodies. They taught the immortabty of the soul and a future state of rewards and punishment. Theu: morality was at (1) So called in Lightfoot's survey.

They had an imperfect perception of one pervading essence which revelation teaches Christians to worship under the name of God, but they worshipped the sun as a personification of his power, and used fire as an em blem of his nature in their worship ; besides, they did not regard the Divinity as a being of such stainless purity as we reverence ; stiU, this species of Baal worship \u2014 which originated in the East, where God himself, according to scripture, (Hosea, c. n. v. 16) was at one period worshipped under the name of Baal \u2014 was infinitely superior in simple and lofty truth to that of the Greeks and Eomans. In course of time it became corrupted by teaching a plurabty of Gods. In many parts of the united kingdom, ves tiges of the rites of the Druids may still be traced. Having described some of the Druidical customs with which Toot HU1 has been associated \u2014 on which indeed they have taken place \u2014 it only remains to be described as a place of sepulture. Various modes of burial, very different to those in use at present, have been practiced in times past. Sometimes the .sepulchres assumed the character of vast barrows, as the Pyramids of Egypt ; as the grave of Semiramis ; upon which, as amongst the Etruscans, art and wealth were lavished without any restriction. The tumub, or loose tombs, meaning graves, which exist as artificial hills, are numerous in tins kingdom, many of which have been raised at the expense of"], [43, "23 UTTOXETER. much labour and time. They are chiefly of Celtic formation, but they have often been taken advantage of by the Romans and Anglo Saxons for places of sepulture. (1) Toot Hill, as its name and associa tions show, is a Celtic grave-hiU, and its form is of the most ancient type, being a long tumulus \u2014 and in age is perhaps coeval with the Pyramids themselves. Having obtained permission to open it in May 1860, I secured the aid of a man for a considerable part of one day, starting very early in the morning on the ninth of that month to the interesting research. I found myself, from early usage, a tolerable adept both with the pick and spade. On the second day I employed two men to assist me, and we spent about three parts of it in digging into the mound. On the first occa sion I opened it in two places in the centre, and also in two at the east end. At the base of the tumulus in aU those openings I came across a bed of charcoal. I also discovered a fragment of coarse pottery, at a depth of two feet, in one of the openings at the east end.!2' In the subsequent attempt I resolved upon cutting a trench nearly through the tumulus, beginning at its east end ; and also to open it in the centre. Here, about nine or ten feet below the surface, the layer of charcoal, of which I have before spoken, again (1) Ten Years' Diggings in Celtic and Saxon Grave-hills, by T. Bateman.

They were about four feet deep. Exactly beneath these ashes, about four feet more, on the ground of the tumulus, I picked up pieces of calcined bone, charcoal, and some portions of one of the most primitive specimens of Celtic pot tery.

The place overlooks the valley of the Dove, and was formerly in the depth of the Uttoxeter ward of the forest of Needwood. A number of trees are growing upon it, and around it are the remains of a holly fence.

THE ROMANO-BRITISH PERIOD. So far back as the time of Erdeswick Uttoxeter has been deemed a Eoman station, for in giving the dis tances of Eoman stations from Mere, he mentions it as being fifteen mUes plain west from Uttoxeter. At one time the learned Camden laboured to fix tbe Etocetum of Antoninus at Uttoxeter, which has since been proved to be at WaU, where numerous Roman antiquities have been discovered. That the Romans should have had a station at Uttoxeter is not surpris mg, since they bad forty-six military stations and twenty-eight cities of consequence betwixt Perth and Inverness, and London, with a mibtary force of 20,000 foot and 1700 horse for the defence of the colony.'1' Indeed it was the practice with them to have such kind of places along then- roads and through the wooded parts of the kingdom for se curity against surprise from the Britons, as weU as to insure proper pasturage, fodder, and water for all kinds of cattle passing and repassing from place to place. (2) The opinion that Uttoxeter was a Roman station is also favoured by tbe fact that it is situated close to the old Rykeneld street, or old British way, and also known as the Via Devana, or road to Ches- (1; Scotland in the middle ages. (?) Vegetius."], [48, "28 HISTORY OF ter. In 1789 an attempt was made to trace the course of this way from Leicester to Chesterton. It was found through Needwood forest and foUowed to within a mile south of Uttoxeter, but all trace of it was lost until reaching Checkley and Tean, although it has generally been supposed to have passed on the west side of Uttoxeter at about the distance of a mile.*1*1 I conceive, however, that by the aid of Lightfoot's survey of Uttoxeter, I am enabled to show that the old British and Roman way proceeded close on the east side of Uttoxeter and not on the west side as pre viously supposed, and also to point out some remain ing portions of it. I was struck by tbe occurrence in the old MSS. of the words Portway or Salter's Lane, and I felt sure that if I could find out the land in connection with which they are mentioned, I should not be far from making out something of the way itself, although no lane about Uttoxeter is, at this time, known by such a name. After spending a considerable time in trying to find out what was meant by land or fields in \" The Botham field,\" and in \" The Bromshulf field,\" I was led to conclude from the names of distinct fields, though much altered in their spelbng and pronunciation in the course of two hundred years, that the land at the west side of Uttoxeter up to BramshaU went under the designation of Bromshulf field, and that at the north-east side under the denomination of Botham (1) See Shaw's Staffordshire ; Uttoxeter Parish Magazine, 1861 ; and County Histories."], [49, "29 UTTOXETER. field. As, therefore, certain fields in the Botham field are said in the survey to shoot or abut on, or adjoin tbe Portway or Salter's lane, particularly the Mastalls near the Flatts and Penny-croft-well (close to a field or two now caUed the Bottoms), and the Tarhole, the name at that remote period of a small piece of land near where the lower miU was situated (the one where the fuUing miU had been, and a httle above where the old mill house now is) over Tean brook, the locabty of the Portway, when in existence, became no longer doubtful. Adopting the opinion that Moisty-lane at the east side of the High Wood is a part of the Rykeneld Street (though the roads on the High Wood, were greatly altered when the enclosures of the moor took place), it must have passed by the east side of WoodvUle and Uttoxeter, quite touching the latter place at Bull's Bank, and have gone along the bridle way betwixt the residence of Mrs. Jerningham and the Roe Buck, across the fields now called the Bottoms, and so have joined Slade Lane in its course towards Stoke and Chester. Supposing this account is correct, then the old way had a straight direction by Uttoxeter, for the bridle way at Bull's Bank is direct for the road above WoodviUe, and less than half a mde from it. How ever, the old Rykeneld street had an existence near the Flatts, and probably in a part of Slade Lane, for the same way is called in other parts both Portway and Salters Lane. This view receives additional confirma tion from the fact that portions of the Rykneld, which traversed Derbyshire, are caUed ABathom Gate, and"], [50, "30 HISTORY OF Darley Slade, which have taken their names from the same circumstances as the \" Bothams\" and \" Slade Lane\" at Uttoxeter.

Port is no less significant of its having been a portion of the same ancient way. The word is Teutonic, signi fying chief or principal, and prefixed to way as under consideration, indicated it to be what it really was, the principal way through the Idngdom to Ireland. Another road of remarkable firmness bas gone across three fields called \"The Bottoms,\" and so on to Crakemarsh, as if for Rocester. In the Big Lea sowes which is separated from the Bottoms by Tean Brook, there is a remarkable site, of more than an acre, of banks, moat-like places, and uneven sur faces ; and in the same field, where a gravel pit has recently been commenced for private purposes, at about five feet in depth wood and \"curious bricks\" have been found. The bricks (which have not been preserved) are described to have been \"hard as flint.\" These remains may possibly be those of a Roman villa, and are worthy of extended investigation. It has just been seen why the Romans selected in various places, posts ; for those very reasons the site of Uttoxeter might have been fixed upon for the same purpose. At this point the Rykeneld would emerge from a wooded territory, inhabited by the British tribe who were the last to be conquered, whUst the pasturage by the Dove would supply them with for age to an extent, and in a way, few other places coidd."], [51, "31 UTTOXETER. It is to be regretted that the name of Uttoxeter is almost the only evidence (but that is indubitable) of its having been occupied by the Romans. It is, how ever, supplemented by circumstances already related, and by others to follow. In many places where there have been Roman stations, antiquities, including pottery and coins have been found to confirm reason able conjecture. In this case but Uttle in the way of antiquities can be mentioned to .show that the Romans occupied a station at Uttoxeter, and but one rebc of the Roman period besides the piece of pottery from Toot HiU, can be spoken of as having been found in the neighbourhood. Before describing it, however, an old weU, which has had a Roman origin ascribed to it, may be mentioned. It was discovered in 1856, by the workmen of Mr. Evans, builder, in the course of getting out foundations for additional back premises at the house of Mr. Britton, which stands between the corner of Carter street and the Old Talbot, in the Market Place. As I did not see the weU I transcribe a paragraph respecting it which appeared at the time.'1' \"As a party of workmen were engaged a few days since in digging the founda tions for a new house in connection with the shop and premises occupied by Mr. Britton, hosier, Market Place, Uttoxeter, which are undergoing extensive alterations, they discovered a short distance under ground, a curious old stone weU, arched over and about ten yards deep. The stones, of which it is (1) In the Derbyshire Advertiser."], [52, "32 HISTORY OF buUt throughout, are worn away by the trickling of the water, and it is of very ancient if not as supposed of Roman origin ; but the Goths and Vandals of the place fiUed it up with soil so that the efforts of the curious to examine this ancient remain will be for ever precluded.\" To this account of the ancient weU may be added a description of remains, discovered a year or two since, which may perhaps with equal certainty be as cribed to tbe Romans. When Mr. Pedley, in Carter street, was having a sough made under his house floor, three or four separate pavements of boulders, pebbles, and stones, one beneath the other for four feet deep, were cbsturbed. A number of drain tiles of the Roman form, with four oblong sides, and the usual holes down them, were met with. The work people thought the discovery very curious and un common at the time, but took no further notice of it, and it was only by accident that I lately became acquainted with the particulars. It is not unlikely that the same remains are continued underneath the yard at the back of the house. The relic referred to is a Roman vessel which was brought to light in 1788, during the enclosure of the High Wood. The land there was being cultivated for the first time, and the vessel was dug up by a labouring man, and a drawing and description of it from Mr. Samuel Bentley appeared in the Gentle man's Magazine. As this gentleman had the article in his possession, it may be presumed that his account wiU be the most accurate. He stated that all the"], [53, "UTTOXETER, 33 bottom of the vessel, of which the drawing was an exact copy, was corroded away by time, and as the Romans had several (?) stations in this neighbour- hood, he supposed it to have been a vessel in use amongst them, and consequently to have been of very remote antiquity. He was the more confirmed in his supposition as it bore a very close resemblance to a Roman vessel described in Montfaucon's Antiquities, on plate twenty-four, No. 9. According to the ac count there given of such vessels, he supposed it to have been used for bringing wine to the table, or else that it had been appropriated to sacrifices. The measure over the top was three inches and-a-half from the bp to the handle, and the handle five inches to the top of the bended part. The metal appeared to have been covered, both inside and out, with a hard and smooth enamel where it was not corroded and chipped, and to have been of a grey colour. The handle bad been richly gilt, and the labourer who found it was exceedingly elated, expecting that the whole had been of that precious metal, and was very D"], [54, "34 HISTORY OF much surprised when it proved to be only brass. The vessel, it is further said, was a good deal ham mered and scraped to see what the metal was, but what finaUy became of it does not appear, unless it was sent to Mr. Green's museum at Lichfield. This Mr. Bentley intended to do, but had some hesitation on account of the senseless scraping and hammering it had received. It has not been recorded whether any Roman coins have been found nearer to Uttoxeter than New borough, Hanbury, and Rocester. THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD. During the Anglo-Saxon period, Uttoxeter was in cluded in the kingdom of Mercia, from Myricnarac,-1 signifying in the Anglo-Saxon language, woodland kingdom, and therein agreeing with Coritani, the latinized name of the old British inhabitants, mean ing woocUand men or foresters.

This fact accounts for their hy brid character causing no Uttle perplexity in the derivation (especiaUy when coming through Norman writers) of the word Uttoxeter, and of many other Saxonized Eoman places. There are no remains of Saxon architecture in existence at Uttoxeter, nor any object which can be regarded as a production of their skiU in art. If there were any remains in the old church, they have been swept away. Yet there are several interesting circumstances which clearly identify our Saxon ances tors with Uttoxeter. Accounts are preserved, with pictorial representations, of the amusements of the Saxon people, among.st which was that of seeing bears exhibited. A scene of this description, as hav ing taken place in an Anglo-Saxon amphitheatre, is to be found amongst tbe Harleian manuscripts in the British Museum. The word Bear-Hill, appUed to the open space at the east end of Uttoxeter Market place, and which it had two hundred years back,'1' impbes that this pastime was common in Uttoxeter amongst the Saxons, and that either the bears were kept at Bear-HiU, or that the sports with them took place there, or both. As the Saxon people of the town would not be likely to import these creatures for the purpose, it may be presumed they obtained them from Needwood Forest, where, as weU as in '1; Lightfoot's Survey of Uttoxeter, 1668."], [56, "36 HISTORY OF other Engbsh forests, they existed in common with tbe wild boar and wolf.*1* As a proof of the wolf in habiting Needwood Forest in Saxon times, Wolf hurst, the name of an enclosed piece of land near Uttoxeter, may be cited. The word is Saxon : Wolf being the Saxon name of the animal itself, and hurst that of wood or forest. Uttoxeter is also associated with Saxon times by a curious monosylabic compound, thought to be the nick-name of the place, and applied t& a spot at the east end of Silver Street. The word is Hole-in-the wall, in which the AlwynehaU may possibly be traced, implying that one Alwyne, a Saxon thane, had his residence there. This little circumstance is of in terest, pointing out as it probably may the locabty where one of the Saxon nobility lived, who might possibly have been one of the influential functionaries of the day. It may be useful to add, that the thanes were of several orders, although it would be useless to inquire of what degree the Alwyne was who may be supposed to have lived at the Hole-in-the-waU. The king's thanes or attendants were of the first order ; then the thanes of the aldermen and earls, who were of the highest degree of the Saxon nobility, and next the inferior thanes who were of the landed gentry. Thanes were amongst the members of the Saxon Whitenagemot, or Parliament, or meeting of wise men. One of the qualifications of a Saxon thane, was a certain amount of landed property, five (I.1 See \"Reliquary\" for 1860-1861."], [57, "UTTOXETER. 37 bides of land being required to qualify one of the highest order. One of the laws of \u00c6thelstan declares, that if a ceorl, or commoner, shall have attained five bides of land in full property, with a church, a kit chen, a bell house, a burgate seat and a station in the king's hall, he shall henceforward be a thane by right. Perhaps the Alwyne at the Hole-in-the-waU was the thane of an Earl \u2014 possibly of Earl Algar. We are further reminded of the Saxon character of the town by the principal entrance to the churchyard being called the \"Light Gate.\" This word is cor rupted from Lice,a) the Saxon word for carcass or dead body, and Lich Gate was therefore the name given to the south entrance to the churchyard at Uttoxeter by the Saxons. Lich watching, or sitting with the dead, stiU observed in some places, was originated by the Saxons, but the practice does not appear to be con tinued at Uttoxeter. Besides these traces of the Saxons in the town, there are many places in the neighbourhood which bear appeUations originating with that people.

THE FEUDAL TENURE OF UTTOXETER Hitherto we have scanned the pre-historic period relating to Uttoxeter, and it has proved itseft not al together barren of many matters of interest, both local and general. We are now arrived at that period when local history receives the aid of authentic records, namely, when the survey of the kingdom was taken, by appointment of WiUiam the Conqueror, and contained in the Domesday-book, which was finished about 1086. The accounts of j)laces are in a contracted form in the mixed latin of the time. Written out in full and plain English, the portion relating to Uttoxeter is as follows : \u2014 \" Wotocheshede belongs to the king. It formerly belonged to Earl Algar. It bas half a hyde of land. The arable land is ten carucates, with two in demesne and one ser vant, twenty-four villans, eleven bordars with eleven carucates. There are also sixteen acres of meadow land and a wood two miles long and broad. It was worth seven pounds in the time of Edward the Confessor ; it is now worth eight pounds.\""], [60, "40 HISTORY OF A hide of land was one hundred and twenty acres. The arable land designated carucates, was plough land, a caruca being as much as was tiUed in a year. The viUans, who took their name as a class from villa, a country farm, were employed in tillage, and are supposed to have been formed by tbe coabsion of the conquered Britons, called Thralls, and of the free Saxon Ceorls.'1*1 The bordars, or boors, were inferior to the viUans, and held small quantities of land on the borders of manors on a base and uncertain tenure. It is singular that the name of Earl Algar is found in the survey, as he cbed seven years before the con quest, and was succeeded by his sons Edwin and Morcar, Earls of Mercia and Northumberland, who took up arms on behalf of their countrymen in 1071. Edwin, who would become the owner of Uttoxeter, on the death of his father, was betrayed to the Nor mans, and his estates were confiscated by the king.'2' This was a fate to which many Saxon noblemen had to submit, whether favourable or otherwise to the ac cession of WUliam the Conqueror. The king, how ever, did not long retain Uttoxeter, but along with seven lordships in Staffordshire, and numerous others in Derbyshire, Warwickshire, Nottinghamshire, and Leicestershire, gave it to Henry de Ferrars, Ferers, Ferriers, or Ferrariis, son of Walkebne de Ferrariis, a baron of great wealth and power in Normandy, who (1) Harland's History of Mamcester (Mtmchester), 1860. (2) Henry's History of England, and Ward's History of Stoke upon-Trent."], [61, "UTTOXETER. 41 accompanied the king.'1' The name of Ferrars was taken from his employment, that of shoeing horses, \u2014 not that he was himself a farrier, but was ap pointed to direct and superintend that business in the nature of pr\u0153fectus faborum. So when, at the time of the Crusades, it became tbe custom for families to take coat armour hereditarily, a charge of six horse shoes sable, on a field argent, was assumed by this great house.'2' (1) Erdeswick's Staffordshire. (2) Whether De Ferrars did hold the office of chief of the farriers, and whether or not in virtue of that office he assumed the badge of the horse shoe\u2014 or whether it was assumed as a \"canting\" badge (annet parlantes becoming pretty general as early as the reign of Henry II.) from its name, fer de cheval for Ferrars, as is generally believed \u2014 certain it is that the horse shoe was borne by the family of Ferrars in a variety of ways, and that it is identified with them throughout the period in which they held lands in this county. Mr. Planche\", Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms, has laboured hard to prove that the Ferrars are not originally entitled to the distinction of the horse shoe, and that it was only borne by them after an alliance with the Ma\u00bb shalls, Earls of Pembroke, but 1 have no doubt in my own mind that he is wrong in the conclusion he has arrived at. Three, or six, horse shoes are described as the arms of Ferrars \u2014 called, of course, by the early heralds, \"serres de cheval\" \u2014 thus the play on the word \" fe\u00bb res\" for \"Ferrars\" is easily seen. Another bearing of the Ferraris is \"Vaire, or and Gules,\" and I conceive that here (although such a supposition has never heretofore been started by any writer) \u2014 is another instance of the \" canting,\" or playful bearings. Vaire being spelt and pron*ouced \"Vekke\" is so close an approximation to \" Ferrars\" as to warrant one in supposing that to that circumstance it owes its adoption as an heraldic bearing of that once powerfnl family. Again \u2014 on a Norman pitcher, recently discovered by me near Duffield, are, besides five horse shoes, two buckles, which were probably also adopted as a badge from the resemblance of the name \" f er-mailles \" or \"Fermaux\" to \"Ferrars.\" It perhaps might be pushing the idea too far to suppose that the"], [62, "42 HISTORY OF Henry de Ferrars was held in great esteem for his pobtical knowledge, abUities and integrity. The be stowal of these extensive possessions upon him by the king was for the eminent services he had ren dered to this monarch. In the settlement of these lands in the honor of Tutbury (by wiiich is meant an estate consisting of several lordships \u2014 as the lordship of Uttoxeter \u2014 manors and knight's fees), upon this nobleman, the king reserved to himself, or the crown, certain privileges and payments. He, nevertheless, on certain conditions, aUowed portions of the same lands to be again given to others for their services, as wiU be subsequently perceived. Henry de Ferrars was one, of the commissioners appointed to take the general survey of the kingdom. He cbed in the in- pitcher just described proves that the proper heraldic bearing of the Earls of Ferrars and Derby was 5 horse shoes instead of 3 or 6 \u2014 but I think there is reason to suppose this to be the case. In the first place, 5 is equally as legitimate and usual a number as 6, and is one which fits the shape of the shield quite as well. It is evident from the dis position of the horse shoes on this jug, that the potter had some special end in view in placing 5 around it, \u2014 for he has put 4 of an uDiform size, and then to complete the requisite number has had to crowd in a small one by the buckles. The pitcher here described was found in the remains of a Norman pottery, on lands formerly belong ing to the Ferrars, and not far from their chief residence, Duffield castle. It has been carefully engraved and described in the \"Reli quary,\" Vol. III., page 216 ; which engravings, exhibiting both sides of the vessel, I have pleasure in here introducing. It has generally been believed that the Normans were the first to introduce the practice of shoeing horses into England \u2014 but this has long been disproved \u2014 and I have myself found iron horse shoes with undoubted Roman remains. That the Normans attached great importance to the art of farriery there can be no doubt, for be sides the grants to the Ferrars it is recorded that the Conqueror gave to Simon St. Liz the town of Northampton to provide shoes for his"], [63, "NORMAN PITCHES, BEARING THE BADGE OF THE FAMILY OF FERR.1RS."], [64, ""], [65, "45 UTTOXETER. terval of the years 1080 and 1089. He had by his wife, Bertha, three sons, Eugenulph, WiUiam, and Eobert. The two former died during the lifetime of their father, so that he was succeeded by Robert in the possession of Uttoxeter. To Robert de Ferrars, who was a nobleman of en bghtened views, Uttoxeter was indebted, in common with other immediate parts of the Honor of Tutbury, for some of its earliest advantages, arising from im provements in agriculture and trade. With a view to the cultivation of some newly enclosed parts of horses \u2014 that Gamelhere held land in Cukney, Nottinghamshire, for the service of shoeing the king's palfrey upon four feet, with the king's nails, or shoeing materials, as oft as he should be at his manor of Mansfield, and if he put in all the nails the king should give him a palfrey of four marks, or he was to have the king's palfrey giving him 5 marks, as he was also to do if he lamed the horse, pricked shim, or shod him straight \u2014 that Henry de Avering held the manor of Mor ton (Essex) by the sergentry of finding a man with a horse value ten shillings, and 4 horse shoes, one sack of barley, and one iron buckle, as often as the king should go with his army into Wales, at Iiis own expense, for forty days. The horse shoe was painted on the wooden foot quintain and it occurs heraldically on the seal of Walter Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, 1246, in the arms the Company of Farriers, and those of the families of Borlace, Cripps or Crispe, Ferrars, Randall, and Sheyswell, or Shoes well, &c, &c. It also forms the arms of the town of Oakham, in Rutlandshire\u2014 and here again its connection with the Ferrars is re markable, for the manor, with its regal hall, was held by them, and they had the priviledge, which is still retained as a right although compounded for by money, of claiming from every peer of parliament the first time he passes through the town, a horse shoe to be nailed on to the Castle Gate, and if he refuse, the bailiff of the manor has the power to arrest him and take one by force from his horses foot.

At Uttoxeter, iron was manufactured, whilst bleach ing was pursued at Newborough, and wool-combing at Tutbury. Thus Earl Eobert intended the agricul tural and trading populations of the district to be mutuaUy advantageous to each other ; tbe former to supply the latter with necessary food, while they in return were to supply the former with the requisite articles of clothing and implements of husbandry. Uttoxeter also gained other benefits under this wise and beneficent Earl ; he made it a free borough, by which is to be understood that the inhabitants were exempt from servile offices to the lords of the honour. He also granted unto them other privileges which they had not before enjoyed. They were made free of aU toUs, tonnage, package, poundage, and other exactions within their possessions.'2' Liberty (1) About twenty years ago, an old saw- pit was discovered in Uttoxeter Market Place, which may reasonably be supposed to have been made when Uttoxeter was enlarged. The wall separating the house of Mr. Norris from the Old Talbot Inn (two of the oldest houses in the town), was giving way, owing to the decay of the oak sleepers, and to remedy the matter, it was found necessary to dig ten feet deep for a foundation for a new wall. At this depth, the saw-pit, containing sawdust and curious oak wedges, quite black by the action of the iron in the earth, was met with, and a similiar discovery was madfe after wards, underneath the same premises, when sinking a well.

The Domesday Survey contains some curious items respecting the feeding of swine in this way, which show then value, and how greatly they were depended upon as a source of profit and food. The return for Middlesex was 16,535 hogs; for Hertfordshire 30,535, and for Essex 95,991. But more curious is it, that a nobleman by his wiU left 2000 s.wine to two daughters ; another nobleman cbrects 100 swine and a hide of land to his relations, and 200 swine to two priests, in equal proportions for the good of his soul ; whilst another disposes of land to a church, on condition that 200 swine were fed for the use of his wife. Robert de Ferrars also granted to the monks of Tutbury priory right to make a trench in the moor of Uttoxeter to preserve theu: fields, and gave them the branches of the wiUows and osiers which hung over [1) Sir Oswald Mosley's History of Tutbury."], [68, "48 HISTORY OF the water for improvement of their wet lands, which were often injured by floods. It does not appear who was the wife of this Earl, but beyond the great improvements he made in the Honor of Tutbury, in wiiich Uttoxeter so largely par ticipated, it is mentioned of him that in the reign of king Stephen, he accompanied Wilbam Peverel, Earl of Nottingham, and other noblemen who undertook to repel the invasion of David, king of Scotland ; and in consequence of the personal valour he then dis played, king Stephen created him an Earl. He died tlie year after this memorable event, in 1139. He was succeeded by his son Eobert, who in his fathers life-time 6tyled himself \"Eobertus junior, \"comes de Nottinghame.\" He succeeded his father as Earl of Ferrars, and is said to have been the first who assumed the title of Earl of Derby, being created to that dignity by king Stephen in 1141. But it is also said that it was the first Eobert who was thus distinguished by Stephen for his conduct at the battle of the standard. This second Eobert died in 1184, in the thirtieth of Henry II. He was succeeded by Iiis son WiUiam, Earl of Ferrars and Derby, who married Margaret Peveril, and through her inherited estates, to one of which \"Higham Ferrars\" he added his name. He is said to have died at the seige of Acre in 1190. His son the second WiUiam, married a daughter of Hugh KevUlioc, Earl of Chester, and died in 1247. He was created Earl of Derby by king John in the first year of his reign. He \u25a0was succeeded by his son, the third William, who"], [69, "UTTOXETER. 49 married SibiUa, daughter of William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, who in his turn was succeeded by his son Eobert, the last Earl, whose course of infidelity to his sovereign, and reckless and open rebellion, ended in his attainder, and the confiscation of his lands, which in 1266 were given by Henry III. to the Earl of Lancaster. King John was greatly indebted to the second Earl William, for his faithful attachment, and by a special charter created him Earl of Derby. On this occasion the king himself gbded him with a sword, and not only had he in the same charter a grant of every third penny in all pleas before the sheriff of the county of Derby, but in the same year and afterwards the honor of Tutbury was extended by the addition of other manors and grants of land. When the Pope had deposed king John, this earl proved his fidelity to him by becoming surety for his fulfilment of those conditions to which the king was obliged to submit. As an additional return for the royal favours he had received, he accompanied the king to Poictou, and both aided him and his successor Henry III. against the rebeUious barons, betwixt whom, some years af terwards, from the estimation in which he was held as a peacemaker and lover of justice, he was chosen arbitrator in their quarrels. He died in the year 1247. His successor, William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby, did homage for Chartley, and it was during his life that some of the wild cattle of Needwood'1' Forest (l)The name of Needwood appears to be a corruption of Neat's wood, or the wood of cattle.

The loss of his father whilst he was under age was a great misfortune to him. He grew up without the influence of paternal authority. He was naturally of a perverse mind, and a knowledge of his extensive possessions was not likely to be the most favourable to its subjection. On attaining the age of twenty-one years, he openly rebelled against the king, his ex tensive estates furnishing him with a considerable number of followers ; and in consequence of the de predations he committed, a large army was sent against hint under the king's eldest son Edward, who demolished Tutbury castle, laid waste the country round with fire and sword, and involved the peaceful occupiers of the cbstrict in great suffering and loss. Uttoxeter being one of the most considerable places within a few mUes of the castle, the possesors of its burgages influential, free from all servile offices, but bound to serve the superior lords of the honor in time of war, most bkely felt the infliction of the chastisement upon theTearl in a severe degree. StUl the loss he thus .sustained and the misery he entailed upon the guiltless occupiers of the land, had little effect upon him ; he continued his rebellion until at length, for his misdemeanors and crimes, the king re solved to punish liim. Seeing his doom, he flung him self upon the mercy of his sovereign, who generously pardoned him. He was bound by the most solemn stipulations to rebel no more, but in their very face he was again foimd in arms against the king. His"], [74, "54 HISTORY OF tenure of power, however, war, short. His forces were routed by Almaine, the king's eldest son ; he himself was captured and cast into prison, in Lon don, and his lands, by two grants dated June and August, 1266, were given to Edmund, Earl of Lan caster, son of Henry III. It would be out of place to follow this earl through his useless litigations for the recovery of his confis cated estates after his imprisonment of three years ; but it must be observed that soon after he became of age, and previous to the year 1262, he gave to John Tunley one hundred and twenty acres of land upon the Brends in the ward of Uttoxeter, with timber growing thereon, to be held of him and his hebs, un less they should be religious men or Jews, freely, with house boot and hay-boot throughout the ward of Uttoxeter, and rights of common in the forest of Needwood. He also gave liberty tbe same year, by his letters patent, dated at Yoxall, to Sir Walter Raleigh and his heirs resicbng at Uttoxeter, to hunt and course the fox and hare within the precints of his forest of Needwood, with eight braches (a particular sort of hound, perhaps the beagle) and four grey hounds.

Around the seal is the legend SIGILLVM EOBEETI DE FEEEAEIIS COMITIS DERBEYE. The seal, which is here engraved of its full size, is one of the most beautiful and perfect of its period. Uttoxeter must now be considered as having become transferred to Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, who was a branch of royalty. This Earl claimed various privi leges for Uttoxeter (and the same to Tutbury), which were, view of frank-pledge, infangtkef, the right of erecting a gibbet and of receiving waives ; also a free warren, a market once in seven days, on Wednesday in each week, and an annual fair on the eve and nativity of the blessed Vngin, all of which liberties, rights, privileges, and customs had been held by Robert de Ferrars, the last Earl of Derby. The events of the Use of Edmund, Earl of Lan caster, may be comprised in a very brief summary.

He accompanied his brother, Edward I., to the Holy Land, but returned in safety. In the twenty-fourth year of this king, he was sent, with the Earl of Lincoln, with twenty-six bannerets to Gascoigne ; they set down near Bordeaux, but see ing no likelihood of its surrender, they marched, after some skirmishes, from thence to Bayonne, where they were honourably received. Having, however, many soldiers with them whom they could not keep to gether, owing to the exhaustion of their treasures, he grew much troubled in mind, and thereby falling sick, he died at the feast of Pentecost, in the year 1296. He commanded that his body should not be buried till his debts were paid ; after which, truce being made, his body was carried to England and buried in Westminster Abbey. A monument was erected to his memory, of which there are plates in Gough's Sepulchural monuments of Great Britain.'1' This earl was twice married; by his second wife, Blanche, he had three sons \u2014 Thomas, Henry, and John, and one daughter. Henry, second Earl of Lancaster, the most power ful and wealthy subject in Europe, did much to im prove the country surrounding the castle, which he found stiU suffering from the injuries sustained during the rebeUion of the first earl, and he also repaired and beautified the castle at Tutbury.

In the tenth year of Edward II. , he was in the Scottish wars, and was commanded to raise two thousand foot, well armed, out of his own lands and fees, and to bring them to Newcastle to the king within one month of the feast of the nativity of St. John the Baptist. He retained Sir Hugh Meynell to serve him in peace and war.'1' He lived in a state of great splendour, and well would it have been for him if his views had been confined to the improve ment of his estates and the sumptuousness of his hospitalities. He became general of a confederate army against Edward II. ; various recriminations, and some not the most honourable, were inflicted upon him ; ultimately he was taken prisoner, and after having been condemned by a counsel of the king's officers, and not by a body of noblemen, he was beheaded at Pontefract in March, 1320, amid great indignities, and in the sequel canonized.\u00ae Uttoxeter now became a demesne of the crown, although but for a short time, for after having been consigned, with the rest of the estates of the late earl, to the custody of Eoger Bel er, who was attached to the king's person, the period approached for those ex tensive pos.sessions to revert to the brother of Thomas Earl of Lancaster. King Edward became the royal captive of Henry, Earl of Lancaster, but afterwards faffing into less humane hands, he was barbarously (1) Shaw's History of Staffordshire.

The claim of Henry de Lancaster to the estates of his brother, was admitted by prince Edward, who assumed the administration of the state. It was also again recognised in the first year of Edward III., and an act of parliament was passed for revising the attainder of Thomas, Earl of Lancas ter, upon the ground that he had not been tried by his peers according to law and Magna Charta. In the same year, 1327, an inquisition was taken of the lands the late earl left at his death, and Uttoxeter is particularly mentioned in connection with those in Staffordshire. The principal residence of Henry, Earl of Lancas ter, was at Leicester. Very few transactions of his bfe are upon record connected with the honor of Tut bury. He died in 1345, leaving by his wife Maud, Henry who was created Earl of Derby, and subse quently Duke of Lancaster, who was the first English subject, except thosse of royal descent, who was invested with the ducal title since the conquest. A consider able part of his life was passed abroad in the service of his country, in which he proved himself one of the greatest warriors of his age. He had, however, in bis father's lifetime so distinguished himself as to be made captain general of the king's army in Scotland.'1' His chivalrous exploits formed a theme of exultation to every Englishman, and produced a paralysing dread in the hearts of his opponents.

This nobleman left two daughters, Maud and Blanche, co-heiresses of his extensive pos sessions. Those which formed the earldoms of Derby and Lancaster feU to the share of Blanche. Uttoxeter was included in this division, it being in tbe honor of Tutbury. This lady became the wife of the famous John of Gaunt, who inaugurated an era of almost fabulous splendour at his castle at Tutbury, which he bad restored to its former strength and beauty, after it had lain in ruins and neglect since the death of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. The whole of the honor felt the benefit of the change ; husbandry and trade received an impetus, and the deadly nightmare of depression for forty years, produced by circumstances already described, and the absence of the princely earls from their turreted home for that period, at once fled. At this time, namely, in 1370, Uttoxeter had 140 burgages which made a rental of \u00a37, 2s. There were also two forges and a plot of land rented at 2s. 6d. a year.

The rent of assize of free tenants amounted annually to \u00a324, 6s. 8d. The free fishery in the Dove, with another fishery in the Pool of Ut toxhather, was estimated at \u00a31, 5s. a year. There was a payment of 12s. by ancient custom at the two great courts ; and at the feast of St. Martin, another payment of 5s. as a poll-tax of young men. Twenty one acres of land and one rood of meadow were valued at \u00a31, 4s. annual rent.

At this time Needwood forest was divided into five wards, of wiiich Uttoxeter had one. In the Uttoxeter ward the sale of bme-tree bark was valued at 6s. 8d. a year ; the pannage of hogs at 6s. 8d., and the perquisites of the wood-mote at 5s. There was in this ward a hay, called the moor of Uttoxeter, which was worth in herbage and acorns \u00a32 a year, and the amount of the ward was \u00a33, 18s. 4d. After the death of his first wife, John of Gaunt, who had become Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Eich mond, married Constance, Queen of Castile, and after the demise of this lady, Catherine Swinford became his third wife. John of Gaunt died on the tliird of February, 1399. By his Duchess Maud, he had one son, Henr^7, who was created Duke of Hereford. But instead of being peacefuUy permitted to succeed bis father in the Lancastrian estates, King Eichard III. , who bad already foUowed him with persecution into banishment, seized upon the goods of John of Gaunt, and issued orders for the rents and revenues of his possessions to be received for Itimself. The nation, however, was greatly incensed with the king's be haviour towards the duke of Hereford, and as he passed through the city of London, on horseback, on leaving the kingdom, he was followed by forty thousand persons, who bewailed his fate and their own in the most moving manner. The duke's at torney insisted upon the right of the claim, which"], [83, "UTTOXETER. 63 Richard would on no account listen to. The im becUity and incapacity of the king (whom recent historians have attempted to rescue from a good deal of reproach), together with his repeated instances of oppression and tyranny, at length completely alienated the affections of his people, and by almost universal consent he was judged no longer worthy to manage the affairs of the realm By the advice of parbament he resigned tbe throne, and the Duke of Lancaster, son of John of Gaunt, was chosen king in his .stead, by the name of Henry IV. Consequently, Uttoxeter was now connected with the crown by right. StUl, \" uneasy is the head that wears a crown.\" Henry IV. had several disaffected subjects in different parts of the kingdom. His policy, however, in at taching to his interests a large number of his feudal tenants, served him most effectually in suppressing rebelbon amongst the noblemen, whose fidelity was thus relied upon in the several offices to which they were appointed. Amongst these were Sir Nicholas Montgomery, of Sudbury (an ancestor of Lord Ver non), who held the office of constable of Tutbury Castle, and warden of the chase of Needwood, with a salary of \u00a320; Sir John Bagot, Knight, who for other services received forty marks from Uttoxeter; together with Sb John Gresley, Baronet, and Sir Avery Lathbury. The most formidable of the king's disloyal subjects, was the Duke Northumberland. Although defeated, he maintained considerable in fluence in the north of England, from whence he issued a proclamation, a copy of which found its way"], [84, "64 HISTORY OF into Staffordshire, where, with several gentlemen and others the newly elected king was supposed not to be in great favour. Eiotous proceedings were com menced against the king's tenants and offices in this county, and they were continued even after the Duke of Northumberland was slain and the rebelbon at an end. Two of these gentlemen were Hugh de Erdes wick and Thomas de Swinnerton, who armed a num ber of men and made a violent attack upon John Blount, steward of the king's manors at Newcastle under-Lyme. He was son of John Blount, to whom John of Gaunt gave Barton Park upon the outlawry of Bakespur, whose cause the famUy of Erdeswick, who Uved at Sandon, espoused. Hugh de Erdeswick made a second attack with an armed force upon John Blount, at Lichfield, and nearly succeeded in mur dering him. In the first attack the Mayor of New castle was intimidated from taking proceedings against the parties for fear of losing his bfe. For a second attack by Erdeswick, a warrant was issued for his apprehension by the chief steward of the Duchy, and he and his attendants were bound to keep the peace. On that very day, however, he and three brothers of the name of Mynors, of an ancient family of that name then at Uttoxeter, armed themselves and attendants with lances, and made attacks on numerous others of the king's tenants and servants with the intention of killing them. Amongst these other victims of their malice were persons at Boll- stone, DunstaU, Newcastle, and Marchington, who only saved themselves by a spirited resistance or a"], [85, "65 UTTOXETER. lucky escape. At Uttoxeter they broke open the bouse and destroyed the furniture therein of an old forester, named Jobn Passman, a faithful servant of the Duke of Lancaster. They also threatened the life of the miller at Uttoxeter miU, if he continued longer to work there, and attempted to kill Thomas de Belton, a tenant of the Duchy. These tumultuous proceedings lasted about a year, when they were sup pressed by legislative interference. After the lords of the Honor of Tutbury had been raised to the throne, a great depreciation took place in the value of their lands and possessions. The reason of this was that in consequence of their absence from the castle, there was a less demand for the pro duce of the neighbourhood. From the survey taken in the reign of Henry V., preserved in the office of the Duchy Court of Lancaster, it appears that Ut toxeter continued in the Honor of Tutbury. The same survey, which is contained in a beautifully en grossed veUum book, called the \" Coucher,\" shows that Uttoxeter had suffered from the same cause. The number of burgage houses at Uttoxeter had de creased from one hundred and forty to one hundred and thirty-eight, and the rents from \u00a37, 2s. Od. to \u00a36, 17s. 8d. The two forges, which are mentioned in the previous survey, appear to have been aban doned, as no mention is made of them in the \" Cou cher.\" On Edward IV. gaining the ascendency over Henry VI., he granted the Honor of Tutbury, which he dissevered from the* rest of the paternal estates, to F"], [86, "66 HISTORY OF George, Duke of Clarence, who is chiefly known for his whimsical choice of being immersed in a butt of Malvoisie wine. King Edward, however, annulled the grant, owing to the Duke joining the Earl of Warwick in a rebeUion against himself, and issued a warrant in the thirteenth year of his reign to resume the possession of these estates, which were accordingly granted in that year to Thomas, Archbishop of Can terbury and other trustees, to hold for the king during his absence in France. The chase of Needwood now began to be regarded as a royal forest, but the keepers of the various wards rendered themselves exceedmgly disagreeable to the occupiers of the lands on tbe borders of the chase, by heavily amercing them, for driving the deer back within their boundaries, from whence they often escaped, and did much damage to the crops. But when it was shown that the levy of these fines was unjust, and the keepers thereby lost this means of enriching themselves, they did not hesitate to commit unwarrantable havoc with the timber growing within the forest. In the reign of Henry VIII., one of these officers was detected in an offence of this de scription. As a consequence of this, further inquiries were made into the extent of the evil, when it was discovered that keepers of the various wards had cut down and sold large quantities of timber, and the keeper of Uttoxeter ward eight hundred and forty one loads in a single year. In the first year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Uttoxeter ward was dis forested and the deer in it destroyed; but at tbe"], [87, "67 UTTOXETER. same time it contained more and better timber than any other. The first most extensive dismemberment of the great possessions of the earl of Derby, was made by James I., by making grants of various lordships in Derbyshire. King Charles I., whose scruples were less and necessities greater than those of his pre- decessor, did not hesitate to make grants of his territories lying in the vicinity of his castle. The manor of Uttoxeter and other appendages of the Duchy of Lancaster, were disposed of on May 24th, 1625, to Lord William Craven, Sir George Whit- more, Sir William Whitmore, and Mr. Gibson. These gentlemen immediately caused a survey of the manor of Uttoxeter to be made, and resold it to the inhabitants of the town for \u00a33120, who conveyed to the various occupiers their interest in tbe same. The timber then growing in Uttoxeter High Wood was about this time sold for the king's use, by Sir to Thomas Degge and Eichard Startin, who again Edward Mosley, the attorney-general of the Duchy, sold it in lots to others. Ten years subsequently to this an attempt was made to enclose the High Wood, which had before been known as Uttoxeter Ward, on the forest of Needwood. A greater part of the n- habitants of Uttoxeter enjoyed, however, common rights thereon, and therefore strenuously opposed the project. From private documents in the possession of Sir Oswald Mosley, it appears that in consequence of this, Sir Edward Mosley preferred an information in the Duchy court against the principal persons who"], [88, "68 HISTORY OF had made tins attempt, stating that as his Majesty was seized of the said common in his demesne as of fee, being parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster, and as the townsmen of Uttoxeter had destroyed all his deer, fowls and wood, &c, and that as the defendants claimed right of common there, although they had no such right, and did stop and interrupt Ids majesty from replenishing the same with deer and birds of game, and also from improving the same, he prayed to have writs of privy seal directed to the projectors of this attempt to appear in the Duchy Court to an swer the premises, and to abide the order of the said court. Writs were served, in pursuance of this application, upon the parties, and they all, with one exception, answered upon oath that they admitted the king's title to the common, but disclauned all knowledge as to how the fowls and wood had been destroyed. They also added that the freeholders had usually enjoyed a right of common there, and if his Majesty was de sirous of enclosing a part for his own use, they hoped they might be permitted to compound for and pur chase the same. When this answer was returned into the Duchy, the chancellor found it to be insufficient, owing to one of the defendants not having agreed to it. An order to this effect was issued, that as all the said defendants excepting one had consented that his Majesty should enlose a part of the common, aU the other resident inhabitants should express their con sent in writing, to satisfy the court that they were all wUling to submit to such an arrangement. A"], [89, "69 UTTOXETER. commission was then directed to Sir Edward Mosley, Sir Edward Vernon, Simon Every, Esq., Walter Vernon, Esq., George Parker, and Thomas Ayloffe, Esqs., to take the subscriptions of the freeholders, and to enclose what part should be agreed upon. Sir Edward Mosley, Mr. Every and Mr Ayloffe, who were all in the king's service, then came to Uttoxeter and threatened the inhabitants with inevitable ruin in case they refused to sign. By these means six more of the inhabitants signed, and twenty more gave in their names as consenting parties. When the cer tificate of the commissioners as to these consents be ing obtained had been returned into the Duchy court, a second commission came from thence for the en closing of half of the said common for the king's use. This was immediately carried into effect under the superintendence of Mr. Ayloff, and an injunction was granted to prohibit commoners from exercising their right of common in the other half of it, until the king's further pleasure was known. Thus was Uttoxeter Ward finally dissevered from the remain ing part of the forest. The other was divided amongst the freeholders of Uttoxeter in lieu of their right of common. The king's moiety was in March, 1639, granted to Mr. Nevil, one ofthe officers of the king's bed-chamber. The quantity of land thus ap portioned, amounted to 500 acres. Mr. Nevil, for several years, received rent for his portion without in terruption ; but a few years before the commence ment of the civil wars, a party of soldiers who had been impressed against their will, burnt the rails, de-"], [90, "70 HISTORY of stroyed the fences and laid the ground waste ; yet for this trespass several of the townspeople were prose cuted in the Star Chamber, and had not the political convulsions which followed put a stop to the pro ceedings, the greater part of the inhabitants would have been subjected to a coutinuance of vexatious lawsuits respecting it. I1* A common or waste on the High Wood, probably distinct from any of the land above mentioned, was estimated at 369a. 2r. 5p. '2' whilst some other portion called the Moor of Uttoxeter, belonged to the Duke of Rutland, and was held by lease by the Rev. Thomas Lightfoot, about the same time. Part of the common granted, says Mr. Samuel Bentley, in a note to his poems, from the crown to the poor of Uttoxeter, was enclosed by act of parlia ment in 1788, for the purpose of aiding the poor's rate of the parish, wiiich then pressed heavily upon it. The enclosure was effected under the directions of a body of trustees, by whom the old workhouse was erected, as appears from the following inscription on the large round sandstone (now in my backyard), which was placed in the front wall of the building. \" Tbis workhouse was rebuilt by the trustees for enclosing the common within the constablewick of Uttoxeter, 1789.

Before the erection of these workhouses, a number of houses were employed for the purpose at the bottom of Spicer's Street."], [92, "72 HISTORY OF UTTOXETER DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND REBELLION. Although the opening of the civil war of the middle of the seventeenth century served so well the inhabitants of Uttoxeter in saving them from ruinous proceedings in the dreaded Star Chamber, in respect to their common rights, yet it came upon them otherwise with two-fold severity, which continued a number of years. Uttoxeter, being situated betwixt various places which were garrisoned for the king \u2014 as Alton Castle, Wootten Lodge, and Tutbury Castle \u2014 the inhabitants were not only harrassed by a continual apprehension of a siege, but also suffered excessively by the exactions of the contending parties as temporary success placed either one in the ascen dant. The accounts of the constables of Uttoxeter during this stirring time, are still extant, and afford a vivid picture of the amount of oppression the townspeople and those in the neighbourhood were suffering under. Raising large sums of money and furnishing provinder and provisions for Tutbury, Lichfield, Alton, Wootton Lodge and Stafford, but chiefly for Tutbury, was a daily occurrence. The king passed through the town no fewer than three"], [93, "UTTOXETER. 73 times ; distinguished military individuals and sol diers were quartered upon it, as they passed and repassed from place to place, at no slight expense ; bulwarks and barricades were made, trenches were dug and watches were set, and when the soldiery could not be had for the safety of the town, the in habitants were obliged to arm themselves and call in the countrymen from the surrounding villages to aid in defence of their property and homes. King Charles I. paid his first visit to Uttoxeter in 1642, no doubt in the course of movements occasioned by the unsettled political state of the country, when he stayed at Mr. Wood's Hall, which was swept for the august occasion, and was then the principal gen teel residence in Uttoxeter. (1) It was in this year that the king, failing to give satisfaction to his parliament by his concessions whilst he refused his assent to the militia bill, resolved to appeal to the sword for the maintenance of his rights, and commanded the High Sheriff of the county of Stafford to garrison Tutbury Castle, and levy contributions upon the county for all requirements. From Uttoxeter, where he pro bably stayed one night, the king marched to Stafford, for it appears that the sum of \u00a31, 14s. 6d. was paid for trained soldiers accompanying him to Uttoxeter, and from thence to Stafford to wait upon him. Uttoxeter has generally been spoken of as a royal town, and it would appear that at some period of this unsettled time there was a predominent leaning to (1) A further account of the hall will be found further on."], [94, "74 HISTORY of the Stuart dynasty. At the beginning of the war, however, whatever opposite compulsion had been forced upon it, it is evident the people of Uttoxeter inclined to the side of the parliament. There was no welcome to the king pealed from the church bells when he stayed at Uttoxeter Hall, and the ruin threatened to the town in the Star Chamber, was in remembrance against him being favourably received. This is also further evident. When Stafford became possessed by the royalists, the moorlanders, amongst whom the people of Uttoxeter were included, and who indeed were perhaps especially intended, applied to Sir John GeU, then at Derby, for his assistance.'1' According to the Parliamentary narrative, \" Sir John Gell asked what assistance they would have, they said two-hundred musquetters and one saccer, not doubting but that they had men enough with that assistance to regaine the towne \u2014 doubtless that of Stafford \u2014 and save themselves. Hee commanded his major Mollanus immediately with two-hundred foot and one saccer to march towards their appointed ren dezvous att Uttoxeter. His major being there two or three dayes, and nobody coming to assist him, and hearing that the enemy increased, was forced to re treat in the night to Derby.\" Sir John Gell, himself, joining his force with that of Sir William Brereton, soon after marched upon Stafford, and at Hopton Heath, near that town, came up with the enemy, \" Whereupon hee sett his ffoot in order of battalis, f) Hobson's History of Ashbourne and \"Valley of the Dove."], [95, "75 UTTOXETER. and Sir William his horse, the enemy advancing in a full body with above one thousand two hundred horse, whereof the Earl of Northampton was general, and soe setting upon their horse, Sir William's horse presently ran away, and left Sir John Gell alone with the ffoot. The enemy drew his horse into a body againe, and charged his ffoot, but hee gave them such a salute, that the enemy in a disorder d manner drew off and marched away towards Stafford, but left many dead bodies behind them, whereof my Lord Northampton was one, Captayne Middleton, and many other brave commanders of horse, and at least one hundred dragoones ; and on our side three car ters and two souldyers were slayne ; wee lost two casks of drakes, which the dragoones had drawne a greate distance from the ffoot, under the hedges to save themselves, and soe Colonel Gell retreated with my lord's dead body towards Uttoxeter, with his fforces, and Sir William Brereton with his fforces towards Cheshire. And att Uttoxeter Colonel Gell remayned three dayes, and set Staffordshire in as good posture as hee could ; within the said three dayes there came a trumpetter to him from my younge Lord of Northampton, for his father's dead body, whereupon hee answered, if hee would send him the drakes which they had gotten from their dragoones, and pay the chirurgeons for embalming it, hee should have it ; but he (the Earl of Northampton) returned him an answer, that hee would do nither th' one nor th' other, and soe Colonel Gell caused him to be carried in his company to Derby, and buried him"], [96, "76 HISTORY OF in the Earle of Devonshire's sepulcher, in All Hal lowe's Church.\" About this stage of civil commotion, Uttoxeter presented all the features of a place in a state of siege. Various defensive works were raised about the town, especially on its west and south sides. One man, a John Sherret, led clods for five days to the bulwarks ; carpenters and other day labourers were paid the sum of \u00a35, 13s. 2d. for their services in the erection of similar works, in the construction of which timber (of which a large quantity could be had for a little money) and other articles were required, cost ing the sum of \u00a31, 6s. 8d. Besides the expense of these works, which were intended for a vigorous de fence, there were also coal, and the war-like materials of powder and bullets, for the town ends, amounting to about \u00a34 in value. In an apprehension of an ad vance from Stafford way, trenches were dug in the Picknals, at which men from Loxley and other places were employed. That the town at this period was actually attacked there is not the slightest doubt. Wortley with a force of men, came against it, but they were repulsed and a number of them taken prisoners. On this occasion the town was assisted by men who had been previously called in from most of the villages and hamlets about \u2014 as Tean, Loxley, Marchington, Crakemarsh, and Creighton. Lord Stanhope and his son were also this year in custody at the Crown, one of the two inns of that name then in the market place, and were kept there under the strictest watch of a guard."], [97, "77 UTTOXETER. In 1643, King Charles I. was again at Uttoxeter, but where he was passing to does not appear. This time he was honoured by a peal from the church bells. The bulwarks were this year pulled down, although there was still great cause for apprehension, for a strict watch had to be kept upon the neigh bourhood from the church tower, which commands a view of most of the approaches to the town, for the safety of which other precautions were taken by the employment of guards and sentinels. One of the bulwarks, thus taken away, had been at the church gates, and the fact clearly intimates that the church would have been occupied as a defensive position, and perhaps, as a last resort for the defenders of the town if much pressed. Colonel Gell this year took Wootton Lodge, to the defenders of which Uttoxeter had sent a cart load of bread. The expenses occa sioned to Uttoxeter by the war during these two years amounted to about \u00a368, but they afterwards became excessive year by year for twenty years, and it is really a wonder how the town survived so fearful a crisis. The levies upon Uttoxeter, in provisions and money, amoimted, during the succeeding year, 1644, to no less a sum than \u00a3608, 13s. 2d., whilst the hamlet of Loxley, for the same period, furnished the sum of \u00a385, 8s. 6d. There was, however, consider able warmth amongst the two political parties in Uttoxeter at this time, and there can be little surprise if there was a ringing clash of wordy controversy, and sometimes of violent rancorous contention, and it"], [98, "78 HISTORY OF must have been owing to some strife in the difference of parties, that one Mr. John Scott, who belonged to a family of respectability and property in Uttoxeter, W was killed. The person who committed the guilty deed was soon discovered and seized, and the manner in which he was dealt with was amazingly summary, apparently without judge or jury, for a rope and cords were speedily procured, with wiiich he was pinioned and hanged, and then hastily buried in the church yard ; the sum of eightpence being paid for taking him there. Mr. William Fish, one of the constables, was also taken prisoner this year by Lord Goring, who lay in the town with his foot guards on the 4th of May. This worthy man, probably under the influence of his political leanings, either neglected or positively refused to supply provisions to Lord Goring, which was sufficient excuse for Iris imprison ment. The matter is referred to in the following entry by his brother official in the constables' ac counts, \" Charges and martial fees expended by my fellow constable being kept prisoner three weeks con cerning provisions, \u00a31, 6s. 4d.\" On the 24th of May, 1645, it being Whitsunday, the king arrived for the third and last time at Ut toxeter, from Stone.

The king and prince were at the head of a large force of horse, numbering about 5520. M On the succeeding day they proceeded to Tutbury, and from thence to Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Leicester, which latter place they took by storm, on the 14th of June. On the king arriving at Uttoxeter on May 24th, his Majesty was again saluted with peals from the church bells, and the records of the town fully con firm the traditionary account that he slept at Sir Thomas Milward's, judge, at Eaton. A hogshead of beer, costing Uttoxeter \u00a31, 6s. 8d., was conveyed to Eaton for his Majesty's use by one Edward Ball. A family of this name appear to have had some property in Uttoxeter, but the only source which could, fails to show what public-house he occupied.12' The account of King Charles sleeping at Eaton is also confirmed by a notice in Captain Symond's diary. Prince Rupert, and another prince, whose name is not given, lay at Uttoxeter, and their quarters for one night only cost the town \u00a35, 12s., whilst his cook, who ac companied him, claimed and had paid to him a fee of 5s. The town was not capable of accommodating the whole of the king's troops, and consequently some of them lay in the villages about. The Earl of Lichfield and others were quartered upon Marstone, near which place a soldier, for ravishing two women, was tied with his shoulders and breast naked to a (1) Shaw's History of Staffordshire. (2) Lightfoot's Survey."], [100, "80 HISTORY OF tree, and every carter of the train and carriages was to lash him in passing. W On the army leaving Ut toxeter on the 25th, the aid of a waggon and several horses were required to accompany it, for the con veyance of luggage. Not any of them were, how ever, returned, the army doubtless being unwilling to part with them ; and as the engagement for them had been made with their owners by the town offi cers, a demand was made upon the town for their value, which was paid and entered in the town accounts. During the time the army stayed at Uttoxeter, a man was slain at the same Edward Ball's who took the beer to Eaton. Under what cir cumstances the deed was committed, is left entirely to conjecture. It seems the town had no power to interfere with the man who was the slayer, as if it had, and had carried it out as in a previous case, there would have been entries in the town accounts, specifying expenses attending his trial or punishment. But there are not any. It may therefore be pre sumed he was one of the soldiers belonging to the army who had encountered a man of the opposite faction, and both probably being in liquor, an affray naturally took place, in which the man lost his life. The man who met with his death belonged to Dray cot-in-the-Clay, and the sum of 6s. was given for the conveyance of his body to that village. During the remaining part of the year, bodies of soldiers were either constantly in the town for its protection, or fl) Captain Symond's Diary."], [101, "UTTOXETER. 81 quartered upon it in the course of their movements. In June, soldiers were drawn up in Balance Close, which is land, then known by that name, overlooking the town at the south-east side of the New Bridge, at the Hockley. A number of soldiers were also quar tered at Blunt's Hall, where they were supplied with provisions from Uttoxeter. Again, on the 20th of July, soldiers were drawn up in some place called \" in the field,\" and before the close of the month, the men of Colonels Ashenhurst and Watson, appear to have been encamped in the Broad Meadow, where they were supplied with provisions. Uttoxeter is specially mentioned as being guarded in August, when the parliamentary forces went against Tutbury Castle for three nights, on each of which nights scouts were sent out from the town with guides, probably to Tutbury, to take account of the enemies' actions, or perhaps more bkely to report any danger apprehended to the town itself. At all events Ut toxeter was in considerable trepidation, and a mes senger was despatched to Alton for Colonel Bowyer, at the same time that Colonel Jackson's soldiers had their rendezvous on Uttoxeter Heath, having pre viously had their quarters at Somersall. In Sep tember, Sir William Vaughan had a guard at Ut toxeter, and for a fortnight in October General Poyns had Uttoxeter in his protection. The town ends and street ends were barricaded and blocked up by the soldiers, who were in the town under him. All this seems to have presaged something more serious, and it did iu reabty happen that a soldier was slain in <.;"], [102, "82 HISTORY OF the public streets. This incident is somewhat diffi cult to account for, but as barricades were made and the town ends were blocked up, evidently in full ex pectation of an attack upon it, it may very reasonably be supposed that a detachment of the enemy actually succeeded in breaking through the impediments, al though doubtless defended, and so a conflict ensued in the midst of the town, in which the individual re ferred to was cut down. Indeed if he had been kdled in the same unwarrantable manner as John Scott, the murderer would have met with the same summary retribution which we have just described. The body of the unfortunate soldier was wrapped in its winding sheet, and for \"making the grave, ring ing,\" beer, and for burying it in so slim a protection from the crushing earth, a sum of \" 4s. was expended.\" The accounts for the year ending in October, as dis bursed for the war, although not passed till February 5th, following, amounted to the sum of \u00a3975, 7s. ld. The battle of Naseby decided in effect the fate of the unfortunate monarch ; but even then, despairing as the royal cause had become, the beleagured and trusty garrison at Tutbury boldly held out in his favour. But the difficulty of retaining it after this crisis was, of course, proportionably increased. The disposal of the troops of the Parliamentarians con tracted the aheady limited district from which the garrison of Tutbury had to draw its subsistance,11' and rendered it impossible for provisions to be con- (1) Mosley's History of Tutbury."], [103, "83 UTTOXETER. veyed to the castle without a strong escort to protect those who furnished them. But even then, as might be expected, repeated encounters took jilace with the Parliamentarian horse, and two occurred so near Ut toxeter as the High Wood ; \u2014 Uttoxeter furnishing a great portion of the provisions to the castle. An account of two of these is preserved in the \" Gesta Britaniorum,\" by Sir George Warton, in the following notices : \" Feby. 15th, 1645. A sharp encounter between a party of the king's troops from Tutbury Castle, and a party of the Parliament's from Barton House in Derbyshire.\" On February 18th he also says, \" A party of the Parliament's forces routed by the king's forces near Uttoxeter.\" These occurrences are not mentioned in the constable's account, but on the 22nd of the same month it appears that two sol diers, who had been maimed by Tutbury soldiers in the High Wood, were conveyed to Carswall (no doubt Caverswall) at an of expense 2s. 6d., which leaves no doubt of their being in the engagement, and of be longing to the Parliament's forces. By these ac counts, which are probably the only sources of infor mation about the conflicts, we are not told whether any of either party were slain, although Sir Oswald Mosley seems to think such was the case. There were, doubtless, many other similar incidents occur ing near Uttoxeter, and oue in March of a less seri ous kind was that of the cavaliers carrying off a bay mare and a quantity of oats which were going from Uttoxeter to Tutbury. It appears probable, also, that Mr. Gilbert Gerrard lost six horses in the same"], [104, "84 HISTORY OF way, for at the same time he was paid the sum of \u00a321, in lieu of that number and their furniture. The pressure of the times were now very much felt in Uttoxeter ; arrears due to the army through Com missiary Ward drew upon it, and they were only ob tained by the force of a warrant It is possible, at the same time, that the tide of affairs had also some thing to do with it, by disinclining the town to sup port the hopeless cause of an already fallen monarch. If up to this time Uttoxeter had supplied chiefly the requirements of the Royalists, and now especially the besieged Royalists at Tutbury Castle who were in great want, the claims, also, of the Parliamen tarians were required to be entertained and promptly met now that in full vigour they were investing the castle, determining upon its surrender, and producing thereby the utmost interest in its vicinity. On the 30th of March, 1646, stores were sent from Uttoxeter to the \" Leaguer\" as he is called in the parochial statements, Sir Wilham Brereton, costing \u00a37, 4s. 6d. , and also again on the 8th of April, to the value of \u00a311, 2s. 9d ; and the occupiers of the castle, who had made repeated sallies with varied success, capitulated to the honourable terms proposed, on the 20th of April of the same year. On the 21st a number of Leek soldiers, who had aided either in taking or de fending Tutbury Castle, though the former is the more probable, arrived at Uttoxeter, on their return, where they were entertained with \" bread, cheese, and drink,\" and just coming hot from the scene of conflict, smeared with the blood, and aching with the"], [105, "85 UTTOXETER. tussle of war, had no doubt a great deal to tell to eager listeners of what they had done and 6een. From Tutbury the \" Leaguer,\" Sir William Brere ton, marched to Lichfield, where on the 29th of April, he was supplied by Uttoxeter with sixty strikes of oats, and for having gained Tutbury Castle, and for going against Dudley he was paid by demand on the 5th of May, the sum of \u00a316. On April 21st and 29th, and again on May 17th and 20th, many of the great guns which had been employed with such suc cess agaiust the Castle at Tutbury, and very likely others which had been used in defending it, arrived at Uttoxeter on their way of transport to Eccleshall and Lichfield. It is also to be observed that the quartering of General Fairfax's soldiers in October upon the town cost it \u00a320, and on the 13th Colonel Cromwell's, \u00a320. The latter took a number of horses with them when leaving for Tamworth, but two were killed. The other remaining noticable matter at the close of 1646, is that of Colonel Oak ley's men having their quarters upon Uttoxeter at a cost of \u00a313, 6s. 2d. The Colonel himself stayed at the Crown in the Market-place, and his expenses amounted to the moderate sum of 3s. 6d. The ac counts for the year ending October 1646, which, how ever, were not examined till the 28th of April, 1651, amounted to the tolerable sum of \u00a3796, 2s., the whole of which was the fruit of the war with the exception of a few pounds. The disbursements by the constables of Uttoxeter from October, 1646, to May, 1647, amounted to"], [106, "86 HISTORY OF \u00a397, 17s. 5d. At the beginning of 1647 Uttoxeter paid \u00a32, 10s. 4d. to fifteen men, to aid in pulling down Tutbury Castle, it having previously, in the month of May, 1646, contributed \u00a33, to a Captain Cloyd for spulling down the bulwarks at Tutbury. After this period Uttoxeter was greatly relieved from the oppressive demands made upon it whilst Tutbury Castle was occupied ; still the sums required by the British army, to which payments had commenced some time before, were of considerable amount and frequency. By the town accounts it does not seem whether Uttoxeter was now in a defensive position ; but in the church book of Mavesyn Ridware of August 27th, three or four mouths after the seige at Tutbury was over, it is noticed that the sum of 10s. lOd. was paid to twenty soldiers who had come from Uttoxeter from the seige. It should not be passed over, that in 1647 forty-six Egyptians, with a pass from Parliament to travel for the space of six successive months for relief, arrived at Uttoxeter, and were given the sum of 4s. Theh number and ap pearance must have excited considerable interest and proved a novelty. At the commencement of 1648 the constables lost \u00a31, Is. 7d. by exchanging \u00a33, 4s. 4d. of clipped money for \u00a32, 2s. 9d. in good money ; but what this money was, and how they had received it, no record is left. In May there was great fear of an insur rection in the town, and two men were placed in the church steeple, secretly, it is likely, to watch any risings of it. This seems to intimate how"], [107, "87 UTTOXETER. strongly and dangerously party feeling and opinion manifested themselves, although it does not appear that any more alarming evidence of it took place. At this time, and for several years, the town paid every three months to the British army \u00a313, and up wards. In June of 1648 the demolition of Tutbury Castle was still proceeded with, and a demand was made upon Uttoxeter for men to assist in the barbar ous work, but there was great reluctance in the town to agree to it, and to free it from so undesirable an alternative the sum of \u00a34 was given, and the work of spoliation left to less reluctant hands. In August of this year the church was desecrated in the way many other churches were at this time. A number of Scotch prisoners arrived at Uttoxeter, as others on several subsequent periods did, and they were lodged in the church. They were a violent set of fellows, and a proper guard could not have been had upon them. They broke up the planks of the church floor, broke many of the windows, and left the sacred edifice in a state of perfect filth. The windows cost nearly \u00a31 in repairing, and so detestable a state was the church in, that the cleaning of it amounted to nearly half as much. The accounts were next passed October 20th, 1648, but the amount is not given, and the items entered, which amount to about \u00a344, do not contain the whole of the payments made by the constables. Only the more remarkable items, on ac count of which payments were made, appear to be preserved. In 1649 the accounts were taken on the 7th No-"], [108, "88 HISTORY OF vember, and were \u00a3225, Ils. 5d., cheifly in pay to \" the army,\" but from then till the time of passing the accounts again on March 3rd, 1651, there is little to notice except that in August of 1650 there was a thanksgiving-day when a person named Percival was paid for \" warding,\" at which time there was a guard of sixteen soldiers at the Cock, belonging to Mr. Thomas Gilbert, the publichouse which remained till lately, where the brewery premises are. The three month's pay to the army, which had increased to \u00a320, ceased in August of 1650, The accounts, when pas .sed, appear to have been about \u00a344. The opening of 1651 found Uttoxeter in a state of internal danger, but the constables were determined to suppress any popular manifestation, and a warrant was carried into effect for searching and seizing Papist's and delinquent's arms. It seems that in April monthly pay to the army was renewed, when \u00a320 was paid to it, and in June another monthly payment was made to it of upwards of \u00a330. In August the magazine of the army was at Uttoxeter, and a number of teams were required, some of which were obtained by warrant in the night from Dove ridge, intimating the necessity of great despatch in the case, to convey them to Tamworth. One of the teams belonged to Mr. Peter Lightfoot. who was paid \u00a31, 4s. for its use. In August a number of Uttoxeter men were pressed for the militia, their names being John Clark, Fran. Allen, Phil. Nead ham, Richard Wilkinson, and Thomas Vernon. They were each provided with a horse and a saddle"], [109, "89 UTTOXETER. and 7s. 6d. The militia horse were called in again in September, but in November the militia horse and foot soldiers were summoned for some purpose to Cheadle, where they remained three days. Several lots of Scotch prisoners were at Uttoxeter during the year, in custody, one lot of which was being taken from Chesterfield to Stafford. The accounts were not audited till May 3rd, 1651, and given as .i?304, 3s. 2d. , and must comprise many more items thau those which have been preserved. By this time the entries in the town accounts had become much rarer, and only a few items of interest appear in the course of several years. Several of them are, however, of real interest. In 1652 one entry is very curious, especially as there are no circumstances recorded as attending it to afford any clue as to its meaning. It is a notice of pub lic warning in Uttoxeter to set water at every door. On April 14th one Robert Adin was prosecuted as a traitor ; and in February, 1653, some excited indi vidual disturbed the congregation in the church and was conveyed to Stafford for trial. At this time the town paid year by year to the army the sum of \u00a367, 10s. The proclamation of the Lord Protecter was duly observed, and on May 29th, 1660 a similar demonstration was made on the advent to the throne of King Charles the II. On his coronation day the spirit of royalty had thoroughly regained its ascend ancy in the town. Whilst only Is. was spent over the proclamation of Cromwell, 5s. was spent in ringing on the proclamation of the king, and 8s. when he was"], [110, "90 HISTORY OF crowned ; besides which the town went to the expense of \" painting the royal arms and four tribes.\" The expenses occasioned by the political necessities of the times had now dwindled down to comparatively small amounts, except in 1667, when two sums of \u00a344, Is. ld. each, one of \u00a314, 13s. 8Jd, and another of \u00a329, 7s. 5d. no trifle, it may be thought, to be levied upon the town during the three first months of the year, were required to be paid for royal aid. From the year 1653 to fl660 or 1661, most of the leaves are torn out of the constables' accounts. At a fair calculation, however, it may be inferred that during those seven or eight years the expenses caused to the town by the times could not have been less than \u00a3250 a year, making something like a total for the whole period of at least \u00a32000. On June 1st, 1688, Uttoxeter presented a scene of rejoicing such as, perhaps, had not before occurred in it. It was occasioned by the release and acquit tal of the seven bishops whom King James the II. had cast into the Tower, and brought to trial on the charge of an alleged false and seditious libel, pre tended to be grounded on a petition which they had made to the King for not reading in the churches the Declaration of Indulgence to all Dissenters from the Church. !1) Bonfires were lit in High Street, at the churchyard, and at the Market Cross ; drummers were employed to swell the acclamation, which was national ; the watchmen and populace of Uttoxeter (1) Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia, Art. James."], [111, "UTTOXETER. 91 were treated with ale, and the more elite of the town both on that day and the previous one at the \" Crown\" (which was a day of thanksgiving for the Prince of Wales), indulged in ale and wine to the score of \u00a32. 2s. At the close of the old accounts in 1688 another interesting item appears, in which \" an alarm\" is mentioned. Coals were collected for fires, and a quantity for the same purpose was paid for by Mr. Shallcross. There was considerable excitement in the place ; strangers were brought into it by the frightening notifications, the fear occasioned by which they aud the towns-people did theh best to allay by draughts \u2014 about a guinea's worth \u2014 of a Mrs. Nor ton's ale. This was the alarm produced by the men employed by the Prince of Orange, or his friends, to run or ride through every town in England in one day crying \" fire and sword ! the French are coming ! \" which filled people's minds with the utmost consternation and terror. Uttoxeter does not furnish any particulars for the attention of the local historian from the interesting period just passed through until the rebellion of 1745, when Prince Charles Edward, called the Pretender, sought to recover the fallen fortunes of the Stuart dynasty by an appeal to arms. Previous to this he had made two unsuccessful attempts upon Scotland, but being encouraged by the zealous partizans of his house in England, and flattered by France with a promise of powerful assistance, he resolved to make one more attempt for the throne of England. The nucleus of"], [112, "92 HISTORY OF his army consisted of one hundred men, formed by a French officer, and it was pretended they were for the East India Company's services, and they were put on board a small frigate carrying eighteen guns, which was joined by a French man-of-war, with sixty guns, arms for several thousand men, and about \u00a3400,000 sterling. He succeeded in landing in Scot land in August, where he was joined by about two thousand men. The number being shortly after in creased to five thousand, he ventured with them towards the south, after having gained several minor successes, including the memorable battle of Preston pans, and continued his course to Carlisle, and so on to Newcastle, Manchester, Macclesfield, and through Leek aud Ashbourue to Derby. The army of the Duke of Cumberland was at this time, November 28th, forming in Staffordshire. His troops lay in a line betwixt Tamworth and Stafford, with a line of cavalry iu front. They consisted of 7500 veteran soldiers, 3000 newly raised solders, 1400 veteran horse, and 800 newly raised horse, the whole being 12,700 men.'1' The Duke had taken up this position, expecting that the Cavalier would have attempted to have proceeded by Birmingham to Lon don. On receiving informatiou that the rebels were at Derby the Duke despatched thither a gentleman of the name of Birch to ascertain their strength. This person, the better to conceal his purpose, bought a pint of peas at a shop in that town, and put them (1) A History of England, published soon after."], [113, ""], [114, "LORD GARDNER'S HOUSE, UTTOXETER."], [115, "UTTOXETER. 93 into a pocket ; taking, however, a quantity in one hand, he dropped a single pea into an empty pocket for each file of the Pretender's army as it passed. On the whole having filed off he directly returned at an almost inconceivable speed for those days, and communicated the intelligence of the number of the enemy to the Duke.a) The Duke thereupon started to Uttoxeter, having in the mean time sent to Par bament to know if he must proceed to Derby to at tack the enemy there. He came through Abbott's Bromley with his troops, and there are those living who knew well an old woman, named Ann Buxtone, alias Nan Brown, who used to talk of having seen them, and of having displayed her best manners be fore the Duke, and received a shilling from his hands. The Duke of Cumberland remained at Uttoxeter two nights, waiting a reply to his message, and was hospitably entertained by an ancestor of Sir Allan Gardner, at Uttoxeter House, at present, and for many years past occupied by Doctor Taylor, where he slept two nights in the tapestried room. The sin gle troop of horse with him were drawn up for review in the croft at the back of the same residence. It was on the 4th of December that the young cavalier arrived at Derby with his followers, num bering about 7000 men, with fifteen field-pieces and fifty covered carts with ammunition. Their first act was to hold a council of war, but the only resolution (1) This information was told to Dr. Taylor by a descendant of the same gentleman."], [116, "94 HISTORY OF passed was to make a levy upon the inhabitants of about \u00a33000 besides making a successful demand on tbe post-office for \u00a3100, and committing various ravages upon the town and neighbourhood. They remained at Derby two days, when they retreated from it with confused precipitation, through fear of surprise from the Duke of Cumberland's army, leav ing behind them swords, pistols, targets, hot, pow der, and other articles. Their loss of these was, however, made up by the plundering and robberies they committed in going back towards the north. Gentlemen's houses were entered and robbed far and near; horses were forcibly taken away; and at Hang ing Bridge one Humphrey Brown was shot dead for refusing to comply with their demand for his horse. Various gentlemen's houses in Ashbourne did not escape.'1- The late Mr. Crossley ofthe Old Turnpike, Uttoxeter, who died in 1835 at the age of 100 years and 8 months, was then a young man at Brailsford, and he, with a horse and cart, were pressed into the service of the Pretender as he returned.'2' Indeed the Pretender's followers on retreating spread them selves as far as Foston, and the people in the neighbourhood for miles round were terrified, and drove off theh horses and cattle. Even at Kny persley, near Uttoxeter, the then owner of the' place, (1) Hutton's History of Derby. History of Ashbourne. Published by Messrs. Hobson. (2) Communicated by the Rev. J.

And the curious circumstance is told that a number of females collected at Foston Bridge, with red petticoats over them, to intimidate the rebels, which gave rise to a song or ballad, which was printed, and some portions of which, relating the particulars, I have heard recited. Some of these and other deeply interesting remi niscences of the times I have the pleasure of giving from a communication of F. Cope, Esq., of Uttoxe ter. This gentleman was born at an ancestral place in the woodlands, in 1778, and his family had melan choly recollections of this exciting period. The tra ditions of the neighbourhood were the frequent theme of a large household at night, as they sat round the blazing wood fire, of a large old-fashioned house, when his father, surrounded by his family, and aroused by what he felt so much interest in, would recount the traditions of the family as far back as Henry VIII., when they held only from the Crown \u2014 how at the Revolution they suffered for their loyalty, when six brothers, each standing six feet high and upwards'1' joined King Charles I. at York, and all perished except one, from whom he is descended ; how the Bagots established the Blue Coat Hunt and Bowling-greens at the Hartshorn Inn at Lich field, the Talbot, Rugely, and the White Hart, (1) Descendants of the same family now living are equally tall and powerful men."], [118, "96 HISTORY OF Uttoxeter, to keep up the loyal feeling towards the Stuarts ; how they were betrayed and a king's messenger sent to secure theh papers, and take the chairman, secretary, and other leading men into cus tody; how these parts were so loyal to the Stuarts'1' that he (the messenger) was detained at Lichfield for post-horses, and finally forced to go forward with his jaded beasts to Ridware, when he applied for assist ance and information to C. Robinson, Esq., who gave him an excellent dinner, a bait and a rest for his horses and two guides \u2014 one to show him or his assist ant the way to Rugely, and the other the way to Ut toxeter, where Mr. Robinson knew that the whole hunt was dining. However, while thus relieving the officer he despatched his son on foot to Colton and Rugely, and a faithful servant on his horse to Uttoxeter. Leaving Ridware the messenger in time got to the White Hart, found the room there crowded with bachanalians, rosy, and as the Scots say, sou : mak ing his way with one Copestake, a lapidary, who was constable, to the head of the room, he seized Sir Walter Bagot, and Mr. Daniel, the vicar of Bromley, who was secretary.

But unfortunately the fireplace told tales ; evidently much paper had been recently burnt, so the messenger seized several of the party \u2014 Sir W. B. and parson Daniel, being the principal \u2014 and believing that Mr. Daniel might probably have papers at home, he despatched Copestake, who know ing a private road by Uttoxeter High Wood and through Bagot's park, proceeded that way to Bromley to search his house. Again, however, they were foiled, for one of the young Mynors was at the dinner, and had aheady apprised both the Mynors of Knypersley, and the Cope family; so the grandfather of my inform ant and the Mynors were on the alert, but apparently drinking aud enjoying themselves only at Mr. Cope's, in front of whose house the road went. Copestake was soon seen approaching, and as they saw him turn towards the door here they waited for him jug in hand. Thus he stopped to drink, and one jug suc ceeded another till Copestake was incapable of pro ceeding. Meanwhile, my informant's (Mr. Cope's) father, then in his 'teens, had been sent to Bromley, and on getting there called on old Waltham, the thirdborough ; together they went to the churchwar den, a John Wetton \u2014 all old loyalists \u2014 and pro ceeded from his back-door to the vicarage \u2014 getting over the rails and crossing the garden. They searched the vicarage-house and finding the vicar's desk, took the back out of it, and, abstracting the papers it contained, bundled them up and took them away. Meanwhile the messenger and his prisoners had left ii"], [120, "98 HISTORY OF Uttoxeter for Colton and Rugely ; but the former re collecting that he had come that road in his way to Uttoxeter, calculated that it must go either through or just by Abbot's-Bromley ; so be began to think he had been wilfully misled, and insisted on being first taken to Bromley. Thus the chaise stopped abso lutely at the front door of the parsonage as Mr. Cope's father, with the thirdborough and the churchwarden, were getting over the pailing out of the parsonage garden with the papers. So the affair ended. Cope stake was taken up and slightly punished for drunk enness. He afterwards rejoiced that he had not been the means of any one being sacrificed through his attention to duty, and he left Iris halbert at the house in token thereof, where it remained many years, and where it may even now be preserved. Wetton and Waltham had each a grant of land on a long lease, which is now about half expired, from Sir Walter Bagot. Mr. Cope's father, who was always considered the head tenant of this part of the estate, had done his duty, and was, to his death, looked upon with great favour. After tills the feeling in favour of the Stuarts be came much cooled ; small bands of pretended or licentious partizans ravaged the country; and the treachery and mistrust which existed caused the stocks and pillory at Uttoxeter to be in frequent requisition. The patience of those who were faithful begun to wear out, so that when the Scots entered Derby a general mistrust of them pervaded the whole country, and serving-men and labourers bid them-"], [121, "UTTOXETER. 99 selves for fear of been pressed into the king's service. Thus, for instance, the present Mr. Cope's grand father was, at the time of the occupation of Derby, left for days together with one of his sons, a servant-boy, and an old man. Maids and women there were in abundance, but the men had fled. It being in so wooded and secluded a situation, everyone who could claim acquaintance fled to Knypersley, or the Forest Banks, to be out of harm's way. Many an hoiuvMr. Cope says he has wandered, when a boy, through the deep ravines which penetrate the Forest Banks, the cliffs of Bagot's Park, or Buttermilk and Dixon's Hills, sauntering in a moody way among the places where horses had been picketed day by day ; and where silver and pewter ware, and other utensils, then con sidered valuable, had been deposited. Thus in the narrow ravine which runs up into the park called Frane Coppice Bank, Mr. Cope's father and the old servant man stood sentinel day by day alternately, and watched at night while the cattle grazed in the fields, and which were taken up again before day light \u2014 his grandfather aud the women attending to the cows and dairy, and occasionally making excur sions across the Dove to Sudbury and Scropton to hear the news. Thus, according to an old song, it was narrated that the rebels penetrated as far as Scropton ; and were frightened away by the wood land lasses, who, peering over Draycott Bridge, were told to return, as the Highlanders were plundering the houses. This song, as far as can be recollected, was very rude, and not particularly delicate in its"], [122, "100 HISTORY OF allusions. It was, as such rude productions fre quentlly are, coarsely but keenly satirical, and it enumerated the names of owners whose houses were ravaged, many of whose families remained to Mr. Cope's time, and some \u2014 as Steel, Greatorex, Smith, Manlove, and Taverner \u2014 even to the present. Thus : \" Manlove was a cudgel player Us courage and renown, Who beat the GiUy from his house, And fairly cracked his crown.\" igain the old women of the Woodlands volunteered to look what was doing at Scropton, and, it raining, they pulled off their red flannel petticoats, putting them as cloaks over their shoidders, and skulking under the hedges in large numbers, so alarmed the Scots that a panic seized them, and they fled with theh booty. The chorus had for its substance the following particulars. From one house they took a pig (which the owners had killed to hide con veniently) and put it across a horse. They remained however to run the links of the pig-puddings, just made and hot, upon a pole, that they might carry them away more safely. In the mean time some of the red petticoats neared the village, whom the Scots who remained perceiving, took for soldiers of the Royal army, and they fled, struck with alarm. The song leads us to believe that the pig-pudding stealers escaped through the back door of a cow-house, and, jumping from a heap of manure, fell up to the neck in a cesspool. The lines were something like this \u2014 \" With the puddings strung upon a pole They jumped from the muck-hill into the muck-hole.\""], [123, "101 UTTOXETER.

On the rumoured approach of the insurgents at that memor able period, a worthy farmer, then living near Leek, deemed it prudent to conceal his valuables, and had for that purpose raised a flagstone in the stable. At the suggestion, however, of an old woman who was standing by, he changed his plan, and buried his treasure in a heap of manure in the farmyard. Amongst other articles so buried were forty-eight ' sack bottles' full of home-brewed ale ; and when the storm was blown over the owner coming to ex amine his deposit, found the liquor exceedingly ripe and good.

From Ashbourne Prince Charles continued his re treat through Yorkshire to Carlisle, his progress to the heart of the kingdom and back with about 7000 men having been effected in the presence of two re gular armies under Marshal Wade and the Duke of Cumberland, in the depth of winter. After crossing into Scotland he attempted the seige of Stirling Cas tle, and Lord Murray gained a complete victory over General Hawley at Falkirk. The siege of Stirling Castle was raised, and on the 15th of April Prince Charles resolved to make a night attack upon the Duke's army, which had followed him ; but it being two o'clock in the morning when they had yet three miles to march to where the Duke lay, and being weary and dispirited, they retraced theh steps to Cul loden, where they had previously been drawn up in order of battle. The Duke of Cumberland had heard of the attempt. About eight o'clock his forces were observed on theh march, and about one o'clock the king's troops opened a heavy cannonade, which was but feebly returned. The Highlanders suffered se verely and became impatient ; the Mackintosh regi ment broke from the line and drove back the king's troops sword in hand, but were brought to the ground by a terrible fire.

After a lapse of 39 years Uttoxeter became the scene of an incident all the more remarkable be cause it is associated with so distinguished a name and person as Dr. Samuel Johnson. It is the act of penance by the celebrated Doctor which he self-in flicted for refusing to obey a request of his father's when a boy at home. It forms a striking feature in his biography, and has been celebrated in no less direct a way in papers, some of an ephemeral and others of a lasting character. Some have written of it philosophically, as Thomas Carlyle ; others poeti cally, as Walter Thornbury ; whilst others have tried to draw lessons from it for the young, or cautions to the Christian in matters of faith. Thomas Car lyle says, \" The picture of Samuel Johnson standing bareheaded in the Market-place there is one of the grandest and saddest we can paint.\" -1' As it is a matter of so much interest I will give the fullest particulars of it I am enabled to do. The father of Doctor Johnson was Michael John son, a native of Cubley, in Derbyshire, a place not many miles from Uttoxeter. After some vicissitudes he became estabhshed as a bookseller at Lichfield, and amongst other places he was in the habit of attending Uttoxeter on Market days with books for sale. Doctor Johnson, his son, spent two years when (1) Thomas Carlyle's Works, vol. iii. p. 89."], [127, "UTTOXETER. 105 verging upon his twentieth year, in learning his father's business ; and a few years back there were books in existence in Lichfield said to have been bound by his own hands. It was during this period when his father, being unwell, requested him to go to Uttoxeter to attend the book-stall, a desire which, probably in a fit of pride, he refused to obey. In contrition for this act of disobedience, towards the close of his life, in 1784, he repaired to the spot where the book-stall had stood in Uttoxeter Market place, and there remained for a considerable time bareheaded in the rain by way of expiatory penance.'1' At the time this took place Doctor Johnson wag on a visit at Miss Seward's aud his other friends at Lichfield. During his stay he was missed one morn ing from the breakfast table, and on an inquiry being made of the servants, they stated that they under stood that he had set off from Lichfield at a very early hour without mentioning to any of the family whither he was going. The day passed without the return of the illustrious guest, and the party began to be very uneasy on his account, when, just before the supper hour the door opened and the Doctor stalked into the room. A solemn silence ensued of a few minutes, nobody daring to inquire the cause of his absence, which was at length relieved by Johnson addressing the lady of the house in the following manner: \u2014 \" Madam, I beg your pardon for the ab ruptness of my departure from your house this morn- (1) A Short Accouut of Lichfield, 1819."], [128, "106 HISTORY OF ing, but I was constrained to it by my conscience. Fifty years ago, madam, on this day, I committed a breach of filial piety which has ever since lain heavy on my mind, and has not till this day been expiated. My father, you recollect, was a bookseller, and had long been in the habit of attending Uttoxeter mar ket, and opening a stall of his books during that day. Confined to his bed by indisposition he requested me, this time fifty years ago, to visit the market and at tend the market in his place. But, madam, my pride prevented me from doing my duty, and I gave my father a refusal. To do away the sin of this disobe dience, I this day went in a post-chaise to Uttoxeter, and going into the market at the time of high busi ness, uncovered my head, and stood with it bare an hour before the stall which my father formerly used, exposed to the sneers of the standers by, and the in clemency of the weather \u2014 a penance by which I trust I have propitiated heaven for this only instance of my contumely to my father.\"'11 A confession and contri tion more touching never fell from the lips of a great and venerable man. Is it then any wonder that distinguished writers should so frequently notice the circumstance ? or that any one should even visit Uttoxeter to try to see the spot consecrated by Johnson's tears ? Scarcely, however, would one think that a gentleman who hved three thousand miles away, although happening (1) Johnsoniana and Warner's tour through the Northern Counties of England."], [129, "107 UTTOXETER. to be in England, would come to Uttoxeter for such a purpose. Yet, so it has been. No less noted a person than Nathaniel Hawthorn, of America, author of \" Twice told Tales,\" and \" Transforma tion,\" visited Uttoxeter in 1857, to see the spot where this remarkable incident took place. It appears nearly all concern, locally, about the place had passed out of people's minds, until this eminent foreigner, after seeing Uttoxeter for the intention stated, wrote a description of his visit for one of the annuals, and which was copied into the local papers, and perused with great eagerness. The production, as might be expected from so vivid a pen, was the oc casion of several letters appearing in a local paper,'1' but without finding out, as .they were intended to do, the place where the Doctor stood. The paper is so pleasing in its style, and so inter esting as proceeding from such an author, and relat ing in the manner it does to such a subject, that any thing but an apology is required for giving it in this place. Mr. Hawthorn proceeds \u2014 \" At Lichfield, in St. Mary's Square, I saw a statue of Doctor John son, elevated some ten or twelve feet high. The statue is colossal, though not more so than the moun tainous Doctor, who sits in a chair with a pile of big books underneath it, looking down upon the specta tors with a broad, heavy, benignant countenance, very like Johnson's portraits. The figure is im mensely massive, a vast ponderosity of stone, not (1) The Era."], [130, "108 HISTORY OF finely sphitualized, nor indeed fully humanized, but rather resembling a great boulder than a man. On the pedestal are three bas-reliefs. In the first John son is represented as a mere baby, seated on an old man's shoulders, resting his chin on the bald head which he embraces with his arms, and listening to Doctor Sacheverel. In the second table he is seen riding to school on the backs of two of his comrades, while a third boy supports him in the rear. The third has-relief possesses to my mind a good deal of pathos. It shows Johnson in the Market-place of Uttoxeter doing penance for an act of disobedience to lus father fifty years before. He stands bare headed, very sad and woe-be-gone, with the wind and rain driving against him, whilst some market-people and children gaze awe-stricken into his face, and an aged man and woman with clasped hands are praying for him. These latter personages, I fancy (though in close proximity there are living ducks and dead poultry), represent the spirit of Johnson's father and mother, lending what aid they can to lighten his half century's burden of remorse. I never heard of this statue. It seems to have no reputation as a work of art, and very possibly may deserve none. Yet I found it somewhat touching and effective, perhaps because my interest in the sturdiest of Englishmen has always been peculiarly strong ; and especially the above-described bas-relief freshened my sense of a wonderful beauty and pathos in the incident it com memorates. So the next day I left Lichfield for Ut toxeter on a purely sentimental pilgrimage (by rail-"], [131, "UTTOXETER. 109 way, however) to see the spot where Johnson per formed his penance. Boswell, I think, speaks of the town as being about nine miles from Lichfield, but the map would indicate a much greater distance, and by rail, passing from one to another, as much as seventeen or eighteen miles. \" I have always had an idea of old Michael [John son's journey thither on foot on the morning of the market-days, selling books through the busy hours, and returning home at night. This cannot well have been. \" Arriving at Uttoxeter station, the first thing I saw in a convenient vicinity was the tower and tall grey spire of a church. It is but a very short walk from the station up to the town. It had been my previous impression that the market-place of Uttoxeter lay immediately round about the church ; and if I re member the narration aright, Johnson describes his father's book-stall as standing in the market-place, close beside the sacred edifice. But the church has merely a street of ordinary width passing round it, whilst the market-place, though near at hand, is not really contiguous, nor would its tlirong and bustle be apt to overflow their bounds and surge against the churchyard and old grey tower. Nevertheless, a walk of a minute or two would bring a person from the j centre of the market-place to the church door, and Michael Johnson might very well have placed his stall, aud laid out his hterary ware, in the corner at the tower's base ; better there perhaps than in the busy centre of an agricultural market. But the pic-"], [132, "110 HISTORY OF turesqueness and full impressiveness of the story re quire that Johnson doing his penance should have been the very neucleus of the crowd \u2014 the midmost man of the market-place \u2014 the centre figure of me mory and remorse \u2014 contrasting with, and overawing the sultry materialism around him. I am resolved, therefore, that the true site of his penance was in the market-place. This is a pretty spacious and irregu lar vacuity, surrounded by houses and shops, some of them old, with red tiled roofs ; others wearing a pre tence of newness, but probably as old as the rest. \" The only other thing that impressed me in Ut toxeter was the abundance of publiehouses \u2014 one at every step or two \u2014 ' Red Lions,' ' White Harts,' ' BuUs Heads,' ' Blue Bells,' ' Cross Keys.' These are probaby for the accommodation of the agricultural visitors on market days. At any rate, I appeared to be the only guest in Uttoxeter on the day of my visit, and had but an infintessimal portion of patron age to distribute amongst so many inns. \" I stepped into one of these rustic hostehies and got my dinner \u2014 bacon and greens, a chop, and a gooseberry pudding, enough for six yeomen, besides ale, all for a shilling and sixpence. This hospitable inn, miscalled the ' Nag's Head,' and standing be sides the market-place, was as likely as any other to have contained old Michael Johnson in the days when he used to come thither to sell books. He perhaps had eaten his bacon and greens, and drank his ale, and smoked his pipe in the very room where I now sat \u2014 a low, ancient room, with a red brick floor"], [133, "UTTOXETER. 111 and whitwashed ceiling, traversed by rough beams, the whole in the rudest fashion, but extremely neat. Neither did the room lack ornament, the walls being hung with engravings of prize oxen and other pretty prints, and the mantelpiece adorned with earthenware figures of shepherdesses. But still as I sipped my ale I glanced through the window into the sunny market-place, and wished I could honestly fix on one spot more than another as likely to have been the spot where Johnson stood to do his penance. How strange and stupid it is that tradition should not have marked and kept in mind the very place ! How shameful ! \u2014 nothing less than that \u2014 that there should be no local memorial of this incident, as beautiful and as touching a passage as can be cited out of any human life \u2014 no inscription of it, as sacred as a verse of scripture, on the walls of the church ! no statue of the venerable and illustrious penitent in the market-place to throw a wholesome awe over its traffic, its earthliness, its selfishness. Such a statue, if the piety of man did not raise it, might almost have been expected to grow up out of the pavement of its own accord on the spot that had been watered by Johnson's remorseless tears, and by the rain that dropped from him. \" Well, my pilgrimage had not turned out a very successful one. There being no train till late in the afternoon I spent I know not how many hours in Uttoxeter, and, to say the truth, was heartily tired of it, my penance being a great deal longer than Doctor Jolmson's. Moreover, I forgot, until it was"], [134, "112 HISTORY OF too late, to snatch the opportunity to repent of some sins. Whilst waiting at the station I asked a boy who sat near me \u2014 a school-boy of some twelve or thirteen years old, whom I should take to be a clergy man's son \u2014 I asked him whether he had ever heard the story of Doctor Johnson ; how he stood an hour doing penance beside that church whose spire rose before us ? The boy stared and answered ' No ! ' I inquired if no such story was known or talked about in Uttoxeter ? ' No ! ' said the boy, ' that I ever heard of.\" Just think of the absurd little town knowing nothing of its one memorable incident which sanctifies it to the heart of a stranger from three thousand miles over the sea ! Just think of the fathers and mothers of Uttoxeter never telling their children the sad and lovely story which might have such a blessed influence on theh young days, and spare them many a pang hereafter.\" This sketch by a foreigner about Johnson's pe nance is very touching and beautiful. It has been mentioned that it gave rise to inquiry at the time, about the place where the Doctor did penance, but without being found out. I made inquiries myself amongst old people then, which resulted, about two years afterwards, in the place being discovered. Amongst others of whom I inquired was Joseph Twigg. He had then no recollection of any such occurrence ; but about a year and a half, or two years, afterwards, when he was no longer able to get out of the house, on going to see him (he being at that time in his eighty-sixth year), asked me \" if I had"], [135, "113 UTTOXETER. not once asked him whether some one, when he was a lad, had done penance in the Market-place ? \" I told him I most probably had, and that a very great man had once done penance thereabout. He then related that he had a recollection of something of the kind. He said that, when he was a lad, his father, one market day, came into the house late, to dinner, and lus mother asked him why he had not come sooner ? To which he answered, \" that he had been looking at a man standing in the Market-place, at the pillory, without his hat, doing penance.\" The pillory, to which the stocks were connected at that date, stood, he informed me, in the centre of Bear Hill, the open space at the east end of the Market place. This is a considerable distance from the con duit and weighing machine, where the stocks stood in recent years, and where it was supposed the Doctor imposed upon himself the penance. Twigg also told me that what his father stated so struck him for its singularity, that either that day or early the next morning, he went to Bear Hill himself, and although he did not see the renowned penitent, he saw the rubbish and stones which had beeu cast at him in derision by children. My informant was then about eight years of age, and was therefore quite old enough to have the recollection of so strange an affair \u2014 par ticularly as he visited the spot himself where it took place \u2014 impressed upon his memory. That the circumstance thus related by the old man, who fixes the site at Bear Hill, is identical with the so-called expiatory act of Dr. Johnson, there is i"], [136, "114 HISTORY OF scarcely a doubt. By an attentive look at the bas relief on his monument at Lichfield, it will be per ceived that the figures confirm the attempt to show that Bear Hill is the spot where \" the one memorable incident\" in the life of Johnson was carried out. Besides the representation of the aged persons in the group, the nose of a pig obtrudes itself; also dead fowls are observed to hang over the old-fashiohed rails. The designer of the cartoon could not have gained his ideas from the Market-place, strictly so-called \u2014 particularly not from anything near the conduit, but from Bear Hill. There the pig market used to be held, and besides the space allotted to the pillory and stocks, there was a square portion railed out for the protection of a sort of reser voir, which had an immensely large iron grate over it, swelling upwards half a yard,'1' and these must have been the rails which the designer of the monument had seen the dead fowls hanging over. Fixing, then, the centre of Bear Hill as the place of tills singular incident, there is no necessity any longer to contend with the paradox of its happening at the conduit, where the view of the church is obstructed, and yet in sight of the church at the same time. At Bear Hill the church is quite conspicuous, and both are only a few yards from each other, and it was also then an invariable feature of the market that it ex tended a con.siderable way into each street, so that (1) A gentleman is living who recollects that this was the clicking hole, the cucking-st'iol projecting from the pillory (to which it was fastened) over it."], [137, "115 UTTOXETER. there is no doubt it \"surged\" quite round the old church-yard wall.'1' Adding, therefore, these views to the statements of Joseph Twigg, any doubt as to the actual spot where Dr. Johnson relieved his mind of the burdening sense of his guilt, for refusing to comply with a lawful requirement of his father, when a boy, may be considered at an end. The supposed circumstances and features of the market day when the penance was performed have been made the subject ofthe following pathetic hnes, by Walter Thornbury, which appeared in \" Once a Week,\" for 1861 : \u2014 A country road on market-day (Is what I fee arise), Crowded with farmers, ruddy men, Muffled up to the eyes ; For cold and bitter rain beats fast From the grey cheerless skies.

Mr. Norris, stationer, possesses a pen and ink sketch of Dr. Johnson and Captain Astle (or rather the Rev.

By Mr. Norris's permission a reduced fac-simile is here en graved. As to the inn where old Michael Johnson staid when he came to Uttoxeter with books, it is perhaps more likely to have been the Red Lion Inn than the Nag's Head, which I beUeve was not then in existence. But of course nothing but conjecture can be given as to any place he made his calling house for refre.shment. When Johnson did his pen-"], [142, "120 HISTORY OF ance there was another inn at Bear Hill, close to the Red Lion, and as it was a posting house, it is not at all improbable that the chaise which brought him to Uttoxeter in 1784 was drawn up there.

Garle takes the liberty of acquainting lus friends and the public, that, having taken and laid to his house the assembly room, stables, and other conveniences Lately belonging to the ' New Star ' Inn, and made various other alterations and enlargements, he has very complete and desirable accommodation for gen tlemen travellers and others who will honour him with their company.

He must consequently be regarded not only as the ear liest medium by which books got disseminated in the neighbourhood, but as the earhest pioneer in intel lectual and moral improvement of whom Uttoxeter can boast, and of whose name, therefore, it ought to be proud.

The town was illuminated, and Mr. Samuel Bently, then in his 80th year, appeared as the personification of Peace at his house door, with a laurel wreath on his head, and he also gave memory to the event by the following invocation : \u2014 \"INVOCATION TO PEACE, By Mr. Samuel Bentley, of Uttoxeter, March loth, 1802.

About twenty years ago, the Queen Dowager also passed through Uttoxeter to Alton Towers. A halt was made at the White Hart Hotel, Carter-street, where the Yeomanry Cavalry were drawn up to protect with military formality her carriage, and escort her to Alton. About this period there was also a matter before the inhabitants of Uttoxeter in which they were deeply interested. Keference is made to the circum stances attending the birth of William John Fox, Esq., which, with his majority and marriage, have an historical importance in the estimation of the local chronicler. These circumstances were attendant upon a course of litigation which was instituted about"], [146, "124 HISTORY OF 1835, and continued through several years, having issue to the question who was the legal inheritor of considerable landed estates and other property which had belonged to Mr. Fox, an old and exceedingly wealthy inhabitant of Uttoxeter, then recently de ceased. Amongst the legal proceedings arising out of this question, was the consignment of Mrs. Fox, who had been married to the deceased gentleman a very short time before his death, to the care of a jury of matrons, of Uttoxeter, until the birth of a posthu mous child of which she declared herself pre gnant, and who it was contended, on her behalf, would be the heir or heiress to Mr. Fox's estates. The novelty of this proceeding, taken by direction of the Court, excited considerable interest at the time, and has since been referred to in several works on medical jurisprudence. In due time the child (the present Mr. W. J. Fox) was born, and when, after protracted litigation, involving trials at nisi prius at Stafford, Chester, and Gloucester Court of Appeal, the joy of the people of Uttoxeter, who all along had been faithful to the cause of the widow and fatherless, found expression in every conceivable way.(i) It was to be expected that the attainment of his majority by a young gentleman, the circumstances surrounding whose birth were so peculiar, would not be permitted to pass by unnoticed. On this event, which took place on Thursday, October 14th, 1856, he was invited to a public dinner by the gentlemen (1) \" Staffordshire Advertiser.\""], [147, "125 UTTOXETER. of the town and neighbourhood, which was held uuder the presidency of the late Joseph Bladon, Esq., at the Town Hall, Uttoxeter. A very full assembly did honour to the occasion. On the same day Mr. Fox himself gave to the poor of Uttoxeter a sub stantial quantity of coal and beef, and during the excessively severe winter of 1860-61, he again gene rously bestowed upon the poor of the parish about thirty-five tons of coal. The marriage of W. J. Fox, Esq., with Ellen Ebzabeth, eldest daughter of Thomas Bladon, Esq., of Uttoxeter, took place on the 7th October, 1858. The marriage ceremony was solemnized by the late Mr. Dashwood, grandfather of the bride. There was quite a demonstration of public enthusiasm on the occasion. Preceding this event by two years, the peace re joicings in Uttoxeter, foUowing upon the procla mation of peace between the Allied Powers and Eussia, were of a character to be remembered. After such an holocaust of victims to the lust of despotism and war as that which had been made in the Crimea, causing bleeding hearts and desolated homes in al most every town and village throughout several na tions of Europe, it was sufficient to cause rejoicing in any town when the message of peace was sent forth. The rejoicings in Uttoxeter took place in the usual form, resulting chiefly in good doings to the poor, on the 1st of June, 1856. This is a somewhat strange and peculiar feature amongst the Enghsh people, but it is owing, I presume, to the excessive unselfish-"], [148, "126 HISTORY OF ness and benevolence of the upper classes. The sum of \u00a375 was collected in the town, and collected, too, in the short space of two or three days, and was laid out, in providing for the festivity, 1200 lbs. of the best cuts of beef, 110 stones of flour for bread, and in the purchase of numerous barrels of ale. The distribution was made in the centre of the Market place, where arrangements had been previously made, to about 450 families by ticket. The National An them, however, was first sung, and three cheers given for the Queen. The committee of management con sisted of Messrs. E. Bagshaw, J. B. Johnson, J. Dunnicliffe, Joseph Wood, C. Turner, Joseph Clarke, and James Cook. There was also a whole sheep roasted at Tinker's lane End, and cut up for the people in that part of the town. There were besides numerous public tea meetings in the town in the afternoon. Iu Carter street there were three ; in Balance-street one ; in Smithy-lane one ; and in Silver-street one ; besides one in the Market-place, at which about 300 persons gathered.

We have only to pass along a few more years, in the interim of which nothing occurred in Uttoxeter to merit particular notice, to be brought to the most important local event of the century \u2014 one in which Uttoxeter and the neighbourhood took a particular and lively interest. Indeed the part which Uttoxeter took on the occasion makes it almost historically its own. It need scarcely be said that it is the occasion of Lord Shrewsbury and Talbot taking possession of Alton Towers and the other Shrewsbury estates. Such an outburst of good feeling and popular enthusiasm could not, however, have been owing merely to a great legal achievement in the right of property.

As, however, the history ofthe Shrews bury peerage, and an account of the struggle which terminated in favour of the Earl of Shrewsbury, seem an important preliminary to a description of the festivities at Uttoxeter, which were held to inau gurate the taking formal possession of Alton Towers and estates, the foUowing accurate summary will prove not uninteresting : \u2014 \" We learn from ' Burke's Peerage,' and other equally reliable sources of information, that the emi ment family of Talbot is one of ancient celebrity and almost unequalled historic interest. It deduces its descent from a period antecedent to the conquest ; but Richard de Talbot, who came over to England with Wilham I., may be considered its founder. From him the Shrewsbury branch in England, and the Talbots of Malahide, in Ireland, as well as the untitled but elder branch of Talbots of Bashall, York shire (now extinct in the direct male line), can trace their pedigree through nearly eight centuries by di rect descent to the present day. From the second son Hugh, Governor of the Castle of Plessy, in Essex, who afterwards assumed the monastic habit, like so many warriors of his time, six generations bring us down to Sir George Talbot, Lord Chamberlain to King Edward III., by whom he was summoned to Parliament as a baron in a.d., 1331.

In 1412 the latter illustrious warrior was appointed Lord Justice of Ireland of which he became Lord Lieutenant in a.d., 1414. He subsequently rendered good service to his country in the French wars of Henry V., but his highest renown was gained under Henry VI., upon the same field under the Regent Plantagenet Duke of Bedford. It is said that his character became far and wide so formidable to the French, owing to the constant suc cess which attended his expeditions, that mothers us.ed to hush their children into silence by pro nouncing the name of the ' Great Dogge Talbot.' He was attacked however by Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans, at Patay, in 1429, when his army was routed and he was himself taken prisoner. Being subsequently exchanged, and having gained for him self fresh lam*els, he was created Earl of Shrewsbury by King Edward IV. in 1442. Again resuming the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland, which at that day was rather a military than a civil post, and having been appointed Lord High Steward of that country, he was raised to the earldom of Wexford and Water ford in a.d. 1446, and thus became Premier Earl in the Irish as well as the Enghsh peerage. Again en gaging in foreign warfare, though in the 80th year of his age, the Earl advanced with a British force to the relief of the Castle of ChathTon, in France, be neath the walls of which he was mortaUy wounded, and died July 20th, 1453, with the reputation of having been victorious in above forty different battles.

John, the second Earl of Shrewsbury, K.G., Lord Treasurer, first of Ireland and afterwards of England, was lolled at the battle of Northampton, in a.d. 1460, while fighting under the Red Rose. He was succeeded by his eldest son, from whom the title descended regularly to the fifth earl, the most consistent statesman of Queen Mary's reign, and the only nobleman except Viscount Montague, who, on Elizabeth's accession, opposed the repeal of the act of submission of the Houses of Lords and Commons to the authority of the See of Rome, which had been carried into effect in the preceding reign. Though thus strongly attached to the religion of his fore fathers Queen Elizabeth retained him in her service, aud even admitted him to her privy council. His son, the sixth earl, is known to history as the most wealthy and powerful peer of the realm, and the guardian to whose custody the person of Mary Queen of Scots was intrusted by Elizabeth. On the death of the eighth earl in 1617 the title reverted to a dis tant cousin, Mr. George Talbot, of Grafton, as great grandson of second earl ; and from him it descended regularly to Charles, twelfth earl, who, having con formed to the Estabhshed Church, became a promi nent statesman ih the reigns of William III., Mary, Anne, and George I., under whom he held the high est offices, and by whom he was rewarded with the the Dukedom of Shrewsbury, the Marquisate of Alton, and the Knighthood of the Garter.

The thirteenth earl, being a Jesuit priest, of course did not assume the title, which ac cordingly passed to the son of his brother George, as fourteenth earl, and the last of his male descendants is now deceased. It would be alike tedious and pro fitless to trace the exact pedigree for the last century, which merely exhibits a series of nephews and cou sins inheriting in succession : we will therefore only mention that the son and the nephew of John, six teenth earl, having died during theh minority, Ber tram Arthur Talbot, in 1846, became heir presump tive to the Shrewsbury title and estates, to which he succeeded as seventeenth earl towards the close of the year 1852. His lordship was the only son of the late Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Thomas Talbot, nephew of Charles, fifteenth earl, by Julia, third daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Bart. He was born December 11th, 1832, and died without issue at Lisbon, August 10th, 1856. \" The kindred of the Earl of Shrewsbury and Tal bot to Bertram, seventeenth Earl of Shrewsbury, consists in his lineal descent from the famous Sir Gilbert Talbot, of Grafton (third son of the second earl of Shrewsbury), who was High Sheriff of Shrop shire in the time of King Richard III., but a staunch adherent of the Earl of Richmond, the right wing of whose army he commanded at the battle of Bosworth. The victorious prince showed his gratitude by be stowing upon Gilbert the honour of knighthood, with the grant of the manor of Grafton, in Worcester-"], [155, "UTTOXETER. 133 shire, and other lands. Two years afterwards Sir Gilbert had a command at the battle of Stoke, when the Earl of Lincoln and Lambert Simnel were de feated, and for this service he was made a knight banneret. The most noble member of this branch of tbe Talbot family was Charles Talbot, who was bred to the bar, attained to the summit of lus profession, and estabhshed the highest legal reputation. On the 31st of May, 1717, Mr. Talbot was appointed So licitor-General to the Prince of Wales, which office he continued to hold until 1733, when he was con stituted Lord High ChanceUor of England, sworn of the Privy Council, and elevated to the peerage De cember 5th, by the title of Baron Talbot, of Hensol, Glamorganshire. His lordship married Cecil, daugh ter and heiress of Charles Mathews, Esq., of Castley- Menich, Glamorganshire, and was at his death (February 14th, 1736-7) succeeded by his eldest son, WiUiam, who was appointed Lord-Steward of the Household, sworn of the Privy Council in 1761, and advanced to the earldom as Earl Talbot, March 10th in the same year. His lordship dying without male issue the earldom expired, the barony of Dynevor (wiiich title had been conferred upon him with spe cial remainder to his daughter and her male issue) descended as limited, and the barony of Talbot of Hensol reverted to his nephew, John Chetwynd Tal bot, who was advanced to the viscountcy and earldom July 3rd, 1784, by the title of Vicount Ingestre and Earl Talbot.

His lordship was also Lord-Lieutenant of the county of Stafford. At his death, which occurred on the 10th January, 1849, he was succeeded by his second son, the present Earl of Shrewsbury and Talbot. \" The present representative of the two great branches of this famous house has not, however, without a protracted struggle, succeeded in uniting in his own person the time-honoured titles. Within a few days of the death of the late Earl of Shrews bury au earnest was given of the serious intentions of the Ingestre branch to assert the claim of Earl Tal bot to that title, for on the 18th of August, 1856, Viscount Ingestre (on behalf of his father, who was abroad), accompanied by Mr. Hand, his solicitor, formaUy demanded at Alton Towers possession of that mansion, and the estates of the late earl, alleg ing that Earl Talbot was the legal heir. Lord In gestre was informed that the trustees under the whT ofthe deceased earl had taken possession, and he was refused admission into the house. Earl Talbot at once resolved upon appealing to the highest tribunal in the land to decide the question of the title to the premier earldom of England ; but partly in conse quence of the autumnal and winter recesses, and partly from the dissolution of Parbament in the Spring of 1857, it was the 11th of May of that year before Earl Talbot's claim was formerly brought be-"], [157, "135 UTTOXETER. fore the House of Lords. On that day the petition of his lordship to Her Majesty, praying Her Majesty that the title, dignity, and peerage, or honors, of the Earl of Shrewsbury might be declared and adjudged to belong to him, together with Her Majesty's refer ence thereof to the House, and the report of the Attorney-General thereof was presented, by com mand to the House. The petition, reference, and report were read, and were subsequently referred to the Committee of Privileges to consider and report thereupon. The opponents to his lordship's claims were three in number \u2014 first, the Duke of Norfolk, as guardian of the interests of his infant son, to whom the late earl bequeathed his magnificent property at Alton Towers ; secondly, the Princess Doria Pam phih, of Rome, as only surviving child of John, 16th earl ; and thirdly, Major Talbot, of Talbot, county of Wexford, who traced his pedigree up to WiUiam, fourth son of George, fourth earl, who was made a Knight of the Garter for his valiant conduct at the battle of Stoke, June 16th, 1487. The Committee of PrivUeges met for the first time on the 13th of the following July, when Sir Frederick Thesiger opened the case on behalf of Earl Talbot, and on the same day Mr. Sergeant Byles, who represented Lord Edward Howard, admitted that the determination of the claim to the title determined the title to the es tates. On the 27th of the same month Mr. Sergeant Byles opened the case for Lord Edward Howard, and several subsequent days were occupied with the pro duction of evidence against Earl Talbot's claim. On"], [158, "136 HISTORY OF the 14th of the following month the Attorney-Gene ral replied on behalf the Crown, and said that he proposed instituting further inquiries before asking the Committee to come to any resolution on the ques tion at issue. The Committee unanimously approved ol this course being pursued, and they then adjourned sine die. It is not until the 20th of April in the following year that we again find the Committee of Privileges engaged in this important investigation. The Attorney-General then stated the nature of the additional evidence which he intended to produce. This was cheifly of a documentary character, but its reception occupied theh lordships during two days. On the 4th of May Sir R. BetheU addressed the com mittee on behalf of Earl Talbot's opponents. Two or three days were then devoted to the production of evidence on this side, after which Mr. RoundeU Pal mer pleaded on behalf of the appeUants against the claim, and the Attorney-General, during the greater part of three days, summed up Earl Talbot's case. The Solicitor-General was then appealed to for his opinion on behalf of the Crown, and he stated his con viction to be \" that the noble claimant had made out his case, aud was entitled to the earldom of Shrews bury.\" On the 1st of June tbe final sitting of the committee was held, and their lordships proceeded to give judgment. Lord Cran worth addressed the com mittee, and after going over the leading points of the case submitted on behalf of Earl Talbot, concluded by moving, \" that their lordships report that the claimant has made out his title.\" Lord St. Leonards,"], [159, "UTTOXETER. 137 \" having come to the clear and satisfactory conclusion that the claimant's title admitted of no doubt,\" se conded the motion. Lords Wensleydale and Brough ham also expressed themselves to the same effect, after which, Lord Redesdale, chairman of the com mittee, put the question, whether the claimant had made out his title, and it was unanimously carried in the affirmative. We read in the journals of the day that the galleries ofthe house were crowded whenever their lordship met, and that the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury and Talbot were warmly congratu lated by a large number of theh friends immediately after their lordships had come to the above resolution. Those who anticipated (if any such there were), from the admission made by Mr. Sergeant Byles at the opening of the proceedings in the House of Lords with respect to the title, that the right to the estates of the deceased earl would be quietly conceded to the succesful claimant for the title, were undeceived at the earliest possible opportunity. On the 6th of December, 1858, in the Court of Common Pleas, before Mr. Chief Justice Cockburn and a special jury, the cause of the Earl of Shrewsbury, v. Hope Scott and others first came on for hearing. The action was brought to recover the mansion-house of Alton Towers and the annexed estates, and defendants, who represented the infant son of the Duke of Norfolk, defended as to all the property claimed. The Attor ney-General opened the plaintiff's case, and produced certain documentary evidence. On the same day Mr. Sergeant Shee addressed the jury for the defendants,"], [160, "138 HISTORY OF and evidence on the same side having been produced, it was agreed that a verdict should be entered for the plaintiff, subject to leave to the defendants to move to enter a verdict for them, or subject to a special case if the parties should so agree. On the 21st of January in the foUowing year, iu the Court of Com mon Pleas, Mr. Sergeant Shee obtained a rule upon all the points of law raised by Mm on behalf of his clients, and on the 31st of May the cause was again caUed on. The Attorney-General, on behalf of the noble plaintiff, appeared to show cause against the rule, and Mr. Rolt, Q.C., Mr. Manisty, Q.C., and Mr. Baddeley also addressed the Court on the same side. Mr. Sergeant Shee and Sir R. Bethell replied on be half of the defendants, and on the 8th of June the Lord Clues Justice, and his learned brethren, Mr. Justice WiUiams, Mr. Justice Willes, and Mr. Jus tice Byles, unanimously gave judgment to the effect that the rule to set aside the verdict for the plaintiff must be discharged. Undeterred by this defeat the defendants at once resolved upon carrying the case to the court of error. Little progress was, however, made during the next term, but on the 1st of Feb ruary in the present year the writ of error was brought from the Court below, and came on for hear ing, both sides being represented by counsel of the highest eminence. The proceedings having lasted three days, the Lord Chief Baron said the Court bad considered the very learned, elaborate, and ingenious arguments urged by the Attorney-General (Sir R. Bethell) on behalf of the defendants, but desired to"], [161, "139 UTTOXETER. give them still further consideration before delivering judgment. The court would not then call upon the other side to reply, but would announce their conclu sion as early as possible. Tbis was naturaUy enough considered as virtually a victory on the part of the plaintiff, and aU doubt was removed on the 18th February, when the Court gave judgment against the defendants. Notice of appeal to the House of Lords was given to the other side, but, doubtless, believing that they had no chance of obtaining a reversal of the decision of the Court of Exchequer, the defend ants from this time abandoned aU idea of carrying on the Utigation, and on the 25th of the same month the Earl of Shrewsbury and Talbot took possession of Alton Towers. \"As a record we may mention that the counsel who appeared in the causes were \u2014 for the peerage, Lord Chelmsford (then Sir F.

The townspeople and hundreds of strangers took up positions at every available place \u2014 at doors, windows, and on the causeways \u2014 along the line of route through Uttoxeter.

The piers consisted of two spruce firs, transplanted from the Alton estates, the branches of which were cut off, except at the top, the trunks being thickly surrounded by sprays of fir, yew, and other evergreens, tied on and festooned by ribbons. The arch was made in a similar way. On the right hand column was a shield charged with the ancient arms which the family bore when it came over with William the Conqueror, bendy of six argent and gules, under which was placed the word Talebote, the original way of spelling the family name.

CHURCH MATTERS, CHURCHES, ALTER-TOMBS, IN SCRIPTIONS, CHURCH REGISTER, &C The early history of Christianity in Uttoxeter lies in complete obscurity. \u2014 Doomsday Book is silent as to whether it had a church and priest at the time of the Conquest. It is nevertheless probable that Ut toxeter had a church even in Anglo-Saxon times, from the fact of the gate forming the south entrance to the church yard being still caUed, as already mentioned, \" Light Gate,\" an expression, the former part of which is corrupted from the Saxon word \" Lich,\" meaning a dead body. Lichgate, therefore, signified the entrance (amongst the Saxons) through which corpses were conveyed to their burial place. This, of course, could only have been after Chris tianity had been received amongst them, as before then they practised the heathenish mode of burial in barrows. Uttoxeter is mentioned as having a church in 1251, which is about 171 years after Doomsday Book was written, and its rector at that time was Thomas, one of the witnesses to the charter of Wil liam de Ferrars.

If the church which was super seded by the one which was built in the time of Edward III. had stood nearly as long as it, the date of its erection would not be later than the eighth century. But, of course, if there is any va lidity in this inference, it rests only upon the supposi tion that the earliest church in Uttoxeter was erected of equally durable materials, a supposition not un reasonable, from the known substantial character of Saxon church architecture. However, when prepara tions were being made for the erection of the nave of the present church, remains were discovered of some kind which fixed the existence of a church at Uttoxe ter more than a thousand years before that date.'3' (1) History of Tutbury Castle, by Sir Oswald Mosley, Bart.

The church at Uttoxeter is mentioned by Leland, who wrote in the sixteenth century, in the words, \" Uttockcester has one paroch chirch.\" In the reign of Mary, daughter of Henry VIII., the antagonism of religious parties appears to have been carried, in Uttoxeter, to a violent extreme, end ing in the death of a person of the town. The out rage occurred at the time of those sanguinary perse cutions of the adherents of the reformed faith, about 1555, when 280 victims, including Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester ; Farrar, of St. David's ; Latimer, of Worcester ; Ridley, of London ; and Cranmer, Arch bishop of Canterbury, perished at the stake, w The victim at Uttoxeter was a Thomas Flier, (2> a gentle man belonging to an ancient family of property in Uttoxeter, who was slain by a desperate Papist. The persecutions in the See of Lichfield which led to this tragedy were instigated by Dr. Bane, bishop of the diocese. Besides the compulsion of many in the see to do penance, several others had to pay with theh lives the penalty of their adherance to the re formed doctrines, one of whom was Joane Waste, who was burnt at Derby in 1555. Dr. Bane was suceessor to Richard Sampson in the See of Lich field, and his character wiU be seen by the foUowing notice: \u2014 He was a Doctor of Divinity of St. John's College, Cambridge, and was a great proficient in the Hebrew tongue, which he taught some years (1) Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia.

He returned to England in 1554, about the time of Bishop Sampson's death, and was pro moted to the See of Lichfield and Coventry the same year. His persecutions grew out of his endeavour to restore the See to what it was before the Reformation, and in trying to recover its possessions. He did not bold the bishopric long. Being appointed by Act of Parbament to give the sacrament to Queen Ebzabeth he refused to administer it to her, and was ipso facto deprived of his See. He returned to Islington, and died and was buried there in 1559. The celebrated and pious Bishop Hackett, who re stored Lichfield Cathedral after the damage it had sustained during the Civil War by the Parliamenta rians, preached in Uttoxeter Church, and held a con firmation in 1664. A brief memorandum ofthe fact is preserved on the inside of the cover of the early register of Uttoxeter Church, and is this \u2014 \" Bishop Hackett came to this town the second day of July and preacht and confirmed the third, 1664.\" This prelate was a man of great fortitude. When great penalties had been enacted to prevent it, he continued to read the Liturgy regularly at his church at St. Andrews, Holborn. In consequence of this a ser geant, with a file of men, entered the church and threatened him with instant death if he did not de sist. \" Soldier,\" said the intrepid Hackett, \" I am doing my duty ; you do yours,\" and with a more audible voice proceeded with the service.

With this sum a piece of land was purchased, caUed Monk's Field, belonging now to the vicar,'2' and the follow ing case, which unquestionably had respect to it, and in which is shown what monastic lands were freed from tbe payment of tithes, was heard in the Exche quer Chamber sometime before 1685.

Thomas Lightfoot, who was then at a venerable age, a theological controversy was rife in Uttoxeter, and threatened very much the peace of the church. It originated iu attacks upon the ordinances of the church by a Mr. Heming, who appears to have occu pied a pulpit in Uttoxeter, although it is not stated to what religious persuasion he belonged, though probably he was an Anabaptist. He had indis cretely, in the pulpit, called the sacrament as ad ministered in the church, \" a communion of dogs and devUs ; a rotten twopenny communion,\" and bragging to prove to all men \" that Judas did not receive the sacrament ;\" and telling the congregation \" that if they did believe that if Judas did receive the sacrament they might do as Judas did ; that is, go and receive, and then go and hang themselves.\" This kind of teaching appeared exceedingly bitter to some of the church people, particularly to Peter Lightfoot, physician, who drew up notes upon the points for his own and the satisfaction of a few friends ; and, although it was not intended they"], [179, "157 UTTOXETER. should, they fell in their manuscript form into the hands of Mr. Heming. The latter thereupon put his declarations into print in a pamphlet entitled \" Judas Excommunicated ; or a Vindication of the Communion of Saints,\" in which he made Mr. Light foot tbe especial object of his abuse. Whether he makes out his point as to whether Judas did not re ceive the sacrament, or whether it is not scriptural for persons indifferently to receive it in the church, it would not do any particular good here to go through his arguments to show. But some of the pas sages of abuse are so strongly expressed, particularly against Mr. Lightfoot, that it can be little wondered at if they produced a strong and bitter sensation in the Rev. Mr. Lightfoot's congregation, and indeed through the town. Some of them are thus given : \u2014 \"Mr. Lightfoot and his unholy communicants;\" \" Mr. Lightfoot and his unholy crew;\" \" his profane fellow-members ;\" \" I should superabundantly wrong him if I should not rank him with the vilest tin the kingdom ; for with them he will have communion as a member of the same external, visible body, by vir tue of which relation they are all his brethren and sisters ; so that he hath his brother drunkard, brother thief, brother murderer, brother liar, <fec. ; sister whore, sister witch, &c. ; yea, aU that have been hanged at Tyburn, and aU other gaUows in England, ever since he was born aud baptised into that fellow ship he pleads for, have been his brethren and sis ters, and this I dare say I can prove against all the devils in heU.\""], [180, "158 HISTORY OF Peter Lightfoot replied to the pamphlet of Mr Joseph Heming in a lengthy and curious tract of fifty-two pages, entitled, \" A Battle with a Wasp's Nest,\" London, 1649. He accuses his opponent chiefly of spleen, virulence, and scandal, and points out that such arguments as he had used he had cooked up from a Scotch writer \u2014 Mr. Gillespie, in '\u2022'Aaron's Rod Blossoming.\" Mr. Lightfoot goes through his antagonist's strokes of spleen as weU as his arguments, and both with logical wit and acumen proves himself an able controversalist. Mr. Heming appears to have looked upon Ut toxeter as a place of Babylonish darkness, stating that \" what he had done was for their souls who came out of Babylon, out of Egypt, the other day.\" Mr. Lightfoot looked upon this expression as a re flection upon the ministry of his father, and in a dignified appeal respecting it, he writes \u2014 \" The reader, if he were of Mr. Heming's charity, and no higher, might be induced to think that poor Uttox eter is the veriest Sodom and Gomorrah upon earth ; and that tiU he came hither, it had been led and hved in the deepest superstition and darkness that ever Babylon and Egypt did. It is not for me to speak what ministry this town hath had ever since before Mr. Heming was born. The relation I stand in to him that hath been their minister so long does stop my mouth. But let all in the countries here about \u2014 Cheshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derby shire, &c., let any in England that ever heard of old Mr. Lightfoot, minister of Uttoxeter, what he hath"], [181, "159 UTTOXETER. been, what his ministry and conversation hath been ; nay let Mr. Heming's own saints be witnesses what his pains, doctrine, life, and ministry hath been among them for above these thirty years. If they have not dissembled, the day hath been when some of them have acknowledged and taken upon them to think this towu, in a happy ministry, hath gone in equal pace and degree with most towns in England. And the case is so altered that tiU Mr. Heming came amongst them, poor Uttoxeter is said to be in darkness, and in Babylon and Egypt, and be proved a Moses and a Zorobabel to bring it out.\" Lightfoot gives the foUowing picture of the condi tion of Uttoxeter produced by Mr. Heming : \u2014 \" It seems Mr. Heming hath a singular faculty of recon ciling dead men ; and I wish he would let the evange lists alone, who are at sacred peace among themselves, and that he would reconcile poor Uttoxeter, which is torn in pieces with dissensions since he came among us. I know not whether Tenterton steeple was the cause of the stopping up of the haven two or three miles of it ; this I know, that thl Uttoxeter knew Mr. Heming, peace, amity, and charity, dwelt amongst us, in few towns more ; but now nothing but dissension, biting, and backbiting, in no town the like.\" This is, no doubt, a tolerably fair repre sentation ; and it would be a natural result of Mr. Heming's violent language. Mr. Lightfoot finishes with his opponent thus \u2014 \" A wisp or a cuckstool, the reward of scolds, had been a fitter return for your railing than patience and reason, but you see I have waited upon you with salt and spoons,\" &c."], [182, "160 HISTORY OF Mr. Heming appears also to have been the author of another work, entitled, \" Queries touching the rise and observation of Christmas Day,\" which Mr. Lightfoot accuses him of having filched out of Mr. Prynne's \" Histriomastic,\" and the \" Scripture Alma nack.\" This was answered, according to a biblio graphical work, in 1655, and the answer's were printed with Fresher's \" Christian Covenant.\" In 1814 the spire of Uttoxeter Church sustained a serious accident by Ughteuing. On the 6th of February of that year it was struck by the electric fluid, by which a stone, about half way down was forced out. It passed through the belfry, and finally penetrated the wall of the chancel, on the north side of the window. The damage which the spire sustained by the shock, made it necessary for a part of it to be taken down. When it was re-built, and the gilt cross, globe, and vane, had been placed at its apex, two incidents occurred, which, as they show the daring spirit of two females, deserve to be perpetu ated in their remembrance, as weU as on account of their amusing nature. When, as stated, the whole was finished, Mary Allport, a chamber-maid at the Red Lion Inn, ascended, stood upon the ornamental stone-work under the globe, and kissed a young man named Henry Smith, of Uttoxeter Heath, who was one of the masons, and who stood on the opposite side. Sarah Adams, a feUow servant of Mary Allport, also accomplished the intrepid feat, to win a kiss from another workman, whose name was Henry Adams. A crowd of spectators, some of whom are still living, thronged round the church at the time. Both the"], [183, ""], [184, "OLD CHUKCH, UTTOXETER, NOW TAKEN DOWN."], [185, "161 UTTOXETER. male adventurers descended safely, and subsequently became the wives of the young men. Henry Smith, with Mary Allport for his wife, settled down at Wet ley Rocks, as parish clerk, but what became of the others is not to be learned. The Old Church, the date of whose erection has been mentioned, was buUt of stone, and has been described as (when in existence) being very much out of repair on the exterior parts. (1) The church yard was then enclosed by an ancient low stoue waU. Tbe church consisted of a nave, two side aisles, and a chancel, and it was covered with lead. Where the present vestry-room is, at the south side of the pre sent church, the family of Mynors, formerly of great distinction at Uttoxeter, had a chapel where a mass priest was appointed to say mass for the family. (2) It was also their burying place. This chapel was one of those private religious foundations called a chan try, of which it is stated the family of Kynnersley also had one. There has been as much as 46a. Ir 16p. of chantry land in Uttoxeter parish ;(3) but it does not appear by whom the land was left, or whether by one or more persons. Chantries were estabhshed for the purpose of keeping up a perpetual succession of prayers for some particular family whilst living, and for the repose of their souls when dead, particularly of the founder, and (1) Pitt's Staffordshire. (2) Gentleman's Magazine, 1788. (3) Mr. P. Lightfoot's Survey. L"], [186, "162 HISTORY OF other persons specially named in the deed of founda tion. Chantries were first founded in the twelfth century, on the decline of the taste for monasteries. They were usually founded in churches already exist ng, all that was required being an altar with an area before it, and a few appendages ; and places were easily found in churches of even smaU dimensions, in which such an altar could be raised without interfering inconveniently with the more public aud general purposes for which the churches were erected. An attentive observation of the fabrics of the parish churches of England will often detect where these chantries have been, sometimes in remains of the altar which was removed perhaps at the Reformation, but more frequently in one of those ornameutal niches called piscinas, which were always placed in prox imity to the altars. Sometimes there are remains of painted glass which it is easy to see has once been the ornament of one of these private foundations, and more frequently one of those arched recesses in the wall which are caUed \" Founder's Tombs,\" and which in many instances, no doubt, were actuaUy the tombs of persons to whose memory chantries had been instituted. When the fabric of a church af forded of itself no more space for the introduction of chantries, it was usual for the founders to attach little chapels to the edifice. It is these chantry chapels, the use and occasion of which are now so generally forgotten, which occasion so much of the irregularity of design which is apparent in the parish churches of England. Erected as they generally"], [187, "163 UTTOXETER. were in the style of architecture which prevailed at the time, and not in accommodation to the style in which the original fabric was built, they are a princi pal cause of that want of congruity which is per ceived in the architecture of different parts of the parish churches. (1) The same family of Mynors had likewise a private gallery at the south side of the interior of the old church, and it was reached by stone steps from the outside. The steps are represented in the engraving of the old church almost at the junction of the nave of the church, and the chapel of that family built at the south side of the chancel. They had also some very ancient monuments in the former church. Previous to his entering upon the laborious undertaking of compiling a history of Staffordshire, the Rev. Simeon Shaw first visited most of the places in the county, both for church inscriptions, sketches of churches, and sepulchral monuments and family records. In a communication, giving an account of his success, to the \" Gentleman's Magazine\" in 1794, he mentions that the fine old spire of Uttoxeter Church afforded him a good subject for a drawing, and the inside some curious monuments of the Mynors, an ancient famUy in the parish, and of the Kynnersley's of Loxley, very ancient. All the monuments of the former family have disappeared ; two of the latter remain, but have been placed within hon rails under the stairs leading to the gallery in the north west (1) Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia, vol. vi."], [188, "164 HISTORY OF entrance. These monuments are of the altar-tomb description, a kind which was introduced about the thirteenth or fourteenth century, having on them effigies in alabaster, or incised slabs with engraved outlines of persons and arms, or engraved plates of brass, the latter of which were particularly prevalent towards the close of the fifteenth century. Both the altar-tombs of the Kynnersley's have been much muti lated. They are both of the sixteenth century, and are in alabaster. One is of Thomas Kynnersley de Loxley, whose name is legible in the letters of the period, although but httle more can be made out of the inscription to him. Ou the top is an engraved figure of the deceased, but the border to it next to the waU, which is nearly one-fifth the width of the slab, has been cut off the whole length, and the sur face of the remainder is so much cut with dates, initials, and other senseless markings, that many parts of the figure and ornamented border are effaced. The engraving has been filled with pitch or some other bituminous substance. The remaining side of this monument \u2014 for the opposite one has evidently been cut away with the border to the engraved figure at the top \u2014 contains shields of arms, and several figures of persons in bas-relief, with intervening foliated columns, supporting three canopies. There is great irregularity in the foliated sculpture, par ticidarly at the comers of the canopies. The central figure represents Christ on the cross ; tbe figure with arms upon it is most bkely a female child of the deceased ; the others are probably nuns. The latter"], [189, ""], [190, "ALTAR-TOMES, UTTOXETER CHURCH."], [191, "165 UTTOXETER. are all represented in the reticulated head-dress of the time, and the folds of theh robes appear to be very gracefully and naturally given by the artist. The other altar-tomb has a more recently sculptured effigy lying upon it, in the habit of a religieuse, and from the execution would seem to represent a lady of the same ancient house, who at a very early date, appears, from her arms, to have come into the posses sion of Loxley by marriage with the noble family of Ferrars.'1* One end of this tomb has been sawn off, including the feet of the effigy, to make it fit in the place where it is. Except the three first letters the name of Kynnersley is observable, but very httle more of the remaining inscription, if any, can been made out. There is an interesting legend respecting this ei&gy, to which rise has probably been given* by some lin gering tradition of what possibly occurred at the dispersion of the nuns at Hanbury by the Danes. It is said, and also firmly believed by many, that the effigy represents an abbess who had been lost in the woods below the town, many centuries ago, \u2014 an idea which has been embodied in \" Wood Leighton \" with the addition of such imaginary circumstances as give the story an air of truthfulness. The following is the account of the discovery of the effigy, made at the time the church was destroyed, as related to me by an eye witness.

When the tombs aud effigy so suddenly and unexpectedly appeared, the people present started back in fright, thinking the effigy, which was quite black with dust, was the corpse of some one long hidden there. Recovering themselves, they approached it, and on brushing off tbe dust, lo ! a most beautiful alabaster female figure revealed itself. She had a fine Roman nose ; a chain hung round her neck aud reached down to her abdomen ; over her breast she had a handsome stomacher ; there were four coats of arms roimd the figure, with an inscription, and tbe date of 1555. A knowledge of this discovery soon spread through the town, and numbers of persons crowded to see the interesting objects. Amongst them were the late Mrs. Hart, and an aged female of the name of Reeves. The latter, on going to the effigy, was at once excited with remembrances of former days, and giving vent to her feelings, clapped her hands and exclaimed \" Oh ! it is my lady Tansley ; I am glad to see her again.\" \"Oh 1 Mrs. Reeves,\" said Mrs. Hart, \" what do you mean ; did you know her ?

She was very much wearied by anxiety and rambhng about, and when she reached the town she left a bell full of money for the bell to be perpetually rung.\" \" And did you see the beU full of money?\" interrogated Mrs. Hart. Oh ! no ; it is so long since, but it used to be said so.\" So far was the tradition believed that till a new sexton was appointed about ten years since, three tangs for the lady abbess were invariably given before the curfew beU was rung night and morning ; and it is said that a daring individual on once willingly omitting to give the tangs was alarmed by the sudden appearance of the abbess iu person, who ascended the beU-rope and vanished out of sight. Besides these tombs the former church had a skele ton effigy, stiU preserved out of sight over the door of the west entrance. Such effigies are supposed to re present the buried corpse of a person of high ecclesi astical rank, contrasting with the gorgeous effigy of the deceased in his robes in such a manner as to con vey a wholesome lesson of the transitory nature of human greatness to persons destitute of learning, and to whose feelings a highly coloured representa tion of the fate of all flesh would appeal in a start ling manner, -1-* The nave and chancel of Uttoxeter church were re-built in the year 1828, in the style called (1) Vestiges of the Antiquities of Derbyshire."], [194, "168 HISTORY OF \" Decorated EngUsh.\" The roof is supported by two rows of six arches, betwixt the side and mid dle aisles. The cost of rebuilding this part was \u00a36061, Is. lid., of which \u00a31632 was raised by sub scription, \u00a31779 by rate, \u00a32249 by the sale of tbe pews, and \u00a3400 by the society for building churches. The pews are of oak, and the number of sittings are about 1414. Of these 422 are free. During the re-building of the church the worship of the mem bers of the Church of England in the town was con ducted in the Wesleyan Chapel, with the approbation of the bishop of the diocese. Since the enlargement of the church the spire has been touched, in 1849, by Wilham Critchlow, and the dangerous task was acomplished without au accident. More recently, in 1858, a new final stone was put on, and the vane re-gilt and replaced by men in the em employ of Mr. Evans, builder. A many people ventured to the top when the work was finished, although the spire ascends to the height of 179 feet.

In the previous century, however, four of the bells were recast, each at a different date, and most probably aU at Nottingham, and I am in pos session of particulars about them. In 1640 the great beU was recast at Nottingham and cost \u00a310, 13s. The fourth beU was cast at the same place in 1641, and, with an extra amount of metal, came to \u00a317, 4s. 9d.

Again, in 1671, the great bell was cast a second time at Nottingham, and cost \u00a319. Uttoxeter is one of the few places where the curfew bell is still rung. This custom was in existence at the Conquest, and was intended to warn people to put out their fires and hghts at eight o'clock in the evening as a precaution against fires, which were frequent and fatal, owing to many houses being built of wood. CHURCHYARD INSCRIPTIONS. Uttoxeter churchyard possesses very little either for the notice of the antiquary or of the curious. Its tombstones are modern ; many of the older ones hav ing been broken up and laid in the foundation of the present church when rebuUt. The principal epitaph is that, perhaps, on tbe tomb of Colonel Gardner\u2014 \" In memory of Colonel Gardner, late of his ma jesty's eleventh regiment of Dragoons, in which he served with honour from a cornet, and died lamented, August 1st, 1762, aged 91 years. The widow for the sincere affection for him, caused this stone to be erected.\"1' According to Mr. Samuel Bentley, who was his contemporary, \" Colonel Gardner, who at the same time that he was the polite and agreeable gentleman, (1) This tomb is falling to pieces, and should have the speedy atten tion of the descendants of the family."], [214, "186 HISTORY OF was the truly worthy veteran.

He sold out of the army a httle whUe before his death, but had some time before settled bis fanuly at Uttoxeter.\" There is a tombstone over the remains of a lady, about whom an interesting story is told, but it has no inscription upon it, further than the lady's initials. She had arrived, as is weU remembered by several aged persons, in a post-chaise at the White Hart Hotel in a dangerous state of illness, accompanied by a gentleman. Medical aid was procured, but was unavailing, and she died the next day.

It is in the new part of the churchyard. The most elaborately carved headstone of slate is of the date 1763, to James Bradbury. It is truly beautiful. On the south side of the old church, close by the old chancel wall, there was formerly a vault and tomb of the Musgrove family ; and it is said that when the last of the family was buried therein, the key of the oaken door admitting into the vault was thrown into Dove-hole. Tbis tomb was destroyed when the old church was taken down, when seventeen leaden coffins which it contained were cut in halves and sold. The buyer, however, it is said, could not rest with his purchase ; and it is affirmed that a supernatural being haunted him until he took the coffins back to the churchyard. He was glad to get rid of them, and to ease his mind, although at the loss ,of their cost. They were again buried at the east end of the church. The old tomb of the famUy of Degge was destroyed at the same time. It is weU remembered for its old appearance, standing as it did at the south side of the church. Such dese cration of human dust is enough to make one repeat the epitaph to the immortal Shakespeare \u2014 \" Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear To dig the dust enclosed here ; Blest be the man that spares these stones, And CURST be he that moves my bones."], [219, "191 UTTOXETER. THE PARISH REGISTER. The Register of Uttoxeter Church commences in the year 1596, from which date it is complete to the present time. It is consequently very voluminous, filling a large iron safe in the robing-room. From a cursory glance at its contents, it does not appear that the vicars have been in the habit of making many remarks with their entries, so that the register does not contain much to interest the public. I have looked through several of the early books, and was disappointed by not finding the christening of Sir Symon Degge, nor the burial of John Archbold, who died in 1629, aged 103 years ; nor the burial of Mr. John Scott, who was slain in Uttoxeter streets in 1644. The name of Degge, at an early date, is, how ever, of frequent occurrence. The signature of the first vicar whose name occurs in the register is that of Thomas Barns. It runs through the fir,st book, and far on in the second, beginning in 1596, and continuing over a period of twenty-one years tiU 1617. He had born to him and christened in Ut toxeter seven children \u2014 four sons, and three daugh ters. Theh names are as follows : \u2014 John, Thomas, James, WiUiam, Jones, Mary, and Anne. I do not find the burial of this vicar in the register, so that he very probably resigned. He was succeeded by the Rev.

Quakerism was introduced into Uttoxeter previous to any other form of dissent ; but what is known of its history in that town may be told in a .short space. The earhest mention occurs in the old parish records of 1662, when a warrant for the apprehen sion of a number of Quakers cost the constables the sum of one shilling. The item plainly indicates that the act of persecution proceeded from the civU au thorities in Uttoxeter, but it leaves to conjecture the cause which led to the warrant for theh ar rest being issued. It is likely, however, that as they were otherwise unexceptionable in the sight of the law, it was for the simple attempt at promulgating theh peculiar religious opinions, a proceeding which was about that time very common in many parts of the kingdom, where the magistracy were not very liberal and tolerant.

The attendants at the chapel used to comprise several respectable families, amongst whom were the ancestors of Mary Howitt, the authoress. This lady was one of the number in her earlier days.

It con tains \u2014 \" Many a mouldering heap ; Each in his narrow ceU forgotten laid.\" Congregationalism was introduced into Uttoxe ter about the year 1788. The ministers who first preached there in connection with this body were the Rev. James Boden, of Hanley, and the Rev. Mr. Whitridge, of Newcastle. The first meeting house of the Congregationalists in Uttoxeter was at the west end of Carter Street, iu a building which has since served as a hoopmaker's shop. They wor shipped at this place about four years, when they erected a more suitable buUding for the purpose at Bear HiU in 1792. The same at present forms a portion of Messrs. Lasbrey's premises. This meeting house or chapel was opened by the Rev. Jonathan Scott, minister of a chapel at Matlock Bath, which had been purchased by Lady Glenorchy for the use of the Independants and Presbyterians. The open ing of it was attended by a degree and kind of perse cution to make the occasion memorable. A number of riotous persons met in the street, near the meeting house, who, besides disturbing the congregation, made a bonfire at the piUory, in which they fixed the effigy of a minister, afterwards committing it to"], [225, "197 UTTOXETER. the flames. At night the rioters threw fire-brands at the people as they returned from the meeting, but fortunately no one was materially injured. \u25a01) The first pastor over the congregation at Bear HiU was the Rev. Mr. Cole, who was intended to be re presented by the figure which was burnt at the pil lory. Mr. Cole was succeeded in 1796 by the Rev. Stephen Chester, at which time there were but six church members and twenty others for a congrega tion. Mr. Chester was followed by the Rev. J. John son, who has since joined the Church of England, and become the travelling secretary of the Church of England Missionary Society. He, however, remained but a short time. The Rev. John Cooke, who was educated at Lancashire CoUege, entered upon his ministerial labours at the same place in 1825, and at the present period has been pastor of the Congre gationalists in Uttoxeter about thirty-eight years. The congregation increased under the ministry of Mr. Cooke, and a more suitable buUding than the meeting-house at Bear HiU became requisite, so that in 1827 the chapel in Carter Street was erected. The foundation stone of the edifice was laid by the Rev. John Cooke, who also dehvered an address during the ceremony. The chapel was finished by, and opened on, the 15th of April, 1828, the sermons being preached by the late Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool.

John Cooke is held in the highest esteem by persons of aU denominations in Uttoxeter ; his help has always been freely given when required for the promotion of the religious, educational, and social welfare of the town generaUy. Ou completing the thirty-second year of his ministry, on February 3rd, 1857, he was presented with a handsome token of the esteem in which he was held by the members of his church. The gift consisted of a shver salver, and a purse containing eighty sovereigns, the salver bearing a suitable inscription. The presentation was made, at a social meeting, by Mr. John Vernon, junior. The rev. gentleman in acknowledging the gift read the names of those members of his church who had ched during his ministry. The reading of this Ust produced considerable emotion in the assembly. Methodism was introduced into Uttoxeter during the life of its founder, the Rev. John Wesley. It is related on good authority that the house in which Mr. Godbehere resides, opposite Balance Street, was the first preaching-house in Uttoxeter of the Wes leyans, and that they worshipped in it from about 1775 to 1790. The itinerant preachers at that time, in whose district lay Uttoxeter, were the Rev. Samuel Bardsley, a man of great popularity ; the Rev. Robert Costerdine, the Rev. Robert Swan, and the Rev."], [227, "uttoxeter. 199 Joseph Taylor. The house was occupied by a famUy attached to Methodism ; ajg4 an apprentice they had to the shoe-making business was in the habit of clean ing the preachers' shoes \u2014 a not very pleasant employ ment, from the amount of dirty walking the preachers had to perform at that time \u2014 and for which he, no doubt, expected to be recompensed. One of the preachers appears to have been possessed either of a not very generous disposition, or of a purse not too full of money \u2014 a circumstance not unfrequent among Wesleyan preachers \u2014 or of a forgetful mind, for he omitted to give the lad any thing for cleaning his shoes. The omission became known to one of the other preachers, Joseph Taylor, who, in trying his wit to correct the fault of his brother preacher, perpetrated the foUowing rhyme upon paper, and stuck it upon the chimney-piece of the room they slept in : \u2014 \" Pray give Jack a penny for cleaning your leather, Your boots are so long, so dirty the weather ; You know that-- the lad has a sad nasty job, And if he clet-ms them for nothing he must be a hob.\" Joseph Taylor preached in the chapel in High Street in 1828, after he had been in the ministry forty years. At an early date the Rev. Mr. Davenport, curate of Uttoxeter church, opened his house for the public prayer-meetings of the Wesleyans; and his house was also opened for the preachers after he was pro moted to the vicarage of Radcliffe.'1' The time (1) History of Methodism in the Leek Circuit."], [228, "200 HISTORY OF when this liberal-minded clergyman countenanced the small and probably despised society of Methodists in Uttoxeter, was certainly before 1780, and very likely previous to 1775.

It is also confidently stated that be passed through Uttoxeter on another occasion, and whilst staying at tbe White Hart and Old Star in the market-place for a change of post horses, he was met by the members of the society in the town. At another time, when there was a dis pute amongst them, he addressed them a letter which had the desired effect of producing a reconciliation. It appears that when the Wesleyans discontinued preaching at the house in the Sheep Market, a house was open for their reception on Uttoxeter Heath, which was shortly after exchanged for the buUding in Carter Street, previously used by the Indepen dents. This they occupied ;tiU the close of the cen tury. The Rev. John Hampson, a preacher of some eminence, once preached in this meeting-house, and met with no little annoyance from a number of young men who had met \"to persecute and disturb the as sembly.

He took him by a leg and an arm and flung him into a cesspool, or some similar place, in the back-yard \u2014 an unpleasant aud unexpected result to his annoyance of the congregation. The preacher resumed his duties, and no one again attempted to molest him. A son of Mr. Hampson wrote a hfe of Mr. Wesley in three volumes. At the beginning of the present century Methodism in Uttoxeter had almost become extinct ; preaching was discontinued, and only one or two persons re mained clinging to the Wesleyan form of worship. A person of the name of Cartwright, and a famUy named Seckerson \u2014 whose ancestors existed in Ut toxeter two centuries before \u2014 were all the Methodists that remained in the town, and these went weekly to Doveridge chapel, which was then attended by tbe family of the late Michael Thomas Saddler, M.P. for Leeds. About 1805 a house was opened at the wharf, and was thronged by persons ; but it appears they were not permitted to worship there without 'molestation. There were to be found per sons who annoyed them by blowing the fumes of assaf\u0153tida tlrrough the key-hole in the door ; and on one occasion when the people were assembled, a num ber of the rabble forced open the door and pushed a donkey into the house.

The preachers at the present time are the Rev. R. Brown, and the Rev. J. F. Broughton. In the rear of the chapel is a spacious school-room. The Primitive Methodists have a chapel in Car ter Street, which was erected in 1842. Previous to this they had a meeting-house at the top of the Hockley.

This learned and distinguished mathematician and philosopher was born at Uttoxeter on the 21st De cember, 1542, and according to Camden was a de scended, through six generations, of Henry AUen of Bucknall. He was admitted a scholar of Trinity CoUege, Oxford, in 1561, became a fellow in 1565, and took his Master's Degree in 1567. He pur sued his studies in this coUege for three years after wards, but in consequence of his disinclination to enter into holy orders, as required by the statutes, he resigned his feUowship, and went to Gloucester Hall (now Worcester CoUege) in the year 1570. Here he pursued the study of mathematics with great attention and success, and in consequence of his attainments, acquired a high reputation for his supe rior knowledge in his favourite branch of learning, Mr. AUen was now patronized by a nobleman much devoted to mathematical science, Henry, Earl of Northumberland, who invited lum to his house,"], [233, ""], [234, "THOMAS ALLEYN."], [235, "205 UTTOXETER. and introduced him to those celebrated mathemati cians, Thomas Harrison, John Dees, Walter Warner, and Nathaniel Thorperly. Mr. AUen enjoyed in their society the greatest gratification, by the discus sion of topics most congenial to his habit of thinking ; and his friends were no less pleased and instructed in their intercourse with a young philosopher whose demonstrations of science were so complete and conclusive. Amongst other distinguished persons who respected the talents of Mr. Allen, Robert, Earl of Leicester, was emulous to patronise him, and offered to confer a bishopric upon him. He, however, declined the clerical preferment, and continued in that retirement which was so agreeable to his unostentatious charac ter, and his simple and temperate habits of life. Devoted to the studious pursuits of science, Mr. Allen continued in the University, and availing himself of the advantages of his situation, he collected many valuable manuscripts relating to antiquities, history, philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy, a catalogue of which collection is preserved in the Ashmolean Museum. Mr. AUen published in Latin the second and third books of Ptolemy, concerning the judgment of the stars, with an exposition. He also wrote notes on many of Lilly's books, and some of the works of Bates, entitled \" De Scripturibus Mag Britannia,\" and was doubtless misled by the belief in judicial astrology so prevalent in that age. His skill as a mathematician induced the vulgar to suspect him of practising the art of magic ; and the author of a book entitled \" Leicester's Commonwealth,\" accused him"], [236, "206 HISTORY OF of exercising his necromanic art to promote the Earl of Leicester's ambitious schemes, and effect a match between that nobleman and Queen Elizabeth. This absurd assertion doubtless originated in the weU known confidence which existed between Mr. Allen and his patron, between whom a constant correspon dence was kept up, insomuch that nothing important respecting the state was transacted without the cog nizance of the phUosopher, who, in return, informed the earl of what passed in the university. From the uniformity of a coUegian's life few inter esting incidents are to be expected ; and Mr. Allen was content with the esteem of a few select friends, in preference to emolument and fame. He was highly respected by several celebrated contempora ries, particularly Mr. Camden, Sir Thomas Bodley, Sir Henry Saville,'1' Sir Robert Cotton, Sir Henry Spelman, and Mr. Sheldon. Mr. Allen died at Gloucester HaU, September 30th, 1632, in the 90th year of his age, and was interred with great solemnity.

In fact, it has long been the practise of the learned to compli ment each other hyperbolically ; and in the ardour of their admiration and wish to shine as encomiasts they over-praise the abUities aud attainments of men of real worth. The foUowing sketch of Mr. Allen is from a manu script in the library of Trinity College, Oxford : \u2014 \" He studied pohte literature with great apphcation ; he was strictly tenacious of academical discipline ; always highly esteemed, both by foreigners and by all of the highest stations in the Church of England and the University of Oxford.\" Yet, with aU this boasted knowledge, it is to be regretted by the world that Mr. AUen was so secret a lover of the muses ; for we have not a single scrap to Ulustrate his taste for pohte literature, and very few articles indeed from his pen respecting even his own favourite study of mathematics.

The hand-writing of Dr. Symon Degge, his son, in the copy of Dr. Plott's \" Natural History of Stafford shire,\" at Cambridge, unmistakeably fixes Uttoxeter as his birthplace. He says on the margin of page 313, that Sir Symon Degge died in tbe 92nd year of his age, and that he was bom at Uttoxeter, a town remarkable for the great age of its inhabitants. Owing to bis eminent legal attainments, King Charles II. appointed Sir Symon judge of West Wales, a position which he held for a period of fourteen years ; after resigning this post he be came counsel in the war of Wales during the space of twelve years, an appointment to which he was also preferred by the same king.

Her poems are very favourably reviewed in the \" Gentleman's Maga zine \" of 1829, in connection with which an interest ing sketch of her hfe, chequered by many difficulties, is given. Mr. Bentley was very much respected, and was on terms of intimacy with Lord Gardner, who invari ably called upon him, when professional duties al lowed him to visit his native place. On one of these occasions, when Mr. Bentley was almost totally bhnd, Lord Gardner went the back way to his house, which he entered. On Mr. Bentley hearing Lord Gardner's voice he at once recognized it, and exclaimed, \" Lord Gardner, I presume.\" Lord Gardner's reply showed how httle he esteemed mere titles of dignity for emi nent services, without something more substantial.

The distinguished Admiral, Lord Gardner, was born at Uttoxeter on the 12th of April, 1742, at the house in High Street caUed the Uttoxeter House, now occupied by Dr. Taylor.'1' He was the eighth son of Lieutenant-Colonel Gardner, of the 11th regiment of dragoons. Hav ing at an early period shown a strong bias towards (1) Dr. Taylor has most benevolently for many years given medica advice gratuitously twice a-week, by which many have been greatly benefited."], [250, "218 HISTORY OF the naval service, he was rated, when fourteen years old, as a mid-shipman on board the \" Medway,\" of sixty guns, under the immediate order of Captain Sir Peter Denis, an officer of distinguished merit. In this vessel Mr. Gardner remained for two years, during which time he was present in an action, in which the \" Due D' Aquitaine,\" a French ship of the line, was taken. From the \" Medway\" he afterwards accompanied his captain, first on board the \" Namur,\" and afterwards into the \" Dorsetshire.\" In the for mer he served under Admiral Hawke during the ex pedition against Rochfort ; and while on board the latter, was present at the capture of \" A Raisonable,\" on which occasion Captain Denis put in practice the plan adopted by the new school, of not firing a single ball untU with a few yards of the enemies' ship. He likewise bore a share in the general engagement which took place off BeUeiste, in 1769, between the British and French fleets, commanded by Sir Edward Hawke and Marshal de Covflaus. Mr. Gardner, having at this time been five years in constant service, was, at the customary examinations, appointed Lieutenant on board the \" Bellona.\" In this station he distin guished himself at the capture of the \" Courageuse,\" whereupon he was raised to the rank of Master aud Commander, and appointed to the \" Raven,\" of six teen guns. After the lapse of four years he was made First in the \" Preston,\" of fifty guns, which had been fitted out as the flag-ship of Rear-Admiral Parry, whom he accompanied to Port Royal, in Jamaica. During the whole time of his being jsta-"], [251, "UTTOXETER. 219 tioned there Great Britain was at peace with all the nations of Europe ; so that the only circumstance which occurred requiring notice in this sketch, was his marriage with Susannah Hyde, daughter of Fraucis Oale, Esq., a West India planter. This lady having brought him a numerous family, and being ;himself ambitious to rise in the service, he made every effort to obtain an appointment as 60on as the American contest began. Accordingly he was nominated to the command of the \" Maidstone \" fri gate, in which he sailed from the West Indies early in 1778, and in the course of that year was so fortu nate as to make a rich capture on the coast of America. On the 4th of November he fell in with the \" Lion,\" a French man-of-war, having on board fifteen hogsheads of tobacco ; and after a severe ac tion compeUed her to surrender. With this prize he sailed for Antigua, and was soon after Jpromoted by Admiral Byron to the command of the \" Sultan,\" of seventy-four guns. In the drawn battle which was fought some time subsequently with the French fleet under Count de Estaing, off the Island of Gre nada, Captain Gardner led the van, and greatly dis tinguished himself. His ship, however, suffered so much, that he was ordered to Jamaica, from whence he shortly afterwards sailed for England, when the \" Sultan\" was discharged. He did not, however, remain long out of commission, having been ap pointed to the \" Duke\" in the course of a few months, with which ship he saUed to join the fleet in the West Indies, when under the orders of Sir George"], [252, "220 HISTORY OF Rodney. He was fortunate enough to arrive in time to participate in the glorious victory of the 12th of April, 1782. On that memorable day his ship was the first to break through the enemies' line of battle, according to tbe new plan of attack then for the first time put in practice. At one period of this action, the \" Duke,\" in conjunction with the \" Formidable\" and \" Namur,\" had to sustain the force of eleven of the enemy's ships. Soon after this triumph the American war terminated, and peace continued for several years to shed her benignant influence over the several nations of Europe. For some time he acted as commander on the Jamaica station ; and in 1790 was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty, when he likewise obtained a seat in Parliament. In the year 1793, having been raised to the rank of Rear- Admiral of the Blue, he hoisted his flag on board the \" Queen,\" of ninty-eight guns, in which he saUed as Commander-in-Chief, to the Leonard Islands. Soon after this event, finding the disputes between the Repubhcans and Royalists in the colony of Mar tinico to run very high, and being earnestly pressed by the latter to effect a descent on the island, Major- General Prince landed with 3000 men, but that offi cer judged it expedient to reembark almost imme diately, being satisfied that the Republican party was too strong to afford just hopes of success in the Royalist cause. Admiral Gardner now returned to England, and in the following year bore a part in the action of June 1st, under the gallant Earl Howe. On this occasion his conduct was conspicuous in the"], [253, "221 UTTOXETER. extreme, his ship having suffered more than any other in the fleet, with the exception of the \" Bruns wick.\" In consequence he'was not only particularly thanked by the Commander-in-Chief, but was ap pointed Major-General of Marine, and created a Baronet of Great Britain. On the 22nd of June, 1795, Sir Allen Gardner was present at the action off the Port L'Orient, when the French fleet only saved itself from total destruction by timely flight. Two years after this event, when a dangerous mutiny had broken out at Portsmouth, he manifested a de gree of firmness and resolution during that trying period worthy of his high character as a British naval officer. From tbis time he continued to serve in the Channel Fleet, tiU the close of the year 1799, when he was sent with sixteen saU of the line to reinforce the fleet off Cadiz, and in the Mediterranean. Per ceiving, however, that httle danger was to be appre hended j;in these quarters, he returned with nine sail of the line, accompanied by the envoy from Lisbon. In 1800 he served in the Channel Fleet, but soon afterwards was, being previously raised to tbe dignity of an Irish peer, appointed to succeed Admiral Kings mUl, the naval commander in Ireland. This com mand he continued to hold till the year 1807, when he hoisted his flag as Admiral of the Channel Fleet, which ill health, however, soon obhged him to re linquish. He died in 1810, and was buried in the Abbey Church of Bath, with the grandeur and so lemnity due to his rank and merit."], [254, "222 HISTORY OF Lord Gardner's political career was not distin guished by any circumstance of great moment. He sat in three successive parliaments. His first elec tion took place in 1790, when he was returned for Plymouth. In 1796 he was coUeague to Mr. Fox in the representation of Westminster. On this occasion he was opposed by Mr. John Home Tooke, whose wit, satire, and eloquence, were more alarming to the Admiral than a shower of cannon balls from the enemy's fleet. Notwithstanding, he once more offered himself for the same city, and was successful. At this time Mr. Fox, in addressing the electors, said, \" A noble Admiral has been proposed to you. I cer tainly cannot boast of agreeing with him in pohtical opinions ; but whom could the electors pitch upon more worthy of their choice than the noble Lord \u2014 in his private character universally respected, and a man who has served his country with a zeal, a gallantry, a spirit, and a splendour, that will reflect upon him immortal honour.\" MARY HOWITT. In a copy of \" My own story,\" which belonged to the late Thomas Hart, Esq., banker, of Uttoxeter, is this pleasing note in that gentleman's handwriting, occa sioned by early remembrances called up by a perusal of that interesting little book \u2014 \" I remember this Mary Howitt well, and think I see her now bringing home large bunches of flowers, which she was fond of gathering in the fields.\" Uttoxeter may be truly"], [255, "223 UTTOXETER. proud that it has been the birth-place of this lady, who ranks amongst the most distinguished and pleas ing writers of the day. She was bprn early in the present century. Both her parents were descended from ancestors of honourable reputation. Her father was Samuel Botham, Esq. , surveyor, and her mother was of the family of Wood, the Irish patentee, about whose halfpence, minted under a contract of the Go vernment of George II. , Dean Swift raised such a disturbance with his \" Draper's Letters,\" preventing the^issue of the coinage, and saddling Mr. Wood with a loss of \u00a3600,000. Sir Robert Walpole resisted aU recompense for his loss, although Sh Isaac Newton, who was appointed to assay the coinage, pronounced it better than the contract required, and Mr. Wood, of course, justly entitled to remuneration. His son, Mr. Charles Wood, the grandfather of Mrs. Howitt, and who became assay master at Jamaica, was the first to introduce platina into Europe. Many of her ancestors, who were attached to the Society of Friends, have suffered for the assertion of their rights in religious matters. Mrs. Howitt, who was brought up in the religious tenets of the Quakers, pursued her early studies under her father's roof, in association with her elder sister (now Mrs. Harrison), where they made proficiency in Latin, French, and chemistry. At this period she also made stealthy draughts at those sources of litera ture which were looked upon as vain, and strictly forbidden by the rules of the religious society to which she belonged ; and to satisfy the taste thus acquired,"], [256, "224 HISTORY OF such books as were in the neighbourhood were laid under contribution. She was at this early period, too, an observer of nature, and an admirer of its varied beauties. Nor less so was her sister. How beautifully her love for flowers is spoken of by Mr. Hart. She had also a love for poetry, which led her to make available for metrical illustration such subjects as she deemed suitable ; and these, which were handed about in manuscript, feU into the hands of Mr. Howitt, a young poet of kindred mind, and of the same persuasion in religion. This circum stance led to their early marriage, and in 1823 their first and joint production appeared, under the title of \" The Forest Minstrel,\" and was warmly welcomed by the public. She continued to devote herself to literature, and in 1827 \" The Desolation of Eyam,\" a touching subject, pathetically treated, was pub lished, with a selection of lyrics, also the joint pro duction of Mr. and Mrs. Howitt. Mrs. Howitt next published \" The Seven Temptations,\" in which she eschewed outward objects, and painted the struggles of the inner being. The three-volume novel was at this time in the ascendant, and she resolved in her succeeding hterary effort to meet the taste of the day, and gave to the reading public, \" Wood Leighton,\" in three volumes, which met with considerable suc cess, and has several times being re-issued in a cheap form. This book has been much read in Uttoxeter, and there is a general impression that it is intended throughout as a description of persons, events, and scenes, belonging to the neighbourhood of her birth,"], [257, "225 UTTOXETER. and altogether as real and distinct as any to be found in history. With respect to \" Wood Leighton,\" and other ficticious works this lady has written, she kindly writes, in a letter respecting them, as follows : \u2014 \" Al though Uttoxeter has been the groundwork of a good deal I have written, yet I have allowed myself the privilege of a writer of fiction, and not felt the ne cessity of adhering more closely to the details of facts than first suited my purpose. I have filled up any gap or hiatus according to my own fancy, and as best perfected my picture ; so when strict accuracy is re quisite I am not in such works wholly to be depended upon.\" This passage wUl enable many of the rea ders of \" Wood Leighton\" to surmount some of their misapprehensions of many of the characters and lo calities described in the work. In tbe year 1837 Mr. and Mrs. Howitt made a tour in the Scottish Highlands, where they gleaned information for subsequent hterary use. During their journey they travelled over the space of more than five hundred miles. They afterwards made Esher, in Surrey, their place of abode, it being sur rounded by scenery of a varied and most beautiful description. About this period Mrs. Howitt wrote the series of books for the people and their children, of which \" My Own- Story\" is one. They consist of thirteen distinct books, and it is not saying too much, that they possess a charm which can be found in no other works of a similar kind. After their comple tion Mr. and Mrs. Howitt went to Germany for the education of their children, and resided at Heidel- p"], [258, "226 HISTORY OF burg for three years. Form thence they visited every principal part of the German States, and made them selves acquainted with the literature and social life of the people. The works of Miss Bremer having fallen into the hands of Mrs. Howitt about this time, she applied herself successfully to the acquisition of the Swedish language, to enable her to present them to Eng lish readers. The work of translation was admirably executed, and by this means the works of Miss Bre mer have justly obtained a popularity co-extensive with the English language. She was equally fortu nate with the Danish language, from which she has tran.slated the beautiful story of the \" Improvisatore\" of Hans Christian Anderson, and other fictions of less importance. In 1847 Mrs. Howitt published a handsome edi tion of her ballads, and other poems, to which was prefixed an exceUent likeness of the author. At a later period Mrs. Howitt assisted her husband in the compilation of a \" History of the Literature of the North of Europe,\" in two volumes, including speci mens in prose and verse, the latter metrically ar ranged. She also edited, for three years, the \" Draw ing-room Scrap-book,\" and illustrated by biographical vignettes, a series of portraits of the Queens of Eng land. Besides having been an extensive contributor to periodical hterature for upwards of twenty years, she has written \" The Heir of West Wayland,\" \" The Children's Year,\" \" History of America,\" \" Calendar of the Seasons,\" and other books, besides"], [259, ""], [260, "BIRTH-PLACE OF MAEY HOWITT, UTTOXETER."], [261, "227 UTTOXETER. having recently translated Miss Bremer's \" Letters on the Holy Land,\" and assisted her husband in a beautiful work on the \" Abbeys and Castles of Eng land,\" in which the language possesses aU the fresh ness of these gifted writers.'1' A daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Howitt, Miss Anna Mary Howitt, (now Mrs. Alaric Watts,) has won success both as an author and artist. The \" Art Student at Munich\" is from the pen of this lady. She has embodied her conceptions in painting in a production entitled, \" Margaret returning from the Fountain,\" derived from this portion of Goethe's \" Faust,\" \u2014 \" Margaret having heard the harsh judg ment of her companions at the city fountain, returns home tortured by serf-accusation.\" A son of Mr. and Mrs. Howitt is Mr. Alfred William Howitt, a ten years' resident in Austraha, who was the head of the relief party who discovered Burke and WiUs, the Australian explorers, and, I believe, is the author of \"A Boy's Adventures in Australia.\" Another enterprising son has lately met with his death on Lakd Brunner, in the western district of Canterbury, New Zealand, by the upsetting of a canoe. The house in which Mrs. Howitt was born, of which an engraving is here given, is pleasantly situated in Balance Street, with a south-westerly aspect in front. A flower garden slopes from the house almost to a brook, which runs beneath in the valley.

A row of fir trees, which were planted by Mr. Botham towards the bottom of tbe garden, were much thought of, but most of them have been cut down, as well as some interesting clumps of trees in the distance, in view of the bouse, and spoken of in \" My Own Story.\" Many, if not all, of tbe filbert trees remain. The house towards the street is man tled with ivy, and has a yard, /which is separated therefrom by iron palisades. EDWARD RUDYERD. This individual was minister of Uttoxeter. In 1615 he published \" The thunderbolt of God's wrath against the hard-hearted and stiff-necked sinners.' He was descended from an ancient Saxon family who settled at Rudyerd, temp., Canute the Dane, 1030. Of the same family was Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, a noted wit, poet and statesman of Charles I. reign ; the friend of Lord Pembroke, Pym, and Hampden, and upon whom Ben Jonson wrote several epigrams. John Rudyerd, the architect of the second Eddystone lighthouse in 1706, was also of that family.'1' CAPTAIN DANIEL ASTLE. This person claims a brief notice as the author of a little local book entitled \" A Prospect from Barrow Hill,\" dated Uttoxeter, June 25th, 1777, and printed by Pearson and Robinson, Birmingham. He was (1) Reliquary, 1861."], [263, "229 UTTOXETER. educated at Barton-under-Needwood, and was the son of Mr. Daniel Astle, keeper of Byrkley Lodge, and brother to the learned antiquary, Thomas Astle, Esq., F.R.S., F.S.A., &c, &c. He served in the army under General Howe, and was at the attack of the American forces at Bunker's HiU. He subse quently became clergyman at BromshaU church for a great number of years. He is said to have been a friend of Dr. Johnson, and to have made the pen and ink sketch represented in the engraving on page 119. The figure of Astle is recognized as a faithful outline by those who knew him. He closes his book with these words, \" With the woman one loves, with the friend of one's heart, and a good study of books, one might pass whole ages here and think it a day.\" He died in 1826, aged 83 years, and was buried at Uttoxeter."], [264, "230 HISTORY OF THE EXTENT OF UTTOXETER; ITS PRIMITIVE APPEARANCE; NOTED BUILDINGS OF ANTIQUITY; COURT HOUSE AND COURT LEET ; FIRES WHICH HAVE HAPPENED; POPULATION OF UTTOXETER; INSTANCES OF LONGEVITY, Ac.

Leaving out the Heath and Balance Hill, the map wiU warrant, I think, the opinion, that there were more houses in Uttoxeter at that period than there are now. On the Heath there were but ten cottages, and they were probably by the side of the turnpike road, on the left hand in going out of the town, the rest being an open com mon, or heath, of about sixty-four acres and thirty five perches. The Heath is now the size of a large viUage. On Balance Hill there were eight cottages, but now there are twice that number.'1' Through the (1) Lightfoot's Survey of Uttoxeter."], [265, "UTTOXETER. 231 middle of the churchyard there was a row of houses, and one at the church gate was called a cell. As before intimated, Uttoxeter is remembered to have had a very quaint and ancient appearance. Almost within memory the houses were all but en tirely of the frame-timber class, with the spaces filled in with watlings of wood, covered with tempered clay, with an outer coating of plaster. The chim neys were almost entirely constructed in a similar manner. In most instances the gable ends came to the street ; and it will be perceived by the plan, as is also remembered, that to many of the houses were porches. The only one remaining till recently was that at the White Bear Inn, in Carter Street, which is here engraved as a cuiiosity. It is also curious that at the west end of Carter Street several of these houses, as wiU be observed by Mr. Light foot's plan, projected to about the middle of the street. It is not less curious, that when the roof of one of these old houses almost opposite the White Hart, in Carter Street, was taken away, it was found to have been originally thatched with ling. Modern improvements, however, have swept away many of these primitive residences, and whatever of sentiment there may be in clinging to old associa tions, it must be confessed that there is more of com fort and health to be enjoyed in those by which they are superseded. A few of the old patches remain, the most complete of which is in Carter Street, con sisting of several houses, which, from their appear ance, must be many hundred years old.

THE WHITE BEAR INN. Happily the sites of several interesting places ot antiquity in Uttoxeter can yet be pointed out, and one or two still remain almost intact. The entire ancient chief or manor house has continued intact, except that its frame-work is covered with a coating of what is called \" slap-dash.\" For many years it has has been known as the schoolhouse of Miss Sutton, in"], [267, "233 UTTOXETER. Carter Street, near the Independent chapel, and is at present occupied by Mr. Mills. It has two gables to the street, and one towards the west. The building of the ancient court house is also in existence, in the Market Place ; but it has been converted into dwel ling-houses and shops, which are occupied by Mr. Par ker and Mr. Norris. It is traditionally said to have been the buUding where tbe soldiers, who had the defence of Uttoxeter during the civil wars, had their rendeszvous and depot of ammunition and arms. The Court Leet of Uttoxeter was held here ; and it ap pears that the common oven \u2014 the one in which the inhabitants of the town by feudal prescription in the ancient charters of the lords of the manor baked their bread \u2014 was in connection with the manor court, and in, or perhaps rather previous to, 1658, was held by oue Laurence Bradshaw, according to the terms ex pressed in the foUowing particulars : \u2014 \" The furnace, or common bakehouse, with the highest room over it (the middle room being reserved to the use of the town for a Common HaU), and the bakehouse con nected to a dwelling-house, with shop aud cellar, at the rent of xl. ij. yearly.\"'1' This cellar is probably the underground kitchen of Mr. Mace. The Court Leet is of very great antiquity, and has the same meaning as \" View of Frankpledge,\" which was granted by Earl Ferrers to Uttoxeter in the thirteenth century, although it is probable this was only a confirmation of a right then already existing. (1) Lightfoot's Survey of Uttoxeter."], [268, "234 HISTORY OF The word '' leet\" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon lathian, or gelathian, to assemble, both lath and leet indicating, under different modifications, a district in which the free male resiants (residents), or indwel lers, assembled at stated times, as well for prepara tion for mihtary defence, as for purposes of police and criminal jurisdiction.'1' The borrow-holders, or borhes-alder, or seniors of the pledges, who were re sponsible for the good conduct of each of their co pledges, who appear to have had authority analagous to that still exercised by the constable, an officer elected by the resiants, for the preservation of the peace, are thus mentioned in Lightfoot's Survey, \" The Third-borrow Fine or Frith-sUver paid at the leet by two borough-holders chosen by the jury, being yearly xvijs.\" Behind the Common HaU and Town Oven there was a building in which the maltmill for the town then was ; and there are some outer places there at this time, which, from their appearance, may have been portions of malthouses. There are also two small mill gritstones in existence in the yard of Mr. French, on the High Wood, which are said to have belonged to a miU of some kind situated at the same place. Another interesting place was \" Mr. Wood's HaU,\" which was \" swept for King Charles when at Uttoxe ter in 1642,\" not any portion of which, however, is in existence. Its site is at the highest part of the (1) Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia."], [269, "235 UTTOXETER. field at Bull's Bank, opposite the New Grammar School. The interest attaching to it is increased by the fact of its having been the ancient residence in Uttoxeter of the Mynors family, and it is, no doubt, the same as that referred to by Erdeswick in his Sur vey of Staffordshire, in these words, \" In Utcester is a house of the Mynor's ; very ancient gentlemen are they,\" and not HoUingbury Hall, as has been sup posed. It was sold early in the seventeenth century, as will be more particularly noticed hereafter, to Mr. James Wood, son of a citizen and salter of London, one of the last of whom in Uttoxeter was a solicitor. It was a half-timbered buUding of very great an tiquity, and of considerable dimensions, and contained altogether about forty rooms, some very lofty and spacious, one of which was used as a gaUery. There were two gables towards the street ; but these had a retiring centre betwixt them, with, it is said, an em battled parapet ; and there was a coach-yard in front. It was several stories high, and the roofs had nume rous dormer windows along theh sides, the roof of the central part being flat. There were secret places at a chimney back, and elsewhere ; and it is tradi tionally stated that King Charles was ou one occasion secreted in one of these places, though this behef is perhaps more likely to refer to the time when it was swept for him. The buUding has very many strange ghost stories associated with it ; but of curious things of this kind it will be sufficient to preserve some amatory hnes remembered to have been inscribed upon one of the oki green glass windows \u2014"], [270, "236 HISTORY OF I bleeding at your feet do lie, Unless you yield ; or else I die, Harmless Anne Wood. Soul and body murdered here, I shall never rest till I see my dear.\" A notion of the most improbable circumstance is also in existence, and widely credited, that a secret subterranean passage connected this ancient residence with Tutbury Castle. There has been an hermitage at a former period near Dove Bridge, rather a conspicuous vicinity for those who passed their days \" remote from man,\" and so found their business in prayer and their plea sure in praise ; and there has also been a moated resi dence on Uttoxeter Heath, a little distance below the Three Tuns Inn, where the new road to Beamhurst has gone across a portion of the site ; but the house has been destroyed a very long time : nothing but the moat was observable even two hundred years back. The land on which it stood formerly belonged to the Mynors, and was called the Little Park, or \" Mott Close,\" so that it is not improbable that the ancient house at some time belonged to a branch of that family.'1' Considering the character of the buildings in Ut toxeter at a past period, it is not surprising that at different times fires of an alarming description have happened to them ; but it is far more surprising for the same reason, that more have not taken place. (1) Lightfoot's MSS, Survey of Uttoxeter."], [271, "237 UTTOXETER. One of the most destructive fires took place in the sixteenth century, aud Erdeswick mentions it in his \" Survey,\" saying, \" That it (Uttoxeter) was reasonably weU buUt, but pity it hath suffered of late great losses by fire.\" In the Church Register is also preserved an interesting note relating, no doubt, to the same fire \u2014 \" The towne was burnte the xxist of Auguste ano domni, 1596. The vicarage house was burnte then, and almost aU his goods, to his greate hurte years paste.\" The name of the minister was, apparently, WUliam Barns, for that name as minister of the parish, with the names of his chU dren, appear on the same cover of the register as the entry about the fire. The register is of vellum or parchment, and is very much burnt, an injury it no doubt sustained at the time. Another serious fire broke out in 1672, in the rear of a Mr. Cludd's house,'1' and burnt most of the lower part of the town. According to Lightfoot's MS. Survey, which was taken previously, Mr. Cludd resided in a house next to the Black Swan Inn, which bears, by the internal wood- work, I am told, evidence of fire, so that it spread from this publichouse to the lower corner of the Sheep Market, and along Balance Street, which agrees with the account of its consum ing the \" lower part of the town.\" Whether from wilfulness or carelessness as to the origin ofthe fire, or from some dispute amongst the owners of the lost property, does not transpire, but Sir Edward Bagot (1) Parochial Accounts."], [272, "238 HISTORY OF and the constables, and Mr. Kynnersley came to Uttoxeter about it, and a Mr. Edge and a Mr. Chamberlyn were sent to Stafford to the judge with a petition respecting the unfortunate occurrence. Since then several fires have hapjiened. One about forty years ago broke out in Tinker's Lane, and de stroyed two houses. In the old houses which stood opposite the White Hart, when pulled down in 1860, it was found that some of the beams were burnt half through ; and such was also found to be the case at the White Bear, in Carter Street, when repairs were being effected in the year following. The number of pubhchouses in Uttoxeter at the period \u2014 two hundred years ago \u2014 to which reference has been more particularly made, was few, compari tively to those in existence at this day. There was the \" Crown\" at the north side of the Market Place, belonging to the heirs of Townsend, and in the tenure of Henry Morton ; the \" Old Crown\" at the corner of the Sheep Market, which consisted of two burgages and a half at ijs. vid., and being now Mr. Barns ord's7 house, which belonged to Mrs. Sneyd, and previously to an Archbold, gent, (the same whose memorial is in the church), and in the occupation of John Star tin; the \" Old Swan,\" where Mr. Shipley's premises are, in the Market Place ; the \" Cock,\" which was in exstence till it was absorbed into the brewery premi ses, after a duration of more than two hunched years, as appears from documentary evidence, and it be longed to, and was held by, Thomas Gilbert ; the \" Greyhound,\" at \" Bell's Corner,\" which has also"], [273, "239 UTTOXETER. been remembered to have been in existence, belonged to Thomas Kynnersly, Esq., and was in the tenure of widow Goodwin ; and the \" White Hart,\" which was at the corner of Carter Street and the Market Place.

Exactly two hundred years ago, 622, if not five more, firehearths were made,'1' or a tax under that name was levied, upon that number of houses or families in Uttoxeter. Now the population of Ireland'2' has been attempted to be ascertained by multiplying the number of houses by 5J. The same rule may just as appropriately be applied for arriving at the extent of population in Uttoxeter at the period mentioned, especially as it is adopted by government for such purposes, and found to give as correct results as can by any other means, short of actually taking the census of each house, be obtained. Multiplying, then, 627, the number of fire-hearths in Uttoxeter levied in 1662, by 5 -J, we find as the total of inhabitants in Uttoxeter at that time, about 3,348 persons of all classes, and this gives an excess over the population in 1801, when it was 2,779 only, of 669 persons. That this is as correct a mode of obtaining the sum of the population, indiscriminately, as can be adopted, viz., by multiplying a given number of houses or families by 5J, is provable by applying it to the cen sus returns for Uttoxeter in 1811, the number of houses being 605, and [the population 3,155. It will be seen to give an excess over the exact population of 272, whilst multiplying by five would give a de ficiency of 130. But if, in reality \u2014 which is proba bly not the case, as an aUowance must be made for (1) Parochial Accounts. (2) Illustrated London News,\" September, 1861."], [275, "241 UTTOXETER. circumstances varying with places \u2014 the population of any one locality bears with another, as a general rule, a relative proportion to the number of houses. Ac cording to this principle, then, it is demonstrable to the value of a fraction, that the proper multiplier is 5-J, and, applied to the return of houses in Uttoxeter in 1811, gives the total of the population in the town within seven persons. The population in 1831 was 4,864. In 1851 it was 4,990, and when the census was taken in 1861, the number of inhabitants, as giveu by the local registrar at the time, was 4,810, of whom 2,324, were males, and 2,486 females. The result shows a decrease since 1850 to the extent of 180 persons ; but on the whole two hunched years, an increase of 1,372. But by what law a decrease of the popula tion in the space of one hundred and fifty years, or thereabouts, has taken place, to the extent of 357 persons, which was the case in 1801, and then have gone on in an opposite direction till a surplus is at tained of 1,372 persons in so unmigratory a place as Uttoxeter, it is perhaps impossible to say. The de crease during the last eleven years may, however, be attempted to be accounted for, although, from there having been an accession of new houses, the fact may appear somewhat puzzling. In 1850 a many navvies who were employed on the Churnet Valley Line, or in making the branch to the wharf, were in lodg ings in Uttoxeter, which was not the case in 1861, and about four or five years ago a many children were carried off by diptheria ; and then during the Q"], [276, "242 HISTORY OF ten yearsTmany persons have left theh native place to enlist their energies in the more promising hives of industry, places which have been found to have swelled by such accretions during the same space of time to an enormous extent. It may even be added that the great improvements in the town, extending to localities which at one time were deemed almost repulsive, have excluded a great number to whom any thing like respectability, decency, and daylight do not promise much for their avocations. Although diptheria is mentioned as having visited Uttoxeter in common with other places, yet the town appears to have had an immunity from most other epidemics, which, when they happen any where, often decimate the population. Indeed, Uttoxeter is noted for its great salubrity. When in 1646 the plague was blighting to an alarming extent several of tbe towns about \u2014 as Lichfield, Stafford, and Ashbourne, as well as the adjoining place, Clifton \u2014 Uttoxeter appears to have escaped ; and, although so much oppressed by the exactions occasioned by the Civil Wars, was in a position to afford rehef in sums of money to each place, To Ashbourne it sent a contribution of \u00a33, to Clifton, 5s., and to Lichfield the sum of \u00a32, 9s., with a further sum of \u00a32 to Stafford, all coUected in the town, with the excep tion of 6s. 8d. given from the parish rates. It is asserted, however, in the Staffordshire Direc tory, that the plague did visit the town ; but there is nothing in the constable's accounts to bear it out. A stray soldier or two pestered with it got into the"], [277, "243 UTTOXETER. town, and it must have been respecting them' that warrants were taken out. That it was confined to these men is the more probable from the determina tion to isolate them from tbe inhabitants, by placing them in cabins which were erected for the purpose at, doubtless, the outside of the town. AU this pre caution proves how great an alarm was produced from its dreadful nature ; but as there is no further mention of it, it is almost certain that the inhabi tants happily escaped. It is, also, owing to its healthy situation that Ht toxeter has obtained a distinction for the great age which many of its inhabitants have attained. Dr. Symon Degge, son of Sir Symon, was the first per son to notice this circumstance specially in a letter preserved in Sh Symon Degge's copy of Dr. Plott's \" Natural History, of Staffordshire,\" at Cambridge. The letter is dated August 27th, 1726, and he says, \"In the three weeks I have been at Uttoxeter there have been buried som- men and two women, one woman aged ninety-four, the other eighty-three ; one man eighty-one, another eighty-seven, another eighty two, and one young man sixty-eight. Yesterday I talked with a man of ninety who has aU his senses, and walks without a staff. About a month since he had a fever ; he was speechless two days. His daughter is sixty, and about six month's since he buried his wife, who had lived sixty-three years with him, and was aged eighty-five years.

Archbold, Gent., died at the age of one hundred and three, in 1619, as already seen by his epitaph. Sir Symon Degge himself was a remarkable in stance of longevity, he having hved to the age of ninety-two years. With respect to his famUy on the subject of long life, he states in a note to his copy of Dr. Plott, page 313, sec. 8 \u2014 \" I had seven brothers and sisters, besides myself, all living together not long since, and the youngest sixty years of age.'1' Similar observations might have apphed to inhabi tants of Uttoxeter many times since, and the foUow ing instances, of a recent date, have an interest not much less. Mary Blood, a native of Spath, and said to have been the last person baptized at Crake marsh Church, died a few years since at Uttoxeter, at the age of one hundred and six. In 1814 Samuel BeU died atuthe age of eighty-six. John HiU at the age of ninety, and Catherine, bis wife, in the same month in ber eighty-sixth year, and as previously noticed, there is a tombstone in the churchyard to a Mary Powell, who died at the age of one hundred and thirty two, on the 1st January, 1812. William Adin's mother died a few years since, at the age of ninety-seven ; and Mary Hodgkinson, in Tinker's (1) I am much indebted for these extracts to the Rev. F.

The family of Mynors is one of great distinction and antiquity in Uttoxeter. Theh pedigree goes back to the time of King John, early in the twelfth century, the first of whom there is any account being Roger de Mynors, who had a son, Stephen, to whom and lus heirs Robert de Ferrars granted lands at Barton-under-Needwood, and, by another charter, land lying near White Heath, for their homage and service with house-boot and hay-boot through the whole ward of Barton, and twenty hogs, quit of pan nage. The land granted by the second charter was what was afterwards caUed Blackenhall, of which Sir John Mynors, Knight (son of John Mynors, Steward of Tutbury, tenth, Edward II. , by Sybel his wife, daughter of Sir William Bagot), was Lord, sixth, Edward II. , and by Cicely, his wife, daughter of Thomas Noel, of Newbold, county Leicester, left Thomas Mynors, lord of this manor, fourteenth, Richard II. , and Robert Mynors, his second son, from whom those of Uttoxeter, the Woodlands, and other"], [281, "247 UTTOXETER. places, were descended. A grant was made to the Ut toxeter branch for the fishery of the Dove, from Dove Head to Dove Foot, and five miles up Bentley Brook. Captain Richard Mynors, to whom belonged Holling bury Hall, flourished in the seventeenth century, and served with great bravery in the Dutch wars, and also against the rebels at Colchester. Several others were eminent and prosperous navigators, particularly Wil liam Mynors, son of Richard Mynors, Gent., of Hol lingbury, near Uttoxeter, who safely returned eleven times from the East Indies about 1660. It has gene rally been asserted that the property of the family at Hollingbury Hall, which was on the High Wood, where a farmhouse stands on its site, near Toot Hill, had been wasted in the seventeenth century ; but the enterprising character of its owners strongly contra dicts it ; and besides, in Mr. Lightfoot's Survey, finished in the middle of that century, it does not appear that any of it had been sold, and indeed it is now in the possession of their descendants ; and al though Erdeswick says there was in Uttoxeter a house of the Mynors, it has been supposed to refer to that on the High Wood. The property which was dispersed was that at Uttoxeter ; and it is singular that this was not known by Mr. Samuel Bentley, who in the last century seems to have had no know ledge of there having been one of the family in the town, and mentions the wasted property as belong ing to Hollingbury, in the \" Gentleman's Magazine,\" in 1788.

In connection with the foregoing notices of old families of Uttoxeter, I have much pleasure in add ing the following interesting details respecting the families of John Archbold, gent., of that town, and of Sir William MUward, epitaphs to both of whom, of the seventeenth century, as they appear in Uttoxeter Church, have been copied, and transferred to these pages. For the following particulars I am indebted to Mr. E. J. MUward Barnard, of Greenwich, who is a descendant from both of these worthies, and who has bestowed much time and trouble in coUecting the arms, pedigrees, and other matters relating to his ancestors, and their various branches, from the \" Heralds' Visitations,\" and from churches and private"], [288, "254 HISTORY OF sources. Sir WiUiam MUward married Catherine, daughter of John Fleetwood, of Caldwich.

His descendant, Colonel Henry Archbold, was with Penn and Venables at the con quest of Jamaica, where he settled. By his wife, who was the daughter of Colonel Byudloss, he had many children, who are now represented by some of he families possessed of property iu the island. His second sister married Thomas Chambers, and his third married Walter Mynors. His father married Margery, daughter of William Dethick, of Newhall. His earhest recorded ancestor was Owen Mylward (so spelt in the \" Herald's Visitations\"), who lived in the year 1392. Of his subsequent ancestors, one was married to Joane Pembridge, who was de scended from an ancient Herefordshire family. Ano ther was of the Kniveton family, of Kniveton,'1' near Ashbourne.

Thomas Lightfoot married Miss Eliza beth Bagnall, a gentlewoman of very good family in Staffordshire, three of whose family were made knights by Queen Elizabeth, for their marfial prow ess and valour in the then wars in Ireland against the rebels. She was a woman of exemplary piety, and died January 24th, a.d. 1636, at the age of seventy-one years. The inscription on the Rev. Thomas Lightfoot's monument in Uttoxeter Church was written by his son, Peter Lightfoot, the physician, as stated, and furnished to Strype by tbe Eev.

One of the principal and most interesting of old customs still observed in Uttoxeter takes place on the 1st of May, and it is that of groups of chUdren carrying garlands of flowers about the town. The garlands consist of two hoops, one passing through the other, which gives the appearance of som- half circles, and they are decorated with flowers and ever greens in much profusion, and surmounted with a bunch of flowers as a sort of crown, and in the cen tre of the hoops is a pendant orange and flowers. Mostly one or more of the chUdren carry a little pole or stick, with a coUection of flowers tied together at one end, and carried vertically, and the children themselves are adorned with ribbons and flowers in a profuse manner. Thus they go from house to house, which they are encouraged to do by the pence they obtain, and so, unsuspectingly, perpetuate a cus tom of the highest antiquity ; for, hke others, it is a rehc of heathenism, the Druids observing the 1st of May in honour of the goddess Flora.

These, doubtless, were two of the Holy WeUs of a remote age, and which were regarded sacred amongst the Britons ; for of simUar weUs in Cornwall Bor laise says the Druids pretended to predict future events. On the subject of holy wells in Stafford shire, Dr. Plott has these interesting observations \u2014 \" They have a custom in this country, which I ob served on Holy Thursday at Breewood and Bele brook, of adorning their wells with bows aud flowers. This, it seems, they do, too, at aU gospel places, whether weUs, trees, or hills, which being now only for decency's sake is innocent enough. Heretofore, too, it was usual to pay this respect to such wells as were eminent for curing distempers on the saint's day whose name they bore, diverting themselves with cakes and ale, and a little music and dancing. But whenever they begin to place sanctity in them \u2014 to bring alms and offerings, or make vows at them as the ancient Germans and Britons did, and the Saxons and English were too much inclined to, I do not find but they were forbid' devotion in those times as well as now, this superstitious devotion being called well worship, and was strictly prohibited by Anglican counsels as long ago as King Edgar, and in the reign of Canutas.\" There is a striking identity betwixt the mode of adorning wells in this county, as described by Plott, and the manner in which the far-famed weUs of Tis-"], [300, "266 HISTORY OF sington were decorated about eighty years ago. I learn from a very old man that when he was a boy green hawthorn was cut down in Dovedale, where, from the warmth of the situation, verdure would be the earhest, and was conveyed to the vUlage and stuck in the ground about the various weUs, when flowers were strewn over them and tied to them^in the form of garlands. This fact, I think, clearly fixes the practice of the interesting custom in the vUlage before the introduction of any Christian cere monies, and probably proves that it has been con tinued there almost uninterruptedly from British and heathen times.'1' Somewhere near the Dove a weU was formerly known as St, Cuthbert's WeU \u2014 the saint to whom Doveridge Church is dedicated \u2014 and was probably the well of an ancient baptistry, in connection with the church.'2' I beheve it existed near the ravine on the hiU side overlooking the Dove, and, therefore, a little north both of Doveridge Church and the Hall.

In theatrical amusements the town of Uttoxe ter was well cared and catered for tiU the beginning of this century ; for during the theatrical season it supported one and two theatres \u2014 oue at the Black Swan Inn, and another at the Red Lion Room. Stanton's company catered for the admirers of the drama in Uttoxeter for many years, and were well patronised by aU classes in the neighbour hood. Mr. Samuel Bentley wrote several prologues for them in 1767. One of these was recited by Master S. Stanton, when a benefit was being given for the chUdren of the company. Another of these compositions was spoken by Miss Stanton in 1770, when the Right Hon. Sir Henry Cavendish, Bart., the Right Hon. Lord and Lady Vernon, and many other persons of distinction, were present. But to a late period Mr. Bentley favoured the Stanton com pany with effusions of this class, and to the last was one of their patrons and friends. It was at Uttoxeter, with this company, that Miss Harriett Mellon first made her debut on the stage. At the time she stayed at a house in Church Street, occupied by the friends of the late Mrs. Baxter, who recollected carrying her luggage to the room of the Red Lion Inn, where the performances took place. She remembered this her first .appearance very well,"], [308, "270 HISTORY OF and spoke of her as not less amiable and kind in disposition, than handsome in her appearance. But the celebrity of this lady is, perhaps, more especially due to her becoming the wife of Thomas Coutts, Esq., the wealthy banker, and afterwards, on the death of Mr. Coutts, being married to the Duke of St. Albans. Mr. Coutts had been previously mar ried, but lost his wife, by whom be bad three daugh ters, aU of whom were married to uoblemen of the highest rank. Mr. Coutts was a munificent patron of the meritorious actors of his day, and it is sup posed his intimacy with Miss MeUon originated from this circumstance. She proved to him the greatest blessing, and made him the happiest of men. His immense wealth was left to her. At her death, how ever, at which time she was a duchess, she, having no chUdren of her own, bequeathed her riches to Miss .Angela Georgiana Burdett, daughter of Sir Francis Burdett, who had married Sophia, third daughter of Mr. Coutts, by his first wife, accompany ing the inheritance with the condition that she should assume the name and arms of Coutts. This lady is Miss Burdett Coutts, whose munificence in doing good is so weU known.'1' Edward Knight, the comedian, also took part with a company at Uttoxeter. He was born in Birming ham, and was brought up as an artist, but made choice of the stage as a profession.

One day, at Uttoxeter, Mr. Knight received a note requesting his attendance at the inn adjoining the theatre, and intimating that he would receive information which would be of advantage to him. On hastening to the inn he found a gentleman of the name of Phillips, who recommended him to apply in bis name to Mr. Tate Wilkinson, manager of the York theatre, who was a person of very eccen tric character. Mr. Knight immediately wroteja pohte note, in the name of Mr. Philips, to Mr. Wil kinson, and in a very short time he received a very laconic epistle, which utterly extinguished his glitter ing expectations. The note runs as foUows : \u2014 \" Sir, \u2014 I am not acquainted with any Mr. Philhps, except a rigid Quaker, and he is the last person in the world to recommend a person to my theatre.

I don't want to come. E.

At the end of the year, however, during which time Mr. Knight remained with the Stafford Company, he was agreeably surprised with a second letter from his former correspondent.

The foUowing is a transcript of it : \u2014 \" Mr. Methodist Parson, \u2014 I have that produces 25s. a week. WiU you hold forth?

It is evident, however, that one was held at this town by Robert de Ferrars, and it was subsequently7 confirmed, first to Edmund, Earl Lancaster, 21st Edward I., 1292, and afterwards to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in the 2nd of Edward II. Before that time markets were held chiefly on Sundays and holidays, for the convenience of dealers and customers brought together for hearing Divine service ; and perhaps this may be one reason why groups of people are seen congregating in numbers in many churchyards at the present day before service commences. Uttoxeter market has long been noted as one of the best in the kingdom, and it is men tioned as such in the Harleian manuscripts. Before cheese fairs were established, cheese, as well as but ter, used to be one of the commodities with which it was supplied. Uttoxeter market has always been, and stiU is, particularly depended upon for its supply of butter, which has been done up at different periods in vari ous ways, to suit the taste and convenience of both s"], [312, "274 HISTORY OF the manufacturer and the buyer. It is at present chiefly turned out of hand either in the shape of rolls, and, consequently, called \" rolled butter,\" or from round butter prints, with pleasing figures cut upon them, such as of a cow, a domestic fowl, a wheat sheaf, a heart, a cluster of acorns, nuts, or flowers, with suitable borders round the edge. Some years ago the prints were nearly eliptical in shape, with lozenge-shaped designs cut in. Very different was the mode of getting up the butter for the market two hundred years back in this neighbourhood, at which remote period it was sold in \" butter pots,\" which were coarse, cylindrical, unglazed vessels, the making of which then formed a considerable branch"], [313, "275 UTTOXETER. of the pottery trade in Staffordshire. An account of these curious vessels, as manufactured for Uttoxe ter Market, and some legal restrictions respecting them, is given in Dr. Plott's \" Natural History of Staffordshire :\" \u2014 \" The butter they buy by the pot of a long cylindrical form, made at Burslem, in this county, of a certain size, so as not to weigh above six pounds at most, and yet to contain at least four teen pounds of butter, according to an Act of Par liament fourteen or sixteen years ago (about a.d. 1661, 13 and 14, Charles II. , cap. 26), for regulat ing the abuse of this trade in the making of the pots, and false packing of the butter, which before was good for a little depth at the top, and bad at the bottom ; and sometimes set in rolls, only touching at the top, and standing hollow below at a great dis tance from the sides of the pot. To prevent these little moorlandish cheats (than whom no people are esteemed more subtle), tbe factors keep a surveyor all the summer here, who if he have any ground to suspect any of the pots tries them with an instrument of iron made like a cheese-taster.\" The use of the butter pots was continued to about seventy or eighty years ago. The observations of Dr. Plott are accompanied by the remark, that the London cheesemongers, who had set up a factory at Uttoxeter, laid out on a market day as much as \u00a3500 in cheese and butter alone. Butter pots, however, are mentioned in the paro chial records of the town forty years before Dr. Plott wrote ; for five pots of butter were sent from Uttoxe-"], [314, "276 HISTORY OF ter to the garrison of Tutbury Castle, on the 7th of May, 1644, and had been bought at the sum of 12s. As this was seventeen years before the Act of Parliament for the regulation of the sale of butter in pots, it is difficult from this to judge of the exact price of butter per pound at Uttoxe ter at that remote period. And yet it may be reasonably inferred that the pots of 1644 were of the size of those manufactured after 1661 ; for it appears the act was passed more for the prevention of any irregularity in the size of the pots, and the mode of packing butter in them, than for any actual altera tion of the size the pots were understood to be. If so, butter then at Uttoxeter was worth but about twopence a pound, supposing the five pots of butter sent to Tutbury, costing 12s., contained fourteen pounds of butter each. About fifty years before but ter was retailed throughout the kingdom at seven pence per pound ;\"-' but this was regarded an enor mous price, which, Stowe says, \" was a judgment for their sins.\" It is highly probable, therefore, that the pots contained fourteen pounds of butter, which consequently was twopence per pound at Uttoxeter, when the five pots were bought, especially as it cor responds with the price of cheese at that time in the town, as to which the old parochial accounts have preserved very distinct information, the sum of \u00a37 15s. lOd. having been paid for 8c wt. 2qrs. 71bs., which was also for the beseiged at Tutbury.

At this distant period the tolls, fahs, and markets, with the borough court, were held by the heirs of Johu Gorenge, at the yearly rent of \u00a34 13s. 4d.'**' Corn, instead of being offered in samples, as now is the case, was, like cheese, brought in quantities in bags aud offered to buyers, and for the quantity bought a certain measure was taken in toll. Corn thus taken, when the tolls were taken by the lord of the manor, was stored in a room caUed the granary, over, or in connection with, the courthouse, and it was reached by a flight of steps at the outside of the build ing ; and, whether correct or not, it is stated that it was ultimately ground to flour \u2014 such as was wheat \u2014 and sold to the poor at a very low price. Against this house a market bell used to be rung at ten o'clock by the collector of the tolls, to prevent chap men forestalling or buying marketable articles before the town was supplied. Cheese was discontinued being brought to the market for sale in the year 1818, when in the month of March a meeting was convened, consisting of some of the principal gentlemen and agriculturists in the neighbourhood, with the late Lord Waterpark in the chair, to petition Lord Talbot, who held the mano rial rights, to allow three cheese fairs to take place at Uttoxeter during the year, and to be toll pickage free.'2' The request as to the fairs was granted, (1) Lightfoot's Survey.

Till then, however, the proprietors or lessees of the tolls did not enforce the payment of toU upon cheese, pitched in the fair, upon parishioners, but only upon parties living without the boundaries of the parish. Of the origin and result of the lawsuit it will not be unim portant to give such a resume as reports occurring at the time wiU enable me to furnish. The dispute about the tolls originated in 1857, in the case of Moss v. Buckley, which was heard before the late R. G. Temple, Esq., Judge of the County Court, on Saturday, January 24th of that year. The defendant, as lessee of the tolls, had seized a basket of apples, which the plaintiff alleged he was carrying through the Market Place on a market day, owing to a refusal to pay tbe demand of a penny for (1) \" Staffordshire Advertiser,\" 1818."], [317, "UTTOXETER. 279 alleged toll. The money, however, was ultimately paid, and the apples restored to the owner, and the action was brought to recover the penny, with damages, or more correctly speaking, to test the legality of the claim. Judgment with costs was given for the plaintiff, on the evidence that the goods were not exposed in the Market Place for sale, but were merely being taken through to a person who had bought them, and that therefore the distress was Ulegal. The case caused considerable excitement, and led to the insertion of a letter in one of the local papers'1' of March 11th, not likely to allay it. It called in question the validity, either by charter or act of parliament, of the right of any toll on cheese set down in the Market Place for sale on the cheese fair days, and urging resistance to the demand for toll untU it was proved that the claim was lawful. The proprietors, however, remained firm in theh demand, and issued placards announcing that the demand for toll for cheese would be strictly enforced at the fair on September 2nd, 1857, and although there was much opposition, the requisition was gene raUy complied with. But at the fair on November 12th of the same year many farmers refused to pay, and the names of several were taken, with the view of suing them, and amongst them that of Mr. Deo ville, of Thorney Lanes, who took the position of defendant, though with the prospect of being sup- (1) \"The Era.\""], [318, "280 HISTORY OF ported by his brother farmers in the case an action against them for refusal was brought. Subsequently several letters appeared in the same paper, pro fessedly to produce an amicable arrangement betwixt the opposite parties, followed by one on the 9th of December, 1857, from a person who contended that the document upon which the proprietors of the Town HaU and tolls rested their claim for toll was a feudal law of the time of John of Gaunt. The re sult was a pubhc meeting at the Red Lion Room, on January 13th, 1858, to discuss measures by which the vexed questiou of cheese-toll might be settled. Although this meeting did not terminate in any decisive issue, the parties concerned shortly after wards arranged to have the question brought to arbi tration. For this purpose an eminent legal gentle man, C. H. Scotland, Esq., was mutually fixed upon by the parties, and he attended at the Town Hall, Uttoxeter, on the 20th of May, 1858, and the day after, when the plaintiffs were represented by Mr. Crompton Hatton, and the defendants by Mr. Grey, of the Northern Circuit. The plaintiffs rested their claim on the ground that the soil and freehold of the Market Place where the cart of the defendant stood belonged to them, and Mr. Fradgely, architect, and Mr. E. S. Bagshaw were examined, as witnesses to repahs, cleaning, and the erection of the weighing machine in the Market Place by the plaintiffs. The plea put in for the defence rested upon two points \u2014 first, that although the Market Place belonged to tbe plaintiffs, the defendant exercised only right of road"], [319, "281 UTTOXETER. as one of tbe Queen's subjects ; and second, that the Market Place belonged to the lords of the manor, for that by the court rolls, the lords of the manor amerced a person for breaking up the soil of Bear Hill, part of winch is in the Market Place, and a number of witnesses were called to depose to hav ing never paid any toU. No award was immediately given on this evidence, for several meetings were subsequently held in Lon don, at which translations of documents of great antiquity were produced on the part of the defendant affecting the question, the principal point in dispute at which being, \" whether or not the freehold and soil of the Market Place belonged to the plaintiffs,\" as aheady stated, and which they contended did, and were, consequently, entitled to the cheese-toU in questiou. The defendant strenuously disputed the ownership of the soil, and contended that tbe soU of the Market Place and the toUs were distinct, although it was admitted that the plaintiffs were the owners of the toUs, which they were empowered by their charter to levy on certain days, but not on arti cles not included in their charter, and on days never mentioned in it, and at fairs estabhshed subsequently to their charter, the toUs at which had always been disputed. The award was at length made, and it decided that no toU was payable by the defendant in respect of cheese exposed for sale at a fair held in the Market Place, not on a Wednesday, and that the Market Place was not the property of the plaintiff."], [320, "282 HISTORY OF Notwithstanding this decision, a demand for toll was made at the cheese fair on November 11th, 1858, and complied with, except in a very few cases. The Market Place, from that year till 1861, re mained unrepaired and uncleaned, when a complaint was made against the proprietors of the market tolls for non-repair. Mr. Dunnett, on their behalf, at the Petty Sessions of June 12, stated that when the case first came before the magistrates, the defendants con sidered, from the nature of their tenure of the Mar ket Place, that they were not liable to repair it, but that the subject had been carefuUy looked into, and they then admitted their liability. At the same time he repudiated the alleged wilful neglect, and com plained that the greatest fault rested with the pro prietors of the different houses in the Market Place, for breaking up the surface for the repahing of drains and not properly replacing the materials. Besides the fortnightly cattle market on every alternate Wednesday, Uttoxeter has cattle fairs on May 6th, September 19th, November 11th and 27th; colt fairs, September 1st and 19th; cheese fairs, March 12th, September 3rd, and November 12th. For many years Uttoxeter had an annual show of fat cattle. The last was held in a field in Short Lane, December 12th, 1855, and was one of the most successful of any that had taken place. At the annual dinner the chair was taken by H. Meynell Ingram, Esq."], [321, "UTTOXETER. 283 The North Staffordshire Agricultural Meeting was held, for the first time, at Uttoxeter, in September 1857. The trial of implements was made on land on the High Wood, in the occupation of Mr. James Bakewell, of the Moorhouse Farm. In every respect, although the day turned out exceedingly wet, the meeting, both as to the things living and manu factured, and the attendance was the best of any up to that time. It is intended again to be held at Uttoxeter in the present year, 1864. The trade of Uttoxeter is principally of a local description, like that of most other market towns situated in the centres of agricultural communities. In this respect it has, however, somewhat improved of late, but not in a way to add materiaUy to the prosperity of the town. The Uttoxeter Brewery Company has extended its operations, as well as the Messrs. Cope, leather and glue manufacturers ; and an iron foundry has been commenced on a moderate scale, by Mr. Bewley, at Brook House. Cork manufacturing is also extensively carried on in the town. Uttoxeter, however, has had its manufactures, and one branch has gained for it a remarkable notoriety, not only as to its ancient existence in the town, but as being in extensive practice at the present day. How frequently it is seriously asserted in books of reference, that Uttoxeter is \" surrounded by iron forges !\" which is enough to give a stranger an idea that it is one of the busiest places in the kingdom. Still if the stereotyped remark does not hold true"], [322, "284 HISTORY OF as to the present, it does, to some extent, as to the past ; for in the fourteenth century it had two iron forges, and besides the manufacture of iron from its raw state, it is probable it was also a great centre for the conversion of it into articles and implements of use for the honour of Tutbury generally, trade being very wisely equalised in those feudal times amongst the several towns of the honour, for their reciprocal benefit. In fact, it was the only staple trade of the town, and most bkely the people for the greater part got theh livelihood either at the forges for making hon, in the making of implements, or by the mer chandise of the same, many persons probably being severally engaged in each. Fortunately the place where these forges stood when in operation five hundred years ago is ascertainable, and it will not be uninteresting to my readers if I now point out the site. It is certain they must be sought for by the side of a stream of water, and if refuse of such places can be discovered in the vicinity of some stream near the town, it may justly be con cluded that it was there the forges existed. Various mechanical contrivances are now employed, indepen dent of a running stream, to produce the blast neces sary to smelt the hon, but in those days the only motive power for the purpose was that of a faU or current of water. The Hockley Brook is the only stream close to Uttoxeter, and it is by this, at the bottom of Pinfold Lane, at the north-west side of the bridge over this brook that the refuse of a forge, or of forges, has been found. In the course of making"], [323, "285 UTTOXETER. foundations for buildings, tan-pits, and holes for gate-posts, on theh premises here, Messrs, Cope have founds quantities of this refuse (a large piece of which,Jbrought to me by Mr. William Cope, I pre serve), which leaves no doubt that the forges existed at that spot.'1' The meadow betwixt Messrs. Copes' and'^the Hockley Road was, doubtless, wholly occu pied by these iron works, for many years ago it was covered by hillocks, ; and when the ground was levelled and drained, about fifty years since, much refuse of iron works was observed : and, what may be geologicaUy interesting, a number of owler trees were found at a considerable depth, as submerged when the land might be a bog. Betwixt two and three hundred years ago there was a trade at Uttoxeter in fuUing cloth, but whe ther^this was of as high antiquity in the town as the bleaching estabhshed at Newborough, and wool combing at Tutbury at the time the iron-works were established at Uttoxeter, there are no means of showing, unless the non-mention of it in the docu ments in the office of the Duchy of Lancaster may be considered decisive against it. However, a ful ling-miU existed in connection with this town more than two hundred years back, and it was at the (l)\"It\"was.by the side of the Hockley Brook that the ancient corn mill for Uttoxeter stood, but much higher up the brook, and above the Hockley fishpond, for the remains of one were found when the railway was made past there. There is a piece of land there called \" Pool Meadow Shutt,\" and this probably was the fishery of the Pool of Uttoxhather, and the mill wheel was probably turned by the water falling from it."], [324, "286 HISTORY OF Tean Brook, a little higher up than the \" Old Mill House,\" which now stands close to the foot-road going to Crakemarsh. It was in the occupation of Sir Thomas Milward, but was subsequently con verted into a corn-mill, when it was held, with some land there, by the heirs of Sir Thomas MUward, and Walter Mynors, Esq., at the yearly rent of \u00a314 6s. 7d.'**' A very ancient mill, independent of another to be mentioned, stood at the brook, a httle below the bridge, on the turnpike road for Spath, within the memory of some old people ; and almost any one recollects some cottages standing there till within the last eighteen years, so that pro bably it was the ancient mill used for fulling pre vious to being employed as a corn-mill. At a more recent period, indeed at the last and at the commencement of the present century, the jewel lery trade was carried on to a great extent in Uttoxe ter ; and it occasionally happens that the wonderful business, the extensive range of shops, and other matters which appertained to them, are the subject of conversation among those whose reminescences reach so far back. The buildings comprising the jewellers' shops, which were of the half-timber class, and seve ral stories high, occupied an extensive site opposite to Silver Street, with a large yard in front coming up to the road. Two brothers, of the name of Cope stake, are recollected to have had this business. They did a considerable foreign trade, besides being (1) Lightfoot's Survey."], [325, "UTTOXETER. 287 under the patronage of the British Government, for whom they executed many important contracts, stars of honour of great value being amongst them. Al together they employed about one hundred and forty men and eighty apprentices. The lapidaries, who were also numerous, did the polishing of stones at their own houses in various parts of the town ; and there still lives an old man in Uttoxeter who served his apprenticeship with them to the lapidary busi ness. It appears the trade left Uttoxeter about fifty years ago, iu obedience to those changes, it is pre sumed, which are produced by competition, cheaper manufactures, and the application of mechanical con trivances, by which extensive manufactures are gene rally drawn to common centres. Calico and linen weaving, as well as the jewellery trade, have been extensively carried on in Uttoxeter to within the last forty or fifty y7ears at several \"jenny shops,\" at which about eighty or one hundred hands found employment. One of these places occupied the whole of the north side of the triangular enclo sure facing the New Grammar School, and another took up the whole space of the side of the yard and part of the garden of Mr. R. D. Barns, in Carter Street. Then, about a half a century back too, there was a cotton mill over Tean Brook, where the \" Old Mill House\" stands ; and in those days Stramshall corn mill was also used as a cotton miU. But of not much inferior importance was the lace trade, which was introduced by Miss Grace Cope-"], [326, "288 HISTORY OF stake, famous in \" My Own Story,\" who hved at Ut toxeter Old Hall. Here she employed many young women of the town in embroidering lace, at which they cleared a guinea a week. She also let out qnantities to the towns and places about. With these branches of trade and manufactures giving employment to so many persons, it is surprising that Uttoxeter, which at the apparently less prosperous time of the civil war furnished such large sums of money for political purposes, was found to be so far oppressed by poor's-rates in 1788 as to have the com mon enclosed, specially for the relief of the inhabi tants burthened by them. The business of bookselling has been mentioned as introduced into Uttoxeter by Michael Johnson ; but it was not until many years later that printing was brought into it, the first printer being Mr. Richards, who estabhshed a printing-office about eighty years ago, he having previously been in the same trade at Duffield.'1' It is not to be expected that the Uttoxe ter printers have turned out of the press many works beyond such as have been of local import ; and yet it may not be without interest to collectors of local literature, which is often Ulustrative of local history, to enumerate some of the pamphlets and books which have come into existence through the medium of the Uttoxeter printers. Perhaps the earhest specimens of printing done in Uttoxeter are the copies of two pieces of poetry reprinted in connec- (1) Father of Mr. Richards at the Post Office."], [327, "289 UTTOXETER. tion with this book \u2014 one on \" Peace,\" and the other on his \" Birthday,\" by Mr. Bentley, the printer of both probably being the late Mr. Richards. I have also seen a poem on \" Patriotism,\" \u2014 the patriotism of Sunday Schools, \u2014 a rather superior performance, also from the press of Mr. Richards, and, if I recollect rightly, from the pen of one of tbe Saddlers. Mr. Richards also printed for a London house an edition of \" La Perous's Voyages,\" with plates, and an Arith metic, as weU as a tale for a Mrs. Holebrook, of Sandon, the name of which I cannot discover. Amongst the books printed by Mr. Norris have been three editions of Uttoxeter Church Hymn Book, and an edition for Marchington Church. For the Rev. Dr. Bevan, formerly of Leigh, he has printed a Catechism, and a Scripture History ; and a coUection of Letters and other pieces by persons in humble life, edited by Mr. Blagg. These are the productions of persons in the neighbourhood at the time, and must be considered remarkable for those they were written by. The \" Christian Wreath of Flowers,\" by the Rev. Mr. Armstrong, was also from this press. It is a small collection of original poems, of which two copies only were on large paper. Mr. Norris has also printed a lecture on \" Botany,\" and another on the \" Philosophy of History,\" by the late Rev. T. P. Jones, of Alton. For Miss Robotham he printed a poem on Alton Gardens, with some pleas ing verses added. Recently he has published a ser mon, on the death of the late respected Mr. Vernon, founder of free Sunday Schools in Uttoxeter, by the T"], [328, "290 HISTORY OF Rev. John Cooke ; and still more lately, \" Pictures of the Lowly,\" by Mr. G. Wakefield ; also lithogra phic views of Uttoxeter Church and Alton Towers. The late Mr. KeUy printed two \" Statements,\" large pamphlets by Mr. Rushton, solicitor, which had re spect to Alleyne's Grammar School. Mr. Kelly also printed an able sixpenny tractate, by Mr. Gould, at the time there was so much discussion betwixt the church parties, it having reference to the subject in dispute. Mr. Kelly started the first Uttoxeter news paper in 1855, under the title of tbe \" Uttoxeter New Era.\" It is continued by his successor, Mr. Smart, its day of pubhcation being Wednesday. Mr. F. Davis printed a funeral sermon on the death of Prince Albert, which was preached in Uttoxeter Church by the Rev. H. Abud, vicar.

The mention of books and printers almost naturally recaUs to mind the name and times of Michael Johnson. Much as he plodded to Uttoxeter with books, there could have been only comparatively few readers in the town in his day, and no very extensive variety of books for the choice of those who did read. Fifty years ago books were very rare in Uttoxeter, but there was a circulating library established before 1824, and in 1830 Mr. John Bowers Smith opened a smaU one at the bottom of High Street. This worthy example was followed by Mr. Norris, in the establishment of a more extensive one, to which readers had recourse for many years. Perhaps, how ever, few readers are prepared to say what one of its most frequent visitors has asserted, that \" he has read all the books in it, and some of them several times over.\" The Permanent Library at the room of Mr. Norris is supported by the respectable classes in Ut toxeter and neighbourhood, and consists of a valu-"], [333, "UTTOXETER. 295 able and extensive coUection of modern books ; and in connection with it is a supply of the high class monthly and quarterly journals and reviews. Re cently a supply of books from Mudie's library has formed a valuable appendage to it. The terms are a guinea entrance fee, and an annual subscription of the same amount. From the consideration of Circulating Libraries to that of Mechanics Institutes \" is but a step.\" The first in Uttoxeter was formed about the year 1839, under the title of \" The Uttoxeter Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and Mechanics In stitute,\" and its meetings were held in the room over tbe stationary shop of Mr. Norris. Tbe opening lec ture, which was an able disquisition on \" The Philo sophy of History,\" was dehvered by the late Rev. T. P. Jones, of Alton, and was printed in 1841, with a dedication to the late Robert Blurton, Esq., of Small wood, both of whom were members of the local com mittee of the London Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. It had a small beginning, for its first catalogue of books, printed in 1844, did not number more than seventy-one distinct works ; but great discretion was exercised in their selection, for at that time a better collection, for the extent to which it went, could not have been found for the purpose. Yet this society did not realize general public support, and in 1845 a rival one was com menced \u2014 the same which has borne the title of the Uttoxeter Literary and Scientific Institution, which has lately undergone a change, and now has the"], [334, "296 HISTORY OF name of Mechanics' Literary Institution. The So ciety for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, if it was not over prosperous before, now became inactive, and its library was sold to the committee of the new undertaking for about \u00a320. The rooms of the new society were, in the first instance, in the Market Place, but as the number of members increased, a more commodious and con venient place became necessary, and the building in High Street, formerly a bank, but now the offices of Mr. WeUey, solicitor, were rented, and used for several years for the library and reading-rooms. The institution has now rooms at the Town Hall, which it has occupied since its completion in 1853. At this time, or thereabouts, the society was in its height of success, and its treasurer had as much as \u00a360 in hand, a great part of which was expended in buying furniture for the new rooms. It was declared by Dr. Hudson, in a work on Mechanics' Institutes, to be the most prosperous of any in the kingdom. Although it was declared so flourishing by this gen tleman at the time he wrote, it could not have been so to the extent represented, from the amount of population ; and even comparatively speaking \u2014 tl at is, by contrasting it with similar institutions in larg r towns \u2014 it could not have carried the palm, judgin \u25a0 of it on those principles of self-support which are the only criteria for measuring the innate vitality and relative superiority, in a financial sense only, of such societies. In thus looking at the institution at that period, it ought to be remembered that it"], [335, "297 UTTOXETER. received many handsome donations from some of its patrons, as from the late Joseph Mallaby, Esq., and support to an extent, and in a way, of which the public wiU not probably be made acquainted, from its then worthy president, Thomas Bladon, Esq. But of course, such external support could not al ways be expected. Once fairly started, its advanta ges and benefits, being so evident to the whole town, it ought, with proper management, to have held on its way, free from the burden of debt, to the benefit of the locality. This, however, was not the case, and when the novelty of the institution had some what subsided, in 1859 it was found to be seriously involved in debt, and the only question was whether it should be allowed to die a natural death, or whe ther some extraordinary effort should be made to retrieve something of its former prestige. Perhaps one of the causes of dechne were the worse than profitless soirees and lectures, which invariably in volved a serious outlay and loss. It was determined to try in that year an experiment, and a fete was fixed upon, and by permission of T. C. S. Kynners ley, Esq., was held in Loxley Park. The proceeds of this, with a public subscription, and the benefit of a soiree, given by ladies and gentlemen of the town, raised sufficient to meet the claims against the insti tute, and leave a surplus in hand, which, had a due regard been paid to the expenses of the fete, might have been very much larger. A fete was also held in 1860 at Doveredge, and, although the day was wet, preventing so large an attendance as at the"], [336, "298 HISTORY OF one in the previous year, it produced a balance, after defraying expenses, of \u00a314. Since that time another soiree and several expensive lectures have again tended to involve the institute in debt, which at Christmas, 1861, amounted to nearly \u00a340, and presented an almost sure prospect of its final close. Ph\u0153nix-like, it has, however, after some modifica tions and a little kindly help, again risen into life ; and surely the attraction of the newspapers sup plied, and the library, which certainly will bear re cruiting with fresh books (which it cannot be with out the support of the town, at the very moderate rate of 5s. per annum, the amount paid for individual membership), ought to be sufficiently great, without any special pleading, and without naming any other motive, to induce a sufficient support to so useful an undertaking. But similar vicissitudes have been common to many other hke institutions with the one at Uttoxeter. Since its formation the Literary Institute has had for patrons \u2014 T. P. Heywood, Esq., the late J. Mal laby, Esq., and Lord Waterpark. Of presidents there have been these gentlemen \u2014 A. A. Flint, Esq., Thomas Bladon, Esq., W. J. Fox, Esq., G. Cooper, Esq., and the Rev. John Cooke has acted almost the whole of the time as vice-president. At the present time it has neither patron nor president. The library of the Institute comprises about one thousand two hunch-ed volumes. Many gifts of books have been made to it, especially by the late Joseph Bladon, Esq., of which, special mention may be made"], [337, "299 UTTOXETER. of a copy of the \" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,\" \" Pic torial History of England,\" and other very valuable works.'1' The Town Hall, besides comprising rooms which were purposely included for the Literary Institute, also contains offices for the police department and savings' bank. It owes its existence to the enter prize of the proprietors of the toUs, which passed into theh hands by purchase a httle while before it was erected in 1853. The building stands in High Street, where it has a frontage of ninety feet four inches. It contains on the ground floor an entrance haU, twenty feet six inches, by sixteen feet two inches, approached under a stone portico ; a lobby (separated from the entrance haU by a glass screen), twenty feet six inches by eighteen feet four inches, which leads into the large room, or haU, which is sixty-eight feet four inches long, thirty feet wide, and thirty-four feet high, for the use of the magistrates, public meetings, and lectures. A gaUery runs round the two sides and south end ; at the opposite end is an orchestra. On the same ground floor is also the great staircase to the upper rooms ; also on it is the the savings' bank, the magistrates' consulting-room, reading-room for the subscribers to the Literary In- (1) Since this was written the library belonging to Mr. Norris has been purchased by the proceeds of a fete at Sudbury, on the grounds of Lord Vernon, so that now the attractions to membership to the Institute are trebly increased.

The Earl of Shrewsbury also permitted a fete to be held at Alton Gardens in the summer of 1863."], [338, "300 HISTORY OF stitute, and the police offices. These are approached by two doors, one on each side of the principal entrance. The last-mentioned department is kept totaUy distinct from the other portions of the buUd ing, and is entered by a passage at the side of the haU. On the first floor, immediately on the landing, is a large ante-room, from which the galleries round the great hall are approached ; the ladies' retiring room, thirty-five feet six inches, by sixteen feet ; the hbrary belonging to the institution, twenty-three feet by fourteen feet ; the honorary members' reading room, twenty-nine feet six inches by seventeen feet ; the female singer's rething-room ; and the sitting room and three bed-rooms of the police department. Under the ground-floor is cellaring, which is let to the Brewery Company. There are also prisoners' ceUs under the pohce department. The architect was Mr. Fradgely, and the builder Mr. W. Evans, of EUastone. The cost of the buUding was between \u00a33000 and \u00a34000. The corner-stone of the Town HaU was laid by Lord Waterpark on the 26th of August, 1853, the trowel being presented to Lord Waterpark by Dr. Taylor. After this the architect deposited a bottle, containing the various current coins of Her Majesty's reign, in an orifice cut for the purpose in the founda tion-stone, and the place was covered with a brass plate, bearing the foUowing inscription, with the names of the proprietors : \u2014 \" The corner-stone of this Town Hall, erected by the following proprie tors, was laid on the 25th day of August, 1853, in"], [339, "301 UTTOXETER. the sixteenth year of the reign of Queen Victoria, by Henry Manners, Lord Waterpark.\" The names of the proprietors are \u2014 Mary Sneyd Kynnersley, Anne Fox, Herbert Taylor, Joseph MaUaby, Thomas Rushton, John Vernon, and Thomas Bladon. The Smithfield Market at the back of the Town Hall belongs to these proprietors, and was arranged at the time the Town Hall was built. It occupies la. Ir. 5p. of ground. The staUs and pens will con tain eight hundred head of cattle, eight hundred and forty sheep, and two hundred and twenty-five pigs. The entrance for cattle is in Smithy Lane ; for sheep and pigs in High Street. The disposition of the staUs and pens was made by the advice of Mr. John Etches, of Harley Thorn Farm, near Stone. The Smithfield cost about \u00a31500. The Town Hall was opened November 29th, 1854, under circumstances of a deeply interesting cha racter. Then was progressing the ever-memorable Crimean war, which left so many widows and or phans of soldiers to the mercy of theh country, and the opening was made the pubhc occasion of an ap peal on behalf of the patriotic fund. The haU was densely crowded. The chair was taken by Clement Thomas Sneyd Kynnersley, Esq. The object of the meeting was introduced by Herbert Taylor, Esq., M.D., which was the opening of the hall in connec tion with so patriotic a cause.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS. alleyne's grammar school. This school was founded May 24th, 1558, by Tho mas AUeyne, AUyn, or AUen, priest and clerk, who founded and endowed it, and constituted the Mas ters, Fellows, and Scholars of Trinity CoUege, Cam bridge, trustees of bis charity. The extent to which it was endowed was \u00a313 6s. 8d. per annum ; but in 1847 Trinity College, Cambridge, consented to raise it to \u00a3144 annually, with the advantage to the town of one free pupil. In 1855 documents were discov ered which revealed the extent of the property of Mr. AUen, and it was conceived Uttoxeter had a right to a greater beneficial interest in it. An information was consequently laid against the college, and the cause, Attorney General v. Trinity College, Cam bridge, was heard before the Master of the Rolls on January 29th aud 30th, 1856. The prayer was, that the court would declare the Uttoxeter and other schools entitled to the increased income of the testa tor's estates, or to some share thereof, and that a proper scheme might be framed for the management of the property of the said charity, for the regula tion of the Uttoxeter and other schools, and for the"], [342, "304 history of management of the 6aid charity generally. The Master of the Rolls decided, February 7th, 1856, that the college was entitled to the beneficial interest in the surplus which had accrued in the case, and added that a great deal might be said whether the coUege was trustee of the schools, with trusts to be properly performed, and if so, that the trust was to form a free grammar school, not to be solely for Church of England purposes, and that would be a trust to maintain the school sufficiently, having re gard to the neighbourhood and its wants. He also thought that rules and regulations might be made for the government of Uttoxeter school, and admis sion of scholars into it, which might extend the benefit, and make it unnecessary to interfere. The informants, however, were heard before the Master of the Rolls, Sir William Romilly, on the 2nd of August, 1856, who dismissed the information. The suit was not fruitless, though partially unsuc cessful, for it was the means of securing a more liberal mode of admission to the advantages of the school ; os' increasing the number of free scholars ; and of greatly extending the limits as to the recep tion of pupils on the foundation, as weU as a hand some new building for the school. The legal proceedings incurred an expence of about \u00a3700, towards which Mr. Rushton gave \u00a3150, Mr. Joseph Bladon, \u00a350 ; the executors of the late Mr. John Vernon, \u00a3150 ; Mr. Thomas Bladon, \u00a350 ; Mr. G.

Harvey, M.A.'1' The present Head Master is Mr. Rhodes ; the Second Master, Mr. Jarman. The original school was in Bridge Street. The first building was probably superseded by the one of brick recently destroyed, which stood about one hundred yards from the bridge on the side next the fish-pond. The same street is, also, or rather used to be, called Schoolhouse Lane, and the Dean's Row, from the school having been there, and from the tithe-barn formerly standing in the same field as the school. The estate of the donor, according to one of the \" statements\" by Mr. Rushton, was of great extent and value. In land there are about one thousand three hundred, or one thousand four hundred, acres, several manors, numerous dwelling-houses and build ings, and several tenements in London. These es tates are let principally on leases. The rents reserved therein amount annually to above \u00a3413 in (1) The death of Mr. Harvey took place very suddenly on the 4th of February, 18C4. He was held in the highest esteem as a model teacher. A costly and handsome mural tablet has been erected to his memory in the school by his old scholars.

A junior Ferrers of Tutbury held Loxley, which is about two miles west of Uttoxeter, in Henry II.'s reign, and in the time of Henry III. it belonged to Robert de Ferrers. In 1327 John de Kynardesleye married Johanna, daughter to a second Thomas de Ferrers. John Kynnersley was owner of Loxley eighteen Edward III. Thomas Kynnersley, twenty second Charles I. ; Craven Kynnersley, seven George II. ; and Clement Kynnersley, ten George HI., were sheriffs. An ancestor of the Kynnersley 's was seated at Kynnersley Castle, Herefordshire, at the Conquest. There is a horn preserved at Loxley, with the proud name of \" Robin Hood's Horn,\" which was formerly in the family of Ferrers, at Chartly. There is no particular reason given for its being Robin Hood's Horn, although it bears his initials ; but from bear ing three horse-shoes (two and one) it probably be longed to the Ferrars, and came into the family of Kynnersley by the marriage of Johanna, daughter of"], [366, "328 HISTORY OF Thomas de Ferrers, to John de Kynnardesleye, through which marriage it is supposed Loxley also came into the possession of the Kynnersleys.

About a mile to the west of Uttoxeter is Blount's Hall, where the Blounts had a seat. The branch here were descended from John Blount, third son of Sir William Blount, Knight, who had lands in Bur ton and Eollestou. Edward Blount, tenth Eichard II. , died without issue, and his property passed to Eliza beth daughter of Walter Blount, younger brother of Thomas. Sir Thomas Pope Blount was the founder of Trinity CoUege, Oxford. In ClerkenweU Church was inscribed on a stone, \" Ann Blunt, daughter of Walter Blunt, of Blunt HaU, and sister to the lady Paulet, and to the lady Sidenham, died 24th April, 1503.\" John Blount, of Blount's HaU, 1527, was High Sheriff for this county. The Hall was taken down in 1770, but the moat may still be seen. When the estate was held \u2014 about 1658 \u2014 by Sir Henry Blount, it amounted to upwards of five hundred acres of land, the greater part of which belongs now to the Loxley estate. STRAMSHALL. Straguicesholle, Stranshall, StronshaU (Stram .shall), is about a mile slightly to the north-west of Uttoxeter. In the twentieth year of the Con quest it was held by Abricus, and afterwards Eoisia de Verdun was lady of Stramshall. A church was built there in 1852, by Mr. Evans, from a design by Mr. Fradgeley, architect, of Uttoxeter. kingstone.

It now belongs to the Earl ol Shrewsbury and Talbot. The many old yew trees near to the site of the old churchyard, indicate the site of the ancient residence and grounds, the mote of which remains. Kingstone Church, which was probably of the fourteenth century, was destroyed in 1860 or 1861. Part of the rood screen remained. Kingstone Church was the burying place of Symon Degge, who was buried in a chapel which he erected at the north side. On one church bell was inscribed \" Ora pronobis Sancte Jacobe\" (pray for us St. James) ; and on a second beU, \" Ora pronobis Sancte Edwarde\" (pray for us St. Edward) ; and on the third, \" God Save the Queen, 1595.\" The new church was erected at Kingstone, at the east of the other, by the Earl of Shrewsbury in 1861. The architect was Mr. Brandon, of Lon don ; the builder, Mr. Evans, of EUastone. It was opened and consecrated by the Bishop of Oxford, October 21st, 1861. Leese Hill is a member of Kingstone, and was the inheritence of the Tixall's and Norman's ; but afterwards by marriage came to Henry Goring, of Kingstone. Wanfields belonged to the Manloves, and was bought by Eowland Man love, by tbe wealth he obtained in the naval service under Sir Walter Leveson, it having previouly be longed to Sir Walter Chetwynd.

Eobert de Stafford held Bramshall ot the king, in the twentieth year of the Conquest. ,tThe Erdeswicks, Willoughby de Brooke, and Sir LFaulke Greville, have been lords of it. A great portion of it belonged to Loxley estate. Dr. Lassitter occupies the old manor-house, which has been traced to 'have been, with the farm, in the family of the late Roger Warner, successively, about four hunched years. The old church at Bramshall, built in the time of Edward III., was destroyed in 1835, and the present one was built from a design by Mr. Fradgley, architect, of Uttoxeter. The tower appears to have been of wood, and it must have stood more to the south than the present church It did not contain any monu ments. Gratwich, near to, was a manor of the Chet wynds and Gorings, and has a church. LEGHE AND FEELDE. Leigh, which is about six miles north- west'of Ut toxeter, was held in the Conquerer's time, 1114, by Ormus, from Galfrid, Abbot of Burton, at lOOs/rent for sixteen years. The church is cruciform.

In the time ofgHenry I. it was given by Geoffrey, abbot of Burton, to one Andrew, in fee farm, for 20s. per annum. Sir Harvey Bagot built a house there for his seat. In 1680 a Switch Elm was felled at Field of gigantic size. It took two able men five days to stock it. It was one hundred and twenty feet long. Its ghth in the middle was twenty-five feet six inches. There were sixty-one loads of firewood in it. To saw it asunder two saws were fasteued together, with three men at each end, and eighty pairs of nathes were got out of it, and eight hundred feet of sawn timber, in boards and planks ; and the sawing, as the price of labour then was, cost \u00a312. It contained ninety-six tons of solid timber. Its size was attested by Lord Bagot and all the workmen, by their signatures. (2) CHARTLEY CHARTLEY CASTLE. Chartley Castle, six miles west of Uttoxeter, was built in 1220, by Eichard Blundeville, Earl of Chester, on his return from the Holy Land, and an import was levied upon ah his vassals to defray the expense of building. After the death of the founder, the castle and estates fell to William Ferrars, Earl of Derby, whose son Eobert forfeited them by his rebellion. Afterwards he was allowed to retain them. They were subsequently carried by marriage to the family of Devereux, and then to those of Shirley and (2) Plott's \" Staffordshire.\""], [374, "334 HISTORY OF Townsend, and lady Northampton gave up all she could of Chartley, namely, the estate, to one of her uncles, the then Earl Ferrars, to whose descendants it now belongs. Of the castle which has been in ruins from before the time of Leland, there remain fragments of two round towers, with loopholes so constructed as to allow of the arrows being shot hori zontaUy into the ditch. The keep was circular, and about fifty feet in diameter. The ancient manor house was curiously made of wood, the sides carved, and the top embattled, and the arms of the Devereux, with the devices of the Ferrers and Garnisnes, were in the windows, and in many parts within and with out the house. For some time it was the prison of the unfortunate Mary, Queen of the Scots, who wrought a bed that was in it. On her way to Staf ford in 1575, Queen Elizabeth visited it. It was burnt down in 1781. The park is a thousand acres, and the breed of the wild beasts of Needwood Forest are preserved in it to this day. It is traditionaUy said that Eobin Hood found asylum at Chartley Cas tle ; and its founder, EandaU, of Chester, is thus named in connection with the famed Eobin, by the author of \" Piers Plowman\" \u2014 \" I cannot persitly my paternoster, as the priest it singeth ; I can rhyme of Eobin Hood, and EandaU of Chester.'

Bromley, which took its name of Abbot's Bromley from there having been an abbey in the neighbour hood, is about six miles a little south-west of Uttoxe ter. It had formerly a number of valuable privUiges, now neglected, and a market on a Tuesday. The hobby-horse was celebrated there thrice a year two hundred years ago, and an attempt has been made in late years to revive it. The horse and reindeers' heads are preserved in the church. In connection with these was a pot. preserved by one of four or five persons caUed the \" Beeves,\" in which cakes and ale were put, and the money collected went towards re pairing the church and relieving the poor. The church was restored in 1855, at a cost of \u00a34000, when the floor was lowered two feet to show the base of the columns. One of the windows contains painted glass of a man in coat armour. At the conquest one Bagod held Bromley of one Eobert de Stafford ; and in the time of Henry II. , one Symon Bagod was owner thereof. BLIDEVELT. The owner of Blythfield, which is about a mile north-west of Abbot's Bromley, at the Conquest was one Hermanus. It came into the possession of the Bagots by marriage, and here they have for generations had their seat. The building is ancient, and it contains many ancient paintings. The church contains a number of altar-tombs, with effiges, and in the churchyard is a perfect cross."], [376, "336 HISTORY OF WOODFORD. This is about a mUe and a half south of Uttoxe ter. In the 31st of Henry VI., Woodford belonged to Ealph Woodford, grandson of Sir Robert. In the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries it is stated \u2014 \" Walter Jeffreys holdeth freely one messuage, and divers lands called Woodford farm by the yearly rent of iijs., in lieu of a sparrow-hawk, at Michas, late Heath's Land.\" THE WOODLANDS. The present Small Wood and Manor House is residence of the J. Webb, Esq. The moat of the former residence is perfect, and is to be seen near to. Betwixt the two lanes near Gorsty Hill is another fine moat, which, I presume gives the name to Moat Spring. Somewhere here, probably where the moats are, was a residence which belonged to the Eugeleys. In the sixteenth century one Thomas Rugeley, accord ing to \" Lightfoot's Survey,\" had 16a. 2r. 20p. of land in the parish of Uttoxeter. But long before it was held by this famUy, it was owned by the Thirkell's, the first of whom in this county was Rowland Thir kell (son of Robert Thirkell, of Grenworth, and bro ther to Robert Thirkell, knight), who married Rose, daughter of John Mynors, about the reign of Edward IV. The family is extinct. A handsome new church was erected in the Woodlands in 1859, near the Manor House. Kynnersley belongs to John Mynors, Esq."], [377, "337 UTTOXETER. MERGHANSTONE. Marchington is about four miles south of Uttoxe ter. It was granted by the founder of the abbey at Burton, Wulfric Spott, to one Wulfag, but at the Conquest it was held of the king by Henry de Fer rers. In 30th Henry VIII., Thomas Kynnersley, of Loxley, possessed it by inheritance from the Ferrers, and it has since passed through a variety of owners. In Marchington Church there is an altar-tomb, date, 1592, to Walter Vernon, of Hound Hill. Henry Cbawner, Esq., of Hound Hill, has lately founded almshouses at Marchington. HOUND HILL. The earliest deed with respect to Hogenhull, Hoe nil, or Howenhull, is of the time of Henry III., when Sir Henry Handbury married the daughter and heir ess of Hound HiU. In the time of Henry VIII. it was sold to Humphrey Vernon, third son of Henry Vernon, knight, of Haddon, in the county of Derby. Hound Hill joins Marchington, and is in that parish. In 1012 the Saxons, oppressed by the Danes, em braced King Ethelred's plan for their extermination, and Hound Hill is named by Hollinshead as the opening scene of the tragedy. The following are the words of this ancient historian respecting it : \u2014 \" Egelred being greatly advanced, as he thought, by reason of the marriage devised upon presumption thereof, to cause all the Danes within the land to be murthured in one clay. Hereupon he sent privie commissioners into all cities, boroughs, and towns x"], [378, "338 HISTORY OF within his dominions, commanding the rulers and officers in the same to dispatche and flea all such Danes as remained within their liberties at a certain day prefixed, being Saint Eyce's clay, in the year 1012, and in the thirty-fourth year of king Egelred's raigne (the 13th of November). Hereupon (as sun dry writers agree), in one day and hour this murther beganne, and, according to the commission and in structions, executed ; but where it first beganne the same is uncertain : some say at WeUowyn, in Here forth, some at a place in Staffordshire called Hown Hill, and others in other places, as in such doubtful cases it commonly happens.\" There is a tradition of a battle having been fought at Hound Hill, which may be thought confirmatory of the account of this old writer, and to this these words have reference \u2014 \" Don't let us lie here, like hounds upon a hill, But march into the town ;\" though there is evidently, also, a play upon the names of Hound Hill and Marchington in them. At Hound Hill alabaster has been quarried. An ancient bronze key bas been dug up at Hound Hill. DRAICOTE. Dray cot, six miles south of Uttoxeter, was held by Henry de Ferrers, in the twentieth year of the Con quest, and in the second of Edward II. Thomas, lord of Boylestone, held it from the Ferrars, by the service of hunting ; and in the sixteenth Edward III., it belonged to one Eichard Draycot, and by his"], [379, ""], [380, "TORQUE, POUND IN NEEDWOOD FOREST."], [381, "339 UTTOXETER. second wife it passed to his posterity, and in right of one of them, Johanna, to her husband, William de Pipe.

Near Dray cot, in the Greaves, Mr. Thomas Hollis, Queen's Ranger, found, in 1848, a British torque of pure gold, formed of eight twisted wires or rods, each it self formed of three other wires, and having two chaste perforated ends, and weighing fifteen and a half ounces. It is shown on the accompanying plate. NEWBOROUGH. Newborough, a new borough established by Robert de Ferrers soon after tbe Conquest. At Edgareslege (Egardsley), an hermitage was granted to the priory of Tutbury, by William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby. At the former place a Eoman coin, of base silver, has been found \u2014 obverse, two heads, with wreaths ; re verse, figures, with four horses in a chariot, and the word Eoma underneath. It is in the possession of Mr. E. Garner, of Stoke. HANDBURY. Handbury, from \" hean,\" high, is an ancient place, the inhabitants being by Brompton called civis bean, or ben, signifying old. During the Saxon Heptarchy it was granted by Ethelbert A.D., 674, to his neice, the pious Wurburga, daughter of Wulphere, where she erected a nunnery, of which she was abbess. Her body was buried here, but on the place being afterwards overrun by the Danes, it was conveyed to Chester, where there is a splendid shrine to her, and"], [382, "340 HISTORY OF Hanbury Church is dedicated to her. The church was erected from remains of the nunnery and priory. About 1842, when it was undergoing repairs, some Saxon carvings were discovered, principally tomb stones, with modifications of the cross and circle. It also contains a number of monuments \u2014 a recum bent figure to Charles Egerton ; figures to the Agards ; one of an ecclesiastic, in engraved brass, to Ealph Adderley, and others. fElede. Faulde is a little to the south-east of Hanbury, and is eight miles from Uttoxeter, south. It be longed to John de Curzon, by gift of WiUiam de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, and he dying without issue, it was carried in marriage by his sister to Nicholas, son of Adam de Burton, of Tutbury, who was living in the time of Edward I., and was witness to Burton Abbey roll, in 1321. A WUliam Burton, says one authority (Mr. Shaw), was Abbot of Eocester ; ano ther says of Croxden. Another William was .stand ard bearer to Henry V. WiUiam Burton, author of the \" History of Leicestershire,\" was a descendant, and died at Fauld, and was buried at Hanbury, April 6th, 1645. Eobert Burton, author of the \" Anatomy of Melancholy,\" was another descendant. Fauld has had a church. TOTEBERIE. Tutbury is supposed to have taken its name from being dedicated to the Saxon deity Tuisto ; but it is"], [383, "341 UTTOXETER. equally as likely to have received its name from an altar there to Tutas, the god of the Gauls. It is supposed there was a castle at Tutbury, as one of a line of forts belonging to the Celts. Offa, or Ken ulph, kings of Mercia, it is conjectured, had a palace here ; but it is certain Ethelred, another of these kings, made the castle there the place of his resi dence. Previous to the Conquest it also belonged to Ulfric Spott, founder of Burton Abbey, and was per haps his place of residence. At the Conquest it was given to Henry de Ferrers. It was repaired by Tho mas, Earl of Lancaster, and was rebuilt by John of Gaunt, when it became a place of great splendour. Bull running and the minstrel's court were instituted by him. Amongst other places this fortress became a prison of Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1831 the rich contents of the chest, which was lost in the Dove on the flight of Thomas, second Earl of Lancaster, on his rebelling against Edward II. , was found, ou clear ing the bed of the river, and consisted of a com plete series of some of the early English coins. The total quantity found was one hundred thousand. A priory was built at Tutbury by Henry de Ferrers, it being commenced about 1080. The present church is the nave of the priory, the west doorway and win dow being unrivalled specimens of Norman architec ture. The arch of the doorway recedes from the face of the church three feet ten inches, and consists of seven principal mouldings, all richly adorned with zigzag, beak-head, flowered, and other devices. There are many other specimens of Norman device about"], [384, "342 HISTORY OF the buUding. The road entering Tutbury from Eol lestone or Burton is called Port Way. It is con tinued through Faulde and Coton, and by Draycott toll-gate to Morton, where it terminates. It has evi dently, however, gone through two or three fields to Marchington ; and Moisty Lane, from this place to Uttoxeter High Wood, must be the original continu ation of it. If so, the Port Way at the south of Tutbury must be a portion of the Port Way I have described as passing Uttoxeter to the east for Stram shaU and the Potteries, to Chesterton. SUDBERIE. The parish of Sudburie, which includes HiU So mer sail and Aston, was part of the grant of Henry de Ferrers. At an early period it came to the Mont gomery family. In the reign of Henry VIII. these manors were brought by a coheiress of Sir John Montgomery, to Sir John, son of Sir Henry Vernon, of Haddon Hall. This branch of the family, how ever, became extinct, when they went to Walter Vernon, of Bound Hill, descended from one of the elder brothers of Sir John Vernon, who married the coheiress of Montgomery. Sudbury HaU, the ar chitect of which was Inigo Jones, is the seat of the present Lord Vernon, who is descended from this branch. The name is derived from a town and district in Normandy. There was a church and priest at Sudbury at the Conquest.

Lord Vernon is a patron of learning. He has organized a rifle corps at great expense, and in the park, which is six hun dred acres, has erected a range and butts. DUBRIDGE, BROUGHTON, MARSTON, SOMERSALL, EATON. The manor of Doveridge, about a mile and a half east of Uttoxeter, belonged to Edwin, Earl of Mercia. After tbe Conquest it was given by Bertha, wife of Henry de Ferrers, to the priory of Tutbury. It was, in 1552, granted to Sir William Cavendish. Sarah, a wife of his descendent, was in 1792 created Baro ness Waterpark. The late Lord Waterpark was a Member of Parbament iu tbe Liberal interest. Tbe family is descended from tbe same branch as the dukes of Devonshire. Doveridge HaU'1' was built in the last century (about 1770), and has a fine 'prospect. Doveridge had a church and priest at the time of the Norman Survey. The present church is of the thirteenth century. It has some monuments, and an arched recess, called \" the holy sepulchre,\" and a piscina. The churchyard has had a cross. It bas also one of tbe finest yew trees in the kingdom. The trunk, which is become hol low, is about twenty-two feet in circumference, while (1) I have reason for suspecting that St. Cuthbert's Well, previously mentioned, was rather to the south of Doveridge Hall, on the acclivity, where there is a cluster of trees within a circular trench. Within the circle a little plateau has been made, on the hill-side, and such steps as might have been used for a well have been dug up."], [386, "344 HISTORY OF the branches extend about sixty-two feet. Doveridge had a market granted by the Priory of Tutbury in 1275, and a hiring market is held there now. Close to Doveridge is Lea Hill, the property and pretty re sidence of Miss Eobotham. At West Broughton, William Parr, Earl of Essex, had an estate in 1544. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth the manor belonged to the family of Palmer. It has had a church. The manor-bouse at West Broughton is occupied by Dr. Williams. Marston belonged formerly to the Mont gomeries. It has an ancient church, fearfully muti lated, the north aisle having been destroyed, and tbe old pillars and arches now appear in the outside wall. The porch has just been destroyed. The font is old, but plain, and there is remaining the place for holy water. It is curious that a rough rail forms the fastening of the door to the chancel, each end falling into niches in the walls. This, as the other jDlaces named here, are to the east of Uttoxeter. The Fitzherberts have an estate at Somersall. The hall, it is said, has been built with materials from the ruins of an ancient mansion belonging to the Montgomery family at Cubley, and is a nice old frame-timbered residence. Somersall has a church. There is a fine oak here forty-one feet round at the base, and at three feet high twenty-seven feet round. The house of Sir Thomas MUward, Chief Justice of Chester, who entertained King Charles I., was at Eaton. Over the door was placed the following inscription : \u2014 \" V. T. placet Deo, Sic omnia siunt anno Domini 1576. Junii 12.\" The"], [387, "345 UTTOXETER. cellars only remain, and \u00ab bare tunnel communicates with them from a distance. There is a monument to Sir Thomas MUward, who died in 1658, in Dove ridge Church.' NORBURY. Norbury, which is about eight miles north-east of Uttoxeter, in the time of the Saxon dynasty belonged to Siward, the great Saxon thane. It was confisca ted from him 'by King William, and given to Henry Ferrers. Sir WiUiam Fitzherbert, knight, was lord of Norbury in 1252, to whose ancesters it was gran ted in 1125. The Fitzherberts of Tissington are descended from the family at Norbury. Norbury HaU was built 13th Edward I., rand was occupied by the family till 1648. Norbury had a church at the Conquest. The present church is ancient, and is remarkable for its numerous richly coloured glass windows, with memorial devices, and for its archi tecture. It also contains a number of altar-tombs. ALVETON. At Alton there was a castle before the Conquest, held by one Lunan, or, as Erdwick says, by one Juvar. The castle, of which there are ruins, was built by Bertram de Verdun. A battle was fought at Bonebury, in the year 716, betwixt Ceolred, king (1) \" Marriage Holme belonged to this charity (Doveridge), and was a grant from the crown, 27th April, 18th Elizabeth, to Roger Man ners, Esq.\"\u2014 Lightfoo-t's Sdbvey."], [388, "346 HISTORY OF of Mercia, rand Ina, king of the West Saxons, who had invaded Mercia. Brompton the Abott of Jour vall, says, \" Ina, king of the West Saxons, raised a great army, fought Ceolred at Bonebury ; when yet Ceolrod (by the advantage of his strong fortifications) so warmly received him, that he was glad to withdraw upon equal terms, neither having much to brag of victory.\" The fortress was of an irregular figure, encompassed with a single, and in some places with a double ditch, the whole encompassing about one hundred acres of land. Alton Towers are built on a portion of the site of Bonebury, where the old lodge \u2014 well remembered \u2014 stood, and now forming a part of the present Towers. At this entrenchment a Saxon sword and a celt have been dug up. The sword was given to Sir Joseph Banks. It is, per haps, deserving mention, that at the foundation of these early earthworks an abundance of wood char coal was observed, when they were destroyed during the erection of the Towers. The improvements at Alton were begun by Charles, Earl of Shrewsbury. A considerable part of Alton Towers, and works in the magnificent gardens, were built after designs by T. Fradgley, Esq., architect, of Uttoxeter.'1' This gentleman saw one of the remaining towers (1) Besides these Mr. Fradgeley has designed other works in tbis neighbourhood, some of which are already mentioned\u2014March iugton Alms Houses, Rocester Bridge, over the Dove, a fine bridge of one arch ; Handbury Schools, Uttoxeter Town Hall (plain, ac cording to instruction), Draycott-in-the-Clay Schools, .AUeyne's Schools, Uttoxeter ; Stramshall Church, Uttoxeter National Schools, Caldon Low Schools, &c."], [389, "347 UTTOXETER. of the fine old ruins of the castle fall. In Alton Church some fine remains of Norman architecture, consisting of a magnificent row of arches, and a splendid pointed arch, have lately been brought to light during a process of restoring. TEAN. In the twentieth year of the Conquest Tain be longed to Eobert de Stafford, and has since passed through a great many families. At Over Tean Major Ashby, in 1728, found at some depth in his garden a Eoman vessel. In the same garden is a spring, called \" WUley Wall Well.\" Mr. PhiUips, late a Sheriff of the county, has a pretty seat at Heybridge, near Tean, and is owner of the extensive tape works there. CROXDEN, OR CROKEDEN. Croxden, six miles north of Uttoxeter, is remark able for the fine ruins of an abbey, consisting of the west front, south transept, and part of the cloisters, founded there for the Cisterian order of monks in 1176, by Bertram de Verdun. Thomas, the first abbot, wrote a commentary on the Bible. The cu rious diary of Eichard de Schepeshead, thirteenth abbot, is in the British Museum. The heart of King John was buried here ; and it was the burying place of the Verduns. A crucifix, with an image of the Saviour, was found, broken, amongst the ruins, by Mr. Carrington, who has repaired it ; and it, with a knight in coat armour, are preserved. A curious"], [390, "348 HISTORY OF carved oak panel of Jesus and the Twelve Apostles has lately come to light, and been a snbject of dis cussion at a meeting of a brotherhood of antiquaries at Manchester. CHECKLEY. In the twentieth year of the Conquest, Checkley or Cedla, was held of the king by Otha ; and in King John's time it came to the Ferrars. The church is of the fourteenth century. The west wall within has had some ancient and curious paintings, which have been foolishly destroyed by beautifying ! Some of the windows have stained glass ; and there is also in it an alabaster altar-tomb of the date 1524, to Godfrey Foljambe, with an effigy of himself and wife. The font, which is Norman, is shown on the accompany ing plate. In the churchyard are three tapering stones, two of which bear defaced figures. They are supposed to be monumental, and Danish, and originally set up to preserve the memory of a great battle fought be tween the Danes and the Enghsh, in which the latter were victorious ; and that one of the armies was to tally unarmed ; and that the stones represent three bishops who feU in the engagement. Tradition also says that a field called \" Naked Field,\" and a place known as \" Dead Man's Green\" (written in the old register at Checkley, \" Tetterton Green\"), represent the scene of the battle, where the slain strewed the ground, and where a human skeleton has been dug up. It is not improbable that a battle has taken place"], [391, ""], [392, "SCULPTURED STONES, CHECKLEY CHURCHYARD."], [393, "FONT, CHECKLEY CHURCH."], [394, ""], [395, "349 UTTOXETER. at Checkley ; but it is doubtful whether the stones have any connection, in any way, with it, not withstanding that such is the popular belief. I am also of opinion that the three stones were originally one monument (most likely the churchyard cross) ; and this, I think, would be proved (although some portions where the fractures occurred may be lost) , if the parts in the earth were laid bare. However, as it is, there is sufficient evidence, I conceive, to support this view of them. If made at one time for the purpose stated (and they are all of one age, one kind of ornamention, and aU of red sand stone), it might be supposed they would aU be of one size. But they are not. Instead, they are of three gradations, and, if put together, would make one uniform tapering stone of about fifteen feet high, more or less, according to the length in the ground, and varying from one foot nine inches wide at the base, to about a foot wide at the upper termination, the stone without figures, which does not seem to have sustained any fracture at the doubtless forming the terminal part. The ornamentation is evidently of Saxon type, but it would be difficult to decipher all the figures. One side of the widest part, or of the widest monu ment (speaking of them as distinct stones), has evi dently contained twelve interlaced figures, of which nine remain in a very defaced form. Of the other figures, which are almost entirely defaced, scarcely any conjecture can be formed, but on both stones the crogs, interlaced, is perceptible in several places."], [396, "350 HISTORY OF The work has been of a superior and elaborate, in terlaced description, so far as the defaced remains afford means to judge. By the side of tbe church is the effigy of a crusader. Dr. Whitaker, in an interesting note in his \" His tory of Whalley,\" where he is speaking of the divi sion of the Northumbrian and Mercian kingdoms, contends that the Calchnth, which was under the control of Offa, King of Mercia, was held at Check ley, and not at an obscure place near Manchester, caUed Culcheth, as hitherto believed, and thereby does much towards explaining the old and singular traditions of the village, though it is not as a conse quence necessary to follow Dr. Plott in his opinion about the intent of the stones. Dr. Whitaker writes : It is strange indeed that the attention of no anti quary has been dhected to Checkley in Staffordshire as the real scene of this quarrelsome and opprobrious assembly. But upon every hypothesis Checkley was far within the limits of Mercia ; and it is highly improbable that a council in the degrees of which so powerful and spirited a monarch as Offa had so near an interest, would be permitted to assemble any where but in his own territories. Let us see, how ever, on what grounds the evidence in favour of Checkley rests. First, the initial \" C,\" in Saxon, was pronounced as ch in church. Thus Cheadde was altered in the orthography only to Chad. Calchnth then would be pronounced as Chalclinth, and the last consonants very indistinctly. Invert the two letters (c and 1) in the middle of the word, and we"], [397, "351 UTTOXETER. have Chacii, or Checkley. Dr. Whitaker, in sup porting this hypothesis, on the constant tradition of the village about a battle, and the slaughter of three bishops ! and the memorials in the churchyard said to be to their memory, proceeds \u2014 \" Compare these circumstances with the character of that council, which is called in the Saxon chronicle ' Gef btfullic' (a word yet retained in the Lancashire dialect, which would be, literally translated, ' flitting') and the vio lence with which it is known to have been conducted, and there can be no doubt that the tradition is an exaggerated account of that event, whence it must follow that Calchnth is Checkley.\"'1' The Saxon word appears to be in these letters \u2014 \" Gef btfullic,\" and translated as above would imply that the council (in this instance of so very violent a character) was not always held at one particular place, but occurred periodically at different places. The Kev. Dr. Langley, of Checkley, translater of a portion of \" Homer,\" wrote an account of the vil lage, which became possessed by Mr, Shaw, who, how ever did not live to make any use of it in his unfi nished history of the county. There have been some Lows in the vicinity of Checkley, caUed Werlows. Fole, or Fauld, and Madeley, are close to Check ley, and in the ninth year of Edward II. belonged to Henricus St. Maure. At Beamhurst is the seat of H. Mountford Esq. (1) \" History of Whalley,\" p. 35."], [398, "352 HISTORY OF TOOT HILL, NEAR BEAMHURST. Since I opened Toot Hill, on Uttoxeter High Wood, I have explored another barrow, with the same name, on the property of W. Beech, Esq., at the Old Wood, near Beamhurst, a little north of Uttoxeter. The opening of this took place on the 4th of July, J1863. The mound is situated on an elevated part of a field close to the Old Wood Farm-house. A hedge and ditch have been carried across its eastern margin. They were probably made when the land was enclosed from an extensive park, which was known as Madeley Park, and which had belonged to the Foljambes, and where there is an extensive site of a feudal residence. The barrow commences on the brow of the hill, on the north side, at about five feet deep, aud it continues that depth part way along its western side, and then gradually diminishes in depth towards the south, until its outline is almost lost. I thought the best way of exploring the mound, would be by taking a cutting, about six feet wide, across its middle. This I did, beginning on the northern and deepest part with the cutting. I felt doubtful whether I was dealing with a barrow, until I came to a slight sprinkling of charcoal, which, at the north side, lay about five feet deep. I kept my first depth through the whole opening, but the layer of wood ashes gradually sloped upwards, thereby showing the natu ral surface of the hiU, to within a foot of the present surface of the barrow, and disappeared entirely, a little way beyond its centre. My labours failed"], [399, "353 UTTOXETER. failed to bring me upon any interment. Within a few inches from the surface, about the middle, I, how ever, met with a fragment of a smooth tapering flint, with beveled edges, not serrated, which was burnt nearly to whiteness. I, also, on replacing the clods, found a part of a flint knife, which had been dug out near to where the other flint lay. By the layer of charcoal sloping to the surface, I think it is clear that a great part of the barrow had' been destroyed. Whilst proceeding with the work I obtained a clue to associations investing the mound with an interest beyond those it claims by being a barrow. Some of the chUdren of Mr. Marston occupier of the laud, came to see what extraordinary work was going on, and a girl playfully asked me if I could run down \" Tootle Field.\" I exclaimed, \" What field is that?\" \" Why,\" she replied, \" this field.\" I was convinced that the field took its name from the mound, and that it was named \" Toot Hill,\" though I had not heard it called so ; and I found, on inquiry, that it was supposed to be such. This Toot HU1 is in a very elevated place, and its name-sake on Uttoxeter High Wood is observable directly south from it, and the scenery around, for a great distance, is of the most charming description. I have already given the derivation of \" Toot,\" but I will here add, that the great prototype of this fabulous deity is supposed to have existed far back in the darkness of time, and in antediluvian days, and that he was the erector of engraved pillars, one Y"], [400, "354 HISTORY OF of which was standing in the time of Josephus, after having survived the deluge ; and that they preserved a knowledge of human and divine things, particu larly of astronomy, and the great moral mystery of the world and its Maker. They are supposed to have been erected in Egypt by the descendants of Seth ; and Syriad, the place where the historian saw one of the stones, being rendered Osiris, or Sirius, favours the supposition. They are spoken of in the Book of Judges as quarries, meaning graven stones. It is supposed that Pythagoras derived his knowledge of astronomy, and of the doctrine of immortality, from the inscriptions on these stones, veiled though they were in hieroglyphics ; and that it is the sublime morality which they taught which lives in the writ ings of Plato to this day.(1) I must, also, here add brief particulars of some other interesting vestiges of Celtic and Saxon ages, which I have discovered since I treated of such mat ters in an earlier chapter. In a field adjoining, at the south-east \u2014 that in which is the large tumulus, which is infested with rabbits, standing close to the Moorhouse, Uttoxeter, and which is one hundred and twenty yards round, and about ten feet in height \u2014 there are two remains, which, if they are not Druid barrows, are most probably hut-circles, within which, if so, there were houses of British erection, consisting of wattled work, covered with clay, or mud (1) \" Hermes Britannicus*,\" by the Rev. W. L. Bowles."], [401, "355 UTTOXETER. plaster. They are but a few yards from each other, are each twelve yards across, and are separately sur rounded by a ditch about a yard and a half wide, and [nearly two feet deep. The edges of the places are about two feet higher than the level of the land, but there is a dipping towards their centre, by which their regular height is much diminished. Both places have trees growing on them, and they are as much like each other as possible. The other remain to which I have made allusion is a Saxon grave, of quite, I believe, an unicpie cha racter. It is in a field to the east of, and almost opposite to, that in which are what I have named hut-circles, and is indicated by a clump of trees, which may be seen to the left of the foot-road going to Woodford. This interesting site of Saxon Chris tian burial is marked by a mound in the form of a cross. The four radii of the cross, which agree with the four cardinal points, are each about ten yards long, and are raised about two feet high, being about two yards and-a-half wide. The place, as men tioned, has trees growing about it, and an oak is standing at the intersection. I have given some attention to the subject of ancient .modes of burial, but I have not read of, or seen elsewhere, any place of ancient interment indicated by, or existing in imi tation of, a cross made of earth. Owing to this in teresting remain being now exposed to the trampling of cattle, it is liable to become, in a short time, trod out of existence."], [402, "356 HISTORY OF ROWCESTRE. At Eocester there was a Eoman station. In 1795 some Eoman works were discovered at the miU, du ring some improvements. They were much like tan pits, probably baths, in which were found several Ro man copper coins, and a spear head, of brass. More recently other Roman remains have been met with near the factory, in the shape of fragments of pottery and antler's of deer. Of these, I possess a large han dle of a vessel of Samian ware, and the neck of an amphora, with mouldings round it. Several skele tons of human beings have also Jbeen found, in con nection with Roman remains, in a crouching position, as if their owners had been protecting themselves from some impending calamity ; and one skeleton was met with, drawn together, as in a hiding-place, in some brickwork, described to be in the form of a large drain.

There is evi dently a Roman (or earlier) remain in the \" Frame Yard\" field, adjoining the church, of a square shape, sunk much below the surface, its four sides being about forty-five yards each. In the centre is a circu lar mound, about forty-five feet across, resembling a tumulous, with a road round it, and with a road to it from each side of the remains. Along the southern, eastern, and western edges of the place, an earth work, in form of a vallum, exists. This elevation along the three sides sweUs out at the south-east and south-west corners to two large circular mounds. There is an opening through the southern edge to the enclosure. It is possible the place was a Roman amphitheatre of small dimensions. One of the Ro man roads went by Rocester, from Chesterton to Little Chester, and is now known by the name of Long Lane.

A church has also re cently been erected at Holhngton. CRACKMERES. Before the Conquest, Crakemarsh was a demesne of Algar, earl of Mercia, and was part of the grant by the king to Henry de Ferrers. Robert de Ferrers gave Crakemarsh to his daughter Maud, on her mar riage with Bertram de Verdun. It has been in the possession of the Delves (Edward I.'s time), one of whom, John, son of John de Delves, whose seat it was, was one of four squires with James, Lord Aud ley, at the battle of Poictiers. There is a field near Bridge Street, Uttoxeter, called Delve's Hall Mea dow. Bertram de Verdun called Crakemarsh, or a place at it, his \" grove.\" Crakemarsh had formerly a church. Lady Cotton Sheppard occupies the family seat at Crakemarsh. NEEDWOOD FOREST. Needwood Forest, in 1656, covered nine thousand two hundred and twenty acres of land, and con tained forty-seven thousand one hundred and fifty trees, including huge oaks, limes, maple, wych-elms, &c, and ten thousand cord of hollies and underwood.

In 1659 Uttoxeter was in an excited condition, as appears from a letter quoted in No. xvii. of \" Reliquary.\" Derby was in a state of revolt, and a number of militia having been sent from Staffordshire to quell it, were halting at Uttoxeter for refresh ment. It would appear that Uttoxeter was inclined to be like Derby, for the shops were closed, and the inhabitants seized tbe militia horse, and a Captain Doughty, of the militia, espoused their side.
