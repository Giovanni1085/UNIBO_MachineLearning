In Crown 8vo, cloth, gilt, 6s. Fifth Edition. Guardian. \u2014 \"A most excellent story, excellently told, and one which we commend with the greatest satisfaction to our readers. The novel is vivid, and full of life and colour; and the characters of the two priests, Father Anthony, the delicately-bred, pure-souled gentleman, and Father John Croly, the jovial, homely, but not less sincerely pious man of the people, are drawn with singular charm and sympathy.\" World. \u2014 \" There is always a certain fascination about the sanctity of the confessional, and Mr Buchanan's young priest, who becomes possessed, in virtue of his office, of a secret ... is an exceedingly picturesque and pathetic figure. Undoubtedly this story is as good as, if not better than, anything that Mr Buchanan has given us for some time.\" Tablet. \u2014 \"It comes as an agreeable surprise to have a friendly and sympathetic picture of a priest in English fiction. A thrilling story. The picture given us of Hfe in the West of Ireland reads like a transcript from nature by a keen and, we are pleased to say, a sympathetic observer. Mr Buchanan has given us an effective story, which grips our interest, and the treatment of which is so generally sympathetic that we cannot but be thank ful for it.\" St James's Gazette. \u2014 \"Mr Buchanan is thoroughly in his element with an Irish tale like ' Father Anthony.' The sketches of Irish life are all happily touched in, and Mr Buchanan has painted bis Mylreawith the brush of a lover of Ireland. Altogether it is a perfect story of its type.\" Daily Graphic. \u2014 \"A vivid romance of the present day, the scene of which is set in an Irish village, and it is concerned with that always engross ing problem to some minds \u2014 should a priest who has obtained information under the seal of confession persist in withholding that information from the minions of the law, even though withholding it means the sacrifice of an innocent man who is under sentence of death ?

The tenantry rose against the landlord, the landlord stiffened his neck, and that splendid constabulary, the R.I.C., came in for some shrewd knocks. The character of Father Doyle, who, for conscience sake, was strong enough to oppose his own order when resistance meant ostracism, is a noble and admirable character.\" British Weekly. \u2014 \" Mr Thynne knows Ireland, and gives what has all the air of being a true picture of an estate and its owner under the Plan of Campaign. Distraint, eviction, impoverished landlordism, ruthless crime, are relieved by military balls and hunting scenes. The novel, on its broad and full canvas, gives us an easily-apprehended representation of the actual results in society of Irish land difficulties.\" Literary World. \u2014 \"Perhaps the best shown characters are the two priests, Father Flanagan, young, prejudiced, narrow-minded, in full sympathy with the 'masses' as against the 'classes,' and Father Doyle, the older man, who, without any special leaning towards the upper classes, being himself, like most Irish priests, ' of the people,' yet realises from years of experience that outrages can only result in eventually undermining instead of strengthening the power of the priesthood. The author points out clearly that, though ' the reign of terrorism' is now virtually over, the Irish landlords will need all the sympathy of their English brethren to enable them to meet and overcome the hard struggle that is still before them.\" Scotsman. \u2014 \" The story of the Irish Land League and the Plan of Campaign is not yet ancient, but it is not unfitting that a good novel should be woven out of it. This has been attempted, and with very good success, by Mr Robert Thynne. The writer is evidently thoroughly familiar with Irish life and with the doings and policy of the Land League. He writes in a pleasing, unpretentious, narrative style, making no effort at sensationalism, and proceeds with his narrative as with no other aim than to tell a plain, truthful, unembellished tale. This is one of the reasons why it may be accepted as a genuine success.\" Yorkshire Post. \u2014 \" He shows us how the hideous machinery of the Land League worked in the country districts, and he does this with an intimate knowledge of Irish character and of the facts. It is osgood hope for Ireland that the doings of that reign of terror are now so much in the past that they can be handled by writers of fiction. They will be shown to the younger generations as they appear to the minds of men who have no political bias one way or another, and who judge them by the common standards of humanity.\" Belfast News Letter. \u2014 \"The attractiveness of the novel is not at all dependent on melodramatic effects, but on those of a legitimate character. The writer has not wooed exaggeration that his narrative might prove a thrilling bit of claptrap, but has been particular to represent tbe Irish people as they really are, and not as they are usually painted by the modern and extravagant fictionist. Like the Venetian, he has delivered a plain, unvarnished tale, which depends more upon fidelity for its force than upon the gaudy colourings of exaggeration. It is bound to enlist the interest and sympathy of thoughtful readers, who prefer facts in plain clothes to exciting fiction ornamented by patois.\"\""], [9, "The Story of a Campaign Estate OR Zhc TLnvn of tbe XCioe BY ROBERT THYNNE AUTHOR*OT \" RAVENSDALE,\" \" TOM DELANV,\" \" IRISH HOLIDAYS,\" ETC. \" Marry, this is miching mallicho : it means mischief.\" \u2014 Shakespeare. \"We have often thought that the motion of the public mind in our country resembles that of the sea when the tide is rising.

Notions of the Irish are yearly becoming more and more confused, and opinions concerning their merits and prospects are in so transitional a state that, except, perhaps, in some Irish circles, old estimates are generally dismissed as obsolete. Let us praise the author of Ravensdale for seeing this. His peasants are not ' men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.' He avoids the patois, so rankly racy of the soil, which has been generally used in Irish fiction ; nor does he indulge in the conventional local colour, so wonderful in height and depth, that there is nothing like it in other human societies. The book is free from vulgarity and immorality, from tricks of style and imitation of those dealers in Irish fiction who, from to the author of , have done irreparable mischief by using the arts of caricature, and every method of insincerity, to increase the antago nism between English and Irish modes of life, and impede that mutual acquaintance which might have secured mutual respect.\" The personal references are left blank here. The extract itself is given for what is suggested favourably, rather than for what is otherwise commented on. Not but the strictures may have their final application in a reading public, which encourages and is supplied. In pursuit of these same suggestions, the following pages have been written, though not without a perception"], [14, "PREFACE VI of the disadvantages such a mode of treatment entails, apart from the merits or demerits of the result. Paradoxical\u2014 nay, incorrect, as it may appear \u2014 the mind, in the matter of mere amusement, rests most satis fied when entertained with familiar and even conventional types. The incidents may be new, the complications novel and striking, but custom directs that old favourites should be recognised throughout these various evolutions. There is reason for this. After all, what is fiction ? what is the imaginative art itself but the reproduction of ideas already in association with the minds of its audience ? It must be admitted that this is particularly hard on the writer of Irish fiction. Here convention is specially rigid and exacting. Usage demands that such a writer should confine himself to two departments of his art, if they are worthy of the name \u2014 Buffoonery and Sentiment. He may revel in one or the other, he may even combine them ; but to go outside these limits is to provoke the question whether he is acquainted with the country he has taken in hand. Is there reason for this, too ? The peculiar hardship of the case is that there is not. It is demonstrable that the essential requirement of fiction, of all imaginative art, is this recognition, in the minds of its audience, of the ideas presented to it. Equally demonstrable is the fact that the ideas of Irish fiction have no corresponding being in nature ; they are conventional. The substance exists, but our Irish artist is advised to give his attention to the shadow instead. He is told, it would appear correctly, that his audience accepts as representatives of reality that"], [15, "PREFACE VII which has no claim upon reality at all. And this accept ance is founded on custom only. To be sure, this latter assertion admits of a certain form of denial. It may be said that no audience, even iu its most imaginative moods, accepts convention for convention's sake only. In replying, there is no need to instance those half truths, so dear to half minds. If for no other reason, our present theme is mere amusement \u2014 the occupation of the idle hour. Under such circumstances, no one is asked to examine his mental fare as to whether it contains the proper proportion of truth-forming elements, or whether the seasoning employed is to be weighed by the grain or by the bushel. Certainly there is an Irish character. \"Would that the powers of the present writer were adequate to do justice to it ' Failing that, exception may be taken to the mere caricatures and travesties which are offered instead. Nor is the complaint untenable that more honest work is thus handicapped. Especially as regards Irish fiction, the high seasoning has had its results, and the public taste, first grown vitiated, has next palled. To drop metaphor, the mind, where it takes no near interest in matters, is ever prone to accept a sentimental, or even a ludicrous, view of them. Misrepresentation of Irish character has not brought merely a conventional taste with it. A proportionate weakening of interest has followed. The easy tear, the loud laugh which speaks the vacant mind \u2014 are not these the counterfeit exchange for true sympathy ? The public has ceased to try to understand \" these Irish \" ; difficult, indeed, would be the task from the materials presented to it !"], [16, "VIII PREFACE The following pages are written with little hope, or even intention, of working out a more legitimate course in Irish fiction. The task would demand greater and more varied qualifications than mere honesty of repro duction. There must be honest invention, too, not the travesty which couples impossible character with equally impossible incident. Nay, what could exclusive develop ment of the Irish side of human nature yield but another travesty of still more unsympathetic type ? Nature itself must be the basis of all imaginative art, which the local colourist should be careful not to hide. He should seek for semblances more than for contrasts. When he succeeds there is uniformity rather than the contrary. The canvas is less glaring, and thus appears more common. If these be humble aspirations, the present writer is aware that he has fallen short of them. In the former story his hope was to represent the men and motives of a past phase of Irish history \u2014 that of the Emmet insurrec tion of 1803 \u2014 as he read it. In the present tale men and their motives are similarly taken in hand under a some what similar phase, only of to-day. There is merely an earnest study of his subject and absolute singleness of purpose. There will be found no sentiment. If the writer has not attained to the native humour of his countrymen, he has certainly not clothed them in the foreign garb of the buffoon. For the rest, the story being of to-day, no attempt has been made to catch the dignity of history. Rather the contrary has been sought.

ABOUT the period of the opening of these sketches, scenes such as now distinguished the Ballinteer estate were beginning to make themselves apparent, here and there, throughout the country parts of Ireland. Matters were to become worse ; the \" unwritten law \" of the Land League was not so supreme as it was yet to be. As a foretaste, landlords were left \" severely alone,\" and some show of agricultural operations were carried on by the aid of emergency-men under police protection. Here is one of such scenes which, not infrequently, presented itself to the tourist in Ireland. For the time being, our imaginary spectator is monarch of all he surveys. But charms the solitude certainly has. They are charms once cultivated, too ; so much he can see for himself. The flowing stream had been taught \u2014 here to tumble down a cunningly-constructed impediment \u2014 there to expand into a miniature lake. The tall and stately trees have been artfully formed into clumps for effect : even in the succession of hill and dale, is still traceable the hand of man. But now the stranger is alone with inanimate nature."], [22, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 14 Yet, hark ! footsteps approach. They are those of an emergency-man. Behind him follow two policemen, armed in the semi-military fashion of the Irish constabulary force. The business of the emergency-man is to unlock a gate, in order that some cattle may pass from the field they have been grazing in to an adjoining one. While he performs his task, the two policemen lean on their rifles ; his task performed, the emergency man again takes the lead from the scene. No word has been spoken. The business of the constabulary is to protect life and limb, only. Soldiers \u2014 mere soldiers \u2014 might, and did, assist in agricultural operations, even to fraternisation. But, on duty, it behoved an Irish policeman to consider himself as a higher exponent of law and order. We leave the scene ; our concern lies with this small escort and its smaller charge, whom we now, in our turn, also follow. In the meantime, doubtless, our imaginary tourist is reflecting over what he has seen ; eventually he may write a book on it. But, before doing so, we trust he will peruse the following matter-of-fact memoirs. Half-an-hour's walking has brought the objects of our present attention to a small temporary, though bullet-proof, structure. Here there is another policeman and another emergency-man, and preparations for the mid-day meal are in progress. Duty disposed of for the time, our company evinces symptoms of loquacity, especially the semi-military portion of it; the emergency -men have grown up in bucolic taciturnity, and now silently await meal-time. The returned members of the Force divest themselves of their arms and accoutre ments ; the stay-at-home member is already in undress. Thus brought nearer alike in external guise, natural and inherent distinctions are seen to assert themselves. One of tbese"], [23, "THE POLICE HUT 15 returned members is as unmistakably from the north of Ireland as his companion hails from the southern extremity of the country. The third is local, belonging to the intermediate Leinster, in which province the Ballinteer estate lies. Macnab, such being the patronymic the Ulster man bears, is tall and soldierly, further displaying many of those Scottish terms of speech and thought which he has inherited from his Caledonian ancestors. On the other hand, \" Rebel Cork,\" for so his companions playfully designate him, offers a sufficiently strong contrast in his broad Milesian accents and Celtic idiosyncrasies. Rebel, however, he is none, having accepted service with honest and single interest toward the duties thereof. \"Now, Cook\" \u2014 this from Macnab to the Leinster man \u2014 \"how times the bit meal wi' the clock. Ye'll call to memory sundry discrepancies of late. Whiles, it 's behind the hour \u2014 then it's hurried up, and no' that satisfactory. I ay notice the like disagreements as a man comes south.\" \" Why don't you take the cooking yourself, Macnab . \" was the rejoinder. \" Me ! the officer in charge ! Hout, man ! this is no respectful talk ! \" \" I 'd take it myself, rather,\" said Rebel Cork, whose real name was Mahony ; \" Macnab would poison us all round with some of his Scotch abominations.\" \"I'll make a cock-a-leekie for ye some of these days,\" volun teered the inconsistent Macnab ; \"or what say ye to a sheep's head haggis . Mind, you '11 have to be ceevil, and someone will have to write my reports.

'We can't spare you from where you are, Macnab, or it's promotion we'd be offering you.' That's the answer I'd get.\" By this time the belated meal had been served, and the united company commenced to partake in common, though not, however, to the total cessation of the conversation. Again Macnab led the discourse. \"These owners of Ballinteer \u2014 Annesleys, I've heard you call them, Kelly?\" The constable who had so lately exercised the office of cook nodded, adding, \"Annesleys they were, an Annesley there is stiU \" \"Forbye, Ballinteer House being closed for years \u2014 as my information runs . You 've been raised in these here parts, Kelly?\" \" Boy and man, I' ve known Ballinteer House : open to hospitality, as it was \u2014 empty and closed, as you remark now.\" \" Hem ! hospitality ! \u2014 maybe overmuch of that 1 \" \"It may be Macnab is right, Kelly,\" interposed the Corkonian. \"Doubtless, among his other observations, his notice has extended to a warmer disposition in his travels south.\" Even the bucolics laughed ; but so did Macnab, too. \"'Deed, but the Cork man is right. Extremes meet in point of retort, as in more solid exercises of the mind. I '11 no deny the Hke observation to the south, more specially to Cork. The now, extremes meet on neutral ground. Proceed, Kelly, to afford us your local information.\" Thus appealed to, the local man, nothing loth, continued : \"Cork is right enough, Macnab. Nor will I gainsay your own comment ; fashion had it so, and the Annesleys were not behind their neighbours. It may be there was overmuch of"], [25, "THE POLICE HUT 17 the open house, as you say. What should a gossoon, as I was then, know about the like ? Anyway, the estate grew smaller, and, finally, the family went abroad. You are not to confound what was with what is. An open house is counted no dis paragement in these parts, nor yet further south, as Mahony will tell you, Macnab. A new fashion has come up, but not from their objection to the old. The Annesleys were popular, and could have stood their ground on that head \u2014 ay, and on other heads \u2014 if orders hadn't come from outside \" \"From headquarters \u2014 from the wire-pullers?\" \" Just so. There 's the Castle of Dublin, from where we get our commands ; and there 's a mock Castle, from where the people get their commands. That's the later fashion I speak of. How the Annesleys are going to stand such test remains to be seen ; and that, I 'm told, will lie soon.\" \" The family purposes to return ? \" \" There is only one young man now. Well, the rumour is that the present owner of Ballinteer means to see the game with his own eyes \u2014 and without police protection, too. So, Macnab, now 's your time to urge your claims upon the Castle \u2014 the real Castle.\" Again the bucolics made audible intimation of their appre ciation of this encounter of northern and southern wit; but Macnab's reply assumed a more serious tone. \"Dinna drive a joke to death, Mahony. As for this yourn,' owner of Ballinteer, we can all understand the situation. He'll be too heavily weighted ; a stranger can see that. These wire pullers \u2014 these leaders of the people, as they call themselves \u2014 may not let go their grip of such favourable conditions as the Ballinteer estate presents to them.\" \"Ay, to them, Macnab \u2014 you're about right there.\" \"Just so \u2014 to them, for the purposes they have in hand. B"], [26, "18 THE TURN OF THE TIDE An impoverished landlord, asked to make impossible con cessions ! Those are the conditions the Land League seeks, and follows up. I rather think it will follow this up. The popularity of the name he bears may save this young man from actual violence. But friend and follower will have to give him a wide berth, or they '11 know wherefore. That 's the fashion you speak of, Kelly. Well, it's no' a hospitable fashion, whatever way you take it.\" The approaching clatter of horse-hoofs was now heard. The sound was a familiar one, for the members of the Force rose from their seats, and stood to \" attention !\" Presently, a young man, the constabulary officer of the district, entered the hut. Macnab reported \" All quiet ! \" to his superior's question. \" 'T is well,\" was the officer's comment, given with an ex pression of satisfaction. \" We are needed elsewhere. A decree was obtained against Cullen, of Bartra, for five years' rent, last week. It is purported to drive the cattle off tlie lands before the decree can be executed. We have reason to regard the information as correct. Anyway, we must act upon it\" \" Bartra is ten miles distant as the crow flies. It cannot be reached by sundown.\" \" No. And nothing can then be done until sunrise. We must be there at sunrise, travelling under the shade of night. How many are you here, all told ? \" \" Five, counting the emergency-men.\" \"Their assistance is indispensable. The cattle, if we find them, must be driven to Kells ; there is no Pound nearer. Moynalty will furnish ten men \u2014 Mullagh six. We may need all, and more. I am going to look up a station or two, yet.\" Then, having given more minute instructions as to time 'of starting, place of general meeting, arms and ammunition to be brought, the Inspector proceeded on his further way."], [27, "CHAPTER II. HOW THE BRIDGE WAS KEPT. IT was not until after midnight that our small contingent from the Police Hut on the Ballinteer estate joined the main body of the Force, whose final destination was the farm of Bartra. Such movements of the constabulary, in assist ance, or rather mere protection, of the purely civil issues of the law, were narrowly watched, and intelligence thereof swiftly communicated from townland to townland. Hence the necessity for selecting the most lonely hours of the night, as also the most deserted bye-ways which intervened. The night happened to be a dark and tempestuous one, affording all the more reasonable prospect of thus stealing a march on Cullen's farm. Long, however, before the advent of the dawn, and while the farm itself was yet some miles distant, such prospects were found to be illusory. Scouts rose from the most un frequented spots, and stole silently away. Soon this silence was exchanged for an increasing and accompanying din. Horns were blown along the route, and the chapel-bell loudly proclaimed to all who had ears to hear, to be up and stirring. When the dawn did appear, the hills on either side of the advancing party were seen to be covered with wildly gesticulating and apparently highly- excited mobs, keeping pace witli it."], [28, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 20 Occasional showers of stones reached the comparatively small constabulary force, and attempts, too, were made to cut down trees to further impede its course. Both efforts were sought to be evaded by a more rapid advance. But, so far, no nearer conflict was entered upon. In fact, such tactics seemed to argue no higher motive than delay, causing the trained force to press on with redoubled speed. The proof of this was apparent when the farm itself was reached. The cattle had been hastily driven in from the outlying portions of it, preparatory to their removal to other lands where distraint, in its legal acceptation, would not hold good. So far, the constabulary detachment was sufficiently in time, with the additional advantage of having the cattle brought together. Nevertheless, the task before it was known to be an arduous, and even perilous, one. For, trying and exasperating as had been the last few miles of advance to the farm, there was now an equally long march, encumbered by some fifty head of cattle, before the police detachment ; while the opposing body, now largely increased, and certainly outnumbering it ten or even twenty times over, had lashed itself into a perfect fury of resentful dis appointment. In this critical position, an unexpected advocate of law and order appeared in the person of the owner of the farm himself. Cullen was now an old man. He was known to be in comfort able circumstances, and had the character, whether deservedly or not, of being at the same time both timorous and greedy. His action on the present occasion went far to prove the correctness of the public judgment. A few years ago, in all probability, he would have paid his rent and secured his cattle. But with advancing years, avarice and timidity, if they have existed, rather increase than diminish. He feared the Land"], [29, "HOW THE BRIDGE WAS KEPT 21 League, whose power was now becoming confessed throughout the country ; while its promises to preserve to him both his money and his stock so far successfully acted on his greed. Thus he had given his consent that his neighbours, who probably would have no such choice when their own turns came, should remove the cattle to a temporary place of safety. But now, when he found this object frustrated, and law really in the ascendant, his natural cowardice dictated the side he should join. Slowly, and still hesitatingly, the old man took his money from its place of security, with a view of tendering it in payment of his debt. But Cullen's fears were not confined to the Land League alone. He possessed two sons, whose action on the present morning had been particularly conspicuous and defiant. Probably they had their anticipations of their father's vacilla tion, or rather change of purpose ; for they now followed him to his room, and a lengthened and angry conference was the result. However, for once the old man appeared to have been firm, and the two young men left the house quietly, and even stealthily. Then ensued a still longer interval. The cattle were becoming restless. The young Cullens had rejoined their companions, mostly young men of their own age. It was from this point of time that the restlessness of the cattle became most apparent. The civil authorities accompanying the constabulary force, disliking the aspect of affairs, approached the old man for his final decision in the matter. To all appearances he still hesitated. His strong-box was open, his money was on the table beside him, but no actual tender of it was made by him. The noise and tumult outside grew apace. Suddenly there was a scuffle ; angry voices rose ; the"], [30, "22 THE TURN OF THE TIDE thundering of many hoofs resounded; the cattle had burst away. The confusion appeared to restore the old man, once agam, to his firmness. He collected his money together. He put it into his strong-box, which he locked carefully and even slowly. After that, he faced the civil authorities sadly, but with the same deliberation. \" You see my position, gentlemen \u2014 it is a very painful one. I daren't pay rent ; the cattle must go.\" The cattle had already gone \u2014 of that there could be no doubt. The cattle had gone first; the young men of the district had managed to throw themselves between the herd and the constabulary ; but the constabulary, suspecting a trick, were well on their heels ; and the whole stampede was now a compact mass in rapid movement. The ruse of the young Cullens \u2014 for such it was \u2014 could hardly have given promise of ultimate success to them. Probably, its effect on their father was all that was anticipated, or hoped for. The old man would have preferred to keep his cattle as the more valuable of the two. But the fierce zealots of the Land League were satisfied that the payment of rent should be averted at all cost. This was their only success. Soon, the stampede resolved itself into more regular components. The constabulary dis placed the young men from the mass altogether, putting the emergency-men in their stead. Then, the constabulary took up a position on each side of the herd, their assailants again retiring to the hills on either hand. All the time, the stampede continued with unabated movement. Up to this time, the police had behaved with absolute for bearance, and, it might be fairly said, with good humour. Rough words, and even frantic gesticulations, break no bones ;"], [31, "HOW THE BRIDGE WAS KEPT 23 while, as for the showers of stones, for the most part they fell short. Their assailants had started the march for them ; but, in other respects, it gradually fell into such disposition as was to be expected by the guardians of the law, and prepared for. Yet, anxieties were on the increase nevertheless. The road now lay through a deep gorge, having a continuous line of heights on either side. For the first time, men with firearms made their appearance on those rising grounds, keeping pace with the detachment as it advanced. The object was suffi ciently manifest. At present, the range of fire was too distant, even for the better arms of the constabulary, to say nothing of the more antiquated guns in the possession of their opponents. But when the line of hills on each side of the gorge approached nearer to each other, as was known to be the case, the position of the small constabulary force must neces sarily become critical, met, as it would then be, by two opposite fires, each exceeding by number the return of the constabulary. Under these circumstances, a halt was called, and the superior officers of the force hastily conferred together. All told, the constabulary numbered thirty. The emergency men carried no arms, and, except for the preservation of their own lives, should necessity arise, were not supposed to act aggressively, or even defensively. The arrangements gradually brought about after the hurried start from Cullen's farm have been already described. They were now subjected to the following modifications only. The fifty head of cattle were placed in front. Their care was entirely entrusted to the emergency-men. Half the police force took up position on one side, half on the other. Practically, all opposition had ceased in the front and in the rear ; it came only from the superior grounds on right and left. No doubt, stones continued to be hurled from the back, and"], [32, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 24 efforts at impediment, such as felling trees and even breaking down bridges, were essayed on the line of march. Still, the armed and converging heights were the real dangers of the way. About two miles from their destination, the physical features of the country assumed another change. The bids terminated with the near bank of a stream swollen by the late rains. The road, down which the whole muster now swept rapidly, con tinued its way by means of a bridge, which, in its turn, led out into a comparatively flat country. The bridge itself was still intact. In fact, the action of the small police detachments on each side had retarded the progress of their opponents, and the emergency-men with the cattle were now actually in advance of friends and foes. The officer in command seized the advantage for a new and sudden change of evolution. The cattle were allowed to sweep over the bridge in charge of the emergency-men alone, and were then in uncontested possession of the way beyond. To the police was communicated the order to halt, and face the pursuing body. For a moment, the forces of order and dis order took the measure of each other's strength. Then, the police steadily retired on the bridge, taking possession of it amid a dropping fire from their assailants. \" In half an hour the cattle will be safe in the Pound. For so long, the bridge must be held.\" It was the officer in charge who spoke, and his men pro ceeded to make tlie best arrangements possible, under nearer and increasing fire. The bridge itself afforded no practicable shelter, and the entire destruction of the force was averted only by keeping the approaches clear of assailants. Here, the arms of precision found their use, though still impeded by the ambush with"], [33, "HOW THE BRIDGE WAS KEPT 25 which the ground in front abounded. Eventually, it became necessary to keep this ground clear by a small detachment, whose business was to storm each ambush, driving its occupants back upon the main body. This was not accomplished without casualties, and already more than one of the police had been brought back by their comrades seriously injured, before a reinforcement, appearing on the road, caused the opposition to abandon further efforts, and sullenly retire. This reinforcement consisted of twelve fresh men, and fortunately was accompanied by a vehicle, the account of the emergency-men being suggestive of its need. One of the wounded men had already succumbed to the violent treatment received. The case of two more was doubt ful. Of these latter, one was Macnab of the Police Hut. \"There 's life in him,\" said Kelly, recognising his companion. \" Not overmuch of it, though,\" was the reply of the occu pant of the vehicle, who was the medical man of the district, and was now proceeding with a more thorough examination. \" We must get him up to the Mount, Mr. Ogleby's place \u2014 it 's the nearest. After that, he '11 have to be brought to town, if he 's worth bringing ; it 's a case for a large hospital only, and a large staff. The other man I will take charge of myself ; if matters go right, I will restore him to duty. But the Force will need more active men than Macnab is likely to be.\""], [34, ""], [35, "CHAPTER III. SISTER ALARY. WITH care and tenderness, the two wounded men had been brought to their several destinations. As regards Macnab, it was found possible to remove him to Dublin on the following day, that being the one hope which the district doctor still continued to entertain of his ultimate recovery. The medical men in attendance at the large public hospital there had done what they could for him. After that, it was a case for nursing. \" What is your own opinion, sir ? \" inquired Sister Mary, one of the staff of nurses, from the house-surgeon, Dr. O'Driscoll. ''Couldn't say. I may ask you that question, a week hence.\" \"But that is saying something, Doctor \u2014 isn't it?\" \"Perhaps. He may pull through the week \u2014 with nursing. \"And then !.\" \" Well, then \u2014 I should begin to have hopes of him. Who is with him now ? \" \"I am supposed to be. Miss Neville has taken my place for a moment; this is her evening out, and she came to say a word to me before going.'' \" Oh \u2014 the young lady probationer. It doesn't signify ; attendance at the moment, as you say, is pretty much a matter of form. He doesn't know anyone.\" \" There is no one for him to know. He comes from the"], [36, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 28 country. It was one of those agrarian affairs \u2014 so they call them\u2014 about which nobody is to blame, so they add ; and, for the first time, the tone of the speaker evinced im patience and resentment, and her natural kindliness of ex pression hardened. The house-surgeon, who had spoken with somewhat of a pre-occupied manner \u2014 probably the result of his inexorable practice : one case off for the time, another case on \u2014 looked puzzled for a moment ; then, recovering himself, he replied, \" Ah !\u2014 you feel strongly on the subject \u2014 to be sure, to be sure \u2014 I had forgotten. I suppose you are right \u2014 opinions differ, you know. Anyway, we have got our own work to do \u2014 each of us.\" Sister Mary took the latter words as an intimation, due more to returning pre-occupation than to any want of courtesy, that the conference was at an end, and resumed her work accordingly. The probationer, just referred to as Miss Neville, rose from her chair as the elder nurse rejoined her. She was dressed for her \"evening out,\" as the rules of the hospital permitted \u2014 nay, enforced. The patient lay, to all intents and purposes, unconscious. \" Dr. O'Driscoll has hopes. I could not rest until I had spoken to him. You know what interest I take in cases such as these.\" \"I have seen no difference in your duties here, dear Mrs. Morris.\" But the elder placed her finger on her lip, reprovingly. Then, Miss Neville took her departure silently. Emerging from the hospital, she wended her way in the direction of one of the suburbs around Dublin. It was a small, cheap, and, truth to say, obscure one. Here, she and"], [37, "SISTER MARY 29 her mother had taken up their residence some short period previously. Short as was this period, it had seen some change. At first, Mrs. Neville had intimated to her neighbours her inten tion to receive a few pupils for joint instruction under herself and her daughter. A few pupils had come. But the teaching staff, instead of proving inadequate, was in excess of the work, regard being had to remunerative considerations, as was only too obviously the case. Then had Florence Neville mustered courage to press a project upon her mother which had been growing in her mind, but which the foregoing result only appeared to bring within the bounds of practical consideration. Why should she make believe to assist, when assistance was superfluous ? Her wish was to go to a public hospital, and acquaint herself with its work. The scholastic duties could still proceed \u2014 single-handed her mother was abundantly adequate for their control, and \u2014 who knows ? \u2014 when she had come to learn her new duties, she too might be making an independence for herself. Notwithstanding these arguments, Mrs. Neville had been surprised \u2014 almost shocked. School-keeping, even in an obscure locality, appeared to her at least genteel. Hospital nursing, in her own young days, was \u2014 well, not wdiat it had become since she had lost touch with the world. During all her life, when she had really lived in that world, she had been accustomed to regard such employment as exclusively in the hands of the Sarah Gamps and Betsy Prigs of a past era. She admitted that the system had received its full share of abuse. But, then, what system had not ? \" As to there being a change for the better, now,\" for so she had remonstrated with her daughter, \" the same was said about domestic service. I hope I '11 never see you a lady-help, Florence.\""], [38, "30 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" No, mamma, I hope you never will. At all events, I have not the least taste or inclination that way.\" Mrs. Neville could not continue the argument on these lines. She herself had neither taste nor inclination for hospital work. \" Then,\" pursued Florence, \" what else is there ? Even if I preferred teaching, the pupils won't come to be taught.\" This was certainly a fact. Mrs. Neville was silent ; but not merely as an admission of what could not be denied ; she was really beginning to consider. The scholastic pursuit, as it had been traditionally handed down to her, had not made itself more pleasant in her eyes by a nearer and practical acquaint ance with it. No doubt, circumstances and locality had much to say to that. But now, if ever, it was her duty to be severely practical, and such was the precise form which had to be dealt with. Yes, it was drudgery, and such drudgery as she would avert from those she loved. She looked at the young girl whose words had thus set her considering. What else is there ? Well, there was something else, though it occurred to Mrs. Neville with a feeling of pain and affright. Some one would certainly ask her to marry him, and Mrs. Neville devoutly hoped the asker would have no special connection with the objectionable circumstances and locality. After all, if Florence were in some safe retreat \u2014 some retreat where importunate lovers could not follow \u2014 she might attend to her own drudgery with an easier mind. Not that she had a fear that her daughter would take a more partial view of her surroundings than she herself did. But, then, the trial, the embarrassment, the affront of it ! Besides, it had really come home to her that \" ladies \" went in for those duties which the Sarah Gamps and Betsy Prigs had undertaken, but had not performed. Finally, she yielded"], [39, "SISTER MARY 31 her consent, and was now glad that she had done so. She could see her daughter in her neighbourhood without un easiness or disquiet. He would be a bold man who would attempt any undue familiarity with this quiet, resolute worker in the cause of suffering humanity. But, indeed, Mrs. Neville was hardly just to these her surroundings. They were new to her. Her former position had unfitted her for sympathy with the humble classes of a country still strange to her. There was not a man of them all who would not have defended Florence Neville from a rude stare or an impertinent word. Not but this gladness of the mother had its drawbacks. Taste or inclination for hospital wrork she had certainly failed to acquire, and yet she strove hard to affect a virtue, if she did not possess it. Very pleasant to her, as now, was it to enjoy a spare hour of her daughter's society when her own day's toil was over, and when Florence had been relieved from some long watch. The young girl had plenty to talk about ; it seemed as if these silent watches had helped to accumulate stores of conversation, and naturally her new duties suggested subjects. Here came in the mother's heroism. She listened \u2014 she even asked questions. Whether she knew it or not, she had her reward. She began to learn ; she found there was very much trouble in the world beside her own. Nor did her reward end here. Gradually the young girl grew out of exclusive contemplation of her new duties \u2014 most people do in time. She stored up topics of other kinds instead. Her mother moved in a daily orbit. Florence went outside it, and saw many new faces, and encountered many new scenes. But, on this present evening, the habits of her early novitiate recurred with some force, and her mother had need of all her heroism. \" There was a poor policeman brought in, yesterday. We"], [40, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 32 are all very much interested in his case \u2014 especially Sister Mary. You know I promised to bring Sister Mary to see you, and I will \u2014 perhaps next time. But about this case \" \" Yes, Florence. I hope it is not very painful ? \" \" I won't tell you anything about that part of it, mamma. Of course, as to setting bones and all that kind of thing \" \" You are going to omit that, Florence ? \" \" Yes. I couldn't tell you much about that, even \u2014 even if you wished it.\" \"I wish to hear anything that interests you, Florence.\" \" Very well, mamma. Perhaps, when I come to be very much higher in my profession \u2014 as high as Sister Mary, you know \u2014 I may be present at \" \"Yes, dear; but now you're not.\" \" No ; the doctors do all that, first. Then we are called in to give them their medicines at the proper hours, and to keep a very strict record of their temperatures ; and, in fact, to make them as comfortable as circumstances will allow.\" \" What had happened to your policeman ? \" inquired Mrs. Neville, with some appearance of relief, but still resolutely. \" That was what I was going to tell you. There was a desperate encounter somewhere down in the country \u2014 these were country policemen \u2014 -constabulary, you know. One was killed outright. This one was sent up to Dublin, on the mere chance of there being still some life left in him.\" \"And there is?\" \" Oh, he 's alive \u2014 that is all that can be said. The doctors, themselves, are very doubtful about the case. I daresay I will be able to tell you something more definite when next I come to see you \u2014 that is, when we come to see you \u2014 I and Sister Mary.\" \" I wonder they get people to be policemen,\" said her mother, relieved for the time being."], [41, "SISTER MARY 33 \" You wondered why young girls became trained nurses, mamma.\" \" It used not to be in my time, Florrie. I suppose that is the reason.\" \" You got on with the Sarah Gamps and Betsy Prigs, and \u2014 accepted the situation. Fancy us both sitting here with this teapot between us ! \u2014 only, I believe, it was not tea that was in it. And then we 'd have to quarrel, you know, after \u2014 after the teapot was empty ! \" \" I hope we won't do that, dear. Besides, I 'm not a nurse at all \u2014 not even a Gamp or a Prig.\" \" Then we won't quarrel \u2014 it would be quite out of character. But admit it's all for the better, mamma.\" Her mother sighed. She was slow to believe that the world was improving \u2014 it had not been her experience. \" They that have it so, ought to say so. I hope you will find your poor policeman to improve.\" As regards Sister Mary, Florence kept her promise. When next she visited her mother, she came accompanied by her for the first time. Following up the whim of the younger of the two, they called each other Sarah and Betsy ; but the conversation no further infringed on professional duties and experiences, nor was Mrs. Neville called upon to affect an interest which would be all the harder in the case of a stranger. On the contrary, Florence strenuously made effort to provide more enlivening themes. \" Mamma, you must be ' poor dear Mrs. Harris ' for the occasion.\" \" But, my dear, Mrs. Harris was a myth ; and, if my recollection is not gone altogether, I believe your Betsy Prig was a married woman.\" \" So she was, mamma.\" Florence laughed ; but even her c"], [42, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 34 laugh betrayed some sense of dissatisfaction with the turn her liveliness had taken. As for poor Betsy, she hung her head, and looked embarrassed. \"What have I said?\" continued Mrs. Neville, who had observed a quick glance of intelligence pass between her two visitors. \" No, mamma, it was all my fault. I did intend to tell you. Sister Mary herself asked me to do so. Out with it now, Betsy, as we are here. Mamma will love you all the more when she knows.\" \" Alas ! Mrs. Neville, the ' out ' is soon told,\" said the apparent culprit. \" I have been married \u2014 am married still ; though, to the rest of the world, my husband is dead.\" It was now the mother's turn to look her dissatisfaction ; for, in spite of her daughter's appeal, and the saddened tones of her visitor, there was such a feeling in Mrs. Neville's mind. \" Wait till you hear, mamma,\" interposed Florence. Without further preface the visitor proceeded. \" My husband became involved in those terrible proceedings going on in the country. I will say nothing in his defence, unless it be that he was foolish \u2014 a poor excuse for the wreck of all our happiness. I was always opposed to the hateful and mercenary movement \u2014 mercenary as far as all but the poor dupes, like my husband, are concerned. I always disliked and dreaded it \u2014 now, I need hardly tell you my feelings are .\" In spite of her desire to explain, the visitor here collapsed. But that was plainly the result of overwrought senses. Mrs. Neville was visibly mollified \u2014 nay, she experienced her own feelings wrought upon too. Still \u2014 possibly to the disappointment of her daughter \u2014 she allowed the explanation to proceed to a completion without other form of encourage ment. Sister Mary proceeded."], [43, "SISTER MARY 35 \" There was no doubt of my husband's complicity \u2014 he attempted no denial himself. A defence was made for him ; money \u2014 the money of other dupes \u2014 was plentiful enough in those days ; and those who were really answerable for his position played with it as they played with hearts and homes \u2014 everything to minister to their own vanity, as well as a hope of eventual power, which could have its origin only in vanity too. He was condemned, and sentenced to imprisonment for life.\" Naturally, the visitor again paused. Mrs. Neville would now have interposed some words of sympathy \u2014 of comfort, as far as words could express such object ; but Florence's companion evidently did not yet consider her explanation sufficiently absolving. \" I was young \u2014 I was more unwilling than ever to be a burden on any one. I applied for employment, telling who and what I was. I am enrolled as hospital nurse under the name of Mrs. Mary Morris, my true and married name. It appeared to me \u2014 and I consulted our authorities on the subject \u2014 that in a public institution, depending for support on loyal and law-abiding people, it might not be well for me to bear more openly than I could help a name so un fortunately known. Wherefore, among patients, and among those associated in work with me, I answer to the name of Sister Mary. When coming here, Mrs. Neville, I was really under the impression that my troubles and misfortunes had preceded me.\" The reprimand, if so meant, was said in all gentleness and tenderness. In fact, Sister Mary herself was now dissolved in tears \u2014 and they were tears of softness. She had come to forgive all \u2014 always excepting the actual \"leaders of the movement \" ; against them her feelings increased in intensity."], [44, "36 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" Yes, Mrs. Morris, Florence should have told me.\" Mrs. Neville did not speak unkindly either, but the words themselves she considered a sense of propriety demanded. \"Certainly, mamma, I fully intended to do so. Then I commenced that ridiculous nonsense of calling myself 'Sarah Gamp,' and Sister Mary 'Betsy Prig,' and it all went out of my head.\" There was no more said on the subject of Florence's omis sion. A young and wholesome mind would hardly see the impropriety of concealment of a true position in life, so explainable and explained. A married woman ought to see it under all possible forms. Mrs. Morris had seen it, and had hastened to give her explanation, and Florence's mother was satisfied. She expressed this satisfaction sufficiently and unmistakably by calling her daughter's companion \" Sister Mary \" during the rest of that evening's visit, and Florence herself had no more recourse to her \" ridiculous nonsense \" of inventing, or bor rowing, a further vocabulary of names. And on all succeeding visits this hapless and innocent victim of a movement, whose baseness and hollowness had so thoroughly impressed itself upon her, continued to pass as Sister Mary. Florence, notwithstanding her true estate in life, had hazarded a shrewd and correct surmise. Her mother did come to love and trust Sister Mary all the more for that which she had heard from her. There grew up an affection and sympathy between the two married women. Marriage is a singular step in life, more especially to women. A woman may love one of her own sex, as Mrs. Neville loved her child, and as Sister Mary loved her friend. But can there be sympathy between women of different conditions ? We think they will all say, No."], [45, "CHAPTER IV. ARTHUR OGLEBY. MOUNT OGLEBY, where the wounded Macnab had found shelter and care untd arrangements for his removal to Dublin had been completed, was the nearest country house to \u25a0that of the still vacant Ballinteer. In that it differed from it, having a resident owner in the person of Mr. Arthur Ogleby, whom we desire to place before our readers as he was in the flesh. This Master of the Mount, as he came to be called, had now advanced somewhat into middle life, even bearing himself habitually with a slight stoop. Nevertheless, among ordinary men his was the most prominent and commanding figure. Of flesh itself there was none to spare, or, rather, none super fluous ; yet the man always carried with him the idea of massiveness. His limbs, if long, were also large and shapely. It may be that he took an inner pride in the symmetry and comeliness of his legs ; though, outwardly, he was a standing protest against all such vanities. Thus his pleasure was to clothe those comely limbs in raiment which had seen not only good service but even bad. Above and beyond all things, he affected the sports of a country gentleman. So that, during its proper season, he was generally to be seen in a hunting-coat which had been scarlet, but which now exhibited those marks of wear, and"], [46, "38 THE TURN OF THE TIDE even tear. Spite of all, the garments would adhere gracefully to him. Naturally, the man was picturesque. His modes of life were simple \u2014 in some respects, even primi tive. To all creature -comforts he was honestly indifferent. On hunting mornings he rarely roused his womankind. His early meal consisted of such food as came most readily to hand. On that he was willing and able for a long and a hard day's ride. As regards literary attainments, he could pen a letter when absolute occasion for it arose. The sporting intelligence of the newspaper, or some burning question of politics, as it cropped up, was read to him by his wife or daughters at his request. Such was the full extent of his writing and his reading. The third R was even more circumscribed as to its limits. His accounts he kept to himself. They were always at sixes and sevens, and he himself was ashamed of them. In spite of much painstaking, the balance would appear on the wrong side of his ledger. To be plain and outspoken on this head, he was generally in trouble \u2014 generally helping other needy, though less simple, persons with his name \u2014 generally indebted for extrication to those who managed their own affairs with more success, and probably more skill. Amid all such difficulties and embarrassments, he had con tinued to keep around him a pack of hounds and a troop of humble adherents, to which, probably, was attributable that title of the Master, rather than to his possession of a country seat. If these adherents had been better acquainted with their callings, and had been in receipt of more regular remuneration for them, they should have come under the ordinary category of servants. But as neither of these con ditions was fulfilled, they are here classed under those modes"], [47, "ARTHUR OGLEBY 39 and institutions of more primitive life, to which a passing allusion has already been made. The owner of these belongings had married a Miss Warburton. Old Mr. Warburton had been neither a fox hunter, nor even a country gentleman. He had taken up the large commercial interests of his family, and they had continued to prosper in his hands. Mr. Warburton's had been the cheque-book which had generally come to the aid of Arthur Ogleby, whenever that gentleman's tot had turned up on the wrong side of his ledger. The Master of Mount Ogleby had made light of those humiliating occurrences \u2014 or affected to do so. \" The old man's money will be all Katty's in time ; none of us can take that away with us, you know.\" Katty was the present Mrs. Ogleby. Mr. Warburton himself had not treated the matter after this fashion. On the contrary, he spoke sadly of these re curring embarrassments, and expressed his fears as to what might happen, when be should undertake that final journey which had been thus hinted at. \" Katty will sell the bed from under her, if her husband tells her ; and what then is to become of these poor children?\" After that, old Mr. Warburton would become sdent, and those who studied his face thought they saw an expression of hardness settling there. Nevertheless, on the next occasion, he assisted his son-in-law out of his new trouble. The \"poor children\" here referred to were three in number, all girls. They were very children at the time these words had been spoken, and could hardly be expected to realise the coming misfortunes which their utterance implied. And, presently, there were no such utterances to be heard. Old Mr. Warburton had died. Since then, matters had"], [48, "40 THE TURN OF THE TIDE gone on without any special reference to a disastrous ending, or even without visible signs of its near approach. Whatever replies Arthur Ogleby gave to the needy and impecunious who sought his name \u2014 or, rather, his money, for that had been the end of it \u2014 certain it is that no one now ventured on a repetition of the request. Somehow, the man must have taken stock of himself, as the saying is. His best friend was gone. No appeals could again succeed in bringing that cheque-book into further requisition. To ignore such altered circumstances would be in excess of any of his past follies. He said nothing of all this ; did not even allude to old Mr. Warburton as his friend at all. But what is, perhaps, still more commendable, lie commenced a course of action which might be regarded as the outward expression of some such inward communings. Naturally, the change gave rise to a variety of conjectures, ultimately resolving themselves into two extreme opinions. \"See the magic of property!\" declared one such form of criticism. \" Ogleby is now wealthy, and also wise.\" Then there was the opposite comment. \" Poor fellow ! He is not the first man who commenced to lock the stable-door when the steed was stolen.\" To one practice only Arthur Ogleby was still true. He continued to keep his own accounts, and with them his own counsel. These girls had received a fair education. Much of this, if not all, was attributable to a mother's care and solicitude. Not but her husband, though himself no scholar, had an admiration, and even reverence, for learning where it existed ; the only doubt, if doubt there was, being his practical assist ance towards its attainment. Of the eldest, Sophia, it was currently reported that she had not only compassed the extreme round of female studies,"], [49, "ARTHUR OGLEBY 41 but had actually invaded man's dominions. Hence, it may have followed that, when suitors came wooing, they, or he \u2014 for there, was only one \u2014 did not dare to attack the sage and profound Sophia, but cast sheep's eyes on the second, Frances, instead. At least, Frances was now settled and done for \u2014 that is, if an alliance with the young curate of an adjoining parish merits such a description. As Sophia easily bore off the palm for scientific attainments, so some would have it that her sister, now Mrs. Potter, had taken unto herself the use and possession of more worldly wisdom. Nevertheless, if anyone deduced from it that Fanny Potter exceeded the limits of sail or wise dealing, he or she reached an unwarrantable conclusion. Naturally, she inherited a share, perhaps an undue one, of her mother's ability, and she did not neglect the gift. It was well, and even right, that she should have some regard to the loaves and fishes. She was now a wife and a mother. Of her husband, the Rev. Patrick Potter, it will be here sufficient to say that his spiritual duties, as he interpreted them, had entirely superseded all more material aspirations. He ate his meals when they were placed before him ; but it was apparent that he was not much troubled about the source from which they came. Now, in the matrimonial venture, it is desirable that thoughts of this nature should be entertained by husband or wife, if they cannot be shared by both. The youngest daughter of the house of Ogleby was now but seventeen, and had not developed, as yet, any such special qualities, or acquirements of mind, as had conferred individuality upon her sisters. But those who gave an ex pression to an opinion upon the subject freely committed themselves to the statement that Kate Ogleby was growing up the flower of the flock. Her father himself gave utterance"], [50, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 42 to no such sentiment. Daughters, and even sons, might come and might go, as it had been in the past, and as it would be in the future ; but the affairs of the chase could not be so left to themselves, without injury to humanity itself. So ran the professed sentiments of the man. But those who had already committed themselves to their opinions, further added that deep down in the heart of Arthur Ogleby, beneath ex pression, possibly beneath consciousness itself, was a tender admiration and reverence for this the latest offspring entrusted to his keeping. How, it may be enquired, had the neighbouring estate of Ballinteer been selected as a \"test case\" for its present severe isolation, when the impecunious establishment of Mount Ogleby was still allowed its field and domestic service, as has been briefly described? It was notorious that the Land League sought out those estates whose owners could least hold out against the rigour of the siege laid to them. Well, we might reply that the Land League was at present feeling its way, and, though daily growing in power, was still limited in the exercise of it. Especially had it to avoid any undue or unpopular strain on those under its command. To keep a somewhat irregular establishment, to follow field-sports, occasionally to outrun the constable \u2014 these were no very grievous charges in the eyes of an Irish peasantry. Those behind the scenes knew this, and made their selection ; and, presently, we will see that it was a wise one. Besides, it was a beginning, and, with success, all would be brought within the net."], [51, "CHAPTER V. MR. DARLEY WRITES. SO had remained matters at Mount Ogleby. So had they remained at Ballinteer, with the exception that its young owner had so far confirmed rumour as to come to see affairs for himself there, steadily declining the continuance of police pro tection. But, for the present, to return to the Mount. The second daughter of Arthur Ogleby had been settled and done for \u2014 had been so settled and done for, for a period of some years now. But it has to be added that there had been no other form of settlement, such as lawyers usually understand by that term ; and, saving the paternal blessing, Arthur Ogleby himself had \" done \" nothing, if any other performance had been ex pected of him. After their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Potter had taken up their residence in the town, or village, where the rev. gentle man's spiritual functions were now exercised, which we here take the liberty to call Ballyfair. The Protestant rector was old, and somewhat infirm. Hence the necessity for a curate. Thus, Mr. Potter had taken up his residence in the immediate vicinity of the church. The rectory itself was about two miles from the village. Thus, too, Mr. Potter had come by his wife. For Mount Ogleby had no church nearer than that at Ballyfair. We will"], [52, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 44 not say that any of these sheep's eyes had been cast during the hours of divine service, or even during the days set apart for such service. But it was also Mr. Potter's duty to visit those who attended church, and some hospitality had been shown to the young man. In fact, as clergyman, suitor, and even now as son-in-law, he continued a favourite at Mount Ogleby. It may be that Arthur Ogleby extended his asserted philosophy to marrying and giving in marriage. Certain it was that, after this break in the ordinary routine of affairs at Mount Ogleby, matters settled down again into their old and primitive fashion. The Master donned that coat, which was once red, twice, and even thrice a week. Knives and forks were laid for the new couple, when they came. But they came, and they went, just as if such movements had been coeval with Mount Ogleby itself. Of Mr. Potter himself, assertion may be made that he accepted the situation with apparent satisfaction. He, too, was averse to anything in the nature of \" a fuss \" ; though, probably, the two gentlemen might assign different reasons for the same frame of mind. If his expectations had gone further, certainly he had given no expression to them. Nor was there likelihood that more enlarged views would eventually suggest themselves to him. There are men who require their mental, as well as bodily, pabulum to be placed before them \u2014 thrust under their noses as it were, before they can be got to take it. In fact, presumably, as we now introduce the reader to this young .Mrs. Potter, she is being engaged in the task of pre paring that gentleman for the acquisition of some such mental sustenance. She is alone, and has been seated for some time with an open letter in her hand, to the contents of which she has more than once referred, presumably pending the return of her husband."], [53, "MR. DARLEY WRITES 45 But Mr. Potter, on his reappearance from his pastoral round, now proceeds to turn to his books and his writing materials, with the air of a person who also has some pre-occupation of thought. Under the circumstances, Mrs. Potter must have considered that the mental food employed should be of a strong order \u2014 in fact, stimulating. For her opening words were sufficiently startling. \" You recollect our engagement ? I want to ask you some questions about it.\" \" Our marriage engagement, Fanny ! My dear, it is not so very long ago \u2014 and I think your memory on the sub ject \" \" Is as good as yours. So it is. Only, it isn't inspired, dear. There now, don't look shocked. You asked papa \u2014 for me. I want to know quite what he said \u2014 I mean his exact words.\" \" In reply ? \u2014 when I put the \u2014 the question to him ? Well, I don't know that I can tell you \u2014 exactly. I think I must have been a little confused. I do recollect he expressed surprise ; which, perhaps, confused me more ; though, on reflection, I believe that is the proper and correct thing to do under the circumstances.\" \"Well?\" said Mrs. Potter, checking any tendency towards digression. \" Oh ! I can only recollect words here and there. I know he said he had always regarded me as a decent sort of fellow. I am sure he said that \u2014 otherwise I do not know how I could have arrived at the phrase.\" \" Dear, do put your books aside and come to the real point with me. I don't want to know what papa said of you \u2014 or of me, if he said anything. You can skip all that, and anything"], [54, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 46 more about 'putting the question,' as you call it. But you always said there was some reference to grandpapa's money on the occasion. You arrived at that, too?\" \" Yes, certainly \u2014 that is so. He said, ' Fanny comes in for her share of old Warburton's money.' I didn't put that question to him, you know ; and you '11 excuse me giving the precise words, as you ask them.\" \" Certainly, dear ; and I haven't ' come in ' \u2014 you know that, too ?\" \"No \u2014 I did not take your father's words in that literal sense. I am not sure I took them in any sense, just at the time. It appeared to me that he was getting angry, and \u2014 and the situation was awkward enough without that. However, I shouldn't say now that that was what he intended ; I mean that you should ' come in ' right off, you know. Suppose he wished me to understand that such provision was already made for you, and, of course, for your sisters too. Ought not the money to be your mother's first ? I believe she was Mr. Warburton's only child ?\" \"Yes ; mamma always said so.\" \"Very well. Don't you think, then, that was what your father really meant?\" \" That mamma should first have the money ? Perhaps I might, only \" Mrs. Potter had been endeavouring, cheerfully and pleasantly, to lead her husband up to the situation, whatever it was. But, plainly, a difficulty \u2014 an embarrassment arose here. It was now Mrs. Potter's turn to exhibit hesitation. Even Mr. Potter himself could see that. \"Well, Fanny?\" he said. \" It is not easy, dear, to explain ; and, perhaps, there are some things which need not now be explained \u2014 but for a"], [55, "MR. DARLEY WRITES 47 reason.\" And, saying this, Mrs. Potter's glance mechanically turned to the note which she still held in her hand. \" Don't explain anything more than is necessary,\" said Mr. Potter, good-naturedly enough ; but his glance turned to his books and papers. \"There is nothing new \u2014 only it is not quite pleasant to have to say some things. Of course, you know that papa has not been very wise in the past \u2014 everybody knows that.\" \"A little extravagant, you mean. Yes, I know that.\" \"Not extravagant, perhaps, in the ordinary sense. I don't think he ever spent much on himself. Of course, keeping a pack of hounds might be so accounted, when \u2014 when there were other sources of embarrassment.\" \" Helping people who hardly deserved it. That is what I heard.\" \" Yes. I suppose the people promised to pay back the help ; and I suppose papa believed they would. I am sure he would have got on very well, but for that.\" \" And, now, he does get on, Fanny \u2014 doesn't he ? Who knows but your grandfather left nothing at all behind him ? \u2014 and your father merely gained \u2014 wisdom ; of course I mean in its worldly sense. How does that theory agree with your difficulties ?\" \" I was going to explain. You will see, now, it is rather a delicate \u2014 hardly a becoming subject for me to deal with. Well, I heard grandpapa himself say something which is hardly compatible with your \u2014 theory, as you call it.\" Mr. Potter's curiosity was certainly aroused \u2014 so far his young wife had succeeded. In fact, he was now beginning to repress any outward exhibition of this feeling, and to nicely balance himself between a polite attention and an obtrusive inquisitiveness, merely throwing in the suggestion, \" That was before we met, Fanny ? \""], [56, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 48 \"Yes, I was very young then. Mamma was crying; I think grandpapa was crying too, or almost so. They did not mind me\u2014 I was quite a child. But you will see that the circumstance might impress itself upon a young person.\" Mrs. Potter still struggled to be light and cheery\u2014 in fact, to be loyal to husband and to family. Nevertheless, \"a theory\" had to be disproved. Mr. Potter tried hard to pursue the equilibrium he would maintain; but, nothing further appropriate to it in speech occurring to him, he held his peace. \" Well, grandpapa said \u2014 ' I cannot trust you or your husband with this money.' Mamma was greatly pained, she wrung her hands, and said, 'Poor Arthur, he will be so hurt ! ' That was papa.\" There was a tear in Mrs. Potter's eye as she spoke ; but the young clergyman found means to answer it. \"But that has all passed away? I heard it quite as an old story that your father used to get into trouble through \u2014 through this good nature of his.\" \" I am not sure that papa is quite cured, yet. And I di i recollect that grandpapa made use of a harder word than good nature.\" \"But your grandfather wanted to cure him. You admit that he is better now ? \" \"Yes. But that is not the whole change. You km>w papa's ways. With him, everyone is a blackguard who does not conform to his manner of thinking and doing. Well, poor grandpapa is now sometimes an old blackguard.\" \" Oh ! oh ! \" said the Rev. Mr. Potter. But the young husband did indeed understand the ways of his father-in-law. \" Yes, I daresay you have heard him,\" said Mrs. Potter, who was now divided between a laugh and a cry over the domestic"], [57, "MR. DARLEY WRITES 49 situation, as so far explained. Eventually the laugh got tha better in the contest, and she proceeded, \" Well, I won't say anything more about the unpleasantness of having to tell you all this. I had to do so now, because, this morning, while you were out, there came a letter from Mr. Darley.\" Mr. Darley was the family solicitor, and lived in town. He had acted for old Mr. Warburton, and now acted for his daughter and son-in-law. \"A letter from Mr. Darley ! \" The rev. gentleman certainly lost his assumed equilibrium this time, and openly displayed surprise, if not inquiry. \" Yes \u2014 to me. It is marked ' private.' But that is not at all the reason I did not show it to you, at once. I suppose Mr. Darley did not mean I should not show it to you ; that is merely legal form \u2014 lawyers are so very cautious, you know ; besides, whatever he intended, a wife is understood to hand all communications to her husband. No, the real reason is \u2014 grandpapa's name has been so rarely mentioned of late at the Mount, it was necessary for me to \u2014 to make this explanation first.\" After that, Mrs. Potter placed Mr. Darley's note in the hand of her husband. The note itself was very short. In fact, omitting the ordinary, and friendly, beginning and ending, and that intimation of privacy, it contained only the words \u2014 \" If you should happen to be in town any day next week, I should take it as a favour if you would give me a call.\" \" There is nothing here about \u2014 about what we have been speaking,\" said Mr. Potter. \"No. That is why I had to give you so much of \u2014 of the family history.

I have been thinking all the morning, and can arrive at no other conjec ture.\" \" Very well, let us suppose so, for the present at least. You rejected my theory. I accept yours \u2014 provisionally, as I suppose Mr. Darley would say. Then, as to the delicacy of it ; yes, I can see that,\" said Mr. Potter, after some reflection. \" Not, of course, that there 's anything in it,\" he added \u2014 \" anything that cannot be explained satisfactorily. Only it 's embarrassing. However, there is no doubt you had to tell me.\" \" That 's just it, Patrick dear. I know you would not like to hear anything that required an explanation without getting the explanation itself.\" \" As far as you are able to give it, Fanny,\" added Mr. Potter, quite recovering his pleasantness. \"Just so. It may be that Mr. Darley will be able to tell us more ; and, as you say- \u2014 which is very kind of you- \u2014 every thing will then be quite satisfactory. We are to see Mr. Darley, then ? \" \" You and I ? I suppose so. The sooner the better.\" \" Yes, Patrick, I see that.

By-the-bye, I wish you would look over this letter I have just written to Boyd. It will appear in the Meath Medley on Saturday.\" \" It reads very well,\" said the dutiful wife. \" I think so,\" said Mr. Potter. \" If I am not too hard on poor Boyd?\" \" The letter is certainly a strong one,\" added Mrs. Potter. \" I couldn't help that, you know,\" said the writer. \" Not that I blame Boyd altogether. The Bishop himself is sus pected of a leaning that way. I had that in my mind when writing the letter.\" \"Do you think that quite \u2014 judicious, dear?\" \"Hem! \u2014 judicious? Of course there are other matters to be considered besides what might be thought merely judicious.\" \" I have no doubt you are right. Let us hope the Bishop will take that view, too.\""], [60, ""], [61, "CHAPTER VI. MRS. POTTER GOES TO THE MOUNT. ON Saturday, that letter of the Rev. Mr. Potter, on \" Infant Immersion,\" did indeed appear in the Medley. If Mr. Boyd felt his position, he concealed it admirably. For he was reported as having preached, calmly and temperately, on quite a different subject in his own church, about ten miles distant, on the following day. On that day \u2014 Sunday \u2014 Mrs. Ogleby and her two unmarried daughters came in to church to Ballyfair. Old Mr. Stackpoole, the rector, took part in the service, as was his custom. He was still quite competent for that, though it was understood that Mr. Potter took upon himself the purely pastoral work of the parish. \" I saw your husband in print, yesterday, Mrs. Potter,\" said the old rector. \" You ought to persuade him to have some compassion on poor Boyd.\" \" Mr. Boyd will get over it, I suppose. \" He '11 get over it, will he ?

Flanagan has been at it again, this morning.\" Father Flanagan was curate of the chapel, which stood at the other end of the village. He was a young man, and made no disguise of his fierce Nationalistic views. \"At it again !\" \" Yes. As I passed the chapel grounds, coming here, I saw nothing but black looks and folded arms. We know what that means. Thank goodness ! the chapel grounds will be empty on my return.\" Then Mr. Stackpoole was helped to mount his car, and was carried home."], [63, "MRS. POTTER GOES TO THE MOUNT 55 The conversation had occurred immediately after service, and Mrs. Potter had not yet had an opportunity of speaking to her relatives from the Mount. \" I could not come sooner to you, mamma,\" she said, as she now made her way, through the dissolving congregation, to her mother and sisters. \" You know I have to say a word to Mr. Stackpoole. We have been so fortunate to come under so kind and considerate a rector.

Well, on ordinary Sundays, when Mr. Stackpoole passes, all the women curtsey, and all the men touch their hats ; but on special occasions, like this morning, they are all unmoved statues. They have been listening to some fiery harangue on the Penal Laws, or the Cromwellian Wars, as if that would make things better now.\" \" Why does Father Doyle allow it? He is sober enough.\" Father Doyle was the parish priest of the Roman Catholic division, of which Ballyfair and its chapel formed only a corner. \"He is an old man \u2014 nearly as old as Mr. Stackpoole, and lives a good way off.\" \" But surely he must hear of these tirades ? \" \" Very likely he does.

Her sisters had hurried on to \"see the children.\" She could not help calling to mind that suggestion \u2022 of her husband of a delicacy \u2014 an embarrassment. He had given no further explanation ; she had asked for none, but she knew what was meant. Hitherto, all had been frankness itself between him and the occupants of Mount Ogleby. Now, Mr. Darley's note implied \u2014 put upon him, a secrecy. That was undesirable enough. But might not the note lead to \u2014 might not the very explanation which she herself had"], [65, "MRS. POTTER GOES TO THE MOUNT 57 ventured on, lead to still more unpleasant relations? Was it possible to ascertain more precisely the nature of the ground on which they were invited to tread ? Suppose she sounded her mother? \" I was thinking of going over to Mount Ogleby, to-morrow.\" \"Yes \u2014 you and Patrick both come.\" Ever since the young man's engagement, he had been accepted as \" Patrick \" by the whole family. \"I know Patrick \u2014 cannot.\" \" Well, come yourself. Is there anything wrong, Fanny ? \" \" I will speak to you to-morrow.\" Then they had reached the residence of Mr. Patrick Potter, and they ceased to be alone. In the meantime, the Master of Mount Ogleby had not found it incumbent on him to souse anyone. There had been a gathering, large and even ugly-looking. That is to say, the prospects threatened, though the young men composing the gathering itself would be called in Ireland, and quite correctly, \"clane and dacent boys.\" They came to assert certain sup posed or imagined rights, and their demeanour gave sufficient indication of this. But Arthur Ogleby spoke to them temperately, and even with good humour. He told them that a hunt \u2014 a real hunt \u2014 was to be held on these grounds early on the following morning, and that he, Arthur Ogleby, would be brought to humiliation and shame if he could not find a fox for the gentlemen who were thus to put their trust in him. Then the gathering had betaken itself elsewhere. The \" boys \" who composed it were not under the spiritual guidance of Father Flanagan. They formed a portion of the flock of an old priest of an old school, who found"], [66, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 58 something else to do besides the persistent rubbing of old sores. Monday's hunt was held, and a fox was found. Fox, hounds, and horsemen were many miles away before Mrs. Potter reached Mount Ogleby on that day. \"What is it, Fanny?\" I don't know whether Mrs. Ogleby had made any pretext for sending her two unmarried daughters out of the way, but out of the way they were. \" I saw your uneasiness yesterday.\" \" No, mamma \u2014 not quite that. Only thinking, you know \" \" Of ways and means ? \" \"Well, I suppose so. Thoughts do go very much in that direction, I find.

However, her mother's statement merely drew a mild protest from Mrs. Potter. \"Even Patrick is not quite perfect, mamma. Perhaps we could all afford to be wiser. At any rate, there is no special pressure on that head at present, if you had any concern that way.\""], [67, "MRS.

Nevertheless, her daughter's last words had effected some change, as exhibited in that very formality with which she had just associated another person.

Still, Mrs. Potter tried again. \"Well, so much for Mr. Darley at present. Now, for the sounding, mamma. What is it all about ? \" \" Law is so very dangerous,\" repeated Mrs. Ogleby. \" I hope it is not about law.\" \" But I am not going to law with anyone, nor is anyone going to law with me, that I am aware of.

Well, of course, there was Mr. Toff.\" \" He's not one of your gentlemen, Kate ! \" \"Why not? It is true he's a tailor from Dublin, and once made papa's hunting clothes \u2014 a long time ago, I am sorry to say. But he 's very polite, and pays me all the attentions of the hunting-field.\" \" Mere shop. He wants you to get him another order.\" \" From papa ? I wish to goodness I could ! Oh, yes \u2014 he makes no disguise about that ; only he puts it on much higher principles than mere 'shop,' as you call it.

That is the way Mr. Toff puts it.\" \" Unfortunately, that is too true\u2014 I mean the rarity of the 'chance,' at least in papa's case. But what does he mean by 'classical'?\" \"The man is quite correct,\" interposed the eldest Miss Ogleby. \" Our grandfathers and grandmothers used the word as equivalent to excellent, high in rank, worthy of being classed. Perhaps, in Mr. Toff's estimation, words should not wear out like garments.\" \" Oh ! \" said Mrs. Potter ; \" Sophy, couldn't you get an order for the poor man?

Of course, I must go.\" \" I don't know whether I shall, yet,\" remarked the eldest Miss Ogleby. \" However, it will be time enough to say so when I'm asked.\" \" Oh, you 're all sure to be asked. The Kildare Hunt is stopped \u2014 so is the Meath. These officers must now trust for their ' sport ' to one or two private gentlemen like papa, who still manage to keep up a shred of popularity and a few couples of hounds.\" Thus rattled Mrs. Potter, the young clergyman's wife, no doubt to the admiration of her mother, but possibly to the surprise of her two sisters, old and young. \" Upon my word, Fanny,\" remarked the younger, infected by the tone of conversation \u2014 \"your politeness is far behind that of Mr. Toff. I am to be asked to a ball because my father shows 'sport' to the gentlemen !\" \" Just so, Kate. It 's the way of the world. When you get there you can take your revenge out of them.

THE END OF THE HUNT. THE short winter's day was about to close ere Mrs. Potter left Mount Ogleby on her return to Ballyfair, and still more wintry elements threatened their approach. Some pressure had been brought to bear on the lady to make the Mount her abode for the night, in the face of these threats. \" Of course, Patrick will know where you are,\" urged her sisters. But she had pleaded \" the children,\" and no further pressure was used. As a compromise, her two sisters accom panied her half-way ; and all had returned to their respective dwellings before night had set in ; before the coming storm had made itself felt ; before the close of the hunt had sent its dispersing members to their respective homes. \" It is all settled,\" said Mrs. Potter to her husband. \" We can go to Dublin, and do whatever we think best.\" \" What is all settled ? \" \" Oh, dear ! must I go over the whole thing again ! \" said the young wife. \" No ; I recollect all about it, now. I find I have Thursday down on my list for \u2014 for that purpose.\" \" Very well ; don't make any other engagement for Thursday,\" said Mrs. Potter. In the meantime, the hunt had come to an end. It had been a pretty long run, or, rather, a succession of runs. The E"], [74, "66 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Mount Ogleby fox had led them far ahead, and had thus managed to escape by the skin of his teeth, as it were. Either the earth-stoppers had committed an oversight, or the marauders of yesterday had uncovered some of their work. Arthur Ogleby's reputation for \" finding sport\" was trembling in the balance, when a solitary hound took up the cry, and the set features of the Master relaxed \u2014 \" Gentle men, we are off again \u2014 you may depend upon the dog.\" The dog was certainly right this time, and a new and fresh fox burst from his concealment, before the members of the party could get their horses well in hand. Thus, the day was very far spent indeed before \" the hunt \" finally dispersed. Among those who so dispersed was the young Mr. Annesley whom we have already heard referred to. Some of the gentle men separated in twos and threes ; there was even a party of six, all told, who kept each other close company. But the youthful owner of Ballinteer was quite alone, as he faced the night Probably, the circumstance attracted the notice of the Master of the hounds, for he said, not unkindly, \" You 've a lonely bit of road before you, Annesley.\" \" It's only a bit, and I am getting used to loneliness.\" \"Confound it, man \u2014 why don't you come over to us? You know me \u2014 -I can't stand ceremony.\" \" I don't know you as well as I ought to know my father's friend. I'll go over to Mount Ogleby some day \u2014 soon.\" Then, the two men took their opposite courses. It was only a bit, as the younger man had said. Had the last fox held on for a mile or so further, he would have entered the grounds of Ballinteer House. There was hardly light to distinguish the building itself, as its owner approached it. Within, the house was in darkness. The doors were heavily guarded by bolt and bar, too. For, as Charles Annesley"], [75, "THE END OF THE HUNT 67 knocked with his riding-whip at the back of the structure, the noise of withdrawing bolts was sufficiently audible from outside. \"You are late, Masther,\" said the man who had performed these operations, as he now threw open the door. \" I would have been much later, only that the fox con siderately headed this way. I think, if we hadn't run him down, we would have had hounds and horsemen in the lawn itself.\" \" It wouldn't be the first time,\" said this domestic, who did not appear like a domestic. \" No, Larry, not by long chalks ! However, thereby hangs a tale.\" Larry appeared to think that any reply to this remark, even if meant for his hearing and consideration, might lead him out of his depths. For he preceded his master in silence through some passages and rooms, finally reaching an out-of-the-way, though large apartment. Here a light was struck, and Charles Annesley divested himself of his hunting cap and coat. The only cheerful feature of the room was a good turf fire. However, a portion of the long dining-table was covered with a cloth, and a plate, knife and fork were also suggestive of some further cheer. \"I didn't get ready your dinner till I heard you comin'. Thrue for you, if the hunt headed the other way you wouldn't be here for the next two hours.\" \"Look to the horse first, Larry. Have we anything for dinner ?\" \" Have we anything for dinner ! Lord, Masther, isn't there a sheep killed, and hangin' up below ?\" \" I forgot. We must be always prepared for a siege, if it comes. My poor Larry, you have a lonely time of it here.\""], [76, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 68 \"Begorra! I'd rather have the loneliness than the visit you 're talkin' of. Sure, it 's larnin' indoor work I am. If you don't complain, I don't.\" \" I would be a brute if I did \u2014 and there 's no use in telling you to leave me.\" \"Divil a use \u2014 I'm in for it now.

There 's that horse \u2014 he 's in his stable now \u2014 and, only he can't take the saddle and bridle off himself, it 's made up for the night he 'd be ! \" Charles Annesley smiled at the well-meant absurdities of the faithful Larry. But, as the man left the room, the smile faded away. He drew a chair toward the fire, and turned his face to the glowing embers, while his mind wandered in other directions. \" Ay \u2014 thereby hangs a tale ! Hounds and horses \u2014 costly mansions and riotous living \u2014 present extravagance and future incumbrance. Of a truth, the fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the children are set on edge. Am I wise when I resent the fate which has overtaken me ? I would suspend a law which is as inexorable as it is universal. And yet, it was not our forefathers who did all this wickedness for us. They turned use into abuse \u2014 perhaps ; so runs the charge against them. But nature was sufficiently bountiful still. If they devoured the kernels, they left the husks. Then comes this merciless fanaticism, which says, ' Give up the husks, too. Depart \u2014 homeless and helpless.' I might obey \u2014 perhaps I ought ; but no \u2014 not on compulsion. Bah !

More cruel, more selfish, more destructive than our fathers' loins is the little finger of this unwritten law of the land \u2014 this juggernaut, before which the people bow, and are crushed.\" Thus ran the train of the young man's thoughts. Without, the night had completely closed in. The threatened storm, too, began to make itself heard. Still, Charles Annesley sat unheeding. Larry returned to 'the room, and set about some final preparations for his master's meal. \" I '11 have the dinner up, Masther Charles, in two twos. The horse is comfortable for the night. Queen of Heaven ! what's that?\" added the man, as a plate, falling from his hands, attested the extremity of his surprise and dismay. Unmistakably a loud knocking, from without, was heard above the gathering storm. In a moment the master of the house was equally on the alert, and stretched out his hand to the gun, which stood beside him in a corner of the room. \" Sure, I might have known it would come, sooner or later,\" muttered Larry to himself. \" I didn't so much care if I had the dinner over ; but to be sent out of the world this way, fasting ! \" Here the knocking was repeated ; and whether more loudly, or that the ears of the two inmates of the house were more attentive, the direction from whence it came was now traceable. \" It 's at the front door,\" said Annesley. \" That will take something more than knocking to open. See if you can manage a peep in front, while I get ready the arms.\" Larry obeyed, and presently returned to the room. \"The lawn's full up of them \u2014 horsemen, some in their saddles, more standing behind their horses. \""], [78, "70 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" Horsemen, do you say ? Moonlighters don't usually attack houses on horseback ; neither do the cowards expose them selves to fire. I '11 look for myself.\" As the front rooms were in complete darkness from within, there was neither difficulty nor danger in looking out, though the snow, which had now commenced to fall, somewhat ob scured the prospect. A group of horsemen certainly was distinguishable close in front of the house. But Charles Annesley looked in vain for any similar appearance further off, and was inclined to attribute Larry's more general descrip tion to a stretch of the imagination. \" I '11 give them the benefit of the doubt, and go to the door, Larry,\" said the young man. \" Masther, dear, let me go before. Sure, I 've made up my mind to it long ago.\" \"Nonsense, man,\" said Annesley in a tone of command. \" Stand back. There is no bodily hurt intended to me ; you know that.\" Yielding to the mandate, Larry retired behind, and the master proceeded to undo the bolts. A single and rather submissive-looking figure stood before the open door ; the rest of the group remained some yards distant. Probably the loud, and almost angry, tone of the master had been audible outside, and had been productive of a somewhat similar effect to that on Larry. \" A thousand pardons ! Can anyone tell us which is the road to Newbridge, or \u2014 or where accommodation could be got for the night ? \" \" The road to Newbridge ! \" interrupted the irrepressible Larry. \"Sure, they're ten good miles from it, as the crow flies ; and they 're off the main road, too.\" \"Hold your tongue, Larry,\" again commanded the master."], [79, "THE END OF THE HUNT 71 Then, to his interrogator \u2014 \"You have heard my man, and he is indeed correct.\" \" Unfortunately, we cannot fly,\" resumed the stranger ; \"and, further, we are very cold, very wet, and awfully hungry.\" On the first opening of the door, Charles Annesley had seen little save the falling snow, and some dim and indistinct figures. Presently, objects became more clear, and the figures themselves appeared not wholly unfamiliar to him. \" Were you not at the hunt to-day ? \" he inquired. \" We were. So were you, if I mistake not. We belong to the Curragh \u2014 we are utter strangers in these parts. We asked our way, and attempted to follow it religiously. But, whether from the falling snow, or our own stupidity, the result is that we are \u2014 here.\" \"How many of you are there?\" \" Some half-dozen, all told, I regret to say.\" \" Oh, numbers don't matter. The house is large, and prac tically empty ; so are the stables, too. We have any amount of accommodation \u2014 of what sort it is I will leave to your selves to form an opinion. My man will see to your horses.\" With considerable alacrity, the belated travellers proceeded to avail themselves of the invitation, expressed or understood, the owner going before them to the room he had previously occupied, which was, indeed, the dining-room of Ballinteer House in more prosperous days. Whatever might be the natural curiosity of the guests, the glowing fire was regarded with considerable satisfaction. \" Ah ! \" said the more elderly-looking of the men, who had hitherto taken the precedence, and was the only spokesman up to the present moment\u2014\" you have some good things in Ireland ; your turf fires, now \u2014 and then, your whiskey.\""], [80, "72 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \"Some devilish bad things, too,\" was the reply of the owner. \" Of them we '11 say nothing, now. Yes, I can give you some whiskey ; it 's about the best thing you can take before \u2014 before we inquire into the state of the larder.\" So saying, Charles Annesley placed some tumblers on the table, and a jar, from which he proceeded to extract the cork. \"I don't know what scruples you gentlemen \u2014 all English, I presume \u2014 may have. But I wdl not vouch for the fact that this whiskey has paid the proper dues. Not to put too fine a point upon it, it 's Irish poteen \u2014 and never saw a gauger. A man under my circumstances has to take what he can get.\" \" For my own part,\" said the previous spokesman, who had already poured some portion of the element under debate into his tumbler \u2014 \" I think it fair to give the thing a trial.\" \" So say all of us,\" proclaimed the rest of the party, as they gathered round the table. \" Well,\" exclaimed the young owner, \" that little difficulty being got over, we had best proceed in order. Now comes the dinner question. On so critical a subject perhaps, gentlemen, your indulgence would further extend itself to allowing my chief, and in fact only, assistant to join the consultation. He informs me there is a whole sheep on the premises. Bis dat (jui cito dat ; or, as your immortal bard expresses it \u2014 ' When 't were done, 't were well it were done quickly.'

Be the same token, the man that left the poteen \u2014 we can't always mention names \u2014 ought to get credit for the same,\" said the returned Larry, in a very audible whisper, to his master. \"It is indeed, gentlemen, as you hear,\" explained Charles Annesley. \" In these parts, we have returned to the primitive"], [81, "THE END OF THE HUNT 73 fashion of paying in kind \u2014 -and, as you may further infer, our left hand is not allowed to know what our right hand does.\" \" Well, gentlemen,\" proceeded the former spokesman of the party, addressing his comrades, \"you have heard the practical and appetising remarks of our worthy host. Those who are of that opinion will say \u2014 What is it, Helmsley?\" inquired the speaker, as a member of the party was seen to hold up his hand. \"Might I add,\" said the gentleman so addressed, \"in reference to the observations we have heard from \u2014 -from \" \"Larry, Captain,\" submitted the owner of the name. \" Yes, from this Mr. Larry.

Now, Larry, look alive.\" \"Do, Larry. And carry with you the reflection that the hopes of half-a-dozen starving men go with you.\" \" In the meantime,\" suggested the previous spokesman, whom his party had now addressed as Colonel Cheviot, \" couldn't we do something for ourselves in the way of helping? With Mr. Larry's permission, and if he won't laugh, I think I could ' lay the table.' \" \" Quilter, here, has a diploma from Edinburgh for surgery \u2014 couldn't he help ? \" \"Of course he could \u2014 the very thing.

It's a"], [82, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 74 splendid opportunity for enlarging your views on comparative anatomy.\" In due time the meal was served, and, after its despatch, the company sat over their whiskey and water. \"Well, gentlemen,\" said the Colonel, \"as you have been eating your mutton, and imbibing this admirable beverage, I don't know whether you have all felt sufficiently grateful to our friend Gatesby.\" \" Gatesby ! How 's that ? \" uttered a chorus of voices, while their owners looked inquiringly at the young gentleman named, who could only look his own surprise. \" Why, for being here at all ! The way of it was this. On question as to our return to quarters, we were told to follow the road for some miles- \u2014 Irish miles, decidedly \u2014 until we came to the first turn. Now, the first turn I observed was a certain cross-road. I said our instructions were to go to the right. Somebody\u2014 Clifford, I think \u2014 maintained that his recollection was \u2014 to the left. Gatesby \u2014 who appears to forget the circum stance \u2014 said he thought he saw, through the falling snow, the distant outline of some large pile of building. Only for Gatesby, gentlemen \u2014 realise the situation for yourselves ! Gatesby, we are about to drink your health.\" \"Sort of a character \u2014 that master of the hounds?\" said the gentleman previously addressed as Helmsley7, who now sat opposite to the owner of the house, and thus directed his conversation to him. \" Mr. Ogleby ?

One feels inclined to classify him with the heroes of the past. It may be his figure.\" \" I don't know so much about him as I ought. I hardly think it is quite that. Even among ourselves we do look upon him as a character, as you have just expressed it. Perhaps, to those who know him more, that has worn away.\" \" Fine girl, that of his, who saw the hounds off. On ac quaintance, I don't think that impression would wear away ! \" Hitherto, Charles Annesley had made his responses with a courtesy becoming his position as host and entertainer. Possibly there was a slight alteration in his tone as he now replied to this last question of the handsome young Englishman. \"There were two of them.\" \"Yes \u2014 both his daughters, I suppose?\" Annesley nodded. \" I took particular notice of the younger \u2014 what they call a clever girl here.\" \" There you are wrong, I am told. The elder goes in for the higher mental accomplishments.\" \" Well, one may admire the younger. We are on the look out for good dancers, you know\\ Not but mental acquirements have their merits, too.\" Here the conversation of the two young men was interrupted by a remark from the Colonel \u2014 not to the regret of the master of Ballinteer, who was conscious of a certain ungraciousness ; all the more, perhaps, as the other young man still maintained a frank and honest courtesy7."], [84, "76 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \"By-the-bye, Mr. Annesley,\" proceeded the Colonel, \"you should be an authority on these matters. Our offence, it is said, in our efforts to reconcile your people to a common yoke, arises from our invincible ignorance of the ways and manners of the country. I confess I meet much to confirm the charge.\" \"Why not confess more unreservedly, Colonel?\" said the young man, with a laugh, glad of the pretext to assume a more cordial demeanour. \" Out with it, and say your present surroundings suggest further confirmation.\" \" Well \u2014 since you have said it for us,\" replied the genial speaker, turning, also with a laugh, toward his brothers-in arms. Yes, here was certainly an opportunity to be frank, and honest, too ; and, accordingly, the master of Balljnteer thus rephed \u2014 \" No doubt, the general subject is involved in much that is complicated, even to ourselves. But you want my own case \u2014 and it is at your service. In times past, we Annesleys were accounted wealthy, aud, on paper, could show a goodly rent roll. But, even then, all that glittered was not gold. Family charges and interest on mortgages, as is not uncommon, demanded the lion's share. My father maintained, for a whUe, the style of living of his ancestors ; then had recourse to fresh loans ; and, finally, made effort to relieve the estate by residence abroad. This last expedient was, so far, success ful. On his death I was told that I might return to a moderate competence, and that it was my duty to do so. But a new foe was already in the field. I may not say what final result is sought for, or hoped for, in these present proceed ings. Probably the leaders, themselves, see nothing more definite than the satisfaction of a mean and dishonest greed."], [85, "THE END OF THE HUNT 77 But, beyond question, one certain means toward vague ends is the expulsion, by impoverishment, of the landlord class. To that they systematically applied themselves, commencing with those least able to bear the strain that was to be put upon them. My case was an obvious one, and was thus taken early. By our open and public system of registration in this country7, the indebtedness of each estate is known to the penny. It was easy to calculate at what reduction of rents I could no longer pay my own way, putting nothing into my own pocket at all. Much in my favour was undeniable. Rents had not been raised within the records of the estate. To meet the times an abatement was proposed, below which, for the reasons I have stated, I could not go. When negotiations arrived at that stage, the wire-pullers saw their way clearly enough. The mandate went forth to insist on a reduction which was practically impossible. My answer was tantamount to this ; and then came the final mandate \u2014 ' Base is the slave who pays.' In other words, the Plan of Campaign was in augurated.\" The young man had made an effort to impart such lightness to his narrative as its nature admitted of ; but it was plain that there was suppressed feeling under all. Again, the good natured Colonel came to his aid. \" Mandates must have their enforcements : the rest is thus explained ? \" \" Nevertheless, the explanation needs some comment from me. We \u2014 Annesleys \u2014 were at no time actually unpopular. To this, no doubt, I owe it that I, a stranger in all but name, receive no evidence of unfriendliness, save obedience to these unwritten laws.

If I happen to meet two together, we pass by without even this attempt at courtesy. Each of them fears his neigh bour.

But the compromise was a wise one \u2014 devilish in its wisdom, as you may see for yourself. I was to be left without molestation, but the hand that helped me was to bear the penalty. All who hitherto had employment on the estate abandoned it \u2014 -the threat was only too real. This fellow alone refused \u2014 and, I suppose, will be shot, some day or another.

A VISIT TO MR. DARLEY. THREE days after, that Thursday which Mr. and Mrs. Potter had arranged for their visit to Mr. Darley had arrived, and accordingly they took their short journey to town. Mrs. Potter had sent on a little note to the gentleman, stating on what day she would obey his summons. But in other respects the note was as short as his own, and, further, contained no reference to that confidential injunction of his. Mr. Darley had held a respectable legal practice now for some years. The function did not usually extend to a \" court\" one, and when a lawsuit did get into the office, as, in the course of a large \"family\" business, could not always be helped, the occurrence w7as deplored by that gentleman, and was even found to interrupt the ordinary cool and circumspect routine of his life. Mrs. Ogleby had endeavoured to impress upon her daughter the dangers of litigation, but, within the legal circle, she could hardly have been in safer, that is more deterrent, hands than with Mr. Darley himself. Deed-boxes, bearing their owners' names, stood all round the otherwise nearly empty room into which Mr. and Mrs. Potter were now ushered.

But not even in the distraction of a family lawsuit had Mr. Darley been known to entangle a thread, or drop a hint, of the mighty trusts reposed in him. F"], [90, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 82 They had been shown into the room by a tall, respectable looking clerk, who probably was a head clerk. But clerks who were not respectable, either in looks or acts, had long disappeared, at least from such offices as those over which Mr. Darley presided. \"Mr. Darley will be disengaged in a few moments. Just at present he is occupied with Lord Mangerton.\" The clerk made this latter intimation with some manifestation of pride, which might be almost called personal. After that, he added, though more deferentially, \" I know he is particularly anxious to see you. In fact, I think it is by appointment ? \" \" Yes,\" said Mrs. Potter, who took upon herself to reply, \"Mr. Darley wrote to us.\" \" Quite so,\" said the clerk, this time nicely balancing his pride and his deference, so as to convey to his hearers some idea of the respectabdity, as well as regularity, of the office. After that, he performed some operation upon the fire, and retired with dignity. \" That is grandpapa's deed-box,\" said Mrs. Potter, pointing to one of the japanned chests. \" I wonder what is in it ? \" \"Hardly real deeds, I suppose,\" said Mr. Potter. \"I should think they would not be quite safe here, where anyone could come in and go out.\" \" I suppose so \u2014 or we ourselves could say we were someone else.\" \" Hem ! The clerk, for all his ceremony, has had his instructions, and keeps to them. Possibly, he knows you?\" \"I cannot say. I have not been here recently.\" \"And this clerk appears to be no recent importation. I shouldn't wonder if he knew our business, too.\" \" And it took us so long even to guess it ! Perhaps you are right. Look ! that is Lord Mangerton's deed-box ! I suppose Lord Mangerton is really with Mr. Darley? \""], [91, "A VISIT TO MR. DARLEY 83 \" He is a client of his, at all events. Besides, everything looks so respectable, including this clerk, that I should say he was telling the truth.\" Then Mr. Darley himself made his entrance. That inter view with his lordship did not appear to have added to his ease and comfort. In fact, he looked anxious, not to say worried; but he made an effort to shake it off, aDd \"came up smiling,\" so to speak, to his new visitors. As he had been engaged in this sort of practice, namely, identifying himself with each succession of visitors for the time being, pretty much since he had commenced business on his own account, he had now arrived at a tolerable proficiency. Not that deceit or heartlessness was to be found in the man ; but, then, business is business. For instance, does a successful medical practitioner visit the irritability or unreasonableness of one patient on another, or carry the cares and troubles of each bedside to the next ? \" My dear Mrs. Potter, I fear I have kept you waiting. Of course, we all think our own affairs the most urgent in the world.\" Saying this, Mr. Darley indicated some movement over his shoulder, as suggesting that such remark was applicable, not to those inside the room, but to those, whoever they might be, outside of it. He had shaken hands with Mrs. Potter, and still continued to hold her hand kindly, even affectionately, while he spoke. As a grandchild of old Mr. Warburton, as a daughter of his present client, the owner of the Mount, this was perhaps her due. But while Mr Darley thus addressed Mrs. Potter, he continued to command that lady's husband out of the corner of his eye, as it were. \"We have nothing very urgent,\" was the lady's reply, \"and we have not been long waiting at all.\""], [92, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 84 \" No ; this is my affair altogether. / am the person now in trouble. / am one of those impatient of all other troubles,\" and again Mr. Darley made his half-humorous signs. Casting around for some sort of reply, and not finding any better, Mrs. Potter now introduced her husband, and the two gentlemen shook hands. \" I have taken upon myself to bring Mr. Potter,\" continued the lady, \"though your note did not say so.\" The fact of Mr. Potter's \"bringing\" being sufficiently obvious, and as reference was made to the rev. gentleman himself, Mr. Darley evidently thought it a good opportunity to have another look in that direction. But, whether he suc ceeded in finding that which he was in search of, or preferred still to suspend his judgment, he made no direct reply to the presumed question of the lady as to having taken too much upon herself in that which she had done. Instead, he said : \" Yes, indeed, there seems to be nothing but trouble going, nowadays. Well, in this country, how should it be otherwise 1 Of course, you have nothing to say to that. Nor do I look upon you as clients at all \u2014 you are friends, confidential friends in fact. Now, there is a gentleman \u2014 a nobleman, in fact\"; and, this time, Mr. Darley, instead of repeating that sign over his shoulder, pointed to Lord Mangerton's deed-box instead, possibly as, for the time being, representing that personage. \"There was a fine estate for you!\" continued the speaker, passing, with well-known poetic licence, from the person to the box, from the box to the property it was the evidence of \u2014 \" There was an estate, sir ! That man's rent-roll was forty thousand a year \u2014 forty thousand pounds, I assure you,\" repeated Mr. Darley, and appealing to the gentleman, as perhaps the more competent of his two hearers to realise the full meaning and import of such weighty words. \" To be"], [93, "A VISIT TO MR. DARLEY 85 sure, there were incumbrances to be deducted from that \u2014 it seems natural to landed estates to have them accumulate upon it, more 's the pity ; it oughtn't to be. Still, it was a noble income, notwithstanding. Well, what has happened? A demand was made upon this nobleman which was intended to be impertinent, and compliance with which was intended to be humiliating. He did not comply. What happened, then? That is something like four years ago, and, since then, Lord Mangerton has not received one penny out of his estate. If this was a matter confined to the office, I oughtn't to tell you \u2014I couldn't. But you '11 find it in all the newspapers.\" \"An extreme case,\" responded Mr. Potter, as the person now chiefly7 addressed. \" Well \u2014 perhaps so. But there are dozens of cases through out the country, differing only in degree. The principle is the same.\" \"The want of it, I suppose you mean ?\" \" Yes, I suppose I do. I see you know something about the matter, my dear sir. You have pointed out the plague spot \u2014 rem acu tetigisti, as we say in the schools.\" \"There is a case very near us,\" said Mr. Potter, encouraged by the praise bestowed upon him \u2014 \u25a0\" I am acquainted with that.\" \" Ah ! to be sure \u2014 Ballinteer. I have had some connection with that, too. You see, they are scattered all over the country. Mangerton is in the south \u2014 the extreme south. I wish you knew something more about it.\" \"Why?\" inquired Mrs. Potter. \"Well, Lord Mangerton is considerably put about, just now.\" \" You have told us enough to make him so.\" \" Have I ? Oh ! in consequence of this ' no rent ' move-"], [94, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 86 ment? Well, consequences lead to \u2014 consequences. If we, unexpectedly and unjustly, deprive others of their means \u2014 our concern ought perhaps to be more keen.\" \"Unjustly? \u2014 that is not Lord Mangerton's act, surely?\" \"No \u2014 I have hardly expressed myself correctly. Lord Mangerton believed himself in a position to meet all engage ments he entered into. You will understand that this could not be done for some time, just now. Some of these instances are painfuL His lordship called on me this morning in reference to one of them.\" Mr. Darley had commenced this interview with an expres sion of regret for the delay Lord Mangerton's call upon him had caused to these, his other visitors. Still, he had not yet got beyond Lord Mangerton and his affairs with them. No doubt, some of this further delay was caused by un affected and unpremeditated concern in the subject of their discourse. But, possibly, there was that also, on the part of Mr. Darley, which was not entirely unpremeditated. Let us take the case of the successful medical practitioner, already referred to. How often do we find our doctor regale us with the tittle-tattle of the town \u2014 the pleasantries, or the contrary, of the present weather \u2014 reminiscences of his, or our own, past life \u2014 anything but what appears to be his proper and declared business ? In reality, he is taking stock of us \u2014 only he won't say so. That, he considers, would quite spoil the effect. However, Mr. Darley did now come to the point, whether he had sufficiently appraised the value of his stock or not. \" You know, my dear Mrs. Potter, I always considered that you carried the brains of the family.\" \" But my sister is a much more learned person than I am,\" responded the lady, in an attempt to play with the compliment."], [95, "A VISIT TO MR. DARLEY 87 \" That may he. One may have brains without learning \u2014 not that such is your case, by any means. So, too, one may have learning without brains, which is not your sister's case, either. Thus, we lawyers \u2014 most of us mere dry book-men \u2014 are fortunate when we can confer with natural and un trammelled ability. Now, that is partly the reason that I wrote to you.\" \" Partly, Mr. Darley ! What other special qualifications do I possess 1 \" \" Hem ! My dear Mrs. Potter, you know you possess a husband.\" This being undeniable, especially in the presence of the \" qualification \" alluded to, the lady permitted the speaker to proceed. \" Yes, you are a married woman\u2014 excuse me thus using strictly legal terms. On that account, we have to be very careful what we do. If we happen to do anything wrong \u2014 to exceed our powers, as I may put it \u2014 Mr. Potter here could make us all jump.\" Naturally, when saying this, Mr. Darley turned his eye on the gentleman he declared to be possessed of this potent spell ; and, quite as naturally, Mrs. Potter did the same. The rev. gentleman, thus assailed, could only sit on his chair and look uncomfortable. \"I am glad there is some one to maintain order,\" said the lady, with a laugh. \" I '11 do my duty, and keep Mr. Potter up to the mark.\" \"I \u2014 I hope not, my dear Mrs. Potter,\" said Mr. Darley quite seriously. \" I \u2014 I fear some of us are not prepared to undergo so severe a test\u2014 myself, perhaps, among them. You see, I am making a personal appeal to Mr. Potter's for bearance.\""], [96, "88 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Mrs. Potter now laughed again ; an example which Mr. Potter himself followed, probably as an encouraging earnest of his merciful view of the matter, when it came before him. But Mr. Darley would not yet allow his fears to be allayed. \" You have no idea how easy it is to walk into a lawsuit ; and then, a family lawsuit, of all others ! \" \" Well, I don't know that I should keep Mr. Potter up to that,\" said the relenting lady. \" Besides, I doubt if I could. Mr. Potter is a book-man, too \u2014 but of quite another turn.\" \" Ah ! \" said Mr. Darley, looking more kindly on the rev. gentleman than he had yet done \u2014 \" there is some consolation in that. Now, if you had gone and brought a litigious husband into the family, I don't know what would have happened \u2014 I really don't, Mrs. Potter.\" \" But I didn't go anywhere ; and Mr. Potter took me out of the family.\" \"It wouldn't make any difference \u2014 that wouldn't.\" \" Very well. Mr. Potter is just as I have described him to you. Give him his books, and he will be much obhged to me or to you to tell him what he ought to do, or not to do. So you can inform us safely what it all means. Only, about Mr. Potter, I ought to tell you another \u2014 well, pecu liarity. He has an objection to secrets. I don't know that / could steer him safely through a secret. Are there any secrets ? \" \" None. Stay \u2014 except that note I wrote to you, you know.\" \"Well, I have got Mr. Potter over that. Then there is papa ! \" \" Who knows all I can tell you. You haven't been getting over him, have you ? \""], [97, "A VISIT TO MR. DARLEY 89 Mrs. Potter shook her head in intimation that such was not the case. \" I told mamma I got your note \u2014 that is all.\" \" You might have told your father, too \u2014 it would have made no difference. Anyway, it was my duty to ask for this interview with you and \u2014 and Mr. Potter, before taking steps which \u2014 well, may have to be taken. Yes, poor Mr. Warburton, I fear, is answerable for all this trouble. He made a will \u2014 of course, your father knows that ; and though the account you give me of Mr. Potter is reassuring \u2014 still, our troubles are not over yet. Well, old Mr. Warburton made a will, or what purports to be such \u2014 I should have explained that. I took it to he a will, and to some extent acted upon it ; that is the fix I have got myself into. Perhaps it is not so very serious, present relations being considered. The real dangers are ahead. Of course, your sisters will get married ? \" \"If they can get husbands,\" replied Mrs. Potter. \" Yes. And we can form no idea what sort of husbands those will be.\" \"I don't think they know themselves,\" said Mrs. Potter. \" Oh ! \" said Mr. Darley, \" there is nothing of that sort in immediate contemplation ? You see, we must be thankful for mercies, even the smallest.\" Thus impressed with the gravity of the matter, Mrs. Potter reflected, so giving to herself the appearance of hesitation. \"I don't think my sister, Sophia, has ever thought of any thing \u2014 except her books. As for my sister, Kate, I hardly consider it my province to \u2014 to speculate on the subject.\" There had been some laughing over the young owner of Ballinteer. Kate had laughed, too, but had parried the ques tions put to her. Again, Mrs. Potter had given herself the appearance of hesitation, and was not pleased with herself for so doing. Mr. Darley considerately came to her relief."], [98, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 90 \"Quite right, Mrs. Potter. Well, in a sense, quite wrong too. You see, any day we may have a master put over our heads, who will know his power.\" \" Make us jump, I think you said ?\" \"Just so. Your poor grandfather brought all this trouble upon us. He 's dead now ; but the truth must be told because we have to face it. He made his own will. It 's a popular opinion that anyone can make a will. I have known very eminent lawyers make their own wills, which have ended in family lawsuits. In fact, it is one of those things which if you want done, you ought not to do for yourself. Take my advice, Mr. Potter \u2014 though I may appear to be talking shop \u2014 don't make your own will. For years and years, old Mr. Warburton consulted me on all matters of serious business. Then he went home and made his will, without telling me a word about it. We won't go into his reasons \u2014 perhaps that is not now necessary?\" And, saying these latter words, Mr. Darley's side-glance did again turn on Mr. Potter. \" Possibly, very possibly, Mrs. Potter, you have got Mr. Potter over that too?\" \" Yes ; Mr. Potter is aware \u2014 only quite recently, though \u2014 that grandpapa wanted to keep the money for \u2014 for .\" \"Well, well, Mr. Potter is aware. This being so \u2014 I mean, Mr. Warburton being desirous to keep his money from going where \u2014 where other moneys had already gone, a difficulty would arise in his mind. He must do that which, how ever done, would be very displeasing to your father, Mrs. Potter. Very displeasing to your father \u2014 painful, I daresay, to your mother \u2014 and, perhaps, unjust in the eyes of the rest of the world.\" \" I know it has been very painful to mamma ; wives do not wish to come empty-handed to their husbands,\" said Mrs."], [99, "A VISIT TO MR. DARLEY 91 Potter. She also knew it had displeased her father, but fore bore to add that corroboration to Mr. Darley 's words \u2014 \" But why unjust?\" she inquired instead. \" Don't you perceive you have answered yourself, Mrs. Potter? Your father married the only child of a well-to-do man. Naturally, people would expect that he was to have the benefit of whatever that man left behind him. I fancy, all this was passing through Mr. Warburton's own mind at the time. For, though he did not give me his whole confidence, he asked me a number of questions about wills \u2014 the due and proper execution of them, the appointment of trustees, and other the like matter. After that, he went home and made his own will. He followed ah the information he had received from me with wonderful fidelity. He bequeathed all his property to three trustees, directing them to apportion it, share and share alike, among his grandchildren, when and so soon as the youngest of them should attain to the age of twenty-one, or get married.\" \"That is the wih?\" said Mrs. Potter. \"Mamma is passed over?\" \"That is the purport of the document which Mr. Warburton has left behind him. Your father and mother are both passed over.\" \"Poor papa!\" said Mrs. Potter. \"Well, well \u2014 let us see,\" proceeded Mr. Darley. \"I have not yet said who is poor and who is rich ; and, probably, it will take a bigger man than I am to say that.\" \" At least, when this money comes to be divided, a more fair distribution of it can then be made?\" \" Ah me ! I am not big enough even to say that.\" \"Not if Mr. Potter gives his consent to such an arrange ment 1\""], [100, "92 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \"Not even if Mr. Potter consents \u2014 not even if the two other gentlemen, who are yet unnamed, were to give their consent. Well, well, my dear Mr. and Mrs. Potter, I did not ask you here merely to propound riddles to you. Take the foregoing as preparatory to such explanation as I can give, and, if you '11 excuse me, to bespeak your full attention.\" Mrs. Potter looked at her husband, and, in spite of her curiosity, laughed. Mr. Potter replied with a laugh, too. Somehow, this way of bespeaking attention sounded familiarly to him. \" Yes,\" proceeded Mr. Darley, \" the matter is somewhat involved ; but, having gained your attention, 1 will endeavour to make it sufficiently simple for comprehension.\" His two hearers having accorded him his request by the most ready evidence in their power, namely, complete silence, Mr. Darley again spoke : \" Mr. Warburton was, in many respects, an apt scholar. He turned all his money into ' real estate ' \u2014 houses and lands, you know. And then he proceeded to make testamentary disposi tion of this estate. Now, as regards such disposition, the law of the land obliges the fulfilment of a few simple rules, without which the document would be invalid. Mr. Warburton was very particular in seeing that all these rules were complied with. The will ought to be his last will ; and, as far as search has gone, none other has been found. It must be duly executed \u2014 that is, signed by the testator in the presence of two wit nesses, who also append their signatures. That also was done. Incontestably, Mr. Warburton was a person of sound mind and understanding at the time ; and, as to undue influence, it was all his own doing, even to the handwriting of the docu ment.\" \" What, then, is the difficulty ? \""], [101, "A VISIT TO MR. DARLEY 93 \" It is this. The law of the land does not allow such property, real property, to be tied up for an indefinite period \u2014 till a time which may never come. I don't take it upon myself to say that the document in question attempts to do this \u2014 only, if it has done so, unquestionably it is waste paper.\" \" Mamma would then get the money?\" \" No ; it would become the property of her husband, to do as he liked with it. You see, I can answer that question for you.\" \" And the other question ? Are we necessarily drifting into a lawsuit ? \" \" We must put aU our heads together.\" \"But you consult us only ! \" \" I think I explained that to you,\" said Mr. Darley. \" Oh ! on account of Mr. Potter. He will do anything we do.\" \"I could not know that by intuition. I am very glad to hear you say so, for you understand now how unmanageable husbands can make themselves.\" \" And what wonderful powers they acquire ! \" said Mr. Potter, who thought, under the circumstances, he ought to assert himself. \" Then, this is preliminary ? \" inquired Mrs. Potter \u2014 \" and we are to enlarge the number of heads as we proceed ? \" \" Quite so,\" said Mr. Darley \u2014 \" that is just the suggestion I should make. Wre have got over the first step now. We, lawyers, acquire the habit of proceeding gradually from step to step. We acquire the habit so strongly in this life, that we are charged with pursuing it even into another life.\" Thus, it was finally arranged that Mr. and Mrs. Potter should further discuss the situation between themselves with a view to more united family* counsel, and apprise Mr. Darley of the conclusion come to."], [102, ""], [103, "CHAPTEE IX.

He had been lifting a spoonful of soup to his mouth, when the operation was arrested by finding Lieutenant Gatesby seated opposite to him at the other side of the mess table. The time was the day after that hunt, which had its final ending in Ballinteer House, and the place was the officers' quarters at the Curragh. \" Yes \u2014 there were a lot of us away.

I wonder if he could be got to join us ? \" \"He already holds rank as lieutenant in his own county Militia,\" said Major Clifford. \"And I happen to know,\" added Dr. Quilter, \" that he is an honourman of his own Alma Mater.\" \" Come,\" said the Colonel. \" A man like that, if he made up his mind to it, could get an exchange into the Line, after a couple of months' coaching, or so.\" \" By-the-hye, there is that project which Lord Clogher came here about the other day,\" said Major Clifford. \" To be sure, there is ! Excuse me, gentlemen,\" said the Colonel, \" I intended to bring that before you \u2014 I promised to do so. Yes, Lord Clogher was here, and explained to me what he and the county gentry are about. The regular County Hunt has now, for some time, been in abeyance. Its Master has betaken himself elsewhere. The gentry think that this"], [109, "AN INVITATION TO MESS 101 ought not to be. They are thankful to private gentlemen, like this Mr. Ogleby, who thus provides a substitute for an old institution, but they are also of opinion that the county should have its County Hunt with its responsible Master. With such opinion, gentlemen, we have nothing to say, unless to admit that they are clearly entitled to it. Mr. Ogleby has been affording sport \u2014 gratuitously, if I may use the expression ; supposing the gentry of the county prefer to pay for it, we must presume that they know their own business best. In short, the restoration of the County Hunt is now in the air : perhaps I should say \u2014 in the field.\" \"How do you connect this with Mr. Annesley, sir?\" \"Vaguely enough, perhaps \u2014 at first sight. A responsible and paid Master of the Hounds will certainly be wanted. If there is to he such, Mr. Ogleby himself will not be a candi date, so I am told. He is no longer young \u2014 he is more inclined to retire altogether than to seek reward for that which he has hitherto given gratuitously. That being so, and if we are asked to subscribe, we must be allowed a voice in the matter. But there is an undercurrent, so too I am given to understand. The gentry have no desire to see one of their own order pushed to the wall, as in young Annesley's case. Nor is a boycotted property considered by them a gain in the midst of a county. Not to put too fine a point upon it, want of resource is the necessary condition of these matters. Thus, the gentry, let us presume, may see for themselves that in aiding the owner of Ballinteer they are helping on their own interests as well. No doubt, all this is very much the language of conjecture. Suppose we feel our way a bit ? Let us have the two men here. Now ! Horner, a neat little note to each of them \u2014 nothing formal, you '11 understand ; perhaps, you might add 'among ourselves.' I'll leave that to your own consideration.\""], [110, "102 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Accordingly, an invitation to the Mess did come to the owner of Mount Ogleby, and another to Charles Annesley. At first, the younger of the two men was minded to decline his invitation, courteously but firmly. With courtesy \u2014 for, indeed, the note was worded specially to convey a still lively sense of the thanks and good wishes of those who sent it. The mutton eaten and the poteen imbibed had not yet been forgotten. Nevertheless, what had he to do with that brighter side of life, in the company of his more gay and prosperous fellow-men ? He had given his food to them because they had been in need of it \u2014 not because he expected payment for it. After that, he found himself asking the further question \u2014 was this courtesy ? He was to go out into the world, if for no other reason than that his present life had become a weariness to him. Was he to go out, snarling alike at friend and at foe? He was a young man, yet ; what was his old age to he, if he faced the world after this fashion ? Then, when he was thus of two minds, came another note from the owner of Mount Ogleby. Arthur Ogleby could pen a note, when occasion for it arose. It may be added that the occasion must be sufficiently pressing, for epistolary correspon dence was not among his favourite pastimes. The present note was written in a neat, feminine hand, though it bore the signa ture, \" Arthur Ogleby,\" in an unmistakably masculine scrawl. The note left no doubt that the owner of this signature intended to accept his invitation, and was also in possession of the fact that a like tender of hospitality had been forwarded to the younger man. The note then proceeded to inform the latter that the owner of the Mount would call at Ballinteer on his way to the Mess, in the hope and expectation of having his friend's companionship on the drive."], [111, "AN INVITATION TO MESS 103 Then, Charles Annesley said to himself he must go. This elder man, who so rarely relaxed in his behaviour, had already made a relaxation toward him. He had asked for the young man's better acquaintance \u2014 \" Confound it, man, why don't you come over and see us?\" To which he had certainly made reply that he would so \" come over.\" The sooner he got his hand in for that sort of thing, the better. Then he fell to studying this note, which had swayed him in making his present decision. The handwriting was neat, and also un mistakably that of a lady. Possibly, Mrs. Ogleby might still write in such a style ; that is, if her style had not yet been affected by increasing years. But, then, such might not be the case, and, under that supposition, Arthur Ogleby must have selected a more youthful amanuensis. The man himself made his appearance by the time the owner of Ballinteer was ready. He had bestowed some atten tion upon himself, befitting the occasion ; or, at least, such attention had been bestowed on him. The attention was not over the mark, which was not at aU likely to happen ; but neither was it under. \" You didn't expect to find me gallivanting in this way ! It's pretty nigh time for me to stop at home, and see my friends there. But this invitation made some reference to hunting matters\u2014 perhaps you know more about it ? \" Charles Annesley professed his ignorance on the point. Lieutenant Horner had so varied his epistolary style as to bait the younger man's invitation with a reference to the indebtedness of his brother-officers only. \"As to hunting matters, they are inquiring in the right direction, at any rate,\" he said, adding, \"I suppose you can give Larry a seat ? Poor fellow ! I don't care to leave him behind here.\""], [112, "104 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Then, Larry was told to jump up behind. Some care had been bestowed on his general get-up, too. Altogether, the turn-out would fairly hold its own, even at Curragh quarters."], [113, "CHAPTER X. MICK MA LONE. OF Ballyfair it is to be said \u2014 however contrary to the general experience of Irish country towns \u2014 that it was neat, orderly, and fairly prosperous. Whether it is to he independently added, or merely as a consequence therefrom true it also is that there was a general appearance of content ment and good feeling. Not merely were the discourses of the Rev. Mr. Flanagan only occasional, as well as temporary in their influence, or at least in their outward effects, but, also, they were themselves a comparatively new importation. Even still, Ballyfarians could call to mind the time when the Catholic Priest and the Protestant Rector were on good terms ; when they actually co-operated in works of benevolence and charity : when there were those amenities between the masses and the classes without which civilisation itself must halt, if it does not actually retrograde. Perhaps, it would be too much to say that all this was now altered. Those discourses of the rev. gentleman had their effects for the passing time. But it was still clear that the masses had a tendency to return to their former relations with the classes, if only they were let alone. But, after a while, it had become sufficiently known that a more secret element was at work. What Father Flanagan said had been declared openly, in the face of his people. All"], [114, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 106 had been free to hear \u2014 it was his dearest wish that all should so hear. If his Protestant neighbours did not come to listen, that was their fault, and, assuredly, he thought, their loss too. Nay, he took pains to improve the occasion to those of them who had to come \u2014 such as an inspector of constabulary in charge of his men, or the captain of a company of red-coats stationed near and under like obligation. And when these found the words too hot for their ears, and even ordered their men out of the sacred edifice, the rev. gentleman noticed their departure regretfully, and even audibly. \" You 're going now, hoys,\" was his parenthetical observation \u2014 \" and I 'm sorry you have to go. But the time will come when we will all be of the same turn of mind.\" With such declarations, also, his words accorded, and even his demeanour outside those sacred walls. Whatever Father Flanagan was besides, he was certainly honest and outspoken. But there was a movement under all this, which preferred to do its work in silence, and by stealth. Hardly anything was known of it, save that it came from without, and brought the masses within its power by steady and, apparently, irresist ible influence. That it acted on a previously prepared soil has not been denied\u2014 and could not be denied. That denunciation of it \u2014 when there was such \u2014 was half-hearted, must be added as a matter of fact. \" We must go with our people,\" said the Priesthood of Ireland. But assuredly, in this matter, the people had recognised the way they were to be led. The leading itself, when it came, was from without \u2014 let so much be admitted. Dublin had been organised already. In every city are to be found the reckless and the crazy. A few fell victims to their own narrow fanaticism. But the bulk of the organised had steeped their brains in the whisky shops. Then the network was to be extended through the country."], [115, "MICK MALONE 107 Here the swaggerer and dare-devil of the Dublin slums was out of place. A cooler head, a steadier hand, a more silent footfall were necessary. That such an organiser had visited Ballyfair and its district was known. Yet the movements of the man himself were enveloped in the deepest mystery. He was nameless. It was impossible to say whether he had adopted a clever disguise, which would never have an existence again. He did his business so that his right hand, so to speak, did not know how his left hand had acted. In fine, he came \u2014 he did his work \u2014 and he was now gone. And he left behind him that which was lasting. For the first time, the masses broke off with the classes \u2014 coldly, hardly, doggedly. The feelings and promptings of humanity became arrested. Suffering produced no response, save, sometimes, mockery. Men ceased to confide their affairs to those nearest to them. They lived to obey an inscrutable and inexorable authority \u2014 failure was death. Whatever secrets they had, they made no secret of this. When Mr. and Mrs. Potter, after their marriage, had set up housekeeping on the outskirts of the village, the lady had brought with her a young woman from the paternal home. Bridget Molloy was a healthy, comely, presentable young person ; and, for some years at least, it seemed to Mrs. Ogleby and her daughter that she could very well constitute the cheap retinue of the new and modest establishment, with such assist ance as it was the intention of Mrs. Potter herself to afford. When asked if she had any objection to the change, she blushed, and stated that her disinclination to change was entirely overcome by her wish to follow her young mistress. The answer was deemed creditable to head and heart by both ladies, though why the giving of it should he accompanied"], [116, "108 THE TURN OF THE TIDE by any appearance of embarrassment did not then explain itself to either. However, the explanation was soon forthcoming. Bridget's young man was \"a boy\" belonging to Ballyfair. It was certainly an upset to Mrs. Potter. However, as the matter had to be, it was gone through with good humour; and, in time, Bridget and \"the boy\" set up on their own account in the village*. There had been no recriminations, all being considered fair in love as in war ; and, now that Bridget was herself a married woman, Mrs. Potter had entered upon even more companionable terms with her, due regard being had for their respective stations in life. The sad events just alluded to had yet made no change in their relations. Mr. and Mrs. Potter had done nothing to bring them within the unwritten law of the land. Even in controversy, Mr. Potter had the good sense and taste to confine himself within his own Protestant pale. Consequently, concerning them, no \" orders \" had been issued. Mick Malone, \" the boy \" who was thus the cause of this first upset to Mr. and Mrs. Potter's quiet settlement in life, was but a labouring man, though, after his marriage, he aspired to the higher rank of \"handy man.\" He could dig, and fairly trim, a garden. An odd job of roof-repairing or wall-coping did not come amiss to him. He was fairly steady ; that is to say, occasionally he took a drop, when he always made a fool of himself; after which, there was a determined and successful period of sobriety. All this was not very encouraging to the matrimonial venture, and Bridget, herself a smart, intelligent, industrious young woman, might have perhaps done better. But Mrs. Potter interested herself among her friends, and, a small house in the village then falling vacant, the new Mrs. Malone was installed therein as general dealer, in fact, not to put too fine"], [117, "MICK MALONE 109 a point upon it, as huckster. To Mrs. Malone it was \" a business \" of some dignity and importance, to which she bent all the energies of her mind. So matters had jogged on with tolerable success, up to the present moment. Mick continued to take his occasional drops. But, by aid of the resolutions previously referred to, and a good \" talking over \" from Mrs. Potter or her husband now and again, there was certainly no marked or steady deteriora tion. He was naturally good-humoured, and did not lack interest in the business, to which he was now of service chiefly in conveying \" goods \" from the neighbouring market town, and even from Dublin. In fact, it might be now said that he had risen out of the labouring class altogether, the supply of stock to his wife's shop, together with commissions of a like nature from neighbours, taking up his whole time, and enabling him to maintain a horse and cart of his own. As a matter of course, Mick went with the popular movement. \"You'll understand, Miss Fanny \u2014 begging pardon, Mrs. Potter.\" Bridget had found it hard to \"come in on \" the new name, and, even still, made an occasional slip. \" Call me Mrs. Fanny \u2014 when you can,\" said the young curate's wife. \" I'll call you Mrs. Potter \u2014 when I can. I have no objection to the name \u2014 why should I? But one doesn't easily get out of a long use. You '11 understand, Mrs. Potter, that we couldn't carry on the business if we didn't go with our customers.\" \" But I 've brought you some nice customers, who don't go that way at all.\" Mrs. Potter said this in her lightest and most agreeable manner. Mr. Potter had shown his sense and taste \u2014 though that, of course, is as people may think \u2014 not merely in that matter of dry controversy, hut also in drawing"], [118, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 110 a hard and fast line, outside of which he would not travel, either to advise or interfere ; and this, falling in entirely with his wife's views, was strictly followed by her. This line was to be drawn harder and faster, if possible, in their dealings with their more humble friends and acquaintances. With them, the political, or rather the religious-political, subject was not to be seriously discussed. There are Protestant curates \u2014 I believe there are fewer of them now \u2014 whose sense of duty compels them to run their heads against all walls of this nature. But, whether Mr. Potter's controversial, and entirely harmless, efforts within his own pale sufficiently occupied his attention, or his qualities of mind disinclined him to further embitter so hopeless a task, certain it is that he did not voluntarily step outside his proper bounds. Therefore, Mrs. Potter, in making her remark, further implied by her manner that it was done with no intention to pursue the subject to controversial lengths. The \"movement\" had not yet greatly exceeded its political phase, at least in this their immediate neighbourhood, and Mrs. Potter herself was so much of a business woman as to understand that, within limits, customers should not be turned from the door. \" I don't complain,\" pursued Mrs. Malone \u2014 \" I like the business, and it seems to like me. Still, when we pay our rent, and feed and clothe the children, there is nothing left to run risks on.\" \"Those of us who accomplish so much are the well-to-do, nowadays,\" said her former mistress. \" Times are terribly changed with the high and the lofty of the land.\" To this, Bridget made no direct reply. As a person commercially interested, she was bound to regret the fact, and probably did. As one of \" the people,\" it was equally her duty to exult in so satisfactory a proof of the progress of the"], [119, "MICK MALONE 111 movement. But she neither exulted, nor expressed words of regret. Nevertheless, something of the nature of a sigh was audible. \" Let us be thankful we are not among the lofty,\" added the curate's wife. \"The Master still holds his own,\" said Mrs. Malone, whose natural pride in her past antecedents ignored all discretion ; with Bridget, \" the Master \" was always the owner of Mount Ogleby \u2014 \" You are your father's daughter, still.\" \" But I am married to a poor curate, Bridget. I belong to my husband, now. Yes, Mount Ogleby has had its troubles \u2014 but what are they compared to the desolation, elsewhere ! The more lofty the elevation, the greater the fall \u2014 and the more painful, too.\" To this Bridget yielded no assent. Personally, with her, Mount Ogleby occupied the highest known eminence, from a social point of view. \" Yes, we 've had our troubles at the Mount ; I mean in the old times.\" Mrs. Potter was able to say this in her more light spirit. Nor did Bridget regard it as a breach of good manners to answer with a recognising smile. These embarrassments had been no laughing matter in their time ; howbeit, there was no reason to cry over them, now. But, then as now, they had no effect in dwarfing the Mount Ogleby elevation in Bridget's eyes. \" Heigho ! \" continued Mrs. Potter, \" times have their fashions, I suppose. Such troubles were common enough, then. We had nothing like these we see around us, now. Besides, people cannot very much complain if they reap as they sow. That is what was said of them ; I suppose with some truth, too.\" \"That is what is said now \u2014 whether it be true or not,\" was"], [120, "112 THE TURN OF THE TIDE the reply of Mrs. Malone, spoken, however, with a becoming regret. \" Perhaps, Bridget. Yes, I know it is the charge in certain quarters. These matters are beyond our province ; we can only deplore that such charges should exist, be it in fact or in mind. We were both young girls, then; there maybe some thing in that, too, why they seemed less grave. At present, we can both understand more clearly what it is to have an empty home \u2014 perhaps, no home at all.\" \" Mick brings back queer sayings with him. You are not to think I speak from myself; even Mick does not do that. What should girls know about such matters ! \" \" Or ' boys,' \" added Mrs. Potter. \"Just so,\" assented Bridget \u2014 \"Mick says what he hears. Well, they say the old people themselves didn't understand what it was to have homes broken up \u2014 until \" \"Until their own were broken up,\" added Mrs. Potter, supplying the unsaid conclusion. \" Of course, that is some more of the charges. I could reply to the argument \u2014 though it 's not even an argument ; but I would waste my breath. I do not apply that to you, Bridget; nor to Mick, as you say he repeats. In fact, the people who tell him don't argue at all ; they only jeer. Meanwhile, the work goes on. I suppose, in its own good, or bad, time, it wih reach the Mount, too \u2014 why shouldn't it ? \" They were the only bitter words Mrs. Potter had yet said, and she now checked herself. Yes, she could answer those and the like charges. Not that she was quite prepared to absolve any ; it was the cruel, heartless, mocking one-sidedness which lent to her her bitterness. Dearly would she like to have one of those \"leaders of the people\" before her; not that all her rhetoric would extract a reason from him : he"], [121, "MICK MALONE 113 would know better than that ; but she would like to give him her mind \u2014 absolutely, freely, truly, as the truth was in her. Thus would she treat their leaders; but it was different with those who were merely led. \" Keep your customers as long as you can, fairly \u2014and go with your people as far as your conscience allows you. I suppose we all know what is right and what is wrong, or can if we hke. As for us, and our people, we may not always be of help. When we consider other parts of the country, we must confess we have been spared, after a fashion.\" \" Ballyfair is not as Ballyfair was,\" said Mrs. Malone, sufficiently conveying, by her tone, that the impending change was more general, and nearer, than her hearer's last words implied \u2014 \"We can see the difference.\" \" Of course ; who would be more likely ? Still, there is no actual distress, I hope. You have to be cautious whom you trust, I daresay ? \" Again, Mrs. Malone made intimation \u2014 this time by her manner only \u2014 that her words had not been entirely under stood. Audibly, however, her only cry was \"Very,\" uttered in as dry a tone as possible, the woman, at the same time, busying herself in the arrangement of some articles in her shop. \" There is nothing very new in that,\" continued Mrs. Potter, heedless, or apparently heedless, of these symptoms of diverg ing thought. \" It is one of the first principles to be learned, I suppose ; without it, anyone might do a large, though hardly a profitable, trade. Of course, you have to go upon trust, some times, and use your best judgment.\" \" We have no judgment of our own to use,\" at length replied the woman. \" We daren't. It isn't credit we have H"], [122, "114 THE TURN OF THE TIDE to refuse, but money. That 's the way business is done now. God keep Mount Ogleby out of it ! We 've got no orders yet.\" \" Orders, Bridget ! Has it come to this . \" Then Mrs. Malone seemed as if she must speak her mind more freely. Howbeit, she spoke with bated breath. \" There is no man or woman comes into this shop who is not watched, and his or her name taken. When we get our orders we have to refuse credit \u2014 and money, too.\" \" Has Father Flanagan allowed it to go as far as that, Bridget?\" \" Has he ! Does he himself stand opposite that door, and see who comes in and goes out ? Does he ask me and my husband if we sell goods to so-and-so \u2014 ay, and wait till he gets his answer ?\" Having disburdened herself of these words, Bridget further relieved herself of a few tears. No doubt, to a person of business habits, this enforced turning away of the current coin of the realm had its own bitterness, but the woman's hot indignation probably had a more unselfish motive also. \" Said I not truly,\" she pursued after a pause, when her tears seemed to have softened her resentment into regret, \"that all things had changed? Hard times are now for the rich as well as the poor.\" \" Certainly, Bridget, for the rich, if we can any longer call them so. But your customers were not mainly of this class at any time. Of course, we know that certain country houses were placed under a ban \u2014 Ballinteer, for instance. But this did not extend to other classes.\" \" It is so now. The man or woman who disobeys is marked \u2014 and punishment follows.\" \"Who gives those orders?\" said Mrs. Potter, with some sternness."], [123, "MICK MALONE 115 \" I know not. Mick brings them home, and then they have to be followed ; that is the one thing certain.\" \"Does Mick himself know ?\" \"Where these orders come from? If he does, he won't tell me. If we serve a marked customer we hear of it. If we persist, Mick is had up and admonished. After that we can go our own way. But I 'm told Mick would hear more about it.\" Then the entrance of someone into the shop, where the foregoing conversation had occurred, prevented further discourse on the subject. But Mrs. Potter left with these last words ringing in her ears. The man would hear more about it. As spoken by Bridget, they plainly had grave import and meaning for the poor woman herself. What, then, was this new development of the unwritten law of the land? Hitherto, its machinery had been employed directly against those in possession of some social position or rank \u2014 against the high and the lofty, as the young curate's wife had half-playfully phrased it. But it was now evident, from this as from other indications, that the net of terrorism was being spread to include all. Or, rather \u2014 for so Mrs. Potter corrected her own thoughts \u2014 such terrors, not being found sufficiently effectual with the classes, were now being transferred to the masses. Was other proof wanting of the artificial, as well as mercenary, organization of the entire movement ? To the mind of Mrs. Potter, certainly not."], [124, ""], [125, "CHAPTER XI. A STIFF COUNTRY. ALL matters had gone well at that Mess dinner, to which Arthur Ogleby and young Annesley had been brought, under something like pretences which might not hear the strictest investigation. But, in the present instance, they were the subject of no such exacting test. In the case of the owner of Mount Ogleby, it was easy enough to bring forward hunting matters which would interest so simple and unsuspecting a worshipper of the chase. This had been done, and all things had gone right merrily. Arthur Ogleby was, indeed, in his most genial and pleasant moments. The actual, the real occasion of the festive meeting itself was not so much as mentioned. From young Annesley it was to be kept hidden, until prospects took unto themselves much less of those dim and distant hues which now enveloped theni ; and in no possible event was any member of the present company to be its expounder. So much was thought due to the fitness of things. But, as regarded his elder companion, enough was elicited to justify the wbrds of the Colonel. There was plenty of sport in him yet. He would probably be found in the saddle as long as he could do anything. He would have an interest in hunting matters, even beyond that. But he wished someone else had the care of the hounds. Almost, they were the same words he had said to the Colonel."], [126, "118 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Then he, too, had pressed his invitation upon them. \" Let them name their day \u2014 an early one \u2014 and he would show them some sport again.\" There is wit in the wine-cup, and mirth circles round the board where Bacchus presides. But the mirth of Arthur Ogleby was not so inspired. His libations were of the lightest. The truth is, they had made much of the simple and unsophis ticated old man, and he had freely responded. When mirth flows through these clearer rills it is, perhaps, the most genuine of its kind. \"But we lost our way last time, you know, Mr. Ogleby,\" said the Colonel, in answer to this invitation. \" Nevertheless, we got into most excellent quarters,\" inter posed Dr. Quilter. \"True, Quilter. I hope Mr. Annesley will not think we are putting in for another invasion.\" \"The question does not arise,\" said Arthur Ogleby. \"Annesley has had your company; it's my turn now. After the hunt, you will all come back to Mount Ogleby, and have your bit of dinner there.\" Then the practical details were discussed. There were ladies at Mount Ogleby \u2014 some of them young. But, old or young, what gentleman, with well-regulated mind, could join them in a pair of splashed hunting-boots, and, very possibly, a splashed coat, too ? Even Arthur Ogleby, simple and primi tive as he was, could see the absurdity of that ! So it was arranged that a dogcart, or some such vehicle, should proceed to Mount Ogleby on the day of the hunt, with proper suits of dinner toggery, and that the gentlemen were to have half an-hour for shifting their garments, before the ladies were ahowed to inspect them. After that, the day was named. \" Let us have no nonsense, Annesley,\" said Arthur Ogleby"], [127, "A STIFF COUNTRY 119 to the young owner of Ballinteer, as they were both returning from the officers' mess. \" You '11 come back to Mount Ogleby with these fellows?\" They had been talking on some other subject, when the elder man had thus broken out, showing that impromptu invitation of his was now occupying his thoughts. The words themselves had reference to the evening's amusements, and were dictated by courtesy ; but, beyond a doubt, his thoughts were occupied with his responsibilities for the morning sport. Charles Annesley had certainly promised to himself that he would force himself out of his \"nonsense.\" Previously, too, he had made the promise to his older friend that he would be found a visitor at Mount Ogleby. This promise he had not yet fulfilled. Nor could he be unconscious of the fact that the fulfilment, in the shape now offered to him, deprived it of much of its formality. \"Wherefore the younger man, before they parted, gave intimation of his acquiescence. Arthur Ogleby had asked for an early day. Certainly, at that time, the veteran sportsman had been thinking more of the day's hunt than the day's dinner. Many men hunt in order that they may dine with increased satisfaction to them selves. But such men as the Master of Mount Ogleby consume their meals rather with a view of better encountering the labours of the chase. Thus, he had come to suggest the early day to his intended guests. But Colonel Cheviot and his fellow-men were suffi ciently men of the world to understand that the master of the house was not the only person to be consulted in such matters. No lady likes a guest to be brought home to her unawares, or even with insufficient notice. No doubt there are homes \u2014 homes of state, if they can be termed homes at all \u2014 where tables are maintained with some certain uniformity"], [128, "120 THE TURN OF THE TIDE all the year round, and where the exalted personages who own them take their seats with no more intimate knowledge of the good things that are to be set before them, than the guests whom they have invited. But to make pretence that an Irish country house, in such difficult times, was on a par with these, would he a stretch of politeness neither intelligent nor happy. Wherefore a reasonable day had been fixed. \" You must bring Patrick, Fanny,\" said Mrs. Ogleby to her married daughter. \" I particularly insist on that.\" \" Which means that I must bring myself, too, mamma ? \" \" Of course, Fanny. How can you ask such a question . You know very well that people cannot be asked here to meet themselves.\" But Mrs. Potter had propounded her question merely to gain time for a little thought. Matters had remained abso lutely unaltered since she and her husband had paid that visit to Mr. Darley. They had parted from that gentleman on the understanding that husband and wife were to talk the situation over again, with a view to bringing together a more full family council. There had been, as yet, no such family council. Mrs. Potter had seen her mother, and had informed her of Mr. Darley's doubts as to the validity of the document known as old Mr. Warburton's will, and, more especially, of his objection to act under it without the sanction of some higher authority. There the situation now rested. Mrs. Ogleby had been summoning up courage to put the matter before her husband, well knowing that she would then hear what would give her pain, but, nevertheless, seeing that it ought to be done. In the meantime, had come this notice of the proposed hunt's termination in the coming week. The notice itself \u2014 that is, Mr. Ogleby's intimation of the coming event to Mrs. Ogleby \u2014 had been of a slight \u2014 it might"], [129, "A STIFF COUNTRY 121 be almost said, of a casual character. \" I was thinking of bringing a few fellows honie from the hunt to dinner here on Thursday, Katty.\" But on more particularly inquiring who \"the fellows\" were, Mrs. Ogleby ascertained that something in the nature of arrangement and preparation would be becoming on her part. At first, she thought of having the Rector of the parish, old Mr. Stackpoole, to meet these strangers. That would give a desirable decorum, as well as a desirable admixture, to the occasion. \"The fellows\" them selves would adequately represent the Army ; Mr. Stackpoole was the highest available representative of the Church at hand. But when Mrs. Ogleby came to talk over his age and his infirmities with her daughters, the idea had to be abandoned. Mr. Stackpoole would decline the invitation, and, further, it would give him pain to have to do so. So it was that Mrs. Ogleby had come to speak in this peremptory manner to her daughter concerning her husband. And so it was also that Mrs. Potter had needed some little time to herself in order to think. A young curate can hardly be said to represent any thing, except youth, and, no doubt, decorum. Still, the Rev. Mr. Potter was their own \u2014 an actual member of the family itself, and that was something under the pressure of the occasion. WeU, perhaps there were other reasons, which the reader may collect from what has already occurred. At all events, Mrs. Ogleby had now said to her daughter, \"You must bring Patrick. There will be no dancing \u2014 your father will give the gentlemen exercise enough without that. But there ought to be a little music in the evening, if they will leave the table early enough.\" \" Yes, mamma,\" her daughter had said. \" I will bring Patrick and myself.\" Thursday was decidedly favourable for the hunt. There"], [130, "122 THE TURN OF THE TIDE had been no frost, which is perhaps the. huntsman's chiefest abhorrence. What wind there was came from the south, and though it had not brought with it a cloudy sky, yet a temperate worshipper of the chase will excuse an occasional patch of blue, if all else goes fairly. The Master of Mount Ogleby had put on his whole hunting demeanour. Permissible, and even becoming, is it to trifle the evening hours away, on occasion. But when a man takes that in hand which it is his special duty to perform, then even the appearance of frivolity must be laid aside. He must rise to the occasion, as it were. Thus, the Arthur Ogleby of the hunting morning was not at all the Arthur Ogleby of the festive evening. It must be ever so when the post of duty is assumed with a correct and adequate sense of its responsi bilities. When Captain Corcoran sails into action, proudly standing on the quarter-deck of his good ship, the Pinafore, and issuing, in necessarily loud tones, those directions on which victory or defeat is to depend, he is something different from the quiet and unobtrusive gentleman one has met at a social gathering. The change is expected \u2014 and accepted. So it was now. A Master of hounds who knows his business must have eyes, ears, and voice \u2014 for everything. He must overcome difficulties, or, assuredly, difficulties will over come him. If the riding of Mr. Toff was accompanied with danger to the dogs, the matter was explained to that person in a manner which caused him to ride more cautiously during the rest of the day. If a too-enthusiastic spectator of the chase headed the fox, a request was made to him to take up another position in the hunting-field, with which he complied with alacrity. And yet, those who had experience of the man detected a grim smile lurking about the set features. We, whose business"], [131, "A STIFF COUNTRY 123 it is to know everything, may explain. There had been much talk of hunting matters at that Mess dinner, and many wonder ful hobbies had been trotted out by its more youthful members, for the amusement, or perhaps edification, of the old man. Wherefore, when he had come to arrange his own day's doings for this coming event, he had made his projected run through a pretty stiffish bit of country. Did he expect to have a less number to come back and eat his mutton and drink his poteen, or whatever more civilised substitute it was his intention to give? No; he hoped to bring all his men back again. But he also hoped to give them something in the future to talk about. Kate Ogleby had accomplished a mount on this occasion. The company were to try the Mount Ogleby grounds first. It would bring men and dogs in on the thing, and probably leave those behind who should be so left for their own good. Kate had passed her word to her mother that she would return after this first experiment ; it may be that the old man had found his idea too big for his own keeping. The experiment itself had resulted in a find, and there had been a short run. Then a little breathing time was allowed before that greater and more distant trial was made. The young girl looked wistfully over the pleasant expanse of country, which was to conduct them to their new hunting ground. Even the journey thither would have been agreeable to her, amid the gay cavalcade, now less formal after its short and exhilarating run. But, then, her promise ! Charles Annesley had dis mounted near her, and was tightening his girths. Under all the circumstances she ought to speak to him. They had shaken hands at first meeting, and, after a few words, the young man had dropped into his place in the field, in a natural and sportsmanlike manner. Presently she would he returning,"], [132, "124 THE TURN OF THE TIDE and a word or two from her now ought to be said. Only, what to say ? \"Poor Mr. Toff! How hardly he pays for his pleasure ! I wonder he does not stay at home, or join some other hunt.\" \" Serve him right ! \" said the young man. \" Suppose he was to ride over one of the hounds ? \" Kate coidd not follow out so horrible a supposition. No doubt, in her father's estimation, Mr Toff was at liberty to commit the happy despatch on himself \u2014 but to maim one of his \" beauties \" ! \" Still, I wish papa would expostulate more mildly.\" \" Your father is cruel to be kind. If ever Toff does kill one of those hounds \u2014 well, I hope I won't be there, that 's all. I think we 're off again, Miss Ogleby.\" \"I think so, too. So I'll say good-bye.\" \"What! You don't mean to say you're going to leave us? We have hardly begun the day yet ! \" \" You will have quite enough of it, I 'm sure. We are never allowed to go to Tully Valley.\" \"Oh! your father's 'on' for that, is he? Well, I don't wonder at the prohibition.\" \" I cannot say for certain. This is on the way, you know.\" \" WeU, like enough. I fancy he meditates a surprise or two for those English fellows. To look at him now, you wouldn't think there was a joke in him.\" \" I don't think papa jokes on hunting matters. I believe some of those English fellows, as you call them, talked about their ' country,' and even expressed a wish to see some other ' country.' \" \" Oh, he was bound to show them his ; and he will, too, Miss Ogleby.\" \" Then you will all have to take care of yourselves."], [133, "A STIFF COUNTRY 125 Perhaps you were joking yourself when you asked me to be one of the party ? I have promised mamma to return from here ; that is all I really know about it.\" \"And that this is on the way to Tully Valley. I thought you might accompany us so far. There is no difficulty until we get there.\" \" But a promise is a promise.\" \"I suppose so. I'd better tell them you're not coming. They will be awfully disappointed.

There 's a lot of us coming back with your father. Perhaps he never told you ? \" \" Oh, yes, he told us.\" By this time the cavalcade was again in motion, and those who were bound for the more distant Tully Valley took their way thither."], [134, ""], [135, "CHAPTER XII. THE DINNER AT MOUNT OGLEBY. SURPRISE or no surprise, joke or no joke, the Master of the Hunt brought all his guests safely home with him. Splashed and dashed, of course, they were, so that the contents of that dogcart were an obvious necessity of the case. But life and limb were whole, and the stipulated half hour before dinner set all other matters to right. Of course, the gentlemen preponderated in number. Each and all could not take down a lady to dinner. But the Master of the Hunt, again mild and genial, took his reverend son-in law under his arm, and popped him into a seat at the table. Thus two gentlemen were disposed of at a stroke. Of course, Mrs. Ogleby fell to the lot of the Colonel. Captain Helmsley found himself seated next Kate Ogleby. \" I am waiting for some reasonable explanation from you, Miss Ogleby. You deserted us shamefully at the plantation.\" \" We are never allowed to go on to Tully Valley. You can understand that without any explanation.\" And Kate's face was not deficient in humour as she made the reply. Her partner responded with a laugh \u2014 \" Well, it is a stiffish place enough. Had we known that, we should have asked for some other arrangement.\" \" It was told to me that you gentlemen particularly wished to see some places of that kind.\""], [136, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 128 \" WeU, those of us who wished were fairly gratified to-day, I should say.\" Again, Captain Helmsley indulged in a laugh. Very possibly, the \"arrangement\" of the day now dawned upon him, and received quite pleasant acceptance with him. \" What I meant, Miss Ogleby, was that some of us thought we were depriving ourselves of your company. Some of us may want experience in hunting matters \u2014 but, I hope, none of us in gaUantry. Perhaps, you were waiting for the apology to come from me ? \" Kate disclaimed any such intention. It was sufficiently plain that the young man was indicating certain differences of experience among his companions. In matters of the chase Captain Helmsley was a man after her father's own heart, only needing the maturity of years. Twice now she had seen him in the hunting-field, and, on each occasion, the owner of the Mount had absolutely deferred to his judgment ! To her own surprise, such mastery was placing her rather more at her ease, than the contrary. Wherefore, she summoned spirit to add \u2014 -\"One can do no more than express regret \u2014 I understand you to imply something of that sort.\" \" Of course, we were all sorry. That is, before we knew we \u2014 we brought it upon ourselves. I understood you to suggest as much ? \" Of course, Kate had again to disclaim \u2014 \" Papa never takes us into his councils on hunting matters \u2014 you must draw your own conclusions. He certainly said you had a hard day's run.\" \"If he says so, it must have been. I rather thought myself it was.\" \" So you see, Captain Helmsley,\" continued the young girl, gaining courage as she continued to talk \u2014 \" whether by chance or \u2014 arrangement, the result would have been pretty much the"], [137, "THE DINNER AT MOUNT OGLEBY 129 same. You would all have gone away, and left me to do what I could for myself.\" \" Miss Ogleby ! Is that the way Irish gentlemen hunt ? \" \" Certainly, Captain Helmsley. You know very well it is the way all gentlemen hunt. Irish gentlemen, so I have heard, are peculiarly susceptible of ridicule ; still, I suppose, no one Ukes to get laughed at.\" \" In what way, please ? \" \" Well \u2014 coming out to hunt, and not hunting. Don't you think the rest of the field would laugh at that ? \" Captain Helmsley himself certainly did laugh. What sort of talk was this 1 Here was a girl, at first appearance shy, and undoubtedly young, who spoke of gentlemen getting laughed at, and caUed the company at a hunt \" the field.\" It was hardly fast talk \u2014 more likely, some lively and unconscious reflections of the paternal gossip. Then, again, he was told how he ought to hunt ! \u2014 he, a Helmsley, a man raised in the shires, and brought up to the sound of horn and hound ! Well, whatever it was, it sounded somehow new to him. Within his experience, young ladies \u2014 and, more especially, pretty young ladies \u2014 confined their responses at the dinner table to discreet and even sparing modulations of \" Yes \" and \" No.\" He freely confessed to himself that already he had been attracted to the young girl, by her appearance. And now, he had the further confession to make to himself that he would like to know something more of her. No doubt, he thought this in the calm and dispassionate interests of Inquiry. The yes-and-no young lady is abundant enough in all con science, and, when a new variety of the sex turns up, the opportunity for study should not be neglected. Accordingly, after such communings with himself \u2014 if we correctly interpret them \u2014 the young officer thought he would return to the charge. i"], [138, "130 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \"Are we to have another disappointment in store for us, at our ball, Miss Ogleby 1 \" \" Of what nature, Captain Helmsley ? An acceptance will be sent \u2014 so mamma says ; if that is what you mean.\" \"There are no parental injunctions ?\" \"None have been issued, as yet.\" \" And a man who wished to show his politeness would not get\u2014 laughed at ? \" \"At a ball? I am not an authority; I have never been to a real ball \u2014 only to some dancing parties. You are not to understand that a gentleman is not to be polite at a hunt \u2014 or that ladies are not thankful for assistance when they get it.\" The opening of that gate was present to her mind. The incident had not occurred at a period of the run when the huntsmen would be expected to devote their energies to the proper pursuit of the chase ; nor, indeed, had there been any thing ridiculous, or officious, in the act. She had told Mr. Annesley that she could have \" taken it,\" partly as a simple statement of a fact, and partly \u2014 well, yes, because she thought the young man would like to hear her say so. But this was not fair. A person in Mr. Annesley's hard case \u2014 this was what she thought \u2014 deserved some humouring. StiU, she should not make too unjust distinction between two of her father's guests. In fact, she felt a little ashamed of herself, hardly knowing in herself what other rules of propriety she had violated under doubtful impulses. So she continued : \" Do not ask me to lay down the law on any more abstruse subjects ; you must have been laughing at me all this time. I know nearly as httle about hunting matters as about balls.\" The young man protested against the charge. \" If you only knew how a fellow feels when he thinks he has done some thing which people may have laughed at, you would not"], [139, "THE DINNER AT MOUNT OGLEBY 131 lightly accuse him of following the example. I don't think you have a monopoly of the sense of ridicule you speak of in this country.\" \" Perhaps not. At all events, people can't put themselves in that position who do what is suitable to the occasion.\" \" For instance, we join the chase in order that we may follow the chase ? \" Kate laughed, in spite of her slight uneasiness. \" I won't lay down any more general rules, Captain Helmsley ; I am quite sure, now, they must sound very ridiculous. Only just try some of them yourself. When people go to a ball, now \u2014 what ought they to do ? \" \" Well, let me see,\" said the young man, accepting the challenge. \" I fancy they go in order that they may be mutually polite and agreeable to each other. Of course, it is different from a hunt. Now, I am laying down the law ; only, I think it hard of you to put it on me.\" \"I want to learn, you know.\" \" Oh ! You have nothing to learn. Young ladies have only to be agreeable, and \u2014 and nice, and their partners have to entertain them.\" Kate did not find her ease of mind returning. In making amends to the young man for her unfairness of the day, had she approached dangerously near to an opposite extreme ? Had she in any way brought this compliment \u2014 or implied compli ment \u2014 upon herself ? She was hardly displeased when she caught her mother's eye as a signal to rise from the table. In her youthful experience, this was quite a long and animated conversation with a gay and handsome young officer, and, for all she knew to the contrary, she might already be forming the subject of remark to others. Young women must be aUowed to have their sense of the ridiculous as well as young men."], [140, "132 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Besides, if their late discussion of \" law \" was good, the proper and becoming business at the dinner-table was to eat. The gentlemen made no unreasonable delay after the ladies. Where the host does not, in his own proper, or improper, person, set the example, even the hardened toper finds the practice uncomfortable. Colonel Cheviot was the first to suggest a move, and he was followed by the rest of the men. The Rev. Mr. Potter had taken possession of the music stool, and was running his fingers lightly over the notes of the piano. Presently, he broke out to the foUowing effect : THE HUNTING PARSON. i. A hunting parson once there was Who lived in these here parts. To all his flock he proved the cause Of much distress of hearts. AVith horse and hound he joined the rout, And hunting he would go ; Their daily wants he met with shout, \" Hark forward !\u2014 Tally ho ! \" II. They hied them to the Bishop's gate, To tell their tale of woe \u2014 ' ' The custom has declined of late : With him it seems to grow.\" And some stood out, and said, \"My lord, We 've not been christened yet \" ; And some, \"We sigh to wed, my lord, If we could parson get.\" III. And one old man, with tear in eye, Spoke last, when all were dumb, \" What's to become of me, when I Shall find mine hour come ? \""], [141, "THE DINNER AT MOUNT OGLEBS* 133 The Bishop's eye, too, filled at this ; \" I hunted once, 'tis true \u2014 But, since my marriage day, I miss No parish work to do. IV. \" I '11 christen those whose names I 've got ; I '11 marry all who sigh ; We '11 put the parson with that lot, The change on him to try.\" The Bishop took in hand each case ; The parson he was wed ; His son 's now curate in his place, And does his work instead. \" There 's a chance for you, lads,\" said the Colonel, address ing his brothers-in-arms, as the singer concluded. After that, songs of a more sentimental character were inquired for. \" It has surprised us,\" continued the Colonel, \" to find how rarely Moore's songs are heard here now. In private houses it has not been my fortune to find an instance ; even in public these songs grow more scarce. Yet, I 'm told, at one time they were found on every piano in the three kingdoms.\" \" I have seen it so stated,\" said Mrs. Ogleby. \" In fact, when I was a young girl their use was universal.\" \" Can this be accounted for ? \" asked the Colonel. \" Surely never were more polished words wedded to sweet music ! Is it merely the love of novelty 1 \" \"I think not, altogether,\" said Mrs. Ogleby, looking round on her eldest daughter for assistance as she proceeded with her explanation. \" Old English songs are often now heard in this country ; also Scottish songs \u2014 especially if they have not too much of the dialect, which Irish ladies, perhaps wisely, refrain from attempting. Moore's songs never reached the"], [142, "134 THE TURN OF THE TIDE masses ; probably, the polish you speak of prevented that. They always had their own ballad poetry \u2014 the work of in different hands, but it pleased them.\" \"But the 'classes' took up Moore,\" said Dr. Quilter, who now added his remark. \" It is the same with us in Scotland ; though, if I may be permitted an opinion, the workmanship of our popular ballads is of a superior character. But everywhere ' the people ' seem to prefer the rough diamond to the well-cut and sparkling gem.\" \" Certainly, Dr. Quilter, our classes, as you say, took up Moore, and they have now laid him aside. I think the expla nation must be sought in the unhappy movement which is taking place in the country itself. Moore's songs are pre eminently sentimental \u2014 we assert that this movement, in spite of its fierce intensity, is also so. Is it at all wonderful that those who hate the one should part company with the other ? \" \" Is that all, mamma ? \" said the wife of the young curate, who was turning over some sheets of music as her mother spoke these words, to which she was thus a listener. \" Well, my dear, you can add what you think deficient in the explanation,\" replied her mother. \"I have refrained from the political aspect, nearly as it touches us.\" \" I will give it to you, Colonel Cheviot,\" said Mrs. Potter, nothing daunted by her mother's forbearance. \" You must know \u2014 of course you do know \u2014 that Moore himself was more than tinged with this mutinous spirit \u2014 or, at all events, his poetry was. Well, this was permitted \u2014 pardoned, so long as the spirit itself was not entirely ignoble and contemptible. That has become its latter fate, and the appeals to higher feelings read grotesquely to us who associate them with the meanness of present man\u0153uvres.\" \"That is having it out with a vengeance,\" said her mother,"], [143, "THE DINNER AT MOUNT OGLEBY 135 though not without some trace of approval in her tone. \" True to the occasion, perhaps, Fanny \u2014 but hardly just to our national poet.\" Then, turning to Colonel Cheviot, she said \u2014 \" Moore did not write always in this spirit, which my daughter calls mutinous. Much of his poetry contains none of it at all ; and, as some penalty for her freedom of words, she and her sisters shaU sing one or more of those latter songs for you.\" Nothing loth, Mrs. Potter took her seat at the piano, and sang The Meeting of the Waters. This was found so entirely unobjectionable, that a further song was asked ; and, Mr. Potter himself joining in a quartette, I saw from the Beach was fairly rendered, with the assistance of the young ladies of the house. After that, Dr. Quilter favoured the company with one of his Scottish songs. Then, a movement for departure seemed imminent. \" I see you made it all right with him, again,\" said young Annesley, as he held Kate's hand for a moment at parting. \" Who is he ? \u2014 and what have I made all right with him ? \" \" Why \u2014 the fellow who opened the gate for you. You didn't seem half obliged to him, this morning.\" \" Didn't 1 1 Perhaps that was my own fault \u2014 I mean, that you should think so.\" \" Oh ! me \u2014 what have I to say to it ? \" \" But you ask me about it, now.

Then, when the hand had been resigned to its owner, had ensued these words of the foregoing conversation. He made no further effort to shake hands \u2014 people sometimes do go through the performance more than once, especially when a conversa tion, however short, intervenes. But he made no such second attempt, possibly because he knew it would not meet with success. He bowed instead \u2014 a rather contrite sort of bow \u2014 and then he went out, from the lighted porch, into the dark night."], [145, "CHAPTER XIII. DO YOU KNOW THE MAN? SO Charles Annesley went out into the dark night. How- ever, to some extent, the darkness had its existence rather in his own imagination. There were now two dogcarts on the gravel before the hall-door, each with its own pair of bright lamps. Nor was this all the brightness. Previous to the breaking-up, the owner of the Mount and Dr. Quilter had fallen into certain confabulations concerning their common Celtic origin, and it had been arranged that there was to be the doch an dhorras, or stirrup-cup, at this precise parting hour. Hence more lights \u2014 hence the whole household at the solemn ceremony \u2014 hence the uninterrupted, if not otherwise happy, conversation in the quiet and empty hall. The cere mony had not even concluded, and young Annesley took his share in it with the best grace he could. But Kate Ogleby had retired within doors, and was no more seen. Then the parting had taken place. It was but a couple of short mdes across the fields to Ballinteer House. The horse seemed to know his way so well that, mechanicaUy, the young man left him to his own action. Apparently, too, the darkness of the night had been the subject of some further exaggeration, for, now that all artificial lights were out of the way, the path was discernible enough. Young Annesley's thoughts were not of the pleasantest."], [146, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 138 He had taken the advice which had been offered to him, and had mingled with the gay and the careless ; and this had been the result ! True, he had also made a promise to mend his manners \u2014 and this, perhaps, he had not yet accomplished. What did it all matter ? And what girl, in her senses, would prefer the vanquished victim of Irish combination to the heir of an English estate, passing a few years of easy and pleasant service among his equally light-hearted companions ? He had formed some resolutions, which he had kept rather in the letter than in the spirit. One resolve remained, whose letter and spirit must both be seen to an end now. He would leave affairs here to their own good or ill-luck, and carry himself and his humours elsewhere. Amid such communings, the young man had reached the gate leading to Ballinteer House. He was dismounting for the purpose of opening it, when he perceived a figure appar ently in the act of performing that service for him. \" Is it Larry ? \" An answer in the negative was returned. Then, after a pause, the person added, \" It mightn't serve Larry to be seen alone at this time of night.\" Already had Charles Annesley stated that he had no fears for himself, personally. He had acted up to this statement by refusing \"protection.\" Possibly, the reason that he gave was hardly a sufficient one \u2014 namely, that landlords had become too dangerous game. The truth is that, in all this outrage, indiscriminate as at first sight it might appear, there was, after a fashion, a sense of justice, sufficient for the unlearned masses to whom it was addressed. Without it, possibly, the whole network of enforced obedience would have been broken through. He had stated, quite truly, that the Annesleys had never been unpopular. Further, during the"], [147, "DO YOU KNOW THE MAN? 139 young man's own short rule, he had made no harsh or ex travagant demands ; on the contrary, such demands had been made on him, and when he had refused, the decree had gone forth that he should be \u2014 left alone. There was no mystery in all this. The decree had come from without ; it was the most extreme that its mischievous devisers dare enforce ; and that enforcement was maintained solely by the relentless punishment of the disobedient or remiss. \"Who are you, then? It appears to me that I know your voice.\" \"You've heard it before, Masther Charles.\" \" Rody, by Heaven ! What do you do here ? \" Rody was one of those field-hands who, in consequence of this same decree, had left the employment of Charles Annesley. This was now more than six months ago ; and Rody Heffernan had not since set foot on the ground. \" What am I doing here, Masther Charles ? Courting death, maybe. You know it 's death to disobey the orders that are upon us.\" \" We will not argue the question. All wrong is the result of some influence or another.

The chain is stronger and longer than you may think.\" \"Do the orders extend to them?\" \" They do, Masther Charles. A man's dog is not safe, if the man disobeys them.\" The information, horrible as it sounded, was not entirely new to the young owner of Ballinteer ; already, under other phases, it had been brought home to him.

Yes, others were culpable, too. But the resent ment of Charles Annesley was now directed to the man actually before him. At present, he indicated it by vouch safing no answer to the man's last words. Possibly, Rody himself thought that the situation needed some further explanation, for he proceeded \u2014 \" Besides, if I earned wages here, that would not procure us food. So much is known to all.\" \"And now you and your family get food?\" \" There is not too much of that going,\" was the man's reply. \" I would rather return to my employment, if I was allowed.

It was thought that the pressure that was brought to bear upon you would make you give in.\" \" What pressure ?

Nor was the light sufficient to ascertain whether he gave any other indication of an affirmative or negative character. His late master continued \u2014 \"The pressure itself was well devised enough.

There was even a tone of readiness \u2014 of relief, which carried conviction to the mind of the young owner of Ballinteer. Before he could reply, if such was his intention, Body again spoke \u2014 \" You said those that are answerable for these movements study how far they may dare. You said rightly, Masther Charles. It 's devil's work, and there 's devil's cunning in it. It wouldn't do to put that strain on me.\" \" Oh ! I recollect. Larry is some sort of relation of yours ?\" \" Of the wife's.\" \" Well, you 're not the man. You know who is ?\" \"I don't \u2014 we are never told. If it came to me, no one else would know it.

I got a bit of schooling \u2014 it wasn't much ; stiU, I know it was the monkey did that. Well, our monkeys are clever \u2014 devilish clever, if you like. The man himself doesn't know who gave him his orders ; you may not"], [150, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 142 believe me, but it 's true. Maybe, he was sent a bit of writing. Perhaps it was whispered into his ear in the dark. Or, he may have found some token, which he will understand.\" \" But you say a man has been told off?\" \" Yes ; we are let know so much. The rules have not been complied with \u2014 and then we are informed when arrangements have been made to meet that.\" Hitherto the man had spoken in an independent \u2014 almost, it might be said, a defiant tone. In these latter words of his it appeared to Annesley that, for the first time, there was evasion, and certainly a less confident sound. \"That may be ; possibly your wife has discovered more?\" However, Rody had not yet lost his spirit. \" Take my word as you get it, or leave it alone. Well, say it 's the wife's doing ; women may have opportunities ; we know no more than I have said. What was I telling you . WeU, it's the truth, Masther Charles. The hand which has got this job to do couldn't father its commands on one man more than another \u2014 more probably, on no man at all. More likely, it's just some token he has got, which he will under stand. A loaded revolver, now, for instance.\" \" He would understand that 1\" \" Yes \u2014 he would understand that. He will be a poor man, of course, like myself. Who would send home a revolver to him without payment? \u2014 and what would he want with a revolver? Well, whatever it is \u2014 and, mind you, I only gave the revolver as an instance \u2014 he '11 know what it means \u2014 and he '11 also know that he '11 have to do the job.\" \"Otherwise?\" \" Well, otherwise, some of us will have to look after him. As I said before, it 's a long chain, and a strong chain \u2014 but,"], [151, "DO YOU KNOW THE MAN? 143 what's more, it's an endless chain. Now, I've done my business \u2014 with some risk to myself.\" \" One word more, Rody. It is a cowardly and an accursed system. I have promised to say nothing of the dupes who have allowed themselves to be entangled in the net. You are not the man who got these orders \u2014 you do not know him \u2014 his instructions were conveyed to him with aU the stealthy cowardice which marks the system. All this you have said \u2014 and I accept your words. But you must know something more. You want to save life\u2014 so do I. What have you heard V \" I have told you. It was said that all hands at Ballinteer had not obeyed the orders which had gone out ; those who had done so were commended. Then, I knew the matter was not to he let drop.\" \"Who gave this commendation?\" \"I will not teU you. It led to my knowing as much as I do. That must satisfy.\" Rody had spoken in a defiant tone already ; then there had been less confidence, if not actual evasion. Now, these last words had a manner of their own, differing from the two previous ones. Annesley interpreted them to convey an obligation on the speaker passing man's command or man's machinations. \"Where was it given, then?\" But Charles Annesley found he was now addressing the night wind. Rody had disappeared into the surrounding darkness. Gravely reflecting over this unexpected interview, and considering what changes it should produce in his already half-formed plans, the young man hastened his way to the house.

Dismissing his faithful attendant for the night, with a caution to see to the security of the budding, he retired to his room, mainly for the purpose of further thought. It was time enough in the morning to take Larry into his counsel. No actual demonstration of force would be brought against them ; for more plausible applications he was now forewarned. \"Said I not truly!\" repeated the young man bitterly to himself \u2014 \"They shew us a system which is worked by cowardice, by treachery, and by fanaticism \u2014 and they ask us to recognise it as the well-grounded aspirations of a people !\""], [153, "CHAPTER XIV. MRS. POTTER FINDS MICK'S ORDER. IT was in a rather doubtful frame of mind that Mrs. Potter commenced her household and family labours on the morning after the dinner at Mount Ogleby. That was off her mind \u2014 and, in fact, had gone \"off\" very creditably to all parties concerned ; for Kate had been quite successful in hiding away her feelings of resentment, or whatever else they were, and all matters, even to the wind-up, and that doch-an dhorras at the very parting, if they did not actually sound like marriage-bells, might possibly have in them something of a premonitory tinkle of that sort. Certainly, the young clergy man's wife had observed the attention of Captain Helmsley, and, as certainly, she was free to confess the thought had previously struck her that Kate might not prove very obdurate if young Charles Annesley were similarly attentive. But what generous and liberal sister \u2014 especially if she has got a husband of her own \u2014 begrudges some field for selection to a young girl, or has fears for the proper manipulation of two, or even more, strings to her bow? Then, again, the Scotch doctor had certainly shown a predilection for discourse with Sophia.

Fairly con sidered, the recollections of the previous evening were pleasant K"], [154, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 146 and satisfactory. But then came the reflection that promised work had been deferred, which must now be taken in hand. She must now arrange with her husband how, and in what form, instructions were to be given to Mr. Darley on those points on which he had disclaimed further personal responsi bility. Then, on that very morning, came a second note from Mr. Darley. There was no further injunction as to secrecy. The writer assumed that all undertakings with him had been now perfected ; that is to say, that Mr. and Mrs. Potter had their preliminary talk, or talks, over the matter, and had then taken the Mount Ogleby people into their councils. Assuming all this to be done, Mr. Darley asked for a day to be named on which he would hold interviews with all interested, and receive from them the desired instructions. \" Perhaps, it is just as well so,\" said Mrs. Potter, after she had handed the note to her husband, and allowed a reasonable time to elapse for its perusal. \" I would hardly know how to begin all this family negotiation. Now, I have Mr. Darley's letter to commence upon.\" \" He says nothing at all about your father. Is he to take part in the famdy negotiation?\" \" There is nothing in the letter ; one may come to see now how Mr. Darley does his business.\" \" His professional modus operandi, as we should call it ? \" Yes. He tells people what they must do, and what they must not do, then he leaves to their own discretion everything outside that.\" \"A fair mixture of law and politeness. Isn't that it, Fanny?\" \"With a little self-preservation thrown in for his own sake. Of course, papa is not so much as mentioned in this will.\""], [155, "MRS. POTTER FINDS MICK'S ORDER 147 \" Except as papa ? \" \" Yes. Consequently, Mr. Darley is not to know anything of him professionaUy, when communicating with those whom the document purports to make legatees.\" \"That is a bit of the safety clause?\" \" I read it so. Outside that, he leaves us at liberty to make our own arrangements.\" \"That's where the politeness comes in. So far for the man of court and the man of caution ; I suppose we will hear the law when we all meet him. Now you have to make the arrangement with your family.\" \" I hardly think I can go out to Mount Ogleby to-day. At least, not in the early part of it. I must see Bridget.\" \" She doesn't enter into the family councils, Fanny ? \" \"No, dear. I am uneasy about her. I don't like the way matters are going on there.\" \" Is Mick giving trouble ? \" \" I cannot quite say. When I saw her last, I think she was half inclined to give me some more of her mind, but we were interrupted. Perhaps I may be able to tell you something definitely when I return.\" After that, Mrs. Potter made her way down the viUage to the small establishment of her former servant. The coast was tolerably clear now. Mick was away, probably on one of his expeditions as a carrier. There were no customers in the shop. In spite of her uneasiness, the young clergyman's wife had no intention of resuming the subject of their former conversation, on her own part. She had wit enough to see that the situation, up to the present at least, lay outside that boundary which it was her husband's wish that they should not cross in their dealings with their more humble acquaintances, unless voluntarily asked to"], [156, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 148 do so. But she trusted still further to her wit to ascertain, by observation and the use of her reasoning powers, whether the case really called for interference or assistance from her. Or, possibly, Bridget would constitute herself a more fuU exponent of the matter. The woman was seated idly in a chair, and her appearance further indicated depression of mind. \" You 've been crying again, Bridget. I suppose it 's Mick this time ? \" \" Yes, Miss Fanny, I 'm afraid it is.\" The woman had risen from her chair, and made an effort to disguise her emotion. She even succeeded in imparting some lightness of tone to a reply which was certainly not light itself. \"He 's been drinking again, you mean?\" \"No, ma'am; he doesn't drink \u2014 nor eat either, now.\" And then Bridget varied her performance with a sigh. Evidently, this phenomenal change in her husband's habits was the key note of the situation. \"Is he ill, Bridget?\" \" I know nothing the matter with him ; he doesn't tell me if he is.\" \" Where is he now ? \" \" He didn't tell me that, even \u2014 gone to town, may be, for goods. He can't keep easy, any place. When he 's here he wants to be somewhere else. As like as not, when he 's half way to town he '11 come back.\" \"There's something on his mind.\" \"That 'sit, Miss Fanny.\" \" And you don't know what it is ? \" \" I don't \u2014 I can't get a word out of him, at all.\" Then Bridget dismissed all disguise, and fairly wrung her hands. The wife of the young clergyman was honestly concerned."], [157, "MRS. POTTER FINDS MICK'S ORDER 149 If she attempted to probe this wound, it was in the sincere desire and hope to he of help to her former assistant and domestic. \"How long has this been going on?\" \" Not long. I didn't tell you of it when you were here before ; there was nothing to tell.\" \" You did speak uneasily even then, Bridget. Matters may have become worse ? \" \"They have become different. Mick laughed at my uneasi ness, then. He doesn't laugh, now.\" \"Do you think it's anything connected with your business \u2014 the falling off of customers, for instance \u2014 or something of that sort ? \" \" Much Mick knows about business \u2014 except to bring the goods when they 're wanted.

We look at these matters from our own point of view ; which we think to be the fair and honest one. We believe that people cannot set up their own rules of right and wrong, and carry them out on others. Besides, what begins in small matters may end in great and grave ones. Of course, I had no hope that your husband would take this view of the matter.\" \" I don't know that Mick takes views at all, Miss Fanny. Sometimes he does what 's wanted of him, like the horse he drives \u2014 more times he won't. What should he know about rights or wrongs, except what he 's told ?

The words and the action were not lost on the acute Mrs. Potter. \" You told me you hadn't his confidence, Bridget \u2014 or some thing to that effect?\" \" That is what I meant to say. He has told me nothing \u2014 and I know nothing \u2014 except what I guess.\" \"What do you guess?\" Mrs. Potter had now dismissed such delicacy as appeared to her to be over-nice, and consequently mistaken. The woman was in trouble, and she would help her \u2014 if she could. \"TeU me what is in your mind.\" \"I told you that we had to go with the times \u2014 with this movement, as you call it. When we get our orders, we have to obey them. I believe Mick has got an order, now \u2014 which he must obey.\" \" But you say you have been getting such orders, from time to time?\" Mrs. Potter did not want for conjecture as to the weight and gravity of the speaker's words. Had not the woman already made confession of her belief that the com paratively lighter injunctions had led to the heavier? Rather, her question was shaped in the hope that Bridget would still further continue her confidence toward her. It was a tangled web \u2014 beyond doubt, the poor woman herself was not in possession of the whole solution. But if she could be brought to tell from herself the extent of her knowledge, help might then be found. In any case, two heads were better than one ; and, when the known became equally shared between them, there was greater likelihood of reaching the unknown. \" Can you explain the difference, now ? \" she added. \" In some respects, yes. Before, when Mick got his in structions, he came straight with them to me. They were meant for me as well as for him.\" \"PracticaUy for you, I should say, Bridget. I have given"], [159, "MRS. POTTER FINDS MICK'S ORDER 151 my opinion on that, as far as I intend to go. The system is cruel and dishonest ; those who pretend to defend it can never get beyond \u2014 pretence.\" To these words Bridget made no direct reply, treating them \u2014 as, indeed, they sounded \u2014 as mere abstract and moral reflec tions of the speaker. \" I had to know all Mick knew,\" she continued, instead ; \" without that the business could not go on ; the orders would go out against us then. Well, Mick has something now on his mind, and he does not tell me. There is a difference in that.\" \" Certainly. It has nothing to say to the business. I think that may he assumed ; and it is something more serious, even to him. I think we have got as far as that, too. Can your guesses go any further? Do you know the nature of these new commands?\" \"I know not.\" \" Nor against whom they are directed ? \" The woman repeated her reply, \" I have told you aU I know, or even guess. My mind is too unsettled for thinking. As sure as my husband disobeys, so sure will the order be visited upon him \u2014 ay, and on me and my children. It 's the rule \u2014 you know that.\" Mrs. Potter was perfectly aware of the rule which enforced the system. But the time was passed for expressing agreement or disagreement with her humble companion. The woman knew no more. She had just confessed her present inability even for clear or continuous thought. Mrs. Potter herself must now rise to the occasion, and assume the lead in the investigation. \" Bridget, you don't expect much custom at this hour. We can close the door for a while at least,\" and, suiting the action"], [160, "152 THE TURN OF THE TIDE to the word, the lady bolted and barred the shop-door. Then she continued addressing the poor woman, but endeavouring, by her tone and manner, to reassure her as much as was in her power. \"Now, coUect your thoughts together as well as you can. When did you notice any change in Mick's manner ? Recollect, I was here last Friday, and you say it was after that.\" \"Very shortly after. I think you had not been gone above a few minutes. It almost seemed as if he had been waiting to see the shop empty.\" \" But customers came in just before I left ? \" \"Yes, Mrs. Fanny. They stopped only a short time, and after that, Mick came in.\" \"And then you noticed a change ? \" \" I did. At first I thought it was the old thing \u2014 you '11 understand ? \" \" And then you found it wasn't ? \" Mrs. Potter did indeed understand, and forbore to foUow out conjectures found groundless. Not quite so, however, Bridget. To her, apparently, the \" old thing \" was even less tasteful than the new. \" Yes, Mrs. Fanny. He sat down on that stool, but never opened his mouth \u2014 a way he has when he doesn't like to betray himseh. Then, the moment he got my back turned, he dived upstairs.\" \" Was that unusual ? \" \" It depends. When he 's able, he makes straight \u2014 as straight as he can \u2014 for upstairs, and stays there. If he happens to sit down, he stays there, too. There was no drink on him this time.\" \"Very well, Bridget. Don't teU me anything more at"], [161, "MRS. POTTER FINDS MICK'S ORDER 153 present, or two of us may get confused. Now, both of us will go upstairs.\" Suiting her action to her word, Mrs. Potter was already half-way up the short and narrow flight of steps which led, direct from the shop itself, to the upper region. Bridget followed, whether taken by this prompt and decisive pro ceeding, or reaUy desirous to comply with the wishes of her former mistress. The room itself was large, extending over the whole of the lower portion. Part of it had been turned into a store-room, and here were now such stores as accommodation could not be found for in the shop itself. The work of investigation appeared formidable enough, at first sight. But Mrs. Potter went at it with wiU and energy, and, truth to say, Bridget now gave her all the assistance in her power. This was very considerable in itself, for her experience at once enabled her to say whether bale or box had been disturbed and the contents disarranged. At length, Mrs. Potter had to confess her failure. When all had been thoroughly ransacked, no cause was apparent why Mick had made it the first object of his \"dive.\" \"We will go downstairs again, Bridget,\" said Mrs. Potter. Arrived in the shop for the second time, and standing as nearly as possible in her former position, her next inquiry was \u2014 \" Now, Bridget, what did Mick do, after that ? Did he stay long upstairs ? \" \"I couldn't say, Mrs. Fanny.\" \" But he did come down again ? \" \"Yes \u2014 surely.\" \" Not so surely, it may be. If your first suspicions are correct\u2014 he wouldn't, perhaps. But he did?\" \"Oh, yes \u2014 he did. After a while, I heard him attending to the horse \u2014 doing him up for the night.\""], [162, "154 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" Without his coming into the shop again, or speaking to you ? That may have caused you to think, too ? \" \" It might. Anyway, Mick found his way out into the stable behind the house, without saying anything.\" \" And we wiU do so now,\" continued Mrs. Potter, again suiting her action to her word. The horse's stable was at the further extremity of the small yard. Its door was closed, and fastened \u2014 a circumstance which did not escape Mrs. Potter's ready reflection. \" You say your husband is gone to town, with the horse and cart ? \" \" He took them out of this, this morning. I think he 's really gone.\" \" Not impossible. Many people do secure the door when the steed is gone. You can open it, I suppose ? \" Bridget succeeded in doing so, and then the stable was subjected to a like search. \" I 've got it, at last,\" said Mrs. Potter, as she drew forth a six-chamber revolver from underneath some hay. The weapon was quite new, apparently unused, and f uUy loaded. \" That 's Mick's order \u2014 and an ugly one it is.\" Bridget gave a cry, which attested the sincerity of her surprise and concern. \" Put it away, Miss Fanny \u2014 it 's sure to go off.\" \"Not likely, Bridget. I wouldn't be my father's daughter if I couldn't handle firearms safely.\" Then a new alarm took hold of the woman. \"You won't let any harm come to Mick?\" she pleaded, piteously. \" Not for your sake \u2014 if I can help it, Bridget. But I am nearly at the end of my devices. I wish dearly I could teach your husband a lesson, without injuring you and the children \u2014 but I suppose I can't. And, yet, helping you means so much ! We are not fools ; we ought to know \u2014 we do know,"], [163, "MRS. POTTER FINDS MICK'S ORDER 155 what all this was intended for. This was a particular command ; your own suspicions \u2014 your husband's manner of late \u2014 this deadly weapon made ready to do its work \u2014 all these things teU us that the life of some particular person was to be taken.\" \" Mick carries grudge against no one,\" still pleaded the poor woman. \" Ay \u2014 just so. That is the cold-blooded villainy of the whole system. Provocation is no justification for the taking away of hfe. StiU, without provocation the demoralisation is all the greater. Well, I must do the best I can, in the situa tion I have brought myself into.\" Then, Mrs. Potter was sUent awhile, with the revolver still in her hand. Bridget stood by shuddering, while her young mistress carefully inspected the weapon, raising the hammers in succes sion, and letting them fall gently back into their places again, in a manner to reflect credit on her early raining, and the sporting house out of which she had come. To Bridget the operation seemed to take an age ; in reality, Mrs. Potter was seeking time for thought. She had used no words of exaggera tion ; action, of any kind, on her part did indeed \" mean much,\" and she could only see her way now to obviate im mediate dangers, trusting to further reflection, and the advice of others, for more effectual remedies. \" Go into the shop, Bridget \u2014 and bring me a paper of your pins.\" \"And leave you here alone with that ! \" \" Yes, Bridget ; I am hardly so clumsy as to shoot myself \u2014 though I might shoot another.\" The woman complied with the injunction, and presently returned. Short as was her absence, Mrs. Potter was already leaving the stable."], [164, "156 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" I found I had enough pins about me. It 's all right, now. I '11 see that your husband harms not himself \u2014 nor any one else.\" With which mysterious words, Mrs. Potter returned to the shop, and the door was again opened for custom. She had effectually \" spiked \" the weapon."], [165, "CHAPTER XV. THE OFFICERS' BALL. IN the meantime, the period fixed for the officers' ball at the Curragh had come round. Between the Curragh and the secluded village of Ballyfair there was hardly any practical intercourse. Though not very far apart, they lay in different counties, and each had its own independent ways of communi cation with Dublin. The present entertainment was in return for a series of hospitalities shown to the officers by the gentry of all the surrounding district. Invitations had been issued for a considerable time previously, and the preparations them selves were also the work of time. Thus, the event itself was looked forward to as rather a big thing of its kind. The ball-room itself was certainly worthy of the labours which had been bestowed upon it, and the expectations which had been formed. As Lieutenant Gatesby, to whose superinten dence had been entrusted such matters, took a final look-in, previous to making preparations on himself for the occasion, the general effect was complete and satisfactory. The apart ment was now empty with the exception of the musicians, who were already beginning to take their places and arrange their music in a smaU impromptu gallery erected for the occasion ; but there was goodly promise of that fuller completion when the guests themselves, the music, and the mazy movements of the dance should contribute their several and conjoint attrac-"], [166, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 158 tions to the scene. Quantities of bright and glittering arms had been arranged along the waUs in curious and tasteful devices \u2014 swords here, bayonets there. The colours of more than one regiment drooped gracefully from either end, and, high overhead, gay bunting crossed the room at several intervals. \" I don't think we 've done so badly,\" said Lieutenant Gatesby to his companion in the superintendence \u2014 Lieutenant Horner \u2014 as he brought his eyeglass to bear on these various embeUishments of the ball-room. \"I don't think we could do better,\" was the reply of Lieutenant Horner, whose office had consisted in according to the skUled workmen permission to carry out suggestions, which there was considerable difficulty in understanding. Then, the two gentlemen made a precipitate retreat ; for, though it wanted some half -hour of the expected time of assembhng, yet there was the possibility of some prematurely early guest making an appearance. No such possibility did take place. Those who know what is expected of them, nicely calculate their time of arriving from available data. Thus, a long invitation, and generally diffused expectations, give, as a result, a pretty late hour. In fact, there was no one to appreciate the labours of Lieutenants Gatesby and Horner until ten o'clock, though after that hour the arrivals were rapid and continuous. To Kate Ogleby, the scene was indeed charming; though also, perhaps, alarmingly formal to her first experience. The ball had opened with a quadrille \u2014 so much had been conceded to the supposed antiquarian tastes of a country district \u2014 hi which only some of the higher magnates of the neighbourhood were taking part. The people from the Mount had arrived in the middle of this performance, which was certainly a little"], [167, "THE OFFICERS' BALL 159 slow, and the young girl had no knowledge yet how all this would pass away under proper management and discreetly controlled exhilaration. Nor was her first alarm diminished by finding a number of young men gathering round her, with clamorous demands for places on her card. A larger experience and more developed powers of coquetry might have given a more careful and judicious selection. But Kate saw nothing for it now but a virtual abandonment of the card, and when she got it back again it was filled up. \" You shouldn't let those feUows have their way,\" said Captain Helmsley, who had not secured the first place. \" You told me I had nothing to do at aU.\" \" Oh, when we talked over the matter ! What did I say ?\" \" I suppose you forget all about it.\" \" No, I don't. I told you you had only to be agreeable, and \u2014 and the other thing, you know.\" But Kate did not express her knowledge ; and, indeed, was looking somewhat confused. \" Well, I needn't have told you at all \u2014 it was only my fun. But I ought to have put you on your guard about partners.\" Then, Captain Helmsley was obliged to go and find his own particular partner for the coming dance, and Lieutenant Horner, who had secured the first place on her card, came to claim the engagement. \"Will I have to dance with all whose names are here?\" inquired Kate of him, half seriously. \" I 'm afraid you will ; unless you can invent some excuse or another ; even then, you would have to sit it out with the fellow.\" \"What is that?\" said the young girl, betraying an ignorance which Lieutenant Horner was not prepared for. \" Oh, it 's not so bad at aU ! that is if you like the fellow,"], [168, "160 THE TURN OF THE TIDE you know ; besides, we have arranged some nice conservatories for that purpose. Now, generally, the stairs have to be utUised, or an open, though highly-congested, doorway. You see, you should not have allowed all these people to humbug you.\" \" But you are one of them yourself ! \" said Kate, by this time drawn out of her seriousness. \" Oh, Miss Ogleby, what a thing for you to say ! I told you at the Mount I was looking forward to the first waltz with you \u2014 you must recoUect?\" Kate did recollect some talk of the kind. \" But I didn't say anything.\" \" No. Of course, you know what that means. Besides I 've worked so hard. I and Gatesby did all this \" \u2014 and he took in the general embeUishments with a wave of his hand. \" Of course, we had a lot of men under us.\" \" You woidd require much assistance. I have never seen anything like it before. This is my first real ball, you know.\" By this time the music of the waltz had begun, and, presently, movement put an end to sustained conversation. Not but \"square dances\" maintained their occasional position on the programme throughout, when conversation, if subject to interruption, was not entirely eliminated even to those who took part in them. \" I don't think I have sufficiently apologised to you for all the trouble I must have put you to.\" It was Dr. Quilter who thus addressed his partner, Sophia Ogleby, in the pauses of \" The Lancers,\" at a subsequent period of the evening. \"About those airs? No apology at all was necessary; I had most of them by me.\" \" I possess quite a collection now.\" \" I hope some of mine were new to you.\""], [169, "THE OFFICERS' BALL 161 \" Yes, a good many ; even the old ones are interesting, from being under different arrangements. If I recollect aright, I think Moore said he had used up all the best airs of the country.\" \"I suppose he meant all that were generally known then. Some collections have been published since. Do you intend to publish yourself, Dr. Quilter ? \" \" I hardly know yet.\" Then it came to the turn of Dr. Quilter and his partner to go \" visiting,\" and the thread of their discourse was broken. So far, Kate was getting very conscientiously through her programme. She had not invented any excuse, and would not confess, even to herself, that she felt at aU tired. But a particular portion of the programme was now being approached, which made her a little nervous. Young Annesley had been among those who, at the first rush, had filled up her card. He had not taken too much upon himself ; he had not secured a very high place, but neither had he allowed himself to be deferred to less-known claimants. All this was very correct. To have done less would have been a slight to the young lady herself. To have done more might appear an insolent oblivion of his late conduct, without any previous word of explanation for it. So far, his course of proceeding had been exemplary enough. But Kate did not know what was going to happen next. Was the explanation of this previous conduct to come now ? Truly and reaUy she hoped not. She was quite getting over her first alarms as to baU-room exigencies and demands. Everyone was so attentive, and the attentions had left her so little time to think of herself, that she had well-nigh forgotten all about these early apprehensions. But still it was her first ball, and she continued under the impression that its ceremonious requirements could not be safely mixed up with other and L"], [170, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 162 different considerations. Captain Helmsley had told her that she had only to be agreeable and look nice. But she had already been long enough in the room to know that her compliance with his views, even if within her capacities, might not insure her from awkward, and possibly false, positions. It was not quite like an evening party, say at her father's house, where girls could be more at their ease, and even repay this \" humbug \" of the gentlemen with some of their own coin. Here she had to play a propriety which, there, would be out of place. Then, again, at her father's house, when the young master of Ballinteer did take her to task, in an unjustifiable manner it is true, she had not acquitted herself at all to her satisfaction. She had made an exhibition of her feelings, and the impression on her mind was that she had not escaped notice. What if there was to be anything of that nature now, with the eyes of several hundreds of people upon them ! However, Kate in her resentment, if she had any still, was not fair to Charles Annesley. He, too, knew that a public assembly was not the occasion for any such explanation. To be sure \u2014 and this also he knew \u2014 a cooler and an older head might find occasion for a few contrite words, an ingenious representation of the event itself in a new light \u2014 anything, in fact, which might make matters \" all right \" again. But to say nothing of his lack of the necessary maturity, he was aware that his feelings were too much interested for the still more essential lightness of touch which was due to the situation as well as to the young lady herself. Nevertheless, words had to be said, and the past itself could not be entirely suppressed or ignored. \" I was much disappointed at not meeting you at the Mount, when I called.\" The opportunity for these words, which hardly satisfied the wishes of the speaker, had not come soon, for Kate"], [171, "THE OFFICERS' BALL 163 had put on all her self-possession, and was already a pattern of ball-room deportment. \" I heard you called. I had gone over to my sister's.\" \"Yes ; it was a disappointment, for more reasons than one. Of course, the fact of your having gone over to your sister's explains why I did not see you.\" Then, Charles Annesley saw, or thought he saw, some want of attention on his partner's side. It may be that the exigen cies of the dance absorbed that attention, or \u2014 what more likely? \u2014 his tentative approach toward conversation lacked interest for her. The dance itself would terminate, and then more inspired thoughts might come. The termination of that particular dance certainly did come, and, though Kate requested to be brought back to her mother, with a propriety in excess of her ball-room experience, Charles Annesley found himself so far inspired as to suggest a turn through the impromptu conservatories. Kate hesitated, and then took his arm. A good many couples were really \" sitting it out \" there, whether as the necessary alternative of declining Terpsichorean exertions for the time, or actuaUy preferring those attractions which Lieutenants Horner and Gatesby had provided for them. Charles Annesley procured his partner a chair, after some search, in the course of which he came across Lieutenant Gatesby, looking somewhat hurried, and apparently having a search of his own. \" Oh, Mr. Annesley, have you seen Miss Ogleby ? It is our dance, and nobody knows where she is, not even her mother.\" \"There are two Miss Oglebys,\" said the carrier of the chair. \"Yes ; I mean the one you took out for the last dance ; so Mrs. Ogleby tells me.\""], [172, "164 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" We did dance the last dance together. Miss Ogleby has been dancing all the evening, and is, I think, a little tired.\" Here Charles Annesley obtruded the chair upon the attention of the young officer. \"So sorry; it's all the fault of those fellows who filled up her programme. I 'U have to put in my claim, you know.\" This was so reasonable a statement that Charles Annesley had nothing new to interpose, and led the way to his late partner ; but he knew that he had played his last card, unsuccessfully. In fact, Kate, when appealed to, professed her ability to fulfil her present engagement with Lieutenant Gatesby. The young master of Ballinteer had certainly played his last card on that occasion, for no possible opportunity occurred during the remainder of the evening."], [173, "CHAPTER XVI. THE OLIVE BRANCH OF PEACE. WE must now take up the thread of our narrative where Mrs. Potter had left it, when, with still apprehensive mind, she turned from the humble emporium of Mrs. Malone. Notwithstanding Bridget's doubts as to her husband's move ments, arising from his mental disquiet, on this occasion at least he had carried out his purpose of visiting town. On trips of such a nature, Mick's hostelry, or usual place of call, was a smaU and obscure inn, in the immediate vicinity of Stony Batter. Here, the remains of an Older Dublin lay around; but modern changes have now traveUed so far eastward that, to most of the inhabi tants of the newer city, the very names of the streets of the older one are unknown. Nevertheless, the place has its customers ; especially is it patronised by the Meath and KUdare drovers and carriers. Having seen to his horse, Mick's next proceeding was to select \" the goods,\" with which he was to return on the following day. This necessarily brought him eastward, almost on the confines of the newer city itself. The task completed, the man indulged himself in a stroll through the more modern streets. The evening was now advanced, and the light of day had given place to the flare of gas. Especially was this the case in the public-houses, thronged almost to suffocation with their"], [174, "166 THE TURN OF THE TIDE votaries. Though not a very observant person, Mick perceived signs of more than ordinary activity and preparation for some coming event. Banners had been hung across the streets. More sedate, and apparently more reputable, citizens thronged the streets themselves. But it was inside these public-houses that expectation was mainly on the stretch. In fact, the man had not been wholly unconscious of these indications before leaving his modest hostelry, and had put a question or two to his landlady. \" Sorra one of myself knows,\" had been the reply. \" They tell me the Olive Branch is coming over, and that we are going to get aU we ask. Anyway, you 'U find a stir in the town.\" What a commentary on the audacious assertions of these mischief-mongers ! Here were two of \" the people \" \u2014 one of them a sworn member of the movement itself \u2014 but both pro foundly ignorant of the very elements and public incidents of that cause which was being fought for them with their own money. Mick had found no enlightenment in the words. It is a more general, and thus a more remarkable fact, that the dupes, such as he, who were found to risk life and liberty, and so often to lose them, were indifferent to, as they were uninformed on, the motives and merits of the organisation into which they had been enlisted. Nor did his evening stroU help to much further information. Many of the occupants of these bar-rooms he knew to be foreign emissaries of that organisation. It was chiefly their money \u2014 that is, money entrusted to them \u2014 which supplied the drink, though they partook sparingly themselves. Intemperate they were to a man ; but their intemperance took another form \u2014 that of dare-devil compliance with the instructions they carried with them. Nearly all the rest of the company were sworn members of the movement, at least in their more noted"], [175, "THE OLIVE BRANCH OF PEACE 167 resorts, though occupying less confidential positions in it. Among all Mick received a ready recognition, the man being the medium of communication between the centre of the organi sation and his district. But, on this particular occasion, he was proof against temptation. Some men drink to drown care. With others, depression, or anxiety of mind, works differently. The man was now in one of his sober moods, and was cognisant of the fact that intoxication would add to the exposure of the deadly commands which were laid upon him. Nor was this all. Some more than ordinary and shocking event \u2014 some chapter in that \"history\" which the half-fanatic, half-crazy leaders, in their own bombastic language, were about to \" make,\" was imminent. So far learned the more humble dupe, though probably its precise nature was known to the very few. Thus it was a comparatively early period of the evening when Mick found himself again at his hostelry. He was now regaling himself with a hght supper, preparatory to retiring for the night's rest. The usual occupants of the house had not yet returned from their evening stroUs, and Mick's table, and, in fact, his end of the room, were untenanted, save by himself. The retirement bore a striking contrast to the bustle, flare, and drunken rowdyism of which he had been so lately a spectator. The man had concluded his homely repast when, on looking up, he found he was no longer alone. A person had seated himself on the opposite side of his small table, but with so little noise had the movement been accompanied that it was not until Mick's eye actuaUy encountered the figure he was aware of the fact. The stranger was clothed in clerical garb, but Mick knew he was no clergyman. What other information"], [176, "168 THE TURN OF THE TIDE was presented to his startled gaze may be inferred from the fact that the ordinary ruddy countenance of the carrier waxed some degrees paler. He was about to rise deferentially from his seat, when he was motioned into his place again. He opened his mouth to speak, but the intruder had the first word \u2014 \" We do not use names or ceremonies here. You know me \u2014 I know you. That will do for what we have to say.\" The stranger spoke in a low and quiet tone, which, however, he managed to make perfectly audible to the person he addressed. Thus repressed, Mick sat silently on his seat. There was even an appearance of dogged determination assuming the place of his late demeanour. Probably, the stranger noticed this, and wished to avert the consequences, for his next remark was of a more gracious character. \" I see you have concluded your meal. Have something to drink after it?\" \" I 'm off the drink,\" was Mick's scarcely gracious response. \" It may be best so. I wish some more of our men would follow the example.\" \"There's a few of 'em at it to-night,\" said Mick, who was apparently screwing up his courage to some show of re sistance. \" Yes,\" said the stranger, with an almost submissive sigh, \" we have to take men as they are. Besides, there is some work on hand to-night. Perhaps, after all, we couldn't get on without some indulgence of the sort.\" Mick was about to concur with this latter surmise, but, on reflection, was silent instead. It was plain that the two men were exchanging a few harmless thrusts, preparatory to a more close encounter of skill and strength. The stranger"], [177, "THE OLIVE BRANCH OF PEACE 169 seemed in no hurry to shorten the pause \u2014 it carried something impressive with it ; besides, even he might have need of all his tactics. When he did resume, his tone was perceptibly firmer, though still not unfriendly. \"You were about to make some further remark \u2014 perhaps to give some explanation of yourself? You cannot say but sufficient indulgence has been shown to you.\" \" The work shouldn't have been put upon me ; I was not the man for it.\" \" How were we to know that ? You talked big enough.\" \" It was the drink that was in me.\" \"As I said before, we leave our men to do their work in whatever way suits them best. Only, the work must be done \u2014 you know that?\" Mick inclined his head, in sullen acquiescence with the last remark. It did not suit the position he was now taking to add anything from himself. \" The work has to be done,\" further emphasized the stranger, \" and examples must be made. You have helped to bring the whole organisation into contempt.\" \" I suppose an example has to be made of me,\" said Mick, in a tone which hardly represented the courage which he was endeavouring to assume. The stranger made no reply. But, to the acute ears of Mick, something in the nature of a suppressed yawn was sufficiently audible, and probably restored the man to his former pitch of valour. \" Let me drop out of it altogether,\" he said. \" Absurd ! \" exclaimed the stranger. \" Have you ever heard of anyone 'dropping out,' as you say?\" \" Yes, some few.\" \" Good ! Where are they now ? \""], [178, "170 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" Oh, dead and buried. Of course, I know all about that.\" \" It would be your own fault if you did not,\" said the stranger, somewhat more briskly. \" You were told plainly enough when you joined ; and, for fear anyone should forget, we have an example now and again, to put them in mind.\" \" Well,\" said Mick, with a resignation which had not yet lost its firmness, \"I suppose I'll have to take my chance, like others. What do you want with me now ? \" For the first time the stranger turned a look of admiration, almost of approval, on his more humble companion. These were not the words of mere braggadocio \u2014 there was more of the sound of determination in them. The stranger himself had not been speaking idly \u2014 Mick would know that assuredly. The threats, the penalties, must have had terrible meaning for him, and yet he was facing them. Such resolve might not be of a very high or inteUigent order. But then, perhaps, the stranger was not at present in search of that superior article. \"Good again !\" he replied. \"I did not like to hurry you, because I have still hope of you. But time flies, and there is heavy work on hand. With to-morrow, a blow will ring through the civilised world which will show the sort of men we are \u2014 which will confound those that seek our confusion. We want no olive branches here ; they don't suit the climate ; at least, they don't suit us, who have got our living to make out of this here business. W7e '11 make them change from the kiss to the rod again \u2014 see if we don't.\" Mick had sufficient wit left to understand that the allusions now made were in reference to the outside preparations for the coming day. Nay, he could even recognise a more direct manner \u2014 one of less disguise than his unwelcome companion had yet exhibited to him. But, after all, was it wholly in-"], [179, "THE OLIVE BRANCH OF PEACE 171 tended for him ? Had the stranger, merely by accident, or, more likely, by excess of real feeling, thus for a moment displaced his mask ? The humbler man, however, was left little time for reflection, even if he had tho capacity to avail himself of it. The stranger returned to his more ordinary manner. \" Well, come \u2014 to business. We don't argue with men who have shirked their duty ; neither does that pay us, either. You have declined the task entrusted to you, and the time for explanation or amendment has passed \u2014 for ever.\" Notwithstanding Mick's rising courage, this declaration was a sore trial to it. The man's face waxed paler still, and his eyes seemed fascinated by the figure before him. However, he held his peace. \" We knew all that, before,\" pursued the stranger, who did not seem displeased by the effect his words were taking. \" I can remedy all that for you \u2014 if you will let me. We have work in hand \u2014 and one of our fellows has disappointed us. Confound the drink ! Most of you won't do the work without it, and sometimes you over-do it. This man will be worse than useless to-morrow. Take his place \u2014 and you wUl have recovered your lost ground.\" When the stranger concluded, a long pause ensued. Mick breathed heavily, and even uttered an occasional sigh. But the spirit of doggedness was growing upon him, instead of yielding to the stranger's words. \"I'll have no more of the work \u2014 I'm not the man for it,\" was his final resolve, slowly, but still deliberately, uttered. The stranger heard him with disappointment and displeasure, which, however, he still endeavoured to conceal. \" I won't accept your answer, now. You wiU think over it \u2014 and the consequences.\""], [180, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 172 \" I '11 take them. That is my answer.\" \"But I won't have it so,\" repeated the stranger. \"When do you start \u2014 for home?\" \" For home ? \" repeated the man, endeavouring to repress a shudder. \" First thing in the morning \u2014 I suppose I won't be allowed to get there ? \" \" Not to-morrow. You '11 do our work first, and then you '11 go home in safety. I 'U give you the night to think over it \u2014 you know where to find me in the morning. Recollect, it is not now as before we spoke. We do not tell men of plans they are not in. I have made your case worse than it was this morning \u2014 and therefore I must help you.\" \" All is safe in my hands \u2014 you know that,\" said Mick, using a plea for the first time. \" We know that \u2014 well,\" was the stranger's reply. \" Here, you are free to come, and free to go \u2014 but your comings and your goings are made known to us without failure. Yes, you are as safe as those who are already dead and buried.\" Mick hung his head at the implied insinuation. When he raised it again, the stranger had already reached the door, which he now closed quietly after him. Mick sat alone for some time afterwards. He was reviewing his position with all the calm and thought he could bring to bear upon it. \" Free ! \" repeated the man, bitterly, to himself. \" It 's a strange kind of freedom \u2014 but it 's true, for aU that. I can't feel the net, or see it \u2014 but I know it's round me.\" After that, he retired for the night. Whatever may have been his reflections and resolves through that night, he strictly complied with his intention, as intimated on the previous evening. \"The first thing in the morning\" he had his horse harnessed and yoked, and the goods on his dray. Several drovers and carriers showed the like activity on"], [181, "THE OLIVE BRANCH OF PEACE 173 their parts, and left about the same time. Presently, each took his separate road, and Mick was left alone to his. There are not many more beautiful roads leading out of the various cities of the world than that upon which he was now travelling. On one side ran the Upper Liffey, pure from all the contaminations which its lower portion traversed. On the other side were rising grounds, beautifully wooded. It was the opening Spring \u2014 the witching time of early May. The fair waters ran in their rocky and sounding channel. The birds sang melodiously in the trees under which he passed. Beyond all lay those lovely high lands \u2014 perhaps boastfuUy caUed mountains \u2014 which are the charm of the environs of Dublin. But the man heeded none of these beauties of Nature. For him, now, \" the soft magic of streamlet or hill \" had no attractions, if ever they had. Seated on his cart, with his pipe in his mouth, the reins in one hand, and the whip in the other, his chief object seemed to be to lengthen the distance between himself and the place of his departure. Howbeit, in his own way, the man was watchful enough. Many a glance he cast behind him over the road he had traversed ; and, as a more dense clump of trees was approached, all his vigilance seemed to be caUed into activity. That evening the horse, the dray, and the goods all arrived safely at the door of Bridget's emporium in Ballyfair. But there was no Mick. The roads were searched, and the man was found, lying dead, about half way on his journey from Dublin. To Bridget the loss was overwhelming and stunning for the time. To her neighbours around it was the source of mixed feelings, of which something more will have to be explained presently. But, to the world at large, the circumstance was"], [182, "174 THE TURN OF THE TIDE overlooked in the great and shocking event separated from it by so short a distance of time and space. After his fashion had the stranger given truthful intimation enough, \" We will make history on the morrow.\" The olive branch of peace had been indeed brought to the country, and the bringer had been foully and dastardly stricken down. That \" chapter of history \" stands as a record of the true aims and intentions of the leaders of the movement. They want no settlement ; against such this Ph\u0153nix Park outrage is their protest, which he who runs may read, and from which the morally blind only can derive no teaching. In other respects, too, this prophet of ill was correct in his vaticinations. The hand of the Government was forced ; the kiss was exchanged for the rod. No alter native presented itself.* We entreat the reader's indulgence for this introduction of a particular incident, in sketches professing to be more general reflections of current events. Let the temptation be our excuse. Our theme is, and shall be, the hollowness of this demand for settlement, whatever be its form or phase for the passing period. And some of our characters becoming entangled in so sad, and yet to us so convincing, a proof of our contention, we have thus strayed into abnormal ways. We now return to the more proper rules of our craft. * As Irish events have happened so rapidly within the last few years, perhaps the reader may be reminded that, in the spring of 1882, the Irish Viceroy and the Irish Chief Secretary resigned their respective posts, Earl Spencer and Lord Frederick Cavendish arriving in the country in their stead, with an avowed intention of a more conciliatory treatment of Irish disaffection. On 6th May, the new Lord-Lieutenant took his oaths of office at Dublin Castle, proceeding afterwards to the Viceregal Lodge, Ph\u0153nix Park, there to await Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke, the Under-Secretary. On the same evening these latter gentlemen were assassinated on their way thither."], [183, "CHAPTER XVII. \"/ WILL SEE FATHER FLANAGAN!' IT may well be believed that ordinary matters remained in abeyance, in and around the village of Ballyfair, for some days after the events recorded in our last chapter. In that chapter truth obliged us to make the remark that the death of Mick \u2014 -the pitiable condition of his widow, were the subject of mixed feelings to all around. But let us endeavour to be entirely true. Of course, from the free and independent \u2014 such as the surrounding gentry \u2014 there was sympathy and practical aid. Those on a nearer equality with the dead man and the living woman held themselves aloof. Was this mere abject fear \u2014 the fear of becoming entangled in that net whose terrors were so real and also so inevitable? We are glad to be able to think not entirely. The movement had become a popular one ; it is idle to deny that. Through every form and through every phase, the cunningness of greed, the promptings of vanity, had ever placed in the forefront some element of caption \u2014 religious, civil, or, as now, agrarian. Then there was the countenance of those leaders themselves \u2014 spiritual as well as secular. Naturally the people sought that. All that appeared to make for the movement came into favour ; for the contrary, there was condemnation. Saddest, blindest of all ! the condemnation extended from the supposed delinquent to each and aU of his belongings."], [184, "176 THE TURN OF THE TIDE With this very imperfect attempt to explain a complicated \u2014 perhaps we may say a forced and artificial state of affairs \u2014 we now resume our Ballyfairian narrative from the point where Mrs. Potter left the shop of her humble companion, after ascertaining for herself the deadly mission with which the woman's husband had been entrusted. She had done what she could \u2014 of course, as a merely temporary precaution \u2014 to arrest the fatal nature of that trust. But all experience told her that matters would not end here, supposing, as she did, that Mick would return in safety from his Dublin trip. It was her duty now to take others into her counsels, and thus to prepare for further consequences. Probably it has already been observed that those who show the greatest presence of mind in actual emergencies also suffer the greatest reaction afterwards. So it was now with Fanny Potter, as she made her way to her home on the morning of that discovery. When actually making the discovery itself, she had apparently treated the matter with some lightness. She had handled the deadly weapon as a sportsman handles his gun, while Bridget stood by and shuddered. She had not even put it aside, until she had rendered it of no avail for the time being. But when it was all over \u2014 or, rather, when she had left Bridget again in attendance on her cus tomers \u2014 then she herself felt the need of that assistance which she had just given with such apparent ease. After all, there were many worse counsellors than her own husband. That reverend gentleman might be given to the splitting of controversial straws ; but when there were no such straws to hand, when there were grave practical questions instead \u2014 above all, when life was at stake, she knew she would obtain from him attentive hearing, and very possibly discreet co-operation. Especially she felt that that"], [185, "\"I WILL SEE FATHER FLANAGAN\" 177 was what was now needed \u2014 discretion. Well she knew that the matter would not end here. A deadly mission had been entrusted to Bridget's husband. If he did not comply with the terms of it, Bridget and her children must suffer; such is the rule of the movement. Even still the work remains to be done ; that also is a rule of the movement. Then, again, she had made certain promises to Bridget herself, who, too, knew very well what those rules were. \" Call in the police \u2014 com municate with the still-constituted authorities of the land,\" some might say. But it did not need Mrs. Potter's penetra tion to know that such a course would place Bridget and her children absolutely outside the pale of civilization. She had promised that no harm would come, if she could help it. And this social ostracism, which pursues its victims to the very grave, was in the minds of both when the promise was passed. Thus it was that Mrs. Potter felt disappointment when she found that her husband was not at home. Whatever she did eventually, one thing was fixed in her mind ; he should have her first confidence, however long her wait might be. With no one else would she discuss that critical path she was now to tread between loyalty to her humble friends, and that vaguer loyalty to an abstract public. Her patience was not put to any severe test. The rev. gentleman arrived home in the course of the next few minutes. He had been doing some parochial visiting around Ballyfair. \"As I found myself in the neighbourhood of Ballinteer, I thought I might as weU look in on young Annesley. I heard something\u2014 -and I want your advice.\" But not even curiosity, nor the implied compliment to her helpful wisdom could enable her to wait longer. He should hear her own story first. Then, Mrs. Potter detailed her whole experience of that morning. M"], [186, "178 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" Have you any idea for whom the contents of that pistol were intended ? \" Mrs. Potter stated that her surmises had not assumed definite shape on that head. \"Mine have,\" added her husband. \"That is what I had to tell you about. I had a long conversation with Charles Annesley. He met a man in the grounds a few evenings ago, as he was returning from the Mount. The man does not appear to have had any hostile intentions \u2014 rather the contrary. He is one of those persons who were obhged to leave his employment at Ballinteer, in consequence of the orders which have gone forth. He told his late master that those orders were to be now more completely and thoroughly enforced. He did not say who was to enforce them \u2014 if I understand Annesley aright, he did not know. But there is certainly a coincidence between your story and my story.\" Mrs. Potter acknowledged as much. \"What does Mr. Annesley intend to do ? \" She herself did not yet know what she would do. Before she took action, naturally she desired to know what other actors were in the field. \" The young man has been always rather undecided. Can you wonder?\u2014 none of us like to yield to injustice and un warrantable interference.\" \" But for the present occasion ? He does not fear for him self?\" \"No. He says he has done no injury to any one.\" \"I suppose all who were in his employment could say the same. But those who left his employment have to subsist on charity ; and those who did not have now to be shot.\""], [187, "\"I WILL SEE FATHER FLANAGAN\" 179 \"That is the system \u2014 we know how it works. Annesley is to be left alone \u2014 merely alone. No, I don't think he has made up his mind yet what he will do. Sometimes, he talks of leaving the whole matter to settle itself. At others, he laughs, and says that would be paying too much deference to the mischief-mongers.\" \"Meaning that he ought to consult his own best interests only ? \" \" I think so ; something to that effect.\" \" Certainly, he is losing his time at Ballinteer at present ; practically, he has no interests to consult there.\" \"Ajid if these orders are to be still further enforced ; if you and I have really taken up two separate threads of the same tangle \u2014 well, then, it appears to me that an undecided course is the worse course. Have you reason to suppose that the place has any other attractions for him?\" To this question Mrs. Potter was obliged to confess to herself that there were \"decided\" objections to a plain and immediate answer. Such a reply might assume that which had really no truth to rest upon. It might even place her sister in a false position before others. Wherefore, with much apparent sim plicity, she parried the thrust. \" Other attractions, dear ! What previous ones have we been speaking of ? \" \" None, truly \u2014 I did not quite mean that. No doubt, Ballinteer is now what it looks \u2014 deserted and cheerless ; from all I hear, it must have been a very different sort of a place once. Yes, I suppose I must ascribe a certain reluctance to leave it \u2014 which I saw, or thought I saw \u2014 to that feehng I have just alluded to as common to us all.\" \"Resistance to dictation?\" \" Well, yes ; more especially where the dictation is palpably"], [188, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 180 unfair, and \u2014 and meant merely to insult. But why these questions about Annesley ? Must we not decide for ourselves ?\" Mrs. Potter explained. \"I wished to know what Mr. Annesley was about to do, in consequence of what he heard on the occasion you mention.\" \" We must tell him what we now know. I think there must be no hesitation about that.\" Mrs. Potter was obliged to confess that this was reasonable. \"Then, we will do nothing else until you have seen Mr. Annesley again ?\" The words were put interrogatively ; but, reaUy, they amounted to a suggestion, or perhaps even a request. In this latter sense Mr. Potter understood them. \"I will take so much responsibility upon myseh, if, after all, it is not the most proper course ; the matter concerns BaUinteer \u2014 I have now no doubt about that. I will go out there in the morning.\" It was now late and dark. All things considered, so delicate a mission might safely remain over night. So both thought. Had they known all, even further delay would seem to them free from peril. Mick would never handle again that, or any other, deadly weapon. If Larry was indeed to be shot, the fatal commands must be imposed on someone else. On that next morning, whUe Mr. Potter, after one or two imperative sick calls, was preparing for his visit to BaUinteer, news arrived of the return of the horse and dray without their owner. In the further course of the day, the whole of the \"incident\" \u2014 in the current language of the movement \u2014 was made known to Ballyfair. It has been said that the first effect of the blow was to stun the bereaved woman. Such a result is sufficiently within the limits of the expected. But, then, there foUowed that"], [189, "\"I WILL SEE FATHER FLANAGAN\" 181 which could only be so expected by those having practical acquaintance with the workings of the movement itself. The punishment for disobedience halted not at the grave \u2014 it pursued the widow and children of the dead man. We have already said that her own class held aloof from her ; but, purposely, we put it at its lightest \u2014 if we entered on the terrible theme of public demoralisation, it is not the taught but the teacher we must impugn. In reality, the feeling was more active than this. We also said a few words of explana tion, which, if for no other reason, must be similarly inadequate. However, in no case would it be easy to follow out the line of reasoning which arrived at such conclusion. Certain it was that the man had forfeited his life to a disobedience of orders. And it may be that there was a desire to express sympathy, or, more possibly, awe for those orders. We leave the fact itself to those fastidious persons who demand that a movement, as long as it can be called popular, should not be tried by rules of right and wrong, and whose optimism is so extreme that they waive aside the decalogue for their own ends. But Ballyfair was to be shocked, nevertheless. After the funeral, the woman had retired to her house, and there remained with her children. Active insult had ceased \u2014 but rigid suspension of aU business dealings had succeeded. If the widow had hopes of maintaining herself and her children by sale of her goods, the prospect was not tending in that direction. But the woman had given no expression of her views whatever. At the earnest request of Mr. and Mrs. Potter, she had opened her shop when a decent period of time had elapsed; they had not yet fully realised the situation ; but she herself had gone about it in a dazed, \u2022mechanical manner. The shop had remained open for some"], [190, "182 THE TURN OF THE TIDE days, without the appearance of a single customer of her own class, and was then closed again. A few days more, and a fresh change took place. Leaving her house, and walking up the street of the village until she arrived over against the young priest's house, the woman knelt down on the pavement and denounced him as the murderer of her husband, in the hearing of those villagers, in the hearing of Father Flanagan himself. After that, she retraced her way back, and again shut herself and her children up in their loneliness and desolation. No one had attempted to impede her movements ; she had spoken to no neighbour, as none had spoken to her. Only, she had raised her voice until all the terrible words had fallen clearly on the ears of the listeners. Why had the widow of the murdered man done this? Why had she selected her own clergyman for such a denunciation ? In her previous fears and forebodings, she had not hinted any thing of this to her former mistress. It seemed as if the woman had waked from her stupor with some half-forgotten recollection brought more vividly before her. Then she returned to her former silence. Either the idea was again lost, or she had no further explanation to give on the subject. Of course, no one attached any direct or hteral interpreta tion to the words. Even the opponents of Father Flanagan did not dream of that. Still, to all, the denunciation was a very terrible one. The actual murder itself had been received with a certain apathy, real or apparent. If men and women were shocked, they did not say so ; in fact, they said as little as possible that was pertinent to the subject. But this charge against a person holding his sacred office ! There was no reticence observed about that. The only one absolutely silent"], [191, "\"I WILL SEE FATHER FLANAGAN\" 183 was the person so denounced. He vouchsafed no explanation \u2014 did not even permit the subject to be discussed in his hearing. He went through his work as before, adding nothing \u2014 retracting nothing. In the meantime, what was to become of the dead man's widow and young children? That was a question more than once debated by Mrs. Potter and her husband, and even carried out, for further discussion, to Mount Ogleby. It was admitted by aU that the matter had its difficulties. These did not merely consist in the apathy and apparent indifference of the woman herself ; Mrs. Potter believed that she could sur mount this impediment. She had left her service to get married. But now that she had become a wife and a mother, there was a general consensus that her return to service would be a doubtful experiment. Finally, it was resolved that her little business should not be yet considered as entirely hopeless. Mrs. Potter and her class would do what they could in the way of custom. The unknown question was as to the eventual disposition of Bridget's own class. Trial had already been made with absolute failure. But then that was for a short time, and while aU was still fresh in the village. Could Mrs. Potter now induce the young woman to make a second trial ? And if Mrs. Potter succeeded in her effort \u2014 what then ? Would Ballyfair forget all that had happened? Bridget herself, in her mad moment, had done her worst to give a negative answer to this question. Be her charge true or false, she had certainly dashed herself against a wall of adamant. Still, there were other considerations tending toward a contrary view. Up to the present, Father Flanagan had exhibited no resentment whatever ; it was even doubtful if he regarded the matter as personal at all. This, and much more, were but \" incidents of the campaign,\" which each"], [192, "184 THE TURN OF THE TIDE member militant must hear, and continue to do his duty. Then, as regards this social ostracism under which Bridget and her children had, somewhat irrationally, fallen, that was simply compliance with an order ; and when the order was relaxed, the woman might have her customers again. \" I will see this man,\" said Mr. Potter to his wife, as the latter intimated her intention of inducing Bridget to resume business. \"What! see Father Flanagan!\" said Mrs. Potter. \" Yes. If the woman has made public a baseless accusation against her clergyman, he is entitled to a sufficiently full and humble retractation. I don't care who or what Father Flanagan is, that is his due. On the other hand, if this clergyman by any means has brought about the death of her husband, then let that be made public too.\" \" But, dear,\" explained Mrs. Potter, \" none of us under stand the matter in either of the ways you now mention. I think Bridget only meant that Father Flanagan had avowed his sympathy in this movement which has brought with it so much misery, including certainly the death of her husband. Father Flanagan makes no secret of that sympathy.\" \" That may be. I still believe there is something more. Father Flanagan loses no opportunity of avowing his co-opera tion with the system \u2014 you are right there. But it is hardly likely that Bridget, one of the people herself, knelt down and denounced a mere system ; she had something more particular in her mind than that. I told you the story I heard from Charles Annesley \u2014 how the orders against BaUinteer were to be fully and entirely enforced. At the time, I could only give you the substance of the conversation I had with the master of BaUinteer. But I have been since thinking it over, and I have recovered some of the details. Those who left his"], [193, "\"I WILL SEE FATHER FLANAGAN\" 185 employment were commended \u2014 that was one of them. Such as failed to' do so were \u2014 were \" \"Were what, dear?\" said Mrs. Potter. \"Were denounced; that is the point. After that, some man \u2014 I verily believe Mick \u2014 was told off to execute a certain act.\" \" That you do not attribute to Father Flanagan ?\" \" No \u2014 certainly not ; only the other thing.\" \" But Mr. Annesley merely met a man in his grounds late the evening before, who told him all this.\" \" Just so ; there may not be one word of truth in it. Wherefore, I will see Father Flanagan.\" Mrs. Potter enjoyed the reputation of \"managing\" her husband. But none knew better than herself that there was a limit beyond which her prudence did not aUow her to go. Thus, when he spoke as he had now done, she held her peace. In her own mind, the proposed undertaking seemed somewhat in the nature of a quixotic one. However, both the reverend gentlemen were well able to hold their own, and, as the forces evolved would be certainly of a spiritual character, they would probably separate none the worse for the encounter."], [194, ""], [195, "CHAPTER XVIII. THE TWO CURATES. OF the Catholic curate of Ballyfair it has been already said that he neither sought nor accepted sympathy, under the charge which had been so publicly made against him. To no one had he expressed a sense of injury, if he felt it, or of regret, if he felt that. Yet the whole scene had impressed itself indelibly on his mind \u2014 the mad woman (he thought her mad, and, for the time being, she was so) kneeling on the stones, his people listening awe-struck, the words of the accusa tion itself. Of the words themselves there was no possibility of mistake. He was accused of depriving the wife of her husband, the children of their father. The young man was a fanatic, even in his honesty. Against himself, he would return no evil for evil ; for his own sake, he would harm none of God's creatures. But for a cause \u2014 and a cause once espoused became holy in his sight \u2014 it was his duty to spare none, himself least of all. Yet now, within himself, he burned with hot indignation because some such act had been imputed to him. Did this woman think that with his own arm he had struck down her husband ? No ; fanaticism would never lead him to such lengths as that. Had he even a guilty knowledge of his assassination ? He could laugh at such a charge, and tell his people that bereavement had indeed unsettled the mind of the woman. But he did not laugh,"], [196, "188 THE TURN OF THE TIDE nor did he even defend himself on the plea of the woman's insanity. Doubtless his besetting infirmity was his gross, crass, indiscriminating ignorance. Taken from an humble home, he had gone to a seminary exclusively set apart to the training of young men intended for the same calling as himself. There he had, indeed, read books. But there is an insight which cannot be acquired from books ; it is got from home influences, and, later on, from intercourse with men, and more especially with women. Up to this hour the young man had no such opportunities. On rare occasions he came into personal contact with educated persons of both sexes. But, even on these occasions, mind and thought were separated by a fixed gulf between him and them. They played at intercourse, but there was no ease nor freedom. The older parish priest graduaUy does tone down, if there be any good at all in him. Possibly age itself, and by itself, brings with it this insight into human affairs as they reaUy and truly are, and not as prejudice, intolerance, and inexperience represent them to be. Still, an experience he had. He had been witness to suffering and distress, which he attributed to a merciless and, possibly, a gratuitous oppression. On the other hand, he saw luxury and dissipation, which he might be excused for calling heartless and wanton. On the real and actual problems of life he had never spent a thought; it may be that the want of training for the purpose rendered such thinking impossible to him. Our phUosophers do not, perhaps, make the best practical physicians. Still, when a man interferes in the temporal affairs of his neighbours, it is better that he should first inquire into the springs and motives of human action. Certainly, under any circumstances, he would have been \" thorough.\" But as"], [197, "THE TWO CURATES 189 patient investigation was now beyond his reach, he had constituted himself the furious partizan instead. The two curates had never met in intercourse, though intimately known to each other by appearance and report. It has been already said that the period was not so very distant when priest and parson met at the same council-table, and took upon themselves the common aUeviation of distress. Even that had now passed away. But probably at no time had a Catholic curate felt himself called upon to co-operate with a Protestant curate. We will say nothing about religious con siderations, we deem them outside the scope and treatment of such a work as this ; and, when we deal with clergymen, it is our earnest effort to confine ourselves to their temporal actions and interference. But, as between man and man, sympathy or fellowship was out of the question. This Protestant curate had his home, his wife, his children. Father Flanagan knew that these could not be his ; he fully recognised it as a working principle of his church that it should be so. But the fact, nevertheless, brought its antipathies. Again, Mr. Potter associated with the well-to-do, the intellectual, the refined. Father Flanagan's time was spent in going from hovel to hovel, administering the comforts of his church to the sick and the needy. What sympathy or feUowship could there be between two such men ? But especiaUy now was he disposed to resent a visit from Mr. Potter. Whether he had done right, or whether he had done wrong ; whatever portion of the charge of this woman was, in truth, to rest upon him \u2014 well he knew that he was already condemned in the mind and conscience of the Protes tant clergyman. Nor could he explain. He had certainly mixed up his spiritual functions with temporal interference ; and he could not yet show that good had come of it. Such an"], [198, "190 THE TURN OF THE TIDE explanation would be to repeat, and to admit, the very charge now in the mind of Mr. Potter. And yet he felt it hard. Never, for a moment, had he harboured thought of injury against the woman, or her husband. He had not so much as alluded to them. Yet now he was to be told that he had mingled together things human and divine, and that this had been the result. But regret or resentment was vain, for, already, he was face to face with this champion of spiritual singleness. \" I trust,\" said Mr. Potter, as he had now brought to trial the intimation he had given to his wife, \"you will allow a brother clergyman to express his sorrow at the sad turn which affairs have taken. We have had nothing like this in Bally fair before.\" Most assuredly, Father Flanagan did not recognise Mr. Potter as a clergyman at all. Still, the words were civilly spoken, and perhaps were also civilly meant ; it would not be wise on his part to take them as containing any innuendo condemnatory of himself. Wherefore, the hearer intimated his acceptance of them with as gracious an inclination of the head as he was capable of. \"As for this poor woman who has lost her husband,\" continued Mr. Potter \u2014 \"what she has done must be taken into consideration with what she has suffered.\" Father Flanagan was not so sure but an innuendo might lurk here ; in any case, it was excusing the deed somewhat at his expense. Nevertheless, a defensive position was his wisest, perhaps his only, position. Wherefore, he said \u2014 \" No doubt, both are very dreadful.\" \" Yes ; both are very dreadful ; perhaps I should have said so from myself \u2014 but I thought so. However, she suffered \u2014 first. Is it not fair to give that its due ? \""], [199, "TIIE TWO CURATES 191 \" You have already implied that in other words \u2014 and I have agreed with you. Have you any reason to suppose that the contrary has not been done ? \" Mr. Potter hastened to deny that he intended any such imputation \u2014 as, indeed, he did not. Certainly, to lighten the woman's offence had been uppermost in his mind \u2014 but only with a view to her pardon. In this, he had wholly overlooked the extreme present sensitiveness of his hearer. With similar oversight, and with a like pre-occupation of thought, he pro ceeded \u2014 \"Still, it gives me pleasure to hear you say that consideration has extended so far.\" The truth may as weU here be stated. With larger and broader experience \u2014 with superior advantages of engaging mind with mind \u2014 with more real and less sentimental ideas, Mr. Potter was hardly a match, in dialectic skill, for Father Flanagan. If the latter was not so apprehensive of another charge\u2014 was not so heavily weighted by consciousness of the weakness of his defence\u2014 above all, did not lose his temper through these unintentional irritations of his visitor \u2014 then it might be that Mrs. Potter's doubts as to the prudence of this interview on the part of her spouse were not ill founded. But already Father Flanagan was irritated. He was en gaged in a cause \u2014 not in spiteful or vindictive feelings against anyone. Yet, now, it was intimated to him that assurance to the contrary was required of him, and that such assurance \" gave pleasure.\" \"I am glad to hear that less harsh judgments prevail now,\" he permitted himself to say. \" Do I understand you to say so much ? \" Then, certainly, Mr. Potter saw his words might have another interpretation than that intended by him \u2014 might"], [200, "192 THE TURN OF THE TIDE convey accusation which could not be substantiated, which perhaps did not exist in fact. So much it was his duty to retract \u2014 \" Naturally, I and my people feel an interest in this young woman \u2014 she is still a young woman. By ourselves, we can hardly be of assistance to her. That is why I expressed pleasure at a prospect of returning goodwill.\" Father Flanagan bowed to the explanation, though certainly with no access of graciousness. Nor were his words of more amicable character. \" I cannot concede to you a monopoly of this interest. She and her unfortunate husband were both members of my flock. I have already expressed my absolute and unreserved regret at what has happened. It appeared to me \u2014 perhaps this also may admit of explanation \u2014 that you were about to suggest some justification of what followed 1 \" Yes, Father Flanagan was not at his ease, and, like persons in the same condition, was strangely impelled in the direction of his apprehension. It was his first, and greatest, mistake. Mr. Potter had not been about to suggest anything of the kind \u2014 but it was in his mind. Perhaps, this mental presence lent a tone or manner to the speaker \u2014 more possibly, Father Flanagan's own conscious apprehension raised the phantom. Anyway, the Rev. Mr. Potter was not the man to quibble between his thoughts and his expressions. That was the mistake Father Flanagan made. \" Justification is, perhaps, a strong word \u2014 I don't know that I had quite formed such an idea as that. I did point out that this woman's sufferings were sudden and terrible.\" \"And then you connected them with what she actually did ? \" \"Yes; I don't think I said so \u2014 but that was certainly in"], [201, "THE TWO CURATES 193 my mind. Remember, you are now obliging me to be thus outspoken.\" \" In order that you may see your injustice. You confess to associating \u2014 mentaUy, if you like \u2014 these two very shocking events ? \" \" Yes \u2014 the association was in my mind. Assume I have given expression to it ; I wish to meet you \u2014 now that you undertake to set me right.\" Father Flanagan was very nervous. But he made a great effort to keep cool \u2014 and with some success. Still, in argument, he thought himself the better man. \" You shaU judge for yourself. This woman's husband forfeited his life to the violated order of a secret society. You are aware of that \u2014 at least, as far as I am aware myself. To hint at any connection between such a society and a Catholic clergyman is \u2014 an insult.\" \" Of that, also, I am aware. Possibly, it is you now who are under some misapprehension. I did not intend any such imputation.\" But Mr. Potter meant something. Father Flanagan had now gone so far that he desired to know what that something was. To press no further would pass as a mark of cowardice \u2014 perhaps even of guilt. \" I have given you an opportunity to explain \u2014 am I to understand that you decline ? It is plain \u2014 you admit, you came here with some foregone conclusion in your mind ; I think I should be allowed to know what that is.\" \"I regret to say that your request appears to me to be reasonable. But you will understand that I am complying with a request ? \" Father Flanagan intimated that, so far, his visitor understood the position aright. N"], [202, "194 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" Then,\" said Mr. Potter, \" what I really meant was that this humble friend of ours attributed the death of her husband -indirectly, of course \u2014 to certain words spoken.\" \" By me ? \" \" Yes \u2014 by you. I don't know that, even at your request, I should explain further. You heard Bridget Malone yourself \u2014 you know what truth there is in her belief.\" \"This refers to the BaUinteer business?\" \" It does,\" said Mr. Potter. \" I spoke more than once on that subject. I spoke openly in the chapel, to my people. I could not deny anything I said, even if I were inclined to do so. Everywhere \u2014 outside the chapel \u2014 I have proclaimed my adhesion to the movement.\" \" I refer exclusively to words spoken within the chapel, during the period of divine service.\" \" With what words am I particularly charged ? \" \"You commended those who had obeyed the instructions given to them, and had broken off their connection with the young master of Ballinteer.\" \" It is a recognised rule of the movement. Again, I must repeat I have publicly adopted the movement, as thus em bodied in its rules.\" \" And I, too, must make the repetition that my reference is to proceedings in chapel, during service \u2014 exclusively.\" \" Those instructions emanated from an open and public body, of which I am a member. I drew the attention of my people to them, openly and publicly \" \" During the performance of your sacred office ? \" \" Yes. Is it not the custom to give notice on secular subjects in the Protestant Church, when approved of ? \" \" It is \u2014 within the limits of religious and moral improve ment. But the commendation was yours ? \""], [203, "THE TWO CURATES 195 \" Yes. That is a political question : our Church permits more latitude \u2014 we have to advise our people, where we can, and when we can. That is a political question, entirely outside any discussion between you and me \u2014 unless you could take my view of the matter. Certainly, I used those words.\" This latitude had been the subject of much discussion in Ireland. Warned by experience, and desirous to show example, the Protestant Church had long discountenanced political interference by its clergy. Perhaps, there was something in what Father Flanagan had just said. The people were ignorant \u2014 the need of guidance was more pressing. Most assuredly, Mr. Potter was not now going to discuss the matter. His charge lay altogether outside that. \" There is still more. You further referred to those who had not yet complied with these instructions ? \" \" Possibly. One statement infers the other. Who is the worse of all this ? \" \" But these further words are attributed to you. Then, this unfortunate man got his orders \" \" Emanating from a secret society, with which a Catholic clergyman cannot be connected.\" \" With which, I believe, a member of his flock ought not to be connected ? \" \" Yes, that is so,\" said Father Flanagan. He could no longer conceal his displeasure. Was it fair thus to throw in his face this neglect of the expressed commands of his Church on the part of members of his flock? \u2014 as if that was his fault, too ! But Mr. Potter heeded not. He had his duty to do \u2014 and do it now he would. \"It is surmised that the unfortunate man disobeyed those orders. At all events, he is now dead.\""], [204, "196 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Father Flanagan had no doubt, now, of the \" association \" of ideas in the mind of his visitor \u2014 if he ever had any. He made no further effort to conceal his resentment, as he replied \u2014 \"The bounds between moral and religious controversy are not appreciable to all; you have certainly not succeeded in observing them. Had I known that I was to be called to account in my character as a clergyman, and in my office as such, I must have declined this interview.\" It was his last card ; and, as he played it, he was quite conscious that it was not a trump. Nevertheless, he played it with some show of boldness, and even formality. Mr. Potter was confident, too, as he made reply, and even more formal. \" It has been my habit to set such bounds to myself, very strictly. More especially on the present occasion have I been slow to overstep the limits of moral discussion. On this ground I hoped to meet you, but you have preferred to defend yourself on a spiritual one. Still, you have failed to convince me that the office absolves the man.\" What form of answer Father Flanagan was about to return it would be now impossible to say, except that his looks and attitude were not indicative of returning goodwiU ; for, just at that moment, a loud rat-tat-ta-tat was heard from the front door, and that gentleman had opened his mouth only to close it again. In another moment, Father Doyle, the actual priest of the parish, entered the room. He was a large, heavy old man, though not nearly so infirm as the Protestant parson, Mr. Stackpoole. He, too, had sprung from the farming \u2014 or, more possibly, the peasant class. But age, experience, and, perhaps, an original stock of good sense, had conferred upon him a manner and address which was not without some dignity. His surprise to find himself face to face with Mr. Potter, the"], [205, "THE TWO CURATES 197 Protestant curate, was too great for entire concealment, nor was it destitute of a trace of disappointment. However, his good sense came to his aid, and enabled him to convert an impending defeat into a success. Father Flanagan alone dis played the awkwardness of the situation. Just now, he had no mind to meet his parish priest \u2014 least of all in the presence of a member of another church. Explanations were hardly needed, even if they could be made with strict regard to the feelings of all persons. But Father Doyle had pretty accurately taken in the whole scene at a glance. Mr. Potter prepared to take his leave as soon as courtesy permitted. The parish priest seized the opportunity he was waiting for, and accompanied him to the door. \" Is it about this unfortunate woman and her children ? Will you prevail on her to resume her little business ? I will do the rest myself.\" Father Doyle had a hold of Mr. Potter's hand as he said these words ; and, probably, as further explanation, he gave the hand a squeeze. Mr. Potter readily \u2014 and, in fact, grate fully \u2014 returned the pressure, and then went his way. \" Well ? \" said Mrs. Potter, as her husband made his reappearance. \"All is well that ends well,\" said the reverend gentleman, at a loss for a more original remark. \" Not but you were right, too. I could make nothing of Father Flanagan \u2014 except, I believe, to exasperate him.\" \"What, then, is well?\" After that, Mr. Potter explained the practical result of his visit. \"Father Doyle dropped in on us, and found us hammer and tongs together. He settled the whole matter in half-a-"], [206, "198 THE TURN OF THE TIDE dozen words \u2014 that is, with me. I don't know what he said, afterwards, to Father Flanagan. As everything was at white heat, I suspect they went at it, too. Never mind \u2014 I have Father Doyle's promise, and that is as good as gold. Bridget is to open her shop again \u2014 we must make her do it ; you will understand that, Fanny ? Then the customers will come back again. I didn't inquire how it 's going to be done \u2014 I hadn't time, and I wouldn't if I had. I had Father Doyle's word for it. Is not that well ? \" \" She has lost her husband, Patrick ; her children are fatherless.\" \" Alas ! that is so. I wish Father Doyle would come here, and stay here. What is done cannot be undone ; but, for the future, the peacemaker would supersede the mischief-monger.\" Possibly, for once in a way, the reverend gentleman regretted those \" bounds \" which he had so severely set to himself. \" The Pastor in his Place \u2014 and Out of It,\" appeared to him to furnish a subject seasonable, and even useful, for dissertation."], [207, "CHAPTER XIX. FATHER DOYLE GOES TO BALLINTEER. OF Father Flanagan a word has already been said. Of Father Doyle a word, too, may here be permitted. On men of his position, disposition, and tendency under circum stances, wiU depend the solution of the Irish problem, if it is to have any solution worthy of the name. He was naturally good-natured. Age and experience had caused him to modify many early opinions and aspirations. Brute force was inexpressibly shocking to him. The champion of his people he was ; but such championship as that of Father Flanagan he viewed with regret, which, up to the present moment, he had kept silent. Why this silence ? Probably the old man could not give an explanation, even to himself. Though old, his opinions were actually stUl in course of modification. Great things and good things had been promised from a bold front, an uncom promising demand. Father Doyle had seen none of these great and good things come to pass, his people were now in a far sadder plight than before. Was he, then, to stand out alone, and condemn a movement which his order had not yet condemned? A hero might do it, but there was nothing heroic about Father Doyle. His horror of outrage has been already hinted. Possibly, a constitutional lack of physical courage had something to say to that."], [208, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 200 At length this silence had now been broken, as far as his promise to Mr. Potter was concerned. What passed between him and Father Flanagan in that room, when Mr. Potter left, was never known. What passed between him and his flock on the following Sunday was known only to them selves, and kept to themselves. But when Bridget, after much persuasion, again opened her shop, matters were allowed to proceed much as they had done before the day her husband had taken those terrible and fatal orders upon himself. So far, there had not been a moment's hesitation of mind on the part of Father Doyle. Something altogether deplorable and shocking had happened, and the parish priest had hastened from a distance to return to Ballyfair on inteUigence reaching him. He had proceeded direct to the residence of Father Flanagan, and was himself not pleasantly surprised to meet there the Protestant curate. How he turned this awkward meeting to suit the purpose he had in hand has already been described. After that there was hesitation. He had now to reflect \u2014 to reason with himself; and his late action had been rather in the nature of an impulse. He would do it again \u2014 a thousand times more if the necessity for it arose ; but, never theless, the action had been performed instinctively. WTien it was done, and with such success as was now possible, his reason became more active and more suggestive. Such another terrible incident might happen again ; the snake was scotched, not killed. This Ballyfair scandal had been but an outcome of the plague spot which adjoined it; any day another outrage, another scandal might follow. Thus sadly, hesitatingly, almost reluctantly, Father Doyle found it his duty to turn his attention to the state of affairs at Ballinteer."], [209, "FATHER DOYLE GOES TO BALLINTEER 201 Of course, in a sense, his attention had never been off it since relations had ceased between the owner and the occupants of the estate. He had been told that he ought not to stand between his people and those certain steps which were to better their condition. Of the certainty he had his own doubts ; but his people themselves had been argued over that, and had given him to understand that they would at least make the trial. So matters had gone on and on ; and now had come this outrage on human life, and this scandal connecting it \u2014 however remotely, or even inconsequently \u2014 with his cloth. His people had made their trial, and were not now so confident \u2014 that he knew. But what were they to do, unless they made absolute and abject surrender ? Those who had brought them to this pass would not so much as lift a finger to bring about a fair and honest settlement, nay \u2014 would set outrage again to work to prevent it. In his heart of hearts Father Doyle knew that also. Abject surrender he would not advise, he would be no party to. But between that and the present state of affairs there was plenty of room for mediation. No one yet had approached the owner of Ballinteer, except to insult him with impossible demands. He himself had proposed to do so, but had been met by the impediments already referred to. What if he took it upon him now to do so ? In no other way could the possible basis of a compromise be ascertained. Yes, as the friend and advocate of his people\u2014 sincere, if not otherwise qualified \u2014 he would ask for an interview with Charles Annesley. When he knew what concession it was possible for the young man to make \u2014 and there was reasonable hope of such being made \u2014 he would again press his proposal upon his people. When Father Doyle had somewhat laboriously thought out the matter"], [210, "202 THE TURN OF THE TIDE to this point, he sat down and wrote a note to the young man himself. The reader last saw BaUinteer at an unfavourable season of the year, and an untoward condition of affairs. When the officers of the hunt obtained shelter, and such hospitality as was possible there, winter had not yet suspended its reign. Spring was now advanced ; but, truth to say, its brightness made only more apparent those other conditions of the case which exhibited no like change. With spring we expect to see some work taken up \u2014 some active preparations for that harvest which is to provide man with his temporal sustenance. But here no such signs struck eye or ear. The trees came forth into leaf \u2014 the birds sang their seasonable carols \u2014 but men went not forth to their daily toil. It had not been always so \u2014 it had not been so long. In those times now passed, Ballinteer had been busy in the pursuit of this necessary toil, and also busy in the pursuit of pleasure. The ploughman turned the spring sod. The huntsman's horn enlivened wood and vale, hUl and down. The \" big house \" itself was filled with guests and their entertainers. Ballinteer House had been built at a time when a rage for big houses and profuse hospitality seemed to have seized upon the Irish gentry. The estate was certainly a large one ; and, perhaps, this might be said, that the Annesley of the day could hardly, with credit to himself, make less show than smaller people. The show certainly had been made, and maintained beyond the limits of prudence. Again, it might be said, curtailment is no easy or pleasant matter when one has got into the full swing of the thing. But, in very truth, nothing of the kind at all was said \u2014 at the time. Such remarks were reserved for"], [211, "FATHER DOYLE GOES TO BALLINTEER 203 future generations, and now every windbag tells us that this profusion was drawn from rack-rents and starvation. On the contrary, it was then attempted to be explained that the building and maintenance of these big houses fed and clothed many people. As usual, sober judgment takes its stand between these two statements. In all probability, it would be much more correct to attribute the disasters which came rather to easiness and laxity, than to the oft-repeated extortion and rapacity we hear of. Anyway, the disasters came. The estate was not nearly so large now, for portions had been parted with to stave off the evil time, and what was left had been encumbered for a like purpose. Then, the Annesley of his day had betaken himself abroad, seeking by this device to disentangle himself from remaining show. Alienation, mortgage, final flight \u2014 not very commendable devices, perhaps, but hardly arguing rack rent and extortion. Shortly after the accession of the present young man to the property, the experiment had been made of selecting the BaUinteer estate, among others, for that pressure upon land lords which, it was hoped, would lead to their final and complete extermination. The selection was, in its way, a clever one. It was known that Charles Annesley could not reduce the rental of the property below the outgoings upon it, resulting from those past-made charges. Even if he reduced the rental to that amount, there would be absolutely nothing out of which he could draw an income. That, of course, was no plea against reduction, if reduction was fair in itself \u2014 it was his own look-out, as the saying is. But the demand exceeded that \u2014 and the reduction was not fair in itself. When the Annesleys had wanted money, they sold, or they borrowed \u2014 but they put no pressure on their tenantry. All"], [212, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 204 the talk about rack-renting and grinding imposed on no one acquainted with the circumstances of the case. But greed and fear are powerful motives, and both were brought into unsparing use. It was told to those who would obey, that they were already masters of the situation \u2014 and the disobedient had the examples of other disobedient persons before them. The first statement has received no confirmation in fact as yet ; but the second is terribly true. Still, had the experiment been first tried on the Ballinteer property, it would have had its result in failure. But coming with the prestige of those terrible examples from other parts, it assumed vitality after a fashion. That is to say, no one professed to pay rent : though many did so by stealth. All persons in the immediate employment of young Annesley left on the first warning, with the exception of the faithful Larry. Thus, all lands actually in the hands of the owner of Ballinteer remained uncultivated. Amid aU this stiUness and desolation, a charm lingered around the place, nevertheless. At a past period, artificial changes had been carried out at considerable outlay, intro ducing hill and dale, wood and water, where they had not been before. Neglect now helped to give to these a more natural appearance. Wild flowers mingled with such an introduced flora as had survived a similar neglect. Some noble trees enhanced the landscape. Young Annesley had returned to his home with some half-formed ideas of recovering the past, as far as modern circumstances would permit. But then had come the strain, and now it was a question whether he could hold his ground, or ought to do so. Such was now the position of affairs, when Father Doyle penned that note to the owner of Ballinteer. It was a simple note, merely asking permission to call on him, in reference to the unhappy relations between the landlord and tenants"], [213, "FATHER DOYLE GOES TO BALLINTEER 205 of the estate. He could say no more, at present. He could not announce himself as representing those tenants, until he had conferred with them on a possible and acknowledged basis of compromise, which it was now his business to ascertain. A partisan of those landlords he certainly was not, nor ever would be. And yet the old man wrote his note with many a sigh, and with much misgiving of mind. To the men who had actually fomented these quarrels on the various estates he would be now, and henceforth, Maranatha. He would place his own order under embarrassment ; they must now condemn him, or follow his example. And yet he was saving the one from its deadliest weakness \u2014 outrage, and the other from further ecclesiastical scandals. As regards the whole movement in its entirety, it was not easy to know what was in the mind of this old and experienced parish priest, reaUy and truly. Or, rather, perhaps he did not permit his mind to come to a conscious conclusion on the subject; and we are bound to give him the doubtful benefit of that doubt. Speaking of the much younger man, Father Flanagan, we said that he and the better educated members of his flock \" played \" at intercourse. In a different way, the older parish priest \"plays,\" too. There is a conven tional agreement \u2014 a shuffling of mere words to and fro, an avoidance of actual mental conflict \u2014 all which is, perhaps, the necessary condition of their relative positions. But habits grow \u2014 conventions themselves become, in time, realities. When the movement put its professed political and economic principles aside, and resorted to the sanction of foul and cowardly murder, we have seen Father Doyle wake from his convention, and speak and act in conformity with his position. But those who expect light and leading from churchmen in the conduct of temporal matters may, perhaps, also look for"], [214, "206 THE TURN OF THE TIDE something more than this. And certainly, as far as the movement professed to be a national aspiration, it had his public commendation. Nevertheless, a critical examination of this commendation would merely disclose sounding and weU-worn phrases. The real question did not so much as appear on the surface. And the real question is this : Would he trust himself and his order to its vain and mischievous leaders and the state of things they would bring about? If Father Doyle was pressed home on this, he must be obliged to answer in the negative. So much for the general movement itself. Now he was taking action merely between his flock and their landlord, with a view to obtaining the best possible and practical terms for his own people. Yet it gave him much uneasiness of mind. When Charles Annesley first got this note of the parish priest, he read it with feelings of irritation. As before stated, it simply asked for an interview on the subject of the unhappy differences at Ballinteer. He and his order, too, had their associations and traditions. That Irish discontent is attribut able to the Irish priesthood is certainly one of them. Why should he bare his affairs to this son of a peasant? \"Na}', but it is to spy out the nakedness of the land that ye come.\" Then he read the few words of the note again. They were very few, and yet the writer had managed to make them courteous, and even respectful. If he were the son of a peasant, certainly he did not forget that the Annesleys once held their heads high. He did not now write as the son of a peasant, but as the spiritual ruler of his people ; and though the letter was respectful, it was not humble. Again, he might have asked the young man to come to him. But he did nothing of the sort; he requested permission to call at Ballinteer House. Yes, it was an honest letter, and young"], [215, "FATHER DOYLE GOES TO BALLINTEER 207 Annesley would be lowering himself, and not the priest, if he did not accord it the answer of a gentleman. By the time the reply was written and sent, Charles Annesley felt even an access of gracious inclinations toward the expected visitor. He had been promising of late to look at matters in a more practical spirit, and to accept that which was inevitable. Here an opportunity was presented to him of making himself as good as his word. Alas ! he knew pretty well what the result would be. Concessions of a wild and outrageous character had been demanded of him \u2014 so wild, so outrageous that their mere impossibility had not been so much in contemplation as their exasperating effect on himself. But actual, practical, material concession was not now in his power, unless he resigned the nominal, as already he had lost the beneficial, ownership of his estate. Such a concession he had not to give \u2014 and well he knew Father Doyle would never go back to his people with a less show of service than that. Such might have been, had his affairs met with more indulgence than had been their fate. He had assumed the helm with hopes of saving the ship, by such seamanship as skill, care, and strict self-denial could apply. But the meddlers would not have it so \u2014 would have never turned attention to Ms ship at all, had it not been already in distress. To drop metaphor, the land lay uncultivated around him \u2014 arrears accumulated, which, under such circumstances, were as irrecoverable as the snow which had fallen last year, or last century. Whatever might have been, there was no margin now for such concessions as would be expected of him. Well, what did it matter ? Had he not already made up his mind to it? \u2014 and how much better was it to do so as the outcome of a friendly compromise, than in obedience to those mischief mongers who had set himself and his tenantry by the ears !"], [216, "208 THE TURN OF THE TIDE If there was to be capitulation, let him go out with the honours of war, and not pass under the yoke otherwise reserved for him. Then, Father Doyle paid his visit. Larry had busied himself for some days in the arrangement of a suitable welcome ; and, as it was a long drive to Ballinteer, it was insisted that the visitor should take some refreshment. To which, whether so inclined, or as further evidence of amity, the parish priest raised no serious objection. After that, there was the real business of the interview. Father Doyle com menced with a few of his sounding sentences. The condition of affairs was pitiable \u2014 it was daily becoming worse \u2014 the sooner arrangement came the better. It was not easy to ask a young man what he could do. But Charles Annesley had determined to be as good as his word \u2014 and he was. He himself passed from the general to particulars \u2014 from words to facts. The accounts of the estate were gone into ; he placed everything before his visitor in actual black and white. Father Doyle showed an aptitude for business and even legal details, and a grasp of their practical bearings, which his ordinary manner did not announce. He asked for nothing \u2014 but what was put before him he studied and mastered. His manner, as he proceeded, sufficiently indicated this. It went from gay to grave \u2014 from lively to severe. His gravity was free from all affectation \u2014 here was no ground for compromise worthy of the name. What might have been, before the mischief-makers had taken the matter in hand, was not now. He did not say so to his host; but he confessed so much to him self with regret. He had hoped to approach his people with tidings of the liberal concession in store for them if they only returned to their reason ; but the accounts showed no margin for that now. Nevertheless, toward the end of the interview"], [217, "FATHER DOYLE GOES TO BALLINTEER 209 he made effort to return to his former gaiety, if not liveliness. So much he considered due to the condescension of his host, for so he himself accounted it. Nor would he confess, even to himself, the worst. He would carefully reflect over all that had been so generously placed at his disposal \u2014 he would confer with Mr. Annesley again, if permission was accorded to him \u2014 where there was a will, a way of some sort must surely yet he found. After that, Father Doyle effected his departure from Ballinteer House. His own disappointment was great. He had taken this step in the face of certain aspersion and misrepresentation, and, so far, he did not see what good was to come of his interference."], [218, ""], [219, "CHAPTER XX. DE MORTUIS. IT will be understood that recent events had not been favourable to the progress of Mrs. Potter's negotiations with her family, prior to a second interview with Mr. Darley. In truth, the negotiations themselves had been in complete abeyance. Such had been the result of those terrible episodes of Mick, of Mick's wife, of the trying, though eventually successful, endeavour under which Ballyfarians were again induced to resume dealings with the closed and barred shop. Thus, Mrs. Potter had had her hands and her mind full enough, without adding that conference with her family, of which she had made promise. And thus, too, no second note had been sent to Mr. Darley bespeaking an appointment with him. In the meantime, that gentleman had waited and waited, and had then wondered and wondered. Then, to add to his wonder, one fine morning, in stalked Arthur Ogleby himself ! The head of that old and discreet firm of solicitors was a man of nerve and resource. But all his faculties were now put to the test by the unexpected apparition. \" Surely,\" he said to himself, \" the fat is in the fire now.\" And, yet, Mr. Darley was already acquainted with the somewhat singular habits of the Master of the Mount. One of these habits was always to \"drop in\" unexpectedly, and"], [220, "212 THE TURN OF THE TIDE without previous announcement. He went from home without any preliminary intimation. He effected his return even still more unostentatiously. Mr. Darley knew all these traits, and had made his little jokes upon them. But now he was some what perturbed in mind. Old Mr. Warburton's will, or attempt at a will, lay heavily upon him, and he knew not the moment he should be asked to commence a family lawsuit on the head of it. Now, the manner of Arthur Ogleby's visit to town was after this fashion. The secret had been too much for Mrs. Ogleby. Why should her daughter and her daughter's husband talk these matters over with the family sohcitor, while her own husband was left out in the cold, as it were? True, it had been her father's intention to leave him thus out in the cold. She knew why all that had been done, or, at least, attempted to be done. Poor Arthur, when he had the money, made it fly. And now, when he had put away all thoughts of getting old Mr. Warburton's effects, he was found cutting his cloth according to his measure, in a manner to win the commendation and esteem of all prudent men. Wherefore, when her daughter gave her promise that a safe and speedy arrangement was likely to be come by, she had held her peace, and made trial of her patience. Then came in those other events ; and, to her, the delay had appeared unreasonable. What would her husband say when he found that she had been keeping this matter from him ! Come what may, she would put him on the scent. Your true huntsman likes to find his own game, and his satisfaction would be all the greater if he gave himself credit for bringing this matter to an issue. Then, Mrs. Ogleby told her husband as much of those previous negotiations as would place no one in a very repre-"], [221, "DE MORTUIS 213 hensible light in his eyes. How Mr. Darley was not easy in his mind by reason of the legal position he occupied in the matter. How aU the Mount Ogleby people sought to approach him, the head of the family, with a view to more satisfactory settlement, but had hitherto been deterred by fear of a natural, and perhaps just, indignation at the treatment which he had already undergone. With much more, in which actual facts and extenuating fancies were ingeniously mixed together. At first, Arthur Ogleby evinced a turn to convert the fancies into the facts. He would not be approached on the subject. Darley had better not write to him. He was out of it now, and it was his intention to continue to occupy that more dignified position. Mrs. Ogleby looked her sympathy, and left her words to produce their effect. The Master of the Mount maintained an imperturbable silence for some days, at the end of which he disappeared, and was now found in Mr. Darley's office. \"What is all this about old Warburton and his affairs?\" said the Master of the Mount, whUe the master of the office hid his perturbation under words of welcome. \"AU what?\" replied Mr. Darley, hoping, by a few judicious parries, to ascertain how far matters had actually gone. \" Why, Fanny has been with you \u2014 and her husband ! I hope they're not going to throw away good money after bad?\" \"What has the money got to say to our feelings? The money itself is good enough \u2014 don't abuse it.\" \" Precious little there wiU be of it after the big-wigs take their whack out of it ! \" \" Spoken like a man of sense ! You know my aversion to family lawsuits. Now, who is going to law ? Are you?\" Mr. Ogleby protested against such an insinuation. \" I understood I was out of the matter altogether.\""], [222, "214 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Then, Mr. Darley had arrived at the conclusion that the Master of the Mount had not acquired any special, or even recent, information on the subject in hand. But he was fairly entitled to such information. And, in fact, it was questionable whether he should now be permitted to leave the office without obtaining his, Mr. Darley's, full and frank confidence. It was otherwise when Mrs. Potter took upon herself to hold family councils, and to bring about family understandings. But the promise had not been fulfiUed yet, and it was sufficiently possible that this Master of the Mount had an interest in the matter, even to the exclusion of all other interests. \"That is the uncertainty of the law,\" he said, aloud \u2014 \" which has been called glorious. I am not aware that I ever distinctly said that you had no concern in this matter. I am rather further from saying it, now.\" \" You said my name was not mentioned ; I thought it time to cry off, then.\" \"I stated a fact \u2014 now I am hinting an opinion.

This dead man exercised his mind\u2014 perhaps beyond its peculiar fitness \u2014 to make provision for your children.\" \" Because he distrusted their father ? \" But Mr. Darley held up his hand in a warning manner, saying, with some solemnity, \" De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\" \" Go your own way \u2014 I won't interrupt you again.\" \" But it 's not the interruption.

Possibly \u2014 yes, so it appeared to Mr. Darley \u2014 because a hope, a sense of relief came suddenly into the man's mind. Then he said \u2014 \" What do my daughters say to all this ? \" \" Bum the document \u2014 or some such wild suggestion of the sort.

But when he found himself amid his own familiar fields again, he made up for his reticence, though after a peculiar and startling manner. Placing his hand to his mouth, he repeated that ' hark forward,\" of which he had already afforded Mr. Darley a specimen, though there was now no Mr. Darley to be edifiedjby it, nor was hound or fox, horse or huntsman in sight, or hearing. Having disburdened himself after this strange fashion, he now descended to communings with himself of apparently a more pertinent nature. \" ' They trust you ' \u2014 didn't Darley say that ?

Why make bones about it ? I am under the priest's protection.\" \"Why, indeed?\" said the elder. \"I only wish he would extend it to me.\" \" I am glad to hear you say so. I didn't know what my neighbours might think of \u2014 the position.\" \" We usen't to expect much assistance from that quarter, you know.\" \" Just so ; that was the impression on our side \u2014 and I fear the evidence was with us, too. Nevertheless, was I to stand in my own light ? The priest is shocked at what has happened, and dreads a repetition of it. That is how he comes to help me \u2014 why shouldn't I accept his help ? \" \" There is some talk about this. The popular impression is that Father Doyle is putting his influence to a rather severe strain.\" \" No doubt, there will be a conflict. The people themselves will go with the priest. What has happened, already ? Those who left my employment have been, since, living in idleness"], [233, "AN APOLOGY 225 and misery. The priest asked me would I take them back? I said \u2014 ' Certainly ; we have had no quarrel \u2014 they left me through fear.'\" \" And they have come back 1 \" \"Most of them. They returned to me voluntarily, and on the assurance of Father Doyle that he would stand between them and the consequence.\" \"It's a beginning. The fight will he over the actual tenants themselves.\" \"Yes \u2014 you are right about the strain. It's only a truce.\" \" And whde the sun shines, you make your hay ? \" said the elder man, looking around him at the work in progress. \"Just so\u2014 anything for a change.\" Then, Arthur Ogleby told the story which he had to tell. \" It was a close shave \u2014 two of the dogs were nearly gone ; I suppose they will make away with them yet.\" \" And you think Father Doyle could stop that, too? You said you wished he would extend his influence to you ! \" \"I did but joke, Annesley. I have something else in my head. I grow old \u2014 there is some talk of reviving the regular County Hunt again ; hitherto, I may not have liked to deprive the county men, myself among them, of some substitute. Let it be, now.\" The younger man was silent, partly from surprise. Was this the real reason ? \u2014 was it an expression of resentment at what had happened? \u2014 or was there something deeper than either? It might not be becoming in a young man to press his elder beyond what it was his wish to disclose. But the surprise was allowable, in proper form. \" Mere talk will not give us the County Hunt again. In the meantime, what are the county men to do? The actual risk might he got over.\" p"], [234, "226 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" To the hounds ? How ? \" \" What did you say yourself, just now ? \" \" Oh\u2014 about Father Doyle ? But I joked.\" \"And I am serious. Look here, now. Father Doyle has no particular care for me, you, and the rest of our order. But he is getting the wit to see that outrage \u2014 outrage which he can stop, or try to stop \u2014 is undermining his order. Well, I take him as I find him. I think you said I was right ? \" \" Certainly \u2014 why not ? What has all this got to say to me?\" \"Everything. Suppose you take a leaf out of my book?\" \" What book ? \u2014 and what leaf ? Your Father Doyle is shocked at the misery brought upon his people \u2014 at the loss of human life. WTU1 he step out of his order because a few dogs are in jeopardy?\" \" Give the man his due, at any rate ; he has always been an advocate for country sports ; pity he ever yielded to the fiery Father Flanagan, even in that respect. But I didn't mean it in that way. On the contrary, I want my Father Doyle, as you call him, to give his whole aid and assistance to Ballinteer ; you are right, he will find that task quite heavy enough for his shoulders. However, for the present, we are safe here. Well, you are right, too, about the sun and the hay. Don't you take me ? Send the dogs over here ; there is plenty of accommoda tion, and of hands too, now. The priest's advocacy of hunting is well known ; under the circumstances, outrage here would be outrage against him. That was what I meant when I took up your wish that you were under Father Doyle's protection, too.\" It was now the elder man's turn to be silent. He, too, had his own thoughts. Presently, however, they found expression. \"I told you, Annesley, I wanted to get out of this thing"], [235, "AN APOLOGY 227 altogether. There is a trust being reposed in me. But it is done with fear \u2014 good reason, too ! When I can remove the rear, ought I not to do so ? If the dogs come here, they should stay here.\" \" That is hardly fair, sir,\" said the young man, changing, for the first time, the light and even bantering tone in which he had been holding converse. \" I have had my troubles ; and they are very far from being over yet \u2014 if they are to be got over. But I cannot accept gifts ; under the circumstances, they would be all the more painful.\" \"And I don't want to pain you, young man. Take it the way I have just put it. The arrangement suits me. Say, I have an object \u2014 thrift, always commendable \u2014 and don't stand in my way.\" \" WeU, if I am assisting. Not that the truce will last always; the real battle \u2014 the battle over the tenants \u2014 must come. In the meantime, if you really have an arrangement to carry out, I should be your man. Possibly, this County Hunt may be re-estabhshed ; they would be glad enough to purchase the pack from you. The point we are both agreed on is that, just now, it wUl be safe here.\" After that, the two gentlemen separated, in order to carry out each his own part of the arrangement thus proposed. Arthur Ogleby returned to his home, there to get ready his dogs for removal at a later period of the day. Young Annesley assembled all hands to prepare some long- disused outbuildings for their reception. In the evening, Arthur Ogleby came over with his hounds. He had brought a couple of retainers from the Mount with him ; but Charles Annesley assured him he had now hands enough, and the men were sent back. \" It is very much better that you should leave this trial of skill entirely to myself.\""], [236, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 228 \" To yourself \u2014 and Father Doyle ? \" said Arthur Ogleby, laughing. \" Well, yes \u2014 why not ? I tell you that the hunting sympathies of his reverence are our strongest bits of defence. I mean to let him know, on the first opportunity, that he is now responsible for the next season's sport, if there is to be any in the county.\" \"I daresay he will know our movements before morning.\" \"That is probable, too \u2014 the sooner the better.\" Then, Arthur Ogleby critically examined the preparations which had already been made. Whether the change was to be temporary or absolute \u2014 whether the pack was to return to the Mount, or be finally dispersed, his solicitude for their present comforts underwent no modification. On the whole, and on so exacting a subject, he was fairly complimentary. Much had been done, though he took upon him to suggest other work which yet remained. Young Annesley promised attentive comphance, and the elder man at length wended his way homeward. \"It's getting something like the old place again, Masther,\" said the faithful Larry, as the day's labour was finally sus pended. \"It's a long way off that, yet,\" replied the young owner of Ballinteer. \" Not that I would have an entire return to old matters, even if I had my way,\" he added after a pause. To this latter observation Larry made no audible answer, though his manner indicated reflection. The man, as well as the master, had had his experience of late ; and, probably, it led him to hold his tongue, when, before, a conventional reply would have readily followed. In playing for life or death, one cannot help thinking over the true laws of the game."], [237, "AN APOLOGY 229 \" Anyway, we are here, stiU,\" continued the master. \"Alive and kicking,\" more readily replied the man to the obvious fact. \"That is more than was probable, a short while ago, Larry.\" \" I 'd have followed you, wherever you went. You know that, Masther Charles.\" \" Alas ! my poor Larry \u2014 the chances are that you would have gone before. I must take my share of the risk, now ; you know this is only a bit of breathing- time.\" \" While there 's breath there 's life,\" added the man, the con ventional habit returning, even under a temporary respite. After that, the young man asked for his writing materials, and was left undisturbed to his literary pursuits. But, apparently, composition came slowly to him. He sat for some time with pen in hand and paper before him, and, though occasionally he committed a few words to writing, his next step, after each effort, was to tear up the sheet and throw it from him. In truth, he was inditing, or endeavouring to indite, an epistle to a young lady, and various conflicting considerations made, or appeared to him to make, the task an embarrassing one. With the single exception of the officers' ball, he had not met Kate Ogleby since that evening when they had parted at her father's door, and he had used words which, he had to confess to himself, there could be no justification for. He would have withdrawn them \u2014 humbly apologised for them, instantly, on the spot. But there had been no oppor tunity. The retiring officers were already round about them, making their adieux ; the young girl, offended at his rudeness, had turned away ; and he himself had gone out into the dark night, feehng that he had made another contradiction to his"], [238, "230 THE TURN OF THE TIDE promises of reform. What right had he to pass remarks to a young lady on her politeness to one of her father's guests? It was a ridiculous piece of impertinence on his part; and any attempt at explanation, now that the matter had cooled, would only increase the ridicule of his position. Not but the attempt had been made. A few days after that evening, he had called at the Mount \u2014 partly in accordance with the etiquette which obliges a visit after having partaken of hospitality, but also in the hope of obtaining an opportunity of getting Kate herself alone for a moment or two. In the presence of others he could say nothing \u2014 there are limits beyond which a young man can not face ridicule. Besides, notwithstanding his rudeness, he had still sufficient instincts of the gentleman left to know that such a course would expose the young lady herself to ridicule also. But the opportunity was not given to him. He came away from the Mount with his amende unmade \u2014 and not even wiser than when he went. For Kate Ogleby did not appear at all, and he had not even the courage to ask specially if she was at home. Then there had been that meeting at the public ball, when publicity itself had proved an unfavourable \u2014 nay, an impossible \u2014 element. There was nothing for it but writing, now. And, as her father had condescended to such intimate terms with him \u2014 for it was certainly condescension on his part to entrust his hunting treasures to his word and promise of safe-keeping \u2014 and as more frequent communication must now ensue between the two places, entailing further embarrassments in their present relations \u2014 taking all this into consideration, the sooner he brought his epistolary effort to a close, the better. At length his attempt resulted in the following \u2014 \u25a0"], [239, "AN APOLOGY 231 \" Dear Miss Ogleby, \u2014 Had I had the good fortune to meet you at the Mount when I called, perhaps I would not have inflicted this epistle upon you ; it might be that I would then have had the opportunity to explain what now must come so lamely by letter. Still, an explanation is due to you \u2014 to myself. The difficulty is that now I set about it in earnest, I know not what to say. Per haps if I could have made it personally, you would have given me a help \u2014 at aU events, I would know whether I was making you more angry, or the contrary. And yet I could have only told you how rude, impertinent, and interfering I had made myself ; in fact, just what you are already aware of, and showed by your manner that you felt. I can only plead extenuating circumstances. Just now there is trouble at the Mount ; imagine a fellow, with no very sweet temper, exposed to a long succession of such worries and annoyances. \"Your father bears it like a lamb \u2014 and you know what his feelings must be ! I was so glad I could come to the rescue \u2014 though I cannot claim the merit of that, even. We are making the dogs as comfortable as we can ; and, by degrees, we hope to satisfy the owner's requirements on this point. He will be over here again in the morning \u2014 and every morning, I suspect, as long as the present arrangement is to continue. And now, am I to hope for pardon ? You will not answer this letter \u2014 I will not ask you. But, perhaps, out of your clemency, you might accompany your father here some morning, and see all that we are doing to make his mind easy. I would then understand that there was hope of forgiveness.\" Whatever the young man reaUy expected, no reply \u2014 epistolary or verbal \u2014 ever came. But, a few mornings after, the young girl certainly did accompany her father on one of his now regular visits. It may be that Charles Annesley further regarded it as portion of the contract that explanation was to be no more referred to. His offence had been pardoned, and thus it was now left."], [240, ""], [241, "CHAPTER XXII. LIVE AND LET LIVE. sllHOSE who had been in the former employment of Charles -i- Annesley were now returning; so far, Father Doyle's countenance had been effective. No objection had been raised on the part of the owner of Ballinteer himself. They had pleaded fear \u2014 fear of the destroying agents who stalked the land. It was certainly a sufficient plea, founded on undoubted and undeniable proofs. There had been no misunderstanding on that, or, in fact, on any other point. Master and men had been fairly satisfied with each other ; when they returned their places were still open for them ; there was not any further explanation. So far for the men actuaUy employed \u2014 \" the hands,\" in fact. Of course, the bigger question \u2014 the question of the tenants on the estate \u2014 was yet untouched. These, in obedience to the same mandate from without, had refused to recognise the owner's proprietary rights, had ceased to cultivate their holdings, were now suUenly awaiting the termination of the period which notices of eviction had yet to run. That question might be thus put \u2014 was Charles Annesley to remain the practical owner of his property, or, was he to yield to a stronger power from without ? That was really the problem which Father Doyle had thought of solving on the side of morality and religion, in his capacity of moral and religious"], [242, "234 THE TURN OF THE TIDE adviser of his people. But we have seen that his thoughts hardly resolved themselves into hopes, rather they were taking the form of fears. The promises from without were visionary \u2014 illusory \u2014 hoUow ; well the shrewd old man knew that ; but what had he to offer his people instead? It had been per mitted to him to look into the whole condition of the estate, and he had found no margin out of which to construct such an offer. Furthermore, about this time, that portion of the Dublin newspaper press which claims for itself the title \" National,\" began to exercise itself upon the doings of Ballyfair and its neighbourhood. The Daily Drum came out especially strong. The article had been assigned to its most slashing man, Mr. O'Dowd, and it had even been suggested to him that he was to be at liberty to put on a sufficient head of steam. For, even in the columns of the Daily Drum, it was usually found expedient to work Mr. O'Dowd at half-pressure. Accorded tbis coveted permission, the gentleman set to his task with considerable satisfaction to himself, which increased as the sentences evolved themselves from his teeming mind. A specimen of his work may, probably, suffice : \" But we have still hopes of the men of Ballinteer. Let there be no disguise about the matter. They are now the men in the gap ; we wait to see how they acquit themselves. A little more exercise of firmness, a deaf ear turned to specious arguments, and the game is theirs. Of course, it is within their power to disappoint us. They can return to bondage and the lash. They may even help to prop up a little longer a system condemned on its own inherent defects. They may cause us to regret the choice we made of them. But no ; we have still hopes in the men of Ballinteer. \"These Annesleys must now go. That, too, admits of no"], [243, "LIVE AND LET LIVE 235 possibility of doubt. When, in times past, they ran their evil course, they betook themselves elsewhere. They obeyed the instincts of their order, and abandoned the land their riot had left bare. They went to suit themselves \u2014 they must now go to suit others. Whether Ballinteer proves fit for the task assigned it, or the young man again seeks safety in flight, the departure must be final. The decree has gone forth ; we hardly care to help those who will not read the handwriting which is on the wall. \" But something more has to be said. The men of Ballinteer wiU think twice ere they belie our promise in them. The Annesleys and their order will try to run out a little more rope before they commit the happy despatch upon themselves. But who is to be answerable for a delay which is as gratuitous as it is unkind ? Who should read in the hearing of their people that handwriting which is now on the wall ? We have already protested against that mock delicacy which hounded Father Flanagan from his post of utility and honour. We have now to protest against the strange obliquity which has led his superior over to the enemy. We are prepared to concede much ; we can even wait, with assured confidence. But we will not dispense with the union of priest with people. Let Father Doyle take heed in time, and count well the cost of such an apostacy. The movement proceeds. It must proceed. Who does not know the fate of the renegade when Victory finally perches on those standards he has seceded from ? \" There was a good deal more of this sort of thing. In fact, the writer could have reeled off any length of it. Mr. O'Dowd had first practised his pen on that side which he has designated \" the enemy.\" Of course, this was all perfectly fair and legitimate \u2014 at least in Mr. O'Dowd's eyes. When with this enemy, he had done the work required of him to the best"], [244, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 236 of his ability, and he had been paid for it. That was when this other side slashed, too. And, indeed, his connection with that other side was even more a matter of business than his present one. For, after all, there is slashing and slashing ; and the hterary squibs and crackers, which proved tolerable to a more genteel audience, found no favour with those requiring coarser and more dazzling fireworks. To dismiss metaphor, sounding assertion was far more congenial to this writer than cunningly-worded epigram or pasquinade, which had its sting in the truth which was wrapped up in it. Truth trammelled him \u2014 who cares to look into a statement so long as it makes, or even appears to make, for his party ? \u2014 wherefore, he preferred to soar into the realms of baseless fancy and reckless aspersion. When his former friends gave up epigram and pasquinade, they parted company. He did not change his principles, for, sooth to say, he had none to change. He merely entered upon his second style, which he now thought his best. He was a literary free-lance in the widest acceptation. He found his occupation in unsettled states of affairs, and to attempt their settlement could only be explainable to him under an aberration of intellect. Thus there can be no difficulty in seeing how Mr. O'Dowd had gravitated to his present employment. When Father Doyle found this writer's article on his breakfast-table next morning, he also found with it a note from the editor of the Daily Drum. \" Dear Father Dotle \" (said the note), \u2014 \" I fear O'Dowd has taken you rather roughly to task. You will understand that we have to do this sort of thing occasionally. If the Banner chalks high, why, we have to chalk higher ; if the Beagle starts its game, we have to join in the chase [the Beagle and the Banner were also Dublin papers, foUowing the like inciting trade]. Sometimes this"], [245, "LIVE AND LET LIVE 237 is inconvenient enough, especially when we have to rate an old and valued friend. But the matter hardly requires this explanation ; still, as we may have to recur to the subject, it may be as well made.\" Father Doyle put the note in the fire. He was very angry ; it drew his attention to this condemnation of himself, and it threatened him with more of it ; that was how he read it. Still, when he thus consumed the note, there was an end of the petty and private impertinence. But the article itself could not be so treated. He might burn the paper which contained it, but already copies of it were on many thousands of other breakfast-tables. The rosy countenance of the parish priest assumed a still deeper tinge as he read the words of his castigation. At this precise moment, thousands of other parish priests, and thousands of Catholic curates, were reading these very words, and were blessing their stars that they were clear of Mr. O'Dowd's lash. He was angry, and yet he was sad. Such sudden and unexpected notoriety troubled and perplexed him. Of Mr. O'Dowd's mental, or even moral capacity, he had no high opinion. Hardly a week passed in which the Daily Drum had not to withdraw such sounding assertion. And yet, a leading article written by Mr. O'Dowd, and appearing in the columns of the Daily Drum, carried its weight with it. In fact, he had to ask himself, was he the delinquent here depicted ? Had he, in very reality, deserted his people, and thus gone over to this \" enemy \" ? It was not true, there was not even a colourable pretext of truth in it. Under his early style, Mr. O'Dowd would never have dared to commit himself to the assertion ; but now, any stick served the purpose, so long as he laid it about him with a will. No ; be it right or wrong, the beaten man knew one thing; he was working for"], [246, "238 THE TURN OF THE TIDE those entrusted to him, and for no one else. He was endeavouring to obtain for them a half loaf, or perhaps three quarters of a loaf, while those who promised the whole loaf knew very weU that their work would begin and end in \u2014 promises. And had he been precipitate in this matter? Very much the contrary. He had taken no part in the struggle until the laws of God had been flagrantly and undeniably outraged. It had been a reproach to himself that he had remained inactive until human life had been taken. Back to that inactivity he could not now go, from the position he had taken up he could not budge an inch. All the O'Dowds in the world might pillory him in their leading columns ; it might be repeated to his order and his people, as the editor himself had pretty plainly hinted, that he was a renegade. But, on this subject of outrage, he would take his stand, and utter his protest. What, then, was to be his course ? Obviously, that of a just man \u2014 possibly his justification might come yet. For instance, whose really was this loaf? \u2014 and in its division where was he to draw the line ? Was he to denounce murder, and give his assent to stealing ? Both laws emanated from the same Author, whose minister he was. These Annesleys had been owners of Ballinteer from generation to generation. One cannot eat his cake, and yet have his cake. And they had certainly consumed a portion of their cake. But, of that which was left, some certainly was still theirs. Mr. O'Dowd and his tribe might splutter through their leading columns, promising to their dupes these near and easy victories. But they could not alter the moral law. Surely, that law he, as a moral guide, had first to consider. Then, as to these tenants on the Ballinteer property\u2014 his people. They, too, had been occupiers of the soil from"], [247, "LIVE AND LET LIVE 239 generation to generation. They, too, were entitled to their crusts, as long as they earned them in the sweat of their brow. He could not consent to any other view of the case. He was of the people himself, and he demanded that those on the land should be allowed to live by the land, so long as they fulfilled their duties. It was his business to teach them these duties. No doubt the practical details were very complicated, perhaps even beyond his grasp. O'Dowd, who never owned, or tilled, a foot of ground in his life, might write glibly on these subjects ; but he, Father Doyle, was free to confess that they were outside his range. All he contended for was that, when everything was said which could be said, there was a precept which underlay all human enactment. Men must live \u2014 and let others live. Philosophers might tell him that the good old maxim had gone out of fashion \u2014 that aU matters were now to be settled on the purely commercial or competitive system. But if he knew anything at all about land and those who occupied it, no solution could work which did not admit such understanding. And yet it was not enough to hold a principle \u2014 a practice was urgent upon him. In a short time now, the law must take its course as regards the Ballinteer property. In this matter even the owner himseU had no very potential voice. Those heavy charges on his property had to be met. It has been already mentioned that some of these tenants had already paid by stealth ; whether they feared the consequences which were now about to happen, or were of opinion that they could lay no just claim to the whole loaf. Fear must have had some influence in the case, for they had actually requested the master of Ballinteer to include them in the list of those against whom the law was now to raise its strong arm. Of course, nothing would happen to them, except that"], [248, "240 THE TURN OF THE TIDE they would now have to be exposed as honest men. But the rest: \u2014 in fact, the bulk of the tenants \u2014 would have to leave their homes. For them there would certainly be no bread at all. Half a loaf was better than that, so another good old maxim said, which even the philosophers could not put out of fashion ; though Mr. O'Dowd and his side kept bawling that the contrary only was worthy the acceptance of all free men, or those hereditary bondsmen who would be free. And they were bawling to some effect, too. Thus, that which shocked Father Doyle beyond aU other considerations \u2014 the detachment of the people from the homes of their forefathers \u2014 was not now far distant. All talk of the division of the loaf would then be in vain \u2014 they would get none of it. Practically, there would be no bread for anyone. The farms would be then finally abandoned, and the men who would attempt to occupy such abandoned farms would write their own death-warrants. This was really the task which the hired pens of the O'Dowds were now urging the men of Ballinteer, and other estates under Campaign system, to carry out to the bitter end. He had told the young owner of Ballinteer that the matter should have his best attention ; also giving him to understand that such action on his part must be guided by the interests of his own people. So far, he had come to see the great difficulties which stood in the way \u2014 and the young man had been allowed to understand that, too. But whatever Mr. O'Dowd and his employers had now said, or whatever they might in continuation say, he was prepared to make good the promise he had given."], [249, "CHAPTER XXIII. CAPTAIN HELMSLEY RECEIVES A GUEST. WE have again to ask the reader to accompany us to the officers' quarters at the Curragh. The morning's post had arrived, and Captain Helmsley was sitting in his room, after the perusal of his portion of it. Some opened letters lay on the table ; but one special one, also opened, was now in his hand. He had read it \u2014 at least, a particular part of it \u2014 more than once, and was now reflecting on the contents. Altogether, the young English officer's attitude presented a fair specimen of what is generally known as \"a brown study.\" The letter bore an English postmark, and was from his mother. That particular part of it ran as follows : \u2014 \" No tidings, yet, of poor Maria and her child. My dear Harry we think it is time that all petty feelings should be laid aside, and that we should now only recoUect that Mrs. Hilton and her daughter, Florence \u2014 named after me \u2014 are our flesh and blood. Your father did not approve of certain acts of poor John Hilton, or, for the matter of that, of Maria herself. As trustee of her marriage portion, he held it for some years, paying to them, of course, the market rate of interest upon it ; and, during that time, their home was here. Then John asked for the money, stating that he had obtained employment in Ireland, where its investment would advance his interests. It is not to be denied that the demand came unexpectedly and inconveniently upon your father, though he disapproved of the undertaking on other grounds. I added my own remonstrances with Maria ; but John, with whom Q"], [250, "242 THE TURN OF THE TIDE to take hold of an idea was to see it out, would not yield, and his wife adopted his views. Your father was put to trouble and expense in negotiating a new loan, to supply that which the Hiltons took away with them. He was much embittered \u2014 more, even, than I suspected at the time ; the estrangement has since lasted ; and, in fact, your father did say at the time that, as Maria had made a new home for herseU, so she had closed the old one against her. I have my own opinions, my dear Harry, on the whole subject, but I prefer to pass them over. I do not blame Maria for taking her husband's side ; I wiU not follow her example, I will be merely silent. Your father is now old, and has not been well for some time. I believe he regrets what has happened ; latterly, he has mentioned Maria's name more than once. At any time a stUl greater change may occur ; and it is right I should teU you so. \"To return to the Hiltons, you may recollect \u2014 or perhaps you don't, for there was no mention of their names then \u2014 that John Hilton soon met his death, and the money was lost \u2014 certainly for the time being. And now that I come to think more carefuUy over it, you were away learning your military duties at the time, so that I wiU have to enter a Uttle more into detail. John HUton's statement was correct enough. He had obtained the agency of a considerable estate in the south of Ireland, belonging to Lord Mangerton. Whether he obtained it on the condition of investing this money in it, or that was an independent and voluntary transaction of his own, is now of little consequence. Certain it is that the money was so invested, as also that the security ranked high at the time. Then came the reverses. Wild and impractical demands were made upon Lord Mangerton ; the Plan of Campaign was proclaimed on the estate. John Hilton was found dead by the roadside ; his wife and child were treated with insult ; they fled, and have not since been traced. \" All this we heard from a Mr. Darley, who is Lord Mangerton's solicitor, and bears a high character in his profession. He says, in the event of a certain transaction taking place, Maria wiU get back all her money, principal and interest ; but, in the meantime, there is nothing for anyone, not even for Lord Mangerton himseU."], [251, "CAPTAIN HELMSLEY RECEIVES A GUEST 243 I do not understand this ; probably, Mr. Darley will explain more fully when you call upon him, as I wish you to do. \" From all sources we learn that her lot is not an exceptional one. So large is now the number of ladies thus unexpectedly and undeservedly reduced to destitution, that committees for the sale of their work, and other means of aUeviation, have been formed, both in this country and in Ireland. But, again, the unexpected happens. Many of these poor ladies have to be found ; they shrink from coming forward. Not a few hide themselves away in holes and corners, and actually shun help, and even sympathy.\" Then followed some suggestions to her son : in what prob able quarters to pursue his inquiries, the names of some of the ladies connected with the relief committees already referred to, and the like suggestions. The young man had now, for the last time, left the open letter on the table, and again returned to his brown study. Was this, then, the fate of the pretty little Flo \u2014 they had always called each other by their Christian names \u2014 with whom his boyish days had been so familiar? They had been called cousins ; in truth, the relationship was so remote that he did not now know to what precise degree of cousinship they belonged. She was then about ten years of age, and nearly ten more had now to be added to that. If Florence Hilton was alive, she would now be close on twenty years of age. He could not call to mind what was the precise degree of cousinship, only that it was a very remote one ; but he could very well recollect that a much closer degree of relation ship had once floated through his boyish mind. Still, Flo was pretty \u2014 very pretty. What was she like now ? He wondered would he know her if he saw her? And he had actually forgotten all about those boyish dreams ! His mother had attempted some sort of explanation of his forgetfulness in this letter. He had been learning his military duties ; he had"], [252, "244 THE TURN OF THE TIDE gone abroad with his regiment; but the young man did not feel flattered by the unasked aid. It was very much like a case of \" Out of sight, out of mind.\" One fact his mother had mentioned, which was, perhaps, more to the point. Letters from home had made no reference to the HUtons. For the first time the young man was now supplied with an explana tion ; there had been estrangement. Did this explain still more ? His mother now expressed her concern \u2014 anxiety for those of them stdl surviving, more than once using the word \" we \" in the course of her letter, but never once connecting such expressions with his father. Was the estrangement on his part still in being, and did this suggest any solution of Mrs. Hilton's silence ? Again, was she, too, aware of the possibility of her money being again restored intact to her, as also hinted in this letter, and did she prefer to await that event before breaking her silence ? From these crude and, as yet, immature efforts at conjecture, the young man graduaUy turned to other thoughts. Had there not been some later dreams ? This daughter of Ogleby's \u25a0 \u2014 what nonsense ! She cared for neither him nor his atten tions. For all her pretty ways and friendly wishes, he could see that. Men might not think him very clever, but he knew when a young girl's mind was absent or present, as well as the sharpest of them. And when Kate Ogleby was prattling to him, he knew she was watching Charles Annesley out of the corner of her eye. Yes, and didn't he see those eyes fill with tears when the same young man gave himseU airs and was rude? Oh, he didn't get credit for those things, but perhaps he saw more than your flashy, gabby lot, though he chose to keep it to himself. Not that he felt the least annoyance or resentment, now ; in fact, he rather liked this young man ; and if the girl liked"], [253, "CAPTAIN HELMSLEY RECEIVES A GUEST 245 him, too \u2014 well, it was too late in the day to try conclusions there. Possibly, without any other particular quest to interest him, he might have gone on seeing, and yet not wholly permitting himself to see ; using his outward powers of obser vation \u2014 he could not help that \u2014 but declining to own the inferences he should draw from them. But here now was a real and veritable quest, taking his mind away \u2014 yea, taking himseU bodily away ; for, assuredly, he would foUow this matter up, and ascertain the actual fate of poor Flo and her mother. This Annesley did not appear to him to be a pushing young man ; he could be huffy, and make ungracious remarks on occasions. WeU, well, he was hardly tried, and perhaps this reserve was even to his credit under such circum stances. Of course, he could not marry as matters now were, and, naturally, that made the trial harder to bear. Anyway, these people were now about to be left alone among themselves, and in time there might come a better under standing. What should be his first movement in the new matter ? This Mr. Darley must be seen, of course. To be sure, Mr. Darley himself seemed to be at fault in this search, so he read his mother's letter. Nevertheless, more could be learned in a personal interview with him than might be expected from a correspondence. When had he heard the name before ? Yes, he recollected aU about it, now. Old Arthur Ogleby had mentioned him more than once, referring to him as acting in the capacity of solicitor for him, also. That was quite in accordance with what his mother now wrote. How odd ! \u2014 he was proposing to himseU to get away altogether from the people of the Mount \u2014 and now he was going to look up the family solicitor ! Would it not be as weU to learn as much as he could about this gentleman, while he was here on the spot ?"], [254, "246 THE TURN OF THE TIDE The letter referred to him as a well-known and respectable man of business ; perhaps that, also, would be found to tally with facts ; but, prior to an actual and personal interview, it might be as well to get those facts. He was going to let these young people settle their affairs among themselves \u2014 if they could. But he had no objection to a few pleasant words, even of leave taking, with Kate Ogleby, if it should be his chance to meet her at the Mount. Then, the brown study came to an end ; for there was a knock at his door, and his orderly entered to ask for his instructions of the day. \" I wUl take out one of the horses. I want to ride a few mUes across country \u2014 as far as Mount Ogleby, you know. If I come home early enough, I will take the evening train to town.\" When the horse was ready, the young man paid his visit to the Mount. But neither old Arthur Ogleby nor young Kate was there. \" Mr. Ogleby will be so disappointed at not meeting you,\" said the lady of the house. \" He and my daughter went over to Ballinteer this morning. The dogs are kept there, now \u2014 perhaps you know ? \" Captain Helmsley did not know, and the recent attempt at poisoning had to be narrated to him. \" My husband will be so sorry to miss you,\" repeated Mrs. Ogleby, when she had told the story. \" He is so glad to talk with those gentlemen who hunt with him.\" \" But there will be no hunting if this sort of thing goes on \u2014 and I came over to talk about something else,\" said Captain Helmsley.

In all"], [255, "CAPTAIN HELMSLEY RECEIVES A GUEST 247 probability, Mrs. Ogleby could tell him just as much as her husband. Then, the young man told his own story. How his family \u2014 that was the way he put it \u2014 were much concerned about a lady, a relative in fact, who had lost her all in these troubled times, and could not now be traced. \"A gentleman named Darley is acting as solicitor for the estate with which her affairs have, unfortunately, become en tangled. I recollected that Mr. Ogleby had mentioned this name ; so I thought I'd run over here before going deeper into the matter.\" \" Certainly \u2014 Mr. Darley is our solicitor ; he acted as such for my father before I was married.\" \" Then you can tell me quite as much as Mr. Ogleby himself ? \" \" I think so \u2014 quite as much ; if it is not beyond feminine comprehension.\" \" No \u2014 not at all. In fact, the question is more difficult than the answer. Judging from what you say, Mr. Darley must stand well with country gentlemen.\" \" None more so \u2014 and none more deservedly so. Let me hear your question.\" \"I have already got your answer, Mrs. Ogleby,\" said the young man, laughing. \" Oh \u2014 perhaps you wanted to know what sort of a character Mr. Darley bears ? \" \"That is just it; you see, Mrs. Ogleby, you had to put my question yourself for me.\" \" WeU, I am glad to be able to give so favourable an account. My husband could tell you the same. Mr. Darley takes high rank as a professional man.\" \" Then, I am safe in his hands ? \""], [256, "248 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \"As far as rectitude of purpose and discretion go \u2014 quite so.

That is not very comforting \u2014 though true.\" \" Oh ! \" said Mrs. Ogleby, with a slight glance toward her eldest daughter, who was present \u2014 \" there is a young lady, also?\" \" Yes ; Mrs. Hilton is a widow, with an only child. That is, if they are alive now.\" Mrs. Ogleby looked at the handsome young man. His colour was now somewhat high \u2014 that might be the result of his recent canter across country. Captain Helmsley, the eldest son of an old and high English country gentleman, was a person naturally to interest a mother with daughters to provide for. Then, this young man had, on more than one occasion, singled out her daughter, Kate, for attention and apparent admiration. How would it be now, with this quest of another young lady on his mind ? \" Yes \u2014 it is all very sad, though, unfortunately, not now un common,\" at length replied Mrs. Ogleby. \" I was just think ing. Sophia, did not your sister, Fanny, say something about Mr. Darley's making inquiries of her concerning a lady and her daughter ? \" \" Yes, mamma \u2014 and I think the name was the same as that mentioned by Captain Helmsley.\" \" My married daughter and her husband,\" continued Mrs. Ogleby, \" had occasion to see Mr. Darley, some weeks ago, on a family matter.

He goes about a good deal, you know, and has met a great number of people. He knows Lord Mangerton, and has hunted and shot over his property more than once.\" \"I am very sorry, too,\" politely repeated the young officer. \" It 's not yet too late,\" said Mrs. Ogleby. \" You know, the road by Ballinteer is only a little out of your way, on returning.\" \" 1 ought to know,\" replied the young man \u2014 \" we found ourselves there on a dark winter's night, some time ago.\" \" And now it 's broad daylight,\" urged Mrs. Ogleby. \" Well, yes \u2014 I think I will go round that way,\" said Captain Helmsley. \" Perhaps, as you say, something might occur to Mr. Ogleby to tell me.\" After that, the young man finally took his leave, and resumed his canter. \" It was unfortunate your father and Kate were not here,\" said Mrs. Ogleby. \" What use would Kate have been, mamma ? \" said Sophy. \" Well, your father. I wonder will Captain Helmsley meet them?\" \" There are so many ways to and from Ballinteer. I am sure papa and Kate will come through the fields.\" \" I forgot to tell him that. We must just let matters take their own course.\""], [258, "250 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" They wiU hardly take a course in that direction, mamma.\" \"Why not? Captain Helmsley certainly admired your sister.\" \" And, now, perhaps he will admire this other young lady \u2014 when he finds her.\" \" Yes, certainly, there is that to he said,\" was Mrs. Ogleby's reply. \" My dear mamma,\" expostulated her daughter\u2014\" I think there is a great deal more to be said. I suppose the young ladies themselves have a voice in the matter ? \" \" Girls so young as your sister Kate hardly know their own minds.\" \" I don't know about that,\" said Miss Ogleby \u2014 \" at her age, I was quite romantic.\" \" Yes, I suppose Kate is a little romantic, too ; a hit of romance, under proper control, is not unbecoming at her time of life. Of course, she will grow out of it.\" Miss Ogleby was not so sure of that, either ; though she did not reply directly to her mother. She still found it possible to preserve some of her romance, amid her more severe studies. \" A great many people, I am sure, admire and like Captain Helmsley,\" was her answer, instead \u2014 \"but I don't think they do so from a romantic point of view.\" \"Perhaps not, Sophy,\" said her mother, compelled to laugh \u2014 \" I confess, I myself was giving it a more matter-of-fact consideration. Of course, we can't expect Kate to do that.\" \" No \u2014 not in this particular case. But you know very well, mamma, that circumstances do alter cases.\" Mrs. Ogleby was quite aware of the generally conceded fact. But she, too, chose to reply indirectly to her daughter \u2014 \" Kate would not lose her control under any circumstances.\" \" Kate would not show her preference until preference was"], [259, "CAPTAIN HELMSLEY RECEIVES A GUEST 251 very clearly declared to her.

He can never marry.\" \" Never is a very long day,\" replied Miss Ogleby. \" How ever, until a better day approaches, I really do not think he would.\" Then Arthur Ogleby and his youngest daughter appeared, on their return from Ballinteer. \"I wonder if they met Captain Helmsley?\" said Mrs. Ogleby. But they had returned by the fields, and the young man had gone by the road. Thus, there had been no meeting."], [260, ""], [261, "CHAPTER XXIV. CAPTAIN HELMSLEY GOES TO TOWN. IN the meantime, the young man continued his canter along the high road which lay between Mount Ogleby and Ballinteer. He might have met those it was his wish to meet had his attention been sufficiently directed outside himself ; for the way by the fields was not very far apart from the way by the road. But, insensibly, Captain Helmsley continued his brown study as well. \" Kate Ogleby gone over to Ballinteer !\" This was the course the study now took. \"Then, there must have been something in the nature of an explanation. I heard the young man's remarks, which were almost rude, and I 'm almost certain I saw tears in the girl's eyes, though she tried hard to hide them. Ah ! well, those kind of quarrels always end that way \u2014 I think I 've heard something of the sort at school. At all events, it's none of my business.\" Having sufficiently satisfied himself on that point, Captain Helmsley hastened his way to Ballinteer. There he heard from the men at work that the master of the Mount had recently returned home. But the young master of Ballinteer was still busy with some new directions he had got about the dogs and their comforts. \" You 've got the place a bit into ship-shape again, Annesley,\" said Captain Helmsley \u2014 \"and a fine old place it is, too.\""], [262, "254 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" We 've got some more hands than when you saw us last.\" \" By Jove ! \u2014 what a night it was ! And what a jolly night we made out of it !\" \" It 's very kind of you to sa)r so \u2014 and I think I ought to add you're very easily satisfied.\" This was a rather stiffish sort of reply, and perhaps the young man was going to put on his \" airs \" again. But Captain Helmsley had already made up his mind that it should not be so. That which he called \"jolly\" he determined should characterise their intercourse throughout. And he meant this, too. \" What though the maid be fair,\" had said this original young man to himseU \u2014 \" if she be not fair for me?\" Wherefore he made reply, \" Nonsense ! If you make the dogs as comfortable as the men, you will achieve great things with their owner. I wonder he ever let them out of his sight.\" \" Practically, he doesn't,\" said the young master of BaUinteer, compelled to thaw under the persistent good-nature of his visitor. \" He was here, just now.\" \" Yes. We missed on the way. I wanted to see him about the professional status of a man in town \u2014 a Mr. Darley.\" \"That 's his own solicitor.\" \" Yes \u2014 and solicitor to a good many other people, I find. Mrs. Ogleby gave me all the information I needed. It appears that this Mr. Darley had been solicitor to her father also.\" Whde he spoke, Captain Helmsley was conscious that the young man had directed a quick glance towards him. His face was now turned away \u2014 in fact, he was giving directions to a man regarding the arrangements for the dogs ; but, neverthe less, the glance had been perceived. Were the \" airs \" about to return again ? The young officer put on aU his frankness. \" Yes \u2014 it 's a family affair of my own \u2014 strange, but sad."], [263, "CAPTAIN HELMSLEY GOES TO TOWN 255 Two ladies, a mother and daughter, were entirely dependent on a nobleman's estate down in the south of the country.

The strange part of it is that these ladies have disappeared.\" \" That, too, is not strange \u2014 I mean uncommon, here. Like wounded creatures, they retire to some covert.

Peter must have been a robber himself, and Paul must have been an honest man ; thus, your trickster becomes a dispenser of justice.

More hospitable thoughts now intervened. \" You were drinking to Father Doyle. Here's to his health, by all means. May his shadow never grow less \u2014 whether we pull through, or not. Let us go back to your business.\" \" I must,\" said the visitor, as he looked at his watch\u2014\" I go up to town this evening, or in the morning, at furthest. You were kind enough to say something about a helping hand.\" \" Did I ? You will see Mr. Darley, of course. Also, I presume, you wiU call on such ladies as interest themselves in those relief committees which the dire exigencies of our times have called into existence. What else is there ? And yet \u2014 yes, I had something in my mind. Some time ago, a person wrote to me. He had been mixed up in the Police Protection formerly conferred on this estate, and had come very badly out of it. Some of the men had been actuaUy killed, and this"], [267, "CAPTAIN HELMSLEY GOES TO TOWN 259 one was disabled from active service in the Force. He writes to me that he now conducts private inquiries, and the like ; and asks for my custom and recommendation. He is a canny Northern, and hates this movement and those who are at the back of it. He will do your work with a will.\" A few moments enabled Annesley to regain possession of the letter he thus referred to. Then the two young men shook hands with more real feelings of friendship than they had yet done, and the visitor took his departure from Ballinteer. There had been no further reference to Arthur Ogleby, and there had been none at all to Kate. Nevertheless, there was this tacit understanding that something in the nature of good-will had been entered upon. One of them had just spoken of those rules and customs which belong to honourable warfare. There was to be no war, certainly. But even should that other disturber of the peace, love, make its appearance, which hardly could be said yet, then rules and customs equally honourable should be observed on both sides. Next morning the young English officer carried out his intention of going to town, and had his first interview with Mr. Darley, the Dublin solicitor. The interview itself was short, and afforded little further information to either of the two gentlemen who took part in it beyond that already in the possession of each. \"Mrs. Hilton spoke of your family \u2014 her own family, I believe, by some distant link \u2014 but appeared to have some resentment in her mind. I thought that that might have been overlooked in the troubles which have followed 1 \" \"There had been estrangement. There had been efforts to dissuade her and her husband from entering upon the course they had then in contemplation.\" \"Nevertheless, they entered upon it \u2014 with the results we"], [268, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 260 now know. That would act differently upon different dis positions. With some, resentment might grow harder \u2014 with others, the contrary would happen.\" Mr. Darley was suggesting an explanation, doubtless appearing to him tenable. So ran the young man's thoughts. Why not leave it so ? Certainly, he was in possession of other facts from his mother's letter. But was he called upon \u2014 would it conduce to the matter in hand, to go deeper into family matters, involving unpleasant pecuniary considerations also ? Then there was no proof to the young man that his father had entirely erased from his mind those feelings of trouble and annoyance which the event itself had given rise to. \" My mother belongs to your second class,\" he contented himself with replying, \"and I am acting for her.\" There was some further conversation. The young man showed him the names and addresses of those benevolent persons who formed a committee for the relief of ladies under distress from the like cause. Mr. Darley approved, requesting his visitor to inform him from time to time what progress he was making, and the interview terminated."], [269, "CHAPTER XXV. MONSIGNOR. THE succeeding week was a busy one with the young English officer. It was spent in a round of calls on those ladies with whose names he had been supplied. Nothing but the settled persistence of the young man now overcame the obstacles which he thus found in his path. These benevolent ladies had engaged in a task of a strictly con fidential character. They assisted those who applied to them by the sale of their work, or by pecuniary gifts, when such exchange did not come within the circumstances of the case. They even found out those who did not come forward, and helped their needs. But, in every case, this action was understood to be confidential. Without violation of this understanding, Captain Helmsley readily received all the aid to his search in their power, but on no occasion was he allowed to take the matter into his own hands. Thus his efforts became indirect, and so were protracted. There were even doubts whether he was on the right track at aU. \"Is your Mrs. Hilton an old person \u2014 we mean very old ? \" inquired one of these ladies. \"No \u2014 certainly not very old. I think she and my mother would be about the same age. My mother is still very active \u2014 and, I hope, will be for some considerable time to come.\""], [270, "262 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" And you have no reason to suppose, Captain Helmsley, that Mrs. Hilton is not now as active as Mrs. Helmsley?\" \"Except these reverses, I know nothing to make her so.\" \" And she had a daughter, who would now be about twenty -also active?\" \" So I should conjecture,\" said the young man. \" It is doubtful whether we could have been of any assist ance to Mrs. Hilton and her daughter, supposing application to have been made to us. We are but the dolers of funds which are limited, while the needful recipients are many. In a word, we help those who, in addition to these reverses, are precluded from helping themselves.\" \" You think that these ladies would not make application under their own, or assumed, names?\" \" They would know this, and probably would not apply to us at all. It would not be within our rules that assumed names should be used to us. Occupying the confidential position we do, we expect those who accept the aid we dispense to extend their confidence to us, though no further.\" Sometimes matters were not quite so formal as this, and even there were instances where there was an expressed wish to aid, and an unexpressed regret that such aid could not be given. \" I met your mother more than once,\" said Lady Vernon, on whom the young man had called. \" I have some recollection, too, of Mrs. Hilton. Was there not a connection?\" The call had been followed by an invitation ; she was now speaking to him, while her, other guests were variously engaged. \" A very distant one, by marriage. I called her aunt, though the relationship did not certainly amount to that. She had been a Miss Roy se.\" \" I remember her only as Mrs. Hilton. Her daughter gave"], [271, "MONSIGNOR 263 considerable promise, then.

They are certainly not on our Usts.\" \" I am told, now, that they could not be \u2014 in fairness and justice to still more urgent claims.\" \" Alas ! yes ; distinctions must be made, where all need.

You, too, are a foreigner, you know, and it may be that you will converse more freely together. I do not suppose he can help you very much, though he is beUeved to be pursuing inquiries in bye ways and channels which you have not yet tried, and probably will never reach.

How-"], [272, "264 THE TURN OF THE TIDE ever, I will do violence to any good manners I may possess, and drop a hint as to your present business in these parts.\" Lady Vernon retired, and presently returned, saying, \"You know, Mahomet had to go to the mountain. You must come to Monsignor.\" Lady Vernon's mysterious guest seemed somewhat relieved by the introduction ; whether he had become bored by the continued assumption of an enforced part, or anticipated new sources of information in a new order of mind. \" A countryman of your own ; is not that so, Lady Vernon ?\" But the hostess, having done her spiriting, had now left the two gentlemen to themselves. \"Lady Vernon is English by descent \u2014 but by that only, I understand,\" explained the younger of them. \" I would we were all of one soil, Captain Helmsley,\" said Monsignor, permitting himself to laugh at his own observa tions. \"Fairly wished for the Church Militant. But for other mihtants ?\" \"True for you, Captain. We cannot yet hope that aU swords will be beaten into ploughshares.\" \" Besides that, facts tend in the other direction.\" \"Ah, ha!- \u2014 just so. The big battalions grow bigger. England has much to be thankful for. She is an island.\" \"Why, so is this ; and yet -\" Monsignor did not repeat his laugh. But he made no reply which could be considered pertinent. Perhaps, even with \"a foreigner,\" it was not quite safe to discuss very near matters. \"They have got their troubles here,\" was his reply. \"So have most people, nowadays. Why should we expect to find singularity here \u2014 anywhere ? \""], [273, "MONSIGNOR 265 It was not pertinent ; a keener wit than that of the young soldier's might have accounted it evasive, and so taken the cue which politeness demanded. \"Perhaps it is to be found in the remedies they are using,\" was the reply of the blunt and sturdy Englishman. Monsignor no more laughed. But he seemed unable to entirely repress a twinkle of the eye, indicating a sense of humour which was at work within. Nevertheless, when he again spoke, there was a tone of regret in his words. \" You are a man of war. Perhaps your thoughts, if I dared to foUow them, lie legitimately within the scope of your profession. Alas ! that I may not even listen to them.\" Monsignor's placidity was imperturbable. There was, just then, a movement of leave-taking in the room, and he held out his hand to the young man with a kindliness which was certainly felt. \" Apollo does not always strain his bow,\" said the cleric. \" You mean to say that soldiers, on occasion, may pipe their tunes of peace ? \" \" Good ! You foUow me, Captain,\" said Monsignor, pleased to find himself better understood. \" You are engaged on a work of peace now, I understand. Accept my sincere wishes for your success.\" \" Well, how did you advance matters with Monsignor ? \" said Lady Vernon, as the duties of leave-taking afforded her some respite. \"Monsignor wished me success, and, I think, meant it. That was all.\" \" You did not expect more ? \" \"No. I think your promises went no further.\" \" Certainly. He was here, and you were here, and it occurred to me to bring you together.

You are learning now what it is to be otherwise.\" \" In the case of these poor ladies ? It does, indeed, appear so ; they have lost trust in all. They hide alike from friend and foe.\" \"Rather say, they have ceased to know one from the other. It was the first and greatest difficulty we had to meet, in our efforts toward relief. It came upon us by surprise.\" \" It is better known now ; already I have been warned of that.\" \"Do not despair.

He wishes to play fairly; hut, aU the same, he has his cards to play.\" \" Rather to watch the play as it proceeds ; is not that more like it?\" \" Well, yes, I suppose so.\" \" Take it what way you wiU, I fear I hardly encouraged confidence.

Believe me, a knowledge of this one aspect of the case \u2014 this dastardly engine of oppression on the unoffending and weak \u2014 must ensure its condemnation. I spoke of spite ; perhaps, I should have made a more full confession of \u2014 hatred. You have already heard of these victims losing their reason ; we, who come to know their pitiful tales, have much to try our own firmness of mind.\" The young man could only press the hand that was held out to him. He was the last to take his departure. \" When do you leave town ? \" \" I must report myself in a day or two at headquarters.\" \" Let me take your place while away. Come to town when you can, and come here.\""], [276, ""], [277, "CHAPTER XXVI. MACNAB. ON occasion, during this, his stay in town, the young man had run his eye over the newspapers. As he had himself said to Lady Vernon, the ordinary resources, such as adver tising, were not permissible. If those ladies chose to seclude themselves from public observation, there was no justification for drawing such publicity upon them. But, still, chance permitted \u2014 so he said to himself \u2014 that he might there find some hint, some clue, some reference even to those objects of his search. Thus, designedly, he selected that portion of the Press favourable to the movement in hand. Strange and curious to the law-abiding instincts of the young Englishman was this new course of reading. Hitherto, a glance over a morning's paper had sufficed him. Thus, new and bewildering to him was the discovery of busy commercial enterprises, deriving income and inspiration from disorder. He could not understand \u2014 perhaps no Englishman has ever entirely understood \u2014 this successful culture of fictitious grievance, with its still more wonderful result of a people's preference for the barren growth. The Daily Drum, the Banner, and the Beagle were all now hot on the BaUinteer scent. That apostacy of Father Doyle was a lucky \"find\" for these organs of disorganisation. The Mangerton \"run\" had been admittedly a good one, and had enabled the O'Dowds of the Press to keep their pens in active"], [278, "270 THE TURN OF THE TIDE operation, bringing more or less grist to the mills of their employers. But it was also admitted that nothing more was now to he got out of it. Lord Mangerton was beggared, the poor annuitants on the estate were driven to their holes and corners. All this these organs of disorganisation had agreed to do; and they had done it. But new sport must be found. Proverbially, eaten bread is soon forgotten ; not that anyone, outside the mill-owners, was the fuller by a crumb. Pro verbiaUy, too, virtue has to he its own reward. Thus, the only reward the tenants got was the certainty that these results had been brought about. Persons in that situation could not be left long to their own reflections, with safety. Hence the search for new game ; and hence the zest with which it was pursued when found. Young Helmsley did not precisely read with the aid of the commentary which is here supplied. Not but some conversa tions he had been holding o late were, in a measure, intro ductory. Still, the whole matter was puzzling to him \u2014 nay, well-nigh incredible. Out of very generosity, he was slow to believe that a mere trade \u2014 the trade of thus rearing discontent \u2014 should attain to the dignity of a distinct and independent form of industry which men might follow and live by. He read with the hope of finding some solution more in accordance with his capacity for understanding. But there was none forthcoming. As a soldier himself, he could understand fair and honourable warfare. As an Englishman, he could even better appreciate opposition to that which was not congenial. But for a people to leave the conduct of the war to this hand ful of meddling mercenaries \u2014 to hope, if there was hope, that such bounce and such bombast would successfully fight their battles for them ! \u2014 no, he failed to put himself into the position of such a frame of mind."], [279, "MACNAB 271 From these considerations, he turned to the primary object of his visit to town. But in that, too, failure was the result. There was no reference, no hint, no clue. In this ignoble mimicry of noble war, the pack had been carefully called off the old scent, and the welkin now rang exclusively with their cry on the new. He had one hope more. But was it quite a legitimate one ? In his honest wish to aid him, the young master of Balhnteer had given him a name and address, intimating, at the same time, that they belonged to a person now acting in the capacity of a private detective. He could not subject these ladies to the annoyance of public exposure through newspapers which were so readily to hand. Would this other aid be safe from the like objection? Much would depend upon the man on whom the office would devolve, and, obviously, there was no risk in seeing him. In this frame of mind, Captain Helmsley looked up the address thus supplied to him. \" Sergeant Macnab \" was written on the card he now held in his hand, and then followed a street and a number with which he was wholly unfamiliar. On inquiry, he found that the street, an obscure one, was somewhat distant, and he came to the resolution to summon this aid of modern civilisation by letter, in lieu of a personal, and perhaps unsuccessful, search. On the following evening, \" a person \" was announced as seeking an interview with him \"by appointment.\" The sergeant, or rather ex-sergeant, carried about with him none of the characteristics of his present, or his late, employment, if there be any such. He was plainly and unobtrusively dressed, avoiding ostentation on the one hand, or perhaps equally un desirable shabbiness on the other. So far, the young officer's doubts were satisfactorily answered ; the man who, with such"], [280, "272 THE TURN OF THE TIDE happy judgment, could discard all trappings of his trade was not only safe from giving offence, but also evinced some higher qualities of mind. As already described, he was a shrewd, keen Northern, and, amid his successive changes, had not yet succeeded in discarding his northern modes of pronunciation. He carried a stick, being his only evidence of that unfitness for more active service, to which Charles Annesley had already made allusion. Furthermore, there lingered a certain semi military air about the man, a close attention to the subordina tion of rank, a precision of manner which gained on his present employer, though probably these adjuncts were assumed, for the time being, with special reference to the circumstances and standing of that employer himseU. Captain Helmsley had called for lights, and, on further reflection with himself, for glasses. Macnab could be trusted so far without danger of undue familiarity, and, as the inter view was to be confidential, a sparing libation would probably assist that too. \"You take whiskey, I suppose?\" \"A little, Captain \u2014 when there is nothing pressing 'on.'\" The sergeant was as good as his word, and helped himself with moderation \u2014 probably from the same motive with which the offer had been made. Then, Captain Helmsley told his story. Very few words sufficed as regarded the latter part of that story ; for he judged, quite correctly, that with the detaUs of Lord Mangerton's property bis listener was already familiar. But the young man thought it advisable to say a word also in reference to preceding events, before the late Mr. Hilton had come over to the country. \" Naturally, it would be expected that his widow would first turn to us in her disaster. Previously, there had been estrange-"], [281, "MACNAB 273 ment ; she took her husband's side, and has continued to take it. We must suppose that to be natural, too.\" \"I mind his death; it will be about two years gone by \u2014 maybe a trifle more,\" added the speaker, with some apparent effort of memory. \" We did not even hear of it ; no doubt, that would be about the time. I can ascertain that more precisely from Mr. Darley.\" \"He'll he Lord Mangerton's sohcitor ? \" said the man, this time passing his hand across his brow. \"Yes.\" \" I may have to go down there myself \u2014 to Lord Mangerton's place.\" \"You will do whatever you think right and proper. It may provide a clue.\" \" Yes \u2014 that 's just it, Captain. I must get myself on the scent, somehow. When we come to a fault, we ' try hack,' pretty much as you gentlemen do in the hunting-field.\" Then, Captain Helmsley thought he would drop a word as to the delicate nature of the duties his agent was about to enter upon. So far, indications were in favour of the man. He was certainly the possessor of some tact, and already he had shown deference in his intercourse with those above him in rank. Nevertheless, a word in season could do no harm. \" You '11 excuse what I say,\" he concluded. \" Of course, I know you didn't learn your duties yesterday.\" \" Well \u2014 in a manner, yes. I don't know there is any school for our particular line of business. We join it mostly by accident \" \u2014 here the speaker pointed to his stick \u2014 -\" and we pick it up as we go along. I belonged to the regular Force, you '11 mind.\" \"The Constabulary? I think Mr. Annesley said so.\" a"], [282, "274 THE TURN OF THE TIDE The man nodded. \"I'm a Northern by birth \u2014 the only thing about me I can't conceal. Then, I got invalided.\" \" You seem active enough, yet.\" \"'Deed, yes, Captain \u2014 thanks to them that brought me round again. You wouldn't have said so if you had seen me as they saw me.\" \" Mr. Annesley said something about that, too. Was it a bad case ? \" \" It was just that \u2014 a regular case of smash. There were a number of us in it. Some of them were sent right off to ' kingdom come ' ; it was said I 'd have to follow. ' We '11 give him a chance, and send him up to town,' I heard the local doctors say. Then I heard or saw nothing, tiU I was in hospital in DubUn. Eh, but there 's great changes nowadays, Captain \" \" In the way of smashing a man.\" \" 'Deed, Captain, but there 's that, too. However, ye '11 understand, I was aUuding to my own treatment in hospital.\" \"They seem to have let you off pretty fairly, there. From your own account, I wouldn't expect to have seen so much of you, now.\" The man could afford to laugh at his own mishaps. \"I'm right enough now, Captain \u2014 and I was right enough before ; only, you '11 observe, there 's a wee bit slowness of memory of things about the precise time. Not but I'U do what I undertake \u2014 especially in the way of delicacy, you '11 take note.\" \"No doubt, the doctors had something to learn, too\u2014 and I believe they have learned it,\" said Captain Helmsley, kindly desirous to turn the conversation from too personal channels. \" Maybe, Captain ; I said nothing against them \u2014 because I wasn't thinking of them.

Ladies go in for everything, now.

The doctors could do nothing for me. I lay there, weeks and weeks. It was the nursing brought me round.\" \"Anyway, you're 'round' enough now,\" repeated Captain Helmsley, good-naturedly. \" Just so, Captain; only not active enough for the regulars \u2014 the Force.\" \"They have hard times of it, I beheve?\" \" Ah, they have all that ! \" \" Soldiers don't always sleep on feather beds either.\" \" 'Deed, no, Captain ; they have their times of war, too. But it always seems to be war with the Force now ; it 's just one long campaign. Maybe that's not the worst of it either.\" \" No ? \" said the Captain, responding to a certain look of serio-comic distress appearing on the face of his visitor. \" What 's the other thing ? \" \"Well, you see, Captain, it's somehow this way. Whether it 's peace or war with you \u2014 you '11 excuse the freedom \u2014 you 're always popular ; you '11 have to admit that.\" \" As a general remark, I suppose so,\" said the young officer, laughing. \" Quite so ; don't be afraid, Captain ; if I take a Uberty, it won't exceed a general one, as you say.

Only that 's verging on the particular \u2014 isn't it, now? WeU, if a young man was that smart, maybe the young women would allow him to pass a remark, say on the weather, it might be.\" \" And they won't now ? \" \" No, Captain, not now ; that is, when the mischief-makers have got it all their own way. Why, I 've seen a young girl's hair cut off for doing the like.\" \"Oh, shocking !\" said the young officer. \"It's quite a reign of terror.\" \" You have it now, Captain ; that 's just what does it \u2014 the terror ; the girls themselves are much about the same as other girls.\" \" Of course they are \u2014 perhaps more so.\" \" Well, I couldn't say, without going into particulars. Anyway, it 's not their fault. There, now you 'U understand how it is with the Force. They have to play against the house ; you know what that means, Captain ? \" \" Quite so ; let us hope the reign will be a short one.\" \" Amen ! There 's more than you wish that.\" \" These young women, now ? \""], [285, "MACNAB 277 \" Well, joking apart, Captain, you can see the Force is tried. No matter, it means to keep loyal, all the same. What was I on for telling you just now ? \" \" You hinted that you had to learn your new business.\" \" Ay ; like its members, it 's singular, you see. A man has to come in on the duties by actual practice. He can't go and learn his drill, as it were, and then take his first case in hand.\" \"And you meet with some clever people, I presume, on those ' irregular ' beats of yours ? \" \" My word, yes ! They 've had their drill, and, by the time they 're ' wanted,' they 've got a trifle beyond the goose step.\" \"Did you ever come to grief, sergeant? I mean since you joined this irregular part of the Force ? \" \"At first \u2014 yes, Captain. Did ever you hear tell of one Madame Victorine ? \" Captain Helmsley confessed his ignorance of the lady named. \" Well, mayhap she had as many names as dodges ; she called herself Madame Victorine here. She was my first case, and was like to be my last, for the laugh was terribly against me. The way of it was this. She was a clever actress \u2014 I mean a real actress on the stage, you '11 understand. I talked of our men playing against the house just now. It wasn't that way with Madame ; she had her houses with her. She took singing parts and dancing parts, and having as much brass as she had brains, she soon became the fashion. To continue the metaphor \u2014 she drew. Anyway, she got good engagements, lived extravagantly, and then disappeared, after getting a lot of jewellery from a Dublin house, without pay ment. How she managed that was none of my business ; I had only to find the lady, and bring her back here. ' We have traced her to the next American outgoing steamer, which"], [286, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 278 wUl touch at Queenstown for the mails,' said the superin tendent of my department. ' I '11 give you the job, Macnab, because you know her appearance \u2014 only, you '11 have to mind what you're about.' I had seen Madame more than once at the theatre, when I was on duty. I had taken enough stock of her to know her again if I saw her. That night, I was bowling down to Cork with the mails, only regretting that my first case was not a more intricate one. ' If she 's on board the steamer, I '11 have her ; and if she 's the jewellery with her, I '11 have that too \u2014 and I 'm a Dutchman if we part company after that.' Well, Captain, the superintendent's information was correct enough. The lady was on board. She had secured a nice little saloon cabin all to herself, and she was now walking on deck, among a number of other ladies and gentlemen, when I got on board in the morning. I had come off with the tender carrying the mails, and was told to look sharp, as there would be no delay after the sacks of letters were transferred on board. Madame let fall a few tears, but was civil and submissive. She owned to the jeweUery, but said she could explain aU that. I thought I would be civil too, and asked how I could assist her. ' I suppose I must go with you \u2014 you will send someone for my luggage when I am ready?' 'Your luggage will be looked after \u2014 particular, Madame,' says I \u2014 'we only ask a short toilet under the circumstances.' Then she tripped down the companion, saying she was pTetty used to ' a quick change ' \u2014 that was a Roland for my Oliver, and she carried the last laugh with her. WeU, never mind, so far I had done my business to my own satisfaction, and Madame was welcome to the laugh she got. We were a full mde from the shore ; unless the lady became a fish or a bird, she could not now leave the vessel without me. Presently she sang out that she was ready. I didn't half like"], [287, "MACNAB 279 the tone of voice, for there was still more of the laugh in it than the cry. I was right\u2014 blessed if, instead of dressing to come with me, she hadn't wndressed, and gone to bed \u2014 with all the jewellery on her, too ! I saw the situation at a glance ; she had the house with her this time, too. What was I to do ? I had thoughts of sticking to the vessel ; but my warrant was waste-paper out of British waters \u2014 -and I went back with the tender, thinking pretty small of myself for detective duties.\" The sergeant drained his whisky and water with his last word, and seized the happy moment to make his adieux. \" I return to quarters in the morning,\" said Captain Helmsley. \" When you have anything to report, it will find me there ; or, better, take a run down yourself ; we may want to have a talk.\" Then, Macnab finally got himself and his stick out of the room."], [288, ""], [289, "CHAPTER XXVII. PRETTY NAME\u2014 ISN'T IT? CAPTAIN\" HELMSLEY had returned to his quarters at the Curragh, on the morning following his interview with Macnab. He had been thoughtful during his journey down, and, on the succeeding day, was about to write to his new assistant Macnab, when the man himself was announced, having come down by a mid-day train. As yet, he had no report to make. \" You said something about further means of identification, Captain. I thought it safer to receive them by hand.\" \"I was about to post them,\" was the reply. \" Yes, I should not wish them to go astray.\" The young officer was stiU thoughtful, almost irresolute. On returning to his quarters, he had found further correspondence from his mother, enclosing portraits of Mrs. Hilton and her daughter. Possibly, these were the occasion of his irresolution, He had already prepared a packet. The portrait of the elder lady he added to it without any apparent hesitation. That of the other he left aside. It was that of a very young girl \u2014 both portraits had been taken some years before. However, he had not made up his mind, yet. Again, he untied the packet, and, finally, added the second portrait to it. Then he handed the packet to Macnab. All this he had done without explanation, or taking his new"], [290, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 282 assistant into his councUs. After that, he judged some words were necessary. \" I said something about the delicacy of the whole inquiry. I see I said enough. The packet, of course, you will keep to yourself \u2014 and return to me.\" Macnab himself had shown considerable discretion during the whole of this pantomime ; and the packet he now received in silence, putting it away about his person to obviate any further change of mind, if any further was in contemplation. A mystery connected with it he saw there was, but, all the more, he preserved an outward impassiveness of the fact By this time, the evening train for town was nearly due, and, promising to report his earhest inteUigence, the ex-sergeant took his leave. When seated in his railway carriage, Macnab withdrew the packet from the receptacle where he had placed it. His employer had tied it up with care, and carefully he now unwound the string, with the apparent intention that no portion of the secrets it enclosed should escape by hasty or indifferent handling. The portrait of the elder lady he laid aside, after such pre liminary study of it as would imprint it upon his mind. But that of the younger was not to be so readdy disposed of. Such a course of proceeding might be thought to indicate the reverse of that which his task suggested to him. For the elder lady would be the more likely to preserve traces of that which she had been. Not that time had stopped with her, and vicissitudes from without might be expected to make their changes, too ; stdl, she had reached a comparatively level summit, and was yet a long way off from her downhill journey. With her daughter it was different, and it might appear a hopeless task from the features of the chUd to puzzle out the probable"], [291, "PRETTY NAME\u2014 ISN'T IT? 283 appearance of a young lady, now calculated to be in her twentieth year. And, as might be inferred, the man did wear a puzzled and hopeless expression over his self-imposed contemplation. Several times in his journey he put it away from him, placing the portrait of the young girl with that of the elder, and tying up both with much appearance of settled permanency. But it was no use. Presently, he had the packet open again, and was studying the portrait of the young girl in all possible lights and distances. At last, hope lessness obtained the entire mastery over him, and the traveller reached the end of his journey in a dazed and bewildered frame of mind. When he arrived in town it was yet early evening, and instead of proceeding to his home, he took a seat in one of the refreshment rooms of the hotel connected with the terminus of his journey. It was time he pulled himself together, and practically commenced the task which had been assigned to him. He was now in possession of all the materials which he was likely to obtain, and this terminus was the last link uniting Dublin with the southern counties of the island. A 11 who passed to and fro, must almost of necessity, pass that way. In obedience to his polite request, a waiter brought him a small modicum of whisky. \" Have one yourself ? \" said the traveller, as he deposited the price of the two measures on the table before him. \"WeU, sir, as you are so pressing,\" was the equaUy polite reply of the waiter, as, gathering up the coins, he proceeded to the bar to supply himself with his own modicum. Macnab fiUed up his tumbler with water, refraining from tasting until the return of the waiter. Then the two men solemnly and simultaneously drank. \"You know me, Bob?\""], [292, "284 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" Sergeant Macnab ? I see you in and out here, occasionally. Been on business, now ? \" \"Well \u2014 private business. I don't belong to the regular Force, now \u2014 invalided,\" and he pointed to his stick. The period of the day was the least busy. The traffic of the day itself had ceased ; the night's traffic had not yet begun. The sergeant looked round the room ; he and Bob were the only occupants of it. \"Yes \u2014 private business; in search of missing parties. I don't do Government work, now.\" A waiter is prevented from any open manifestation of his political sympathies \u2014 it is his duty to entertain aU. Still, Bob was a man \u2014 and an Irishman, and he received the inteUigence with decorous satisfaction. Not, however, that his satisfaction was quite complete, yet ; an Irishman's sympathetic capacity, on the side of the oppressed, is large. \" Absconders ? \" \" Bless you ! no ; ladies \u2014 real ladies. You didn't happen to see any parties hke these ? \" Macnab had his packet untied, and now laid the portraits on the table before him. The waiter studied them, applying his hand across his forehead more than once ; but, finally, was obliged to take his hand away, in order to shake his head. \" So many passes through here.

I was in private business myself, then.\" \" Oh ! in a private gentleman's service \u2014 perhaps a noble man's ? \" The waiter nodded this time. Sergeant Macnab might take his choice of his own naming."], [293, "PRETTY NAME\u2014 ISN'T IT? 285 \" Excuse me passing the remark, but I did think you above your position here.\" Bob sipped some more of his whisky and water. \" We all have our ups and downs, Sergeant. Of course, it is a mixture.\" \" No doubt \u2014 no doubt. Well, about these here parties. They 're real ladies \u2014 you 'd have known that, if you was here.\" \" If I was here \u2014 and if they was here,\" said the waiter, undisturbed by the compliment. \" Just so. And what we 're doing, we 're doing for their advantage \u2014 I want you to understand that. Now, mightn't there be a record kept?\" \" Might \u2014 and might not. Most parties passes through, merely.\" \"That is so. But, supposing they stayed a night, or left their luggage until they sent for it ? I wish I could see the book for the year.\" \" Perhaps I might do that for you. Our young lady here is rather civil \u2014 I expect she has seen better things, herself.\" \" The young lady who keeps the hooks ? \" Bob repeated his nod, though, perhaps, with a trifle more impressiveness. \" You think you could introduce me to her ? \" \"I was proposing to take the responsibility upon myself; I may have more influence in that quarter.\" \" It 's easy to see where the breeding is,\" said the polite Macnab. But compliments did not unsettle the man. \" I presume it 's honour bright ? \" \" Honour bright it is ; neither you nor your young lady wiU ever come to harm through me.\""], [294, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 286 The waiter again retired, and presently returned with a volume, which he placed beside the sergeant. \" Our young lady is having her tea. She has entrusted the book to me.\" Macnab was soon deep in the perusal of it. After quarter of an hour's research he returned the book, with an expression of his thanks. \" Found what you wanted, Sergeant ? \" \" Well, we seldom find exactly what we are looking for \u2014 that is to say, right off. We get a hint here, and a notion there, and then we look them up. It 's done by degrees \u2014 pretty much as lawyers go to heaven.\" \" Precious slow work it must be, too.\" \" It 's all that. We wouldn't get to our journey's end at all, only we find those as are willing to give us a helping hand. I suspect there 's a bit of romance in this. WiU you tell your young lady, and she '11 be aU the more pleased for her help?\" When the sergeant found himself again in the street, it was already night ; but his labours were not yet ended. Pursuing his way for some distance along the river, and then striking off at right angles through narrow unfrequented streets, he at length found himseU opposite one of the larger public hospitals. Lights shone from all the windows ; but other appearance of life there was none, and sdence reigned all around. In obedience to his summons a door was opened, and Macnab found himself in a spacious tiled hall, he and the janitor being now the only occupants. The two men had exchanged friendly nods of recognition on the opening of the door. Macnab was the first to speak. \" Who 's in charge the night ? \" \"Dr. Driscoll.\" \" He '11 be in his own room now ? \""], [295, "PRETTY NAME\u2014 ISN'T IT? 287 The doorkeeper again nodded, and Macnab proceeded down one of the several long corridors opening off the hall. He tapped gently at a door about half-way down, and was ordered by a rather gruff voice to \" come in.\" \" Oh, Macnab ! What 's up now ? \" Dr. Driscoll was standing before the fireplace. Before him was a table plentUully supplied with medicine bottles. There were also a couple of easy-chairs, and a form, having no pretensions to easiness, near the door \u2014 now empty, but on which, at other periods, patients sat until their destinations in the house were arranged, or they were otherwise disposed of. \" Well, it is rather late, Doctor. Only I knew you would be up later still.\" Macnab had taken his seat on the form referred to, and now made this apologetic reply in answer to the query put to him. The Doctor yawned, wearily and audibly. Probably, that was his reply to the man's statement. He had hardly tackled to his work yet \u2014 he was now proceeding to change his day coat ; later on in the night he would have completely shaken off his forty winks and yawns. \"I have been down country on a bit of business,\" continued the sergeant. \"Detective business?\" inquired the Doctor, as he looked at some of the bottles on the table. His work had not really commenced yet ; he might as well talk to Macnab as go on yawning, and perhaps get sleepy again. The sergeant intimated that that was the nature of the task he had referred to. \"Glad to see you so active again, Macnab. Yours was a devilish tight squeeze. You 're aU right now ? \" \" In a manner, Doctor. Thanks to you \u2014 and the nurses.\" \" In a manner ! Why, you didn't expect us to make a"], [296, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 288 better man of you than you were? I can teU you we had our own doubts about the matter. You are a walking miracle, that's what you are.\" \" Yes, Doctor, I can get along. I don't think I 'm so clear about the upper story, though.\" Dr. Driscoll had not been paying much heed to his visitor ; he had found some new interest in his own preparations for the coming night. But now he directed a quick glance toward him. \"You were described to us as a temperate man, I think, Macnab. I don't suppose you would have pulled through if you weren't.\" \" I 'm pretty much about the same still. I can take it, and I can let it alone. There 's no harm in that, I suppose ? \" \" Humph ! Our profession is not unanimous on the subject. What do you mean \u2014 or do you mean anything at all ? \" \" Confusion of memory now, Doctor \u2014 try to recognise likenesses, and can't.\" \" Shouldn't wonder if you forgot all before you came here. We find that in cases like yours.\" \"I don't. I'm talking about being here.\" \" Oh, that 's more likely stiU ! You know me ? \" \" I know you, Doctor ; and I know Sister Mary \u2014 leastways, I should call her Mrs. Morris. Is she in the house this present time, Doctor?\" \" Don't know ; I '11 see, if you like.\" Dr. Driscoll applied his mouth to a tube, and, a few minutes after, submitted his ear instead. \" Ward 4. You know the way, I suppose ? \" The sergeant intimated that his memory would carry him that far, and left the room. Dr. Driscoll had lost interest in his case, and had probably some others to attend to."], [297, "PRETTY NAME\u2014 ISN'T IT? 289 Instead of the corridors, this time the sergeant selected one of the large staircases, which also opened off the outer hall. Apparently he was well and favourably known, for all who met him in his progress had a word for him. Here night was turned into day ; everywhere there was light and life and movement, though all equally subdued. The visitor to one of our large public hospitals must now be of stern mould who does not experience some emotional promptings within him. There is so much to do, and so much is done of the very best kind, toward the relief of humanity. One patent result may he stated. Whereas an order for admission was once regarded in the light of a death-warrant, now it is eagerly sought, cheerfully complied with, and grate fully had in remembrance. But the visitor need not necessarily conclude his experience with such emotional promptings, which are, for the most part, evanescent. He may even undergo change of mind himself. So many \" cases \" \u2014 so many histories \u2014 which ought not to fail in teaching a philosophy of their own. Is our visitor affluent, or even above the pecuniary troubles of the hour ? then let him study the bodily diseases, complicated by mental cares, which lie around him. Here the aid of the family, tardily succumbing to the strain, has at length resigned himself to the aid of others. There a mother, taken from her children, hopes for returning health during these silent watches of the night. Mere bodily disease is trying under all circumstances ; but how greater the trial when there is added loss of help to those dependent upon our exertions ! He will see very much of this here. Thus the visitor, unless beyond the reach of such teaching, may \"walk \"those public hospitals even with beneficial change to himself. \" Why, it 's Sergeant Macnab, I declare ! \" said Sister Mary, T"], [298, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 290 as that person at length arrived at his destination. \" We can't do anything more for you, can we ? \" \" Even if you couldn't, you wouldn't lessen my obligations, Mrs. Morris,\" said the polite sergeant. \" Call me Sister Mary ; everyone here does, you know.\" \" Ah, but I 'm not here now ! Why should I make that free ?\" \" I don't know that anyone means a freedom, and I don't take it as such. If they think I don't like to be reminded of the past, they are about right.\" And Sister Mary heaved an involuntary sigh, probably not intended for Macnab's ears. \" Never mind the past, Mrs. Morris. There will be a future, yet. I hear a thing now and again, though I don't belong to the regulars any more. His conduct is good ; in time, that must count. When you look at it that way, you needn't take it so badly.\" \" How do you want me to take it ? How would he take it? Most of them have gone from bad to worse, when they 've had \u2014what do you want me to caU it ? \u2014 the indulgence.\" The fact was not to be contradicted. StiU, Macnab, whether in the interests of truth or otherwise, would offer comfort. \" The lesson has been a hard one \u2014 you won't deny that. Well, he has learned it \u2014 or will, by the time his case comes up for consideration. Now, I '11 be bound his letters tell you that \u2014 when he gets a chance to write them, poor fellow ! They 're full of promises. Come now, you '11 have to agree with me this time?\" \"And you're just the sort of man to believe in promises. aren't you, now?\" Thus directly questioned, the expert refrained from answer ; it may be he thought his professional reputation concerned in a not too credulous form of mind. Sister Mary herself came to his help."], [299, "PRETTY NAME\u2014 ISN'T IT? 291 \" Well, never mind, you 're a good and grateful creature. What brought you here to-night?\" The question might not he considered in entire harmony with the commendation. Perhaps that was the reason Macnab directed his reply to the former. \" Why wouldn't I ! Where would I be now only for you, and \u2014 and the other young lady that brought me through? All the more, I am minding what I am telling you. It 's the opinion of them that know, or are in a position to know. If all goes well, your husband will get his liberty. Maybe, the learning the lesson was a hope of my own. Anyway, why shouldn't we both hope ? \" \"I hardly know,\" said Sister Mary, sadly. \"You under stand the net these wretches have woven for their dupes, as well as I do. They may stay in prison, safely enough. But if they come out honest and loyal men \u2014 where will they be safe then?\" \" It is so now,\" said the sergeant. \" What I said, and what I hope, can only be in the future \u2014 you wiU understand that ; and things may be different then. I know the net is strong and wide. But the world is wide, too. I have heard since of what I told you \u2014 and I will hear more.\" Sister Mary had been betrayed into a display of feeling. Already she had recovered herself. \" When you do you can teU me. Let us change the subject now. Yes, Miss NevUle has often talked about you. She always called you her policeman, you know.\" \"Now!\" said the gratified sergeant. That was the other young lady ? Maybe, she recollects me, still ? Pretty name, Neville \u2014 ain't it ? \u2014 like a name you 'd get out of a book, now ?\" Certainly, Sister Mary had succeeded in putting a strong check upon her feelings, for she now indulged in something"], [300, "292 THE TURN OF THE TIDE in the nature of a laugh, though, to be sure, a quiet and decorous one, suitable to the place and time. \"Oh! that's the subject that brought you here to-night! You might have told me that at first \u2014 only, I know you couldn't.\" The expert did seem a trifle taken aback. He had been endeavouring to lead up to his subject professionally. And lo ! it was now sprung upon him. \" You're not angry with me, Mrs. Morris 1\" \" Not I. I know you would harm neither me nor \u2014 nor Miss Neville \u2014 not though you should found a professional reputation upon it.

Now what is your business with this young lady ?\" \"Miss Neville?\" \"Yes, Miss Neville. Perhaps there are some other young ladies you are curious about, too?\" But the sergeant was not to be disconcerted by ridicule this time. He had repeated the name with a purpose, and he had carefully listened to the intonation of Sister Mary's reply. It did appear to him there was somewhat of insistance in it. As for the ridicule, was that to throw him off the scent, too ? He replied \u2014"], [301, "PRETTY NAME\u2014 ISN'T IT? 293 \"No, there is no one else at present, only this Miss Neville.\" \"And your business?

Now, if you can, don't beat any more about the bush.\" \" I 'U try,\" said the submissive sergeant \u2014 \" only, you know, you said something like that before.\" \"And I say it again \u2014 because it produced no effect. Trust me \u2014 as I teU you I will trust you.\" \" I will, Mrs. Morris \u2014 right off. I reaUy want to see this young lady. It may be only that, and nothing more ; I can't say at present \u2014 not even U I tried. Is she in the House now?\" \"No. She is not attached here now. She has got her training, and practises it whenever required. At present, she is with her mother.\" \" Oh ! there is a mother ?\" \" Yes \u2014 if that will be any assistance to you. Miss Neville had a mother \u2014 and she has her still.\" \"WeU, can I see them? Isn't that straightforward, now?\" But it was Sister Mary's turn to betray some irresolution. She was losing no faith in her visitor ; she would intrust him with all that was reasonable and fair. But the wishes of others were to be consulted, too \u2014 all the more as, to some extent, Mrs. Neville had made a confidante of her. That confidence she had certainly no right to impart to another, without consulting her previously. \" Your request seems reasonable\u2014 and I know it is honest.

Then, I will let you know the result. Now, I must resume my duties in the ward.\" On this hint, the sergeant took his departure. A man of his caution in his own movements could raise no objection ; though he did repeat, for the last time, \"Pretty name, Neville \u2014 what do you think, now?\" \"Yes, yes \u2014 you asked me that before.\" \"Ay, Mrs. Morris \u2014 but you didn't answer me.\" \" Well \u2014 I may ; when I see these ladies.\" With this Macnab had to content himself, and finally disappeared."], [303, "CHAPTER XXVIII. IT'S ALL IN THE AIR. IN a previous chapter it has been recounted how the young master of Ballinteer, after his day's work had been done, sat down and wrote a certain letter to a young lady. If the reader has not already lost sight of the circumstance, he may call to mind that the letter was written with some tentative efforts, and that its final outcome was an expression of contri tion \u2014 only. In writing to a young lady, it is not absolutely necessary to indulge in the language of love ; still, it is allowable, and perhaps expected, that youth and beauty should evoke some warmth of words, even if it be only in the words. In such case, if a young man does not dare to be a lover, he may at least be an admirer. But, in writing to Kate Ogleby, Charles Annesley refrained from the language of admiration even, though he tried hard to get in a little liveliness, telling her of her father's cares and anxieties about his sick hounds. Finally, in an excess of propriety, he made her father the bearer of the missive. Arthur Ogleby had handed the letter to his daughter, without question or comment. Any inquiry he would have thought unworthy of himself and the chdd in whom he had implicit trust. Charles Annesley was a gentleman, and his daughter was \u2014 his daughter. In the simple philosophy of the Master of the Mount, that was the situation."], [304, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 296 Assuredly, Mrs. Ogleby's confidence in her daughter was no less great; nor did she in the least doubt the young man. Still, the situation might be talked over; besides, there was something else on her mind. \"Kate showed me her letter. It appears there has been some little misunderstanding since he dined here, and he thought it necessary to make this explanation.\" Mrs. Ogleby looked at her husband as she said these words. She would like to have a talk with him as she had talked to her eldest daughter on the subject. But, then, men are so different ; and Arthur Ogleby was so different from other men. Not, indeed, that that talk with Sophia had left such pleasant feelings after it. \" Never is a long day, mamma.\" These words had not been quite agreeable to hear, nor was her further reflection over them any more so. She had read this letter, which her youngest daughter had dutifully handed to her, with some attentive care. Not that she had the least fear of finding a love-letter. But she desired to draw from her own observation whether any word, any form of expression, implied more than met the eye. But no \u2014 the young man who had penned this letter had never used a warmer form of language to the recipient. She must admit that, unless she believed Charles Annesley, and_ her daughter, too, to be deeper adepts in deception than she gave them credit for. Nothing more had been written \u2014 nothing more had been said. But was this quite all? Certainly no daughter of hers would commit the impropriety of falling in love with a man who had not hit upon some form of expression intimating that the love was previously on his side. But, then, there was much in the position of Charles Annesley to induce a romantic sympathy in the mind of a young, generous, and unsuspecting girl, as she knew her daughter to be. A young"], [305, "IT'S ALL IN THE AIR 297 man, the last of his house, opposed to unjust and over whelming odds \u2014 why, she sympathised with him herself, though she was no longer young, and was rather prejudiced against men who could not marry. Thus it was that she looked toward her husband, as she said those words. At that precise moment, Arthur Ogleby was busied in some preparation for the coming grouse season, in the looking up of the necessary accoutrements, so that she could talk, and he could hear, with an occasional answer if it pleased him to he so gracious, without any appearance of set purpose. \" Is there any hkelihood of this young man retrieving the fortunes of his house?\" Thus she continued to avail herself of the occasion. \" Of his house ? \u2014 certainly not. The old people left the property worth very little \u2014 after paying interest on incum brances. Before rents are paid again, there must be a sub stantial and a large reduction made upon them ; that will leave the property worth even less. Then, it has to be reclaimed from the absolute wilderness these blackguards have reduced it to.\" Mr. Ogleby found he could talk and make his prepara tions, too, wherefore it pleased him to be thus gracious. The blackguards here referred to were those who had pro claimed the Plan of Campaign upon the Ballinteer estate. \"Father Doyle is endeavouring to effect some arrangement?\" \"That is the only arrangement he, or anyone else, can effect \u2014 or even propose. He may get his people to make some concession \u2014 he may persuade them, now that they have had some trial of the other thing, that a bird in the hand is better worth than the whole flock in the bush ; but Annesley would have to make some concession, too.\""], [306, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 298 \" And concession on his part would leave him \u2014 nothing ? \" \" Roughly speaking ; and the more the waste, the less there will be left. Now, if he could let the thing grow.\" \" That is, if he would live on this nothing ? \" \" Nothing, or something else.\" \" What else is there ! \" \" WeU, it 's pretty much in the air, at present \" \" And young men can't marry on that.\" \" Marry ! \u2014 who wants to marry ? \" After these words, Mrs. Ogleby hardly ventured to question her husband further. He was now rubbing his gun with a bit of chamois, and apparently was bestowing all his attention, and aU his available efforts, upon the task. Besides, to what ultimate end? He was thinking of Charles Annesley as a brother sportsman only \u2014 and he was not thinking of his daughter at all. If he could not \" take \" her \u2014 she could not tell him ; the situation was certainly immature for that. Therefore, she contented herself with saying, \" I am sorry for the young man.\" \" So are a good many people. Perhaps, something could be done for him.\" \"What is it, Arthur?\" \" Brabazon has been speaking to me, and some others of the county people \u2014 the officers at the Curragh, also. They asked me what I was going to do about the hunting, this season.\" \" What are you going to do ? \" \"The dogs are over at Ballinteer ; I told Annesley I would never bring them back here.\" \" Arthur ! I would not like that.\" \"To have them poisoned here ! \" \" But Mount Ogleby without the hounds ! and you without your hunting ! \""], [307, "IT'S ALL IN THE AIR 299 \" Other men hunt who have no hounds \u2014 why should not I ? It 's only till I get a little older. Maybe \" \" Yes, dear \u2014 maybe ? \" \" I ought to have done it long go. Some laughed at me \u2014 others \" Here some part of the fowling-piece required very especial rubbing, and Mr. Ogleby committed himself to the task with renewed vigour. \" That 's all past now \u2014 perhaps it will be arranged as \u2014 as if it had not happened. You are sure the County Hunt would he re-established, then ? \" \" It is aU in the air. I am to meet some of the men to-morrow. It is our first day at the grouse, hut I know the matter wiU be talked over. Later on, a week or two hence, there wiU be a regular meeting of the county gentlemen to discuss the question of hunting the county again.\" \" But it had to be discontinued before ? \" \" Many things have happened since \u2014 or will have happened before this meeting. My intentions will be known. Father Flanagan, who provoked the farmers to resist the Hunt, has had his setting down \u2014 Father Doyle, a man of the opposite kind, wants to be able to make an offer to his Ballinteer people.\" \"And this might enable Father Doyle to make such an offer?\" \" I cannot say \u2014 it 's aU in the air ; only, if I were Father Doyle, I know what I should do.\" The preparations for the following morning were now at an end; at least Arthur Ogleby, by his manner and move ments, intimated as much. Then Mrs. Ogleby had to rest contented with that which she had said and heard. Perhaps, it was not altogether to no purpose. It might even be that her husband was not thinking of Charles Annesley as"], [308, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 300 a brother sportsman only. Thus it was that when Kate asked her mother what she should do about \"that letter,\" Mrs. Ogleby had replied, \" Why not do what Mr. Annesley suggests ? \u2014 accompany your father when next he goes to Ballinteer.\" And we have already seen that this was done. But, in the meantime, the Master of the Mount had his day's shooting. The \"some men\" he had made mention of were this Mr. Brabazon, over a portion of whose grounds of Killgobbin they were to shoot, and Colonel Cheviot, with a couple of his subalterns, Lieutenants Gatesby and Horner. Mr. Brabazon reported weU of the birds. \" They tell me the packs are large and strong on the wing. I fancy we will find them a trifle wild.\" \" WiU the dogs he safe with those fellows ? \" The fellows referred to were the two lieutenants, luckily not within earshot. Arthur Ogleby naturally regarded proficiency in sporting matters as the result of time and experience. As naturally, his first consideration was for the safety and comfort of his dumb companions. \" Oh, I fancy so. I told Cheviot to bring a couple more guns with him. Of course, a gun implies a man qualified to handle it. We must take it the elder man knew what he was about.\" Presently the veteran had sufficient proof of the propriety of Colonel Cheviot's selection. He fired, and missed his bird. Lieutenant Horner fired too, and the bird feU. The un pretending tyro had \" wiped his eye \" for him. '\u25a0 The sun was full in your face, Mr. Ogleby. I didn't like to let the bird go,\" said the lieutenant, apologetically. \"Perhaps it was the sun,\" said the gentleman addressed. \"Anyway, that was a neat shot of yours. You've had some lessons in this sort of thing ? \""], [309, "IT'S ALL IN THE AIR 301 \" I 've got a month or six weeks every season for some time now. I had arranged to go over to Scotland this year \u2014 but Helmsley had some business away, and I took his place. Of course, anyone might miss a bird like that.\" Arthur Ogleby was not at all hurt, and needed no apology. The affront to him would have been far greater had he been compelled to keep company all day with blundering com panions. \" I wondered I did not see Captain Helmsley with you,\" he replied, in reference to the mention of that gentleman's name. \" He 's away, you say ? \" \" Yes, he 's away\u2014 quite a mystery. There 's a lady in it ; in fact, I believe two.\" \" Oh, I 'm sorry for that ! \" \" Sorry for what, Mr. Ogleby ? \" \" Sorry that he 's not here. There 's talk of reviving the County Hunt; I suppose you know? He takes an interest in these matters. However, if he's better engaged \" \"No. These ladies can't be found, it appears \u2014 if that is what you mean. I know Helmsley takes a strong interest in the project you refer to. You may have him here any day, now. He 'U do anything you want, I 'm sure.\" \"At present we want subscriptions.\" \" Helmsley is your man for that. The money is there, you know, and the will, too.\" \" The subscriptions will be strictly limited ; there 's precious little money here, I can tell you.\" \"That arrangement will suit us poor devils, all to pieces. Everyone can't be born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\" \"I don't know about that,\" was the reply of the elder. \" When a man goes to Scotland every year he must have come by the silver, some way or another.\""], [310, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 302 \"A Uttle of it goes a good way, there. I suppose the principle is much the same as that you just mentioned?\" \"In the way of limiting our subscriptions? I wish I could say so; but it's Hobson's choice with us, now. We never dreamed of that, as long as there was a shot in the locker. It 's well some one can come to our help. Perhaps we 'd make an exception in case of the rich young Englishman \u2014 that is, if he turns up,\" said Mr. Ogleby, laughing. \"Helmsley wiU do what he can,\" said Lieutenant Gatesby, who had heard some of the latter observations. \" But don't ran away with the story. 'T is true he 's an eldest son ; but his father is alive still, and is reported to he a close man ; though, I believe, there 's some excuse for that. Some years ago, so it was told to me, he was pushed hard to raise a loan on the money market.\" \" I doubt if any pushing would effect that for us \u2014 eh, Brabazon ? \" said the Master of the Mount, repeating his laugh. \"Well, yes, Mr. Ogleby, in the present state of your country. All the same, it was humiliating to the owner of an English county estate. However, I believe the Helmsleys have got over that now.\" After that, the sport divided all the men. Nor was conver sation renewed again until there was a more general gathering under a clump of trees, there to examine into the contents of a certain hamper which awaited them. But the incident of the morning was too good for their host to pass over without some comment. \" You 've been teaching these young fellows how to shoot, Ogleby?\" \" No, they have been teaching me. Come, Brabazon, you knew Lieutenant Horner was a shot ? \""], [311, "IT'S ALL IN THE AIR 303 \"I didn't, indeed. I told you I trusted to the Colonel's choice.\" \" What has he been doing 1 \" said the gentleman last named. \" Only wiping my eye for me,\" was the reply of Arthur Ogleby, whose laugh was not the less ready over the occurrence. \"Ah, weU, if anyone else did that, the matter might caU for inquiry. But it 's Horner's one speciality ; not that I brought him here for that purpose.\" \"And we aU know what Mr. Ogleby's speciality is,\" said the other lieutenant. \" You 're right, Gatesby,\" was the reply of his colonel. \" Were not we going to have some talk over this County Hunt business? Many of us think there is only one possible Master among us.\" The Colonel looked at Arthur Ogleby as he said these words. It was not that he had forgotten what he had already suggested on this subject. Nor was mere compliment in his thoughts ; though, as the man had taken his lesson with such real and unfeigned good-temper, some such tribute of commen dation might be added. Something else was in his mind. What were the actual intentions and wishes of the owner of the Mount ? Might they be elicited by some such random observation ? But the gentleman looked at shook his head in response. \" Every dog has his day, Colonel \u2014 at least, so the saying runs. We all get our warnings, too. It may have been the sun, to-day \u2014 or your friend's speciality may be owned to without discredit. Anyway, let us give the young fellows a chance while we can.\" There was silence, until Mr. Brabazon again spoke.

Suppose we leave details until then ? \" \" Agreed, say all of us,\" was the reply of the Colonel. \" Brabazon,\" added Arthur Ogleby, with some solemnity, \" try Father Doyle with one ? \" \" With a notice \u2014 an invitation to the meeting ? Would he come ? \" \" Well, try him,\" repeated the owner of the Mount."], [313, "CHAPTER XXIX. MONSIGNOR AGAIN. FATHER DOYLE had put that note of the editor of the Daily Drum into the fire, vouchsafing no answer to the writer ; thus he could treat that portion of the subject. But it was not so with the newspaper articles themselves, to which the note specially drew his attention ; they would do their work throughout the country, whether he made a holocaust of his own particular pile of them, or not. Then had come that other note from Mr. Brabazon, inform ing him of the impending meeting at Killgobbin House, and requesting his attendance, if considered sufficiently within the sphere of his duties and other avocations. Mr. Brabazon had not only adopted the solemn \u2014 not to say impressive \u2014 suggestion of his old friend and neighbour, the Master of the Mount, but had even taken some special pains with this particular missive ; for, whereas all the other invitations were merely in circular form, this one had been cast in a personal, and more friendly, mould. Nor was such an invitation out of the way, though recent events had caused Mr. Brabazon to regard the proposition, at first, with some surprise. For, or against, the Catholic clergy had always identified themselves with such movements ; and, latterly \u2014 this was, perhaps, the only local instance of \" against \" \u2014 Father Flanagan's action had assumed a most active form, thus causing to Mr. Brabazon u"], [314, "306 THE TURN OF THE TIDE his early hesitation, hut which eventually yielded to his recollection of the well-known sporting sympathies of the gentleman himself. Thus, there was neither reason nor in ducement why Father Doyle should put that note into the fire, too. Nevertheless was it to him the source of further perturbation of mind. If such things had happened in the green wood, what would now happen in the dry ? If he had been thus put in the pillory for a wish \u2014 hardly, as yet, had it exceeded that \u2014 for some peaceful solution of the affairs of one landlord, what would be the extent of his punishment if found at the council-table of all the landlords of the county ? No, he did not put this note into the fire \u2014 rather, placing it on his own table before him, after more than one perusal, while he thought over the whole situation with himself. What had he been charged with, already ? Deserting his people, and fighting the battle of their adversaries ! Such a charge belonged to those mixed statements much more difficult to refute than undiluted falsehood ; the one can be contra dicted, roundly \u2014 the other needs explanation. Such had not been his motives at aU, when attempting to interfere between the owner of Ballinteer and his tenants. He wished well to the young man, and desired that a solution of his difficulties might be found \u2014 but certainly not at the expense of his flock. If there had been no other consideration in the matter, possibly the carnal man in him would have preferred a clear stage and no favour, letting the combatants arrange their own affairs. Why, then, had he interfered ? Because the rules of fair fighting had been shockingly violated. He had not moved untU outrage had gone on to actual murder. Surely, it was time to bestir himseU then ! Thus, if he should meet the charge, he must be allowed to explain. But who wanted his explanation? Not the"], [315, "MONSIGNOR AGAIN 307 stirrers-up of strife, certainly. To them, all things were allowable, so long as there was strife. They listened only to those who fought their battles. To the peacemakers they turned a deaf ear. And yet that was only one part of that explanation which nobody wanted to hear. The remaining part lay, perhaps, still more heavily upon his mind ; as impending events will, in contrast to those which have passed. The one action had been the result of unquestioning impulse, the other \u2014 if he was indeed to take it \u2014 had its inducement in reason and charity. The legal steps necessary toward dispossessing the tenants of their holdings on the Ballinteer estate had long been taken, as far as they could proceed in an actual court of law. The decrees had been granted, and the period was now drawing to a close when the act of dispossession would itself be carried out. Father Doyle did not like to draw some comparisons, even in his own mind. As a man \u2014 as a clergyman, it was his duty to believe that nothing more shocking could occur than that which had already happened \u2014 the violent and illegal taking away of human life. But this near prospect of a clearance on the land was very dreadful to him, too. It may be the experience of the Irish Catholic clergy, it may be that principle of heredity which the man of science teUs us comes down in growing development from parent to offspring ; certain it is that the eviction of his flock is to the Irish priest the most awful of human catastrophes. Yet, again, who would listen to this portion of his explanation ? Was it not perfectly notorious that the strifemongers desired to see scenes of this description carried out to their minutest detail? With them, as with him, eviction passed as the accursed thing. But woe to the man who attempted com promise, or sought to mitigate a horror ! In the days of his"], [316, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 308 studentship, Father Doyle had read how, in times of old, men fought with each other, and with wild beasts, for the amusement of those who applauded or denounced, as their humours led them. What was the difference now ? Did not these leaders of the people as loudly demand their \"panem et eircenses \" ? Thus there was no explanation for him, because there was no one to listen to it. He must justify himself to himseU, and then be firm in the position which he took. And had not his departure already been pronounced enough ? He must now have a care that he did not also justify those charges which had been made so public against him. He had risked his influence for peace' sake. Was it incumbent upon him \u2014 was it judicious to run further risks, that foxhunters might follow their sport ? No ; let the foxhunters settle their own affairs at their own meetings. Then a visitor was announced to him. It was now late in the day ; in fact, the day itself had already passed. And it had been a heavy day's work with him, in a mental, as well as in a physical sense. His people were many, stretching up mountains and into bogs, where often his dumb, four-footed companion had to be left on the way. Each \" call \" his Church had constituted a matter of imperative and immediate compliance. But it was not the weariness of body so much the priest had been conscious of during this long day. What was to be the end of this strife, which they waged without heart, and without real hope ? Thus he had returned weary ; and now, toward the day's ending, he sat solitary over his fire, evolving the thoughts which have gone before. His Church forbade him domestic companionship and affections, teUing him his people were to be his children ; and he had made it so. What was now to become of these, his children ?"], [317, "MONSIGNOR AGAIN 309 Nor was this quite all. More purely personal considerations were not absent from his mind now, nor for some time pre viously. He thought his Bishop looked coldly on him at their last interview. Was it only a thought? Certainly, that prelate's approval of these campaign movements was neither secret, nor even reserved. The consideration was a personal one, though not a selfish one. He wished to do his duty, and to be regarded in such light. Then had come this announcement, or, rather, warning of an approaching visitor on the part of his housekeeper. And it had been made to him with some signs of mysterious concern, which communicated itself in a manner to Father Doyle. The various \" patriotic \" periodicals, which litter every priest's room, he bundled away into a corner. But the note \u25a0 \u2014 Mr. Brabazon's note \u2014 he permitted to remain open on the table, where he had left it. Already has it been related how certain persons \u2014 \"organ isers,\" as they were called \u2014 visited various districts, leaving behind them this spirit of strife and ill-will. They came to sow the wind, knowing that others were to reap the whirlwind which was to follow. But all this had been already done in that particular district, as also has been related. The wind had been indeed sown, and there was now the awful lull which preceded the whirlwind itself. These makers of mis chief had done their work too well to need a further return upon it. Besides, Father Doyle was not now, nor ever, the man they would have taken into their confidence. Whatever was to be his next step, he had shown himself too much the advocate of peace, and a modus vivendi, to suit their book. But it has been further related in this story how others, too, had been in search of that very modus vivendi, and of such there has been given a passing glimpse, on the occasion of"], [318, "310 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Captain Helmsley's visit to the kind and hospitable Lady Vernon. Father Doyle was not now thinking of the strife mongers. But his mind certainly recurred to Monsignor, as he bundled their literature out of sight. The parish priest did not readily regain his composure. The room itself was somewhat shabby, and a trifle cheerless too. Probably he had not observed it before, but he would now do all possible honour to his visitor. He roused the fire which had faUen low, and appeared to have done the right thing after all, for Monsignor warmed his hands, whether because they were cold, or in courteous appreciation of his host's intentions. By the time his housekeeper brought in tea, matters looked more cheery. That question of refreshment was the subject of short, though acute, thought to the parish priest. Whisky punch was clearly out of the question ; to say nothing else, it would be levelling a high church dignitary with a neighbouring parish priest, to whom, on such a late and cold evening, the whisky-punch would be a matter of course. But, then, this high church dignitary was cold, and so Father Doyle suggested the tea. Thus he scored another success. Clearly, Monsignor was in a humour to be pleased with his host. The objectionable articles of disorder had been bundled out of the way, but they were still in the mind of the parish priest. So, too, he could not doubt, were they in the mind of his guest. Father Doyle could put that note of the editor of one of them into the fire. But Monsignor would find the articles themselves on every priest's table in Ireland. \" Your Eminence lacks no description of me,\" he could not help remarking, in the lightest tones he could assume. \" Heaven will acquit me, if the world may not, of having courted such notoriety.\" \" Suppose we speak as man and man?\" said the visitor, even"], [319, "MONSIGNOR AGAIN 311 more lightly, yet with an emphasis indicating some command. \" Or, better again, as the clergymen we both are ? Yes, there has been description, and, to those who have the wit to read between the lines, it may have been possible to find the truth. I had my own idea of Father Doyle ; nevertheless, pardon those friends who have desired to see him face to face.\" \" Alas ! they can but see distress and uncertainty.\" \" The position has its embarrassment. As for the rest \u2014 tut 1 Verbis aspenbus ossa nulla franguntur.* They hurt for the time, wherefore they are used.\" The parish priest was not prepared for so much confidence. Was his visitor actually condemning ? Assuredly that was not all, as who could know better than Monsignor himself ! He only spoke of words now \u2014 of such asperities \u2014 of abuse, more or less teUing. But were there not acts also ? for which there had been found no better defence than this abuse. \" Is there not something beyond ? \" he ventured to inquire. \"Let us go so far; nay, beyond that again. If we need guidance, we must reach first principles themselves. Is there not something further, more vital, than this very movement itself ? We are both churchmen.\" \" Of a certainty, your Eminence ; each in his position.\" \" It is not a question of position,\" replied the visitor, again reminding his host, by his manner, of his former request \u2014 \"not of our position, when that of the Church is at issue. What I speak of concerns aU \u2014 binds ah.\" Then Father Doyle knew that his guest was referring to moral obligations \u2014 to that question of right or wrong which underlies all acts. He himself had spoken of distress and uncertainty. But, on this point \u2014 that of violation of the moral law \u2014 even his persecutors had not charged him with * Hard words break no bones."], [320, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 312 hesitation or dulness; their enmity had arisen from opposite considerations. Probably that was his guest's view too, though he might have wished a more thorough and uncompromising front; for, presently he added, \"Si h\u00e6c scimus, beali erimus si faciemus ea.\"* \"But you recognised the embarrassment,\" urged the parish priest. \"That, too, must yield. There is danger; danger to our order \u2014 to that hold over our people which is the hope and condition of our ministration. From without, the Church is impregnable \u2014 Port\u0153 inferi non pr\u0153valebunt adversus earn.'; But from within \u2014 Stat tuta moribus antiquis.\" % The parish priest listened to words which he could not doubt were spoken with deliberation, and possibly with a purpose. But the speaker ceased to pursue his line of argument; Monsignor asked for another cup of tea. After all, Father Doyle had to acknowledge to himself that he had been sufficiently pressing, and that his visitor had fairly indicated his views of the matter. Even now, there was a suggestion that the rules of hospitality should be more closely returned to. Well s0 he it. Certainly, as a Christian, his duty was to his Church, first \u2014 and that Church was now declared to be in danger from those within her own body \u2014 nay, from those within his own order ; nor was it enough to know what belonged to morals \u2014 it should be proclaimed, and the contrary denounced ; not half-heartedly, not partially, not even on the impulse of some more shocking event, as had been his own case, but whoUy, honestly, con sistently from out to out. And for his country, did he not * If we know these things, happy shall we be if we do them. t The gates of hell shall not prevail against her.

Perhaps, in time, such considerations would come to be better under stood, and then all should have their rewards. \"Qua enim seminaverit homo, h\u00e6c et metet\"* \u2014 thus aloud he concluded his thoughts. Father Doyle would be impressive, as he wound up. But his visitor now rewarded him with a smile, only. \" Qui parce seminal, parce et metet,\" f he added. The parish priest looked to his guest for some explanation. Hitherto, if courteous, there had been a gravity in his words. He had hinted of danger to faith and morals, and the levity of a smile would have been unbecoming \u2014 nay, the gravity had been meant for a further hint, too. Had he now changed the subject ; and what was the present theme of his discourse ? \" Numquid colligunt de spinis uvas, aut de tribulis ficusV % continued the visitor, in reply to the look. Then, for the first time, the countenance of the parish priest fell. The explanation was clear enough to him, now; Monsignor alluded to the Ballinteer district, through which portions of his day's journey must have lain. The previous words should be painful to all his order \u2014 they involved a charge against his order. Still, it was a general charge ; but, now, the indictment had come home to himself and his flock. Besides, sins of com mission he had himself denounced, and he could now listen to their condemnation with comparative equanimity. But moral obligations extended to omissions, too. Alas ! the fields of Ballinteer now grew these thistles and these thorns. He had pleaded the embarrassment of his * For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. t He which soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly.

The inactivity of his flock \u2014 the neglect of the lands \u2014 the growth of that which supplied no food, but would so sadly impede future operations, if resumed \u2014 had indeed been in his mind when he had so pleaded. All the same, had his countenance fallen. Did not this neglect suggest a neglect behind that again ? \"There is a truce, at present,\" he said. \"It may lead to peace, and the resumption of industry. Henceforth, no con sideration \u2014 no feelings of embarrassment shall stand between me and my duty.\" \" Yes, it is a duty,\" said Monsignor, \" and a command \u2014 Beati paeifici : quoniam filii del vocabuntur.\" * When his visitor took leave of the parish priest that night, the mind of the latter was fully made up. He would now have the courage of those convictions of which he had already made confession. He would continue to be a peacemaker. He would go to this meeting to which he had been invited \u2014 certainly not as a partisan of the gentry, but as the friend of his people. In all respects he would act independently, doing that which he thought right in itself, and nothing to the contrary, whether it be of commission or omission. He had believed hunting to be beneficial in itself ; he had always declared so when there were no other considerations in the way. If, furthermore, it was proposed to benefit his flock for its concession, then would it be all the more right. Before he retired to rest, he gave orders that his horse should be ready for him early on the morning of the day named. * Blessed are the peacemakers ; for they shall be called the children of God."], [323, "CHAPTER XXX. A COUNTY MEETING. WHEN Father Doyle rode up to Killgobbin House on that following Monday, being the day named for the meeting, there was a fair assemblage of the county gentry. The hunting season had not yet commenced ; it was part of the day's business to discuss whether there should be such a season at all, so that none of the gentlemen had yet donned the accoutrements of the chase. And, though there were plenty of horses, there were no hounds. Further, that tag, rag, and bobtail, which usually accompanied the gentry itself, con sisting of bigger farmers, more comfortable traders, even a shopkeeper or two from town, were entirely conspicuous by their absence. Lastly, there were no ladies \u2014 even the ladies of the house failing to put in an appearance. But, allowing for all this, the meeting did remind Father Doyle of old times. He was the only representative of his class there ; all the rest, excepting some officers from the Curragh, appeared in right of some territorial qualification. The owner of Mount Ogleby was there ; in fact, it had happened to that gentleman to fall in with the worthy priest on his journey thither, for which the latter was thankful. As regards Arthur Ogleby, it was a rare thing to see him without some emblem of the chase about him, be it only a hunting whip, or a pair of top-boots. But, on this particular occasion, he had severely conformed to the"], [324, "316 THE TURN OF THE TIDE implied understanding of their assemblage, namely, that the result of the meeting was not to be anticipated. The young owner of Ballinteer was not there. On the way thither, Arthur Ogleby had said something to the parish priest about the necessary care and guardianship of his dogs ; but, then, he had also said something to the effect that it was \"so best.\" Thus, Father Doyle did not derive much en lightenment. Besides, he had much to bethink himself about concerning his own presence and demeanour there. He had come because he had made up his mind to the general office of peacemaker, and this was the first and earliest occasion which offered. In truth, there was a bit of impulse in it, after all. The oppor tunity might turn up for exercising his new office, but he had to wait and see the shape it would assume, first. In the meantime, he had to bear himself circumspectly. General impressions had to be contended with, while, at the same time, fair allowance had to be made for them. There was not a man among them all \u2014 those territorial magnates, of various degrees of magnitude \u2014 who did not believe in his heart of hearts that his order was at the root of discontent in the land, who could not say, in all sincerity, \"The Irish Priest is the Irish Difficulty.\" No doubt that was part of the round of wrong. His order got this hard name, and had become harder under it. WeU, there was no use asking now, Who began it ? The right thing was to get out of this vicious circle. And, really, it looked as if he was to be met half-way. They were all very civil to him; and the shrewd old man could give that its due consideration. Putting himself and his order out of the question, what man of them was not afflicted with a chronic discontent of his own ? In olden times, Care sat behind the Knight. In these days of ours,"], [325, "A COUNTY MEETING 317 it seems to have transferred its attendance to a landed gentry. So much for the fatal facility of territorial impignoration ! There had been some delay on the lawn in front of Killgobbin House ; gentlemen stopped to shake hands, and to interchange inquiries ; they even quizzed Father Doyle with some affectation of humility, hoping he was not going to put his veto on the movement. Then, they all trooped into the library, where a sufficiency of chairs had been arranged. It was a tight fit, but they all got in, and all got seated. To them now entered Mr. Brabazon himself, bearing a bundle of papers in his hand, indicative of his temporary office of secretary. There was a suggestion that Lord Clogher should be the chairman. That was accepted, with some manifestations of assent. In spite of some heavy impignorations, his lordship was the largest territorial magnate within call, and the distinc tion was his by right. Then, Lord Clogher left his seat, and occupied a chair beside Mr. Brabazon. His lordship opened the meeting briefly, but with some perspicuity and dignity. They all regretted that breaking-up of their County Hunt \u2014 so ran these opening observations of the chairman. He was not going into any recrimination \u2014 he hoped he would hear none there, that day. They were met to consider if it were possible to have a County Hunt, again ; and he would presently call upon their secretary to state what were the prospects they had to face in their efforts to attain this object. Only, he would now occupy their attention with one or two remarks, which he hoped would best come from their chairman at this stage of their proceedings, because they could not be too soon made. In the first place, they should all hasten to thank the Master of the Mount, their esteemed friend, Mr. Arthur Ogleby, for the public spirit which had led"], [326, "318 THE TURN OF THE TIDE him to continue to afford sport to the county under difficulties, and without organised aid. (Here there was quite an ovation, the meeting even indulging in a hunting expression or two.) Those difficulties, resumed the chairman, had lately reached a painful pass, which he, the chairman, might be permitted to \u2014 pass over. (Here there was a decorous \"laugh\" \u2014 a speaker's effort to enliven his audience seldom going without apprecia tion.) WeU, with their approval, he would do so. The only other observation he, the chairman, felt caUed upon to make was to allude to the presence among them of the worthy parish priest, Father Doyle. (At this, the \"hears\" were again resumed, and Father Doyle got very red in the face.) They aU knew his influence, and they were aU aware that, hitherto, it had been exercised on the right side. It was an augury of good that they had him here to-day. The chairman sat down amid mixed murmurs of applause and dissent. The approval of the conciliating spirit of those opening words was much, in the ascendant. But there were those also who thought that the opportunity of a meeting was not to be allowed to let go without some expression of that chronic discontent which inwardly burned. No doubt, it was as the spokesman of this latter class that Mr. Pepper, of Pepperstown, was found to be already on his legs as the chairman sat down. He, Mr. Pepper, had risen to know if there would be an opportunity to reply to these remarks of their chairman at a future stage of the meeting. If not, he might as well say what he had to say, now ? The chairman looked puzzled, and questioned the meeting in dumb show. But the general consensus appeared to be that it would be better to let him, Mr. Pepper, \"have it out, now.\""], [327, "A COUNTY MEETING 319 Then, Mr. Pepper proceeded to deliver himself. Yes \u2014 he, the speaker, would have it out, now. The chair man had just caUed on them to \" pass over \" certain painful incidents. His lordship himself had called them painful \u2014 so they were ; had he, the speaker, been in the chair, he would have called them shameful, disgraceful, barbarous \u2014 well, he didn't know that even barbarians poisoned hounds \u2014 in fact, he begged pardon of the barbarians. Oh ! \u2014 they hadn't been poisoned I Very well \u2014 if gentlemen would only exercise a Uttle more of that patience and forbearance which they were now displaying, they would have that, too. But he, the speaker, wasn't going to split straws with those who wanted peace at any price ; the dogs would be made an end of, yet \u2014 and his friend, Arthur Ogleby, thought so too when he sent them away. What was it ? \u2014 they were under Father Doyle's protection, now I Just so \u2014 he was very much obliged to those gentlemen for remind ing him of the fact. It was quite of a piece with that other fact \u2014 and he, the speaker, could only wonder how much lower they were to come before they got to the bottom of it all. Of course, from a personal point of view, he had the greatest possible respect for Father Doyle. Here, the gentleman so alluded to was observed to be on his legs, with his face turned toward the door. But, also, the speaker himself was found to be off his legs, being, indeed, forced back into his seat by some sturdy and very resolute neighbours. The chairman took advantage of the opportunity, declaring that their secretary would now explain the position and objects of the meeting. Then Mr. Brabazon stood up, holding his papers stdl in his hand. He hardly knew \u2014 so he took advantage of the pause \u2014 whom to credit with the initiative step of the present move ment. Certainly, Colonel Cheviot had spoken to him at a"], [328, "320 THE TURN OF THE TIDE comparatively early period, and, as that gentleman had no permanent tie with their county, their thanks were more especially due to him for the interest which he had taken. Then Lord Clogher, their chairman, had moved in the matter. Nothing practical had come of these conferences \u2014 there was no opening, nor appearance of an opening. He would so far follow the advice of their chairman, and not enter into detail, especially as gentlemen were sufficiently acquainted with the period they had gone through. Rather, he would approach the present period, though that too was encompassed with delicacy, and he must stiU rely on their acquaintance with the subject to which he had referred. Of course, he alluded to those troubles which, taking their rise in a neighbouring estate, were now spreading demoralisation through the county itself. He, the speaker, understood that a proposal would be made on that subject here to-day. (While saying these latter words, Mr. Brabazon had looked toward the Master of the Mount, but that gentleman had pointed on to Father Doyle.) Very well \u2014 I am informed that Father Doyle will take that task upon himseU. He hoped he would be understood when he said that that might be all the better. They were always glad to hear their friend, Mr. Ogleby, but that gentleman was fonder of doing than of speaking. But there were very special reasons for listening to Father Doyle. So far, their progress had been encouraging ; gentlemen had not been back- ward in their efforts to remove the reproach of their county. The way, in a pecuniary sense, is now open ; here is the best proof of that (Mr. Brabazon now held up to public view some of his papers) \u2014 here is a list of subscriptions to a new County Hunt, given, of course, with the understanding that we are to be allowed to hunt the county. Perhaps, Father Doyle can teU us something about that ?"], [329, "A COUNTY MEETING 321 Mr. Brabazon sat down, and the meeting naturally turned in the direction of that portion of the room where the parish priest sat. Whether that gentleman had wholly taken into consideration the responsibilities which he had incurred in his attendance there, was not now the question. There he was, and the solution of the difficulty was sufficiently obvious to himself. He had been forming mental resolutions, and now there was a clear and favourable opportunity for carrying them out. Therefore, whether with impulse, premeditation, or suggestion, or, more probably, a mixture of all, he proceeded to obey the caU. Was it expected of him, Father Doyle, that he should suggest a way out? Well, perhaps there was such a way, if gentlemen would bear with him while he endeavoured to explain the matter as he viewed it. He had been thinking was it possible to kill two birds with one stone? It was a homely saying, hut, then, he was a homely man himself. Their secretary had made aUusion to the troubles on a neigh bouring estate, and he would ask them to believe that these had been very painful to himself. He could have wished that their source had had no connection with his name \u2014 better stUl, that there had been no source at all. But there it was, and it had to be met practicaUy, not theoretically \u2014 least of all with mere recrimination. What was the situation ? Well, he did not see the use of telling gentlemen that which they all knew; besides, was it for him to handle matters of such delicacy, affecting their own order? No; let him, the speaker, confine his explanation to relations between himself and his people. It had pleased gentlemen there that day to make merry with some assumed influence of his, but it was not necessary for him to teU them what that influence really was. In spiritual matters, it was his duty to command, but, in temporal x"], [330, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 322 affairs, he could only advise. They all knew the difficulty of his position; with what offer could he go before his people? If they were to concede, what was to be conceded to them ? Possibly, the meeting would practically apply itself to a con sideration of that question. Father Doyle sat down, leaving no one in ignorance of the drift of his remarks. It was understood he could not put them plainer \u2014 the county gentry would not have the affairs of their own order so handled ; nor was it at all necessary ; the peculiar difficulty of the BaUinteer estate was known to all. The present owner was unable to concede \u2014 and yet hold his ground. Might they enable him to do so ? In the words of the shrewd old man, could they kiU these two birds with the one stone? Could they again have their County Hunt, and also restore peace and harmony to the county itself ? The meeting did not apply itself to such a consideration ; even among their own order, tho matter was too delicate for general discussion. But a small select committee was appointed for that special purpose, including the owner of the Mount and the parish priest of the estate immediately in question. With this task completed, their labours for the day ended."], [331, "CHAPTER XXXI. NEGOTIATIONS. FATHER DOYLE lost no time in approaching the task he had thus engaged in, and which he had, in a measure, himself suggested. In fact, he might have added another to his homely aphorisms \u2014 where there 's a will, there 's a way. Is not this peculiarly apphcable to Irish difficulties, where the inveterate spirit of mischief-making keeps the really interested parties asunder? True, in the case of the Ballinteer estate, there was an intrinsic difficulty\u2014 the inability of the owner to meet the occupiers of the soil halfway. All the same, without this friendly intervention, matters would have gone from bad to worse. Naturally, Father Doyle's share of the task lay with his own people. If such reasonable concession could be made to them, would they then consult their own interest, and not that of the mischief-makers ? Some of our readers may say no such question could arise outside the precincts of a lunatic asylum. Nevertheless, as we write, these very mischief-makers confess their embarrassment under a too-ready obedience of their dupes. Even still more naturally, to Arthur Ogleby fell the work of negotiation with the owner. A few mornings after the meet ing at Killgobbin House, and after there had been a couple of gatherings of the committee, he rode over from the Mount to Ballinteer."], [332, "324 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" I think we see our way clearly, now,\" he said to the young man. \"Who are we \u2014 and where are we going to ?\" \" You did not attend the meeting at Killgobbin.\" \"You advised me not to do so. I think you said the affairs of Ballinteer would turn up in a way that might be embarras- sing.\" \" Something to that effect. You are a good boy, Annesley \u2014 and I will ask you to continue your obedience a little longer. You will be offered the new Mastership of the Hounds. Come, you had some suspicion that such an offer would he made?\" \" You have been doing the work, and asking no pay. Why should the county people seek to change that ? \" \"There are reasons; I don't see why I should not teU them to you. To begin with the least \u2014 my own. When I brought the dogs here, I said I would never bring them hack again. I meant that, Annesley.\" \"On account of this outrage \u2014 or attempt at an outrage?\" The elder man had spoken of his own personal considera tions in the matter as the least ; probably, he also intended that their discussion should be the shortest. But there was now somewhat of indecision in his manner. Should he tell his affairs to this young man ? Certainly, Arthur Ogleby was approaching that period of life when positions become reversed \u2014 when the old begin to look up to the young. But, then, he had not yet passed the boundary for aye ; he still trod on neutral ground. . \" We will speak of that in a moment\u2014 if it is worth speaking of at all. As I am least, let me put myself last. Consider the position of these county people.\" \" You are one of them, yourself.\""], [333, "NEGOTIATIONS 325 \"Yes \u2014 and you are another.

These demands were known to be impossible at the time, and were made on that account.\" \" Either the tenants should go, or I should go.\" \"Just so. Now nobody goes. You have them there, you know.\" The young man humoured the joke. Why should he be ungracious with his friends? \u2014 he had tried that, and was getting ashamed of it. \"Another such victory would be my ruin! Isn't there something like that, too, in the classics ? \" \" WeU, they won't try it again. Certainly, so far your view of the victory is the more correct one ; we have only to look around us to see that. The estate is an absolute wilderness at the present moment. The tenants are depending on alms, not too UberaUy doled out. Suppose they were to go, you would not get anyone to bring the land back into culture again, without sweeping reductions for some years to come.\" Arthur Ogleby had met his young friend a mile or so from the house. At hearing these words Charles Annesley did look around him, and shrugged his shoulders. The picture was certainly not overdrawn, and the elder man's inference was not to be gainsaid. In anticipation of the carrying out of the decrees of the court, all cattle had been removed from the lands ; signs of husbandry there were none. Those thorns and thistles which had already attracted the attention of Monsignor were fast overspreading the scene, aided by whole tracts of nettles."], [335, "NEGOTIATIONS 327 \" Now, confess it was time for us gentry to bestir ourselves for a remedy,\" resumed Arthur Ogleby. \" We had not made the situation.\" \"And there is nothing now left but to accept it.\" The young man could not refrain from some bitterness of ex pression, but the words were not spoken ungratefully. \" Well, there is something better than that, too. There was this organised effort to force the impossible upon you. Now, you are going to be offered the possible. Give your friends credit for that.\" \" You are the chief among them. What do you think I ought to do ? \" \" About this offer \u2014 when it is made to you? \" \" Yes. It 's something of the same nature as the arrange ment we were just speaking of regarding the tenants, if I quite understand it. The mischief-makers were willing to support the tenants in their efforts to starve out the landlords. The gentry are now willing to do the same for me in the interests of their order.\" \" There is the hunting, too. They must offer the mastership to someone, if sport is to be carried on again.\" \" I am not ungrateful ; neither am I oblivious of my position here. I am not asking these questions from either frame of mind.\" \" I am glad to hear it. By a lucky combination of circumstances, both are eliminated from consideration. You are giving as good as you are getting. If you are particular about your independence, I can say that \u2014 as your friend.\" \" That is consoling to those whom it concerns. I hope I am growing out of that sort of thing.\" They had been returning in the direction of the house. The elder man now stopped at these words, and assumed a"], [336, "328 THE TURN OF THE TIDE more impressive air. Hitherto, he had treated even serious matters as lightly as he could. \" You 'U have to get back some of it, again. A Master of the Hounds ought to know his own position.\" \" But I 've been endeavouring to explain to you that I do.\" But Arthur Ogleby was not to be stopped by joke, or evasion. \" If a Master does not respect himself, who will ? I told them there was the making of a Master in you, Annesley. But you '11 have to pay attention to these and other details. You will be made the offer in a becoming manner ; I expressly stipulated for that, myself. But you will have to maintain it after a similar fashion.\" \" While, as yet, you have not told me whether it is to be, at all ! Assuming I am the promising young man you say, I must be Master before I act Master. You said something about yourseU personally, in this matter. Am I to hear that, too?\" Certainly, there had been an implied promise that there would be a recurrence to this portion of their subject. Then the elder man overcame his indecision. \" There was the outrage \u2014 or intention of outrage, certainly ; I would not like it to be repeated, perhaps more successfuUy. But there were other matters to be considered. I continued to show a little sport to my neighbours, because the right and proper Hunt could no longer be carried on. But it gave rise to remarks. Why should I attempt that which men of higher position and better circumstances had declined to do ? Besides, it was only an attempt.\" \" You did wonders with the means at your disposal \u2014 every one said that.\" \" Never mind the wonders,\" replied the elder man, inwardly"], [337, "NEGOTIATIONS 329 gratified, nevertheless \u2014 \"let us come to the means. It was further said I was not just to my family.\" \"Who said that?\" \" Never mind. It was spoken \u2014 and acted upon.\" Then Charles Annesley understood that the owner of the Mount was really making allusion to family matters. He had heard of these matters \u2014 but now held his peace. \" It was acted upon,\" repeated the elder man. He had forbidden discussion of these affairs in his own home \u2014 at least, in his own hearing ; they would have aroused anger and impatience. Now, it even afforded him relief to give some expression to them in the home of another ; and, so far from calling forth such anger or impatience, the words were said cheerfully enough. \" I held resentment long, and \u2014 well, I suppose obstinacy ; but now, also, I have learned to be just. With larger means, it is hard to say what indulgences of vanity I might have had recourse to.\" Charles Annesley could not help looking at the man who thus, almost laughingly, accused himseU. Hitherto, he had associated the owner of the Mount with a plain, and even severe, simplicity. \" Why not ? \" continued the elder man, perhaps perceiving the look, or, it might be, following out his own thoughts. \" When you come to be a leader of sport, yourseU, you wiU know what it is to hear the congratulation of the field.\" \" If that is to be my case, ever ! I hope I won't hear the contrary.\" \" I hope not, too,\" said Arthur Ogleby, recovering some of his gravity. \" We must take care of that. Anyway, the county could not have its County Hunt without you \u2014 Father Doyle made that very clear to us all. You help me, too, to get out of an awkward situation. Don't let us hear anything more"], [338, "330 THE TURN OF THE TIDE about dependence ; it is not becoming to the position you are going to occupy. You are paying for what you are getting ; it is the equivalent for the concessions which you are making, and which we could not allow you to make, with safety to ourselves, if it did not carry this quid pro quo with it.\" Thus it was understood that nothing more should be said until matters had become more advanced."], [339, "CHAPTER XXXII. MR. TOFF GIVES A LEAD. IT was the day of the first meeting of the revived County Hunt, and the morning was weighted with anxiety to more than one individual. Young Charles Annesley was to assume absolute command, as acknowledged and constitutionally appointed Master. To him the events of the coming day naturaUy formed subject for apprehensive consideration. Had he made every proper preparation for success ? \u2014 and was he now to have the additional element of good fortune in his favour ? On the practical answers to these two questions would depend, in his opinion, that position which he was to occupy in the minds of those concerned. The series of circumstances which had finally led up to this first meeting were tedious, and we have taken the liberty to omit them altogether. Briefly, the will had had the way \u2014 the owner and occupiers of the soil had been allowed to arrange their affairs within the limits of the possible, and the mischief makers, frenzied with disappointment, had carried their machinations to other scenes. The owner could hope to derive little or nothing from his property, for some years to come at least. The positive gain was the return of peace and industry, and a better understanding between the other owners and occupiers, including permission to hunt the county without hindrance or molest. Already has it been explained that the"], [340, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 332 necessary basis of all this arrangement was the creation of a salaried Mastership of the Hunt, and the appointment of young Annesley to that post. The field was a large one ; hardly any of the surrounding gentry were absent. The Curragh was well represented ; as already stated, Captain Helmsley had returned to headquarters, leaving Sergeant Macnab to his own resources. Even town sent its contingent, including Mr. Toff among others. There were also several ladies. Some of them came to see the hounds thrown off, but others were prepared to take further part in the day's proceedings. It has been hinted that apprehensive considerations were not restricted to the actual Master of the Meet. Arthur Ogleby was \u2014 or, at least, considered himself to be \u2014 in some sense responsible for what was to follow. As far as preparations went, he bad certainly not spared himseU, or his young friend, the new master; during the previous week, his visits to Ballinteer had been incessant. To give him his due, it was his intention that his interference should be entirely of this preparatory nature. So great was his respect for the office of Master, that he regarded the authority of the holder as absolute and supreme in the hunting-field itself. AU the more was it incumbent upon him to see that he was there under fit and proper arrangement. Thus, he too had to ask himseU whether there had been committed any sins of omission. \"I'm afraid I forgot to tell Annesley about that earth stopping at Ballyhob,\" thus he addressed his wife. It was the evening previous to the Meet, and the owner of the Mount was in the act of winding his watch, preparatory to retiring to rest for the night. \" Mr. Annesley would be sure to think of it himself.\" \" But then I had to give him so many other things to think"], [341, "MR. TOFF GIVES A LEAD 333 of. You recollect, our last fox got to earth there, and we lost a splendid run.\" \" I recollect you spoke to the earth-stopper on the occasion ; Pat Molloy, wasn't it ? \" \"Yes ; it 's the same fellow now.\" \" Well, you drew his attention to the omission, and \u2014 and I don't think it will happen again.\" \" I am not so sure about that. So much depends upon it, you see. Suppose we find in Coolbeg \u2014 as I think we will \u2014 and the fox is any good at all, he is safe to get on to Clogher, if Bally hob is closed against him.\" \"As the consequences are so serious, I feel certain you mentioned the matter to Mr. Annesley. Besides, it 's too late now.\" \"Too late ! Why, I'd rather go and stop the place myself, than have a disappointment like that ! \" \"What, now\u2014 to-night ? \" \" Well \u2014 first thing in the morning.\" \" In the morning I 'U send over to Ballinteer, and we '11 know aU about it. I think you will want all the rest you can get now.\" Arthur Ogleby did have his rest, and, next morning, was informed that this precaution had been attended to. He could think of nothing more, and was able to meet his fellow -sportsmen in the morning with all the outward signs of tranquillity. He would do what in him lay to make the day an enjoyable one, but his exertions in that direction should be unobtrusive, and quite of a subordinate character. He recognised the impossibility of two masters in the field. \"I hope I see you weU to-day, sir.\" It was Mr. Toff who thus addressed the owner of the Mount. \"It's changed times when another gentleman takes the lead here, Mr. Ogleby.\""], [342, "334 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" Yes \u2014 and the devil of it is, Toff, he 's so deucedly particular. You '11 have to mind what you 're about, to-day.\" \" We always had to do that, Mr. Ogleby. You were a trifle inclined that way yourself.\" \"I'll have to obey orders now, like the rest of the field.\" \" WeU, I suppose someone has to be chief, here. Only, we thought as how Mr. Annesley would draw it mdd.\" But the owner of the Mount shook his head. \" I wouldn't trust too much to that, Toff. The new Master has his spurs to win \u2014 and now is his time, you know.\" Thus, Arthur Ogleby gave vent to the feelings which in wardly exercised him ; but the new Master was left to his own arrangements, and his own presence of mind in emergency should occasion arise for it. The company began to assemble rapidly. It was determined not to send the hounds into the shrubbery at Coolbeg while there was a chance of further later arrivals. If there was \" a find \" there \u2014 on which Arthur Ogleby and the new Master were unanimous in their opinion \u2014 and the fox was dislodged from his covert, a long and fast run was anticipated, when those who had not taken part in the start would hardly he expected to \" put in an appearance \" during the rest of the day. While they thus waited, Mr. Toff continued to pay his respects to his friends, young as well as old. He had now found his way to Miss Kate Ogleby, who had come early with her father. \" The governor 's keeping us up to the mark stdl, Miss. Of course, that 's all right.\" \" I thought he was behaving very nicely. He 's only one of ourselves, now, you know.\" \" So he 's been just saying to me. He wanted to frighten me about the new master. But, of course, I knew he was only joking.\""], [343, "MR. TOFF GIVES A LEAD 335 \"I daresay he wants matters to be a success, to-day. It would be such a disappointment, you know, if there was a break-down on the first day of the new hunt.\" \" There 's not much fear of that, Miss. We all know our business by this time.\" \" I 'm sure, Mr. Toff, if we don't, it 's not papa's fault.\" \" And it 's so good of him now to give the new master a fair start. By-the-bye, Miss, did you take particular notice of Mr. Annesley, this morning ? \" \" No ; not more particularly than on any other morning. Is there anything wrong with him ? \" \" Wrong ! Miss \u2014 I should say not ! He 's had a regular new rig-out for the occasion.\" \" Oh ! Is that aU ? \" \"Yes, Miss \u2014 that's all,\" said Mr. Toff, with some dis appointment in his tone. \" I did expect as how he might be noticed. We couldn't do more for him than we have done.\" \"I am sure you will get credit for that, Mr. Toff. I dare say the gentlemen have already anticipated your expectations. I think there is a movement towards the shrubbery, now.\" There certainly was such a movement ; and, presently, the hounds were at work inside. But the process of dislodgment was by no means easy. A fox there was, perhaps more than one ; the action and cry of the hounds was conclusive enough on that point. But the close and far-stretching covert favoured his reluctance to appear in the open. Coolbeg \u2014 to which huntsmen referred rather as a locality where sport might be expected to be found, than as an estate and country seat \u2014 was, in such sense, not so much a shrubbery as a series of shrub beries ; and the quarry continued to play hide-and-seek \u2014 that is to say, break away from one patch of brushwood, only to take shelter in the next \u2014 until long after the excitement of"], [344, "336 THE TURN OF THE TIDE the hounds had communicated itself to the gentlemen of the chase. This was Arthur Ogleby 's most trying period of the day. It was so hard to think that some suggestion, some words of expostulation, some active interference on his part would not alter the aspect of affairs. But he had determined with himself that the new master should be left to his new duties, and he repressed all exhibition of feeling. He even tried to calm others. \" We can't lose him, gentlemen \u2014 the scent is too strong for that; it's only giving our horses a little more breathing time.\" \" I think you brought us over this ground before, Mr. Ogleby?\" It was Captain Helmsley who spoke. The owner of the Mount laughed. \" Yes ; I hope Annesley will have more success. We ran the fox to earth at Ballyhob. That won't happen again.\" \"It doesn't look like it. This kind of thing might go on, you know.\" \"You're right,\" said the elder man, with another attempt at pleasantry \u2014 \" and there 's been enough of it already. Would you mind \u2014 I can't very well under the circumstances, you wiU understand \u2014 would you mind taking a few of the gentlemen with you, and getting into the next clump? That will stop the beggar's game.\" Captain Helmsley quite understood the circumstances and the man. He now executed his task so quietly and un obtrusively that, apparently, \" the beggar \" only had suspicion of the move and its object. Scenting the thus pre-occupied ground, the fox at length broke clearly away, and affording a good view, hounds and horsemen got a fair start. For the succeed ing quarter of an hour or so the pace was trying. In fact, by that time, the fox and the hounds had the whole affair to themselves, the huntsmen being several fields behind. The"], [345, "MR. TOFF GIVES A LEAD 337 covert at Ballyhob consisted entirely of furze ; and, here again, Reynard was able to renew his game of hide-and-seek, until the meeting again brought itself to the front ; though, thanks to precautions \u2014 whoever carried them out \u2014 the run was only suspended, and not brought to an absolute close. Moreover, the delay was but slight, and when the fox again broke covert, all got away at a more equable pace. This was subject for congratulation to the many, for the run now promised to be a long and continuous one, while the features of the country to be traversed offered more than one impedi ment to rapid movement. To be fair to Mr. Toff, whether he was skilled in all the nicer points of the chase, he certainly dashed at his ground, and got over it. To attempt a travesty \u2014 it mightn't be hunting \u2014 but it was splendid. Even those who were ready enough to laugh at the reprimands he sometimes encountered, also showed an equal readiness to avaU themselves of the gap his transit made in a hedgerow. When he came to grief, as on occasion would happen, he got himseU together again with the utmost good humour, and was as willing as ever to give a gentleman a lead over wall or water, ditch or fence. His transgressions were those of indomitable pluck. Immediately beyond Ballyhob lay some level fields, and through these the whole meeting kept fairly together. After these fields followed some heavy lowlands, which none but the better mounted could attempt, the rest endeavouring to skirt round them. Thence stretched some difficult country, interspersed with an ugly dyke or two, and traversed by a stone wall. Annesley now rode in front, a few yards behind his pack, the late Master hanging on to his flank, a silent but watchful observer of the progress of events. Captain Helmsley brought up a good third, though Mr. Toff seemed Y"], [346, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 338 disposed to dispute this position with him. His light weight had successful!)' brought him through the late heavy ground ; but, for the time being, the rest of the meeting was nowhere. \" You 'd better let me give you a lead over this, Captain Helmsley,\" said Mr. Toff, managing to get a nose ahead. The object referred to was the stone waU traversing the country. \" Nonsense, man ! \u2014 the Master and Mr. Ogleby have taken it nicely.\" \"Ay, sir \u2014 but they know it \u2014 so do I, too.\" \" Well, tell me what it is, and I '11 have a try.\" \"You see the wall yourseU, sir \u2014 not much to look at, but on the other side there 's a dyke, not deep, but pretty broadish ; then there 's a roadway \u2014 in fact, the road to the Curragh.\" While Mr. Toff was giving his description he was really increasing his nose to a head, the cool and practised man of the Shires slacking his pace, and rising in his stirrups to comprehend more clearly the intercepting obstacle described to him. The temptation was too much for the little man \u2014 to return to town and relate how he had \" shown the way \" to Captain Helmsley ! He made one of his rushes, and cleared the wall in fairly good style. Captain Helmsley laughed ; the exhibition of vanity did not even ruffle him. The action \u2014 if there were any spectators to see it \u2014 was sufficiently patent to all. Then he proceeded to follow after, in his own style. The wall itself was about five feet high. Man and horse were weU up to that. But it was not sufficient that the man only should know what was beyond it \u2014 thus Mr. Toff's \" rushes \" so often came to grief \u2014 it was but fair to the horse, too, that he should be afforded an inkling. Captain Helmsley"], [347, "MR. TOFF GIVES A LEAD 339 raised his heavy hunter well above the coping. Both saw clearly the depression on the other side ; but they also saw Mr. Toff and his steed at the bottom of that depression, right under them, where they had suddenly collapsed. To proceed was to endanger the life of the prostrate man. But the heavy hunter was not now master of his own move ments. He must go over, or fall back. Captain Helmsley chose the latter course. The horse obeyed the tightened rein \u2014 rose almost perpendicularly \u2014 and then fell back heavily on his rider. Mr. Toff had his usual luck in his escapades. He had already extricated himself from his fall, and was now on Captain Helmsley's side of the waU. It was an ugly, and perhaps, serious accident \u2014 he could see that. \"Annesley, I see Toff waving his hat to us \u2014 there's some thing wrong.\" It was Arthur Ogleby who thus addressed his companion. \" Do you think we ought to go back ? \" \"I do. I know Toff to be a fool \u2014 but he's not doing that for nothing.\" \" I fancy you 're right. Helmsley was with him, and I don't see him now.\" The two men were soon at the scene of the disaster. Captain Helmsley lay insensible. Mr. Toff had succeeded in getting the horse up again. The animal was unhurt, and was now quietly browsing beside his prostrate rider. HaU-a-dozen horsemen were observed wending their way along the upland. The detour had left them half-a-mile behind those in advance. However, they, too, had observed the signals of distress made by Mr. Toff, and now quickened their pace. \" Do you see the Doctor among them, Annesley ? \" asked"], [348, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 340 the owner of the Mount. \" Your eyes are younger than mine.\" \"Dr. Quilter? \u2014 yes, I think so. He rides a tall, chestnut horse, if I mistake not.\" Presently, Dr. Quilter was among them. His examination was rapidly made. \"There's a collar-bone broken, and some scalp wounds. I couldn't say further, at present.\" \" What do you recommend ? Would you venture to bring him on to quarters ? \" \" I would like to make the trial. I must stay with him, and may need assistance. We must have a more exhaustive examination as soon as possible.\" Fortunately, the accident had happened within a few yards of the road, and there was more than one vehicle there now, attracted by the concourse. By this time the injured man had partly recovered consciousness, and the Doctor pronounced him fit for removal. A gap had already been broken through the wall, through which he was safely brought to the roadside. The easiest of the vehicles was selected, and Dr. Quilter departed in charge of his patient. \" Tell us all about it, Toff,\" said the owner of the Mount, in somewhat severe accents. \" You appear to have had a spiU yourself.\" Mr. Toff's soiled garments, and even some slight contusions, were proof enough of this. Still, though nothing more serious was apparent, his usual alacrity was not forthcoming. \" Well, gentlemen, I did suggest to Captain Helmsley to let me show him the way. He 's been accustomed to a different kind of country, you know. I suppose I didn't fairly calculate for the drop on the other side of the wall. At all events, I came to grief there.\""], [349, "MR.

Mr. Ogleby \u2014 you wouldn't have done that, I'm sure. I do hope there 's nothing serious.\" The old Master had told himself he would not interfere with the functions and authority of the new. To be as good as his word had tried him hardly during the day \u2014 perhaps not always even successfully. Now that the work of the day was thus brought to an end, he would not mark its close with an open and public violation of his self-imposed rule. Wherefore, Mr. Toff was left to his own reflections."], [350, ""], [351, "CHAPTER XXXIII. MACNAB EXPLAINS. SISTER MARY was not one to give a promise without intention towards compliance \u2014 nay, without effecting its actual fulfilment, should that be possible to her. With regard to her promise to the roundabout Macnab \u2014 or, rather promises, for there was that which was implied as well as that which was expressed \u2014 all such she brought to entire fulfilment. Time she had certainly demanded, in order to take counsel with her friends, Mrs. Neville and her daughter, whether the sergeant should be at liberty to pay his respects to them. He had suggested to Sister Mary that the requested visit should be put on the head of the service rendered to him in his illness by the younger of these ladies. Not that that had imposed upon the hospital nurse ; she had already recognised the gratitude of the man, and had made intimation of her readiness to put her trust in him. But, at the same time, she had given him to understand that her recognition of these roundabout ways was equally clear to her. To such ways the man himself had frankly owned. He had pleaded \"business\"; and, certainly, the main portion of such business as fell to his share had for its object the elucidation of matters of mysterious character. Then, it might be that mystery produced mystery. So she herself had argued, acknowledging that the man was roundabout, hut also that through such meanderings he did eventually arrive at facts."], [352, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 344 Macnab was, indeed, telling truth ; but his hearer had missed the cypher, so to speak, in which it was expressed. She had heard nothing of that injunction which his employer had laid upon him \u2014 not to expose his present movements more than became absolutely necessary. That was really the matter of \"business,\" with which he was now literally complying. When he should meet with results, he was to communicate their nature to Captain Helmsley, before proceeding further. In this, the young officer himself had not been altogether ingenuous. It had been his intention, when so far assisted by the expert, to take those further proceedings into his own hands. What else could he do ? \u2014 he had reasoned with himself. These ladies had an undoubted right to lead as unobtrusive and retired lives as it was their pleasure or convenience to do. He might, possibly, excuse to them his own personal interference therewith \u2014 and it was his hope to do so. But it was widely different in the case of the man in his employment. Knowing nothing of these latter considerations, Sister Mary had sought confidence by means of confidence. That was the portion of her promises which, at most, was only implied. The sergeant had been particularly desirous for an expression of her opinion on the surname now borne by these ladies. \" Pretty name, isn't it ? \" he had gone on saying, but without receiving that expression in return, though she had given him to understand that his wishes might be complied with when she saw her way more clearly. She now communicated to him the true name. Probably, by this time, the information was not new, or, at all events, unexpected. These fumblings with his string, his packet, some dim and ill-arranged characters of his memory may have done so much for him. Of that, Macnab said nothing; if Sister Mary wished to make show"], [353, "MACNAB EXPLAINS 345 of her trust in him, by all means let her have the satis faction of believing that she was now adding to his stock of information. \" It is so common, nowadays,\" she went on to say, \" to hear of ladies hiding away in holes and corners \u2014 of all kinds of ups and downs, which this new reign of terror has brought about ! Perhaps, Mrs. Hilton thought the persecutions of Mangerton would follow her to town ; perhaps she reckoned on a more speedy settlement of this Mangerton difficulty, and the recovery of her money. Who knows ? Evil men have brought these evil times, and much is doubt and uncertainty. They caU this devil's work 'justice ' and ' patriotism ' ! There ! I won't say any more than I can help ! \" To this, Macnab raised no objection. He was not now greatly interested in the suppositions or conjectures of Sister Mary. A new source of perplexity pressed upon him. He had particularly affected a close and scrupulous adherence to the \" orders \" entrusted to him. In Mrs. Neville and her daughter he had now traced \u2014 whether independently or by the Sister's aid \u2014 the Mrs. Hilton and the Florence of his quest, and his next step should be to acquaint his employer with that fact. The military rank of that employer much enhanced the necessity of strict obedience, in his eyes. For years he had himself belonged to a semi military body \u2014 wholly military as regarded drill, discipline, and subordination of rank. It was a natural desire \u2014 nay, a positive pleasure in him now to make exhibition of those qualities. But, for the time being, that was impossible ! It may be recalled to mind that Captain Helmsley obtained the invaluable services of the ex-sergeant through the aid of his friend, Charles Annesley. The new Master of the Hunt had deemed it his duty to inform that person of the accident"], [354, "346 THE TURN OF THE TIDE which befeU his employer, even enjoining caution and circum spection from himseU. With this weighty news, and renewed injunction, he had come to meet the hospital nurse. What was now to be his attitude toward those ladies \u2014 nay, what was to be his attitude toward Sister Mary herseU? He had come to meet Sister Mary, toward the fulfilment of that portion of her promise which had been expressed ; in fact, they were now actuaUy on their way to the residence of those ladies. He had asked to see the younger of them, and to see \u2014 only. But now, one way or another, he could trust his mental vision so far as a tolerable certainty that he would see \u2014 what he would see. After that, explanations of some sort must follow. He was very much inclined to take a leaf from Sister Mary's book, seeking confidence by means of confidence. Such was not \"in his orders,\" to be sure \u2014 nay, they implied the contrary ; stiU, a nice adaptation to circumstances was the very keynote of the profession he was following. It would almost appear as U Sister Mary read his reflections. She would very much like his confidence \u2014 was by no means easy in her mind, though actually on her way to fulfil her promise, without it. But how to turn this roundabout man into more straightforward paths ! The squaring of the circle can only be obtained by approximation. W^ell, perhaps she could approximate, too. \"What's on your mind, Macnab? There's something, isn't there?\" \" There is that, Mrs. Morris. I 'm thinking two heads are better than one.\" \"You didn't think so when you made this request to me. Is there anything new, since ? \" \" Partly new, partly old. Perhaps, I 'd better explain both.\""], [355, "MACNAB EXPLAINS 347 \"Do you think you could manage that? You know, it's so long out of your line,\" she said, laughing. \"I can try, anyways,\" said the sergeant, unruffled by the joke \u2014 in fact, he laughed, too. \"I have been some time on this job, down in the country. I came up only the night I saw you in the hospital. I suppose I 'm on the right track now; stiU, there is no harm in being quite certain.\" While speaking, the man had been again at his packet; he had untied the string, and he now handed the portraits to Sister Mary. \"I knew I had seen the young lady\u2014 somewhere. Would you believe it, I couldn't tell where ? \" \" Why, it 's Miss HUton ! She 's only a young girl, here ; no matter, I 'd know her anywhere.\" \" Like enough ; you 've seen her since, and you 've had the use of your senses all the time. I didn't know you \u2014 not tiU afterwards ; would you believe that 1 \" \"Ah, yes; yours was a bad case. We didn't think we'd pull you through \u2014 more devil's work !

Where was I ? \" \"You said you got this job \u2014 only call it something else; I don't like it. Say someone employed you.\" \"That wiU do as well \u2014 perhaps better. In fact, I was employed by a young English gentlemen \u2014 quite a swell, if you don't object to that \u2014 has property there, or will have it, but chooses to play at soldiering for a while before he settles down. Between you and me, Mrs. Morris, there 's a bit of romance in the whole matter.\" Sister Mary redoubled her attention, though with a strong effort toward concealment of the fact. Macnab was going on so nicely \u2014 the circle gave such actual promise of becoming"], [356, "348 THE TURN OF THE TIDE an ultimate square \u2014 that it was a pity to mar the performance by too great a display of interest. Men are so strange ! \" You can judge for yourself,\" proceeded the uninterrupted Macnab. \" These ladies we 're now going to see are relatives \u2014 quite distant ones, I believe. He had known the young lady in England ; then there had been a kind of quarrel \u2014 between the families, you know, not between the young people.

I doubt not she 's told you some of this \u2014 just some more of the devU's work, as you caU it \u2014 and it was too much for her.\" Sister Mary had indeed heard the story \u2014 the whole story, up to this ; but as there was more to be heard, and as Macnab was proceeding so well in his own way \u2014 why, she just let him have that way. \" Mrs. Hilton was driven to confuse friends with foes,\" was her only comment. \" What you have said is some explanation of that. You will now find her sensible enough.\" \" So better ; we will want her to be all that. Now I come to what you couldn't know. This young gentleman, Captain Helmsley, is told by his mother to look Mrs. Hilton and her daughter up. He tried to \u2014 but that 's a business in itseU, which has to be learned. Still, I tell you \u2014 he tried to.\" It was quite evident that the expert was now labouring with some idea which refused to conform to ready expression, this being sufficiently indicated by his repetition, as a poor and, in fact, inadequate substitute for such expression. Should she, at length, come to his help, or would he ex tricate himself from the entanglement ? It appeared as if he would. \" You can give me your own opinion about it, Mrs. Morris."], [357, "MACNAB EXPLAINS 349 Of course, I'm only an humble man. When he puts me on to this here \u2014 well, inquiry \u2014 that is, when he couldn't work it himself, of course he 's quite polite, and all that kind of thing \u2014 but he 's peremptory, too, in his way. I 'm to be very careful, and I 'm to report as I go along ; and, above all, when I 'm really on the track, I 'm to let him know right off. Why, it 's as much as to say, ' Macnab, get over the rough ground, and put me on to the pleasanter part of it.' That's the way /read it.\" Sister Mary saw no reason to doubt the correctness of the man's rendering of the situation. The portrait she held in her hand was that of a pretty and interesting girl, with every promise of further development ; and, personally, she herself knew that this promise had been now fulfilled. In her own mind, she rather agreed with Macnab's interpretation \u2014 not censuring Captain Helmsley, either. Apparently, the expert went this far, too, for he resumed : \"Oh! I'm not blaming him, Mrs. Morris. He's a good and dutiful young man, and did what his mother told him. Only, it's one word for his mother, and two for himself.\" \" But he hasn't had a word at all yet,\" interposed Sister Mary, who could not refrain from a laugh at the man's way of putting it. \"Ah! \u2014 there's the rub; and, perhaps, you won't laugh, Mrs. Morris, when I tell you more. I don't know whether the poor young gentleman is going to have any words at aU. He went back to his quarters, you'll understand, while the inquiry was going on \u2014 leastways, until it was got ready for him, and feeling restless, perhaps, he filled up his time with hunting. You don't read the papers, Mrs. Morris ? \" \"My time is filled up already \u2014 you ought to know that.\""], [358, "350 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \"Well, I can give you the latest news without them.\" Macnab was now actively searching himself for another packet, and soon produced the letter of the young owner of Ballinteer to himseU. Another man would have communicated the substance of it, but such was not the expert's training. He had stipulated not to be roundabout for the nonce, and had been as good as his word. But from the strictly legal rules of evidence he could not so divorce himself. Wherefore he \" handed in \" the proof in question. Sister Mary hurriedly read the lines conveying intelhgence of Captain Helmsley's hunting incident. \" Oh ! Macnab. I hope it 's nothing very serious ? \" \" I hope not, too \u2014 for the gentleman's sake ; for everybody's sake \u2014 including myself. You've read Mr. Annesley's last lines?\" Sister Mary recurred to the letter again. In her first reading of it the recorded accident had chiefly engrossed her attention. \"You'll observe,\" further commented the expert, not perhaps quite within legal rule, but possibly he may have met instances in courts of justice \u2014 \" you 'U observe more care fulness, more circumspection \" \" Mr. Annesley only suggests \u2014 quite correctly, too, I think,\" said Sister Mary. \"Oh, certainly \u2014 Captain Helmsley was quite poUte \u2014 I think I told you so; so is Mr. Annesley, in his way. Only, they both mean what they say. Now, we are on our way to these ladies\u2014 we'U see them, I suppose, in a few minutes more \" \"That is true,\" said Sister Mary, for whom the coming interview was now beginning to have its considerations \u2014 nay, it might he embarrassments."], [359, "MACNAB EXPLAINS 351 \" What 's to he done, then ? When these ladies were found, I was to report. Well, they are found \u2014 and I can't report.\" \"I think we'll have to teU Mrs. Hilton about Captain Helmsley \u2014 and the accident,\" said Sister Mary, going right to the drift of the unfinished argument. \"Very weU. Mind, I'm not saying you're wrong, Mrs. Morris ; only it 's not in the orders, and \u2014 and we both hope this young gentleman will come through with his accident.\" \" Certainly,\" said Sister Mary, presuming she was still foUowing out the argument. \" Captain Helmsley will under stand the difficulty you were placed in.\" \"But Mrs. Hilton! \u2014 what about her, in the meantime? Here is a lady who doesn't want to he followed. Well, I go and tell her I have been following her \u2014 that there 's others behind me who are preparing to come on, only they can't quite at present. Isn't it just giving her time and opportunity to leave every one in the lurch again? Suppose that happens \u2014 and suppose Captain Helmsley does get over his accident ? What will he say then ? Something to this effect, I guess \u2014 ' WeU, Macnab, a nice kettle of fish you made of the business I gave you ! ' \" \"He can't blame you for accidents, and their consequences.\" \" Oh, certainly not ! Young gentlemen in love are always so very considerate ! \" Sister Mary could not refrain from another laugh, though she protested against the pleasantry which called it forth. \" We all hope it wiU be nothing serious with Captain Helmsley \u2014 still, it is an accident. I cannot help thinking that Mrs. Hilton must be told everything. Besides, here we are now, at the very door ; and there is no time for another course, even if you got me to follow it.\" There was no getting over this fact\u2014 besides, the expert had"], [360, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 352 no other course just at hand, having, indeed, already as much as assented to the opinion of Sister Mary on the point. Wherefore he held his peace, though with every appearance of doubt and reluctance."], [361, "CHAPTER XXXIV. YOU HERE! SISTER MARY knocked, at the same time saying to her companion, \" You had better let me tell Mrs. Hilton, myself \u2014 and by myself. It may give me an opportunity to talk her over, if \u2014 if your anticipations have foundation.\" To this, also, the expert yielded a silent assent, though with more appearance of approval. In a few minutes more they found themselves in the presence of Mrs. Hilton. She had been already prepared for the visit by Sister Mary. That is to say, the latter lady, adhering to her engagement to Macnab as it then existed, had informed Mrs. Hilton of the man's desire to express personally his thanks and gratitude for the service rendered him in his illness : an interval had elapsed, certainly ; but then Mrs. Hilton would know that she herself had been the cause why this debt had not been sooner paid. That is what Mrs. Hilton and Florence would now understand by the visit. The further explanation was to be made by Sister Mary, as she received, or devised, opportunity for so doing. Such was the changed, or added, programme as briefly inti mated by her to Macnab in the few words she had spoken in front of the house, and accepted by him in silence. But the man had taken in the situation with accuracy, and was now prepared to regulate his words and deportment in con formity therewith. And, truth to say, for his position he was no mean hand at z"], [362, "354 THE TURN OF THE TIDE such regulation of manner. Perhaps the secret, or part of it, was that he did know his position. Captain Helmsley had observed this in him \u2014 and the instincts of the young English officer were keen enough on the point. Mrs. Hilton now recognised it, and was all the more pleased, perhaps, that gratitude should present itself in a form otherwise so com mendable. The man's occupation had supplied him with a fund of town and country news, which he brought forward with skUl and judgment, as the exigencies of conversation suggested ; and, notwithstanding that professional reticence of his, he could talk in the way of business, too. Thus, his audience admired, and, no doubt, would have done more so had they known that, all the time, he was waiting for that signal from Sister Mary which was to apprise Mrs. Hilton that she had something for her private ear. The signal itself was undetectable, even to Macnab himself ; but he knew that it had passed, and that he was to be left to his own reflections for awhile. When the ladies again returned it was plain that Mrs. Hilton had been moved, though she now put control on her feelings. There were traces of tears with her still, and the expert detected her daughter furtively wiping away some tell-tales from herself. NaturaUy, however, the man thought of his own position in the matter \u2014 it may be, too, of such duties as still remained to him. Under this general appearance of softness, if not actual forgiveness, was there still resentment? If so, it should be very deep, for even the expert could not detect it by word or tone. \" I have not blamed Mrs. Helmsley,\" said Mrs. Hilton. \" I took my husband's part, actively \u2014 Mrs. Helmsley was silent where she could not approve. As for her son, it is not fair to mix him with the past at ah.\""], [363, "YOU HERE! 355 \"And he has been endeavouring to help us, now,\" interposed Florence. \" Sister Mary has just told us that, you know.\" \"Yes, Florence \u2014 I heard Mrs. Morris say so, and, though I made no reply \u2014 all this has been so unexpected \u2014 I am not ungrateful. Captain Helmsley undertook this matter himself, I think?\" The question was addressed to Macnab. That intelligent officer was still waiting to gauge the general purport of Sister Mary's explanation, and its effect upon her hearers. Thus directly interrogated, he commenced some preparation \u2014 possibly, preliminary to the production of his packet, again \u2014 but, warned by something in the eye of Mrs. Morris, he desisted, and resorted to words instead. \"I knew Captain Helmsley to be actively and zealously engaged in the task his mother had assigned him, until \u2014 until his military duties temporarily intervened; even then, he left orders.\" \"Just so,\" said Sister Mary. \"I have explained all that to Mrs. Hilton. In fact, but for this accident, Captain Helmsley would by this time have resumed the task entrusted to him.\" \" I regret Captain Helmsley's accident, on every account,\" said Mrs. Hilton. \"Our friends have not been so many that we can lose any.\" \" It won't come to that, Mrs. HUton,\" again interposed Sister Mary. \" It will all have a better ending. Captain Helmsley is going on well \u2014 and the doctors report favourably of him. You can show Mr. Annesley's letter to Mrs. Hilton; I think you were going to show \u2014 something.\" Thus unmistakably instructed, Macnab lost no time in producing the communication in question. However, this time he took it upon himself to read out that portion of it referring to the accident and the patient's condition."], [364, "356 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" I wish I could be of help,\" said Mrs. Hilton. \" I suppose the doctors can be depended upon ? \" \" There is a staff of them, at any rate,\" was Sister Mary's reply. \"You know, it is a headquarters.\" \" Nurses for me ? \" said Macnab. \" Let us praise the bridge that carries us over.\" \" I don't know about nurses, down there,\" said Sister Mary, \"I suppose, if they're wanted, they'U be sent for.\" \" Alas ! \" said Mrs. Hilton, \" I am neither doctor nor nurse.\" And as she spoke, she looked toward Sister Mary. Sister Mary repeated her words \u2014 \" If nurses are wanted, they will be sent for. Who knows but an order might come ? \u2014 and then I would run down, myself.\" \"That would be best of aU,\" said Mrs. Hilton. \"Then we would really know how matters were going on.\" Here the sergeant rose to depart, pleading an engagement. \" You won't take it amiss if I give an occasional call, Mrs. Hilton ? I may hear something ; you know, I am pretty much in the way of it.\" Mrs. HUton accorded a gracious permission, and the sergeant went his way. Some half-hour after, Sister Mary issued from the house to wend her own way homeward. But she had not proceeded far when the ubiquitous Macnab made his reappearance. \"You here? You told us you had some engagement ! \" \"I have engagements; one of them you know, yourself.\" \" Nonsense ! Mrs. Hilton is quite reconciled. If that is all that troubles you, you may go home and have your rest. I daresay you want it,\" said Sister Mary, not unkindly. \" Well, it looks like it,\" said the sergeant. \" Still \" \" Still, what ? You don't believe looks ? \u2014 or people, either ? Is that it?\""], [365, "YOU HERE! 357 \" I '11 believe whatever you say, Mrs. Morris. What happened ? \" \" After you left ? Well, I think Mrs. Hilton would like me to go down and see after her relative. Come, now, isn't that a proof of reconcilement? Not that I think you believe anything \u2014 or anybody.\" \" I told you I believe you, and whatever you say. You will go?\" \" Somebody may have gone before me. There may be an order in, already \u2014 and here you stand, delaying me ! \" Sister Mary's manner was still kindly ; nay, she laughed as she now said these words, though she also made as U she would continue her homeward course. She had already laughed at the man's roundabout ways. His unallayed suspicions \u2014 arising, doubtless, from similar professional distrust \u2014 now moved her in like manner. But though thus incurring ridicule, it was also the man's weak point. At all events, he now abandoned further argu ment, or irresolution, if such had previously held possession of him, and, instead, accompanied Mrs. Morris to the door of the hospital. Here he stood a moment, while Sister Mary went in, and immediately returned again. \"Yes \u2014 I wiU go down in the morning; I suppose you will he satisfied, then. You will teU Mrs. Hilton, if you like \u2014 I may not have time. What are the trains ? \" \"There's one at 12.30 from Kingsbridge.\" \" That will do very nicely ; it will give me time to get ready in the morning. I must have some rest, now.\" Then Mrs. Morris went in again; and Macnab, left alone, soon disappeared into the darkness of the night. On the foUowing morning, some minutes before the time named by the expert on the previous evening, Sister Mary"], [366, "358 THE TURN OF THE TIDE drove up to the Kingsbridge Station in a cab. Clearly she was intent on the short journey, also named in the course of that previous conversation, for her ordinary travelling box was on the top of the cab. Her surprise was great on observing Florence there also, and similarly equipped with a box. She was about to give audible expression to this emotion, but, on a moment's reflection, said to herself, instead, \" Oh, that Macnab ! \" Whether these words expressed admiration of that person, or a contrary mental disposition, was hardly discernible from her succeeding acts and manner. Not but the weight of evidence would lead to the first supposition ; for, as it is universally conceded that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so Sister Mary did indeed, on that occasion, adopt some of the roundabout and tentative efforts of that intelligent officer. \" It was so kind of the poor sergeant,\" said Florence, when Sister Mary's box had been placed on the platform near her own, and Sister Mary herself had taken her seat beside the young girl, awaiting the train which was not yet ready. \" What was so kind of him, dear ? \" \" Why, he sent the cab for me himself, this morning. That was the reason I was a httle early, here. Mamma said I ought not to keep the cabman waiting, as we had not engaged him ourselves.\" \" And the cabman knew the hour \u2014 and the station ? \" \" Certainly, Mrs. Morris \u2014 so did we, too ; the sergeant told us aU about that, last night.\" \" Oh ! \u2014 I didn't hear that, you know.

Mamma under stood it so \u2014 that is, we understood the sergeant to say so. I believe he sent the cab from himself.\" \" Of course, I wish it. You will be such a help and com panion to me ; not that I would have you take any part in this nursing. You can help me in many other ways ; I will explain all that as we go along. Yes, Macnab certainly sent the cab from himself. He is very kind \u2014 though apt to be distrustful, you know \u2014 I suppose it 's his occupation makes him that. Perhaps, he thinks your mother is not yet reconciled \u2014 may give this poor young gentleman another quest after her when he is quite recovered, as he will be.\" \" She can't do that while I 'm away\u2014 she would never leave me to look for her.\" And the young girl even laughed at the idea."], [368, "360 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" No, dear \u2014 she would never do that. Of course, I 'm only supposing some such ridiculous nonsense to get into the man's head. I do think everything is on the right road toward recon cilement, now \u2014 and, who knows ! perhaps this journey may put it past doubt ! \" They had already taken their seats in the train, which, in a few minutes more, steamed out of the station. During these minutes there had been no conversation ; there was some noise, some confusion, and that general settling-down which even a short journey, as this one was to Sister Mary and her com panion, though not to the bulk of their feUow-passengers, appears to necessitate. But Sister Mary had spoken of some further explanation as they went along, and she now dropped a few words, with such quietness as the nature of the words themselves, and their own surroundings, were suggestive of. \" I don't at all agree with Macnab \u2014 neither do you. At the same time, I would have liked to have seen your mother again, if that were possible ; weU, it 's not now, at any rate ; I dare say I will write to her. Beyond doubt, she is reconciled \u2014 or, at least, very far gone toward it ; only our goosey won't see it \u2014 can't see it, I suppose. Well, dear, as I was saying \u2014 or going to say \u2014 your mother may be all that, and yet not be quite pre pared to show it, by an actual advance from her side.

I wiU take all responsibility \u2014 you must leave this arrangement to me, and I will settle everything with your mother, and \u2014 and with goosey, when next we meet.\" Then, Sister Mary kissed her young friend, and said every thing was quite clear now. Florence supposed it was. It might be the low voice, it might be the noise of the train \u2014 but what matter? Mrs. Morris was a good, kind, and perfectly safe companion."], [369, "CHAPTER XXXV. IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND. THE accident to Captain Helmsley had been unfavourable to the success of the first day's meeting of the revived County Hunt. For that, however, the new Master was not answerable. All proper precautions had been taken to insure the day's sport, without unnecessary or wanton risk ; and, for the rest, the casualties of the hunting-field must be taken as they come. So said all those friends of Charles Annesley who had come off with whole bones, as they complimented him on his management of the powers entrusted to him. This \" mimicry of war \" cannot be conducted without some of war's results, on occasion ; and, on this particular occasion, the matter might have been worse. Dr. Quilter reported that his friend and patient would require rest and care, and skilful treatment ; such an importance was due to the case in the interests and dignity of the profession to which he belonged ; but, these being secured, he took upon himself to say that the young man would be seen in the hunting-field again. Arthur Ogleby had put no common restraint upon himself when he had refrained from laying his full views of that event before Mr. Toff. To those to whom befell accidents through their own awkwardness, stupidity, or even rashness, he accorded slight sympathy ; a mistake in the hunting-field assumed with him all the proportions and character of a deliberate offence."], [370, "362 THE TURN OF THE TIDE But it was far otherwise in the case of the youthful Captain Helmsley. Here was a sportsman possessed of experience, judgment, and discretion in excess of his years. It was reaUy awful to contemplate the sacrifice of such a member of society to the vain impulse of a rash, intruding fool. But he had promised to himself to abide by all trial aud provocation. When in authority himseU, he had used the tight rein and the whip-hand. Now that he had laid down his authority, he was equaUy prepared to make exhibition of the virtue of subordina tion. Thus, he had left Mr. Toff to the new Master, and his own reflections. Possibly, he may have been strengthened in his resolution by the reflection that the like could not happen again, at least for some considerable time. This first meet of the new Hunt was really held toward the end of the season itself. There was just time to submit the new and friendly arrangement to actual practice, and to exhibit proof of the good intention of the farming classes, before the close period set in, when no such demonstration could be possible. And it had been deemed advisable that the opportunity should be taken advantage of. Already husbandry was in progress, and the gentry were equaUy unanimous that the rights of others should be respected. Thus, it was trusted, at the commencement of the next season the County Hunt would resume operations as a matter of course. However, just now, there was not much leisure permitted to the master of the Mount. Mr. Darley had drawn up that case for counsel's opinion. In fact, for some time the case had been in counsel's hands, and the fee in counsel's pocket ; but there, with one excuse or another, the matter had remained. Certainly, Dr. Gloss was at the head of his branch of the profession, doing quite an inordinate share of its business."], [371, "IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND 363 There was hardly a time when Dr. Gloss had not very much larger fish to fry, and it seemed only reasonable, unless to those whom it concerned, that the smaller run should wait. Then, suddenly, \"the case\" was sent back to Mr. Darley with counsel's opinion attached thereto. Mr. Darley himself acted with much more promptitude, and, that very evening, notes were sent out to all the members of the Ogleby family, requesting their presence at his office to hear and to discuss the views and recommendations contained in the singularly iUegible lines which the great legal luminary had penned. \"Bother the man!\" said Mrs. Potter \u2014 \"the man\" meant Mr. Darley ; \" couldn't he tell us what counsel has said?\" \"Men of Mr. Darley's calling proceed by precedent,\" said her husband. \" Even these notices \" \u2014 he was now holding in his hand that special one addressed to his wife \u2014 \" even these notices, I fancy, are written in that way. Nay, it must be so \u2014 merely to interpret the meanings of a Doctor Gloss involves an amount of responsibility which is presumptuous, if not dangerous.\" \"Papa has been very good of late,\" continued Mrs. Potter, without much apparent heed of her husband's remarks. \" He gave up the hounds ; you know they were grandpapa's greatest source of irritation. I suppose there would be nothing of all this weary will-work, only for them.\" \" It is never too late to mend, Fanny,\" replied Mr. Potter, abandoning all attempt at original thought. \" It would be equally presumptuous to offer pre-judgment on the primary sources of contention ; we have to hear Dr. Gloss, and bow. But it is sometimes too early to expect amendment.\" \"Yes, dear,\" said the intelligent Mrs. Potter. \"I suppose you are right. Mr. Darley says the money is intact.\""], [372, "364 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" And Dr. Gloss had not to write his opinion merely on an abstract subject.\" \" I daresay he would take quite as much interest if he had \u2014 perhaps even more.\" \"Possibly, my dear \u2014 but would other people?\" Then Mrs. Potter made her preparations for going out, with her note in her hand. It was understood that she was to go over to the Mount, there to make arrangements for the general family assemblage at the office of Mr. Darley, in town. Later in the day, when her husband had completed his morning's parochial work, he was to call for her, and they would return to Ballyfair together. \" Of course, you had your note from Mr. Darley, this morning?\" It was her sister, Sophia, who thus accosted her, as she made her appearance at the family habitation. \"Yes. Will papa go?\" \" We don't know yet. He has shown us his note, and has said nothing.\" \" That looks well, at least,\" said Mrs. Potter. \" So we all think. Mamma is waiting to see you ; perhaps she may have something more to tell you.\" \" Perhaps so. Dr. Quilter has been here ?\" \"Yes. How do you know?\" \" I couldn't say, Sophy \u2014 perhaps I guessed it.\" \" Yes,\" repeated Miss Ogleby, passing over her sister's reply, \" of course he knew we would be anxious to hear about Captain Helmsley.\" \" Dr. Quilter has been here before there was any particular anxiety to know about Captain Helmsley. And he has hardly been here since the accident.\" \"Yes,\" again repeated her sister. \"Dr. Quilter did not like"], [373, "IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND 365 to be away from duty for any length of time. Now, a nurse, or nurses, have come down from town, and he finds himself more at liberty.\" \"What does he say of his patient?\" \" Not very much. The case seems to puzzle him.\" \" You said he thought we would like to hear how Captain Helmsley was going on, and now you say he has nothing to tell ! Somebody appears to be puzzled, Sophy?\" \"I told you who the somebody was, Fanny, dear \u2014 Dr. Quilter himself.\" \"But Captain Helmsley was getting on fairly \u2014 I under stood Dr. Quilter to say that when he was here last?\" \" So he did. Now he appears to have something on his mind.\" \"Dr. Quilter has something on his mind?\" \" Yes.\" \"Well, Sophy, you know we all thought Dr. Quilter to have some attraction here. Gentlemen in \u2014 in that condition are liable to \u2014 to convey that impression to their friends.\" \"Nonsense, Fanny!\" was the reply of her sister. \"Of course, I know you all have got some absurd idea of \u2014 of that sort into your heads. Dr. Quilter is really alarmed about Captain Helmsley.\" \"Oh !\" said Mrs. Potter. \"I am really sorry I should have appeared to treat the matter lightly. But you said Dr. Quilter hardly spoke on the subject now?\" \"Well, Fanny,\" replied Miss Ogleby, \"if you must know, he told me.\" Mrs. Potter repeated her \"Oh!\" but appeared not able, at present, to get any further. Perhaps the pause was an awkward one to her sister, for she hastened to add\u2014 \" Yes ; he does not like the way the case is going on at all."], [374, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 366 I think you had better see mamma now ; if she has anything to tell, she will certainly tell you.\" But Mrs. Ogleby had no more fuU information to give on the subject of the contemplated meeting. She, too, would have wished that Mr. Darley had written in a more communi cative form. It would be so much more desirable that all, especially her husband, should have some idea of what was to be heard. \"I hardly know what I really wish, there are so many things to be considered from various points; but I hope nothing will occur to hurt your father \u2014 more than there has been already.\" \" You think he wiU come, mamma ? \" inquired Mrs. Potter. \" Not with us. But I think he may turn up there.\" This, being as much as could be expected, at any time, of the Master of the Mount, was adjudged to be satisfactory by all present. \" He can be told nothing more hurtful now,\" suggested Mrs. Potter. \"No; except that matters become more so on repetition.\" After that, there was a comparison of the various notes issuing from Mr. Darley's office, and conveying the important intelligence that Dr. Gloss had at length \" written on the case.\" Perhaps, the variation of a phrase, or even word, in them \u2014 a new departure in the handwriting \u2014 the degree of conventional cordiality of commencement or ending \u2014 there was no legal stereotype for them, surely ! \u2014 might carry its own meaning. But, no \u2014 further enlightenment was not to be so had. They were all equally informed that the great Dr. Gloss had reduced to words his vast learning and experience on the subject, and that Mr. Darley was prepared to expound"], [375, "IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND 367 those words to them at such time as was found suitable to their united assemblage. \"Had we not better settle on the day, now?\" said Mrs, Potter. \"But your father is not here. And, Fanny, your husband has a voice in the matter as much as yourself; perhaps more so \u2014 legally, you know.\" It was Mrs. Ogleby who thus spoke. The near approach of a final and absolute adjustment of the family dispute renewed her alarm. \" My husband will he here presently,\" said Mrs. Potter \u2014 \"but I hardly think he will bring his voice with him \u2014 that is to say his legal voice, you know, mamma. He thinks we ought to decide among ourselves.\" \" That is, if there is any decision left to us ; I understand that to be the chief point, Fanny \u2014 or one of them, at any rate.\" \" Just so ; I presume Dr. Gloss has understood that, too, and has directed his mighty intellect accordingly.\" \"But, then, counsel's opinion is only \u2014 an opinion. Anyone who doesn't like it may go and get another opinion.\" It was the youngest Miss Ogleby who now spoke. \"That is quite true also, Kate. Of course, that is the way lawsuits begin.\" \" But Mr. Darley is always preaching against lawsuits. He is quite afraid of them. It seems odd that a lawyer should be afraid of law. I suppose he 's honest, and sees the misery and ruin it has caused.\" \" I think we ought to make up our minds, before we go, that there is to be no lawsuit.\" \"That, after Dr. Gloss, no one is to be allowed to speak? It seems very nice to say so. But you will get married, some"], [376, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 368 time or another. So will Sophy, too ; and then your husbands wiU set everything wrong again. Mr. Darley explained all this to me and Patrick, ever so long ago.\" \"But Patrick, you say, won't upset anything you do. Why can't other people manage their husbands as easily as you do ?\" \"Wait \u2014 and try. You won't find it so easy as you think.\" \" Well, then \u2014 burn the will ! I don't see any other way out of it.\" \" You had better make your proposition to Mr. Darley, himself. I did \u2014 and you should have seen him ! Even Patrick was shocked.\" So talked the three sisters among themselves. Mrs. Ogleby half listened, half thought of her own peculiar position in the matter. As she had said herself, she hardly knew what she really desired. As a wife, she would have preferred to have brought her husband this money. But, then, even that had its unpleasant reflection. Had this happened some years ago, where would the money now be ? Her husband's resentment was pardonable \u2014 so it appeared to her; still, was it not also her duty as a daughter to respect old Mr. Warburton's motives ? His wish had been to tie this money up \u2014 to tie it up for ever from the reach of Arthur Ogleby. He did not believe in an amendment \u2014 an amendment which had come with years, and reflection, and some painful experience. He had willed that these bonds should be tight, and strong, and insoluble ; and she, his daughter, had no doubt that the law could have so assisted him to forge his fetters had he properly availed himself of its services. But he had preferred to work in secret, perhaps choosing to keep to himself his hard resolve. Thus, it might well be, as was now asserted, that he had been constructing only ropes of sand, all the time. \" Had we not better wait to hear what Mr. Darley has got"], [377, "IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND 369 to say, before we make propositions to him?\" she now ventured to interpose. \"We will always regard you, mamma, as the only person entitled to grandpapa's money,\" said the youngest of her daughters, who, as the latest author of a proposition, probably thought her mother's words addressed to herself. \" That means your father, my dear \u2014 I cannot claim anything in my own right, now. WiU or no will, my money is now your father's money. Perhaps, we ought not to go even into resolutions, until we are told where we really are.\" 2 A"], [378, ""], [379, "CHAPTER XXXVI. HARRY! THE reader wUl have read, in the preceding chapter, how the progress of Dr. QuUter's patient had become the subject of some uneasiness to so skilled a practioner. To Miss Ogleby herself he had confessed even more than this. Whatever was the actual amount of confidence which had passed between the learned gentleman and the learned lady, Miss Ogleby had truly stated that the gentleman himself was \"puzzled.\" How this came about, it is now proper that we should proceed to describe. After his hunting accident, Captain Helmsley had been removed, with care and safety, to the neighbouring town of Newbridge. There, Dr. Quilter conducted a more exhaustive examination than had been possible on the scene of the accident itself. He could now report even more favourably, though with proper professional limitations as regarded unexpected turns, or disobedience of orders. Some bones had been broken, and the shock had been a severe one, but there was nothing which time and medical aid could not successfuUy tide over. The bones had been now set, and, with the exception of a daily visit or two, Dr. Quilter had handed over the case to Sister Mary, whose experience and efficiency he had already known, not merely from repute, but from actual previous acquaintance therewith. Dr. Quilter's own residence was"], [380, "372 THE TURN OF THE TIDE under canvas at the Curragh, a couple of miles distant, and his regimental duties there, with an occasional visit to Mount Ogleby, sufficiently filled up his time. \"Under ordinary circumstances, I would give more of my attention to the case.\" This was another of his confidences to the learned Miss Ogleby. \"But I have complete trust in Sister Mary\u2014 -her real name is Mrs. Morris \u2014 another sad instance of your Irish movement, here. I must tell you all about her story some other time. She has brought a com panion with her, a young girl \u2014 I believe I ought to say young lady. I don't know much about her ; in fact, I haven't seen her yet. Mrs. Morris takes the work, as she knows I like to see her there. Of course, if there 's any need of me, I am to be told at once. This new system of nursing is a great change \u2014 yes, a great change for the better, though they haven't quite dispensed with us medical men yet. Well, aU goes fair, at present. The poor fellow got some hard knocks on his head, in his fall ; in fact, he was unconscious for a time.\" \" Isn't that very serious, Dr. Quilter ? \u2014 the head, you know?\" \" I haven't found it so \u2014 in Ireland,\" was the doctor's dry reply. \" But Captain Helmsley is not Irish ? \" \" No, that's true. It must be the country has that influence on people while they are in it ; in fact, I think nature was bound to make some such provision, here. The number of broken heads is enormous ; but the owners won't even submit to proper medical treatment. Hearts appear to be much more tender than heads, I find.\" It was the first joke which Dr. Quilter had yet made an attempt upon ; that is, if it was a joke, being delivered with a grave,' and even impressive, manner."], [381, "HARRY ! 373 No doubt, Miss Ogleby took the more scientific view of the matter, for she, without responsive smile, recurred to the former subject of the sick man. \" I hope, now that you have Captain Helmsley in your care, you will insist on what you think right. We are aU concerned in his case.\" \"That alone would ensure attention,\" replied the polite doctor. \" Of course, I and my sisters are very much interested,\" persisted Miss Ogleby; \"but I aUuded more particularly to the gentlemen of the Hunt \u2014 my father, for instance, and Mr. Annesley.\" \"I can understand that, too,\" replied Dr. Quilter, \"though hunting gentlemen take hunting accidents pretty much as a matter of course.\" \" This was hardly an accident \u2014 an ordinary hunting acci dent, Dr. Quilter. My father has been awfully indignant over it. I don't think Mr. Toff will be allowed to hunt here again.\" \" Well, well ! Wait tiU we see what comes of it. As I said before, the country appears to harden people's heads for the occasions. Besides, the young man comes of a hunting family ; the doctrine of development means nothing, or that is in his favour, too.\" \"Perhaps so, Dr. Quilter,\" said Miss Ogleby, who felt her gravity deserting her, \" only, theories should not be pushed too far, you'll understand.\" \"Decidedly not. What would become of the Practice? Anyway, we will have Captain Helmsley in the hunting field again. Then, perhaps, Mr. Toff wiU be allowed to hunt, too. You know, I said if the country made heads hard, it made hearts soft as well. I don't think you raised any objection to that theory ?"], [382, "374 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" I thought I did. I said Captain Helmsley did not belong to the country.\" \" So you did ; I explained all that ; besides, that was about the heads ; you had nothing to say about the hearts \u2014 I mean, no objection, Miss Ogleby?\" \"Perhaps, I ought to say this, Dr. Quilter,\" replied the lady, resuming some of her gravity. \"Don't you think the heads ought to decide about Mr. Toff, before there is another occasion for your assistance. I don't see how that is to be explained away.\" \" We'll settle about Toff some other time,\" said the Doctor. \"I think Captain Helmsley ought to have a voice in that matter. You give in to me about the hearts, though ? \" \" I suppose it depends very much on the way people feel ; just now, we all feel a little hard on the subject of Mr. Toff.\" Dr. QuUter was inclined to say, \" Toff be blowed ! \" But his politeness came to his assistance, and he managed to say, instead, that the man had not done so much mischief, after all. From all this it may be inferred that the foregoing con versation had taken place before Dr. QuUter had made mention of anything serious in the progress of his patient's recovery. In truth, the contrary had been the case. Sister Mary had settled down to her accustomed work, having made all her arrangements, and adhering with much firmness to them. The making of those arrangements had entailed upon her some thought, in which she had sought no assistance, even from her young companion, merely communicating to her the result, when arrived at. As regards that companionship itself, at the present junc ture, she was not yet easy in her mind. Macnab had certainly"], [383, "HARRY ! 375 made safe the portion of duty assigned to him ; the mother would not leave her present place of abode during the absence of her daughter. Sister Mary \u2014 or Mrs. Morris, as she now insisted on being called \u2014 did not at all agree with the line of argument which had led the sergeant thus to place his own sense of duty above the stricter calls of veracity. The result \u2014 this very companionship \u2014 was aU she had now to consider. She saw no possible harm in it \u2014 none if the mother's consent had been obtained on more veracious grounds \u2014 except, perhaps, some not unreasonable reluctance on her part. As Mrs. Morris had already hinted, she might not wish the advance to come from herself. But what had been done could not now be helped, except to aUow no further complications. She would fulfil her in tention of writing to Mrs. Hilton, telling her the true facts of the case ; and, pending her reply, taking the whole task of the sick-room upon herself. If such a statement led to any change of disposition in the mind of Mrs. Hilton, well, then, Florence could return at once \u2014 and who was to be the wiser of anything? Thus Dr. Quilter had been entirely accurate in his facts as communicated to Miss Ogleby, only he related those facts as they passed through his mind, not through that of Sister Mary. Mrs. Morris had not long to wait for a reply to her letter. It was a nice and kind reply, and very much what she ex pected. At the supposed request of herself, Mrs. Hilton had entrusted Florence to her. It was somewhat different when, now, Mrs. Hilton learned that such supposition was not strictly accurate ; Sister Mary had not put it any stronger than this in her letter; her intention stiU was to be more unreserved with Macnab himseU, hut with Mrs. Hilton she went no"], [384, "376 THE TURN OF THE TIDE further. It was enough ; the request of Macnab and that of Sister Mary were not interchangeable quantities. She thanked Mrs. Morris for the arrangements she had already made, and added that her daughter should now return to her. Florence might see her cousin before so doing ; her mother saw no objection to that \u2014 saw no objection to the whole companionship, and all that was originally intended to be entailed with it, if the imaginative Macnab had not thus got himself mixed up in the transaction. AU this was pretty much what Sister Mary had been ex pecting; it now brought nearer \u2014 nay, imminent \u2014 another explanation which had also existed mentally before her. Florence was to be told that she was to return ; and her feelings were to be spared, in the best manner that friendship could devise. Perhaps, after all, the kindest way was that which would be soonest done. Mrs. HUton's letter had been brought to her while she was at her post in the sick-room ; she told the bringer, an under-nurse, to send to her Miss Neville \u2014 that being the name still retained, at Mrs. Morris's own suggestion and wish. Florence stole quietly into the sick-room. It was her first visit ; she was now to be told it was her last. \" He is asleep, dear. I suppose you hardly recognise him ? \" \" Oh, yes, Mrs. Morris, I recognise him. Do you think he suffers \u2014 much ? \" \" No, that 's all over ; not to return, I hope. He is getting on very nicely. I don't think you will be wanted at all, now, and your mother would like you back ; first, she wished you to see your cousin.\" \" You have got a letter from her ? Does she say so ? Why cannot I wait, and go back with you ? \" \"I cannot tell you here, but I will have to teU you. One"], [385, "HARRY ! 377 of the under-nurses will relieve me in half-an-hour; I will tell you more then. His sleep is a little broken, and I would not like to have him disturbed now.\" Florence knew what this meant \u2014 she was to leave the room. They had been speaking very low, and Sister Mary had seated herself for the occasion some distance from the slumbering patient. Still, the slumbers were disturbed \u2014 might cease at any moment. Florence made a step or two nearer to the bedside. Her mother wished her to see him before she returned ; she perfectly understood from Mrs. Morris that she was to return. The movement itself was noiseless \u2014 but Mrs. Morris certainly heard the slumherer increasingly restless \u2014 and, yes, she also heard his name breathed by the young girl. Then she knew she was alone in the room with the sick man. That seemed a long half-hour to Sister Mary \u2014 not, if she had her choice, she would shorten it; the real trial was after. Florence was no child, and she should not be treated as a chUd\u2014 only, her feelings were not to be wounded. Nor was this all. The poor patient grew still more restless, and Sister Mary was obliged to give him a soothing draught. At length he slept really, and she was relieved. Then she rejoined Florence. The young girl was not so quiet now ; there were traces of an excitement which she sought to subdue \u2014 there were also traces of tears. She had already commenced packing her box, but had stopped in the middle of her task. The operation was now resumed, as Sister Mary entered the room. \"I do not see why I could not wait here tiU you were ready to return yourself,\" she repeated. \" Not if your mother writes for you to return now ? \" \" But mamma permitted me to come with you \u2014 why not to return with you, Sister Mary ? \""], [386, "378 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \"In the first place, Florence, I cannot return just now \u2014 and Mrs. Hilton wishes you to do so.\" \" But is it not unreasonable, Mrs. Morris \u2014 don't you think that?\" \" I do not quite.\" \" Then, perhaps, the sergeant was right, and mamma is not disposed to be reconciled at aU ? Still, what has that to say to cousin Harry? She said she did not mix him up in their unfortunate matters \u2014 you heard her say that yourself ! \" \" She said that certainly, and I don't think she has changed her mind.\" \"Oh! then it's the general reconcilement \u2014 she won't have that now ? \" \" I hope she will, dear ; but, up to the present, she has not reaUy been asked, you know.\" \"Not after cousin Harry had been looking for us \u2014 every where ; and would be doing so now, only for this accident ! Did you not tell mamma aU that ? \" \" I did. I wish this accident had never happened ; then everything would be quite understood among you aU. At present, I fear there has been a little misunderstanding \u2014 I think I must tell you that.\" \" Then, Cousin Harry wasn't looking for us at all ! \" \" Oh ! certainly, he was looking for you. But now you have been found \u2014 and your cousin will soon be well again \u2014 and, then, it wiU be as if there had been no accident at all. Your mamma thinks it better, dear, that cousin Harry should find you both together, just in that way. Your mamma has always looked upon her present position, and yours, of course, too, as only temporary ; that is quite irrespective of any reconcilement with the people of Helmsley Hall. I don't fuUy understand how it is to be, hut she always spoke to me as if she waited for this ending, and expected it.\""], [387, "HARRY ! 379 \" Oh ! I know all about that, Mrs. Morris. Lord Mangerton has been ever so long in negotiation with some wealthy person, or persons, to buy his estate. If that happens, mamma will get her money back again.\" \" Very well ; I did hear something about this from others. I generally shut my ears to all such references \u2014 not in your case, you will understand; but people often tell me all such matters will have a good ending, yet \u2014 and I know it is only their kindness which prompts them to say so. Well, that is only my own case, not yours and your mother's, and therefore she is entitled to have her wishes.\" During this conversation, Florence had proceeded with the packing of her box \u2014 sometimes rapidly, sometimes slowly, sometimes even more slowly, according to her various degrees of difference with Sister Mary's line of argument. But Sister Mary had just now, accidentaUy, struck another line, which appeared to be more effective. This slight reference to her own sad case had brought the tears to her eyes; they had never been very far from those of the young girl, and, as the box was now full, Florence herself was softened, and also compliant. \" You say it is mamma's wish that I should return ? \" \" I will miss you very much, Florence \u2014 but that is her wish.\" \" And you think I should obey 1 \" \" Certainly, you should obey ; neither of us can doubt that, at all.\" \"Very well. I hope you'll get along comfortably, until I send a nice person to keep you company, and help you \u2014 more than I have been able to do. Do you think the doctor knows his business ? \" \" Oh ! yes \u2014 I daresay he does. Besides, he can get any amount of assistance he requires from the Curragh.\""], [388, "380 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" But nothing of that kind will be required, now ? \" \" No \u2014 everything has been done. Only rest and quiet are now necessary.\" \" And, then, you say he is so very skilful ? \" \" Doctor Quilter ? I do not recollect saying that. It appears to me that he knows his business. However, they teU me here that he is in love.\" \" Is not that very dangerous, Sister Mary ? \" \" No. He takes it quite in a philosophical form, and, I am told the lady does the same.\" \" I don't call that love, at aU.\" \" It may be, with some people.\" \"I have no great trust in such people. You are sure he won't neglect his patient ? \" \" I am sure / won't.\" After that, there was hardly anything more to be said. Whatever the reason \u2014 and Florence certainly knew there was a reason \u2014 her mother wished her to return ; and Sister Mary joined in that wish, not merely on the head of filial duty, but also because it was the only way to undo that which had been wrongly done. Perhaps a time would come \u2014 so Sister Mary now reasoned with herself, after she had carried her point \u2014 when aU this could be explained to Captain Helmsley, even by Florence herself. But that time was not now, and, at present, this process of undoing ought to be gone through as if it would never come. And what applied to Captain Helmsley, applied to the doctor \u2014 to everyone. Her companion had come as Miss Neville \u2014 and as such she should depart. It had caused her some pain to be firm with Florence ; it would cause no pain, and perhaps not as much mental expedient, to be firm with others."], [389, "CHAPTER XXXVII. WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOW t IT may be that Sister Mary had miscalculated her position \u2014 had thought that Macnab's well-meant indiscretion was now as if it had never been. We shall see. On the following day, Dr. Quilter paid his customary visit ; so far, everything had gone favourably, and thus his visits to Captain Helmsley's bedside had become visits of custom, no longer of necessity, no longer still of urgency. At the same time, he was not the man to abandon proper professional routine. A chair had to be brought to the bedside, and the patient had to be addressed in the proper medical formula \u2014 \" How do we feel, to-day ? \" \"Who is it?\" said the sick man. \" Quilter. You know me, Helmsley ? \" The patient attempted to pass a hand over his brow ; his cheeks were flushed, and his eyes burned more brightly than returning health explained. \" I know no one \u2014 and I appear to know everyone,\" was the strange utterance which came from his lips. \" What brings you here ? Perhaps, you 're not Quilter, at all ? \" It was now the doctor's turn to pass his hand over his brow. Mechanically, his other hand felt for the patient's pulse. \" I 'm Quilter, old fellow\u2014 there 's no mistake about that. Where do you suppose you are, now ? \""], [390, "382 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" I don't know ; sometimes here, sometimes there. It 's the people that get mixed up, somehow.\" \" You 're feverish, certainly. And you 've had a nasty sort of a shake. Shall I teU you all about it ? \" The patient interposing no objection, Dr. Quilter proceeded to recapitulate the events of the last hunting-day, with its un fortunate result. \" There 's a collar-bone broken \u2014 that 's going on aU right. There 's a couple of ribs, to which I can say ditto. I've been teUing all your friends that you were doing credit to me. Do you know where you are, now 1 \" The sick man made no immediate response ; probably, he was tackling the question in his own way. Presently, he gave ex pression to the single monosyllable, \" No.\" Dr. Quilter again put his hand to his head, and again felt the patient's pulse. \" Well, we won't argue the question. You 've been exciting yourself over something. I won't have people coming here and talking to you. It's \u2014 it 's not fair to me.\" Dr. Quilter had an unaffected concern for the young man who had now, for some considerable time, been his companion. But his concern also lay with his profession; wherefore, he had thus put it on personal considerations. Something like an expression of dissent passed over the patient's face. \"I think you'd better let me talk, Quilter. You can't stop these people coming here, or \u2014 or anywhere else.\" \" Why not ? I 'm an authority here, at least, you know.\" \" That may be \u2014 as far as authority goes. Besides, a man must talk or think, I suppose ? Now that you are here \u2014 and are Quilter, I 'd rather talk with you.\" This seemed so reasonable, and, in fact, complimentary, that the doctor could utter no further protest. \" Well, man, I 'U no' gainsay that. But why me 1 \""], [391, "WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOW? 383 The patient was silent awhile, apparently collecting his thoughts. \" You shall hear. You have always dealt tenderly with the supernatural \u2014 if you 're Quilter, confess to that.\" \" Oh, ay \u2014 in the way of conversation, you '11 understand. I dursn't let it control my medical faculties. What's up wi' ye, Helmsley ? Ye 're no going daft, man ! \" \" It 's that \u2014 or something else.\" Then, the patient managed to tell his doctor something about the quest which had been laid upon him \u2014 how he had known Mrs. Hilton and her daughter in years gone by \u2014 how, recently, he had engaged professional services to aid him in the search for them. \" I tell you, Quilter, the young girl came and stood by my bedside yesterday \u2014 was it yesterday? WeU, anyway, she was here, in this room.\" Dr. Quilter had listened with admirable patience, and re pression of feeling. \" You 're feverish, Helmsley ; and this matter has been upon your mind, you '11 understand. We can only accept the supernatural when all other conjectures saU. Yes, I '11 go that far as your friend, but no' as your doctor, ye '11 heed ; when a man goes farther than that, ye 'U take my advice, and give him a wide berth.\" In truth, Dr. Quilter felt some inclination to read his patient \u2014 or rather, perhaps, his friend \u2014 a strong, Scotch metaphysical lecture ; though, on second thoughts, he determined to defer the time and occasion. \" Ye 're upset \u2014 ye '11 no deny that, mon.\" The doctor was now speaking in his own vernacular; so much of an airing his hobby insisted on claiming. \"I'll succumb to what's reasonable \u2014 but I'll no allow the super natural into a sick room.\" The patient himself seemed inclined to foUow his doctor's implied recommendation, and defer, or abandon, discussion. But, then, Dr. Quilter's curiosity was certainly aroused ;"], [392, "384 THE TURN OF THE TIDE his hobby had been brought out before him, so to speak, and a short canter thereon was actually suggested. Nay, who knows ? \u2014 here might be material for one of those psychological papers for which he had won so deserved a reputation ! Even to himself, much less to his patient, he would not \" succumb \" to the supernatural \u2014certainly not, unless under exhaustive and convincing proof ; but the correlation of mental and sensual states, now \u2014 why dis courage evidence of that. \"Did \u2014 it hold converse with you, now, Helmsley? Not that I 'd fash my mind any more about the circumstance, but, ye '11 take it, as a medical man it 's my duty to assure ye.\" The patient's response to these somewhat contradictory interrogations was explanatory, rather than direct. \" I suppose I must have been asleep \u2014 and then I awoke \u2014 and this young lady left the room. I may have called out, or otherwise attracted observation, for the regular nurse, Mrs. Morris, came forward and gave me a draught \u2014 and, then, I slept again.\" \" It 's a fairly -connected narrative, Helmsley \u2014 about as connected as any I 've heard, under the circumstances. But we '11 have to take it to pieces for you. Hear now ; you were asleep \u2014 and this matter of the quest was on your mind, and you dreamt you saw this young lady.\" \" It doesn't appear like a dream to me, Quilter,\" said the sick man. \"No \u2014 not as a dream would appear to a man in his usual health, when he awoke. But that 's the rational way to look at it. Then, again, your own personal experience in the matter ceased some years ago, as you have just told me.

There's no record of the like in the whole annals of the supernatural. Now for the other horn of the dilemma \u2014 the recognition. How do you account for that ? \" \" I 'm not accounting, Quilter. It appears to me that I awoke. You have that down ? \" Dr. Quilter had his note-book in hand, and, whether to please the patient or himself, was taking an occasional note. \" It even appears to me that I heard my name pronounced,\" continued the sick man. \"Oh! \u2014 she spoke to you ? It's against the rules, again, mind you ! spirits, like good children, don't speak unless they're spoken to.\" \"No \u2014 I said I thought I heard my name.\" \" Oh ! \u2014 \u25a0 there 's precedent for that. She called you 'Helmsley,' now \u2014 or, perhaps, 'Captain Helmsley'?\" \" No ; she said ' Harry.' We used to call each other by our Christian names.\" \" And that 's all the recognition you got ? \" \" That \u2014 and the voice ; I think I hear it still.\" \" Zounds ! Helmsley,\" said the doctor, evincing some un easiness \u2014 \"I'U no allow ye to gang that gait in my hearing. Be practical, man. After that, ye say, the nurse gave yon a soporific; I must inquire about that. Mrs. Morris is an experienced nurse \u2014 we have met before \u2014 and it may be that the drug was necessary. Now, if you had the drug first, and \u2014 the vision then ? \" \" I have given you the actual order of events. Perhaps 2 B"], [394, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 386 you 're right, after aU, Quilter. I daresay Toff has done for me.\" Dr. Quilter had obtained the materials for an interesting \u2014 perhaps, even, a valuable \u2014 contribution to his \"society.\" But it was time, now, to resume the more matter-of-fact prac titioner. \" You 're worth two gone, yet, man. I '11 no' deny the circumstance calls for reflection. Maybe, I haven't been sufficiently attentive on my own part. Not that it 's medical skill ye stand in need of, now ; it 's rest \u2014 rest and quiet, Helmsley. 1 11 have a talk with Mrs. Morris, and we '11 see if we can't let you have a less disturbed time of it.\" With these soothing generalities, the doctor got himself out of the sick room. He was stUl the doctor \u2014 not the psycholo gist. Helmsley's statements were to be traced to his own condition ; of that, he did not permit himself to doubt. Still, these statements were not quite in accordance with Dr. Quilter's own experience of the like. There was a certain coherency about them which should not escape professional penetration, and which had not escaped him, though he strove successfully to hide the admission. In all previous experiences of his, the patient made his statement with a mixture of insistence and irresolution, which sufficiently indicated the unbalanced mind. Here, the matter itself, and not the manner, was the suspicious element. He did have his talk with Mrs. Morris. But Sister Mary had now leisure to arrange her thoughts, and to settle on her plan of action. She would undo Macnab's indiscretion, as far as hi her lay. The persons chiefly \u2014 and really \u2014 interested might come to compare notes, in time \u2014 and she hoped and trusted that the time would come ; but, as regarded mere outsiders, it was no business of theirs.

In the opinion of that gentleman, the case was rather a pretty one, as it stood. As a psychological study \u2014 he would permit himself to go no further than that \u2014 he was now arranging his own thoughts, and settling his own plans thereon. He received no enlightenment from Sister Mary, nor, indeed, did he press for any. \" He '11 be all right, presently, Doctor. I have had no serious fears for him.\" \" Nor I ; that was my own view of the case. I suppose it will he as you say.

IN reply to those invitations of Mr. Darley, a conjoint answer had been sent to that gentleman, naming an early day for the meeting at his office. However, notwithstanding that assertion of Mrs. Ogleby, her husband did not turn up on the occasion. \" What are you going to do when you get there ? \" asked the husband of his wife, on the evening previous to the day so named. \"We are asked in to hear counsel's opinion.\" There was a time when Mrs. Ogleby dreaded any allusion to that un fortunate disposition which old Mr. Warburton had made, or attempted to make, of his affairs. But, insensibly, such feelings were wearing away. The wronged man himself could now discuss the matter in a calm, and even philosophic, spirit. His grievance had always been hers, too ; and, while she strove with him, her sympathy also went with him. Now that there was no strife, she could regret the more the injustice which had been done. \" When we have heard what Dr. Gloss has got to say, we can say something among ourselves,\" she added. \" Then, you haven't heard the opinion, yet ? \" \" No. We did think Mr. Darley might have let us know that.\" \"These sort of people never do. Everything must trickle"], [398, "390 THE TURN OF THE TIDE through themselves, and by very slow degrees. That is the way bills of cost are run up.\" \" You cannot say much on that head about Mr. Darley. We have given him a great deal of trouble from time to time, and \u2014and \" \" Very little of anything else,\" added the husband. \" No, Darley is not one of that sort \u2014 only, I suppose, his office follows the practice of all other offices. Of course, he will have to tell you, now.\" \" What are you going to do yourself, Arthur ? \" This was a great advance for Mrs. Ogleby ; awhile ago, she could hardly contemplate herself putting such a question on such a subject. But, perhaps, the reply was just as much of an advance on the other side. \" I have been thinking about it. Properly speaking, you know, I am not concerned in the matter.\" \" Not directly \u2014 unless Dr. Gloss says there is no will at all. Then, you must assert your rights.\" \"Dr. Gloss won't settle that. You may get half-a-dozen opinions, only to make the case more confused.\" \" We know that. Mr. Darley has procured the best opinion avaUable. At all events, it is something better than our own attempts to lay down the law.\" \" I am not disposed to go, in any case,\" finally said the Master of the Mount. \" I don't think I would be consulting my dignity \u2014 if there is any of it left to me.\" They were the only bitter words he had yet used, and Mrs. Ogleby heard them with some return of her uneasiness. \" If you think that, I will not ask you to come. We all hope that Dr. Gloss has seen his way to declare the will void.\" \" A lawsuit only can do that,\" persisted the Master of the Mount."], [399, "FAMILY AFFAIRS 391 \" Yes, that is understood. The girls say there is to be no litigation, if it rests with them.\" \" If the right is on their side, why should not they assert it, too ? \" \" They do not take that view of the matter. The money ought to have been yours, first.\" \" Yours, you mean, I suppose ? \" \" WeU, what is mine is yours ; the law is clear enough on that head. They say their grandfather should have made such a disposition of his affairs at the beginning.\" \" It is very dutiful of children to say so \u2014 only, one can't commend the wisdom.\" A_nd, for the first time in reference to these unfortunate affairs, something in the nature of a laugh, which was not unkindly, was heard from the man. Quite recently Mrs. Ogleby had heard, or overheard, the expression of some such sentiment from her daughters, and her under standing was now quick to take in the import of this first attempt at merriment. \" That wouldn't happen now, Arthur ? \" \" I won't promise. If the girls want to make martyrs of themselves, let them have the whole credit of it. Anyhow, I 'U leave the matter among yourselves.\" Thus, it was known that the head of the house would not attend at Mr. Darley's office. Mrs. Ogleby had said that she would not press the step upon him, and, on reflection, she was obliged to confess that his decision was a reasonable, and even a prudent one. His position, U attending, would he painful to all should counsel uphold the wiU. WhUe, on the other hand, if the calm inteUigence of a Dr. Gloss should make legal waste paper of that unfortunate document, then his absence would much facUitate such free discussion as the new circumstances might call for. She was glad to find that her husband could"], [400, "392 THE TURN OF THE TIDE treat matters lightly and pleasantly. Even his \"I won't promise\" was plainly a joke. And thus, the journey of the morrow, U not without its serious aspect, could also be regarded hopefully. On that morrow the party for town started on its way, and the Master of the Mount retained so much of his easy com placency as to see his relatives off; then he took a quiet canter over to Ballinteer. The reader has seen this ancestral seat emerging from the spell of desolation and enforced lethargy which an intimidating and merciless conspiracy had thrown around it. So long the fields had remained untended, the fences uncared, the cattle driven away, or brutally shot down in their pastures. Then, with the first relaxation of those unwritten laws, the work of reclamation had commenced, and had spread. A while ago, the remark had been drawn from Captain Helmsley, seeing this in its first stages, \"A fine old place it is too, Annesley.\" Had it been possible for that gentleman now to see it, when these stages had further progressed, his note of admiration might have risen to a higher key. Man had done his needful and allotted toil, and had then handed over the development of the task to Nature. In other words, early spring had now given place to early summer. At no time had there been open enmity between the young owner of the property and the tillers of its soil. By many indications, unobtrusive, nay, almost furtive, it was certain that the feeling of kindliness largely predominated. When Charles Annesley appeared among them, his presence was invariably treated with respect ; further than that they dare not make open show. Father Doyle had the courage, the moral sense, the worldly shrewdness \u2014 be the motive what it might \u2014 to stand between his people and their true oppression, and intrigue had betaken itself to soils still more congenial."], [401, "FAMILY AFFAIRS 393 The elder man found his young friend still busy. The fields had been planted, and their occupiers now watched and assisted the natural development. But so long had ruin been in possession of the immediate belongings of the young man himself, that the work of reclamation was still far from complete. \"Anyway,\" remarked the visitor, \"you are bringing matters round, Annesley.\" \" I am glad they appear so. In time, perhaps, we shall have the real Ballinteer back again.\" \" What should you know about it, young man ! I knew the place before you were born.\" \" Well, we can't go back to that. There is many an acre gone since then. I must try and keep what 's left, if I can.\" \" You '11 have to marry some money, Annesley. Who knows but you might get some of those acres back ? \" \" I don't want them \u2014 at that price. I '11 marry for other considerations, or not at all. Matters are better with me now than I could have expected a short while ago.\" \"Don't mar them,\" said the elder man. Arthur Ogleby was thinking of those few words his wife had said. Was this young man really going to make a fool of himself ? \" We may consider that from different points of view,\" was the reply of the young man. \" From my point of view, the marred life is the loveless life.\" \"All young people talk in that way,\" said the elder man, who did not think the less of his young friend for the observa tion, nevertheless. \" AU young people who are not mean and sordid.\" \"I didn't quite intend that. I don't advise you to marry money without love. Why shouldn't a smart Master of his County Hunt, Uke you, get both?\" \" That should be as the smart young man may fix his choice.\""], [402, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 394 \"Oh !\" said the man who was no longer young, pleased that his pleasantry should be taken up \u2014 \"Go on \u2014 teU me some more. I have come over here to spend some of the day with you. My people have aU gone to town; by this time, I suppose, they are arranging their affairs \u2014 and my own.\" Those who lived within reasonable distance of Mount Ogleby were fully aware of the long-impending family matters affecting its inmates. In times past, the owner of the Mount himself had freely imparted such information to his friends. And, though his observations thereon had now grown more guarded, and far more rare, it was still known that no settlement had been yet arrived at. But, whether he spoke freely or guardedly, it was hardly a theme on which his friends could continue to interchange words with him. The two men had been now laughing, and Charles Annesley managed to keep up the laugh stiU, though with a decent modulation thereof, as he said, \" We can hope you are in safe hands \u2014 also that the arrangement wUl be the best for all parties.\" \" A man may make a fool of himseU \u2014 in other ways, Annesley,\" continued his visitor, heedless of the remark. \"Ways other than what?\" inquired the younger man. \" Oh ! \u2014 I was thinking of your matrimonial views \u2014 if you have any. By extravagance, now \u2014 living in excess of one's means.\" Then, Charles Annesley knew that his companion was referring to past infirmities of good-nature, and a thought occurred to him somewhat similar to that which like words had aroused in the family lawyer. Was the Master of the Mount stiU a sufferer from these indiscretions? But, in his reply, he resorted to the expedient of generalising the subject. \" The old people did that, certainly. You know, I was"], [403, "FAMILY AFFAIRS 395 always so fair as to say that the mischievous meddlers of our day have not worked all the ill. The old people prepared the way for them.\" \" Surely, I belong to them /\" \"I am speaking of those who have passed away.\" \"I am one of the old people,\" persisted Arthur Ogleby. \" Why should I reap benefits I have not sown ?\" \" I hope you will fully succeed in this matter,\" said the younger man, regardless of the proprieties of the case. \" That is kindness \u2014 not justice, Annesley.\" This younger man was hardly sufficiently careful of himself. It was an impropriety \u2014 at least he would have thought so, some time ago \u2014 to have answered this old man at all on the subject of his special grievance. But now he abandoned himself further. \" I was not thinking of either. Just now, I said that this here young man, whom you are pleased to call smart, can marry only where choice directs him. Choice has already directed him where he thought there was no money, nor any prospect of it.\" \" That was not smart, certainly,\" replied the man who had insisted on being numbered with the old. He was not quite at his ease, and he thus spoke in the effort to appear that which he was not. What had his wife meant by those words of hers ? \u2014 and what was the choice which his young friend now spoke of? \"That was not smart, certainly,\" he repeated. \" No ; not according to the principles you have been enunciating \u2014 but which you do not believe any more than I do myself. Well, what would it now be if I sought more than I had to give?\" \"Well, an advance in the principles you won't give me credit for. But what talk is this, Annesley? Your own"], [404, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 396 prospects have been brightening ; you have just confessed as much yourself. No one objects to you on that account ; why be the only unreasonable person yourself?\" \"All the same, I hope you will succeed.\" \" I hope all wiU have the success they deserve ; that is not saying very much for myself.\" After that, the young man understood that no more refer ence to the subject was expected from him on that precise occasion. In fact, his visitor shortly afterwards remounted his horse and rode away, though not in the direction of his home. The hunting season was now over, and most of the hounds had been put out \" to board \" with the small farmers scattered about \u2014 another proof of returned amity, as well as the natural bent of the people to foster field-sports. The Master of the Mount now stated his intention was to pay a round of inspection to these temporary quarters."], [405, "CHAPTER XXXIX. MR. DARLEY READS COUNSEL'S OPINION. IN the meantime, Mrs. Ogleby, her daughters, and her son in-law had found their way to town. They were now in the office of Mr. Darley, and, if not quite arranging their own and their relative's affairs there, as the owner of the Mount had intimated, were deep in the discussion of such preliminary matters as might conduce thereto. Of Mr. Darley himself, it may be said that he was not unwUUng that a certain impressiveness should attach to the conference. He was assisted by his head clerk, possibly selected for the occasion by reason of a dignity and gravity superior even to his employer. He received with a becoming expression of regret the intimation from Mrs. Ogleby that her husband would not attend, though the absence made him more completely master of the situation, and, within himself, he fairly appreciated the motives of it. After that, he proceeded to the actual business of the con ference. Dr. Gloss was not a man to make an uncertain sound, if by any means he could extract clearness from the materials submitted to him. In the present instance, that was not within the compass of any legal luminary, however luminous. But he did what he could, and he certainly reduced the uncertainties of the case to their minimum extent. Perhaps it would be better to give the really effective portion of his opinion, in his own words :"], [406, "398 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" It is to be observed,\" ran these words, \" that the will bears date 25 August, 1865, the testator surviving its execution for a subsequent period of five years. During that period of five years, events occurred which must materially affect the validity of the disposition in question. The testator bequeathed his real and personal estate to his grandchildren, share and share alike, such bequest to take effect when the youngest of them should attain to the age of twenty-one years. At such date of execution of this testamentary disposition, there were five of these grandchildren ; at the date of testator's own death there were but three, whom I understand to be still surviving. In my opinion, the validity of the bequest will wholly depend upon the date which the court may assign to the document itseU. If the court holds, as there are instances, that the will as propounded \u2014 thus expressing, as must be inferred, the intentions of the testator up to the period of his decease \u2014 is to be taken as bearing date of such decease, then I am to consider that no element of contention arises. If, on the other hand, it is to bear date as of its execution, in such case I am compelled to come to the conclusion that it is now void from remoteness.\" Mr. Darley read this portion, as well as all the other portions, of counsel's opinion with much impressiveness ; but, of course, this particular part, as containing the very backbone, so to speak, of the eminent man's construction of old Mr. Warburton's testamentary intentions, received an extra allowance of deliber ation and emphasis. Then he removed and wiped his spectacles, amid a profound silence around him ; finaUy, after that, he sat down. The head clerk had also stood up during the reading, probably to afford more effectual support to his employer in his performance, but now, collecting together some papers, he glided from the room, carefully closing the door behind him."], [407, "MR. DARLEY READS COUNSEL'S OPINION 399 Mr. Potter was the first to find his voice, after these cere monies had been completed. He, Mr. Potter, understood \u2014 that is to say, he was in a position to declare \u2014 that under no circumstances would the anxiety, the cost, he might add, the indecorum of a family contention be entered upon. That was his own view of the matter, on a consideration of aU the surroundings of the case, and it gave him pleasure to put it forward as the resolve of those with whom he was so immediately connected. The words were not many, but, then, the subject itself was altogether out of the general line of the reverend gentleman, and, in fact, he looked round upon his audience with a view of learning how he had acquitted himself. \" Very nicely, dear,\" was Mrs. Potter's reply. After that, the lady herself was silent, in common with all her relatives, for it was plain that Mr. Darley was about to speak again. That gentleman had resumed the use of his spectacles, and was now running his eye over counsel's opinion for the second time. \" Yes, that was a very satisfactory statement,\" he proceeded to say \u2014 \" coming as it did from a gentleman occupying Mr. Potter's position in the family. Nevertheless, it was desirable to recur to an observation of counsel, which might not have received the attention it deserved, and which certainly bore upon the reverend gentleman's remarks. Yes, here it is ; refer ring to the former portion of his opinion, counsel adds, ' In the absence of such contention, it is open to the parties interested to carry out the admitted wishes of the testator, or until such time as contention may arise.' \" Mr. Darley gave all the emphasis in his power to these latter words, and then endeavoured to look his best as a man who paused for a reply. Possibly, his look rested with more particular meaning on the two unmarried daughters of the"], [408, "400 THE TURN OF THE TIDE house of Ogleby, for these two ladies made effort to conceal a somewhat heightened colour under a becoming gravity. But reply there was none, untU Mrs. Ogleby herself broke the impressive silence. \" Contention means law, I suppose ? \" \" Yes, that is what we mean by contention,\" said Mr. Darley. \"And my son-in-law says that he won't have that?\" \" Mr. Potter has just intimated that such a course will not have his approval,\" assented Mr. Darley, though with some appearance of reserve in his manner. Besides, the two un married daughters were conscious that his glance turned toward them, instead of toward the married Mrs. Potter, as he made this reply. \" Nevertheless, counsel thinks that the will is- \u2014 what did you say ? \u2014 ' void from remoteness,' I think ? \" \" Yes, mamma,\" here interposed Mrs. Potter \u2014 \" Mr. Darley explained all that to me and Patrick some time ago, and I endeavoured to make you understand it.\" \"Perhaps, Mr. Darley himself could do that better, Fanny ? \" \" Certainly, Mrs. Ogleby,\" said the gentleman thus men tioned. \" Mr. Warburton declares his intention, in his will, that it should take effect when his youngest grandchild, then living, should be twenty-one years old \u2014 an event which has not happened, and which never wiU happen now. Such a form of testamentary disposition the law makes invalid.\" There were some more last words. But this final statement of Mr. Darley, just given, appeared to all present to contain the sum and substance of the situation, and Mr. Darley him self, when pressed, confessed that practically there was none other, the rest being unpractical and little short of desperate. \" Of course, Dr. Gloss felt it his duty to tell his clients what"], [409, "MR. DARLEY READS COUNSEL'S OPINION 401 they could do, or try to do, but, all the same, he has written against the will.\" After that, there was neither need nor excuse for longer delay, and Mrs. Ogleby and her relatives took their departure. Mrs. Ogleby had come to the office with the same sympathies toward her husband which she had always held, and professed. If anything, these sympathies were now stronger, more dis tinct. Arthur Ogleby was an injured man \u2014 had been an injured man all the time he was out of this money \u2014 her money, his money ! The law now said it. Dr. Gloss, the exponent of the law, thought it. But strong as this feeling was, it was hardly the one upper most in her mind. Her children had fully assured her that they would enter upon no doubtful or undutiful courses, and all that was done and said to-day made the assurance certain. She was bound to give due consideration to them, and to repress her emotions of triumph, if they amounted to so much. Their conduct had its heroic side, even the day's results could not deprive it of this. Thus, the whole party reached their train, and eventuaUy the Mount, without any very great overflow of conversation, though what there was was friendly, and even congratulatory. The Mount's owner had not yet come back from Ballinteer. Mrs. Ogleby had taken upon herself the task of recounting to her husband the events of the day. The undertaking had its difficulties and its apprehensions, the thoughts of which had not been absent from her mind since she had left the office of Mr. Darley. Nevertheless, it was now a disappointment to her that he was not at the Mount before her. There was so much longer to bear this suspense \u2014 to conjecture how he would take this new position, which was not altogether an 2 c"], [410, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 402 independent one. Besides, he should have returned by this time. He had told his family he would spend a portion of the day at Ballinteer. He had said nothing about the round of inspection afterwards. But it was now late \u2014 almost dark. In his outgoings, as well as his incomings, Arthur Ogleby was certainly eccentric. But he would never willingly put his wife to so severe a test on the present occasion. The most obvious course was followed. A messenger was despatched to Ballinteer. Thus it was first learned that the master of the Mount had left there many hours before, but had stated his intention to visit half-a-dozen farm-houses before returning home. Charles Annesley was by no means satisfied with furnishing this information. In a few moments he himself was in the saddle, and had started in the direction of the first of these farm-houses. Sure enough, Arthur Ogleby had been there. So also had he been at the second one. Then his track had been lost. He had not visited the third farm-house at all. By this time there was quite a company with the young owner of Ballinteer. A messenger was now sent on to the fourth farm-house, on the supposition \u2014 an unlikely one \u2014 that the missing man had dropped the unvisited one out of his list. In the meantime, Charles Annesley confined his search to the immediate neighbourhood. The neighbourhood was that of the stone fence, the deep gripe, and the road beyond that, where Captain Helmsley had so recently met his accident. Presently, it was told to the young owner of BaUinteer that Mr. Ogleby's horse was grazing on the other side of the stone fence. The horse was still saddled and bridled, and was wholly uninjured. His rider must be near, and was soon"], [411, "MR. DARLEY READS COUNSEL'S OPINION 403 found. He, too, was on the other side of the stone fence, but had met with some serious, if not actually fatal, mishap. It was impossible to fix with certainty how the disaster had come about, especially as the man himself could afford no information. The precise locality was not in the direct line between the second farm-house and the third. There was a deviation, shght it is true, but it was not the shortest way. Had the old sportsman gone thus a little out of his way to have another look at the scene of Mr. Toff's unlucky meddling? Then, having had his look, did the whim take him to put himself in Captain Helmsley's position ? True, he was a sportsman \u2014 an older and a more practised sportsman than the young English officer, and there was now no Mr. Toff to make officious interference. But the learner is not the person who generally comes to grief on these occasions, but the veteran whose very experience declines into easy carelessness. And we know enough of the man to assume that he would trifle with the present matter in a half contemptuous spirit. Be the conjecture true or not, none other now presented itself. The rider and the horse had both cleared the wall. Then Arthur Ogleby had fallen heavUy to the ground, and had so lain as he fell. The horse, too, had fallen \u2014 the marks on the ground were conclusive of that \u2014 but he had quickly recovered himself, and showed no sign of injury. The Master of the Mount was speedily, but carefully, conveyed to his home. Dr. Quilter was actually on his way to the Mount at the time ; so that there was the least possible delay in ascertaining the nature of the injuries caused, and their probable result. He was hopeful. The mishap was not necessarily a fatal one. But Arthur Ogleby would never follow his own, or any other, hounds again."], [412, "404 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Dr. QuUter was certainly right this time. As Mrs. Ogleby assiduously attended the stages of her husband's recovery, that question she had put to him more than once recurred to her mind \u2014 \"That would not happen again, Arthur?\" No, the patient gradually acquired freedom from pain ; strength of body, even pleasure of life, were again to be his. But his plea sure was to be led by his own, rather than by others, or even to lead himself. Old Mr. Warburton's money he was now the owner of; but even Mr. Warburton himself could have desired no better disposition of his affairs than that which he had unsuccessfully planned and plotted against. For the future, he kept neither his own accounts nor his own counsel. The accounts themselves were at sixes and sevens. But old Mr. Warburton's released funds, and the judicious manage ment of Mrs. Ogleby, soon set matters straight. It may be that the mind of Arthur Ogleby had been for some time tending toward this devolution of his affairs, prior to the accident which practically incapacitated him from indepen dent activity. It may be that the accident itself was the originating cause of the change. We have only to note the fact that anxieties on this head were no longer entertained."], [413, "CHAPTER XL. TWO'S COMPANY. WHILE Arthur Ogleby was returning to health, if not to his former activity, the young owner of Ballinteer had not relaxed his own exertions. During the long illness of his older friend, he had been attentive in his inquiries at the Mount, as well as proffering such aid as was needful in the helplessness of the head of the house. But now that such occasion had elapsed, symptoms of his former reserve seemed in danger of recurring. But what was he now to do with himself? The hunting season was over. He had commenced putting BaUinteer to rights before this late interruption. He had found himseU warming to the task, even indulging in hopes of seeing some thing like an old Ballinteer returning again. This task he could, and ought, to resume. There was still very much to be done. The place had to be rescued from total and absolute neglect. Returning spring, and now early summer, had thrown their charms around, helping to hide the work which called for man's attention. But who knew so well as Charles Annesley that the work was there ? He had now shaken off the apathy which so lately had oppressed him. There had been a beginning. A while ago, he had regarded everything as against him ; there was nothing left to him but to turn his back upon the old place, and the"], [414, "406 THE TURN OF THE TIDE spirit of resentment against injustice had alone prevented him from so doing. The turning point came \u2014 but in another direc tion. As on so many other Irish estates, the effort had been to play off the tenants against the landlord. \" Hold out, boys, and the landlords must go.\" The \"boys \" had held out, though far more through fear than iU-wiU, for it was a very real terror which stalked the land. Then, their parish priest had the courage to step out of his order, and to tell them that, if their landlord went, they certainly were going first. When that was fully understood, the game itself was played out. The strangest part of the whole affair was that there had been no ill-will at all ! No Annesley had ever been unpopular. The present young man went as near to popularity as was possible under this reign of terror, while it lasted. When it ceased \u2014 for the terror-mongers had now betaken themselves to \" fresh fields and pastures new \" \u2014 the landlord and his tenants were found mutually, and openly, assisting in the work of reclamation. In this way, though the close season had set in, the new Master of the Hounds was again busy. It was possible for him to remain in the home of his fore fathers. He had done nothing to bring this about \u2014 rather, he confessed to himself, he had been an impediment to his own advancement. But so far he had certainly advanced. He could now hold his ground, though that was nearly aU that his true friends and helpers had yet secured for him. The longer he held his ground with foresight and frugahty, the better should his circumstances be. But the neglect had been long and wide-spread \u2014 farms would take time to recover from it; and their holders must be treated with all the indulgence which the process demanded. That was the price which the parish priest had asked for his assistance. That was all that his friends could do for him, to enable him to tide over this"], [415, "TWO'S COMPANY 407 period of reclamation and recovery. No matter whose the fault, the laws of nature had been outraged, and the resulting losses had to be borne. Yet, Charles Annesley was now meditating on matters whose foresight, and frugality might appear open to question. That is how his head came to be at work, as well as his hands. When his thoughts had been on departure, his intention was that he should also leave behind him all tender associations. Now that he was to remain, the tender associations were not to be got rid of \u2014 one of them, at least. We have said that he had continued to hold on to the old place when no better reason could be assigned than the very spirit of opposition. But, perhaps, there was this other consideration. At all events, when he thought of the departure, he also thought of Kate Ogleby, realising the fact that a penniless adventurer, going out into the world to seek his fortune, could not, with any show of fairness or justice, take the affections of that young lady with him. When he thus thought, the prospect appeared to him a very dreary one indeed. But the departure was no longer thought of. He was to hold on, and in time matters would become better than that. What might, could, or should he do under these changed circum stances? He was bound to act with frugality, and such fore sight as was accorded to him. That was understood in the arrangement which enabled him to remain at Ballinteer. The work of the mischief-mongers was to be repaired; and on no tenant, and under no exigency, was the screw to be turned until that was done. Was it a time to marry? \u2014 or even to engage the affections of young ladies with a view to the marriage ceremony ? Why not \u2014 in this particular instance 1 The situation was open to question, and thus it was that Charles Annesley pro-"], [416, "THE TURN OF THE TIDE 408 ceeded to put interrogation to himself. Certainly, it could not be said that any of the Ogleby family had ever evinced symptoms of extravagance, with the single exception of the owner of the Mount himself. Nor had their expectations been high. \u2022 One daughter was already married to a country curate, and was reported to curb the expenses of their moderate estab lishment. Another \u2014 at least, this also was reported \u2014 was not disdainful of the advances of the medical adviser of a marching regiment. Well, putting aside altogether the rent-roll of the Ballinteer estate \u2014 as, indeed, he was bound in fairness at present to do \u2014 his salary as Master of the County Hunt exceeded the incomes of the curate and the doctor added together \u2014 though, to be sure, he had to hunt three times a week in the season on that. Why, then, had he hesitated? Just as well might he ask himself why had he been distant, and touchy, and irresponsive to those who had sought to befriend him ; for the one cause had led to both results. While he was poor, and needy, and unsettled, he had hesitated to make offer of marriage to, or even engage the affections of, a young lady to whom certain vague and undefined \"expectations\" belonged. What ought he now to do when there was a possible prospect before himself, and the \" expectations \" could hardly be said to stand in the way of the least mercenary ? What he actuaUy did was to write a letter to Mrs. Ogleby. When Arthur Ogleby hovered between hfe and death, this young man had taken counsel with Mrs. Ogleby, putting his hand to such matters of business as needed a man's handling. Now that there was a return to the more ordinary affairs of the household, so had Charles Annesley returned to his former con straint, even to limiting his visits to the Mount. The matter required explanation, or, at least, so it appeared to him. Thus"], [417, "TWO'S COMPANY 409 he had come to write his letter. How far he carried out his intention, the letter must say for itself. \"Dear Mrs. Ogleby, \u2014 Was I right in attributing to you a suggestion that I have been somewhat of a stranger of late? Possibty, Mr. Ogleby has told you of our last conversation before that sad mishap, which might have been so much worse \u2014 if not, fortunately, he can now corroborate me. He said to me, ' You should marry, selecting a wife with money.' My reply was that I had already fixed my choice from other considerations, and that, under no circumstances, did I consider myself entitled to look for what I could not bring. I will refer to the changes which have since occurred, only in order to add that I am of the eame mind as when I thus spoke. In other respects I am bound to admit the changes, seeing I have others to thank for them. My position here is better ; with care and good counsel it may become better stiU. I meant to leave the old place, keeping my disappointment to myself. Now that I may remain, I must add this explanation to what I have already said. I cannot stay here, and see happiness within my reach, without an effort to secure it.\" Having brought his letter to an end, the young man read it over more than once with some satisfaction to himself. No doubt, his intention had been to say that, if he resumed his visits to the Mount, it must be as suitor for the hand of Kate Ogleby. But he despatched the epistle to its destination, without so much as a suspicion that he had not communicated to paper the leading idea in his mind. The omission seemed to make no difference with Mrs. Ogleby. She received it as she sat by her husband's armchair, where all his waking moments were now passed. \" It 's a letter from Charles Annesley, Arthur \u2014 he wants Kate.\" Then she read the letter aloud, for her husband's further information. \" He doesn't say so. Read the letter again.\""], [418, "410 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \"That is what he means,\" said Mrs. Ogleby instead. \"Young men are never very explicit in these matters.\" \"Kate or no Kate, tell him to come over. He says some thing about that, certainly.\" Accordingly, Mrs. Ogleby told the young man to come over, which probably he understood, too. There was no more telling of any kind, as well within the household at the Mount as without, Mrs. Ogleby reserving further communi cation until the young man expressed himself more definitely. There had not been much delay in all this, and Charles Annesley received Mrs. Ogleby's note as his day's work at Ballinteer was drawing to a close. There would be still light to go across to the Mount. He might tell Kate anything he liked now \u2014 as least, as far as the permission of her mother would give interest to his communication. The note itself did not say so \u2014 did not even give an express invitation for that particular evening. But we have already seen some reading between the lines, and so the young man read now. Then he took his way across the fields to Mount Ogleby. He drew near to the house, unquestioned and unobserved. In the house itself, he would meet Mr. and Mrs. Ogleby, possibly Dr. QuUter, quite as possibly Mr. and Mrs. Potter. Yet it would be so very desirable that he should even see Kate first, if only to judge from her manner what that note left unsaid, and certainly intended to leave so. About this time in the evening, she and her sister, Sophy, would probably be in the grounds \u2014 most likely, in the garden, collecting fruit for the evening meal. He raised the latch, and entered. So far, he was right. But there also was Dr. Quilter \u2014 weU, he half-expected that, too. Never mind \u2014 besides, he was observed now. Kate's manner was no more explanatory than her mother's"], [419, "TWO'S COMPANY 411 note. In past times, the young man had been somewhat uncertain in his own manner \u2014 who knew that so well as himself ? \u2014 therefore it was incumbent on young ladies to exer cise reserve. However, that was all ; if Charles Annesley was any judge of female demeanour, Miss Ogleby had no suspicion of the interchange of letters which had taken place. On the other hand, Dr. Quilter's recognition of him was somewhat effusive for that gentleman. \" Bravo ! Annesley \u2014 come and help us with the straw berries.\" Annesley complied with the request. But Dr. Quilter presently drew the attention of his companion, Sophia, to some other object. Had he obtained a portion of the parental confidence ? If the young man might extend his judgment to the male species, he would say \u2014 no ; the doctor's object seemed pretty similar to his own, namely, the exclusive society of his own particular companion. \"He doesn't give much help himself,\" said the young man, ungratefully, and perhaps inconsistently. \" He and Sophy are employed on some paper,\" said Kate. \" It 's a great secret untU it is read before some learned society. Besides, there are enough of strawberries, now.\" \"That's allowing none for me. I am a guest here by \u2014 by invitation.\" \" There will be enough for all, Mr. Annesley.\" \"Very well, Miss Ogleby,\" said the young man, with some what exaggerated imitation of her formalism. \" We'll have to wait here for them, in any case.\" \" Why ? We have got no paper to prepare.\" \" I have got a letter from your mother.\" \"The invitation? \u2014 why should you want an invitation to como here ? \""], [420, "412 THE TURN OF THE TIDE \" The letter is not merely an invitation. But I could not come here without it. Shall I explain ? \" \" If you think it necessary. But, while you are doing so, mamma and my sisters must wait for their tea.\" Nevertheless, Charles Annesley did proceed with his ex planation. In the meantime, Dr. Quilter and his companion, having carefully considered their paper, found their way back to the house, and to the tea-room. \" We have been waiting for you \u2014 and the strawberries,\" said Mrs. Ogleby. \"Kate has the strawberries, mamma \u2014 Kate and Mr. Annesley.\" \" Ah ! Mr. Annesley is in the garden, too. We wondered we did not see him before.\" \"And we may wonder, now, when we will have our tea,\" said Arthur Ogleby."], [421, "CHAPTER XLI. FROM THE TOMB. SISTER MARY'S assurances of care for her patient, which she had made to her companion, Florence, were not without their practical results. In a few weeks more, Captain Helmsley was so far recovered as to no longer need her professional aid, and she returned to her regular duties at the large Dublin hospital to which she was attached. During that period, nothing had been seen or heard of Macnab, though the hospital nurse had determined with herself that time should not abate the severity of that rating she was to give him, on the score of his \" indiscretion,\" and the party he had made her to it. The whole matter was clear enough to her, now.

Once a week she obtained a few hours' outing, as rehef from these long and constant duties, and she generally availed herself of the opportunity to pay a visit to Mrs. Hilton and her daughter. On this particular evening she was now on her way thither, when Macnab suddenly, and unexpectedly, appeared in her path. \"You can't come with me to Mrs. Hilton, if that's what you 're here for. Perhaps, you know you can't ? \" \" You're not going there, yourself, Mrs. Morris \u2014 not to-night.\" Notwithstanding that rating in store for him \u2014 notwithstanding his present rebuff, which might be understood as a foretaste of it, the words were said in assured, though also kindly, tones. Apparently he knew what he was about. Instead of adding to resentment, these words had a contrary effect \u2014 that, and an emotion which the hospital nurse vainly endeavoured to control. \" Why ? It 's not Morris \u2014 my husband\u2014 is it ? \" \" Yes, Mrs. Morris, it 's your husband.

They are not kind by halves \u2014 much as they are abused.\" \" Abused by cut-throats and their employers,\" said the nurse bitterly. \"Why should they turn on Morris?\" \" Why ?

The expert attempted no reply. He, too, was about to make a start on his own particular path. In a few minutes more both figures had disappeared from the scene. The shades of evening deepened ; then, night itseU came upon the town. Hour succeeded hour, and was marked by the chimes of the various city clocks. Those from the Royal Hospital, hard by, proclaimed the hour of midnight as Sister Mary arrived at Kingsbridge. At this late period the bridge appeared entirely deserted. While she conjectured the cause of Macnab's want of punctuahty, that officer stood beside her. There was light enough to perceive he carried a small bundle ; in other respects, he appeared as ordinarily. He, on his part, perceived, with some satisfaction, that the hospital nurse had entirely discarded the dress which pro claimed her calling. Possibly this might be the result of her wish to elude recognition ; but, to the expert, it was further suggestive of an absolute abandonment of her late duties, in order to follow the fortunes of her now liberated husband. \" 1 do not think I have been followed, or even watched,\" she said, in a low tone of voice, as the man stood near enough to hear. \"Perhaps not. I have heard something more since I saw you last. We can speak as we go along. I am not sure but I am shadowed myself.\" 2 D"], [426, "418 THE TURN OF THE TIDE Kingsbridge \u2014 itself a modern structure \u2014 adjoins some of the very oldest portions of the city of Dublin.

But, on the present occasion, these other two associates of our narrative did not pursue that direction, but the opposite ; where, indeed, lie tracts still more removed from the life and fashion of the times. These latter words of Macnab had, naturally, deepened the interest of his companion. On any outward exhibition of this, however, she now put a strong restraint ; she had placed herseU under his guidance and protection ; he needed all his vigilance to be uninterfered with ; probably, he would explain when it became necessary or desirable. So she reasoned with herself, and was silent. When he did speak, it was not on that precise portion of the subject on which he had most strongly aroused her curiosity. \" You have made up your mind to go with Morris \u2014 I can see that.

She clasped her hands tightly together, as she said \u2014 \u25a0 \" WiU you not tell me what you know ?

He paused reflectively ; then he said \u2014 \" We hear there is someone going on board the mail vessel, besides Morris \u2014 besides yourself, if you do go, as, I suppose, you will. If that man gets on board, he will take a life. Morris knows too much to be let live, anywhere.\" \" Morris knows no more than the rest ? \" \" No ; it would be the same with any of the rest.

The houses were large, but, even where inhabited, in woful state of decay. Macnab paused at one of these, which stood oppo site a street lamp, but whose reference to either of these classes might be doubtful, unless appearances gave judgment against its tenancy.

It's the isolation; naturally, we see a good deal of it. They 're dazed for some time after they get out. It wears away ; but I thought it as well to tell you.\" Then Macnab gave a low whistle, accompanied by an equally low knock at the door. The double signal was evidently a preconcerted one ; for a step was heard in the haU, a bolt was withdrawn, and the door was opened. A man, not old, but whose head was almost white, stood in the doorway. \"It's Morris ! \u2014 it's my husband ! \" said the woman, after a moment's hesitation. \"He'U be aU right, presently; he's coming on nicely,\" said the good-natured Macnab. \" In the meantime, we '11 close the door.\" Suiting the action to the word, the expert shut and barred the door again. Then, for the first time, it became apparent that there was a dim light in the house, revealing a large \u2014 nay, a spacious \u2014 hall, in which the three persons now stood. The caution of the expert, however, did not stop here. Taking up the light, he preceded his two companions through this hall toward the back of the house, finally reaching a large \u2014 though deserted, and almost empty \u2014 room. \" Speak to him, Mrs. Morris \u2014 that will bring him round,\" he now said. \" We are pretty safe, here ; we can talk, and we can do something else to pass the time, until our train is ready for us.\" Again, suiting his actions to his words, the expert approached"], [429, "FROM THE TOMB 421 a portion of the room where stood a small table, and, for the first time, busied himself with that mysterious bundle which had been his constant companion during his midnight walk. It might be, probably it was, his intention to allow Mrs. Morris and her long-severed partner an opportunity for some confidential and uninterrupted conversation together. But other considerations soon made themselves apparent, as he proceeded with the investigation of his bundle. It contained refreshments, both in solid and liquid form, to the neat arrangement of which on the table he now gave his undivided, and apparently absorbing, attention. At length the important task was concluded, and he called to his two companions across the dim, and indeed considerable, space which the dimensions of the room allowed, to make trial of his foresight. \"There have been larger banquets, here,\" he said \u2014 \"more guests, a trifle more furniture \u2014 in fact, you '11 excuse the circumstances and the position \u2014 and saU to.

With his newly-rejoined partner it was not so. Macnab's previous conversation led her to know that the real trial lay before them, and even the present time and situation she regarded as insecure. The expert himself had confessed to a suspicion of being followed ; that the life of her husband would be attempted, he had made no concealment of. \"Does he know?\" she inquired, directing her glance from Macnab to the object of her solicitation and apprehension. \" He knows the set who brought him where he was \u2014 and the way they have of doing business.

Professional practice had made Macnab himself to take the peculiarities of the situation \u2014 like so many other situations which have followed fast and furious in the wake of this movement \u2014 as quite in his ordinary calling, and he proceeded to do fair justice to the viands of his own providing. The operation, however, did not at all interfere with the activity of his mental and intellectual faculties. \" Yes, time presses \u2014 not but we 'U have time to do justice to what 's here \u2014 there 's law enough for that, and to spare \u2014 but, you '11 understand, we '11 have to be at the station by morning's light. It 's a pretty tidy run, eight hours on a stretch ; and, then, hey ! for the blue sea and the ocean breeze \u2014 that 's what wiU make a man of you again, Morris. Well, we have to get there, you know ; steady 's the word \u2014 no hurry, but we '11 have to be looking about a start, presently.\" Mrs. Morris was grateful to the man for his cheeriness, for his efforts to keep alarm from her husband's mind, well knowing, all the time, how serious the cause for alarm was. She strove to be cheery, too ; but the effort was almost too much for her. At length, the time came when he could no longer trifle with the requirements of the position. \" We might be looking out for our start, now. It 's a half hour's walk, fairly, to the station \u2014 then there 's arrangements, seats, a compartment to yourselves if it can be secured.\" Finally they turned out, still under the cover of night, though day now showed some signs of breaking."], [431, "FROM THE TOMB 423 The way which the expert had so recently led Mrs. Morris from Kingsbridge was now retraced. Macnab himself went before ; the lately-restored husband and wife foUowed closely after him. About half way, an incident occurred which, whatever might he its effects on the nerves of the husband, certainly tried those of the wife to their utmost endurance. In the haU light, a figure emerged from the gloom, a little ahead of them \u2014 paused until Macnab came up with him. There was a quick interchange of words, and then the figure retired into the darkness again. For a moment, the woman had anticipated a midnight attack ; it even appeared to her that that was Macnab's first thought, too. But the two men met ; some half -audible words passed between them, and then there was only the three of them pursuing their way to the station. \"On the down journey.\" Yes, her ear had certainly caught these words. Then, Macnab's reply, \"Look alive, then.\" She must know what it meant. \" Tell me, Macnab. Is there any change ? \" \" One of our own men ; I told you we were doing all that can be done. Any change ? \u2014 well, perhaps.\" Mrs. Morris's nerves were not gone yet ; at least, her intelli gence was not. She fully understood that their dependence must now be placed upon the man and his uncontrolled arrangements. When they arrived at the station, intending passengers were already flocking in. Some of the seats were occupied by them ; others stood in groups on the platform ; some lounged on the platform seats ; in fact, it wanted a period, yet, to the time of starting. The expert recommended\u2014 nay, insisted on his com panions taking their seats in the train; they would thus be"], [432, "424 THE TURN OF THE TIDE least liable to observation. He, himself, would survey the coast around. To Mrs. Morris the advice appeared in every way com mendable, and she and her husband proceeded to act upon it. Macnab, too, she observed entering upon his survey \u2014 but, no, the fellow had merely shaken them off to have a quiet smoke by himself. Slowly and deliberately, he drew a pipe from some pocket ; then, even a more slow and deliberate investi gation produced a match. The latter he proceeded to ignite on the sole of his boot. Mrs. Morris heard the crack of the match ; she actually saw the ignition for a second \u2014 and, then, the flame went out. With a gesture of impatience \u2014 nay, an audible word of similar import, he flung the match from him, and proceeded on a new investigation for a fresh one ; but, no, research appeared unable to find another. Then, Macnab looked around him for help in his need. Ah ! there sat a man on a form, all by himself, awaiting the starting of the train. To him Macnab approached, and preferred his request. Certainly \u2014 another match was at his service. There was another investigation \u2014 a much more rapid one than Macnab's, and the desired match was extended toward him. But, no \u2014 Macnab did not seize the proffered match, but the hand which proffered it \u2014 and that with no delicate grasp, either. Strange, too, whUe all this was passing, another man \u2014 yes, certainly, the very man they had met haU-way on their journey to the station \u2014 had sidled up to the scene, and had now somehow got hold of the other hand and arm. There was a tussle, a stamping of feet, a rush of the other passengers around the scene, and she could see no more for the moment. Presently, Macnab came to the carriage door, looking even easier in his mind than he was before. \" Time 's up, and I '11 leave you to make the journey by"], [433, "FROM THE TOMB 425 yourselves. I was thinking of going down with you myself; so also was some one else, only he won't, now.\" \"That man, Macnab?\" \" Yes \u2014 he 's the party I 'in alluding to. You '11 find his berth on board empty ; he won't take his trip this time ; probably, he '11 take up his residence in Morris's late quarters, instead. Another poor cat's-paw \u2014 only, it 's the monkeys ought to be put there instead. Well, by -by ; I see you 're starting. You saved my life once, Mrs. Morris; we may never meet again ; but you'll recollect that this is something on account.\" Yes, the train had really started. With tearful eyes, Mrs. Morris could only see the platform as it receded from them. There stood the wretched man, who was to enter his living tomb. He was now handcuffed, but a guardian of the peace stdl stood on either side of him ; and in the hand of one of them was a revolver, evidently found in his possession. She did not wait to see any more. In a few minutes the train had taken them to green fields, woods, and the bright morning air. \" Dear me, what a melodramatic chapter ! \" we think we hear the reader say. WeU, dear reader, condemn, if you must \u2014 but, please, reflect, first.

WHAT Sister Mary had told her companion, Florence, as to the progress her patient, Captain Helmsley, was making, and would continue to make, was not quite all which had closed her last few days there, as well as in the country. She had told Captain Helmsley himself something more. In fact, she had made no delay, after the departure of her companion, in removing all uneasiness from the mind of the sick man as to the actual appearance of that young person at his bedside. \"Yes, dear \u2014 don't you mind Dr. QuUter, and let him go on with his paper. You did see Miss Hilton \u2014 and, please the pigs, you will see her again.\" \"Tell me all about it,\" the sick man had said \u2014 \"of course, I knew better than Quilter \u2014 only, things seemed mixed up.\" \" Of course, they did. Well, Macnab had something to do with that \u2014 you recoUect Macnab, don't you, dear ? \" The Captain had a sufficiently clear recollection of his trusty agent. \" He came down here, didn't he ? I don't quite remember what he did, then.\" \"No, you couldn't. Well, he traced Mrs. Hilton and her daughter until he found them. Then you got your nasty fall ; and, yes, poor Macnab was in a sad way. He came to me ; you know, I nursed him in hospital when he met his troubles. WeU, he came to me, and he said, ' Sister Mary ' \u2014 you 'U understand, I 'm called Sister Mary in the hospital, because \u2014 well, never mind, dear, but he said, 'Sister Mary, I'm in"], [436, "428 THE TURN OF THE TIDE a regular fix, now ' \u2014 it 's a way he had of talking, I don't know whether you can quite recollect that \u2014 and then he went on saying how he had traced the two ladies he was in search of, and how his employer \u2014 that's you, Captain \u2014 was very particular as to being let know. Well, then he says, ' I can't \u2014 it 's Captain Helmsley as met with the hunting accident a day or two ago.' ' That 's unfortunate,' I said \u2014 ' only, all parties will have to wait. I 'in going down to your Captain Helmsley \u2014 and, when he 's fit to be told, I 'U tell him you were as particular as himself as to your instructions.' Then, when I went to the station to come here, there was Miss Hilton waiting to come with me.\" We have already heard Sister Mary attempting one paraphrase of the interview between herself and Macnab, here referred to. We also know the account of the whole matter which it had been her intention to lay before this Macnab himself, which intention, like so many others, had never been carried out. The present was, perhaps, a different version from these two ; but, then, a certain bedside loquacity, or even an imperfect recoUection, might account for that. \" Poor fellow ! \" said the pleased patient \u2014 \" I suppose he thought he 'd lose them again. I certainly was particular with him on that point.\" \" Yes, dear, that 's it. I suppose he did \u2014 but that won't happen again. You have only got to get well now \u2014 and I will tell Mrs. Hilton that that will be soon.\" In the meantime, progress also was being made by some of the other persons of our story. Arthur Ogleby had to wait for his tea and his strawberries ; though, when he got them \u2014 or, perhaps, before \u2014 he had the satisfaction of knowing that the youngest of his daughters was now provided for, at least, as far as honest love and good intentions can make such provision. The rest remained with the young people them-"], [437, "CONCLUSION 429 selves. But before Charles Annesley and his bride commenced housekeeping in BaUinteer House they had a clear perception of their position, and of the elements on which their future success could alone depend. The estate had now reached its lowest ebb ; only by mutual indulgence and forbearance could landlord and tenant expect to resuscitate its abused resources ; after some years the prospect would improve for all parties. Dr. Quilter did not go on with that paper, after all ; though he and Sophy had several consultations over it. It all ended in Mr. and Mrs. Ogleby parting with their sole remaining daughter ; and, what with the flurry of a wedding and a honeymoon, acting on minds accustomed to more philosophic calmness, all other matters were laid aside and forgotten. It was in the nature of the case that Mount Ogleby should lose the society of its young people. Dr. Quilter had been now, for some time, in professional attendance at the Curragh ; and, about this period, he was in expectation of a summons elsewhere. In fact, there was only time for the wedding, which old Mr. Stackpoole insisted on taking part in, though his curate, the Rev. Mr. Potter, helped him through \u2014 and then the orders came. \" Of course, mamma, you could not expect all your daughters to marry around you,\" said Sophy, who did not allow her flurry to get the better of her. \" You had Fanny, and now you will have Kate with you \u2014 or, at least, near you.\" \"Yes, dear,\" said her mother, who did not think it un becoming to exhibit a few tears, \"I ought to be thankful; still, it is a break.\" And of Mr. and Mrs. Ogleby? Certainly, it was a break in the household; and though Fanny was on one side, and Kate on the other, and both within easy distance, the Mount could never be quite the same. The two couples frequently paid their visits to the old home, which as frequently were"], [438, "430 THE TURN OF THE TIDE returned. But when, on subsequent occasions, Mrs. Ogleby repeated her expressions of thankfulness for the settlement of her daughters, the tears were never very far behind. That long - negotiated, oft -deferred arrangement on the Mangerton estate did at length come to pass, and Mrs. Hilton got back her money again, with the interest added to it. Lord Mangerton retired from the ownership altogether ; no other settlement was now possible. The mischief-makers had wrecked everything, the interests of the unfortunate tenants more especially, and nothing remained save the introduction of fresh capital. In this way, Mrs. Hilton came by her own, and had the satisfaction of seeing her daughter not entirely dowerless, when sought in marriage by Captain Helmsley. Not, indeed, that dower was asked, or even necessary. Old Mr. Helmsley had been long failing, and, about this time, succumbed to his years and infirmities. Thus the young man found himself head of his house, and owner of Helmsley Hall, to which he returned with his bride. Mrs. Morris and her husband reached Australia in safety, hut we are not at liberty to name the precise dependency in that country where their lot is now fixed. As a matter of precau tion the husband changed his name, and has now settled down to that quiet and peaceful industry on which success and happi ness must alone depend. But another, and a more restless, spirit has long been abroad, nor can we hope that its angry and vindictive passions have yet worn themselves out. And this brings us to Father Doyle, of whom a closing word remains to be said. All justice to the man who had the courage of his convictions \u2014 who condemned when it meant social ostra cism, invective, and misrepresentation. He has led the way \u2014 may his order consider whether it is not the better way ! THE END."], [439, ""], [440, ""], [441, ""], [442, ""]]
