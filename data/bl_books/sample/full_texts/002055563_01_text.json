JLN the Work now committed to the indul- gence of the public, the Author does not pro- fess to relate any thing new, regarding the events of the late Mahratta War, which are already sufficiently known, through the me- dium of the different histories of it, that have been published: his object has been to present, in detail, particular operations, which the nature of those histories has obliged their Authors to treat in a cursory manner, but of which, as forming a most important branch of the war, it is essential that an account should be given ; not only as a record of the past, but as it may also be made a land-mark for the future. It is with this view, that he has added to the journals of the different sieges, a few remarks upon the operations carried on, and that he has treated the whole subject at large, in his preliminary and concluding Chapters. In the former of these, the Author has hazarded some observa tions and reflections on the Native Fortresses A"], [28, "II PREFACE. of India, between which and the Fortresses of Europe, he has endeavoured to draw a com parison. In the concluding Chapter, he has considered the best method of attack, and the means at present possessed by the Engineer Department, for carrying such a system into execution, and he has done so in hopes, that whatever objections may be raised to that sys tem, and however defective it may be, the dis cussion will be of use, in drawing more atten tion to the subject, and that it may aid in giving a more decided and energetic shape to our future siege operations. It was the Author's original intention to have included in this Work, the sieges which took place under the other Presidencies, and an application was accordingly made for the ac counts of those carried on by the Bengal army, from a quarter which he hoped would have met attention ; but in this he was disappointed: and he has therefore unwillingly been obliged to confine himself to the sieges undertaken by the Madras Divisions. It may be observed, that an official Journal of every operation of the kind, containing each day's work, as entered at the time, was kept, wherever an Engineer Officer of the Madras Establishment was pre sent, and transmitted with the Plans, &c. to the chief Engineer's Office. The liberal access to these, which has been granted to him by the"], [29, "PREFACE. III Madras Government, and which has afforded him every opportunity and information he could desire, demands his warmest acknowledge ments. The Journals therefore, from which the following have been taken, are all official, and he has strictly followed them, except in one or two instances, where having been present himself, and having taken memoranda on the spot, he has viewed the operations in a different light. These deviations, which however are very few, are remarked in the notes. The ac counts of the sieges, at which there was no En gineer Officer present, have been extracted from Lieut.Col. Blacker's Memoir*, to which he is also indebted for much valuable information, regard ing the strength of the different Corps, and the general movements of the Divisions and Troops, although these, it may be observed, are only noticed, so far as they are connected with the object of the present work. There are one or two instances, in which the Author has found himself obliged to dissent from the conclusions drawn by that distinguished Officer ; and this difference of opinion is only noticed, that he may at the same time mention, that it is offered with diffidence. The Plans of the Forts, at the sieges of which Engineer Officers were present, were executed by them, and the Views, which * Of the operations of the British Army in India, during the Mahratta War of 1817, 1818 and 1819.

The Author thinks it right to mention, that his Work has been considerably delayed, in consequence of the difficulty he experienced, in obtaining the information necessary for combining the journ als of the several sieges into a connected Nar rative. Having thus stated his authorities for the facts recorded in the following Work, none of which are brought forward as such, but what he either knows or firmly believes to be true, it only remains to say a few words on the opinions the Author has expressed, regarding the ineffi ciency of the Engineer Department, and of the improvements he considers necessary in con sequence. These opinions have been honestly formed, after long reflection, and he has been strengthened in them by knowing, that they are the unanimous sentiments of his Brother Offi cers, and that they all join with him, in an anxious wish, to see the Corps to which they have the honor to belong, placed on a footing of equal efficiency with the rest of the Army. He has expressed himself with confidence, because from the anxiety which the Court of Directors have always shown, to have this branch of their Army equal to the performance"], [31, "PR El-' ACE. V of its duties, and the liberality with which they enable their Engineer Officers to perfect them selves in their profession, he is certain, that it is only necessary that these defects should be clearly pointed out, in order that they may be immediately remedied. He is aware, that part of the system of attack he has laid down may be opeu to objection, but he trusts that the princi ple on which it is grounded will be acknow ledged to be correct, and therefore, that the whole will be indulgently received. The Author has great pleasure in publicly acknowledging the assistance he has received from all his Brother Officers, who have had it ,jn their power to forward his present object, and in particular he must express the obliga- tions he is under to the late Captain Coventry, and to Captain Anderson, of the Engineers, who have provided him with much valuable information on different points, since the com- mencement of his undertaking, and of whose advice he has largely availed himself. Whatever opinion may be formed of the pre sent Work, the Author trusts, that the motive, which induced him to undertake it, will be considered praiseworthy. It was an ardent desire to see the Army, he feels it a pride to belong to, as distinguished in one branch of warfare as another ; as victorious, when set down before the strongest Forts of the' Natives,"], [32, "PREFACE. VI as they have always been, when charging the most overwhelming Battery on the plain; and his anxiety is increased by a conviction, that the deficiency in the Department to which he be longs, has been the only obstacle to this de sirable object. He regrets that the subject has not fallen into hands (of which in his own Corps there are many) who would have done it more justice, but it is to be hoped, that so good a cause will not suffer from the weakness of the advocate. He has only to observe in conclu sion, that as this Work would not have been undertaken, but for the kind and flattering assurances of the distinguished Officer, under whose command he was then serving, so would it never have seen the light, but for the encou ragement received from him and other Friends, whose opinion in favour of it may, he fears, have been too much biassed by feelings of per sonal regard towards the Author.

THE Author of this short work, although young in his profession, has had some expe- rience himself, and has always been anxious to profit by that of others. A strong sense of the benefit, he would have derived, even from such a collection, as that, which he has now been able to make, first suggested to him the idea, that his leisure hours might be well employed, in endeavouring to give that advantage to others, which he had so often regretted not possessing himself.

But he has said enough : his subject is fortunately one, Avhich demands conciseness, and would be injured by an attempt at fine composition, to which he is unequal. He proceeds therefore directly to his task. The variety of construction in the Fortresses of India, the character of the Garrisons, some times bold, obstinate, and enthusiastically brave, at other times timid, irresolute, aud dis heartened by trifling reverses, together with our own frequently imperfect means of attack, are circumstances, which have constantly obliged us to depart from the established rules laid down for the attack of fortified places ; and are the causes that our Siege History in this country so often exhibits results, different from what would be calculated upon, by those who are only accustomed to the regularity of this warfare, as carried on in Europe. The Science of Fortification is here almost in its infancy. With the exception of those built by ourselves, or by other European Powers, who have at different times obtained a footino- in India, and of a few, belonging to Native Princes, which have been constructed, or im proved, by European Engineers in their service,"], [35, "INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 9 the Forts in India, are nearly what places of CHAP. defence were in Europe, four centuries ago ; k^P^, and, therefore, a brief review of the rise and progress of the art of Fortification, in the latter quarter of the Globe, may serve 'to illustrate the comparison I wish to make, between Indian and European Fortresses, so far as regards their relative strength at the present moment. In periods of remote antiquity, when the means of attack were as rude as the defences which they were meant to destroy, a town sur rounded by high walls, gave its inhabitants ample security against an enemy ; but when some degree of science was introduced in the attack, these defences were of little avail, and an improvement was found necessary. The first step towards it was the addition of round or square towers, to the angles and other parts of the walls ; but these towers, though they commanded the enemy's approaches while at a certain distance, ceased to be of use when he reached the ground at their base, which they left undefended, except by the uncertain fire of small arms through loop-holes. They therefore gave place, after the introduction of artillery, first to Redans, and afterwards to Bastions, which by establishing a flanking fire remedied this defect ; but which were at first made very small, and generally at a great dis tance from each other, and were therefore unable"], [36, "10 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP I. long to resist with success the rapidly improv ing science of attack. Indeed, neither the size, nor relative position of these works were regu lated by any established rules, but frequently depended on the caprice of the individual, by whom they were erected, until in process of time, the different Continental nations adopted peculiar systems of their own, all differing from each other, and all more or less defective. Such was the state of Fortification in Europe, in the middle of the seventeenth century, when Pagan undertook, in a Treatise published in 1645, to reduce to order these various and opposite theories, and to free them from the errors and intricacies with which they abound ed ; and it was not until this period, when he laid down on sound principles, certain rules for the dimensions and relative position of the different parts of a Fortress, that Fortification could be said to have become a science. Since that period, such great and rapid improve ments have taken place in this art, that it may now be allowed to have reached a very high de gree of excellence, although no method has yet been discovered of rendering a fortress im pregnable. The natives of India have made but little pro gress towards this perfection. They do not seem to be aware of the importance of that maxim, which is the ground-work of European"], [37, "It CHAP. I. INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. Fortification, namely, \" that every work of a Fortress should be defended or flanked by some other.\" Their system, if such it can be called, is that of a simple inclosure, consisting of a continued wall, with round towers at in tervals, the defects of which have already been noticed. There appear to be no determined rules for the profiles of these works, nor for the distances to be preserved between the seve ral towers ; which particulars vary so much, in almost every Fort, that it would be impossible to attempt to fix a standard for either. Such are the works, by which almost every village in India is protected, but to some of their more important places, they have added one and sometimes two ditches, together with outworks, which render regular approaches necessary. The great depth of these ditches might consti tute an obstacle, not to be overcome without some difficulty, were not this advantage in a great measure neutralized, from the circumstance of the bottom generally containing dead ground close to the scarp, to which the besiegers, after having made their descent into the ditch, may therefore attach their miners with perfect safety. But defective as the Forts of India are in their construction, and inferior as they are to those of Europe, it is far from my intention to represent them as contemptible.

There are no traces of the Indians having ever constructed Fortifications different from those of the present day, and as they are in all things the slaves of custom, it would perhaps be no easy matter to induce them to alter a method, sanctioned by the practice of their forefathers : but the successful, or at least, pro longed defences, which their Forts have almost always made against native attacks, and some times even when assailed by Europeans, pos sessed of superior science and equipments, afford a better and more probable reason for their reluctance to change ; and these would almost warrant the fallacious conclusion, that they need no improvement, were it not, that we have sometimes called forth all our energies, and by the speedy capture of the most esteem ed native Fortresses in India, have proved how unequal they are to their object.* It is to be - These energies, however, it must be observed, have generally been displayed, not in the scientific, but in the overwhelming character of our attacks, and we seem in these very instances to have acknowledged the superior con struction of the Native Forts, and to have admitted our inability to take them in the usual method, by bringing"], [39, "1:1 CHAP I.

This remark is more particularly applicable to Hatrass, of which the reduc tion was literally effected in this way ; but it would be impos sible (putting aside all considerations of the expense attending such a method of attack) to bring a train, such as was dis played there, against every other fort which was disposed to resist us ; and the Natives of India have fair ground to sup pose, that without the aid of such a train, we are unable to reduce them. There cannot be a doubt, but that this idea prevails to a certain extent, and it is a general opinion, that, however superior w\u00ab are to them on the plain, we are only on an equality when we have walls to attack ; and our repulses at Bhurtpoor, are to this day brought forward, as a proof of our inferiority in this branch of war.

The Native method of carrying on such operations, if briefly stated, may, however, be interesting, as it will show how completely in this, as in other countries, the arts of attack and defence have kept pace with each other, in their general efficiency. The Natives appear to be utterly ignorant of the advantage to be derived from attacking a salient angle, and of the art of conducting ap proaches by Sap ; and, generally speaking, they are also unacquainted with Mining. When one of their armies sits down before a place, the ob ject appears rather to be to harrass the besieged, and weary them out by a strict blockade, than to effect an entrance by breaching the walls : for although guns are used, they are placed at such a distance from the town, out of musket shot, and not always in battery, that their effect is uncertain, and even this desultory fire is only kept up at intervals during the day; for at night, to guard against the consequences of a sally, the guns are always withdrawn to the camp; and this ridiculous process is continued till the besieged are tired out, and a compromise"], [41, "INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 15 CHAP I. is entered into.* The Natives of Hindostan, however, of a particular cast, are said to be * An amusing account of the siege of Doonee, a small fort, garrisoned by two or three hundred Rajpoots, which resisted successfully for upwards of a month, the ut most efforts of Dowlut Row Sindiah, backed by a numerous artillery, and an overwhelming force, is given in \" Broughton's Letters from a Mahratta Camp.\" At the commencement of the siege, the operations were under the direction of Baptiste, who commenced a mine, and as there was no gun in the place, established posts round it within musket shot : but Baptiste being ordered away on some other duty, the mine was abandoned. After this the garrison made several sallies, in one of which they succeeded in carrying off into the fort two guns : after which, to avoid a similar accident, the be siegers withdrew their guns every night from their batteries. When the shot at length began to tell on the walls, and to destroy more than the garrison could build up at night, they commenced a ditch on that side, and carried it on in the face of, and in despite of the besiegers. This creditable defence was at last brought to a close, in the usual way, by a composi tion being entered into with the besiegers. The siege of Darwar, in 1797, is too well known to require recapitulation, and the following account of the siege of Beescondah, a town surrounded by a wretched mud wall, situated in the Nizam's dominions, and attacked by a part of the Prince's force, and related in the words in which it was given to the author, by a friend who happened to be an eye-witness of the commence ment, will well complete this picture of Native attacks. \" The \" besieging army consisted principally of horse, and about \" four guns, and arrived before the place the same day on \" which we were passing it, in January, 1815.

Hyder and Tippoo had French Engineers in their service, by whom their sieges were generally conducted, but when this was not the case, the same ridiculous and impotent mode' of proceeding, that has been described, was followed by them. But to return to the subject : It is evident \" about 50 yards asunder. The besiegers' camp was placed \" in low ground some distance in rear.

These means were formerly as much neglected in England, as they have been in our Eastern possessions, so that whenever we came in collision with the Continental Powers, our inferiority in this branch was severely felt. During the Peninsular campaigns, the inefficiency of a body of officers, when un assisted by men trained to siege duties, was more fully displayed ; and in consequence of the representations of the Duke of Wellington, a Corps was raised, and an Establishment formed for their instruction, under the super intendance of one of the ablest and most distin guished officers in the Royal Engineers. By the excellent system pursued at this Institution at Chatham, every man is made practically acquainted with the nature of his duties, before he is sent abroad, and the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners now certainly yields to none of the older established ones, of the same nature, in other services, either in science, or in any other requisite for soldiers of this descrip tion. B"], [44, "18 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP I. The Directors of the East India Company are not ignorant of the advantages that would be derived, from having this branch of their army on a more efficient footing, than it has hitherto been ; for of late years all their Officers of Engineers, before leaving England, have been placed under the orders of the Officer above alluded to, in order that they may be more fully instructed in that part of their duty, which relates to the attack of places ; and re cently a few recruits, trained at Chatham, have been sent out to Bengal, where a permanent Corps of Sappers and Miners has been raised, and a large increase made to the Engineer Corps. The sister Presidencies have not, as yet, shared in these benefits, although the prin ciple has been established, and the necessity of improvement (in time of war at least) acknow ledged ; for, during the last campaign in the Deckan, Lieutenant Davies, the Senior En gineer of the Madras Establishment, with Sir Thomas Hislop's army, was allowed (as a tem porary measure) to recruit 30 Europeans, and 50 Pioneers, for this Service, who were deno minated Sappers and Miners.

It is but too common a feeling, to ascribe a failure against a Fort, to want of skill in the Engineer, who conducts the operations ; but let it be remembered, that in his plan of attack, not only the quantity of stores neces sary, but also the qualifications and skill of the men who are to act under his orders, must be taken into account ; and, from a deficiency in both, we have frequently been obliged to remain and breach at a distance, when we ought to have been at the foot of our enemy's walls. It is surely no argument, that because these Forts are rude, we should not employ against them the greatest science, and every means in our power ; that because our successes have hitherto been as numerous as our reverses, we should be content with this mediocrity of for tune ; and should continue to incur the risk of adding to our failures, by a neglect of means, which would insure a certain and successful result to all our siege operations ; and finally, that we should hazard, before every petty place we attack, our reputation, and the lives of our soldiers, upon the chance of the Garrison not possessing a due degree of courage and resolu tion.

These people have been so often and so well described by different writers, that it is need- less, nor would it indeed be within the scope of the present AVork, to enter into a particular account of their rise and origin. It may be observed of them in a few words, that almost from time immemorial, they have been attached as a distinct class to Native Armies, which they have followed, without receiving pay, or being actuated by patriotism (the general in- ducements of people to become soldiers), and that they have been so far from wishing to be distinguished for their prowess as fighting men, that they have never soughtevenforplunder.their sole occupation, but where it could be obtained without danger.

To crush them the whole energy of that power was put forth, and had the Pindarries stood alone and unassisted in the contest, there would have been little to record, but their efforts on the one hand, to escape from the net, which we had drawn round them, and our combinations and endeavours to enclose them on the other. But the opportunity which was thus offered to the Native Princes was too favourable to be neglected. By the destruction of the Pindarries the British supremacy would"], [50, "24 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY.

This combination, to which all the Mahratta powers subscribed, had then for its object to free themselves from the bondage of the British yoke, and to assert and maintain the Mahratta independence. An Englishman's heart, though the interests of his country would suffer by their success, must pronounce their object a legitimate one, and their struggle for indepen dence praiseworthy, but not so the means which they employed to further it: these would convey disgrace to the worthiest cause, and must meet with universal and unqualified con demnation. It is difficult indeed, to imagine a .scene of greater treachery and duplicity, than was ex hibited in all the Native Courts, up to the very moment when they threw off the mask of friend ship, by which they had endeavoured to deceive our residents, and under which they had hoped to conceal their enmity.

The Battering Train with the fourth division and reserve, consisted of six 18 pounders, the same number of 12-pounders, besides heavy mortars and howitzers, and the Engineer Park was also tolerably supplied. The want of Engineer Soldiers at the opening of the campaign, and the steps which were taken to obviate this evil, by embodying a few Eu ropeans and Native Pioneers, havebeen detailed in the preliminary Chapter ; but it may not be amiss to repeat here, that the Europeans knew nothing of the duties they were thus suddenly called on to perform, and that the Natives, although accustomed to work, were as ignorant of every branch of Engineering as the Europeans.

As there were no Pontoons, and no timber for forming the superstructure of a bridge, if it had been attempted to construct one with the common country boats, which were to be pro cured on the river, a flying bridge was the only resource, and this was effected by drawing a strong sheerline across the river, along which the boats plied.

At the same time, the cavalry and right brigade were to attack the enemy's left, on which their horse were posted, and the cavalry were also to try to gain the Succaderry tank, in order to attack the enemy in flank and rear. This plap, however, was not carried into execu tion, for on the 16th the enemy abandoned this ground, with the exception of the Arsenal and 14-gun Battery, of which they still retained possession, and occupied a much weaker posi tion with their right on the NagNuddee, a small stream which runs to the South of the City, hav ing the Succaderry garden and tank in their front.

Of these the most important is the old Palace, an extensive square work flank ed with towers, and of a considerable height. It is situated towards the S. W. angle of the city, at a distance of about 250 yards from either the South or West side ; and as from its central po sition, and superior height, it in some degree commands the whole city, it necessarily became the object of our attack. From the foregoing description of its situation, and the extent of the suburbs around it, the choice of the direc tion of the attack evidently lay between the South and West sides. On the former, immediately outside of the unfinished wall, the Toolsee Baug, an inclosure with some strong buildings, which could be easily gained, would afford considerable facility to an attack ; but from that point the advance would be difficult, through narrow winding streets, defended by a number of strong houses on both sides, and it would be previously ne cessary to carry the Grand Fort (marked O), an old Citadel capable of defence, which flanks the right of any approach directed on the Palace from this quarter.

Seetabuldee hill to the suburbs on the West side of the city, is in shape nearly a parallelo gram, about 1300 yards long and 500 wide. The banks or bunds, formed of masonry and earth, are sufficiently high to afford cover to troops, especially on the city side, where they command the whole intermediate space between the Tank and the Palace. The principal and widest street in the city runs immediately from the East bund to the Palace, and at about 350 yards from the former, passes through an arched gateway of brick, called the Jooma Durwasee, which is situated immediately behind the city wall, in a portion of an old rampart which remains complete. The main street, leading through this gateway, is bordered only by low shops, and affords a comparatively easy access. This side was therefore considered the most eligible for the attack, although it would be necessary to breach and occupy the Jooma Durwasee, which intervened between the bund and the Palace.

The Jooma Durwasee being breached, it was pro posed to make a lodgment on its ruins, and in the walls and houses on either side, and from thence to batter the Palace. This edifice once in our hands would in all probability oblige the enemy to evacuate the city ; but in the event of their persevering to hold posses sion of any other principal buildings, it would then become necessary to reduce them by bombardment, or by breaching, according to arrangements to be subsequently formed, the information regarding the interior of the city being only sufficient for the formation of a plan to gain possession of the Palace. All the bat tering train, except a few howitzers, having been thrown into Ellichipoor; on the rapid ad vance of the Division from that place, a certain number of the enemy's guns, taken on the 16th, were selected for the operations about to com mence.

REFLECTIONS. The failure before the open city of Nagpoor has given rise to great discussion, and the wis dom of the operations pursued has been much called in question, but it is to be apprehended, that these doubts have originated solely in the bad success which attended it, and not in any due examination of the merits or demerits of the plan. The principal reasons, which induced the Commanding Engineer to propose the West side for the direction of the attack, in preference to approaching by the low ground which sur rounds the rest of the city, were\u2014 1st. The excellent approach offered by the bund (or embankment) of the Tank, which afforded na tural cover to within 550 yards of the Palace. 2nd. That owing to the superior height of the bund, the houses between our trenches and the city wall would be rendered untenable by the Garrison. 3rd. That the first batteries could be easily constructed by merely cutting embra sures through the bund ; a consideration which, in the imperfect state of the Engineer Depart ment, was of no small importance. There is no doubt that the Palace was the object to be gained, not only as the principal post, but as the easiest to be assailed, and if the propriety of opening trenches against it be conceded, the above considerations must appear conclusive,"], [71, "ATTACK OF NAGPOOR. 45 as to the superior advantages offered by an ap- CHAP. proach on the West side ; but it is against an ulterior part of the plan, that the strongest ob- |81~ jections have been urged, and one writer, of deservedly high authority, has not scrupled to assert, not only that the occupation of the Joo ma Durwasee was injudicious, but that it was undertaken against the Commanding General's better judgment, at the earnest solicitations of his Engineer. The first part of the question, as to the propriety or otherwise of the measure, affords reasonable matter for argument, but we may pass over the latter, as a gratuitous asser tion, in direct contradiction to the tenour of the General's public dispatches, and which, even if founded on fact, could only tend to prejudice the fair investigation of the subject. Lieut. -Colonel Blacker, the author to whom Lieut coi. I allude, and who has bestowed upon the attack strictures on the Jooma Durwasee his most unqualified of attack\" censure, appears to honour with his approba- notlced tion the previous operation of occupying the bund of the Tank, and also the ulterior object of obtaining possession of the Palace.

CHAP II. 1817 approved by Colonel Blacker himself. He has not favoured his readers by explaining what he himself would have suggested in preference to the mode of attack actually attempted ; but it is evident, that after the bund was occupied with a view to operations against the Palace, it would have been the height of absurdity to have remained idle and inactive in the former position. In fact, after having beaten the enemy's army in the field, General Doveton had only one alternative : either to wait until the whole of his battering train and Engineer stores were brought up, which would have occasioned a delay of at least fifteen days ; or to commence an immediate attack with the im perfect means he had upon the spot. He chose the latter, in preference, as the more vigorous measure, and after having made this decision, he could not, with any degree of consistency, have acted otherwise than he did. To recapitulate, and state more in detail, the reasons in favour of the attack on the Jooma Durwasee, they were as follows :\u2014 1st. It was the only spot, from whence the bottom of the walls of the Palace could be distinctly seen, as at every other part a large mass of houses in tervenes, without previously levelling which, it would have been impossible to effect a prac ticable breach. 2nd. There were no large buildings in front of the Jooma Durwasee,"], [73, "ATTACK OF NAGPOOR. 47 sufficiently near to it, from whence our troops, CHAP. after occupying that work, and lodging them- n selves also on the right and left of it, could have ,g,~ been annoyed by the enemy. 3rd. The esta blishment on the Jooma Durwasee could be made under the protection of our battery and trenches on the bund of the Tank. It has been asserted, on the other hand, that even had the assault on that position succeeded, the troops would have found no cover, but at the gateway, a very confined space, and within the city walls. But it has been forgotten by those, who urge this objection, that the space between the bund and the gateway was a su burb composed of low mud houses, every one of which would have afforded cover; that this suburb extended on both sides of the road suf ficiently to lodge the whole Division, had it been thought advisable to occupy it; and that the low wall of the city itself, not eight feet high, was excellent cover, and could easily have been improved, so as to answer every purpose of a parallel.* * The friends of Lieut.-Colonel Blacker, and of Lieut. Davies, the Commanding- Engineer before Nagpoor, who was killed next year in the execution of his duty, must equally lament, that the former, in stating his objections to the plan of attack now under discussion, should have ex pressed himself in language by no means respectful to the memory of the latter. Whilst he acknowledges some of"], [74, "48 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP Hi 1817 Remarks on the execution of the plan of attack. The foregoing considerations will possibly lead to the conclusion, that the general plan was the most judicious, perhaps the only one that could be adopted. To some of the details objections might be raised. The utility of the lodgement made on the first day (at a), might be called in question ; and the time which was spent on this operation, might perhaps have been better employed, by occupying at once the East bund of the Tank. Another arrange ment of the storming party might have led to a different result. The leading men should have been directed to occupy, and obtain cover in the houses between our trenches and the gate way, and to the right and left of the latter ; and the storming party would then have been better supported, and even if repulsed, much ground those high military qualities, by which Lieut. Davies was dis tinguished, he applies to him the epithet \" petulant,\" on an occasion, and in a manner, which to the general reader, un acquainted with either of the parties, will probably appear unworthy of the dignity of Military history. Lieut. Davies certainly possessed great firmness and decision; and when called upon as the Commanding Engineer of the Division, to give his opinion on points of duty, he did so with that plain dealing and energy, which characterised his manly and ar dent mind ; but assuredly no man was less deserving of the implied reproach of want of temper or of manner, which Col. Blacker has thus gratuitously thrown out against him, and which no doubt that distinguished Officer will be glad to cancel, for his own credit, if a second edition of his useful work should be required."], [75, "49 ATTACK OF NAGPOOR. CHAP II. 1817 would still have been gained. The party of Europeans should have been stronger, and they should have been fresh men. The company employed had been on duty twenty-four hours, and had been exposed during the whole of a cold night, in wet trenches, to a heavy rain ; and these two circumstances, their small num ber, and the fatigue they had undergone, will perhaps be thought more naturally to account for their backwardness, than the reason assign ed by Colonel Blacker, that \" they saw no \" advantage to be obtained,\" in going forward ; a feeling fortunately little known to British troops, and which if a common one, would oblige a General, before he attempted any ma n\u0153uvre, to submit the propriety of it, to the wisdom of his army for their decision. The misbehaviour of the Europeans on this occasion may be thought a delicate subject, and it would be so, if the reputation of one of the most dis tinguished Regiments in the service could be supposed to suffer, by the misconduct of a few of their number ; and if that misconduct had not been nobly redeemed by the gallantry of their leader, which called forth from his enemies the highest encomiums, and to which they paid the only homage in their power, that of sending out a flag of truce, that his remains left in the inside of the breach might be carried away.

The defence they made would have done credit to European troops, and, but in one instance, do they appear to have neglected taking every advantage which the nature of their position afforded them ; they might have retarded our occupation of the East bund of the Tank, which they allowed us to intrench, almost without opposition. These reflections on the conduct of the siege of Nagpoor, cannot be closed better than by the following extract from a letter from Brigadier- General Doveton, to the Adjutant-General of the army.

Both of these places are formidable from their situation, and the former was always considered impregnable by the Natives, till it was taken by storm by the English Army under Colonel Wellesley, in the Mahratta war of 1802; and this doubtless was the cause of the ready obedience which was paid to the Rajah's order for their surrender, of which Brigadier- -General Doveton was the bearer. After occupying these places, and some others on the plain, which belonged to the Rajah, and which at first shewed symp toms of resistance, the Division entered Khan desh, and reached Ootran, a place in that province, in the middle of February, where they remained to await the approach of the first Division, with which a junction was to be formed. The first and third Divisions, it is almost unnecessary to relate, had crossed the Ner buddah, and entered Malwa, the latter in the middle of November, and the former in the beginning of December, 1817, and shortly afterwards the combined Divisions encountered and defeated the Army of Mulhar Row Holkar at Mahidpoor.

The entrance is on the East side, of difficult access, having several traverses of mud and masonry, and five gates. The huts of the town approach to within musket shot of the walls.

This operation offers little subject for pro fessional reflections. The Fort of Talneir is of trifling strength, owing to the brokenness of the ground around it, which affords cover in every direction, and on the side of the river, up to the very walls of the Fort; and with this defect, it could make little defence against a regular attack with sufficient means. Its principal strength lies in the construction of the interior"], [82, "56 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP, of the Fort, which (as is often the case with *-\u25a0, places similarly situated), is a solid mass of 181g earth, much higher than the surrounding coun- try; upon which, the rampart and parapet, perhaps 1 1 feet high, are raised, and these are the only parts not solid ; so that in battering the exterior walls, which are 60 feet high, the shot would bury themselves in an enormous mound of earth. But this would have been no obstacle against Mining, and thismethod, which would have been as expeditious as the one pur sued, might have been tried on the present oc casion, but, there being neither a Miner, nor a mining tool in the Division, nor even a scaling ladder, there was no resource but to attempt an entrance by the gateways. Like most of the Forts in this part of India, the gateway was the see Plate strongest part, and (as will be seen by reference to the plan of it) considerable pains had been bestowed, and apparently with great success, on preserving a proper flanking defence on the different passages ; and if the gateway had been defended with the usual obstinacy and resolution of the Arabs, it seems doubtful how far a passage could have been forced through the four inner ones, even after the outer gate _ . had been battered down.

On the justice of the sentence passed on the Killedar and his Arab Commander, and on our right to inflict it, were I qualified to pass an opinion, I should feel little disposed to do so ; but I may be permitted to deplore, in common with all friends of humanity, that some Ambassador more polished than a British Grenadier, and one acquainted with the language and customs of the Arabs, had not preceded the storming party, to explain to them the terms on which they were to be admitted to quarter, and to prevent the possibility of such an affray as that which took place, and the loss of lives that necessarily resulted from it.

It is of irregular form, being about 1000 yards in its greatest length, and 800 in extreme width. It is of great strength, particularly on the North front, na ture having rendered it nearly inaccessible in almost every point.

As is generally the case with similar For-"], [91, "ATTACK OF BELGAUM. 65 tresses, there remained to the Engineer no CHAP. choice as to the point to be attacked, and the yjjrr, positions of the batteries, alonerequired the exer- jgjg cise of professional talents. These appear to have been well selected, and fortunately our fire had the effect of intimidating the Garrison. Had they shown more resolution, they might have detained us much longer, but the defence they made was unworthy of the name. While part of the Reserve Division was thus Opera- tions of occupied, the remainder of it, commanded by Brigadier- .

The attack of Badaumee may, in particular, be noticed as a remarkable instance of the effect produced by the bravery and resolution of our troops, in intimidating their enemy, when occu pying an impregnable position.

On arriving before the place, the Pettah was occupied, and the Fort reconnoitred. Its shape is an irregular oval, in circumference about 2600 yards ; its greatest length being about 900yards, from the Flag-staff Bastion to the Southward. It is surrounded by a deep wet ditch, and a regular sloping glacis, with a clear esplanade around it of 600 yards. The Engineer, by whom the Fort was built, has, apparently, trusted entirely to the ditch for the defence of the East and West fronts, for the greater part of them has been left without any round towers, which are only placed on the North and South fronts; in the former of which is the gateway. The other defences of the Fort consist of two or three cavaliers, prepared for batteries; one of which is at the North-West angle behind the Flag-staff Bastion, and has apparently been placed there for the further protection of the * In one place Colonel Blacker mentions two 18-pounders as the complement, but in his subsequent remarks he says, \" the three iron 18-pounders were so run in the vent, &c.\" I have adopted the former, as this agrees with the number staled to have been in batt-ery."], [93, "ATTACK OF BELGAUM. 67 CHAP III. 1818. PlateVII, entrance into the Fort, which is situated near the North-East angle. There are three gate ways, which, after the Fort was taken, were found to have been built up, and barricaded. Between the inner and middle gateways, there is a narrow causeway across the ditch, protect ed by a small outwork, with a tolerably thick rampart, and a dry ditch and glacis in front of it. The Pettah lies opposite to the West front of the Fort, but extends some distance to the Northward, where are the remains of an old wall, which, after covering part of the Pettah on that side, takes a South-Easterly direction, and terminates on the glacis of the Fort, oppo site to the Flag-staff Bastion. The garrison consisted of 1600 men. The works were well supplied with ordnance and stores, and the walls, which are very substantially built of granite, and which vary from 35 to 60 feet in height, were in good repair. March 20th. A battery for 3 twelve-pounders was com menced near a mosque, opposite to the North face, about 900 yards distant from the Fort, and in order to create a diversion, a five-and-a half-inch mortar, and a six-pounder, opened from the Pettah.

D wring the night, an enfilading battery (b) was completed, situated in the Pettah, about 600 yards from the Flag-staff Bastion, for the purpose of enfilading the North face and gate way. A gun opened on it from the cavalier behind the Flag-staff Bastion, and the fire of the battery (a), was returned from the curtain on the left of the gate. March 24th.

The foregoing account of the Siege of Bel gaum has been extracted from Colonel Blacker's Memoir, and before commencing the reflections which I am about to offer on it, I must be allowed to join in the full tribute of praise, which that officer has paid to the zeal and per severance, with which the attack was carried on, and all the obstacles arising from inefficient means surmounted ; and if in the spirit of im partial investigation, which in these discussions it has been my endeavour to pursue, some objections should arise to the general details of the works carried on, and to the spot selected for the breach, they will be urged rather to show, what might have been done with a well organized department, than to call in question the abilities of the distinguished and respectable officer* who, in the absence of an Engineer, directed the attack. The first point to which the attention is di rected, on an examination of the Plan, is the * Lieutenant-Colonel Newall of the Madras Infantry."], [98, "72 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP III. 1818 number of batteries, which appear to have been somewhat needlessly accumulated ; and some of them, if we may judge by their effect as de tailed in the Journal, apparently at too great a distance to have made the desired impression on the works. This remark is particularly applicable to the batteries, marked a and c, which might perhaps have been dispensed with, and the guns in them placed more advantage ously at once, in battery at d and e. The position for the battery at b, was most judi ciously chosen, but it might have had still more effect in enfilading the North front, if it had been placed a little to the right, in the pro longation of the general line of that front. The direction of the trenches, marked f f f, was probably regulated by some localities, with which the Plan does not make us acquainted ; and it is therefore suggested with diffidence, that if a trench had been made from b to e, connecting these two points, instead of following the line fff, represented in the Plan, 200 yards of trench work would have been saved, and the garrison would have been more effectually con fined ; or a part of the old Pettah wall, to the Northward, marked in the Plan 7 8, might have been converted into a parallel, and the only trench necessary would then have been from 8 to e, which would have reduced the"], [99, "ATTACK OF BELGAUM. 73 CHAP III. 1818, quantity to 400 yards, instead of 750 yards* actually executed. If it was intended to carry on any sap in ad vance of e, from whence to assault the breach, the breaching battery was established too soon, as the enemy might, in the time which it would have required to make such a sap, have re trenched or cut off the breach. If it was in tended that the storming party should attack from the trenches at e, 200 yards distant, without any place to be occupied in the im mediate vicinity of the breach, the result of the storm must have been doubtful. It will appear by reference to the Plan of the gate way and breach (see Plate |VII.), that the besiegers would have had no small obstacles to surmount in attempting it ; and if the garrison had behaved with resolution, access to the breach, without some further operations, would appear impossible. The spot near the gateway, which was selected for the breach, was, in fact, the best defended point of the Fort ; but in this as in other instances during the war, the be- * Colonel Blacker's Memoir states 750 yards of trench to have been the quantity executed, but the Plan shows nearly 1000. The distances, stated by Colonel Blacker, of the batteries from the Fort are generally inconsistent with the Plan, which will account for the difference in the distances given by me, from those contained in Colonel Blacker's Memoir."], [100, "74 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP. III. 1818, siegers were obliged to breach that part of the walls, near which there was a causeway across the ditch, without reference to its comparative weakness or strength, for in the imperfect state of the siege department, it would have been be yond their means to have effected the passage of the ditch at any other point. It is a great and undeniable proof of judge ment, to regulate the project of attack of a Fortress, by the means at hand to carry it into effect, and judged by this rule, the plan pur sued on the present occasion was judicious; but with sufficient means for common siege operations, an Engineer Officer, in all proba bility, would rather have attacked the Fortress of Belgaum on the West side, immediately opposite to the mosque (marked 5), where there is a salient point, without any flanking defence on it whatever ; and a similar one is to be found on the East front, but the cover afforded by the Pettah would ensure a preference to the former. One approach, connecting the Pettah with the mosque (5), another of 200 yards from thence (towards 9), and a third of the same length, directed clear of the South-Western salient angle of the Fortress, would have brought the assailants to the foot of the slope of the glacis, from whence the descent into the ditch might have been carried on. When the trenches had advanced thus far, a breaching"], [101, "ATTACK OF BELGAUM. 75 battery might have been constructed on the CHAP. small rising ground, on which the mosque is nI situated, and there is no doubt that operations 1S1R of this kind might, with a well supplied De partment, have been brought to a certain ter mination in less time, than was employed in the present instance, in breaching a point, which, if defended,itwas uncertain whether we could gain. But it would have been madness to have attempted such a course as I have described, under existing circumstances, and it must be allowed, that the Commanding officer, from his experience at Badaumee, had good reason to depend on the valour of the troops, in sur mounting the obstacles, which the breach in the projected spot would have presented to them; and the trifling loss We experienced, of only 25 men, during a siege of twenty days open trenches, affords in itself the highest encomium on themanner in which the siege was conducted.

The Division arrived before Sholapoor oil the 9th of May, and took up its ground about two miles and a half from the Fort, on its Western side. The Fort being much covered by trees, its figure was not distinctly observed; but the enemy's Infantry and guns were seen, drawn up with their right upon the glacis, and their line extending to the Southward, along the bank of a Tank, which covered them breast high. The British force amounted to about 4000 men, as detailed above.

The reconnoitring party in the morning was threatened by a large body of the enemy, who came round the Western face of the Fort with a few guns ; but as they kept pretty close to the walls, and the reconnoitring party had accom plished its purpose, nothing further took place than a slight skirmish between the riflemen, who acted as a covering party to the Engineers, and the enemy's advanced parties of Horse. It was now determined to assault the Pettah,"], [104, "78 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP, previously to any operations being undertaken I1L against the Fort.

The two co- lumns moved forward at break of day, under cover of a sharp fire, opened at the same time from the gallopers, to keep down the match- lock firing, which had now commenced from the wall.

A smart fire of musketry was kept up be tween our most advanced parties in the Pettah, and bodies of the enemy, who had sheltered themselves in the covered way, and behind a new wall, thrown up on the glacis, which being pierced for matchlock firing, occasioned nu merous casualties among our troops.

The Engineers were therefore employed all the morning of the 11th, in reconnoitring the Fort. The troops of the line had been almost all on duty the preceding day, aud the remainder being for guard to-day, no working party of Europeans, or Sepoys, could be had. The Pioneers, however, and about 200 Coolies from the Pettah, were employed in collecting materials for the batteries. RECONNOISSANCE. The Fort was found to be covered by the glacis on the Northern, Western, and Eastern sides, to within 8 feet of the top of the wall ; the scarp of the rampart, and that of the ditch, appeared to be well built, of a bluish granite or clay slate ; the walls to be about 25 feet high, with battlements at top, in the Mussulman style. The ditch was of great breadth and depth, and those parts of it, which could be seen, were supplied with water. It was, however, ascer tained from information, thatpart of the Western"], [107, "81 ATTACK OF SHOLAPOOR. CHAP, III. 1818, and Southern fronts were dry, and as the retain ing wall of the Tank on the last-mentioned side, appeared to be very thin, it was supposed rea sonable to conclude, that there was a mound of earth behind to sustain the pressure. This cir cumstance, together with the difficulty and delay, which would necessarily be incurred in cutting through the glacis by sap, induced the Senior Engineer to recommend that the batteries should be established in the bed of the Tank. The revetment of the rampart could be seen from that spot nearly to the very bottom ; and by directing the fire, over the low retaining wall, where the revetment could be seen behind the covered way and glacis, a breach might be very soon effected, at a spot where the ditch was said to be dry ; and where, at all events, a passage could be effected by means of the retaining wall, or bund of the Tank. A battery of 1 mortar, 1 howitzer, and 2 six pounders, was this day established behind the bund of the Tank, near the South gate of the Pettah, as shown on the Plan. This was done with a view to keep the enemy within the walls, and to afford some cover to the working par ties, and advanced posts.

REFLECTIONS. The Commanding Engineer's reasons for attacking Sholapoor on the South front have been mentioned in the Journal ; and the sur render of the Fortress, before the breach was practicable, affords a reasonable presumption that the Garrison thought the part attacked indefensible; but although this fact alone may appear conclusive of the propriety of selecting it for the attack, it cannot be denied, that the besiegers would have had many obstacles to surmount, if the Garrison had determined to wait an assault. The breaching battery, which was our most advanced post, was placed in the bed of the Tank, and the troops, in march ing from thence to attack the breach, must have made a considerable detour of some hundred yards, and would have been exposed to a heavy fire, till they reached the counterscarp. It may, perhaps, have been intended, if the Garrison had continued to hold out, to push on ap proaches across the intermediate space, but the besieged, in all probability, would then have been able to retrench, or cut off the breach, be fore these approaches could have been complet ed. The Journal does not state in what way the"], [112, "86 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP III. 1818 ditch was to be crossed, if the enemy had deter mined to defend the breach. The retaining wall, which at that point divides the Tank from the ditch, is represented to have been very thin, and as it was commanded by the whole of the South front, a passage by it along the top, even if suffi ciently broad, would have been difficult and hazardous. As the plan does not shew the depth of either scarp or counterscarp, it is of course impossible to pronounce on the feasi bility of a passage across the ditch in any other way. With the means possessed by the besieging force, the point of attack was undoubtedly well chosen, and that where success was most likely to be obtained ; for the ditch there was dry, and the necessary time could not probably have been spared to make a passage across a wet one, even if the means had been sufficient for the operation, and if the besiegers had accom plished a lodgement on the glacis ; but the weakest point of the Fort, and which with means more respec table.the Engineer would per haps have chosen in preference for his attack, ap pears to be the North-West angle, where (if the Plan, which is on a very small scale, is correct) the wall of the Pettah, which is indefensible, and which, in this instance, was in our posses sion, gives a ready-made approach to the edge of the counterscarp ; and where a descent into,"], [113, "ATTACK OF SHOLAPOOR. 87 CHAP III. 1818 and passage across the ditch, and a breaching battery, would have been the only operations necessary. The former might have been commenced from behind the Pettah wall, where it termi nates on the counterscarp, opposite the North- West angle, and the latter might have been placed some distance in rear. It might, per haps, have been necessary to destroy a part of the glacis, which is described as covering all but eight feet of the rampart of the body of the place, by mines, to enable the guns of the bleaching battery to bear sufficiently low; but no parallel, or trenches, would have been re quired, as the Pettah wall would have afforded sufficient cover for the troops ; and, as the soil is said to have been favorable, a few days, with sufficient means, would have brought these operations lo a termination.

There is seldom any work raised on them, or indeed any thing done, farther than to cut flights of steps out of the solid rock, and to construct a number of gateways over them; and great ingenuity has been exerted to render these as intricate as possible.

The hill itself, on which the Fort stands, is so steep as to be inaccessible on the North and West sides, and is nearly so on a great part of the South side. On the Eastern side, a level space of small width juts out from the angle of the Fort, to the distance of 330 yards, where the descent to the plain begins, and the extremity of this peninsula (if it may be so called), had been occupied by the garrison, and the extremity of it at (c) appeared to be fortified by an advanced work, for the further defence of this, the easiest ascent to the Fort.

On the top of this ledge, where the two hills meet, in a sort of hollow way, or chasm, formed by the sides, is a Bheel village (See Plate X). The Engineer, in reporting to the Command ing Officer the result of his reconnoissance, de clared his opinion, that, from the great natural strength of this rock, a Garrison of 200 deter mined men, supplied with the requisite provi sions, &c. might bid defiance to the largest and best appointed army ; and that its fall must therefore depend on some fortunate occurrence, which might intimidate the Garrison into a surrender \" But although this be my opinion,\" the Engineer continued, \" I am far from con \" sidering that it should prevent our under \" taking its reduction; for if to justify the attack \" of any particular Fortress, it were considered \" necessary that we should be able to calculate \" on success beyond a doubt, such is the in \" efficiency of our means in this Department in V India, that not a siege could be undertaken; \" it therefore appears to me, that as long as \" this deficiency exists, we must trust for suc \" cess in our siege operations to good fortune,"], [119, "ATTACK OF RAJDEIR. 93 CHAP IV, 1818, \" as we have hitherto done, applying in the \" best manner possible, the means in our pos \" session.\" Under this view the following plan was proposed.

J^j The extent of this Fort, as bounded by the rocky scarp which defends it, is not less than Descrip tive miles, and the stupendous appearance oftionofthe . , , \u2022 , Fortof the place is much increased by some very high Trimbuck. hills, which occupy a great part of its interior Plates area. The scarp, which varies in height from xm. two to four hundred feet of perpendicular rock, surrounds the hill in every part, and leaves only the gateways as assailable points. Trimbuck has two gateways. That on the South side is the principal one, of easiest ascent, and is that by which the Garrison admit their provisions and stores ; that on the North side is only a single gate, the passage to which is by narrow steps, cut out of the rock, and only wide enough for one person to ascend at a time. The head of this passage is defended by two towers, connected by a curtain, in which is the gateway. The height of the hill is not so great on the North as on the South side, but it rises more abruptly, and the ascent is steeper. Besides the gateways, there are a few towers and works on different parts of the hill, but their position appears to have been dictated by ca price, rather than with any view to the greater security of the Fortress. The magazines and almost all the houses of the Garrison are exca vations in the rock. At the foot of the scarp, g 2"], [126, "100 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP IV 1818 and at a short distance from the passage lead ing to the North gate, is an old village in ruins, the stone walls of which are still sufficient to give cover to a large body of troops. The Pettah of Trimbuck, which is rather extensive, is at the bottom of the hill on the North side; and the river Godavery, issuing from an orifice of the rock within the Fort, flows through the center of the Town. PROJECT OF ATTACK. The Commanding Engineer recommended an attack on the North gate, for the following reasons \u2014 First: That although the ascent to it was more difficult, -than to the South gate, there was on the other hand but one line of works to destroy ; a point of great consequence, as we had only six-pounders with which to effect a breach, it being impossible to carry guns of a heavier calibre up the hill on either side. Secondly : On account of the advantages offered by the ruined village at the foot of the scarp, in constructing batteries, and giving cover to the troops, and by the Pettah of Trim buck, at the bottom of the hill. Thirdly : The road leading to the South side of the Fort was impracticable for guns, nor were the means, possessed by the besieging force, sufficient to overcome this obstacle ; in addition to which the enemy had poisoned all the wells on that side."], [127, "ATTACK OF TRIMBUCK. 101 The following was the plan of attack. To CHAP. silence the fire of the enemy's guns, particularly ' those which bore on the ruined village, and for ,g,g this purpose, to erect a battery at the bottom of the hill on the Northern side of it (at A), for plateXH. the heavy ordnance ; having effected this, to occupy, and form a lodgment, in the village, at the foot of the North gate (at B), and in it to erect a battery for 4 six-pounders, to batter the gateway ; and to carry the guns up to it by hand, as had before been practised at Rajdeir. At this short distance, about 100 yards, it was hoped that the towers, and curtain at the gateway, might be demolished, and that the troops might advance to the storm of the breach, under cover of the fire of the batteries, and of musketry, from the post in the village ; at all events, that a lodgment, so immediately under the gateway, might have the effect of alarming the Garrison, and inducing them to surrender. In order to cut off all hopes from the enemy of effecting their escape by the South side, and to distract their attention, 2 six-pounders, and a howitzer, were to be detached, and established as high up the hill, and as near to the South gate, as the nature of the ground would allow.

CHAP IV 1818, PlateXII, ground before the Fort, and the whole of the intrenching tools and materials, collected for the siege, were immediately carried to the spot chosen for the Engineer depot, in the Pettah. At four p. m. a detachment of 50 Europeans, 50 Sebendies,* and 150 Horse, with 2 six-pound ers, marched from camp to take up a position opposite to the South gateway. They were accompanied by a working party, under an Officer of Engineers, consisting of a small detail of Sappers and Miners, 30 Pioneers, and 50 Dooly bearers, provided with 40 ga bions, and 2000 sand bags. A battery for the 2 six-pounders, and a place of arms for the troops, were constructed during the night, within 500 yards of the gateway, and one of the guns was carried up, and placed in battery by day-light. A working party for the operations on the North side, was ordered to parade at sun-set, at the Engineer depot, of the following strength: half the corps of Sappers and Miners, 50 Eu ropeans, 80 Pioneers, 100 Dooly bearers, and about 100 Lascars, &c.

At twelve p. m. the relief for the working party arrived in the trenches, viz. the remaining half of the Sappers and Miners, 50 Sepoys, 400 Pioueers, and 200 Dooly bearers ; but as it was necessary to carry the earth for the battery from a distance, owing to the rocky nature of the ground, which of course delayed its com pletion considerably, it was deemed advisable not to relieve the old working party, but to keep both at work ; and we were thus enabled, by great labour, to complete the works a little before daylight, and to get 4 heavy guns, 2 eight-inch mortars, and 2 eight-inch howitzers into battery.

The reputation of Trimbuck for strength, was deservedly greater than that of any of the Forts, with which this country abounds, and being considered as a place of peculiarsanctity, from containing within its walls the source of the Godavery, one of the most sacred of Hin doo Rivers, an obstinate resistance was anti cipated. The Garrison, indeed, did not seem deficient in judgment, for the practice of their ordnance (of which they had seventeen pieces mounted), was very good, and they moved them about to different points, in a manner which showed that they knew where they could be mosteffective. Duringthecourseof theopera tions, they constructed a battery for two guns on the South side of the Fort, which enfiladed"], [133, "ATTACK OF TRIMBUCK. 107 CHAP IV 1818, our entrenchment on that side, and rendered it necessary to give it a shoulder, and to open an embrasure for a gun to keep them in check. The buildings were so few, and the place so extensive, that our bombardment had but little effect. The plan of attack was the best, or rather the only one, that could be adopted, but had the Garrison resisted with firmness, success could scarcely have been anticipated. The old village itself, if occupied by the enemy, could not have been carried without a great sacrifice of lives ; after the capture of which, even if the light ordnance employed had succeeded in de stroying the tower and gateway, still greater obstacles remained to be overcome. For the storming party must have advanced by a flight of steps, so very steep, that in many places it requires a man to climb them by the assistance of both his hands, and at the same time so narrow, that there is not room for two persons abreast. Under such circumstances, stones rolled from above would have sufficed to baffle the assailants. It is difficult to account for the want of reso lution displayed, in the defence of this impreg nable Fortress. The reasons for it must be sought, in the effect produced on the minds of the Garrison, by our rapid advances to the foot of the scarp, and by seeing their escape pre-"], [134, "108 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP IV 1818 vented by the works on the South side. The absence of their Prince, at this time a fugitive surrounded by British Armies, and the extreme improbability of his ever returning to his own dominions, must also have produced an un favourable effect on the spirit of the Garrison, and prevented them from attempting a more protracted resistance. Seventeen other Forts fell on the surrender of Trimbuck, and the whole of this country, perhaps the strongest in the world, came into our hands in a few weeks, almost without a struggle. In contemplating such pusillanimous cou duct, even on the part of our enemies, it is difficult to repress a feeling somewhat resem bling disappointment. The idea unavoidably arises, that nature intended these hills for other men, and other deeds. She seems to have marked them out as a theatre, on which the battles of freedom and independence might be successfully fought: for amongst them the undis ciplined and half-armed Native would be on a par with the most skilful and experienced vete ran ; and even in the stones which cover them, nature has furnished abundant arms for their defence. If these ideas, and the stern character of the scenery, which gave rise to them, seem little consonant with the habits and dispositions of the Natives, it should be remembered, that even in India the assertors of liberty have been"], [135, "REFLECTIONS ON THE HILL FORTS. 109 found; and that it was from these very hills, CHAP. that Sevajee first endeavoured to break the *** iron bonds, in which his countrymen were held . ,Q-.g by Aurungzebe.

They were ad mitted without suspicion, but before the whole party had entered, they attacked one of the sentries, who contrived to close the gates, but at the expense of his life. The Garrison was immediately alarmed, and succeeded in over powering the few who had gained admittance, while the remainder of the party, who were in the narrow flight of steps, leading to the North gate, suffered severely from the stones which were thrown upon them from above. After the fall of Trimbuck, the season {seem ed too far advanced to admit a hope of being able to continue operations, and Lieut.-Colonel M'Dowall prepared to take up a position for the monsoon, in the neighbourhood of Chan dore, while the Engineer Department moved to Nassuck, preparatory to proceeding to Bom bay, where it was intended to try, during the approaching rains, some experiments in pon tooning, suggested by Lieutenant Davies, the Commanding Engineer; but the political Au thorities deemed it of importance to obtain a"], [137, "DESCRIPTION OF MALLIGAUM. 111 footing in Khandesh (the greater part of which CHAP. province was in possession of the Arabs), be- fore the monsoon set in ; and the Detachment 1818. accordingly marched for Malligaum, before which place they arrived on the 16th of May, the Engineer Department having rejoined them, by forced marches, on the preceding day.

Native Infantry 263 Forming a Total of 983 But the effective strength of the Detachment must have been below 950 firelocks. There were besides 270 Pioneers, and a small detail of European Artillery, barely sufficient to furnish the necessary reliefs for the batteries. The Fortress of Malligaum is situated on the The For- _ tress of left bank of the River Moossum, a little above Malligaum i y-ii \u2022 m \u2022 described. its junction with the Ghirna. The river, which at the commencement of the siege, was every where fordable, runs under the West, and round a great part of the North and South sides. The Fort consists of three distinct lines of works, with a ditch in front of the middle line. The body of the Place is an exact square of 120 yards, flanked by a round"], [138, "112 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP. IV 1818 tower at each angle, and one in the centre of each side. The middle line, which is a kind of faussebray, is also quadrangular, running parallel to, and at a short distance from, the inner work ; but assuming an oblong shape, from the distance between them being greater on the East, than on the other sides. The outer line is of an irregular form, running parallel to the body of the Place on the West side only ; and extending to some distance on the other sides, where it embraces a large space of ground. It is strengthened throughout its whole extent, by round towers, at irregular intervals. Towards the East, and also on part of the Northern side of the Fortress, there is an additional line of works, formed of mud, but old and much decayed, between the ditch of the faussebray, and the outer line that has been described. It extends from the South- East angle of the ditch, as far as the works of the gateway on the Northern side, with which it is connected. The interior line and fausse bray are built with stone, and of excellent masonry ; and so is the outer line on the South side, and towards the River, but those parts of it, which face towards the Pettah, are of mud, and somewhat decayed. The height of the inner wall, measuring to the top of the parapet, is 60 feet : the thickness of the parapet at top is 6 feet, and the breadth of"], [139, "DESCRIPTION OF MALLIGAUM. 113 CHAP IV 1818 the terreplein 1 1 feet, making the total thick ness of the rampart at top 1 7 feet. The breadth of the space between the body of the Place and the faussebray, on part of the North, and on the West and South sides, is about 40 feet, of which 10 feet are appropriated to stabling. The roof of these stables, which is 1 0 feet high, forms the terreplein of the fausse bray, and is surmounted by a parapet of 5 feet. Thus the faussebray is 15 feet high interiorly, but exteriorly the scarp of that work is 40 feet in extreme height, including the depth of the ditch, which is for the greater part cut out of the solid rock, immediately below the scarp revetment of the faussebray, without an inter vening berm. This revetment is 5 feet thick. The width of the ditch is 25 feet : its depth varies, but is greatest on the river front, where it is 25 feet. The space between the counter scarp and the exterior line of works varies, as was before mentioned. It is least on the West side, where it is only 60 feet, and greatest on the East side, where it is 300 feet wide. The height of the outer line of works is 14 or 15 feet, the thickness of its parapet being 3 feet, and that of its rampart varying from 10 feet, on the West and South sides, to 14 feet on the East side, of the Fort. The gateways are nine in number, very intri cate, and all containing excellent bombproofs. H"], [140, "114 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP IV 1818 The outer ones are on the North, the inner ones on the Eastern side. The Fortress is much weakened, on this last mentioned side, by the Pettah, which extends to within close musket shot of the outer line of works. But the Pettah itself is capable of defence, as it contains a great many strong and lofty buildings ; an old decayed rampart surrounds the greater part of it, and, on the present occasion, the Garrison had barricaded all the entrances into it, with large beams of timber. Besides the disadvan tage of the Pettah running so close to the works, the defences of the Fort are further impaired by a village, called Sumnaree, situated on the left bank of the river, nearly opposite to the outer gate of the Fort, which communicates with the Pettah. A thick grove of mango trees, 400 yards in depth, also runs along the same bank of the river opposite to the South-West angle. The country is perfectly flat to a considerable dis tance around the Fort. The soil on the left bank of the river is a black mud, about one foot in depth, resting on a white sandy rock, soft and easily worked at the surface, but increasing in hardness in proportion to its depth. The oppo site bank of the river is entirely a shelving rock coveredwith loose sand, in many places to some depth. The Fort is said to have been built about sixty years, and the works to have been loop holed by an Engineer, who came from Delhi for"], [141, "115 ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. the purpose. The Garrison, from the best infor- CHAP. mation that could be collected, was estimated, F, when we arrived before the place, at 700 men. 1818. In the reconnoissance which the Engineers made, the Garrison allowed them to ride along the right bank of the river, immediately opposite the Fort, without interruption, as some nego ciations were going on at the time, and thus a good view was obtained of the defences of the inner and outer lines, on the South and West sides ; but nothing could be seen of the ditch or faussebray, the existence of which was only known from the reports of the Natives, who all differed in their accounts of the situation and dimensions of these works, describing the faussebray merely as a range of stabling. Very little could be ascertained regarding the strength of the Fort ou the East and North side, as the Garrison occupied the Pettah, and the village of Sumnaree. PROJECT OF ATTACK. From the limited information which was thus obtained, the Commanding Engineer re commended an approach from the right bank of the river, against the South-West angle, for the following reasons ; First, because in order to attack the East front, it would be necessary to carry the Pettah, whieh in all probability could not be effected, without suffering such loss as would cripple our future operations. Secondly, H 2"], [142, "116 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP IV 1818 the same objections existed to an attack on the North side, and to the Southward the ground on the left bank of the river was too confined for the necessary operations. Thirdly, that the ground on the right bank of the river was the most favorable for the construction of the neces sary works. The following was the plan he proposed : to construct the batteries (1) and (2) in the pro longation of the West and South faces, and at the distance of about 500 yards from them, in order to destroy the defences of those fronts, and to enfilade them. Each battery to have a place of arms attached to it, and to contain 2 guns, besides which, No. 1 battery was to be armed with 2 mortars and 2 howitzers for bom barding the place. A parallel (B) for 200 men was to be constructed the same night, in the mango grove, between these two enfilading bat teries. From the parallel (B) he proposed to advance by the zigzags B C D E F, to the bank of the river, along which the second parallel was to be esta blished, and on its right flank the breaching battery (3) for 4 guns. This was to be armed with the same guns, which were to be with drawn from the batteries (1) and (2), as soon as the defences of the Fort were ruined. The bottom of the revetments of the towers (y) and (\u2022?), which, were supposed to be of mud"], [143, "117 ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. CHAP IVj 1818. faced with stone, to be loosened by the breach ing battery, for the purpose of enabling the Miners to form chambers for destroying them ; and when this was effected, lodgments to be established in their ruins, and the intermediate curtain to be converted into a parallel ; that por tion of it, which was in the line of fire of the breaching battery, being levelled, in order that the bottom of the inner wall might be seen over it. From behind this lodgment, he proposed to sink a shaft, and working from thence, to blow in the counterscarp opposite to the curtain (f) which was to be breached ; and he projected some further mining operations on that side, which were to ruin the scarp of the ditch, and to destroy one of the interior towers. As much depended on confining the Garrison, he proposed that an establishment should be made opposite to the outer gate on the North side of the Fort, but it was necessary to post pone this till a reinforcement arrived. ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. May the 18th. All the intrenching tools and materials col lected for the siege, having been carried down at 5 P. m. to the Engineer Depot, which was established in rear of the mango grove, the working parties for the night assembled. At dusk the Engineers marked out the enfilading batteries (1) and (2) about 500 yards distant"], [144, "118 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP IV 1818 from the South-West angle of the body of the Place, and in the prolongation of the South and West faces. The former was intended for 2 eighteen-pounders, 2 eight-inch howitzers, and 2 eight-inch mortars: the latter for 2 twelve pounders. The parallel (B) about 200 yards in length, and 300 distant from the bank of the river, was also marked out. As soon as it was dark, the working parties filed off to their respective works, and commenced their opera tions. About eight p. M. the enemy made a sortie from their own left, along the bank of the river, and attacked the covering party posted in the grove, in front of the working party, con structing the parallel. This sortie was sup ported by a sharp fire from the guns in the Fort, and of matchlocks from the lower wall. The Arabs behaved with great gallantry, fighting from tree to tree, and were engaged hand to hand with a detachment of the Madras Euro pean Regiment, who could not form line, owing to the nature of the ground, but who succeeded in repulsing them, after a short and sanguinary conflict, in which Lieuteuant Davies, the Com manding Engineer, was unfortunately killed.* * This Officer has scarcely left his equal behind him in zeal, perseverance, and activity.

GHAP, IV 1818, May the \\9th. The batteries (1) and (2) opened on the Fort at day-light, the former with tolerable effect: but the twelve-pounders in the latter were found to make little or no impression on the defences of the inner Fort. The enemy returned the fire from 7 or 8 guns, of all calibres, from nine-pounders downwards, the greater part of which were disabled and silenced by our guns in the Course of the morning. During the night, the approach B C D E F was constructed, which afforded tolerable cover, and a small portion of the second parallel at the head of the zigzags was also completed, in which three embrasures had formed into execution with a courage and perseverance, which deserved success if they could not always command it. When not actively employed, his time was entirely given up to the study of his profession, and to the instruction of his little body of Sappers and Miners : nor can higher proof of his merit be desired, than the proficiency attained by these men, during a period of active service, in duties entirely new to them. Having alluded in a former note to the reflections thrown out by a cotemporary writer, against his temper, I shall only add, that it was too often tried by the vexatious opposition, which he experienced to his enlightened views, whilst endeavouring to place his Department on a more efficient footing. His brother Officers of the Corps of En gineers have determined to erect a monument to his memory, and to that of Lieutenant Nattes, who fell shortly after, hoping that this record of their esteem and respect, whilst it perpetuates the names of those distinguished Officers, may also serve as an incitement to others, to follow their example, and emulate their fame."], [146, "120 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP IV 1818 were opened to protect the left flank of the parallel. A battery for 2 six-pounders was prepared at (G), and the adjoining avenues and gardens were occupied. At ten p. m. the enemy made a sortie, to attack this post, but were repulsed without loss on our part. The small ness of our force did not admit of our taking possession of the whole village. May the 20th. The village (H) on our left, which had been deserted by the inhabitants during the night of the 19th, was occupied by a party of Arabs, who at 10 this morning made a bold attack on our outposts, but were soon repulsed and driven out of the village by a charge of the Sepoys of the 13th Madras Native Infantry, under Captain Robson. The eighteen and twelve-pounders, in batteries (I) and (2) were fired but seldom, on account of a scarcity of shot. The approaches were completed to the proper width, and 2 six-pounders were placed in the battery at (F), to scour the river and de stroy the defences of the lower work. During the night the parallel was extended, without loss, about 140 yards to the right, along the bank of the river, and at the distance of 150 yards from the exterior works of the Fort. May 21st. The right of the parallel was extended 150 yards, along the bank of the river; and the"], [147, "ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM; 121 CHAP IV 1818 breaching battery (3), of four guns, was con structed at the distance of about 150 yards from the enemy's exterior line of works, on the South side of the Fort. On the right of this battery, one mortar was placed, and at the ex treme right a return was formed, for the protec tion of this flank of the trenches. May 22d. The guns were brought up from the batteries (l) and (2), and were placed in the breaching battery after day-light, the enemy's fire being kept under by a continued fire of musketry from the trenches, and by the six-pounders placed at (F) on the left of the parallel, which enfiladed the South face of the exterior line of works. In prosecution of the proposed plan of attack, the battering guns opened immediately afterwards, for the purpose of destroying the defences of the lower work, and forming holes in the towers (y and z), for the Miners to lodge themselves. These towers, however, proved to be of solid stone and chunam, so that it appeared impossi ble to effect this object. Hence a change in the plan of attack became necessary, and it was therefore resolved to breach the lower wall, and form a lodgment on its rampart. From the arrival of a small reinforcement, we were enabled, during the night, to take pos session of the village of Sumnaree, and the ad joining gardens, and to occupy a strong posi-"], [148, "SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. 122 CHAP IV 1818 tion (I) on the bank of the river, opposite to the principal gateway of the Fort. On the right of this position, a small place of arms, and a battery (4) for 2 six-pounders, were constructed, into which the guns from the bat tery (G), which was about 170 yards in rear of this position, were brought up, aud that battery was dismantled. This new post, besides dis tracting the enemy's attention, put a stop to the free ingress and egress, by the gateway, which they had formerly possessed; and consequently caused them to be more exposed to our shells, than heretofore. May 23d. The breaching guns effected a good breach in the curtain of the lower wall, so as to dis cover a part of the faussebray. The rampart at the breach proved too narrow to admit of form ing even a tolerable lodgment on it, and in formation led us to believe that there was no cover between it and the ditch. It was there fore resolved to breach the faussebray and inner wall, by firing over the breach in the exterior work. During the day a five-and-a-half-inch howitzer was placed in the battery (F), and threw some shells between the works, which annoyed the enemy much, and entirely kept down their fire from the outer wall. May 24th. The breaching guns brought down the top"], [149, "ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. 123 CHAP IV 1618 of the faussebray, and commenced firing upon the body of the place, as low as possible. About four p. m. a shell from battery (F) blew up a small powder magazine in the Fort. May 25th. The breach was extended to the right and left. In the afternoon, the parapet and upper part of the revetment fell down, in consequence of the lower part being ruined. May 26th. At four p. m. the breaching guns succeeded\" in making a hole through the center of the cur tain. The breaching battery was enlarged during the night, to receive a howitzer. This day the 17th Chicacole Light Infantry joined the Detachment. May 27th. The battering continued with the eighteen pounders only, as the twelve pound shot were expended. All the guns ran at the vent, in consequence of the continued firing, and had become almost unserviceable. At four p. m. more of the upper part of the rampart fell down, forming to all appearance an excellent breach. Guns were fired at intervals during the night to keep the breach clear. May 28th. The battering guns were employed in cutting away the sides of the breach, so as to form an ascent on each side for mounting the rampart."], [150, "124 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP IV 1818, The breach was then reported practicable; and it was determined to assault the Fort at day light, next morning.* ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE ASSAULT. Three simultaneous attacks were ordered to be made, on different sides of the place ; one on the Pettah, the second on the exterior line of works, and the third and principal one on the breaches. The first had for its main object the occupation of the Pettah, to prevent the escape of the Garrison into it, on the assault of the Fort. The second party were to take posses sion of the outer walls by escalade, between the great gate and the ditch, and to establish them selves there, and as it was supposed that, they would be able to find cover and command the passage of the ditch, no difficulty was contem plated in effecting their lodgment. Both of these attacks it was hoped would distract the attention of the Garrison, and would enable us, if repulsed at the breach, to have recourse to extensive mining operations.

The party for the escalade of the outer wall consisted of 50 Europeans, 250 Sepoys, and 50 Pioneers, with 5 scaling ladders ; and was also led by an Engineer Officer. The storming party for the assault of the breach was led by Lieutenant Nattes, the Com manding Engineer, and was composed of the European Sappers and Miners, and a Serjeant's party of Europeans, each carrying besides his arms, a bundle of grass for filling up the ditch. They were followed by the Native Sappers and Miners with scaling ladders, 75 Europeans with bundles of grass, and 80 Sepoys ; 125 Sepoys were ordered to file to the right and left on passing the outer breach, and to scour the outer ramparts, taking possession of the huts between the walls. A reserve of 50 Europeans and 300 Sepoys were to follow this party, and had orders also to extend to the right and left, if it should appear necessary; otherwise they were to remain under cover, without the exte rior walls.

H., a brisk fire from the breaching battery (3), and from the mortar bat tery (1), was directed against the breach, and the space between the walls. At broad day light, the storming party advanced in the pre scribed order. The Engiueer who led, on reaching the summit of the breach on the first wall, waved his hand to his party, the meaniug of which it is impossible to ascertain, as imme diately afterwards he received several shots from a retrenchment (\u0153) that had been con structed by the enemy for the defence of the breach, by which he was mortally wounded.* i * Lieutenant Nattes was alike admirable as an Officer, a Gentleman, and a Christian. With the science and zeal, which become the military character, he combined the urbanity of manners, the liberal accomplishments, and : the warmth of heart, that constitute the ornaments and the bond of private life, together with those virtues, which are the fruits of sincere devotion. Nothing could be more distressing, than to see him cut off in the bloom of youth, just as his mild and unassuming merits were becoming generally known. Only a few hours before he died, he committed his thoughts to paper, in which he expressed, that the grief, which he knew"], [153, "ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. 127 CHAP IV 1818 The Officer commanding the storming party afterwards mounted the breach, but on letting down his scaling ladders, on the other side of the wall, it is said that they all fell out of the men's hands, who held them. This circumstance being reported, orders were given for the whole party to retreat to the trenches, which was effected in a steady man ner. Immediately afterwards the Garrison hung out a flag of truce, that we might carry away our dead and wounded. Meanwhile the party for the attack of the Pettah advanced at a quarter before four o'clock, took possession of a considerable part before day-light, and by seven o'clock gained entire possession of it, with a trifling loss. The other party did not escalade the outer wall of the Fort, as intended. There was some difficulty at first, in adjusting the length of the ladders, and after this was rectified, a delay occurred, whilst the Officer commanding the party was employed in posting sharpshooters to keep down the enemy's fire. Before this was effected that his dear parents and some valued friends would feel, in case of his fall, was the only consideration, that weighed upon bis mind, in anticipating the probability of sach an event.

CHAP IV 1818, to his satisfaction, the failure of the storming party at the breach became known, and the attempt was of course abandoned, having ex perienced a trifling loss, in placing the ladders. During the night temporary barricades were constructed across the principal streets of the Pettah, upon which the enemy made several attacks, but was constantly repulsed. May the 30th. After the failure of the assault on she Fort, it was recommended that the attack on the West side should be abandoned, for the follow ing reasons. First, the total want of guns and ammunition, the breaching guns having become unserviceable, and all the shot being expended. Secondly, the length of time that would pro bably elapse before the arrival of a reinforce ment of artillery. Thirdly, on account of the threatening state of the weather, and the ex pected approach of the monsoon, which might render the river an insurmountable obstacle to our operations on that side. It. was therefore proposed to commence an entirely new attack on the East face of the Fort, as the possession of the Pettah afforded our troops ample cover, and a safe approach, on that side, to the outer wall, the nature of which was now for the first time ascertained, as also a facility of mining, to which the river on the West side was an insurmountable obstacle."], [155, "ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. 129 CHAP IV 1818, In order to confine the Garrison as much as possible, it was proposed to leave a battalion of Sepoys on the West side of the river, which might take up its quarters in the village (H), whence parties to be relieved occasionally might be sent to the post (I), and to a redout, which it was recommended to construct near the breaching battery. The streets of the Pettah, communicating with the Fort, to be barricaded, by which means an excellent parallel would be obtained, along the whole extent of that side of the Fort. It was then proposed to establish mines under the three towers (/, m, and n) of the outer wall, and for this purpose to sink shafts within the houses immediately opposite to them, and eventually to form lodgments on the breaches caused by these mines, in conse quence of which it was expected, that the enemy would be driven from the outer wall. Having proceeded so far, it was not expected that much more could be done till the arrival of a reinforcement of artillery. May 31st. Working parties were employed in preparing materials. Battery (1) was dismantled, and during the night, permanent barricades (o,p, q, and r) were constructed across the principal streets of the Pettah. June \\st.

This morning, a little before day-light, the mine fell in, in consequence of the little depth of soil above, and of a heap of stones under which the gallery ran, which gave way, and buried the European Miner, who was fix ing the sheeting boards. Fortunately, the gallery was covered over, without being per ceived by the enemy. June Qth. During the night, battery (5) on the North side of the Fort, for all the mortars, and 2 guns expected from Seroor, was commenced about 400 yards from the outer wall.

June 11th. Battery (5) opened at daylight with 1 ten inch, and 5 eight-inch mortars, and 2 five-and a-half-inch howitzers. At eleven a.m. two of the enemy's powder magazines blew up in quick succession, bringing down a large portion of one of the curtains of the body of the place from the very foundation, and exposing the whole interior of the Fort. In consequence of the extent and apparent practicability of the breach caused by the explosion, it was resolved that no time should be lost in taking advantage of it. Accordingly, during the night, the battery (6) for 2 eighteen-pounders, was constructed in a Mussulman's burying ground, 320 yards from the works, in order to destroy the defences of the inner wall. Another battery (7) for 4 eighteen-pounders, was commenced on the bank of the river, opposite to, and 600 yards distant from the outer wall, which it was resolved to breach, in frontof thespot, where the explosions above-mentioned had laid open the interior line of works. June 12-//. Negociations being entered into, we were enabled to proceed with battery (7), which was"], [159, "ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. 133 CHAP IV 1818 completed in the course of the day.

The Garrison marched out of the Fort at a quarter past nine a.m., and grounded their arms before our troops, who were drawn up to re ceive them in front of the principal gateway.

They acknowledged to have lost 35 killed and 60 wounded during the siege.* Our loss was much more severe, being 5 officers killed, 8 wounded, and 220 rank and file killed and wouuded.

If it were not for the Pettah, which weakens the East front so materially, Malligaum might be considered a perfect specimen of thestrongest kind of Native Forts, so far as regards the size and disposition of the works, and also in re ference to the rockiness of the soil, on which it is placed. The chief objection to the original project of attack is, that even if it had been possible to destroy the towers (y and z) by mining, as pro posed, the intervention of the river between them and the trenches, must have proved an insuperable obstacle to that species of uninter rupted and comparatively secure communica-"], [162, "130 CHAP. IV. 1818, SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. tion, at all hours, which is desirable, if notindis pensably necessary to a besieging army, in the event of an obstinate and protracted resistance, in which every successive work is disputed inch by inch. Accordingly it has been asserted, that the Fort was attacked in its strongest side; but it must be remembered, in justice to the ex cellent Officer now no \"more, by whom the plan was formed, that he had only a choice of diffi culties. The side actually attacked, but for the obstacle that has been noticed, was far from being the strongest. On the contrary, if success could have been anticipated on any side, from distant breaching batteries, without the neces sity of progressive approaches, the side actually attacked, or the West side, which like it can only be approached by crossing the river, may undoubtedly be considered the most favourable for such an operation ; for on the two other sides of the Fortress, the intricate works de fending the gateways, and one extra inclosure, offer additional difficulties to an assault. But the chief reason which induced Lieutenant Davies to commence his operations from the opposite side of the river, was the reluctance which he felt to an attack on the Pettah, which otherwise must have been an indispensable preliminary. For in the event of a vigorous resistance, which there was every reason to an ticipate, he thought that Lieutenant-Colonel"], [163, "ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. 137 CHAP IV 1818, M'Dowall's original force would be so much weakened, by the loss it must necessarily sus tain in the capture of the Pettah, as to become entirely unequal to those ulterior operations, without which the fall of the Fortress itself could not be expected. Under this impression, having decided upon opening the trenches from the opposite side of the river, I shall only remark, that if he could have foreseen the im possibility of destroying the towers (y and z) by mining, as originally intended, he would, in all probability have breached any other part of the South side, or some part of the West side of the outer wall, in preference to the re-enter ing angle between these two towers. If, on the contrary, we had arrived before Malligaum, in sufficient numbers to have ren dered a more vigorous mode of proceeding advisable, the Pettah would have been imme diately assaulted, after the capture of which, the towers (/, m and n) might have been destroy ed by mines, either by driving galleries under them for that purpose, or by attaching the Miners to their scarp, for if the former method proved impracticable, on account of the rocki ness of the soil, the latter might have been effected without difficulty, as the towers were constructed of mud. After these were ruined by mining, lodgements on the breaches might have driven the enemy from the outer line, and"], [164, "138 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP. IV 1818, confined him to the body of the Place and faussebray. The South side of the outer line thus falling into our possession, might have been converted into a convenient parallel, ex tending from the Pettah to the tower marked (z) in the plan, near to which a breaching bat tery might have been constructed to breach the front (a b), either in the spot where the breach was actually effected in the present instance, or in the curtain, near the tower (_\u2022). It was before-mentioned, that Lieutenant Nattes, when on the summit of the breach, was seen to wave his hand, and that when the storm ing party who followed him mounted it, imme diately afterwards, the ladders dropped out of the hands of the men, whilst in the act of lower ing them, for the purpose of descending the wall in rear of the breach. It has been confi dently asserted, that the motion made by Lieut. Nattes, was a signal for the storming party to retire, in consequence of his having discovered from that elevated position, certain insuperable obstacles, previously unknown ;* and it has also been of course implied, that the ladders were considerably shorter, than the height of the wall alluded to, and consequently that they proved unserviceable, at the very moment when required for use. Of these assertions, I consider the one more than doubtful, the other decid- See Lieut.-Colonel Blacker's Memoir."], [165, "ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. 139 CHAP. IV 1818, edly erroneous. For, on the most minute ex amination of the works, after the place surren dered, the surviving Engineers found, that the only obstacle to the success of the assault, and certainly a very formidable one, was the fausse bray. But Lieutenant Nattes fell on the breach, from whence he could not possibly have seen more than 5 or G feet of the ditch of that work, the actual depth of which can no where be as certained without advancing to the very crest of its counterscarp. It is evident, therefore, that nothing seen by him, on mounting the breach, could give him a more formidable notion of that work, than he entertained before, for although the precise strength of the faussebray was not known, its depth was by no means an unforeseen obstacle, but one considered, and in a certain degree provided for, in the plan of assault.* In regard to the breach itself, it is true * Extract of an official letter, written the day before the assault, from Lieutenant Nattes to Lieut.-Colonel M'Dowall. \" That a ditch does exist, and that behind it there is a \" loop-holed faussebray, are facts. That these are obstacles \" is equally true, but I do not consider them insuperable. \" Similar obstacles in Spain were overcome by the means \" which I propose,\" &c. &c. The above quotation sufficiently proves the incorrectness of the assertion, that Lieutenant Nattes discovered certain un foreseen obstacles, on mounting the breach of the outerwall. He had, however, in calculating the quantity of materials for filling up the ditches, estimated its depth at 20 feet, \u00bb -hereas it was afterwards found to be 25 feet."], [166, "140 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP IV 1818, that the original wall in the reverse of it, remain ed nearly entire, but this was only 8 feet high, and the ladders carried to the spot were 18 feet long; and the enemy had made no at tempt whatever to scarp away the ground at the bottom of the wall alluded to. In fact, the only work, constructed by them behind the breach, was the retrenchment marked (x) in the plan, which scarcely deserves the name, for it consisted of a trench, not 2 feet in width and depth, and of a parapet equally insignificant. (See the Section through e f in Plate XV). As the wall before described in the reverse of the breach, was a little lower towards the left, than on the extreme right, where Lieutenant Nattes himself had ascended, it is possible that the waving of his hand may have been intended to caution the storming party to incline a little to their left ; but for my part, as he must have despised the paltry obstacles at and in the immediate vicinity of the breach, I have not the smallest doubt but that the waving of his hand was a signal to the troops to advance without loss of time, in the hope of their being able to close with the Arabs in their retrench ment, before the latter could effect their retreat into the faussebray. That the storming party did not advance further, as they certainly might have done, is, however, no discredit to them, for be sides she loss of the Eugineer who led the as-"], [167, "ATTACK OF MALLIGAUM. 141 sault, their own Commanding Officer was badly wounded, and the second in command killed on the breach,* where the head of the column CHAP. IV. 1818. remained with great coolness, exposed to a de structive fire, until they received directions to retire, which they did in good order. If these unfortunate casualties had not paralized the efforts of the troops at the breach, which caused the escalade on the outer line on the other side of the Fort also to be relinquished, it is not altogether impossible, but that the three simul taneous attacks, vigorously conducted, might have produced such an effect upon the enemy, as to lead to the immediate surrender of the place.

Chanda can hardly be considered as a place of strength, the great extent of it alone render ing it indefensible, unless garrisoned by an army. Without a ditch or an outwork, protected only by a single rampart, in no place higher than 20 feet, and surrounded on all sides by Pettahs, and broken ground, to within a few yards of its walls ; no European Garrison would think of standing a siege in it against battering guns, and it affords a striking proof of the incon sistency of the Native character, that while they constantly, during the war, surrendered im pregnable Fortresses without a blow, they should have thought not only of defending this walled town, but of standing the assault, after a practicable breach was made. In the attack of a place, which was almost equally vulnerable on every side, there was of course little scope for the display of profes sional skill, yet it may be remarked, that the advantage taken of the ground by the Engineer, who contrived to bring the troops up to within half musket shot of the walls, without trenches, was highly to his credit. The position selected for the breaching battery is also deserving of praise ; and the advantage of establishing it at as"], [177, "ASSEERGHUR. 151 CHAP IV 1818 short a distance as possible, was proved by the circumstance of the rampart, which was a very good one, being breached in nine hours after the opening of this battery, although the firing was constantly interrupted by the heating of the metal. The duty in the trenches was un usually severe, in consequence of the heat of the. weather, and amongst the victims of it was Major Goreham, a very distinguished officer of the Madras Artillery.

The Fortress of Asseerghur had en gaged our attention at different periods, but the attack of it had been postponed, in the first instance, in consequence of the hostilities com menced by the Nagpoor Rajah, and afterwards, perhaps, from a consideration of the inadequacy of our means to reduce it.

It was also sur rendered to the English in the Mahratta War of 1803, but was restored to Sindiah imme diately afterwards. Being situated in one of the great passes from the Deckan into Hindo stan, the possession of this Fortress has always been considered of importance, and the natural defence, which it receives from a precipice of rock, in almost every part, has been increased by a thick and lofty rampart of masonry, which is built on the summit of the rock, and by large cavaliers placed indifferent parts of it, mounted with enormous guns, which commanded the country around in every direction.* The gene ral height of this position above the plain is 750 feet. Its greatest length is 1 100 yards, and its greatest breadth 600. Nearly one half of the rock towards the Westward has been fur ther protected by a second inclosure of good masonry immediately below it, and following the curved outline of the natural scarp, from which circumstance, it has been aptly styled Kuininurgah (or the belt) ; and on the same side, but not covering so much of the Northern face of the rock, a third inclosure has been added of an irregular form, containing a space * One of these guns is pompously styled the Lord of the Boorhanpoor Bazar, which the Natives firmly believe it will reach, although fourteen miles distant in a direct line. It is of iron, and carries a ball of 384 pounds."], [183, "DESCRIPTION OF ASSEERGHUR. 157 CHAP. Y 1819 nearly equal to the area of the upper or prin cipal Fort. This third inclosure, which is called Mallighur, constitutes the lower Fort. The Pettah is situated still more to the West ward, in a hollow intersected by numerous ravines, and lies immediately under the lower Fort, the works of which overlook and com mand it throughout its whole extent. The entrance of the lower Fort is from the Pettah, and the road to it, which forms a gentle ascent, is well flanked by the works on each side. In every other part the ascent from the Pettah towards the lower Fort is exceedingly steep. The principal entrance into the upper Fort, near the Western extremity of the rock, is by steep flights of stone steps, secured by five gateways of excellent masonry, by means of which it communicates with the lower Fort, through the second inclosure. There is also a sally-port at the South-East angle, open at top, and protected by five traverses, which affords a direct communication from the upper Fort to the country on that side. The second inclosure before described has likewise a direct commu nication with the country, by a weak wicket or small gateway at its right extremity, under the middle of the Northern side of the rock.

The rock, which is the natural boundary of the upper Fort, fails in three places, where of course more attention has been paid to the masonry, than in other parts. First, on the North side, at the part marked (o) in the plan, where a very thick double rampart has been built to supply this deficiency. Secondly, towards the East, not far from the North-East angle, at the head of a ravine, which commences in the interior of the Fort, and runs from thence into the plain, extending wide, and branching out into several ramifications in its descent. Across the top of this ravine has been thrown a casemated rampart, nearly 50 yards in length and 40 feet thick ; below which at the distance of 50 yards, there is a second wall, which ap pears to have been intended chiefly for the pur pose of preventing the earth from being washed away during the rains. Thirdly, near the South-East angle, where are the works of the"], [185, "ATTACK OF ASSEERGHUR. 159 sally-port before-mentioned ; in front of which CHAP. a low wall has been built, to prevent this en- V trance into the Fort from being seen from the iqjq country. There are a good many buildings in the Fort, and some fine tanks and wells. On the North and South sides, the country below the Fort is plain and generally level, but intersected by two or three Nullahs.* At the foot of the hill, on the North side, are several gardens and vine yards, all supplied with wells of water. On the East and West sides, the country is inter sected by deep ravines, and ranges of hills, which on one side extend as far as the river Taptee, and on the other connect with the great Sautpoorah range, it being understood, how ever, that every eminence within long cannon shot is considerably lower than the command ing position of Asseerghur. ATTACK OF ASSEERGHUR. A large depot of materials had been forming for some time previous to the siege, at a village between Brigadier-General Doveton's Head Quarters, and the advanced post under Lieut.- Colonel Pollock, about seven miles distant from the Fort. On the 17th of March, all at tempts at an amicable adjustment having failed, * Nullahs are water courses generally dry, except in the rainy season, when they present the appearance of mountain torrents, and sometimes even of rivers."], [186, "160 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY.

The ground having been previously recon noitred, and the necessary arrangements made, the Pettah was taken at daybreak, by a simul taneous attack of two columns from the two Divisions, of Brigadier-General Doveton, and Brigadier-General Sir John Malcolm, which were encamped North and South of the For tress. Brigadier-General Doveton's column, commanded by Colonel Fraser, and led by His Majesty's Royal Scots, entered the Pettah by the South-West gate, at the head of the Battu keerah Nullah. Brigadier-General Sir John Malcolm's column, entered by the high road from Boorgaum aud Choulkan, through a gap in the hills, which cover the Pettah on the North-West. The enemy were taken by sur prise, and made but little opposition, flying as the attacking party advanced, and our troops soon established themselves under cover of the houses, with a trifling loss, occasioned by the fire from the lower Fort, which opened as soon as the enemy's party had evacuated the Pettah. A battery (a) for 6 light howitzers, to keep down the enemy's fire, was completed during the day.

Owing, however, to the difficult nature of the soil, and a deficiency of materials, the battery, although commenced, was not continued. A secure post at (rf) was completed, but in consequence of the flank ing fire of the lower Fort, as it was impossible to make an approach to it, without going through the tedious operation of the double sap, it was determined always to withdraw the troops at daylight to (c), that post answering the same purpose during the day. The streets were bar ricaded, in the openings leading to the lower Fort, so as to afford a safe communication along the whole extent of the main street of the Pettah. The enemy fired during the night at the respective working parties, but without effect. March \\9th. The post at (c) was this morning completed.

The battery (b) was finished during the night, 400 yards from the North-West salient angle of the lower Fort ; and another was commenced at (e), on the rising ground above the Pagoda, for eight mortars and howitzers. The ground on which the mortar battery was placed, was so hard, that the fascines (the only materials at hand) could not be picketed sufficiently stroug. The revetment, therefore, gave way when nearly completed, aud the work was left unfinished. The enemy did not fire this night, or attempt any annoyance, after being beat back in their sally.

Yet from its character and from local circumstances, it was expected to offer great resistance ; and if the magnitude of the preparations against it be considered, it was certainly more respectably defended, than any of those which possessed greater advantages of position ; but the Kil ledar, though he had received secret in structions to defend the place to the utmost, knew that his Master had openly given us orders of a different tendency ; and doubtful perhaps, how far this duplicity would he avowed, and fearing that his personal safety might be compromised, he surrendered before he had cause for alarm. His feeling of doubt as to what course to pursue, was strongly ex pressed in a conversation he held with Sir John Malcolm, the day before the surrender of his Fortress. He told that General, \u00ab' that Sindiah would be very angry with him;\" and on being answered that, \"he had just cause\" he said, \"Yes, he will reproach me much for having fought so badly with so fine a Fort, he will say I ought to have died.\" On General Malcolm"], [203, "ATTACK OF ASSEERGHUR. 177 CHAP V. 1819 asking him, \" If he had not an order from his Master to evacuate the Fort,\" he said \"It might be the usage amongst Europeans, but with the Mahrattas, Forts like that, (pointing to Asseerghur) were not given up upon orders.\" The vigour, with which both of the besiegers' attacks were pushed forward, and the manner in which their guns were carried to heights, which the Garrison had deemed inaccessible, must have made a great impression ; and the besieged werefurtherdisheartened, by thedeath of their principal Jemidar of Artillery, who was killed on the 28th of March, while laying a gun in the North-East bastion. Had a practi cable breach been effected in the casemated curtain on the East front, the storming party might possibly have gained it, by keeping close to the rock, after reaching the North-East salient angle of the Fort; and, in their progress, they would then have only been exposed to the opposite slank, the defences of which were completely destroyed, and the fire of it had once, even before that period, been kept under by the excellent practice of No. 1 battery, at the time that the guns were taken into the breaching battery.

CHAP V. 1819 and it cannot be supposed, that under any cir cumstances the attack of such a position, if well defended, could have been made without great loss. If there be any part of the operations, to which the praise that they generally merit, cannot be given, it is the delay which took place in the assault of the lower Fort. It was a principal object, of course, to confine the Gar rison within as narrow limits as possible, in order to give greater effect to our bombard ment; but they were left in possession of the lower Fort, ten days after a practicable breach was made in it, without any apparent reason. Nor was this the only inconvenience, for the delay, which took place, afforded the enemy ample time for retrenching the breach, of which indeed they did not avail themselves ; but an apprehension that they might have done so, caused the additional laborious attack on the South front, which would otherwise have been unnecessary. An examination of the Fort, two years after it was besieged, has raised doubts in the Au thor's mind, whether a practicable breach could ever have been effected on the West side.

The third place, where the rock fails, which forms a part of the sally-port, near the South- East angle, appears to present a more assail able point, than either of the other two. It is not flanked, like the retaining and inner wall, on the East attack; nor, if we may judge by the sally-port being open to the top immediately behind it, is the rampart built against the rock, as at the part attacked on the North side. The breaching battery, in an attack on this point might be established at (A), within 350 yards SeePLAT of the point B, and the besiegers would have the benefit of a level space to traverse, between it and the breach. The outer work in front of this is only a breast wall, apparently made to hide the door of the sally-port, which here opens to the country, and indeed the only ap parent objection to such an attack, is the great difficulty which would attend the carrying heavy guns up to that height.

Asseerghur has, since its capture, been ceded to the British Government; and its pos session will perhaps enable us to restrain the excesses of the Bheel Tribes, who inhabit the neighbouring range of hills; and will, at all events, prevent it from becoming a strong hold of plunderers. It is a question however de serving consideration, how far these advantages will repay the expense of garrisoning it, and keeping its now decayed works in repair. Its central situation, between the Deckan and Malwa, seems to fit it admirably for a geneial Depot, but this it can never become; for the access to the upper Fort is too difficult, for the constant passage up and down of heavy stores: and the lower Fort, which might be used for the purpose, is commanded on every side; be sides which the sum it would require, to com plete it as a place of strength for this purpose,"], [207, "ATTACK OF NOWA. 181 would go far towards building a new Fort, on CHAP. better principles, on the plain.* v> ATTACK OF NOWA. 18I9 The Fort of Nowa which is situated about Des.rip 24 miles North-East of Nandair, a City on the f. \"tV 'e Godavery, is in shape an oblong square, of p1**\" which the longest side is 46 yards, and the XXL shortest 36.

At the angles, it follows the form of the circular towers of the body of the place, by which the ditch is much better defended, than is generally the case with Native Forts. The faussebray is further pro tected by traverses, which are placed in dif ferent parts, to prevent it from being enfiladed. There is no berm between the faussebray and the scarp of the ditch, and the height, from the top of its parapet to the bottom of the ditch, is 35 feet. The height of the counterscarp, from the bottom of the ditch to the crest of the gla cis, is 25 feet ; and as this latter work is raised 12 feet above the surrounding country, the whole depth of the excavation of the ditch is 13 feet ; and it is 35 feet wide. The principal gateway is on the East front, which is one of the longest, and is as usual very well flanked, by two circular projections, which spring from this front, in addition to the circu lar towers at the angle. The communication with the country is by means of a bridge, over the ditch, easily removeable ; and a road across the glacis. There is also a sally-port on the West front, communicating with the country in the same manner. The environs are perfectly clear and level, to a considerable distance.

The explosion was very con siderable, making an excellent descent into the ditch, and filling up part of it (See the Section C D in Plate XXI). A cloud of dust darkened the air for four or five minutes, under cover of which the ladders were planted, and the troops ascended the breach before the Garrison had recovered from their consternation.

The Fort of Nowa, though it can hardly be called a formidable place of defence, owing to the small extent of its fronts, and to two faces being altogether without a covered way, is, perhaps, as strong as a square Fort of this size could be made, under any system of fortifi cation ; and the arrangement of the traverses, the glacis, and the clear esplanade around it, seem to warrant the conclusion, drawn by the Engineer who conducted the siege, that others than Natives must have assisted in building it. Fortunately the soil was favourable for the operations, which the Engineer had the bold ness, with such means as he possessed, to conceive, and to carry into execution. It must be confessed, that few would have ventured, with only 70 men as a working party, of whom but a small proportion knew any thing of the N"], [220, "SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. 194 CHAP V. ---\u25a0--\u25a0S---W' 1819 requisite duties, to attempt to crown the glacis, with a sap; but no operation, less efficient than this, would, with an enemy so resolute as the Garrison of Nowa proved themselves to be, have effected the reduction of the Fort; and although his progress was necessarily slow, the event fully justified the daring mode of proceeding, adopted by the Engineer. The siege of Nowa indeed deserves, in its general features, to be held forth as a model of universal practice, and the objection which has been hitherto raised to operations of this kind, that they consume more time, than can commonly be spared for sieges in India,* is proved to be altogether futile. The first ground was broken on the I Oth, and the place was stormed on the 31st, and this period might have been much shortened, if the Engineer had had the assistance of an efficient Department, and if the parallel, which appears to have been much more extensive than necessary, before a Fort, of which the front attacked wras only thirty-six yards, had been contracted ; but from the time that the first sap commenced, till the counterscarp w.is * The siege of Tanjore by General Smith, A.D. 1773, which was conducted by Colonel Ross, then Chief Engi neer, at which still more extensive parallels and approaches were carried on, and where the ditch was crossed by sap, was brought to a close in twenty-five days."], [221, "ATTACK OF NOWA. 195 CHAP V 1819 blown in, was only thirteen days under all the disadvantages of working with men, who had never before witnessed operations of the kind. The great extent of the parallel, which was from right to left no less than 1000 yards, appears the only objection, which can be offered ; if it had been reduced to half that extent, from (_/), to mid-way between battery No. 4, and the cavalier (c), there would have been ample space to embrace the whole front attacked, and to give cover to the whole guard of the trenches; and an approach of 100 yards from behind No. 4, would have placed the troops in their road to the trenches, under cover from the musketry of the Garrison. By this reduction, three or four days labour would have been saved. The South front, which is of as small extent, as the one attacked, is weaker, in being without a covered way, and if the attack had been directed against this front, the enemy would not have been able to sally on our lodgments, which, as it was, they twice effected. But the information, obtained on these points from Na tives, is always so imperfect, that the Engineer could not, without actual examination, which was of course impossible, have ascertained that this defect existed ; and perhaps the ground was so much more favourable for the N 2"], [222, "196 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY.

Nothing appears to have been overlooked, that could insure a successful result to the siege. The breach was not formed, till the mine that was to open a road to it, was ready for explosion ; and such was the consternation of the Garrison at this novel method of attack, that no resistance was offered by them, whilst our men were placing the ladders, which were required to mount the breach of the faussebray; although they had evidently determined to resist to the last, for many of our shells which had not exploded, and a quantity of 18lb. shot were found at the top of the breach, ready to hurl on the assailants when they should attempt to mount it. Indeed any further praise of these operations would be superfluous. The complete success which attended them, re sulting from no accident, and against an enemy as resolute to the last, as any we have en countered in India, forms in itself the highest encomium that could be passed. ATTACK OF COPAL DROOG. The works of Copal Droog are of extra ordinary magnitude and strength, and (as will appear by the plan) very complicated. The hill, which forms the upper Fort, is about 600 feet high above the plain, and is totally in accessible on threesides. The fourth, or Eastern"], [223, "ATTACK OF COPAL DROOG. 197 CHAP V 1819 side, is encircled with walls to the very base, where a strong rampart terminates the hill for tifications ; below which there are, on this side, two additional inclosures, each consisting ot a very respectable rampart with towers. The inner line of defence of these two embraces the hill in the form of an irregular semicircle, and is built of stone. The outer one is of mud, aud surrounds the former every where excepting at the East end, where the two ramparts are united. In approaching the lower Forts, cover is every where afforded, to within 350 yards of the walls, by the Pettah on one side, and by a range of rocks on the other. The main strength of the place is at the point D, on the hill, where the flight of steps, leading to the upper Fort, turns to the left, behind a rock ; and being completely hid from breaching guns, the pro gress of an enemy is checked by a gate, which presents itself, and where the assailants would be exposed on both sides to musketry, and to stones thrown from above.

The cover near the Fort was so excellent, that nothing remained but to throw up a parapet, at any point required, for which the Pioneers, Dooly Bearers, and Bamboo Coolies, were found to be quite sufficient. The breaching battery was sunk (in a ploughed field) in four hours, and the other batteries constructed with equal facility.

We have taken apparently without difficulty the formidable Hill Forts of India, Fortresses formed by nature, as if in proof of her superiority over the most laboured works of science ; whilst on the other hand, places on the plain, that would not delay an European Army, fully equipped for more than a week, have not only resisted our efforts with success ; but, in the opinion of the mass of mankind, who seldom look deeper than the surface, have even brought discredit on our military character. According to the plan laid down in the introductory Chapter, where the causes, which have led to such discordant results, have already been partially noticed, it now only remains to inquire more minutely into this question, and to consider the best mode of avoiding similar disasters, in the event of future wars in the East."], [231, "REMARKS ON THE HILL FORTS. 205 CHAP, VI 1819 In regard to the Hill Forts of India, I shall again most pointedly repeat the opinion ex pressed or implied in former parts of this work, that many of them, if properly defended, may be considered absolutely impregnable. Those vast precipices of lofty granite may equally bid defiance to the battering Gun, and to the Mine, the latter of which, Vauban the great master of the Art of Sieges, recommends as the most powerful agent for the attack of mountain Fortresses. And in fact there seems no certain mode of reducing them, if vigorously defended, but the tedious opera tion of strict blockade. Having given such a character of these Fortresses, it may be asked, from what cause or by what means we came to reduce the whole of them with such facility, in the late war? The reader will have observed, that the mode of proceeding always adopted, was to occupy without delay one or more positions as close to the rock as possible ; and to carry up field pieces to the spot by hand. This plan of operation was purposely recommended by the enterprising and skilful Engineer employed with Lieutenant-Coionel M'Dowall's Division, in the hope of intimidating the defenders, at the same time that he officially stated his opinion, that if this attempt at working upon their minds by a show of vigour should fail, the cap-"], [232, "206 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY.

The Commanders and their Garrisons were perfectly aware, that the Peishwah had been totally defeated, and that the state of his affairs was absolutely hopeless. They could therefore entertain no rational prospect of re trieving their Master's fortunes, by a determined opposition to the British arms, which eventually might be injurious or even ruinous to them selves. Under such impressions, it is more than probable, that they only waited for the opening of the first battery, to afford them a decent pretext for surrendering.'!' * See the Report of the Commanding Engineer on the Fortress of Rajdeir (Page 92). t In former wars we have had similar instances of success against such places, especially in the war of 1791 against the Mahomedan Dynasty of Mysore, when three of the strongest Hill Forts of that Country, Nundydroog, Severn droog, and Ootradroag, were successively carried, the two former by storm, the latter by escalade.

On the other hand, it is proper to notice the repulses we received in the two successive attacks of Kistnagherry, in 1789 and 1791, which in both instances, were effected by simply rolling down stones and large masses of granite on the assailants. * It frequently occurs that some of the lower lines of works of the Indian Hill Forts afford cover to the storming party, even as far as the very foot of the breach, as was the case at Dindigul in 1791, and at Vellore when besieged by Hyder's Troops, in 1781. At the last mentioned place, the besiegers, having been repulsed in their attempt to storm the breach, began to fill up the ditch with fascines, and as it was not flanked, the Garrison were unable to impede them in this operation, until Lieutenant Parr, the acting Engineer, descended with a party of men by Ihe ladders, which had been placed by the assailants, and drove them out of the ditch by the bayonet. t When the Artillery of the Garrison can be kept under, the old expedient, described in the common elementary"], [234, "208 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS- ARMY.

After admitting the extraordinary strength of the Hill Forts of India, I shall observe, that the Fortresses on the plain may be pronounced exceedingly weak, and that the result of our operations against them ought to be certain, beyond every other kind of warfare. In Europe, so much has the science of attack and defence been studied, and to such efficiency has the Engineer Department in most services been brought, that even the number of days to be consumed in a siege may be calculated, with some degree of accuracy, and a failure against the strongest places, however bravely defended, seldom occurs, except from uncontrolable causes. In India, the duration of a siege de pends on the bravery displayed by the Garri son ; and although instances of Native Forts being resolutely defended, are comparatively rare ; yet, when so defended, it is impossible to say how long we may be detained, or how many reverses we may experience. Wheuce writers on the attack of Fortified Places, of Chandeliers, or wooden frames filled with fascines, may be used to advan tage, as was done by Hyder's French Engineers at the Siege of Vellore, in 1781, who, by means of these, carried part of their approaches to within 20 yards of the walls."], [235, "GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 209 CHAP VI 1819 then do these different results arise? Is it, because the Forts in India are stronger ? On the contrary, both from the general description of them, which was given in the Introductory Chapter, aud from the special descriptions of those besieged in the late war, as contained in the body of this Work, it will be evident, that they are much weaker than those of Europe. Is it, because the Garrisons are composed of braver or better men than ourselves ? Undoubt edly not, for they have never been able to resist us in the open field. It must therefore be, that greater skill and superior means have been directed against European Fortresses. Now, although we are not disposed to admit that the Company's Engineers of the present day, are deficient in that degree of science, which is necessary forconductingsuch operations,* they * In the early wars, which took place between the English and French on the coast of Coromandel, it must be admitted that the superiority in the method of conducting sieges, evidently lay with the latter, for although no details are given, we read constantly of their having carried on their approaches in a respectable manner. In the English attacks on fortified places, there was, on the contrary, a marked want of science, with the exception of one or two rare instances, creditable to men of superior talent. At the sieges of Ariancopang and Pondicherry, attacked by us, in 1748, Orme expressly ascribes the failure that took place, to the incapacity of the Engineers, who, according to his account, were utterly un qualified for the enterprize. o"], [236, "210 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY.

Owing to the lamentable want of means alluded to, instead of working up to the breach by sap, with comparative safety to our own troops, and with a well grounded confidence of overcoming every intervening obstacle, by a method leading to certain success ; we have generally, in our sieges, effected breaches in the body of the place by means of distant batteries, and marched to the assault, over the inter mediate space, like Mahommedan Fatalists, apparently without considering, or at all events leaving to providence, how the ditches and untouched walls between the outer works and the breach were to be passed. Hence, a vicious system has been adopted, uncertain and hazardous in the extreme; and from the want of all experience of a more perfect mode, the great body, composing the Military Public in India, have scarcely even contemplated the pro priety of resorting to a more judicious mode of attack. In fact, on many occasions, it has been usual to attack the enemy's Fortresses by sudden assault, in preference to going through the cere mony of opening even a common battery."], [237, "SYSTEM OF BLOWING OPEN GATES. 211 CHAP VI 1819 Nay, to such a degree has this rage for pre- cipitate measures been carried, that, the only former Author, who writes professedly on the Attack of Indian Fortresses, has recommeuded the method of blowing open the gates of a large well garrisoned Fortress, with a gun in broad day light, in preference to besieging it* He mentions some instances, in which this extra- ordinary mode of attack has succeeded, and I am aware that many similar ones might be added; but we shall find in the numerous in- stances, in which it has failed, abundant reason for not adopting too hastily, as a general rule, a method, the success of which, I do not scruple to say, depends entirely upon the Garrison being devoid of common resolution, and of com mon sense, f It would swell the present Volume too much, to enumerate all the varieties of fortune, by * By way of example, he states his opinion, that this mode of attack would have insured the capture of Bhurtpoor. t The Natives often build up the gateway, which renders the blowing it open with a gun impracticable.

Ten or eleven shots were fired, before that was blown open, after which the assailants crept in, one man at a time, and succeeded in taking the place, having previously sustained a considerable loss by the enemy's fire, whilst their progress was stopped at the wicket. This attack was made at noon-day. o 2"], [238, "SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. 212 CHAP VI 1819 which those headstrong assaults have been attended ; but the attempt to blow open the gates of the fortified Pagoda of Chillambaram, in 178 I, affords too striking an example, to be passed over in silence, of the ease with which such attempts may be repulsed, by a little judgement on the part of the besieged. The attack on this post was made at night, with four battalions of Sepoys, 2 twelve-pounders, 4 six-pounders, and 2 howitzers, under the per sonal command of Sir Eyre Coote. The Pettah and the gate of a second inclosure, which surrounded the place, at the distance of 100 vards, were immediately carried. After AV ' * this, it was necessary to force open three more gates, strengthened by intermediate traverses, before the body of the place could be entered. The troops succeeded in breaking through the two first of these, but the space between the second and the third (or inner) gate, which was commanded by the ramparts of the body of the place, was filled with thatched huts ; and a few lighted portfires dropped on these from above, assisted by bundles of straw, and jars of oil, thrown down to increase the conflagration, formed a barrier, which it was found impossible lo pass ; so that the assailants were obliged to retreat with great loss, leaving a gun behind them. It is to be observed, that although the Author"], [239, "OF ATTACKS BY ESCALADE. 213 alluded to describes the gateway as the weakest CHAP. point ill the Native Fortresses of Hindostan, VL this is far from being the case, on the Western 1819 side of India, when the gates are always very intricate and numerous, and they are also (at least the interior ones) the only parts, where any attention appears to be paid to a flanking defence; and if occasional success in any method of attack be sufficient to recommend it for general adoption, the Native way of breaking open a gate with an Elephant, which was prac tised by ourselves in two instances in the late war,* possesses equal claims to such distinc tion. An escalade is equally objectionable as a general system, but as a coup de main, is more likely to succeed than the former method ; for an enemy may be taken by surprise, and his attention distracted from the real point of attack ; which is impossible, when agate is to be blown open.

An attempt at surprise, however, which is essential to the success of an escalade, or of any other coup de main may be frustrated by the slightest accident. The escalade of Ma dura, in 1757, although admirably planned, was repulsed through the barking of a dog, which alarmed the garrison.* * If the defenders are aware of the point, which is to be assailed, success can hardly be expected. The attack on Bobilee by the French, under Monsieur Bussy, in 1757, whilst it proves this, exhibits the Native Indian character in such an extraordinary light, that I shall, perhaps, be pardoned for introducing it. This was a petty square Fort, with a round tower at each angle, having its walls only 20 feet high, with a rampart of 12 feet, and was garrisoned by 250 Polygars. The French attacked it with a force of 750 Europeans, and 1100 Peons, divided it into four bodies, with a field-piece attached to each. They commenced their operations at daybreak. By nine o'clock, the field-pieces had battered the parapet, which was only 3 feet thick, sufficiently to admit of the scaling ladders being applied. After vainly attempting for an hour to mount by them, the attack ceased till the breaches of the parapet were increased. Another attempt was then made, but proved as fruitless as the first ; and at two o'clock, not a man having been able to mount the rampart, a second cessation was ordered. At this period, the Polygar Chieftain despairing of success, sum moned his brave followers, and represented to them the only alternative, by which their wives and families could be saved from dishonour. This cruel measure was instantly acted"], [241, "215 OF ATTACKS BY MINING. CHAP VI. 1819 If, from want of time for carrying on regular operations, or from other circumstances, a coup de main be considered necessary, and such I am aware will often be the case; mining, where there is only one line of works, and those of mud, appears to me preferable to any of the methods which have been in general use ; as being equally expeditious, more certain, and less hazardous to the assailants.' In blowing open a gate, or in an escalade, the exposure of a number of troops is indispensable.* In min ing, the work is done by two or three, nor are they in much danger, for, a miner working in front of a tower, could not be touched by mus ketry ;t and a small mantlet, placed against it upon ; and the whole of the women and children were sacri ficed to these high but mistaken notions of honour. During this tragic scene, the assailants took advantage of the absence of those men who were employed in it, and forced their way into the place, where the Garrison disdaining to accept of quarter, continued their resistance, until every man was put to the sword. * The best and bravest men in an Army are generally most exposed in this sort of service. The success at the gate of Bangalore, in 1794, one of the most important of the kind ever gained, was dearly purchased by the life of Colonel Moorhouse, who fell on that occasion. At the attack of the gateway of the Pagoda, of Conjeveram, in 1759, to which there were no gates, and which was defended only by a small ravelin, thrown up by the French before it, no less than four Officers were killed and five wounded by one discharge of a gun, after the assailants had carried the ravelin. t The Author had an opportunity of ascertaining this, at"], [242, "SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. 216 CHAP VI 1819 at a sufficient angle, would protect him from stones or other missiles from above, till he had lodged himself in the work, where he would be perfectly secure from any annoyance but that of sallies, which, of course, covering parties would be so placed, as to prevent; and, with workmen at all expert in mining, the whole might be effected in one night. The only in stance, which I can find of this having been attempted, was in 1752, at the Pagoda of Velore, in the neighbourhood of Trichinopoly, and where it was completely successful. The walls of this Pagoda were of stone, and a large gateway was built up with mud, to prevent it from being blown open. A small party of Eu ropeans, having marched in a dark night, con cealed themselves in a neighbouring water course ; and one man having advanced, dug un der the wicket, which was left in the gate, and having placed a barrel of powder in the cham ber he formed there, the explosion brought the Siege of Malligaum, where he sat with a European, and three or four Pioneers, for half an hour in broad daylight, in front of one of the towers, against which scaling ladders had been reared for the escalade of the outer work, on the Pettah side. The enemy could not see the party to dislodge them with musketry, and the ladders being placed at au angle, and covering them, warded off the stones which were thrown from above.

He observes, that the arguments in favour of such rash at tempts, when thoroughly analyzed, do not merit the smallest attention : that if they be discussed by a due consideration of the means necessary for carrying them into effect, and of the difficulties which oppose their success, they usually evaporate, without leaving in the crucible any other deposit, than the caput mor tuum, of the ignorance and folly of the pro poser.-j\" The Author of the Observations on the At tack of Mud Forts in India, to whose Work 1 * Talneir, the attack of which, has led to so much dis cussion, and where we lost so many Officers, might certainly have been taken by the method I have here suggested.

This simple fact speaks volumes as to the necessity of some improvement, whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the peculiar plan that ought lo be adopted. The same Work contains several useful sug gestions, in one of which I entirely agree with him, as to the expediency of introducing the use of hand grenades, which are at present almost unknown in India.* Having allowed this Author the merit to which he is justly entitled, I must now enter upon the less pleasing task of pointing out his errors.

I apprehend not. The parapets of such works are often 7 feet high, from which if 3 feet be taken, 4 feet will remain, a height which affords cover more than sufficient to defeat his object. N ow if we suppose that 4 feet of para pet are to be destroyed instead of 3, and with this slight alteration, take every other dimen sion stated by the Author for correct, his gun platforms will require to be elevated 25 feet above the natural ground ; but if it be sup posed that 5 feet are to be destroyed, they will require an elevation of no less than 30 feet above that level. Moreover, in all cases, these batteries must be protected by a parapet of at least 7 feet high. Hence by adopting such a system, an Engineer would have to undertake a battery of from 21 to 32 and 37 feet, in total height, in proportion as he might find it neces-"], [247, "SYSTEM OF THE AUTHOR ON MUD FORTS. 221 CHAP VI 1819 sary to destroy 3, 4, or 5 feet of the Rounee parapet. Thus the plan of the Author alluded to will not bear being looked into in detail, since it involves works of such enormous magnitude, as may be compared with the great mounds or cavaliers raised bv the ancients in their sieges; and the execution of which would waste a quantity of time and labour, that could ill be spared, and might, be much better employed, at such an interesting period of the operations.* After destroying the rounee wall by these immense cavalier batteries, the Author pro poses to storm the place by means of flying * This method of attack has been actually attempted by the Natives of India, particularly at the siege of Tellicherry, in 1782, conducted by one of Hyder's Generals, who after several vain attempts in the usual style of attack, constructed a cavalier battery of the nature alluded to. It was formed with trunks of trees and earth rammed between the intervals, with guns at the top, which were elevated to a sufficient height to overlook the place. The fate of this particular work is not recorded ; but as the siege was afterwards raised, and most of the besiegers with their guns, taken in a sally by the Garrison, it is fair to conclude, that it was not found to answer the end proposed. Another example of this mode of attack occurred about 30 years before, when Clive was besieged in Arcot by Chunda Saib. A house in I lie Pettah, near the rampart, served as the base of a mound, which was made by the be siegers, sufficiently high to see into every part of the Fort.

Any person conversant with the practice of me chanics, will undoubtedly pronounce this scheme to be perfectly impracticable, unless the Garrison will consent to remain passive and unconcerned, whilst the besiegers are working at their ropes, to get the various parts of this complex machine, into the proposed positions. Having thus stated the defective system that has usually been followed by us in the attack of Fortresses in India, and exposed the errors, of the only Writer, who has heretofore con sidered the subject,* the reader will naturally expect me to substitute something better. For tunately the task is far from difficult, and involves nothing doubtful, nothing experimen tal, nothing, that properly speaking, can even be considered new. All that is required re solves itself into two heads.

Secondly, to organize the Engineer Depart ment of each Presidency in India, in such a manner, as to enable the Officers to act upon the above system, with a fair and reasonable hope of success, which has not hitherto been the case. This again involves no new or untried idea. It merely requires these Officers to be assisted by a body of Engineer soldiers, trained to the field duties of their Department; and no Army in Europe, excepting perhaps the Turks, is unprovided with a Corps of this kind, which, in most services, is considered the most valuable, and distinguished species of Infantry.

At this period of the siege, the peculiar nature of the exterior line of works first begins to influence the operations. Some Indian For tresses have a glacis in front of the main ditch, as at Nowa, which had also a partial or imper fect covered way. From the statement of the Author on the attack of Mud Forts before quoted, it appears that most of the Native Fortresses of Hindostan, are provided with a glacis, in the manner now under consideration. In the attack of these, the practice of crown ing the crest of the glacis by sap, must be followed as in Europe, and batteries may be constructed there for the purpose of breaching the low faussebray or rounee wall, which almost invariably surrounds the principal rampart of the body of the place. It is possible, how ever, that batteries, so placed on the crest of the glacis, and firing across a very deep and narrow ditch, may not be able to bear sufficient ly low, to effect a practicable breach in the scarp revetment of the faussebray. In this case, therefore, it may sometimes be proper to blow in the counterscarp and part of the"], [253, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 227 CHAP VII. glacis by mining, in order to lay open the faus sebray to the fire of batteries, placed in a more retired situation on the glacis. If on the contrary, the Fortress besieged should have no glacis, but an exterior inclo sure, consisting of a simple rampart, beyond the faussebray and the main ditch, as at Malli gaum, the mode of proceeding must be some what different. Whilst the sap is advancing towards this rampart, which is usually of mo derate height, and constructed of mud, Miners must be sent forward, to lodge themselves in the lower or solid part of three or four of the prin cipal towers, in which they will prepare cham bers for blowing them up. But if this rampart should be built with solid masonry, then instead of attaching the miners to the wall at once, it may be necessary to commence the mines requisite for the demolition of the towers, by means of galleries carried under the level of the foundation. On the explosion of the mines thus prepared, troops must be in readi ness to move forward immediately, and occupy the exterior line of works of the Fortress, which will then be laid completely open to assault, and from which, in all probability, the enemy will retire, without waiting the issue of a personal conflict. This will form an ex cellent parallel for the ulterior operations, provided that in certain parts of it a parapet p 2"], [254, "SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. 228 CHAP VII. be formed on the reverse of the terreplein towards the enemy, either by taking down the original parapet, and turning it, as it were, inside out, or otherwise. The next consideration is the passage of the ditch, and the formation of a practicable breach in the rounee wall, for which purpose, if the exterior rampart, now supposed to be in the possession of the assailants, should be too near to the counterscarp, to admit of a breaching battery being placed in the interval, it must be cleared away by mines, fired for this express purpose. If on the contrary there should be a considerable space of ground intervening, this space must be occupied, and the sap extended to thebrink of the ditch, and a proper breaching battery established, in the same manner, as was before described, in treating of the attack of the simple glacis, or counterscarp. It is possible, however, that under peculiar circumstances, it may not appear advisable to attempt to breach the faussebray by battering guns. In this case, galleries for the descent of the ditch must be excavated, and the counter scarp revetment pierced, after which the pas sage of the ditch must be executed by sap, and the rounee wall or scarp-revetment of the faussebray must be breached by parties of Miners, pushed forward for that purpose. At the same time, a battery must be constructed"], [255, "229 CONCLUDING CHAPTER. CHAP VII. to breach also the high interior line of defence or principal rampart of the body of the place, immediately above the breaches in the fausse bray ; and mines must be prepared to blow in the counterscarp opposite to these breaches.* The explosions should be so timed, as to take place, as soon as the breaches in the body of the place are practicable, but not before ; and the storming party must be in readiness to push forward across the ruins, the very moment that these are fired, as was done at Nowa, where the explosion of the mines was the sig nal of assault. These operations, perilous and difficult to men ignorant of such duties, are easy of execution to properly trained Sappers and Miners, as has been proved by the nu merous sieges of Europe, where the deep and broad ditches of well flanked Fortresses have * The quantity of powder to be used in these mines will depend upon the nature of the counterscarp, and also upon whether it is reveted. The ditches of Native For tresses are frequently without revetments ; for the earth in some parts of India is of great tenacity, and notwithstanding the heavy periodical rains, it will stand at a much less slope, than in Europe. The Author remembers the ditches of Berwanee, a Fortress on the South bank of the Nerbudda, which had been formed several years, and to which, from the inquiries he made, he found that no great attention was paid, and yet they were standing in very tolerable order, at a slope of about one fourth. He could not discover, whether the earth had been prepared in the first instance, to enable it to resist the effects of the weather, and to preserve its slope."], [256, "230 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP VII. been passed, and their scarp revetments breached by mining, in spite of all the efforts of defenders, much excelling the Natives of India in discipline and military skill, and cer tainly not inferior to them in personal courage. To pretend, like the Author of the Book on Mud Forts, before quoted, that the same pro cess could not be applied, with at least equal success, to the passage of the imperfectly flanked ditches of the rude fortifications of the Natives of India, is, I conceive, a most glaring and pernicious error, that could only have arisen from the limited experience of the irre gular sieges, and vicious system of attack, of which that Author was a witness. Having thus briefly described a mode of attack, which by taking advantage of the de fects of the Indian system of fortifying, and by bringing into play the science and experience attained by Europeans in the art of sieges, would place the reduction of the strongest Na tive Fortresses beyond the power of chance, and would render unavailing the most des perate valour and the greatest exertions of their Garrisons ; before I proceed to another branch of my subject, it may be proper to notice some points already treated of, a little more in detail. First, in regard to the proper distance for breachingbatteries,itmayberemarked,thateven"], [257, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 231 CHAP VII. --\u25a0^-5-W when they are not from circumstances obliged to be advanced to the crest of the glacis, or to the counterscarp, I should not recommend them to be established at more than 150 yards from the wall, that is to be battered. At the siege of Chingleput, in 1752, four twenty-four-pounders at 500 yards distance, were found to have no effect. At 200 yards, a practicable breach was afterwards made with the same guns, both in the outer and inner walls, in the space of four days, and had the distance been still further di minished to about 100 yards, the breach would in all probability have been effected in half that time. If the ramparts of an Indian Fortress are of stone, the curtain should generally be battered in preference to the towers, as the shot are apt to be reflected from the latter, owing to their circular form, and the hardness of the material of which they are built. The propriety of this rule was exemplified in a re markable way at the siege of Palghaut, in 1781, where the besiegers in vain attempted to breach one of the round towers of the Fort, which was composed of very large blocks of granite, laid in the manner technically called \"headers,\" in architecture, so as to present their ends, not their sides, to the shot. In 1790, when the Fort was again attacked, one of the curtains was breached in a few hours. If all the works of a Fort be constructed of"], [258, "232 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP VII mud, the breaches in each inclosure or line of defence will be better and more quickly effected by mining, than by battering guns, for such is the nature of these earthen revetments, that the shot bury and lodge themselves in the mud, without bringing it down. Live shells, the effect of which against earthen works, has been proved in Europe to be much greater than that of shot, may also be used to advantage; but it may justly be asserted, that there is no country in the world, in which mining may be used for the purposes of attack, to so much advantage as in India, where the ill flanked outline enables the Miner to lodge himself at once, in the face of the rampart, without the necessity of approach ing it by subterraneous galleries, and where the mud, of which the works are composed, is soft enough to be penetrated with ease, and yet of sufficient tenacity to stand without woodwork of any description.* Captain Coventry, of the Madras Engineers, tried an interesting experiment, connected with this subject, in the year 1818, at Aniul neir. It was his intention, in the attack of that Fort, to have breached the rampart by mining; but as the place surrendered without resistance, * This would of course render the progress of the Miner more expeditious, than in soil, where regular mine frames and sheeting are necessary, in which the work proceeds seldom faster than at the average rate of one foot per hour."], [259, "233 CONCLUDING CHAPTER. he resolved, on receiving an order to destroy the CHAP. works, to put to the test, the plan of operation, that he had previously determined to pursue, if the place had stood a siege. Accordingly he ran a gallery under one of the circular towers, and placed 1 100 lbs. of powder in the chamber, the line of least resistance being 22 feet : and although the powder was of inferior quality, being made by the the effect of the explosion was very considerable, throwing down the whole of the tower, and a part of the adjacent curtain.* It may further be remarked, that it is better to effect, a breach by mining, than by battering guns, so far as regards the expenditure of shot, not so much, however, on account of the ex- * The Author of the Book on Mud Forts thinks Mininguse less as an agent of attack, because when it has been attempted he has seen it fail, the besiegers being twice effectually coun termined. Instead of this circumstance operating as a dis couragement, it ought to be an incentive to us, not to allow any of the Natives of India to excel us in so important a branch of the art of War. However expert the Natives of Hindostan, where that Author served, may have been in the practice of Mining, it is absolutely impossible, that their Chiefs could have directed them with the same science as the Company's Engineers, to whom they were opposed. If the latter had been at the head of a body of well trained Miners, the result of their labours must therefore have undoubtedly been success, instead of failure. In those parts of India, where I have served, the Natives have little or no knowledge of Mining."], [260, "SIEGES QF THE MADRAS ARMY. 234 CHAP VII pense,* as the difficulty of conveying a sufficient quantity of this most essential article of store. In regard to the best hour of storming a For tress, after practicable breaches are effected by the battering gun, or by the mine, opinions are divided. The morning, noon,f and nights * Even this is a matter of some consequence, if it be con sidered, that itmay require three months to convey the shot to the advanced Divisions, and that it may be a year more before they are used: that in the Madras service they are always transported on bullocks, each of which carries only 4 eighteen pound shot, and involves an expense of nearly five rupees a month, over and above the prime cost of the animal. Thus if the value of the shot, and of Sea carriage to India, be also taken into consideration, some idea may be formed of the sum, which every cannon ball costs the State before it is fired. There has generally been a deficiency of shot, especially towards the close of our sieges, when rewards, of from one quarter of a rupee to two rupees a piece, have been offered for the shot brought in, according to the exigencies of the service, and the number of camp followers, who may have been disposed to hazard their lives in this pur suit. It is remarkable, that at the siege of Asseerghur, Sir John Malcolm's Division carried away more shot than they brought with them, owing to the reward offered being a trifle higher, than in the other Divisions. t The storming of Seringapatam took place in the middle of the day ; but it appears that the unusual bustle of the prepara tions in the trenches, attracted the notice of several of Tippoo's principal Officers, who were fully aware of the intended assault, and requested him to prepare for it, but in vain; as a blind fatality seems to have characterized all his actions, towards the close of his life and reign. t Orme gives a strong opinion in favour of night attacks."], [261, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 235 CHAP VII. have each their advocates. For my part, I should be inclined to recommend as a general principle, subject however to such variations as local circumstances may require, to com mence the assault in the very early part of the morning, before there is sufficient light for the enemy to distinguish objects correctly. At this time, they will also have had the fatigue of watching all night, and to exhaust the Garrison the more, a false alarm in the course of the night may previously be resorted to. Had the advance to the storm at Malligaum taken place half an hour earlier, as was originally intended, there is reason to believe that many valuable lives might have been saved, and that the result might have been very different. I have thus attempted to describe a line of operations, which would place the reduction of the strongest Native Fortresses beyond the power of chance, and which by being grounded on the principle of taking advantage of the faults and inferiority of construction, observable After relating the extraordinary success of the French under Monsieur Bussy, in 1750, in the assault of Gingee, which was considered the strongest Hill Fort in the Carnatic, he observes, that \" had the attack been made in daylight, it \" could not have succeeded, for the Moors, as well as In \" dians, often defend themselves very obstinately behind \" strong walls, but it should seem that no advantage either of \" numbers or situation, can countervail the terror with which \" they are struck, when attacked at night."], [262, "236 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP, in the Oriental system of Fortification, and of VI1- bringing into play the science and experience attained by Europeans in the art of attack, would render unavailing and nugatory the most desperate valour, and the greatest exertions of their Garrisons. But with all the advantages, that this improved system of attack will un- doubtedly offer, it can never be expected, that it shall generally be acted upon in India, until the Army of each Presidency shall be provided with the proper means for carrying it into effect, with a fair prospect of success, which Theneces. has never yet been the case. This leads me to ingaCo.ps the consideration of the second improvement, IieerSoi- before-mentioned, namely, the necessity of hav attached ing a well trained Corps of Engineer Soldiers, to each of r l \u25a0 a * j j >i the com- or or men properly instructed and exercised Armies, beforehand, in all the operations of a siege, to assist the Engineer Officers in their arduous duties in the field. Of all the defects, that have hitherto led to those lamentable disasters, with which many of our Indian sieges have been attended, the want of such a Corps has been the most glaring and pernicious ; and if that defect be remedied, all the minor arrangements and improvements necessary will follow, as a matter of course. During the whole of the wars, that have hitherto been carried on in India, the Company's Engineer Officers have never had a man em-"], [263, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 237 CHAP VII. ployed under them, who understood before hand any one of the duties, which he was required to execute. Now, if we were told, that the Artillery of any Power consisted of a body of Officers, with an establishment of guns and stores, and sufficiently instructed in the theory of their duties, but who, instead of having a permanent Corps of skilful Gunners under their orders, were only supplied with men to fight their guns on the day of battle; and that they were under the necessity of teaching these men how to load, and fire, and to perform all the other necessary man\u0153uvres of Artillery, in the presence of the enemy ; every military man would naturally laugh at such an arrangement as the height of absurdity, and one that must lead to the certain loss of every action, in which the fire of Artil lery was of the smallest importance. Yet, absurd as it may appear, such is a correct picture of what has hitherto been the actual state of the Engineer Department of the Com pany's Armies. The only men generally avail able for the duties of that Department have been the Pioneers, and as these men have never been employed iu military works of this de scription, excepting upon actual service, it has been the hard fate of the Engineer Officers, to be obliged to teach them every thing that was to be done, either when exposed to fire, or at"], [264, "238 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP VII least when in the presence of the enemy, and thus to waste those precious moments when skill, energy, and activity, were most wanted, in the irksome and laborious drudgery of su perintending a multitude of little details, which in other services would be the duty of a Private, or, at the utmost, of a Corporal of Sappers. It is a fact, that in our sieges, the Officer of En gineers iu person, has often had to teach a Pioneer how to make a gabion or a fascine, and to stand over him in the execution of the work.* * It may be said, that the Pioneers, after having been em ployed in several successive sieges, must necessarily have acquired some portion of that skill, in which they were at first deficient, and on this plea it may be urged, that the character I have given of their inefficiency is too strong. In reply, I need scarcely suggest to the reflecting reader, that the know ledge thus acquired by some individuals out of a large body, without any systematic instruction beforehand, must neces sarily be of a most imperfect nature, and if there be no regular practice afterwards to perpetuate it, it must of course evapo rate almost instantaneously, and become lost to the service for ever. And, after all let us ask, what did the Pioneers actually do, or what did they learn in those sieges. Were they in the habit of crowning the counterscarp by sap ? No ! Did they ever work across a dry ditch, or fill up a wet one under fire? Never! Did they ever breach an enemy's scarp revetments by mining ? Never ! And yet these are the duties of Engineer Soldiers. Poor, indeed, would the Sapper and Miner be considered in Europe, whose skill like that of our most experienced Native Pioneers, extended no further than the making of a fascine and a gabion, and having some notion of the nature of a battery. By these observa-"], [265, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 239 CHAP VII. The confusion, the difficulties, the loss of time, and the consequent loss of lives, which have attended, and which necessarily must attend, such an imperfect mode of proceeding, may easily be conceived. Even in the first and simplest operations of an irregular siege, such as the construction of a portion of a parallel, with a common battery or two, these difficul ties have always been sufficient to exhaust the bodies, if they could not subdue the spirit of the Engineer Officers. What prospect of suc cess, therefore, could an Engineer have had in contemplating the long protracted labours, attending the ulterior operations of a regular siege, such as the execution of the sap under close musketry fire, without Sappers, and the execution of mines, without Miners? The prospect was certainly appaling, and unless the evils of which I now complain be remedied, tions, I am far from wishing to depreciate that respectable body of men. It has been their misfortune, not their fault, that they have been constantly called upon to perform duties in the field of a most difficult nature, for which they were not qualified, like other soldiers, by previous exercise and instruc tion. So far from blaming them, every Engineer who has witnessed their exertions, must admit that they deserve great credit for having shown so much zeal, under such very dis couraging circumstances. But the opinions of those Officers of the Army, for some there are, who maintain, that the pre sent Pioneers have always been a perfect model of a Military Working Corps, and equal to all the wants of the Service, cannot be too highly reprobated."], [266, "240 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP VII. in the event of new wars, very few Engineers indeed, however scientific or enlightened they may be, will venture to attempt much more than a small portion of a parallel, and a common breaching battery. For the bravest and most zealous men, will scarcely dare to incur the responsibility of recommending a regular siege, when they know that the Army has not the means of executing it with proper vigour, or even with a reasonable hope of success; and that from the general ignorance of such subjects, which unfortunately prevails amongst the Offi cers of the British Army, any failure that might happen afterwards would be ascribed, not to the want of means, which caused it, but, to the obstinacy of the Engineer, in proposing an impracticable mode of attack. It is true, that from time to time, some very strong-minded man may follow the just rules of the Art, and do his best, without adequate means, in spite of every difficulty, and regardless of the con sequences to his own reputation ; and it is not impossible, that an Engineer, acting upon such high-toned principles, may succeed : but instances of this kind are very rare indeed in the history of our Indian Campaigns. In the late war, the Siege of Nowa, conducted by Ensign Oliphant, is the only example of this nature; upon which it may be remarked, that if that enterprising and skilful Officer had been"], [267, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 241 CHAP VII provided with a body of properly trained Sap pers and Miners, the place might undoubtedly have been taken in half the time.* Another cause in some degree contributes to the inefficiency of the Engineer Department of the Company's Armies on actual service : that is the inadequacy of the Officers in point of numbers, arising from the various duties of a more civil nature, intrusted to their charge, and which leave but a very small proportion dis posable for the field. In the British Service, in * The siege of Tanjore, in 1773, was mentioned In a former note. That of Caroor, in 1760, in which the operations were conducted by Captain Richard Smith, is another in stance of an attack upon a similar principle, which also proved successful. The Fort was square, with a bastion at each angle, and square towers in the curtains, and had stone revetments, with a dry ditch, but no faussebray. In every bastion there was a cavalier, consisting of a round tower. Captain Smith commenced his attack by occupying the Pettah, which he connected by trenches with some mud buildings in front of it, which offered advantageous cover to the assailants on one side. From thence he pushed his approaches in the direction of one of the salient angles of the Fort, to within 40 yards of the ditch, when the enemy's musketry forced him to have recourse to the double sap, by means of which he reached, and crowned, the counterscarp, and sprung a mine, which blew the revetment into the ditch, after which the Garrison capitulated. The highest praise is due to the method, and perseverance, with which he brought this siege to a close, with men so very ignorant and inexperienced in such operations, that they were seven days and nights in completing about 200 yards of sap. Q"], [268, "\u00a342 CHAP VII. SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. other parts of the world, where the Corps of Royal Engineers is employed, ten or eleven officers are considered indispensable for a siege of the smallest magnitude, in order to furnish the necessary reliefs, and to provide for the nu merous casualties incident to this branch of service. But the number I have mentioned is equal to one-third of the whole Corps of Madras Engineers; and although the climate of India renders impossible such continued personal exertions, as may be made in Europe, and therefore would seem to require rather a greater number of Engineer Officers than other wise, for a service of a similar nature ; this cir cumstance has been so little attended to, that there have seldom been present at a siege in India, sufficient Engineers to furnish a proper relief.* * This remark is equally applicable to the Artillery Officers, of whom there never were sufficient employed in the same siege to furnish a relief: and at the Siege of Asseerghur in particular, the Officers of the Madras Artillery actually lived in the batteries, to which they were respectively attached. A large augmentation, however, which this Corps has received since that period, will, in all probability, prevent the recur rence of this inconvenience ; and indeed, the Engineers form the only branch of the Madras Army, which was not increas ed at the close of the Campaign, but was allowed to remain of the same strength as before our late accession of territory. A brief recapitulation of the effects of these operations, on the Officers employed, will place the utter inadequacy of the Corps to meet the exigencies of the Service, in a more strik-"], [269, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 243 CHAP VII. At the Sieges of Belgaum and other places in the Southern Mahratta Country, there were no professional Engineers present ; nor were there collected together at any time during the late campaigns, more than five; and at one period, four out of these five were disabled. But besides the usual duties of Engineer Offi cers during a siege, which ought to be those of general superintendence only, the labour of instructing the working parties, which is pecu liar to the Indian service, and which as I before remarked, ought to be the office of a Corporal or Private of Sappers, has also been thrown upon the Engineer Officers, so that they have actually been obliged to live entirely in the trenches, and to take food and sleep there, at such moments as they could snatch. These are not represented as hardships. It is not too much to say, that they have always been cheer fully born ; nor would such temporary incon veniencies be thought of, if the Engineer Officers ing point of view. Out of eleven Engineer Officers serving in the field with different Divisions, and at different times, during the war, two were killed, after having been both wounded on former occasions ; two died of fevers; three were wounded ; two were obliged to quit the field from illness, and have since been sent to sea for the recovery of their health ; and more recently Captain Coventry, who conducted the Siege of Asseerghur, has fallen a sacrifice to the repeated attacks of a fever, to which he became subject in consequence of that severe service.

But this has never been the case. Whilst their bodies have been harassed by unnecessary fatigues, their minds have been tormented by the anticipations of the failure of every operation of difficulty and importance, in which they have been engaged, owing to the want of properly instructed En gineer Soldiers, to assist them in their duties. I have, perhaps, said enough to convince every impartial and reflecting person of the necessity of this important improvement, being immediately adopted in our Indian Army. In one Presidency only (the Bengal Government), steps have actually been taken, for carrying this measure into effect, as was before remarked in the Introductory Chapter,* and it is to be hoped, that ere long this salutary example will be followed at the other Presidencies. If, however, any other grounds than its own merits were required to prove the advantage that would accrue to the State, from a better organ ization of the Engineer Department of our Indian Armies, recourse might be had toother examples for authority ; and the course pur sued by all the powers of Europe, with regard to this branch of their war equipments, might Jbe cited as a proof of the high importance that * See Page 18."], [271, "245 CONCLUDING CHAPTER. is attached to it. But without entering into a CHAP. detail of the Establishment adopted by any .Y**\\ other nation, I shall only remark, that towards the close of the Peninsular War, the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners in our own Service, consisted of no less than four Battalions of eight Companies each.* Let us now consider the objections, that are likely to be urged against this important im provement. To those, who assert, that as we have done without Engineer Soldiers hitherto, we may do without them still ; and who object to every change, however beneficial, merely be cause it is a change; no answer is necessary; for it is vain to oppose by argument, those opinions which haveno pretension to be founded upon reason, and which can only be resolved into a blind confidence of the continuance of that good fortune, which has so often be friended us in our Indian Sieges.

CHAP VII. vices may, as heretofore, be dispensed with: to this I shall briefly reply, that the same rea soning, if valid, would do away the Artillery, and indeed the whole of the Army, in time of Peace ; for a battle happens as seldom as a siege, and we ought to be as well prepared to meet the one as the other. Besides, let it be remembered, that it is not merely during a siege, that a Corps of this kind would be useful. They would also afford means for the military passage of rivers, the want of which is so much felt by every army, that attempts to move in India during the Monsoons, and although the parti cular organization and equipments most proper for this peculiar branch of the Engineer De partment, in reference to the nature of the Rivers in India, is too extensive a subject for me to enlarge upon in this Work,* yet I may * Every one who has marched with Horse Artillery guns in India during a Monsoon, must be struck with the difficulty, if not the impossibility, which would attend the transport of a Pontoon train on the European principle, sufficient for cross ing the largest Rivers of India, during the season, when it would be most required.

A similar equipment in India would require 600 of the country horses to transport it. Without attempting, therefore, to organize a Pontoon Train of such immense magnitude, it has occurred to me, that"], [273, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 247 CHAP VII. be permitted to advert to the perfection attained in this particular branch in the King's service, aud to express my hope, that the day may soon the following system might be substituted in lieu of it, which resolves itself into two distinct measures. First, In order to provide for the passage of Rivers of the first magnitude (of which there are not many), let a small fortified post be established as high up the River as possible, to serve as a depot for boats, wicker pontoons, casks, or other floating bodies fit for the purpose of military bridges, together with a sufficient proportion of all the other stores necessary for securing and forming the superstructure of the bridge. This arrangement being previously made, it will be obvious, that by moving the necessary stores down the stream, an efficient bridge may be established on any part of the River below the depot. The same course might, perhaps, be adopted in regard to Rivers of the second magnitude, such as the Taptee, Man gerah, &c. Secondly, The passage of all Rivers of any importance, being thus provided for, a small military bridge equipage might be carried with the army in the field, for the passage of the minor Rivers, and of Nullahs, which might also occa sionally be used, in aid of the materials from one of the depots, for the passage of the larger Rivers, if required. A travelling equipment of this nature might, perhaps, consist of seven or eight pontoons, of the most approved pattern, with the remainder of casks to be carried on camels. Eight of these useful animals might carry with ease, the casks, slings, braces, &c. for forming two complete piers, which are equivalent to an equal number of the old English tin pontoons, exclusive of the superstructure, which might be carried on store carts, to be drawn by bullocks, or horses, as may be found most expedient. The above suggestions are, of course, only the rough and"], [274, "SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. 248 CHAP VII. arrive, when the remark of the Principal Au thor of this improvement at home, namely, \" that the Officers and Men of the Royal En \" gineer Department, may enter into corapeti \" tion with the most expert Pontooners of any \" of the Continental nations,\"* will be equally applicable to the Engineer Departments of the Indian service. The principal objection, which in all pro bability will be urged against the proposed improvement, is the additional expense; but when the utility, or rather the indispensable necessity, of any measure is established, the expense becomes a secondary consideration. There are, however, many ad vantages to counter balance it. The better founded prospect of suc cess, the great savingof time and of lives, in every siege, and the consequent power of employing greater means against the enemy, in all other operation, in the course of each campaign. Take these circumstances into consideration. Estimate the value of the lives of the European Troops, so lavishly exposed under the present system ; together with the increased expen- crude outlines of a system, which practice and experience alone could bring to perfection. One preliminary, however, is indispensable for this, and for every other improvement in Engineering \u2014 a Corps of Soldiers to work with. * See the Preface to Lieut.-Colonel Pasley's Elementary Fortification, NoteC."], [275, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 249 diture occasioned by those failures, which CHAP. must necessarily arisefromthe want of Engineer VIL Soldiers : and the policy of havingsucha Corps will be admitted, even in an economical point of view. In Peace they may be employed to no less advantage, by following the example of the Royal Engineer Department, in which, so far as it can be done without injury to their efficiency, discipline, and instruction as Soldiers, they are made to assist in the exe cution of those public works and repairs, which are always going on under the direction of the Engineers, and which otherwise would be entirely performed by hired Artificers and La bourers, a set of men not much less expensive than a Military Corps in Peace, and not avail- able for the public Service, in time of War.

In France, Sapping, Mining, and Pontooning, are all distinct duties; and there are Battalions of Sappers, Companies of Miners, and Companies of Pontooners, each having their respective Officers, and limited to their own peculiar employments. On the great scale of Continental warfare, carried on by the vast Armies, that followed the banners of Na poleon, it is possible that no inconvenience * The idea of employing Half Casts (or the descendants of Europeans by Native mothers) is not original, having been suggested by Sir John Malcolm, in a letter addressed by him, in 1817, to Colonel Young, then Military Secretary to Lord Hastings ; and it has since been brought before the Madras Government in an official shape, by Major de Haviland, in a report made by him, as acting Chief Engineer, on the state of the Engineer Department of that Presidency."], [277, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 251 CHAP VII. may have resulted from that subdivision of labour; but it was justly considered, that in the British service, it would be preferable to have all the Soldiers of the Engineer Department disposable for the general duties of the Corps, without distinction : and, therefore, every man is equally instructed and exercised in Sapping, Mining, and Pontooning; so that in every part of the world, the exertions of every Company of the Corps may be commanded, in the man ner most useful to the State, according to the nature of the Service going on. A system, also, has been adopted in the Royal Sappers and Miners, of granting extra pay, called working pay, to the men, only on those days when they are employed in actual labour for the public Service, and in three several rates, in which they are classed according to their merit, which is estimated partly by their skill and exertions as workmen, and partly by their regularity and good conduct as Soldiers. This system seems no less worthy of imitation, for by duly pro portioning the mean rate of extra pay to the service performed, it involves no additional ex pense, but is of the highest utility by promoting emulation, and affording encouragement to de serving men, at the same time that it supersedes, in a great measure, the necessity of personal punishment, by acting as a powerful check to idleness and misconduct."], [278, "252 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP VII In urging the necessity of such an Establish ment, I have rested solely on the inconve niencies, we have experienced in being without it, in our receut Wars, in which we have always been the attacking power ; but the time may come, and the occurrences now taking place in Europe bring the question at least within the bounds of possibility, when we may be brought into collision with European Powers, and be obliged to fight, not for aggrandizement, but for preservation. It is not intended to argue this question, nor indeed is it introduced for any purpose, but to show, that if ever the day should arrive, when we find ourselves op posed to European science, the necessity of an efficient Engineer Department, whether for the defence of our maritime and other frontiers, or for attack, or for the passage of rivers, will become still more imperative. This idea may be thought visionary, and they who are unable to see, amid the calm which surrounds them, the presages of a storm, or the element of future convulsions, may think it ridiculous, now that Peace reigns throughout India, to prepare for wars, which may never happen, or which at all events they trust may be far distant; but let such short sighted persons at least remember, that Peace is the season for organizing an Army, and pre paring it for the hour of emergency. Let them also remember, that it is uncertain when that"], [279, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 253 CHAP VII. hour may arrive, or with what Power we may next have to contend ; and when it does arrive, if we are still unprovided with an efficient En gineer Department, greater losses, and more numerous reverses, will be experienced than heretofore ; for we must not always expect to be opposed to Powers as irresolute and igno rant of their own strength, as our enemies have proved themselves to be, in the last War. The experience of all ages should convince us of the contrary. Carthage was overcome on her own element, by an enemy, whom she at first de spised. In more modern times, Charles XII. with the finest and best disciplined army in the world, was overthrown at Pultowa, by men, who, but a few years before, had been a horde of barbarians, inferior to the Mahrattas of the present day, in military skill : and in some of the actions, that took place in our late Naval War with America, we have seen convincing examples of the fatal effects that may result, from holding an enemy too cheap. In reference to a former part of this Chapter, in treating of the operations of a siege, I pur posely avoided entering into any discussion of the duties of the Troops of the Line, in order to confine the undivided attention of the reader to other points, of more urgent importance. In fact, if the defects of the Engineer Department of our Indian Armies be removed, no difficulty"], [280, "254 SIEGES OF THE MADRAS ARMY. CHAP VII. will be found in employing the other troops, co-operating with them in a siege, to the utmost advantage.* The British Soldier is sure to sup port his character, and to preserve his superi ority in every part of the globe ; and as far as my experience goes, lam very far from joining in the desponding opinion of those, who anticipate our defeat, as soon as our Sepoys shall come in contact with European enemies.f On the con trary, I look forward with confidence to there suit, if the day should ever arrive, when they shall be drawn up to meet the hardy myriads of the North. I am convinced that it only requires Officers at their head, whom they love and * I cannot, however, forbear remarking the great advantage that might be derived in a siege from a small proportion of Riflemen; but as the Rifle Corps is not sufficiently large, and as it might not accord with its discipline to detach parties from it, to every place, where this kind of service is going on, perhaps a few select men in each Corps might be armed and practised with the rifle, which would ensure a certain number of Soldiers of this description, whenever they might be required. f Although the numerous instances on record of the high discipline, valour, and attachment to their Officers, evinced by our Sepoys, are sufficient to establish their military character, the hard-earned fame of our Native Army, has not been allowed to go undisputed; and one writer, in particular, goes so far as to urge the monstrous proposition, that those brave high minded men, the Natives of our Provinces, who live under the protection of our laws, and who in fighting for us, fight also for their own families and dearest interests, shall be ex changed for mercenary Arabs, and Malays."], [281, "CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 255 CHAP VII. esteem, for the Madras Native troops to follow to the most daring, or even desperate enter prises. In regard to their employment at sieges, I shall only observe, that notwithstanding the very high opinion I entertain of them, they appear to me, when acting singly, to be wanting in that confidence, and presence of mind, which is the characteristic of the British Soldier ; and therefore the advanced sentries thrown out from the covering parties at a siege, should be select Europeans, in preference to Sepoys.
