Pretty Polly Flowers, Shakspeare's Seven Ages, New Adventures of Major Longbow, A Bachelor leads an easy life PRETTY POLLY FLOWERS. 'Love me, love my dog,' they say; Miss Flowers would pat him, And was resolved to drive poor Towers away, By setting Towzer at him ! The butcher put her up to this, His love had got such powers, And got rewarded with a kiss, From pretty Polly Flowers, Sung by Mr. Latham at the Theatre Royal. Air \u2014 \" Cinderella.\" Most folks fall in love no doubt, Some time or other, 'Tis useless when the flame break out, .Trying it to smother; Cupid will have his way ; 'Tis very well known, his chief Pleasure by night and day, Is making o' mischief. Next time Mr. Towers came, She spoke more tender, He begun about his flame, Hop'd 'twould not offend her, Love had made him almost blind, So it turned out in the case Of Jeremiah Towers, Who fell in love with the charming face Of pretty Polly Flowers. He knew not her intention, 'Till Towzer's teeth had met behind, Where \u2014 I must not mention ; He raved, and stamp'd, and roar'dwith pain. His sweets were turn'd to sours ; He swore he'd never think again Of vile Polly Flowers. Jeremiah Towers, mark 1 When first he felt love's dizz'ness, Was a dapper active lawyer's clerk, Sticking tight to bus'ness, But Polly of his heart the thief; He walked about dejected, Melancholy, and in brief, His briefs were all neglected, All day long he long'd for night ; Impcll'd then by love's powers, He walk'd three miles to get a sight Of pretty Polly Flowers. Before the butcher's joy got cold, Jerry did indict him, As warning to both young and old, For making his dog bite him ; But most unfortunate of clerks ; 111 luck iu him was rooted, In court he could not shew his marks. And so he got non-suited, His love turn'd t6 a deep dtspair, He groan'd away the hours ; The butcher meantime got she fair, Polly had another beau, A butcher fat and greasy ; Which when Jerry came to kuow, He was not very easy. She told him (in the street,) With a look, which something arch meant, 'She prefer' d good solid meat, l'o dried up withered parchment.' He thought bis lease of life was out, Charming Polly Flowers.

In Drury-lane, some years ago, There liv'd a nice young man, His name was .Ice, and, you must know, His sweetheart's name was Fan : My name is Major Loqgbow, a wonder sure I am sir, I've lived on earth two hundred years, and never mean to die sir, Much he lov'd his pretty Fan, And much she lov'd Joe; He got drunk with another man, Vich caused a dismal go. Much he lov'd his pretty Fan, &c. For I'm so strong, just six feet long, In my pockets lots of bustle, When e'er I will, I'm sure to kill, So wond'rous in my muscle, That 'ere man vat made him drunk, He also lov'd Fan ; He long'd to press her in his arms, So for a press-gang ran, They came and took poor Joe on board; And then came on a shower ; Say Joe, 'I'm half seas over, sure, Though opposite the Tower.' They came and took poor Joe, &c. Tol de rol, &C. A gent one day, says he to me, 'In a Balloon will you go up sir?' Says I 'oh no, for I have walk'd ten times as high to sup sir ! On a mountain, stands a fountain, Where roast beef and pudding grew sir, I went up twice, cut many a slice, Upon my life its true 6ir, Fan to the Tender vent next day, All for to see her lover ; She render-hearted vas they say, And sich a kiss Joe guve her ; A nerry tender scene took place, Fan lamented Joe's fate, 'Oh, d\u2014 n this billing,' cries Sam Chase, ' Be off to Billing's-gate !\" A nerry tender scene, &c. Tol de rol, &c. While on this mountain's top I sat, I heard the bellman brawl sir, ' Good friends 1 pray, list, list I say, to-night's the governor's ball sir !' So off I set, all in a fret, For dancing's my delight sir, \u2022Twas three hundred miles o'er ditches, stiles, Joey, poor man, was sent to sea, A seaman he became, The vessel he sail'd in d'ye see, Was called the Mighty Fame, He/oremast-mastman at length was made, Vas/orepwiosf in the fight ; Vile fighting for his Fan, 'tis said, He lost his right/on-light. He forematt-mixa at length, eScc. But I was there at night sir. Tol de rol, &c. My skin's not penetrable, which perhaps you'll think a crammer, But once a man from the monument, on me let fall a hammer, Vhile thus the battle rag'd, poor Joe Vas vounded in the leg ; His comrades begg'd he'd go below, But he vudn't move a peg. The victory gained, the ship set sail, It had the prize in tow, But ere they Plymouth-jDocA had gain'd, They dockt the leg of Joe. The victory gained, the ship, &e. It bounded back, and in a crack, It mounted in the air sir, And the next day, the papers say Came down near Greenwich fair sir ! Tol de rol, &c. Again, once a duel fought, the ball it struck my snuffle O, But bounding back three hundred yards, it killed a good sized bussaloe, Fan his love, she had been true, So velcum'd her true-love; Though leg and eye were gone d'ye see, Her hand she to him guve. They married were, and they ware blest. Then may each Englishman, Who married is have such a vise I once did lay, that I could stay, Any vessel iu the ocean ! So with a cable, it is no fable, I stopt a steam-boat in full motion. Tol de rol, &c. As Joey's true love Fan ! They married were, and they, Sec.

Hark ! hark ! it is his step, it is my love ! It is \u2014 again my heart shhall prove The bliss that springs from anxious love. The moon-beam is shiniag bright, Heaven,, does it mock my sight ?

I JMiinj ul thu nnsisin fsiiiiwiniii itfiisiiMii There was a jolly miller once, Lived on the river Dee, He work'd, and sung, from morn till night, No 1 irk more blithe than he, And this tbe burthen of his song, For ever use'd to be, I care fur nobody no, not I, If nobody cares for me. 1 live by my mill God bless her, She is kindred, friend and wife ; I would not change my station here, For any other in life, Neither; Surgeon, Lawyer, or Doctor, Ever earned a groat by me, I care for nobody no, not I, If nobody cares for me. My heart o'erfiows with joy love, When I see thee near, Each pulse with rapture glows love, When thy voice I hear, And in thine angel smile love, Heaven appears to be, It is as free from guile love, It is as dear to me. O'ER WOODS AND WILDS. O'er woods and wilds I've wandered far, Dejected, faint and weary, But love was still my leading- star, 'Midst deserts dark and dreary; And were it still my f;;t, to roam, Each fi'iend I'd prove sincerely, And sigh for my own dear native home, And her I lov'd so dearly. When spring begins on its merry carreer, Oh ! how his heart goes gay, No summer's drutb alarms his fear, Nor winter's told decay, Nor foresight mar's the millers joys, Who's wont to sing and say, Let others toil from year to year, I live from day to day, 'Midst fertile groves, aud flon'ry vales, Where nature smil'd with gladness; Where zephyrs' blue, and flagrant gales, I have wanfer'd oft in sadness ; And were it still my fate to roam, Each friend I'd prize sincerely, And sigb for my own dear native home, And her I lov'd so dearly. Thus like thc miller bold and free, Let us rejoice ar.d sing, The days of youth arc made for glee, And time is on the wing. This song shall pass from me to' tbee, Along the jovial ring, And hearts and voice and all agree, To say God save thc King. CEASE YOUR FUNNING.
