(all pull off their hats but Rodolph) Never mind, I will not slight thee ; Come to-morrow, I invite thee. Grant to others something, pray ! Look at this, sir, eh, eh, eh. (pointing to the nosegay and star) How this star and flower adorn me. Now, what huntsman dares to scorn me ? So you lost the prize to-day ? So you miss'd it, eh, eh, eh ? Rodol.

It's dangerous to play with fire arms in that way, especially when one is not in the best of tempers. (Rodolph throws aside rifle) That's better ; now we can be cool and reasonable. Rodol. Cool ! Killian. Oh! I grant you there is good excuse for you, if your naturally sweet temper does get a little soured. When a keen forester, who is about to become the Prince's ranger, regularly misses a mark, while a poor stupid peasant like myself hits it three times running \u2014 the forester, you see, does cut such a very ridiculous figure ! Rodol. Another taunt, and I'll (draws knife) Killian. Now, now \u2014 don't use that knife ; it's an ugly tool, and might hurt. Point your gun again if you like ; for what you aim at you are pretty sure not to hit. Rodol. This is not to be borne, (rushes on Killian) Killian. Hallo! hallo! help! help! (Peasants sur round Rodolph) Enter Kuno followed by six Foresters with spears, l. u. e. Kuno. Eh ? what's all this ? The whole village against"], [13, "Act 1.] DER FREISCHUTZ. 7 one man ? Shameful ! (Foresters quietly disperse Peasants) Killian. Shameful! I like that. My friends are to stand still with their hands in their pockets, and see this madman cut my throat. Ah, if he was half as handy with his rifle as he is with his knife, you would swear he had a charmed bullet. Enter Caspar, l. Caspar. What do you mean by a charmed bullet ? Killian. Something that he has not got; for it always hits the mark, Master Caspar. Kuno. You don't mean to say that you have missed the mark, Rodolph ? (Rodolph turns aside sorrowfully) A pretty ranger you'll make. Caspar, (aside) Zamiel has been faithful. Killian. You see how it is. The world is not wise enough to put people to trades that suit their natural ability. I, the best shot among you all, intended by Dame Nature for a forester, every inch of me, I'm a peasant, and as bad a specimen of a tiller of the soil as you'll meet in a day's march. On the other hand, our friend Rodolph here, who doubtless would have made a first rate tailor \u2014 Rodol. A tailor ! \u2014 scoundrel ! Kuno. No more of this. You are the offender now at any rate, Master Killian. Caspar. Yes, yes, drop it \u2014 talk about something else, as talk you must. Suppose you tell us more clearly what you mean by a charmed bullet ? Kuno. Aye, do. I know all about it already, but it will serve to change the conversation. Killian. Well, most of you know the Wolf's Glen? Omnes. Aye, aye ! Killian. And when one of you happens unexpectedly to find himself near it, a little after nightfall, he puts his best foot forward. Now this same Wolfs Glen, they say is inhabited by Zamiel. Caspar. And who is Zamiel? Killian. Why, according to all accounts, Zamiel is a gentleman of very inconsistent habits. While he chooses"], [14, "[Act 1. 8 DER FREISCHUTZ. to live in an out-of-the-way place, as if he was afraid of being seen, he takes a fancy every now and then, to pop upon some one who is afraid of seeing him. Kuno. In short, he is neither more nor less than a dev \u2014 Villagers. Oh \u2014 h \u2014 h ! (shrinking) Kuno. Don't be frightened; even the devil is not so black as he is painted. Killian. There you are right, for Zamiel is not black at all ; he has a crimson face, crimson coat, crimson con tinuations, crimson cloak, and crimson boots I I wonder who was his tailor. Rodol. But about the bullets ? Killian. I'm coming to that all in good time. Hang it, you are not so handy with bullets, that you need be in such a hurry about them. Well, if anybody \u2014 so runs the story \u2014 goes to the Wolf's Glen on the night of the full moon, and casts seven bullets in the name of Zamiel, who will preside on the occasion Peasants. Well, what then? Killian. Patience, patience ! With six of these bullets he'll be able to hit any mark, however small or however distant ; but with the seventh there's a difficulty Caspar. That always misses, I suppose ! Killian. No, it does not miss. But instead of going where the marksman pleases, it obeys Zamiel's goodwill and pleasure, and Zamiel may direct it into strange places. Suppose, for instance, I was the owner of the seventh bullet, and I wished, when nobody was by, to kill a good fat buck \u2014 well, if Zamiel meant to overwhelm us all with grief, he would cause the bullet to hit our excellent ranger \u2014 if he meant to do neither good nor harm, he would wing this honest clumsy fellow, Rodolph, \u2014 if, on the other hand, he wished to make us all particularly happy, he would send the bullet through the skull of our ill-favoured friend, Caspar. Caspar. How ! Killian. How? Oh! I can't tell you how; that's his affair. Caspar. Now just hear, friend Killian. You are very fond of making your remarks on other people ; but you"], [15, "Act 1.] DER FREISCHUTZ. 9 don't seem to be aware that you stand in a very suspicious light yourself. You, a peasant, can hit a mark better than most huntsmen ; how are we to account for that ? except in the supposition that, you \u2014 you \u2014 you are in the habit of visiting the Wolf's Glen, (the Peasants shrink back from Killian) Killian. Here's a pretty moral to my tale ; here's a fine reward for amusing you with a cock and-bull story, that my grandmother used to tell me when I was a boy, that she might frighten me to sleep. Don't be stupid. (they shrink back, shaking their heads \u2014 Caspar laughs) Now, just listen \u2014 I'll clear myself at once. You must all be convinced that a man who visits the Wolfs Glen at midnight must have lots of pluck. (Peasants seem to consider among each other) Well now, do you think I am a man with lots of pluck ? Is that your opinion ? Peasants. No, no, no! Kuno. To do you justice, Killian, I'll own you are the most arrant coward in the district. Peasants. To be sure \u2014 to be sure, (they gather round Killian and shake his hands) Killian. (to Caspar triumphantly) There, see how a good character repels the shafts of calumny. Kuno. Enough of this. Keep up your spirits, Rodolph, you'll need all your coolness to-morrow. If at the trial you do not prove the best shot, you will never be the prince's ranger, and if you are not the prince's ranger, you'll never be a son-in-law of mine. Killian. Yes, keep up your spirits, friend. There is one point in your favour, you have immense room for improvement. Rodol. Oh, would there were no morrow for me ! Trio and Chorus. Rodol. Ob, how dark and dreary Will to-morrow o'er me rise ! Caspar. Now in thy rifle Future joy or sorrow lies. Rodol. How with fear I tremble least my aim should fail. Kuno. Nay, nay ; if thus you tremble \u2014 If thus all heart you lose, you certainly will fail."], [16, "[Act 1. 10 DER FREISCHUTZ. Caspar. Fear you must dissemble. Courage may prevail. Rodol. 'Tis vain to dissemble, Down-stricken I tremble, Oh, would the hour of death draw nigh ! Chorus. See, see, how wildly rolls his eye. Yield not thus to fruitless sorrow. Fortune may return to-morrow, Chasing every fear away. Rodol. What strange feeling fills me with dismay ? Should I lose the prize to-morrow, Life the loss could never bear. Kuno. Strength from Him above then borrow. Impious is this wild despair Heaven will hear the suppliant's prayer. Caspar. Loss to-day and luck to-morrow, Evening foul and morning fair ; Such is fortune everywhere. Kuno. Trust in heaven, 'tis sinful to despair. Chorus. Hurrah ! ere the first blush of morning, We'll hasten to welcome the day, All danger fearless scorning, Rejoicing to seek for our prey. Our bugles right merrily sounding, The echoes from yon mountain side, Shall give, while our free hearts are bounding, Our greetings to bridegroom and bride.

You look as if you intended to drown your sorrows in the bowl \u2014 not a bad plan, I have tried it myself and find it answer. Rodol. Pshaw! Killian. Come, shake hands, old fellow. You won't? Very well, as you please ; better luck next time. Now, friends, we who are not troubled with the blue devils can afford to start off merrily. Exit, with Peasants, l., waltzing. Rodol.

To be owner of a charmed bullet"], [17, "Act 1.] DER FREISCHUTZ. 11 when love and life depend on the marksman's skill, to feel immediate happiness within my grasp ! Could such a blessing be purchased at too high a price ? What has come to me of late ? Once no demon could have made my aim more sure. Once I was the pride and envy of my comrades, but now I am called upon to win and wear the beloved of my heart, I am the laughing-stock even of peasants! Oh, misery ! Grand Scena \u2014 Rodolph. Oh ! I can bear my fate no longer, \u2014 All hope is banish'd from my soul : In vain I strive \u2014 some power is stronger, And every feeling would control. Through the forest, through the meadow, Joy was wont with me to stray, While my rifle never failing, Everywhere secured a prey. Homeward I returned exulting, But ere home was yet in sight, Gentle Agnes came to meet me, Like a form of heavenly light. And am I now by heaven forsaken, (Zamiel crosses) Doomed to a life of endless woe, Or from despair shall I awaken, Will hope within my bosom glow ? Now I fancy at her lattice Lovely Agnes I can see, And she listens, fondly listens, While her thoughts are all on me. But in vain is all her listening, For her lover is not near, And the breeze that stirs the branches Mocking falls upon her ear. What power of darkness hovers o'er me ?

Caspar. And you saw me sneer at it ? Rodol. I believe I did. Caspar. And of course you concluded that I thought it a tissue of nonsense ? If so you are mistaken ; Killian never spoke such a large amount of truth in his life. There are such bullets, and they are to be obtained just in the way that he describes. Rodol. And with one of them a man would be sure Caspar. Sure of winning the prize of good marksman ship, even if that prize were Agnes ! Rodol. Don't irritate me, Caspar \u2014 no jest on that subject.

Yes, one don't see such an eagle every day \u2014 look at his claws ; and see how nicely you have hit him under the wing, not a feather damaged. Rodol. How did I do it? certainly not by any skill of my own. Caspar. There you are right : you killed this bird with one of those very bullets of which Killian was prating. Rodol. Ah ! a new life dawns upon me. Caspar, my friend, you have more of those bullets ; give me one, and command my gratitude for ever. Caspar. My dear fellow, I should be only too happy if it were in my power, but that bullet was the last of the seven. Rodol. The seventh bullet \u2014 the seventh ! guided by the will of the fiend, if the story be true. Horrible ! Caspar. I don't see any horror at all, my friend ; your will and the fiend's closely jumped together. Rodol. Why was the bullet wasted on this creature ? Why did you not reserve it till to-morrow ?

Then, he took no part in the contest? Killian. Yes, but he did though. Agnes. Then how was it that you won the prize ? Killian. The facts are simple enough.

See, see me kneeling meek and lowly, Yet do not cease that angry tone. That I have stray'd to paths unholy, By love misled, I freely own. Sire, those bullets cast by dead of night, Foul fiends bestowed, by fiends were guided right. Otto. (r. c.) Vile sorcerer! quit my sight for ever, Nor with thy presence taint my land. Think' st thou I can forgive thee? Never 1 Think not thou e'er canst win this maiden's hand. Rodol. (c.) My sentence spoken. My fond heart broken, (crosses to l.) Would that an early grave my shame could hide ! Kuno. (l. c.) Let clemency thy judgment guide. Ann. (c.) Have pity on yon weeping bride. Chorus. Oh, do not let us vainly sue ! His heart was ever good and true. Let clemency, &c. Otto. No, no, no ! Such deeds must not unpunished go. All supplication is in vain ; Hence, quit my sight, and ne'er return again. Enter the Hermit r. u. e. \u2014 the People draw back with reverence, Ottocar bares his head with the rest. Hermit. Shall weak and sinful man presume, His erring fellow mortal thus to doom ? Otto. I marvel much that holy as thou art, And in the robe of sanctity array'd ; Thou dost espouse this culprit's part. Do thou pronounce his doom thyself, thy will shall be obeyed. Hermit. Deign thou the voice of penitence to hear, For heaven regards the sinner's tear. As we through mercy hope to live. We should be ready to forgive."], [45, "Sc 3.] 39 DER FREISCHUTZ. Oh, Prince, thy clemency be pleased to shew, And pardon on this youth bestow. Otto. Yes, pardoned let him be ; Heaven finds a voice in thee. (Rodolph brings Agnes forward) Chorus. Hail, noble Prince ! long happy may'st thou live, 'Tis ever princely to forgive. Otto. I likewise promise that to-day This hand shall give the lovely bride away. Rodol. With this blessed angel ever near me, To evil thoughts I ne'er shall yield ; In heavy hours her voice will cheer me, And from impending danger shield. Otto, fy Hermit. As we through mercy hope to live, We should be ready to forgive. Ann fy Kuno. Forgotten be all sin and sorrow ; Contented, happy may you live ! Chorus. As we through mercy hope to live, We should be ready to forgive. Hermit. Now lift your hands and humbly kneeling, To Heaven who watches o'er us your grateful voices raise. Chorus. Yes, yes, our hearts and hands to heaven we raise, And Him, to whom praise belongs, do we praise. Omnes. To Heaven do we lift up our hearts and our voices In thanks for the mercy to penitence shown. Mercy, Heaven and earth rejoices, And best adorns the monarch's throne ! Curtain. Printed by Thomas Scott, Warwick Court, Holborn."], [46, "fT. H. Lact, Strand, London.
