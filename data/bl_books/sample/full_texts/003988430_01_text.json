BY LEIGH HUNT. WYCHERLEY. In collecting materials for the following lives, an eye has been had to the discovery of such additional facts, however small or even collateral in their interest, as might result from a diligent perusal of the works of the authors, and a reference to the literature of their age ; and, accordingly, some have been procured, which it is hoped will not be unwelcome to the lovers of genius and of books. The same wish to render the volume as complete as lay in the power of those concerned in it, has led also to the selection of such passages from the miscellaneous writings of the authors, as the editor, in the indulgence of a habit of that kind, felt an impulse to mark with his pen. Critical notices have been added to the biographical ; and, at the conclusion of the whole, a general estimate has been attempted of their comparative merits, together with some idea of the moral spirit in which they deserve to be read. WILLIAM WYCHERLEY, the earliest of these chiefs of our Prose Drama, was eldest son of Daniel Wycherley, Esquire, a gentleman of some property at Clive, near Shrewsbury, afterwards one of the tellers of the Exchequer ; and he was born in that village about the year 1640. His ancestors have been traced, as residents on the spot, as far back as the reign of Henry the Fourth; but we believe nothing has been known of the family since our Author's time. A correspondent of the \" Gentleman's Magazine,\" who in the year 1796 took the drawing of their house, from an engraving of which our vignette has been copied, says it had been a handsome structure, but left in great measure to go to decay, and the remainder clumsily turned into a farm-house. The walnut-tree in the print was said to have been planted by Wycherley, but he could not vouch for the truth of the report .* The future dramatist appears to have received the rudiments of education, either at home or in the neighbourhood ; and instead of going to the university at the early period of life then customary, probably owing to its heterodox condition under Cromwell, was sent at the age of fifteen, or thereabouts to the banks of the Charente in France, where he was introduced to the reigning circles of the Rambouillets and Montausiers, who converted him to the continental orthodoxy, or * Gentleman's Magazine, vols. lxxxi., lxxxii. h"], [20, "X BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. creed of the church of Rome. His theologian on the occasion, a natural one enough to a susceptible youth, is said to have been the Duchess de Montausier, better known to posterity as Julie d'Angennes, for whom the French poets composed the famous \" Garland ; \" or still better, as the Mademoiselle Rambouillet of the Menages and Voitures, the presiding divinity of the precieuse style of wit, which was bo pleasantly overthrown by Moliere. But the Duke her husband, the prototype of Moliere's \" Misanthrope,\" and consequently of Wycherley's own \" Plain Dealer,\" was himself a convert from the Huguenots ; for whose church, while he was only a younger brother, he had been educated ; and as he had that strong turn of his own for the didactic, which afterwards made him so severe a tutor to the Dauphin, it is not improbable, that although his wife had a singularly staid reputation for a leader of French fashions, and he himself was a most Grandisonian and self-satisfied personage, he would be no uninterested spectator of these enlightenments of the boudoir. On his return to England, our Author, at the Restoration, became a fellow-commoner of Queen's College, Oxford ; \" but wore not a gown,\" says Wood ; \" only lived in the Provost's lodgings, being entered in the public library under the title of Philosophise Studiosus, in July 1660 ; \" and ho departed, the same authority informs us, without being matriculated, or taking a degree ; though not without having been re-converted to the Protestant faith by Dr. afterwards Bishop Barlow, a shrewd casuist of those times, who contrived to keep his fellowship under the Puritans, though he had bantered their university proceedings in a pamphlet. We shall see, however, that this re-conversion was not our Author's last. On leaving college, he entered himself of the Middle Temple, probably with little or no intention of studying the law ; for according to the dates furnished by Pope, and repeated to him again and again by Wycherley himself, he must have written his first play, \" Love in a Wood,\" the year before he went to Oxford, when he was nineteen, and his second, the \" Gentleman Dancing-Master,\" the year after his arrival ; \u2014 proofs of earliness of production, common to dramatists of his class, and no less explanatory of much of their character and defects, than creditable to their natural genius. At twenty-five he wrote the \" Plain Dealer,\" which shows his acquaintance with courts of law ; and two-and-thirty was the date of his concluding play, the \" Country Wife ; \" by which time he had completed that intimacy with the town, which had weaned him alike from the huffish foppery and self-complacency of the \" young gentlemen \" of his first piece, and the equally mistaken, though sincerer, endeavour to be misanthropic in the second ; leaving him, he thought, a shrewd, solid, and modest superiority to both, in the quiet impudence of the character of Horner. If Wycherley did not speak laxly of these dates to Pope, or imply a completeness in their composition which only resulted from subsequent handling, none of his plays appeared either on the stage or in print till some years after they were written. When finally collected into a volume, or at least in one of the single-volume editions of the booksellers, their chronological order was reversed. The earliest was put last, and the \" Country Wife \" first; doubtless in consideration of what was held to be most attractive.* It is curious to think of the young theological proselyte returning to England, only to plunge into gay company and the playhouses, and write his comedy of \" Love in a Wood.\" He goes in like manner to the university to be made a Protestant, and compose the \" Gentleman Dancing-Master.\" * \"The chronology of Wycherley's plays I am well acquainted with,44 says Pope, 4' for he told it me over and over. ' Love in a Wood ' he wrote when he was but nineteen ; ' The Gentleman Dancing-Master,' at twenty one; 'The Plain Dealer,' at twenty-flve; and 'The Country Wife,' at one or two and thirty.\"\u2014 Spence's Anecdotes, (Singer's edit. ) p. 101. We believe this to have been the order of the compositions of Wycherley, notwithstanding the contradiction afforded to it by some of the original dates of their printed publication, and its apparent refutation in one of the scenes of the 44 Plain Dealer ; \" that is to say, we have made up our mind, in common with later critics, that the author did actually write his plays in this order, however he may have chosen to have them acted in another. A doubt (which turned out to be true) of the public acceptability of the character of Manly, in the '\u2022 Plain Dealer,\" might easily have kept that comedy back, till the later composition, the '\u2022 Country Wife,\" was performed ; and this previous performance would as easily account for the allusion to the 44 Country Wife,\" subsequently added to the 44 Plain Dealer,\" when the latter was brought out. In the volume, however, now presented to the public, we have adopted the printed order, as the one the more consistent with appearances. The critical reader can still, if lie pleases, go through the plays in the order in which we suppose the author to have written them. He can also, in the questionable matter of dates, and some other disputed facts, consult the passages we have extracted for that purpose from an article on this book which appeared in the popular critical journal, the Athen\u00e6um. Vide page lxxxii."], [21, "WYCHERLEY. XI And as he seems to have become a student-at-law for the sole purpose of drawing the character of Widow Blackacre in the \" Plain Dealer,\" so the trip to sea which he took, on occasion of one of our fighls with the Dutch, appears to have been for no end but to write some verses denouncing its horrors, and to make his hero the Plain Dealer a sea-captain. This event in his life he has recorded in the title of the verses alluded to* He most probably went as a volunteer, a circumstance not unusual with the gentry of that period ; and for a reason we shall give when we come to speak of the play, we guess the fight to have been that with Opdam, the same in which his friend Lord Dorset was present, and that occasioned the gay verses, \" To all you ladies now at land.\" It is no common evidence of the manliness and philosophy of Wycherley's turn of mind at this early period of life, (unless, indeed, it was the wit of a candid effeminacy,) that his presence on so triumphant an occasion gave him no sort of prejudice in favour of the glories of war. It did not even lead him, with the pardonable vanity of youth, to boast of his own share in them. Indeed he makes no mention of himself at all, except in the title of the poem. He merely seems to have thought both parties engaged in a truly infernal business. From the period of this event in his life we know of no other till the appearance of \" Love in a Wood,\" in the year 1672. This brought him acquainted with the Duchess of Cleveland, and it is said, in a very curious manner. The story is, that this celebrated mistress of Charles the Second, who took publicity so easily that she would lie back asleep in her coach along Hyde Park with her mouth wide open, called out to Wycherley's coach in Pall-Mall from her own coach-window, soon after his play had been acted, and upon the strength of a compliment which he had paid in it to the wit and spirit of natural children, saluted him by the plainest title of affiliation with which the illegitimate of the mercenary are wont to be greeted. Wycherley, agreeably to what was considered \" good fortune \" in those days, stopped his carriage, and turned, and came up with \" the lady \" (as Clarendon used to call her), and the dialogue is recorded to have proceeded in the following manner. \" Madam,\" said Wycherley, \" you have been pleased to bestow a title on me which belongs only to the fortunate. Will your ladyship be at the play to-night 1. \" \" Well,\" answered the duchess, \" what if I am there 1 \" \" Why, then,\" replied Wycherley, \" I will be there to wait on your ladyship, though I disappoint a fine woman, wlw has made me an assignation.\" [0 loving and delicate age of Charles the Second !] \" So,\" exclaimed the lady, \" you are sure to disappoint a woman who has favoured you, for one who has not ? \" \" Yes,\" returned he, \"if the one who has not favoured me is the finer woman of the two ! But he who can be constant to your ladyship till he can find a finer, is sure to die your captive.\" And so, with this climax of common-place, and a conviction on both sides that there was no heart in the matter, these two poor people were bound to meet at the play, as they did, and to \" make as if\" they were full of love and tenderness. \u2014 Voltaire, in his \" Letters on the English Nation,\" says, that the duchess used to go to Wycherley's chambers in the Temple, dressed like a country maid, in a straw hat, with pattens on, and a box or basket in her hand. Pope, according to Spence, related the story of the meeting in a different, and probably truer manner; for Dennis's version has a taste of the literary cookery of the time. \"Wycherley,\" said Pope, \"was a very handsome man. His acquaintance with the famous Duchess of Cleveland commenced oddly enough. One day, as he passed that duchess's coach in the Ring, she leaned out of the windows, and cried out loud enough to be heard distinctly by him, ' Sir, you 're a rascal ; you re a villain ! ' (Most probably Spence, in one of his fits of dulness, had forgotten the real appellation.) Wycherley from that instant entertained Iwpes ! He did not fail waiting on her the next morning ; and, with a very melancholy tone, begged to know how it was possible for him to have so much disobliged her grace % \" (Upon which, of course, the explanation of the allusion would take place.) \" They\u00b0were very good friends from that time ; yet, after all,\" concludes the poet with naivety \"what * PoBthumous Works, p. 235.-\" On a Sea-Fight, which the Author was in. betwixt the English and Dufch.\" h 1"], [22, "XII BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. did he get by her ? \" (A very natural question.) \" He was to have travelled with the young Duke of Richmond. King Charles gave him, now and then, a hundred pounds, not often.\" Wycherley, however, was so proud of this intimacy, that an offence which Cleveland's cousin the Duke of Buckingham took against him, might be traced to the foppery of his dedication of the play to her, without enlisting in the matter a personal jealousy that might have had no sort of foundation : for, though the duke is said not to have been without his gallantries towards the royal mistress, there was in general little love lost between those two noble personages. Wycherley, in this dedication, repeatedly speaks in strong and exulting language of the \" favours \" which her grace had shown him; and though he explains these favours to mean her having been to see his play two nights running, yet the vanity natural to a young author, the story already in circulation (according to Dennis), and the equivocal acceptation of the word, might combine to create a suspicion of its being intended to convey a more triumphant meaning ; and the fashionable circles might be offended, whatever was the case with the lady. Be this as it may, mutual friends succeeded in doing away the offence ; and Buckingham, pleased with a wit and conversation which no man knew better how to appreciate, took the startled offender under his patronage. He gave him a commission in his regiment ; made him one of his equerries, as master of the horse ; and helped to bring him into such intimacy with the king, that besides the bounties above-mentioned, Charles visited him while lying ill of a fever at his lodgings in Bow-street ; recommended him to try the air of Montpelier for the recovery of his health (which he did) ; and what will astonish those who are acquainted with the exchequer-accounts of that reign, presented him with five hundred pounds to defray the expenses of the journey. But probably it was the fair hand of the duchess that opened the purse-strings on this occasion, grateful for some wit and sincerity of companionship which she could not procure at court ; for Wycherley was a better man than he seemed in his writings ; and his heart, albeit through his vanity, could not help being touched perhaps by such circumstances as Voltaire relates, and which are not at all incompatible with what is known of the manners of the time. As to the royal third party, he had infidelities enough of his own to warrant him in pardoning those of one of his mistresses, perhaps even to induce him to desire them, in order to save him from her reproaches. Charles had such an esteem for Wycherley as even to wish him to be tutor to his son the Duke of Richmond, whom he spoke of bringing up like a prince ; but we shall see how this appointment was prevented. What, in all probability, crowned the favour of Wycherley at court, as long as it lasted, was the reputation which he had acquired for sincerity and manly feeling, and which must have given a very rare character to his homage. Meantime, while these events had been growing, our author had produced on the stage, and published, his three other plays, \u2014 the \"Gentleman Dancing-Master,\" in 1673, the \"Country Wife,\" in 1675, and the \" Plain Dealer,\" in 1677.* For want of a date for the event we are now about to speak of, we are inclined to put Wycherley's first marriage soon after the appearance of the last of the three ; for the \" Plain Dealer \" was the occasion of it ; and the circumstance with which the story commences looks as if the play had been but newly published. The once formidable Dennis, the critic, is again the authority for these amatory matters. It is curious that his importance should now be confined to the exercise of offices so gentle. Dennis informs us, that immediately after Wycherley had received the intimation we have mentioned from Charles the Second, relative to the tutorship of his son, he went down to Tunbridge, most likely for the purpose of refreshing himself with the ordinary attractions of the place; when promenading one day at the Wells with his friend Mr. Fairbeard, of Gray's Inn, it happened, just as he arrived at the bookseller's shop, that the Countess of Drogheda, a widow, young, handsome, and rich, came into it also, and inquired of the bookseller for the \" Plain Dealer.\" The rest of the story shall be told in the words of its latest and best repeater, Mr. Bell, who, if we venture to think him inclined now and then to be over-thankful * These dates are taken from the \u25a0\u25a0 Biographia Dramatioa,\" not the very best authority, except where corroborated ; but. In some later accounts no regard has been had to the variety of editions. Any date met with l,\u201ea been assumed to he the first. ' \"\"\u00ab, was"], [23, "WYCHERLEY. XIII for a piece of address in others, in consequence of his own hearty appreciation of whatsoever is graceful towards the sex, has done no more than justice on the present occasion to the happy promptitude <}f this gentleman with the auspicious name, Mr. Fairbeard. \" Madam,\" said Mr. Fairbeard, \" since you are for the ' Plain Dealer,' there he is for you,\" pushing Mr. Wycherley towards her at the same time. \" Yes,\" observed Wycherley, with his usual promptitude ind gallantry, \" this lady can bear plain-dealing, for she appears to be so accomplished, that what would be compliment addressed to others, would be plain-dealing addressed to her.\" The countess replied to this sally, with \" No truly, Sir, I am not without my faults any more than the rest of my sex; and yet, notwithstanding all my faults, I love plain-dealing, and am never more fond of it than when it tells me of my faults.\" \" Then, Madam,\" interposed Mr. Fairbeard, who appears to have played his part in the scene with excellent taste and good-humour, \"you and the Plain Dealer seem designed by heaven for each other.\" The result of this dramatic exordium was the usual termination of comedy, \u2014 matrimony ; and (as Dennis might have said) something not so pleasant afterwards, at the fall of the curtain. Wycherley waited on the lady, first in Tunbridge, and afterwards at her house in Hatton-garden, and obtaining her affections, is said to have been induced by his father to marry her in secret, for fear of diverting the intentions in his favour at court ; a piece of craft, which according to the wonted fashion of that kind of wisdom, ended iu producing the very evil which it thought to prevent. The discovery made the king regard the marriage as an act of contumacy, aggravated by disingenuousness, \u2014 a conclusion of the very worst sort for poor \" manly Wycherley ; \" and though it is understood that the royal indignation might have been appeased in time, the Countess completed the apparent contempt of court, by a jealousy which kept the handsome dramatist away from it ; not at all approving a place, of the temptations of which she was not ignorant, and which was still presided over by the fair and voluptuous dedicatee of \" Love in a Wood.\" Our author's consort, in fact, had been a \"maid of honour\" herself in the very honourable and perilous domain of Whitehall. She was one of the \"Mademoiselles Robartes,\" mentioned in Grammont, daughters of Lord Robartes, afterwards Earl of Radnor. She was married to the Earl of Drogheda during her father's Lord-lieutenancy of Ireland ; . and in the course of ten years becoming a widow, now occupied a house in the ever-dramatic but then also fashionable quarter of Bow-street, Covent Garden, where she was the glory, plague, and torment of her beloved husband the Plain Dealer. She might still possibly \" like to have her faults told her,\" rather thau not be spoken of at all, especially if they came mended by fond lips into virtues ; but there were faults of Mr. Wycherley's own, in his past life, perhaps in his present, which she could not construe into virtues by any process of imagination ; and the consequence was, that whenever he went to meet his old companions at their favourite tavern in Bow-street, which unfortunately for him was right opposite the house, he was obliged to sit with the windows of the room open, in order that the fair Letitia-Isabella might be assured there was no female in the company ! The disasters arising from this unfortunate marriage did not terminate even with the poor woman's death, which took place before long. She seems really to have loved her husband, as well as such a temper could ; and accordingly left him the whole of her fortune ; but the title under which he claimed the property was disputed, and the law-expenses resulting threw him into such a series of difficulties, that his father was unable to extricate him, and the luckless dramatist lay in the Fleet prison for seven years ! The Radnor family by this time were probably not rich. The Earl, her brother, had married the daughter of Sir John Cutler, the miser, who would not give the new countess a dowry. The sister's fortune may have become of proportionate consequence ; and, at all events, Wycherley lost it. In his \" Posthumous Works \" is a poem addressed to Cutler, banteringly exhorting him to stick to his avarice as the summum bonum ; whether in spite to his wife's relations, or in the forlorn hope of shaming away the cause of dispute, it is of course impossible to guess. It would seem unaccountable that so long a captivity should withhold from the society which he had delighted, an author who was acknowledged to have a good heart, and who was gifted by his"], [24, "XIV BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. contemporaries with a title to special reputation as a man. But ill-luck, the character of not being worldly wise, perhaps real improvidence, at all events the difficulty of bringing his troubles to a close by one large sum, may naturally have perplexed such friends a3 an author is likely to have. And even his titled ones may have not been among his richest, considering the wants of their luxury. He told, however, his first biographer, Pack, that the Earl of Mulgrave (Sheffield, after wards Duke of Buckinghamshire) once lent him five hundred pounds. Why the king did not assist him, perhaps indeed why he withdrew his countenance from him in the first instance, may have been accounted for, not by his marriage, but by the strong partisanship of his attachment to Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, whose side, in the disputes with him at court, even when accused of treason and thrown into the Tower, he took with a fondness of zeal that does credit to both their memories. We learn this characteristic and engaging circumstance from a poem in his folio volume, addressed to the Duke on the occasion, and beginning with this uncompromising verse : \u2014 \" Your late disgrace was but the court's disgrace.\" \" Manly Wycherley \" is conspicuous here, and no less so the reason why he was not likely to enjoy a life-long continuation of the king's favour. Pack says, that while the author was in the extremest of these troubles, the bookseller, who had profited largely by the sale of the \" Plain Dealer,\" refused to lend him the sum of twenty pounds ; a churlishness which, taking for granted honesty on one side, and pecuniary ability on the other, would certainly not have been shown to such a man now-a-days. But whether these stories were true or false, it seems not unlikely that Wycherley would have ended his days in prison, had not Charles's successor, James, happening to witness the performance of the \" Plain Dealer,\" and being struck with the supposed virtues of its hero's character, which touched him on the side of his own claims to sincerity, issued orders for the payment of the author's debts in full, and settled a pension on him besides of two hundred a year, so long as he should reside in England. But in matters of pecuniary trouble, \" it never rains but it pours,\" as the proverb says, come what sunshine there may betwixt. Even under this unlooked-for felicity, Wycherley's ill-luck haunted him in the shape of a baslifulness, which, while it deteriorates from our sense of his \"wit,\" gives him an unexpected addition of good-will in our hearts, at the thought of such childish unworldliness in the \"man of the world.\" He was too modest to state the whole amount of his debts, even to his friend Lord Mulgrave, who was commissioned to learn it ; perhaps the more modest, because of his friendship ; and the consequence was, an unliquidated balance of liabilities, which still weighed on his mind. Even when the death of his father, at a ripe old age, put him in possession of the family estate, even then, being only a tenant for life, and unable to raise money upon it to a sufficient amount, he obtained but slight relief ! and thus the irretrievable difficulty might now be supposed to have reached its climax ; but a sense of dramatic surprise mingles with one's pity, at discovering-, that the last desperate measure to which he was about to resort for the purpose of delivering himself, did but bind him in new chains for the short remainder of his life, and leave him free from the others, only to see it hasten its termination. Wycherley had a disagreeable nephew (very disagreeable and unworthy, one should suppose, to be able to disconcert the last days of a man rendered philosophic both by good-nature and misfortune.) This nephew he could not bear to think of succeeding him. We do not very well understand the case, as it is variously related in the biographies ; perhaps for want of the due legal knowledge ; but it appears, that by a certain combination of law and matrimony, he thought at once to disappoint this nephew, free himself from his other annoyances, and confer, as he fancied, a benefit on a deserving object. He, therefore, almost in articulo mortis, married a young woman whom he supposed possessed of a considerable estate, settled a jointure upon her out of it, and applied a part of the proceeds to his own uses. In vain ! He dies eleven days afterwards, in the December of the year 1715, aged 75 ; and if his spirit were to be supposed cognizant of what was going forward over his coffin, it has been asserted by some biographers, that he would have found his widow an"], [25, "WYCHERLEY. XV impostor, and already in the possession of another man. It is said, that by a truly dramatic close of his existence, he summoned his new wife to him the evening before he expired, and having obtained her consent to a request he was about to make, explained it in the following words : \u2014 \" My dear, it is only this, \u2014 that you will never marry an old man again.\" Here was the ruling passion of wit and humour strong in death ; though Pope, adding jest to jest, thinks it hard he should have debarred her from doubling her jointure \" on the same easy terms.\" It does not appear that she would have baulked herself of twenty such. She went by the name of Jackson ; and the alleged fellow-swindler, who subsequently married her, called himself Captain Shrimpton. Bethia Sliringstou was the name of Wycherley's mother. It was through the Captain and Theobald, that the volume of \" Posthumous Works,\" which Pope had had so uneasy a hand in re-touching, came before the public. Wycherley's remains were deposited in the vault of the church in Covent Garden. Pope affirmed to Spence that he died a \" Romanist ; \" and that he had owned that religion in his hearing. When people have not the very best ideas of this world, nor, consequently perhaps, of the next, it is natural enough that fear on some occasions, and doubt on all, should make them willing to abide by the church that claims to itself exclusively the power of solving all doubt, and delivering from all fear. \u2014 So Madame de Montausier triumphed at last. The chain of these melancholy events, so closely linked with one another, has hindered us from speaking till now of the curious intercourse that took place, in his latter days, between Wycherley, the oldest wit of the departing age, and Pope, the youngest of the new. Wycherley, in the year 1704, which was the sixty-fourth year of his age, not being the everlasting young-old boy that Chaucer was, nor of the right faith in things poetical, published a bad volume of poems, full of harsh verses and insipid gallantries ; and Pope giving the world his Pastorals about the same time, and being then sixteen to Wycherley's sixty-five, the two books appear to have brought the old wit and the new together. Pope, with the reverence natural to a young writer, diligently cultivated his new acquaintance, haunting his lodgings in town, (following him about, as he describes it, like a dog) and trying to entice him to come and see him in Windsor Forest. (Lady W. Montague says he did it for a legacy ; but the charge is manifestly nothing but a bit of the spite and malice, to which her ladyship's fine brain too frequently condescended). Wycherley, on the other hand, always promising to go to the Forest, and always complaining of his irresistible itch of writing, wishes to get up a fresh volume of poems, and compliments his new friend, not yet out of his teens, with asking him to correct his verses. A dangerous compliment ! Pope entered upon his task with more sincerity than comfort, asking, among other cavalier inquiries, whether he was to turn the \" worst pieces \" into \" very good ; \" and implying, in that case, that it might be necessary to \" re-write \" them ! The old man, unable to deny himself the pleasure of seeing his darling verses trimmed up, yet wincing under the approach of so slashing an instrument, compliments the \" great mind ' of his critic at the expense of his \" little, tender, and crazy body.\" In short, spleen and impatience break out on both sides in the course of an anxious correspondence, till Pope, with hardly sufficient delicacy of forbearance, testily throws up his office ; and though strong expressions of esteem afterwards passed between them through the medium of common friends, the intercourse was never renewed. Of the two, Wycherley appears to us to have been the less in the wrong; hut then his experience left him the smaller excuse for not foreseeing the result. From the letters that passed between Pope and Wycherley, and the recollections of him by the former in Spence, we learn something of the habits and appearance of the dramatist. Pope put him in the list of those who had the \" nobleman-look.\" He did not care for the country ; was fond of serious and philosophic authors (Montaigne, Rochefoucault, Seneca, and Gracian), in one of whom he used to \" read himself asleep o' nights ; \" and was vain of his handsomeness, the departure of which in old age he could so little endure, that he would sigh over the portrait of him at twenty-eight by Sir Peter Lely, and to the engraving made of it in 1703, (from which the one in the present volume is taken) ordered the motto to be put, \" Quantum mutatus ab illo,\" (how changed from him !) \" which he used to repeat,\" says Pope, \"\u25a0 with a melancholy emphasis.\" Sir Godfrey Kneller"], [26, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. XVI said he would make a very fine head without his wig ; but he could not bear the portrait when done, and Sir Godfrey was obliged to add the wig. Alas for a Charles-the-Second old age ! Shakspeare speaks of a man who was \" incapable of his own distress.\" Here was a man who was unequal to his own venerableness. He retained however to the last, in spite of the occasional \" peevishness \" natural to such a decline (unless Pope's own peevishness found it in his associate) the character he had always possessed of good-heartedness and sincerity. His contemporaries have recorded him as being of an intercourse as modest and gentle as his public satire was bold ; and they all agreed in giving him, as an epithet of distinction, the name of his hero in the Plain Dealer, \" Manly,\" \u2014 a cognomen, to which perhaps his personal appearance helped to contribute,\u2014 for Rochester, in his \" Session of the Poets,\" designated him as \" brawny Wycherley,\" though the word was omitted in subsequent editions. Dryden, with his usual good-nature towards young authors, once invited him to join him in writing a comedy ; but he modestly declined the offer in a poem of grateful panegyric* It is difficult to say which was the luckier in the failure of this proposal, Dryden or Wycherley ; for the poetical part of Dryden's spirit, especially if he had written in verse, would have borne down the unbelieving prose of a man who had no such poetry in him : while, on the other hand, the greater, or at all events purer, dramatic power of Wycherley would not have known what to be at with the unseasonable and arbitrary superfluities of Dryden. Wycherley has justly been considered as the earliest of our comic prose dramatists, who forsook the fleeting shapes of custom and manners that were brought to their gayest head in Etherege, for the more lasting wit and humour natural to the prevailing qualities of mankind. Etherege was the \" dandy \" of the prose drama, and Wycherley the first man. Shadwell had glimpses \" in his drink ; \" but he was only a gross and hasty sketcher. Schlegel has missed a general airiness in all our plays of this class, through the whole range of English comedy ; and Wycherley is certainly no exception to the defect. He is somewhat heavy as well as \" brawny \" in his step ; and when he moves faster, it is seldom from gaiety. He has \" wit at will \" also ; but then the will to be witty is frequently too obvious. It has too artificial an air of thought and antithesis. His best scenes are those of cross purposes, mutual exposure, or the contrast of natural with acquired cunning ; those, in short, in which reflection and design have much more to do than animal spirits. His style is pure and unaffected ; and clearness and force are his characteristics, in preference to what is either engaging or laughable. We can easily believe him to have been a \" slow \" writer ; not from dulness, but from care and consideration. \" Of all our modern wits, none seem to me Once to have touch1 d upon true comedy, But hasty Shadwell and slow Wycherley. The truth of the application of this epithet has been controverted, especially by Lord Lansdowne, who knew him, and who implies that he contradicts it from personal knowledges But unless the loss of memory, which he suffered in advanced life, had altered his habits of composition, the question might appear to be settled by the interlined state in which Theobald says his manuscripts were left, and which was so excessive, that a stranger could hardly read them. The failure of his faculties, it is true, in this respect was so great, that Pope says he would copy other authors on paper and repeat himself, and forget that he had done either in the course of a few hours. On the other hand, Rochester's triplet has some more lines to it, not so often quoted : \u2014 \" Shauwell's unfinish'd works do yet impart Great proofs of nature's force, though none of art But Wycherley earns hard whate'er he gains, He wants no judgment, and lie spares no pains.\" Perhaps Rochester spoke of his younger efforts, and Lansdowne knew him at a time of life when * 44 An Epistle to Mr. Dryden, occasioned by his desiring to join with him in writing a Comedy.\" Posthumous Works, p. 18. f See the passage in Anderson's British Poets, vol. vii. p. 722."], [27, "WYCHERLEY. XVII practice had made him quicker. And yet, as Wycherley was not a writer of impulse, there is some thing of that kind of simple hardness in his style which looks like a slow growth. Congreve's agglomerations of wit have the same appearance of elaboration, though from another \"cause. Vanbrugh and Farquhar have more spirits, and a readier air accordingly. But we shall touch upon these comparisons, when we have done speaking of all separately. We shall now glance at each play of Wycherley's, in the order of its composition.\u2014 The idea of \" Love in a Wood, or St. James's Park,\" (for the Park was the wood,) was evidently suggested by the \" Mulberry Garden\" of Sir Charles Sedley,-a title suggested by a house of entertainment which stood on the site of Buckingham Palace, and the grounds of which, like the Spring-garden at the opposite corner, were resorted to by the gallants and masked ladies of the time, when they issued forth of a summer's evening like so many gnats, to buzz, sting, and make love. It turns upon a game of hide-and-seek, and other cross-purposes, between some of these \" minions of the moon,\" and is worth little in style or plot ; yet we think, upon the whole, it has been undervalued. It is not unamusing. It gives early evidence of that dislike of backbiting and false friendship, which honourably distinguished Wycherley through life ; and there are the germs of two characters in it, which have been since developed by Hoadley and Sheridan,\u2014 that of Falkland in the \" Rivals \" (the Valentine of this play) and Hanger in the \"Suspicious Husband;\" whose name, with a candour that was to be expected from Hoadley's superior nature, was retained by him from the Banger of Wycherley. Compare, in particular, the immense yet pleasant impudence, and reconciling animal spirits, of the entrance of Hoadley's Hanger into the bedroom of Mrs. Strickland, with its manifest prototype in the second act of \" Love in a Wood.\" The concluding stanza of the song in the first act contains the passage which is said to have been the origin of the writer's acquaintance with the Duchess of Cleveland. Either Wycherley's memory must have failed him as to the early period of some of his com positions, or vanity helped to mislead it,\u2014 for he had manifestly gone to the same sources as Moliere for the improvement of his plots, when he wrote the \" Gentleman Dancing-Master.\" There is a similar amusiug intrigue in it to that of the \"Ecole des Femmes,\" carried on through the medium of an unconscious wittol, who hugs himself upon the fool he is making of the favoured lover ; and the author, besides looking back to old English comedy for a Frenchified Englishman, has brought a formalised one from Spain, the favourite store-house of the comedy of the preceding age. The hero of the piece, who is made to personate a dancing-master, and to be always in motion whether he will or no, is very amusing ; so is the suspicious old aunt, who sees through his incompetency : but, above all, there is an exquisite truth to nature in the egotistical effrontery of the father, who, after treating the aunt's suspicions with contempt, takes to himself the credit of making the very discovery, which she has all along been trying to beat into his head. The \" Plain Dealer,\" \u2014 with the exquisite addition of the litigious Widow Blackacre, a kind of born female barrister, an original which he had doubtless met with in the courts of law,\u2014 is an English version, in its principal characteristics, of the \" Misanthrope \" of Moliere, greatly improved, inasmuch as the hero is less poetically tragic, but equally contrary to nature and to the true spirit of comedy, inasmuch as he is tragical at all ; and in one respect it is shockingly below the original ; for it is deformed so as no other age but such a one as that of Charles the Second could suppose manhood to be deformed, and yet remain consistent with itself, by the sort of revenge which he permits himself to take on his mistress, \u2014 that of a possession of her person under the supposition of his being another man, and while he feels nothing for her disposition but hatred and contempt. Yet in this gusto of desecrated animal passion, fit only for some ferocious sensualist who believed himself as great a rascal as he thought everybody else, the wits of those days saw nothing to deteriorate from a character emphatically christened and thought \"Manly,\" \u2014 a name which it imparted, as an epithet of honour, to the Author himself. As to the rest, the wit put into the mouth of this much injured Captain of the British navy is as forced, and not seldom as common-place, as the violent and solemn coxcombry of his hatred of all other vices but his own is ridiculous. Indeed all misan thropes, whatever be their pretensions in other respects, nay, in very proportion to their claims upon"], [28, "XVIII BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. being thought exceptions to the generality of mankind, are, and must be, so far, nothing but stupid and immodest coxcombs, for daring to set up their supposed knowledge of themselves above the whole virtues of the rest of their fellow-creatures. In what has been charged, however, as unnatural in the characters of the two heroes of Wycherley and Moliere, with regard to their believing in the goodness of one select friend and one mistress, this, we confess, appears to us provokingly true to nature ; for the same arbitrary will and pleasure that trumps up a man's own virtues to himself, has only to include the first convenient man or woman it meets with in the same spotless category, and for not a jot better reason. The feelings of the public saw better than the court-wits, and instinctively revolted against this play in spite of the exquisite scenes of the scandal -mongering fine ladies and gentlemen, the prototypes of those in Congreve and Sheridan. It is said, that the good-natured Duke of Dorset, who tried hard to take his own bilious tempera ment for a kind of misanthropy, but was too modest and good-hearted to succeed, was the first to reconcile the town to an approval of it. If so, perhaps the Duke's having been in the great sea fight against Opdam, may serve both to account for the profession assigned to the Author's hero, and to corroborate a guess as to the particular battle that Wycherley himself was in. In the \" Country Wife \" there are no such scenes and dialogue of continued excellence as those of Olivia and her visitors in the second act of the \" Plain Dealer ;\" but the principal female character hits a point of more lasting nature, and is an exquisite meeting of the extremes of simplicity and cunning; so that with some alterations, especially of the impudent project of Horner, which would have been an affront in any other age to a decent audience, this comedy out lasted the performances of the graver one, and will always be revived whenever such an actress appears as Mrs. Jordan. Those who remember how that delightful woman seemed mr.de for every trusting enjoyment, \u2014 how she could unite boisterous animal spirits with a brimful r.:r.3ibility, \u2014 how she would come dancing on the stage at forty, a girl still in spite of her fat, \u2014 what a breath and music there was in her voice, and how the people loved it the moment they hea. : -_', \u2014 how she would wear a huge buxom pin-afore, divide sobs of sorrow with the comforts of a great slice of bread-and-butter, anticipate a world of delight with rubbed hands and huddling shoulders, \u2014 and with what a cramming of all the powers of coaxing into one little syllable she would utter the word \" bud,\" while taking her guardian's cheeks in her hands, as though it sprang out of the fulness of her heart, and formed her lips into the very thing it spoke of, \u2014 will sigh to think, that circumstances rarely produce creatures made of such cordial human clay ; or that anything could have made a life close in sorrow, which had given to others nothing but happiness. We have found nothing in the Letters of Wycherley, either to Pope or Dennis, worth extracting in this place ; but from an extraordinary heap of bad and good in the three hundred and eight \" Maxims and Reflections \" written by him in his old age, we have selected some not unworthy of \" The satire, wit, and strength of Manly Wycherley.\" (So wrote Dryden of him in one of his own strong lines.) As wit is too hard for power in council, so power is too hard for wit in action. Our hopes, though they never happen, yet are some kind of happiness ; as trees, whilst they are still growing, please in the prospect, though they bear no fruit. Believe your friend honest to make him so, if he be not so ; since, if you distrust him, you make his falsehood a piece of justice. We increase our losses ourselves, and club with Fortune to undo us, when with them we lose our patience too ; as infants, that being robbed of some of their baubles, throw away the rest in childish anger. Every little club thinks wit confined to it ; as every small sect of godly professors think to monopolise salvation. We reprove our friends' faults more out of pride, than love or charity ; not so much to correct them, as to make them believe we are ourselves without them. Lies, artifice, and tricks, arc as sure a mark of a low and poor spirit, as the passing of false money is of a poor, low purse."], [29, "CONGREVE. XIX It is a very common feeling iu us never to be satisfied with our fortune, and never dissatisfied with our sense and conduct. Charity and good-nature give a sanction \\o the most common actions ; and pride and ill-nature make our best virtues despicable. zTiie silence of a wise man is more wrong to mankind than the slanderer's speech. This last is a noble observation, and looks profoundly into the wants of society. From the rest we may gather the amiableness as well as sincerity of the Author's character ; who was so beloved in his time, as to afford a caution to sour, and therefore crude, moralists, how they put the worst construction upon what is not always best in his writings. CONGREVE. WILLIAM CONGREVE was the second son of Richard Congreve, Esq., of Congreve and Stretton, who was one of the thirteen Staffordshire gentlemen upon whom Charles the Second intended to confer the order of the Royal Oak, had the institution taken place. The late Sir William Congreve, Bart., the inventor of the rocket system, was the descendant of a younger branch of the family ; but the direct line still survives at Aldermans town in Berkshire, on a property which came to it by marriage. The Stretton estate, on which the family had resided since the time of Edward the Second, was sold by our author's great-grand-nephew, William, who married a Waller ; and it is now the property of Edward Monckton, Esq. An oak is still shown there, on a lawn, under which part of the \" Old Bachelor \" is said to have been written. But wherever such opportunities occur, some spot or other is pretty sure to be identified with the haunts of genius, \u2014 with the flight4; and warblings of the human bird. Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus. The choir of penmen all delight in trees. Our author'3 mother (a relationship always pleasing to ascertain) was Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Fitzherbert, and grand-daughter of Sir Anthony, the celebrated judge, who wrote the work praised by Blackstone, De NaturA Brevium. She had a maternal uncle, who possessed a house at Bardsey, near Leeds ; and it was there that the dramatist was born, in the year 1669, probably while his father, a younger brother, and an officer in the army, was cultivating in Ireland the patronage of the Earl of Burlington, on whose estate he subsequently had employment as a land-agent.* It is curious to see how unwilling people were to take Congreve's word that he was born in England, and not in Ireland ; \u2014 a dispute which Malone set at rest by the production of a register. Dr. Johnson, among others, seems to have \" sullenly \" begged the question against Congreve's veracity, purely that he might indulge in the following gratuitous piece of acuteness : \u2014 \" Neither the time nor place of his birth are certainly known ; if the inscription upon his monument be true, he was born in 1672. For the place, it was said by himself that he owed his nativity to England, and by everybody else, that he was born in Ireland. Southern mentioned him with sharp censure, as a man that meanly disowned his native country. The biographers assign his nativity to Bardsa, near Leeds, in Yorkshire, from the account given by himself, as they suppose, to Jacob. \" To doubt,\" continues Johnson, \" whether a man of eminence has told the truth about his own birth, is, in appearance, to be very deficient in candour ; yet nobody can live long without knowing that falsehoods of convenience and vanity \u2014 falsehoods from which no evil immediately visible ensues^ except the general degradation of human testimony \u2014 are very lightly uttered, and once uttered, are * For such of the above family particulars as are new to the biography of Congreve, we are indebted to Burke's Genealogical and Historical Account of the Landed Gentry of England, vol. iii. p. 412, _c."], [30, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. XX sullenly supported. Boileau, who desired to be thought a vigorous and steady moralist, having told a petty lie to Louis XIV., continued it afterwards by false dates ; thinking himself obliged in honour, says his admirer, to maintain what, when he said it, was so well received.\"* But Johnson, while he was thus detecting one infirmity in mankind, was overlooking another, in which he himself was indulging, viz. \u2014 a tendency to prefer accusation to proof. How could \" everybody else \" but Congreve say that he was born in Ireland, when his \" biographer \" said otherwise 1 And if they took his word for it, why should they not, merely because he might have lied? Southern was himself an Irishman; and in that circumstance the Doctor, had he chosen, might have detected another weakness, \u2014 that of wishing to make out as much wit and talent as possible for one's own country. A better ground of suspicion against Congreve would have been found in the general fastidiousness of his character, and in the infirmity of his taking conventional ascendancies for something superior to genius itself. Though Congreve was not born in Ireland, he was assuredly educated there ; first at Kilkenny, and afterwards at Trinity College, Dublin : where he had for his tutor St. George Ashe, afterwards bishop of Clogher and Derry, who had been the tutor of Swift. Congreve was but two years younger than Swift ; and as the latter had been educated also at Kilkenny, and stuck to his friend through life, though of different politics, it would have been pleasant to fancy them under the same tutor at the same time. But whatever may have been the case with the school, somebody has told us that they were not together under Dr. Ashe. On quitting the University, Congreve was entered of the Middle Temple ; but he does not appear to have paid any attention to the law. Having family, as well as wit and scholarship, he was admitted into every kind of good company ; and he probably soon discovered, that he could make way enough in life, without a profession, to suit the views of a man of no great affections, who saw little in the world superior to the union of wit and gentility. His first publication was a novel entitled \"Incognita, or Love and Duty Reconciled;\" which was said to have been written at the age of seventeen, but made its appearance at twenty-one. Johnson's convenient criticism upon it was, that he wrould \" rather praise it than read it.\" Being of a less robust conscience on the reviewing side, it is our lot to have read it, without being able to praise. The author, though fresh from reading romances, already shows himself a man of the world, in the tone of his \"love,\" and his notions of womankind. He was never young in that respect; \u2014 nor yet ever attained to years of poetical discretion. He aspires to be poetical nevertheless ; and one of his fancies about his heroine is, that Cupid employs a quill out of his wings in \" picking her teeth ! \" About the same period, at Drury Lane theatre, came out his first dramatic performance, the \" Old Bachelor,\" written, like the novel, \" several years before,\" and, as he said, in his fine-gentleman fashion, to \" amuse himself in a -slow recovery from a fit of sickness.\" Dryden, to whom he had addressed a reverential panegyric on the translation of \" Persius,\" declared he had \" never seen such a first play;\" and he, Southern, and Maynwaring, freed it from some inexperiences, to fit it for the stage. The play was fortunate in every respect. Davies says, that when four of the actresses, Mrs. Barry, Mrs. Bracegirdle, Mrs. Mountford, and Mrs. Bowman, appeared together on the stage in the last act, the audience were so struck with a group so beautiful, that they broke out into a fervour of applauses The talents of the actors, Betterton, Powel, and others, were on a par with the beauty and vivacity of the women. And fame was followed up by more profits than theatrical ones; for Montagu, afterwards Earl of Halifax, and then one of the Lords of the Treasury, gave the author a place, \u2014 that of a commissioner for licensing hackney-coaches. Johnson says, that he \" soon after \" gave him another place in the pipe-office, and a third in the customs, of six hundred pounds a-year. These two offices, however, are probably but one and the same, which he did not receive till upwards of twenty years afterwards. Swift says he had but a single appointment for \" half his days ;\" and with whatever spleen he said it, Swift surely ought to have known. Among minor instances of the new dramatist's luck on this occasion, Southern is supposed to allude to this comedy when he says, that on reading it * Art. Conuheve, in the Lives of the Poets. t Dramatic Miscellanies, Vol. iii. p. 417."], [31, "CONGREVE. XXI to the players, the author pronounced it so wretchedly, that they had almost rejected it ; but that subsequently they became so persuaded of its excellence, and the manager, Thomas Davenant, was so pleased with his conversation, that for half a-year before it was acted, he was allowed, upon Southern's recommendation, the privilege of the house ; \u2014 no very great indulgence, it should seem, compared with the liberality of managers at present. The author of one successful piece is easily persuaded to write another ; but the impulse, though encouraged by the triumph, is apt to be of a less genuine sort, and more critical ; so as to lose more on the side of felicity, than it has gained on that of good luck. The \" Double Dealer,\" which came out at the same house the year following, did not please like the \" Old Bachelor.\" Congreve, in his adulatory dedication to Montagu, pretended not to care ; but he smiled and winced at the critics like Sir Fretful Plagiai-y. Queen Mary, however, came to see both the plays ; and Dryden addressed him the celebrated epistle, in which he hailed him as the successor of the new stage and the old, and touchingly bequeathed to him the care of his own reputation. On the queen's coming to see the \" Old Bachelor,\" Congreve wrote a new prologue, in which, with no great modesty, nor in any very poetical style, he says, \" By this repeated act of grace, we see Wit is again the care of majesty ;\" and then he pretty broadly hints a comparison to his advantage with all preceding stages, ancient and modern. The writer of two such plays before he was twenty-six, might be allowed to be vain ; but Shakspeare, and fifty predecessors inferior to Shakspeare, would not have talked thus. Their genius would have been aware of its deficiencies, by reason of its being something which the utmost stretch of Congreve's \" wit \" was not large enough to discern. r Drury Lane theatre was at that time the only one ; and as the ruling patentees were men of arbitrary tempers, or were exasperated by coalitions to force them into different conduct, the monopoly tempted them into behaviour so offensive, that Betterton, and others of its best actors, finally revolted, and obtained a patent for a new one, which was set up within the walls of a tennis court in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. Congreve's wit was in such estimation, notwithstanding the comparative failure of the \" Double Dealer,\" and he appears also to have sympathised so strongly with the revolters, that they bore him with them to their new house ; and as he had great sense and judgment, notwithstanding his spleen against critics, he had tacitly profited by the censures on him, and the theatre opened with a new comedy from his pen, \" Love for Love,\" which was as lively and successful as the \" Old Bachelor.\" The success, indeed, was so advantageous to the actors, that besides an author's customary profits, they gave their coadjutor a share in the house itself, on condition of his furnishing them with a play a year, \" if his health was good enough.\" It is to he concluded, that his health was not good enough ; for he was nearly six years in producing his two remaining plays. One of them, however, was the most successful he wrote, and the managers appear to have been satisfied. This most prosperous of his performances was his only serious one, the \" Mourning Bride ; \" perhaps we should rather say, his only tragic one ; for there is a severity of rascality, as well as an intricacy of plot, in some of his comedies, that produces upon many of their readers far too grave an impression. The \" Mourning Bride \" came out in the year 1697 ; and was followed in 1700 by the \" Way of the World,\" which, as the former had been the most successful of his plays, was the least so, and completed that disgust with the stage, which a performer upon it, of a very new complexion, had begun. We allude to the famous Jeremy Collier, who in the interval between the appearances of these two dramas, astonished the play-going public by coming like a crash upon their \" houses,\" and forcing the \" men of wit and honour \" to fly to the* most amazing of all self-defences\u2014 that of their morality. We shall notice this battle, sincere on one side, half-confounded on the other, and mistaken on both, when we come to the remarks at the close of our lives. The great success of the \"Mourning Bride \" was a pleasing instance of the willingness of society at all times to prefer the gravity of the affections to the levity of doubt and sarcasm. Our great modern novelist, Sir Walter Scott, strangely mistook a matter of fact in the tendencies as well as history of"], [32, "XXII BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. humanity, when he said that mankind at large prefer comedy to tragedy. The stronger sensation, and therefore the more popular, must of necessity be on the side of passion, rather than of the absence of it, and of the elementary feelings which all the world experience, rather than of pleasantries often rendered local and fleeting by circumstances of nation and fashion. None but a Frenchman can thoroughly laugh, even with Moliere ; and to a modern Greek half of Aristophanes is a jargon ; but all the world can weep and be exalted with Sophocles and with Shakspeare. Far are we from undervaluing comedies and laughter. We heartily wish there were more of both. It is too often forgotten by the would-be rational as well as the would-be pious, that heaven made laughter as well as tears. But even the height of pleasure becomes serious ; and it may be said, that the sweet gravity of the highest kind of poetry is ever on the face of Nature herself. There was an incredible tradition, that when Congreve found \" The AVay of the World \" not likely to succeed, he came in a passion on the stage, and told the audience they need not trouble themselves to show their dislike, for he intended to write for them no longer, nor ever again submit himself to the judgment of impotent critics. This proceeding has been pronounced not likely in a gentleman of his politeness ! The truth is, it would have been a madness. Congreve felt the public censure strongly, no doubt ; and betook himself, as a man of letters and fashion, to his calm airs of superiority and contempt ; but fancy this urbanest of companions, who never said a painful thing to any one, suddenly giving up the habit of a life in order to rush upon the stage, and insult the town to its face, like a mad scene-shifter ! * He yet made his appearance however, once more, on a new stage, which was that of the larger theatre erected for Betterton's company, on the site of the present opera-house, by Sir John Vanbrugh, whom the old actors had now detached, as well as Congreve, from the Drury Lane Theatre, and whom they appointed \" Viceroy over them,\" in conjunction with his brother wit. Referring to Vanbrugh's life, who was the more concerned in it, for what further may be said on this event, we shall only state here, that Congreve did little or nothing for his share of the management but contribute a prologue or so, and one or two miserable bits of operas. He then backed, in fastidious incompetence, out of the concern. From this period, till the close of his days, with the exception of publishing his collected works in 1710, he betook himself to a private life, sweetened by a fame which he affected not to care for, and by the approbation of men of all parties, which he secured by occasionally saying a good word for a friend, and a bad one against nobody. What his finances were up to a certain period, or how they enabled him to live among the great, is _ mystery. Swift's account of them has been thought a Tory libel : \" Thus Congreve spent in writing plays. And one poor office, half his days ; While Montague, who claim'd the station To be M\u00e6cenas of the nation, For poets open table kept, But ne'er consider'd where they slept.

XXIII We take Swift to have been in the right, as to the fact of the single office. Congreve's receipts from his various places have been usually huddled together, as though Halifax had given them all, and at once. Probably they did all come from him, or through him ; but it is certain our author was not made a Commissioner of Wine Licences till the November of 1714. His richest appointment, that of Secretary for Jamaica, followed in the course of the next month. Halifax died the May ensuing. The whole of Congreve's offices now put him in possession, it is said, of twelve hundred a-year, a very handsome income in those days for a bachelor. Up to this period, he probably lived according to Swift's intimation, in straitened circumstances at home, though magnificently in the houses of his noble friends ; not the happiest possible condition for a proud man, or any man ; though pride can sooner reconcile itself, than less assuming passions, to whatsoever it condescends to be convenienced with. At all events, whether proud or philosophic, Congreve repaid with interest what he received, by the charms of his wit and conversation ; and men of genius, of all parties, would have handed his name down to posterity, had he done nothing else for it himself. Dryden may be said to have eulogised him as long as he survived. Steele dedicated his \"Miscellanies\" to him, and Pope his \" Iliad ; \" and he was visited by Voltaire. Occasionally he wrote some verses which were handed about, or a prologue for some friend, or a paper for a periodical work, or epistle to some coffee-house wit. But he lived more like a man of birth than of letters ; and his powers of amusement being equal to his fame, he became celebrated for his bonnes fortunes, and was always in tender connexion with some reigning charmer. At one time, the lady appears to be Mrs. Arabella Hunt, the singer ; at another, he is residing in the same house with \" Madam Berenger ; \" at another, and for a long while, he is the friend of delightful Mrs. Bracegirdle (whose very name sounds like a Venus) ; and during the last years of his life he was the cherished companion of Henrietta, Duchess of Marlborough, wife of the Lord Treasurer Godolphin. Upon the subject of these two latter connexions it is proper to dilate somewhat, as they not only coloured his life and reputation, but form no inconsiderable portion of the essential history of the man and his nature. The date of his first acquaintance with Mrs. Bracegirdle was doubtless that of his introduction to the stage. It is observable, that she not only acted the heroine in every one of his plays, but always spoke either a prologue or epilogue to it. Her appearance on these occasions is not less certain, than the dedication of the play to some man of quality. Gallantry and fashion always went hand in hand with Congreve. Among the exquisite portraits of stage contemporaries painted by Colley Cibber, \u2014 who could become serious, and even feeling, when describing a cordial woman, \u2014 the following one of this delightful actress remains ever fresh on the canvas : \u2014 \" Mrs. Bracegirdle was now just blooming to her maturity; her reputation as an actress gradually rising with that of her person ; never any woman was in such general favoui of her spectators, which to the last scene of her dramatic life she maintained by not being unguarded in her private character. This discretion contributed not a little to make her the caret, the darling of the theatre : for it will be no extravagant thing to say, scarce an audience saw her that were less than half of them lovers, without a suspected favourite among them ; and though she might be said to have been the universal passion, and under the highest temptations, her constancy in resisting them served but to increase the number of her admirers. And this perhaps you will more easily believe, when I extend not encomiums on her person beyond a sincerity that can he suspected ; for she had no greater claim to beauty than what the most desirable brunette might pretend to. But her youth and lively aspect threw out 6uch a glow of health and cheerfulness, that on the stage few spectators that were not past it could behold her without desire. It was even a fashion among the gay and young to haye a taste or tendre for Mrs. Bracegirdle She inspired the best authors to write for her ; and two of them, when they gave her a lover in the play, seemed palpably to plead their own passion, and make their private court to her in fictitious characters. In all the chief parts she acted, the desirable was so predominant, that no judge could be cold enough to consider from what other particular excellence she became delightful. To speak critically of an actress that was extremely good, were as hazardous as to be positive in one's opinion of the best opera singer. People often judge by comparisons where there is no"], [34, "XXIV BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. similitude in the performance. So that in this case we have only taste to appeal to, and of taste there can be no disputing. I shall, therefore, only say of Mrs. Bracegirdle, that the most eminent authors always chose her for their favourite character, and shall leave that uncontestable proof of her merit to its own value. Yet let me say there were two very different characters in which she acquitted herself with uncommon applause ; if anything could excuse that desperate extravagance of love, that almost frantic passion of Lee's \" Alexander the Great,\" it must have been when Mrs. Bracegirdle was his Statira : as, when she acted Millamant, all the faults, follies, and affectation of that agreeable tyrant were venially melted down into so many charms and attractions of a conscious beauty.\" * With this charming woman, not only Congreve is understood to have fallen in love, but Rowe ; who, by the way, if he did, left no small proof of the heartlessness of which some have accused him, in a bantering copy of verses upon her, in which Lord Scarsdale is encouraged not to be ashamed to marry her, though her father did keep an inn at Northampton. \" Do not, most fragrant Earl, disclaim Thy bright, thy reputable flame, , To Bracegirdle the brown ; But publicly espouse the dame, And say, G \u2014 d \u2014 the town,\" <x.c. It had not been discovered in those days, that a charming actress was worth marrying for her own sake, in proportion to the evidences she had given of genius and a good heart. Rowe, with a spite that would hardly have been found in a greater poet, and that is doubly revolting if he had loved her, compliments her upon the offers of wealth and rank which she had rejected, in the very lines which ridicule her parentage and her profession. Even one of these grounds of objection is said to have been false. A commentator in Nichols's edition of the Tatler (vol. i. p. 215), designates her father as \"Justinian Bracegirdle of Northamptonshire, Esquire,\" who \"ruined himself, among other ways, by becoming surety for some friends.\" Be this as it may, hear Davies's account of the share which Rowe as well as Congreve had in the admiration which she excited : \u2014 \"Mrs. Bracegirdle was the favourite actress of Congreve and of Rowe. In the several lovers they gave her in their plays, they expressed their own passion for her. In ' Tamerlane,' Rowe courted her Selima in the person of Axatta; in the 'Fair Penitent,' he was the Horatio to her Laviniaj and in ' Ulysses,' the Telemachus to Bracegirdle's Semanthe. Congreve insinuated his addresses in his Valentine to her A ngelica, in ' Love for Love ; ' in his Osmyn to her A Imeria, in the ' Mourning Bride ; ' and, lastly, in his Mirabel to her Millamant, in the ' Way of the World.' \"+ \" Honest Tom Davies \" proceeds to vindicate his heroine from the scandals of lawless \" Tom Brown,\" who tells us that Congreve \" dined with her every day, and visited her in public and private.\" The deduction thus intended to be implied cannot, argues Davies, be true, because Airs. Bracegirdle was visited to the last moment of her life by \" persons of the most unblemished character and the most exalted rank.\" He admits, at the same time, that Congreve's \" assiduous courtship did not pass unnoticed ; that he was constantly in her lodgings, and often rode out with her.\" Mr. Davies's gentle mystifications may be safely left to the reader's \" candour \" (to use a favourite word of those times). The toleration of polite life for temptations of the heart on the stage, has not been one of the least redeeming or sincere of its own claims to indulgence. Mrs. Bracegirdle's successor in the public admiration, Mrs. Oldfield, who was counted a model even to the fashionable world on every point but one, was intimate with the people of the \" most unblemished character and exalted rank.\" Mr. Davies subsequently tells us so himself; adding, that the royal family did not disdain to see her at their levees : and he repeats an amusing instance of her address. The princess of Wales (afterwards queen of George the Second) told her one day that she had heard * Cibbcr's 44 Apology,\" !2mo, ll)2fi, p. 102. t \" Miscellanies,\" ut sup , vol. iii.p. 36(1."], [35, "CONGREVE. XXV that General Churchill and she were married. \" So it is said, may it please your highness,\" said Mrs. Oldfield ; \" but we have not owned it yet.\" From collateral as well as other circumstances that transpire in the literature of the period, we take the conclusion respecting Bracegirdle to be, that she was more truly in love with Congreve than he with her ; that it is probable she expected him to many her ; that her expectations gradually gave way before his worldlier heart, probably to the ultimate consolation of her own, when he went to live with another ; and that sufficient friendship was retained on both sides, to maintain an affectionate interest in one another for life ; \u2014 in Congreve, because he was a gentleman and a man of sense ; and in the mistress, because the memory of the very dreams of a real regard is too sweet, to let the bitterness even of its waking turn angry. Congreve visited her to the last, and remembered her in his will, though not generously. And his kinder friend took what care she could of his reputation. \" When Curll, whom Dr. Arbuthnot (says Davies) termed one of the new terrors of death, from his constantly printing every eminent person's life and last will, published an advertise ment of Memoirs of the Life of Congreve, she (Mrs. Bracegirdle) interested herself so far in his reputation, as to demand a sight of the book in manuscript. This was refused. She then asked, by what authority his life was written, and what pieces contained in it were genuine. Upon being told that there would be several of his letters, essays, &c, she answered, ' Not one single sheet of paper, I dare say.' And in this (rightly concludes Davies) she was a true prophet ; for in that book there is not a line of Congreve which had not been printed before.* Cibber speaks of her in advanced life as retaining her usual agreeable cheerfulness. Some few years before her death, she retired, Davies informs us, to the house of W. Chute, Esq., and died in 1748, in the eighty-fifth year of her age, bequeathing \" her effects \" to a niece, \" for whom she expressed great regard.\" What sort of charms the greater lady possessed, for whose society Congreve appears to have forsaken that of Mrs. Bracegirdle, with the exception of her admiration of himself, her rank, and the beauty common to the house of Churchill, we know not. There is nothing to show for her having a grain of the other's sense and goodness. She was daughter and co-heir of the great Duke of Marlborough, and became duchess in her own right, and wife of the Earl of Godolphin. She was at variance with her mother, the famous Duchess ; but so was all the world. Congreve was older than she by eight or nine years. Lord Chesterfield, speaking of her husband on a political occasion, calls him \"that cypher; \" and intimates, that what ability he possessed consisted in \" sleeping.\" t Now certainly Congreve was a man for keeping a lady's eyes and ears open, however short he might have come of her heart ; and accordingly, he seems, for many years, to have been as regular at her Grace's table, as the wine. They had a good deal of music at the house. Bononcini, the rival of Handel, was patronised there. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu has a passage on the subject, which reminds us that she too was so intimate an acquaintance of Congreve as to address very Lady-Mary like verses to him, extremely resembling what in a male writer to a female would have looked like a declaration. \u00a3 Perhaps this may explain the remainder of the passage : \u2014 \" The reigning Duchess of Marlborough (writes her ladyship to her sister) has entertained the town with concerts of Bononcini's composition very often ; but she and I are not in that degree of friendship to have me often invited ; we continue to see one another like two people who are resolved to hate with civility.\"\u00a7 Congreve however, though not old, was now growing infirm. He had led a free and luxurious life ; had become gouty ; and was afflicted with cataracts in his eyes, which terminated in blindness. To relieve his gout, he took a journey to Bath, in the summer of 1728, for the benefit of the waters ; * Ut supra, p. 362 \u2014He alludes to \" Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Amours of William Congreve, Esq.\" purporting to be written by a Mr. Wilson, but supposed to be tbe manufacture of Oldmixon.

The Duchess of Marlborough took instant possession of the right of burial. On the Sunday following, the corpse lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber ; and the same evening was borne with great solemnity into Henry the Seventh's Chapel, and interred in the south transept of the Abbey. The pall was supported by the Duke of Bridgewater (whose first wife was the Duchess's sister), Lord Cobham (Pope's friend), the Earl of Wilmington (the dull man, whom Thomson took for a patron), George Berkeley (who married Lady Suffolk), and General Churchill (above mentioned, the friend of Mrs. Oldfield, and cousin, we believe, of the Duchess). Colonel Congreve, the deceased's relation, followed as chief mourner. In the Suffolk Correspondence are two short letters to Mr. Berkeley, which may be here given as characteristic of the Duchess : \u2014 \u25a0 \"Jan. 22, 1728-9. \" Sir, \u2014 I must desire you to be one of the six next Sunday upon this very melancholy occasion. I always used to think you had a respect for him, and I would not have any there that had not. I am, &c, Marlborough.\" The next letter appears to have been accompanied with some memorial of Congreve : \u2014 \"Jan. 28, 1728-9. \" Sir, \u2014 The last letter I writ to you was upon always having thought that you had a respect, and a kind one, for Mr. Congreve. I dare say you believe I could sooner think of doing the most monstrous thing iu the world than sending anything that was his, where I was not persuaded it would be valued. The number of them I think so of, are a mighty few indeed ; therefore I must always be in a particular manner, Tours, &c, Marlborough.\" * The word \" him \" in the first of these epistles, without any name specified, is touching. The other letter is slip-slop enough. A monument succeeded the funeral, the following inscription upon which was from her own hand : \u2014 \" Mr. William Congreve died Jan. the 19th, 1728, aged fifty-six, and was buried near this place ; to whose most valuable memory this monument is set up by Henrietta, Duchess of Marlborough, as a mark how deeply she remembers the happiness and honour she enjoyed in the sincere friendship of so worthy and honest a man, whose virtue, candour, and wit, gained him the love and esteem of the present age, and whose writings will be the admiration of the future.\" The old Duchess her mother, misquoting one of the words of this epitaph, said, \" I know not what pleasure she might have in his company, but I am sure it was no honour.\" f But the most curious evidence of her attachment remains to be told. According to Davies, she had an \" automaton, or small statue of ivory, made exactly to resemble him, which every day was brought to table. A glass was put in the hand of the statue, which was supposed to bow to her Grace, and to nod in approbation of what she spoke to it.\" J This is as fantastic though not half so sensible as the whim of the cobbler, mentioned in the \" Tatler,\" who had a lay-figure which reverently bowed and held out one shoe to him, while he was mending its fellow. A more particular account of this folly is given by a correspondent of the \" Biographia Britannica :\" \u2014 \" This lady (he says), commonly known by the name of the young Duchess of Marlborough, had a veneration for the memory of Mr. Congreve, which seemed nearly to approach to madness. Common fame reports, that she had his figure made in wax after his death, talked to it as if it had been alive, placed it at table with her, took great care to help it to different sorts of food, had an imaginary sore on its leg regularly dressed; and to complete all, consulted physicians with relation to its health.\"\u00a7 * Letters to and from Henrietta, Countess of Suffolk, _c., vol. i. p. 330. t Wnlpole's Reminiscences. 1819, p. 60. { Dramatic Miscellanies, vol. iii. p. 407. \u00a7 Biog. Brit. Second Edit. vol. iv. p. 79."], [37, "CONGREVE. XXVII As there seems however no better ground for these particulars than \" common fame,\" most likely they are exaggerated. Some of them, from what we have seen of the Duchess's turn of mind, may easily enough be believed. Nor were they wholly to be despised. There is something touching, notwith standing their absurdity, in the poorest whims connected with death and the affections ; though they generally evince a want of imagination, and of faith in the spiritual and exalted. What the spirit has done with, had better be put away; and the thought be contented to wander where the survivor's own spirit must follow. Love is more in company there with what it has loved, unless it has been of the most material description, and is tied and bound to what its companion has forsaken. The probability, we think, considering the characters of both parties, is, that Congreve's wit and conver sation were necessary to the slow yet sensitive mind and humorous habits of the Duchess, and that she consequently loved him with all the heart she had, and a great deal of obstinacy ; while on the other hand, Congreve was grateful for an attachment that glorified him and was convenient, and felt for her all the real tenderness of which a man of the world was capable, and which vanity would exaggerate. His bequest to her was quite as ridiculous in point of feeling, as her posthumous homage was in respect to the customs of society. With the exception of two hundred pounds to Mrs. Bracegirdle, the like sum to another female of the name of Anne Jellatt, and a few hundreds more to kindred who wanted all he could have given them (for the imprudence of a relation had reduced the family estate), he left her the whole of his property, which amounted to ten thousand pounds, \" the accumulation (says Johnson) of attentive parsimony ;\" and though the \" Biographia Britannica \" accuses Cibber of mistake in saying that he made her his sole executrix, the sole executor having been the Earl her husband, yet it strangely overlooks in its authority the fact of a codicil amounting to that effect, and revoking every bequest unless she chose to ratify it, with the exception of the two to \" Anne Bracegirdle \" and \" Anne Jellatt \" \u2014 fair friends whom, in spite of his dotage or his slavery, (for his conduct, next to vanity, looks very like a regular hen-pecked weakness,) he chose, with the last dying spark of a gentleman in him, not to trust to the tender mercies of the all-grasping Henrietta. Mrs. Bracegirdle, who defended his memory, appears to have been in circumstances to which more than the two hundred would have been welcome. \" Congreve,\" observed Dr. Young, \"was very intimate for years with Mrs. Bracegirdle, and lived in the same street, his house very near hers, until his acquaintance with the young Duchess of Marlborough. He then quitted that house.* The Duchess showed me a diamond necklace (which Lady Di. used afterwards to wear) that cost seven thousand pounds, and was purchased with the money Congreve left her. How much better would it have been to have given it to poor Mrs. Bracegirdle ! \"f Bravo, Doctor Young ! With leave of thy very gloomy, mitre-missing, and most erroneous \" Night Thoughts,\" this is the best and most christian thing thou didst ever say. Few men, if any, thoroughly surmount those prejudices in favour of rank and title in which they have been bred, and for which indeed, a3 part of the dispensation and progress of things, and as equally gifts after their kind with ascendancies more noble, a hardy logician could say more than many would suppose. The man the most jealous of his independence, had need watch his nature closely, lest he find himself inclined to be more grateful to a duke than to a commoner, and to a duchess than an ordinary mistress. A great and exquisite musician (Corelli) who had the reputation of being a very amiable man, and whose compositions are of a nature to confirm it, left all his property away from poor relations, to a Cardinal who had patronised him. It should be added, however, that Cqrelli looked upon the property as derived from the patronage. In Congreve's case, (unless indeed the bequest was to pay his bill for wine and dinners !) the ten thousand pounds came, not from the Duchess, but from the island of Jamaica, and the office of hackney-coaches ! We are afraid it is not to be defended, except upon the ground of excessive weakness, and of a class of intellect that ended with believing in nothing. To judge from his portraits, Congreve was a handsome man, though with a face more smooth and * The house which Young alludes to was in Surrey-street, Strand. Mrs. Bracegirdle l.ved in Howard-street, which turns out of Surrey-street. If Congreve left his house at this juncture, he appears to hav-e returned to it in his dying momenls.

He had high features, and a look between sensuality and foppish vivacity. The foppery, however, may have been added by the painter, and increased by the turn given to the attitude and the flowing peruke. There is a great contempt of coxcombry in his writings ; but this does not imply exception from the weakness. Sometimes it argues a greater share of it. No man is so vain, as he who thinks himself free from all vanity. \" Mr. Congreve,\" said Voltaire, \" had one defect, which was his entertaining too mean an idea of his first profession that of a writer, though it was to this he owed his fame and fortune. He spoke of his works as of trifles that were beneath him ; and hinted to me in our first conversation, that I should visit him upon no other foot than that of a gentleman, who led a life of plainness and simplicity. I answered that had he been so unfortunate as to be a mere gentleman, I should never have come to see him ; and I was much disgusted at so unseasonable a piece of vanity.\"* Various constructions, it is true, have been put upon this intimation of Congreve's. Dr. Johnson pronounces it a \" despicable foppery.\" Cibber characteristically looks upon it as an attempt to \" divest himself of human nature.\" But Mason is of opinion, that it was the \" indifference to literary fame,\" of a man advanced in life. And Dr. Campbell, the first editor of the \" Biographia Britannica,\" thinks it hard and strange, that an author should be reproved for being so modest as to \" undervalue his own works.\" The religious might discover a more serious exculpation. A Mr. Dingley (probably a friend of Swift's) told Dr. Campbell, upon the authority of Bevern the Quaker, that on a visit to Bevern in company with Pope, Congreve expressed sorrow for the errors of his youth, and \" most sincerely wished that it were possible to obliterate all the offensive and impure passages in his works. \"t But setting aside the possibility that the Quaker's story may have been a pious fraud, or become exaggerated in its progress from mouth to mouth, Congreve never expressed any public sorrow for his writings, as a sincere penitent would have seized occasion of doing. Neither did his mode of life announce any feeling of the sort. And some verses which he addressed in his decline to Lord Cobham, show that his morals were of the old epicurean sort, though calmed and philosophised. The climax of his list of the goods of life is \u2014 \" Health, honour, and a fair estate, A table free, and elegantly neat I \" \" What \" (exclaims he, at the crowning inspiration of this line), \" What can be added more to mortal bliss ? Congreve had not got his gout for nothing. The conclusion respecting the Voltaire question we take to be, that our author, who was both a reader and thinker, and had suffered pain and evil enough to drive his thoughts to their depth, had really come to consider his works as no very wonderful things ; and he felt perhaps, when reminded of them by a young and enthusiastic admirer (as Voltaire then was), some little irritation at finding the sum total of his powers and aspirations rated by no higher standard. There may still have been a vanity in this, but it was at least not a contented vanity, or one that recognised nothing greater than its own achievements. If, however, he affected to set the \" gentleman \" above the author, upon some abstract ground of fashion and refinement, that indeed was being a traitor to wit, and setting the less above the greater with a very madness of foppery ; as though, in some dream of dandyism, he should have clapped a cocked-hat over his crown of bays. Congreve's acquisition of the fame which has been deemed so perilous (\"when all men speak well of you,\") may be accounted for on two opposite principles, and will redound to his praise or dishonour accordingly. It may have been owing to unbounded benevolence, or to a calculating selfishness. But there may also have been mixed motives. Congreve has the solid reputation of never having forgotten any one who did him a service. And he always adhered to the Whigs prosperous or otherwise. On the other hand, he continued to do this without giving offence to the * Letters on the English Nation. t Biographia Britannica, ut supra, p. 79."], [39, "CONGREVE. XXIX Tories ; and though he never forgot a benefactor, it is not told of him, nor does it seem likely from his writings, that he ever risked any thing, or encountered any kind of martyrdom or privation, to benefit anybody. The best thing we find recorded of him is, his having given a young author a paper for a new periodical, and his writing it out with his own hand, \" blind as he was \" (says Swift). This, by the way, was in the year 1710 ; which was eighteen years before his death, and shows how early he was threatened with loss of sight* But again, he bequeathed a pittance to his reduced kindred, and to \" poor Mrs. Bracegirdle,\" and gave thousands where they were not wanted, \"Adding the sum of more To that which has too much ; \" a \" testament,\" as Shakspeare has remarked, characteristic of \" worldlings.\" Congreve therefore might still have been \" Friendly Congreve, unreproachful man,\" as Gay called him ; his company might never have been quitted by anybody with one pang of personal mortification, as Steele has told us ; and even Pope and Tonson, in the fondness of their regret, might say of him, that he, Garth, and Vanbrugh, were the \" three most honest-hearted, real good men of the poetical members of the Kit-kat Club ; \" and yet the conclusion seems unavoidable, that he was negatively rather than positively amiable, and must be ranked among the agreeably selfish. (What a blessing if all the selfish were equally agreeable !) We can easily understand how a man of his sort might be too good-tempered and sensible to discompose either himself or others, and yet make a rich duchess his heir, and leave a poor relation to sigh over the \" Way of the World.\" If you want truer amiableness and more generous virtues, you must go to the greater world of nature and the beautiful, and not take the little world, miscalled the great, for the planet on which it is but a speck. There is one evidence in Congreve, nevertheless, of the love of the highest aspirations, which has always puzzled us, and which, if it had not been for this bequest, would have forced us to give him credit for being superior, at heart, to his worldly tendencies. And indeed it is impossible to say, that such might not have been the case in his healthiest days, which are those in which the entire man is to be estimated. We allude to the power he had to write such verses as those on Lady Gethin, aud such papers as the one he contributed to the Tatler, on the character of Lady Elizabeth Hastings, \u2014 an effusion so full of enthusiasm for the moral graces, and worded with an appearance of sincerity so cordial, that we can never read it without thinking it must have come from Steele. It is in this paper that he says one of the most elegant and truly loving things that were ever uttered by an unworldly passion : \u2014 \" To love her, is a liberal education.\" Alas ! why does the faith in good and beauty sometimes light up the human bosom, as if only to show that every heart has a corner capable of reflecting it for a moment, but not strong enough to retain it ! \u2014 And yet, let us be glad that even the temporary capability is there. Time, and healthier institutions, and then custom and convention itself, will bring the rest. Meantime the plays of Congreve will not help the advancement, except inasmuch as their narrow views contradict worse bigotries, and serve to neutralize both. His love is spare and sorry ; his belief in nothing, abundant ; the whole set but a mass of wit, and sarcasm, and fine writing ; \u2014 of brilliant exposures of hollowness, and of plots so over-ingenious as to become perplexing and tiresome. Speaking for ourselves, indeed, we can never attend sufficiently to the plots of Congreve. They soon puzzle us, and we cease to think of them. We see nothing but a set of heartless fine ladies and gentlemen, coming in and out, saying witty things at each other, and buzzing in some maze of * 44 Congreve gave me a Tatler he had written out, as blind as he is, for little Harrison.

Yet incessant activity is there ; the first demand of life, movement, is supplied ; and no human beings are as bad as they sometimes flatter themselves they are, or as the gay comic writer amuses his activity by supposing them. But above all we must confess we find the \" wit \" become tiresome. We love it heartily in its proper places, in Butler, Swift, and Addison, where it is serving some purpose greater than itself; and we love it still more, when it issues out of sheer animal spirits, and is happy as a child. But wit for wit's sake becomes a task and a trial ; and in Congreve's days it was a cant, like the talk about \"sense\" and \"reason;\" \u2014 as if all sense, and reason, and wit, had been comprised in the substitution of the greater faculties of man for the less, and the critical for the unconscious. Everybody was to be \"witty.\" Letters were to be full of \"wit,\" and end in some \" witty turn.\" Coffee-houses were to talk nothing but \" wit.\" Ladies were to have \" wit and sweetness,\" and gentlemen \" wit and fire ;\" not the old \" mother-wit\" of Shakspeare and his fellows, which was a gift from the whole loving frame of Nature ; but a trick of the fancy and of words, which you might almost acquire from the brother-wits of the tavern, and which dealt chiefly in simile, with a variation of antithesis. Every thing seemed to be of value, only inasmuch as it could be likened or opposed to something else ; till at length simile and metaphor came to be taken for a \" reason ; \" and \" sense \" itself was occupied, not in seeing into anything very deeply for its own sake, but in discovering how far it was capable of being split off into a couple of images. The great wits, to be sure, bantered the less, and affected to laugh at the affectation ; but it was only for the purpose of guarding its rank and distinctions. This cant of wit, which affected \" manly Wycherley\" himself a great deal more than it ought, came to its head in Congreve, and pretty well ceased with him. Vanbrugh was too robust and straight forward to care for it, and Farquhar too fall of play. From the artificial nature of Congreve's plays, partly owing to this wrong direction of his ingenuity, and partly to the sophisticate excesses of his men and women, and the riddles of his plots, we have scarcely retained an impression of them sufficiently distinct from one another to enable us to do justice to each, though we have just read them through for the express purpose, and marked them, and made notes besidea. The \" Old Bachelor \" was thought astonishing for its knowledge of life, from an author not out of his teens ; but the critics have long discovered that there was no such \" knowledge \" in it as a youth so clever might not easily have attained. The wonderful thing was, the use he made of the knowledge, and the freedom from all appearance of immaturity. Dryden and Southerne, it is true, helped to fit it for the stage ; but it is not likely that they made any great alteration in the main body and spirit of the thing, or the prevailing amount of its \" sense.\" The characters of Wittol, Bluffe, and Fondlewife, are old stage property, as may be seen by their names ; and the whole play, generally speaking, is hut a wittier and less hearty re-fashionment of the style of Wycherley. Yet the reader, who has patience enough to watch the dialogue closely, will be rewarded with perpetual evidences of a quick observant mind, and of that conscious mastery over his pen and his sphere of action, which the new satirist of the circles appears to have felt the moment he entered them. The passage we call to mind with the greatest pleasure is the eighth scene of act the fourth, where Belinda sets her hair to rights, and describes the two girls from the country, whose dress she adjusted for them, and one of whom in gratitude gave her \"two apples, piping hot, out of an under-petticoat pocket.\" Pereant male qui ante nos, _c. The \"fat amber necklace \" of the mother is a touch of genius. The \" Double Dealer,\" with the solemn reciprocities of Lord and Lady Froth, and the capital character of Lady Plyant, \"insolent to her husband, and easy to every pretender,\" is far superior to the \" Old Bachelor.\" Congreve excels in mixtures of impudence, hypocrisy, and self-delusion. The whole of the fifth scene of the second act, between Lady Plyant and Mellefont, is exquisite for the grossness of the overtures made under pretence of a delicacy in alarm. But it is no wonder a comedy did not succeed that has so black a villain in it as Maskwell, and an aunt who has a regularly installed gallant in her nephew. Sir Paul Plyant also says things to his daughter, which no decent person could hear with patience between father and child. The writer's object might have been a good one; but it is of doubtful and perilous use to attempt to do good by effrontery. It was on"], [41, "CONGREVE. XXXI occasion of this play that Dryden addressed to Congreve his famous epistle, full of strength and good-nature, and almost as full of mistake. The dramatists of Charles the Second's age were described as superior in \"skill\" to the \"giant race\" their predecessors. Fletcher could \"move,\" but had no power to \"raise;\" Ben Jonson doubled Fletcher's \"force;\" but all and everybody submitted to Congreve, except Shakspeare ; and even he had but \" as much \" in him ; for Nature \" could not give him more ! \" But the panegyrics of this age, for want of that highest kind of truth on all sides, which only belongs to the highest genius, supplied defect of warmth with extravagance of attribution. There was generally a bargain in the matter : writers paid each other in kind, and lords paid dedicators in money. A natural excess of feeling on the part of the grateful, must be allowed to have had its share in the exaggeration. Flattery is not always insincere ; and modesty itself may help to beguile gratitude into adulation, out of a doubt of its ability to render what is due. \"Love for Love\" is the most amusing of all Congreve's plays, and the characters the least unpleasant. There are no revolting scoundrels ; and the lovers really have some love. Jeremy is most improbably witty, for a servant ; even though he once \" waited on a gentleman at Cambridge.\" Alias Prue is not so naturally cunning as Wycherley's Country Wife, nor such a hearty bouncer as Vanbrugh's Hoyden ; but she is a very good variety of that genus. The detection of one another by Mrs. Frail and Mrs. Foresight \u2014 \" Where did you lose this gold bodkin ? oh, sister, sister ! \" \u2014 \" Well, if you come to that, where did you find this bodkin? oh, sister! sister every way !\" is ever fresh and retributive. Mr. Hazlitt has noticed the startling profundity of Valentine's request to his father, to disinherit him, not simply of the family estate, but of the passions and appetites which he begot in him. A less original, but like unconventional intimation, is noticeable in the claim put in by the servant, to be considered on a level in that respect with gentlemen : \u2014 \" Sir Sampson. 'Oons, whose son are you ? How were you engendered ? Jeremy. I am, by my father, the son of a chairman ; my mother sold oysters in winter, aud cucumbers in summer; and I came upstairs into the world, for I was born in a cellar. Foresight. By your look you Bhould go up stairs out of the world too, friend. Sir Sampson. And if this rogue were anatomised now, and dissected, he has vessels of digestion and con coction, and so forth, large enough for the inside of a cardinal, this son of a cucumber. These things are unaccountable and unreasonable.\" \" The character \"of Foresight,\" says Johnson, \" was then common. Dryden calculated nativities ; both Cromwell and King William had their lucky days ; and Shaftesbury himself, though he had no religion, was said to regard prediction. The Sailor is not accounted very natural, but he is very pleasant.\" We know not why the Sailor should have been accounted unnatural, except that he appears to be a common sailor, and yet is the son of a man of fortune. It used to be said that sailors do not talk like sailors, nor use a sea-jargon ; but they do. They talk, as other people do, within the limits of their experience. As to Shaftesbury, it is far from surprising that they who have no religion should yet be liable to superstition. They are often but the more at mercy of it, from the want of any set limits to belief. The demand for books of astrology is considerable at the present moment ; and perhaps has never failed. Mankind cannot get rid of a sense of the unknown world, if it would ; and till it takes to it in the widest and most poetical sense, which is also the healthiest and most natural, \u2014 such as a child instinctively has when it looks at the stars, \u2014 it will dabble in the darkest borders of it, with a knowledge less than childish. The \" Mourning Bride \" is not uninteresting in its story, nor so bad in its poetry as one might expect from the want of faith and passion natural to a town-wit of that age. Dr. Johnson, indeed, out of his amazing unacquaintance, or want of sympathy, (not to speak it irreverently) with poetry of the highest order, tells us, that if he were \" required to select from the whole mass of English poetry the most poetical paragraph,\" (observe the instinct of that word !) \"he knows not what he could"], [42, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. XXXII prefer to an exclamation in the \"Mourning Bride ;\" and then he quotes the passage in the third scene of act the second, where Almeria is so affected by the awful aspect of the interior of a cathedral. The passage indeed is a poetical one, and the best that Congreve wrote. The strong material presence of a cathedral-aisle, aided by the help of those thoughts of death which everybody experiences in looking at tombs, gave him a sufficient knock on the head to stir him to some emotion and attention, notwithstanding the neutralizing levity of his peruke. But a lover of the old poets will laugh as much at Johnson's unique notions of it, as the writer of the English ballad does at the irreparable loss which he supposes to be felt in Scotland at the death of a single hero : \u2014 \u25a0 \" I trust I have within my realm Five hundred as good as he.\" As the love of the \"Mourning Bride,\" however, is defaced with the cant and sensuality of gallantry, so the style, for the most part, is poor, undubred (in a poetical sense), and instinctively prosaical ; speaking neither with the richness nor the simplicity of passion, nor above the common place of conventional metaphor. If the tragedy were revived now, the audience would laugh at the inflated sentences and unconscious prose. The revival of old English literature, and the tone of our best modern poets, have accustomed them to a higher and truer spirit. Yet some of the language of Almeria, as where, for instance, she again meets with Osmyn, is natural and affecting ; and it is pleasing to catch a man of the world at these evidences of sympathy with what is serious. Nor are sensible and striking passages wanting. It is in this play, and the \" Way of the World,\" that are to be found some of those rhyming, sententious couplets which have become proverbial, and which their quoters are often at a loss in what author to find. *' Heaven has no rage, like love to hatred turn'd, Nor hell a fury, like a woman scorn'd.\" Mourning Bride. \u2014 Close of Act III. \" For blessings ever wait on virtuous deeds, And though a late, a sure reward succeeds.\" Idem. \u2014 Close of the Play. \" If there 's delight in love, 'tis when I see The heart which others bleed for, bleed for me.\" Way of the World.\u2014 Act III., Scene 12. The \" Way of the World,\" though not the most amusing, is assuredly the most complete, piquant, and observant of all the works of Congreve ; full as an egg of some kind of wit or sense in almost every sentence, and a rich treat for the lover of this sort of writing, sitting in his easy-chair. Atillamant pushes the confident playfulness of a coquet to the verge of what is pleasing ; but her animal spirits and good-nature secure her. You feel that her airs will give way, by-and-by, to a genuine tenderness ; and, meanwhile, some of them are exquisite in their affected superiority to circumstances. \"Mrs. Fainall. You were dressed before I came abroad. Millamant. Ay, that's true. \u2014 0, but then I had \u2014 Mincing, what had If WJiy was I so long ? Alincing.

Lord, what is a lover, that it can give , Why, one makes lovers as fast as one pleases, and they live as long as one pleases, and they dis as soon as one pleases, and then, if one pleases, one makes more.\" Mrs. Mincing, who pins hair up \" so pure and crips,\" is the most niminy-piminy of attendants. /ict the fifth opens with one of Congreve's exquisite descriptions of common life :"], [43, "CONGREVE.

Very little poetry of any sort is there in the \" Miscellanies \" of Congreve, and not much of his accustomed wit. To his scholarship, as Dr. Johnson observed, the public were indebted for the discovery, that Cowley's irregular versification was not Pindaric; though, in a directly critical sense, he can hardly be said to have first taught the knowledge to \" English writers ;\" for the example of the true Pindaric (as far as metre goes) had been set with pedantic nicety by Ben Jonson. Congreve professes not to be aware * of the existence of a precursor in this reformation ; and most likely he had forgotten Ben's miscellaneous poetry, though he had well studied the dramas of the old scholar. He retained a better recollection of Spenser ; for in the \" Elegy on the Marquis of Blandford,\" (the son of his friend the Duchess of Marlborough,) the toiler through its common-places is agreeably surprised at coming upon one or two passages of real fancy and tenderness, evidently suggested by the verses of the great poet on the \" Death of Sir Philip Sydney.\" All his other \" Mourning Muses,\" and serious poems of any sort, with the exception of a passage in his ode upon the singing of Arabella Hunt, (for he had a real feeling for music,) are, for the most part, to use a frank epithet applied to some of them by Johnson, \" despicable.\" He sometimes follows Cowley so ill, that he may be said to imitate Sprat !\u2014 as in the \" sigh \" which Silence occupies by way of \"throne,\" and which has been \" purposely annihilated \" to oblige him with that accommodation ! There is now and then a strenuous couplet in his translations, caught from the tone of Dryden. His art of \"Pleasing\" consists in a freedom from affectation ; which though a necessary, is hut a negative part of it. In his best songs he is remarkable for the absence of everything that is inverted in words, or superfluous to the thought ; and here also his wit returns ; but he implies, as usual, little cordiality in his gallantry. The following, however, is written in the spirit of a gentleman. SONG. False though she be to me and love, I '11 ne'er pursue revenge ; For still the charmer I approve, Though I deplore the change. In hours of bliss we oft have met, They could not always last ; And though the present I regret, I 'm grateful for the past. The following is more characteristic of his writings in ordinary ; as full of wit, and what was thought \" sense,\" as it is deficient in sentiment. It is needless to add, that epicures of this sort are ignorant of half of what they think they know best, the very luxury of the senses. SONG. Tell me no more I am deceived, That Chloe 's false and common ; I always knew, at least believed, She was a very woman. As such I liked, as such caress'd ; She still was constant when possess'd She could do more for no man. * See the Discourse on the Pindarique Ode prefixed to one of Congreve's poems on King William ; aud, in Ben Jonson's works, the \" Pindaric Ode \" to the memory of Sir Lucius Cary and Sir H.

You think she 's false, I'm sure she's kind, I take her body, you her mind ; Which has the better bargain ? The perplexed heroine of the next has been thought to be \" poor Mrs. Bracegirdle.\" SONG. Pious Selinda goes to prayers, If I but ask the favour ; And yet the tender fool \"\"s in tears, When she believes I '11 leave her. Would I were free from this restraint, Or else had hopes to win her ! Would she could make of me a saiut, Or I of her a sinner ! Congreve had an admiration of fair saints ; which indeed is natural to a sinner of his sort. But \" Doris \" was thought his master-piece. The critics of the age, with good-natured Steele at their head, wanted words to express their admiration of \" Doris ; \" \u2014 Doris, which was the concatenation of everything new, and playful, and profound ; \u2014 Doris, the \" inimitable Doris,\" which, for aught that Greece or Home had to show to the contrary, might have been written by Horace or Menander, or Virgil himself ; nay, by Lord Dorset, or the Earl of Halifax. But we must not jest with a name like Steele, because we happen to live in an age which has been taught better. \" Doris \" is, in truth, very acutely and pleasantly written, and, to this day, not a little startling ; though the character was not a new one, even with Congreve. It shall be the last of our extracts in verse : \u2014 DORIS. Doris, a nymph of riper age, Has every grace and art A wise observer to engage, Or wound a heedless heart. Of native blush and rosy dye Time has her cheek bereft ; Which makes the prudent nymph supply, With paint, the injurious theft. Her sparkling eyes she still retains, And teeth, in good repair ; And her well furnish'd front disdain To grace with borrowed hair. Of size, she is nor short nor tall, And does to fat incline No more, than what the French would call Aimable embonpoint. Farther her person to disclose I leave : let it suffice, She has few faults, but what she knows, And can with skill disguise. She many lovers has refused, With many more complied"], [45, "CONGREVE. XXXV Which, like her clothes, when little used, She always lays aside. She 's one who looks with great contempt On each affected creature, Whose nicety would seem exempt From appetites of nature. She thinks they want or health or sense, Who want an inclination; And therefore never takes offence At him who pleads his passion. Whom she refuses, she treats still With so much sweet behaviour, That her refusal, through her skill Looks almost like a favour. Since she this softness can express To those whom she rejects, She must be very fond, you '11 guess, Of such whom she affects. But here our Doris far outgoes All that her sex have done ; She no regard for custom knows, Which reason bids her shun. By reason, her own reason's meant, Or, if you please, her will ; For when this last is discontent, The first is served but ill. Peculiar, therefore, is her way ; AVhether by nature taught, I shall not undertake to say, Or by experience bought. But who o'er night obtain'd her grace, She can next day disown ; And stare upon the strange man's face, As one she ne'er had known. So well she can the truth disguise, Such artful wonder frame, The lover or distrusts his eyes, Or thinks 'twas all a dream. Some censure this as lewd and low, Who are to bounty blind ; For to forget what we bestow, Bespeaks a noble mind. Doris our thanks nor asks nor needs, For all her savours done : From her love flows, as light proceeds Spontaneous from the sun. On one or other still her fires Display their genial force, And she, like Sol, alone retires, To shine elsewhere of course. Congreve's undramatic prose writings are few and of little importance.

VANBRUGH. The father-land, birth-place, and very name of Vanbrugh, have been involved in doubts, not uninteresting where men of eminence are concerned. The stock has been derived, not only from the Netherlands, but from Cheshire, and from France. He is generally said to have been born in the parish of St. Stephen's, Walbrook ; but Mr. Disraeli would seem to have discovered, that it was in Paris, in the Bastile ! And Lysons, and others, spell him, not \"Vanbrugh, but Vanburgh. The report of the family's having originated in France, seems to have been owing to nothing more than the popular error which used to take every foreigner for a Frenchman. The Cheshire descent may be disposed of by the circumstance of his father's having once resided at Chester. The birth in the Bastile depends upon whether we are to take the word literally or metaphorically : and that the prevailing mode of spelling the name is the right one, is obvious from the crest of the family coat-of-arms, which is a demi-lion issuing from a bridge, with its arches reversed ; \u2014 a symbol, corro borating the Flemish origin, and most likely recording some achievement of the ancestor on whom it was conferred.* The Low Countries are full of bridges ; and as warriors and architects alike have had to do with them at periods of invasion, perhaps it was some military, perhaps some civil exploit, which obtained for the ancestral Vanbrugh this record of the ruined bridge ; and a love of architecture may thus have become hereditary in the race. The account, and apparently the only account, which Vanbrugh himself gave of his family, when he applied for a confirmation of this coat-of-arms to the Heralds' College, was, that before the persecution of the protestants by the Duke of Alva, it lived near Ghent in Flanders. We may, therefore, safely follow the biographers in bringing it over to England on that occasion, in the person of his grandfather, Giles Vanbrugh, who settled as a merchant in the parish of St. Stephen's, Walbrook, where he died in the year 1646. His son, another Giles Vanbrugh, is reported to have settled in Chester, as a sugar-baker, and to have acquired such a fortune as appears to have lifted him into the ranks of gentry, since he is styled esquire by a herald of that day, when the title had not become the common property which it now is ; and it is added, that removing to London, he obtained the place of comptroller of the Treasury-Chamber. This Giles, who died in 1715, three years after his wife, (so that they both lived to see the eminence of their son,) married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Dudley Carleton, of Imbercourt in Surrey, nephew of the celebrated statesman of that name, afterwards Lord Dorchester, who, together with his nephew, bore such a part in the diplomatic relations of England and Holland ; and of the eight sons of this marriage, our author, John, was the second.f The date of his birth is not ascertained, but is supposed to have been in the year 1666, the Annus Mirabilis of Dryden. It is pleasant to think, that if the necessity of the progress of things demanded that this year should be memorable for purifications by fire and sword, it should also be secretly producing the enjoyments of peace, and the better helps of the * See Noble's History of the College of Arms, 4to, 1804, p. 35.r\u00bb. + A brother of Giles's (William) married another daughter of Sir Dudley.

For Nature, who made laughter, is no ascetic. She does not desire that the rough surgeries of pain should be as lasting as the health of pleasure. The passage in Vanbrugh's writings, in which Mr. Disraeli appears to have discovered his birth place, is one in which, alluding to a chance of being thrown into prison, he says, that he should thus finish his days in an English bastile, as he \"began them in a French one.\"* This, if taken literally, is decisive. On the other hand, the doubt of Mr. Allan Cunningham is worthy of notice, \u2014 that Vanbrugh may have spoken, not in a literal sense, but with reference to a story reported by his biographers, which says that he once got shut up in the Bastile for being caught taking a sketch of it ; and that he owed his deliverance to an impression which he made on some influential people by amusing himself with rude sketches of comedies, t This story is not improbable, as it is consistent throughout not only with his genius as writer and architect, but with another profession to be spoken of presently, as well as with the fact of his having been, at all events, some years in France. He might thus have meant, by beginning his days in the Bastile, that he began, so to speak, his public days, \u2014 or, in a high and stirring sense, to live ; \u2014 the days of his \" manhood,\" as Mr. Cunningham says ; or simply, that he was its tenant, as the same writer observes, \" early in life.\" And yet the burden of disproof lies on the side of those who object to the plain and literal meaning of any given words ; nor can it be held at all improbable, that Vanbrugh was actually born in the French prison. The year 1666, among its other marvels, beheld a sudden declaration of war against the restored monarchy of England, by its friend Louis the Fourteenth, originating in the views of the latter upon the Low Countries ; and as the Carleton family were great political agents in those questions, it is not at all unlikely that the future comptroller of the Treasury-Chamber, father of our author, and husband of a Carleton, had some delicate business to transact in Paris, which got him clapped into \" durance vile.\" It is well known that ladies as well as gentlemen were locked up in that most ungallant fortress of our gallant neighbours, sometimes for taking a part themselves in these higher niceties of intrigue.\"!: Had Vanbrugh's father a turn for architecture before him 1 or for writing comedies t or both 1 agreeably to what is so often seen of the appearance of those germs of ability in parents, which come to a head and reputation in the offspring. Mr. Disraeli's production of the passage in question has, at all events, served to throw fresh mystery over the Bastile transaction, whatever it was, in our author's life, and to mix up anew the father's history with the son's. Of the education of Vanbrugh we are told nothing, except that it was liberal, and that during his teens, like Wycherley, he was sent to France ; probably to complete it ; perhaps to study architecture, or soldiership ; very likely both ; (no unusual, nor unprofitable mixing up of studies in those days ;) for on his return to England, he entered the army as an ensign. He may have studied engineering, in order to include military architecture. It is more clear, that going to France at the age of nineteen, and remaining there some years, the animal spirits of the young dramatist must have received no small encouragement to that freedom of speech and morals, which afterwards ran, like so much claret and burgundy, through his comic vein. Where, or when indeed, he accomplished himself for his profession of architect, still remains among the obscurities of his biography ; nor is it known how long he continued in the army. He appears a good while afterwards, to have been styled \" Captain,\" about town ; but in the year 1695, when he is supposed to have been twenty-nine, we find him, as \" Mr. Vanbrugh,\" appointed secretary to the commission for endowing Greenwich Hospital, on the nomination of the celebrated John Evelyn ; and two years afterwards, or less (for the confused state of the calendar at that time renders it difficult to distinguish between year and year), his first play, the \" Relapse,\" was brought out at Drury Lane. This comedy, however, had been sketched some time before. The tradition is, that he had drawn * Curiosities of Literature, ed. 1039, p. 413. t Lives of the most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, vol. iv. p. 256. t See an autobiography delightful for its candour, the Memoirs of Madame de Staal ; who was involved in the political schemes of the Duchess du Maine, in the time of the Regency."], [50, "XL BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. the outlines both of the \" Relapse \" and the \" Provoked Wife,\" while in the army (the latter first) ; and that having, during winter-quarters somewhere, become acquainted with Sir Thomas Skipwith, who had done him a pecuniary service and was one of the sharers in Drury Lane theatre, Sir Thomas encouraged him to complete the \"Relapse\" for his stage; upon which Vanbrugh had the good fortune to repay his friend's kindness by a success which the theatre stood much in need of. With profits to the house, reputation flowed in upon the author. His friend, who appears to have been rich, and not exclusively anxious for his own stage, would not balk the new dramatist of the patronage of the M\u00e6cenas of the day, Montague, afterwards Lord Halifax, then on the eve of his greatest honours. Bespeaking his third venture for Drury Lane, Skipwith suffered him at Montague's desire to complete the \" Provoked Wife \"for the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, at which it came out the following year, and maintained the promise of the \" Relapse.\" The venture for Drury Lane, which was produced the same year, was \" \u00c6sop,\" a moral lecture from the French of Boursault ; which though it had some sprightly additions from the pen of the adapter, (the whole of part second,) must have astonished the gay audiences of the two first pieces, and did not meet with the success that might have been wished for generous Sir Thomas. It was hoped, no doubt, that credit would be given to the author for having the inclination and the power to instruct as well as to amuse, \u2014 to be grave as well as to be gay ; but prose comic writers seldom appear in earnest enough to be able to make this demand upon the belief of their hearers with safety. There will be thought to be some trick in it, as there is ; and there are more reasons why the piece did not succeed at the time, which will be mentioned when we come to speak of the plays critically. In 1700, at the same theatre, Fletcher's comedy of the \" Pilgrim \" was adapted to the taste of the times by our author, and its third night's benefit given either to Dryden or his son Charles, upon condition of his furnishing those aids of \" Prologue \" and \" Epilogue,\" &c. which appear in his poems. Dryden was then dying, in the full blaze of his powers; for he, to whom nobody's prologues and epilogues, before or since, ever came near, never wrote two finer ones than he did on this occasion, \u2014more full of easy mastery and felicitous application ; and the lyrics which accompanied them (the \" Secular Masque,\" &c.) were so brilliant with his old dashing music, that John Buncle, in the full roar of his animal spirits, could find nothing of more potential joviality, wherewith to give vent to the plenitude of his satisfaction at having had a good dinner. But we were going to say, that though it is not known whether Dryden hailed the genius of Vanbrugh as he did that of ConTeve it is always pleasant to find these links of intimacy between celebrated men. The \" False Friend,\" a Spanish love-plot, upon an old and obvious subject, is only worth recording for its having been brought out in the year 1702. Almost all that deserves noting in it, may be here set down in a dozen lines ; but the passage is of the right Vanbrugh sort, and fall of an off-hand and pleasant assurance : \u2014 \"Don John. Well, old acquaintance, you are going to be married then ? 'Tis resolved, ha! Don Pedro. So says my star. Don John. The foolisliest star that has said anyth ma a great while. Don Pedro. Still the same, I see ! or, more than ever, resolved to love nothing. Don John. Love nothing ! why, I'm in love at this very time. Don Pedro. With what ? Don John A woman ! Don Pedro. Impossible ! Don John. True. Don Pedro. And bow came you in love with her ? Don John. Why. I was ordered not to be in love with her.\" In the same year, 1702, Vanbrugh made, we believe, his first architectural design of celebrity, that of Castle Howard in Yorkshire, the seat of Charles, third Earl of Carlisle ; who was so pleased with it, that being deputy Earl-marshal during the minority of the Duke of Norfolk, and having nothing more appropriate, we suppose, to give him, he presented him with the tabard of'darencieux."], [51, "VANBRUGH. XLI king-at-arms. The appointment greatly offended his new brethren, the heralds, for two reasons ; first, because he knew nothing of heraldry ; which argued, they thought, a strange moral laxity on the part of the deputy-marshal ; and second, because with a reprobacy that rendered the ignorance unpardonable, he laughed at it ! Swift, who disliked Vanbrugh, because he girded at the cloth, and was of the Whig party, said that he might now indeed pretend to \"build houses.\" Vanbrugh laughed at heraldry ; yet we have seen him apply to the college he ridiculed, for the confirmation of a coatrof-arms. Men would fain be above their fellow-creatures on the side of intellect, yet are always restoring the equilibrium on that of vanity and the passions ; \u2014 let us add, on that of the social affections also ; for every conventional tendency, however sophisticate, has a ground in it of the love of others ; and it is well that it should be so. Charity is secretly ensured by it, as society proceeds ; and it will ultimately secure the improvements, that receive gradual assent. Vanbrugh's double success as author and architect, having now, with the help of his agreeable qualities as a man, rendered him popular with all classes, he thought he might at once enrich himself, and help to restore the interests of an old company of actors then declining, by erecting a theatre of nobler dimensions, and getting Congreve to aid him in the production of plays which Betterton was to get performed. He accordingly had interest enough with thirty persons of quality, to procure subscriptions from them for the purpose, at a hundred pounds each ; and the first stone of the theatre was laid on the site of the present opera-house, and inscribed with the words \" Little Whig,\" in honour of the reigning toast of the party, the Countess of Sunderland, one of the daughters of Marlborough ; whose fair hand, we presume, was the first to tap it with the silver trowel. But the architect, seduced by the opportunity of showing the metropolis the grandeur of his ideas, either forgot the purpose for whicli his building was erected, or made some venturous miscalculation in his acoustics ; for its huge sides and sound-sustaining roofs turned out to be fitter for song than dialogue ; the actors, according to Cibber, were heard gabbling below, as in the aisles of a cathedral, with hollow reverberations ; and as the present west end of the town was at that time more than half made up of fields and meadows, and the frequenters of pit and gallery had to come from such a distance as made coach-hire expensive, the project died, like the poor actors' voices, in its own magnificence. In vain the two wits and joint-proprietors strained their united faculties. In vain, as if by ominous anticipation, they opened their theatre with a sort of compromise between Italian and English, a translated opera with Italian music. In vain our author followed it with one of the liveliest of his productions, the \" Confederacy.\" In vain the more prudent Congreve backed out of the dying concern, and left his colleague to try an infusion of the spirit of Moliere, three of whose liveliest plays, in the same season, he translated and put on the boards, the \" Cocu Imaginaire \" (Cuckold in Conceit) ; \" Monsieur de Pourceaugnac,\" as \" Squire Trelooby ;\" and the \" Depit Amoureux,\" as the \" Mistake.\" Vanbrugh was himself forced to give up a speculation which, except on a small scale, and then only with aid from wits of another sort, appears never to have succeeded in the hands of authors. We know not on what occasion, years afterwards, he was induced to translate a farce from the French of D'Ancourt, not worth the trouble, \u2014 the \"Country House.\" The \" Journey to London \" was left unfinished at his death ; and here then, as the rest of his life seems to have been devoted to architecture, we may anticipate the chronological termi nation of his writings. He reversed the fate experienced by Ariosto. The Italian, being reminded of the smallness of the abode he had built for himself, compared with the magnificence of the palaces in his fiction, said he found it easier to build houses with words than with stone. Vanbrugh found stone more edifying than words ; and he lost no time in repairing his fortunes accordingly. Every help was afforded him. No sooner does he appear to have concluded his theatrical struggles, than Queen Anne, in the year 1706, commissioned him to carry the habit and ensigns of the Order of the Garter to the Elector of Hanover ; and in the same year, he built a house for himself at Whitehall, and was occupied in raising the great structure of Blenheim. We know not the dates of his various architectural works, nor are they necessary to the volume before us. But we must not omit the great trouble of his life, the dispute he got into with the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough respecting the Blenheim payments. It appears that Parliament, by no very generous d"], [52, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. XLII oversight, had voted the building of the mansion, without taking care of supplies for it. The Queen paid them while she lived ; the Duke, who loved money, occasionally doled out a little afterwards, always protesting that he had nothing to do with the matter ; the Duchess, after her lord's decease, tried to make Vanbrugh himself responsible ; and the poor architect, thus driven from pillar to post, out of pocket, ashamed, alarmed, and finally exasperated, had a violent quarrel with that insolent woman, which ended with her taking the work out of his hands, and refusing himself and his wife even a sight of it when finished, though finished after his own design. Vanbrugh had gone thither on purpose, with a party of friends from Castle-Howard; which must have aggravated the mortification. \" We staid,\" says he, \" two nights in Woodstock ; but there was an order to the servants, under her grace's own hand, not to let me enter Blenheim ; and lest that should not mortify me enough, she having somehow learned that my wife was of the company, sent an express the night before we came there, with orders that if she came with the Castle-Howard ladies, the servants should not suffer her to see either house, garden, or even to enter the park ; so she was forced to sit all day long, and keep me company at the inn.\" * There was a voluminous correspondence on the subject between the Duchess and Vanbrugh, and notices of it, highly characteristic of him, in letters to his friend Tonson, the bookseller. The following dramatic touches are selected from portions of them in Disraeli : \u2014 \" I have the misfortune of losing, for I now see little hope3 of ever getting it, near 2000Z., due to me for many years' service, plague, and trouble, at Blenheim, which that wicked woman of Marl. borough is so far from paying me, that the duke being sued by some of the workmen for work done there, she has tried to turn the debt due to them upon me, for which J think she ought to be hanged.\" And again, after the Duke's death, \u2014 \" He has given his widow (may a Scottish ensign get her) 10,000-;. a-year to spoil Blenheim her own way ; 12,000^. to keep herself clean, and go to law,\" &c. And the following \" explosion,\" as Disraeli calls it ; in which is to be found the passage that is supposed to have determined his birth-place : \u2014 \" I have been forced into Chancery by that B. B. B. the duchess of Marlborough, where she has got an injunction upon me by her friend the late good chancellor (earl of Macclesfield),t who declared that I never was employed by the duke, and therefore had no demand upon his estate for my services at Blenheim. Since my hands were thus tied up from trying by law to recover my arrears, I have prevailed with Sir Robert Walpole to help me in a scheme which I proposed to him, by which I got my money in spite of the hussy's teeth. My carrying this point enrages her much, and the more because it is of considerable weight in my small fortune, which she has heartily endeavoured so to destroy as to throw me into an English Bastile, there to finish my days, as I began them, in a French one.\" What the formidable array of B's may portend, at the beginning of this extract, might perhaps be not uncandidly guessed by the philosophic reader, from parallel passages in the remarks of Shakspeare on heaths, and Dr. Johnson on witches, \u2014 aided by a serene illustration from the colloquies of Bishop Burnet ; of whose absence of mind Walpole has the following anecdote, in connection with this very duchess. Dining with her one day after the Duke's disgrace, his lordship was comparing him to Belisarius. \" But how,\" said she, \"could so. great a general (as Belisarius) be so abandoned V\" Oh, madam, \" said the bishop, \"do not you know what a brimstone of a wife he had V'$ * See the article entitled \" Secret History of the Building of Blenheim,\" written by Mr. Disraeli with his usual spirit, in the Curiosities of Literature, ut supra, p. 413. t Impeached and found guilty of corruption in 1725, for selling the post of Master in Chancery.

In 1714 he was knighted by the new sovereign, George the First, to whom he had taken the Garter when Elector. He was appointed comptroller of the royal works next year, and surveyor of the works at Greenwich Hospital the year after ; and on the death of the then Garter King-at-arms, he was nominated to succeed him ; but Anstis claimed the office on the strength of a promise from Queen Anne, and after long efforts obtained it. The wife mentioned in the extract from his Letters, was Henrietta Maria, daughter of Colonel Yarborough of Haslington near York, whom, from a passage in the Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague, we conjecture him to have married towards the close of the year 1710. He was then five-and-forty, and the lady perhaps ten or fifteen years younger \u2014 some say twenty. Lady Mary, in the insolence of eighteen, calls her a \"ruin.\" The following is the passage in her Letters alluded to : \u2014 \"I can't forbear entertaining you with our York lovers (strange monsters, you '11 think, love being as much forced up here as melons). In the first form of these creatures is even Mr. Vanbrugh. Heaven, no doubt, compassionating our dulness, has inspired him with a passion that makes us all ready to die with laughing : 'tis credibly reported that he is endeavouring at the honourable state of matrimony, and vows to lead a single life no more. Whether pure holiness inspires his mind, or dotage turns his brain, is hard to find. 'Tis certain he keeps Monday and Thursday market (assembly day) constantly ; and for those that don't regard worldly muck, there 's extraordinary good choice indeed. I believe last Monday there were two hundred pieces of women's flesh (fat and lean) : but you know Van's taste was always odd : his inclination to ruins has given him a fancy for Mrs. Yarborough : he sighs and ogles so, that it would do your heart good to see him ; and she is not a little pleased, in so small a proportion of men amongst such a number of women, that a whole man should fall to her share. \u2014 My dear, adieu. My service to Mr. Congreve. \" M. P.\" (Mary Pierrepont.)* This delicate epistle, written in her ladyship's maiden state and twentieth year, was addressed to the sister of her lover and future husband, Mr. Wortley Montague ; but Mr. Wortley Montague was a \"bold man,\" and he suffered for his bravery. Our author's marriage, on the other hand, is said to have been a happy one ; and by the various dwellings he possessed, he must have passed the remainder of his life in a state of affluence. Besides his house in town, he built two at Greenwich, on a spot since called Vanbrugh Fields. He appears, at one time, to have been living in Berkshire, near the residence of his old friend Tonson,t for whom he had a great regard. In Rowe's parody upon the dialogue between Horace and Lydia, the warm-hearted bookseller (for such he seems to have been, in spite of occasional irritabilities between him and his authors) is thus represented as speaking of Vanbrugh : \u2014 \" I 'm in with Captain Vanbrugh at the present, A most sweet-natured gentleman, and pleasant ; He writes your comedies, draws schemes, and models, And builds dukes* houses upon very odd hills ; For him, so much I dote on him, that I (If I was sure to go to heaven) would die.\" It ia more than probable, from the masterly nature of the piece which he left unfinished, and which promised to be his best, that Vanbrugh had resumed his stage enjoyments, and was still \" writing your comedies,\" when he died in his sixtieth year, at his house in Scotland Yard, March 26, 1726.

Vanbrugh survived him for the space of forty years, not dying till April 1776. The biographies vary about the number of their children. One says they had three ; another an only son. Two, however, appear to have died in infancy. The son became an ensign in the Guards, and died of the wounds he received at the battle of Fontenoy. Vanbrugh had a character in society, such as might be expected from the account given of him by Rowe. \" Garth, Vanbrugh, and Congreve \" (says Spence, on the authorities of Tonson and Pope), \" were the three most honest-hearted, real good men, of the poetical members of the Eit-kat Club.\" He was a Whig, whose sincerity and good-nature enabled him to survive party animosity. Swift and Pope, when they published their Miscellanies, openly regretted their raillery against \" a man of wit and of honour.\" He jested upon heraldry when he entered the herald's office, probably thinking his colleagues would jest too ; and his only resentment on record is that against the Duchess of Marlborough, who was such a woman as his very love of the sex might have made him disgusted with. But he seems to have been happily constituted in mind and body. He had a \" fine, elegant, manly person,\" says Noble ; and the best engraved portraits of him, after Kneller, give him a face to match it. Vanbrugh Btands alone in the history of letters for combining the apparently incompatible geniuses of comic writer and architect. Yet surely they are not so, for a secret reason and proportion is at the bottom of all works of art ; and while the men of letters, not unjealously perhaps, laughed at his architecture, the public discerned a grandeur in it ; and an artist (Sir Joshua Reynolds) thought that it benefited by the aid of the writer's fancy, and possessed a pictorial and daring originality. The passage in his Lectures, in which the architect is vindicated, is so well felt and written, that we cannot deny ourselves the pleasure of repeating it. \" In the buildings of Vanbrugh, who was a poet as well as an architect, there is a greater display of imagination,\" he says, \"than we shall find, perhaps, in any other ; and this is the ground of the effect we feel in many of his works, notwithstanding the faults with which many of them are charged. For this purpose, Vanbrugh appears to have had recourse to some principles of the Gothic architecture, which, though not so ancient as the Grecian, is more so to our imagination, with which the artist is more concerned than with absolute truth.\" To speak of him, \"in the language of a painter, he had originality of invention ; he understood light and shadow, and had great skill in composition. To support his principal object, he produced his second and third groups, or masses. He perfectly understood in his art, what is the most difficult in ours, the conduct of the back-ground, by which the design and invention are set off to the greatest advantage. What the back-ground is in painting, in architecture is the real ground on which the building is erected ; and no architect took greater care that his work should not appear crude and hard, that is, that it did not abruptly start out of the ground without expectation or preparation.\" This is a tribute which a painter owes to an architect who composed like a painter, and was defrauded of the due reward of his merit by the wits of the time, who did not understand the principles of composition better than he, and who knew little or nothing of what he understood perfectly, the general ruling principles of architecture aud painting. Vanbrugh's fate was that of the great Perrault. Both were the objects of the petulant sarcasms of factious men, and both have left some of the fairest monuments, which to this day decorate their several countries ; the fas ade of the Louvre ; Blenheim, and Castle-Howard. We have ourselves never seen any of the great architectural works of Vanbrugh ; to say nothing of our inability to pronounce judgment, if we had. But in common with others, we may state the impression which has been made upon us by pictures of them in books, and which is that of a bold and liberal will, desiring to produce a princely effect, and doing it.* On the other hand, we cannot help thinking, that in minor buildings, such as that, for instance, of the church of St. John's, Westminster, (which we have seen,) he is simply heavy and Dutch ; and in his least of all, or the * In Kensington there was lately a small but curious structure, which was originally intended to supply the palace with water, and strongly exemplified what may be called the no nonsense style of Vanbrugh ; the ends of which were use. durability, and energetic appearance. The Palish School in the same suburb is also from the hand of Vanbrugh, and presents a similar character."], [55, "VANBRUGH XLV whims of his fancy, we suspect that Swift's jests about \" mouse-traps \" and \" goose-pies \" were hardly unwarranted. Swift describes people looking about Whitehall, to know where Vanbrugh's house was to be found, and making inquiries of the \" watermen \" and the \" Thames : \" \" At length they in the rubbish spy A thing resembling a goose-pie.\" Now Vanbrugh built another trifle of this sort at Greenwich, which was called, perhaps by himself, the \" mince-pie house ; \" and another again at the same place, which he dubbed by the undomestic title of \" The Bastile,\" probably in commemoration of the event in his life, whatever it was, which kept the original in his mind. But these whims and their christenings indicate a taste of no very good sort, on the lighter side ; nothing like the magnificent will that \" upheaved \" Blenheim. Perhaps, by an indulgence of the same will, however, in its unbendings, the comic writer was himself jesting in these instances with brick and mortar, not very happily. As to Walpole, who ridiculed his grander efforts, Walpole really had a solid judgment in most things, hardly to be expected from his effeminate temperament ; but the latter predominated in his own Gothic toys of wood ; and one fancies Vanbrugh, if he had had a mind to build on Strawberry Hill, putting his manly leg upon Horace's little pinnacles, and crushing them as he might have done a house in a toy-shop. There was a heavier though smaller wit in Vanbrugh's days, one Dr. Evans, who in echoing the jokes of the greater ones, had the luck to hit upon a couplet which has survived all his other writings and his very name, and even had the good fortune, in its way down to posterity, of dropping a superfluous fellow couplet ; for the whole jest was originally in four lines, and stood thus : \u2014 \" Under this stone, reader, survey Dead Sir John Vanbrugh's house of clay Lie heavy on him, earth I for he Laid many heavy loads on thee I\" * After all, as there is undoubtedly a national as well as family blood in a stock, and the portraits of ancestors who lived centuries ago startle those who see the faces of their posterity, Vanbrugh may have derived the heavy portion of his architecture from the Flemish bridge-masters of his house, while to the daughter of the English diplomatist, assisted by a French education, may be owing the plot and gaiety of his drama \" There are more things, even in a turn, for jesting, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\" His character as a comic writer is clear and obvious. It is straightforward, cheerful, confident, and robust ; something between Flemish and French ; not over-nice in its decorums, not giving too much credit to conventional virtues, nor yet disbelieving in the virtues that will always remain such, and that are healthy and hearty ; but as his jovial and sincere temperament gave him a thorough dislike of hypocrisy, the licence of the times allowed him to be plain-spoken to an extent which was perilous to his animal spirits ; and an editor in these days is startled, not to say frightened, at sallies of audacity and exposure, which, however loath to call affrontery, he is forced to think such, and is only prevented by belief in the goodness of his heart from concluding to be want of feeling. Of feeling indeed, in the sentimental sense, Vanbrugh shows little or none. He seems to have thought it foreign to the satire and mirth of comedy. His plots are interesting, without having the teasing perplexity of Congreve's; and he is more uniformly strong than Farquhar, and cheerful than Wycherley. What he borrows, he seems to change at one blow into something better, by sleight, or rather force, of hand. He is easy in invention, and true and various in character. His style is * For diverB immemorabilia of Doctor Evans, the curious lover of books may consult Nichols's Collection of Poems, vol. iii. and iv. ; and Dodsley'8, vol. i. p. 158. He was not destitute of humour ; but it was rare in quantity, rather than quality. Gray, in a letter to Walpole, says of him, in reference to his poem in Dodsley, \" Dr. Evans is a furious madman ; and 4 Pie-existence ' is nonsense in all its altitudes.\""], [56, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. XLVI so natural and straightforward, that Cibber says the actors preferred it to every other, it was so easy to learn by rote. What he wants (except at the bottom of his heart) is every species of refinement, but that of a freedom from all cant and nonsense. He has no more poetry in him, in a sense apart from what is common to everything artistic, than a sailor who would see nothing in Shakspeare's \" Bermoothes,\" except the turtle. But in a superiority to circumstances sophisticate, the bestbred of o-allants could not beat him, whether from absence of veneration, or presence of good health. His Lord Foppington is the quintessence of nullification, and of the scorn of things which he does not care for ; while Aliss Hoyden, without delay or \" mistake,\" is for consolidating everything into the tangible and plenitudinous, for which she does care. In short, if Vanbrugh's father had had wit and perception enough in him to give him a right, he might have said to him, as Sir Anthony Absolute saiA to the Captain, his son, when he vented the height of his astonished and fatherly satisfaction at his having been a better love-maker than he took him for, \u2014 \" Jack, you certainly are an impudent dog.\" It was complained of, with regard to Vanbrugh's first comedy the \" Relapse,\" that he had taken the penitent of Cibber's play (\" Love's Last Shift \"), and made him fall into his old ways again ; which hurt the moral. But Vanbrugh laughed at the morals of Cibber. He knew that so flimsy and canting a teacher could only teach pretences ; and in undoing his work he left society to find out something better. On the other hand, when Cibber took up the author's unfinished play, the \"Journey to London,\" and fancied that he had improved it with his Lord Townly and Lady Grace, and his insipid perfect gentleman, Mr. Manly, he made a blunder of such dull vanity and time serving self-love, as it is melancholy to think of in the sprightly Colley, but much more to read, after reading Vanbrugh's three acts ! It is worth the reader's while to refer to Cibber's play, and compare them. What a poor, pick-thank set of common-place usurpers of attention, \u2014 of pretenders to a \" clear stage and no favour,\" \u2014 after the heartier moral fair-play of Vanbrugh ! What a half-sided lesson, taking it at its best, and a servile playing into the hands of the stronger sex, as if nothing could be more exemplary or further-sighted I The very name of Lord \" Loverule \" instead of \" Townly,\" shows that the \" reciprocity \" was not to be all on one side in Vanbrugh's play. But everything is miserably washed down in Cibber, even to poor John Moody and the footmen. Dick Amlet, Airs. Amlet, and Brass, in the \" Confederacy,\" are all perfection, after their kind, \u2014 the unfeeling son, whose legs are doted on by his mother ; the peddling mother, hobbling about, with fine ladies in her debt ; and Brass, exquisite Brass, whom one can hardly help fancying made of the metal that christens him, and with a voice that rings accordingly. We know of no better comic writing in the world than the earlier scenes of Lord Foppington in the \" Relapse,\" and those between Dick Amlet and his mother, and of Brass securing his bargain with Dick, in the play before us. We find we have passed over the \" Provoked Wife,\" which, to say the truth, is a play more tree than pleasant ; and it is not so much needed as it was in Vanbrugh's days, when sottishness had not become infamous among decent people. So long do the vices of the stronger sex contrive to have themselves taken, if not for virtues, at least for something like manly privilege ! One reason has been given why \" \u00c6sop \" did not succeed. Another we take to be that the French, in their old levity, used to think themselves bound to sit out any gravity that appealed to their good sense ; while the English never pretended to be able to dispense with something strong and stirring. Besides, morality of so very obvious and didactic a sort was too great a contradiction to the taste of the times, and to Vanbrugh's own previous indulgence of it. Rakes scouring the streets at night, and ladies carried off swooning with love from antechambers, had ill prepared the sons and daughters of Charles the Second for the lessons of the sage Grecian, adapting his \" wise saws \" to \" modern instances.\" \" How Van wants grace, who never wanted wit !\" says Pope : and it is true. Yet this graceless wit, often far less so than he appears, and covertly implying virtues superior to their common forms, has a passage in one of the coarsest of his plays, that preaches a love truer than any to be found in Pope : \u2014"], [57, "VANBRUGH. xlvii \" Constant.

But the old question may here be \u00e6ked, \" What signify one or two passages of this sort, when all the rest is so different?\" To which it should long ago have been answered, everything ; when the difference is more in appearance than reality, and fighting the battles of virtue itself by unmasking the pretenders to it. With the exception of a defence of himself against Collier, which will be noticed in its proper place, and the disputes respecting Blenheim with the Duchess of Marlborough, we know not of a single miscellaneous piece of writing of Vanbrugh's, except the following sprightly verses in Nichols's collection. It possesses, we fear, not a little of his usual \" face,\" without his usual good-nature ; but let us hope the lady knew nothing of it.

George Farquhar, the son of a clergyman, some say of a dean of Armagh, others of a poorer man with a living of a hundred and fifty pounds a-year and seven children, was born in Londonderry, in the year 1678, and received there the rudiments of education. The humbler origin, as is generally the case, is most likely the true one ; for when he was sent to Trinity College, Dublin, under the patronage of Dr. Wiseman, bishop of Dromore, he was entered as a sizer or servitor, the holder of the lowest rank among collegians, and one that used in those days to wait upon the others, after the fashion of a lay-brother in a monastery. To this ungenial position is partly perhaps to be attributed the character for \" dulness,\" and even disagreeableness, with which, according to some of his biographers, he was charged at this period by his fellow-students; for, according to the description of himself, given by his own pen in after life, and of the impression his first appearance made upon strangers, he seems always to have required a congeniality of circumstances to \" fetch him out,\" and set the sprightliness and cordiality of his nature flowing. But those whom he served must have been duller than he, not to have detected the fire and good-nature that was in him, especially as the charge, singularly enough, was accompanied with objections to his having no taste for studies that were serious. Be this as it may, whether from uncomfortableness of position, or the death of his patron (as some say), or from the following ebullition of graeelessness, he did not remain his full time at the university. We gather from the statements of the biographers, that having had a college exercise given him, upon the subject of Christ's walking upon the water, he was very late with it ; and making an offer, which was accepted, of contributing something on the spur of the moment, he either produced an audacious epigram, or made a remark before he sat down to write, referring to the proverb about \" the man who is born to be hanged.\" The story is not very likely, unless those who set him the exercise were of a dulness and natural inferiority to himself, sometimes provoking to wits in the bud ; nor, if the story is to be believed, are we to conclude that he meant any disrespect at heart, to the name which all good hearts must bow to. Wit and boldness are often thought good things for their own sake, especially by a youth ; and great regret is felt afterwards for the pain they may have occasioned. The probability is, that whatever were the particular overt acts of petulance, or habits of nonconformity, of which Farquhar may have been guilty, he was no very regular student in general, nor fond of the tasks assigned him ; perhaps had already become a lawless haunter of the theatres ; and so, between levity and natural genius, he got an ill name, and a speedier dismissal than he would otherwise have had, into that greater university of the world, which he was fitted to adorn. Whether he had already been in the green-room or not, he now rushed into it. He offered himself to the manager as an actor, was accepted (probably as a God-send, being a young gentleman from college), and came out forthwith in the character of Othello. It is touching to observe how fond almost all young actors are of making their first experiments in tragedy. It is not merely because tragedy ranks above comedy, and they are vain and ambitious ; but because there is a sincerity and earnestness in all enthusiasm, which of itself is a grave feeling, and naturally enough impels them upon showing how much in earnest they are. Farquhar is said to have had a fair amount of ordinary qualifications for the stage, except voice and confidence.. His voice wanted power; he never got over the disease well known by more actors than is supposed, called \"stage fright ;\" and though the audience always showed him a respectful attention, and his good qualities appear to have speedily widened his popularity with his sphere of action, an awkward circumstance completed the uneasiness of his theatrical endeavours, and, in the eighteenth year of his age, put an end to them for life. He was playing the part of the good lover and brother, Ouymnar, in the \u00ab Indian Emperor\" of Dryden, when having to kill Vasqu\u0153, and forgetting that he happened to"], [59, "FARQUHAR. XLIX wear a real sword instead of a foil, he wounded his brother-performer so dangerously, that his life was for some time despaired of. Farquhar's tender nature was so shocked, that he instantly quitted the boards. It is probable, however, that he would have turned out no great actor. No dramatist ever did. He is said to have been a beautiful reader of his plays ; hut he arrived at no eminence as one of their performers. Shakspeare, Ben Jonson, Heywood, Lee, Otway, Murphy, all were actors in their time, for a greater or less period, but none have left a reputation as such. Perhaps a better actor-dramatist never appeared, than the author of \" Virginius\" and \" William Tell ;\" and yet his sensible and manly performance on the stage by no means comes up to the height of his pen. Is it that the very sensibility of the poet baffles him in action ? Yet how is it, in that case, that Mrs. Kean is not hindered by her tears ; or that Mr. Macready can feel the father so well in \" Virginius,\" and yet act it better than the robust poet himself? Is it that the poet feels too many of the minute shades of the part he is acting, to go well enough to the main points of it ? Hardly that ; otherwise actors would not be great in proportion to their combination of these minute shades with general effect. Ib it (to give one more conjecture) that the poet, being always accustomed to meditation rather than action, and feeling that a double merit is expected of him, ia perplexed between habit and self-love ? Something, perhaps, of that ; and more, in all probability, from the necessary counter habits of that meditation to the business, and bustle, and practical every-day life, of the rehearsing and reciting actor. Shakspeare might, perhaps, if he had chosen to set his wits that way, have been the greatest actor that ever lived ; but then he could not have found time to be the poet he was. He would have missed the soft and still air in which poetry delights to grow. In the Dublin theatre Farquhar is supposed to have first become acquainted with Wilks the actor, whose celebrity he was destined to increase ; and who, like himself, was born and educated in a sphere of life not so often found in connexion with the stage as its friends might desire. Wilks about this time was returning to an engagement in London ; Farquhar accompanied him, and is thought by some to have been indebted to his zeal for an introduction to the Earl of Orrery, who gave him a commission in the regiment under his lordship's command in Ireland. Wilks has also the reputation of having made him a writer as well as a soldier. He is said to have never ceased encouraging the literary abilities he discerned in him, till he produced a play. But as nothing is known of this gentleman's connexion with Orrery, and he had no character assigned him in Farquhar's first production, the probability is at least equal, that our author's own family and promising genius procured him the favour of a nobleman, in whose race a congenial spirit was hereditary. Be this as it may, he retained his commission several years, in the course of which he is said to have given various proofs \" both of courage and conduct,\" though how they were called forth during the languid conjuncture of affairs that took place during the period, we are not told ; for Ireland had been lately pacified, and the new officer does not appear to have even looked upon any region of active service, till he went into Holland in the year 1700, where his letters do not imply his having taken part in it. However, it is not in battle alone that an officer may give proofs of spirit and capacity. At all events, Farquhar, no longer a \" servitor,\" doubtless became a pleasant companion and messmate ; and like a proper genius, he turned the lightest of his military experience to account, as we shall by and by have occasion to see. Gibbon himself, as he lets us understand, was not a heavy militia-man for nothing. The \" Decline and Fall\" felt the steps of his \"marching and counter-marching.\" Captain Farquhar's plume floated over his genius for comedy, and his \" reputation about town.\" It is curious to observe how many of our wits and dramatists of that period were captains. There was Captain Wycherley (for a time), then Captain Vanbrugh, Captain Farquhar, Captain Steele ; with a plentiful minor crop of Captain Radcliffes and Ayloffs before them ; as in later times we have had Captain Morrises and Tophams. Military service has indeed never been found uncongenial to letters, whether in its most positive or negative degree, from C\u00e6sar down to Captain Tibullus, or Cervantes to Frederick of Prussia. The leisure in the intervals of study and enjoyment, contrasted with the idea of peril, as it serves to \"make love,\" stimulates wit to the writing of verses. The French and English campaigns of the late wars have produced an abundance of authors ; and it was probably in the intervals of his military duties, whether in field or in quarters,"], [60, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. L that Farquhar wrote half his comedies, beginning with his first, with its gay, officer-like title of \" Love and a Bottle.\" ... The author opens this piece in a way which, in all probability, was characteristic of his condition at the time, as well as of the good-natured sort of genius which the world was to expect of him. His hero enters, full of poverty and animal spirits, with a dramatic quotation m his mouth an intimation of his wish to turn soldier, and evidence of a tolerating disposition in the midst of his sarcasm. \" Act I., Scene \u2014 Lincoln's Inn Fields. \"Eater Roebuck, ot a riding-habit, solus (repeating the following line).

Prithee, friend, why wouldst thou beg of me ? Dost think I am rich ? \" Crip. No, sir ; and therefore I believe you charitable. Your warm fellows are so much above the sense of our misery, that they cast'* pity us.\" \" Love and a Bottle, \" which came out at Drury Lane, in the year 1698, was well received. It has been thought strange, that the author's friend, Wilks, had no part in it; but arrangements of this kind often depend upon circumstances with which friendship, and the wishes of the parties, have nothing to do. We shall give a reason, however, by and by, why we take Wilks, with all his gaiety, to h_ve been a very worldly, prudent man ; and he might not have chosen to risk himself in a part' untried. It is one thing to have a good opinion of a man's general abilities, and even to encourage him to adventure them in a particular direction (as Wilks is said to have done), and another to commit the adviser's fortunes with the experiments of the poor advisee. Wilks was glad enough, at all events, to appear in the next play of the now successful dramatist. Success, wit, and his cheerful good-nature, speedily obtained for Farquhar an influence upon the town \u25a0 and we find, next year, a pleasant instance of it upon the future fortunes of the celebrated Mrs. Oldfield. She was then sixteen, and niece of a Mrs. Voss, who kept the Mitre Tavern in St. James's Market. The story tells us, that Captain Farquhar, dining there one day, \"heard Miss Nanny read a play behind the bar, with so proper an emphasis and such agreeable turns, suitable to each character, that he swore the girl was cut out for the stage, to which she had before expressed an inclination, being very desirous to try her fortune that way. Her mother, (continues the narrator, a quondam servant of Rich's the manager,) the next time she saw Captain Vanbrugh, who had a great respect for the family, told him what was Captain Farquhar's advice ; upon which he desired to know, whether, in the plays she read, her fancy was most pleased with tragedy or comedy. Miss, being called in, said comedy ; she having, at that time, gone through all Beaumont and Fletcher's comedies ; and the play she was reading, when Captain Farquhar dined there, was the ' Scornful Lady.' Captain Vanbrugh, shortly after, recommended her to Mr. Christopher Rich,"], [61, "FARQUHAR. LI who took her into the house, at the allowance of but fifteen shillings per week. However, her agreeable figure, and the sweetness of her voice, soon gave her the preference, in the opinion of the whole town, to all the young actresses ; and his grace the late Duke of Bedford being pleased to speak to Mr. Rich in her favour, he instantly raised her allowance to twenty shillings per week. Her fame and salary at length rose to their just merit.\"* We have made this extract, not only for the pleasant picture it furnishes of the young and afterwards famous beauty, first interesting Farquhar with reading \" behind the bar,\" and then being \" called in,\" and introduced to Vanbrugh, but out of repect to the memory of a generous woman, admirable in her day for her comic genius, and honourable with posterity as the patroness of Savage. It has been supposed that a tenderer reason grew in Farquhar's mind for the interest he took in the young actress ; and that she is the Penelope of the letters which he has left us. She, at all events, retained a pleasant recollection of him. \" I have often heard Mrs. Oldfield mention the many agreeable hours she had spent in Mr. Farquhar's company,\" says an authority referred to in her \"Memoirs.\" This is a privilege of the amiable, whatever circumstances may have conspired to part them. The ensuing year, 1700, produced at the same theatre, the \" Constant Couple.\" \u2014 And hereby hangs a little bit of a tale of discovery, which, in default of having anything newer to relate about Farquhar, will not be uninteresting to our brother Columbuses of the book-shops. In one of the thick and abundant catalogues, which Mr. Thorpe, the bookseller, so magnificently gives away, we lately met with the little volume entitled \" Adventures of Covent Garden,\" to which Farquhar ia said to have been indebted for some of the incidents in this play, and which had a note appended to it in the catalogue to that effect. Upon looking into it, we found in the fly-leaf the original of this note in the shape of a manuscript remark, under the signature of \" Isaac Reed,\" to whom the book appears to have belonged ; and upon consulting the article \" Constant Couple \" in one of the editions of the Biographia Dramatica, which had the benefit of the co-operation of Mr. Reed, the following observations made their appearance, being probably the above manuscript remark drawn out into due length : \u2014 ' \" The early writers of the English drama appear to have made free, without scruple, with any materials for their dramas which fell in their way. The present is a remarkable instance. In the preceding year, 1699, was published a small volume, entitled ' The Adventures of Covent Garden, in Imitation of Scarron's City Romance,' 12mo, a piece without tlie slightest degree of merit ; yet from thence our author (Farquhar) took the characters of Lady Lurewell and Colonel Standard, and the incidents of Beau Clincher and Tom Errand's change of clothes, with other circumstances. The character of Sir Harry Wildair, however, still remains the property of the author, and he is entitled to the credit of the general conduct of the piece. Perhaps his only fault may have been in not acknowledging the writer, contemptible as he is, to whom he was obliged.\" Now on reading this book \"without the slightest degree of merit,\" it is clear enough that the author, \"contemptible as he is,\" was Farquhar himself.t The \"character\" of Lady Lurewell, properly speaking, is not in the book, though some of her conduct is ; neither ia the production by any means \" without the slightest degree of merit,\" for it possesses some good, hearty, criticism, in vindication of genius against rules ; and what marks the production as Farquhar's, is not only this criticism (which he afterwards enlarged upon in his \" Discourse upon Comedy \"), and his mention of the author as \" a young gentleman somewhat addicted to poetry and the diversions of the stage,\" to say nothing of hia use of the \" change of clothes,\" &c, but in this little prose work the poem * From 44 Memoirs of Mrs. Anne Oldfield,\" quoted in the Biographia Britannica, art.

LII first appears, which, with the addition of six lines, he afterwards published in his Miscellanies under the title of the \"Lover's Night.\" In the \"Adventures of Covent Garden\" it consist, of fifty-two lines \u2022 in the \u00ab Miscellanies,\" of fifty-eight. We \u00ab hope,\" as Shakspeare says, \"here be proofs. We are far from wishing to undervalue the industry of Isaac Reed, or the utility of his researches; and mistakes are common to everybody : but we here see what was the amount of his criticism, when taken unawares. Scorn, which is perilous to the pretensions of the greatest men, is ruinous to those of the less. It is curious enough, and perhaps was not without design, that the \" Lurewell \" of the \" Constant Couple \" and its sequel, whose early history in one respect resembles that of the famous Mrs. Manly, author of the \" New Atalantis,\" is said in the play to have been the daughter of a \" Sir Roger Manly.\" Mrs. Manly herself, who was making a noise at the time the play was written, was the daughter of a Sir Oliver Manly. She was a Tory, and very hostile to the Revolution, and Farquhar was a friend to it ; but she was also a wit, a play-wright, and a woman of gallantry ; Farquhar may have become acquainted with her in those characters ; and from the result of a mixture of feelings, better guessed than described, might thus have been ultimately led to take a liberty with her name, hardly compatible with his own gallantry and good-nature ; unless we are to suppose that he regarded a woman of her scandal-loving and uncompromising partisanship, as putting herself out of the pale of her sex. She herself libelled freely her own quondam admirers, Sir Richard Steele among them. In the May of this year (1700), our author, whether by accident or design, \u2014 most likely the latter, as \" everybody \" seems to have been there, and a dramatist would probably go as a mourner, \u2014 was present at the much-discussed funeral of Dryden, of which he has given what Sir Walter Scott calls a \" ludicrous account.\" The account (which the reader will see at the close of the life) is certainly written under an impression of the ludicrous ; but whatever exaggerations of the business may have been created by such reporters as impudent Tom Brown, and poor gossiping Mrs. Thomas, we cannot but think that the ceremony must have been mixed up with a good deal that was strange and ill-managed, and that precaution had not been taken to give the procession its proper gravity, or guard against the attendance of disrespected and disrespectful persons. Dryden passed his whole life between homage and abuse, between the high life in which he was born, and the shifts to which narrow circumstances reduced him ; and agreeably to this sort of existence, his very corpse seems to have been scrambled into its grave, betwixt anxiety and irreverence. In the summer and autumn of the same year, we find our author in Holland, probably with his regiment, awaiting the anti-gallican movements of King William, which, however, came to little or nothing that season ; nor does it appear that Farquhar ever saw any very hot service, whatever proofs he may have given of his aptitude for it. In his sympathy with those around him, and his zeal for the security of the Revolution, he persuaded himself that a knowledge of the Dutch language was necessary to the interests of his countrymen ; and lamented, that young gentlemen preferred going to France instead of Holland, in order to see the world ; opinions that sound oddly enough from the lips of the lively Farquhar. But, like all wits of a high order, he had gravity as well as levity in his composition, and was easily attracted towards whatever he thought of importance to his fellow-creatures. In October, William returned to the Hague, where Farquhar then was, from one of his visits to his retreat at Loo ; and the young dramatist and officer, destined to be one of the honours of his reign, and share a duration with posterity of which the phlegmatic sovereign little dreamt, appears to have come back to England in his train. The next year saw a continuation of the \" Constant Couple,\" in a new play entitled \" Sir Harry Wildair,\" in which both Wilks and Mrs. Oldfield performed to admiration ; but, like all sequels, its merits lay chiefly in associations with its precursor. A very small part, however, that of a servant, happening to fall into the handa of Norris, a man of quaint original humour, it fitted him bo happily as to bring him into celebrity, and got its very name affixed to him in the bills of other plays. The same man, however, was, on a future occasion, designated \" Heigh-ho Norris,\" in a play bill, simply because he uttered a couple of lines, containing that exclamation, in a atyle of exquisite"], [63, "FARQUHAR. LIII drollery.* So that it was the actor's humour, quite as much as the author's, that helped the \" Sequel \" to this odd bit of lustre. In 1702 appeared the \"Miscellanies,\" a small collection of letters, poems, and essays, originally called, we believe, \" Love and Business,\" \u2014 (for we have only seen it in the collected works). It has little merit, with the exception of an \" Essay on Comedy,\" and was probably got together under some pressure of pecuniary trouble. Mrs. Oldfield is conjectured to have returned some letters, in order to contribute to it ; and she is said to have taken great pleasure afterwards in perusing both them and the essay. Such passages as it contains, not unworthy of the writer, we have selected at the close of this memoir. One of the best pieces is a portrait of himself, painted with evidences of much candour and modesty, and yet to his advantage ; and we doubt not it was a true one. A man is not obliged to tell falsehoods of himself, in order to obtain a reputation for the very sincerity which such a process must undo. It is enough if, being upon the whole an honest man, he is neither blind to his faults nor sets too great a store by his virtues ; and it is interesting to think how many of these portraits (the fashion for which originated, we believe, in the social egotism of our pleasant neighbours across the Channel) contain manifest proofs of the same candid moderation as Farquhar's. But animal spirits are too often confounded with an overweening self-estimation. People are more often aware of their own defects, than the world give them credit for being. Only in the ignorant it exhibits itself in a jealous irritability. Wiser men alone know how to reconcile the uneasiness of one part of self-knowledge, with the humanities that help to make up for it in the other. The \"Inconstant,\" or \"The Way to win him,\" founded on Fletcher's \"Wild Goose Chase,\" appeared in 1703, but not with as much success as might be supposed from its having kept possession of the stage. It was hurt by the reigning fashion for dancers from the Continent ; and the critics appear to have been greatly divided about its merits ; why, it is no longer very clear. The lovers of the old poetic play resented perhaps the author's free and easy way of almost appropriating it to himself in his prose version. As this is about the time that Farquhar married, we are led to glance round upon his previous life, and to wish to know more of it. Little, however, can be collected, and his letters want dates for what there can. One is sent from the Inner Temple, and some are written from Gray's Inn ; probably from coffee-houses ; though anybody may live in an inn of Court. When he was in Holland, he visited the Brill, Leyden, Rotterdam, and the Hague. On his return we find him at one time in Essex, hare-hunting (not in the style of a proficient) ; at another at Richmond, sick; and at a third, in Shropshire, on a recruiting party, where he was treated with great hospitality, and found the materials for one of the best of his plays. When he was in Holland he appears to have rescued a lady from some villanous design upon her. She was the same with whom he afterwards condoles in one of the letters, upon a suspicious robbery which she said she had undergone. Probably it was the woman he married. At what exact time this marriage took place, whether it was before or after the production of tho \" Inconstant,\" we cannot say ; but the event itself was almost aa dramatic as any in his writings ; though, unfortunately, more tragic in its results. A lady had fallen in love with him, aud knew of no better way to recommend herself as his wife than by pretending to be in possession of a fortune. The grateful and gallant dramatist took the wife without being so unpolite as to secure the fortune ; and though the lady confessed to him that her love had played him a trick, \u2014 or rather perhaps, out of a secret and not unamiable vanity of comfort in the very confession, \u2014 Farquhar not only forgave her, but never breathed to her a syllable of reproach. We shall see too well, before long, how deeply this truly gentlemanly forbearance redounded to his honour. Our author's dramatic productions now keep a remarkable regularity of pace with the dates of the years. The \" Inconstant \" came out, as we have seen, in 1703. 1704 produced the \" Stage-Coach ;\" a poor copy from the French, written in conjunction with Motteux, \u2014 probably on his first awakening from the dream of the lucky marriage. The \"Twin Rivals \" followed in 1705; the \" Recruiting * Davio's Dramatic Miscellanies, vol. iii. p. 310."], [64, "LIV BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. Officer,\" a great advance upon his previous dramas, in the year following ; and the \" Beaux Stratagem,\" his last and best, in 1707. These dates, to be sure, do not correspond throughout with those assigned by the latest authorities to their respective appearances in print ; and in truth it would be difficult, even had we the printed copies before us, to decide upon such matters, unless we possessed thorough information respecting the dates both of representation and publication ; which, perhaps, if deairable, would be impossible, especially considering the confusion created by the unsettled calendar of those days, and the tricks played with it by the booksellers. Be this as it may, it is likely enough that Farquhar would produce a play a year, and with an eye to the payment of annual debts. The wonder indeed is, that he did not write oftener, considering hia wit and poverty ; but he had alao the duties of his regiment to attend to, and his health was not good. It is thought to have declined with the discovery of the deception that had been put upon him, or perhapa we should rather say, with the increase of the anxious tenderness which it caused in him towards a growing family. This anxiety unfortunately subjected him to another deception, which is thought to have occasioned his death. Some patron, filling him with hopes of another kind of preferment, which he represented as certain, tempted him to sell out of the army. The poor dramatist, when the proceeds were spent, found the patron without truth, and himself without a prospect or a penny. He took to his sick chair ; retained enough of the blissful abstraction of genius to write the \" Beaux Stratagem\" in six weeka ; and died during the height of its success, before he had attained his thirtieth year. He is supposed to have been buried in the churchyard of St. Martin's-in-the-Field's. A dying anecdote, full of his usual good-temper and pleasantry, Bhows that he had foreseen his exit. Wilks, during the rehearsal of the play, observing to him that Mrs. Oldfield wished he could have thought of some more legitimate divorce in order to secure the \" honour \" of Mrs. Sullen, \" Oh,\" said Farquhar, \" I will, if she pleases, solve that immediately, by getting a real divorce, marrying her myself, and giving her my bond that she shall be a widow in less than a fortnight.\"\u2014 Poor, nature-loving, cheerful, melancholy Farquhar ! And so, turning away perhaps with the tears in his eyes at the thought of his real wife and his children, he periahed. Well, being the man he was, and giving a great deal of pleaBure to his fellow-creatures, he must upon the whole have had a far happier life of it, than a melancholy. Yet a great sorrow remains to be told. We hardly know whether pleasure or grief predominates, when we read his dying thanks to Wilks in his short preface,\u2014 reminding us of the more exquisite words on the like occasion, addressed to the Conde de Lemos, by the great Cervantes, and prefixed to his romance of \"Persiles and Sigismunda;\" but what are we to think were his feelings, when he wrote the following death-bed letter to Wilks : \u2014 \" Dear Bob, \" I have not anything to leave thee, to perpetuate my memory, but two helpless girls. Look upon them sometimes, and think of him that was, to the last moment of his life, thine. \" George Farquhar.\" This simple brevity, and even the gay familiarity of the address, has something in it affecting beyond the ordinary, and, in some measure, self-repaying solemnity of tragical expressions. And our sorrow is heightened, when we hear one of his biographers telling us, that he had often heard Farquhar say he would rather undergo the most violent death than think of his family wanting needful support. \" But it served him right,\"\u2014 some luckier formalist may exclaim, more comfortable in the vanity of the opinion than in the real feeling of it (for man's heart is generally juster to itself at bottom, as you may know by the uneasy tone in which such opinions are expressed), \" He should not have led such a careless life, nor trusted so foolishly to a patron.\"-Nay, judge him not, thou poor happier, unhappier man ; his larger and livelier sympathies with his fellow-creatures produced works that delight them still, and that blinded him to the probability of his own early fate, till the truth came in agony upon him. Kind Nature makes out her case somehow. He was careless and unlucky and"], [65, "FARQUHAR. LV we profit by it. Thou art careful and luckier, and profitest by it thyself. Let thy children bless thee; as they will, if thou art more charitable in thy speech. Good would it have been for those of poor Farquhar, if others had had as great faith in human kindness as he. It is said in the biographies, that Wilks, who waa a rich man, acted up to the spirit of the compliment paid him. Noble Betterton did, to a compliment exactly similar ; and Betterton was not rich. Wilks's conduct is doubtful. He certainly was not \" hound,\" as the phrase ia, to be generous and romantic, if his nature did not induce him ; but when praise is given him for being so, the rest of the story cannot remain unnoticed. All that is distinctly stated to have been done by Wilks is, that he ultimately procured a benefit for the two daughters, and put them out apprentices to mantua-makers : and yet even in those very biographies, which laud him to the skies for \" having paid the most punctual regard to the request of his dying friend,\" and can find no further proof of it than this benefit and the mantua-making, it is added, that Farquhar's widow \" died in circumstances of the utmost indigence ; \" that \" one of his daughters was married to a low tradesman, and died soon after;\" and that \"the other was living in 1764, in mean and indigent circumatancea, without any knowledge of refinement either in sentiment or expenses ; \" seeming to take \" no pride in-her father's fame,\" and \" in every respect fitted to her humble situation.\" \u2014 This humble situation, we believe, was that of a maid-aervant. Now, it ia certainly possible enough, that the woman who could deceive Farquhar, as his wife had done, might have been of such a lax turn of mind altogether, as to tire out or even disgust assistance, and so be reasonably left to her fate ; \u2014 as far, that is to say, as any human being reasonably can be so. And it is to be observed, that Farquhar, with all his toleration and hia tenderness, does not venture to name her to Wilks in his letter. But how could these children, to any purpose, have been \" aometimes looked upon,\" as the poor dramatist touchingly phrases it, if their education and prospects, as it would seem by the above account, had been totally neglected? Why need the one have married a \" low tradesman ;\" and the other have become a servant, totally destitute of breeding; and taking no pride in her father's fame ? It may be said, that probably they \" took after the mother,\" tired out their benefactor, and could not end otherwise than they did. But in having no proofs, or even distinct assertions, that he did anything more for them than give them a benefit, and \" put them out \" as mantua-makers, how are we to take for granted that he ever did anything else, or even so much ; still less, that he gave them the least taate of what the father must have moat desired, \u2014 something of a decent education, and of the hopes to be founded on it ? Looking at the accounts of Wilks left us by Cibber, Davies, and others, and making due allowance for theatrical jealousies, the impression, we are bound to say, is not favourable to the refinement of his character. He was vehement, jealous, and fond of power ; \u2014 dictatorial himself, and therefore the last man in the world to like whatever he might think dictation in those whom he considered as equals or inferiors Farquhar's very praises of such a man, swelling the amount of adulation too generally bestowed on successful actors, is likely to have done his vanity no good, nor abated the absurd comparisons he would be inclined to make between poor men of genius and a rich performer. In short, we like not his looks in this matter, nor even his supercilious looks in hia portraite ; and before we give him the praise of Betterton, must again call for proofs versus results. It is proper, nevertheless, to state (for under no circumstances, and at no distance of time, are men's characters to he conjectured to their prejudice, in the absence of such testimony as can do them service), that Davies in his \" Dramatic Miscellanies,\" vol. iii. p. 485, speaks of the \" honest and steady character \" of \" Robert Wilks \" in the maintenance of \" everything that was decent, just, and generous.\" Nor is this general impression of a character (if such it was) to be lightly affected by the charges which Davies, on this occasion, is disputing in the teeth of \" two such interested men \" (so he calls them) as Cibber and Dogget, whose great complaint against Wilks was his \" impetuous and overbearing temper.\" On the other hand, we do not well see how this character for the main tenance of everything \" decent, just, and generous,\" is compatible with Davies's own charge against Wilks in another place (p. 256), of his \" depriving the inoffensive Harry Carey of the liberty of the Bcenes, because he had, in common with others, made merry with Cibber in a song, on his being"], [66, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. LVI appointed poet-laureat : saying, at the same time, he (Wilks) was surprised at his impertinence, in behaving so improperly to a man of such great merit ; \" \u2014 that is to say, to a presumptuous brother actor and a ridiculous laureat. Cibber, it is true, had merit, but not greater than the naive author and composer thus impertinently rebuked ; nor was he so good and kind a man. But let us take the bitter taste of these doubts about Wilks out of our mouths, by repeating, from Davies's book, that there is no doubt about the conduct of the great and good actor Betterton. \" The misfortune,\" says he (p. 416), \" which Betterton sustained, by losing the greatest part of his fortune in a venture in the East Indies, is very exactly related in the ' Biographia Britannica.' His behaviour on this memorable occasion reflects honour on the magnanimity of his mind. His taking into his house, and educating at his own expense, the daughters of his ruined friend who had engaged him in the unhappy adventure, places him in a rank with Satyrus the Greek comedian, whose generosity to the captive daughters of his dead host I have related in my observations on the second act of ' Hamlet.' The daughter of Betterton's unhappy friend was married to Mr. Bowman, whom I have often had occasion to mention. She was admired as a very fine woman, and a pleasing actor.\" Let the reader observe, tliat Davies, with all his regard for Wilks, never thinks on this occasion of bringing up his behaviour to the daughters of Farquhar ; not even though the book which he corroborates respecting Betterton's conduct, the Biographia Britannica, is erne of those in which it is related. Does not this go to prove that he, Davies, himself an actor, and conversant with stage history, had no belief in that proof of Wilks's virtues?* In the memoirs of the life of Wilks, quoted in the \" Biographia Britannica,\" a pension of twenty pounda a year is said to have been procured for the daughters of Farquhar by the \" worthy friend and patron to whom he dedicated his Miscellanies, Edmund Chaloner, Esq.\" But nothing certain seems known, except their ultimate poverty. Farquhar, according to his own modest account of himself, had little exterior resemblance to the confident, airy gallants which he is supposed to have painted after his likeness. He says, he had something in hia manners which gave strangers a worse opinion of him than he deserved. With all his animal spirits, he was subject to melancholy ; and though greatly inclined to gallantry, was so cautious of giving way to it as to surprise the sex with his apparent inattention. Like a proper \" captain,\" however, he professed not to be able to answer for his constancy. His appearance (if we may judge from the portrait of him in one of the editions) was sickly, with a care-worn face ; and he generally dressed in black. He was an agreeable singer. His studies he appears to have pursued with temperate regularity, devoting to them three hours a day. He was not capricious nor ill-tempered ; hated to give pain ; was easily deceived, but not a second time ; had \" many acquaintances, very few intimates, and no friend in the old romantic way,\" (that is to say, one to whom a man is enthusiastically devoted,) \" and the greatest proof of my affection that a lady must expect,\" he says, \" is this : \u2014 I would run any hazard to make us both happy, but would not, for any transitory pleasure, make either of us miserable.\" * The case of Satyrus, the Greek player, is so much to the purpose, and so beautiful in itself, that the reader will be glad to see it quoted. It is contained in a passage of Demosthenes, of which Davies has given a version, apparently his own ; and was as follows :\u2014 \" When Philip of Macedon had taken the city of Olynthus, he celebrated the Olympic Games. He invited to the festival all the professors of the fine arts. He entertained them with the choicest banquets, and bestowed crowns upon the victors. During the height of the festival, heaaked Satyrus the comedian why, of all his guests, he alone had asked for no gift, nor desired any mark of his favour. Did he suppose him to be of a mean and sordid disposition? or did he conceive that he had entertained any ill-will towards him?\u2014 Satyrus modestly re. lied, that he stood in no need of those acts of munificence which others demanded. What he should request of the king, could with the greatest facility be granted: but he had some fears lest his petition should be rejected. I hilip encouraged him to urge his demand ; and with a facetious gaiety, assured him that he should refuse nothing he should ask. Satyrus then informed the king, that his old acquaintance and host, Apollophanes of Pydna, having been slam through treachery, his relations, terrified at the accident, had for safety conveyed his two daughters to Olynthus; butas that city had now become subjected to his m .jesty's laws, they were in the condition of prisoners and captives Now, the sole boon I shall beg of you, continued the player, is, that you would give orders for their deliverance into my hands: not for the sake of gaining any advantage to myself, but that I may bestow on them portions equal to their birth and education, and prevent their falling into any hardship or disgrace unworthy of me or their father. -The whole assembly upon hearing this generous request of Satjrus, broke out into loud' and tumultuous applause ; and Philip, with a good grace, immediately complied with his wishes.\"-_T\u00abm Miscellanies vol . vn. p. 56. The article on Farquhar in the Biographia Britannica was written by Oldys."], [67, "FARQUHAR. LVII In short, our author was a good-natured, sensitive, reflecting man, of so high an order of what may he called the town class of genius, as to sympathise with mankind at large upon the strength of what he saw of them in little, and to extract from a quintessence of good sense an inspiration just short of the romantic and imaginative ; that is to say, he could turn what he had experienced in common life to the best account, but required in all cases the support of its ordinary associations, and could not project his spirit beyond them. He felt the little world too much, and the universal too little. He saw into all false pretensions, but not into all true ones ; and if he had had a larger sphere of nature to fall back upon in his adversity, would probably not have died of it. The wings of his fancy were too common, and grown in too artificial an air, to support him in the sudden gulfs and great aching voids of that new region, and enable him to beat hia way to their green islands. His genius was so entirely social, that notwithstanding what appeared to the contrary in his personal manners, and what he took for his own superiority to it, it compelled him to assume in his writings all the airs of the most received town ascendancy ; and when it had once warmed itself in this way, it would seem that it had attained the healthiness natural to its best condition, and could have gone on for ever, increasing both in enjoyment and power, had external circumstances been favourable. He was becoming gayer and gayer, when death, in the shape of a sore anxiety, called him away, as if from a pleasant party, and left the house ringing with hia jest. In looking critically at Farquhar's plays in succession, nothing need be added to what has been said respecting the earliest one, \" Love in a Bottle,\" except that much of the talk is gratuitous, and that in this play, perhaps more than in any of the re3t, is to be seen the \"pert low dialogue\" which Pope accused him of writing ; that is to say, brisk only, with a pretence of something better, and on that account wanting in an air of good breeding. Nor is Sir Harry Wildair without it in the \"Constant Couple,\" nor even A rclier in his last play, the \"Beaux-Stratagem.\" It was probably owing to the conflict between the author's habits of personal reserve, and his sympathy in spirit with all that was the reverse.*- Goldsmith, who was a very diffident man, carried the same error into his Young Marlow in \" She Stoops to Conquer ;\" or rather he would have carried it, had not the very intensity of his consciousness of the danger ingeniously converted it into a part of his comic intention. And Marlow, who in one of his situations is a copy of Arclier, is, after all, really pert, and gives himself airs to the supposed chambermaid, beyond what a thorough-bred gentleman would have done. Sir Harry Wildair, nevertheless, as Steele said, is very entertaining in spite of what that good-natured critic himself thought \"low;\" and the part will always interest, as a kind of epitome of youthful spirits and freedom from care, let loose upon the world. The plot of the play is as lively as the character, and, like most of Farquhar's plots, is the author's own ; and, considering the manners of the times, almost everything is natural in it, with the exception of the outrageously farcical notion of the swimming-girdle, which was to carry Clincher to Civita Vecchia, Farquhar, who had been so modest in his preface to the \" Constant Couple \" as to describe himself \" below the envy of great wits and above the malice of little ones,\" had either got so warmed into a better opinion of himself by the time he wrote the \" Inconstant,\" or perhaps was really so unaware of the superiority of a great poetical genius, as to brand those who accused him of spoiling Fletcher's \" Wild-goose Chace \" with wishing them no other injury than that they \" would say it again !\" Spoiling, it certainly could not be called ; any more than it could be called spoiling an eagle's wing to pluck a feather from it, and turn it into a toy. But the wording of the taunt implies something contemptuous of a reverence towards the eagle ; and this betrays a blindness to the height to which the eagle soared. Farquhar's \" Inconstant \" is a pleasant play (as far as the chief characters as well as the plot are pleasant ; which we cannot, we own, very well think they are, either in the copy or the original) ; hut compared with the \" Wild-goose Chace,\" it is not a whit livelier, nor indeed so lively, nor has it anything of the other's robust and masterly expression or imagination. It is, in truth, with the exception of the highly interesting adventure that is taken from the history of a French gentleman, neither more nor less than Fletcher's play with all the poetry taken out of it ; \u2014 the age of the demi-gods of Elizabeth, brought down to the standard of the sprightly parade officers of the times of Captains Vanbrugh and Farquhar. We are not to e"], [68, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. lviii suppose that Apollo could have been less of a \"gay fellow about town,\" if he chose it, than the wittiest gallant that stuck a bay-leaf in his peruke : only, without question, (if that be \" spoiling,\") his language would have had ten ideas in it to the other's one. The \" Twin Rivals \" was an attempt to write a comedy in a fit of critical instead of playful inspiration. Critics have spoken well of it accordingly, and thought it the completest of his productions ; but the town did not like it, nor did the author repeat the experiment. Collier, it seems by Farquhar's own account, had piqued him into an endeavour to show how moral and profoundly satirical he could be. It is the story of a Hunchback, (very different from Mr. Knowles's,) who in a most impudent manner, as a retaliation upon fortune, tries to deprive his elder brother of a title and estate. Upon looking through it again, while writing this paragraph, we find we have not marked in it a dozen lines. In the \" Recruiting Officer \" Farquhar took his revenge. He threw himself entirely upon his animal spirits, and produced accordingly one of his very best plays. In everything connected with it he was fortunate ; for he went only upon grounds of truth and observation, and his own impulses. The humours were drawn from what he had seen while he was on the recruiting party to which we have alluded ; his hospitable friends \" round the Wrekin,\" to whom it was dedicated, furnished some of the characters ; the play was written on the spot ; his Colonel and his General liked it (Lord Orrery and the Duke of Ormond) ; the principal dramatis person\u00e6 were represented by the best reigning performers (Wilks, Cibber, Estcourt, and Mrs. Oldfield) ; and it gained that kind of success from which the author might have foreseen that it would retain possession of the stage. It has been stated by Nichols, on the authority of an old lady who remembered Farquhar and his recruiting party, that Justice Balance was Mr. Berkeley, at that time Warden of Shrewsbury ; that another of the Justices was a Mr. Hill, of that city ; Worthy, a Mr. Owen, of Russason ; Alelinda, a Miss Harnage, of Balsadine ; and Sylvia, the Recorder's daughter. Plume was, of course, pro nounced to be \"himself;\" but if the play, as it is asserted, and is probable, was written within a year of the \" Beaux-Stratagem,\" the gay Captain could only have been the imaginary Farquhar ; \u2014 gay enough, we doubt not, while so imagining, but in his own person, an anxious married man. Steele, who had a grudge against Farquhar, because he thought him wanting in sentiment, attributed the \" support \" of the play to the admirable performance of his friend Estcourt. \" There is not,\" he says, \"in my humble opinion, the humour hit in Serjeant Kite; but it is admirably supplied by his action.\" Succeeding times have not accorded with this criticism. Every character in the piece, of any prominence, is thought to be a genuine transcript from nature ; and there is a charm of gaiety and good-humour throughout it, that enables us to put the best and least tragical construction upon certain anti-sentimentalities, which Steele perhaps was too much out of his customary good-humour to choose to consider in any light but one. We seem to breathe the clear, fresh, ruddy-making air of a remote country town, neighboured by hospitable elegances. The sturdy male peasants will find their legs in life somehow, as the Serjeant has done ; and the females will be taken more care of by the Captain himself, and by the good-natured Sylvia too, than the censor at first sight might suppose. The morals are not the beat, we allow; and in the matter of lying (which alwaya givea us a pang), they might be infinitely improved, as we doubt not they will, though not from the austerest quarters. When the best morals arrive, everybody will be as happily taken care of as the \" ladies \" themselves ; \u2014 not the case certainly at present, nor provided for even by the prospective ethics of dear, excellent Richard Steele. The sprightly success of the \" Recruiting Officer \" had probably the happiest effect upon the composition of our author's best and most successful production, the \" Beaux-Stratagem ;\" an excellent play, which, like the one just mentioned, and the \"Inconstant,\" is always acted whenever actors can be found. Its plot is new, simple, and interesting ; the characters various, without confusing it ; the dialogue sprightly and characteristic ; the moral bold, healthy, admirable, and doubly needed in those times, when sottishness was a fashion. Archer and Aimwell, who set out as mere intriguers, prove in the end true gentlemen, candid, conscientious, and generous.

Sullen is the more touching in her distress, from the cheerfulness with which she wipes away her tears. Sullen is an awful brute, yet not thoroughly inhuman ; for he feels, aster all, that he has no right to such a wife. The only fault in the termination, is what Mrs. Oldfield objected to, \u2014 that the law had provided no sanction for it ; so that it became but a higher kind of sale by halter. But what a lesson did not this very want imply ? The footsteps of the gravest ultimate reforms are often found in places where they are least looked for. But Nature speaks there, and there they come. Farquhar's Irishmen have been thought not to be truly Irish, especially in regard to the brogue. We cannot speak to this ; but if the objection is well founded with respect to the people in general, might it not be otherwise removable, upon the ground that he drew his Irish from the northern or semi-Scottish part of the country ? We conclude this division of our task with some passages from Farquhar's \" Letters,\" and from the sensible \" Essay on Comedy.\" The poems are not worthy of his reputation. His best prologues and epilogues were written by impudent Joe Haines, and a Frenchman \u2014 Motteux \u2014 remarkable for his mastery of our idiom, and for being the best English translator of \" Don Quixote.\" Farquhar is understood to have left no manuscripts. We could not find any in the British Museum ; and a few hours before he died he is said to have thrown what he had into the fire, observing that he had \" no remains worth saving.\" There is a printed poem, however, which we have never seen, and which we sought for in vain at the library of the Museum, both in the catalogue, and by inquiring of the courteous gentlemen there, who did all they could to assist us. It is called \" Barcelona,\" and was written upon the capture of that city by the great preux chevalier, the Earl of Peterborough. In the \" Biographia Britannica \" is the prose dedication of it to him, written with considerable vigour and elegance, and signed \" Margaret Farquhar,\" \u2014 his widow. If really her composition, she must have been a woman of no ordinary understanding. a dutch skipper. A jolly skipper at the stern of his bsrge, with a furred cap like rays about his head, the helm in his hand, and his pipe in his mouth, with Liberty seated in one whisker, and Property in t'other. GENEROUS COMMERCIAL POLICY. One day upon the Exchange at Rotterdam, I casually met a gentleman, who some time ago lived one of the most considerable merchants in Ireland, and about some four years since, by great losses at sea, was forced to fly his country in a very mean condition. I put him in mind of his misfortunes by a favour he once conferred upon me of a bottle of claret and a neat's tongue, at launching of a new ship that he had built in Dublin ; which vessel (bottom and goods all his own) was unfortunately lost the very first voyage. The gentleman seemed very sensible of his misfortunes, but withal told me, that he still had a glass of wine and a tongue at my service, if I would come and see him at his house that evening. I made him a visit, and found, to my no small surprise, a handsome house, neatly furnished, excellent meat, and as good burgundy as ever joyed the heart of man. I took the freedom to ask my merchant, how a bankrupt should come by all this; in answer to which he gave me the following account of his affairs. \" The Dutch, sir,\" said he, \" have a law, that whatever merchant in any part of Europe, who has had any considerable traffic with this country, whose honesty is apparent by his former accounts, and can prove by sufficient testimony, that his losses and misfortunes are not chargeable upon his ignorance nor extrava gance, but purely those of unfortunate chance, above the reach of human prevention ; that then such a merchant may repair to them, have the freedom of any sea-port in the state, have a supply of whatever money be 's willing to take up out of the publio revenue, upon the bare security of his industry and integrity ; and all this upon the current interest, which is seldom above four per cent. \" Pursuant to this,\" continued the gentleman, \" my qualifications for this credit being sufficiently testified, I took up here two thousand pounds sterling, and in two years have gained fifty per cent.

LX duvden's funeral. I come now from Mr. Drydcn's funeral, where we had an Ode in Horace sung, instead of David's Psalms; whence you may find, that we don't think a poet worth Christian burial. The pomp of the ceremony was a kind of rhapsody, and fitter I think for Hudi bras than him, because the cavalcade was mostly burlesque; but he was an extraordinary man, and buried after an extraordinary fashion ; for I do believe there was never such another burial seen. The oration indeed was great and ingenious, worthy the subject, and like the author, whose prescriptions can restore the living, and his pen embalm the dead.* And so much for Mr. Dryden, whose burial was the same with his life : variety and not of a piece ; the quality and mob, farce and heroics ; the sublime and ridicule mixt in a piece ; great Cleopatra in a hackney-coach. RATIO OF DEMAND FOR LONG SERMONS. I have observed in my little travels, that a sermon of three quarters of an hour that might please the congregation at St. James's, would never satisfy the meeting-house in the city, where people expect more for their money ; and having more temptations of roguery, must have a larger portion of instruction. LAWFUL FREEDOM OF THE DRAMA FROM \"CLASSIC RULES.\" The rules of English comedy don't lie in the compass of Aristotle, or his followers, but in the pit, box, and galleries. And to examine into the humour of an English audience, let us see by what means our own English poets have succeeded in this point. To determine a suit at law we don't look into the archives of Greece or Rome, but inspect the reports of our lawyers, and the acts and statutes of our Parliaments; aud by the same rule we have nothing to do with the models of Menander or Plautus, but must consult Shakspeare, Jonson, Fletcher, and others, who by methods much different from the ancients have supported the English stage, and made themselves famous to posterity. We shall find that these gentlemen have fairly dispensed with the greatest part of critical formalities ; the decorums of time and place, so much cried up of late, had no force of decorum with them ; the economy of their plays was ad libitum, and the extent of their plots only limited by the convenience of action. I would willingly understand the regularities of Hamlet, Macbeth, Henry the Fourth, and of Fletcher's Plays; and yet these have long been the darlings of the English audience, and are like to continue with the same applause, in defiance of all the criticisms that ever were published in Greek and Latin. ****** A play may be written with all the exactness imaginable, in respect of unity in time and place ; but if you inquire its character of any persons, though of the meanest understanding of the whole audience, he will tell you it is intolerable stuff; and upon your demanding his reasons, his answer is, I don't like it: his humour is the only rule that he can judge a comedy by, but you find that mere nature is offended with some irregularities ; and though he be not so learned in the drama, to give you an inventory of the faults, yet I can tell you, that one part of the plot bad no dependence upon another, which made this simple man drop his attention and concern for the event; and so disengaging his thoughts from the business of the action, he sat there very uneasy, thought the time very tedious, because he had nothing to do. The characters were so incoherent in themselves, and composed of such variety of absurdities, that in his knowledge of nature, he could find no original for such a copy ; and being therefore unacquainted with any folly they reproved, or any virtue that they recommended, their business was as flat and tiresome to him, as if the actors had talked Arabic. ****** I am as little a friend to certain rambling plays as anybody, nor have I ever espoused their party by my own practice; yet I could not forbear saying something in vindication of the great Shakspeare, whom every little fellow that can form an aoristus primus will presume to condemn for indecorums and absurdities ; sparks that are so spruce upon their Greek and Latin, that, like our fops in travels, they can relish nothing but what is foreign, to let the world know they have been abroad forsooth ! But it must be so, because Aristotle said it ! Now I say it must be otherwise, because Shakspeare said it ; and I am sure that Shakspeare was the greater poet of the two. But you will say that Aristotle was the greater critic. That 's a mistake, \u00bb Garth."], [71, "FARQUHAR. LXI sir ; for criticism in poetry is no more than judgment in poetry ; which you will find in your Lexicon. Now, if Shakspeare was the better poet, he must have the most judgment in his art ; for everybody knows that judgment is an essential part of poetry, and without it no writer is worth a farthing. FARQUHAR'S PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF. To a Lady. In pursuance to your order, madam, I have sent you, here inclosed, my picture; and I challenge Vandyke or Kneller to draw more to the life. You are the first person that ever had it ; and if I had not some thoughts that the substance would fall to your share, I would not part with my likeness. I hope the colours will never fade, though you may give me some hints where to mend the features, having so much power to correct the life. THE PICTURE. My outside is neither better nor worse than my Creator made it, and the piece being drawn by so great au artist, 'twere presumption to say there were many strokes amiss. I have a body qualified to answer all the ends of its creation, and that 's sufficient. As to the mind, which in most men wears as many changes as their body, so in me 'tis generally drest like my person, in black. Melancholy is its every day apparel ; and it has hitherto found few holidays to make it change its clothes. In short, my constitution is very splenetic, and yet very amorous ; both which I endeavour to hide lest the former should offend others, and that the latter might incommode myself. And my reason is so vigilant in restraining these two failings, that I am taken for an easy natured man with my own sex, and an ill-natured clown by yours. 'Tis true, I am very sparing in my praises and compliments to a lady, out of a fear that they may affect myself more than her. For the idols that we worship are generally of our own making ; and though at first meu may not speak what they think, yet truth may catch them on t' other hand, and make them think what they speak. But most of all am I cautious of promising, especially upon the weighty article of constancy ; because, in the first place, I have never tried the strength of it in my own experience ; and, secondly, I suppose a man can no more engage for his constancy than for his health, since I believe they both equally depend upon a certain constitution of body ; and how far and how frequently that may be liable to alteration, especially iu affairs of love, let the more judicious determine. But so far a man may promise, that if he find not his passion grounded on a false foundation, and that he have a continuance of the same sincerity, truth and love to engage him ; that then his reason, bis honour, and his gratitude, may prove too strong for all changes of temper and inclination. I am a very great Epicure ; for which reason I hate all pleasure that 's purchased by excess of pain. I am quite different from the opinion of men that value what 's dearly bought ; long expectation makes the blessing always less to me ; for by often thinking of the future joy, I make the idea of it familiar to me, and so I lose the great transport of surprise ; 'tis keeping the springs of desire so long upon the rack, till at last they grow loose and enervate : besides, any one of a creative fancy, by a duration of thoughts, will be apt to frame too great an idea of the object, and so make the greater part of bis hopes end in a disappointment. I am seldom troubled with what the world calls airs and caprices ; and I think it an idiot's excuse for a foolish action, to say 'twas my humour. I bate all little malicious tricks of vexing people, for trifles, or teasing them with frightful stories, malicious lies, stealing lap-dogs, tearing fans, breaking china, or the like : I can't relish the jest that vexes another in earnest. In short, if ever I do a wilful injury, it must be a very great one. I am often melancholy, but seldom angry ; for which reason I can be severe in my resentment, without injuring myself. I think it the worst office to my nature to make myself uneasy for what another should be punished. I am easily deceived, but then I never fail at last to find out the cheat ; my love of pleasure and sedatencss makes me very secure, and the same reason makes me very diligent when I am alarmed. I have so natural a propensity to ease, that I cannot cheerfully fix to any study, which bears not a pleasure in the application ; which makes me inclinable to poetry above anything else. I have very little estate, but what lies under the circumference of my hat ; and should I by mischance come to lose my head, I should not be worth a groat ; but I ought to thank Providence that I can by three"], [72, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. LXII hours' study live one-and-twenty with satisfaction to myself, and contribute to the maintenance of more families than some who have thousands a year. I have something in my outward behaviour, which gives strangers a worse opinion of mo than I deserve ; but I am more than recompensed by the opinion of my acquaintance, which is as much above my desert. I have manv acquaintance, very few intimates, but no friend ; I mean, in the old romantic way. I have no secret so weighty, but what I can bear in my own breast ; nor any duels to fight, but what I may engage in without a second ; nor can I love after the old romantic discipline. I would have my passion, if not led, vet at least waited on by my reason ; and the greatest proof of my affection that a lady must expect, is this : I would run any hazard to make us both happy, but would not for any transitory pleasure make either of us miserable. Of the four dramatists of whom we have thus endeavoured to give some account, it appears to us that Wycherley was the most reflective for reflection's sake, the most terse with simplicity in his style, the most original in departing from the comedy in vogue, and adding morals to manners, and the least so with regard to plot and character : that Congreve was the wittiest, most scholarly, most highly bred, the most elaborate in his plots and language, and most pungent but least natural in his characters, and that he had the least heart : that Vanbrugh was the readiest and most straight forward, the least superfluous, the least self-referential, mistrusting, or morbid, and therefore, with more pardon, the least scrupulous, \u2014 caring for nothing hut truth (as far as he saw it) and a strong effect : and that Farquhar had the highest animal spirits, with fits of the deepest sympathy, the greatest wish to please rather than to strike, the most agreeable diversity of character, the best instinct in avoiding revolting extravagances of the time, and the happiest invention in plot and situation ; and, therefore, is to be pronounced, upon the whole, the truest dramatic genius, and the most likely to be of lasting popularity ; as indeed he has hitherto been. He has far surpassed them all, we believe, in the number of editions ; and is certainly ten times acted to their once. The \" Confederacy \" upon the strength of Brast, and Dick Amwell and his mother, is the only play of Vanbrugh's that can compete, unaltered, with the quadruple duration of the \" Constant Couple,\" the \" Inconstant,\" the \" Recruiting Officer,\" and the \" Beaux-Stratagem.\" His \" Relapse \" required to be turned into the \" Trip to Scarborough,\" before his exquisite Lord Foppington could again be received into decent company. Astrology helps to pull down Congreve's \" Old Bachelor,\" and tragic venom and monstrous vices his \" Double Dealer.\" The \" Way of the World \" is an admirable comedy, it must be confessed, especially for the sovereign airs and graces of Millamant ; yet it is tiresome in its very ingenuity, for its maze of wit and intrigue ; and it has no heart, therefore wants the very soul of pleasure. There is a bit of heart in \" Love for Love,\" and nature in Miss Prue ; and Mesdames Frail and Foresight are exquisite. The Sailor also, as Johnson says, \" if not very natural, is very amusing;\" and in truth he is more natural than he has been thought, except in being the son of a man of fortune. Accordingly, \" Love for Love \" is the only one of Congreve's plays that can be called popular. Wycherley's \" Country Wife \" (the \" Country Girl \" of Garrick) will he immortal in some shape or other, but cannot re-appear as herself, or at least not in her former company ; and even as herself she came from Moliere. The \" Constant Couple,\" \" Recruiting Officer,\" and \" Beaux- Stratagem,\" are, in every respect, all Farquhar's own. But all the works of these dramatists are still read, though they are not all acted ; and that they are no longer all acted is not to be wholly attributed either to their vices or to our virtues. Manners alone make some difference. Conventional pleasantries go out and cease to be understood : conventional virtues also change, and are not always converted into others more real. We are not of necessity the better or more moral for thinking the worst we can of freer modes of speech, or even of conduct. Our ancestors may not have been so bad as we Buppose them, even upon our own principles. Animal spirits often say more than they mean ; and in that case it is our dulness and want of spirits that misconstrues the speakers. Vanity pretends to more than it performs ; and so does our own when it affects an extreme the other way. The balance is not always settled in our favour merely by our looking grave on the matter, and showing that our virtue makes us neither merry nor charitable."], [73, "FARQUHAR. lxiii Again, the drama is not a mere copy of nature,\u2014 not a sac-simile. It is the free running hand of genius, under the impression of its liveliest wit or most passionate impulses, a thousand times adorning or feeling all as it goes ; and you must read it, as the healthy instinct of audiences almost always does if the critics will let them alone, \u2014 with a grain of allowance,\u2014 and a tendency to go away with as much of it for use as is necessary, and the rest for the luxury of laughter, pity, or poetical admiration. Farquhar's as well as Congreve's rakes, sometimes talk cruelly ; but it is either towards imposture and trickery, or in the mere sting of the gusto of the will. They mean it to the letter as little as anybody ; and we have seen that Farquhar himself died of anxiety for his family. There may have been a vanity in it, in his first productions ; and very painful and startling it always sounds ; but the very love of pleasure, in a heart like his, ended in making him humane, giving him a strong sense of the right of pleasure in others ; and it was doubtless out of a sense of the desire and feasibility of this for all the world, and a suspicion of the world's paining itself overmuch and not wisely, that he talked on some subjects as carelessly as he did, and not out of any indifference to the happiness and real virtues of mankind. Read him, and his still freer spoken brethren, in the liberal spirit of that understanding, and you are safe in proportion to the goodness and cheerfulness of your own heart. If you feel neither generous nor blithe in the perusal, neither moved to correct the letter of the worst passages by the spirit of the best, nor to feel that the whole has some healthy end beyoDd itself, thus mistrusting the final purposes and good-nature of Nature herself, as they operate through the medium of a lively art, you may certainly need restraints which these holiday-going dramatists are as certainly not in a condition to supply. And lucky will you be if you get them in mirth-denouncing quarters, without their depriving you of the charity which such writers do not deny to anybody, and thus subjecting you to those hard and melancholy views of the world itself, which are the worst results of conduct the most vicious. Every book, it is true, even the noblest, is not a child's book, nor a guide to ordinary conduct ; but a mind, candidly and healthily trained, may be suffered to grow up in almost any library ; and you may put premature fears in it far worse than none. Nature approves of what is gradual, and loves a decent investment ; but she is not fond of mutilated editions. On the other hand, we are not to suppose that such a world as that of the very best of these dramatists is the best sort of world, or the cheerfullest, and the one to be most desired ; much less such a suffocating region of fine heartless ladies and gentlemen as that of Congreve, who, in his passion for wit and a plot, thought of nothing but intrigue and lying, and saying two contrary things at once. It wanted all the poetry of the drama of the preceding ages, and had no fixed belief in any of the philosophy of the future ; though the good nature of the better part of it was a kind of substitute for both. The best as well as worst of its women, for instance, are only fit to laugh and to perish. Perpetuity disowns them as thorough capable human creatures, such as Desdemona and Imogen, \u2014 ready-made for being finally beautiful and moral, under the best conceivable dispensation : and yet the Sylvia and Airs. Sullen of Farquhar have links with even women like these, by the force of their sympathy with whatsoever is kind and just; and Wycherley's Fidelia is an imitation of them. But who that is anything but half a man, ignorant of what such whole books as Shak speare's can make him, would think of taking to his heart the flimsy creatures, made of ribands and tittle-tattle, out of the rest of the volume before us ? or the hoydens, that come driving out of the pantry, and running down the butler? Wycherley was obliged to go to the former times for his new edition of Viola ; and so was Farquhar for his Oriana. And it is not a little curious to see, up to the days of sentimental comedy, what an uncouth tendency there was, whenever a little romance and good faith was to be introduced, to stilt up the dialogue into verse or measured prose ; as though the moment the writers came to anything serious, their own style was felt to be nought, and that of their predecessors the only worthy language of truth and beauty. Vanbrugh himself begins in verse : but is soon obliged to give it up. In fact, English comedy, as it is emphatically understood to he such in these prose dramatists, is the poorer half of the comedy of the preceding age ; or the levity and satire of it, deprived of its poetry. Farquhar's \" Inconstant,\" inasmuch as it is a de-poetization of Fletcher's \" Wild-goose Chaco,\" is a type of the whole series. It is a mistake however to suppose"], [74, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. LXIV that its licence began with the prose-writers. Licence in abundance, far worse than the worst of theirs, was in the prosaical part of the spirit of the poets of the time of James the First, \u2014 himself one of the most licentious of pirosers; it was already pulling down their genius from the beautiful, believing heights of Shakspeare ; and worthy of reflection is another fact, that it was the prosaical excess of the Puritans in denying to whatsoever they thought wrong the least share of beauty and virtue and the least right of gladness of heart, that helped to undo every species of belief in the identity of the terms, and when reaction came, render it thoroughly dissolute and misbelieving. Puritanism, the best part of which did as much and as lasting good as the worst part did fugitive evil, was preceded (be it observed), as well as followed, by debauchery. Cromwell came between James the First and Charles the Second. The good part of Puritanism reformed the debauchery, but the bad part reproduced it ; and if Etherege and Wycherley, by dint of the very levity and gay heartedness that made them comic writers, had not been better men than the gloomiest of their revilers, a truly infernal business they would have made of the new reaction, \u2014 nothing but malignant satire, and a denial of those rights of mirth and laughter, which God has created as well as tears. This was the mistake of Collier, the non-juring clergyman who came forward to denounce the \" wickedness \" of the drama. We mean, he assumed that the writers were so many knaves and fiends, who had positively malignant intentions ; and in so doing, he was not aware that he betrayed a vice in his own spirit, which if they had thought as ill of it as he did of their licence, would have warranted them in denouncing him as the far greater devil of the two. For to believe in such unmitigated wickedness at all, is itself the worst part of the result of vice ; namely, a moral melancholy, and an attribution to the Creator of having made what he never did. It is not necessary at this time of day to enter into the details of this once famous controversy. Collier was a clever, sincere, and vehement but half-witted man, who did good to the stage, inasmuch as he forced the writers to think of decorum ; but he quite overdid his charges on the score both of intention and commission ; and he would have fallen flat in his own fury, if the very weapons of his opponents had not sustained him. Farquhar saw this in his youth, and noticed it in his first publication, \u2014 the \" Adventures of Covent Garden ; \" \u2014 unless, indeed, his remarks are a report of what was actually said at the club he speaks of. \" Peregrine \" (that is himself, whom he elsewhere designates a \" stranger,\") \" goes next evening to the play ; where meeting some of his ingenious acquaintance, viz., Mr. W , Mr. H , Mr. M , with others of that club, (perhaps Wycherley, Hopkins, and Moyle,) there arose a discourse concerning the battle between the church and the stage, with relation to the champions that maintained the parties. The result upon the matter was this, \u2014 that Mr. Collier showed too much malice and rancour for a churchman, and his adversaries too little wit for the character of poets;\u2014 that their faults transversed would show much better, dulness being familiar with those of Mr. Collier's functions, as malice and ill-nature is more adapted to the profession of wit ; \u2014 that the best way of answering Mr. Collier, was not to have replied at all ; for there was so much fire in his book, had not his adversaries thrown in fuel, it would have fed upon itself, and so gone out in a blaze. As to his respondents, that Captain Va (Vanbrugh) wrote too like a gentleman to be esteemed a good casuist; that Mr. C 's (Congreve's) passion in the business had blinded his reason, which had shone so fair in his other writings ; (and) that Mr. Settle wanted the wit of Captain Va as much as he did Mr. Settle's gravity.\" \u2014 P. 29. Vanbrugh said well of Collier, that he made \" debauches in his piety, as other men did in their drink.\" On the other hand, conceive the horror of Collier at seeing Vanbrugh saying in print, that he was really not aware of the indecencies imputed to him, and that he could very well fancy a virtuous woman laying his plays by the side of her Bible. It is difficult to believe that there was not something of the Captain's impudence in this; and yet Bishop Earle, in some verses on the death of Beaumont, compliments him and Fletcher on their total freedom from indecency !\u2014 The fact was, that \" indecency \" in those times meant nothing but the plainest kind of speech ; and so common v, 'as the habit of it, from the sovereign downwards, that it is one of the proofs of the beautifying effect of poetry on the minds of Beaumont and Fletcher, that they abstained from lavishing this species of"], [75, "FARQUHAR. LXV intensity upon the public. Collier did not suspect that one profession might have its privileged \" indecencies \" as well as another, and that a clergyman of those times might be solemnly and furiously vicious, \u2014 indecent for want of the decorums of charity, and \" wicked\" for want of charity itself. Yet we have now lived to see, that if the stage at that time was one half licentious, in the other half it was not only innocent of all evil intention, but had a sort of piety in the very gaiety of its trust in nature ; while Jeremy Collier, if he was one half of him pious and well-intentioned, was in the other half little better than a violent fool. And the case will be similar in future times with regard to the present. They will think us perhaps more honest in some things than we suppose we are ; but most certainly they will attribute vices, or at least barbarous follies, to us in others, of which we have no conception. There is an instinct in all ages, very natural and pardonable, of thinking the best of existing manners ; a con. sciousness that times and circumstances and the natural progress of events have to do with them, quite as much as ourselves ; and that it is not the most pragmatical denouncers, but the most charitable philosophers, that are likeliest to be in the right as to the best way of improving them. A whole age has, at least, as much right to think good-naturedly of itself as a single bigot. It is a phase and variety of social nature ; and to think the worst of it, even on that score, is not paying the greatest possible compliment to the Providence whose cause the bigot impudently takes upon him to advocate with fire and fury, out of the abundance of his bile and vanity. Future ages will be astonished at the \" profligacy \" of some of our customs, which a theatrical audience not only tolerates, but respects. Yes ; and by the same token, many things are done this moment, and thought very little of nay, reckoned creditable to the wit, and knowledge, and conventional respectability of the doers, \u2014 which two hundred years hence will be thought as immoral and ridiculous as we now think the immoralities and absurdities of the days of Charles the Second. And if these or some of them do not immediately present themselves to every intelligent reader's mind, it only shows how far we are gone in them, and how we are blinded in their gulf ; \u2014 fortunate still if we do but know this, \u2014 that times will improve after us, as well as those that have gone before us ; and that those will see their own way through error best and cheerfullest, who think the best and kindest of whatsoever nature has done. The two best sermons we ever heard (and no disparagement either to many a good one from the pulpit), were a sentence of Dr. Whichcote's against the multiplication of things forbidden, and the honest, heart-and-soul laugh of Dorothy Jordan. Upon the spirit in which these dramatists ought to be read, Mr. Lamb has written an essay, exquisite, like all his essays, for the abundance of the thoughts, the unsuperfluousness of the words, and the subtlety of their expression. We venture to differ with one or two points, and shall state why ; but it is all so much to the purpose of the present volume, as well as so beautiful in itself, that we shall first transfer the whole of it to our pages, at the expense of their less relishing contents. ON THE ARTIFICIAL COMEDY OF THE LAST CENTURY. The artificial Comedy, or Comedy of manners, is quite extinct on our stage. Congreve and Farquhar show their heads once in seven years only, to be exploded and put down instantly. The times cannot bear them. Is it for a few wild speeches, an occasional licence of dialogue ? I think not altogether. The business of their dramatic characters will not stand the moral test. We screw everything up to that. Idle gallantry in a fiction, a dream, the passing pageant of an evening, startles us in the same way as the alarming indications ot profligacy in a son or ward in real life should startle a parent or guardian. We have no such middle emotions as dramatic interests left. We see a stage libertine playing his loose pranks of two hours' duration, and of no after consequence, with the severe eyes which inspect real vices with their bearings upon two worlds. We are spectators to a plot or intrigue (not reducible in life to the point of strict morality), and take it all for truth. We substitute a real for a dramatic person, and judge him accordingly. We try him in our courts, from which there is no appeal to the dramatis person\u0153, his peers. We have been spoiled with \u2014 not sentimental comedy but a tyrant far more pernicious to our pleasures which has succeeded to it, the exclusive and all-devouring drama of common life; where the moral point is everything; where, instead of the fictitious half-believed"], [76, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. LXVI personages of the stage (the phantoms of old comedy), we recognise ourselves, our brothers, aunts, kinsfolk, allies, patrons, enemies,\u2014 the same as in life,\u2014 with an interest in what is going on so hearty and substantial, that we cannot afford our moral judgment, in its deepest and most vital results, to compromise or slumber for a moment. What is there transacting, by no modification is made to affect us in any other manner than the same events or characters would do in our relationships of life. We carry our fire-side concerns to the theatre with us. We do not go thither, like our ancestors, to escape from the pressure of reality, so much as to confirm our experience of it ; to make assurance double, and take a bond of fate. We must live our toilsome lives twice over, as it was the mournful privilege of Ulysses to descend twice to the shades. All that neutral ground of character, which stood between vice and virtue ; or which in fact was indifferent to neither, where neither properly was called in question ; that happy breathing-place from the burthen of a perpetual moral questioning \u2014 the sanctuary and quiet Alsatia of hunted casuistry \u2014 is broken up and disfranchised, as injurious to the interests of society. The privileges of the place are taken away by law. We dare not dally with images, or names, of wrong. We bark like foolish dogs at shadows. We dread infection from the scenic representation of disorder, and fear a painted pustule. In our anxiety that our morality should not take cold, we wrap it up in a great blanket surtout of precaution against the breeze and sunshine. I confess for myself that (with no great delinquencies to answer for) I am glad for a season to take an airing beyond the diocese of the strict conscience, \u2014 not to live always in the precincts of the law-courts, \u2014 but now and then, for a dream-while or so, to imagine a world with no meddling restrictions \u2014 to get into recesses, whither the hunter cannot follow me \u2014 Secret shades Of woody Ida's inmost grove, While yet there was no fear of Jove. I come back to my cage and my restraint the fresher and more healthy for it. I wear my shackles more contentedly for having respired the breath of an imaginary freedom. I do not know how it is with others, but I feel the better always for the perusal of one of Congreve's \u2014 nay, why should I not add even of Wycherley's \u2014 comedies. I am the gayer at least for it ; and I could never connect those sports of a witty fancy in any shape with any result to be drawn from them to imitation in real life. They are a world of themselves almost as much as fairy-land. Take one of their characters, male or female (with few exceptions they are alike), and place it in a modern play, and my virtuous indignation shall rise against the profligate wretch as warmly as the Catos of the pit could desire; because in a modern play I am to judge of the right and the wrong. The standard of police is the measure of political justice. The atmosphere will blight it, it cannot live here. It has got into a moral world, where it has no business, from which it must needs fall headlong; as dizzy, and incapable of making a stand, as a Swedcnborgian bad spirit that has wandered unawares into the sphere of one of his Good Men, or Angels. But in its own world do we feel the creature is so very bad ? \u2014 The Fainalls and the Mirabels, the Dorimants and the Lady Touchwoods, in their own sphere, do not offend my moral sense; in fact they do not appeal to it at all. They seem engaged in their proper element. They break through no laws, or conscientious restraints. They know of none. They have got out of Christendom into the land of \u2014 what shall I call it? \u2014 of cuckoldry \u2014 the Utopia of gallantry, where pleasure is duty, and the manners perfect freedom. It is altogether a speculative scene of things, which has no reference whatever to the world that is. No good person can be justly offended as a spectator, because no good person suffers on the stage. Judged morally, every character in these plays \u2014 the few exceptions only are mistakes \u2014 is alike essentially vain and worthless. The great art of Congreve is especially shown in this, that he has entirely excluded from his scenes, \u2014 some little generosities in the part of Angelica perhaps excepted, \u2014 not only anything like a faultless character, hut any pretensions to goodness or good feelings whatsoever. Whether he did this designedly, or instinctively, the effect is as happy, as the design (if design) was bold. I used to wonder at the strange power which his \" Way of the World\" in particular possesses of interesting you all along in the pursuits of characters, for whom you absolutely care nothing \u2014 for you neither hate nor love his personages \u2014 and I think it is owing to this very indifference for any, that you endure the whole. He has spread a privation of moral light, I will call it, rather than by the ugly name of palpable darkness, over his creations; and his shadows flit before you without distinction or preference. Had he introduced a good character, a single gush of moral feeling, a revulsion of the judgment to actual life and actual duties, the impertinent Goshcn would have only lighted to the discovery of deformities, which now are none, because we think them none. Translated into real life, the characters of his, and his friend Wycherley's dramas, are profligates and strumpets, \u2014 the business of their brief existence, the undivided pursuit of lawless gallantry. No other spring"], [77, "FAHQUHAR. lxvii of action, or possible motive of conduct, is recognised; principles which, universally acted upon, must reduce this frame of things to a chaos. But we do them wrong in so translating them. No such effects are produced in thew world. When we are among them, we are amongst a chaotic people. We are not to judge them by our usages. No reverend institutions are insulted by their proceedings \u2014 for they have none among them. No peace of families is violated \u2014 for no family ties exist among them. No purity of the marriage-bed is stained \u2014 for none is supposed to have a being. No deep affections are disquieted, no holy wedlock bands are snapped asunder \u2014 for affection's depth and wedded faith are not of the growth of that soil. There is neither right nor wrong, \u2014 gratitude or its opposite, \u2014 claim or duty, \u2014 paternity or sonship. Of what consequence is it to Virtue, or how is sbe at all concerned about it, whether Sir Simon, or Dapperivit, steal away Miss Martha; or who is the father of Lord Froth's or Sir Paul Pliant s children ? The whole isa passing pageant, where we should sit as unconcerned at the issues, for life or death, as at a battle of the frogs and mice. But, like Don Quixote, we take part against the puppets, and quite as impertinently. We dare not contemplate an Atlantis, a scheme, out of which our coxcombical moral sense is for a little transitory ease excluded. We have not the courage to imagine a state of things for which there is neither reward nor punishment. We cling to the painful necessities of shame and blame. We would indict our very dreams. Amidst the mortifying circumstances attendant upon growing old, it is something to have seen the \" School for Scandal\" in its glory. This comedy grew out of Congreve and Wycherley, but gathered some allays of the sentimental comedy which followed theirs. It is impossible that it should be now acted, though it continues, at long intervals, to be announced in the bills. Its hero, when Palmer played it at least, was Joseph Surface. When I remember the gay boldness, the graceful solemn plausibility, the measured step, the insinuating voice \u2014 to express it in a word \u2014 the downright acted villany of the part, so different from the pressure of conscious actual wickedness, \u2014 the hypocritical assumption of hypocrisy, \u2014 which made Jack so deservedly a favourite in that character, I must needs conclude the present generation of playgoers more virtuous than myself, or more dense. I freely confess that he divided the palm with me with his better brother ; that, in fact, I liked him quite as well. Not but there are passages, \u2014 like that, for instance, where Joseph is made to refuse a pittance to a poor relation, \u2014 incongruities which Sheridan was forced upon by the attempt to join the artificial with the sentimental comedy, either of which must destroy the other \u2014 but over these obstructions Jack's manner floated him so lightly, that a refusal from him no more shocked you, than the easy compliance of Charles gave you in reality any pleasure ; you got over the paltry question as quickly as you could, to get back into the regions of pure comedy, where no cold moral reigns. The highly artificial manner of Palmer in this character counteracted every disagreeable impression which you might have received from the contrast, supposing them real, between the two brothers. You did not believe in Joseph with the same faith with which you believed in Charles. The latter was a pleasant reality, the former a no less pleasant poetical foil to it. The comedy, I have said, i? incongruous ; a mixture of Congreve with sentimental incompatibilities : the gaiety upon the whole is buoyant ; but it required the consummate art of Palmer to reconcile the discordant elements. A player with Jack's talents, if we had one now, would not dare to do the part in the same manner. He would instinctively avoid everything which might tend to unrealise, aud so to make the character fascinating. He must take his cue from his spectators, who would expect a bad man and a good man as rigidly opposed to each other as the death-beds of those geniuses are contrasted in the prints, which I am sorry to say have disappeared from the windows of my old friend Carrington Bowles, of St. Paul's Church-yard memory \u2014 (an exhibition as venerable as the adjacent cathedral, and almost coeval) of the bad and good man at the hour of death ; where the ghastly apprehensions of the former, \u2014 and truly the grim phantom with his reality of a toasting-fork is not to be despised, \u2014 so finely contrast with the meek complacent kissing of the rod, \u2014 taking it in like honey and butter, \u2014 with which the latter submits to the scythe of the gentle bleeder, Time, who wields his lancet with the apprehensive finger of a popular young ladies' surgeon. What flesh, like loving grass, would not covet to meet half-way the stroke of such a delicate mower? \u2014 John Palmer was twice an actor in this exquisite part. He was playing to you all the while that he was playing upon Sir Peter and his lady. You had the first intimation of a sentiment before it was on bis lips. His altered voice was meant to you, and you were to suppose that his fictitious co-flutterers on the stage perceived nothing at all of it. What was it to you if that half reality, the husband, was overreached by the puppetry \u2014 or the thin thing {Lady Teazle's reputation) was persuaded it was dying of a plethory ? The fortunes of Othello and Desdemona were not concerned in it. Poor Jack has passed from the stage in good time, that he did not live to this our age of seriousness. The pleasant old Teazle, King, too, is gone in good time. His manner would scarce have"], [78, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. Ivviii passed current in our day.

Joseph Surface to go down now, must be a downright revolting villain-no compromise-his first appearance must shock aud give horror-hie specious plausibilities, which the pleasurable faculties of our fathers welcomed with such hearty greetings, knowing that no harm (dramatic harm even) could come, or was meant to come, of them, must mspire a cold ana killing aversion.'

Oh ! who that remembers Parsons and Dodd\u2014 the wasp and butterfly of \" The School for Scandal\"-in those two characters ; and charming natural Miss Pope, the perfect gentlewoman, as distinguished from the fine lady of comedy, in this latter part\u2014 would forego the true scenic delight\u2014 the escape from life\u2014 the oblivion of consequences\u2014 the holiday barring out of the pedant Reflection\u2014 those Saturnalia of two or three brief hours, well won from the world to sit instead at one of our modern plays \u2014 to have his coward conscience (that forsooth must not be left for a moment) stimulated with perpetual appeals\u2014 dulled rather, and blunted, as a faculty without repose must be\u2014 and his moral vanity pampered with images of notional justice, notional beneficence, lives saved without the spectators' risk, and fortunes given away that cost the author nothing? No piece was, perhaps, ever so completely cast in all its parts as this manager's comedy. Miss Farren had succeeded to Mrs. Abington in Lady Teazle ; and Smith, the original Charles, had retired when I first saw it. The rest of the characters, with very slight exceptions, remained. I remember it was then the fashion to cry down John Kcmble, who took the part of Charles after Smith ; but, I thought, very unjustly. Smith, I fancy, was more airy, and took the eye with a certain gaiety of person. He brought with him no sombre recollections of tragedy. He had not to expiate the fault of having pleased beforehand in lofty declamation. He had no sins of Hamlet or of Richard to atone for. His failure in these parts was a passport to success in one of so opposite a tendency. But, as far as I could judge, the weighty sense of Kcmble made up for more personal incapacity than he had to answer for. His harshest tones in this part came steeped and dulcified in good-humour. He made his defects a grace. His exact declamatory manner, as he managed it, only served to convey the points of his dialogue with more precision. It seemed to head the shafts to carry them deeper. Not one of his sparkling sentences was lost. I remember minutely how he delivered each in succession, and cannot by any effort imagine how any of them could be altered for the better. No man could deliver brilliant dialogue \u2014 the dialogue of Congreve or of Wycherley \u2014 because none understood it \u2014 half so well as John Kcmble. His Valentine, in \" Love for Love,\" was, to my recollection, faultless. He flagged sometimes in the intervals of tragic passion. He would slumber over the level parts of an heroic character. His Macbetli has been known to nod. But he always seemed to me to be particularly alive to pointed aud witty dialogue. The relaxing levities of tragedy have not been touched by any since him \u2014 the playful court-bred spirit in which be condescended to the players in \" Hamlet \" \u2014 the sportive relief which he threw into the darker shades as Richard \u2014 disappeared with him. He had bis sluggish moods, his torpors \u2014 but they were the halting-stones and resting-place of his tragedy \u2014 politic savings and fetches of the breath \u2014 husbandry of the lungs, where nature pointed him to be an economist \u2014 rather, I think, than errors of the judgment. They were, at worst, less painful than the eternal tormenting unappeasable vigilance, \u2014 the \" lidlcss dragon eyes,\" of present fashionable tragedy. Exquisite as every word here is, (a style pickled and preserved out of the delicatest rarities of the brain,) and well calculated as it is to \" give pause \" to another writer of any modesty, we confess we cannot agree with the main point of it, any more than with some of the judgments about the actors."], [79, "FARQUHAR. LXIX The main object we heartily agree with ; namely, the vindication of the writers from the wholesale charges made against them by some feeble people, of immorality and perniciousness. Equally profound and good-natured is Mr. Lamb in whatever he says at all times on the like subjects, as far as regards general spirit and tendency, however we may differ with him as to the conclusions he sometimes draws respecting a fact of time and place. And we confess we think him mistaken both as to the entire fancifulness of the states of society described by Congreve and others, and to the supposition that the sort of critical spirit he objects to is peculiar to the present day, or indeed existing to the full extent of that peculiarity at any time. Mr. Lamb, though a wide and subtle observer, was a sequestered liver. He was also one of an ultra-sensitive temperament, and so anxious to believe the best of everything, on more scores even than such as were healthy, that admitting as he did the utility and even joviality of some graver-looking perplexities in morals, which he was unable to he blind to, yet whenever he could not find what he thought a healthy or harmonious final reason for anything that was not so exactly within the limits of his experience, he was inclined either to doubt it altogether, or, for want of personal sympathy with the gaiety and robustness mixed up with it, and its possible convertibility into something better, to write as if he did. Perhaps he thought (surely not out of any presumption, but because his wisdom was of the best and most child-like sort itself,) that he could even play his readers a child's trick, and persuade them that Congreve's fine ladies and gentlemen, and the rakes of Vanbrugh and Farquhar, were doing nothing but \" making as if.\" Most assuredly he was mistaken ; and yet, with as equal certainty, most assuredly he need not have cared if he was. Nor would he, had the fact pressed itself upon him ; even though he was without the additional comfort of such moralists as see a constant working and progression of society towards improvement. He could reconcile himself, some way or other, to anything which Nature in her energies brought about, or chose to go through. He hated to object to anything, except to objection ; and to that too, when however passionate, it had a generosity and a health in it. But his idiosyneracies, and the possibilities of knowledge consequent upon them, were confined, though his heart was not ; and even what he knew, he would not always choose to remember. Thus he speaks of a pedantic morality which finds nothing but evil in these plays, and which he represents as having come up in our own didactic times, and no longer enabling such plays to be acted. But every age has had a measure of the same kind of criticism, with regard to the one that preceded it. Shakspeare's Jew, Shylock, properly displaced (according to Mr. Lamb himself) the more malignant Jew of Marlowe. He does not complain that the age had found out the moral objection to the latter, or that a morality, no longer pedantic, made progression through the less inhuman nature of Shylock. Thus Dryden, who saw nothing to blame in Etherege, denounced the indecencies of Beaumont and Fletcher ; while Steele, who recommended Congreve, thought Etherege not to be endured. Neither is it a fact that the comedies of the last age are no longer played or enjoyed. Whenever an actor comes up who is equal to them, \u2014 such as Mr. Farren, for instance, \u2014 they are always played and enjoyed ; nor do the present audiences of Covent Garden object to them in the least, in the spirit of a pedantic morality. A critic here and there may do so ; but it is neither the feeling of the press in general, nor of the play-going public ; and if Congreve would not be liked now, neither was he in his own times, for what would now get him condemned. \"Love for Love\" is always liked when players can be got for it : so was the \" Old Bachelor,\" as far as Munden was concerned, even though astrology is gone out ; but the villainous and tragical vices of some of the other of Congreve's plays hurt them in his own day, and were the cause in fact why he quitted the stage. In a word, there is more sympathy with real gaiety and spirits at all times, and greater instinctive allowance for the free drawing of nature and its healthy tendencies, than Mr. Lamb in this instance supposed ;' and unless there is a still more delicate inner doctrine in his essay than we seem warranted in supposing from some of the peremptory and final terms in it, we must believe it to be as unfounded in some conclusions, as it is admirable in every other respect, and useful for the enlargement of the understanding. Perhaps, after all, he intended nothing very different from what we do ourselves, though he took a different road for suggesting it. Certainly he intended nothing less innocent, \u2014 nor more so."], [80, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. IXX We cannot help thinking that Mr. Hazlitt's almost equally admirable essay on these writers (almost in point of style, and superior in hearty relish), leaves the far truer impression respecting them, as well as contains the best and most detailed criticism on their individual plays. We did not read either of these essays over again, till we had concluded our own remarks (for what we have here said of both is an insertion) ; but as we thought it would be an injustice to the reader to withhold from him what he hi* just seen, so we hold that it would be a still greater not to give him the benefit of the masterly criticism of Mr. Hazlitt. After we had again become acquainted with them, we found reason, generally speaking, to think nothing of our own, except inasmuch as we observed a prevailing similarity of opinion. Nor may the reader be sorry to hear a third lover of the drama speak on a subject so agreeable. What we hold ourselves to have contributed to this volume is a more pains-taking set of memoirs than, we believe, has yet appeared. Mr. Hazlitt's essay will complete, amplify, and abundantly enrich the criticism ; and Mr. Lamb's will carry to its height a speculation more exquisitely artificial than its subject, and advantageous, some way or other, to all parties. But Hazlitt, it is to be observed, has none of the misgivings of Lamb. He does not even think it necessary to notice them. He takes the whole tribe, as nature and society (short of the exaggerations of art) threw them forward during the progress of civilization, neither doubting their reality, nor startled at it, nor forced to reconcile himself to the robustness of its levity. At all events, the reader in these additions to our prefatory matter will hear the opinions of two out of the three great critics whom we not long ago had among us. (Ah, Coleridge ! and art thou gone away into an infinitude hardly wider than thy thoughts ! Ah, dear Hazlitt and Lamb, old tea drinking friends and teachers ! must he that writes this \u2014 learn no more from you, in voice as well as in mute books ? Is it true, as sometimes he can hardly think it is \u2014 that neither of you is again coming down the street to his door, nor he to yours ? and that he even can write a little better poetry than he did, and you not be alive to turn these tears in his eyes to pride instead of sorrow ?) ON WYCHERLEY, CONGREYE, VANBRUGH, AND FARQUHAR. CoMEny is a \"graceful ornament to the civil order; the Corinthian capital of polished society.\" Like the mirrors which have been added to the sides of one of our theatres, it reflects the images of grace, of gaiety, and pleasure double, and completes the perspective of human life. To read a good comedy is to keep the best company in the world, where the best things are said, and the most amusing happen. The wittiest remarks are always ready on the tongue, and the luckiest occasions are always at hand to give birth to the happiest conceptions. Sense makes strange havoc of nonsense. Refinement acts as a foil to affectation, and affectation to ignorance. Sentence after sentence tells. We don't know which to admire most, the observation, or the answer to it. We would give our fingers to be able to talk so ourselves, or to hear others talk so. In turning over the pages of the best comedies, we are almost transported to another world, and escape from this dull age to one that was all life, and whim, and mirth, and humour. The curtain rises, and a gayer scene presents itself, as on the canvas of Watteau. We are admitted behind the scenes like spectators at court, on a levee or birth-day; but it is the court, the gala-day of wit and pleasure, of gallantry and Charles II. ! What an air breathes from the name ! what a rustling of silks and waving of plumes '. what a sparkling of diamond ear-rings and shoe-buckles ! What bright eyes, (ah, those were Waller's Sacharissa's as she passed !) what killing looks and graceful emotions ! How the faces of the whole ring are dressed in smiles ! how the repartee goes round ! how wit and folly, elegance and awkward imitation of it, set one another off ! Happy, thoughtless age, when kings aud nobles led purely ornamental lives; when the utmost stretch of a morning's study went no farther than the choice of a sword-knot, or the adjustment of a side-curl ; when the soul spoke out in all the pleasing eloquence of dress ; and beaux and belles, enamoured of themselves in one another's follies, fluttered like gilded butterflies, in giddy mazes, through the walks of St. James's Park ! The four principal writers of this style of comedy (which I think the best) are undoubtedly Wycherley, Congreve, Yanbrugb, and Farquhar. The dawn was in Etherege, as its latest close was in Sheridan. It is"], [81, "WYCHERLEY, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, AND FARQUHAR. IXXI hard to say which of these four is best, or in what each of them excels, they had so many and such great excellences. Congreve is the most distinct from the others, and the most easily defined, both from what he possessed, and from what he wanted. He had by far the most wit and elegance, with less of othei tilings, of humour, character, incident, &c. His style is inimitable, nay perfect. It is the highest model of comic dialogue. Every sentence js replete with sense and satire, conveyed in the most polished and pointed terms. Every page presents a shower of brilliant conceits, is a tissue of epigrams in prose, is a new triumph of wit, a new conquest over dulness. The fire of artful raillery is nowhere else so well kept up. This style, which he was almost the first to introduce, and which he carried to the utmost pitch of classical refinement, reminds one exactly of Collins* s description of wit as opposed to humour, u Whose jewels in his crisped hair Are placed each other's light to share.\" Sheridan will not bear a comparison with him in the regular antithetical construction of his sentences, and in the mechanical artifices of his style, though so much later, and though style in general has been so much studied, and in the mechanical part so much improved since then. It bears every mark of being what he himself in the dedication of one of his plays tells us that it was, a spirited copy taken off and carefully revised from the most select society of his time, exhibiting all the sprightliness, ease, and animation of familiar conversation, with the correctness and delicacy of the most finished composition. His works are a singular treat to those who have cultivated a taste for the niceties of English style : there is a peculiar flavour in the very words, which is to be found in hardly any other writer. To the mere reader his writings would be an irreparable loss : to the stage they are already become a dead letter, with the exception of one of them, \u2014 \" Love for Love.\" This play is as full of character, incident, and stage effect, as almost any of those of his contemporaries, and fuller of wit than any of his own, except perhaps \" The Way of the World.\" It still acts, and is still acted well. The effect of it is prodigious on the well-informed spectator. In particular. Munden's Foresight, if it is not just the thing, is a wonderfully rich and powerful piece of comic acting. His look is planet-struck ; his dress and appearance like one of the signs of the zodiac taken down. Nothing can be more bewildered ; and it only wants a little more helplessness, a little more of the doting querulous garrulity of age, to be all that one conceives of the superannuated star-gazing original. The gay, unconcerned opening of this play, and the romantic generosity of the conclusion, where Valentine, when about to resign his mistress, declares \u2014 \" I never valued fortune, but as it was subservient to my pleasure ; and my only pleasure was to please this lady,\" \u2014 are alike admirable. The peremptory bluntuess and exaggerated description of Sir Sampson Legend are in a vein truly oriental, with a Shakspearian cast of language, and form a striking contrast to the quaint credulity and senseless superstitions of Foresight. The remonstrance of his son to him, \" to divest him, along with his inheritance, of his reason, thoughts, passions, inclinations, affections, appetites senses, and the huge train of attendants which he brought into the world with him,\" with his valet's accom- panying comments, is one of the most eloquent and spirited specimens of wit, pathos, and morality, that is to be found. The short scene with Trapland, the money-broker, is of the first water. What a picture is here drawn of Tattle! \"More misfortunes, sir!\" says Jeremy. Valentine: \" What, another dun?\" Jeremy: \" No, sir : but Mr. Tattle is come to wait upon you.\" What an introduction to give of an honest gentleman in the shape of a misfortune ! The scenes between him, Miss Prue, and Ben, are of a highly- coloured description. Mrs. Frail aud Mrs. Foresight are \"sisters every way;\" and the bodkin which Mrs. Foresight brings as a proof of her sister's levity of conduct, and which is so convincingly turned against her as a demonstration of her own \u2014 \" Nay, if you come to that, where did you find that bodkin ?\" \u2014 is one of the trophies of the moral justice of the comic drama. \"The Old Bachelor\" and \"Double Dealer\" are inferior to \" Love for Love,\" but one is never tired of reading them. The fault of the last is, that Lady Touchwood approaches, in the turbulent impetuosity of her character and measured tone of her declamation, too near to the tragedy-queen; and that MaskivcWs plots puzzle the brain by their intricacy, as they stagger our belief by their gratuitous villany. Sir Paid and Lady Pliant, and my Lord and Lady Froth, are also scarcely credible in the extravagant insipidity and romantic vein of their follies, in which they are notably seconded by the lively Mr. Brisk and \" dying Ned Careless.''* \" The Way of the World \" was the author's last and most carefully finished performance. It is an essence almost too fine; and the sense of pleasure evaporates in an aspiraLion after something that seems too exquisite ever to have been realised. After inhaling the spirit of Congreve's wit, and tasting \" love's thrice reputed"], [82, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. Ixxii nectar\" in his works, the head grows giddy in turning from the highest point of rapture to the ordinary business of life ; and we can with difficulty recall the truant Fancy to those objects which we are fain to take up with here, for better, for worse. What can be more enchanting than Millamant and her morning thoughts, her doux sommeils ? What more provoking than her reproach to her lover, who proposes to rise early, \" Ah ! idle creature !\" The meeting of these two lovers after the abrupt dismissal of Sir Wilful is the height of careless and voluptuous elegance, as if they moved in air, and drank a finer spirit of humanity. \" Millamant. Like Ph\u0153bus sung the no less amorous boy. Mirabell. Like Daphne she, as lovely and as coy.\" Millamant is the perfect model of the accomplished fine lady. KCome, then, the colours and the ground prepare, Dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air; Choose a firm cloud, before it falls, and in it Catch, ere she change, the Cynthia of a minute.\" She is the ideal heroine of the comedy of high life, who arrives at the height of indifference to everything from the height of satisfaction; to whom pleasure is as familiar as* the air she draws ; elegance worn as a part of her dress ; wit the habitual language which she hears and speaks ; love, a matter of course ; and who has nothing to hope or to fear, her own caprice being the only law to herself, and rule to those about her. Her words seem composed of amorous sighs \u2014 her looks are glanced at prostrate admirers or envious rivals. \" If there 's delight in love, 'tis when I see That heart that others bleed for, bleed for me.\" She refines on her pleasures to satiety ; and is almost stifled in the incense that is offered to her person, her wit, her beauty, and her fortune. Secure of triumph, her slaves tremble at her frown ; her charms are so irresistible, that her conquests give her neither surprise nor concern. \"Beauty, the lover's gift?\" she exclaims, in answer to Mirabell \u2014 \" Dear me,, what is a lover that it can give ? Why one makes lovers as fast as one pleases, and they live as long as one pleases, and they die as soon as one pleases ; and then if one pleases, one makes more.\" We are not sorry to see her tamed down at last, from her pride of love and beauty, into a wife. She is good-natured and generous, with all her temptations to the contrary ; and her behaviour to Mirabell reconciles us to her treatment of Witwoud and Petulant, and of her country admirer, Sir Wilful. Congreve has described all this in his character of Millamant, but he has done no more ; and if he had, he would have done wrong. He has given us the finest idea of an artificial character of this kind ; but it is still the reflection of an artificial character. The springs of nature, passion, or imagination are but feebly touched. The impressions appealed to, and with masterly address, are habitual, external, and conventional advantages : the ideas of birth, of fortune, of connexions, of dress, accomplishment, fashion, the opinion of the world, of crowds of admirers, continually come into play, flatter our vanity, bribe our interest, soothe our indolence, fall in with our prejudices; \u2014 it is these that support the goddess of our idolatry, with which she is everything, and without which she would be nothing. The mere fine lady of comedy, compared with the heroine of romance or poetry, when stripped of her adventitious ornaments and advantages, is too much like the doll stripped of its finery. In thinking of Millamant, we think almost as much of her dress as of her person : it is not so with respect to Rosalind or Perdita. The poet has painted them differently ; in colours which \"nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on,\" with health, with innocence, with gaiety, \" wild wit, invention ever new ; \" with pure red and white, like the wilding's blossoms ; with warbled wood-notes, like the feathered choir's ; with thoughts fluttering on the wings of imagination, and hearts panting and breathless with eager delight. The interest we feel is in themselves ; the admiration they excite is for themselves. They do not depend upon the drapery of circumstances. It is nature that \" blazons herself\" in them. Imogen is the same in a lonely cave as in a court ; nay more, for she there seems something heavenly\u2014a spirit or a vision ; and, as it were, shames her destiny, brighter for the foil of circumstances. Millamant is nothing but a fine lady ; and all her airs and affectation would be blown away with the first breath of misfortune. Enviable in drawing-rooms, adorable at her toilette, fashion, like a witch, has thrown its spell around her; hut if that spell were broken, her power of fascination would be gone. For that reason I think the character better adapted for the stage: it is more artificial, more theatrical, more meretricious. I would rather have seen Mrs."], [83, "WYCHERLEY, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, AND FARQUHAR. lxxiii Abington's Millamant, than any Rosalind that ever appeared on the stage. Some how, this sort of acquired elegance is more a thing of costume, of air and manner; and in comedy, or on the comic stage, the light and familiar, the trifling, superficial, and agreeable, bears, perhaps, rightful sway over that which touches the affections, or exhausts the fancy. \u2014 There is a callousness in the worst characters in the \" Way of the World,\" in Fainall, and his wife aud Mrs. Marwood, not very pleasant ; and a grossness in the absurd ones, such as Lady Wishfort and Sir Wilful, which is not a little amusing. Witwoud wishes to disclaim, as far as ho can, his relationship to this last character, and says, \" he is but his half-brother ; \" to which Mirabell makes answer \u2014 \"Then, perhaps, he's but half a fool.\" Peg is an admirable caricature of rustic awkwardness and simplicity, which is carried to excess without any offence, from a sense of contrast to the refinement of the chief characters in the play. The description of Lady Wishforfs face is a perfect piece of painting. The force of style in this author at times amounts to poetry. Waitwell, who personates Sir Rowland, and Foible, his accomplice in the matrimonial scheme upon ber mistress, hang as a dead weight upon the plot. They are mere tools in the hands of Mirabell, and want life and interest. Congreve's characters can all of them speak well, they are mere machines when they come to act. Our author's superiority deserted him almost entirely with his wit. His serious and tragic poetry is frigid and jejune to an unaccountable degree. His forte was the description of actual manners, whether elegant or absurd; and when he could not deride the one or embellish the other, his attempts at romantic passion or imaginary enthusiasm are forced, abortive, and ridiculous, or common-place. The description of the ruins of a temple in the beginning of the \" Mourning Bride,\" was a great stretch of his poetic genius. It has, however, been over-rated, particularly by Dr. Johnson, who could have done nearly as well himself for a single passage in the same style of moralising and sentimental description. To justify this general censure, and to show how the lightest and most graceful wit degenerates into the heaviest and most bombastic poetry, I will give one description out of his tragedy, which will be enough. It is the speech which Gonsalez addresses to Almeria : \" Be every day of your long life like this. The sun, bright conquest, and your brighter eyes Have all conspired to blaze promiscuous light, And bless this day with most unequal lustre. Your royal father, my victorious lord, Loaden with spoils, and ever-living laurel, Is entering now, in martial pomp, the palace. Five hundred mules precede his solemn march, Which groan beneath the weight of Moorish wealth. Chariots of war, adorn'd with glittering gems, Succeed ; and next, a hundred neighing steeds, White as the fleecy rain on Alpine hills; That bound, and foam, and champ the golden bit, As they disdain* d the victory they grace. Prisoners of war in shining fetters follow : And captains of the noblest blood of Afric Sweat by his chariot-wheels, and lick and grind, With gnashing teeth, the dust his triumphs raise. The swanuing populace spread every wall, And cling, as if with claws they did enforce Their hold, through clifted stones stretching and staring As if they were all eyes, and every limb Would feed its faculty of admiration, While you alone retire, and shun this sight ; This sight, which is indeed not seen (though twice The multitude should gaze) in absence of your eyes.\" This passage seems, in part, an imitation of Bolingbroke's entry into London. The style is as different from Shakspeare, as it is from that of Witwoud and Petulant. It is plain that the imagination of the author could not raise itself above the burlesque. His Mask of Semele, Judgment of Paris, and other occasional poems, are even worse. I would not advise any one to read them, or if I did, they would not."], [84, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. lxxiv Wycherley was before Congreve ; and his \" Country Wife\" will last longer than anything of Congreve's, as a popular acting play. It is only a pity that it is not entirely his own ; but it is enough so to do him never-ceasing honour, for the best things are his own. His humour is, in general, broader, his characters more natural, and his incidents more striking, than Congreve's. It may be said of Congreve that the workmanship overlays the materials : in Wycherley, the casting of the parts and the fable are alone sufficient to ensure success. We forget Congreve's characters, and only remember what they say : we remember Wycherley's characters, and the incidents they meet with, just as if they were real, and forget what they say, comparatively speaking. Miss Peggy (or Mrs. Margery Pinchwife) is a character that will last for ever, I should hope ; and even when the original is no more, if that should ever be, while self-will, curiosity, art, and ignorance are to be found in the same person, it will be just as good and as intelligible as ever in the description, because it is built on first principles, and brought out in the fullest and broadest manner. Agnes, in Moliere's play, has a great deal of the same unconscious impulse and heedless naivete, but hers is sentimen talised and varnished over (in the French fashion) with long-winded apologies and analytical distinctions. It wants the same simple force and home truth. It is not so direct and downright. Miss Peggy is not even a novice in casuistry : she blurts out her meaning before she knows what she is saying, and she speaks her mind by her actions oftener than by her words. The outline of the plot is the same ; but the point-blank hits and master-strokes, the sudden thoughts and delightful expedients, such as her changing the letters, the meeting her husband plump in the Park as she is running away from him as fast as her heels can carry her, her being turned out of doors by her jealous booby of a husband, and sent by him to her lover disguised as Alicia, her sister-in-law \u2014 occur first in the modern play. There are scarcely any incidents or situations on the stage, which tell like these for pantomimic effect, which give such tingling to the blood, or so completely take away the breath with expectation and surprise. Miss Prue, in \" Love for Love,\" is a lively reflection of Miss Peggy, but without the bottom and weight of metal. Hoydenis a match for her in constitution and complete effect, as Corinna, in the \" Confederacy,\" is in mischief, but without the wit. Mrs. Jordan used to play all these characters ; and as she played them, it was hard to know which was best. Pinchwife or Moody, (as he is at present called) is, like others of Wycherley's moral characters, too rustic, abrupt, and cynical. He is a more disagreeable, but lesB tedious character than the husband of Agnes, and both seem, by all accounts, to have been rightly served. The character of Sparkish is quite new, and admirably hit off. He is an exquisite and suffocating coxcomb ; a pretender to wit and letters, without common understanding, or the use of his senses. The class of character is thoroughly exposed and understood ; but he persists in his absurd conduct so far, that it becomes extravagant and disgusting, if not incredible, from mere weakness and foppery. Yet there is something in him that we are inclined to tolerate at first, as his professing that \" with him a wit is the first title to respect;\" and we regard his unwillingness to be pushed out of the room, and coming back, in spite of their teeth, to keep the company of wits and raillers, as a favourable omen. But he utterly disgraces his pretensions before he has done. With all his faults and absurdities, he is, however, a much less offensive character than Tattle. \u2014 Horner is a stretch of probability in the first concoction of that ambiguous character (for he does not appear at present on the stage as Wycherley made him) j but notwithstanding the indecency and indirectness of the means he employs to carry his plans into effect, he deserves every sort of consideration and forgiveness, both for the display of his own ingenuity, and the deep insight he discovers into human nature \u2014 such as it was in the time of Wycherley. The author has commented on this character, and the double meaning of the name in his \" Plain Dealer,\" borrowing the remarks, and almost the very words of Moliere, who has brought forward and defended his own work against the objections of the precise part of his audience, iu his Critique de VEcole des Femmes. There is no great harm in these occasional plagiarisms, except that they make one uncomfortable at other times, and distrustful of the originality of the whole. \u2014 ' The Plain Dealer \" is Wycherley's next best work ; and is a most severe and poignant moral satire. There is a heaviness about it, indeed, an extravagance, an overdoing both in the style, the plot, and characters ; but the truth of feeling and the force of interest prevail over every objection. The character of Manly, the Plain Dealer, is violent, repulsive, and uncouth, which is a fault, though one that seems to have been intended for the sake of contrast ; for the portrait of consummate, artful hypocrisy in Olivia, is, perhaps, rendered more striking by it. Tho indignation excited against this odious and pernicious quality by the masterly exposure to which it is here subjected, is \" a discipline of humanity.\" No one can read this play attentively without being the better for it as long as he lives. It penetrates to the core ; it shows the immorality and hateful effects of duplicity, by showing it fixing its harpy fangs in the heart of an honest and worthy man. It is worth ten volumes of sermons. The scenes between Manly after his return, Olivia, Plausible, and Novel, are instructive examples of unblushing impudence, of shallow pretensions to principle."], [85, "WYCHERLEY, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, AND FARQUHAR. LXXV aud of the most mortifying reflections on his own situation, and hitter sense of female injustice and ingratitude, on the part of Manly. The devil of hypocrisy and hardened assurance seems worked up to the highest pitch of conceivable effrontery in Olivia, when, after confiding to her cousin the story of her infamy, she, in a moment, turns round upon her for some sudden purpose, and affecting not to know the meaning of the other's allusions to what she has just told her, reproaches her with forging insinuations to the prejudice of her character, and in violation of their friendship. \" Go ! you 're a censorious ill woman.\" This is more trying to the patience than anything in the Tartuffe. The name of this heroine, and her overtures to Fidelia, as the page, seem to have been suggested by \" Twelfth Night.\" It is curious to see how the same subject is treated by two such different authors as Shakspeare and Wycherley. The widow Blackacre and her son arc like her lawsuit \u2014 everlasting. A more lively, palpable, bustling, ridiculous picture cannot be drawn. Jerry is a hopeful lad, though undutiful, and gets out of bad hands into worse. Goldsmith evidently had an eye to these two precious characters, in \" She Stoops to Conquer.\" Tony Lumpkin and his mother are of the same family, and the incident of the theft of the casket of jewels, and the bag of parchments, is nearly the same in both authors. Wycherley's other plays are not so good. \" The Gentleman Dancing Master \" is a long, foolish farce, in the exaggerated manner of Moliere, but without bis spirit or whimsical invention. \" Love in a Wood,\" though not what one would wish it to be for the author's sake or our own, is much better, and abounds in several rich and highly-coloured scenes, particularly those in which Miss Lucy, her mother Crossbite, Dappervsit, and Alderman Gripe, are concerned. Some of the subordinate characters and intrigues in this comedy are grievously spun out. Wycherley, when he got hold of a good thing, or sometimes even of a bad one, was determined to make the most of it ; and might have said with Dogberry, truly enough, \" Had I the tediousness of a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all upon your worships.\" In reading this author's best works, those which one reads most frequently over, and knows almost by heart, one cannot help thinking of the treatment he received from Pope about his verses. It was hardly excusable in a boy of sixteen to an old man of seventy. -\u00bb Vanbrugh comes next, and holds his own fully with the best. He is no writer at all, as to mere author- ship ; but he makes up for it by a prodigious fund of comic invention and ludicrous description, bordering 6omewhat on caricature. Though he did not borrow from him, he was much more like Moliere in genius than Wycherley was, who professedly imitated him. He has none of Congreve's graceful refinement, and as little of Wycherley's 6erious manner and studied insight into the springs of character ; but his exhibition of it in dramatic contrast and unlooked-for situations, where the different parties play upon one another's failings, and into one another's hands, keeping up the jest like a game at battledore and shuttlecock, and urging it to the utmost verge of breathless extravagance, in the mere eagerness of the fray, is beyond that of any other of our writers. His fable is not so profoundly laid, nor his characters so well digested as Wycherley's (who, in these respects, bore some resemblance to Fielding). Yanbrugh does not lay the same deliberate train from the outset to the conclusion, so that the whole may hang together, and tend inevitably from the combination of different agents and circumstances to the same decisive point : but he works out scene after scene, on the spur of the occasion, and from the immediate hold they take of his imagination at the moment, without any previous bias or ultimate purpose, much more powerfully, with more verve, and in a richer vein of original invention. His fancy warms and burnishes out as if he were engaged in the real scene of action, and felt all his faculties suddenly called forth to meet the emergency. He has more nature than art : what he does best, he does because he cannot help it. He has a masterly eye to the advantages which certain accidental situations of character present to him on the spot, and he executes the most difficult and rapid theatrical movements at a moment's warning. Of this kind are the inimitable scenes in the \" Provoked Wife,\" between Razor and Mademoiselle, where they repeat and act over again the rencontre in the Mulberry-walk between Constant and his mistress, than which nothing was ever more happily conceived, or done to more absolute perfection ; that again in the \" Relapse,\" where Loveless pushes Berinthia into the closet ; the sudden meeting in the \"Confederacy\" between Dick and Mrs. Amlet ; the altercation about the letter between Flippanta and Corinna, in the same play; and that again where Brass, at the house of Gripe the money-scrivener, threatens to discover his friend and accomplice, and by talking louder and louder to him, as he tries to evade his demands, extorts a grudging submission from him. This last scene is as follows : \u2014 \"Dick. I wish my old hobbling mother han't been blabbering something here she should not do. Brass. Fear nothing, all's safe on that side yet. But how speaks young mistress's epistle ? soft and tender? Dick. As pen can write. Brass. So you think all goes well there"], [86, "Ixxvi BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. Dick.

I am a man of honour and restore : and so, the treaty being finished, I strike my flag of defiance, and fall into my respects again.\" [Takes off his hat. The \" Confederacy\" is a comedy of iufinite contrivance and intrigue, with a matchless spirit of impudence. It is a fine careless expose' of heartless want of principle ; for there is no anger or severity against vice expressed in it, as in Wycherley. The author's morality in all cases (except his \" Provoked Wife,\" which was under taken as a penance for past peccadilloes) sits very loose upon him. It is a little upon the turn ; \" it does somewhat smack.\" Old Palmer, as Dick Amlet, asking his mother's blessing on his knee, was the very idea of a graceless son. \u2014 His sweetheart Corinna is a Miss Prue, but nature works in her more powerfully. \u2014 Lord Foppington, in the \" Relapse,\" is a most splendid caricature : he is a personification of the foppery and folly of dress and external appearance in full feather. He blazes out and dazzles sober reason with ridiculous ostentation. Still I think this character is a copy from Etherege's Sir Fopling Flutter, and upon the whole, perhaps, Sir Fopling is the more natural grotesque of the two. His soul is more in his dress ; he is a more disinterested coxcomb. The lord is an ostentatious, strutting, vain-glorious blockhead; the knight is an unaffected, self-complacent, serious admirer of his equipage and person. For instance, what they severally say on the subject of contemplating themselves in the glass, is a proof of this. Sir Fopling thinks a looking-glass in the room \" the best company in the world ; \" it is another self to him : Lord Foppington merely considers it as necessary to adjust his appearance, that he may make a figure in company. The finery of the one has an imposing air of grandeur about it, and is studied for effect : the other is really in love with a laced suit, and is hand and glove with the newest-cut fashion. He really thinks his tailor or peruke-maker the greatest man in the world, while his lordship treats them familiarly as necessary appendages of his person. Still this coxcomb nobleman's effeminacy and mock-heroic vanity are admirably depicted and held up to unrivalled ridicule; and his courtship of Miss Hoyden is excellent in all its stages, and ends oracularly. \"Lord Foppington. \u2014 Now, for my part, I think the wisest thing a man can do with an aching heart, is to put on a serene countenance ; for a philosophical air is the most becoming thing in the world to the face of a person of quality : I will therefore bear my disgrace like a great man, and let the people see I am above an affront. \u2014 [Then turning to his brother.] Dear Tam, since things are thus fallen out, pr'ythee give me leave to wish thee joy : I do it de bon c\u0153ur, strike me dumb : you have married a woman beautiful in her person, charming in her airs, prudent in her conduct, constant in her inclinations, and of a nice morality \u2014 stap my vitals ! \" Poor Hoyden fares ill in his lordship's description of her, though she could expect no better at his hands for her desertion of him. She wants sentiment, to be sure, but she has other qualifications \u2014 she is a fine bouncing piece of flesh and blood. Her first announcement is decisive \u2014 * Let loose the greyhound, and lock up Hoydens Her declaration, \" It 's well they 've got me a husband, or ecod, I 'd marry the baker,\" comes from her mouth like a shot from a culverin, and leaves no doubt, by its effect upon the ear, that she would have made it good in the sequel, if she had not been provided for. Her indifference to the man she is to marry, and her attachment to the finery and the title, are justified by an attentive observation of nature in its simplest guise. There is, however, no harm in Hoyden ; she merely wishes to consult her own inclination : she is by no means like Corinna in the \" Confederacy,\" \"a devilish girl at the bottom,\" nor is it her great delight to plague other people. \u2014 Sir Tunbelly Clumsy is the right worshipful and worthy father of so delicate an offspring. He is a coarse, substantial contrast to the flippant and flimsy Lord Foppington. If the one is not without reason \" proud to be at the head of so prevailing a party \" as that of coxcombs, the other may look big and console himself (under some affronts) with being a very competent representative, a knight of the shire, of the once formidable, though now obsolete class of country squires, who had no idea beyond the boundaries of their own estates, or the circumference of their own persons. His unwieldy dulness gives, by the rule of contraries, a lively sense of lightness and grace : his stupidity answers all the purposes of wit. His portly paunch repels a jest like a woolsack : a sarcasm rebounds from him like a ball. His presence is a cure for gravity ; and he is a standing satire upon himself and the class in natural history to which he belonged. \u2014 Sir John Brute, in the \" Provoked Wife,\" is an animal of the Bame English growth, but of a cross-grained breed. He has a spice of the demon mixed up with the brute ; is mischievous as well as stupid ; has improved his natural parts by a town education and example ; opposes the fine-lady airs and graces of his wife by brawling oaths, impenetrable surliness, and pot-house valour ; overpowers any tendency she might have to vapours or hysterics, by the fumes of tobacco and strong beer ; and thinks to be master in his own house by roaring in taverns, reeling home drunk every night, breaking lamps, and beating the watch. He does not, however, find this loidly"], [88, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. lxxviii method answer. He turns out to be a coward as well as a bully, and dares not resent the inj.iries he has provoked by his unmanly behaviour. This was Garrick's favourite part; and I have heard that his acting in the drunken scene, in which he was disguised, not as a clergyman, but as a woman of the town, which was an alteration of his own to suit the delicacy of the times, was irresistible. The ironical conversations in this play between Belinda and Lady Brute, as well as those in the \"Relapse,\" between A manda and her cousin Berinthia, will do to compare with Congreve in the way of wit and studied raillery, but they will not stand the comparison. Araminta and Clarissa keep np the ball between them with more spirit, for their conversa tion is very like that of kept-mistresses ; and the mixture of fashionable slang and professed want of principle gives a sort of zest and high seasoning to their confidential communications, which Vanbrugh could supply as well as anybody. But he could not do without the taint of grossness and licentiousness. Lady Townly is not the really vicious character, nor quite the fine lady, which the author would have her to be. Lady Grace is so far better : she is what she pretends to be, merely sober and insipid. \u2014 Vanbrugh's forte was not the sentimental or didactic ; his genius flags and grows dull when it is not put into action, and wants the stimulus of sudden emergency, or the fortuitous collision of different motives, to call out all its force and vivacity. His antitheses are happy and brilliant contrasts of character; his double entendres equivocal situations; his best jokes are practical devices, not epigrammatic conceits. His wit is that which is emphatically called mother-wit. It brings those who possess it, or to whom he lends it, into scrapes by its restlessness, and brings them out of them by its alacrity. Several of his favourite characters are knavish, adroit adventurers, who have all the gipsy jargon, the cunning impudence, cool presence of mind, selfishness, and indefatigable industry ; all the excuses, lying, dexterity, the intellectual juggling and legerdemain tricks, necessary to fit them for this sort of predatory warfare on the simplicity, follies, or vices of mankind. He discovers the utmost dramatic generalship in bringing off his characters at a pinch, and by an instantaucous ruse de guerre, when the case seems hopeless in any other bands. The train of his associations, to express the same thing in metaphysical language, lies in following the suggestions of his fancy into every possible connexion of cause and effect, rather than into every possible combination of likeness or difference. His ablest characters show that they are so by displaying their ingenuity, address, and presence of mind in critical junctures, and in their own affairs, rather than their wisdom or their wit \" in intellectual gladiatorship,\" or in speculating on the affairs and characters of other people. Farquhar's chief characters are also adventurers ; but they are adventurers of a romantic, not a knavish stamp, and succeed no less by their honesty than their boldness. They conquer their difficulties, and effect their \" hair-breadth 'scapes \" by the impulse of natural enthusiasm and the confidence of high principles of gallantry and honour, as much as by their dexterity and readiness at expedients. They are real gentlemen, and only pretended impostors. Vanbrugh's upstart heroes are without \"any relish of salvation,\" without generosity, virtue, or any pretensions to it. We have little sympathy for them, and no respect at all. But we have every sort of good-will towards Farquhar's heroes, who have as many peccadilloes to answer for, and play as many rogue's tricks, but are honest fellows at bottom. I know little other difference between these two capital writers and copyists of nature, than that Farquhar's nature is the better nature of the two. We seem to like both the author and his favourites. He has humour, character, and invention, in common with the other, with a more unaffected gaiety and spirit of enjoyment, which overflows and sparkles in all he does. He makes us laugh from pleasure oftener tham from malice. He somewhere prides himself in having introduced on the stage the class of comic heroes here spoken of, which has since become a standard character, and which represents the warm-hearted, rattle-brained, thoughtless, high-spirited young fellow, who floats on the back of his misfortunes without repining, who forfeits appearances, but saves bis honour \u2014 and he gives us to understand that it was his own. He did not need to be ashamed of it. Indeed there is internal evidence that this sort of character is his own, for it pervades his works generally, and is the moving spirit that informs them. His comedies have on this account, probably, a greater appearance of truth and nature than almost any others. His incidents succeed one another with rapidity, but without premeditation ; his wit is easy and spontaneous ; his style animated, unembarrassed, and flowing ; his characters full of life and spirit, and never overstrained so as to \" o'erstep the modesty of nature,\" though they sometimes, from haste and carelessness, seem left in a crude, unfinished state. There is a constant ebullition of gay, laughing invention, cordial good-humour, and fine animal spirits, in his writings. Of the four writers here classed together, we should perhaps have courted Congreve's acquaintance most, for his wit and the elegance of his manners ; Wycherley's, for his sense and observation on human nature ; Vanbrugh's, for his power of farcical description and telling a story ; Farquhar's, for the pleasure of his society, and the love of good fellowship. His fine gentlemen arc not gentlemen of fortune and fashion, like those in"], [89, "WYCHERLEY, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, AND FARQUHAR. Ixxix Congreve; but are rather \"God Almighty's gentlemen.\" His valets are good fellows; even his chamber maids are some of them disinterested and sincere. But his fine ladies, it must be allowed, are not so amiable, so witty, or accomplished, as those in Congreve. Perhaps they both described women in high life as they found them : Congreve took their conversation, Farquhar their conduct. In the way of fashionable vice and petrifying affectation, there is nothing to come up to his Lady Lurewell, in the \" Trip to the Jubilee.\" She by no means makes good Mr. Burke1 s courtly and chivalrous observation, that the evil of vice consists principally in its want of refinement; and one benefit of the dramatic exhibition of such characters is, that they overturn false maxims of morality, and settle accounts fairly and satisfactorily between theory and practice. Her lover, Colonel Standard, is indeed an awkward incumbrauce upon so fine a lady : it was a character that the poet did not like; aud he has merely sketched him in, leaving him to answer for himself as well as he could, which is but badly. We have no suspicion, either from his conduct, or from any hint dropped by accident, that he is the first seducer and the possessor of the virgin affections of Lady Lurewell. The double transformation of this virago from vice to virtue, and from virtue to vice again, her plausible pretensions and artful wiles, her violent temper and dissolute passions, show a thorough knowledge of the effects both of nature and habit in making up human character. Farquhar's own heedless turn for gallantry would be likely to throw him upon such a character ; and his goodness of heart and sincerity of disposition would teach him to expose its wanton duplicity and gilded rottenness. Lurewell is almost as abandoned a character as Olivia, in the \" Plain Dealer ; \" but the indignation excited against her is of a less serious and tragic cast. Her peevish disgust and affected horror at everything that comes near her, form a very edifying picture. Her dissatisfaction and ennui are not mere airs and graces worn for fashion's sake ; hut are real and tormenting inmates of her breast, arising from a surfeit of pleasure and the consciousness of guilt. All that is hateful in the caprice, ill-humour, spite, hauteur, folly, impudence, and affectation, of the complete woman of quality, is contained in the scene between her and her servants in the first act. The depravity would be intolerable, even in imagination, if the weakness were not ludicrous in the extreme. It shows, in the highest degree, the power of circumstances and example to pervert the understanding, the imagination, and even the senses. The manner in which the character of the gay, wild, free-hearted, but not altogether profligate or unfeeling Sir Harry Wildair, is played off against the designing, vindictive, imperious, uncontrollable, and unreasonable humours of Lurewell, in the scene where she tries to convince him of his wife's infidelity, while he stops his cars to her pretended proofs, is not surpassed in modern comedy. 1 shall give it here : \" Wildair. Now, dear madam, I have secured my brother, you have disposed of the colonel, and we'll rail at love till we ha'n't a word more to say. Lurewell. Ay, sir Harry. Please to sit a little, sir. You must know I'm in a strange humour of asking you some questions. How did you like your lady, pray, sir? Wild. Like her ! ha ! ha ! ha ! So very well, faith, that for her sake I'm in love with every woman I meet. Lure. And did matrimony please you extremely ? Wild. So very much, that if polygamy were allowed, I would have a new wife every day. Lure. Oh, sir Harry ! this is raillery. But your serious thoughts upon the matter, pray. Wild. Why, then, madam, to give you my true sentiments of wedlock : I had a lady that I married by chance, she was virtuous by chance, and I loved her by great chance. Nature gave her beauty, education an air; and fortune threw a young fellow of five-and- twenty in her lap. I courted her all day, loved her all night ; she was my mistress one day, and my wife another: I found in one the variety of a thousand, and the very confinement of marriage gave me the pleasure of change. Lwre. And she was very virtuous. Wild. Look ye, madam, you know she was beautiful. She had good-nature about her mouth, the smile of beauty in her cheeks, sparkling wit in her forehead, and sprightly love in her eyes. Lure. Pshaw ! I knew her very well ; the woman was well enough But you don't answer my question, sir. Wild. So, madam, as I told you before, she was young and beautiful, I was rich and vigorous ; my estate gave a lustre to my love, and a swing to our enjoyment ; round, like the ring that made us one, our golden pleasures circled without end. Lure. Golden pleasures ! Golden fiddlesticks. What d'ye tell me of your canting stuff ? Was she virtuous, I say ? Wild.

Look ye, sir, answer my question, or I shall take it ill. Wild. Then, madam, there never was such a pattern of unity. Her wants were still prevented by my supplies ; my own heart whispered me her desires, 'cause she herself was there ; no contention ever rose, but the dear strife of who should most oblige : no noise about authority; for neither would stoop to command, 'cause both thought it glory to obey. Lure. Stuff! stuff! stuff! I won't believe a word on't. Wild. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Then, madam, we never felt the yoke of matrimony, because our inclinations made us one; a power superior to the forms of wedlock.

Yes, sir ; 'tis an affront to any woman to hear another commended ; and I will resent it. \u2014 In short sir Harry, your wife was a \u2014 Wild, Buz, madam \u2014 no detraction.

So much an angel in her conduct, that though I saw another in her arms, I should have thought the devil had raised the phantom, and my more conscious reason had given my eyes the lie. Lure.

I burst with malice, and now he won't mind me ! Won't you hear me yet ? Wild. No, no, madam. Lure. Nay, then, I can't bear it. \u2014 [Bursts out a crying.] Sir, I must say that you're an unworthy person to use a woman of quality at this rate, when she has her heart full of malice ; I don't know but it may make me miscarry. Sir, I say again and again, that she was no better than one of us, and I know it ; I have seen it with my eyes, so I have. Wild. Good heavens deliver me, I beseech thee. How Bhall I 'scape ! Lure. Will you hear me yet ? Dear sir Harry, do but hear me ; I'm longing to speak. Wild. Oh! I have it. \u2014 Hush, hush, hush. Lure. Eh ! what's the matter? Wild. A mouse ! a mouse ! a mouse ! Lure.

The \" Beaux' Stratagem \" is the best of his plays, as a whole ; infinitely lively, bustling, and full of point and"], [91, "WYCHERLEY, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, AND FARQUHAR. lxxxi interest. The assumed disguise of the two principal characters, Archer and Aimwell, is a perpetual amuse ment to the mind. Scrub is an indispensable appendage to a country gentleman's kitchen, and an exquisite confidant for the secrets of young ladies. The \" Recruiting Officer\" is not one of Farquhar's best comedies, though it is light and entertaining. It contains chiefly sketches and hints of characters ; and the conclusion of the plot is rather lame. He informs us, in the dedication to the published play, that it was founded on some local and personal circumstances that happened in Shropshire, where he was himself a recruiting officer; and it seems not unlikely, that most of the scenes actually took place at the foot of the Wrekin. The \" Inconstant\" is much superior to it. The romantic interest and impressive catastrophe of this play I thought had been borrowed from the more poetical and tragedy-practised muse of Beaumont and Fletclicr: but I find they are taken from an actual circumstance which took place in the author's knowledge, at Paris. His other pieces, \" Love and a Bottle,\" and \" The Twin Rivals,\" are not on a par with these ; and are no longer in possession of the stage. The public are, after all, not the worst judges.\u2014 Farquhar's Letters, prefixed to the collection of his plays, are lively, good-humoured, and sensible ; and contain, among other things, an admirable exposition of the futility of the dramatic unities of time and place. This criticism preceded Dennis's remarks on that subject, in his Strictures on Mr. Addison's Cato ; and completely anticipates all that Dr. Johnson has urged so unanswerably on the subject, in his preface to Shakspeare. We may date the decline of English comedy from the time of Farquhar. For this several causes might be assigned in the political and moral changes of the times ; but among other minor ones, Jeremy Collier, in his View of the English Stage, frightened the poets, and did all he could to spoil the stage, by pretending to reform it ; that is, by making it an echo of the pulpit, instead of a reflection of the manners of the world. He complains bitterly of the profaneness of the stage ; and is for fining the actors for every oath they utter, to put an end to the practice ; as if common swearing had been an invention of the poets and stage-players. He cannot endure that the fine gentlemen drink, and the fine ladies intrigue, in the scenes of Congreve and Wycherley, when things so contrary to law and gospel happened nowhere else. He is vehement against duelling, as a barbarous custom, of which the example is suffered with impunity nowhere but on the stage. He is shocked at the number of fortunes that are irreparably ruined by the vice of gaming on the boards of the theatres. He seems to think that every breach of the ten commandments b.gins and ends there. He complains that the tame husbands of his time are laughed at on the stage, and that the successful gallants triumph, which was without precedent either in the city or the court. He does not think it enough that the Btage \" shows vice its own image, scorn its own feature,\" unless they are damned at the same instant, and carried off (like Don Juan) by real devils to the infernal regions, before the faces of the spectators. It seems that the author would have been contented to be present at a comedy or a farce, like a father Inquisitor, if there was to be an auto da fe at the end, to burn both the actors and the poet. This sour, non-juring critic has a great horror and repugnance at poor human nature, in nearly all its shapes ; of the existence of which he appears only to be aware through the stage : and this he considers as the only exception to the practice of piety, and the performance of the whole duty of man ; and seems fully convinced, that if this nuisance were abated, the whole world would be regulated according to the creed and the catechism. \u2014 \u25a0 This is a strange blindness and infatuation ! He forgets, in his over-heated zeal, two things : First, That the stage must be copied from real life, that the manners represented there must exist elsewhere, and \" denote a foregone conclusion,\" to satisfy common sense. \u2014 Secondly, That the stage cannot shock common decency, according to the notions that prevail of it in any age or country, because the exhibition is public. If the pulpit, for instance, had banished all vice and imperfection from the world, as our critic would suppose, we should not have seen the offensive reflection of them on the stage, which he resents as an affront to the cloth, and an outrage on religion. On the contrary, with such a sweeping reformation as this theory implies, the office of the preacher, as well as of the player, would be gone ; and if common peccadilloes of lying, b wearing, intriguing, fighting, drinking, gaming, and other such obnoxious dramatic common-places, were once fairly got rid of in reality, neither the comic poet would be able to laugh at them on the stage, nor our good-natured author to consign them over to damnation elsewhere. The work is, however, written with ability, and did much mischief: it produced those do-me-good, lack-a-daisical, whining, make-believe comedies in the next age, (such as Steele's \" Conscious Lovers,\" and others,) which are enough to set one to sleep, and where the author tries in vain to be merry and wise in the same breath ; in which the utmost stretch of licentiousness goes no farther than the gallant's being suspected of keeping a mistress, and the highest proof of courage is given in his lefusing to accept a challenge. In looking into the old editions of the comedies of the last age, I find the names of the best actors of those times, of whom scarcely any record is left but in Colley Cibber's Life, and the monument to Mis."], [92, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. lxxxii Oldfield, in Westminster Abbey ; which Voltaire reckons among the proofs of the liberality, wisdom, and politeness of the English nation Let no rude hand deface it.

PASSAGES FROM THE \"ATHEN\u00c6UM\" OF JANUARY -2, 1841, Referred to at p. x. \" Some attempts have been made to reduce to chronological order the dramatic works of William Wycherley. * The chronology of Wycherley's plays (said Pope to Spence), I was well acquainted with ; for he has told it me over and over. \" Love in a Wood\" he wrote when he was but nineteen : \" The Gentleman Dancing- Master\" at twenty-one ; \" The Plain Dealer\" at twenty-five ; and \" The Country Wife\" at one or two and thirty.' If this was the case, the dates when they were written would be 1 659, 1661, 1665, and 1 671, while the presumed years of their appearance on the stage are 1672, 1673, 1677, and 1673, ' The Plain Dealer* being the last. The truth is, that ' Love in a Wood,' if written in 1659, must have been enlarged in after years, for there are two distinct references in Acts I. and III. to the Great Fire of 1666; and hence we presume the propriety of Rochester's epithet of slow Wycherley, which Lord Lansdowne said was untrue, and Pope denied in prose and sanctioned in verse. That it appeared on the stage after May, 1669, when Pepys's Diary ends, there can be little doubt, for there is no mention of it in Pepys, who seldom missed a new play, and would surely have attended the representation of a piece, had it been acted, which was publicly counte nanced by the Duchess of Cleveland, about whom he has shown at all times more than usual curiosity. The date of * The Gentleman Dancing-Master' may be ascertained, which no one has hitherto observed, from the prologue ' addressed to the City newly after the Removal of the Duke's Company from Lincoln's Inn Fields to their new Theatre near Salisbury Court,' which would fix the date shortly after the 9th of November, 1671 the opening night of the New Theatre. But the puzzle to us has always been with ' The Plain Dealer,' which is stated to have been written and acted prior to ' The Country Wife,' though, curiously enough, one of the best scenes in ' The Plain Dealer,' is that where Olivia makes an attack on ' The Country Wife,' as it was lately acted : \u2014 ' That filthy play,' as she calls it, ' and its beastly author,' which argues a priority of appearance for ' The Country Wife,' or an after-insertion of the whole scene. Mr. Hunt has not alluded to this difficulty, but it merits remark, and required explanation. Whilst on dates connected with Wycherley, let us mention that his marriage, which Mr. Hunt would assign to the year 1677, we would place a little later than tho 18th of June 1679, the day on which the Countess of Drogheda became a widow. At first sight the Earl's death seems a very necessary event, unless the Countess made a queer second marriage, as did Wycherley himself. \" In the number of our poets on whom fortune has shone more kindly than is her wont, Congreve appears to have been among the most fortunate ; and to have held not ' one poor office,' as Swift has said, but a plurality of offices. Mr. Hunt, however, who has had an eye (not always a clear one) to the discovery of additional truths, ' however small,' he says, ' or collateral in their interest,' takes Swift ' to have been in the right as to the fact of the single office,' for 'Congreve's receipts from his various places,' he writes, ' have been usually huddled together, as though Halifax had given them all, and at once. Probably they did all come from him, or through him ; but it is certain our author was not made a Commissioner of Wine Licences till the November of 1 714. His richest appointment, that of Secretary for Jamaica, followed in the course of the next month ; Halifax died the May ensuing.' This is incorrect ; for in 1711, he was, as we learn from Boyer one of the Commissioners for Wine Licences, and in November 1714 he was made, as we gathei from the same"], [93, "WYCHERLEY, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, AND FARQUHAR. Ixxxiii accurate chronicler of passing events, one of the Searchers of the Customs, in the room of Thomas Walker. Dates are necessary landmarks ; and though, as it has been said with truth, they may be left to inferior minds, yet it is not for genius to neglect such minute particulars as have been provided for their adoption by the humble pioneers of biographical history. A trifling error in time may destroy a whole chain of reasoning; a difference of a year, suggest a new train of thought ; and if dates are given, they should be given correctly, for it is not every work that will stand, like the Lives of Johnson, on the knowledge they exhibit of human life, in spite of all their writer's inaccuracies, and the frequent error and ill taste of his criticism ; or, like Hume's History, upon its philosophy and language. A few dates have overthrown the famous Summary of Sir William Blackstone, in his well-known paper of Addison v. Pope. \"It is reasonable curiosity that prompts men to inquire into the history of works that afford them pleasure ; to hear what others think of them, and to learn the story of their first reception. We could not know too much of the sale of * Paradise Lost,' what critics at coffee-houses said, or ladies thought \u2014 if they thought at all ; and with what in terest should we ponder over a series of newspaper paragraphs, that told us how 4 Hamlet ' and ' Othello,' 'The Tempest' and ' Richard HI.,' 'The Alchemist' and ' The Fox,' were received by the gallants that crowded the stage and boxes at Blackfriars, the Globe, the Curtain, or the Rose. Something of this interest extends to the plays before us ; they have stood beyond their century, and are among the classic comedies of our country. Irreverence or ignorance alone will affect to slight them, while the true relisher of English wit and native humour will always admire their racy richness. We wish that Mr. Hunt had entered a little more into this subject ; it is of but few of the plays, unfortunately, that there is anything to tell, but what there is should have been told ; and he has missed the history of Congreve's ' Double Dealer,' as it is related by a first-rate witness t \u2014 ' Congreve's Double Dealer is much censured,' writes Dryden to Walsh, ' by the greater part of the town, and is defended only by the best judges, who, you know, are commonly the fewest. Yet it gains ground daily, and has already been acted eight times. The women think he has exposed , and the gentlemen are offended with him for the discovery of their follies, and the way of their intrigue under the notions of friendship to their ladies' husbands.' \" Among the Curiosities of Literature, D'lsraeli has an entertaining chapter on the ' Ignorance of the Learned ; ' he might have extended bis essay to instances illustrative of writers who fly to hidden sources for information, and gather little there, while they overlook the commoner and better books that would have supplied them with much of the material they had fruitlessly sought in neglected writers. Every biographer of Vanbrugh gives the history of his house, \u2014 ' In shape resembling a goose pie,' and quotes the caustic and amusing verses of Swift, but all omit to tell us wnat Vanbrugh thought of the merriment at his expense, though told in so common a book as his Journal to Stella. ' I dined to-day,' he writes, 7th November, 1710, 'at Sir Richard Temple's, with Congreve, Vanbrugh, &c. Vanbrugh, I believe I told you, had a long quarrel with me about those verses ou his house, but we were very civil and cold. Lord Marlborongh used to teaze him with them, which had made him angry, though he be a good-natured fellow.' Had this occurred to Mr. Hunt, we are sure it would have found a place, and received a comment, in his memoir. ****** \" Farquhar's plays had been the making of Wilks ; and that Wilks was neglectful of the trust reposed in him, is the belief of Mr. Hunt, who is, we think, unjust throughout his work to the memory of that excellent actor. Let us inquire into this : Wilks was in Dublin when Farquhar's first play appeared in London ; he could not, therefore, have acted in it, or by declining to venture in a part untried and of which the success was uncertain, have exhibited any portion of that worldly prudence of which Mr. Hunt accuses him ; and, curious enough, it is pretty well ascertained that Roebuck, in ' Love in a Bottle,' was the character in which Wilks made his first appearance before a London audience. Through the intercession of Wilks. a benefit was obtained (25th of May, 1708) for the poet's widow ; and the following document will show that after the lapse of many years he had not forgotten Farquhar's bequest : \"'George R. '\"Whereas on Our present Establishment of Pensions payable by you, there is inserted one annuity or yearly pension of Twenty Pounds payable to Edmund Chaloner for Farquhar's Children, which said Edmund Chaloner being lately dead, Our Will and Pleasure is, and We do hereby direct, authorise, and command you"], [94, "BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES. lxxxiv to pay the said annual pension of Twenty Pounds and all arrears thereof unto Robert Wilks, of King-street, Covent-garden, for the use of the said children. And for so doing this shall be your Warrant. Given at our Court at Herenhausen, the 9th of September, 1719, O.S.,in the sixth year of our Reign. \" ' By His Majesty's Command, \" * SUNOERLANO. \" ' J. Al-LASIE. \" ' To oar trusty and well-beloved Walter Chetwynd, Esq.' \" ' Gf.o. Baillie.' \" Their names were Anne Margueritte and Mary. The younger was alive in 1742, the elder in 1764, and in the receipt of her own and her sister's portion of the pension. \" Farquhar's last play was ' The Stratagem,' or as it is printed * The Beaux' Stratagem,' of which he did not live to enjoy the full success. The story is a painful one. Farquhar's life had been a struggle against Fortune; his marriage increased the struggle, for he was in debt. It was at this time he applied to the Duke of Ormond, whose encouragement of ' The Recruiting Officer,* he acknowledges, in his dedication, as a powerful help to its good fortune on the stage. The Duke advised him to sell his commission in the army, and pay his debts, and promised him a Captaincy then vacant in his own regiment. Farquhar sold his commission, but the Duke either forgot, or was unable to fulfil his promise. It was in this state of affliction that he was found, after several days' absence, by his old friend Wilks. Wilks, it is told, advised him to write, and depend altogether upon authorship for subsistence : ' Is it possible,' said Farquhar, starting from his chair, ' that a man can write common sense who is heart-broken aud without a shilling?' Wilks, with the noblest generosity, gave him twenty guineas from his own pocket. This circumstance has escaped the observation of Mr. Hunt. But to continue : ' The Stratagem' was the work of six weeks, produced in ill health \u2014 in disappointment \u2014 in want. Yet such was his reputation, that Lintot doubled (27th of January, 1706-7) the copy-money from 151., his usual price for a play, to 30.., and paid it in advance. This kindness was to little purpose. Farquhar felt the hand of death upon him before he had finished the second act, aud spoke of his own life as of shorter duration than the run of his play. Nor was he wrong : * The Stratagem ' appeared at the Haymarket on Saturday, 8th of March, 1707, found considerable favour, lived a third night for the author's benefit, and long enough to allow of an extra benefit on Tuesday the 29th of April. But on that day Farquhar died. Wycherley had retired from the stage before Farquhar was born, and yet Wycherley survived him. ' Oh ! why has worth so short a date ? ' will be the exclamation of many who read the memoirs before us. a In discovering the details of Farquhar's life, in reconciling dates, and adjusting minute events, Mr. Hunt, as we have said before, has not been successful. He has made, however, an agreeable addition to our collection of Farquhar's works, and freed him from a charge of plagiarism, made by men who know more of catalogues, title-pages, and editions, than the contents of the books they talk about. But what Mr. Hunt has failed in doing, we have the means before us of assisting to adjust. Farquhar's first play was, as Mr. Hunt says, well received ; but he has omitted to mention what Farquhar himself complains of in a letter to Mrs. Cockburn, that it had been scandalously abused for affronting the ladies. Collier's book was then newly out, and the ladies were alive to find fault with smaller aspersions than they had before endured. ' The Twin Rivals' appeared in 1705, says Mr. Hunt, who follows the received authorities; but how, let us ask, is this to be reconciled with the date attached to the Dedication, 23rd of December, 1702, and with the fact that the Preface speaks of its success on the stago ? But, to proceed, we discover from the papers of the day, that the first night of < The Recruiting Officer* was Monday the 8th of April, 1706, and from Lintot's account of Copies when Purchased, we leam the rewards that Farquhar received for his literary labours. On the 3rd of July, 1701, Lintot paid him SI. As. 6c.., or three guineas of the then money, for his letters, (the volume entitled 'Love and Business'); on the 22nd of December, 1702 (the day previous to the dedication), he paid him 151. for ' The Twin Rivals;' and on the 12th of February, 1705-6, fifteen guineas, or 16.. 2s. 6c.., for 'The Recruiting Officer.* These, in our opinion, are interesting facts in Farquhar's life ; fifteen guineas was then the usual price of plays, though thirty pounds was, as we have seen, the sum paid for ' The Beaux' Stratagem,' and the amount received by Dryden in 1692, from Tonson, for his 1 Cleomenes.'\" * * * * * *"], [95, "THE DRAMATIC WORKS OP WILLIAM WYCHERLEY.

Madam, \u2014 All authors whatever in their dedication are poets ; but I am now to write to a lady who stands as little in need of flattery, -as her beauty of art ; otherwise I should prove as ill a poet to her in my dedication, as to my reader in my play. I can do your Grace no honour, nor make you more admirers than you have already ; yet I can do myself the honour to let the world know I am the greatest you have. You will pardon me, Madam, for you know it is very hard for a new author, and poet too, to govern his ambition : for poets, let them pass in the world ever so much for modest, honest men, but begin praise to others which concludes in themselves ; and are like rooks, who lend people money but to win it back again, and so leave them in debt to 'em for nothing ; they offer laurel and incense to their heroes, but wear it themselves, and perfume themselves. This is true, Madam, upon the honest word of an author who never yet writ dedication. Yet though I cannot lie like them, I am as vain as they ; and cannot but publicly give'your Grace my humble acknowledgments for the favours I have received from you : \u2014 this, I say, is the poet's gratitude, which, in plain English, ie only pride and ambition ; and that the world might know your Grace did me the honour to see my play twice together. Yet, perhaps, my enviers of your favour will suggest 'twas in Lent, and therefore for your mortification. Then, as a jealous author, I am concerned not to have your Grace's favours lessened, or rather my reputation ; and to let them know, you were pleased, after that, to command a copy from me of this play ; \u2014 the only way, without beauty and wit, to win a poor poet's heart. 'Tis a sign your Grace understands nothing better than obliging all the world after the best and most proper manner. But, Madam, to be obliging to that excess as you are (pardon me, if I tell you, out of my extreme concern and service for your Grace) is a dangerous quality, and may be very incommode to you ; for civility makes poets as troublesome, as charity makes beggars; and your Grace will be hereafter as much pestered with such scurvy offerings as this, poems, panegyrics, and the like, as you are now with petitions : and, Madam, take it from me, no man with papers in *s hand is more dreadful than a poet ; no, not a lawyer with hia declarations. Your Grace sure did not well consider what ye did, in sending for my play : you little thought I would have had the confidence to send you a dedication too But, Madam, you find I am as unreasonable, and have as little conscience, as if I had driven the poetic trade longer than I have, and ne'er consider you had enough of the play. But (having suffered now so severely) I beseech your Grace, have a care for the future ; take my counsel, and be (if you can possible) as proud and ill-natured as other people of quality, since your quiet is bo much concerned, and since you have more reason than any to value yourself : \u2014 for you have that perfection of beauty (without thinking it so) which others of your sex but think they have ; that generosity in your actions which others of your quality have only in their promises ; that spirit, wit and judgment, and all other qualifications which fit heroes to command, and would make any but your Grace proud. I begin now, elevated by my subject, to write with the emotion and fury of a poet, yet the integrity of an historian ; and I could never be weary\u2014 nay, sure this were my only way to make my readers never weary too, though they were a more impatient generation of people than they are. In fine, speaking thus of your Grace, I should please all the world but you ; therefore I must once observe and obey you against my will, and say no more, than that I am, Madam, your Grace's most obliged, and most humble servant, WILLIAM WYCHERLEY.

If nobody were wiser than I, I should think, since the widow wants the natural allure ment which the virgin has, you ought to give men all other encouragements, in truly. Flip. Therefore, on the contrary, because the widow's fortune (whether supposed or real) is her chiefest bait, the more chary she seems of it, and the more she withdraws it, the more eagerly the busy gaping fry will bite. With us widows, hus bands are got like bishopricks, by saying No: and I tell you, a young heir is as shy of a widow as of a rook, to my knowledge. Joyn. I can allege nothing against your practice \u2014 but your ill success ; and indeed you must use another method with sir Simon Addleplot. Flip. Will he be at your house at the hour ? Joyn.

Thou ait no child of mine, if thou dost not hate bishops and wits. \u2014 Well, Mrs. Joyner, I'll keep you no longer. [To Addi.eplot.] Jonas, wait on Mrs. Joyner. Joyn. Good night to your worship. Gripe. But stay, stay, Mrs. Joyner : have you spoken with the widow Crossbite about her little daughter, as I desired ? Joyn. With your worship's pardon, in truly, I must own. Gripe.

Well, I will throw off Dapperwit's acquaintance when I am married, and will only be a cully to my wife j and that's no more than the wisest husband of 'em all is. Joyn. Then you think you shall carry Mrs. Martha ? Joyn. Good gentleman. {.Exeunt Gripe and Martha. Sir Sim. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Mrs. Joyner. Joyn. What's the matter, sir Simon ? Sir Sim. Ha ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 let us make haste to Sir Sim. Your hundred guineas are as good as in your lap. Joyn. But I am afraid this double plot of yours should fail : you would sooner succeed if you only designed upon Mrs. Martha, or only upon my lady Flippant. Sir Sim. Nay, then, you are no woman of intrigue, faith and troth: 'tis good to have two strings to one's bow. If Mrs. Martha be coy, I tell the widow I put on my disguise for her ; but if Mrs. Martha be kind to Jonas, sir Simon Addleplot will be false to the widow : which is no more than widows are used to ; for a promise to a widow is as seldom kept as a vow made at sea, as Dapperwit says. your house, or I shall burst, faith and troth, to see what fools you and I make of these people. Joyn. I will not rob you of any of the credit : \u2014 I am but a feeble instrument, you are an engineer. Sir Sim. Remember what you say now when things succeed, and do not tell me then, \u2014 I must thank your wit for all. Joyn. No, in truly, sir Simon. Sir Sim. Nay, I am sure Dapperwit and I have been partners in many an intrigue, and he uses to serve me so. Joyn. He is an ill man to intrigue with, as you call it. Joyn. I am afraid they should discover you. Sir Sim. You have nothing to fear ; you have your twenty guineas in your pocket for helping me into my service, and if I get into Mrs. Martha's quarters, you have a hundred more ; if into the widow's, fifty: \u2014 happy go lucky ! Will her ladyship be at your house at the hour ? Joyn. Yes. Sir Sim. Then you shall see when I am sir Simon Addleplot and myself I'll look like myself ; now I am Jonas, I look like an ass. You never thought sir Simon Addleplot could have looked so like an ass by his ingenuity. Joyn. Pardon me, sir Simon. Sir Sim. Nay, do not flatter, faith and troth. Joyn. Come let us go, 'tis time. Sir Sim. I will carry the widow to the French house. Sir Sim. Ay, so are all your wits ; a pox 1 if a man's understanding be not so public as theirs, he cannot do a wise action but they go away with the honour of it, if he be of their acquaintance. Joyn. Why do you keep such acquaintance then 2 Sir Sim. There is a proverb, Mrs. Joyner, You may know him by his company. Joyn. No, no, to be thought a man of parts, you must always keep company with a man of less wit than yourself. Sir Sim. That's the hardest thing in the world for me to do, faith and troth. Joyn. What, to find a man of less wit than your self ? Pardon my raillery, sir Simon. Sir Sim. No, no, I cannot keep company with a fool : \u2014 I wonder how men of parts can do't, there's something in't. Joyn. If you could, all your wise actions would be your own, and your money would be your own too. Joyn. If she will go. Sir Sim. If she will go! why, did you ever know a widow refuse a treat ? no more than a lawyer a fee, faith and troth : yet I know too \u2014 No treat, sweet words, good mien, but sly intrigue, That must at length the jilting widow segue. {Exeunt. Sir Sim. Nay, faith and troth, that's true ; for your wits are plaguily given to borrow. They'll borrow of their wench, coachman, or linkboy, their hire, Mrs. Joyner ; Dapperwit has that trick with a vengeance. Joyn. Why will you keep company with him then, I say ? for, to be plain with you, you have followed him so long, that you are thought but his cully ; for every wit has his cully, as every squire his led captain. Sir Sim. I his cully, I his cully, Mrs. Joyner ! Lord, that I should be thought a cully to any wit breathingl Joyn. Nay, do not take it so to heart, for the best wits of the town are but cullies them selves. SCENE II.\u2014 The French. House. A Table, Wine, and Candles. Enter Vincent, Ranger, and Dapperwit. Dap. Pray, Mr. Ranger, let's have no drinking to-night. Vin. Pray, Mr. Ranger, let's have no Dapper wit to-night. Ran. Nay, nay, Vincent. Vin. A pox ! I hate his impertinent chat more than he does the honest Burgundy. Dap. But why should you force wine upon us ? we are not all of your gusto. Vin. But why should you force your chawed jests, your damned ends of your mouldy lampoons, and last year's sonnets, upon us ? we are not all of your gusto. Dap. The wine makes me sick, let me perish! Vin. Thy rhymes make me spew. Ran. At repartee already ! Come. Vincent. I know you would rather have him pledge you: here, Sir Sim. To whom, to whom, to whom, Mrs. Joyner ? Joyn. To sempstresses and bawds. Sir Sim. To your knowledge Mrs. Joyner [Aside.] There I was with her. Joyn. To tailors and vintners, but especially to the French houses. Sir Sim. But Dapperwit is a cully to none of them ; for he ticks. Joyn. I care not, but I wish you were a cully to none but me j that's all the hurt I wish you."], [101, "LOVE IN A WOOD; OR, ST. JAMES'S PARK. SCENE II. 7 Dapperwit \u2014 [Gives him the glass.] \u2014 But why are you so eager to have him drink always ? Vin. Because he is so eager to talk always, and there is no other way to silence him. Vin. Detracting fop ! when did you see him de sert his friend ? Dap. You have a rough kind of a raillery, Mr. Vincent ; but since you will have it, (though I love the man heartily, I say,) he deserted me once in breaking of windows, for fear of the constables \u2014 Enter Waiter. Wait. Here is a gentleman desires to speak with Mr. Vincent. Re-enter Ranger. Vin. I come. {Exit Vincent with Waiter. Dap. He may drink, because he is obliged to the bottle for all the wit and courage he has ; 'tis not free and natural like yours. Ran. He has more courage than wit, but wants neither. But you need not take notice to him of what I tell you ; I hate to put a man to the blush. Ran. I have had just now a visit from my mis tress, who is as jealous of me as a wife of her hus band when she lies in : \u2014 my cousin Lydia, \u2014 you have heard me speak of her. Vin. But she is more troublesome than a wife that lies in, because she follows you to your haunts. Why do you allow her that privilege before her time ? Ran. Faith, I may allow her any privilege, and be too hard for her yet. How do you think I have cheated her to -night ? \u2014 Women are poor credulous creatures, easily deceived. Vin. We are poor credulous creatures, when we think 'em so. Dap. As a pump gone dry, if you pour no water down you will get none out, so \u2014 Ran. Nay, I bar similes too, to-night. Dap. Why, is not the thought new ? don't you apprehend it ? Ran. Yes, yes, but \u2014 Dap. Well, well, will you comply with his sot tishness too, and hate brisk things in complaisance to the ignorant dull age ? I believe shortly 'twill be as hard to find a patient friend to communicate one's wit to, as a faithful friend to communicate Ran. Intending a ramble to St. James's Park to-night, upon some probable hopes of some fresh game I have in chase, I appointed her to stay at home ; with a promise to come to her within this hour, that she might not spoil the scent and prevent my sport. one's secret to. Wit has as few true judges as painting, I see. Ran. All people pretend to be judges of both. Dap. Ay, they pretend ; but set you aside, and one or two more \u2014 Ran. But why, has Vincent neither courage nor wit? Vin. She'll be even with you when you are mar ried, I warrant you. In the mean time here's her health, Dapperwit. Ran. Now had he rather be at the window, writing her anagram in the glass with his diamond, or biting his nails in the corner for a fine thought to come and divert us with at the table. Dap. He has no courage, because he beat his wench for giving me les douces yeux once ; and no wit, because he does not comprehend my thoughts ; and he is a son of a whore for his ignorance. I take ignorance worse from any man than the lie, because 'tis as much as to say I am no wit. Dap. No, a pox ! I have no wit to-night. I am as barren and hide-bound as one of your damned scribbling poets, who are sots in company for all their wit ; as a miser is poor for all his money. How do you like the thought ? Vin. Drink, drink ! Dap. Well, I can drink this, because 1 shall be reprieved presently. Vin. Who will he so civil to us ? Re-enter Vincent. You need not take any notice, though, to him what I say. Vin. Ranger, there is a woman below in a coach would speak with you. Ran. With me ? {Exit Ranger. Dap. This Ranger, Mr. Vincent, is as false to his friend as his wench. Dap. Sir Simon Addleplot : \u2014 I have bespoke him a supper here, for he treats to-night a new rich mistress. Vin. You have no reason to say so, but because he is absent. Dap, 'Tis disobliging to tell a man of his faults to his face. If he had but your grave parts and manly wit, I should adore him ; but, a pox ! he is a mere buffoon, a jack-pudding, let me perish ! Vin. You are an ungrateful fellow. I have heard him maintain you had wit, which was more than e'er you could do for yourself. \u2014 I thought you had owned him your M\u00e6cenas. Dap. A pox I he cannot but esteem me, 'tis for his honour ; but I cannot but be just for all that \u2014 without favour or affection. Yet I confess I love him so well, that I wish he had but the hundredth part of your courage. Ran. That spark, who has his fruitless designs upon the bed-ridden rich widow, down to the suck ing heiress in her pissing-clout. He was once the sport, but now the public grievance, of all the for tunes in town ; for he watches them like a younger brother that is afraid to be mumped of his snip, and they cannot steal a marriage, nor stay their stomachs, but he must know it. Dap. He has now pitched his nets for Gripe's daughter, the rich scrivener, and serves him as a clerk to get admission to her ; which the watchful fop her father denies to all others. Ran. I thought you had been nibbling at her once, under pretence of love to her aunt. Dap. I confess I have the same design yet, and Addleplot is but my agent whilst he thinks me his. He brings me letters constantly from her, and car ries mine back. Vin. He has had the courage to save you from many a beating, to my knowledge. Dap. Come, come, I wish the man well, and, next to you, better than any man ; and, I am sorry to say it, he has not courage to snuff a candle with his fingers. When he is drunk, indeed, he dares get a clap, or so \u2014 and swear at a constable. Vin. Still betraying your best friends ! Dap. I cannot in honour but betray him.

Vin. Is this the woman that we never saw! {Aside. Enter Sir Simon Addleplot with the Waiter. Flip. Does he bring us into company ! \u2014 and Dapperwit one ! Though I had married the fool, I thought to have reserved the wit as well as other ladies. {Aside. Sir Sim. Know 'em! you are a saucy Jack-straw to question me, faith and troth ; I know everybody, and everybody knows me. All. Sir Simon! Sir Simon ! Sir Simon ! Sir Sim. Nay, look as long as you will, madam, you will find them civil gentlemen, and good com pany. Flip. I am not in doubt of their civility, but yours. Joyn. You'll never leave snubbing your servants ! Did you not promise to use him kindly ? {Aside to Flippant. Ran. And you are a welcome man to every body. Sir Sim. Now, son of a whore, do I know the gentlemen ? \u2014 A dog ! would have had a shilling of me before he would let me come to you ! Ran. The rogue has been bred at court, sure. \u2014 Get you out, sirrah. lExit Waiter. Sir Sim. He has been bred at a French-house, where they are more unreasonable. Flip. [Aside to Joyner.] 'Tis true. \u2014 [Aloud.] We wanted no good company, sir Simon, as long as we had yours. Sir Sim. But they wanted good company, there fore I forced 'em to accept of yours. Flip. They will not think the company good they were forced into, certainly. Sir Sim. A pox ! I must be using the words in fashion, though I never have any luck with 'em. Mrs. Joyner, help me off. Joyn. I suppose, madam, he means the gentle men wanted not inclination to your company, hut confidence to desire so great an honour ; therefore he forced 'em. Vin. Here's to you, sir Simon. Sir Sim. I cannot drink, for I have a mistress within ; though I would not have the people of the house to know it. Ran. You need not be ashamed of your mis tresses, for they are commonly rich. Sir Sim. And because she is rich, I would con ceal her ; for I never had a rich mistress yet, but one or other got her from me presently, faith and troth. Ran. But this is an ill place to conceal a mis tress in ; every waiter is an intelligencer to your rivals. Sir Sim. I have a trick for that : \u2014 I'll let no waiters come into the room ; I'll lay the cloth myself rather. Ran. But who is your mistress ? Sir Sim. Your servant, \u2014 your servant, Mr. Ranger. Vin. Come, will you pledge me ? Sir Sim. No, I'll spare your wine, if you will spare me Dapperwit's company ; I came for that. Dap. What makes this bawd here ? Sure, mis tress, you bawds should be like the small cards, though at first you make up a pack, yet, when the play begins, you should be put out as useless. Joyn. Well, well, gibing companion : you would have the pimps kept in only ? you would so ? Vin. What, they are quarrelling '. Ran. Pimp and hawd agree now-a-days like doctor and apothecary. Sir Sim. Try, madam, if they are not civil gen tlemen : talk with 'em, while I go lay the cloth \u2014 no waiter comes here. \u2014 [Aside.] My mother used to tell me, I should avoid all occasions of talking before my mistress, because silence is a sign of love as well as prudence. {Lays the cloth. Flip. Methinks you look a little yellow on't, Mr. Dapperwit. I hope you do not censure me because you find me passing away a night with this fool : \u2014 he is not a man to be jealous of, sure. Dap. You are not a lady to be jealous of, sure. Flip. No, certainly. \u2014 But why do you look as if you were jealous then ? Dap. If I had met you in Whetstone's-park, with a drunken foot-soldier, I should not have been jealous of you. Flip. Fy, fy ! now you are jealous, certainly ; for people always, when they grow jealous, grow rude : \u2014 but I can pardon it since it proceeds fror_ love certainly. Dap. I am out of aU hopes to be rid of this eternal old acquaintance : when I jeer her, she thinks herself praised ; now I call her whore in plain English, she thinks I am jealous. {Aside. Flip. Sweet Mr. Dapperwit, be not so censo rious, (I speak for your sake, not my own,) for jealousy is a torment, but my honour cannot suf fer certainly. Vin. You do us a double favour, to take him and leave the wine. Sir Sim. Come, come, Dapperwit. Ran. Do not go, unless he will suffer us to see his mistress too. {Aside to Dapperwit. Sir Sim. Come, eome, man. Dap. Would you have me so uncivil as to leave my company? \u2014 they'll take it ill. Sir Sim. I cannot find her talk without thee. \u2014 Pray, gentlemen, persuade Mr. Dapperwit to go with me. Ran. We will not hinder him of better company. Dap. Yours is too good to be left rudely. Sir Sim. Nay, gentlemen, I would desire your company too, if you knew the lady. Dap. They know her as well as I ; you say I know her not. Sir Sim. You are not everybody. Ran. Perhaps we do know the lady, sir Simon. Sir Sim. You do not, you do not : none of you ever saw her in your lives ; \u2014 but if you could be secret, and civil \u2014 Ran. We have drunk yet but our bottle a-piece. Sir Sim. But will you be civil, Mr. Vincent ? Ran. He dares not look a woman in the face under three bottles. /Sir Sim. Come along then. But can you be"], [103, "LOVE IN A WOOD; OR, ST. JAMES'S PARK. SCENE II. 9 Dap. No, certainly ; but the greatest torment I have is\u2014 your love. Flip. Alas ! sweet Mr. Dapperwit, indeed love is a torment : but 'tis a sweet torment; but jealousy is a bitter torment. \u2014 I do not go about to cure you of the torment of my love. Dap. 'Tis a sign so. Flip. Come, come, look up, man ; is that a rival to contest with you ? Dap. I will contest with no rival, not with my old rival your coachman ; but they have heartily my resignation; and, to do you a favour, but myself a greater, I will help tie the knot you are fumbling for now, betwixt your cully here and you. Flip. Go, go, I take that kind of jealousy worst of all, to suspect I would be debauched to beastly matrimony. \u2014 But who are those gentlemen, pray ? are they men of fortunes, Mrs. Joyner ! Joyn. I believe so. Flip. Do you believe so, indeed? \u2014 Gentlemen \u2014 {Advancing towards Ranger and Vincent. Ran. As real as yours. Flip. If it were no more real than mine \u2014 {Aside. Ran. Your servant, madam. {Turns to go. Flip. But do you hate marriage certainly ? [Plucks him back. Ran. Certainly. Flip. Come, I cannot believe it : you dissemble it ouly because I pretend it. Ran. Do you but pretend it then, madam ? Flip. [Aside] I shall discover myself \u2014 [Aloud] I mean, because I hold against it, you do the same in complaisance : \u2014 for I have heard say, cunning men think to bring the coy and untractable women to tameness as they do some mad people \u2014 by humouring their frenzies. Ran. I am none of those cunning men, yet have too much wit to entertain the presumption of designing upon you. Flip. 'Twere no such presumption neither. Dap. Come away j 'sdeath ! don't you see your danger ? Ran. Those aims are for sir Simon. \u2014 Good night, madam. Ran. If the civility we owe to ladies had not controlled our envy to Mr. Dapperwit, we had interrupted ere this your private conversation. Flip. Your interruption, sir, had been most civil and obliging ; \u2014 for our discourse was of marriage. Ran. That is a subject, madam, as grateful as common. Flip. Willyou needs go, then? \u2014 [To Sir Simon] The gentlemen are a going, sir Simon; will you let 'em ? Sir Sim. Nay, madam, if you cannot keep 'em, how should I ? Flip. O fy, fy ! are you of that opinion too ? I cannot suffer any to talk of it in my company. Ran. Are you married then, madam ? Flip. No, certainly. Ran. I am sure so much beauty cannot despair of it. Flip. Stay, sir; because you hate marriage, I'll sing you a new song against it. {Sings. A spouse I do hate, For either she's false or she's jealous ; But give us a mate Flip. Despair of it ! \u2014 Ran. Only those that are married, or cannot be married, hate to hear of marriage. Flip. Yet you must know, sir, my aversion to marriage is such, that you, nor no man breathing, 6hall ever persuade me to it. Ran. Cursed be the man should do so rude a thing as to persuade you to anything against your inclination ! I would not do it for the world, Who nothing will ask us or tell us. She stands on no terms, Nor chaffers, hy way of indenture, Her love for your farms ; But takes her kind man at a venture. If all prove not right, Without an act, process, or warning, From wife for a night You may be divorced in the morning. madam. Flip. Come, come, though you seem to be a civil gentleman, I think you no better than your neighbours. I do not know a man of you all that will not thrust a woman up into a corner, and then talk an hour to her impertinently of marriage. Ran. You would find me another man in a cor ner, I assure you, madam ; for you should not have a word of marriage from me, whatsoever you might find in my actions of it ; I hate talking as much as you. When parents are slaves, Their brats cannot be any other ; Great wits and great braves Have always a punk to their mother. Though it be the fashion for women of quality to sing any song whatever, because the words are not distinguished, yet I should have blushed to have done it now, but for you, sir. Ran. The song is edifying, the voice admirable \u2014 and, once more, I am your servant, madam. Flip- What, will you go too, Mr. Dapperwit ? Sir Sim. Pray, Mr. Dapperwit, do not you go too. Flip. I hate it extremely. Ran. I am your man then, madam ; for I find just the same fault with your sex as you do with ours : \u2014 I ne'er could have to do with woman in my life, but still she would be impertinently talking of marriage to me. Flip. Observe that, Mrs. Joyner. Dap. Pray, Mr. Ranger, let's go ; I had rather drink with Mr. Vincent, than stay here with you ; besides 'tis Park-time. Ran. [To Dapperwit.] I come.\u2014 [To Flip pant.] Since you are a lady that hate marriage, I'll do you the service to withdraw the company j for those that hate marriage hate loss of time. Flip. Will you go then, sir ? but before you go, sir, pray tell me is your aversion to marriage real ? Dap. I am engaged. Sir Sim. Well, if we cannot have their company, we will not have their room : ours is a private back room ; they have paid their reckoning, let's go thither again. Flip. But pray, sweet Mr. Dapperwit, do not go. Keep him, Sir Simon. Sir Sim. I cannot keep him. [Exeunt Vincent, Ranger, and Dapperwit.

Hang me, if I am not pleased extremely with this new-fashioned caterwauling, this mid night coursing in the Park. Vin. A man may come after supper with his three bottles in his head, reel himself sober, with out reproof from his mother, aunt, or grave relation. Ran.

False Ranger, shall I find thee here ? {Aside. Vin. Those are women, are they not ? {To Dapperwit. Dap. The least seems to be my Lucy, sure. {Aside. Ran. And now no woman's modest or proud ; for her blushes are hid, and the rubies on her lips are died, and all sleepy and glimmering eyes have lost their attraction. Vin. Faith, I think I dare speak to a woman in the dark ! \u2014 let's try. Dap. They are persons of quality of my acquaint ance ; \u2014 hold ! Vin. Nay, if they are persons of quality of your acquaintance, I may be the bolder with 'em. {The ladies go off, they follow them. Vin. And now a man may carry a bottle under his arm instead of his hat ; \u2014 and no observing spruce fop will miss the cravat that lies on one's shoulder, or count the pimples on one's face. Dap. And now the brisk repartee ruins the complaisant cringe, or wise grimace. \u2014 Something 'twas, we men of virtue always loved the night. Ran. O blessed season ! Re-enter Lydia and my Lady Flippant.

I would not return another night, if it were to redeem my dear husband from his grave. Lyd. I believe you : \u2014 but to get another, widow. Flip. Another husband, another husband, foh ! Lyd. There does not pass a night here but many a match is made. Flip. That a woman of honour should have the word match in her mouth ! \u2014 but I hope, madam, the fellows do not make honourable love here, do they ? I abominate honourable love, upon my honour. Vin. For good-fellows. Ran. For lovers. Dap. And for the Muses. Ran. When I was a boy I loved the night so well, I had a strong vocation to be a bellman's apprentice. Vin. I, a drawer. Dap. And I, to attend the waits of Westmin ster, let me perish ! Ran. But why do we not do the duty of this and such other places ; \u2014 walk, censure, and speak ill of all we meet ? Dap. 'Tis no fault of mine, let me perish 1 Vin. Fy, fy ! satirical gentlemen, this is not your time ; you cannot distinguish a friend from a fop. Dap. No matter, no matter ; they will deserve amongst 'em the worst we can say. Ran. Who comes here, Dapperwit ? {People walking slowly over the stage. Dap.

But fortune will not see me want ; here comes a single bully, \u2014 I wish he may stand ; \u2014 For now a-nights the jostling nymph is bolder Than modern satyr with his cloak o'er shoulder. Well met, sir. {She puts on her mask. Flip. [Aside.] Oh rascal I he has heard some body else say all this of me. But I must not discover myself, lest I should be disappointed of my revenge ; for I will marry him. {The Musicians approaching, exit Flippant. Sir Sim. How shall I know that, forsooth? Who are you ? do you know me ? Flip. Who are you ? don't you know me ? Sir Sim. Not I, faith and troth! Flip. I am glad on't ; for no man e'er liked a woman the better for having known her before. Sir Sim. Ay, but then one can't be so free with a new acquaintance as with an old one ; she may deny one the civility. Flip. Not till you ask her. Sir Sim. But I am afraid to be denied. Sir Sim. What, gone! \u2014 come then, strike up, my lads. [Enter Men and women in vizards \u2014 a Dance, during which Addleplot, for the most part, stands still in a cloak and vizard ; but sometimes goes about peeping, and examining the women's clothes \u2014 the Dance ended, all exeunt. Re-enter Flippant and Lydia, after them Vincent and Dapperwit. Flip. Let me tell you, sir, you cannot lisoblige us women more than in distrusting us. Sir Sim. Pish ! what should one ask for, when you know one's meaning ? \u2014 but shall I deal freely with you ? Flip. I love, of my life, men should deal freely with me ; there are so few men will deal freely with one \u2014 Flip. [To Lydia.] Nay, if you stay any longer, I must leave you again. [Flippant going off. Vin. We have overtaken them at last again. These are they : they separate too ; and that's but a challenge to us. Dap. Let me perish ! ladies \u2014 Lyd. Nay good madam, let's unite, now here's the common enemy upon us. Vin. Damn me ! ladies \u2014 Sir Sim. Are you not a fireship, a punk, madam ? Flip. Well, sir, I love raillery. Sir Sim. Faith and troth, I do not rally, I deal freely. Flip. This is the time and place for freedom, sir. Sir Sim. Are you handsome ? Flip. Joan's as good as my lady in the dark, certainly : but men that deal freely never ask ques tions, certainly. Sir Sim. How then ! I thought to deal freely, and put a woman to the question, had been all one. Flip. But, let me tell you, those that deal freely indeed, take a woman by \u2014 Sir Sim. What, what, what, what ? Flip. By the hand \u2014 and lead her aside. Sir Sim. Now I understand you ; come along then. Dap. Hold, a pox ! you are too rough. \u2014 Let me perish ! ladies \u2014 Lyd. Not for want of breath, gentlemen : \u2014 we'll stay rather. Dap. For want of your favour rather, sweet ladies. Flip. [Aside.] That's Dapperwit, false villain ! but he must not know I am here. If he should, I should lose his thrice agreeable company, and he would run from me as fast as from the bailiffs. [To Lydia.] What ! you will not talk with 'em, I hope ? Lyd. Yes, but I will. Flip. Then you are a Park-woman, certainly ; and you will take it kindly if I leave you. Lyd. No, you must not leave me. Flip. Then you must leave them. Lyd. I'll see if they are worse company than you, first. Enter behind Musicians with torches. Flip. What unmannerly rascals are those that bring light into the Park ? 'twill not be taken well from 'em by the women, certainly. \u2014 [Aside.] Still disappointed ! Sir Sim. Oh, the fiddles, the fiddles ! I sent for them hither to oblige the women, not to offend 'em ; for I intend to serenade the whole Park to-night. But my frolic is not without an intrigue, faith and troth : for I know the fiddles will call the whole herd of vizard masks together ; and then shall I discover if a strayed mistress of mine be not amongst 'em, whom I treated to-night at the French-house ; but as soon as the jilt had eat up my meat and drunk her two bottles, she ran away from me, and left me alone. Flip. How ! is it he ! Addleplot ! \u2014 that I could not know him by his faith and troth ! {Aside. Sir Sim. Now I would understand her tricks ; because I intend to marry her, and should be glad to know what I must trust to. Flip. Monstrous impudence! \u2014 will you not come ? {Pulls Lydia. Vin. Nay, madam, I never suffer any violence to be used to a woman but what I do myself : she must stay, and you must not go. Flip. Unhand me, you rude fellow ! Vin. Nay, now I am sure you will stay and be kind ; for coyness in a woman is as little sign of true modesty, as huffing in a man is of true courage. Dap. Use her gently, and speak soft things to her. Lyd. [Aside.] Now I do guess I know my cox comb. \u2014 [ To Dapperwit.] Sir, I am extremely glad I am fallen into the hands of a gentleman that can speak soft things ; and this is so fine a night to hear soft things in ; \u2014 morning, I should have said. Dap. It will not be morning, dear madam, till"], [106, "LOVE IN A WOOD ; OR, ST.

Lyd. Now, what is the coffee-wit ? Dap. He is a lying, censorious, gossiping, quibbling wretch, and sets people together by the ears over that sober drink, coffee : he is a wit, as he is a commentator, upon the Gazette ; and he rails at the pirates of Algier, the Grand Signior of Constantinople, and the Christian Grand Signior. Lyd. What kind of wit is your poll-wit ? Dap. He is a fidgetting, busy, dogmatical, hot headed fop, that speaks always in sentences and proverbs, (as other in similitudes,) and he rails perpetually against the present government. His wit lies in projects and monopolies, and penning speeches for young parliament men. Lyd. But what is your chamber-wit, or scribble wit? Lyd. Indeed, dear sir, my face would frighten back the sun. Dap. With glories more radiant than his own : \u2014 [Aside.] I keep up with her, I think. Lyd. But why would you put me to the trouble of lighting the world, when I thought to have gone to sleep ? Dap. You only can do it, dear madam, let me perish ! Lyd. But why would you (of all men) practise treason against your friend Phoebus, and depose him for a mere stranger ? Dap. I think she knows me. {Aside. Lyd. But he does not do you justice, I believe ; and you are so positively cock-sure of your wit, you would refer to a mere stranger your plea to the bay-tree. Dap. She jeers me, let me perish ! {Aside. Vin. Dapperwit, a little of your aid ; for my lady's invincibly dumb. Dap. Would mine had been so too ! {Aside. Vin. I have used as many arguments to make her speak, as are requisite to make other women hold their tongues. Dap. Well, I am ready to change sides. \u2014 Yet before I go, madam, since the moon consents now I should see your face, let me desire you to pull off your mask ; which to a handsome lady is a favour, I'm sure. Dap. He is a poring, melancholy, modest sot, ashamed of the world : he searches all the records of wit, to compile a breviate of them for the use of players, printers, booksellers, and sometimes cooks, tobacco-men ; he employs his railing against the ignorance of the age, and all that have more money than he. Lyd. Now your last. Dap. Your judge-wit, or critic, is all these together, and yet has the wit to be none of them : he can think, speak, write, as well as the rest, but scorns (himself a judge) to be judged by pos terity : he rails at all the other classes of wits, and his wit lies in damning all but himself: \u2014 he is your true wit. Lyd. Truly, sir, I must not be long in debt to you for the obligation ; pray let me hear you recite some of your verses ; which to a wit is a favour, I'm sure. Dap. Madam, it belongs to your sex to be obliged first ; pull off your mask, and I'll pull out my paper. \u2014 [Aside.] Brisk again, of my side. Lyd. 'Twould be in vain, for you would want a candle now. Lyd. Then, I suspect you are of his form. Dap. I cannot deny it, madam. Vin. Dapperwit, you have been all this time on the wrong side ; for you love to talk all, and here's a lady would not have hindered you. Dap. A pox ! I have been talking too long indeed here ; for wit is lost upon a silly weak woman, as well as courage. {Aside. Vin. I have used all common means to move a woman's tongue and mask ; I called her ugly, old, and old acquaintance, and yet she would not dis prove me : \u2014 but here comes Ranger, let him try what he can do ; for, since my mistress is dogged, I'll go sleep alone. {Exit. Dap. [Aside.] I dare not make use again of the lustre of her face. \u2014 [ To Lydia.] I'll wait upon you home then, madam. Lyd. Faith, no ; I believe it will not be much to our advantages to bring my face or your poetry to light : for I hope you have yet a pretty good opinion of my face, and so have I of your wit. But if you are for proving your wit, why do not you write a play ? Dap. Because 'tis now no more reputation to write a play, than it is honour to be a knight. Your true wit despises the title of poet, as much as your true gentleman the title of knight ; for as a man may be a knight and no gentleman, so a man may be a poet and no wit, let me perish I Lyd. Pray, sir, how are you dignified or dis tinguished amongst the rates of wits ? and how many rates are there ? Dap. There are as many degrees of wits as of lawyers : as there is first your solicitor, then your attorney, then your pleading-counsel, then your chamber-counsel, and then your judge ; so there is first your court-wit, your coffee-wit, your poll-wit, or politic-wit, your chamber-wit, or scribble-wit and last of all, your judge-wit, or critic. Lyd. But are there as many wits as lawyers ? Lord, what will become of us ! \u2014 What employment can they have ? how are they known ? Dap. First, your court. wit is a fashionable, insinuating, flattering, cringing, grimacing fellow Re-enter Ranger. Lyd. [Aside.] Ranger ! 'tis he indeed : I am sorry he is here, but glad I discovered him before I went. Yet he must not discover me, lest I should be prevented hereafter in finding him out. False Ranger! \u2014 [To Flippant.] Nay, if they bring fresh force upon us, madam, 'tis time to quit the field. {Exeunt Lydia and Flippant. . Ran. What, play with your quarry till it fly from you !

You do not fear it, certainly ; otherwise you would not have encouraged them. Lyd.

SCENE II. \u2014 Christina's Lodging. Enter Christina and Isabel. Isa. For Heaven's sake, undress yourself, madam ! They'll not return to-night : all people have left the Park an hour ago. Chri. What is't o'clock ? Lyd. Madam, under my lady Flippant's pro tection, I am confident to beg yours ; being just now pursued out of the Park by a relation of mine, by whom it imports me extremely not to be dis covered: \u2014 [Knocking at the door.] butlfearheis now at the door. \u2014 [ To Isabel, who goes out.] Let me desire you to deny me to him courageously ; \u2014 for he will hardly believe he can be mistaken iu me. Chri. In such an occasion, where impudence is requisite, she will serve you as faithfully as you can wish, madam. Flip. Come, come, madam, do not upbraid her with her assurance, a qualification that only fits her for a lady's service. A fine woman of the town can be no more without a woman that can make an excuse with assurance, than she can be without a glass, certainly. Isa. 'Tis past one. CAri. It cannot be ! Isa. I thought that time had only stolen from happy lovers : \u2014 the disconsolate have nothing to do but to tell the clock. Chri. I can only keep account with my mis fortunes. Isa. I am glad they are not innumerable. Chri. And, truly, my undergoing so often your impertinency is not the least of them. Isa. I am then more glad, madam, for then they cannot be great ; and it is in my power, it seems, to make you in part happy, if I could but hold this villanous tongue of mine : but then let the people of the town hold their tongues if they will, for I cannot but tell you what they say. Chri. What do they say ? Isa. Faith, madam, I am afraid to tell you, now I think on't. Chri. She needs no advocate. Flip. How can any one alone manage an amorous intrigue? though the birds are tame, somebody must help draw the net. If 'twere not for a woman that could make an excuse with assurance, how should we wheedle, jilt, trace, dis cover, countermine, undermine, and blow up the stinking fellows ? which is all the pleasure I receive, or design by them ; for I never admitted a man to my conversation, but for his punishment, certainly. Chri. Nobody will doubt that, certainly. Chri. Is it so ill ? Isa. O, such base, unworthy things ! Chii. Do they say I was really Clerimont's wench, as he boasted ; and that the ground of the quarrel betwixt Valentine and him was not Valen tine's vindication of my honour, but Clerimont's jealousy of him ? Isa. Worse, worse a thousand times ! \u2014 such vil lanous things to the utter ruin of your reputation ! Chri. What are they ? Isa. Faith, madam, you'll be angry : 'tis the old trick of lovers to hate their informers, after they have made 'em such. Re-enter Isabel. Isa. Madam, the gentleman will not be mis taken : he says you are here, he saw you come in ; he is your relation, his name 's Ranger, and is come to wait upon you home. I had much ado to keep him from coming up. Lyd. [ To Christina.] Madam, for Heaven's sake, help me ! 'tis yet in your power ; if but, while I retire into your dining-room, you will please to personate me, and own yourself for her he pursued out of the Park : you are in mourning too, and your stature so much mine it will not contradict you. Chri. I am sorry, madam, I must dispute any command of yours. I have made a resolution to see the face of no man, till an unfortunate friend of mine, now out of the kingdom, return. Lyd. By that friend, and by the hopes you have to see him, let me conjure you to keep me Chri. I will not be angry. Isa. They say then, since Mr. Valentine's flying into France, you are grown mad, have put yourself into mourning, live in a dark room, where you'll see nobody, nor take any rest day or night, but rave and talk to yourself perpetually. Chri. Now, what else ? Isa. But the surest sign of your madness is, they say, because you are desperately resolved (in case my lord Clerimont should die of his wounds) to transport yourself and fortune into France to Mr. Valentine : a man that has not a groat to return you in exchange."], [108, "LOVE IN A WOOD; OR, ST.

She is liker Lydia in her style than her face. I see I am mistaken ; but to tell her I fol lowed her for another, were an affront rather than au excuse. She 's a glorious creature! {Aside. Chri. Tell me, sir, whence had you reason for this your rude pursuit of me, into my lodgings, my chamber ? why should you follow me ? Ran. Faith, madam, because you run away from me. you. Chri. Sure, to my plague, this is the first time you ever saw me ! Ran. Sure, to the plague of my poor heart, 'tis not the hundredth time I have seen you ! For, since the time 1 saw you first, you have not been at the Park, playhouse, Exchange, or other public place, but I saw you ; for it was my business to watch and follow. Chri. That was no sign of an acquaintance. Ran. You '11 pardon me, madam. Chri. Then, it seems, you mistook me for an other, and the night is your excuse, which blots out all distinctions. But now you are satisfied in your mistake, I hope you will seek out your woman in another place. Ran. Madam, I allow not the excuse you make for me. If I have offended, I will rather be con demned for my love, than pardoned for my insen sibility. Lyd. How 's that ? {Aside. Chri. What do you say ? Ran. Though the night had been darker, my heart would not have suffered me to follow any one but you : \u2014 he has been too long acquainted with you to mistake you. Lyd. What means this tenderness ? he mistook me for her sure. {Aside. Chri. Pray, when did you see me last at the Park, playhouse, or Exchange ? Ran. Some two, three days, ora week ago. Chri. I have not been this month out of this chamber. Lyd. That is to delude me. [Aside Chri. I knew you were mistaken. Ran. You'll pardon a lover's memory, madam. \u2014 [Aside.] A pox ! I have hanged myself in my own Line. One would think my perpetual ill. luck in lying should break me of the quality ; but, like a losing gamester, I am still for pushing on. till none will trust me. Chri. Come, sir, you run out of one error into a greater : you would excuse the rudeness of your mistake, and intrusion at this hour into my lodg ings, with your gallantry to me, \u2014 more unseason able and offensive. Ran. Nay, I am in love I see, for I blush and have not a word to say for myself. Chri. But, sir, if you will needs play the gal lant, pray leave my house before morning, lest you should be seen go hence, to the scandal of my honour. Rather than that should be, I'll call up the house and neighbours to bear witness I bid you begone. Ran. Since you take a night visit so ill, madam, I will never wait upon you again but by day. I go, that I may hope to return ; and, for once, I wish you a good night without me. Chri. Good night, for as long as I live. {Exit Ranger. Chri. What says the gentleman ? did you know me then, sir ? Ran. [Aside.] Not I, the devil take me ! but I must on now. \u2014 [Aloud. ] Could you imagine, ma dam, by the innumerable crowd of your admirers, you had left any man free in the town, or ignorant of the power of your beauty ? Chri. I never saw your face before, that I re member. Ran. Ah, madam ! you would never regard your humblest slave ; I was till now a modest lover. Lyd. Falsest of men ! [Aside. Chri. My woman said, you came to seek a re lation here, not a mistress. Lyd. And good night to my love, I'm sure. {Aside. Ran. I must confess, madam, I thought you would sooner disprove my dissembled error, than admit my visit, and was resolved to see you. Lyd. 'Tis clear 1 {Aside. Ran. Indeed, when I followed you first out of the Park, I was afraid you might have been a certain relation of mine, for your statures and habits are the same ; but when you entered here, I was with joy convinced. Besides, 1 would not for the world have given her troublesome love so much en couragement, to have disturbed my future ad dresses to you ; for the foolish woman does per petually torment me to make our relation nearer ; but never more in vain than since I have seen you, madam. Chri. Though I have done you an inconsider able service, I assure you, madam, you are not a little obliged to me. \u2014 [Aside.] Pardon me, dear Valentine ! Lyd. I know not yet whether I am more ob liged than injured : when I do, I assure you, ma dam, I shall not be insensible of either. Chri. I fear, madam, you are as liable to mis takes as your kinsman.

I was a faithful sentinel : nobody came out, let me perish ! Ran. No, no, I hunted upon a wrong scent ; I thought I had followed a woman, but found her an angel. Dap. What is her name ? Ran. That you must tell me. What very fine woman is there lives hereabouts ? Val. Let me know. Vin- Then know, the next day you went she put herself in mourning, and \u2014 Val. That might be for Clerimont, thinking him dead, as all the world besides thought. Vin. Still turning the dagger's point on your self! hear me out. I say she put herself into mourning for you \u2014 locked herself in her chamber this month for you \u2014 shut out her barking relations for you \u2014 has not seen the sun or the face of man since she saw you \u2014 thinks and talks of nothing but you \u2014 sends to me daily to hear of you \u2014 and, in short, (I think,) is mad for you. All this 1 can swear ; for I am to her so near a neighbour, and so inquisitive a friend for you \u2014 Dap. Faith, I know not any. She is, I warrant you, some fine woman of a term's standing or so in the town ; such as seldom appear in pubbc, but in their balconies, where they stand so constantly, one would think they had hired no other part of the house. Ran- And look like the pictures which painters expose to draw in customers ; \u2014 but I must know who she is. Vincent's lodging is hard by, I'll go and inquire of him, and lie with him to-night : but if he will not let me, I'll lie with you, for my lodg ing is too far off. Dap. Then I will go before, and expect you at mine. {Exeunt. Enter Servant. Serv. Mr. Ranger, sir, is coming up. Vin. What brings him now ? he comes to lie with me. Val. Who, Ranger ? Vin. Yes.

Enter Vincent, and Valentine in a riding habit, as newly from a journey. [Valentine retires lo the door behind. Enter Ranger. Vin. Your mistress, dear Valentine, will not be more glad to see you ! but my wonder is no less than my joy, that you would return ere you were informed Clerimont were out of danger. His surgeons themselves have not been assured of his recovery till within these two days. Val. I feared my mistress, not my life. My life I could trust again with my old enemy fortune ; but no longer my mistress in the hands of my greater enemies, her relations. Vin. Your fear was in the wrong place, then : for though my lord Clerimont live, he and his relations may put you in more danger of your life than your mistress's relations can of losing her. Val. Would any could secure her ! I would myself secure my life, for I should value it then. Vin. Come, come ; her relations can do you no hurt. I dare swear, if her mother should but say, Vour hat did not cock handsomely, she would never ask her blessing again. Val. Prithee leave thy fooling, and tell me, if, since my departure, she has given evidences of her love, to clear those doubts I went away with : \u2014 for as absence is the bane of common and bastard love, 'tis the vindication of that which is true and generous. Ran. What ! not yet a-bed ? your man is laying you to sleep with usquebaugh or brandy ; is he not so ? Vin. What punk will not be troubled with you to-night, therefore I am ? \u2014 is it not so ? Ran. I have been turned out of doors, indeed, just now, by a woman, \u2014 but such a woman, Vin cent ! Vin. Yes, yes, your women are always such women ! Ran. A neighbour of yours, and I 'm sure the finest you have. Vin. Prithee do not asperse my neighbourhood with your acquaintance ; 'twould bring a scandal upon an alley. Ran. Nay, I do not know her ; therefore I come to you. Vin. 'Twas no wonder she turned you out of doors, then ; and if she had known you, 'twould have been a wonder she had let you stay. But where does she five ? Ran. Five doors off, on the right hand. Vin. Pish ! pish ! \u2014 Ran. What 's the matter ? Vin. Does she live there, do you say ? Ran. Yes ; I observed them exactly, that my account from you might be exact. Do you know who lives there ? Vin. Yes, so well, that I know you are mistaken. Ran. Is she not a young lady scarce eighteen, of extraordinary beauty, her stature next to low, and in mourning ? Val. What is this ? [Aside. Vin. She is ; but if you saw her, you broke in at window. Vin. Nay, if you could ever doubt her love, you deserve to doubt on ; for there is no punishment great enough for jealousy \u2014 but jealousy. Val. You may remember, I told you before my flight I had quarrelled with the detainer of my mistress, but I thought I had killed my rival. Vin. But pray give me now the answer, which the suddenness of your flight denied me ; \u2014 how could Clerimont hope to subdue her heart by the assault of her honour ? Ran.

If you believe him, you must doubt the chastity of all the fine women ia town, and five miles about. Val. Was she at Park, then ? and have I a new rival ? {Aside. Vin. From the Park did you follow her, do you say ? \u2014 I knew you were mistaken. Ran. I tell you I am not. Vin. If you are sure it was that house, it might be perhaps her woman stolen to the Park, unknown to her lady. Ran. My acquaintance does usually begin with the maid first, but now 'twas with the mistress, I assure you. Vin. The mistress I \u2014 I tell you she has not been out of her doors since Valentine's flight. She is his mistress, \u2014 the great heiress Christina. Ran. I tell you then again, I followed that Christinafrom the Park home, where I talked with her half an hour, and intend to see her to-morrow again. Val. His reports of them will little invalidate hia testimony with me. Vin. He spares not the innocents in bibs and aprons. I'll secure you, he has made (at best) some gross mistake concerning Christina, which to-morrow will discover ; in the mean time let us go to sleep. Val. Would she talk with him too! [Aside. Vin. It cannot be. Ran. Christina do you call her ? Faith I am sorry she is an heiress, lest it should bring the scandal of interest, and the design of lucre, upon my love. Vin. No, no, her face and virtues will free you from that censure. But, however, 'tis not fairly done to rival your friend Valentine in his absence ; Val. I will not hinder you, because I cannot enjoy it myself : \u2014 Hunger, Revenge, to sleep are petty foes, But only Death the jealous eyes can close. [ Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I. \u2014 A Room in Crossbite's House. Joyn. How does my sweet god-daughter, poor wretch ? Enter Mrs. Joyner and Mrs. Crossbite. Cros. Well, very well. Joyn. Ah, sweet creature ! Alas ! alas !\u2014 I am sorry for her. Cros. Why, what has she done to deserve your sorrow, or my reprehension ? Joyn. Good morrow, gossip. Cros. Good morrow ; \u2014 but why up so early, good gossip ? Joyn. My care and passionate concern for you and yours would not let me rest, in truly. Cros. For me and mine ? Enter Lucy, and stands unseen at the door. Joyn. You know we have known one another long ; I think it be some nine-and-thirty years since you were married. Cros. Nine-and-thirty years old, mistress ! I'd have you to know, I am no far-born child; and if the register had not been burned in the last great fire, alas ! \u2014 but my face needs no register sure : nine and-thirty years old, said you ? Joyn. I said you had been so longmarried ; but, indeed, you bear your years as well as any she in Pepper-alley. Cros. Nine-and-thirty, mistress ! Joyn. This it is ; a woman, now-a-days, had rather you should find her faulty with a man, I warrant you, than discover her age, I warrant you. Cros. Marry, and 'tis the greatest secret far. Tell a miser he is rich, and a woman she is old, you will get no money of him, nor kindness of her. To tell me I was nine-and-thirty \u2014 (I say no more) 'twas unneighbourly done of you, mistress. Joyn. My memory confesses my age, it seems, as much as my face ; for I thought Cros. Pray talk nor think no more of any one's age ; but say what brought you hither so early. Lucy. What, are they talking of me ? {Aside. Joyn. In short, she was seen going into the meet inghouse of the wicked, otherwise called aplayhouse, hand in hand with that vile fellow Dapperwit. Cros. Mr. Dapperwit ! let me tell you, if 'twere not for master Dapperwit, we might have lived all this vacation upon green cheese, tripe, and ox cheek. If he had it, we should not want it ; but, poor gentleman! it often goes hard with him,\u2014 for he's a wit. Joyn. So, then, you are the dog to be fed, while the house is broken up ! I say, beware ! The sweet bits you swallow will make your daugh ter's belly swell, mistress ; and, after all your jun kets, there will be a bone for you to pick, mistress. Cros. Sure, master Dapperwit is no such man ner of man ! Joyn. He is a wit, you say ; and what are wits, but contemners of matrons, seducers, or defamers of married women, and deflowerers of helpless vir gins, even in the streets, upon the very bulks ; affronters of midnight magistracy, and breakers of windows ? in a word \u2014 Cros. But he is a little wit, a modest wit, and they do no such outrageous things as your great wits do."], [111, "SCENE II. LOVE IN A WOOD; OR, ST. JAMES'S PARK. 17 Joyn. Nay, I dare say, he will not say himself he is a little wit if you ask him. Lucy. Nay, I cannot hear this with patience. \u2014 \u2014 [Comes forward.] With your pardon, mother, you are as much mistaken as my godmother in Mr. Dapperwit ; for he is as great a wit as any, and in what he speaks or writes as happy as any. I can assure you, he contemns all your tearing wits, in comparison of himself. Joyn. Alas, poor young wretch ! I cannot blame thee so much as thy mother, for thou art not thyself. His bewitching madrigals have charmed thee iuto some heathenish imp with a hard name. Lucy. Nymph, you mean, godmother. Joyn. But you, gossip, know what's what. Yesterday, as I told you, a fine old alderman of the city, seeing your daughter in so ill hands as Dapperwit's, was zealously, and in pure charity, bent upon her redemption ; and has sent me to tell you, he will take her into his care and relieve your necessities, if you think good. Cros. Will he relieve all our necessities ? Ran. My obligation to you is great ; do not lessen it by delays of the favour you promised. Dap. But do not censure my honour ; for if you had not been in a desperate condition, \u2014 for as one nail must beat out another, one poison expel another, one fire draw out another, one fit of drinking cure the sickness of another, \u2014 so, the surfeit you took last night of Christina's eyes shall be cured by Lucy's this morning ; or as \u2014 Ran. Nay, I bar more similitudes. Dap. What, in my mistress's lodging ? that were as hard as to bar a young parson in the pul pit, the fifth of November, railing at the church of Rome ; or as hard as to put you to bed to Lucy and defend you from touching her ; or as \u2014 Ran. Or as hard as to make you hold your tongue \u2014 I shall not see your mistress, I see. Dap. Miss Lucy ! Miss Lucy ! \u2014 [Knocks at the door and returns.] \u2014 The devil take me, if good men (I say no more) have not been upon their knees to me, to see her, and you at last must obtain it. Joyn. AH. Cros. Mine, as well as my daughter's ? Ran. I do not believe you. Dap. 'Tis such as she ; she is beautiful without affectation ; amorous without impertinency ; airy and brisk without impudence ; frolic without rude ness ; and, in a word, the justest creature breath ing to her assignation. Ran. You praise her as if you had a mind to part with her ; and yet you resolve, 1 see, to keep her to yourself. Dap. Keep her ! poor creature, she cannot leave me ; and rather than leave her, I would leave writing lampoons or sonnets almost. Joyn. Yes. Cros. Well fare his heart ! \u2014 D'ye hear, daugh ter, Mrs. Joyner has satisfied me clearly ; Dapper wit is a vile fellow, and, in short, you must put an end to that scandalous familiarity between you. Lucy. Leave sweet Mr. Dapperwit ! \u2014 oh furious ingratitude ! Was he not the man that gave me my first Farrendon gown, put me out of worsted stockings and plain handkerchiefs, taught me to dress, talk, and move well ? Cros. He has taught you to talk indeed ; but, huswife, I will not have my pleasure disputed. Joyn. Nay, indeed, you are too tart with her, poor sweet soul. Lucy. He taught me to rehearse, too, \u2014 would have brought me into the playhouse, where I might have had as good luck as others : I might have had good clothes, plate, jewels, and things so well about me, that my neighbours, the little gentle men's wives of fifteen hundred or two thousand pounds a-year, should have retired into the country, sick with envy of my prosperity and greatness. Joyn. If you follow your mother's counsel, you are like to enjoy all you talk of sooner than by Dapperwit's assistance : \u2014 a poor wretch that goes on tick for the paper he writes his lampoons on, and the very ale and coffee that inspire him, as they say. Cros. I am credibly informed so, indeed, madam Joyner. Joyn. Well, I have discharged my conscience ; good morrow to you both. {Exeunt severally. Ran. Well, I'll leave you with her then. Dap. What, will you go without seeing her ? Ran. Rather than stay without seeing her. Dap. Yes, yes, you shall see her ; but let me perish if I have not been offered a hundred guineas for a sight of her ; by \u2014 I say no more. Ran. [Aside.] I understand you now. \u2014 [Aloud.] If the favour be to be purchased, then I'll bid all I have about me for't. Dap. Fy, fy, Mr. Ranger ! you are pleasant, i'faith. Do you think I would sell the sight of my rarity ? \u2014 like those gentlemen who hang out flags at Charing-cross, or like \u2014 Ran. Nay, then I 'm gone again. Dap. What, you take it ill I refuse your money ? rather than that should be, give us it ; but take notice I will borrow it. Now I think on 't, Lucy wants a gown and some knacks. Ran. Here. Dap. But I must pay it you again : I will not take it unless you engage your honour I shall pay it you again. Ran. You must pardon me ; I will not engage my honour for such a trifle. Go, fetch her out. SCENE II.\u2014 Crossbite's Dining Room. Dap. Well, she's a ravishing creature : such eyes and lips, Mr. Ranger ! Ran. Prithee go. Dap. Such neck and breasts, Mr. Ranger ! Ran. Again, prithee go. Dap. Such feet, legs, and thighs, Mr. Ranger ! Ran. Prithee let me see 'em. Enter Dapperwit and Ranger. Dap. This is the cabinet in which I hide my jewel ; a small house, in an obscure, little, retired street, too. Ran. Vulgarly, an alley. Dap. Nay, I hide my mistress with as much care as a spark of the town does his money from his dun after a good hand of play ; and nothing but you could have wrought upon me for a sight of her, let me perish ! Dap. And a mouth no bigger than a ring ! \u2014 I need say no more. Ran. Would thou wert never to speak again ! Dap. And then so neat, so sweet a creature in c"], [112, "LOVE IN A WOOD; OR, ST. JAMES'S PARK. ACT III, 18 Dap. Sell thee ! \u2014 where should we find a chap man ? Go, prithee, mother, call out my dear Miss Lucy. bed, that, to my knowledge, she does not change her sheets in half a year. Ran. I thank you for that allay to my impatience. Dap. Miss Lucy ! Miss Lucy ! Miss ! \u2014 {Knocking at the door. Ran. Will she not open ? I am afraid my pretty miss is not stirring, and therefore will not admit us. Is she not gone her walk to Lamb's Conduit? Cros. Your Miss Lucy ! I do not wonder you have the conscience to bargain for us behind our backs, since you have the impudence to claim a propriety in us to my face. Ran. How's this, Dapperwit ? Dap. Come, come, this gentleman will not think the worse of a woman for my acquaintance with her. He has seen me bring your daughter to the lure with a chiney-orange, from one side of the playhouse to the other. Cros. I would have the gentleman and you to know my daughter is a girl of reputation, though she has been seen in your company ; but is now so sensible of her past danger, that she is resolved never more to venture her pitcher to the well, as they say. Dap. Fy, fy, a quibble next your stomach in a morning ! What if she should hear us ? would you lose a mistress for a quibble? that's more than I could do, let me perish ! \u2014 She's within, I hear her. Ran. But she will not hear you ; she's as deaf as if you were a dun or a constable. Dap. Pish ! give her but leave to gape, rub her eyes, and put on her day pinner ; the long patch under the left eye; awaken the roses on her cheeks with some Spanish wool, and warrant her breath with some lemon-peel ; the doors fly off the hinges, and she into my arms. She knows there is as much artifice to keep a victory as to gain it ; and 'tis a sign she values the conquest of my heart. Dap. How's that, widow ? I wonder at your confidence. Cros. I wonder at your old impudence, that where you have had so frequent repulses you should provoke another, and bring your friend here to witness your disgrace. Dap. Hark you, widow, a little. Cros. What, have you mortgaged my daughter to that gentleman ; and now would offer me a snip to join in the security ! Dap. [Aside.] She overheard me talk of a bar gain ; \u2014 'twas unlucky. \u2014 [Aloud.] Your wrath is grounded upon a mistake : Miss Lucy herself shall be judge ; call her out, pray. Cros. She shall not ; she will not come to you. Dap. Till I hear it from her own mouth, I cannot believe it. Ran. I thought her beauty had not stood in need of art. Dap. Beauty's a coward still without the help of art, and may have the fortune of a conquest but cannot keep it. Beauty and art can no more be asunder than love and honour. Ran. Or, to speak more like yourself, wit and judgment. Dap. Don 't you hear the door wag yet ? Ran. Not a whit. Dap. Miss ! miss ! 'tis your slave that calls. Come, all this tricking for him ! \u2014 Lend me your comb, Mr. Ranger. Ran. No, I am to be preferred to-day, you are to set me off. You are in possession, I will not lend you arms to keep me out. Dap. A pox ! don't let me be ungrateful ; if she has smugged herself up for me, let me prune and flounce my peruke a little for her. There's ne'er a young fellow in the town but will do as much for a mere stranger in the playhouse. Ran. A wit's wig has the privilege of being un combed in the very playhouse, or in the presence. Dap. But not in the presence of his mistress ; 'tis a greater neglect of her than himself. Pray lend me your comb. Ran. I would not have men of wit and courage make use of every fop's mean arts to keep or gain a mistress. Cros. You shall hear her say 't through the door. Dap. I shall doubt it unless she say it to my face. Cros. Shall we be troubled with you no more then ? Dap. If she command my death, I cannot dis obey her. Cros. Come out, child. Enter Lucy, holding down her head. Dap. Your servant, dearest miss : can you have \u2014 Cros. Let me ask her. Dap. No, I'll ask her. Ran. I'll throw up cross or pile who shall ask her. Dap. Can you have the heart to say you will never more break a cheese-cake with me at New Spring-garden, the Neat-house, or Chelsea ? never more sit in my lap at a new play ? never more wear a suit of knots of my choice ? and, last of all, never more pass away an afternoon with me again in the Green Garret ? \u2014 do not forget the Green Garret. Dap. But don't you see every day, though a man have never so much wit and courage, his mistress will revolt to those fops that wear and comb perukes well. I'll break off the bargain, and will not receive you my partner. Ran. Therefore you see I am setting up for myself. {Combs his peruke. Dap. She comes, she comes ! \u2014 pray, your comb. {Snatches Ranger's comb. Lucy. I wish I had never seen the Green Garret, \u2014 Damn the Green Garret ! Dop. Damn the Green Garret ! \u2014 You are strangely altered ! Lucy. 'Tis you are altered. Dap. You have refused Colby's Mulberry garden, the French-houses, for the Green Garret ; and a little something in the Green Garret pleased you more than the best treat the other places could Enter Mrs. Crossbite. Cros. Bargain ! \u2014 what, are you offering us to \u25a0sale ? Dap. A pox ! is't she ? \u2014 Here take your comb again then. {Returns the comb. Cros. Would you sell us ?

Since you have a design to pawn me for the rent, 'tis time to remove my goods. Dap. Thou art extremely mistaken. Lucy. Besides, I have heard such strange things of you this morning. Dap. What things ? Lucy. I blush to speak 'em. Dap. I know my innocence, therefore take my charge as a favour. What have I done ? Lucy. Then know, vile wit, my mother has confessed just now thou wert false to me, to her too certain knowledge ; and hast forced even her to be false to me too. Dap. Your disguise is so natural, I protest, it will excuse me. Sir Sim. I know that, prithee make no excuses, I say. No ceremony between thee and I, man: \u2014 read the letter. Dap. What, you have not opened it ! Sir Sim. Prithee, don't be angry, the seal is a little cracked : for I could not help kissing Mrs. Martha's letter. The word is, now or never. Her father she finds will be abroad all this day, and she longs to see your friend sir Simon Addleplot : \u2014 faith 'tis a pretty jest ; while I am with her, and praising myself to her at no ordinary rate. Let thee and I alone at an intrigue. Dap. Tell her I will not fail to meet her at the place and time. Have a care of your charge ; and manage your business like yourself, for yourself. Sir Sim. I warrant you. Dap. The gaining Gripe's daughter will make me support the loss of this young jilt here. {Aside. Ran. [Coming forward.] What fellow's that ? Dap. A servant to a friend of mine. Ran. Methinks he something resembles our acquaintance sir Simon ; but it is no compliment to tell him so : for that knight is the most egre gious coxcomb that ever played with lady's fan. Sir Sim. So ! thanks to my disguise, I know my enemies. {AsiOe. Ran. The most incorrigible ass, beyond the reproof of a kicking rival or a frowning mistress. But, if it be possible, thou dost use him worse than his mistress or rival can ; thou dost make such a cully of him. Dap. Faults in drink, Lucy, when we are not ourselves, should not condemn us. Lucy. And now to let me out to hire like a hackney ! I tell you my own dear mother shall bargain for me no more ; there are as little as I can bargain for themselves now-a-days, as well as properer women. Cros. Whispering all this while ! \u2014 Beware of his snares again : come away, child. Dap. Sweet, dear miss \u2014 Lucy. Bargain for me! \u2014 you have reckoned without your hostess, as they say. Bargain for me ! bargain for me ! {Exit. Dap. I must return, then, to treat with you. Cros. Treat me no treatings, but take a word for all. You shall no more dishonour my daughter, nor molest my lodgings, as you have done at all hours. Dap. Do you intend to change 'em, then, to Bridewell, or Long's powdering-tub ? Cros. No, to a bailiff's house, and then you'U be so civil, I presume, as not to trouble us. Ran. Here, will you have my comb again, Dap perwit ? Dap. A pox ! I think women take inconstancy from me worse than from any man breathing. Cros. Pray, sir, forget me before you write your next lampoon. [Exit Sir Sim. Does he think so too ? [Aside. Dap. Go, friend, go about your business. \u2014 [Exit Sir Simon.] A pox ! you would spoil all, just in the critical time of projection. He brings me here a summons from his mistress, to meet her in the evening ; will you come to my wedding? Enter Sir Simon Addleplot in the dress of a Clerk. \u2014 Ran. Don't speak so loud, you'll break poor Lucy's heart. Poor creature, she cannot leave you ; and, rather than leave her, you would leave writing of lampoons or sonnets \u2014 almost. Dap. Come, let her go, ungrateful baggage ! \u2014 But now you talk of sonnets, I am no living wit if her love has not cost me two thousand couplets at least. Ranger retires to the background. Sir Sim. Have I found you ? have I found you in your by-walks, faith and troth ? I am almost out of breath in following you. Gentlemen when they get into an alley walk so fast, as if they had more earnest business there than in the broad streets. Dap. [Aside.] \u2014 How came this sot hither? Fortune has sent him to ease my choler. \u2014 You im pudent rascal, who are you, that dare intrude thus onus? [Strikes him. Sir Sim. Don't you know me, Dapperwit ? sure you know me. [Softly. Dap. Wilt thou dishonour me with thy acquaint ance too? thou rascally insolent, pen-and-ink man. {Strikes him again. Ran. But what would you give, now, for a new satire against women, ready made ': \u2014 'Twould be as convenient to buy satires against women ready made, as it is to buy cravats ready tied. Dap.

Enter Lydia and my J.3-dyVupPAtlT,attendedby Leonorb, Lyd. 'Tis as hard for a woman to conceal her indignation from her apostate lover, as to conceal her love from her faithful servant. Gripe. How now, what will this end in ? [Aside. Cros. Who brought him in ? Lucy. That witch, that treacherous false wo man, my godmother, who has betrayed me, sold me to his lust.\u2014 Oh ! oh ! \u2014 Flip. Or almost as hard as it is for the prating fellows now-a-days to conceal the favours of ob liging ladies. Lyd. If Ranger should come up, (I saw him just now in the street, ) the discovery of my anger to him now would be as mean as the discovery of my love to him before. Flip. Though I did so mean a thing as to love a fellow, I would not do so mean a thing as to confess it, certainly, by my trouble to part with him. If I confessed love, it should be before they left me. Lyd. So you would deserve to be left, before you were. But could you ever do so mean a thing as to confess love to any ? Flip. Yes ; but I never did so mean a thing as really to love any. Lyd. You had once a husband. Flip. Fy 1 madam, do you think me so ill-bred as to love a husband ? Lyd. You had a widow's heart, before you were a widow, I see. Flip. I should rather make an adventure of my honour with a gallant for a gown, a new coach, a necklace, than clap my husband's cheeks for them, or sit in his lap. I should be as ashamed to be caught in such a posture with a husband, as a brisk well-bred spark of the town would be to be caught on his knees at prayers \u2014 unless to his mistress. Cros. Have you ravished my daughter then, you old goat ? ravished my daughter ! \u2014 ravished my daughter ! speak, villain. Gripe. By yea and by nay, no such matter. Cros. A canting rogue, too ! Take notice, landlord, he has ravished my daughter, you see her all in tears and distraction ; and see there the wicked engine of the filthy execution. \u2014 [Pointing to the chair.] \u2014 Jeremy, call up the neighbours, and the constable. \u2014 False villain ! thou shalt die for it. Gripe. Hold! hold! \u2014 [Aside.] Nay, I am caught. Cros. Go, go, make haste \u2014 Lucy. Oh ! oh !\u2014 Cros. Poor wretch! \u2014 Go quickly. Gripe. Hold! hold! \u2014 Thou young spawn of the old serpent ! wicked, as I thought thee inno cent ! wilt thou say I would have ravished thee 2 Lucy. I will swear you did ravish me. Gripe. I thought so, treacherous Eve ! \u2014 then I am gone, I must shift as well as I can. Lucy. Oh ! oh ! \u2014 Cros. Will none of you call up the neighbours, and the authority of the alley ? Gripe. Hold, I'll give you twenty mark among you to let me go. Cros. Villain ! nothing shall buy thy life. Land. But stay, Mrs. Crossbite, let me talk with you. Enter Ranoer and Dapperwit. Lyd.

Lyd. Take him with you, sir ; I suppose his business may be there to borrow, or win money, and I ought not to be his hindrance : for when he has none, he has his desperate designs upon that little I have ; \u2014 for want of money makes as devout lovers as Christians. Lyd. You mistake me ; but you shall not lessen any favour you do to me. You are going to excuse your not coming to me last night, when I take it as a particular obligation, that though you threat ened me with a visit, upon consideration you were so civil as not to trouble me. Dap. This is an unlucky morning with me ! here's my eternal persecution, the widow Flippant. [Aside. Flip. What, Mr. Dapperwit ! [Dappervv.it ret ires to the back of the stage, followed by Flippant. Ran. Indeed, cousin, besides my business, an- Dap. I hope, madam, he offers you no less security than his liberty. Lyd. His liberty is as poor a pawn to take up money on as honour. He is like the desperate bankrupts of this age, who, if they can get people's fortunes into their hands, care not though they spend them in jail all their lives. Flip. And the poor crediting ladies, when they have parted with their money, must be contented with a pitiful composition, or starve, for all them. Ran. But widows are commonly so wise as to be sure their men are solvable before they trust 'em. Flip. Can you blame 'em ! I declare, I will trust no man. Pray, do not take it ill, gentlemen : quacks in their bills, and poets in the titles of their plays, do not more disappoint us, than gallants with their promises ; but I trust none. Dap. Nay, she's a very Jew in that particular. To my knowledge, she '11 know her man, over and over again, before she trust him. Ran. Well, my dearest cousin, good-morrow. When I stay from you, so long again, blame me to purpose, and be extremely angry ; for nothing can make me amends for the loss of your company, but your reprehension of my absence. I '11 take such a chiding as kindly as Russian wives do beating. Lyd. If you were my husband, I could not take your absence more kindly than 1 do. Ran. And if you were my wife, I would trust you as much out of my sight as I could, to show my opinion of your virtue. Flip. A well-bred gentleman, I warrant. \u2014 Will you go then, cruel Mr. Dapperwit ? [Exeunt Ranger and Dapperwit, followed by mp other cause I did not wait on you was, my appre hension you were gone to the Park, notwithstanding your promise to the contrary. Lyd. Therefore, you went to the Park to visit me there, notwithstanding your promise to the contrary ? Ran. Who, I at the Park ! when I had promised to wait upon you at your lodging ! But were you at the Park, madam ? Lyd. Who, I at the Park ! when I had pro mised to wait for you at home ! I was no more at the Park than you were. Were you at the Park ? Ran. The Park had been a dismal desert to me, notwithstanding all the good company in it, if I had wanted yours. Lyd. [Aside.] Because it has been the constant endeavour of men, to keep women ignorant, they think us so ; but 'tis that increases our inquisitive ness, and makes us know them ignorant, as false. He is as impudent a dissembler as the widow Flippant, who is making her importunate addresses in vain, for aught I see. [Flippant comes forward, driving Dapperwit from one side of the stage to the other Flip. Dear Mr. Dapperwit ! merciful Mr. Dap perwit ! Dap. Unmerciful lady Flippant ! Flip. Will you be satisfied ? Dap. Won't you be satisfied? Flip. That a wit should be jealous ! that a wit should be jealous ! there's never a brisk young fellow in the town, though no wit, Heaven knows, but thinks too well of himself, to think ill of his wife or mistress. Now, that a wit should lessen his opinion of himself ; \u2014 for shame ! Dap. I promised to bring you off, but I find it enough to shift for myself \u2014 {Softly, apart to Ranger. Lady Flippant, Lyd. Have I not dissembled well, Leonore ? Leo. But, madam, to what purpose ? why do you not put him to his trial, and see what he can say for himself ? Lyd. I am afraid lest my proofs, and his guilt, should make him desperate, and so contemn that pardon which he could not hope for. Leo. 'Tis unjust to condemn him before you hear him. Lyd. What ! out of breath, madam ! Flip. I have been defending our cause, madam ; I have beat him out of the pit. I do so mumble these prating, censorious fellows they call wits, when 1 meet with them. Lyd. I will reprieve him till I have more evi dence. Dap. Her ladyship, indeed, is the only thing in petticoats I dread. 'Twas well for me there was company in the room ; for I dare no more venture myself with her alone, than a cully that has been bit dares venture himself in a tavern with an old rook. Leo. How will you get it ? Lyd. I will write him a letter in Christina's name, desiring to meet him ; when I shall soon discover if his love to her be of a longer standing than since last night ; and if it be not, I will not longer trust him with the vanity to think she gave him the occasion to follow her home from the Park ; so will at once disabuse him and myself. Leo. What care the jealous take in making sure of ills which they, but in imagination, cannot undergo ! Lyd. Misfortunes are least dreadful when roost Flip. I am the revenger of our sex, certainly.

Vin. Do you think so old a master in the faculty as he will want the varnish of probability for his lies ? Val. Do you think a woman, having the advan tage of her sex, and education under such a mis tress, will want impudence to disavow a truth that might be prejudicial to that mistress ? Vin. But if both testimonies are fallible, why will you needs believe his ? we are apter to believe the things we would have, than those we would not. Vin.

But what's the paper? a lampoon upon Christina, hatched last night betwixt squire Dapperwit and you, be cause ber maid used you scurvily ? Ran.

Will you judge of fortune by your expe rience, and not do your mistress the same justice ? Go see her, and satisfy yourself and her ; for if she be innocent, consider how culpable you are, not only in your censures of her, but in not seeing her since your coming. Val. If she be innocent, I should be afraid to surprise her, for her sake ; if false, I should be afraid to surprise her, for my own. Vin. To be jealous and not inquisitive is as hard as to love extremely and not to be something jealous. Val. Inquisitiveness as seldom cures jealousy, as drinking in a fever quenches the thirst. Vin. If she were at the Park last night, 'tis probable she'll not miss this.

I am like the winning gamester, so pleased with my luck, I will not quarrel with any who calls me a fool for't. Vin. Is this the style of a woman of honour? Ran. It maybe, for aught you know; I'm sure 'tis well if your female correspondents can read. Vin. I must confess I have none of the little letters, half name or title, like your Spanish Epis tles Dedicatory ; but that a man so frequent in honourable intrigues as you are, should not know the summons of an impudent common woman, from that of a person of honour ! Ran. Christina is so much a person of honour she'll own what she has writ when she comes. Enter Ranger, Ranger, you have prevented me ; I was going to look you out, between the scenes at the playhouse, the coffee-house, tennis-court, or Gifford's. Ran. Do you want a pretence to go to a bawdy house ? \u2014 but I have other visits to make. Vin. But will she come hither indeed ? Ran. Immediately. You'll excuse my liberty with you ; I could not conceal such a happiness from such a friend as you, lest you should have taken it unkindly. Vin. Faith , you have obliged me indeed ; for you and others would often have made me believe your honourable intrigues, but never did me the honour to convince me of 'em before. Vin. I forget. I should rather have sought you in Christina's lodgings, ha ! ha ! ha ! Ran. Well, well, I'm just come to tell you that Christina Vin. Proves not, by daylight, tho kind lady you followed last night out of the Park. Ran. I have better news for you, to my thinking. Vin. What is't ? Ran. Not that I have been in Christina's lodg ing this morning ; but that she'll be presently here in your lodging with me. Val. How ! {Aside. Vin. [Retiring, and speaking softly to Valen tine.] You see now, his report was a jest, a mere jest \u2014 [To Ranger.] Well, must my lodging be your vaulting-school still ? thou hast appointed a wench to come hither, I find. Ran. A wench ! you seemed to have more reverence for Christina last night. Vin. Now you talk of Christina, prithee tell me Ran. You are merry, I find, yet. Vin. When you are happy I cannot be otherwise. Run. [Aside,] But I lose time ; I should lay a little person in ambush, that lives hard by, in case Christina should be impatient to be revenged of her friends, as it often happens with a discontented heiress. Women, like old soldiers, more nimbly execute than they resolve. [Going out. Vin. What now ! you will not disappoint a woman of Christina's quality ? Ran. I'll be here before she comes, I warrant you. {Exit Vin. I do believe you truly ! \u2014 What think you, Valentine ? Val. [Coming forward.] I think, since she has"], [121, "LOVE IN A WOOD; OR, ST. JAMES'S PARK. 27 SCENE V. the courage tochallenge him, she'll have the honour of being first in the field. Vin. Fy, your opinion of her must be as bad, as Ranger's of himself is good, to think she would write to him. I long till his bona-roba comes, that you may be both disabused. Val. And I have not patience to stay her coming, lest you should be disabused. Chri. That you shall know hereafter. Val. No, you thought me too far out of the way to disturb your assignation ; and I assure you, madam, 'twas my ill-fortune, not my design : and that it may appear so, I do withdraw, as in all pood breeding and civility I am obliged ; for sure your wished-for lover's coming. Chri. What do you mean ? are you a-weary of that title ? Enter Christina and Isabel. Val. I am ashamed cf it, since it grows com mon. [Going out. Vin. Here she is, i'faith; I'm glad she's come. Val. And I'm sorry. But I will to my post again, lest she should say she came to me. {Retires as before- Vin. [Aside.] By heavens, Christina herself! 'tis she ! [Christina pulls off her mask. Chri. Nay, you will not, shall not go. Val. My stay might give him jealousy, and so do you injury, and him the greatest in the World : heavens forbid ! I would not make a man jealous ; for though you call a thousand vows, and oaths, and tears to witness (as you safely may), that you have not the least of love for me, yet if he ever knew how I have loved you, sure he would not, could not believe you. Chri. 1 do confess, your riddle is too hard for me to solve ; therefore you are obliged to do't yourself. Val. I wish it were capable of any otner inter. pretation than what you know already. Chri. Is this that generous good Valentine ? who has disguised him so ? {Weeps. Vin. Nay, I must withhold you then. [Stops Valentine going out.] Methinks she should be innocent ; her tongue, and eyes, together with that flood that swells 'em, do vindicate her heart. Val. 'Tis she : \u2014 cursed be these eyes ! more cursed than when they first betrayed me to that false bewitching face. {Aside. Chri. You may wonder, sir, to see me here \u2014 Vin. I must confess I do. Chri. But the confidence your friend has in you is the cause of mine ; and yet some blushes it does cost me to come to seek for a man. Val. Modest creature ! [Aside. Vin. How am 1 deceived ! [Aside. Chri. Where is he, sir ? why does he not ap pear, to keep me in countenance .' pray call him, sir; 'tis something hard if he should know I'm here. Vin. I hardly can myself believe you are here, madam. Val. They show but their long practice of dis simulation. [Going out. Chri. If my visit be troublesome or unseason able, 'tis your friend's fault ; I designed it not to you, sir. Pray call him out, that he may excuse it, and take it on himself, together with my shame. Vin. How impatient she is 1 [Aside. Chri. Or do you delay the happiness I ask, to make it more welcome ? I have stayed too long for it already, and cannot more desire it. Dear sir, call him out. Where is he ? above, or here within ? I'll snatch the favour which you will not give. \u2014 [Goes to the door and discovers Valentine.] What ! do you hide yourself for shame ? Val. [Coming forward.] I must confess I do. Chri. To see me come hither Vin. Come back : I hear Ranger coming up : stay but till he comes. Val. Do you think I have the patience of an alderman ? Vin. You may go out this way, when you will, by the back-stairs ; but stay a Little, till \u2014 Oh, here he comes. Re-enter Ranger. Upon his entrance Christina puts on her mask. Val. My revenge will now detain me. [Valentine retires again. Ran. [Aside] \u2014 What, come already ! where is Dapperwit? \u2014 [Aloud.] The blessing's double that comes quickly ; I did not yet expect you here, other wise 1 had done myself the injury to be absent. But I hope, madam, I have not made you stay long for me. Val. I acknowledge it. [Valentine offers to go out. Chri. Before you came to me ? But whither do you go ? come, I can forgive you. Val. But I cannot forgive you. Chri. Whither do you go ? you need not forge a quarrel to prevent mine to you : nor need you try if I would follow you, you know I will ; \u2014 I have, you see. Val. That impudence should look so like inno cence ! {Aside. Chri. I have not staid at all for you. Ran. I am glad of it, madam. Chri.

[Aside. ] Why does she remove so disdain fully from me ? \u2014 [Aloud.] I find you take it ill I was not at your coming here, madam. Chri. Indeed I do not ; you are mistaken, sir. Ran. Confirm me by a smile then, madam ; remove that cloud, which makes me apprehend foul weather.

Chri. You must not leave us, sir ; would you leave me with a stranger ? Chri. Whither would you go ? why would you go? Vol. To call your servant to you. Chri. She is here ; what would you have with her? Val. I mean your lover, \u2014 the man you came to meet. Chri. Oh heavens ! what lover ? what man ? I came to see no man but you, whom 1 bad too long lost.

Whispering, sir, argues an old acquaint ance ; but I have not the vanity to be thought of yours, and resolve you shall never have the dis paragement of mine. \u2014 Mr. Vincent, pray let us go in here. Ran. How's this ! I am undone, I see ; but if I let her go thus, I shall be an eternal laughing-stock to Vincent. [Aside. Vin. Do you not know him, madam ? I thought you had come hither on purpose to meet him. Chri. To meet him ! Enter Dapperwit. Dap. Christina's going away again ; \u2014 what's the matter ? Ran. What do you mean ? Dap. I scarce Had paid the chairmen, and was coming up after her, but I met her on the stairs, in as much haste as if she had been frightened. Ran. Who do you talk of ? Dap. Christina, whom I took up in a chair just now at St. James's gate. Ran. Thou art mad ! here she is, this is Christina. Vin. By your own appointment. Chri. What strange infatuation does delude you all ? you know, he said he did not know me. Vin. You writ to him ; he has your letter. Chri. Then, you know my name sure ? yet you confessed but now you knew me not. Ran. I must confess your anger has disguised you more than your mask ; for 1 thought to have met a kinder Christina here. Dap. I must confess I did not see her face ; but I am sure the lady is gone that I brought just now. Ran. I tell you again this is she : did you bring two ? Chri. I came in no chair, had no guide but my woman there. Vin. When did you bring your lady, Dapperwit? Dap. Even now, just now. Vin. This lady has been here half-an-hour. Ran. He knows not what he says, he is mad : you are all so ; I am so too. Vin. 'Tis the best excuse you can make for yourself, and by owning your mistake you'll show you are come to yourself. I myself saw your woman at the door, who but looked in, and then imme diately went down again ; \u2014 as your friend Dapper wit too affirms. Chri.

'Tis well \u2014 nay, certainly, I shall never be master of my senses more ; but why dost thou help to distract me too ? Dap. My astonishment was as great as yours to see her go away again ; I would have stayed her if I could. Chri. The paper is a stranger to me ; I never writ it. You are abused. Vin. Christina is a person of honour, and will own what she has written, Ranger. Ran. [Aside.] So ! the comedy begins ; I shall be laughed at sufficiently if I do not justify myself; I must set my impudence to hers. She is resolved to deny all, I see, and I have lost all hope of her. Vin. Come, faith, Ranger \u2014 Ran. You will deny too, madam, that I followed you last night from the Park to your lodging, where I staid with you till morning ? you never saw me before, I warrant. Chri. That you rudely intruded last night into my lodging, I cannot deny ; but I wonder yon have the confidence to brag of it : sure you will not of your reception ? Ran.

For aught I know, I have disappointed Mrs. Martha for you, and may lose thirty thousand pounds by the bar gain. Farewell ! a raving lover is fit for solitude. {Exit. Ran. Lydia, triumph !

Why should we be so fond of the by-paths of love, where we are still waylaid with surprises, trepans, dangers, and murdering disappointments ? \u2014 Just as at blindman's buff we run at all, Whilst those that lead us laugh to see us fall; And when we think we hold the lady fast, We find it but her scarf, or veil, at last. {Exit.

Would you have me so ill bred as to repulse her innocent kindness ? \u2014 what a thing it is to want wit ! Enter Dapperwit ami Sir Simon Addleplot, the latter leading Mrs. Martha. Sir Sim. At length you see I have freed the captive lady for her longing knight, Mr. Dapper wit : \u2014 who brings off a plot cleverly now ? Dap. I wish our poets were half so good at it. \u2014 Mrs. Martha, a thousand welcomes ! Sir Sim. [Aside.] A pox ! I must make haste to discover myself, or I shall discover what I would not discover ; but if I should discover my self in this habit, 'twould not be to my advantage. But I'll go, put on my own clothes, and look like a knight. \u2014 [Aloud.] Well, Mrs. Martha, I'll go seek out your knight : are you not impatient to see him ? [Dapperwit kisses and embraces Mrs. Martha. Sir Sim. Hold, hold, sir ! your joy is a little too familiar, faith and troth ! Dap. Will you not let me salute Mrs. Martha ? Mar. What, Jonas, do you think I do not know good breeding ? must I be taught by you ? Sir Sim. I would have kept the maidenhead of your lips for your sweet knight, Mrs. Martha, that's all ; I dare swear you never kissed any man before but your father. Mar. My sweet knight, if he will be knight of mine, must be contented with what he finds, as well as other knights. Sir Sim. So smart already, faith and troth ! Mar. Dear Mr. Dapperwit, I am overjoyed to see you ; but I thank honest Jonas for't. [She hugs Dapperwit. Mar. Wives must be obedient; let him take his own time. Sir Sim. Can you trust yourself a turn or two with master Dapperwit? Mar. Yes, yes, Jonas \u2014 as long as you will. Sir Sim. [Aside.] But I would not trust you with him, if I could help it : \u2014 So married wight sees what he dares not blame ; And cannot budge for fear, nor stay for shame. {Exit. Dap. I am glad he is gone, that I may laugh. 'Tis such a miracle of fops, that his conversation should be pleasant to me, even when it hindered me of yours. Mar. Indeed I'm glad he is gone too, as plea sant as he is. Sir Sim. [Aside.] How she hugs him ! Mar. Poor Mr. Dapperwit, I thought I should never have seen you again ; but I thank honest Jonas there \u2014 Sir Sim. Do not thank me, Mrs. Martha, any more than I thank you. Dap. I know why, I know why, sweet Mrs. Martha. I warrant you, you had rather have the parson's company than his? \u2014 now you are out of your father's house, 'tis time to leave being a hypocrite. Mar. Well, for the jest's sake, to disappoint my knight, I would not care if I disappointed my self of a ladyship. Dap. Come, I will not keep you on the tenters ; I know you have a mind to make sure of me : I have a little chaplain (I wish he were a bishop or one of the friars) to perfect our revenge upon that zealous Jew, your father. Mar. Do not speak ill of my father ; he has been your friend, I'm sure. Dap. My friend ! Mar. His hard usage of me conspired with your good mien and wit, and to avoid slavery under him, I stoop to your yoke. Dap. I will be obliged to your father for nothing but a portion ; nor to you for your love ; 'twas due Mar. I would not be ungrateful, Jonas. Sir Sim.

I will show my kindness to my worthy, brave, heroic knight, in being kind to his friend, his dear friend, who helped him to me. [Hugs Dapperwit again. Sir Sim. But, mistress Martha, he is not to help him always ; though he helps him to be married, he is not to help him when he is married. Mar. What, Mr. Dapperwit, will you love my worthy knight less after marriage than before ? that were against the custom ; for marriage gets a man friends, instead of losing those he has. Dap. I will ever be his servant and yours, dear madam ; do not doubt me. Mar.

Faith and troth, I am the very sir Simon Addleplot that is to marry you ; the same Dapperwit solicited you for; ask him else, my name is not Jonas. Mar. You think my youth and simplicity capable of this cheat ; but let me tell you, Jonas, 'tis not your borrowed clothes and titles shall make me marry my father's man. Sir Sim. Borrowed title ! I '11 be sworn I bought it of my laundress, who was a court-laundress ; but, indeed, my clothes I have not paid for ; there fore, in that sense, they are borrowed. Mar. Prithee, Jonas, let the jest end, or I shall be presently in earnest. And punish so her folly and his treachery : Revenge is sweet, and makes amends for lechery. {Exit. Sir Sim. Pray, be in earnest, and let us go ; the parson and supper stay for us, and I am a knight in earnest. Mar. You a knight ! insolent, saucy fool. Sir Sim. The devil take me, Mrs. Martha, if I am not a knight now I a knight-baronet too !

Will you not excuse yourself? but I must not let it rest so. \u2014 Know, then, Mrs. Martha \u2014 Leo. Come, madam, let not the loss vex you ; he is not worth the looking after. Lyd. It cannot but vex me yet, if I lost him by my own fault. Leo. You had but too much care to keep him. Lyd. It often happens, indeed, that too much care is as bad as negligence ; but I had rather be robbed than lose what I have carelessly. Leo. But, I believe you would hang the thief if you could. Mar. Come, I forgive thee before thy con fession, Jonas ; you never had had the confidence to have designed this cheat upon me but from Mr. Dapperwit's encouragement \u2014 'twas his plot. Sir Sim. Nay, do not do me that wrong, madam. Mar. But since he has trepanned me out of my .. j \u2014 Lyd. Not if I could have my own again. Leo. 1 see you would be too merciful. Lyd. I wish I were tried. Leo. But, madam, if you please, we will waive the discourse ; for people seldom (I suppose) talk with pleasure of their real losses."], [126, "LOVE IN A WOOD; OR, ST. JAMES'S PARK. ACT V. 32 Lyd. 'Ti3 better than to ruminate on them ; mine, I'm sure, will not out of head nor heart. Leo. Grief is so far from retrieving a loss, that it makes it greater ; but the way to lessen it is by a comparison with others' losses. Here are ladies in the Park of your acquaintance, I doubt not, can compare with you ; pray, madam, let us walk and find 'em out. Lyd. 'Tis the resentment, you say, makes the loss great or little ; and then, I'm sure, there is none like mine : however, go on. {Exeunt. Enter Ranger, followed by Christina and Isabel ; after them Lydia and Leonore. Val. I think it is. Vin. I suppose his friend Dapperwit is not far off; I will examine them both before you, and not leave you so much as the shadow of doubt : Ranger's astonishment at my lodging confessed his mistake. Val. His astonishment might proceed from Christina's unexpected strangeness to him. Vin. He shall satisfy you now himself to the contrary, I warrant you ; have but patience. Val. I had rather, indeed, he should satisfy ray doubts than my revenge ; therefore I can have patience. SCENE X .\u2014Another part of the same. Vin. But what women are those that follow him ? Val. Stay a little- Ban. Lydia, Lydia \u2014 poor Lydia ! Lyd. If she be my rival, 'tis some comfort yet to see her follow him, rather than he her. Enter Vincent and Valentine. Vin. I am glad I have found you, for now I am prepared to lead you out of the dark and all your trouble : I have good news. Val. You are as unmerciful as the physician who with new arts keeps his miserable patient alive and in hopes, when he knows the disease is incur able. {To Leonore. Leo. But if you follow them a little longer, for your comfort you shall see them go hand in hand. Chri. Sir! sir! \u2014 [To Ranger. Vin. And you, like the melancholy patient, mistrust and hate your physician, because he will not comply with your despair : but I'll cure your jealousy now. Val. You know, all diseases grow worse by relapses. Vin. Trust me once more. Leo. She calls to him already. Lyd. But he does not hear, you see ; let us go a little nearer. Vin. Sure it is Ranger ! Val. As sure as the woman that follows him closest is Christina. Vin. For shame 1 talk not of Christina ; I left her just now at home, surrounded with so many fears and griefs she could not stir. Val. She is come, it may be, to divert them here in the Park ; I'm sure 'tis she. Val. Well, you may try your experiments upon me. Vin. Just as I shut the door upon you, the woman Ranger expected came up stairs ; but find ing another woman in discourse with him, went down again; I suppose, as jealous of him, as you of Christina. Vin. When the moon, at this instant, scarce affords light enough to distinguish a man from a tree, how can you know her ? Val. How can you know Ranger, then ? Vin. I heard him speak. Val. So you may her too, I'll secure you, if you will draw but a little nearer ; she came, doubt less, to no other end but to speak with him : observe \u2014 Val. How does it appear she came to Ranger ? Vin. Thus : Dapperwit came up after he had brought her, just then, in a chair from St. James's by Ranger's appointment ; and it is certain your Christina came to you. Val. How can that be ? for she knew not I was in the kingdom. Chri. [To Ranger.] Sir, I have followed you hitherto ; but now, I must desire you to follow me out of the company ; for I would not be overheard nor disturbed. Vin. My man confesses, when I sent him to inquire of her woman about her lady's being here in the Park last night, he told her you were come ; and she, it seems, told her mistress. Ran. Ha ! is not this Christina's voice ? it is, 1 am sure ; I cannot be deceived now. \u2014 Dear madam \u2014 Val. [Aside.] That might be.\u2014 [Aloud. ] But did not Christina confess, Ranger was in her lodging last night ? Vin. By intrusion, which she had more particu larly informed me of, if her apprehensions of your danger had not posted me after you ; she not having yet (as I suppose) heard of Clerimont's recovery. I left her, poor creature ! at home, distracted with a thousand fears for your life and love. Val. Her love, I'm sure, has cost me more fears than my life; yet that little danger is not past (as you think) till the great one be over. Vin. Open but your eyes, and the fantastic goblin's vanished, and all your idle fears will turn to shame ; for jealousy is the basest cowardice. Val. I had rather, indeed, blush for myself than her. Vin. It is she indeed. [Apart to Valentine, Val. Is it so ? Chri. Come, sir \u2014 [To Ranger. Val. Nay, I'll follow you too, though not in vited. [Aside. Lyd, I must not, cannot stay behind. [Aside. {They all go off together in a huddl- hastily. Re-enter Christina, Isabel, and Valentine, on the other side. Chri. Come along, sir. Val. So ! I must stick to her when all is done ; her new servant has lost her in the crowd, she has gone too fast for him ; so much my revenge is swifter than his love. Now shall I not only have the deserted iover's revenge, of disappointing her of her new man, but an opportunity infallibly at once to discover her falseness, and confront her Vin I'm sure you will have more reason. But is not that Ranger there ? impudence. [Aside."], [127, "LOVE IN A WOOD; OR, ST. JAMES'S PARK. SCENE V. 33 Chri. Pray come along, sir, I am in haste. Val. So eager, indeed ! \u2014 I wish that cloud may yet withhold the moon, that this false woman may not discover me before I do her. [Aside. Chri. But that will not serve my turn ; for straight you must go clear yourself and me to him you have injured in me ; if he has not made too much haste from me to be found again. You must, I say ; for he is a man that will have satisfaction ; and in satisfying him, you do me. Val. Then he is satisfied. Chri. Here no one can hear us, and I'm sure >e cannot see one another. Val. 'Sdeath ! what have I giddily run myself upon ? 'Tis rather a trial of myself than her ; \u2014 I cannot undergo it. [Aside. Chri. Come nearer, sir. Val. Hell and vengeance ! I cannot suffer it \u2014 I cannot. [Aside. Chri. How ! is it you ? then I am not satisfied. Val. Will you be worse than your word ? Chri. I gave it not to you. Val. Come, dear Christina, the jealous, like the drunkard, has his punishment with his offence. Chri. Come, come ; yet nearer, \u2014 pray come nearer. Enter Vincent. Vin. Valentine ! Mr. Valentine ! Val. It is impossible ! I cannot hold ! I must discover myself, rather than ber infamy. [Aside. Chri. You are conscious, it seems, of the wrong you have done me, and are ashamed, though in the dark. [Speaks, walking slowly. Val. Vincent ! \u2014 Vin. Where have you been all this while ? [Valentine holds Christina by the hand, who seems to struggle to get from him. Val. Here with my injured Christina. Vin. She 's behind with Ranger, who is forced to speak all the tender things himself; for she affords him not a word. Vat. How's this ! [Aside. Chri. I'm glad to find it so ; for all my busi ness with you is, to show you your late mistakes, and force a confession from you of those unman nerly injuries you have done me. Val. Pish ! pish ! Vincent ; who is blind now ? who deceived now ? Val. What ! I think she's honest ; or does she know me ? \u2014 sure she cannot. [Aside. Vin. You are ; for I'm sure Christina is with him. Come back and see. Chri. First, your intrusion, last night, into my Lodging ; which, I suppose, has begot your other gross mistakes. Vat. No, she takes me for Ranger, I see again. [Aside. [They go out at one door, and return at the other. Re-enter Lydia and Leonore, followed (^Ranger. Ban. [ To Lyoia.] Still mocked 1 still abused ! did you not bid me follow you where we might not be disturbed or overheard ? \u2014 and now not allow me a word ! Chri. You are to know, then, (since needs you must,) it was not me you followed last night to my lodging from the Park, but some kinswoman of yours, it seems, whose fear of being discovered by you prevailed with me to personate her, while she withdrew, our habits and our statures being much alike ; which I did with as much difficulty, as she used importunity to make me ; and all this my lady Flippant can witness, who was then with your cousin. Vin. Did you hear him ? {Apart to Valentine. Val. Yes, yes, peace. {Apart to Vincent. Ran. Disowning your letter and me at Mr. Vincent's lodging, declaring you came to meet another there, and not me, with a great deal of such affronting unkindness, might be reasonable enough, because you would not entrust Vincent with our love ; but now, when nobody sees us nor hears us, why this unseasonable shyness ? Lyd. It seems she did not expect him there, but had appointed to meet another : \u2014 I wish it were so. [Aside. Val. I am glad to hear this. [Aside. Chri. Now, what your claim to me, at Mr. Vincent's lodging, meant ; the letter and promises you unworthily, or erroneously, laid to my charge, you must explain to me and others, or \u2014 Val. How's this ! I hope I shall discover no guilt but my own : - she would not speak in threats to a lover. {Aside. Ran. I have not patience ! \u2014 do you design thus to revenge my intrusion into your lodging last night ? sure if you had then been displeased with my company, you would not have invited yourself to't again by a letter ? or is this a punishment for bringing you to a house so near your own, where, it seems, you were known too ? I do confess it was a fault ; but make me suffer any penance but your silence, because it is the certain mark of a mistress's lasting displeasure. Lyd. My \u2014 is not yet come. [Aside. Ran. Not yet a word ! you did not use me so unkindly last night, when you chid me out of your house, and with indignation bid me begone. Now, you bid me follow you, and yet will have nothing to say to me ; and I am more deceived this day and night than I was last night ; \u2014 when, I must confess, I followed you for another \u2014 Lyd. I'm glad to hear that. [Aside. Ran. One that would have used me better ; whose love I have ungratefully abused for yours ; yet from no other reason but my natural incon stancy. \u2014 [Aside.] Poor Lydia ! Lydia! Lyd. He muttered my name sure-, and with a Chri. Was it because you found me in Mr. Vincent's lodgings you took a liberty to use me like one of your common visitants ? but know, I came no more to Mr. Vincent than you. Yet, I confess, my visit was intended to a man \u2014 a brave man, till you made him use a woman ill ; worthy the love of a princess, till you made him censure mine ; good as angels, till you made him unjust : \u2014 why, in the name of honour, would you do't ? Val. How happily am I disappointed ! \u2014 poor, injured Christina ! [Aside. Chri. He would have sought me out first, if you had not made him fly from me. Our mutual love, confirmedby a contract, made our hearts inseparable, till you rudely, if not maliciously, thrust in upon us, and broke the close and happy knot : I had lost him before for a month, now for ever. [Weeps. Val. My joy and pity makes me as mute as my shame ; yet I must discover myself. [Aside. Chri. Your silence is a confession of your guilt. Val. I own it. [Aside. sigh. [Aside.

Indeed, your worship had better seen her fairly buried, as they say. Cros. If my daughter there should have done so, I would not have given her a groat. Gripe. Marry a wit ! Sir Sim. Mrs. Joyner, do not let me lose the widow too : \u2014 for if you do, (betwixt friends,) I and my small annuity are both blown up : it will follow my estate. {Aside to Joyner. Joyn. I warrant you. {Aside. Flip. Let us make sure of sir Simon to-night, or \u2014 {Aside to Joyner. Ran. Is it she ! Lydia all this while ! \u2014 how am I gulled ! and Vincent in the plot too ! [Aside. Lyd. Now, false Ranger ! Ran. Now, false Christina too ! \u2014 you thought I did not know you now, because I offered you such an unusual civility. Lyd. You knew me ! \u2014 I warrant you knew, too, that I was the Christina you followed out of the Park last night ! that I was the Christina that writ the letter too ! Ran. Certainly, therefore I would have taken my revenge, you see, for your tricks. Val. Is not this the same woman that took re fuge in your house last night, madam ? [To Christina. Chri. The very same. Val. What, Mr. Ranger, we have chopped, and changed, and hid our Christinas so long and often, that at last we have drawn each of us our own ? Joyn. You need not fear it. \u2014 [Aside.] Like the lawyers, while my clients endeavour to cheat one another, I in justice cheat 'em both. Gi ipe. Marry a wit ! Enter Dapperwit, Ranger, Lydia, Valentine, Chris- tina, and Vincent. Dapperwit stops them, and they stand all behind. Ran. Mr. Valentine in England! \u2014 the truth on't is, you have juggled together, and drawn without my knowledge ; but since she will have it so, she shall swear me for good and all now. {Goes to take her by the hand.

What, is he here ! Lucy and her mother ! {Aside. Gripe. Tell me how thou earnest to marry a wit. Mar. Pray be not angry, sir, and I'll give you a good reason. Gripe. Reason for marrying a wit ! Mar. Indeed, I found myself six months gone with child, and saw no hopes of your getting me a husband, or else I had not married a wit, sir. Joyn. Then you were the wit. Gripe. Had you that reason ? nay, then {Holding up his hands. Dap. How's that ! {Aside. Ran. Who would have thought, Dapperwit, you would have married a wench ? {Apart to Leonore, Ranger listens. Ran. You consider it right, cousin ; for indeed you are but merciful to yourself in it. Lyd. Yet, if I would be rigorous, though I made a blot, your oversight has lost the game. Ran. But 'twas rash woman's play, cousin, and ought not to be played again, let me tell you. Enter Dapperwit. Dap. Who's there ? who's there ? Ran. Dapperwit. Dap. Mr. Ranger, I am glad I have met with you, for I have left my bride just now in the house at Mulberry-garden, to come and pick up some of my friends in the Park here to sup with us. Ran. Your bride ! are you married then ? where is you bride ? Dap. Here at Mulberry-garden, I say, where you, these ladies and gentlemen, shall all be wel come, if you will afford me the honour of your company. Ran. With all our hearts : \u2014 but who have you married ? Lucy? Dap. What ! do you think I would marry a wench ? I have married an heiress worth thirty thousand pounds, let me perish ! Dap. [To Ranger.]' \u2014 Well, thirty thousand pounds will make me amends; I have knownmy bet ters wink, and fall on for five or six.\u2014 [To Gripe and the rest.] What ! you are come, sir, to give me joy? you Mrs. Lucy, you and you? well, unbid guests are doubly welcome. \u2014 Sir Simon, I made bold to invite these ladies and gentlemen. \u2014 For you must know, Mr. Ranger, this worthy sir Simon does not only give me my wedding supper, but my mistress too ; and is, as it were, my father. Sir Sim. Then I am, as it were, a grandfather to your new wife's Hans en kelder; to which you are but, as it were, a father ! there's for you again, sir \u2014 ha, ha !

Nay, if you will rob me of my wench, sir, can you blame me for robbing you of your daughter ? I cannot be without a woman. Gripe. My daughter, my reputation, and my money gone ! \u2014 but the last is dearest to me. Yet at once I may retrieve that, and be revenged for the loss of the other ; and all this by marrying Lucy here : I shall get my five hundred pounds again, and get heirs to exclude my daughter and frustrate Dapperwit ; besides, 'tis agreed on all hands, 'tis cheaper keeping a wife than a wench. {Aside. Dap. If you are so melancholy, sir, we will have the fiddles and a dance to divert you ; come ! Cros. Upon my repute he never saw her before : \u2014 but will your worship marry my daughter then ? Gripe. I promise her and you, before all this good company, to-morrow I will make her my wife. Dap. How ! Ran. Our ladies, sir, I suppose, expect the same promise from us. {To Valentine. Val. They may be sure of us without a promise ; but let us (if we can) obtain theirs, to be sure of them. Dap. But will you marry her to-morrow ? \u2014 {To Gripe. Gripe. I will, verily. Dap. I am undone then ! ruined, let me perish ! Sir Sim. No, you may hire a little room in Covent Garden, and set up a coffee-house : \u2014 you and your wife will be sure of the wits' custom. Dap. Abused by him I have abused ! \u2014 Fortune our foe we cannot overwit ; By none but thee our projects are cross-bit. Val. Come, dear madam, what, yet angry? \u2014 jealousy sure is much more pardonable before mar riage than after it ; but to-morrow, by the help of the parson, you'll put me out of all my fears. Chri. I am afraid then you would give me my revenge, and make me jealous of you ; and I had rather suspect your faith than you should mine. Ran. Cousin Lydia, I bad rather suspect your faith too, than you should mine ; therefore let us e'en marry to-morrow, that I may have my turn of watching, doggiog, standing under the window, at the door, behind the hanging, or \u2014 Lyd. But if I could be desperate now and give you up my liberty, could you find in your heart to quit all other engagements, and voluntarily turn your self over to one woman, and she a wife too ? could you away with the insupportable bondage of ma trimony ? Ran. You talk of matrimony as irreverently as my lady Flippant : the bondage of matrimony I no \u2014 A Dance. Gripe. Indeed, you have put me so upon a merry pin, that 1 resolve to marry too. Flip. Nay, if my brother come to marrying once, I may too ; I swore I would, when he did, little thinking \u2014 Sir Sim, I take you at your word, madam. Flip. Well, but if I had thought you would have been so quick with me \u2014 Gripe. Where is your parson ? Dap. What ! you would not revenge yourself upon the parson ? Gripe. No, I would have the parson revenge me upon you ; he should marry me. Dap. I am glad you are so frolic, sir ; but who would you marry ? Gripe. That innocent lady ? {Pointing to Lurv. Dap. That innocent lady. Gripe. Nay, I am impatient, Mrs. Joyner ; pray fetch him up if he be yet in the house. Dap. We were not married here : \u2014 but you cannot be in earnest. Gripe. You'll find it so ; since you have robbed me of my housekeeper, I must get another. Dap. Why, she was my wench ! Gripe. I'll make her honest then. The end of marriage now is liberty, And two are bound \u2014 to set each other free. EPILOGUE SPOKEN BY DAPPERWIT. Now, my brisk brothers of the pit, you'll say I'm come to speak a good word for the play ; But gallants, let me perish ! if I do, For I have wit and judgment, just like you ; Wit never partial, judgment free and bold, For fear or friendship never bought or sold, Nor by good-nature e'er to be cajoled. Good-nature in a critic were a crime, Like mercy in a judge, and renders him G nilty of all those faults he does forgive. Besides, if thief from gallows you reprieve, He'll cut your throat ; so poet saved from shame, In damn'd lampoon will murder your good name. Yet in true spite to him and to his play, Good faith, you should not rail at them to-day; But to be more his foe, seem most his friend, And so maliciously the play commend ; That he may be betray'd to writing on, And poet let him be, \u2014 to be undone.

Me thinks he's a pretty apish kind of a gentleman, like other gentlemen, and handsome enough to lie with in the dark, when husbands take their privi leges ; and for the day-times, you may take the privilege of a wife. Hip. Excellent governess ! you do understand the world, I see. Hip. What kind of man is that Mr. Gerrard ? and then I'll tell you. Mons. WThy \u2014 he is truly a pretty man, a pretty man \u2014 a pretty so so \u2014 kind of man, for an Englishman. Hip. How a pretty man ? Mons. Why, he is conveniently tall \u2014 but \u2014 Hip. But what ? Mons. And not ill-shaped \u2014 but \u2014 Hip. But what ? Mons. And handsome, as 'tis thought, but \u2014 Hip But ! what are your exceptions to him ? Mons. I can't tell you, because they are innu merable, innumerable, mon soy ! Hip. Has he wit ? Mons. Ay, ay, they say, he's witty, brave, and de bel humeur, and well-bred, with all that \u2014 \u00bb but \u2014 Prue. Then you should be guided by me. Hip. Art thou in earnest then, damned jade ? \u2014 would'st thou have me marry him ? \u2014 Well, there are more poor young women undone, and married to filthy fellows by the treachery and evil counsel of chambermaids, than by the obstinacy and covetousness of parents. Prue. Does not your father come on purpose out of Spain to marryyou to him? Can you release your self from your aunt or father any other way ? Have you a mind to be shut up as long as you live? For my part, though you can hold out upon the lime from the walls here, salt, old shoes, and oatmeal, I can not live so : I must confess my patience is worn out. Hip. But what ? does he want judgment ? Mons. Non, non : they say he has good sense and judgment ; but it is according to the account Englis\u2014 for \u2014 Hip. For what ? Mons. For, jarnie ! if I think it. Hip. Why? Mons. Why ? \u2014 why his tailor lives within Lud gate \u2014 his valet de chambre is no Frenchman \u2014 and he has been seen at noon-day to go into an English eating-house \u2014 Hip. Alas, alas, poor Prue! your stomach lies another way : I will take pity of you, and get me a husband very suddenly, who may have a servant at your service.

To show such a fear to your rival, were for his honour, and not for yours, sure. Mons. Nay, cousin, I'd have you know I was never afraid of losing my mistress in earnest Let me see the man can get my mistress from me, jar nie ! \u2014But he that loves must seem a little jealous. Hip. Not to his rival : those that have jealousy hide it from their rivals. Hip. Say you so, cousin ! Mons. Then for being well-bred, you shall judge: \u2014 First, he can't dance a step, nor sing a French song, nor swear a French oate, nor use the polite French word in his conversation; and in fine, can't play at hombre \u2014 but speaks base good Englis, with the commune home-bred pronuncia tion ; and in fine, to say no more, he never carries a snuff-box about with him. Mons. But there are some who say, jealousy is no more to be hid than a cough : \u2014 but it should never be discovered in me, if I had it, because it is not French at all \u2014 ventre bleu ! Hip. Indeed ! Mons. And yet this man has been abroad as much as any man, and does not make the least show of it, but a little in his mien, not at all in his discour, jarnie 1 He never talks so much as of St. Peter's church at Rome, the Escurial, or Madrid ; nay, not so much as of Henry IV., of Pont-neuf, Paris, and the new Louvre, nor of the Grand Roy. Hip. 'Tis for his commendation, if he does not talk of his travels. Hip. No, you should rally your rival, and rather make a jest of your quarrel to him ; and that, I suppose, is French too. Mons. 'Tis so, 'tis so, cousine; 'tis the veritable French method ; for your Englis, for want of wit, drive every thing to a serious grum quarrel, and then would make a jest on't, when 'tis too late, when they can't laugh, jarnie ' Hip. Yes, yes, I would have you rally him soundly : do not spare him a jot. \u2014 But shall you see him to-night ? Mons. Ay, ay. Hip. Yes ; pray be sure to see him for the jest's sake. Mons. Auh ! auh ! \u2014 cousine \u2014 he is conscious to himself of his wants, because he is very envious ; for he cannot endure me. Hip. [Aside.] He shall be my man then for that. \u2014 Ay, ay ! 'tis the same, Prue. \u2014 [Aloud.] No, I know he can't endure you, cousin. Mons. How do you know it \u2014 who never stir out ? teste non ! Hip. Well \u2014 dear cousin, \u2014 if you will pro mise me never to tell my aunt, I'll tell you. Mons. I won't, I won't, jarnie ! Hip. Nor to be concerned yourself, so as to make a quarrel of it. Mons. Non, non \u2014 Mons. I will \u2014 for 1 love a jest as well as any bel esprit of 'em all \u2014 da '. Hip. Ay, and rally him soundly ; be sure you rally him soundly, and tell him just thus : \u2014 that the lady he has so long courted, from the great window of the Ship tavern, is to be your wife to morrow, unless he come at his wonted hour of six in the morning to her window to forbid the bans ; for 'tis the first and last time of asking ; and if he come not, let him for ever hereafter stay away, and hold his tongue. Mons. Ha ! ha ! ha ! a very good jest, teste bleu ! Hip . Upon the word of a gentleman ? Mons. Foy de chevalier, I will not quarrel. Prue. Lord, miss ! I wonder you won't believe him without more ado. Hip. Then he has the hatred of a rival for you. Mons. Mai a peste ! Hip. You know my chamber is backward, and has a door into the gallery which looks into the back yard of a tavern, whence Mr, Gerrard once spying me at the window, has often since attempted to come in at that window by the help of the leads of a low building adjoining ; and, indeed, 'twas as much as my maid and I could do to keep him out. Mons. Au, le coquin ! \u2014 Hip. But nothing is stronger than aversion ; for I hate him perfectly, even as much as I love you \u2014 Hip. And if the fool should come again, I would tell him his own, I warrant you, cousin. My gen tleman should be satisfied for good and all, I'd secure him. Mons. Bon, bon. Prue. Well, well, young mistress ; you were not at Hackney school for nothing, I see ; nor taken away for nothing. \u2014 A woman may soon be too old, but is never too young to shift for herself. [Aside.

Nay, I am sure he'll be ashamed of it, I shall make him look so sillily, teste non ! \u2014 I long to find him out \u2014 Adieu, adieu, la cousine. Hip. Shall you be sure to find him ? Mons.

So am I, cousin, for having him come too, for the jest's sake. Mons. Well, well, leave it to me :\u2014 ha : ha ! ha! Prue. I believe so, faith ! \u2014 but what design have we now on foot? [Aside. Hip. This discovery is an argument, sure, of my love to you. Mons. Ay, ay, say no more, cousin, I doubt not your amour for me, because I doubt not your judgment. But what's to be done with this fau faron ? \u2014 I know where he eats to-night \u2014 I'll go find him out, ventre bleu ! \u2014 Hip. O, my dear cousin, you will not make a quarrel of it ? I thought what your promise would come to ! Mons. You'd have a man of honour \u2014 Hip. Keep his promise. Mons. And lose his mistress .' \u2014 That were not for my honour, ma foy ! Hip.

If he be not a fool, he would rather be obliged to me for my virtue than to you, since, at long run, he must, whether he will or no. Mrs. Caut. So, so ! Hip.

You need not be afraid, sir ; we will use no violence to you ; you are not fit for our service : we know you. Flirt.

Spain, he is wise enough that is grave, politic enough that says little, and honourable enough that is jealous ; and though I say it, that should not say it, I am as grave, gruin, and jealous, as any Spaniard breathing. Mrs. Caut. I know you are, brother. Don. And I will be a Spaniard in everything still, and will not conform, not I, to their ill favoured English customs, for I will wear my Spanish habit still, I will stroke my Spanish whiskers still, and I will eat my Spanish olio still ; and my daughter shall go a maid to her husband's bed, let the English custom be what 'twill : I would fain see any finical, cunning, insinuating monsieur of the age, debauch, or steal away my daughter. But, well, has she seen my cousin ? how long has he been in England ? Mrs. Caut. These three days. Don. And she has seen him, has she ? I was contented he should see her, intending him for her husband ; but she has seen nobody else upon your certain knowledge ? Airs. Caut. No, no, alas ! how should she ? 'tis impossible she should. Don. Have you had a Spanish care of the honour of my family ? that is to say, have you kept up my daughter close in my absence, as I directed ? Airs. Caut. I have, sir, but it was as much as I could do. Don. I knew that ; for 'twas as much as I could do to keep up her mother ; \u2014 I that have been in Spain, look you. Airs. Caut. Nay, 'tis a hard task to keep up an English woman. Don. As hard as it is for those who are not kept up to be honest, look you, con licentia, sister. Afrs. Caut. How now, brother ! I am sure my husband never kept me up. Don. I knew that, therefore I cried con licentia, sister, as the Spaniards have it. Mrs. Caut. But you Spaniards are too cen sorious, brother. Don. You English women, sister, give us too much cause, look you : \u2014 but you are sure my daughter has not seen a man since my departure ? Mrs. Caut. No, not so much as a churchman. Don. Where is her chamber ? pray let me see her. Mrs. Caut. You'll find her, poor creature, asleep, I warrant you : or, if awake, thinking no hurt, nor of your coming this morning. Don. Let us go to her, I long to see her, poor innocent wretch. [Exeunt. Don. As a churchman ! voto ! I thank you for that ; not a churchman ! not a churchman ! Mrs. Caut. No, not so much as a churchman ; but of any, one would think one might trust a churchman. Don. No, we are bold enough in trusting them with our souls, I'll never trust them with the body of my daughter, look you, guarda ! You see what comes of trusting churchmen here in England ; and 'tis because the women govern the families, that chaplains are so much in fashion. Trust a churchman ! \u2014 trust a coward with your honour, a fool with your secret, a gamester with your purse, as soon as a priest with your wife or daughter ; look you, guarda ! I am no fool look you. Mrs. Caut. Nay, I know you are a wise man, brother. SCENE II. \u2014 A Room in Don Diego's House. Enter Hippolita, Gerrard, and Prue at a distance. Ger. Am I not come upon your own summons, madam ? and yet receive me so ? Hip. My summons, sir ! no, I assure you ; and if you do not like your reception, I cannot help it ; for I am not used to receive men, I'd have you to know. Ger. She is beautiful beyond all things I ever saw ! [Aside. Don. Why, sister, I have been fifteen years in Spain for it, at several times, look you : now in Hip. I like him extremely ! [Aside."], [138, "THE GENTLEMAN DANCING-MASTER. ACT II, 44 Ger. Come, fairest, why do you frown ? Hip. Ih \u2014 h\u2014 like this man strangely, I was going to say loved him. Courage then, Hippolita ! make use of the only opportunity thou canst have to enfranchise thyself. Women formerly (they say) never knew how to make use of their time till it was past ; but let it not be said so of a young woman of this age. \u2014 My damned aunt will be stir ring presently : \u2014 well, then, courage, I say, Hip polita ! \u2014 thou art full fourteen years old, \u2014 shift for thyself. [Aside. Ger. So ! I have looked upon her so long, till I am grown bashful too. Love and modesty come together like money and covetousness, and the more we have, the less we can show it. I dare not look her in the face now, nor speak a word. Hip. Because I am angry. Ger. I am come on purpose to please you, then ; do not receive me so unkindly. Hip. I tell you, I do not use to receive men. \u2014 There has not been a man in the house before, but my cousin, this twelvemonth, I'd have you to know. Ger. Then you ought to bid me the more wel come, I'd have you to know. Hip. What ! do you mock me too ? I know I am but a home-bred simple girl ; but I thought you gallants of the town had been better bred than to mock a poor girl in her father's own house. I have beard, indeed, 'tis a part of good breeding to mock people behind their backs, but not to their faces. [Aside, Hip What, sir, methinks you look away now 1 Ger. Because you would not look upon me, miss. Hip. Nay, I hope you can't look me in the face, since you have done so rude a thing as to come in at the window upon me. Come, come, when once we women find the men bashful, then we take heart. Now I can look upon you as long as you will ; let's see if you can frown upon me now. Ger. [Aside.] Pretty creature ! she has not only the beauty, but the innocency of an angel. \u2014 [ To Hippolita.] Mock you, dear miss! no, I only repeated the words because they were yours, sweet miss ; what we like we imitate. Hip. Dear miss ! sweet miss ! how came you and I so well acquainted ? this is one of your con fident tricks, too, as I have been told; you'll be acquainted with a woman in the time you can help her over a bench in the playhouse, or to her coach. But I need not wonder at your confidence, since you could come in at the great gallery window just now. But, pray, who shall pay for the glass you have broken ? Ger. Lovely innocency ! no, you may swear I can't frown upon you, miss. Hip. So ! I knew you were ashamed of what you have done. Well, since you are ashamed, and because you did not come of your own head, but was sent by my cousin, you say \u2014 Ger. Which I wonder at. [Aside. Ger. Pretty creature ! your father might have made the window bigger then, since he has so fine a daughter, and will not allow people to come in at the door to her. Hip. For all these reasons, I do forgive you. Ger. In token of your forgiveness then, dearest miss, let me have the honour to kiss your hand. Hip. Nay, there 'tis; you men are like our little shock-dogs, if we don't keep you off from us, but use you a little kindly, you grow so fiddling and so troublesome, there is no enduring you. Ger. O dear miss ! if I am like your shock-dog, let it be in his privileges. Hip. Why, I'd have you to know he does not lie with me. Hip. A pleasant man ! \u2014 well, 'tis harder play ing the hypocrite with him, I see, than with my aunt or father ; and if dissimulation were not very n-itural to a woman, I'm sure I could not use it at this time: but the mask' of simplicity and inno cency is as useful to an intriguing woman as the mask cf leligion to a statesman, they say. {Aside. Ger. Why do you look away, dearest miss ? Hip. Because you quarrelled with me just now for frowning upon you, and I cannot help it, if I look upon you. Ger. O ! let me see that face at any rate. Hip. Would you have me frown upon you ? for I shall be sure to do't. Ger. 'Tis well guessed, miss, for one so innocent. Hip. No, I always kick him off from the bed, and never will let him come near it ; for of late, indeed, (I do not know what's the reason,) I don't much care for my shock-dog, nor my babies. Ger. O then, miss, I may have hopes ! for after the shock-dog and the babies, 'tis the man's turn to be beloved. Ger. Come, I'll stand fair : you have done your worst to my heart already. Hip. Now I dare not look upon him, lest I should not be able to keep my word. [Aside. Ger. Come, I am ready : \u2014 [Aside.] and yet I am afraid of her frowns. \u2014 [To Hippolita.] Come, look, Ih \u2014 am ready, Ih \u2014 am ready. Hip. But I am not ready. [Aside. Ger. Turn, dear miss, come, Ib \u2014 am ready. Hip. Are you ready then ? I'll look. [Turns upon him.] \u2014 No, faith, I cannot frown upon him, if I should be hanged. [Aside. Ger. Dear miss, I thank you, that look has no terror in't. Hip. Why, could you be so good-natured as to come after my shock-dog in my love ? it may be, indeed, rather than after one of your brother men. Ger. Hah, ha, ha! \u2014 poor creature ! a wonder of innocency ! {Aside. Hip. But I see you are humble, because you would kiss my hand. Ger. No, I am ambitious therefore. Hip. [Aside.] Well, all this fooling but loses time, I must make better use of it. [To Gerraro.] I could let you kiss my hand, but then I'm afraid you would take hold of me and carry me away. Ger. Indeed I would not Hip. Come, I know you would. Ger. Truly I would not. Hip. You would ! you would ! I know you wo'ild. Hip. No, I cannot frown for my heart for Mushing, I don't use to look upon men, you must know. Ger. If it were possible anything could, those blushes w.iuld add to her beauty : well, bashfulness is the on'y out- of-fashioned thing that is agreeable. [Aside. Ger. I'll swear I wo' not \u2014 by\u2014"], [139, "THE GENTLEMAN DANCING-MASTER. SCENE 11. 45 Hip. Nay, don't swear, for you'll be the apter to do it then. [Aside.] 1 would not have him for swear it neither ; \u2014 he does not like me, sure, well enough to carry me away. Ger. Dear miss, let me kiss your hand. Hip. I am sure you would carry me away if I should. As they are going out, Prue runs hastily to them. Prue. O miss, miss ! your father, it seems, is just now arrived, and is here coming in upon you. Hip. My father ! Enter Don Diego and Mrs. Caution. Don. My daughter and a man I Mis. Caut. A man! a man in the house ! Ger. Ha ! what mean these ? \u2014 a Spaniard ! Hip. What shall I do ? Stay\u2014 Nay, pray stir not from me ; but lead me about, as if you led me a corant. [Leads her about. Ger. Be not afraid of it. Hip. [Aside.] Nay, I am afraid of the con trary.\u2014Either he dislikes me, and therefore will not be troubled with me, or. what is as bad, he loves me and is dull, or fearful to displease me. Ger. Trust me, sweetest ! I can use no violence to you. Don. Is this your government, sister ? and this your innocent charge, that hath not seen the face of a man this twelvemonth ? en hora mala ! Hip. Nay, I am sure you would carry me away ; what should you come in at the window for, if you did not mean to steal me ? Ger. If I should endeavour it, you might cry out, and I should be prevented. Hip. [Aside.] Dull, dull man of the town ! are all like thee ? He is as dull as a country squire atquestions and commands. \u2014 [To Gerrard.] No, if I should cry out never so loud, this is quite at the further end of the house, and there nobody could hear me. Mrs. Caut. O, sure, it is not a man ! it cannot be a man ! [Puts on her spectacles. Don. It cannot be a man! if he be not aman, he's a devil. He has her lovingly by the hand too, valga me el cielo ! Hip. Do not seem to mind them, but dance on, or lead me about still. Ger. What d'ye mean by it. [Apart to Hippoiita. Don. Hey, they are frolic, a-dancing ! Mrs. Caut. Indeed, they are dancing, I think. \u2014 Why, niece ! Ger. I will not give you the occasion, dearest. Hip. [Aside.] Well, 1 will quicken thy sense, if it be possible. \u2014 [To Gerrard.] Nay, I know you come to steal me away ; because I am an heiress, and have twelve hundred pounds a year, lately left me by my mother's brother, which my father cannot meddle with, and which is the chiefest reason (I suppose) why he keeps me up so close. Ger. Ha! Don. Nay, hold a little: I'll make 'em dance in the devil's name ; but it shall not be, la gail liarda. [Draws his sword. Mrs. Caut. O niece ! why niece ! [Caution holds him. Ger. Do you hear her? what do you mean? [Apart to Hippolita. Hip. Take no notice of them ; but walk about still, and sing a little, sing a corant. Ger. I can't sing: but I'll hum, if you will. Don.

Not any ; 'twas I, I warrant you, sweetest. Hip. So, he understands himself now. [Aside. Ger. Well, madam, since 'twas foretold you, what do you think on't ? 'tis in vain, you know, to resist fate.

Nay, nay, dancing-masters look like gen tlemen enough, sister : but he's no dancing-master, by drawing a sword so briskly.

My cousin sent him ; because, as he said, he would have me recover my dancing a little before our wedding, having made a vow he would never marry a wife who could not dance a corant. I am sure I was unwilling ; but he would have him come, saying I was to be his wife as soon as you came, and therefore expected obedience from me. Don. Indeed, the venture is most his, and the shame would be most his ; for I know here in England, 'tis not the custom for the father to be much concerned what the daughter does ; but I will be a Spaniard still.

Besides, now I think on't, you are a stranger to me ; I know not where you live, nor whither you might carry me. For aught I know, you might be a spirit, and carry me to Barbadoes. Don. Poor innocent ! \u2014 Well, I am contented you should learn to dance, since, for aught I know, you shall be married to-morrow, or the next day at farthest : by that time you may recover a corant \u2014 a saraband I would say. And since your cousin, too, will have a dancing wife, it shall be so ; and I'll see you dance myself. You shall be my charge these two days, and then I dare venture you in the hand of any dancing- master, even a saucy French dancing-master, look you. Mrs. Caut. Well, have a care, though ; for this man is not dressed like a dancing-master. Don. Go, go, you dote ; are they not (for the most part) better dressed and prouder than many a good gentleman ? you would be wiser than I, would you, querno ? Afrs. Caut. Well, I say, only look to't, look to't. Ger. No, dear miss, I would carry you to court, the playhouses, and Hyde-park \u2014 Hip. Nay, I know 'tis the trick of all you that spirit women away, to speak 'em mighty \u00a3air at first : but when you have got 'em in your clutches, you carry 'em into Yorkshire, Wales, or Cornwall, which is as bad as to Barbadoes ; and rather than be served so, I would be a prisoner in London still as I am. Don. Hey, hey ! Come, friend, to your busi ness ; teach her her lesson over again ; let's see. Hip. Come, master. Don. Come, come, let's see your English method ; I understand something of dancing myself \u2014 come. Ger. I see the air of this town, without the plea sures of it, is enough to infect women with an aversion for the country. Well, miss, since it seems you have some diffidence in me, give me leave to visit you as your dancing-master, now you have honoured me with the character ; and under that I may have your father's permission to see you, till you may better know me and my heart, and have a better opportunity to reward it. Hip. I am afraid to know your heart would require a great deal of time ; and my father intends to marry me very suddenly to my cousin, who sent you hither. Ger. Pray, sweet miss, let us make the better use of our time if it be short. But how shall we do with that cousin of yours in the mean time ? we must needs charm him. Hip. Come, master. Ger. I shall betray you yet, dearest miss ; for I know not a step : I could never dance. [Apart to ITippolita. Hip. No! Don. Come- come, child. Hip. Indeed I'm ashamed, father. Don. You must not be ashamed, child ; you'll never dance well if you are ashamed. Hip. Indeed, I can't help it, father. Don. Come, come, I say, go to't. Hip. Indeed I can't, father, before you : 'tis my first lesson, and I shall do it so ill. \u2014 Pray, good father, go into the next room for this once ; and the next time my master comes, you shall see I shall be confident enough. Don. Poor, foolish, innocent creature ! \u2014 Well, well, I will, child. Who but a Spanish kind of a father could have so innocent a daughter in Eng land ? \u2014 Well, I would fain see any one steal or debauch my daughter from me. Hip. Nay, won't you go, father ? Don. Yes, yes, I go, child : we will all go but your maid You can dance before your maid ? Hip. Yes, yes, father : a maid at most times with her mistress is nobody. [Exeunt Diego and Mrs. Caution. Hip. Leave that to me. Ger. But (what's worse) how shall I be able to act a dancing-master, who ever wanted inclination and patience to learn myself? Hip. A dancing-school in half an hour will furnish you with terms of the art. Besides, Love (as I have heard say) supplies his scholars with all sorts of capacities they have need of, in spite of nature : \u2014 but what has love to do with you ? Ger. Love, indeed, has made a grave gouty statesman fight duels, the soldier fly from his colours, a pedant a fine gentleman, nay, and the very lawyer a poet ; and, therefore, may make me a dancing- master.

Let me see \u2014 friend, you must needs come after dinner again, and then at night again, and so three times to-morrow too. If she be not married to-morrow, (which I am to consider of,) she will dance a corant in twice or thrice teaching more ; will she not ? for 'tis but a twelvemonth since she came from Hackney- school.

Angel is a dam English fool to him. Hip. Now, all that I am to desire of you is, to own you sent him, that I may not be caught in a lie. Mons. Yes, yes, a ver good jest : Gerrard a mastre de dance 1 ha ! ha ! ha ! Hip. Nay, the jest is like to be better yet ; for my father himself has obliged him now to come and teach me : so that now he must take the dancing-master upon him, and come three or four times to me before.our wedding, lest my father, if he should come no more, should be suspicious J had told him a lie. And, for aught I know, if he should know, or but guess he were not a dancing master, in his Spanish strictness and punctilios of honour, he might kill me as the shame and stain of his honour and family, which he talks of so much. Now, you know the jealous cruel fathers in Spain serve their poor innocent daughters often so ; and he is more than a Spaniard. Mons. Non, non, fear noting ; I warrant you, he shall come as often as you will to de house ; and your father shall never know who he is till we are married. But then I'll tell him all for the jest's sake. Hip. Methinks, now, Angel is a very good fool. Mons. Nauh, nauh, Nokes is a better fool; but indeed the Englis are not fit to be fools : here are ver few good fools. 'Tis true, you have many a young cavalier who go over into France to learn to be de buffoon ; but, for all dat, dey return but mauvais buffoon, jarnie! Hip. I'm sure, cousin, you have lost no time there. Mons. Auh, le brave Scaramouche ! Hip. But is it a science in France, cousin ? and is there an academy for fooling ? sure none go to it but players. Mons. Dey are comedians dat are de matres : but all the beaux monde go to learn, as they do here of Angel and Nokes. For if you did go abroad into company, you would find the best almost of de nation conning in all places the lessons which dey have learned of the fools dere matres, Nokes and Angel. Hip. Indeed ! Mons. Yes, yes, dey are de gens de quality that practise dat science most, and the most ambitieux ; for fools and buffoons have been always most wel come to courts, and desired in all companies. Auh, to be de fool, de buffoon, is to be de great personage. Hip. Fools have fortune, they say, indeed. Mons. So say old Sen&que. Hip.

Methinks you should be contented in making bold with his daughter (for you have made very bold with her) sure. Ger. I hope I shall make bolder with her yet. Hip I do not doubt your confidence, for you are a dancing-master. Ger. Why, miss, I hope you would not have me a fine, senseless, whining, modest lover; for modesty in a man is as ill as the want of it in a woman. Don. Come, move on, she's mad. Ger. One, two, and a coupee. Don. Come, one, two, and turn out your toes. Mrs. Caut. There, there, he pinched her by the thigh : will you suffer it ? Ger. One, two, three, and fall back. Don.

So, so, mind her not ; she moves forward pretty well ; but you must move as well backward as forward, or you'll never do anything to purpose. Mrs. Caut. Do you know what you say, brother, yourself, now ? are you at your beastliness before your young daughter ? Prue. Ha ! ha ! ha 1 Hip. I thank you for that, sir, now you have made bold with me indeed ; but if I am such a confident piece, I am sure you made me so : if you had not had the confidence to come in at the window, 1 had not had the confidence to look upon a man : I am sure I could not look upon a man before. Ger. But that I humbly conceive, sweet miss, was your father's fault, because you had not a man to look upon. But, dearest miss, I do not think you confident, you are only innocent ; for that which would be called confidence, nay impudence, in a woman of years, is called innocency in one of Don.

Say you so ? has youth such privileges ? I do not wonder then, most women seem impudent, since it is to be thought younger than they are, it seems. But indeed, master, you are as great an encourager of impudence, I see, as if you were a dancing-master in good earnest. Ger. Yes, yes, a young thing may do anything; may leap out of the window and go away with her dancing-master, if she please. Hip. So, so, the use follows the doctrine very suddenly. Ger. Well, dearest, pray let us make the use we should of it ; lest your father should make too bold with us, and come in before we would have him. Mrs. Caut. And I fear just undone, sir. Ger.

Come, dear miss, let me tell you how I have designed, matters ; for in talking of anything else we lose time and opportunity. People abroad indeed say, the English women are the worst in the world in usiog an opportunity, they love tittle tattle and ceremony. Hip. 'Tis because, I warrant, opportunities are not so scarce here as abroad, they have more here than they can use ; but let people abroad say what they will of English women, because they do not know 'era, but what say people at home ? Ger. Pretty innocent! ha! ha! ha! \u2014 Well, I say you will not make use of your opportunity. Hip. I say, you have no reason to say so yet. Ger.

Don. What ! I warrant you are like the rest of the young silly baggages of England, that like nothing but what is French ?

Well, thou art a geuerous man, I vow and swear, to come and take upon you all this trouble, danger, and shame, to be thought a paltry dancing-master ; and all this to preserve a lady's honour and life, who intended to abuse you.

Your servant, sir : I protest I did not know you at first.\u2014 [Aside ] I am afraid this fool should spoil all, notwithstanding Hippolita's care and management ; yet I ought to trust her : \u2014 but a secret is more safe with a treacherous knave than a talkative fool. Don. Well, honest friend, you are very punctual, which is a rare virtue in a dancing-master ; I take notice of it, and will remember it; I will, look you. Alons. So, silly, damned, politic Spanish uncle! \u2014 ha ! ha ! ha ! {Aside. Ger. My fine scholar, sir, there, shall never have reason, as I have told you, sir, to say I am not a punctual man ; for I am more her servant than to any scholar I ever had. Alons.

You look like a Spaniard, and talk like an Englishman again, which I thought bad been impossible. Mons. Nothing impossible to love : I must do't, or lose my mistress, your pretty scholar ; for 'tis I am to have her. You may remember I ti Id you she was to be married to a great man, a man of honour and quality. Ger. But does she enjoin you to this severe penance ? \u2014 such I am sure it is to you. Mons. No, no : 'tis by the compulsion of the starched fop her father, who is so arrant a Span iard, he wouM kill you and his daughter, if he knew who you were : therefore have a special care to dis semble well. [Draws him aside. Hip. Indeed, it shall go hard but I'll be a grateful, kind scholar to you. Airs. Caut. As kind as ever your mother was to your father, I warrant. Don.

Come, come, I cannot but speak : I tell you, beware in time ; for he is no dancing master, but some debauched person, who will mump you of your daughter. Don. Will you be wiser than I still ?

[Exit Black.] \u2014 I say, dear Gerrard, faith, I'm obliged to you for the trouble you have had. When I sent you, I intended a jest indeed ; but did not think it would have been so dangerous a jest : therefore pray forgive me. Ger. I do, do heartily forgive you. ATons. But can yo forgive me for sending you Mrs. Caut. He ! he does not go about his business like a dancing-master.

Nay, pray, father, be pleased to go out a little, and let us but practise awhile, and then you shall see me dance the whole dance to the violin. Hip. No, no ; I'd have you go out and hold the door, cousin ; or see, my father will come in again before his time. Mons.

So I did, father : but let me practise a little first before, that I may be perfect. Besides, my aunt is here, and she will put me out : you know I cannot dance before her. Hip.

Yes ; but it goes against my conscience to be accessary to so ill a thing. \u2014 You say you do it for my sake ? Ger. Alas, poor miss !

Ger. Prithee do not talk so sillily. Ger. The fool has reason, I find, and I am the coxcomb while I thought him so. [Aside. Mons. Come, I see you are uneasy, and the jest of being a dancing-master grows tedious to you : \u2014 but have a little patience; the parson is sent for, and when once my cousin and I are married, my uncle may know who you are. Ger. I am certainly abused. [Aside. Alons. [Listening.] What do you say ? Ger. Merely fooled ! [Aside. Mons. Why do you doubt it ? ha ! ha ! ha! Ger. Can it be ?

Hip. Because you will ne'er draw your sword, perhaps. Mons. [Aside.] Scurvily guessed. \u2014 [Aloud.] You ladies may say anything ; but, cousin, pray do not you talk of swords and fighting ; meddle with your guitar, and talk of dancing with your dancing-master there, ha ! ha ! ha ! Hip. But I am afraid you have hurt my master, cousin :\u2014 he says nothing ; can he draw his breath ? Mons. No, 'tis you have hurt your master, cousin, in the very heart, cousin, and therefore he would hurt me ; for love is a disease makes people as malicious as the plague does. Hip. Indeed, poor master, something does ail you. Ger. Faith, I am afraid I shall first beat you into an ill-humour. Alons. Ha ! ha ! ha ! that thou shouldst be gulled so by a little gipsy, who left off her bib but yesterday ! \u2014 faith I can't but laugh at thee. Ger.

I will match your Spanish ear, thus, sir, and make you dance thus. {Strikes and kicks him. Alons. How! sa! sa! sa! then I'll make you dance thus. Alons. Nay, nay, cousin, faith don't abuse him any longer; he's an honest gentleman, and has been long of my acquaintance, and a man of toler able sense, to take him out of his love ; but prithee, cousin, don't drive the jest too far for my sake. [Monsieur draws his sword and runs at him, but Gerrard drawing, he retires. Hold! hold a little! \u2014 [Aside.] A desperate disap pointed lover will cut his own throat, then sure he will make nothing of cutting his rival's throat. Ger. Consideration is an enemy to fighting ; if you have a mind to revenge yourself, your sword's in your hand. Mons. Pray, sir, hold your peace ; I'll ne'er take my rival's counsel, be't what 'twill. I know what you would be at ; you are disappointed of your mistress, and could hang yourself, and there fore will not fear hanging. But I am a successful lover, and need neither hang for you nor my mis tress : nay, if I should kill you, I know I should do you a kindness ; therefore e'en live, to die daily with envy of my happiness. But if you will needs die, kill yourself, and be damned for me, I vow and swear. Ger. He counsels you well, pleasant, cunning, jilting miss, for his sake ; for if I am your divertise ment, it shall be at his cost, since he's your gallant in favour. Hip. I don't understand you. Alons. But I do, a pox take him ! and the custom that so orders it, forsooth ! that if a lady abuse or affront a man, presently the gallant must be beaten ; nay, what's more unreasonable, if a woman abuse her husband, the poor cuckold must bear the shame as well as the injury. {Aside. Hip. But what's the matter, master? what was it you said ? Ger. I say, pleasant, cunning, jilting lady, though you make him a cuckold, it will not be revenge enough for me upon him for marrying you. Hip. How ! my surly, huffing, jealous, senseless, saucy master ? Mons. Nay, nay, faith, give losers leave to speak, losers of mistresses especially, ha ! ha ! ha ! Besides, your anger is too great a favour for him ; I scorn to honour him with mine you see. Hip. I tell you my saucy master, my cousin shall never be made that monstrous thing you mention, by me. Alons. Thank you, I vow and swear, cousin ; no, no, I never thought I should. Ger. Sure you marry him by the sage maxim of your sex, which is, wittols make the best husbands, that is cuckolds. Ger. But won't you fight for your mistress ? Mons. I tell you, you shall not have the honour to be killed for her ; besides, I will not be hit in the teeth by her as long as I live, with the great love you had for her. Women speak well of their dead husbands ; what will they do of their dead gallants ? Ger. But if you will not fight for her, you shall dance for her, since you desired me to teach you to dance too : \u2014 I'll teach you to dance thus \u2014 {Strikes his sword al his legs, Monsieur leaps. Mons. Nay, if it be for the sake of my mistress, there's nothing I will refuse to do. Ger. Nay, you must dance on. Mons. Ay, ay, for my mistress, and sing too, la, la, la, ra, la.

Ha 1 ha ! ha! there she was with him, i'faith : \u2014 I thank you for that, cousin, I vow and swear. Hip. Nay, he shall thank me for that too : \u2014 but how came you two to quarrel ? I thought, cousin, you had had more wit than to quarrel, or more kindness for me than to quarrel here. What if my father, hearing the bustle, should have come in? he would have soon discovered our false dancing master (for passion unmasks every man), and then the result of your quarrel had been my ruin. Mons. Nay, you had both felt his desperate, deadly, daunting dagger : \u2014 there are your de's for you ! Hip. What's the matter, cousin ? Mons. Nothing, nothing, cousin, but your pre sence is a sanctuary for my greatest enemy, or else, teste non! \u2014 Hip. What, you have not hurt my cousin, sir, I hope ? [To Gerrard. Ger.

Go, go presently therefore, and hinder my father from coming in, whilst I put my master into a better humour, that we may not be discovered, to the prevention of our wedding, or worse when he comes ; go, go. fiddlers, as you had done of your gentleman dan cing-master. Hip. I intended 'em for our guard and defence against my father's Spanish and Guinea force, when we were to make our retreat from hence ; and to help us to take the keys from my aunt, who has been the watchful porter of this house this twelve month ; and this design (if your heart do not fail you) we will put in execution as soon as you have given your friends below instructions. Ger. Are you sure your heart will stand right still ? You flinched last night, when I little expected it, I am sure. Hip. The time last night was not so proper for us as now, for reasons 1 will give you. But besides that, I confess I had a mind to try whether your interest did not sway you more than your love ; whether the twelve hundred pounds a year I told you of had not made a greater impression in your heart than Hippolita : but finding it other wise \u2014 yet hold, perhaps upon consideration you ore grown wiser ; can you yet, as I said, be so des perate, so out of fashion, as to steal a woman with nothing? Ger. With you I can want nothing, nor can be made by anything more rich or happy. Hip. Think well again ; can you take me with out the twelve hundred pounds a-year, \u2014 the twelve hundred pounds a-year ? Ger. Indeed, miss, now you begin to be unkind again, and use me worse than e'er you did. Hip. Well, though you are so modest a gentle man as to suffer a wife to be put upon you with nothing, I have more conscience than to do it. I have the twelve hundred pounds a-year out of my father's power, which is yours, and I am sorry it is not the Indies to mend your bargain. Ger. Dear miss, you but increase my fears, and not my wealth. Pray let us make haste away ; I desire but to be secure of you : \u2014 come, what are you thinking of? Hip. I am thinking if some little, filching, inquisitive poet should get my story, and represent it to the stage, what those ladies who are never precise but at a play would say of me now ; \u2014 that I were a confident, coming piece, 1 warrant, and they would damn the poor poet for libelling the sex. But sure, though I give myself and fortune away frankly, without the consent of my friends, my confidence is less than theirs who stand off only for separate maintenance. Ger. They would be widows before their time, have a husband and no husband : \u2014 but let us be gone, lest fortune should recant my happiness, now you are fixed, my dearest miss. [He kisses her hand. Alons. Well, well, I will, cousin. Hip. Be sure you let him not come in this good while. Alons. No, no, I warrant you. \u2014 [Goes out and returns.] \u2014 But if he should come before I would have him, I'll come before him, and cough and hawk soundly, that you may not be surprised. Won't that do well, cousin ? Hip. Very well, pray begone. \u2014 [Exit Mon sieur.] Well, master, since I find you are quarrelsome and melancholy, and would have taken me away without a portion, three infallible signs of a true lover, faith here's my hand now in earnest, to lead me a dance as long as I live. Ger. How's this ! you surprise me as much, as when first I found so much beauty and wit in com pany with so much innocency. But, dearest, I would be assured of what you say, and yet dare not ask the question. You h \u2014 \u25a0 \u2014 do not abuse me again ? You h will fool me no more sure ? Hip. Yes, but I will sure. Ger. How ? nay, I was afraid on't. Hip. For, I say, you are to be my husband, and you say husbands must be wittols, and some strange things to boot. Ger. Well, I will take my fortune. Hip. But have a care, rash man. Ger. I will venture. Hip. At your peril ; remember I wished you to have a care : forewarned, fore-armed. Prue. Indeed now, that's fair ; for most men are fore-armed before they are warned. Hip Plain dealing is some kind of honesty however, and few women would have said so much. Ger. None but those who would delight in a husband's jealousy, as the proof of his love and her honour. Hip. Hold, sir, let us have a good understand ing betwixt one another at first, that we may be long friends. I differ from you in the point ; for a husband's jealousy, which cunning men would pass upon their wives for a compliment, is the worst can be made 'em ; for indeed it is a compliment to their beauty, but an affront to their honour. Ger. But, madam \u2014 Hip. So that upon the whole matter I conclude, jealousy in a gallant is humble true love, and the height of respect, and only an undervaluing of himself to overvalue her ; but in a husband 'tis arrant sauciness, cowardice, and ill-breeding, and not to be suffered. Re-enter Mousieur, coughing, followed byTlon Diego. Ger. I stand corrected, gracious miss. Hip. Well, but have you brought the gentlemen fiddlers with you, as I desired ? Ger. They are below. Hip. Are they armed well ? Ger. Yes, they have instruments too that are not of wood ; but what will you do with them ? Hip. What did you think I intended to dp with them ? when I whispered you to bring gentlemen of your acquaintance instead of fiddlers, as my father desired you to bring, pray what did you think I intended : Hip. Oh, here's my father ! Don. How now, sir !\u2014 What, kissing her hand ! what means that, friend, ha ? \u2014 Daughter, ha ! do you permit this insolence, ha ? voto a mi hora ! Ger. We are prevented again. [Aside to Hippolita. Hip. Ha ! ha ! ha ! you are so full of your Spanish jealousy, father ; why, you must know he is a city dancing-master, and they, forsooth, think it fine to kiss the hand at the honour before the corant.

He'll make now ado about nothing, and you'll be discovered both. Don. Umph, umph, \u2014 no, no, I see it plain, he is no dancing-master : now I have found it out, and I think I can see as far into matters as another : I have found it now, look you. Ger.

No, no, you were to marry me, man, to her ; I knew there was a mistake in't somehow ; you were merely mistaken, therefore you must do your business over again for me now. \u2014 The parson was mistaken, uncle, it seems, hal ha! ha! Mrs. Caut. I suppose five or six guineas made him make the mistake, which will not be rectified now, nephew. They'll marry all that come near 'em, and, for a guinea or two, care not what mis chief they do, nephew. Don. Married! \u2014 Pedro! Sanchez! Mons. Nor wives neither now. Flirt. Then separate maintenance, in case you should take a wife, or I a new friend. Mons. How! that too ! then you are every whit as bad as a wife. Flirt. Then my house in town and yours in the country, if you will. Mons. A mere wife ! Flirt. Then my coach apart, as well as my bed apart. Mons. As bad as a wife still ! Flirt. But take notice, I will have no little, dirty, second-hand chariot new furbished, but a large, sociable, well-painted coach ; nor will I keep it till it be as well known as myself, and it come to be called Flirt-coach ; nor will I have such pitiful horses as cannot carry me every night to the Park ; for I will not miss a night in the Park, I'd have you to know. Mons. 'Tis very well : you must have your great, gilt, fine painted coaches. I'm sure they are grown so common already amongst you, that ladies of quality begin to take up with hackneys again, jarnie ! \u2014 But what else i Mons. How ! and must she be his wife then for ever and ever ? have I held the door then for this, like a fool as I was ? Mrs. Caut. Yes, indeed! Mons.

But methinks ray Spanish policy might help me yet. I have it \u2014 so \u2014 I will cheat 'em all ; for I will declare I under stood the whole plot and contrivance, and connived at it, finding my cousin a fool, and not answering my expectation. Well, but then if I approve of the match, I must give this mock -dancing- master my estate, especially since half he would have in right of my daughter, and in spite of me. Well, I am resolved to turn the cheat upon themselves, and give them my consent and estate. Mons. Come, come, ne'er be troubled, uncle : 'twas a combination, you see, of all these heads and your daughter's, you know what I mean, uncle, not to be thwarted or governed by all the Spanish policy in Christendom. I'm sure my French policy would not have governed her : so since I have 'scaped her, I am glad I have 'scaped her, jarnie ! Mrs. Caut. Come, brother, you are wiser than I, you see : ay, ay. Don. No, you think you are wiser than I now, in earnest : but know, while I was thought a gull, I gulled you all, and made them and you think I knew nothing of the contrivance. Confess, did not you think verily that I knew nothing of it, and that I was a gull ? Mrs. Caut. Yes indeed, brother, I did think verily you were a gull. Mons. What then ? Flirt. Then, that you never grow jealous of them. Mons. Why, will you make so much of them ? Flirt. I delight to be kind to my servants. Mons. Well, is this all ? Flirt. No. \u2014 Then, that when you come to my house, you never presume to touch a key, lift up a latch, or thrust a door, without knocking before hand : and that you ask no questions, if you see a stray piece of plate, cabinet, or looking-glass, in my house. Mons. Just a wife in everything But what else ? Flirt. Then, that you take no acquaintance with me abroad, nor bring me home any when you are drunk, whom you will not be willing to see there when you are sober. Mons. But what allowance ? let's come to the main business ; the money. Flirt. Stay, let me think : first for advance money, five hundred pounds for pins. Mons. A very wife ! Flirt. Then you must take the lease of my house, and furnish it as becomes one of my quality ; for don't you think we'll take up with your old Queen Elizabeth furniture, as your wives do. Mons. Indeed there she is least like a wife, as she says. Hip. How's this? [Listening. Don. Alas, alas ! all the sputter I made was but to make this young man, my cousin, believe, when the thing should be effected, that it was not with my connivance or consent : but since he is so well satisfied, I own it. For do you think I would ever have suffered her to marry a monsieur, a monsieur ? guarda! \u2014 besides, it had been but a beastly inces tuous kind of a match, voto ! \u2014 Flirt. Then for house-keeping, servants' wages, clothes, and the rest, I'll be contented with a thousand pounds a year present maintenance, and but three hundred pounds a year separate mainte nance for my life, when your love grows cold. But I am contented with a thousand pounds a year, because for pendants, neck-laces, and all sorts of jewels, and such trifles, nay, and some plate, I will shift myself as I can ; make shifts, which you shall not take any notice of. Mons. A thousand pounds a year ! what will wenching come to ? Time was a man might have fared as well at a much cheaper rate, and a lady of one's affections, instead of a house, would have been contented with a little chamber, three pair of stairs backward, with a little closet or ladder to't ; and instead of variety of new gowns and rich petti coats, with her dishabillie, or flame-colour gown called Indian, and slippers of the same, would have been contented for a twelvemonth ; and instead of visits and gadding to plays, would have entertained herself at home with St. George for England^ The Knight of the Sun, or, The Practice of Piety ; and instead of sending her wine and meat from the French-houses, would have been contented, if yon had given her, poor wretch, but credit at the next chandler's and chequered cellar ; and then, instead of a coach, would have been well satisfied to have gone out and taken the air for three or four hours in the evening in the balcony, poor soul. Well, Flirt, however, we'll agree: \u2014 'tis but three hundred pounds a year separate maintenance, you say, when I am weary of thee and the charge. Don. [Aside.]\u2014 Robbed of my honour, my daughter, and my revenge too ! O my dear honour! Nothing vexes me, but that the world should say I Mrs. Caut. Nay, then I see, brother, you are wiser than I indeed. Ger. So, so. Mrs. Caut.

Nay, if I had your Spanish policy against me, it was no wonder I missed of my aim, mon soy ! Don. I was resolved too my daughter should not marry a coward, therefore made the more ado to try you, sir. But I find you are a brisk man of honour, firm stiff Spanish honour ; and that you may see I deceived you all along, and you not me, ay, and am able to deceive you still, for I know now you think that I will give you little or nothing with my daughter, like other fathers, since you have married her without my consent \u2014 but, I say, I'll deceive you now ; for you shall have the most part of my estate in present, and the rest at my death. \u2014 There's for you : I think I have deceived you now, look you.

But would take quarter from your saving hands, Though Bays within all yielding countermands, Says, you confederate wits no quarter give, Therefore his play shan't ask your leave to live. Well, let the vain rash fop, by huffing so, Think to obtain the better terms of you ; But we, the actors, humbly will submit, Now, and at any time, to a full pit ; Nay, often we anticipate your rage, And murder poets for you on our stage : We set no guards upon our tiring-room, But when with flying colours there you come, We patiently, you see, give up to you Our poets, virgins, nay, our matrons too. Poets, like cudgell'd bullies, never do At first or second blow submit to you ; But will provoke you still, and ne'er have done, Till you are weary first with laying on. The late so baffled scribbler of this day, Though he stands trembling, bids me boldly say, What we before most plays are used to do, For poets out of fear first draw on you ; In a fierce prologue the still pit defy, And, ere you speak, like Castril give the lie. But though our Bays's battles oft I've fought, And with bruised knuckles their dear conquests bought ; Nay, never yet l'ear'd odds upon the stage, In prologue dare not hector with the age ; ACT I.

And cry, Homer's coming to carry you away. 1 am only afraid 'twill not be believed. You told 'em it was by an English-French disas ter, and an English-French chirurgeon, who has given me at once not only a cure, but an antidote for the future against that damned malady, and that worse distemper, love, and all other women's evils ? Sir Jasp. A husband ! how, sir ? Horn. So, sir ; but I make no more cuckolds, sir. [Makes horns. Sir Jasp. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Mercury ! Mercury ! Lady Fidg Pray, sir Jasper, let us be gone from this rude fellow. Quack. Your late journey into France has made it the more credible, and your being here a fort night before you appeared in public, looks as if you apprehended the shame, which I wonder you do not. Well, I have been hired by young gallants to belie 'em t'other way ; but you are the first would be thought a man unfit for women. Horn. Dear Mr. doctor, let vain rogues be con tented only to be thought abler men than they are, generally 'tis all the pleasure they have ; but mine lies another way. Quack. You take, methinks, a very preposterous way to it, and as ridiculous as if we operators in physic should put forth bills to disparage our medi caments, with hopes to gain customers. Horn. Doctor, there are quacks in love as well as physic, who get but the fewer and worse patients foi their boasting ; a good name is seldom got by giving it one's self ; and women, no more than honour, are compassed by bragging. Come, come, doctor, the wisest lawyer never discovers the merits of his cause till the trial ; the wealthiest man con ceals his riches, and the cunning gamester his play. Shy husbands and keepers, like old rooks, are not to be cheated but by a new unpractised trick : false friendship will now no more than false dice upon 'em ; no, not in the city. Dain. Who, by his breeding, would think he had ever been in France ? Lady Fidg. Foh ! he's but too much a French fellow, such as hate women of quality and virtue for their love to their husbands. Sir Jasper, a woman is hated by 'em as much for loving her husband as for loving their money. But pray let's be gone. Horn. You do well, madam ; for I have nothing that you came for. I ha^e brought over not so much as a bawdy picture, no new postures, nor the second part of the Ecole des Filles ; nor \u2014 Quack.

Now, I think, I, or you yourself rather, have done your business with the women. Horn. Thou art an ass. Don't you see already, upon the report and my carriage, this grave man of business leaves his wife in my lodgings, invites me to his house and wife, who before would not be acquainted with me out of jealousy ? Horn. Who do you call shadows of men ? Dor. Half-men. Horn. What, boys ? Dor. Ay, your old boys, old beaux garcons, who, like superannuated stallions, are suffered to run, feed, and whinny with the mares as long as they live, though they can do nothing else. Horn. Well, a pox on love and wenching ! Women serve but to keep a man from better com pany. Though I can't enjoy them, I shall you the more. Good fellowship and friendship are lasting, rational, and manly pleasures. Har. For all that, give me some of those plea sures you call effeminate too ; they help to relish one another. Quack. Nay, by this means you may be the more acquainted with the husbands, but the less with the wives. Horn. Let me alone ; if I can but abuse the husbands, I'll soon disabuse the wives. Stay \u2014 I'll reckon you up the advantages I am like to have by my stratagem. First, I shall be rid of all my old acquaintances, the most insatiable sort of duns, that invade our lodgings in a morning ; and next to the pleasure of making a new mistress is that of being rid of an old one, and of all old debts. Love, when it comes to be so, is paid the most unwillingly. Quack. Well, you may be so rid of your old acquaintances ; but how will you get any new ones ? Horn. Doctor, thou wilt never make a good chemist, thou art so incredulous and impatient. Ask but all the young fellows of the town if they do not lose more time, like huntsmen, in starting the game, than in running it down. One knows not where to find 'em ; who will or will not. Women of quality are so civil, you can hardly dis tinguish love from good breeding, and a man is often mistaken : but now I can be sure she that shows an aversion to me loves the sport, as those women that are gone, whom I warrant to be right. And then the next thing is, your women of honour, as you call 'em, are only chary of their reputations, not their persons ; and 'tis scandal they would avoid, not men. Now may I have, by the reputa tion of a eunuch, the privileges of one, and be seen in a lady's chamber in a morning as early as her husband; kiss virgins before their parents or lovers ; and may be, in short, the pars-par-tout of the town. Now, doctor. Quack. Nay, now you shall be the doctor ; and your process is so new that we do not know but it may succeed. Horn. Not so new neither ; probatum est, doctor. Horn. They disturb one another. Har. No, mistresses are like books. If you pore upon them too much, they doze you, and make you unht for company ; hut if used discreetly, you are the fitter for conversation by 'em. Dor. A mistress should be like a little country retreat near the town ; not to dwell in constantly, but only for a night and away, to taste the town the better when a man returns. Horn. I tell you, 'tis as hard to be a good fel low, a good friend, and a lover of women, as 'tis to be a good fellow, a good friend, and a lover of money. You cannot follow both, then choose your side. Wine gives you liberty, love takes it away. Dor. Gad, he's in the right on't. Horn. Wine gives you joy ; love, grief and tor tures, besides surgeons. Wine makes us witty ; love, only sots. Wine makes us sleep; love breaks it. Dor. By the world he has reason, Harcourt. Horn. Wine makes \u2014 Dor. Ay, wine makes us \u2014 makes us princes ; love makes us beggars, poor rogues, egad \u2014 and wine \u2014 Horn. So, there's one converted. \u2014 No, no, love and wine, oil and vinegar. Har.

His company is as troublesome to us as a cuckold's when you have a mind to his wife's. I'm sure there was never a fine new sign there yesterday. \u2014 Yes, but there was, said I again ; and it came out of France, and has been there a fort night. Dor. A pox !

No, the rogue will not let us enjoy one another, but ravishes our conversation ; though he signifies no more to't than sir Martin Marall's gaping, and awkward thrumming upon the lute, does to his man's voice and music. Horn. But the devil take me if thine be the sign of a jest. Spark. With that they all fell a-laughing, till they bepissed themselves. What, but it does not move you, methinks ? Well, I see one had as good go to law without a witness, as break a jest without a laughter on one's side. \u2014 Come, come, sparks, but where do we dine ? I have left at Whitehall an earl, to dine witb you. Dor. Why, I thought thou hadst loved a man with a title, better than a suit with a French trim ming to't. Dor. And to pass for a wit in town shows him self a fool every night to us, that are guilty of the plot. Horn. Such wits as he are, to a company of reasonable men, like rooks to the gamesters ; who only fill a room at the table, but are so far from contributing to the play, that they only serve to spoil the fancy of those that do. Dor. Nay, they are used like rooks too, snubbed, checked, and abused; yet the rogues will hang on. Horn. A pox on 'em, and all that force nature, and would be still what she forbids 'em 1 Affecta tion is her greatest monster. Har. Go Lo him again. Spark. No, sir, a wit to me is the greatest title in the world. Har. Most men are the contraries to that they would seem. Your bully, you see, is a coward with a long sword ; the little humbly-fawning physician, with his ebony cane, is he that destroys men. Horn. But go dine with your earl, sir ; he may be exceptious. We are your friends, and will not take it ill to be left, I do assure you. Har. Nay, faith, he shall go to him. Spark. Nay, pray, gentlemen. Dor.

Yes ; but you'll De so bitter then. Spark. Honest Dick and Frank here shall answer for me ; I will not be extreme bitter, by the universe. Horn. Even where you will. Spark. At Chateline's ? Dog . Yes, if you will. Spark. Or at the Cock ? Dor. Yes, if you please. Spark. Or at the Dog and Partridge ? Horn. Ay, if you have a mind to't ; for we shall dine at neither. Har. We will be bound in a ten thousand pound bond, he shall not be bitter at all. Dor. Nor sharp, nor sweet. Horn. What, not downright insipid ? Spark. Nay then, since you are so brisk, and provoke me, take what follows. You must know, I was discoursing and rallying with some ladies yesterday, and they happened to talk of the fine new signs in town \u2014 Horn. Very fine ladies, I believe. Spark. Said 1, I know where the best new sign is. \u2014 Where ? says one of the ladies. \u2014 In Covent- Garden, I replied. \u2014 Said another, In what street ? \u2014 In Russel-street, answered I. \u2014 Lord, says another, Spark. Pshaw ! with your fooling we shall lose the new play ; and I would no more miss seeing a new play the first day, than I would miss sitting in the wits' row. Therefore I'll go fetch my mistress, and away. [Exit. Enter Mr. Pinchwipe. Horn. Who have we here ? Pinchwife ? Pinch. Gentlemen, your humble servant. Horn. Well, Jack, by thy long absence from the"], [167, "!CENE I. THE COUNTRY WIFE. 73 town, the grumness of thy countenance, and the slovenliness of thy habit, I should give thee joy, should I not, of marriage ? Pinch- [Aside.] Death ! does he know I'm married too r I thought to have concealed it from him at least. \u2014 [Aloud.] My long stay in the country will excuse my dress ; and I have a suit of law that brings me up to town, that puts me out of humour. Besides, I must give Sparkish to-morrow five thousand pounds to lie with my sister. Horn. Nay, you country gentlemen, rather than not purchase, will buy anything ; and he is a cracked title, if we may cpuibble. Well, but am I to give thee joy ? I heard thou wert married. Pinch. What then ? cent, will not know the difference betwixt a man of one-and-twenty and one of forty. Horn. Nine \u2014 to my knowledge. But if she be silly, she'll expect as much from a man of forty nine, as from him of one-and-twenty. But me thinks wit is more necessary than beauty ; and I think no young woman ugly that has it, and no handsome woman agreeable without it. Pinch. 'Tis my maxim, he's a fool that marries ; but he's a greater that does not marry a fool. What is wit in a wife good for, but to make a man a cuckold ? Horn. Yes, to keep it from his knowledge. Pinch. A fool cannot contrive to make her hus- band a cuckold. Horn. Why, the next thing that is to be heard, is, thou'rt a cuckold. Pinch. Insupportable name ! [Aside. Horn. But I did not expect marriage from such a whoremaster as you ; one that knew the town so much, and women so well. Horn. No ; but she'll club with a man that can : and what is worse, if she cannot make her husband a cuckold, she'll make him jealous, and pass for one : and then 'tis all one. Pinch. Well, well, I'll take care for one. My wife shall make me no cuckold, though she had your help, Mr. Horner. I understand the town, sir. Dor. His help ! [Aside. Har. He's come newly to town, it seems, and has not heard how things are with him. [Aside. Horn. But tell me, has marriage cured thee of whoring, which it seldom does ? Har. 'Tis more than age can do. Horn. No, the word is, I'll marry and live honest: but a marriage vow is like a penitent gamester's oath, and entering into bonds and penalties to stint himself to such a particular small sum at play for the future, which makes him but the more eager ; and not being able to hold out, loses his money again, and his forfeit to boot. Dor. Ay, ay, a gamester will be a gamester whilst his money lasts, and a whoremaster whilst his vigour. Pinch. Why, I have married no London wife. Horn. Pshaw ! that's all one. That grave cir cumspection in marrying a country wife, is like refusing a deceitful pampered Smithfield jade, to go and be cheated by a friend in the country. Pinch. [Aside.] A pox on him and his simile ' \u2014 [Aloud.] At least we are a little surer of the breed there, know what her keeping has been, whether foiled or unsound. Horn. Come, come, I have known a clap gotten in Wales ; and there are cousins, justices' clerks, and chaplains in the country, I won't say coach men. But she's handsome and young ? Pinch. [Aside.] I'll answer as I should do. \u2014 [Aloud.] No, no; she has no beauty but her youth, no attraction but her modesty : wholesome, homely, and huswifely ; that's all. Dor. He talks as like a grazier as he looks. Pinch. She's too awkward, ill-favoured, and silly to bring to town. Har. Nay, I have known 'em, when they are broke, and can lose no more, keep a fumbling with the box in their hands to fool with only, and hinder other gamesters. Dor. That had wherewithal to make lusty stakes. Pinch. Well, gentlemen, you may laugh at me ; but you shall never lie with my wife : I know the town. Har. Then methinks you should bring her to be taught breeding. Pinch. To be taught ! no, sir, I thank you. Good wives and private soldiers should be ignorant \u2014 I'll keep her from your instructions, I warrant you. Horn. But prithee, was not the way you were in better ? is not keeping better than marriage ? Pinch. A pox on't ! the jades would jilt me, I could never keep a whore to myself. Horn. So, then you only married to keep a whore to yourself. Well, but let me tell you, women, as you say, are like soldiers, made constant and loyal by good pay, rather than by oaths and covenants. Therefore I'd advise my friends to keep rather than marry, since too I find, by your example, it does not serve one's turn ; for I saw you yesterday in the eighten-penny place with a pretty country wench. Pinch. How the devil ! did he see my wife then ? I sat there that she might not be seen. But she shall never go to a play again. [Aside. Horn. What ! dost thou blush, at nine-and-forty, for having been seen with a wench? Dor. No, faith, I warrant 'twas his wife, which he seated there out of sight ; for he's a cunning rogue, and understands the town. Har. He blushes. Then 'twas his wife ; for men are now more ashamed to be seen with them in public than with a wench. Har. The rogue is as jealous as if his wife were not ignorant. [Aside. Horn. Why, if she be ill-favoured, there will be less danger here for you than by leaving her in the country. We have such variety of dainties that we are seldom hungry. Dor. But they have always coarse, constant, swingeing stomachs in the country. Har. Foul feeders indeed ! Dor. And your hospitality is great there. Har. Open house ; every man's welcome. Pinch. So, so, gentlemen. Horn. But prithee, why shouldst thou marry her ? If she be ugly, ill-bred, and silly, she must be rich then. Pinch. As rich as if she brought me twenty thousand pound out of this town ; for she'll be as sure not to spend her moderateportion, as a London baggage would be to spend hers, let it be what it would : so 'tis all one. Then, because she's ugly, she's the likelier to be my own ; and being ill-bred, she'll hate conversation ; and since silly and inno-"], [168, "THE COUNTRY WIFE. 74 ACT II. Pinch. Treat me !

I must ; I have business at home. Horn. But prithee, was it thy wife ? She was exceeding pretty : I was in love with her at that distance. [Exit. Har. To beat his wife.

I cannot ; I will not. Horn. Why, 'tis as hard to find an old whore master without jealousy and the gout, as a young one without fear, or the pox : \u2014 As gout in age from pox in youth proceeds, So wenching past, then jealousy succeeds ; The worst disease that love and wenching breeds.

Brother, you are my only censurer ; and the honour of your family will sooner suffer in your wife there than in me, though I take the innocent liberty of the town. Pinch. Hark you, mistress, do nottalk so before my wife. \u2014 The innocent liberty of the town ! Alith. Why, pray, who boasts of any intrigue with me ? what lampoon has made my name noto rious ? what ill women frequent my lodgings? I keep no company with any women of scandalous reputations. Pinch. No, you keep the men of scandalous reputations company. Alith. Where? would you not hive me civil? answer 'em in a box at the plays, in the drawing room at Whitehall, in St. James's-park, Mulberry garden, or \u2014 - Pinch. Hold, hold ! do not teach my wife where the men are to be found : I believe she's the worse for your town-documents already. I bid you keep her in ignorance, as I do. Mrs. Pinch.

Mrs. Margery Pinchwife and Alithea. Mr. PiNCHwrPE peeping behind at the door. Mrs. Pinch. Pray, sister, where are the best fields and woods to walk in, in London ? Alith. [Aside.] A pretty question! \u2014 [Aloud] Why, sister, Mulberry-garden and St. James's park ; and, for close walks, the New Exchange. Mrs. Pinch. Pray, sister, tell me why my hus band looks so grum here in town, and keeps me up so close, and will not let me go a-walking, nor let me wear my best gown yesterday. Alith. O, he's jealous, sister. Mrs. Pinch. Jealous ! what's that ? Alith. He's afraid you should love another man. Mrs. Pinch. How should he be afraid of my loving another man, when he will not let me see any but himself? Alith. Did he not carry you yesterday to a play ? Mrs. Pinch. Ay ; but we sat amongst ugly peo ple. He would not let me come near the gentry, who sat under us, so that I could not see 'em. He told me, none but naughty women sat there, whom they toused and moused. But I would have ven tured, for all that. Alith But how did you like the play ? Mrs. Pinch. Indeed I was weary of the play ; but I liked hugeously the actors. They are the good liest, properest men, sister ! Alith. O, but you must not like the actors, sister. Mrs. Pinch. Ay, how should I help it, sister ? Pray, sister, when my husband comes in, will you ask leave for me to go a-wai'king ? Alith. A-walking ! ha ! ha ! Lord, a country gentlewoman's pleasure is the drudgery of a foot post ; and she requires as much airing as her husband's horses. \u2014 [Aside.] But here comes your husband: I'll ask, though I'm sure he'll not grant it. Mrs. Pinch. He says he won't let me go abroad for fear of catching the pox. Alith. Fy ! the small-pox you should say. Mrs. Pinch. Not I indeed, dear; I hate London. Our place-house in the country is worth a thousand oft : would I were there again ! Pinch. So you shall, I warrant. But were you not talking of plays and players when I came in ? \u2014 [To Alithea.] You are her encourager in such discourses. Mrs. Pinch. No, indeed, dear ; she chid me just now for liking the playermen. Pinch.

Indeed ! who, who, pray who was't? Spark. No, by the universe, madam, he does not rally now ; you may believe him. \u25a0 I do assure you, he is the honestest, worthiest, true-hearted gentlemen \u2014 a man of such perfect honour, he would say nothing to a lady he does not mean.

Nay, now, sir, I'm satisfied you are of the society of the wits and raillieurs, since you cannot spare your friend, even when he is but too civil to you ; but the surest sign is, since you are an enemy to marriage, \u2014 for that I hear you hate as much as business or bad wine.

Indeed, as the world goes, I wonder there are no more jealous, since wives are so ne glected. Dain. Pshaw ! as the world goes, to what end should they be jealous ? Lady Fidg. Foh !

And all the difference is, the spaniel's the more faithful animal, and fawns but upon one master. Sir Jasp. He ! he ! he ! Mrs. Squeam. O the rude beast ! Dain. Insolent brute ! Lady Fidg. Fy, Sir Tasper 1 do not use that word naked. Sir Jasp. Well, well, in short I have business at Whitehall, and cannot go to the play with you, therefore would have you go \u2014 Lady Fidg. With those two to a play ? Sir Jasp. No, not with t'other, but with Mr. Horner ; there can be no more scandal to go with him than with Mr. Tatttle, or master Limberham. Lady Fidg.

You know you often want one to make up your drolling pack of ombre players, and you may cheat him easily ; for he's an ill gamester, and consequently loves play. Besides, you know you have but two old civil gentlemen (with stinking breaths too) to wait upon you abroad ; take in the third into your ser vice. The other are but crazy ; and a lady should have a supernumerary gentleman-usher as a super numerary coach-horse, lest sometimes you should be forced to stay at home. Lady Fidg. But are you sure he loves play, and has money ? Sir Jasp. He loves play as much as you, and has money as much as I. Lady Fidg. Then I am contented to make him pay for his scurrility. Money makes up in a measure all other wants in men. \u2014 Those whom we cannot make hold for gallants, we make fine. [Aside. [Whispers lo Lady Fidget. Horn.

Mrs. Squeam. And I would as soon look upon a picture of Adam and Eve, without fig-leaves, as any of you, if I could help it ; therefore keep off, and do not make us sick. Dor. What a devil are these ? Horn. Why, these are pretenders to honour, as critics to wit, only by censuring others ; and as every raw, peevish, out-of-humoured, affected, dull, tea-drinking, arithmetical fop, sets up for a wit by railing at men of sense, so these for honour, by railing at the court, and ladies of as great honour as quality. Sir Jasp. Come, Mr. Horner, I must desire you to go with these ladies to the play, sir. Horn. I, sir ? Sir Jasp. Ay, ay, come, sir. Horn. I must beg your pardon, sir, and theirs ; I will not be seen in women's company in public again for the world. Sir Jasp. Ha, ha, strange aversion ! Mrs Squeam. No, he's for women's company in private. Sir Jasp. He \u2014 poor man \u2014 he \u2014 ha ! ha ! ha ! Dain. 'Tis a greater shame amongst lewd fel lows to be seen in virtuous women's company, than for the women to be seen with them. Sir Jasp. [Aside] So, so ; now to mollify, to wheedle him [Aside to Horner.] Master Horner, will you never keep civil company ? methinks 'tis time now, since you are only fit for them. Come, come, man, you must e'en fall to visiting our wives, eating at our tables, drinking tea with our virtuous relations after dinner, dealing cards to 'em, reading plays and gazettes to 'em, picking fleas out of their smocks for 'em, collecting receipts, new songs, women, pages, and footmen for 'em. Horn. Indeed, madam, the time was I only hated virtuous women, but now I hate the other too ; I beg your pardon, ladies. Horn. I hope they'll afford me better employ ment, sir. Lady Fidg. You are very obliging, sir, because we would not be troubled with you. Sir Jasp. In sober sadness, he shall go. Dor. Nay, if he wo' not, I am ready to wait upon the ladies, and I think I am the fitter man. Sir Jasp. He ! he ! he ! 'tis fit you know your work before you come into your place. And since you are unprovided of a lady to flatter, and a good house to eat at, pray frequent mine, and call my wife mistress, and she shall call you gallant, according to the custom. Horn. Who, I ? Sir Jasp. You, sir ! no, I thank you for that. Master Horner is a privileged man amongst the virtuous ladies, 'twill be a great while before you are so ; he ! he ! he ! he's my wife's gallant ; he 1 he ! he ! No, pray withdraw, sir, for as I take it, the virtuous ladies have no business with you. Dor. And I am sure he can have none with them.

All sorts of freedom, madam ? bound with you. But I have so strong a faith in your honour, dear, dear, noble sir, that I'd forfeit mine for yours at any time, dear sir. Horn. No, madam, you should not need to for feit it for me ; I have given you security already to save you harmless, my late reputation being so well known in the world, madam. Lady Fidg. But if upon any future falling-out, or upon a suspicion of my taking the trust out of your hands, to employ some other, you yourself should betray your trust, dear sir ? I mean, if you'll give me leave to speak obscenely, you might tell, dear sir. Horn. If I did, nobody would believe me. The reputation of impotency is as hardly recovered again in the world as that of cowardice, dear madam. Sir Jasp. Ay, ay, ay, all sorts of freedom thou canst take. And so go to her, begin thy new em ployment ; wheedle her, jest with her, and be better acquainted one with another. Horn.

Why,- indeed, sir Jasper, master Horner is a thousand, thousand times a better man than I thought him. Cousin Squeamish, sister Dainty, I can name him now. Truly, not long ago, you know, I thought his very name obscenity; and I would as soon have lain with him as have named him. Mrs. Squeam. Foh ! we'll have no such play fellows. Dain. No, sir; you shan't choose playfellows for us, we thank you. Sir Jasp. Nay, pray hear me. [Whispering to them. Lady Fidg. But, poor gentleman, could you be so generous, so truly a man of honour, as for the sakes of us women of honour, to cause yourself to be reported no man ? No man ! and to suffer yourself the greatest shame that could fall upon a man, that none might fall upon us women by your conversation ? but, indeed, sir, as perfectly, per fectly the same man as before your going into France, sir ? as perfectly, perfectly, sir ? Horn. As perfectly, perfectly, madam. Nay, I scorn you should take my word ; I desire to be tried only, madam. Lady Fidg. Well, that's spoken again like a man of honour : all men of honour desire to come to the test. But, indeed, generally you men report such things of yourselves, one does not know how or whom to believe ; and it is come to that pass, we dare not take your words no more than your tailor's, without some staid servant of yours be Sir Jasp.

Would it not make any one melan choly to see you go every day fluttering about abroad, whilst I must stay at home like a poor, lonely, sullen bird in a cage ? Alith. Ay, sister ; but you came young, and just from the nest to your cage : so that I thought you liked it, and could be as cheerful in't as others that took their flight themselves early, and are hopping abroad in the open air. Mrs. Pinch. Nay, I confess I was quiet enough till my husband told me what pure lives the London ladies live abroad, with their dancing, meetings, Enter Mr. Pinchwife. Pinch. Come, what's here to do ? you are put ting the town-pleasures in her head, and setting her a-longing. Alith. Yes, after nine-pins. You suffer none to give her those longings you mean but yourself. Pinch. I tell her of the vanities of the town like a confessor. Alith. A confessor ! just such a confessor as he that, by forbidding a silly hostler to grease the horse's teeth, taught him to do't. Pinch. Come, Mrs. Flippant, good precepts are lost when bad examples are still before us : the"], [174, "THE COUNTRY WIFE. 80 ACT III, liberty you take abroad makes her hanker after it, and out of humour at home.

Come, pray, bud, let's go abroad before 'tis late ; for I will go, that's flat and plain. Pinch. [Aside.] So ! the obstinacy already of the town-wife ; and I must, whilst she's here, humour her like one. \u2014 [Aloud.] Sister, how shall we do, that she may not be seen, or known ? Alith. Very well. Pinch. She has been this week in town, and never desired till this afternoon to go abroad. Alith. Was she not at a play yesterday? Pinch. Yes ; but she ne'er asked me ; I was myself the cause of her going. 'Alith. Then if she ask you again, you are the cause of her asking, and not my example. Pinch. Well, to-morrow night I shall be rid of you ; and the next day, before 'tis light, she and I'll be rid of the town, and my dreadful apprehensions. \u25a0 \u2014 Come, be not melancholy ; for thou sha't go into the country after tomorrow, dearest. Alith. Great comfort ! Alith. Let her put on her mask. Pinch. Pshaw ! a mask makes people but the more inquisitive, and is as ridiculous a disguise as a stage-beard : her shape, stature, habit, will be known. And if we should meet with Horner, he would be sure to take acquaintance with us, must wish her joy, kiss her, talk to her, leer upon her, and the devil and all. No, I'll not use her to a mask, 'tis dangerous ; for masks have made more cuckolds than the best faces that ever were known Mrs. Pinch. Pish! what d'ye tell me of the country for ? Pinch. How's this ! what, pish at the country ? Mrs. Pinch. Let me alone ; I am not well. Pinch. O, if that be all \u2014 what ails my dearest ? Mrs. Pinch. Truly, I don't know : but I have not been well since you told me there was a gallant at the play in love with me. Pinch. Ha ! \u2014 Alith. How will you do then ? Mrs. Pinch. Nay, shall we go ? The Exchange will be shut, and I have a mind to see that. Pinch. So \u2014 I have it \u2014 I'll dress her up in the suit we are to carry down to her brother, little sii James ; nay, I understand the town-tricks. Come, let's go dress her. A mask ! no \u2014 a woman masked, like a covered dish, gives a man curiosity and appetite ; when, it may be, uncovered, 'twould turn his stomach : no, no. Alith. That's by my example too ! Pinch. Nay, if you are not well, but are so con cerned, because a lewd fellow chanced to lie, and say he liked you, you'll make me sick too. Mrs. Pinch. Of what sickness ? Alith. Indeed your comparison is something a greasy one : but I had a gentle gallant used to say, A beauty masked, like the sun in eclipse, gathers together more gazers than if it shined out. [Exeunt.

SCENE II.\u2014 The New Exchange. Enter Horner, IIarcourt, and Dorilant. Mrs. Pinch. Well, but pray, bud, let's go to a play to-night. Dor. Engaged to women, and not sup with us! Horn. Ay, a pox on 'em all 1 Har. You were much a more reasonable man in Pinch. 'Tis just done, she comes from it. But why are you so eager to see a play ? Mrs. Pinch. Faith, dear, not that I care one pin for their talk there ; but I like to look upon the player-men, and would see, if I could, the gal lant you say loves me : that's all, dear bud. Pinch. Is that all, dear bud? the morning, and bad as noble resolutions against 'em, as a widower of a week's liberty. Dor. Did I ever think to see you keep company with women in vain ? Horn. In vain I no \u2014 'tis since I can't love 'em, to be revenged on 'em. Har. Now your sting is gone, you looked in the box amongst all those women like a drone in the hive ; all upon you, shoved and ill-used by 'em all, and thrust from one side to t'other. Alith. This proceeds from my example ! Mrs. Pinch. But if the play be done, let's go abroad, however, dear bud. Pinch. Come, have a little patience, and thou shalt go into the country on Friday. Mrs. Pinch. Therefore I would see first some sights to tell my neighbours of. Nay, I will go abroad, that's once. Dor. Yet he must be buzzing amongst 'em still, like other beetle-headed liquorish drones. Avoid 'em, and hate 'em, as they hate you. Horn. Because I do hate 'em, and would hate 'em yet more, I'll frequent 'em. You may see by marriage, nothing makes a man hate a woman more than her constant conversation. In short, I converse with 'em, as you do with rich fools, to laugh at 'em and use 'em ill. Dor. But I would no more sup with women, unless I could lie with 'em, than sup with a rich coxcomb, unless I could cheat him. Horn. Yes, I have known thee sup with a fool for his drinking; if he could set out your hand that way only, you were satisfied, and if he were a wine swallowing mouth, 'twas enough. Har. Yes, a man drinks often with a fool, as he Alith. I'm the cause of this desire too ! Pinch. But now I think on't, who, who was the cause of Homer's coming to my lodging to-day ? That was you. Alith. No, you, because you would not let him see your handsome wife out of your lodging. Mrs. Pinch. Why, O Lord ! did the gentleman come hither to see me indeed ? Pinch. No, no. \u2014 You are not the cause of that damned question too, mistress Alithea? \u2014 [Aside.] Well, she's in the right of it. He is in love with my wife \u2014 and comes after her \u2014 'tis so \u2014 but I'll nip his love in the bud ; lest he should follow us into the country, and break his chariot-wheel near"], [175, "THE COUNTRY WIFE. 81 SCESK II. raillery, sir ? But we are some of us beforehand with you to-day at the play. The wits were some thing\" bold with you, sir ; did you not hear us laugh ? Horn. Yes ; but I thought you had gone to plays, to laugh at the poet's wit, not at your own. Spark. Your servant, sir : no, I thank you. 'Gad I go to a play as to a country treat ; I carry my own wine to one, and my own wit to t'other, or else I'm sure I should not be merry at either. And the reason why we are so often louder than the players, is, because we think we speak more wit, and so become the poet's rivals in his audience : for to tell you the truth, we hate the silly rogues ; nay, so much, that we find fault even with their bawdy upon the stage, whilst we talk nothing else in the pit as loud. Horn. But why shouldst thou hate the silly poets ? Thou hast too much wit to be one ; and they, like whores, are only hated by each other : and thou dost scorn writing, I'm sure. Spark. Yes ; I'd have you to know I scorn writing : but women, women, that make men do all foolish things, make 'em write songs too. Everybody does it. 'Tis even as common with lovers, as playing with fans ; and you can no more help rhyming to your Phillis, than drinking to your Phillis. Har. Nay, poetry in love is no more to be avoided than jealousy. Dor. But the poets damned your songs, did they? Spark. Damn the poets ! they have turned 'em into burlesque, as they call it. That burlesque is a hocus-pocus trick they have got, which, by the virtue of Hictius doctius topsy turvy, they make a wise and witty man in the world, a fool upon the stage you know not how : and 'tis therefore I hate 'em too, for I know not but it may be my own case ; for they'll put a man into a play for looking asquint. Their predecessors were contented to make serving-men only their stage-fools : but these rogues must have gentlemen, with a pox to 'em, nay, knights ; and, indeed, you shall hardly see a fool upon the stage but he's a knight. And to tell you the truth, they have kept me these six years from being a knight in earnest, for fear of being knighted in a play, and dubbed a fool. Dor. Blame 'em not, they must follow their tosses with a marker, only to keep his hand in use. But do the ladies drink ? Horn. Yes, sir ; and I shall have the pleasure at least of laying 'em flat with a bottle, and bring as much scandal that way upon 'em as formerly t'other. Har. Perhaps you may prove as weak a brother among 'em that way as t'other. Dor. Foh ! drinking with women is as unnatural as scolding with 'em. But 'tis a pleasure of de cayed fornicators, and the basest way of quenching love. Har. Nay, 'tis drowning love, instead of quench ing it. But leave us for civil women too ! Dor. Ay, when he can't be the better for 'em. We hardly pardon a man that leaves his friend for a wench, and that's a pretty lawful call. Horn. Faith, I would not leave you for 'em, if they would not drink. Dor. Who would disappoint his company at Lewis's for a gossiping? Har. Foh I Wine and women, good apart, toge ther are as nauseous as sack and sugar. But hark you, sir, before you go, a little of your advice ; an old maimed general, when unfit for action, is fittest for counsel. I have other designs upon women than eating and drinking with them ; I am in love with Sparkish's mistress, whom he is to marry to morrow : now how shall I get her ? Enter Sparkish, looking about. Horn. Why here comes one will help you to her. Har. He ! he, I tell you, is my rival, and will hinder my love. Horn. No ; a foolish rival and a jealous husband assist their rival's designs ; for they are sure to make their women hate them, which is the first step to their love for another man. Har. But I cannot come near his mistress but in his company. Horn. Still the better for you; for fools are most easily cheated when they themselves are accessaries : and he is to be bubbled of his mistress as of his money, the common mistress, by keeping him company. Spark. Who is that that is to be bubbled ? Faith, let me snack ; I han't met with a bubble since Christmas. 'Gad, I think bubbles are like their brother woodcocks, go out with the cold weather. copy, the age. Har. But why shouldst thou be afraid of being in a play, who expose yourself every day in the play houses, and at public places ? Horn. 'Tis but being on the stage, instead of standing on a bench in the pit. Dor. Don't you give money to painters to draw you like ? and are you afraid of your pictures at length in a playhouse, where all your mistresses may see you ? Spark. A pox ! painters don't draw the small pox or pimples in one's face. Come, damn all your silly authors whatever, all books and book sellers, by the world ; and all readers, courteous or uncourteous ! Har. But who comes here, Sparkish ? Har. A pox ! he did not hear all I hope. [Apart to Horner. Spark. Come, you bubbling rogues you, where do we sup ? \u2014 Oh, Harcourt, my mistress tells me you have been making fierce love to her all the play long : ha ! ha ! \u2014 But I \u2014 Hir. I make love to her ! Spark. Nay, I forgive thee, for I think I know thee, and I know her ; but I am sure I know myself. Har. Did she tell you so ? I see all women are like these of the Exchange; who, to enhance the prize of their commodities, report to their fond customers offers which were never made 'em. Horn. Ay, women are apt to tell before the intrigue, as men after it, and so show themselves the vainer sex. But hast thou a mistress, Sparkish ? 'Tis as hard for me to believe it, as that thou ever hadst a bubble, as you bragged just now. Enter Mr. Pinchwife and Mrs. Pinchwife in man's clothes, Alithea and Lucy. Spark. Oh, hide me !

That's a good one ! I hate a man for loving you I If he did love you, 'tis but what he can't help ; and 'tis your fault, not his, if he admires you. I hate a man for being of my opinion ! I'll ne'er do't, by the world. Alith. Is it for your honour, or mine, to suffer a man to make love to me, who am to marry you to-morrow ? Horn. Who is that pretty youth with him, Sparkish ? Spark.

Pinchwife, Mrs. Pinchwife, Alithea, and Lucy ; Horner and Dorilant following them. Spark. Is it for your honour, or mine, to have me jealous ? That he makes love to you, is a sign you are handsome ; and that I am not jealous, isa sign you are virtuous. That I think is for your honour. Har. Come, Sparkish, your mistress saw you, and will be angry you go not to her. Besides, I would fain be reconciled to her, which none but you can do, dear friend. Spark. Well, that's a better reason, dear friend. I would not go near her now for her's or my own sake ; but I can deny you nothing : for though I have known thee a great while, never go, if I do not love thee as well as a new acquaintance. Har. I am obliged to you indeed, dear friend. I would be well with her, only to be well with thee still ; for these ties to wives usually dissolve all ties to friends. I would be contented she should enjoy you a-nights, but I would have you to myself a days as I have had, dear friend. Spark. And thou shalt enjoy me a-days, dear, dear friend, never stir : and I'll be divorced from her, sooner than from thee. Come along. Har. [Aside.] So, we are hard put to't, when we make our rival our procurer ; but neither she nor her brother would let me come near her now. When all's done, a rival is the best cloak to steal to a mistress under, without suspicion ; and when we have once got to her as we desire, we throw him off like other cloaks. Alith. But 'tis your honour too I am concerned for. Har. But why, dearest madam, will you be more concerned for his honour than he is himself ? Let his honour alone, for my sake and his. He ! he has no honour \u2014 Spark. How's that ? Har. But what my dear friend can guard him self. Spark. O ho \u2014 that's right again. Har. Your care of his honour argues his neglect of it, which is no honour to my dear friend here. Therefore once more, let his honour go which way it will, dear madam. Spark. Ay, ay ; were it for my honour to marry a woman whose virtue I suspected, and could not trust her in a friend's hands ? Alith. Are you not afraid to lose me ? Har. He afraid to lose you, madam 1 No, no \u2014 you may see how the most estimable and most glorious creature in the world is valued by him. Will you not see it? Spark. Right, honest Frank, I have that noble value for her that I cannot be jealous of her. [Exit Sparkish, Harcourt following him. Re-enter Mr. Pinchwife and Mrs. Pinchwife. Pinch. [To Alithea.] Sister, if you will not go, we must leave you. \u2014 [Aside.] The fool her gallant and she will muster up all the young saun terers of this place, and they will leave their dear sempstresses to follow us. What a swarm of cuck olds and cuckold-makers are here ! \u2014 Come, let's be gone, mistress Margery. Mrs. Pinch. Don't you believe that; I han't half my bellyfull of sights yet. Alith. You mistake him. He means, you care not for me, nor who has me. Spark. Lord, madam, I see you are jealous! Will you wrest a poor man's meaning from his words ? Alith. You astonish me, sir, with your wunt of jealousy."], [177, "SCENE II. THE COUNTRY WIFE. 83 Spark. And you make me giddy, madam, with your jealousy and fears, and virtue and honour. Gad, I see virtue makes a woman as troublesome as a little reading or learning. Alith. Monstrous ! Alith. I thank him, methinks he speaks plain enough now. Spark. [To Alithea.] You are out still.\u2014 But with what kind of love, Harcourt ? Har. With the best and the truest love in the world. Lucy. Well, to see what easy husbands these women of quality can meet with ! a poor chamber maid can never have such ladylike luck. Besides, he's thrown away upon her. She'll make no use of her fortune, her blessing, none to a gentleman, for a pure cuckold ; for it requires good breeding to be a cuckold. [Aside. Spark. Look you there then, that is with no matrimonial love, I'm sure. Alith. How's that ? do you say matrimonial love is not best ? Spark. 'Gad, I went too far ere I was aware. But speak for thyself, Harcourt, you said you would not wrong me nor her. Har. No, no, madam, e'en take him for Hea ven's sake. Alith. I tell you then plainly, he pursues me to marry me. Spark. Pshaw ! Har. Come, madam, you see you strive in vain to make him jealous of me. My dear friend is the kindest creature in the world to me. Spark. Look you there, madam. Har. Who should in all justice be yours, he that loves you most. [Claps his hand on his breast. Alith. Look you there, Mr.Sparkish, who's that? Spark. Who should it be ? \u2014 Go on, Harcourt. Har. Who loves you more than women titles, or fortune fools. [Points at Sparkish. Spark. Poor fellow ! Har. But his kindness only is not enough for me, without your favour, your good opinion, dear madam : 'tis that must perfect my happiness. Good gentleman, he believes all I say : would you would do so ! Jealous of me ! I would not wrong him nor you for the world. Spark. Look you there. Hear him, hear him, and do not walk away so. [Alithea walks carelessly to and fro. Spark. Look you there, he means me still, for he points at me. Alith. Ridiculous ! Har. Who can only match your faith and con stancy in love. Spark. Ay. Har. Who knows, if it be possible, how to value so much beauty and virtue. Spark. Ay. Har. Whose love can no more be equalled in the world, than that heavenly form of yours. Spark. No. Har. Who could no more suffer a rival, than your absence, and yet could no more suspect your virtue, than his own constancy in his love to you. Spark. No. Har. Who, in fine, loves you better than his eyes, that first made him love you. Spark. Ay \u2014 Nay, madam, faith, you shan't go, till\u2014 Har. I love you, madam, so \u2014 Spark. How's that ? Nay, now you begin to go too far indeed. Har. So much, I confess, I say, I love you, that I would not have you miserable, and cast yourself away upon so unworthy and inconsiderable a thing as what you see here. [Clapping his hand on his breast, points at Sparkish. Spark. No, faith, I believe thou wouldst not : now his meaning is plain ; but I knew before thou wouldst not wrong me, nor her. Har. No, no, Heavens forbid the glory of her sex should fall so low, as into the embraces of such a contemptible wretch, the least of mankind \u2014 my dear friend here \u2014 I injure him ! [Embracing Sparkish. Alith. Very well. Spark. No, no, dear friend,I knewit. \u2014 Madam, you see he will rather wrong himself than me, in giving himself such names. Alith. Do not you understand him yet ? Spark. Yes : how modestly he speaks of himself, poor fellow ! Alith. Methinks he speaks impudently of your self, since \u2014 before yourself too ; insomuch that I can no longer suffer his scurrilous abusiveness to you, no more than his love to me. [Offers to go. Alith. Have a care, lest you make me stay too long. Spark. But till he has saluted you ; that I may be assured you are friends, after his honest advice and declaration. Come, pray, madam, be friends with him. Re-enter Mr. Pinchwife and Mrs. Pinchwife. Alith. You must pardon me, sir, that I am not yet so obedient to you. Pinch. What, invite your wife to kiss men ? Monstrous ! are you not ashamed ? I will never forgive you. Spark. Are you not ashamed, that I should have more confidence in the chastity of your family than you have ? You must not teach me, I am a man of honour, sir, though I am frank and free ; I am frank, sir \u2014 Spark. Nay, nay, madam, pray stay \u2014 his love to you ! Lord, madam, has he not spoke yet plain enough ? Alith. Yes, indeed, I should think so. Spark. Well then, by the world, a man can't speak civilly to a woman now, but presently she says, he makes love to her. Nay, madam, you shall stay, with your pardon, since you have not yet un derstood him, till he has made an eclaircissement of his love to you, that is, what kind of love it is. Answer to thy catechism, friend ; do you love my mistress here ? Pinch. Very frank, sir, to share your wife with your friends. Spark. He is an humble, menial friend, such as reconciles the differences of the marriage bed ; you know man and wife do not always agree ; I design him for that use, therefore would have him well with my wife. Har. Yes, I wish she would not doubt it Spark. But how do you love her ? Har. With all my soul. Pinch. A menial friend ! \u2014 you will get a great many menial friends, by showing your wife as yon do. G 2"], [178, "THE COUNTRY WIFE. 84 ACT III. Spark. What then ? It may be I have a plea sure in't, as I have to show fine clothes at a play house, the first day, and count money before poor rogues. Mrs. Pinch. [Aside.] O jeminy ! is that he that was in love with me ? I am glad on't, I vow, for he's a curious fine gentleman, and I love him al ready too.\u2014 [TV Mr. Pinchwife.] Is this he, bud? Pinch. He that shows his wife or money, will be in danger of having them borrowed sometimes. Spark. I love to be envied, and would not marry a wife that I alone could love ; loving alone is as dull as eating alone. Is it not a frank age ? and I am a frank person ; and to tell you the truth, it may be, I love to have rivals in a wife, they make her seem to a man still but as a kept mistress ; and so good night, for I must to Whitehall. \u2014 Madam, I hope you are now reconciled to my friend ; and so I wish you a good night, madam, and sleep if you can ; for to-morrow you know I must visit you early with a canonical gentleman. \u2014 Good night, dear Harcourt. [Exit. Pinch. Come away, come away. [To his wife. Horn. Why, what haste are you in ? why won't you let me talk with him ? Pinch. Because you'll debauch him ; he's yet young and innocent, and I would not have him de bauched for anything in the world. \u2014 [Aside.] How she gazes on him ! the devil ! Horn. Harcourt, Dorilant, look you here, this is the likeness of that dowdy he told us of, his wife; did you ever see a lovelier creature ? The rogue has reason to be jealous of his wife, since she is like him, for she would make all that see her in love with her. Har. Madam, I hope you will not refuse my visit to-morrow, if it should be earlier with a canon ical gentleman than Mr. Sparkish's. Har. And, as I remember now, she is as like him here as can be. Dor. She is indeed very pretty, if she be like him. Pinch. This gentlewoman is yet under my care, therefore you must yet forbear your freedom with her, sir. [Coming between Alithea and Harcourt. Horn.

Ay, but saying she was handsome, if like him, made him blush. \u2014 [Aside.] I am upon a rack ! Horn. What ! I see a little time in the country makes a man turn wild and unsociable, and only fit to converse with his horses, dogs, and his herds. Horn. Methinks he is so handsome he should not be a man. Pinch.

One to whom I'm a guardian. \u2014 [Aside.] I wish I could keep her out of your hands. Horn. Who is he ? I never saw anything so pretty in all my life. Pinch. Pshaw ! do not look upon him so much, he's a poor bashful youth, you'll put him out of countenance. \u2014 Come away, brother. [Offers to take her away. Horn. O, your brother ! Pinch. Yes, my wife's brother Come, come, she'll stay supper for us. Horn. I thought so, for he is very like her I saw you at the play with, whom I told you I was in love with. Pinch. No, now I think on't, having stayed so long for us, I warrant she's gone to bed. \u2014 [Aside.] I wish she and I were well out of their hands. \u2014 [To his wife.] Come, I must rise early to-morrow, come.

Certainly, I have given him already my word, and will my hand too, to make it good, when he comes. Enter Alithea dressed in new Clothes, and Lucy. Lucy. Well \u2014 madam, now have I dressed you, and set you out with so many ornaments, and spent upon you ounces of essence and pulvillio ; and all this for no other purpose but as people adorn and perfume a corpse for a stinking second hand grave : such, or as bad, I think master Sparkish's bed. Alith. Hold your peace. Lucy. Nay, madam, I will ask you the reason why you would banish poor master Harcourt for ever from your sight ; how could you be so hard hearted ? Lucy. Well, I wish I may never stick pin more, if he be not an arrant natural, to t'other fine gen tleman. Alith. I own he wants the wit of Harcourt, which I will dispense withal for another want he has, which is want of jealousy, which men of wit seldom want. Lucy. Lord, madam, what should you do with a fool to your husband ? You intend to be honest, don't you ? then that husbandly virtue, credulity, is thrown away upon you. Alith. He only that could suspect my virtue should have cause to do it ; 'tis Sparkish's confi dence in my truth that obliges me to be so faithful to him. Alith. 'Twas because I was not hard-hearted. Lucy. No, no ; 'twas stark love and kindness, I warrant. Alith. It was so ; I would see him no more because I love him. Lucy. You are not sure his opinion may last. Alith. I am satisfied, 'tis impossible for him to be jealous after the proofs I have had of him. Jealousy in a husband \u2014 Heaven defend me from it ! it begets a thousand plagues to a poor woman, the loss of her honour, her quiet, and her \u2014 Lucy. And her pleasure. Alith. What d'ye mean, impertinent ? Lucy. Liberty is a great pleasure, madam. Alith. I say, loss of her honour, her quiet, nay, her life sometimes ; and what's as bad almost, the loss of this town ; that is, she is sent into the country, which is the last ill-usage of a husband to a wife, I think. Lucy. [Aside.] O, does the wind lie there ? \u2014 [Aloud.] Then of necessity, madam, you think a man must carry his wife into the country, if he be wise. The country is as terrible, I find, to our young English ladies, as a monastery to those abroad ; and on my virginity, I think they would rather marry a London jailer, than a high sheriff of a county, since neither can stir from his employ ment. Formerly women of wit married fools for a great estate, a fine seat, or the like ; but now 'tis for a pretty seat only in Lincoln's-Inn- Fields, St. James's-Fields, or the Pail-Mall. Lucy. Hey day, a very pretty reason ! Alith. You do not understand me. Lucy. I wish you may yourself. Alith. I was engaged to marry, you see, another man, whom my justice will not suffer me to deceive or injure. Lucy. Can there be a greater cheat or wrong done to a man than to give him your person with out your heart ? I should make a conscience of it. Alith. I'll retrieve it for him after I am married a while. Lucy. The woman that marries to love better, will be as much mistaken as the wencher that marries to live better. No, madam, marrying to increase love is like gaming to become rich ; alas ! you only lose what little stock you had before. Alith. J find by your rhetoric you have been bribed to betray me. Lucy. Only by his merit, that has bribed your heart, you see, against your word and rigid honour. But what a devil is this honour 1 'tis sure a disease in the head, like the megrim or falling-sickness, that always hurries people away to do themselves mischief. Men lose their lives by it ; women, what's dearer to 'em, their love, the life of life. Alith. Come, pray talk you no more of honour, nor master Harcourt ; I wish the other would come to secure my fidelity to him and his right in me. Enter Sparkish, and Harcourt dressed like a parson. Spark. Madam, your humble servant, a bappy day to you, and to us all."], [181, "THE COUNTRY WIFE. SCENE II. 87 Har. Amen. cease your persecution, and let us have a conclu sion of this ridiculous love. Alith. Who have we here ? Spark. My chaplain, faith \u2014 O madam, poor Harcourt remembers his humble service to you ; and, in obedience to your last commands, refrains coming into your sight. Alith. Is not that he ? Har. I had forgot, I must suit my style to my coat, or I wear it in vain. [Aside. Alith. I have no more patience left ; let us make once an end of this troublesome love, I say. Har. So be it, seraphic lady, when your honour shall think it meet and convenient so to do. Spark. No, fy, no ; but to show that he ne'er intended to hinder our match, has sent his brother here to join our hands. When I get me a wife, I must get her a chaplain, according to the custom ; this is his brother, and my chaplain. Alith. His brother ! Spark. 'Gad I'm sure none but a chaplain could speak so, I think. Alith. Let me tell you, sir, this dull trick will not serve your turn ; though you delay our mar riage, you shall not hinder it. Liar. Far be it from me, munificent patroness, to delay your marriage ; I desire nothing more than to marry you presently, which I might do, if you yourself would ; for my noble, good-natured, and thrice generous patron here would not hinder it. Spark. No, poor man, not I, faith. Har. And now, madam, let me tell you plainly nobody else shall marry you; by heavens, I'll die first, for I'm sure I should die after it. Lucy. And your chaplain, to preach in your pul pit then \u2014 [Aside. Alith. His brother! Spark. Nay, I knew you would not believe it. \u2014 I told you, sir, she would take you for your brother Frank. Alith. Believe it ! Lucy. His brother ! ha ! ha ! he ! he has a trick left still, it seems. [Aside. Spark. Come, my dearest, pray let us go to church before the canonical hour is past. Alith. For shame, you are abused still. Spark. By the world, 'tis strange now you are so incredulous. Lucy. How his love has made him forget his function, as I have seen it in real parsons ! Alith. That was spoken like a chaplain too ? now you understand him, I hope. Spark. Poor man, he takes it heinously to be refused ; I can't blame him, 'tis putting an indignity upon him, not to be suffered ; but you'll pardon me, madam, it shan't be ; he shall marry us : come away, pray madam. Lucy. Ha! ha! he! more ado ! 'tis late. Alith. Invincible stupidity ! I tell you, he would marry me as your rival, not as your chaplain. Spark. Come, come, madam. [Pulling her away. Lucy. I pray, madam, do not refuse this reverend divine the honour and satisfaction of marrying you ; for I dare say, he has set his heart upon't, good doctor. Alith. What can you hope or design by this ? Har. I could answer her, a reprieve for a day only, often revokes a hasty doom. At worst, if she will Dot take mercy on me, and let me marry her, I have at least the lover's second pleasure, hindering my rival's enjoyment, though but for a time. [Aside. Alith. 'Tis strange you are so credulous. Spark. Dearest of my life, hear me. I tell you this is Ned Harcourt of Cambridge, by the world ; you see he has a sneaking college look. 'Tis true he's something like his brother Frank ; and they differ from each other no more than in their age, for they were twins. Lucy. Ha ! ha ! he ! Alith. Your servant, sir ; I cannot he so deceived, though you are. But come, let's hear, how do you know what you affirm so confidently ? Spark. Why, I'll tell you all. Frank Har court coming to me this morning to wish me joy, and present his service to you, I asked him if he could help me to a parson. Whereupon he told me, he had a brother in town who was in orders ; and he went straight away, and sent him, you see there, to me. Alith. Yes, Frank goes and puts on a black coat, then tells you he is Ned ; that's all you have for't. Spark. Come, madam, 'tis e'en twelve o'clock, and my mother charged me never to be married out of the canonical hours. Come, come ; Lord, here's such a deal of modesty, I warrant, the first day. Lucy. Yes, an't please your worship, married women show all their modesty the first day, because married men show all their love the first Spark. Pshaw ! pshaw ! I tell you, by the same token, the midwife put her garter about Frank's neck, to know 'em asunder, they were so like. Alith. Frank tells you this too ? Spark. Ay, and Ned there too : nay, they are both in a story. Alith. So, so ; very foolish. Spark. Lord, if you won't believe one, you had best try him by your chambermaid there ; for chambermaids must needs know chaplains from other men, they are so used to 'em. Lucy. Let's see : nay, I'll be sworn he has the canonical smirk, and the filthy clammy palm of a chaplain. Alith. Well, most reverend doctor, pray let us make an end of this fooling. Har. With all my soul, divine heavenly creature, when you please. Alith. He speaks like a chaplain indeed. Spark. Why, was there not soul, divine, heavenly, in what he said ? Alith.

Yes, for he sent away a youth that was there, for some dried fruit, and China oranges. letter ! Pinch. Did he so? Damn him for it \u2014 and for \u2014 Pinch. Yes, to the fine gentleman. Mrs. Pinch. Lord, you do but jeer ; sure you Mrs. Pinch. But presently came up the gentle woman of the house. jest. Pinch. I am not so merry : come, write as I Pinch. O, 'twas well she did ; but what did he do whilst the fruit came ? bid you. Mrs. Pinch. What, do you think I am a fool ? Pinch. [Aside.] She's afraid I would not dic tate any love to him, therefore she's unwilling. \u2014 [Aloud.] But you had best begin. Mrs. Pinch. Indeed, and indeed, but I won't, so I won't. Mrs. Pinch. He kissed me a hundred times, and told me he fancied he kissed my fine sister, meaning me, you know, whom he said he loved with all his soul, and bid me be sure to tell her so, and to desire her to be at her window, by eleven of the clock this morning, and he would walk under it at that time. Pinch. Why ? Mrs. Pinch. Because he's in town ; you may send for him if you will. Pinch. Very well, you would have him brought to you ; is it come to this ? I say, take the pen and write, or you'll provoke me. Mrs. Pinch. Lord, what d'ye make a fool ot me for ? Don't I know that letters are never writ but from the country to London, and from London into the country ? Now he's in town, and I am in town too ; therefore I can't write to him, you know. Pinch. And he was as good as his word, very punctual ; a pox reward him for't ! [Aside. Mrs. Pinch. Well, and he said if you were not within, he would come up to her, meaning me, you kDow, bud, still. Pinch. [Aside.] So \u2014 he knew her certainly; but for this confession, I am obliged to her simplicity. \u2014 [Aloud.] But what, you stood very still when he kissed you? Mrs. Pinch. Yes, I warrant you ; would you have had me discovered myself? Pinch. But you told me he did some beastliness to you, as you call it ; what was't ? Mrs. Pinch. Why, he put \u2014 Pinch. What? Pinch. [Aside.] So, I am glad it is no worse ; she is innocent enough yet. \u2014 [Aloud.] Yes, you may, when your husband bids you. write letters to people that are in town. Mrs. Pinch. O, may I so ? then I'm satisfied. Pinch. Come, begin : \u2014 Sir \u2014 [Dictates- Mrs. Pinch. Shan't I say, Dear Sir?\u2014 You know one says always something more than bare sir. Mrs. Pinch. Why, he put the tip of his tongue between my lips, and so mousled me \u2014 and 1 said, I'd bite it. Pinch. An eternal canker seize it, for a dog ! Mrs. Pinch. Nay, you 'need not be so angry with him neither, for to say the truth, he has the sweetest breath I ever knew. Pinch. Write as I bid you, or I will write whore with this penknife in your face. Mrs. Pinch. Nay, good bud \u2014 Sir \u2014 [Write*. Pinch. Though I suffered last night your nauseous, loathed kisses and embraces \u2014 Write ! Pinch. The devil I you were satisfied with it then, and would do it again? Airs Pinch. Not unless he should force me. Mrs. Pinch. Nay, why should I say so ? You know I told you be had a sweet breath. Pinch. Write ! Pinch. Force you, changeling 1 I tell you, no woman can be forced. Mrs. Pinch. Yes, but she may sure, by such a one as he, for he's a proper, goodly, strong man ; 'tis hard, let me tell you, to resist him. Pinch. [Aside.] So, 'tis plain she loves him, yet she has not love enough to make her conceal it from me ; but the sight of him will increase her aversion for me and love for him ; and that love instruct her how to deceive me and satisfy him, all idiot as she is. Love ! 'twas he gave women first their craft, their art of deluding. Out of Nature's hands they came plain, open, silly, and fit for slaves, as she and heaven intended 'em ; but damned Love \u2014 well \u2014 I must strangle that little monster whilst 1 can deal with him. \u2014 [Aloud.] Go fetch pen, ink, and paper out of the next room. Mrs. Pinch. Yes, bud. [Exit. Mrs. Pinch. Let me but put out loathed. Pinch. Write, I say ! Mrs. Pinch. Well then. [Writes. Pinch. Let's see, what have you writ? \u2014 [Takes the paper and reads.] Though I suffered last night your kisses and embraces \u2014 Thou impudent creature ! where is nauseous and loathed? Mrs Pinch. I can't abide to write such filthy words. Pinch. Once more write as I'd have you, and question it not, or I will spoil thy writing with this. I will stab out those eyes that cause my mischief. [Holds up the penknife. Mrs. Pinch. O Lord ! I will. Pinch. So \u2014 so \u2014 let's see now. \u2014 [Reads.] Though I suffered last night your nauseous, loathed kisses and embraces \u2014 go on \u2014 yet I would not have you presume that you shall ever repeat them so \u2014 [She writes Mrs. Pinch.

What, he'd expect a kinder from you ? Come, now your name only. Mrs. Pinch. What, shan't I say Your most faithful humble servant till death ? Pinch.

If we do not cheat women, they'll cheat us, and fraud may be justly used with secret ene mies, of which a wife is the most dangerous ; and he that has a handsome one to keep, and a frontier town, must provide against treachery, rather than open force.

Enter Horner and Quack. Quack. Well, sir, how fadges the new design ? have you not the luck of all your brother projectors, to deceive only yourself at last ? Horn. No, good domine doctor, I deceive you, it seems, and others too ; for the grave matrons, and old rigid husbands think me as unfit for love, as they are ; but their wives, sisters, and daughters know, some of 'em, better things already. Quack. Already ! Horn. Already, I say. Last night I was drunk with half-a-dozen of your civil persons, as you call 'em, and people of honour, and so was made free of their society and dressing-rooms for ever here after ; and am already come to the privileges of sleeping upon their pallets, warming smocks, tying shoes and garters, and the like, doctor, already, already, doctor. Quack. You have made good use of your time, sir. Horn. I tell thee, I am now no more interrup tion to 'em, when they sing, or talk bawdy, than a little squab French page who speaks no English. Quack. But do civil persons and women of honour drink, and sing bawdy songs ? Horn. O, amongst friends, amongst friends. Re-enter Pinchwife. Pinch.

I love to torment the confounded toad ; let you and I tickle him. Sir Jasp. No, your ladyship will tickle him better without me, I suppose. But is this your buying china? I thought you had been at the china-house. For your bigots in honour are just like those in religion ; they fear the eye of the world more than the eye of Heaven ; and think there is no virtue, but railing at vice, and no sin, but giving scandal. They rail at a poor, little, kept player, and keep themselves some young, modest pulpit comedian to be privy to their sins in their closets, not to tell 'cm of them in their chapels. Quack. Nay, the truth on't is, priests, amongst the women now, have quite got the better of us lay confessors, physicians. Horn. And they are rather their patients ; but \u2014 Horn. [Aside.] China-house ! that's my cue I must take it. \u2014 [Aloud.] A pox ! can't you keep your impertinent wives at home ? Some men are troubled with the husbands, but I with the wives \u2022 but I'd have you to know, since I cannot be your journeyman by night, I will not be your drudge by day, to squire your wife about, and be your man of straw, or scarecrow only to pies and jays, that would be nibbling at your forbidden fruit ; I shall be shortly the hackney gentleman-usher of the town. Enter my Lady Fidget, looking about her. Now we talk of women of honour, here comes one. Step behind the screen there, and but observe, if I have not particular privileges with the women of reputation already, doctor, already. [Quack retires. Lady Fidg. Well, Horner, am not I a woman of honour ? you see, I'm as good as my word. Horn. And you shall see, madam, I'll not be behind-hand with you in honour ; and I'll be as good as my word too, if you please but to withdraw into the next room. Sir Jasp. [Aside.] He ! he ! he ! poor fellow, he's in the right on't, faith. To squire women about for other folks, is as ungrateful an employ ment, as to tell money for other folks.\u2014 [Aloud.] He ! he ! he ! be'n't angry, Horner. Lady Fidg. No, 'tis I have more reason to be angry, who am left by you, to go abroad indecently alone ; or, what is more indecent, to pin myself upon such ill-bred people of your acquaintance as this is. Lady Fidg. But first, my dear sir, you must promise to have a care of my dear honour. Horn. If you talk a word more of your hon our, you'll make me incapable to wrong it. To talk of honour in the mysteries of love, is like talking of Heaven or the Deity, in an operation of witchcraft, just when you are employing the devil : it makes the charm impotent. Lady Fidg. Nay, fy ! let us not be smutty. But you talk of mysteries and bewitching to me ; I don't understand you. Horn. I tell you, madam, the word money in a mistress's mouth, at such a nick of time, is not a more disheartening sound to a younger brother, than that of honour to an eager lover like myself. Lady Fidg. But you can't blame a lady of my reputation to be chary. Horn. Chary ! I have been chary of it already, by the report I have caused of myself. Lady Fidg. Ay, but if you should ever let other women know that dear secret, it would come out. Nay, you must have a great care of your conduct ; for my acquaintance are so censorious, (oh, 'tis a wicked, censorious world, Mr. Horner !) I say, are so censorious, and detracting, that perhaps they'll talk to the prejudice of my honour, though you should not let them know the dear secret. Sir Jasp. Nay, prithee, what has he done ? Lady Fidg. Nay, he has done nothing. Sir Jasp. But what d'ye take ill, if he has done nothing? Lady Fidg. Ha ! ha ! ha ! faith, I can't but laugh however ; why, d'ye think the unmannerly toad would come down to me to the coach ? I was fain to come up to fetch him, or go without him, which I was resolved not to do ; for he knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it, lest I should beg some ; but I will find it out, and have what I came for yet. Horn. [Apart to Lady Fidget, as he follows her to the door.] Lock the door, madam [Exit Lady Fidget, and locks the door.]\u2014 [Aloud.] So, she has got into my chamber and locked me out. Oh the impertinency of woman-kind ! Well, sir Jas per, plain-dealing is a jewel ; if ever you suffer your wife to trouble me again here, she shall carry you home a pair of horns ; by my lord mayor she shall ; though I cannot furnish you myself, you are sure, yet I'll find a way. Sir Jasp. Ha! ha! he! \u2014 [Aside.] At my first coming in, and finding her arms about him, tick ling him it seems, I was half jealous, but now I see my folly. \u2014 [Aloud.] He ! he ! he ! poor Horner. Horn. Nay, though you laugh now, 'twill be my turn ere long. Oh women, more impertinent, more cunning, and more mischievous than their monkeys, and to me almost as ugly ! \u2014 Now is she throwing my things about, and rifling all I have ; but I'll get into her the back way, and so rifle her for it. Horn. Nay, madam, rather than they shall pre judice your honour, I'll prejudice theirs ; and, to serve you, I'll lie with 'em all, make the secret their own, and then they'll keep it. I am a Machiavel in love, madam. Lady Fidg. O, no sir, not that way. Horn. Nay, the devil take me, if censorious women are to be silenced any other way. Lady Fidg. A secret is better kept, I hope, by a single person than a multitude ; therefore pray do not trust anybody else with it, dear, dear Mr. Horner. Sir Jasp. Ha ! ha ! ha ! poor angry Horner. Horn. Stay here a little, I'll ferret her out to you presently, I warrant. [Exit at the other door. [Sir Jasper talks through the door to his wife, she answers from within. Enter Sir Jasper Fidget. Sir Jasp. How now ! Lady Fidg. [Aside.] O myhusband ! \u2014 prevented \u2014 and what's almost as bad, found with my arms about another man\u2014 that will appear too much \u2014 what shall I say ? \u2014 [Aloud.] Sir Jasper, come Sir Jasp.

He'll catch you, and use you roughly, and be too strong for you. Lady Fidg. Don't you trouble yourself, let him if he can. Re-enter Lady Fidget with a piece of china in her hand, and Horner following. Lady Fidg. And I have been toiling aud moiling for the prettiest piece of china, my dear. Horn. Nay, she has been too hard for me, do what I could. Quack. [Aside.] This indeed I could not have believed from him, nor any but my own eyes. Airs. Squeam. Oh, lord, I'll have some china too. Good Mr. Horner, don't think to give other people china, and me none ; come in with me too. Horn. Upon my honour, I have none left now. Mrs. Squeam. Nay, nay, I have known you deny your china before now, but you shan't put me off so. Come. Enter Mrs. Squeamish. Airs. Squeam. Where's this woman-hater, this toad, this ugly, greasy, dirty sloven ? Sir Jasp. [Aside.] So, the women all will have him ugly : methinks he is a comely person, but his wants make his form contemptible to 'em ; and 'tis e'en as my wife said yesterday, talking of him, that a proper handsome eunuch was as ridi culous a thing as a gigantic coward. Airs. Squeam. Sir Jasper, your servant : where is the odious beast ? Horn. This lady had the last there. Lady Fidg. Yes indeed, madam, to my certain knowledge, he has no more left. Airs. Squeam. O, but it may be he may have some you could not find. Lady Fidg. What, d'ye think if he had had any left, I would not have had it too ? for we women of quality never think we have china enough. Horn. Do not take it ill, I cannot make china for you all, but I will have a roll-waggon for you too, another time. Sir Jasp. He's within in his chamber, with my wife ; she's playing the wag with him. Airs. Squeam. Is she so ? and he's a clownish beast, he'll give her no quarter, he'll play the wag with her again, let me tell you : come, let's go help her. \u2014 What, the door's locked ? Sir Jasp. Ay, my wife locked it. Mrs. Squeam. Did she so ? let's break it open then. Airs. Squeam. Thank you, dear toad. Lady Fidg. What do you mean by that promise ? [Aside to Horner. Horn. Alas, she has an innocent, literal under standing. [Aside to Lady Fidget. Lady Squeam. Poor Mr. Horner ! he has enough to do to please you all, I see. Horn. Ay, madam, you see how they use me. Lady Squeam. Poor gentleman, I pity you. Horn. 1 thank you, madam : I could never find pity, but from such reverend ladies as you are ; the young ones will never spare a man. Mrs. Squeam. Come, come, beast, and go dine with us ; for we shall want a man at ombre after dinner. Sir Jasp. No, no, he'll do her no hurt. Mrs. Squeam. No. \u2014 [Aside.] But is there no other way to get in to 'em ? whither goes this ? I will disturb 'em. [Exit at another door. Enter Old Lady Squeamish. Lady Squeam. Where is this harlotry, this impu dent baggage, this rambling Tomrigg ? O Sir Jas per, I'm glad to see you here ; did you not see my vile grandchild come in hither just now ? Sir Jasp. Yes. Lady Squeam. Ay, but where is she then ? where is she ? Lord, sir Jasper, I have e'en rattled myself to pieces in pursuit of her : but can you tell what makes she here ? they say below, no woman lodges here. Sir Jasp. No. Lady Squeam. No ! what does she here then ? say, if it be not a woman's lodging, what makes she here ? But are you sure no woman lodges here ? Horn. That's all their use of me, madam, you see. Mrs. Squeam. Come, sloven, I'll lead you, to be sure of you. [Pulls him by the cravat- Lady Squeam. Alas, poor man, how she tugs him ! Kiss, kiss her ; that's the way to make such nice women quiet. Horn. No, madam, that remedy is worse than the torment ; they know I dare suffer anything rather than do it. Lady Squeam. Prithee kiss her, and I'll give you her picture in little, that you admired so last night ; prithee do. Horn. Well, nothing but that could bribe me : I love a woman only in effigy, and good painting as much as I hate them. \u2014 I'll do't, for I could adore the devil well painted. [Kisses Mrs. Sbueamish. Mrs. Squeam. Foh, you filthy toad ! nay, now I've done jesting. Lady Squeam. Ha ! ha ! ha ! I told you so. Mrs. Squeam. Foh ! a kiss of his \u2014 Sir Jasp. Has no more hurt in't, than one of my spaniel's. Airs. Squeam. Nor no more good neither. Quack. I will now believe anything he tells me. [Aside- Sir Jasp. No, nor no man neither, this is Mr. Horner's lodging. Lady Squeam. Is it so, are you sure ? Sir Jasp. Yes, yes. Lady Squeam. So ; then there's no hurt in't, I hope. But where is he ? Sir Jasp. He's in the next room with my wife. Lady Squeam. Nay, if you trust him with your wife, I may with my Biddy.

What's here? another cuckold? he looks like one, and none else sure have any business with him. [Aside. Horn. What dost thou mean ? Pinch. Does the letter want a comment ? Then, know, sir, though I have been so civil a husband, as to bring you a letter from my wife, to let you kiss and court her to my face, I will not be a cuck old, sir, I will not. Horn. Thou art mad with jealousy. I never saw thy wife in my life but at the play yesterday, and I know not if it were she or no. I court her, kiss her ! Horn. Well, what brings my dear friend hither ? Pinch. Your impertinency. Horn. My impertinency ! \u2014 why, you gentle men that have got handsome wives, think you have a privilege of saying anything to your friends, and are as brutish as if you were our creditors. Pinch. No, sir, I'll ne'er trust you any way. Horn. But why not, dear Jack ? why diffide in me thou know'st so well ? Pinch. I will not be a cuckold, I say ; there will be danger in making me a cuckold. Horn. Why, wertthou not well cured of thy last clap ? P/nch. I wear a sword. Pinch. Because I do know you so well. Horn. Han't I been always thy friend, honest Jack, always ready to serve thee, in love or battle, before thou wert married, and am so still ? Horn. It should be taken from thee, lest thou shouldst do thyself a mischief with it ; thou art mad, man. Pinch. As mad as I am, and as merry as you are, I must have more reason from you ere we part. I say again, though you kissed and courted last night my wife in man's clothes, as she confesses in her letter\u2014 Pinch. I believe so, you would be my second now, indeed. Horn. Well then, dear Jack, why so unkind, so grum, so strange to me ? Come, prithee kiss me, dear rogue : gad I was always, I say, and am still as much thy servant as \u2014 Pinch. As I am yours, sir. What, you would send a kiss to my wife, is that it ? Horn. So, there 'tis \u2014 a man can't show his friendship to a married man, but presently he talks of his wife to you. Prithee, let thy wife alone, and let thee and I be all one, as we were wont. What, thou art as shy of my kindness, as a Lombard street alderman of a courtier's civility at Locket's ! Pinch.

Even from my wife, sir : am I not won drous kind and civil to you now too? \u2014 [Aside. ] But you'll not think her so. Horn. Ha ! is this a trick of his or hers ? Horn. Well, I must e'en acquiesce then, and be contented with what she writes. Pinch. I'll assure you 'twas voluntarily writ ; I had no hand in't you may believe me. Horn. I do believe thee, faith. Pinch. And believe her too, for she's an inno cent creature, has no dissembling in her : and so fare you well, sir. Horn. Pray, however, present my humble ser vice to her, and tell her, I will obey her letter to a tittle, and fulfil her desires, be what they will, or with what difficulty soever I do't ; and you shall be no more jealous of me, I warrant her, and you. [Aside. Pinch. The gentleman's surprised I find. \u2014 What, you expected a kinder letter ? Horn. No faith, not I, how could I ? Pinch. Yes, yes, I'm sure you did. A man so well made as you are, must needs be disappointed, if the women declare not their passion at first sight or opportunity. Horn. [Aside.] But what should this mean ? Stay, the postscript. \u2014 [Reads aside.] Be sure you love me, whatsoever my husband says to the contrary, and let him not see this, lest he should come home and pinch me, or kill my squirrel. \u2014 It seems he knows not what the letter contains. Pinch. Well then, fare you well ; and play with any man's honour but mine, kiss any mac's wife but mine, and welcome. [Exit, Horn. Ha ! ha ! ha ! doctor. Pinch. Come, ne'er wonder at it so much. Horn. Faith, I can't help it. Pinch. Now, I think I have deserved your infinite friendship and kindness, and have showed Quack. It seems, he has not heard the report of you, or does not believe it.

So are your cuckolds too originals : for they are like no other common cuckolds, and I will henceforth believe it not impossible for you to cuckold the Grand Signior amidst his guards of eunuchs, that I say. and a gentleman can't get a smack on't; but his servants, when his back is turned, broach it at their pleasures, and dust it away, ha ! ha ! ha !\u2014 'Gad, I am witty, I think, considering I was mar ried to-day, by the world ; but come \u2014 Horn.

My eyes are not gone ; I love a good prospect yet, and will not dine with you unless she does too ; go fetch her, therefore, but do not tell her husband 'tis for my sake. Spark. Well, I'll go try what I can do ; in the meantime, come away to my aunt's lodging, 'tis in the way to Pinchwife's. Horn.

But let women be never so modest the first day, they'll be sure to come to themselves by night, and I shall have enough of her then. In the mean time, Harry Horner, you must dine with me: I keep my wedding at my aunt's in the Piazza. Horn.

Well, 'tis e'en so, I have got the London disease they call love ; I am sick of my husband, and for my gallant. I have heard this distemper called a fever, but methinks 'tis like an ague ; for when I think of my husband, I tremble, and am in a cold sweat, and have inclinations to vomit ; but when I think of my gallant, dear Mr. Horner, my hot sit comes, and I am all in a fever indeed ; and, as in other fevers, my own chamber is tedious to me, and I would fain be removed to his, and then methinks I should be well. Ah, poor Mr. Hornet ! Well, I cannot, will not stay here ; therefore I'll make an end of my letter to him, which shall be a finer letter than my last, because I have studied it like anything. Oh sick, sick 1 [Takes the pen and writes [Aside. Spark. You sorry for't ? why, do you know any ill by her ? Horn. No, I know none but by thee ; 'tis for her sake, not yours, and another man's sake that might have hoped, I thought. Spark. Another man ! another man ! what is his name ? Horn. Nay, since 'tis past, he shall be nameless. \u2014 [Aside.] Poor Harcourt ! I am sorry thou hast missed her. Enter Mr. Pinchwife, who seeing her writing, steals softly behind her and looking over her shoulder, snatches the paper from her. Pinch. He seems to be much troubled at the match. [Aside. Pinch.

But with all my heart, for he may be of use to me hereafter ; for though my hunger is now my sauce, and I can fall on heartily without, the time will come, when a rival will be as good sauce for a married man to a wife, as an orange to veal. Horn. O thou damned rogue ! thou hast set my teeth on edge with thy orange. Spark. Then let's to dinner \u2014 there I was with you again. Come. Horn. But who dines with thee ? Spark. My friends and relations, my brother Pinchwife, you see, of your acquaintance. Horn. And his wife ? Spark.

Pinch. [Aside.] What a thing is a cuckold, that every fool can make him ridiculous! \u2014 [Aloud.] Well. sir \u2014 but let me advise you, now you are come to be concerned, because you suspect the danger, not to neglect tbe means to prevent it, especially when the greatest share of the malady will light upon your own head, for Hows'e'er the kind wife's belly comes to swell, The husband breeds for her, and first is ill.

Well, wife and sister are names which make us expect love and duty, pleasure and com fort ; but we find 'em plagues and torments, and are equally, though differently, troublesome to their keeper ; for we have as much ado to get people to lie with our sisters as to keep 'em from lying with our wives. Pinch. I must speak with her, to know whether Horner ever made her any promise, and whether she be married to Sparkish or no. Airs. Pinch. Pray, dear bud, don't, till I have spoken with her, and told her that I have told you all ; for she'll kill me else. Pinch. Go then, and bid her come out to me.

Pinch. Well, I resolve it, Horner shall have her : I'd rather give him my sister than lend him my wife ; and such an alliance will prevent his pretensions to my wife, sure. I'll make him of kin to her, and then he won't care for her. [Mrs. Pinchwife gives him her hand,- but when he lets her go, she steals softly on t'other side of him, and is led away by him for his sister Alithea. Re-enter Mrs. Pinchwife. Airs. Pinch.

Lack-a-day, she's ashamed to look you in the face ; and she says, if you go in to her, she'll run away down stairs, and shamefully go herself to Mr. Horner, who has pro mised her marriage, she says ; and she will have no other, so she won't. Quack. What, all alone? not so much as one of your cuckolds here, nor one of their wives ! They use to take their turns with you, as if they were to watch you. Horn. Yes, it often happens that a cuckold is but his wife's spy, and is more upon family duty when he is with her gallant abroad, hindering his pleasure, than when he is at home with her playing the gallant. But the hardest duty a married woman imposes upon a lover is keeping her hus band company always. Quack. And his fondness wearies you almost as soon as hers. Pinch. Did he so? \u2014 promise her marriage! \u2014 then she shall have no other. Go tell her so ; and if she will come and discourse with me a little con cerning the means, I will about it immediately. Go. \u2014 [F.xit Mrs. Pinchwife.] His estate is equal to Sparkish's, and his extraction as much better than his, as his parts are ; but my chief reason is, I'd rather be akin to him by the name of brother-in-law than that of cuckold. Horn. A pox ! keeping a cuckold company, after you have had his wife, is as tiresome as the company of a country squire to a witty fellow of the town, when he has got all his money. Quack. And as at first a man makes a friend of the husband to get the wife, so at last you are fain to fall out with the wife to be rid of the husband. Re-enter Mrs. Pinchwife. Well, what says she now ? Airs. Pinch. Why, she says, she would only have you lead her to Horner's lodging ; with whom she first will discourse the matter before she tslks with you, which yet she cannot do ; for alack, poor creature, she says she can't so much as look you in the face, therefore she'll come to you in a mask. And you must excuse her, if she make yon no answer to any question of yours, till you have brought her to Mr. Horner ; and if you will not chide her, nor question her, she'll come out to you immediately. Pinch. Let her come : I will not speak a word to her, nor require a word from her. Mrs. Pinch. Oh, I forgot : besides, she says, she cannot look you in the face, though through a mask ; therefore would desire you to put out the candle. Horn. Ay, most cuckold-makers are true cour tiers ; when once a poor man has cracked his credit for 'em, they can't abide to come near him. Quack. But at first, to draw him in, are so sweet, so kind, so dear! just as you are to Pinch wife. But what becomes of that intrigue with his wife ? Horn. A pox ! he's as surly as an alderman that has been bit ; and since he's so coy, his wife's kindness is in vain, for she's a silly innocent. Quack. Did she not send you a letter by him ? Horn. Yes ; but that's a riddle I have not yet solved. Allow the poor creature to be willing, she is silly too, and he keeps her up so close \u2014 Quack. Yes, so close, that he makes her but the more willing, and adds but revenge to her love ; which two, when met, seldom fail of satisfying each other one way or other. Pinch. I agree to all. Let her make haste \u2014 There, 'tis out \u2014 [Puts out the candle.

Pshaw 1 wench and pimp, paw words ; I know thou art an honest fellow, and hast a great acquaintance among the ladies, and perhaps hast made love for me, rather than let me make love to thy wife.

Nay, if this be her hand \u2014 for I never saw it. Pinch. 'Tis no matter whether that be her hand or no ; I am sure this hand, at her desire, led her to Mr. Horner, with whom I left her just now, to go fetch a parson to 'em at their desire too, to deprive you of her for ever ; for it seems yours was but a mock marriage.

And to show my un concernedness, I'll come to your wedding, and resign you with as much joy, as I would a stale wench to a new cully ;. nay, with as much joy as I would after the first night, if I had been married to you. There's for you ; and so your servant, servant. [Exit. Dain. and Airs. Squeam. Agreed. Lady Fidg. By this brimmer, for truth is no where else to be found \u2014 [Aside to Horner.] not in thy heart, false man ! Horn. You have found me a true man, I'm sure. [Aside to Lady Fidget. Lady Fidg. [Aside lo Horner.] Not every way. \u2014 But let us sit and be merry. [Sings. Why should our damn'd tyrants oblige us to I've On the pittance of pleasure which they only give ? We must not rejoice With wine and with noise ; In vain we must wake in a dull bed alone, Whilst to our warm rival the bottle they're gone. Alith. How was I deceived in a man ! Lucy.

Han't I heard you all declaim against wild men ? Then, sisters, lay't on, And damn a good shape. Lady Fidg. Yes ; but for all that, we think wildness in a man as desirable a quality as in a duck or rabbit : a tame man ! foh ! Dain. Dear brimmer ! Well, in token of our openness and plain-dealing, let us throw our masks over our heads. Horn. 1 know not, but your reputations fright ened me as much as your faces invited me. Lady Fidg. Our reputation ! Lord, why should you not think that we women make use of our reputation, as you men of yours, only to deceive the world with less suspicion? Our virtue is like the statesman's religion, the quaker's word, the gamester's oath, and the great man's honour ; but to cheat those that trust us. Horn. So, 'twill come to the glasses anon. [Aside. Mrs. Squeam. Lovely brimmer! let me enjoy him first. Lady Fidg. No, I never part with a gallant till I've tried him. Dear brimmer 1 that makest our husbands short-sighted. Dain.

And that demureness, coyness, and modesty, that you see in our faces in the boxes at plays, is as much a sign of a kind woman, as a vizard-mask in the pit. Dain. For, I assure you, women are least masked when they have the velvet vizard on. Lady Fidg. You would have found us modest women in our denials only. Airs. Squeam. Our bashfulness is only the reflec tion of the men's. Dain. And, as it were a husband, an old keeper. Mrs. Squeam. And an old grandmother. Horn. And an English bawd, and a French surgeon. Lady Fidg. Ay, we have all reason to curse 'em. Horn. For my sake, ladies ? Lady Fidg. No, for our own; for the first spoils all young gallants' industry. Dain. And the other's art makes 'em bold only with common women. Dain. We blush when they are shamefaced. Horn. I beg your pardon, ladies, I was deceived in you devilishly. But why that mighty pretence to honour ? Lady Fidg. We have told you ; hut sometimes 'twas for the same reason you men pretend busi ness often, to avoid ill company, to enjoy the better and more privately those you love. Horn. But why would you ne'er give a friend a wink then ? Airs. Squeam. And rather run the hazard of the vile distemper amongst them, than of a denial amongst us. Dain. The filthy toads choose mistresses now as they do stuffs, for having been fancied and worn by others. Mrs. Squeam. For being common and cheap. Lady Fidg. Whilst women of quality, like the richest stuffs, lie untumbled, and unasked for. Horn. Ay, neat, and cheap, and new, often they think best. Lady Fidg. Faith, your reputation frightened us, as much as ours did you, you were so notoriously lewd. Horn. And you so seemingly honest. Lady Fidg. Was that all that deterred you ? Horn. And so expensive \u2014 you allow freedom, you say. Dain. No, sir, the beasts will be known by a mistress longer than by a suit. Airs. Squeam. And 'tis not for cheapness neither. Lady Fidg. No ; for the vain fops will take up druggets, and embroider 'em. But I wonder at the depraved appetites of witty men ; they use to be out of the common road, and hate imitation. Pray tell me, beast, when you were a man, why you rather chose to club with a multitude in a common house for an entertainment, than to be the only guest at a good table. Horn. Why, faith, ceremony and expectation are unsufferable to those that are sharp bent. People always eat with the best stomach at an ordinary, where every man is snatching for the best bit. Lady Fidg. Ay, ay. Horn. That I was afraid of losing my little money, as well as my little time, both which my other pleasures required. Lady Fidg. Money ! foh ! you talk like a little fellow now : do such as we expect money ? Horn. I beg your pardon, madam, I must con fess, I have heard that great ladies, like great mer chants, set but the higher prizes upon what they have, because they are not in necessity of taking the first offer. Dain. Such as we make sale of our hearts ? Mrs. Squeam. We bribed for our love ? foh ! Horn. With your pardon, ladies, I know, like great men in offices, you seem to exact flattery and attendance only from your followers ; but you have receivers about you, and such fees to pay, a man is afraid to pass your grants. Besides, we must let you win at cards, or we lose your hearts ; and if you make an assignation, 'tis at a goldsmith's, jew eller's, or china-house ; where for your honour you deposit to him, he must pawn his to the punctual cit, and so paying for what you take up, pays for what he takes up. Dain. Would you not have us assured of our gallants' love ? Lady Fidg. Though he get a cut over the fingers. \u2014 But I have heard, that people eat most heartily of another man's meat, that is, what they do not pay for. Horn. When they are sure of their welcome and freedom ; for ceremony in love and eating is as ridi culous as in fighting ; falling on briskly is all should be done on those occasions. Lady Fidg.

Come, faith, madam, let us e'en pardon one another ; for all the difference I find betwixt we men and you women, we forswear ourselves at the beginning of an amour, you as long as it lasts. Horn.

Ridiculum acri Fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat res. \u2014 Horat. TO MY LADY B * *_ Madam,\u2014 Thongh I never had the honour to receive a favour from you, nay, or be known to you, I take the eonfidence of an author to write to you a billet-doux dedicatory ;\u2014 which is no new thing. For by most dedications it appears that authors, though they praise their patrons from top to toe, and 6eem to turn 'em inside out, know 'em as little as sometimes their patrons their hooks, though they read them out ; and if the poetical daubers did not write the name of the man or woman on top of the picture, 'twere impossible to guess whose it were. But you, Madam, without the help of a poet, have made yourself known and famous in the world ; and because you do not want it, are therefore most worthy of an epistle dedicatory. And this play claims naturally your protection, since it has lost its reputation with the ladies of stricter lives in the playhouse; and, you know, when men's endeavours are dis countenanced and refused by the nice coy women of honour, they come to you : \u2014 to you, the great and noble patroness of rejected and bashful men (of which number I profess myself to be one, though a poet, a dedicating poet), to you, I say, Madam, who have as discerning a judgment, in what's obscene or not, as any quick-sighted civil person of 'em all, and can make as much of a double-meaning saying as the best of 'em ; yet would not, as some do, make nonsense of a poet's jest, rather than not make it bawdy ; by which they show, they as little value wit in a play as in a lover, provided they can bring t'other thing about. Their sense, indeed, lies all one way, and therefore are only for that in a poet, which is moving, as they say. But what do they mean by that word moving ? Well, I must not put 'em to the blush, since I find I can do't. In short, Madam, you would not be one of those who ravish a poet's innocent words, and make 'em guilty of their own naughtiness (as 'tis termed) in spite of his teeth. Nay, nothing is secure from the power of their imaginations, no, not their husbands, whom they cuckold with themselves, by thinking of other men ; and so make the lawful matrimonial embraces adultery, wrong husbands and poets in thought and word, to keep their own reputations. But your ladyship's justice, I know, would think a woman's arraigning and damning a poet for her own obscenity like her crying out a rape, and hanging a man for giving her pleasure, only that she might be thought not to consent to't ; and so to vindicate her honour, forfeits her modesty. But you, Madam, have too much modesty to pretend to't, though you have as much to say for your modesty as many a nicer she : for you never were seen at this play, no, not the first day ; and 'tis no matter what people's lives have been, they are unquestionably modest who frequent not this play. For, as Mr. Bayes says of his, That it is the only touchstone of men's wit and understanding ; mine is, it seems, the only touchstone of women's virtue and modesty. But hold, that touchstone is equivocal, and, by the strength of a lady's imagination, may become something that is not civil : but your ladyship, I know, scorns to misapply a touchstone. And, Madam, though you have not seen this play, I hope (like other nice ladies) you will the rather read it. Yet, lest the chambermaid or page should not be trusted, and their indulgence could gain no further admittances for it than to their ladies' lobbies or outward rooms, take it into your care and protection ; for by your recommendation and procurement, it may have the honour to get into their closets ; for what they renounce in public, often entertains \"em there, with your help especially. In fine, Madam, for these and many other reasons, you are the fittest patroness or judge of this play ; for you show no partiality to this or that author. For from some many ladies will take a broad jest as cheerfully as from the watermen, and sit at some downright filthy plays (as they call 'em) as well satisfied, and as still, as a poet could wish 'em elsewhere. Therefore it must be the doubtful obscenity of my play alone they take exceptions at, because it is too bashful for 'em : and, indeed, most women hate men for attempting by halves on their chastity ; and bawdy, I find, like satire, should be home, not to have it taken notice of. But, now I mention satire, some there are who say, 'Tis the plain-dealing of the play, not the obscenity ; 'tis taking off the ladies' masks, not offering at their petticoats, which offends 'em :\u2014 and generally they are not the handsomest, or most innocent, who are the most angry at their being discovered : \u2014 Nihil est audacius illis Deprensis ; iram atque animos a crimine sumunt. Pardon, Madam, the quotation ; for a dedication can no more be without ends of Latin, than flattery : and 'tis no matter whom it is writ to ; for an author can as easily, I hope, suppose people to have more understanding and languages than they have, as well as more virtues. But why, the devil, should any of the few modest and handsome be alarmed?\u2014 for some there are, who, as well as any, deserve those attributes, yet refrain not from seeing this play, nor think it any addition to their virtue to set up for it in a playhouse, lest there it should look too much like acting\u2014 but why, I say, should any at all of the truly virtuous be concerned, if those who are not so are distinguished from \"em ? for by that mask of modesty which women wear promiscuously in public, they are all alike ; and you can no more know a kept wench from a woman of honour by her looks than by her dress. For those who are of quality without honour (if any such there are) they have their quality to set off their false modesty, as well as their false jewels ; and you must no more siiBpect their countenances for counterfeit than their pendants, though as the plain dealer Montaigne says, Els envoy leur conscience au bordel, et tiennent leur continence en regie. But those who act as they look, ought not to be scandalised at the reprehension of others' faults, lest they tax themselves with 'em, and by too delicate and quick an apprehension not only make that obscene which I meant innocent, but that satire on all. which was intended only on those who"], [197, "THE PLAIN DEALER. 103 deserved it. But, Madam, I beg your pardon for this digression to civil women and ladies of honour, since you and I shall never be the better for 'em : for a comic poet and a lady of your profession make most of the other sort ; and the stage and your houses, like our plantations, are propagated by the least nice women ; and, as with the ministers of justice, the vices of the age are our best business. But now I mention public persons, I can no longer defer doing you the justice of a dedication, and telling you your own, who are, of all public-spirited people, the most necessary, most communicative, most generous and hospitable. Your house has been the house of the people ; your sleep still disturbed for the public ; and when you arose, 'twas that others might lie down ; and you waked that others might rest : the good you have done is unspeakable. How many young inexperienced heirs have you kept from rash foolish marriages, and from being jilted for their lives by the worst sort of jilts, wives! How many unbewitched widowers* children have you preserved from the tyranny of stepmothers ! How many old doters from cuckoldom, and keeping other men's wenches and children ! How many adulteries and unnatural sins have you prevented .* In fine, you have been a constant scourge to the old lecher, and often a terror to the young : you have made concupiscence its own punishment, and extinguished lust with lust, like blowing up of houses to stop the fire. Nimirum propter continentiam, incontinentia Necessaria est, incendium ignibus extinguitur. There's Latin for you again, Madam : I protest to you, as I am an author, I cannot help it ; nay, I can hardly keep myself from quoting Aristotle and Horace, and talking to you of the rules of writing, (like the French authors), to show you and my reader I understand 'em, in my epistle, lest neither of you should find it out by the play. And according to the rules of dedications, 'tis no matter whether you understand or no what I quote or say to you of writing ; for an author can as easily make any one a judge or critic in an epistle, as a hero in his play. But, Madam, that this may prove to the end a true epistle dedicatory, I'd have you know 'tis not without a design upon you, which is in the behalf of the fraternity of Parnassus ; that songs and sonnets may go at your houses, and in your liberties, for guineas and half-guineas ; and that wit, at least with you, as of old, may he the price of beauty, and so you will prove a true encourager of poetry ; for love is a better help to it than wine ; and poets, like painters, draw better after the life than by fancy. Nay, in justice, Madam, I think a poet ought to be as free of your houses, as of the playhouses; since he contributes to the support of both, and is as necessary to such as you, as a ballad-singer to a pick-purse, in convening the cullies at the theatres, to he picked up and carried to supper and bed at your houses. And, Madam, the reason of this motion of mine is, because poor poets can get no favour in the tiring-rooms, for they are no keepers, you know ; and folly and money, the old enemies of wit, are even too bard for it on its own dunghill : and for other ladies, a poet can least go to the price of them. Besides, his wit, which ought to recommend him to 'em, is as much an obstruction to his love, as to his wealth or preferment ; for most women now-a-days apprehend wit in a lover, as much as in a husband ; they hate a man that knows 'em, they must have a blind easy fool, whom they can lead by the nose ; and, as the Scythian women of old, must baffle a man, and put out his eyes, ere they will lie with him ; and then too like thieves, when they have plundered and stripped a man, leave him. But if there should be one of a hundred of those ladies generous enough to give herself to a man that has more wit than money, (all things considered,) he would think it cheaper coming to you for a mistress, though you made him pay his guinea ; as a man in a journey (out of good husbandry), had better pay for what he has at an inn, than lie on free-cost at a gentleman's house. In fine, Madam, like a faithful dedicator, I hope I have done myself right in the first place ; then you, and your profession, which in the wisest and most religious government in the world is honoured with the public allowance ; and in those that are thought the most uncivilised and barbarous is protected and supported by the ministers of justice. And of you, Madam, I ought to say no more here, for your virtues deserve a poem rather than an epistle, or a volume entire to give the world your memoirs, or life at large ; and which (upon the word of an author that has a mind to make an end of his dedication) I promise to do, when I write the annals of our British love, which shall be dedicated to the ladies concerned, if they will not think them something too obscene too ; when your life, compared with many that are thought Innocent, I doubt not, may vindicate you, and me, to the world, for the confidence I have taken in this address to you; which then may be thought neither impertinent nor immodest; and, whatsoever your amorous misfortunes have been, none can charge you with that heinous, and worst of women's crimes, hypocrisy ; nay, in spite of misfortunes or age, you are the same woman still ; though most of yoTur sex grow Magdalens ut fifty, and as a solid .French author has it\u2014 Apres le plaisir, vient la peine ; Apres la peine, la vertu. But sure an old sinner's continency is much like a gamester's forswearing play, when he had lost all his money; and modesty is a kind of a youthful dress, which, as it makes a young woman more amiable, makes an old one more nauseous : a bashful old woman is like a hopeful old man ; and the affected chastity of antiquated beauties is rather a reproach than an honour to 'em ; for it shows the men's virtue only, not theirs. But you, in fine, Madam, are no more a hypocrite than I am when I praise you ; therefore I doubt not will be thought (even by yours and the play's enemies, the nicest ladies) to be the fittest patroness for, Madam, your ladyship's most obedient, faithful, humble servant, and THE PLAIN DEALER.

I the Plain Dealer am to act to-day, And my rough part begins before the play. First, you who scribble, yet hate all that write, And keep each other company in spite, As rivals in your common mistress, fame, And with faint praises one another damn ; 'Tis a good play, we know, you can't forgive, But grudge yourselves the pleasure you receive : Our scribbler therefore bluntly bid me say, He would not have the wits pleased here to-day. Next, you, the fine, loud gentlemen o' th' pit, Who damn all plays, yet, if y'ave any wit, 'Tis but what here you spunge and daily get ; Poets, like friends to whom you are in debt, You hate ; and so rooks laugh, to see undone Those pushing gamesters whom they live upon. Well, you are sparks, and still will be i'th' fashion Rail then at .plays, to hide your obligation. Now, you shrewd judges, who the boxes sway, Leading the ladies' hearts and sense astray, And, for their sakes, see all, and \"hear no play ; Correct your cravats, foretops, lock behind ; The dress and breeding of the play ne'er mind ; Plain dealing is, you'll say, quite out of fashion ; You'll hate it here, as in a dedication : And your fair neighbours, in a limning poet No more than in a painter will allow it. Pictures too like the ladies will not please ; They must be drawn too here like goddesses. You, as at Lely's too, would truncheon wield, And look like heroes in a painted field. But the coarse dauber of the coming scenes, To follow life and nature only means, Displays you as you are, makes his fine woman A mercenary jilt, and true to no man : His men of wit and pleasure of the age Are as dull rogues as ever cumber'd stage : He draws a friend only to custom just, And makes him naturally break his trust. I only act n part, like none of you, And yet you'll say, it is a fool's part too : An honest man who, like you, never winks At faults ; but, unlike you, speaks what he thinks ; The only fool who ne'er found patron yet, For truth is now a fault as well as wit. And where else, but on stages, do we see Truth pleasing, or rewarded honesty ? Which our bold poet does this day in me. If not to th' honest, be to th' prosperous kind, Some friends at court let the Plain Dealer find. ACT i. SCENE I.-Manly's Lodging. Alan. Upon your title, my lord, if you'd have me believe you. Plaus. Well, then, as I am a person of honour, I never attempted to abuse or lessen any person in my life. Man. What, you were afraid ? Plaus. No ; but seriously, I hate to do a rude thing : no, faith, I speak well of all mankind. Alan. I thought so : but know, that speaking well of all mankind is the worst kind of detraction ; for it takes away the reputation of the few good men in the world, by making all alike. Now, I speak ill of most men, because they deserve it ; I that can do a rude thing, rather than an unjust thing. Plaus. Well, tell not me, my dear friend, what people deserve ; I ne'er mind that. I, like an author in a dedication, never speak well of a man for his sake, but my own ; I will not disparage any man, to disparage myself: for to speak ill of people behind their backs, is not like a person of honour; and, truly, to speak ill of 'em to their faces, is not like a complaisant person. But if I did say or do an ill thing to anybody, it should be sure to be behind their backs, out of pure good manners. Enter Manly, surlily, my Lord Plausible following him; and two Sailors behind. Man. Tell not me, my good lord Plausible, of your decorums, supercilious forms, and slavish ceremonies ! your little tricks, which you, the spaniels of the world, do daily over and over, for and to one another ; not out of love or duty, but your servile fear. Plans. Nay, i'faith, i'faith, you are too pas sionate ; and I must humbly beg your pardon and leave to tell you, they are the arts and rules the prudent of the world walk by. Alan. Let 'em. But I '11 have no leading-strings ; I can walk alone : I hate a harness, and will not tug on in a faction, kissing my leader behind, that another slave may do the like to me. Plans. What, will you be singular then, like nobody? follow, love, and esteem nobody ? Alan. Rather than be general, like you, follow everybody; court and kiss everybody; though perhaps at the same time you hate everybody. Plans. Why, seriously, with your pardon, my dear friend \u2014 Alan. With your pardon, my no friend, I will not, as you do, whisper my hatred or my scorn ; call a man fool or knave by signs or mouths over his shoulder, whilst you have him in your arms. For such as you, like common whores and pickpockets, are only dangerous to those you embrace. Plaus. Such as I ! Heavens defend me !\u2014 upon my honour \u2014 Man. Very well ; but I, that am an unmannerly sea-fellow, if I ever speak well of people, (which is very seldom indeed,) it should be sure to be behind their backs ; and if I would say or do ill to any, it should be to their faces. I would jostle a proud, strutting, overlooking coxcomb, at the head of his sycophants, rather than put out my tongue at him when he were past me ; would frown"], [199, "THE PLAIN DEALER PCKNK I. 105 in the arrogant, big, dull face of an overgrown knave of business, rather than vent my spleen against him when his back were turned ; would give fawning slaves the lie whilst they embrace or commend me ; cowards whilst they brag ; call a rascal by no other title, though his father had left him a duke's ; laugh at fools aloud before their mistresses; and must desire people to leave me, when their visits grow at last as troublesome as they were at first impertinent. Plaus. I would not have my visits troublesome. Alan. The only way to be sure not to have 'em troublesome, is to make 'em when people are not at home ; for your visits, like other good turns, are most obliging when made or done to a man in bis absence. A pox ! why should any one, because he has nothing to do, go and disturb another man's business ? and leave to have saved black Kate of Wapping's small venture. 1 Sail. Faith, I forgive him, since, as the purser told me, he sunk the value of five or six thousand pound of his own, with which he was to settle him self somewhere in the Indies; for our merry lieu tenant was to succeed him in his commission for the ship back ; for he was resolved never to return again for England. 2 Sail. So it seemed, by his fighting. 1 Sail. No ; but he was a-weary of this side of the world here, they say. 2 Sail. Ay, or else he would not have bid so fair for a passage into t'other. 1 Sail. Jack, thou thinkest thyself in the fore castle, thou'rt so waggish. But I tell you, then, he had a mind to go live and bask himself on the sunny side of the globe. 2 Sail. What, out of any discontent ? for he's always as dogged as an old tarpaulin, when hin dered of a voyage by a young pantaloon captain. 1 Sail. 'Tis true I never saw him pleased but in the fight ; and then he looked like one of us com ing from the pay-table, with a new lining to our hats under our arms. Plaus. I beg your pardon, my dear friend. \u2014 What, you have business ? Alan. If you have any, I would not detain your lordship. Plaus. Detain me, dear sir ! \u2014 I can never have enough of your company. Alan. I'm afraid I should be tiresome : I know not what you think. 2 Sail. A pox ! he's like the bay of Biscay, rough and angry, let the wind blow where 'twill. 1 Sail. Nay, there's no more dealing with him, than with the land in a storm, no near \u2014 2 Sail. 'Tis a hurry-durry blade. Dost thou remember after we had tugged hard the old leaky long-boat to save his life, when I welcomed him ashore, he gave me a box on the ear, and called me fawning water-dog? Plaus. Well, dear sir, I see you'd have me gone. Man. But I see you won't. [Aside. Plaus. Your most faithful \u2014 Alan. God be w'ye, my lord. Plaus. Your most humble \u2014 Man. Farewell. Plaus. And eternally \u2014 Man. And eternally ceremony \u2014 [Aside.] Then the devil take thee eternally. Plaus. You shall use no ceremony, by my life. Alan. I do not intend it. Re-enter Manly with Freeman, 1 Sail. Hold thy peace, Jack, and stand by ; the foul weather's coming. Man. You rascals 1 dogs! how could this tame thing get through you ? 1 Sail. Faith, to tell your honour the truth, we were at hob in the hall, and whilst my brother and I were quarrelling about a cast, he slunk by us. 2 Sail. He's a sneaking fellow I warrant for't. Man. Have more care for the future, you slaves. Go, and with drawn cutlasses stand at the stair foot, and keep all that ask for me from coming up ; suppose you were guarding the scuttle to the powder-room. Let none enter here, at your and their peril. 1 Sail. No, for the danger would be the same : you would blow them and us up, if we should. 2 Sail. Must no one come to you, sir ? Alan. No man, sir. Plaus. Why do you stir then ? Man. Only to see you out of doors, that I may shut 'em against more welcomes. Plaus. Nay, faith, that shall not pass upon your most faithful humble servant. Alan. Nor this any more upon me. [Aside. Plaus. Well, you are too strong for me. Man. [Aside.] I'd sooner be visited by the plague ; for that only would keep a man from visits, and his doors shut. [Exit, thrusting out my Lord Plausible. 1 Sail. Here's a finical fellow, Jack ! What a brave fair-weather captain of a ship he would make! 2 Sail. He a captain of a ship ! it must be when she's in the dock then ; for he looks like one of those that get the king's commissions for hulls to sell a king's ship, when a brave fellow has fought her almost to a long-boat. 1 Sail. On my conscience then, Jack, that's the reason our bully tar sunk our ship ; not only that the Dutch might not have her, but that the cour tiers, who laugh at wooden legs, might not make her prize. 2 Sail. A pox of his sinking, Tom ! we have made a base, broken, short voyage of it. 1 Sail. Ay, your brisk dealers in honour always make quick returns with their ships to the dock, and their men to the hospitals. 'Tis, let me see, just a month since we set out of the river, and the wind was almost as cross to us as the Dutch. 1 Sail. No man, sir; but a woman then, an't like your honour \u2014 Alan. No woman neither, you impertinent dog ! Would you be pimping ? a sea-pimp is the strangest monster she has. 2 Sail. Indeed, an't like your honour, 'twill be hard for us to deny a woman anything, since we are so newly come on shore. 1 Sail. We'll let no old woman come up, though it were our trusting landlady at Wapping. Alan. Would you be witty, you brandy casks you ? you become a jest as ill as you do a horse. Begone, you dogs ! I hear a noise on the stairs. [Exeunt Sailors. 2 Sail. Well, I forgive him sinking my own poor truck, if he would but have given me time Free. Faith, I am sorry you would let the fop go, I intended to have had some sport with him."], [200, "THE PLAIN DEALER. 106 ACT I. Man. Sport with him ! A pox ! then, why did you not stay ? You should have enjoyed your coxcomb, and had him to yourself for me. Free. No, I should not have cared for him with out you neither ; for the pleasure which fops af ford is like that of drinking, only good when 'tis shared ; and a fool, like a bottle, which would make you merry in company, will make you dull alone. But how the devil could you turn a man of his quality down stairs ? Yrou use a lord with very little ceremony, it seems. Man. A lord ! What, thou art one of those who esteem men only by the marks and value fortune has set upon 'em, and never consider intrinsic worth ! but counterfeit honour will not be current with me : I weigh the man, not his title ; 'tis not the king's stamp can make the metal better or heavier. Your lord is a leaden shilling, which you bend every way, and debases the stamp he bears, instead of being raised by it.\u2014 Here again, you slaves 1 Man. I must confess, I am so much your friend, I would not deceive you ; therefore must tell you, not only because my heart is taken up, but accord. ing to your rules of friendship, I cannot be your friend. Free. Why, pray ? Man. Because he that is, you'll say, a true friend to a man, isa friend to all his friends. But you must pardon me, I cannot wish well to pimps, flatterers, detractors, and cowards, stiff-nodding knaves, and supple, pliant, kissing fools. Now, all these I have seen you use like the dearest friends in the world. Free. Ha ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 What, you observed me, I warrant, in the galleries at Whitehall, doing the business of the place? Pshaw ! Court-profes sions, like court promises, go for nothing, man. But, faith, could you think I was a friend to all those I hugged, kissed, flattered, bowed to? Ha! ha!\u2014 Man. You told 'em so, and swore it too ; I heard you. Free. Ay, but when their backs were turned, did not I tell you they were rogues, villains, rascals, whom I despised and hated ? Man. Very fine ! But what reason had I to be lieve you spoke your heart to me, since you pro fessed deceiving so many ? Free. Why, don't you know, good captain, that telling truth is a quality as prejudicial to a man that would thrive in the world, as square play to a cheat, or true love to a whore? Would you have a man speak truth to his ruin ? You are severer than the law, which requires no man to swear against himself. Yrou would have me speak truth against myself I warrant, and tell my promising friend the courtier, he has abad memory. Man. Y\"es. Re enter Sailors. 1 Sail. Only to receive farther instructions, an't like your honour. \u2014 What if a man should bring you money, should we turn him back ? Alan. AH men, I say : must I be pestered with you too ? \u2014 Y'ou dogs, away ! 2 Sail. Nay, I know one man your honour would not have us hinder coming to you, I'm sure. Man. Who's that ? speak quickly, slaves. 2 Sail. Why, a man that should bring you a challenge. For though you refuse money, I'm sure you love fighting too well to refuse that. Man. Rogue ! rascal ! dog ! [Kicks the Sailors out. Free. Nay, let the poor rogues have their fore castle jests : they cannot help 'em in a fight, scarce when a ship's sinking. Man. Damn their untimely jests ! a servant's jest is more sauciness than his counsel. Free. But what, will you see nobody ? not your friends ? Free. And so make him remember to forget my business? And I should tell the great lawyer too, that he takes oftener fees to hold his tongue, than to speak ? Man. No doubt on't. Man. Friends ! \u2014 I have but one, and he, I hear, is not in town ; nay, can have but one friend, for a true heart admits but of one friendship, as of one love. But in having that friend, I have a thousand ; for he has the courage of men in despair, yet the diffidency and caution of cowards ; thesecrecy of the revengeful, and the constancy of martyrs; one fit to advise, to keep a secret, to fight and die for his friend. Such I think him ; for I have trusted him with my mistress in my absence : and the trust of beauty is sure the greatest we can show. Free. Well, but all your good thoughts are not for him alone, I hope ? Pray what d'ye think of me for a friend ? Free. Ay, and have him hang or ruin me, when he should come to be a judge, and I before him ? And you would have me tell the new officer, who bought his employment lately, that he is a coward ? Man. Ay. Free. And so get myself cashiered, not him, he having the better friends, though I the better sword ? And I should tell the scribbler of honour, that heraldry were a prettier and fitter study for so fine a gentleman than poetry? Man. Certainly. Free. And so find myself mauled in his next hired lampoon ? And you would have me tell the holy lady, too, she lies with her chaplain ? Man. No doubt on't. Man. Of thee 1 Why, thou art a latitudinarian in friendship, that is, no friend ; thou dost side with all mankind, but wilt suffer for none. Thou art indeed like your lord Plausible, the pink of courtesy, therefore hast no friendship : for cere mony and great professing renders friendship as much suspected as it does religion. Free, And no professing, no ceremony at all in friendship, were as unnatural and as undecent as in religion : and there is hardly such a thing as an honest hypocrite, who professes himself to be worse than he is, unless it be yourself ; for though I could never get you to say you were my friend, I know you'll prove so. Free. And so draw the clergy upon my back, and want a good table to dine at sometimes ? And by the same reason too, I should tell you that the world thinks you a mad man, a brutal, and have you cut my throat, or worse, hate me. What other good success of all my plain-dealing could I have, than what I've mentioned ? Man. Why, first, your promising courtier would keep his word out of fear of more reproaches, or at least would give you no more vain hopes : your law yer would serve you more faithfully ; for he, having no honour but his interest, is truest still to him he"], [201, "THE PLAIN DEALER. SCENE I. 107 knows suspects him : the new officer would pro voke thee to make him a coward, and so be cashiered, that thou, or some other honest fellow, who had more courage than money, might get his place : the noble sonnetteer would trouble thee no more with his madrigals : the praying lady would leave off railing at wenching before thee, and not turn away her chambermaid for her own known frailty with thee : and I, instead of hating thee, should love thee for thy plain dealing ; and in lieu of being mortified, am proud that the world and I think not well of one another. Free. Well, doctors differ. You are for plain dealing, I find : but against your particular notions, I have the practice of the whole world. Observe but any morning what people do when they get together on the Exchange, in Westminster-hall, or the galleries in Whitehall. Man. I must confess, there they seem to rehearse Bayes's grand dance. Here you see a bishop bow ing low to a gaudy atheist ; a judge to a door keeper ; a great lord to a fishmonger, or scrivener with a jack-chain about his neck ; a lawyer to a sergeant-at-arms ; a velvet physician to a thread bare chemist ; and a supple gentleman-usher to a surly beefeater : and so tread round in a preposte rous huddle of ceremony to each other, whilst they can hardly hold their solemn false countenances. Free. Well, they understand the world. Man. Which I do not, I confess. old liar, is believed when she speaks wonders of you : you cannot be flattered, sir, your merit is unspeakable. Alan. Hold, hold, sir, or I shall suspect worse of you, that you have been a cushion-bearer to some state-hypocrite, and turned away by the chaplains, for out-flattering their probation-sermons for a benefice. Fid. Suspect me for anything, sir. hut the want of love, faith, and duty to you, the bravest, wor thiest of mankind ; believe me, I cuuld die for you, sir. Man. Nay, there you lie, sir ; did not I see thee mere afraid in the fight than the chaplain of the ship, or the purser that bought his place ? Fid. Can he be said to be afraid, that ventures to sea with you ? Man. Fy ! f y ! no more ; I shall hate thy flat tery worse than thy cowardice, nay, than thy bragging. Fid. Well, I own then I was afraid, mightily afraid : yet for you I would be afraid again, a hun dred times afraid. Dying is ceasing to be afraid, and that I could do sure for you, and you'll believe me one day. [Weeps. Free. Poor youth ! believe his eyes, if not his tongue : he seems to speak truth with them. Man. What, does he cry ? A pox on't ! a maudlin flatterer is as nauseously troublesome as a maudlin drunkard. \u2014 No more, you little milksop, do not cry, I'll never make thee afraid again ; for of all men, if 1 had occasion, thou shouldst not be my second ; and when I go to sea again, thou shalt venture thy life no more with me. Fid. Why, will you leave me behind then ? \u2014 [Aside.] If you would preserve my life, I'm sure you should not. Man. Leave thee behind ! ay, ay, thou art a hopeful youth for the shore only. Here thou wilt live to be cherished by fortune and the great ones ; for thou mayst easily come to out-flatter a dull poet, outlie a coffee-house or gazette-writer, out swear a knight of the post, outwatch a pimp, out fawn a rook, outpromise a lover, outrail a wit, and outbrag a sea-captain : \u2014 all this thou canst do, because thou'rt a coward, a thing I hate ; therefore thou'lt do better with the world than with me, and these are the good courses you must take in the world. There's good advice, at least, at parting ; go, and be happy with't. Fid. Parting, sir ! O let me not hear that dis mal word. Free. But, sir, pray believe the friendship I promise you real, whatsoever I have professed to others : try me, at least. Man. Why, what would you do for me? Free. I would fight for you. Man. That you would do for your own honour. But what else ? Free. I would lend you money, if I had it. Man. To borrow more of me another time. That were putting your money to interest ; a usurer would be as good a friend. \u2014 But what other piece of friendship ? Free. I would speak well of you to your enemies. Man. To encourage others to be your friends, by a show of gratitude. \u2014 But what else? Free. Nay, I would not hear you ill spoken of behind your back by my friend. Man. Nay, then, thou'rt a friend, indeed. \u2014 But it were unreasonable to expect it from thee, as the world goes now, when new friends, like new mis tresses, are got by disparaging old ones. Enter FinELiA. Man. If my words frighten thee, begone the sooner ; for to be plain with thee, cowardice and 1 cannot dwell together. Fid. And cruelty and courage never dwelt toge ther sure, sir. Do not turn me off to shame and misery, for I am helpless and friendless. Man. Friendless ! there are half a score friends for thee then. \u2014 [Offers her gold.] I leave myself no more : they'll help thee a little.

Strange charms indeed ! she has beauty enough to call in question her wit or virtue, and her form would make a starved hermit a ravisher ; yet her virtue and conduct would preserve her from the subtle lust of a pampered prelate. She is so per fect a beauty, that art could not better it, nor affec tation deform it. Yet all this is nothing. Her tongue as well as face ne'er knew artifice ; nor ever did her words or looks contradict her heart. She is all truth, and hates the lying, masking, daubing world, as I do : for which I love her, and for which I think she dislikes not me. For she has often shut out of her conversation for mine, the gaudy fluttering parrots of the town, apes and echoes of men only, and refused their common-place pert chat, flattery and submissions, to be enter tained with my sullen bluntness, and honest love : and, last of all, swore to me, since her parents would not suffer her to go with me, she wo'jld stay behind for no other man ; but follow me without their leave, if not to be obtained. Which oath \u2014 - Re-enter Fidelia, Fid. Dear sir, you have pity ; beget but some in our captain for me. Free. Where is he ? Fid. Within ; swearing as much as he did in the great storm, and cursing you, and sometimes sinks into calms and sighs, and talks of his Olivia. Free. He would never trust me to see her. \u2014 Is she handsome ? Fid. No, if you'll take my word : but I am not a proper judge. Free. What is she ? Fid. A gentlewoman, I suppose, but of as mean a fortune as beauty ; but her relations would not suffer her to go with him to the Indies : and his aversion to this side of the world, together with the late opportunity of commanding the convoy, would not let him stay here longer, though to enjoy her. Free. He loves her mightily then ? Fid. Yes, so well, that the remainder of his for tune (I hear about five or six thousand pounds) he has left her, in case he had died by the way, or before she could prevail with her friends to follow him ; which he expected she should do, and has left behind him his great bosom friend to be her convoy to him. Free. What charms has she for him, if she be not handsome ? Free. Did you think she would keep ? Alan. Yes ; for she is not (I tell you) like other women, but can keep her promise, though she has sworn to keep it. But, that she might the better keep it, I left her the value of five or six thousand pounds : for women's wants are generally the most importunate solicitors to love or marriage. Free. And money summons lovers more than beauty, and augments but their importunity, and their number ; so makes it the harder for a woman to deny 'em. For my part, I am for the French maxim: \u2014 If you would have your female subjects loyal, keep 'em poor. \u2014 But, in short, that your mistress may not marry, you have given her a por tion. Fid. He fancies her, I suppose, the only woman of truth and sincerity in the world. Free. No common beauty, I confess. Fid. Or else sure he would not have trusted her with so great a share of his fortune, in his absence, I suppose (since his late loss) all he has. Free. Why, has he left it in her own custody ? Fid. I am told so. Alan. She had given me her heart first, and I am satisfied with the security ; I can never doubt her truth and constancy. Free. It seems you do, since you are fain to bribe it with money. But how come you to be so diffi dent of the man that says he loves you, and not doubt the woman that says it ? Alan. I should, I confess, doubt the love of any other woman but her, as I do the friendship of any other man but him I have trusted ; but I have such proofs of their faith as cannot deceive me. Free. Cannot ! Free. Then he has showed love to her indeed, in leaving her, like an old husband that dies as soon as he has made his wife a good jointure. \u2014 But I'll go in to him, and speak for you, and know more from him of his Olivia. [Exit. Fid. His Olivia, indeed, his happy Olivia ! Yet she was left behind, when I was with him : But she was ne'er out of his mind or heart. She has told him she loved him ; I have show'd it.

Truly, cousin, I can find no fault with it, but that we cannot always live in't, for I can never be weary of it. Oliv. O hideous ! you cannot be in earnest sure, when you say you like the filthy world. Eliza. Y'ou cannot be in earnest sure, when you say you dislike it. Oliv. You are a very censorious creature, I find. Eliza.

Or like a Holborn lady, who could not get in to the last ball, or was out of countenance in the drawing-room the last Sunday of her appearance there. For none rail at the court but those who cannot get into it, or else who are ridiculous when they are there ; and I shall suspect you were laughed at when you were last there, or would be a maid of honour.

Ay, 'Us because your ladyship wears 'em too long ; for indeed a gown, like a gallant, grows one's aversion by having too much of it. Oliv. Insatiable creature !

Nov. Well ; but who the devil were they ? Plaus. The honour of our nation ! the glory of our age ! Ah, I could dwell a twelvemonth on their praise ; which indeed I might spare by telling their names ; sir John Current and sir Richard Court- Title. Plaus.

As familiar a duck \u2014 Nov. Court-Title ! ha ! ha ! Oliv. And sir John Current ! Why will you keep such a wretch company, my lord ? Plaus. O madam, seriously you are a little too severe ; for he is a man of unquestioned reputation in everything. Oliv. Yes, because he endeavours only with the women to pass for a man of courage, and with the bullies for a wit ; with the wits for a man of business, and with the men of business for a favour ite at court ; and at court for city-security. Nov. And for sir Richard, he \u2014 Nov. As an actress in the tiring-room. There I was once beforehand with you, madam. Plaus. Mrs. Hoyden ! a poor, affable, good natured soul.

He loves a lord indeed ; but \u2014 \u25a0 Nov. No ! \u2014 Pray let me speak, madam. Oliv. First, can any one be called beautiful that squints ? Plaus. Her eyes languish a little, I own. Nov. Languish ! ha ! ha ! Oliv. Languish ! \u2014 Then, for her conduct, she was seen at the Country Wife after the first day. There's for you, my lord. Plaus. But, madam, she was not seen to use her fan all the play long, turn aside her head, or by a conscious blush discover more guilt than modesty. Oliv. Very fine ! Then you think a woman modest that sees the hideous Country Wife without blushing, or publishing her detestation of it ? D'ye hear him, cousin ? Nov. Pray, dear madam, let me have but a bold stroke or two at his picture. He loves a lord, as you say, though \u2014 Oliv. Though he borrowed his money, and ne'er paid him again. Nov. And would bespeak a place three days before at the back-end of a lord's coach to Hyde park. Plaus. Nay, i'faith, i'faith, you are both too severe. Oliv. Then to show yet more his passion for quality, he makes love to that fulsome coach-load of honour, my lady Goodly, for he's always at her lodging. Plaus. Because it is the conventicle-gallant, the meeting-house of all the fair ladies, and glorious superfine beauties of the town. Nov. Very fine ladies ! there's first \u2014 Oliv . Her honour, as fat as an hostess. Eliza. Yes, and am, I must confess, something of his opinion ; and think, that as an over-conscious fool at a play, by endeavouring to show the author's want of wit, exposes his own to more censure, so may a lady call her own modesty in question, by publicly cavilling with the poet's. For all those grimaces of honour and artificial modesty disparage a woman's real virtue, as much as the use of white and red does the natural complexion : and you must use very, very little, if you would have it thought your own. Oliv. Then you would have a woman of honour with passive looks, ears, and tongue, undergo all the hideous obscenity she hears at nasty plays. Eliza. Truly, I think a woman betrays her want of modesty, by showing it publicly in a playhouse, as much as a man does his want of courage by a quarrel there ; for the truly modest and stout say least, and are least exceptious, especially in public. Oliv. O hideous, cousin ! this cannot be your opinion. But you are one of those who have the confidence to pardon the filthy play. Eliza. Why, what is there of ill in't, say you ? Oliv. O fy ! f y ! fy ! would you put me to the blush anew ? call all the blood into my face again ? But to satisfy you then ; first, the clandestine obsce nity in the very name of Horner. Eliza.

But you can say nothing sure against the superfine mistress \u2014 Oliv. I know who you mean. She is as censo rious and detracting a jade as a superannuated sinner. Plaus.

Nay, further \u2014 Eliza. Nay, no farther, cousin. We have enough of your comment on the play, which will make me more ashamed than the play itself. Oliv.

Nay, lieutenant, do not excuse her ; me thinks she looks very kindly upon 'em both, and seems to be pleased with what that fool there says to her. Eliza. Pray keep it to yourself, if it be so. Oliv. No, faith, you shall know it ; I'm resolved to make you out of love with the play. 1 say, the lewdest, filthiest thing is his china ; nay, I will never forgive the beastly author his china. He has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady's chamber ; insomuch that 1 was fain to break all my defiled vessels. You see I have none left ; nor you, I hope. Eliza. You'll pardon me, I cannot think the worse of my china for that of the playhouse. Oliv. Why, you will not keep any now, sure ! 'Tis now as unfit an ornament for a lady's cham ber as the pictures that come from Italy and other hot countries ; as appears by their nudities, which I always cover, or scratch out, wheresoe'er I find 'em. But china ! out upon't, filthy china ! nasty, debauched china ! Man. You lie, sir ! and hold your peace, that I may not be provoked to give you a worse reply. Oliv.

Plaus. Faith, I dare swear the poor man did not think to disoblige the ladies, by any amorous, soft, passionate, luscious saying in his play. Oliv. Fy, my lord ! But what think you, Mr. Novel, of the play ? though I know you are a friend to all that are new. Plaus. O, be not so severe to him, as to say he hates good company : for I assure you he has a great respect, esteem and kindness for me. Man.

Well, if he be returned, Mr. Novel, then shall I be pestered again with his boisterous sea love ; have my alcove smell like a cabin, my chamber perfumed with his tarpaulin Branden burgh ; and hear volleys of brandy-sighs, enough to make a fog in one's room. Foh ! I hate a lover that smells like Thames-street ! Nov.

No, since my lord says you speak in rail lery ; for though your sea-raillery be something rough, yet, I confess, we use one another too as bad every day at Locket's, and never quarrel for the matter.

And then, that captain-like carelessness in your dress, but especially your scarf; 'twas just such another, only a little higher tied, made me in love with my tailor as he passed by my win dow the last training-day ; for we women adore a martial man, and you have nothing wanting to make you more one, or more agreeable, but a wooden leg.

And be not you vain that these laugh on your side, for they will laugh at their own dull jests ; but no more of 'em, for I will only suffer now this lady to be witty and merry. Oliv. You would not have your panegyric inter rupted. I go on then to your humour. Is there anything more agreeable than the pretty sullenness of that ? than the greatness of your courage, which most of all appears in your spirit of contra diction ? for you dare give all mankind the lie ; and your opinion is your only mistress, for you re nounce that too, when it becomes another man's.

Well, we women, like the rest of the cheats of the world, when our cullies or creditors have found us out, and will or can trust no longer, pay debts and satisfy obligations with a quarrel, the kindest present a man can make to his mis tress, when he can make no more presents. For oftentimes in love, as at cards, we are forced to play foul, only to give over the game ; and use our lovers like the cards, when we can get no more by them, throw 'em up in a pet upon the first dispute.

Was it the merit of his fashionable impudence ; the briskness of his noise, the wit of his laugh, his judgment, or fancy in his garniture ? or was it a well-trimmed glove, or the scent of it, that charmed you ? Nov. Very well, sir : 'gad these sea-captains make nothing of dressing. But let me tell you, sir, a man by his dress, as much as by anything, shows his wit and judgment ; nay, and his courage too. Plaus. And i'faith, dear captain, I beg your pardon, and leave to laugh at you too, though I protest I mean you no hurt ; but when a lady ral lies, a stander-by must be complaisant, and do her reason in laughing : ha ! ha !

Oliv. No hectoring, good captain. Alan. Or, perhaps, you think this lady's pre sence secures you ; but have a care, she has talked herself out of all the respect I had for her ; and by using me ill before you, has given me a privilege of using you so before her : but if you would pre serve your respect to her, and not be beaten before her, go, begone immediately.

Alan. Do not give me cause to think so ; for those less infamous women part with their lovers, just as you did from me, with unforced vows of constancy and floods of willing tears ; but the same winds bear away their lovers and their vows : and for their grief, if the credulous unexpected fools re turn, they find new comforters, fresh cullies, such as I found here.

But I have other business, I'd have you to know. Wid. Well then, to make an end of this foolish wooing, for nothing interrupts business more : first, for you, major \u2014 \u25a0 Old.

I mean, you would have me keep you, that you might turn keeper ; for poor widows are only used like bawds by you : you go to church with us, but to get other women to lie with.

And would you have me under covert-baron again ? No, sir, no covert-baron for me. Free. But, dear widow, hear me. I value you only, not your jointure. Wid. Nay, sir, hold there ; I know your love to a widow is covetousness of her jointure : and a widow, a little stricken in years, with a good joint ure, is like an old mansion-house in a good pur chase, never valued, but take one, take t'other : and perhaps, when you are in possession, you'd neglect it, let it drop to the ground, for want of necessary repairs or expenses upon't.

Ay, you old fobus, and you would have been my guardian, would you, to have taken care of my estate, that half oft should never come to me, by letting long leases at pepper-corn rents ? Wid. If I would have married an old man, 'tis well known I might have married an earl, nay, what's more, a judge, and been covered the winter nights with the lamb-skins, which I prefer to the ermines of nobles.

Fair and softly, sir, 'tis my minor's case, more than my own ; and I must do him justice now on you. Wid. Fy ! fy ! I neglect my business with this foolish discourse of love.

I will no more hearken to your foolish love-motions, than to offers of arbitration. [Exeunt Widow and Jerry. Free. How ! Old. So then. Wid. You are, first, (I warrant,) some renegado from the inns of court and the law ; and thou'lt come to suffer for't by the law, that is, be hanged. Jer. Not about your neck, forsooth, I hope. Free. But, madam \u2014 \u25a0 Old. Hear the court. Free. Well, I'll follow thee yet ; for he that has a pretension at court, or to a widow, must never give over for a little ill-usage. Old. Therefore, I'll get her by assiduity, patience, and long sufferings, which you will not undergo ; for you idle young fellows leave off love when it comes to be business ; and industry gets more women than love. Wid. Thou art some debauched, drunken, lewd, hectoring, gaming companion, and wantest some widow's old gold to nick upon ; but I thank you, sir, that's for my lawyers. Free.

Damn your cause, can't you lose it with out me ? which you are like enough to do, if it be, as you say, an honest one : I will suffer no longer for't. Wid. Nay, captain, I tell you, you are my prime witness ; and the cause is just now coming on, Mr. Splitcause tells me. Lord, methinks you should take a pleasure in walking here, as half you see now do ; for they have no business here, I assure you. Alan. Yes ; but I'll assure you then, their busi ness is to persecute me. But d'ye think I'll stay any longer, to have a rogue, because he knows my name, pluck me aside and whisper a news-book secret to me with a stinking breath ? a second come piping angry from the court, and sputter in my face his tedious complaints against it ? a third law coxcomb, because he saw me once at a reader's dinner, come and put me a long law case, to make a discovery of his indefatigable dulness and my wearied patience ? a fourth, a most barbarous civil rogue, who will keep a man half an hour in the crowd with a bowed body, and a hat off, acting the reformed sign of the Salutation tavern, to hear his bountiful professions of service and friendship, whilst he cares not if 1 were damned, and I am wishing him hanged out of my way ? \u2014 I'd as soon run the gauntlet, as walk t'other turn. Re-enter Jerry Blackacre, without his Bags, but laden with Trinkets, which he endeavours to hide from his Mother, and followed at a distance by Freeman. Wid. O, are you come, sir? but where have you been, you ass ? and how came you thus laden ? Jer. Look here, forsooth, mother ; now here's a duck, here's a boar- cat, and here's an owl.

But, now I think on't, 'tis you, sir, have put this cheat upon me ; for there is a saying, Take hold of a maid by her smock, and a widow by her writings, and they cannot get from you.

But first, I'll try to find out this guardianless, graceless villain. \u2014 Will you jog, major? Alan. If you have lost your evidence, I hope your causes cannot go on, and I may be gone ? Wid. O no ; stay but a making-water while (as one may say) and I'll be with you again. [Exeunt Widow and Oldfox. Free. Well ; sure I am the first man that ever began a love-intrigue in Westminster- Hall.

[Aside.] I'm glad to hear this.\u2014 [Aloud.] They'll be all safe, 1 warrant you, madam. Wid. 0 where ? where ? Come, you villain, along with me, and show me where. [Exeunt Widow, Jerry, and Oldfox. Alan. Thou hast taken the right way to get a widow, by making her great boy rebel ; for when nothing will make a widow marry, she'll do it to cross her children. But canst thou in earnest marry this harpy, this volume of shrivelled blurred parchments and law, this attorney's desk ? Free. Ay, ay; I'll marry and live honestly, that is, give my creditors, not her, due benevolence, \u2014 pay my debts. Alan. Thy creditors, you see, are not so barba rous as to put thee in prison ; and wilt thou com mit .thyself to a noisome dungeon for thy life ? which is the only satisfaction thou canst give thy creditors by this match. Free. Why, is not she rich ? Alan. Ay ; but he that marries a widow for her money, will find himself as much mistaken as the widow that marries a young fellow for due benevo lence, as you call it. Free. Why, d'ye think I shan't deserve wages ? I'll drudge faithfully. Man. I tell thee again, he that is the slave in the mine has the least propriety in the ore. You may dig, and dig ; but if thou wouldst have her money, rather get to be her trustee than her hus band ; for a true widow will make over her estate to anybody, and cheat herself rather than be cheated by her children or a second husband. Free. Well ; but how, pray, have you passed your time here, since I was forced to leave you alone ? You have had a great deal of patience. Man. Is this a place to be alone, or have patience in ? But I have had patience, indeed ; for I have drawn upon me, since I came, but three quarrels and two lawsuits. Free. Nay, faith, you are too curst to be let loose in the world : you should be tied up again in your sea-kennel, called a ship. But how could you quarrel here ? Alan. How could I refrain ? A lawyer talked peremptorily and saucily to me, and as good as gave me the lie. Free. They do it so often to one another at the bar, that they make no bones on't elsewhere. Alan. However, I gave him a cuff on the ear ; whereupon he jogs two men, whose backs were turned to us, (for they were reading at a book seller's,) to witness I struck him, sitting the courts ; which office they so readily promised, that I called 'em rascals and knights of the post. One of 'em presently calls two other absent witnesses, who were coming towards us at a distance ; whilst the other, with a whisper, desires to know my name, that he might have satisfaction by way of challenge, as t'other by way of writ ; but if it were not rather to direct his brother's writ, than his own challenge. \u2014 There, you see, is one of my quarrels, and two of my lawsuits. Free. So ! \u2014 and the other two ? Re-enter Jerry, running in a fright. Jer. O la, I'm undone ! I'm undone ! my mother will kill me : \u2014 you said you'd stand by one. Free. So I will, my brave squire, I warrant thee. Jer. Ay, but I dare not stay till she comes ; for she's as furious, now she has lost her writings, as a bitch when she has lost her puppies. Man. The comparison's handsome ! Jer. 0, she's here ! Free. [ To the Sailor.] Take him. Jack, and make haste with him to your master's lodging ; and be sure you keep him up till I come. [Exeunt. Jerry and Sailor. Alan. For advising a poet to leave off writing, and turn lawyer, because he is dull and impudent, and says or writes nothing now but by precedent. Free. And the third quarrel ? Alan. For giving more sincere advice to a hand some, well-dressed young fellow, (who asked it too,) not to marry a wench that he loved, and I had lain with. Free. Nay, if you will be giving your sincere advice to lovers and poets, you will not fail of quarrels. Alan. Or if I stay in this place ; for I see more quarrels crowding upon me. Let's be gone, and avoid 'em. Re-enter Widow Blackacre and Oldfox. Wid. O my dear writings ! Where's this heathen rogue, my minor ? Free. Gone to drown or hang himself. Wid.

O, you are a merry gentleman, sir: I re member you were merry when I was last in your company. Re-enter Oldfox. Man. To what purpose, since here comes an other as impertinent? I know by his grin he is bound hither. Alan. I was never merry in thy company, Mr. Lawyer, sure. Law. Why, I'm sure you joked upon me, and shammed me all night long. Alan. Shammed ! prithee what barbarous law term is that ? Old. Your servant, worthy, noble captain. Well, I have left the widow, because she carried me from your company : for, faith, captain, I must needs tell thee thou art the only officer in England, who was not an Edgehill officer, that I care for.

Shamming ! why, don't you know that ? 'tis all our way of wit, sir. Alan. I am glad I do not know it then. Sham ming ! what does he mean by't, Freeman ! Free. Shamming is telling you an insipid dull lie with a dull face, which the sly wag the author only laughs at himself; and making himself believe 'tis a good jest, puts the sham only upon himself. Alan. So, your lawyer's jest, I find, like his practice, .has more knavery than wit in't. I should make the worst shammer in England : I must always deal ingenuously, as I will with you, Mr. Lawyer, and advise you to be seen rather with attorneys and solicitors, than such fellows as I am : they will credit your practice more. Law. No, sir, your company's an honour to me. Man. No, I am not modest ; but love to brag myself, and can't patiently hear you fight over the last civil war.

I'm sure I thought her lips \u2014 but I must not think of 'em more \u2014 but yet they are such I could still kiss \u2014 grow to \u2014 and then tear off with my teeth, grind 'em into mammocks, and spit 'em into her cuckold's face. Fid. Poor man, how uneasy he is ! I have hardly the heart to give so much pain, though withal I give him a cure, and to myself new life. [Aside. Alan. But what, her kisses sure could not but warm you into desire at last, or a compliance with hers at least ? Fid. Nay, more, I confess \u2014 Man. What more? speak. Fid. All you could fear had passed between us, if I could have been made to wrong you, sir, in that nature. Enter Freeman. Alan. Not a word more. Free. What, are you talking of love yet, cap tain ? I thought you bad done with't. Alan. Why, what did you hear me say ? Free. Something imperfectly of love, I think. Man. I was only wondering why fools, rascals, and desertless wretches, should still have the better of men of merit with all women, as much as with their own common mistress, Fortune. Alan. Could nave oeen made ! you lie, you did. Fid. Indeed, sir, 'twas impossible for me ; besides, we were interrupted by a visit ; but I con fess, she would not let me stir, till I promised to return to her again within this hour, as soon as it should be dark ; by which time she would dispose of her visit, and her servants, and herself, for my reception. Which I was fain to promise, to get from her. Free. Because most women, like Fortune, are blind, seem to do all things in jest, and take plea sure in extravagant actions. Their love deserves neither thanks, or blame, for they cannot help it : 'tis all sympathy; therefore, the noisy, the finical, the talkative, the cowardly, and effeminate, have the better of the brave, the reasonable, and man ot Alan. Ha ! Fid. But if ever I go near her again, may you, sir, think me as false to you, as she is ; hate and renounce me, as you ought to do her, and. I hope, will do now. Man. Well, but now I think on't, you shall keep"], [222, "128 THE PLAIN DEALER. ACT IV. honour ; for they have no more reason in their love, or kindness, than Fortune herself. Alan. Yes, they have their reason. First, honour in a man they fear too much to love ; and sense in a lover upbraids their want of it ; and they hate anything that disturbs their admiration of themselves ; but they are of that vain number, who had rather show their false generosity, in giv ing away profusely to worthless flatterers, than in paying just debts. And, in short, all women, like fortune (as you say) and rewards, are lost by too much meriting. Fid. All women, sir ! sure there are some who have no other quarrel to a lover's merit, but that it begets their despair of him. Alan. Thou art young enough to be credulous ; but we \u2014 Old. O lady, lady, all interruption, and no sense between us, as if we were lawyers at the bar ! but I had forgot, Apollo and Littleton never lodge in a head together. If you hate verses, I'll give you a cast of my politics in prose. 'Tis a Letter to a Friend in the Country ; which is now the way of all such sober solid persons as myself, when they have a mind to publish their disgust to the times \u25a0 though perhaps, between you and I, they have no friend in the country. And sure a politic, serious person may as well have a feigned friend in the country to write to, as an idle poet a feigned mis tress to write to. And so here's my letter to a friend, or no friend, in the country, concerning the late conjuncture of affairs, in relation to coffee houses ; or, The Coffee-man's Case. Wid. Nay, if your letter have a case in't, 'tis something ; but first I'll read you a letter of mine to a friend in the country, called a letter of attorney. Enter Sailor. Sail.

Re-enter Freeman, with Jerry Blackacre in an old gaudy suit and red breeches o/Freeman's. Old. What, interruption still I O the plague of interruption ! worse to an author than the plague of critics. [Aside. Wid. What's this I see ? Jerry Blackacre, my minor, in red breeches ! What, hast thou left the modest seemly garb of gown and cap for this ? and have I lost all my good inns-of-chancery breeding upon thee then ? and thou wilt go a breed ing thyself from our inn of chancery and Westmin ster-hall, at coffee-houses, and ordinaries, play houses, tennis-courts, and bawdy-houses ? Jer. Ay, ay, what then ? perhaps I will ; but what's that to you ? Here's my guardian and tutor now, forsooth, that 1 am out of your huck ster's hands. Man. No; for I'll begone. Come, volunteer. Free. Nay, pray stay ; the scene between us will not be so tedious to you as you think. Besides, you shall see how I rigged my 'squire out, with the remains of my shipwrecked wardrobe ; be is under your sea valet-de-chambre's hands, and by this time dressed, and will be worth your seeing. Stay, and I'll fetch my fool. Alan. No ; you know I cannot easily laugh .: besides, my volunteer and I have business abroad. [Exeunt Manly and Fidelia on one side ; Free- man on the other. Enter Major Oldfox and Widow Blackacre. Wid. How ! thou hast not chosen him for thy guardian yet ? Jer. No, but he has chosen me for his charge, and that's all one ; and I'll do anything he'll have me, and go all the world over with him ; to ordina ries, and bawdy-houses, or anywhere else. Wid. To ordinaries and bawdy-houses ! have a care, minor, thou wilt enfeeble there thy estate and body : do not go to ordinaries and bawdy-houses, good Jerry. Jer. Why, how come you to know any ill by bawdy-houses ? you never had any hurt by 'em, had you, forsooth ? Pray hold yourself contented; if I do go where money and wenches are to be had, you may thank yourself ; for you used me so unna turally, you would never let me have a penny to go abroad with ; nor so much as come near the garret where your maidens lay ; nay, you would not so much as let me play at hotcockles with 'em, nor have any recreation with 'em, though one should have kissed you behind, you were so unnatural a mother, so you were. Free. Ay, a very unnatural mother, faith, squire. Wid. What, nobody here ! did not the fellow say he was within ? Old. Yes, lady ; and he may be perhaps a little busy at present ; but if you think the time long till he comes, [unfolding papers] I'll read you here some of the fruits of my leisure, the over flowings of my fancy and pen. \u2014 [Aside. ] To value me right, she must know my parts. \u2014 [Aloud.] Come \u2014 Wid. No, no ; I have reading work enough of my own in my bag, I thank you. Old. Ay, law, madam ; but here's a poem, in blank verse, which I think a handsome declaration of one's passion. Wid. O, if you talk of declarations, I'll show you one of the prettiest penned thing*, which I mended too myself, you must know. Old. Nay, lady, if you have used yourself so much to the reading harsh law, that you hate smooth poetry, here is a character for you, of \u2014 Wid. A character ! nay, then I'll show you my bill in chancery here, that gives you such a character of my adversary, makes him as black \u2014 Old. Pshaw ! away, away, lady ! But if you think the character too long, here is an epigram, not above twenty lines, upon a cruel lady, who decreed her servant should hang himself, to demon strate his passion. Wid. Decreed ! if you talk of decreeing, I have such a decree here, drawn by the finest clerk \u2014 Wid But, Jerry, consider thou art yet but a minor ; however, if thou wilt go home with me again, and be a good child, thou shalt see \u2014 Free.

Young gentleman squire, pray be ruled by your mother and your friends. Jer. Yes, I '11 be ruled by my friends, therefore not by my mother, so I won't : I '11 choose him for my guardian till I am of age ; nay, maybe, for as long as I live. Wid. Wilt thou so, thou wretch? and when thou'rt of age, thou wilt sign, seal and deliver too, wilt thou ? have no husband, nor intend to have any ? Nor would you, I suppose, now have me for a wife. So I think now I'm revenged on my son and you, without marrying, as I told yiu. Free. But consider, madam. Jer. What, have you no shame left in you, mother ? Wid. Wonder not at it, major. 'Tis often the poor pressed widow's case, to give up her honour to save her jointure ; and seem to be a light woman, rather than marry : as some young men, they say, pretend to have the filthy disease, and lose their credit with most women, to avoid the importunities of some. [Aside to Oldfox. Jer. Yes, marry will I, if you go there too. Wid. 0 do not squeeze wax, son ; rather go to ordinaries and bawdy-houses, than squeeze wax. If thou dost that, farewell the goodly manor of Blackacre, with all its woods, underwoods, and appurtenances whatever ! Ob, oh ! [ Weeps. Free. Come, madam, in short, you see I am re solved to have a share in the estate, yours or your son's: if I cannot get you, I'll keep him, who is less coy, you find ; but if you would have your son again, you must take me too. Peace or war ? love, or law ? You see my hostage is in my hand : I 'm in possession. Wid. Nay, if one of us must be ruined, e'en let it be him. By my body, a good one ! Did you ever know yet a widow marry or not marry for the sake of her child ? I'd have you to know, sir, I shall be hard enough for you both yet, without marrying you, if Jerry wont be ruled by me. What say you, booby, will you be ruled ? speak. Jer. Let one alone, can't you ? Wid. Wilt thou choose him for guardian, whom I refuse for husband >. Free. But one word with you, madam. Wid. No, no, sir. Come, major, let us make haste now to the Prerogative Court. Old. But, lady, if what you say be true, will you stigmatise your reputation on record ? and if it be not true, how will you prove it ? Wid. Pshaw ! I can prove anything : and for my reputation, know, major, a wise woman will no more value her reputation, in disinheriting a rebellious son of a good estate, than she would in getting him, to inherit an estate. [Exeunt Widow and Oldfox. Free. Madam \u2014 We must not let her go so, squire. Jer. Nay, the devil can't stop her though, if she has a mind to't. But come, bully-guardian, we'll go and advise with three attorneys, two proctors, two solicitors, and a shrewd man of Whitefriars, neither attorney, proctor, or solicitor, but as pure a pimp to the law as any of 'em : and sure all they will be hard enough for her, for I fear, bully guardian, you are too good a joker to have any law in your head. Free. Thou 'rt in the right on't, squire, I under stand no law ; especially that against bastards, since I'm sure the custom is against that law, and more people get estates by being so, than lose 'em. Jer. Ay, to choose, I thank you. Wid. And are all my hopes frustrated ? Shall I never hear thee put cases again to John the butler, or our vicar? never see thee amble the circuit with the judges ; and hear thet, in our town-hall, louder than the crier ? [Exeunt. Jer. No ; for I have taken my leave of Iawyering and pettifogging. Wid. Pettifogging ! thou profane villain, hast thou so ? Pettifogging ! \u2014 then you shall take your leave of me, and your estate too ; thou shalt be an alien to me and it for ever. Pettifogging ! Jer. 0, but if you go there too, mother, we have the deeds and settlements, I thank you. Would you cheat me of my estate, i'fae ? Wid. No, no, I will not cheat your little brother Bob ; for thou wert not born in wedlock. SCENE II.\u2014 Olivia's Lodging. Enter Lord Plausible, and Boy with a Candle. Plaus. Little gentleman, your most obedient, faithful, humble servant. Where, I beseech you, is that divine person, your noble lady ? Boy. Gone out, my lord ; but commanded me to give you this letter.

Nay, I humbly beseech you, be not in choler ; where there is most love, there may be most freedom. Jer. Why ? why, forsooth ? What d 'ye mean, if you go there too ? Wid. Thou art but my base child ; and accord ing to the law, canst not inherit it. Nay, thou art not so much as bastard eigne. Jer. What, what, am I then the son of a whore, mother ? Wid. The law says \u2014 Free. Madam, we know what the law says ; but have a care what you say. Do not let your passion, to ruin your son, rain your reputation. Wid.

And you noble wits are so full of sham ming and drolling, one knows not where to have you seriously. Nov. Well, you shall find me in bed with this lady one of these days. Plaus. Nay, I beseech you, spare the lady's honour ; for hers and mine will be all one shortly. Nov. Prithee, my lord, be not an ass. Dost thou think to get her from me ?

Where, if it be so, for our comfort, we cannot fail of meeting with fellow-sufferers enough ; for, as Freeman said of another, she stands in the drawing-room, like the glass, ready for all comers, to set their gallantry by her : and, like the glas:i too, lets no man go from her unsatisfied with him self. [Exeunt. Plaus. Why, seriously then, she has told me viscountess sounded prettily. Nov. And me, that Novel was a name she would sooner change hers for than for any title in Eng land. Plaus.

Sleepiness ! dulness, dulness. But the fierceness of mine she adored. Enter Olivia and Boy. Oliv. Both here, and just gone ? Boy. Yes, madam. Oliv. But are you sure neither saw you deliver the other a letter ? Plaus. The brightness of my hair she liked. Nov. The brightness ! no, the greasiness, 1 warrant. But the blackness and lustre of mine she admires. Boy. Yes, yes, madam, I am very sure. Oliv. Go then to the Old Exchange, to West minster, Holborn, and all the other places I told you of ; I shall not need you these two hours : begone, and take the candle with you, and be sure you leave word again below, I am gone out, to all that ask. Plaus. The gentleness of my smile. Nov. The subtilty of my leer. Plaus. The clearness of my complexion. Nov. The redness of my lips. Plaus. The whiteness of my teeth. Nov. My janty way of picking them. Plaus. The sweetness of my breath. Nov. Ha ! ha I nay, then she abused you, 'tis plain ; for you know what Manly said : \u2014 the sweet ness of your pulvillio she might mean ; but for your breath ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Your breath is such, man, that nothing but tobacco can perfume ; and your complexion nothing could mend but the small-pox. Plaus. Well, sir, you may please to be merry ; but, to put you out of all doubt, sir, she has received some jewels from me of value. Nov. And presents from me ; besides what I presented her jantily, by way of ombre, of three or four hundred pounds value, which I'm sure are the earnest-pence for our love-bargain. Plaus. Nay, then, sir, with your favour, and to make an end of all your hopes, look you there, sir, she has writ to me \u2014 Boy. Yes, madam. [Exit. Oliv. And my new lover will not ask, I'm sure ; he has his lesson, and cannot miss me here, though in the dark : which I have purposely designed, as a remedy against my blushing gallant's modesty ; for young lovers, like game-cocks, are made bolder by being kept without light.

In a duel of love, as in others, parleying shows basely. Come, we are alone ; and now the word is only satisfac tion, and defend not thyself. Alan. How 's this ? Why, she makes love like a devil in a play ; and in this darkness, which con ceals her angel's face, if I were apt to be afraid, I should think her a devil. [Aside. Ver. Nay, then \u2014 Oliv. But, my life, you shall never stay half so long from me again; you shan't indeed, by this kiss you shan't. Ver. No, no ; but why alone in the dark ? Oliv. Blame not my melancholy in your absence. \u2014 But, my soul, since you went, I have strange news to tell you : Manly is returned. Ver. Manly returned ! Fortune forbid ! Oliv. Met with the Dutch in the channel, fought, sunk his ship, and all he carried with him. He was here with me yesterday. Ver. And did you own our marriage to him ? Oliv. I told him I was married to put an end to his love and my trouble ; but to whom, is yet a secret kept from him and all the world. And I have used him so scurvily, his great spirit will ne'er return to reason it farther with me : I have sent him to sea again, I warrant. Oliv. What, you traverse ground, young gentle man ! [Fidelia avoiding her. Fid. I take breath only. Alan. Good heavens ! how was I deceived ! [Aside. Oliv. Nay, you are a coward ; what, are you afraid of the fierceness of my love % Fid. Yes, madam, lest its violence might presage its change ; and I must needs be afraid you would leave me quickly, who could desert so brave a gen tleman as Manly. Oliv. O, name not his name ! for in a time of stolen joys, as this is, the filthy name of husband were not a more allaying sound. Alan. There 's some comfort yet. [Aside. Fid. But did you not love him ? Oliv. Never. How could you think it ? Fid. Because he thought it ; who is a man of that sense, nice discerning, and diffidency, that I should think it hard to deceive him. Ver. 'Twas bravely done. And sure he will now hate the shore more than ever, after so great a disappointment. Be you sure only to keep a while our great secret, till he be gone. In the mean time, I '11 lead the easy, honest fool by the nose, as I used to do ; and whilst he stays, rail with him at thee ; and when he 's gone, laugh with thee at him. But have you his cabinet of jewels safe ? part not with a seed-pearl to him, to keep him from starving. Oliv. Nor from hanging. Ver. He cannot recover 'em; and, I think, will scorn to beg 'em again. Oliv. But, my life, have you taken the thousand guineas he left in my name out of the goldsmith's hands ? Oliv. No ; he that distrusts most the world, trusts most to himself, and is but the more easily deceived, because he thinks he can't be deceived. His cunning is like the coward's sword, by which he is oftener worsted than defended. Fid. Yet, sure, you used no common art to deceive him. Ver. Ay, ay ; they are removed to another goldsmith's. Oliv. Ay, but, my soul, you had best have a care he find not where the money is ; for his present wants, as I'm informed, are such as will make him inquisitive enough. Ver. You say true, and he knows the man too ; but I'll remove it to-morrow. Oliv. I knew he loved his own singular morose ness so well, as to dote upon any copy of it ; wherefore I feigned a hatred to the world too, that he might love me in earnest : but, if it had been hard to deceive him, I'm sure 'twere much harder to love him. A dogged, ill-mannered \u2014 Fid. D'ye hear, sir ? pray, hear her. [Aside to Manly. Oliv. Surly, untractable, snarling brute ! He ! a mastiff dog were as fit a thing to make a gallant of. Oliv. To-morrow ! 0 do not stay till to morrow ; go to-night, immediately. Ver. Now I think on't, you advise well, and I will go presently. Oliv. Presently ! instantly ! I will not let you stay a jot. Ver. I will then, though I return not home till twelve. Man. Ay, a goat, or monkey, were fitter for thee. [Aside. Fid. I must confess, for my part, though my rival, I cannot but say he has a manly handsome ness in's face and mien. Oliv. So has a Saracen in the sign. Fid. Is proper, and well made. Oliv. As a drayman. Fid. Has wit. Oliv. Nay, though not till morning, with alLmy heart. Go, dearest ; I am impatient till you are gone. \u2014 [Thrusts him out.] So, I have at once now brought about those two grateful businesses, which all prudent women do together, secured money and pleasure ; and now all interruptions of the last are removed. Go, husband, and come up, friend ; just the buckets in the well ; the absence of one brings the other. But I hope, like them too, they will not meet in the way, jostle, and clash together. Oliv. He rails at all mankind. Fid. And undoubted courage. Oliv. Like the hangman's ; can murder a man when his hands are tied. He has cruelty indeed ; which is no more courage, than his railing is wit. Man. Thus women, and men like women, are too hard for us, when they think we do not hear 'em : and reputation, like other mistresses, is never true to a man in his absence. [Aside.

Come, my soul, this way. [Pulls Fidelia. My cruel life; for when a lover's hopes Are dead and gone, life is unmerciful. [Sits down and weeps R.:~enter Manly. Fid. But, madam, what could make you dissem ble love to him, when 'twas so hard a thing for you ; and flatter his love to you ? Alan. I have thought better on't : I must not discover myself now I am without witnesses ; for if I barely should publish it, she would deny it with as much impudence, as she would act it again with this young fellow here. \u2014 Where are you ? Fid. Here \u2014 oh \u2014 now I suppose we maybe gone. Alan. I will ; but not you. You must stay and act the second part of a lover, that is, talk kind ness to her. Oliv. That which makes all the world flatter and dissemble, 'twas his money : I had a real pas sion for that. Yet I loved not that so well, as for it to take him ; for as soon as I had his money I hastened his departure like a wife, who when she has made the most of a dying husband's breath, pulls away his pillow. Mar.. Damned money ! its master's potent rival still ; and like a saucy pimp, corrupts itself the mistress it procures for us. [Aside. Oliv. But I did not think with you, my life, to pass my time in talking. Come hither, come ; yet stay, till I have locked a door in the other room, that may chance to let us in some interrup tion ; which reciting poets or losing gamesters fear not more than I at this time do. [Exit. Fid. Not I, sir. Alan. No disputing, sir, you must ; tis neces sary to my design of coming again to-morrow night. Fid. What, can you come again then hither ? Alan. Yes ; and you must make the appoint ment, and an apology for your leaving her so soon; for I have said not a word to her ; but have kept your counsel, as I expect you should do mine. Do this faithfully, and I promise you here, you shall run my fortune still, and we will never part as long as we live ; but if you do not do it, expect not to live. Fid. Well, 1 hope you are now satisfied, sir, and will be gone to think of your revenge ? Alan. No, I am not satisfied, and must stay to be revenged. Fid. How, sir ? You'll use no violence to her, I hope, and forfeit your own life, to take away hers ? that were no revenge. Alan. No, no, you need not fear : my revenge shall only be upon her honour, not her life. Fid. How, sir ? her honour ? O heavens ! con sider, sir, she has no honour. D'ye call that re venge ? can you think of such a thing ? But reflect, sir, how she hates and loathes you. Man. Yes, so much she hates me, that it would be a revenge sufficient to make her accessary to my pleasure, and then let her know it. Fid. No, sir, no ; to be revenged on her now, were to disappoint her. Pray, sir, let us begone. [Pulls Manly. Fid. 'Tis hard, sir ; but such a consideration will make it easier. You won't forget your pro mise, sir ? Alan. No, by heavens. But I hear her coming. [Exit. Re-enter Olivia. Oliv. Where is my life ? Run from me already ! You do not love me, dearest ; nay, you are angry with me, for you would not so much as speak a kind word to me within : what was the reason ? Fid. I was transported too much. Oliv.

No, we shall hear the better here, if any body should come up. Man. Hold off ! What, you are my rival then ! and therefore you shall stay, and keep the door for me, whilst I go in for you ; but when I'm gone, if you dare to stir off from this very board, or breathe the least murmuring accent, I'll cut her throat first ; and if you love her, you will not venture her life.- \u2014 Nay, then I'll cut your throat too ; and I know you love your own life at least. Fid. But, sir ; good sir. Alan. Not a word more, lest I begin my re venge on her by killing you. Fid. But are you sure 'tis revenge that makes you do this ? how can it be ? Oliv. Nay, I assure you, we shall be secure enough within : come, come \u2014 \u25a0 Fid. I am sick, and troubled with a sudden dizziness ; and cannot stir yet. Oliv. Come, I have spirits within. Fid. O ! don't you hear a noise, madam ? O/iu. No, no ; there is none : come, come. [Pulls her. Fid. Indeed there is ; and I love you so much, I must have a care of your honour, if you won't, and go ; but to come to you to-morrow night, if you please. Oliv. With all my soul. But you must not go yet ; come, prithee. Fid. Oh !\u2014 I'm now sicker, and am afraid of one of my fits. Man. Whist ! Fid. 'Tis a strange revenge, indeed. Alan. If you make me stay, I shall keep my word, and begin with you. No more. [Exit at the same door Olivia went out by. Fid.

Oliv. What fits ? Fid. Of the falling sickness ; and I lie gene rally an hour in a trance : therefore pray consider your honour for the sake of my love, and let me go, that I may return to you often. Oliv. But will you be sure then to come to morrow night? Fid. Yes. But did there never any love like me, That untried tortures you must find me out ?

Nay, prithee no more ; go, and I'll thoroughly satisfy you when I come home ; and then, too, we will have a fit of laughter at Manly, whom I am going to find at the Cock in Bow street, where I hear he dined. Go, dearest, go home. Oliv. What does he mean ? he dissembles only to get me into his power : or has my dear friend made him believe he was a woman ? My husband may be deceived by him, but I'm sure I was not. [Aside. Ver. Come, come, you need not have lain out of your house for this ; but perhaps you were afraid, when I was warm with suspicions, you must have discovered who she was. \u2014 And, prithee, may I not know it? Eliza. A very pretty turn, indeed, this ! [Aside. Ver. Now, cousin, since by my wife I have that honour and privilege of calling you so, I have something to beg of you too ; which is not to take notice of our marriage to any whatever yet a while, for some reasons very important to me.

Why, tins last deceit of your husband was lawful, since in your own defence. Oliv. What deceit ? I'd have you to know I never deceived my husband. Eliza. You do not understand me, sure ; I say, this was an honest come-off, and a good one. But 'twas a sign your gallant had had enough of your conversation, since he could so dexterously cheat your husband in passing for a woman. Oliv. What d'ye mean, once more, with my gal lant, and passing for a woman ? Eliza. What do you mean ? you see your hus band took him for a woman. Oliv. She was I \u2014 [Aside] I hope he has been deceived : and since my lover has played the card, I must not renounce. Ver. Come, what's the matter with thee ?

No, I might have known her better but that I was interrupted by the goldsmith, you know, and was forced to lock her into your chamber, to keep her from his sight ; but, whenT returned, I found she was got away by tying the window-cur tains to the balcony, by which she slid down into the street. For, you must know, I jested with her, and made her believe I'd ravish her; which she apprehended, it seems, in earnest. Oliv. Then she got from you ? Ver. Yes. Oliv. And is quite gone ? Ver. Yes.

Go, do this dextrously, and expect the performance of my last night's promise, never to part with you. Fid. Ay, sir ; but will you be sure to remember that ? Eliza. Not so well, I'm sure, as you do ; there fore I'd rather take your word. Oliv. What, you grow scurrilous, and are, I find, more censorious than the world ! I must have a care of you, I see. Eliza. No, you need not fear yet, I'll keep your secret. Oliv. My secret ! I'd have you to know, I have no need of confidants, though you value yourself upon being a good one. Eliza. O admirable confidence ! you show more in denying your wickedness, than other people in glorying in't. Oliv. Confidence, to me ! to me such language ! nay, then I'll never see your face again [Aside.] I'll quarrel with her, that people may never believe I was in her power ; but take for malice all the truth she may speak against me. \u2014 [Aloud.] Lettice, where are you ?

Free. I went into their room, but to keep them, and my own fool the squire, out of your room ; but you shall be peevish now, because you have no money. But why the devil won't you write to those we were speaking of ? Since your modesty, or your spirit, will not suffer you to speak to 'em, to lend you money, why won't you try 'em at last that way ? Man. Because I know 'em already, and can bear want better than denials, nay, than obligations. Free. Deny you ! they cannot. All of 'em have been your intimate friends. Man. No, they have been people only I have obliged particularly. Free. Very well ; therefore you ought to go to 'em the rather, sure. Man. No, no. Those you have obliged most, most certainly avoid you, when you can oblige 'em no longer ; and they take your visits like so many duns. Friends, like mistresses, are avoided for obligations past. Free. Pshaw ! but most of 'em are your rela tions ; men of great fortune and honour. Man. Yes ; but relations have so much honour as to think poverty taints the blood, and disown their wanting kindred ; believing, I suppose, that as riches at first make a gentleman, the want of 'em degrades him. But damn 'em ! now I am Eliza.

Damn thee ! how couldst thou think of such a thing ? I would as soon rob my footman of his wages. Besides, 'twere in vain too : for a wench is like a box in an ordinary, receives all people's money easily, but there is no getting, nay, shaking any out again ; and he that fills it is sure never to keep the key.

Why, noble lieutenant, you who know all the town, and call all you know friends, methinks should not wonder at it ; since you find ingratitude too. For how many lords' families (though de scended from blacksmiths or tinkers) hast thou called great and illustrious ? how many ill tables called good eating ? how many noisy coxcombs wits ? how many pert coaching cowards stout ? how many tawdry affected rogues well-dressed ? how many perukes admired ? and how many ill verses applauded ? and yet canst not borrow a shilling.

Nay, she deserves you should report it at least, though you have not. Alan. Report it I by Heaven, 'tis true ! Ver. How ! sure not. Alan. I do not use to lie, nor you to doubt me. Ver. When ? Man.

Nay, her cuckold, who first cuckolded me in my money, shall not laugh all himself : we will do him reason, shan't we ? Free. Nay, now you think you have paid me; but hark you, captain, I have heard of a thing called grinning honour, but never of starving hon our. Man. Well, but it has been the fate of some brave men : and if they won't give me a ship again, I can go starve anywhere with a musket on my shoulder. Ver. Ay, ay. Man. But thou dost not, for so great a friend, take pleasure enough in your friend's revenge, me thinks. Free. Give you a ship! why, you will not solicit it. Ver. Yes, yes ; I'm glad to know it, since you have lain with her. Alan. If I have not solicited it by my services, I know no other way. Free.

Thou canst not tell who that rascal, her cuckold, is ? Ver. No. Man. She would keep it from you, I suppose. Ver. Yes, yes. Alan.

I tell you there's wit and humour too in both ; and a wit is as well known by his frolic as by his smile. Old. Pure rogue ! there's your modern wit for you ! Wit and humour in breaking of windows ! there's mischief, if you will, but no wit or hu mour. Nov. Prithee, prithee, peace, old fool ! I tell yon, where there's mischief, there's wit. Don't we esteem the monkey a wit amongst beasts, only because he's mischievous ? and, let me tell you, as good-nature is a sign of a fool, being mischievous is a sign of a wit. Old. O rogue, rogue ! pretend to be a wit, by doing mischief and railing ! Nov. Why, thou, old fool, hast no other pre tence to the name of a wit, but by railing at new plays ! Old. Thou, by railing at that facetious noble way of wit, quibbling ? Nov. Thou easiest thy dulness gravity ; and thy dozing, thinking. Old. You, sir, your dulness, spleen ; and you talk much and say nothing. Nov. Thou readest much, and understandest nothing, sir. Free. I am of my lord's mind. Alan. Yes, a fool, like a coward, is the more to be feared behind a man's back more than a witty man ; for, as a coward is more bloody than a brave man, a fool is more malicious than a man of wit. Nov. A fool, tar, \u2014 a fool ! nay, thou art a brave sea-judge of wit ! a fool ! Prithee when did you ever find me want something to say, as you do often ? Man. Nay, I confess thou art always talking, roaring, or making a noise ; that I'll say for thee. Nov. Well, and is talking a sign of a fool ? Alan. Yes, always talking, especially too if it be loud and fast, is the sign of a fool. Nov. Pshaw ! talking is hke fencing, the quicker the better; run 'em down, run 'em down.no matter for parrying ; push on still, sa, sa, sa! No matter whether you argue in form, push in guard or no. Alan. Or hit or no ; I think thou always talkest without thinking, Novel. Old. You laugh loud, and break no jest. Nov. You rail, and nobody hangs himself ; and thou hast nothing of the satire but in thy face. Old. And you have no jest, but your face, sir. Nov. Thou art an illiterate pedant. Old. Thou art a fool with a bad memory. Man. Come, a pox on you both ! you have done like wits now : for you wits, when you quarrel, never give over till ye prove one another fools. Nov. And you fools have never any occasion of laughing at us wits but when we quarrel. There fore let us be friends, Oldfox. Nov. Ay, ay ; studied play's the worse, to follow the allegory, as the old pedant says. Old. A young fop ! Alan. I ever thought the man of most wit had been like him of most money, who has no vanity in showing it everywhere, whilst the beggarly pusher of his fortune has all he has about him still only to show. Nov. Well, sir, and make a very pretty show in the world, let me tell you ; nay, a better than your close hunks. A pox, give me ready money in play ! what care I for a man's reputation ? what are we the better for your substantial thrifty curmudgeon in wit, sir ? Old. Thou art a profuse young rogue indeed. Nov. So much for talking, which, I think, 1 have proved a mark of wit ; and so is railing, roar ing, and making a noise ; for railing is satire, you know ; and roaring and making a noise, humour. Alan. They are such wits as thou art, who make the name of a wit as scandalous as that of bully ; and signify a loud- laughing, talking, incorrigible coxcomb, as bully a roaring hardened coward. Free.

Gentlemen, with your leave, here is one I would speak with ; and I have nothing to say to you. [Puts all out of the room except Vernish. Ver. I told you 'twas in vain to think of getting money out of her. She says, if a shilling would do't, she would not save you from starving or hanging, or what you would think worse, begging or flattering ; and rails so at you, one would not think you had lain with her. Alan. O, friend, never trust for that matter a woman's railing ; for she is no less a dissembler in her hatred than her love ; and as her fondness of her husband is a sign he's a cuckold, her railing at another man is a sign she lies with him. Re-enter Fidelia ; she takes Manly aside, and shows him a paper. Fid. The hour is betwixt seven and eight exactly : 'tis now half an hour after six. Alan. Well, go then to the Piazza, and wait for me : as soon as it is quite dark, I'll be with you. I must stay here yet a while for my friend. \u2014 [Exit Fidelia.] But is railing satire, Novel ? Free. And roaring and making a noise, humour ? Nov. What, won't you confess there's humour in roaring and making a noise? Free. No."], [232, "THE PLAIN DEALER. 138 ACT V. Ver. He's in the right on't : I know not what to trust to. [Aside. Alan. But you did not take any notice of it to her, I hope ? Ver. So ! \u2014 Sure he is afraid I should have dis proved him by an inquiry of her : all may be well vet. [Aside. Man. What hast thou in thy head that makes thee seem so unquiet ? to borrow for thyself, thou canst do anything for me, I know. Go ; for I must be gone to Olivia. Go, and meet me here anon. \u2014 Freeman, where are you ? [Exit. Ver. Ay, I'll meet with you, I warrant ; but it shall be at Olivia's. Sure, it cannot be : she denies it so calmly, and with that honest modest assurance, it cannot be true \u2014 and he does not use to lie \u2014 but belying a woman when she won't be kind, is the only lie a brave man will least scruple. But then the woman in man's clothes, whom he calls a man \u2014 well, but by her breasts I know her to beawoman \u2014 but then again, his appointment from her, to meet with him to-night ! I am distracted more with doubt than jealousy. Well, I have no way to disabuse or revenge myself, but by going home im mediately, putting on a riding-suit, and pretending to my wife the same business which carried me out of town last, requires me again to go post to Oxford to-night. Then, if the appointment he boasts of be true, it's sure to hold, and 1 shall have an oppor tunity either of clearing her, or revenging myself on both. Perhaps she is his wench, of an old date, and I am his cully, whilst I think him mine ; and he has seemed to make his wench rich, only that I might take her off his hands. Or if he has but lately lain with her, he must needs discover by her my treachery to him ; which I'm sure he will re venge with my death, and which I must prevent with his, if it were only but for fear of his too just reproaches ; for I must confess, I never had till now any excuse but that of interest, for doing ill to him. [Exit. Ver. Only this base impudent woman's false ness ; I cannot put her out of my head. Man. O, my dear friend, he not you too sensi ble of my wrongs ; for then I shall feel 'em too with more pain, and think 'em unsufferable. Damn her, her money, and that ill-natured whore too, Fortune herself ! But if thou wouldst ease a little my present trouble, prithee go borrow me somewhere else some money. I can trouble thee. Ver. You trouble me, indeed, most sensibly, when you command me anything I cannot do. I have lately lost a great deal of money at play, more than I can yet pay; so that not only my money, but my credit too is gone, and know not where to borrow ; but could rob a church for you. \u2014 [Aside.] Yet would rather end your wants by cutting your throat. Alan. Nay, then I doubly feel my poverty, since I'm incapable of supplying thee. [Embraces him. Ver. But, methinks, she that granted you the last favour, (as they call it,) should not deny you anything \u2014 Nov. [Looking in.] Hey, tarpaulin, have you done ? [Retires again. Ver. I understand not that point of kindness, I confess. Re-enter Manly and Freeman. Alan. Come hither ; only, I say, be sure you mistake not the time. You know the house exactly where Olivia lodges, 'tis just hard by. Free. Yes, yes. Alan. Well then, bring 'em all, I say, thither, and all you know that may be then in the house ; for the more witnesses I have of her infamy, the greater will be my revenge : and be sure you come straight up to her chamber without more ado. Here, take the watch ; you see 'tis above a quarter past seven ; be there in half an hour exactly. Free. You need not doubt my diligence or dex terity ; I am an old scourer, and can naturally beat up a wench's quarters that won't be civil. Shan't we break her windows too ? Alan. No, thou dost not understand it, and I have not time to let you know all now ; for these fools, you see, will interupt us : but anon, at supper, we'll laugh at leisure together at Olivia's cuckold, who took a young fellow, that goes between his wife and me, for a woman. Ver. Ha! Alan. Senseless easy rascal! 'twas no wonder she chose him for a husband ; but she thought him, I thank her, fitter than me, for that blind bearing office. Ver. I could not be deceived in that long woman's hair tied up behind, nor those infallible proofs, her pouting swelling breasts : I have handled too many sure not to know 'em. [Aside. Alan. What, you wonder the fellow could be such a blind coxcomb ? Man. No, no ; be punctual only. [Exeunt. Ver, Yes, yes \u2014 Nov. [Looking in again.] Nay, prithee, come to us, Manly. Gad, all the fine things one says in their company, are lost without thee. Alan. Away, fop ! I'mbusy yet. [Novel retires.] You see we cannot talk here at our ease ; besides, I must be gone immediately, in order to meeting with Olivia again to-night. Ver. To-night ! it cannot be, sure \u2014 Man. I had an appointment just now from her. Ver. For what time ? SCENE III. \u2014 A Room in the same. Enter Widow Blackacre, and two Knights of the Post, a Waiter following with wine. Wid. Sweetheart, are you sure the door was shut close, that none of those roysters saw us come ? Wait. Yes, mistress ; and you shall have apri vater room above, instantly. [Exit. Wid. You are safe enough, gentlemen ; for I have been private in this house ere now, upon other occasions, when I was something younger. Come, gentlemen, in short, I leave my business to your care and fidelity : and so, here's to you. 1 Knight. We are ungrateful rogues if we should not be honest to you ; for we have had a great deal of your money. Alan. At half an hour after seven precisely. Ver. Don't you apprehend the husband ? Man. He ! sniveling gull ! he a thing to be seared ! a husband ! the tamest of creatures ! Ver. Very fine ! [Aside. Man. But, prithee, in the mean time, go try to get me some money. Though thou art too modest"], [233, "THE PLAIN DEALER. SCENE III. 139 Wid. And you have done me many a good job for't ; and so, here's to you again. 2 Knight. Why, we have been perjured but six times for you. 1 Knight. Forged but four deeds, with your hus band's last deed of gift. 2 Knight. And but three wills. 1 Knight. And counterfeited hands and seals to some six bonds ; I think that's all, brother ? Wid. Ay, that's all, gentlemen ; and so, here's to you again. 2 Knight. Nay, 'twould do one's heart good to be forsworn for you. You have a conscience in your ways, and pay us well. 1 Knight. You are in the right on't, brother ; one would be damned for her with all one's heart. Jer. O la ! my mother bound hand and foot, and gaping as if she rose before her time to-day ! Free. What means this, Oldfox ? But I'll re lease you from him ; you shall be no man's pri soner but mine. Bailliffs, execute your writ. [Unties her. Old. Nay, then, I'll be gone, for fear of being bail, and paying her debts without being her hus band. [Exit. 1 Bail. We arrest you in the king's name, at the suit of Mr. Freeman, guardian to Jeremiah Black acre, Esquire, in an action of ten thousand pounds. Wid. How, how, in a choke-bail action ! What, and the pen-and-ink gentlemen taken too ! \u2014 Have you confessed, you rogues ? 1 Knight. We needed not to confess ; for the bailiffs have dogged us hither to the very door, and overheard all that you and we said. Wid. Undone,- undone then ! no man was ever too hard for me till now. O Jerry, child, wilt thou vex again the womb that bore thee ? Jer. Ay, for bearing me before wedlock, as you say. But I'll teach you to call a Blackacre bastard, though you were never so much my mother. Wid. [Aside.] Well, I'm undone ! not one trick left ? no law-mesh imaginable ? \u2014 [To Free man.] Cruel sir, a word with you, I pray. Free. In vain, madam ; for you have no other way to release yourself, but by the bonds of matri mony. 2 Knight. But there are rogues, who make us forsworn for 'em ; and when we come to be paid, they'll be forsworn too, and not pay us our wages, which they promised with oaths sufficient. 1 Knight. Ay, a great lawyer that shall be name less bilked me too. Wid. That was hard, methinks, that a lawyer should use gentlemen witnesses no better. 2 Knight. A lawyer ! d'ye wonder a. lawyer should do't ? I was bilked by a reverend divine, that preaches twice on Sundays, and prays half an hour still before dinner. Wid. How ! a conscientious divine and not pay people for damning themselves ! sure then, for all his talking, he does not believe damnation. But, come, to our business. Pray be sure to imitate exactly the flourish at the end of this name. [Pulls out a deed or two. 1 Knight. 0, he's the best in England at un tangling a flourish, madam. Wid. And let not the seal be a jot bigger. Ob serve well the dash too, at the end of this name. 2 Knight. I warrant you, madam. Wid. Well, these and many other shifts, poor widows are put to sometimes ; for everybody would be riding a widow, as they say, and breaking into her jointure. They think marrying a widow an easy business, like leaping the hedge where another has gone over before. A widow is a mere gap, a gap with them. Wid. How, sir, how ! that were but to sue out a habeas-corpus, for a removal from one prison to another. \u2014 Matrimony ! Free. Well, bailiffs, away with her. Wid. 0 stay, sir ! can you be so cruel as to bring me under Covert-Baron again, and put it out of my power to sue in my own name ? Matrimony to a woman is worse than excommunication, in depriving her of the benefit of the law ; and I would rather be deprived of life. But hark you, sir, I am contented you should hold and enjoy my person by lease or patent, but not by the spiritual patent called a licence ; that is, to have the privi leges of a husband, without the dominion ; that is, Durante beneplacito. In consideration of which, I will out of my jointure secure you an annuity of three hundred pounds a year, and pay your debts ; and that's all you younger brothers desire to marry a widow for, I'm sure. Free. Well, widow, if \u2014 Jer. What ! I hope, bully-guardian, you are not making agreements without me ! Free. No, no. First, widow, you must say no more that he is a son of a whore ; have a care of that. And, then, he must have a settled exhibi tion of forty pounds a year, and a nag of assizes, kept by you, but not upon the common ; and have free ingress, egress, and regress, to and from your maids' garret. Wid. Well, I can grant all that too. Jer. Ay, ay, fair words butter no cabbage : but, guardian, make her sign, sign and seal ; for other wise, if you knew her as well as I, you would not trust her word for a farthing. Free. I warrant thee, squire. \u2014 Well, widow, since thou art so generous, I will be generous too ; and if you'll secure me four hundred pounds a year, but during your life, and pay my debts, not above a thousand pounds, I'll bate you your person, to dispose of as you please. Enter Major Oldfox, with two Waiters. The Knights of the Post huddle up the writings. What, he here ! Go then, go my hearts, you have your instructions. [Exeunt Knights of ihe Post. Old. Come, madam, to be plain with you, I'll be fobbed off no longer. \u2014 [Aside.] I'll bind her and gag her but she shall hear me. \u2014 [To the Waiters.] Look you, friends, there's the money I promised you ; and now do you what you promised me : here my garters, and here's a gag. \u2014 [To the Widow.] You shall be acquainted with my parts, lady, you shall. Wid. Acquainted with your parts ! A rape ! a rape !\u2014 what, will you ravish me ! [The Waiters tie her to the chair, gag her, and exeunt. Old. Yes, lady, I will ravish you ; but it shall be through the ear, lady, the ear only, with my well penned acrostics. Enter Freeman, Jerry Blackacre, three Bailiffs, a Con- stable, and his Assistants,wji'(A the two Knights of the Post.

'Tis mine indeed now again, and it shall never escape more from me, to you at least. [The door broke open, enter Vernish with a dark- lantern and a sword, running at Manly, who draws. Come, my dear punctual lover, there is not such another in the world ; thou hast beauty and youth to please a wife ; address and wit, to amuse and fool a husband ; nay, thou hast all things to be wished in a lover, but your fits. I hope, my dear, you won't have one to-night ; and that you may not, I'll lock the door, though there be no need of it, but to lock out your fits : for my husband is just gene out of town again.

Not when you can give me, and yourself too, the satisfaction of abusing him again to-night. Come.

Your heart, sir, is a present of that value, I can never make any return to't. \u2014 [Pulling Manly /rora the company.] But I can give you back such a present as this, which I got by the loss of my father, a gentleman of the north, of no mean extraction, whose only child I was, therefore left me in the present possession of two thousand pounds a-year ; which I left, with multitudes of pretenders, to follow you, sir ; having in several public places seen you, and observed your actions thoroughly, with admiration, when you were too much in love to take notice of mine, which yet wf.9 but too visible.

Have a care, cousin, you'll confess anon too much; and I would not have your secrets. Man. Come, your blushes answer me sufficiently, and you have been my volunteer in love. [To Fidelia. Fid. I must confess I needed no compulsion to follow you all the world over ; which I attempted in this babit, partly out of shame to own my love to you, and fear of a greater shame, your refusal of it; for I knew of your engagement to this lady, and the constancy of your nature ; which nothing could have altered but herself. Man. Dear madam, I desired you to bring me out of confusion, and you have given me more. I know not what to speak to you, or how to look upon you ; the sense of my rough, hard, and ill usage of you, (though chiefly your own fault,) gives me more pain now 'tis over, than you had when you suffered it : and if my heart, the refusal of such a woman \u2014 [Pointing to Olivia] \u2014 were not a sacrifice to profane your love, and a greater wrong to you than ever yet I did you ; I would beg of you to receive it, though you used it as she had done ; for though it deserved not from her the treatment she gave it, it does from you. Fid. Then it has had punishment sufficient from her already, and needs no more from me ; and, I must confess, I would not be the only cause of making you break your last night's oath to me, of never parting with me ; if you do not forget or repent it. Man. Nay, now, madam, you have taVen from me all power of making you any compliment on my part ; for I was going to tell you, that so.- your sake only I would quit the unknown pleasure of a retirement ; and rather stay in this ill world of ours still, though odious to me, than give you more frights again at sea, and make again too great a venture there, in you alone. But if I should tell you now all this, and that your virtue (since greater than I thought any was in the world) had now re conciled me to't, my friend here would say, 'tis your estate that has made me friends with the world.

On \" The Old Bachelor.\" But you, my friend, your worth does safely boar Above their spleen ; you have no cause for fear Like a well-mettled hawk you took your flight Quite out of reach, and almost out of sight. As the strong sud, in a fair summer's day, You rise, and drive the mists and clouds away, The owls and bats, and all the birds of prey. Each line of yours like polish'd steel's so hard, In beauty safe it wants no other guard : Nature herself's beholden to your dress, hich though still like, much fairer you express. Some vainly striving honour to obtain, Leave to their heirs the traffic of their brain, Like china under ground, the ripening ware, In a long time, perhaps grows worth our care. But you now reap the fame, so well you've sown The planter tastes his fruit to ripeness grown. As a fair orange-tree at once is seen Big with what's ripe, yet spricging still with green So at one time my worthy friend appears, With all the sap of youth, and weight of years. Accept my pious love, as forward zeal, Which, though it ruins me, I can't conceal : Exposed to censure for my weak applause, I'm pleased to suffer in so just a cause : And though my offering may unworthy prove, Take, as a friend, the wishes of my love. When virtue in pursuit of fame appears, And forward shoots the growth beyond the years, We timely court the r-ising hero's cause, And on his side the poet wisely draws ; Bespeaking him hereafter by applause. The days will come when we shall all receive Returning interest from what now we give ; Instructed and supported by that praise And reputation which we strive to raise. Nature so coy, so hardly to be woo'd, Flies like a mistress, but to be pursued. 0 Congreve ! boldly follow on the chase ; She looks behind, and wants thy strong embrace ; She yields, she yields, surrenders all her charms. Do you but force her gently to your arms : Such nerves, such graces, in your lines appear, As you were made to be her ravisher. Dryden has long extended his command, By right divine, quite through the Muses' land Absolute lord ; and holding now from none, But great Apollo, his undoubted crown ; (That empire settled, and grown old in power) Can wish for nothing but a successor : Not to enlarge his limits, but maintain Those provinces which he alone could gain. His eldest Wycherley, in wise retreat, Thought it not worth his quiet to be great. Loose, wandering Etherege, in wild pleasures tost And foreign interests, to his hopes long lost : Poor Lee and Otway dead ! Congreve appears, The darling and last comfort of his years. Mayst thou live long in thy great Master's smiles And growing under him, adorn these isles : But when \u2014 when part of him (be that but late) His body yielding must submit to fate, Leaving his deathless works and thee behind, (The natural successor of his mind,) Then mayst thou finish what he has begun ; Heir to his merit, be in fame his son. What thou hast done shows all is in thy power ; And to write better, only must write more. 'Tis something to be willing to commend; But my best praise is, that I am your friend. j. marsh . To Air. Congreve. On his Play called \" The Old Bachelor.\" Wit, like true gold refined from all allay, Immortal is, and never can decav; 'Tis in all times and languages the same, Nor can an ill translation quench the flame : For though the form and fashion don't remain, The intrinsic value still it will retain. Then let each studied scene be writ with art ; And judgment sweat to form the labour'd part ; Each character be just, and Nature seem ; Without the ingredient, wit, 'tis all but phlegm : For that's the soul which all the mass must move, And wake our passions into grief, or love. But you, too bounteous, sow your wit so thick, We are surprised, and know not where to pick : And while with clapping we are just to you, Ourselves we injure, and lose something new. What mayn't we then, great youth, of thee presage. Whose art and wit so much transcend thy age ? How wilt thou shine at thy meridian height, Who, at thy rising, givest so vast a light ! When Dryden dying shall the world deceive, Whom we immortal, as his works, believe ; Thou shalt succeed, the glory of the stage? Adorn and entertain the coming age. THO. SOUTHERNS. To Mr. Congreve. On *' The Old Bachelor.' The danger's great in these censorious days, When critics are so rife, to venture praise : WThen the infectious and ill-natured brood Behold and damn the work because 'tis good ; And with a proud, ungenerous spirit, try To pass an ostracism on poetry. BEV1L HIGGONS. F,"], [240, "COMMENDATORY VERSES. 146 Already I am worn with cares and age, And just abandoning the ungrateful stage : Unprofitably kept at Heaven's expense, I live a rent-charge on his providence. But you, whom every Muse aud Grace adorn, Whom I foresee to better fortune born, Be kind to my remains ; and, oh defend, Against your judgment, your departed friend ! Let not the insulting foe my fame pursue, But shade those laurels which descend to you : And take for tribute what these lines express \u2022 You merit more, nor could my love do less. To my dear Friend Air. Congreve, on his Comedy called \" The Bouble-Dealer.\" Well, then, the promised hour is come at last ; The present age of wit obscures the past : Strong were our sires, and as they fought they writ, Conquering with force of arms and dint of wit ; Theirs was the giant race before the flood ; And thus, when Charles return'd, our empire stood. Like Janus he the stubborn soil manured, With rules of husbandry the rankness cured : Tamed us to manners, when the stage was rude ; And boisterous English wit with art endued. Our age was cultivated thus at length ; But what we gain'd in skill we lost in strength. Our builders were with want of genius curst ; The second temple was not like the first : 'Till you, the best Vitruvius, come at length, Our beauties equal, but excel our strength. Firm Doric pillars found your solid base, The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space ; Thus all below is strength, and all above is grace. In easy dialogue is Fletcher's praise ; He moved the mind, but had not power to raise. Great Jonson did by strength of judgment please ; Yet doubling Fletcher's force, he wants his ease. In differing talents both adorn'd their age ; One for the study, t'other for the stage. But both to Congreve justly shall submit, One mateh'd in judgment, both o'ermatch'd in wit. In him all beauties of this age we see, Etherege his courtship, Southerne's purity ; The satire, wit, and strength of manly Wycherley. All this in blooming youth you have achieved ; Nor are your foil'd contemporaries grieved ; So much the sweetness of your manners move, We cannot envy you, because we love. Fabius might joy in Scipio, when he saw A beardless consul made against the law, And join his suffrage to the votes of Rome ; Though he with Hannibal was overcome. Thus old Romano bow'd to Raphael's fame ; And scholar to the youth he taught became. Oh ! that your brows my laurel had sustain'd, Well had I been deposed if you had reign'd ! The lather had descended for the son ; For only you are lineal to the throne. Thus when the state one Edward did depose, A greater Edward in his room arose. But now, not I, but poetry is curst ; For Tom the second reigns like Tom the first. But let 'em not mistake my patron's part, Nor call his charity their own desert. Yet I this prophesy : Thou shalt be seen, (Though with some short parenthesis between,) High on the throne of wit ; and seated there, Not mine (that's little) but thy laurel wear. Thy first attempt an early promise made, That early promise this has more than paid ; So bold, yet so judiciously you dare, That your least praise is to be regular. Time, place, and action, may with pains be wrought, But genius must be born, and never can be taught. This is your portion, this your native store ; Heaven, that but once was prodigal before, To Shakspeare gave as much ; she could not give him more. JOHN DRYDEN. To Mr. Congreve, occasioned by his Comedy called \" The Way of the World.\" When pleasure's falling to the low delight, In the vain joys of the uncertain sight ; No sense of wit when rude spectators know, But in distorted gesture, farce and show : How could, great author, your aspiring mind Dare to write only to the few refined ? Yet though that nice ambition you pursue, 'Tis not in Congreve's power to please but few. Implicitly devoted to his fame, Well-dress'd barbarians know his awful name. Though senseless they're of mirth, but when they laugh, As they feel wine, but when, till drunk, they quaff. On you from fate a lavish portion fell In every way of writing to excel. Your muse applause to Arabella brings, In notes as sweet as Arabella sings. Whene'er you draw an undissembled woe, With sweet distress your rural numbers flow : Pastora's the complaint of every swain, Pastora still the echo of the plain ! Or if your muse describe, with warming force, The wounded Frenchman falling from his horse ; And her own William glorious in the strife, Bestowing on the prostrate foe his life : You the great act as generously rehearse, And all the English fury's in your verse. By your selected scenes and handsome choice, Ennobled Comedy exalts her voice ; You check unjust esteem and fond desire, And teach to scorn what else we should admire : The just impression taught by you we bear, The player acts the world, the world the player ; Whom still that world unjustly disesteems, Though he alone professes what he seems. But when your muse assumes her tragic part, She conquers and she reigns in every heart : To mourn with her men cheat their private woe, And generous pity's all the grief they know. The widow, who, impatient of delay, From the town joys must mask it to the play, Joins with your Mourning Bride's resistless moan, And weeps a loss she slighted when her own : You give us torment, and you give us ease, And vary our afflictions as you please. Is not a heart so kind as yours in pain, To load your friends with cares you only feign ; Your friends in grief, composed yourself, to leave ? But 'tis the only way you'll e'er deceive. Then still, great sir, your moving power employ, To lull our sorrow, and correct our joy. Maintain your post : that's all the fame you need ; For 'tis impossible you should proceed.

Sic leve, sic parvum est, animum quod Iaudis avarura Submit, aut reficit.\u2014 Horat. Lib. ii. Epist. 1. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES LORD CLIFFORD. OF LANESBOROUGH, &c. My Lord, \u2014 It is with a great deal of pleasure that I lay hold on this first occasion, which the accidents of my life have given me, of writing to your Lordship : for since, at the same time, I write to all the world, it will be a means of publishing {what I would have everybody know) the respect and duty which I owe and pay to you. I have so much inclination to be yours, that I need no other engagement : but the particular ties by which I am bound to your Lordship and family, have put it out of my power to make you any compliment ; since all offers of myself will amount to no more than an honest acknowledgment, and only show a willingness in me to be grateful. I am very near wishing that it were not so much my interest to he your Lordship's servant, that it might be more my merit ; not that I would avoid being obliged to you, but I would have my own choice to run me into the debt ; that I might have it to boast I had distinguished a man to whom I would be glad to be obliged, even without the hopes of having it in my power ever to make him a return. It is impossible for me to come near your Lordship, in any kind, and not to receive some favour \u2022 and while in appearance I am only making an acknowledgment, (with the usual underhand dealing of the world,) I am, at the same time, insinuating my own interest. I cannot give your Lordship your due, without tacking a bill of my own privileges. It is true, if a man never committed a folly, he would never stand in need of a protection : but then power would have nothing to do, and good-nature no occasion to show itself; and where those qualities are, it is pity they should want objects to shine upon. I must confess this is no reason why a man should do an idle thing, nor indeed any good excueo for it, when done ; yet it reconciles the uses of such authority and goodness to the necessities of our follies ; and is a cort of poetical logic, which at this time I would make use of, to argue your Lordship into a protection of this play. It is the first offence I have committed in this kind, or indeed in any kind of poetry, though not the first made public ; and therefore, I hope, will the more easily be pardoned : but had it been acted when it was first written, more might have been said in its behalf ; ignorance of the town and stage would then have been excuses in a young writer, which now almost four years' experience will scarce allow of. Yet I must declare myself sensible of the good-naturo of the town, in receiving this play so kindly, with all its faults, which I must own were, for the most part, very industriously covered by the care of the players ; for I think, scarce a character but received all the advantage it would admit of, from the justness of the action. As for the critics, my Lord, I have nothing to say to or against any of them of any kind ; from those who make just exceptions, to those who find fault in the wrong place. I will only make this general answer in behalf of my play, (an answer which Epietetus advises every man to make for himself to his censurers,) viz. \u2014 That if they whofind some faults in it were as intimate with it as I am, they would find a great many more. This is a confession which I needed not to have made ; but however I can draw this use from it, to my own advantage, that I think there are no faults in it but what I do know ; which, as I take it, is the first step to an amendment. Thus I may live in hopes (some time or other) of making the town amends ; but you, my Lord, I never can, though I am ever your Lordship's most obedient, and most humble servant, WILL. CONGREVE.

Most authors on the stage at first appear Like widows' bridegrooms, full of doubt and fear : They judge, from the experience of the dame, How hard a task it is to quench her flame : And who falls short of furnishing a course, Up to his brawny predecessor's force, With utmost rage from her embraces thrown, Remains convicted, as an empty drone. Thus often, to his shame, a pert beginner Proves, in the end, a miserable sinner. As for our youngster, I am apt to doubt him, With all the vigour of his youth about him, But he, more sanguine, trusts in one-and-twenty, And impudently hopes he shall content you ; For though his Bachelor be worn and cold, He thinks the young may club to help the old ; And what alone can be achieved by neither, Is often brought about by both together. The briskest of you all have felt alarms, Finding the fair one prostitute her charms, With broken sighs, in her old tumbler's arms. But for our spark, he swears he'll ne'er be jealous Of any rivals, but young lusty fellows. Faith, let him try his chance, and if the slave, After his bragging, prove a washy knave, May he be banish'd to some lonely den, And never more have leave to dip his pen : But if he be the champ'on he pretends, Both sexes sure will join to be his friends ; For all agree, where all can have their ends. And you must own him for a man of might, If he holds out to please you the third night. PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY MRS. 1. BRACEGIRDLE.

Come, come, leave business to idlers, and wisdom to fools : they have need of 'em : wit, be my faculty, and pleasure my occupation ; and let father Time shake his glass.

No, faith, Frank, you wrong her : she has been just to you. where L\u00e6titia was the handsomest woman in com pany, so consequently applied myself to her ; and it seems she has taken me at my word. Had you been there, or anybody, 't had been the same. Bell. I wish I may succeed as the same. Vain. Never doubt it ; for if the spirit of cuck oldom be once raised up in a woman, the devil can't lay it, 'till she has done 't. Bell. Prithee, what sort of fellow is Fondle wife ? Vain. A kind of mongrel zealot, sometimes very precise and peevish ; but I have seen him pleasant enough in his way ; much addicted to jealousy, but more to fondness: so that as he 's often jealous with out a cause, he 's as often satisfied without reason. Bell. A very even temper, and fit for my pur pose. I must get your man Setter to provide my disguise. Vain. Ay, you may take him for good-and-all if you will, for you have made him fit for nobody else. \u2014 Well \u2014 Vain. That's pleasant, by my troth, from thee, who hast had her. Bell. Never \u2014 her affections. 'Tis true, by hea ven, she owned it to my face ; and blushing like the virgin morn when it disclosed the cheat, which that trusty bawd of nature, Night, had hid, con fessed her soul was true to you ; though I by treachery had stolen the bliss. Vain. So was true as turtle \u2014 in imagination, Ned, ha ? Preach this doctrine to husbands, and the married women will adore thee. Bell. You 're going to visit in return of Silvia's letter \u2014 poor rogue ! Any hour of the day or night will serve her. \u2014 But do you know nothing of a new rival there ? Bell. Why, faith, I think it will do well enough, if the husband be out of the way, for the wife to show her fondness and impatience of his absence by choosing a lover as like him as she can ; and what is unlike, she may help out with her own fancy. Vain. Yes, Heartwell, that surly, old, pretended woman-hater, thinks her virtuous ; that 's one rea son why I fail her : I would have her fret herself out of conceit with me, that she may entertain some thoughts of him. I know he visits her every day. Bell. Yet rails on still, and thinks his love un known to us. A little time will swell him so, he must be forced to give it birth ; and the discovery must needs be very pleasant from himself, to see what pains he will take, and how he will strain to be delivered of a secret when he has miscarried of it already. Vain. But is it not an abuse to the lover to be made a blind of \\ Bell. As you say, the abuse is to the lover, not the husband : for 'tis an argument of her great zeal towards him, that she will enjoy him in effigy. Vain. It must be a very superstitious country, where such zeal passes for true devotion. I doubt it will be damned by all our protestant husbands for fiat idolatry. \u2014 But if you can make alderman Fondlewife of your persuasion, this letter will be needless. Vain. Well, good morrow, let 's diue together ; I '11 meet at the old place. Bell. With all my heart ; it lies convenient for us to pay our afternoon services to our mistresses. I find I am damnably in love, I 'm so uneasy for not having seen Belinda yesterday. Vain. But I saw my Araminta, yet am as im patient. Bell. What, the old banker with the handsome wife ? Vain. Ay. Bell. Let me see, L\u00e6titia ! oh, 'tis a delicious morsel !\u2014 Dear Frank, thou art the truest friend in the world. Vain. Ay, am I not ? to be continually starting of hares for you to course. We were certainly cut nut for one another ; for my temper quits an amour just where thine takes it up. \u2014 But read that, it is an appointment for me this evening, when Fondle wife will be gone out of town, to meet the master of a ship, about the return of a venture which he's in danger of losing.

Spintext ! oh, the fanatic one-eyed parson ! SCENE II. Bellmour. Why, what a cormorant in love am I ! who, not contented with the slavery of honourable love in one place, and the pleasure of enjoying some half a score mistresses of my own acquiring, must yet take Vainlove's business upon my hands, because it lay too heavy upon his : so am not only forced to lie with other men's wives for 'em, but must also undertake the harder task of obliging their mis tresses.\u2014I must tako up, or I shall never hold out; flesh and blood cannot bear it always.

Prithee, what mighty business of conse quence canst thou have? Bell. Why, you must know 'tis a piece of work toward the finishing of an alderman; itseemsl must put the last hand to it, and dub him cuckold, that he may be of equal dignity with the rest of his brethren ; so I must beg Belinda's pardon. Sharp. Faith, e'en give her over for good-and all; you can have no hopes of getting her for a mistress ; and she is too proud, too inconstant, too affected and too witty, and too handsome for a wife. Sharp. You, Bellmour, are hound in gratitude to stickle for him ; you with pleasure reap that fruit, which he takes pains to sow ; he does the drudgery in the mine, and you stamp your image on the gold. Bell. He's of another opinion, and says I do the drudgery in the mine. Well, we have each our share of sport, and each that which he likes best ; 'tis his diversion to set, 'tis mine to cover the partridge. Bell. But she can't have too much money. \u2014 There's twelve thousand pounds, Tom. \u2014 'Tis true she is excessively foppish and affected ; but, in my conscience, I believe the baggage loves me ; for she never speaks well of me herself, nor suffers anybody else to rail at me. Then, as I told yon, there's twelve thousand pounds\u2014 hum \u2014 Why, faith, upon second thoughts, she does not appear to be so very affected neither. \u2014 Give her her due, I think the woman's a woman, and that's all. As such I am sure I shall like her, for the de.vil take me if I don't love all the sex ! Heart. And it should be mine to let 'em go again. Sharp. Not till you had mouthed a little, George I think that's all thou art fit for now. Heart. Good Mr. Young-fellow, you're mista ken ; as able as yourself, and as nimble too, though I mayn't have so much mercury in my limbs. 'Tis true, indeed, I don't force appetite, but wait the natural call of my lust, and think it time enough to be lewd, after I have had the temptation. Bell. Time enough ! ay too soon, I should rather have expected, from a person of your gravity. Heart. Yet it is oftentimes too late with some of you young, termagant flashy sinners : you have all the guilt of the intention, and none of the plea sure of the practice. 'Tis true you are so eager in pursuit of the temptation, that you save the devil the trouble of leading you into it : nor is it out of discretion that you don't swallow that very hook yourselves have baited, but you are cloyed with the preparative, and what you mean for a whet, turns the edge of your puny stomachs. Your love is like your courage, which you show for the first year or two upon all occasions ; till in a little time, being disabled or disarmed, you abate of your vigour, and that daring blade which was so often drawn is bound to the peace for ever after. Bell. Thou art an old fornicator of a singular good principle indeed ! and art for encouraging youth, that they may be as wicked as thou art at thy years. Heart. I am for having everybody be what they pretend to be ; a whoremaster be a whoremaster, and not like Vainlove, kiss a lapdog with passion, when it would disgust him from the lady's own lips. Bell. That only happens sometimes, where the dog has the sweeter breath, for the more cleanly conveyance. But, George, you must not quarrel with little gallantries of this nature : women are often won by 'em. WTho would refuse to kiss a lapdog, if it were preliminary to the lips of his lady ? Sharp. Or omit playing with her fan, and cool ing her if. she were hot, when it might entitle him to the office of warming her when she should be cold? Sharp. And here comes one who swears as hear tily he hates all the sex. SCENE IV. Bellmour, Sharper, and Heartwell. Bell. Who ? Heartwell ? ay, but he knows better things. \u2014 How now, George, where hast thou been snarling odious truths, and entertaining com pany like a physician, with discourse of their diseases and infirmities ? WThat fine lady hast thou been putting out of conceit with herself, and per suading that the face she had been making all the morning was none of her own ? for I know thou art as unmannerly and as unwelcome to a woman as a looking-glass after the small-pox. Heart. I confess I have not been sneering ful some lies and nauseous flattery, fawning upon a little tawdry whore that will fawn upon me again, and entertain any puppy that comes, like a tumbler, with the same tricks over and over. For such I guess may have been your late employment. Bell. Would thou hadst come a little sooner ! Vainlove would have wrought thy conversion, and been a champion for the cause. Heart. What, has he been here ? That's one of love's April-fools, is always upon some errand that's to no purpose, ever embarking in adventures, yet never comes to harbour. Sharp. That's because he always sets out in foul weather, loves to buffet with the winds, meet the tide, and sail in the teeth of opposition. Heart. What, has he not dropped anchor at Araminta,? Bell. What is it to read a play in a rainy day, though you should be now and then interrupted in a witty scene, and she perhaps preserve her laughter,' till the jest were over ! even that may be borne with, considering the reward in prospect. Heart. I confess, you that are women's asses Bell. Truth on't is, she fits his temper best, is a kind of floating-island; sometimes seems in reach, then vanishes, and keeps him busied in the search.

Bell. O brute ! the drudgery of loving ! Heart. Ay, why to come to love through all these encumbrances, is like coming to an estate overcharged with debts ; which, by the time you have paid, yields no further profit than what the bare tillage and manuring of the land will produce at the expense of your own sweat. Bell. Prithee, how dost thou love ? Sharp. He ! he hates the sex. Heart. So I hate physic too \u2014 yet I may love to take it for my health. Bell. Well come off, George, if at any time you should be taken straying. Sharp. He has need of such an excuse, consi dering the present state of his body. Heart. How d'ye mean ? Sharp. Why, if whoring be purging (as you call it), then, I may say, marriage is entering into a course of physic. Bell. How, George, does the wind blow there ? Heart. It will as soon blow north and by south. \u2014 Marry, quotha ! I hope, in heaven, I have a greater portion of grace, and I think I have baited too many of those traps to be caught in one myself. Bell. Who the devil would have thee ? unless 'twere an oyster-woman, to propagate young fry for Billingsgate : \u2014 thy talent will never recommend thee to anything of better quality. Heart. My talent is chiefly that of speaking truth, which I don't expect should ever recommend me to people of quality.

A little of thy che mistry, Tom, may extract gold from that dirt. Sharp. Say you so ? faith, I am as poor as a chemist, and would be as industrious. But what was he that followed him ? Is not he a dragon that watches those goldeu pippins ? Bell. Hang him, no, he a dragon ! if he be, 'tis a very peaceful one ; I can ensure his anger dor mant ; or should he seem to rouse, 'tis but well lashing him, and he will sleep like a top. Sharp. Ay, is he of that kidney ? Bell. Yet is adored by that bigot sir Joseph Wittol, as the image of valour : he calls him his back, and indeed they are never asunder \u2014 yet last night, I know not by what mischance, the knight was alone, and had fallen into the hands of some night-walkers, who I suppose would have pillaged him ; but I chanced to come by, and rescued him : though I believe he was heartily frightened, for as soon as ever he was loose he ran away, without staying to see who had helped him. Sharp. Is that bully of his in the army ? Bell. No, but is a pretender, and wears the habit of a soldier ; which now-a-days as often cloaks cowardice, as a black gown does atheism. You must know, he has been abroad \u2014 went purely to run away from a campaign ; enriched himself with the plunder of a few oaths \u2014 and here vents 'em against the general ; who slighting men of merit, and preferring only those of interest, has made him quit the service. Sharp. And you, in return of spleen, hate them. But could you hope to be received into the alliance of a noble family \u2014 Heart. No, I hope I shall never merit that affliction \u2014 to be punished with a wife of birth\u2014 be a stag of the first head, and bear my horns aloft, like one of the supporters of my wife's coat. 'Sdeath, I would not be a cuckold to e'er an illus trious whore in England ! Bell. What, not to make your family, man ! and provide for your children ? Sharp. For her children, you mean. Heart. Ay, there you've nicked it \u2014 there's the devil upon devil. \u2014 O the pride and joy of heart 'twould be to me, to have my son and heir resem ble such a duke 1 \u2014 to have a fleering coxcomb scoff and cry, Mr., your son's mighty like his Grace, has just his smile and air os's face. Then replies another, Methinks he has more of the Marquis of such a place about his nose and eyes, though he has my Lord What-d'ye-call's mouth to a tittle. \u2014 Then I, to put it off as unconcerned, come chuck the infant under the chin, force a smile, and cry, Ay, the boy takes after his mother's relations : when the devil and she knows, 'tis a little compound of the whole body of nobility. Bell and Sharp. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Bell. Well, but, George, I have one question to ask you \u2014 Sharp. Wherein, no doubt, he magnifies his own performance. Bell. Speaks miracles, is the drum to his own praise \u2014 the only implement of a soldier he resem bles ; like that, being full of blustering noise and emptiness. Sharp. And like that, of no use but to be beaten. Bell. Right ; but then the comparison breaks, for he will take a drubbing with as little noise as a pulpit-cushion. Sharp. His name, and I have done ? Bell. Why, that, to pass it current too, he has gilded with a title : he is called Captain Bluffe. Sharp. Well, I'll endeavour his acquaintance ; you steer another course, are bound For Love's Island ; I for the golden coast : May each succeed in what he wishes most !

Sharp. Sir Joseph Wittol ! Sir Jo. The same, sir, of Wittol Hall, in comi tatu Bucks. Sir Joseph Wittol, Sharper following. Sharp. [Aside.] Sure that's he, and alone. Sir Jo. [Not perceiving Sharper.] Um \u2014 ay, this, this is the very damned place ; the inhuman cannibals, the bloody-minded villains would have butchered me last night : no doubt they would have fl;iyed me alive, have sold my skin, and devoured &c. Sharp. How's this ? Sir Jo. An it hadn't been for a civil gentleman as came by and frighted 'em away \u2014 but, agad, I durst not stay to give him thanks. Sharp. This must be Bellmour he means. \u2014 Ha ! I have a thought \u2014 Sir Jo. Zooks, would the captain would come ! the very remembrance makes me quake ; agad, I shall never be reconciled to this place heartily. Sharp. 'Tis but trying, and being where I am at worst. Now luck ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Cursed fortune ! this must be the place, this damned unlucky place ! Sir Jo. [Aside.] Agad, and so it is. Why, here has been more mischief done, I perceive. Sharp. No, 'tis gone, 'tis lost,\u2014 ten thousand devils on that chance which dre'w me hither! Ay, here, just here, this spot to me is hell; nothing to be found but the despair of what I've lost.

You are only pleased to say so.\u2014 But pray, if I may be so bold, what is that loss you mention ? Sir Jo. Poor gentleman! \u2014 By the lord Harry I'll stay no longer, for I have found too \u2014 Sharp. Ha ! who's that has found ? what have you found ? restore it quickly, or by \u2014 Sir Jo. Not I, sir, not 1, as I've a soul to be saved, I have found nothing but what has been to my loss, as I may say, and as you were saying, sir. Sharp. O, terra it no longer so, sir. In the scuffle, last night, I only dropped a bill of a hun dred pounds, which, I confess, I came half despair ing to recover, but thanks to my better fortune \u2014 Sir Jo. You have found it, sir, then it seems ; I profess I'm heartily glad. Sharp. O your servant, sir, you are safe then it seems ; 'tis an ill wind that blows nobody good. Well, you may rejoice over my ill fortune, since it paid the price of your ransom. Sir Jo. I rejoice ! agad, not I, sir ; I'm very sorry for your loss, with all my heart, blood and guts, sir; and if you did but know me, you'd ne'er say I were so ill-natured. Sharp. Sir, your humble servant \u2014 I don't question but you are ; that you have so cheap an opportunity of expressing your gratitude and gene rosity ; since the paying so trivial a sum will wholly acquit you and doubly engage me. Sir Jo. [Aside.] What, a dickens, does he mean by a trivial sum ? \u2014 [Aloud.] But ha'n't you found it, sir? Sharp. Know you ! why, can you be so ungrate ful to forget, me ? Sir Jo.

Stay, stay, sir, let me recollect. \u2014 [Aside.] He's a damned angry fellow \u2014 I believe I had better remember him, till I can get out of his sight ; but out o' sight, out o'mind, agad. Sharp. Methought the service I did you last night, sir, in preserving you from those ruffians, might have taken better root in your shallow me mory. Sharp. No otherwise, I vow to gad, but in my hopes in you, sir. Sir Jo. Humph. Sharp. But that's sufficient \u2014 'twere injustice to doubt the honour of sir Joseph Wittol. Sir Jo. O Lord, sir! Sharp.

Undoubtedly he did, sir. \u2014 Faith, Han nibal was a very pretty fellow ; but, sir Joseph, comparisons are odious ; Hannibal was a very pretty fellow in those days, it must be granted ; but alas, sir, were he alive now, he would be no thing, nothing in the earth. Sharp. How, sir ! I make a doubt if there be at this day a greater general breathing. Bluffe. Oh, excuse me, sir ; have you served abroad, sir ? Sharp. Not I really, sir. Bluffe. Oh, I thought so. \u2014 Why, then, you can know nothing, sir ; I am afraid you scarce know the history of the late war in Flanders, with all its particulars. Sharp. Not I, sir, no more than public letters or gazettes tell us. Bluffe.

Sir Jo. Let me but tell Mr. Sharper a little, how you eat fire once out of the mouth of a cannon. \u2014 Agad he did ; those impenetrable whiskers of his have confronted flames. Bluffe. O Lord, I beg your pardon, sir ! I find you are not of my palate, you can't relish a dish of fighting without sweet sauce. Now I think \u2014 Bluffe. Death, what do you mean, sir Joseph ? Sir Jo. Look you now, I tell you he's so modest he'll own nothing. Bluffe. Pish I you have put me out, I have forgot what I was about. Pray hold your tongue, and give me leave. [Angrily Sir Jo. I am dumb.

But that's not all ; you caught me in your arms when you named him, and pressed me to your bosom. \u2014 Sure, if I had not pinched you till you awaked, you had stifled me with kisses. Belin.

My denial is premeditated like your malice. \u2014 Lard, cousin, you talk oddly !\u2014What ever the matter is, O my Sol, I'm afraid you'll follow evil courses. Sir Jo.

Bell. But tell me how you would be adored ; I am very tractable. Belin. Then know, I would be adored in silence. Bell. Humph ! I thought so, that you might have all the talk to yourself. You had better let me speak ; for if my thoughts fly to any pitch, I shall make villanous signs. Belin. What will you get by that ? to make such signs as I won't understand. Bell. Ay, but if I am tongue-tied, I must have all my actions free to \u2014 quicken your apprehen sion \u2014 and, egad, let me tell you, my most prevail ing argument is expressed in dumb show. SCENE VII.

I should rather think favours, so gained, to be due rewards to indefatigable devotion. \u2014 For as Love is a deity, he must be served by prayer. Belin. O gad, would you would all pray to Love then, and let us alone ! Vain. You are the temples of Love, and 'tis through you our devotion must be conveyed. Never let him much obtain. Men will admire, adore, and die, While wishing at your feet they lie : But admitting their embraces Wakes 'em from the golden dream ; Nothing's new besides our faces, Every woman is the same. Aram.

Faith, madam, I dare not speak to her, but I'll make signs. Bell. Well, I find my apishness has paid the ransom for my speech, and set it at liberty ; though I confess I could be well enough pleased to drive on a love-bargain in that silent manner : 'twould save a man a world of lying and swearing at the year's end.

Well, since there's no remedy \u2014 Yet tell me, for I would know, though to the anguish of my soul, how did he refuse ? Tell me \u2014 how did he receive my letter ? in anger or in scorn ? Lucy. Neither ; but what was ten times worse, with damned senseless indifference. By this light, I could have spit in his face! Received it! why he received it as I would one of your lovers that should come empty-handed ; as a court lord does his mercers bill, or a begging dedication \u2014 he re ceived it as if 't had been a letter from his wife. SUv. 'Tis as hard to counterfeit love as it is to conceal it ; but I'll do my weak endeavour, though I fear I have not art. Lucy. Hang art, madam ! and trust to nature for dissembling. Man was by nature woman's cully made ; We never are but by ourselves betray'd. SCENE II. Heartwell, Vainlove and BELLB]ouR/o7ot.',\")if7. Bell. Hist, hist, is not that Heartwell going to Silvia ? Vain. He's talking to himself, I think ; prithee let's try if we can hear him. Heart. Why, whither in the devil's name am I a-going now ? Hum \u2014 let me think \u2014 is not this Silvia's house, the cave of that enchantress, and which consequently I ought to shun as I would infection ? To enter here, is to put on the en venomed shirt, to run into the embraces of a fever, and in some raving tit be led to plunge myself into that more consuming fire, a woman's arms. Ha ! well recollected, I will recover my reason, and be gone. SUv. What, did he not read it . Lucy. Hum'd it over, gave you his respects, and said he would take time to peruse it \u2014 but then he was in haste. SUv. Respects, and peruse it ! He's gone, and Araminta has bewitched him from me ! O how the name of rival fires my blood ! I could curse 'em both ; eternal jealousy attend her love, and disappointment meet his ! Oh that I could revenge the torment he has caused ! Methinks I feel the woman strong within me, and vengeance kindles in the room of love. Bell. Now, Venus forbid ! Vain. Hush ! Heart. Well, why do you not move . Feet, do your office \u2014 not one inch ; no, foregad, I'm caught ! There stands my north, and thither my needle points. \u2014 Now could I curse myself, yet cannot repent. 0 thou delicious, damned, dear, destruc tive woman ! 'Sdeath, how the young fellows will hoot me ! I shall be the jest of the town. Nay in two days I expect to be chronicled in ditty, and sung in woeful ballad, to the tune of the Superan nuated Maiden's Comfort, or the Baclielofs Fall; and upon the third, I shall be hanged in effigy, pasted up for the exemplary ornament of necessary houses and cobblers' stalls. Death, I can't think on't! \u2014 I'll run into the danger to lose the appre hension. Lucy. I have that in my head may make mis chief. SUv. How, dear Lucy ? Lucy. You know Araminta's dissembled coyness has won, and keeps him hers \u2014 SUv. Could we persuade him that she loves another \u2014 Lucy. No, you're out ; could we persuade him that she dotes on him, himself \u2014 contrive a kind letter as from her, 'twould disgust his nicety, and take away his stomach. Sdv.

I follow one as my master, t'other follows me as his conductor. SCENE III. Bellmour and Vainlove. Bell. A very certain remedy, probatum est. \u2014 Ha ! ha! ha ! poor George, thou art i' th' right, thou hast sold thyself to laughter; the ill-natured town will find the jest just where thou hast lost it. Ha ! ha ! how a' struggled, like an old lawyer between two fees ! \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE VI. Setter and Lucy. Vain. Or a young wench, between pleasure and reputation. Lucy. [Aside.] There's the hang- dog his man. I had a power over him in the reign of my mis tress ; but he is too true a valet-de-chambre not to affect his master's faults ; and consequently is re volted from his allegiance. Set. [Not perceiving Lucy.] Undoubtedly 'tis impossible to be a pimp and not a man of parrs. That is, without being politic, diligent, secret, wary and so forth : \u2014 and to all this, valiant as Hercules \u25a0 \u2014 that is, passively valiant and actively obedient. Ah, Setter, what a treasure is here lost for want of being known ! Bell. Or as you did to-day, when half afraid you snatched a kiss from Araminta. Vain. She has made a quarrel on't. Bell. Pauh ! women are only angry at such offences, to have the pleasure of forgiving 'em. Vain. And I love to have the pleasure of making my peace. \u2014 I should not esteem a pardon if too easily won. Bell. Thou dost not know what thou wouldst be at ; whether thou wouldst have her angry or pleased. Couldst thou be content to marry Ara minta ? Lucy. [Aside.] Here's some villany a-foot, he's so thoughtful; maybe I may discover something in my mask. \u2014 [Aloud.] Worthy sir, a word with you. [Puts on her mask. Set. Why, if I were known, I might come to be a great man \u2014 Vain. Could you be content to go to heaven ? Bell. Hum, not immediately, in my conscience not heartily. I'd do a little more good in my gene ration first, in order to deserve it. Lucy. Not to interrupt your meditation \u2014 Set. And I should not be the first that has pro cured his greatness by pimping. Lucy. Now poverty and the pox light upon thee, for a contemplative pimp \u25a0 Set. Ha ! what art, who thus maliciously hast awakened me from my dream of glory? Speak, thou vile disturber \u2014 Vain. Nor I to marry Araminta till I merit her. Bell. But how the devil dost thou expect to get her if she never yield ? Vain. That's true ; but I would \u2014 Bell. Marry her without her consent ; thou'rt a riddle beyond woman. Lucy. Of thy most vile cogitations. \u2014 Thou poor, conceited wretch, how wert thou valuing thyself upon thy master's employment ? For he's the head-pimp to Mr. Bellmour. Set. Good words, damsel, or I shall \u2014 but how dost thou know my master or me ? SCENE IV. Bellmour, Vainlove, and Setter. Bell. Trusty Setter, what tidings ? how goes the project ? Set. As all lewd projects do, sir, where the devil prevents our endeavours with success. Bell. A good hearing, Setter. Vain. Well, I'll leave you with your engineer. [Exit. Lucy. Yes, I know both master and man to be \u2014 Set. To be men perhaps ; nay, faith, like enough : I often march in the rear of my master, and enter the breaches which he has made. Lucy. Ay, the breach of faith, which he has begun : thou traitor to thy lawful princess ! Set. Why, how now! prithee, who art? Lay by that worldly face, and produce your natural vizor. Bell. And hast thou provided necessaries ? Set. All, all, sir ; the large sanctified hat, and the little precise band, with a swinging long-spiri tual cloak, to cover carnal knavery \u2014 not forgetting the black patch, which Tribulation Spintext wears, as I'm informed, upon one eye, as a penal mourn ing for the ogling offences of his youth ; and some say, with that eye he first discovered the frailty of his wife. Lucy. No, sirrah, I'll keep it on to abuse thee, and leave thee without hopes of revenge. Set. Oh ! I begin to smoke ye : thou art some forsaken Abigail we have dallied with heretofore, and art come to tickle thy imagination with remem brance of iniquity past. Lucy. No, thou pitiful flatterer of thy master's imperfections ! thou maukin, made up of the shreds and parings of his superfluous fopperies ! Set. Thou art thy mistress's foul self, composed of her sullied iniquities and clothing. Lucy. Hang thee, beggar's cur ! \u2014 Thy master is but a mumper in love ; lies canting at the gate, but never dares presume to enter the house. Set. Thou art the wicket to thy mistress's gate, to be opened for all comers. In fine, thou art the high-road to thy mistress. Lucy. Beast! filthy toad ! I can hold no longer: look and tremble. [Unmasks. Bell. Well, in this fanatic father's habit will I confess L\u00e6titia. Set. Rather prepare her for confession, sir, by helping her to sin. Bell. Be at your master's lodging in the evening, I shall use the robes. SCENE V. Setter. I shall, sir. \u2014 I wonder to which of these two gen tlemen I do most properly appertain ? \u2014 The one uses me as his attendant, the other (being the bet-"], [252, "THE OLD BACHELOR. 158 ACT VI. Set. How, Mrs. Lucy ! Lucy. I wonder thou hast the impudence to look that \u2014 tell him \u2014 I'll pink his soul \u2014 but whisper that softly to him. Sir Jo. So softly that he shall never hear on't, I warrant you. \u2014 Why, what a devil's the matter, bully, are you mad ? or d.'ye think I'm mad ? Agad, for my part, I don't love to be the messen ger of ill news ; 'tis an ungrateful office \u2014 so tell him yourself. Bluffe. By these hilts, I believe he frightened you into this composition ! I believe you gave it him out of fear, pure, paltry fear \u2014 confess. Sir Jo. No, no, hang't I was not afraid neither \u2014 though I confess he did in a manner snap me up \u2014 yet I can't say that it was altogether out of fear, but partly to prevent mischief \u2014 for he was a devilish choleric fellow : aud if my choler had been up too, agad, there would have been mischief done, that's flat. And yet I believe if you had been by, I would as soon have let him a' had a hundred of my teeth. Adsheart, if he should corae just now when I'm angry, I'd tell him \u2014 mum. me in the face. Set. Adsbud, who's in fault, mistress of mine ? who flung the first stone ? who undervalued my function ? and who the devil could know you by instinct ? Lucy. You could know my office by instinct, and be hanged ! which you have slandered most abominably. It vexes me not what you said of my person ; but that my innocent calling should be exposed and scandalised \u2014 I cannot bear it. [Pretends to cry. Set. Nay, faith, Lucy, I'm sorry; I'll own myself to blame, though we were both in fault as to our offices. \u2014 Come, I'll make you any reparation. Lucy. Swear. Set. I do swear to the utmost of my power. Lucy. To be brief then : \u2014 What is the reason vour master did not appear to-day according to the summons I brought him ? Set. To answer you as briefly : \u2014 He has a cause to be tried in another court. Lucy. Come, tell me in plain terms, how for ward he is with Araminta. SCENE VIII. Set. Too forward to be turned back ; though he's a little in disgrace at present about a kiss which he forced. You and I can kiss, Lucy, without all that. Sir Joseph Wittol, Bluffe, Bellmour, and Sharper. Bell. Thou'rt a lucky rogue ; there's your bene factor ; you ought to return him thanks now you have received the favour. Lucy. Stand off ! \u2014 He's a precious jewel ! Set. And therefore you'd have him to set in your lady's locket. Lucy. Where is he now ? Set. He'll be in the Piazza presently. Lucy. Remember to-day's behaviour \u2014 let me see you with a penitent face. Set. What, no token of amity, Lucy? you and I don't use to part with dry lips. Lucy. No, no, avaunt 1 \u2014 I'll not be slabbered and kissed now \u2014 I'm not i'th' humour. Sharp. Sir Joseph, your note was accepted, and the money paid at sight : I'm come to return my thanks. Sir Jo. They won't be accepted so readily as the bill, sir. Bell. I doubt the knight repents, Tom. He looks like the Knight of the Sorrowful Face. Sharp. This is a double generosity : \u2014 do me a kindness, and refuse my thanks. \u2014 But I hope you are not offended that I offered 'em ? Set. I'll not quit you so : \u2014 I'll follow and put you into the humour. Sir Jo. Maybe I am, sir, maybe I am not, sir, maybe I am both, sir ; what then ? I hope I may be offended, without any offence to you, sir? Sharp. Heyday ! Captain, what's the matter ? you can tell. Bluffe. Mr. Sharper, the matter is plain ; sir Joseph has found out your trick, and does not care to be put upon, being a man of honour. Sharp. Trick, sir? Sir Jo. Ay, trick, sir, and won't be put upon, sir, being a man of honour, sir, and so, sir \u2014 Sharp. Harkee, sir Joseph, a word with ye. \u2014 In consideration of some favours lately received, I would not have you draw yourself into a premu nire, by trusting to that sign of a man there \u2014 that potgun charged with wind. Sir Jo. O Lord, O Lord, captain, come justify yourself ! \u2014 I'll give him the lie if you'll stand to it. Sharp. Nay, then, I'll be beforehand with you; take that, oaf. [Cuffs him. SCENE VII. Sir Joseph Wittol and Bluffe. Bluffe. And so out of your unwonted generosity \u2014 Sir Jo. And good-nature, back ; 1 am good natured, and I can't help it. Bluffe. You have given him a note upon Fondle wife for a hundred pounds. Sir Jo. Ay, ay, poor fellow, he ventured fair for't. Bluffe. You have disobliged me in it, for I have occasion for the money, and if you would look me in the face again and live, go, and force him to redeliver you the note. Go, and bring it me hither : I'll stay here for you. Sir Jo. You may stay 'till the day of judgment then: by the Lord Harry, I know better things than to be run through the guts for a hundred pounds. \u2014 Why, 1 gave that hundred pounds for being saved, and d'ye think, an there were no danger, I'll be so ungrateful to take it from the gentleman again ? Bluffe. Well,go tohimfrom'me. \u2014 Tell him, I say he must refund, or Bilbo's the word, and slaughter will ensue :\u2014 if he refuse, tell him\u2014 but whisper Sir Jo. Captain, will you see this? won't you pink his soul ? Bluffe. Hush ! 'tis not so convenient now \u2014 I shall find a time. Sharp. What, do you mutter about a time, rascal? \u2014 You were the incendiary: \u2014 there's to put you in mind of your time \u2014 a memorandum. [Kicks him. Bluffe. Oh, this is your time, sir, you had best make use on't."], [253, "THE OLD BACHELOR. 159 9PRNE X. Sharp. Egad, and so I will : there's again for you. [Kicks him. Bluffe. You are obliging, sir, but this is too public a place to thank you in : but, in your ear, you are to be seen again. Sharp. Ay, thou inimitable coward, and to be felt : \u2014 as for example. [Kicks him. Bell. Ha ! ha ! ha ! prithee come away ; 'tis scandalous to kick this puppy, unless a man were cold, and had no other way to get himself a heat. Heart. Well, has this prevailed for me, and will you look upon me ? Silv. If you could sing and dance so, I should love to look upon you too. Heart. Why 'twas I sung and danced ; I gave music to the voice, and life to their measures.. \u2014 Look you here, Silvia, [Pulling out a purse and chinking it] here are songs and dances, poetry and music. Hark ! how sweetly one guinea rhymes to another, and how they dance to the music of their own chink. This buys all the t'other, and this thou shalt have ; this, and all that I am worth, for the purchase of thy love. \u2014 Say, is it mine then, ha ? Speak, siren ! \u2014 [Aside.] Oons, why do I look on her? Yet I must. \u2014 [Aloud.] Speak, dear angel ! devil ! saint ! witch ! do not rack me with suspense. Silv. Nay, don't stare at me so ; you make me blush, I cannot look. Heart. [Aside.] O manhood ! where art thou ? What am I come to ? a woman's toy, at these years ! Death, a bearded baby for a girl to dandle 1 O dotage, dotage ! That ever that noble passion, lust, should ebb to this degree! \u2014 No reflux of vigorous blood ; but milky love supplies the empty channels, and prompts me to the softness of a child \u2014 a mere infant, and would suck. \u2014 [Aloud.] Can you love me, Silvia ? speak. Silv. I dare not speak till I believe you, and indeed I'm afraid to believe you yet. Heart. [Aside.] Death, how her innocence torments and pleases me! \u2014 [Aloud.] Lying, child, is indeed the art of love ; and men are gene rally masters in it : but I'm so newly entered, you cannot distrust me of any skill in the treache rous mystery. Now, by my soul, I cannot lie, though it were to serve a friend or gain a mistress. Silv. Must you lie then, if you say you love me ? Heart. No, no, dear ignorance ! thou beauteous changeling ! I tell thee I do love thee, and tell it for a truth, a naked truth, which I am ashamed to discover. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE IX. Sir Joseph Wittol and Bivffe. Bluffe. Very well \u2014 very fine\u2014 but 'tisno matter. \u2014 Is not this fine, sir Joseph? Sir Jo. Indifferent, agad, in my opinion very indifferent. \u2014 I'd rather go plain all my life than wear such finery. Bluffe. Death and hell ! to be affronted thus ! I'll die before I'll suffer it. [Draws. Sir Jo. [Aside.] O Lord, his anger was not raised before ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Nay, dear captain, don't be in a passion now he's gone. \u2014 Put up, put up, dear back, 'tis your sir Joseph begs ; come, let me kiss thee ; so, so, put up, put up. Bluffe. By heaven, 'tis not to be put up ! Sir Jo. What, bully ? Bluffe. The affront. Sir Jo. No, agad, no more 'tis, for that's put up already : \u2014 thy sword I mean. Bluffe. Well, sir Joseph, at your entreaty. \u2014 [Puts up his sword.] But were not you, my friend, abased and cuffed and kicked ? Sir Jo. Ay, ay, so were you too; no matter, 'tis past. Bluffe. By the immortal thunder of great guns, 'tis false ! \u2014 he sucks not vital air who dares affirm it to this face. [Looks big. Sir Jo. To that face I grant you, captain : no, no, I grant you, not to that face, by the Lord Harry, if you had put on your fighting face before, you had done his business ; he durst as soon have kissed you, as kicked you to your face ; but a man can no more help what's done behind his back, than what's said. Come, we'll think no more of what's past. Bluffe. I'll call a council of war within to con sider of my revenge to come. Silv. But love, they say, is a tender thing, that will smooth frowns, and make calm an angry face ; wrill soften a rugged temper, and make ill-humoured people good : you look ready to fright one, and talk as if your passion were not love, but anger. Heart. 'Tis both, for I am angry with myself when I am pleased with you. And a pox upon me for loving thee so well ! \u2014 yet I must on. 'Tis a bearded arrow, and will more easily be thrust for ward than drawn back. Silv. Indeed if I were well assured you loved ; but how can I be well assured ? Heart. Take the symptoms, and ask all the tyrants of thy sex, if their fools are not known by this party-coloured livery. \u2014 I am melancholic when thou art absent, look like an ass when thou art pre sent, wake for thee when I should sleep ; and even dream of thee when I am awake ; sigh much, drink little, eat less, court solitude, am grown very enter taining to myself, and (as I am informed ) vry troublesome to everybody else. If this be not love, it is madness, and then it is pardonable. Nay, yet a more certain sign than all this, I give thee my money. SCENE X. \u2014 Silvia's Apartment. Heartwell and Silvia. SONG. As Amoret and Thyrsis lay Melting the hours in gentle play, Joining faces, mingling kisses, And exchanging harmless blisses ; He trembling cried with eager haste : \u2014 44 O, let me feed, as well as taste ; I die, if I'm not wholly blest !\" After the song a Dance of Antics. Silv. Ay, but that is no sign ; for they say gen tlemen will give money to any naughty woman to come to bed to them. O gemini ! I hope you don't mean so, for I won't be a whore. Silv. Indeed, it is very fine, I could look upon 'em ali day."], [254, "ACT IV. THE OLD BACHELOR. 160 I can get out of sight, I may get the better of myself. Silv. Well, good bye. [Pretends to weep. Heart. Ha ! nay come, we '11 kiss at parting. \u2014 [Aside.] By heaven, her kiss is sweeter than liberty! \u2014 [Aloud. ] I will marry thee; there thou hast done 't. All my resolves melted in that kiss \u2014 one more. Heart. The more is the pity. [Aside. Silv. Nay, if you would marry me, you should not come to bed to me, you have such a beard, and would so prickle one. But you do mtend to marry me ? Heart. [Aside.] That a fool should ask such a malicious question ! Death, I shall be drawn in before I know where I am !\u2014 However, I find I am pretty sure of her consent, if 1 am put to it. \u2014 [Aloud.] Marry you ! no, no, I'll love you. Silv. Nay, but if you love me, you must marry me ; what, don't I know my father loved my mother, and was married to her ? Heart. Ay, ay, in old days people married where they loved ; but that fashion is changed, child. Silv. But when ? Heart. I 'm impatient till it be done ; I will not give myself liberty to think, lest I should cool.\u2014 I will about a licence straight ; in the evening expect me. \u2014 One kiss more to confirm me mad \u2022 so. [Exit. Silv. Ha ! ha ! ha ! an old fox trapped ! Silv. Never tell me that, I know it is not changed by myself ; for I. love you and would marry you. SCENE XI. Silvia and Lucy. Heart. I '11 have my beard shaved, it shan't hurt thee, and we '11 go to bed. SUv. No, no, I 'm not such a fool neither but I can keep myself honest. Here, I won't keep any thing that 's yours ; I hate you now, [Throws the purse] and 1 '11 never see you again, 'cause you 'd have me be naught. [Going. Heart. [Aside.] Damn her ! let her go, and a good riddance ; yet so much tenderness and beauty and honesty together is a jewel. \u2014 [Aloud.] Stay, Silvia! \u2014 [Aside.] But then to marry \u2014 why, every man plays the fool once in his life ; but to marry is playing the fool all one's life long. Silv. What did you call me for ? Heart. I '11 give thee all I have ; and thou shalt live with me in everything so like my wife, the world shall believe it ; nay, thou shalt think so thyself, only let me not think so. Silv. No, I'll die before I '11 be your whore, as well as I love you ! Heart. [Aside.] A woman, and ignorant, may be honest, when 'tis out of obstinacy and contra diction ; but, 'sdeath ! it is but a may-be, and upon scurvy terms. \u2014 [Aloud.] Well, farewell then ; if Silv. Bless me ! you frighten me, I thought he had been come again, and had heard me. Lucy. Lord, madam, I met your lover in as much haste as if he had been going for a midwife ! Silv. He 's going for a parson, girl, the fore runner of a midwife, some nine months hence. \u2014 Well, I find dissembling to our sex is as natural as swimming to a negro ; we may depend upon our skill to save us at a plunge, though till then we never make the experiment. \u2014 But how hast thou succeeded ? Lucy. As you would wish ; since there is no reclaiming Vainlove. I have found out a pique she has taken at him, and have framed a letter that makes her sue for reconciliation first. I know that will do \u2014 walk in and I '11 show it you. Come, madam, you *re like to have a happy time on 't ; both your love and anger satisfied ! all that can charm our sex conspire to please you. That woman sure enjoys a blessed night, Whom love and vengeance both at once delight. [Exeunt. ACT IV. SCENE I. SCENE II. Tlie Street before Fondlewife's House. Fondlewife and Barnaby. Fond.

Sir, the hour draws nigh, and nothing will be done there till you come. Fond. And nothing can be done here till I go, so that I'll tarry, d'ye see. Bar. And run the hazard to lose your affair, sir? Fond. Goodlack, good lack! \u2014 I profess 'tis a very sufficient vexation, for a man to have a handsome wife. Fond. No, no, I tell you 1 shall have it in my head. L\u0153t. [Aside.] I know not what to think ; but I'm resolved to find the meaning of it. \u2014 [Aloud.] Unkind dear ! was it for this you sent to call me ? is it not affliction enough that you are to leave me, but you must study to increase it by unjust suspi cions ? \u2014 [Crying.] Well \u2014 well \u2014 you know my fondness, and you love to tyrannise.\u2014 Go on, cruel man ! do, triumph over my poor heart, while it holds ; which cannot be long, with this usage of yours \u2014 But that's what you want. \u2014 Well, you will have your ends soon \u2014 you will \u2014 you will. \u2014 Yes, it will break to oblige you.

And, in the mean time, I will reason with myself. \u2014 Tell me, Isaac, why art thee jealous ? why art thee distrustful of the wife of thy bosom ? \u2014 because she is young and vigorous, and I am old and impotent. Then why didst thee marry, Isaac ? \u2014 because she was beautiful and tempting, and because I was ob stinate and doting ; so that my inclination was, and is still, greater than my power. And will not that which tempted thee, also tempt others, who will tempt her, Isaac ? \u2014 I fear it much. But does not thy wife love thee, nay, dote upon thee ? \u2014 yes \u2014 Why then ! \u2014 Ay, but to say truth, she's fonder of me than she has reason to be ; and, in the way of trade, we still suspect the smoothest dealers of the deepest designs \u2014 and that she has some designs deeper than thou canst reach, th'hast experimented, Isaac \u2014 but, mum. L\u0153t. [Aside.] How! Heaven forbid ! that will be carrying the jest too far indeed. Fond. Won't you kiss Nykin ? L\u0153t. Go, naughty Nykin, you don't love me. Fond. Kiss, kiss, i'feck I do.

No, you shan't neglect your business for me \u2014 no indeed you san't, Nykin. \u2014 If you don't go, I'll think you been dealous of me still. Fond. He ! he ! he ! wilt thou, poor fool ? then I will go, I won't be dealous. \u2014 Poor Cocky, kiss Nykin, kiss Nykin ; ee ! ee ! ee ! \u2014 Here will be the good man anon, to talk to Cocky, and teach her how a wife ought to behave herself. L\u0153t. [Aside.] I hope to have one that will show me how a husband ought to behave himself. \u2014 [Aloud. ] I shall be glad to learn to please my jewel. [Kiss. Fond.

Wife, have you thoroughly considered how detestable, how heinous, and how crying a sin, the sin of adultery is ? have you weighed it, I say ? for it is a very weighty sin ; and although it may lie heavy upon thee, yet thy husband must also bear his part ; for thy iniquity will fall upon his head. L\u0153t. Bless me, what means my dear ! Fond. [Aside.] I profess she has an alluring eye ; I am doubtful whether I shall trust her, even with Tribulation himself. \u2014 [Aloud.] Speak, I say, have you considered what it is to cuckold your husband ? L\u0153t. [Aside.] I'm amazed; sure he has dis covered nothing ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Who has wronged me \u00a30 my dearest ? I hope my jewel does not think that ever I had any such thing in my head, or ever will have. M"], [256, "THE OLD BACHELOR. ACT IV. 162 covering him, starts.] Ah ! Heaven defend me ! who's this ? SCENE V. Bell. Your lover. Vainlove and Sharper. L\u0153t. Vainlove's friend ! I know his face, and he has betrayed me to him. [Aside. Bell. You are surprised. Did you not expect a lover, madam ? Those eyes shone kindly on my first appearance, though now they are o'ercast. L\u0153t. I may well be surprised at your person and impudence ; they are both new to me. You are not what your first appearance promised; the piety of your habit was welcome, but not the hypocrisy. Bell. Rather the hypocrisy was welcome, but not the hypocrite. Sharp. How, Araminta lost ! Vain. To confirm what I have said, read this \u2014 [Gives a letter. Sharp. [Reads.] Hum, hum. \u2014 And what then appeared a fault, upon reflection seems only an effect of a too powerful passion.

I only beg a favourable censure of this and your \u2014 Araminta. Sharp. Lost ! Pray Heaven thou hast not lost thy wits ! Here, here, she's thy own, man, signed and sealed too. To her, man ! \u2014 a delicious melon, pure and consenting ripe, and only waits thy cut ting up! \u2014 She has been breeding love to thee all this while, and just now she's delivered of it. Vain. 'Tis an untimely fruit, and she has mis carried of her love. L\u0153t. Who are you, sir ? you have mistaken the house sure. Bell. I have directions in my pocket, which agree with everything but your unkindness. [Pulls out the letter. L\u0153t. [Aside.] My letter I Base Vainlove ! Then 'tis too late to dissemble. \u2014 [Aloud.] \"sis plain then you have mistaken the person. [Going. Bell. [Aside. ] If we part so I'm mistaken. \u2014 [Aloud.] Hold, hold, madam ! I confess 1 have run into an error : I beg your pardon a thousand times What an eternal blockhead am I ! Can you forgive me the disorder I have put you into ? \u2014 But it is a mistake which anybody might have made. Sharp. Never leave this damned, ill-natured whimsy, Frank ? Thou hast a sickly, peevish appetite ; only chew love, and cannot digest it. Vain. Yes, when I feed myself \u2014 but I hate to be crammed. \u2014 By Heaven, there's not a woman will give a man the pleasure of a chase ! my sport is always balked, or cut short ; I stumble over the game I would pursue. 'Tis dull and unnatural to have a hare run full in the hound's mouth, and would distaste the keenest hunter : I would have overtaken, not have met, my game. L\u0153t. [Aside.] What can this mean ? 'Tis im possible he should be mistaken after all this. \u2014 A handsome fellow if he had not surprised me : me thinks, now I look on him again, I would not have him mistaken. \u2014 [Aloud.] We are all liable to mis takes, sir ; if you own it to be so, there needs no further apology. Bell. Nay, 'faith, madam, 'tis a pleasant one, and worth your hearing. Expecting a friend, last night, at his lodgings, till 'twas late, my intimacy with him gave me the freedom of his bed ; he not coming home all night, a letter was delivered to me by a servant in the morning ; upon the perusal I found the contents so charming, that I could think of nothing all day but putting 'em in prac tice \u2014 till just now, (the first time I ever looked upon the superscription,) I am the most surprised in the world to find it directed to Mr. Vainlove. Gad, madam, I ask you a million of pardons, and will make you any satisfaction. L\u0153t. I am discovered ! and either Vainlove is not guilty, or he has handsomely excused him. Sharp. However, I hope you don't mean to forsake it ; that will be but a kind of a mongrel cur's trick. \u2014 Well, are you for the Mall ? Vain. No, she will be there this evening. \u2014 Yes, I will go too \u2014 and she shall see her error in \u2014 Sharp. In her choice, egad ! \u2014 But thou canst not be so great a brute as to slight her ? Vain. I should disappoint her if I did not. By her management I should think she expects it.

I hope you are a gentleman ; \u2014 and since you are privy to a weak woman's failing, won't turn it to the prejudice of her reputation. You look as if you had more honour \u2014 Bell.

I fancied her like the front of her father's hall ; her eyes were the two jut windows, and her mouth the great door, most hospitably kept open for the entertainment of tra velling flies. Aram. So then, you have been diverted. What did they buy ? Belin. Why, the father bought a powder-horn, and an almanac, and a comb-case ; the mother, a great fruz-tower, and a fat amber-necklace ; the daughters only tore two pair of kid-leather gloves, with trying 'em on \u2014 Oh gad 1 here comes the fool that dined at my lady Freelove's t'other day.

No matter \u2014 I see Vainlove coming this way ; and, to confess my failing, I am willing to give him an opportunity of making his peace with me ; and to rid me of those coxcombs when I seem oppressed with 'em, will be a fair one. Bluffe. Ladies, by these hilts you are well met. Aram. We are afraid not. Aram. Why, what's the matter ? Belin. Oh, the most inhuman barbarous hack ney-coach !

Is it not so ? come, I'm inclining to believe every word you say. Bell. Why, faith, I must confess, so I designed you : but you were a little unlucky in coming so soon, and hindered the making of your own for tune. SCENE XXII.

In short then, I was informed of the op portunity of your absence by my spy (for faith, honest Isaac, I have a long time designed thee this favour). : I knew Spintext was to come by your direction. \u2014 But I laid a trap for him, and procured his habit ; in which I passed upon your servants, and was conducted hither. I pretended a fit of the colic to excuse my lying down upon your bed ; hoping that when she heard of it her good-nature would bring her to administer remedies for my dis temper. \u2014 You know what might have followed. \u2014 But like an uncivil person, you knocked at the door before your wife was come to me. Fond. Ha, this is apocryphal ! I may choose whether I will believe it or no. L\u0153t. Oh, goodness keep us! who's this ? \u2014 Who are you ? what are you ? Bell. So! L\u0153t.

Indeed, and indeed, now my dear Nykin, I never saw this wicked man before. Fond. Oh, it is a man then, it seems ! L\u0153t. Rather, sure, it is a wolf in the clothing of a sheep. Fond. Thou art a devil in his proper clothing, woman's flesh. What, you know nothing of him, but his fleece here ! You don't love mutton ! you Magdalen unconverted ? Bell. Well, now I know my cue \u2014 that is, very honourably to excuse her, and very impudently accuse myself. [Aside. L\u0153t. Why then, I wish I may never enter into the heaven of your embraces again, my dear, if ever I saw his face before. Fond. O Lord ! O strange ! I am in admira tion of your impudence. Look at him a little bet ter ; he is more modest, I warrant you, than to deny it \u2014 Come, were you two never face to face before ? Speak. Bell.

Now, were I ill-natured, would I utterly disappoint thy mirth : hear thee tell thy mighty jest with as much gravity as a bishop hears venereal causes iu the spiritual court : not so much as wrinkle my face with one smile ; but let thee look simply, and laugh by thyself.

But honest Setter, here, overheard you with Lucy, and has told me all. Bell. Nay, then, I thank thee for not putting me out of countenance. But, to tell you something you don't know, I got an opportunity (after I had mar ried 'em) of discovering the cheat to Silvia. She took it, at first, as another woman would the like disappointment : but my promise to make her amends quickly with another husband somewhat pacified her. Sharp.

Sharper swears she has forsworn the letter. \u2014 I'm sure he tells me truth ; \u2014 but I am not sure she told him truth. \u2014 Yet she was unaf- fectedly concerned, he says, and often blushed with anger and surprise : \u2014 and so I remember in the Park. She had reason, if I wrong her. \u2014 I be- gin to doubt. Sharp. Say'st thou so ? Set. This afternoon, sir, about an hour before my master received the letter. Sharp. In my conscience, like enough. Set. Ay, I know her, sir ; at least, I'm sure I can fish it out of her : she's the very sluice to her lady's secrets : 'tis but setting her mill a-going, and I can drain her of 'em all. Sharp. Here, Frank, your blood-hound has made out the fault : this letter, that so sticks in thy maw, is counterfeit ; only a trick of Silvia in revenge, contrived by Lucy. Vain. Ha ! it has a colour.\u2014 But how do you know it, sirrah ? Set. I do suspect as much ; \u2014 because why, sir She was pumping me about how your worship's affairs stood towards madam Araminta ; as when you had seen her last ? when you were to see her next ? and where you were to be found at that time ? and such like.

[To Bellmour.] O my conscience, I could find in my heart to marry thee, purely to be rid of thee : at least thou art so troublesome a lover, there's hopes thou'lt make a more than ordinary quiet husband. Bell. Say you so ? is that a maxim among you ? Belin. Yes ; you fluttering men of the mode have made marriage a mere French dish. Bell. I hope there's no French sauce. [Aside. Belin. You are so curious in the preparation ; that is, your courtship, one would think you meant a noble entertainment ; but when we come to feed, 'tis all froth, and poor, but in show ; nay, often only remains which have been I know not how many times warmed for other company, and at last served up cold to the wife. Bell. That were a miserable wretch indeed, who could not afford one warm dish for the wife of his bosom. \u2014 But you timorous virgins form a dreadful chimera of a husband, as of a creature contrary to that soft, humble, pliant, easy thing, a lover ; so guess at plagues in matrimony, in opposition to the pleasures of courtship. Alas ! courtship to mar riage, is but as the music in the playhouse till the curtain's drawn ; but that once up, then opens the scene of pleasure. Belin. Oh, foh ! no ; rather courtship to mar riage, is as a very witty prologue to a very dull play. Sharp. [Aside.] Now hold spleen. \u2014 [Aloud.] Married ! Heart. Certainly, irrecoverably married.

Heauton. TO TIIE RIGHT IIONOURABLE CHARLES MONTAGUE, ONE OF THE LORDS OF THE TREASURY. Sib,\u2014 I heartily wish that this play were as perfect as I intended it, that it might be more worthy your acceptance ; and that my dedication of it to you might be more becoming that honour and esteem which I, with everybody who is so fortunate as to know you, have for you. It had your countenance when yet unknown ; and now it is made public, it wants your protection. I would not have anybody imagine that I think this play without its faults, for I am conscious of several. I confess I designed (whatever vanity or ambition occasioned that design) to have written a true and regular comedy : but I found it an undertaking which put me in mind of \u2014 Sudet multinn, frustraque laboret ausus idem. And now, to make amends for the vanity of such a design, I do confess both the attempt, and the imperfect performance. Yet I must take the boldness to say, I have not miscarried in the whole ; for the mechanical part of it is regular. That I may say with as little vanity, as a builder may say he has built a house according to the model laid down before him ; or a gardener that he has set his flowers in a knot of such or such a figure. I designed the moral first, and to that moral I invented the fable, and do not know that I have borrowed one hint us it anywhere. I made the plot as strong as I could, because it was single ; and I made it single, because I would avoid confusion, and was resolved to preserve the three unities of the drama. Sir, this discourse is very impertinent to you, whose judgment much better can discern the faults, than I can excuse them ; and whose good-nature, like that of a lover, will find out those hidden beauties (if there are any such) which it would be great immodesty for me to discover. I think I do not speak improperly when I call you a lover of poetry ; for it is very well known she has been a very kind mistress to you : she has not denied you the last favour ; and she has been fruitful to you in a most beautiful issue \u2014 If I break off abruptly here, I hope everybody will under stand that it is to avoid a commendation, which, as it is your due, would be most easy for me to pay, and too trouble some for you to receive. I have, since the acting of this play, hearkened after the objections which have been made to it ; for I was conscious where a true critic might have put me upon my defence. I was prepared for the attack ; and am pretty confident I could have vindicated some parts, and excused others ; and where there were any plain miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confessed them. But I have not heard anything said sufficient to provoke an answer. That which looks most like an objection, does not relate in particular to this play, but to all or most that ever have been written ; and that is, soliloquy. Therefore I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save others the trouble, to whom it may hereafter be objected. I grant, that for a man to talk to himself appears absurd and unnatural ; and indeed it is so in most cases ; but the circumstances which may attend the occasion make great alteration. It oftentimes happens to a man to have designs which require him to himself, and in their nature cannot admit of a confidant. Such, for certain, is all villany ; and other less mischievous intentions may be vety improper to be communicated to a second person. In such a case, there fore, the audience must observe, whether the person upon the stage takes any notice of them at all, or no. For if he supposes any one to be by when he talks to himself, it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree. Nay, not only in this case, but in any part of a play, if there is expressed any knowledge of an audience, it is insufferable. But otherwise, when a man in soliloquy reasons with himself, and pro's and con's, and weighs all his designs, we ought not to imagine that this man either talks to us, or to himself ; he is only thinking, and thinking such matter as were inexcusable folly in him to speak. But because we are concealed spectators of the plot in agitation, and the poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole mystery of his contrivance, he is willing to inform us of this person's thoughts ; and to that end is forced to make use of the expedient of speech, no other better way being yet invented for the communication oi thought. Another very wrong objection has been made by some, who have not taken leisure to distinguish the characters. The hero of the play, as they are pleased to call him, (meaning Mellefont,) is a gull, and made a fool, and cheated. Is every man a gull and a fool that is deceived ? At that rate I am afraid the two classes of men will be reduced to one, ind the knaves themselves be at a loss to justify their title : but if an open-hearted honest man, who has an entire 'Confidence in one whom he takes to be his friend, and whom he has obliged to be so ; and who (to confirm him in his opinion) in all appearance, and upon several trials has been so ; if this man be deceived by the treachery of the other, must he of necessity commence fool immediately, only because the other has proved a villain ? Ay, but there was caution given to Mellefont in the first Act by his friend Careless. Of what nature was that caution ? Ouly to give the"], [268, "174 THE DOUBLE-DEALER. audience some light into the character of Maskwell, before his appearance ; and not to convince Mellefont of his treachery; for that was more than Careless was then able to do; he never knew Maskwell guilty of any villany; he was only a sort of man which he did not like. As for his suspecting his familiarity with my Lady Touchwood ; let them examine the answer that Mellefont makes him, and compare it with the conduct of Mask well's character through the play. I would beg them again to look into the character of Maskwell, before they accuse Mellefont of weakness for being deceived by him. For upon summing up the inquiry into this objection, it may be found they have mistaken cunning in one character, for folly in another. But there is one thing at which I am more concerned than all the false criticisms that are made upon me ; and that is, some of the ladies are offended. I am heartily sorry for it, for I declare I would rather disoblige all the critics in the world, than one of the fair sex. They are concerned that I have represented some women vicious and affected: how can I help it ? It is the business of a comic poet to paint the vices and follies of humankind ; and there are but two sexes, male and female, men and women, which have a title to humanity : and if I leave one half of them out, the work will be imperfect. I should be very glad of an opportunity to make my compliment to those ladies who are offended ; but they can no more expect it in a comedy, than to be tickled by a surgeon when he is letting them blood. They who are virtuous or discreet should not be offended ; for such characters as these distinguish them, and make their beauties more shining and observed : and they who are of the other kind, may nevertheless pass for such, by seeming not to be displeased, or touched with the satire of this comedy. Thus have they also wrongfully accused me of doing them a prejudice, when I have in reality done them a service. You will pardon me, Sir, for the freedom I take of making answers to other people, in an epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you : but since I intend the play to be so too, I hope I may take the more liberty of justifying it, where it is in the right. I must now, Sir, declare to the world how kind you have been to my endeavours ; for in regard of what was well meant, you have excused what was ill performed. I beg you would continue the same method in your acceptance of this dedication. I know no other way of making a return to that humanity you showed, in protecting an infant, but by enrolling it in your service, now that it is of age and come into the world. Therefore he pleased to accept of this as an acknowledgment of the favour you have shown me, and an earnest of the real service and gratitude of, Sir, your most obliged, humble servant, WILLIAM CONGREVE.

Moors have this way (as story tells) to know Whether their brats are truly got or no ; Into the sea the new-born babe is thrown, There, as instinct directs, to swim or drown. A barbarous device to try if spouse Has kept religiously her nuptial vows. Such are the trials poets make of plays : Only they trust to more inconstant seas ; So does our author this his child commit To the tempestuous mercy of the pit, To know if it be truly born of wit. Critics, avaunt ! for you are fish of prey, And feed, like sharks, upon an infant play. Be every monster of the deep away ; Let's a fair trial have, and a clear sea. Let Nature work, and do not damn too soon, For life will struggle long ere it sink down ; And will at least rise thrice before it drown. Let us consider, had it been our fate, Thus hardly to be proved legitimate ! I will not say, we'd all in danger been, Were each to suffer for his mother's sin ; But, by my troth, I cannot avoid thinking How nearly some good men might have 'scaped sinking. But Heaven be praised this custom is confined Alone to the offspring of the Muses' kind : Our christian cuckolds are more bent to pity ; I know not one Moor husband in the city. I' th' good man's arms the chopping bastard thrives; For he thinks all his own that is his wife's. Whatever fate is for this play design'd, The poet's sure he shall some comfort find : For if his muse has play'd him false, the worst That can befal him, is to be divorced ; You husbands judge, if that be to be cursed."], [269, "THE DOUBLE-DEALER. 175 SCENE III.

Then thy reason staggers, and thou'rt almost drunk. Care. No, faith, but your fools grow noisy ; and if a man must endure the noise of words without sense, I think the women have more musical voices, and become nonsense better. Mel. Why, they are at the end of the gallery, retired to their tea and scandal, according to their ancient custom, after dinner ; but I made a pre tence to follow you, because I had something to say to you in private, and I am not like to have many opportunities this evening.

I'll tell you, I would have mirth con tinued this day at any rate ; though patience pur chase folly, and attention be paid with noise : there are times when sense may be unseasonable, as well as truth. Prithee, do thou wear none to-day ; but allow Brisk to have wit, that thou mayst seem a fool. SCENE II. Careless, Mellefont, and Brisk. Brisk. Boys, boys, lads, where are you ?

Pshaw, man ! when I say you spoil company by leaving it, I mean you leave nobody for the company to laugh at. I think there I was with you, ha ? Mellefont. Care. Why, how now ! why this extravagant proposition ? Mel. O, I would have no room for serious design, for I am jealous of a plot. I would have noise and impertinence keep my lady Touchwood's head from working ; for hell is not more busy than her brain, nor contains more devils than that imagina tions. Care. I thought your fear of her had been over. Is not to-morrow appointed for your marriage with Cynthia ; and her father, sir Paul Plyant, come to settle the writings this day, on purpose ? Mel. True ; but you shall judge whether I have not reason to be alarmed. None besides you and Maskwell are acquainted with the secret of my aunt Touchwood's violent passion for me. Since my first refusal of her addresses, she has endea voured to do me all ill offices with my uncle ; yet has managed 'em with that subtlety, that to him they have borne the face of kindness ; while her malice, like a dark lantern, only shone upon me where it was directed. Still it gave me less per plexity to prevent the success of her displeasure, than to avoid the importunities of her love ; and of two evils, I thought myself favoured in her aver sion : but whether urged by her despair, and the short prospect of the time she saw to accomplish her designs ; whether the hopes of revenge, or of her love, terminated in the view of this my marriage with Cynthia, I know not ; but this morning she surprised me in my bed. Care. Was there ever such a fury ! 'tis well Mel. O' my word, Brisk, that was a home thrust : you have silenced him. Brisk. Oh, my dear Mellefont, let me perish, if thou art not the soul of conversation, the very essence of wit, and spirit of wine ! \u2014 The deuse take me, if there were three good things said, or one understood, since thy amputation from the body of our society. \u2014 He !

Nay gad I'll punish you for want of apprehension : the deuse take me if I tell you. Mel. No, no, hang him, he has no taste. \u2014 But, dear Brisk, excuse me, I have a little business. Care. Prithee get thee gone ; thou seest we are serious. Mel.

Nature has not put it into her sex's power to ravish. \u2014 Well, bless us ! proceed. What followed ? Mel. What at first amazed me : for I looked to have seen her in all the transports of a slighted and revengeful woman : but when I expected thunder from her voice, and lightning in her eyes ; I saw her melted into tears and hushed into a sigh. It was long before either of us spoke ; passion had tied her tongue, and amazement mine. \u2014 In short, the consequence was thus, she omitted nothing that the most violent love could urge, or tender words express ; which when she saw had no effect, but still I pleaded honour and nearness of blood to my uncle, then came the storm I feared at first : for starting from my bed-side like a fury, she flew to my sword, and with much ado I prevented her doing me or herself a mischief. Having disarmed her, in a gust of passion she left me, and in a reso lution, confirmed by a thousand curses, not to close her eyes till they had seen my ruin. Care. Exquisite woman ! but what the devil, does she think thou hast no more sense, than to get an heir upon her body to disinherit thyself 2 for, as I take it, this settlement upon you is with a proviso, that your uncle have no children. Mel. It is so. Well, the service you are to do me, will be a pleasure to yourself; I must get you to engage my lady Plyant all this evening, that my pious aunt may not work her to her interest. And if you chance to secure her to yourself, you may incline her to mine. She's handsome, and knows it ; is very silly, and thinks she has sense, and has an old fond husband. are frequent.

Pooh, pooh, nothing in the world but his design to do me service ; and he endeavours to be well in her esteem, that he may be able to effect it. Care. Well, I shall be glad to be mistaken ; but your aunt's aversion in her revenge cannot be any way so effectually shown as in bringing forth a child to disinherit you.

O no ; \u2014 never laugh indeed, sir. Care. No ! why, what d'ye go there for ? Lord Froth. To distinguish myself from the commonalty, and mortify the poets : the fellows grow so conceited when any of their foolish wit prevails upon the side-boxes, \u2014 I swear \u2014 he ! he ! he ! I have often constrained my inclinations to laugh, \u2014 he ! he ! he ! to avoid giving them encourage ment. Brisk. Let me see, let me see, my lord !

Then you must mortify him with a patch ; my wife shall supply you. Come, gentle men, allons, here is company coming. \u2014 . \u2014 Mel. You are cruel to yourself, my lord, as well as malicious to them. SCENE VI. Lord Froth. I confess I did myself some violence at first ; but now I think I have conquered it. Brisk. Let me perish, my lord, but there is something very particular in the humour ! 'Tis true, it makes against wit, and I'm sorry for some friends of mine that write, but, egad, I love to be malicious. Nay, deuse take me, there's wit in't too ; and wit must be foiled by wit ; cut a diamond with a diamond ; no other way, egad ! Lord Froth. Oh, I thought you would not be long before you found out the wit. Care. Wit ! in what ? where the devil's the wit in not laughing when a man has a mind to't ? Brisk.

That I should trust a man whom I had known betray his friend ! Mask. What friend have I betrayed? or to whom ? Lady Touch. Your fond friend Mellefont, and to me ; can you deny it ? Mask. I do not. Lady Touch. Have you not wronged my lord, who has been a father to you in your wants, and given you being ? Have you not wronged him in the highest manner, in his bed ? Mask. With your ladyship's help, and for your service, as I told you before. I can't deny that neither. \u2014 Anything more, madam ? Lady Touch. More ! audacious villain ! O, what's more, is most my shame '.--Have you not dishonoured me ? Mask. No, that I deny ; for I never told in all my life : so that accusation's answered ; on to the next. Lady Touch. Death, do you dally with my pas sion ? Insolent devil ! But have a care ;\u2014pro voke me not ; for, by the eternal fire, you shall not 'scape my vengeance ! \u2014 Calm villain ! How un concerned he stands, confessing treachery and ingratitude ! Is there a vice more black ! \u2014 O, I have excuses, thousands for my faults ! fire in my temper, passions in my soul, apt to every provoca tion ; oppressed at once with love and with despair. But a sedate, a thinking villain, whose black blood runs temperately bad, what excuse can clear? Mask. Will you be in temper, madam ? I would not talk not to be heard. I have been \u2014 [She walks about disordered] a very great rogue for your sake, and you reproach me with it ; I am ready to be a rogue still to do you service ; and you are flinging conscience and honour in my face to rebate my inclinations. How am I to behave myself? You know I am your creature, my life and fortune in vour power ; to disoblige you brings me certain ruin. Allow it, I would betray you, I would not be a traitor to myself: I don't pretend to honesty, because you know I am a rascal : but I would con vince you from the necessity of my being firm co you. Care. Smile ! no ; what the devil should you smile at, when you suppose I can't tell you ? Brisk. Pshaw ! pshaw ! prithee, don't interrupt me. \u2014 But I tell you, you shall tell me \u2014 at last but it shall be a great while first. Care. Well, but prithee don't let it be a great while, because I long to have it over. Brisk. Well, then, you tell me some good jest, or very witty thing, laughing all the while as if you were ready to die, and I hear it, and look thus. \u2014 Would not you be disappointed ? Care. No ; for if it were a witty thing, I should not expect you to understand it. Lord Froth. O soy, Mr. Careless ! all the world allows Mr. Brisk to have wit, my wife says he has a great deal. I hope you think her a judge. Brisk. Pooh, my lord, his voice goes for nothing ! I can't tell how to make him apprehend. \u2014 [ To Careless.] Take it t'other way : \u2014 suppose I say a witty thing to you ? Care. Then I shall be disappointed indeed. Mel.

Can no gratitude incline you, no obligations touch you ? Have not my fortune and my person been subjected to your pleasure ? W7ere you not in the nature of a servant, and have not I in effect made you lord of all, of me, and of my lord ? Where is that humble love, the languishing, that adoration, which once was paid me, and everlastingly en gaged ? Mask. Fixed, rooted in my heart, whence no thing can remove 'em, yet you \u2014 Lady Touch. Yet ! what yet ? Mask. Nay, misconceive me not, madam, when I say I have had a generous and a faithful passion, which you had never favoured, but through revenge and policy. Lady Touch. Ha! Mask. Look you, madam, we are alone : pray contain yourself, and hear me. You know you loved your nephew, when I first sighed for you ; I quickly found it ; an argument that I loved ; for with that art you veiled your passion, 'twas imper ceptible to all but jealous eyes. This discovery made me bold : I confess it ; for by it I thought you in my power. Your nephew's scorn of you added to my hopes ; I watched the occasion and took you, just repulsed by him, warm at once with love and indignation ; your disposition, my argu ments, and happy opportunity, accomplished my design ; I pressed the yielding minute, and was blessed. How I have loved you since words have not shown, then how should words express ? Lady Touch. Well, mollifying devil ! \u2014 and have I not met your love with forward fire ? Mask. Your zeal, I grant, was ardent, but mis placed ; there was revenge in view : that woman's idol had defiled the temple of the god, and love was made a mock-worship. \u2014 A son and heir would have edged young Mellefont upon the brink of ruin, and left him none but you to catch at for prevention. Lady Touch. Again, provoke me ! Do you wind me like a 'larum, only to rouse my own stilled soul for your diversion ? Confusion I Mask. Nay, madam, I'm gone, if you relapse. What needs this ? I say nothing but what you yourself, in open hours of love, have told me. Why should you deny it ? nay, how can you ? Is not all this present heat owing to the same fire ? Do you not love him still ? How have I this day offended you, but in not breaking off his match with Cynthia ? which ere to-morrow shall be done, \u2014 had you but patience. Lady Touch. How, what said you, Maskwell ?\u2014 Another caprice to unwind my temper? yiask. By Heaven, no ! I am your slave, the slave of all your pleasures ; and will not rest till I have given you peace, would you suffer me. Lady Touch. O, Maskwell, in vain I do disguise me from thee ! thou knowest me, knowest the verv inmost windings and recesses of my soul. \u2014 Oh Mellefont ! I burn. \u2014 Married to-morrow ! De spair strikes me. Yet my soul knows I hate him too : let him but once be mine, and next imme diate ruin seize him. Mask. Compose yourself, you shall possess and ruin him too. \u2014 Will that please you ? Lady Touch. How, how ? thou dear, thou pre cious villain, how ? Mask. You have already been tampering with my lady Plyant ? Lady Touch. I have : she is ready for any im pression I think fit. Mask. She must be thoroughly persuaded that Mellefont loves her. Lady Touch. She is so credulous that way na turally, and likes him so well, that she will believe it faster than I can persuade her. But I don't see what you can propose from such a trifling design ; for her first conversing with Mellefont will con vince her of the contrary. Mask. I know it. \u2014 I don't depend upon it. \u2014 But it will prepare something else ; and gain us leisure to lay a stronger plot : if I gain a little time I shall not want contrivance. One minute gives invention to destroy; What to rebuild, will a whole age employ. [Exeunt. ACT II SCENE I. \u2014 The Gallery in Lord Touchwood's House. Cyn. Write what ? Lady Froth.

Is it possible your lady ship could have been so much in love ? Lady Froth. I could not sleep ; I did not sleep one wink for three weeks together. Cyn. Prodigious ! I wonder want of sleep, and so much love, and so much wit as your ladyship has, did not turn your brain. Lady Froth. O my dear Cynthia, you must not rally your friend \u2014 But really, as you say, I wonder too ; \u2014 but then I had a way : for between you and I, I had whimsies and vapours, but I gave them vent.

O inconsistent 1 in love, and not write ! if my lord and I had been both of your temper, we had never come together. \u2014 O bless me 1 what a sad thing would that have been, if my lord and I should never have met ! Cyn. Then neither my lord nor you would ever have met with your match, on my conscience. Lady Froth. O' my conscience, no more we should ; thou sayest right : for sure my lord Froth is as fine a gentleman and as much a man of qua lity ! Ah, nothing at all of the common air !\u2014 I think I may say he wants nothing but a blue rib bon and a star to make him shine, the very phos phorus of our hemisphere. Do you understand Cyn.

I'm everlastingly your humble servant, deuse take me, madam. Lord Froth. [To Cynthia.] Don't you think us a happy couple ? Cyn. I vow, my lord, I think you the happiest couple in the world ; for you're not only happy in one another and when you are together, but happy in yourselves, and by yourselves. Lord Froth. I hope Mellefont will make a good husband too. Cyn. Yes, yes, madam, I'm not so ignorant. \u2014 [Aside.] At least I won't own it, to be troubled with your instructions. Lady Froth. Nay, I beg your pardon ; but being derived from the Greek, I thought you might have escaped the etymology. \u2014 But I'm the more amazed to find you a woman of letters, and not write ! bless me ! how can Mellefont believe you love him ? Cyn. Why faith, madam, he that won't take my word, shall never have it under my hand. Lady Froth. I vow Mellefont's a pretty gentle man, but methinks he wants a manner. Cyn. A manner ! what's that, madam ? Lady Froth. Some distinguishing quality, as for example, the bel air or brillant of Mr. Brisk ; the solemnity, yet complaisance of my lord, or some thing of his own that should look a little je ne sai quoi ; he is too much a mediocrity, in my mind. Cyn. He does not indeed affect either pertness or formality, for which I like him. Here he comes. Lady Froth. And my lord with him ; pray, observe the difference. Cyn. 'Tis my interest to believe he will, my lord. Lord Froth. D'ye think he'll love you as well as I do my wife ? I'm afraid not. Cyn. I believe he'll love me better. Lord Froth. Heavens ! that can never be ; but why do you think so ? Cyn. Because he has not so much reason to be fond of himself. Lord Froth. Oh, your humble servant for that, dear madam. \u2014 Well, Mellefont, you'll be a happy creature. Mel. Ay, my lord, I shall have the same reason for my happiness that your lordship has, I shall think myself happy. Lord Froth. Ah, that's all. Brisk. [To Lady Froth.] Your ladyship's in the right ; but, egad, I'm wholly turned into satire. I confess I write but seldom, but when I do \u2014 keen iambics, egad ! But my lord was telling me, your ladyship has made an essay toward an heroic poem. Lady Froth. Did my lord tell you ? yes, I vow, and the subject is my lord's love to me. And what do you think I call it ? I dare swear you won't guess \u2014 The Sillabub; ha ! ha ! ha ! Brisk. Because my lord's title's Froth, egad ; ha ! ha ! ha ! deuse take me, very a propos and surprising, ha ! ha ! ha ! Lady Froth. He ! ay, is not it ? \u2014 And then I call my lord Spumoso, and myself \u2014 what d'ye think I call myself? Brisk. Lactilla, maybe : \u2014 'gad, I cannot tell. Lady Froth.

Am I not to be absolute and uncontrollable ? Is it fit a woman of my spirit and conduct should be contradicted in a matter of this concern ? and wife one flesh, it leaves them still two fools ; and they become more conspicuous by setting off one another. Mel. That's only when two fools meet, and their follies are opposed. Cyn. Nay, I have known two wits meet, and by the opposition of their wit, render themselves as ridiculous as fools. 'Tis an odd game we're going to play at ; what think you of'drawing stakes, and giving over in time ? Mel. No, hang't, that's not endeavouring to win, because it's possible we may lose ; since we have shuffled and cut, let's e'en turn up trump now. Sir Paul. It concerns me, and only me; \u2014 besides, I'm not to be governed at all times. When I am in tranquillity, my lady Plyant shall command sir Paul ; but when I am provoked to fury, I can not incorporate with patience and reason : \u2014 as soon may tigers match with tigers, lambs with lambs, and every creature couple with its foe, as the poet says. Lady Ply. He's hot-headed still ! \u2014 'Tis in vain to talk to you ; but remember I have a curtain lecture for you, you disobedient, headstrong brute ! Sir Paul. No; 'tis because I won't be headstrong, because I won't be a brute, and have my head for tified, that I am thus exasperated. But I will protect my honour, and yonder is the violator of my fame. Lady Ply. 'Tis my honour that is concerned ; and the violation was intended to me. Your honour I you have none but what is in my keeping, and I can dispose of it when I please ; \u2014 therefore don't provoke me. Sir Paul.

[Lady Plyant and Sir Paul come up to Mellefont. Cyn. Then I find it's like cards : if either of us have a good hand, it is an accident of fortune. Mel. No, marriage is rather like a game at bowls ; Fortune indeed makes the match, and the two nearest, and sometimes the two farthest, are together ; but the game depends entirely upon judgment. Cyn. Still it is a game, and consequently one of us must be a loser. Mel. Not at all ; only a friendly trial of skill, and the winnings to be laid out in an entertain ment. \u2014 What's here, the music ! \u2014 [Musicians crossing the stage.] Oh, my lord has promised the company a new song ; we'll get 'em to give it us by the way. \u2014 Pray let us have the favour of you, to practise the song before the company hear it.

Yet she's vex'd if I give over ; Much she fears I should undo her, But much more to lose her lover : Thus in doubting she refuses ; And not winning, thus 6he loses. Lady Ply. Inhuman and treacherous \u2014 Sir Paul. Thou serpent and first tempter of womankind ! Prithee, Cynthia, look behind you, Age and wrinkles will o'ertake you ; Then, too late, desire will find you.

Thy, Thy, come away Thy ! touch him not. Come hither, girl, go not near him, there's nothing but deceit about him ; snakes are in his peruke, and the crocodile of Nilus in his belly ; he will eat thee up alive. Lady Ply. Dishonourable, impudent creature! Mel. For Heaven's sake, madam, to whom do you direct this language ! Lady Ply. Have I behaved myself with all the decorum and nicety befitting the person of Sir Paul's wife ? have I preserved my honour as it were in a snow-house for these three years past ? have I been white and unsullied even by Sir Paul himself?

Mel. For Heaven's sake, madam \u2014 Lady Ply. O name it no more ! \u2014 Bless me, how can you talk of heaven ! and have so mucli wickedness in your heart ? Maybe you don't think it a sin. \u2014 They say some of you gentlemen don't think it a sin. \u2014 Maybe it is no sin to them that don't think it so ; indeed, if I did not think it a sin \u2014 but still my honour, if it were no sin. \u2014 But then, to marry my daughter, for the conve niency of frequent opportunities, I'll never consent to that ; as sure as can be, I'll break the match.

To wrong so good, so fair a creature, and one that loves you tenderly ; 'tis a barbarity of barbarities, and nothing could be guilty of it \u2014 Mel. But the greatest villain imagination can form. I grant it ; and next to the villany of such a fact is the villany of aspersing me with the guilt. How ? which way was I to wrong her ? for yet I understand you not. Lady Ply. Why, gads my life, cousin Melle font, you cannot be so peremptory as to deny it, when I tax you with it to your face 1 for, now sir Paul's gone, you are corum nobus. Mel.

O reflect upon the horror of that, and then the guilt of deceiving everybody ; marry ing the daughter, only to make a cuckold of the father ; and then seducing me, debauching my purity, and perverting me from the road of virtue, in which I have trod thus long, and never made one trip, not one faux pas; O consider it, what would you have to answer for, if you should pro voke me to frailty ? Alas ! humanity is feeble, Heaven knows ! very feeble, and unable to support itself. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE VI. Mellefont, after a pause. So then, spite of my care and foresight, I am caught, caught in my security. \u2014 Yet this was but a shallow artifice, unworthy of my Machiavelian aunt : there must be more behind, this is but the first flash, the priming of her engine ; destruction follows hard, if not most presently prevented. Mel. Where am I ? is it day? and am I awake? \u2014 Madam \u2014"], [276, "THE DOUBLE-DEALER. 182 ACT III. jealousy might qualify me to assist her in her revenge ; and, in short, in that belief, told me the secrets of her heart. At length we made this agreement, if I accomplish her designs (as I told you before) she has engaged to put Cynthia with all her fortune into my power. Mel. She is most gracious in her favour ! \u2014 Well, and dear Jack, how hast thou contrived ? SCENE VII. Mellefont and Maskwell. Mel. Maskwell, welcome ! thy presence is a view of land, appearing to my shipwrecked hopes ; the witch has raised the storm, and her ministers have done their work ; you see the vessels are parted. Mask. I would not have you stay to hear it now ; for I don't know but she may come this way ; I am to meet her anon ; after that, I'll tell you the whole matter ; be here in this gallery an hour hence, by that time I imagine our consulta tion may be over. Mel. I will ; till then success attend thee. Mask. I know it ; I met sir Paul towing away Cynthia. Come, trouble not your head, I'll join you together ere to-morrow morning, or drown between you in the attempt. Mel. There's comfort in a hand stretched out, to one that's sinking, though ne'er so far off. Mask. No sinking, nor no danger. Come, cheer up ; why, you don't know, that while 1 plead for you, your aunt has given me a retaining fee ? \u2014 Nay, I am your greatest enemy, and she does but journey-work under me. Mel. Ha ! how's this ? \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE VIII. Maskwell. Till then, success will attend me ; for when I meet you, I meet the only obstacle to my fortune. \u2014 Cynthia, let thy beauty gild my crimes ; and what soever I commit of treachery or deceit, shall be imputed to me as a merit. \u2014 Treachery ! what treachery ? love cancels all the bonds of friendship, and sets men right upon their first foundations. \u2014 Duty to kings, piety to parents, gratitude to bene factors, and fidelity to friends, are different and particular ties : but the name of rival cuts 'em all asunder, and is a general acquittance. Rival is equal, and love like death, a universal leveller of mankind. Ha ! but is there not such a thing as honesty ? Yes, and whosoever has it about him bears an enemy in his breast : for your honest man, as I take it, is that nice scrupulous conscientious person, who will cheat nobody but himself ; such another coxcomb as your wise man, who is too hard for all the world, and will be made a fool of by nobody but himself : ha ! ha ! ha ! well, for wisdom and honesty, give me cunning and hypo crisy ; oh, 'tis such a pleasure to angle for fair faced fools ! Then that hungry gudgeon credulity will bite at anything.\u2014 Why, let me see, I have the same face, the same words and accents, when I speak what I do think, and when I speak what I do not think \u2014 the very same \u2014 and dear dissimula tion is the only art not to be known from nature. Why will mankind be fools, and be deceived ? And why are friends and lovers' oaths believed ? When each, who searches strictly his own mind, May so much fraud and power of baseness find. [Exit. Mash. WTiat d'ye think of my being employed in the execution of all her plots ? Ha ! ha I ha ! by heaven it's true ! I have undertaken to break the match, I have undertaken to make your uncle disinherit you, to get you turned out of doors ; and to \u2014 ha! ha! ha! I can't tell you for laughing. \u2014 Oh she has opened her heart to me, \u2014 I am to turn you a grazing, and to \u2014 ha ! ha ! ha ! marry Cynthia myself ; there's a plot for you ! Mel. Ha! Oh I see, I see, my rising sun! light breaks through clouds upon me, and I shall live in day ! \u2014 O my Maskwell ! how shall I thank or praise thee ? thou hast outwitted woman \u2014 But tell me, how couldst thou thus get into her confidence ? ha ! how ? \u2014 But was it her contrivance to persuade my lady Plyant to this extravagant belief ? Mask. It was ; and, to tell you the truth, I encouraged it for your diversion : though it made you a little uneasy for the present, yet the reflec tion of it must needs be entertaining. \u2014 I warrant she was very violent at first. Mel. Ha ! ha ! ha ! ay, a very fury ; but I was most afraid of her violence at last. \u2014 If you had not come as you did, I don't know what she might have attempted. Mask. Ha ! ha ! ha ! I know her temper. \u2014 Well, you must know, then, that all my contri vances were but bubbles ; till at last I pretended to have been long secretly in love with Cynthia ; that did my business ; that convinced your aunt I might be trusted, since it was as much my interest as hers to break the match : then, she thought my ACT III. SCENE I \u2014 The Gallery in Lord Touchwood's House. would centre everything in her own circle. 'Tis not the first time she has mistaken respect for love, and made Sir Paul jealous of the civility of an nn designing person, the better to bespeak his security in her unfeigned pleasures. Lady Touch. You censure hardly, my lord ; my sister's honour is very well known. Lord Touch. Yes, I believe I know some that have been familiarly acquainted with it. This is a little trick wrought by some pitiful contriver, en vious of my nephew's merit. Lord Touchwood and Lady Touchwood. Lady Touch. My lord, can you blame my bro ther Plyant, if he refuse his daughter upon this provocation ? the contract's void by this unheard of impiety. Lord Touch. I don't believe it true ; he has better principles \u2014 Pho, 'tis nonsense ! Come, come, I know my lady Plyant has a large eye, and"], [277, "THE DOUBLE-DEALER. SCENE II. 183 Lady Touch. Nay, my lord, it may be so, and I hope it will be found so : but that will require some time ; for in such a case as this, demonstra tion is necessary. Lady Touch. Nay, no great matter, only \u2014 well, I have your promise \u2014 pho, why nothing, only your nephew had a mind to amuse himself sometimes with a little gallantry towards me. Nay, I can't think he meant anything seriously, but methought it looked oddly. Lord Touch. Confusion and hell, what do I hear! Lord Touch. There should have been demon stration of the contrary too, before it had been believed. Lady Touch. So I suppose there was. Lord Touch. How ? where ? when ? Lady Touch. Or, maybe, he thought he was not enough akin to me, upon your account, and had a mind to create a nearer relation on his own ; a lover, you know, my lord \u2014 ha ! ha ! ha ! Well, but that's all \u2014 Now, you have it; well, remember your promise, my lord, and don't take any notice of it to him. Lady Touch. That I can't tell ; nay, I don't say there was. I am willing to believe as favourably of my nephew as I can. Lord Touch. I don't know that. [Half aside. Lady Touch. How ? don't you believe that, say you, my lord ? Lord Touch. No, I don't say so. \u2014 I confess I am troubled to find you so cold in his defence. Lady Touch. His defence ! bless me, would you have me defend an ill thing ? Lord Touch. You believe it then ? Lord Touch. No, no, no \u2014 damnation ! Lady Touch. Nay, I swear you must not ! A little harmless mirth \u2014 only misplaced, that's all ; but if it were more, 'tis over now, and all's well. For my part, I have forgot it ; and so has he, I hope; for I have not heard anything from him these two days. Lord Touch. These two days ! is it so fresh ? Unnatural villain! Death, I'll have him stripped and turned naked out of my doors this moment, and let him rot and perish, incestuous brute ! Lady Touch. O for Heaven's sake, my lord ! you'll ruin me if you take such public notice of it, it will be a town-talk : consider your own and my honour \u2014 nay, I told you, you would not be satisfied when you knew it. Lord Touch. Before I've done I will be satisfied. Ungrateful monster, how long \u2014 Lady Touch. I don't know ; I am very unwilling to speak my thoughts in anything that may be to my cousin's disadvantage ; besides, 1 find, my lord, you are prepared to receive an ill impression from any opinion of mine which is not consenting with your own ; but since I am like to be suspected in the end, and 'tis a pain any longer to dissemble, I own it to you ; in short, I do believe it, nay, and can believe anything worse, if it were laid to his charge. \u2014 Don't ask me my reasons, my lord ; for they are not fit to be told you. Lord Touch. [Aside.] I'm amazed, here must be something more than ordinary in this.\u2014 [Aloud.] Not fit to be told me, madam ? you can have no interests wherein I am not concerned, and conse quently the same reasons ought to be convincing to me which create your satisfaction or disquiet. Lady Touch. But those which cause my disquiet, I am willing to have remote from your hearing. Good my lord, don't press me. Lord Touch. Don't oblige me to press you. Lady Touch. Whatever it was, 'tis past ; and that is better to be unknown which cannot be pre vented ; therefore let me beg you to rest satisfied. Lord Touch. When you have told me, I will. Lady Touch. You won't. Lord Touch. By my life, my dear, I will. Lady Touch. What if you can't ? Lord Touch. How ? then I must know, nay I will : no more trifling. \u2014 I charge you tell me ! \u2014 by all our mutual peace to come ! upon your duty !\u2014 Lady Touch. Nay, my lord, you need say no more, to make me lay my heart before you : but don't be thus transported ; compose yourself ; it is not of concern, to make you lose one minute's temper. 'Tis not indeed, my dear. Nay, by this kiss, you shan't be angry. O Lord, I wish I had not told you anything !\u2014 Indeed, my lord, you have frighted me. Nay, look pleased, I'll tell you. Lord Touch. Well, well. Lady Touch. Nay, but will you be calm .'\u2014in deed it's nothing but \u2014 Lord Touch. But what ? Lady Touch. But will you promise me not to be angry ?\u2014 nay, you must, \u2014 not to be angry with Mellefont ? \u2014 I dare swear he's sorry ; and were it to do again, would not \u2014 Lady Touch. Lord, I don't know ! I wish my lips had grown together when I told you Almost a twelvemonth. \u2014 Nay, I won't tell you any more, till you are yourself. Pray, my lord, don't let the company see you in this disorder. \u2014 Yet, I confess I can't blame you ; for I think I was never so surprised in my life. \u2014 Who would have thought my nephew could have so misconstrued my kindness ? But will you go into your closet, and recover your temper ? I'll make an excuse of sudden business to the company, and come to you. Pray, good dear my lord, let me beg you do now : I'll come imme diately, and tell you all ; will you, my lord ? Lord Touch. I will \u2014 I am mute with wonder. Lady Touch. Well, but go now, here's some body coming. Lord Touch. Well, I go. \u2014 You won't stay ? for I would hear more of this. Lady Touch. I follow instantly. \u2014 So, SCENE II. Lady Touchwood and Maskwell. Mask. This was a masterpiece, and did not need my help ; \u2014 though I stood ready for a cue to come in and confirm all, had there been occasion. Lady Touch. Have you seen Mellefont ? Mask. I have ; and am to meet him here about this time. Lady Touch. How does he bear his disappoint ment ? Mask. Secure in my assistance, he seemed not much afflicted, but rather laughed at the shallow artifice, which so little time must of necessity dis cover. Yet he is apprehensive of some farther Lord Touch. Sorry, for what ? death, you rack me with delay !"], [278, "THE DOUBLE-DEALER. ACT III. 184 design of yours, and has engaged me to watch you. I believe he will hardly be able to prevent your plot, yet I would have you use caution and expedi tion. Lady Touch. Expedition indeed ; for all we do, must be performed in the remaining part of this evening, and before the company break up ; lest my lord should cool, and have an opportunity to talk with him privately.\u2014 M-y lord must not see him again. SCENE IV. Maskwell and Mellefont. Mask. Mercy on us ! what will the wickedness of this world come to ? Mel. How now, Jack ? what, so full of contem plation tliat you run over ! Mash. I'm glad you're come, for I could not contain myself any longer ; and was just going to give vent to a secret, which nobody but you ought to drink down. \u2014 Your aunt's just gone from hence. Mask. By no means ; therefore you must aggra vate my lord's displeasure to a degree that will admit of no conference with him. \u2014 What think you of mentioning me ? Mel. And having trusted thee with the secrets of her soul, thou art villanously bent to discover 'em all to me, ha ! Lady Touch. How ? Mask. To my lord, as having been privy to Mellefont's design upon you, but still using my utmost endeavours to dissuade him, though my friendship and love to him has made me conceal it ; yet you may say, I threatened the next time he attempted anything of that kind, to discover it to my lord. Lady Touch. To what end is this ? Mask. It will confirm my lord's opinion of my honour and honesty, and create in him a new con fidence in me, which (should this design miscarry) will be necessary to the forming another plot that 1 have in my head. \u2014 [Aside.] To cheat you as well as the rest. Mask. I'm afraid my frailty leans that way. \u2014 But I don't know whether I can in honour discover 'em alL Mel. All, all, man ; what ! you may in honour betray her as far as she betrays herself. No tragical design upon my person, I hope ? Mask. No, but it's a comical design upon mine. Mel. What dost thou mean ? Mask. Listen and be dumb, we have been bar gaining about the rate of your ruin. Mel. Like any two guardians to an orphan heiress. \u2014 Well. Mask. And, whereas pleasure is generally paid with mischief, what mischief I do is to be paid with pleasure. Mel. So when you've swallowed the potion, you sweeten your mouth with a plum. Mask. You are merry, sir, but I shall probe your constitution. In short, the price of your banishment is to be paid with the person of \u2014 Mel. Of Cynthia, and her fortune. \u2014 Why, you forget you told me this before. Mask. No, no. \u2014 So far you are right ; and I am, as an earnest of that bargain, to have full and free possession of the person of your \u2014 aunt. Mel. Ha !\u2014 Pho, you trifle ! Mask. By this light, I'm serious ; all raillery apart \u2014 I knew 'twould stun you : this evening at eight she will receive me in her bedchamber. Mel. Hell and the devil ! is she abandoned of all grace ? \u2014 why, the woman is possessed ! Mask. Well, will you go in my stead ? Mel. By Heaven into a hot furnace sooner ! Mask. No, you would not. \u2014 It would not be so convenient as I can order matters. Lady Touch. I'll do it \u2014 I'll tell him you hindered him once from forcing me. Mask. Excellent ! your ladyship has a most improving fancy. You had best go to my lord, keep him as long as you can in his closet, and I doubt not but you will mould him to what you please ; your guests are so engaged in their own follies and intrigues, they'll miss neither of you. Lady Touch. When shall we meet ? \u2014 At eight this evening in my chamber ; there rejoice at our success, and toy away an hour in mirth. Mash I wiil not fail. \u25a0 * SCENE III. Maskwell. I know what she means by toying away an hour well enough. Pox! I have lost all appetite to her; yet she's a fine woman, and I loved her once. But I don't know, since I have been in a great measure kept by her, the case is altered ; what was my pleasure is become my duty : and I have as little stomach to her now as if I were her husband. Should she smoke my design upon Cynthia, I were in a fine pickle. She has a damned penetrating head, and knows how to interpret a coldness the right way ; therefore I must dissemble ardour and ecstacy, that's resolved : how easily and pleasantly is that dissembled before fruition ! Pox on't ! that a man can't drink without quenching his thirst. Ha ! yonder comes Mellefont thoughtful. \u2014 Let me think : meet her at eight \u2014 hum \u2014 ha \u2014 by heaven, I have it \u2014 if I can speak to my lord before. \u2014 Was it my brain or Providence ? No matter which.\u2014 I will deceive 'em all, and yet secure myself: 'twas a lucky thought ! Well, this double-dealing is a jewel. Here he comes, now for me. Mel. What d'ye mean ? Mask. Mean ! not to disappoint the lady, I assure you.\u2014 [Aside.] Ha! ha! ha! how gravely he looks ! \u2014 [Aloud] Come, come, I won't perplex you. 'Tis the only thing that Providence could have contrived to make me capable of serving you, either to my inclination or your own necessity. Mel. How, how, for Heaven's sake, dear Mask well ? Mask. Why thus : I'll go according to appoint ment ; you shall have notice at the critical minute to come and surprise your aunt and me together ; counterfeit a rage against me, and I'll make my escape through the private passage from her cham ber, which I'll take care to leave open: 'twill be hard if then you can't bring her to any conditions. For this discovery will disarm her of all defence, and leave her entirely at your mercy : nay, she must ever after be in awe of you. [Maskwell pretending not to see him, walks by him, and speaks, as it were, to himself."], [279, "THE DOUBLE-DEALER. 185 SCENE VI. Mel. Let me adore thee, my better genius ! by Heaven I think it is not in the power of fate to disappoint my hopes ! \u2014 My hopes ! my certainty ! Mask. Well, I'll meet you here within a quarter of eight, and give you notice. Mel. Good fortune ever go along with thee ! Ply her close, and by-and-by clap a billet-doux into her hand; for a woman never thinks a man truly in love with her till he has been fool enough to think of her out of her sight, and to lose so much time as to write to her SCENE VI. SCENE V. Careless, Sir Paul and Lady Plyant. Mellefont and Careless. Sir Paul. Shan't we disturb your meditation, Mr. Careless ? you would be private ? Care. You bring that along with you, sir Paul, that shall be always welcome to my privacy. Sir Paul. O sweet sir, you load your humble servants, both me and my wife, with continual favours. Care. Mellefont, get out o' th' way, my lady Plyant's coming, and I shall never succeed while thou art in sight,\u2014 though she begins to tack about ; but I made love a great while to no purpose. Mel. Why, what's the matter? she's convinced that I don't care for her. Care. I can't get an answer from her that does not begin with her honour, or her virtue, her reli gion, or some such cant. Then she has told me the whole history of sir Paul's nine years' court ship ; how he has lain for whole nights together upon the stairs before her chamber door ; and that the first favour he received from her was a piece of an old scarlet petticoat for a stomacher, which since the day of his marriage he has, out of a piece of gallantry, converted into a nightcap, and wears it still with much solemnity on his anniversary wedding-night. Mel. That I have seen, with the ceremony thereunto belonging : for on that night he creeps in at the bed's feet, like a gulled bassa that has married a relation of the Grand Signior, and that night he has his arms at liberty. Did not she tell you at what a distance she keeps him ? He has confessed to me that but at some certain times, that is, I suppose, when she apprehends being with child, he never has the privilege of using the fa miliarity of a husband with a wife. He was once given to scrambling with his hands and sprawling in his sleep ; and ever since she has him swaddled up in blankets, and his hands and feet swathed down, and so put to bed ; and there he lies with a great beard, like a Russian bear upon a drift of snow. You are very great with him, I wonder be never told you his grievances : he will, I warrant you. Care. Excessively foolish ! \u2014 But that which gives me most hopes of her is her telling me of the many temptations she has resisted. Mel. Nay, then you have her ; for a woman's bragging to a man that she has overcome tempta tions, is an argument that they were weakly offered, and a challenge to him to engage her more irresist ibly. 'Tis only an enhancing the price of the commodity by telling you how many customers have underbid her. Lady Ply. Sir Paul, what a phrase was there ! Y'ou will be making answers, and taking that upon you which ought to lie upon me ! \u2014 That you should have so little breeding to think Mr. Careless did not apply himself to me ! Pray what have you to entertain anybody's privacy ? I swear, and declare in the face of the world, I'm ready to blush for your ignorance ! Sir Paul. [Aside to Lady Plyant.] I acquiesce, my lady ; but don't snub so loud. Lady Ply. Mr. Careless, if a person that is wholly illiterate might be supposed to be capable of being qualified to make a suitable return to those obligations which you are pleased to confer upon one that is wholly incapable of being qualified in all those circumstances, I'm sure I should rather attempt it than anything in the world ; [Curtsies.] for I'm sure there's nothing in the world that I would rather. [Curtsies.] But I know Mr. Careless is so great a critic and so sine a gentleman, that it is impossible for me \u2014 \u25a0 Care. O heavens, madam, you confound me ! Sir Paul. Gadsbud, she's a fine persou. Lady Ply. O Lord, sir, pardon me, we women have not those advantages. I know my own im perfections. \u2014 But at the same time you must give me leave to declare in the face of the world, that nobody is more sensible of favours and things ; for, with the reserve of my honour, I assure you, Mr. Careless, I don't know anything in the world I would refuse to a person so meritorious. \u2014 You'll pardon my want of expression. Care. O, your ladyship is abounding in all ex cellence, particularly that of phrase. Lady Ply. You are so obliging, sir. Care. Your ladyship is so charming. Sir Paul. So, now, now ; now, my lady. Lady Ply. So well bred. Care. So surprising. Lady Ply. So well dressed, so bonne mine, so eloquent, so unaffected, so easy, so free, so par ticular, so agreeable \u2014 Sir Paul. Ay, so, so, there. Care. O Lord, I beseech you, madam ! don't \u2014 Lady Ply. So gay, so graceful, so good teeth, so fine shape, so fine limbs, so fine linen, and I don't doubt but you have a very good skin, sir. Care. For Heaven's sake, madam! \u2014 I'm quite out of countenance. Care. Nay, I don't despair : but still she has a grudging to you. I talked to her t'other night at my lord Froth's masquerade, when I'm satisfied she knew me, and I had no reason to complain of my reception ; but I find women are not the same barefaced and in masks ; and a vizor disguises their inclinations as much as their faces. Mel. 'Tis a mistake, for women may most pro perly be said to be unmasked when they wear vizors ; for that secures them from blushing, and being out of countenance ; and next to being in the dark, or alone, they are most truly themselves in a vizor-mask. \u2014 Here they come, I'll leave you. \u2014 Sir Paul. And my lady's quite out of breath : or else you should hear \u2014 Gadsbud, you may talk of my lady Froth !"], [280, "I THE DOUBLE-DEALER. 186 ACT III. Care.

You'll scarcely believe me, when I shall tell you. My lady is so nice \u2014 it's very strange, but it's true \u2014 too true \u2014 she's so very nice, that I don't believe she would touch a man for the world ; \u25a0 \u2014 at least not above once a year. I'm sure I have found it so ; and, alas ! what's once a year to an old man, who would do good in his generation ? Indeed it's true, Mr. Careless, it breaks my heart. \u2014 I am her husband, as I may say ; though far unworthy of that honour, yet I am her husband ; but, alas-a-day ! I have no more familiarity with her person, as to that matter, than with my own mother ; \u2014 no indeed. Care. Alas-a-day, this is a lamentable story ! my lady must be told on't ; she must i'faith, sir Paul ; 'tis an injury to the world. Sir Paul. Ay, would to heaven you would, Mr. Careless ! you are mightily in her favour. Care. I warrant you. \u2014 What, we must have a son some way or other ! Sir Paul. Indeed, I should be mightily bound to you, if you could bring it about, Mr. Careless. Lady Ply. Here, sir Paul, it's from your steward ; here's a return of six hundred pounds ; you may take fifty of it for the next half year. [Gives him the letter. Sir Paul. Nay, I swear and vow, that was pretty. Care. O, sir Paul, you are the happiest man alive ! Such a lady ! that is the envy of her own sex, and the admiration of ours. Sir Paul. Your humble servant. I am, I thank heaven, in a fine way of living, as I may say, peacefully and happily, and I think need not envy any of my neighbours, blessed be Providence ! \u2014 Ay, truly, Mr. Careless, my lady is a great blessing, a fine, discreet, well-spoken woman as you shall see, if it becomes me to say so, and we live very comfortably together; she is a little hasty some times, and so am I ; but mine's soon over, and then I'm so sorry. \u2014 O Mr. Careless, if it were not for one thing \u2014 \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE VII. Careless, Sir Paul, Lady Plyant, and Boy with a letter. Lady Ply. How often have you been told of that, you jackanapes ! Sir Paul.

Care. What can that be, sir Paul ? Sir Paul. Why, I have, I thank heaven, a very plentiful fortune, a good estate in the coun try, some houses in town, and some money, a pretty tolerable personal estate ; and it is a great grief to me, indeed it is, Mr. Careless, that I have not a son to inherit this. \u2014 'Tis true, I have a daughter, and a fine dutiful child she is, though I say it, blessed be Providence ! I may say ; for indeed, Mr. Careless, I am mightily beholden to Providence : \u2014 a poor unworthy sinner.- \u2014 But if I had a son, \u2014 ah, that's my affliction, and my only affliction ! indeed I cannot refrain tears when it comes in my mind.

Oh, a fine, likely woman as you shall see in a summer's day ! indeed she is, Mr. Care less, in all respects. Care. And I should not have taken you to have been so old \u2014 Lord Froth. Well, and how? hee ! what is your sense of the conversation ? Cyn. O, most ridiculous ! a perpetual consort of laughing without any harmony ; for sure, my lord, to laugh out of time is as disagreeable as to sing out of time or out of tune. Lord Froth. Hee ! hee ! hee ! right. And then, my lady Whifler is so ready ; \u2014 she always comes in three bars too soon. \u2014 And then, what do they laugh at ? for you know laughing without a jest is as impertinent ; hee ! as, as \u2014 Cyn. As dancing without a fiddle. Lord Froth. Just, i'faith ! that was at my tongue's end. Cyn. But that cannot be properly said of them, for I think they are all in good-nature with the world, and only laugh at one another ; and you must allow they have all jests in their persons, though they have none in their conversation. Sir Paul. Alas 1 that's not it, Mr. Careless ; ah ! that's not it ; no, no, you shoot wide of the"], [281, "THE DOUBLE-DEALER. SCENE X. 187 Lord Froth. True, as I'm a person of honour. \u2014 For heaven's sake let us sacrifice 'em to mirth a little. think bilk (I know it's good rhyme), but don't you think bilk and fare too like a hackney-coachman ? Lady Froth. I swear and vow, I am afraid so. \u2014 And yet our Jehu was a hackney-coachman when my lord took him. Brisk. Was he ? I'm answered, if Jehu was a hackney-coachman. \u2014 YTou may put that in the marginal notes though, to prevent criticism. \u2014 Only mark it with a small asterism, and say, Jehu was formerly a hackney-coachman. Lady Froth. I will ; you'd oblige me extremely to write notes to the whole poem. Brisk. With all my heart and soul, and proud of the vast honour, let me perish ! Lord Froth. Hee ! hee ! hee ! my dear, have you done ? \u2014 won't you join with us ? we were laughing at my lady Whifler and Mr. Sneer. Lady Froth. Ay, my dear. \u2014 Were you ? O filthy Mr. Sneer ! he's a nauseous figure, a most fulsamic fop, foh ! \u2014 He spent two days together in going about Covent-Garden, to suit the lining of his coach with his complexion. Lord Froth. O silly ! yet his aunt is as fond of him, as if she had brought the ape into the world herself. Enter Boy, and whispers Sir Paul. Sir Paul. Gads so \u2014 Wife ! wife ! my lady Ply ant ! I have a word. Lady Ply. I'm busy, sir Paul, I wonder at your impertinence ! Care. [Aside to Sir Paul.] Sir Paul, hark ye, I'm reasoning the matter you know. \u2014 [Aloud. ] Madam, if your ladyship please, we'll discourse of this in the next room. Sir Paul. O ho ! I wish you good succecs, I wish you good success. \u2014 Boy, tell my lady, when she has done I would speak with her below. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE X. Cynthia, Lord Froth, Lady Froth, and Brisk. Lady Froth. Then you think that episode be tween Susan, the dairy-maid, and our coachman, is not amiss ; you know I may suppose the dairy in town as well as in the country. Brisk. Incomparable, let me perish ! \u2014 But then being an heroic poem, had not you better call him a charioteer ? charioteer sounds great ; besides, your ladyship's coachman having a red face, and you comparing him to the sun ; and you know the sun is called heaven's charioteer. Brisk. Who, my lady Toothless ! O, she's a mortifying spectacle ; she's always chewing the cud like an old ewe. Cyn. Fy, Mr. Brisk ! eringos for her cough. Lady Froth. I have seen her take 'em half chewed out of her mouth, to laugh, and then put them in again \u2014 foh ! Lord Froth. Foh ! Lady Froth. Oh, infinitely better ! I am ex tremely beholden to you for the hint ; stay, we'll read over those half a score lines again. [Pulls out a paper.] Let me see here, you know what goes before, \u2014 the comparison, you know. [Reads. For as the sun shines every day, Lady Froth. Then she's always ready to laugh when Sneer offers to speak, and sits in expectation of his no jest, with her gums bare, and her mouth open \u2014 So, of our coachman I may say \u2014 Brisk. I'm afraid that simile won't do in wet Brisk. Like an oyster at low ebb, egad \u2014 Ha ! ha ! ha ! weather ; \u2014 because you say the sun shines every day. Lady Froth. No, for the sun it won't, but it will do for the coachman ; for you know there's most occasion for a coach in wet weather. Cyn. [Aside.] Well, I find there are no fools so inconsiderable in themselves, but they can ren der other people contemptible by exposing their infirmities. Lady Froth. Then that t'other great strapping lady \u2014 1 can't hit of her name \u2014 the old fat fool that paints so exorbitantly. Brisk. I know whom you mean \u2014 but, deuse take me ! I can't hit of her name neither.\u2014 \"-Paints, d'ye say ? why she lays it on with a trowel. \u2014 Then she has a great beard that bristles through it, and makes her look as if she were plastered with lime and hair, let me perish ! Lady Froth. Oh, you made a song upon her, Mr. Brisk. Brisk. Right, right, that saves all. Lady Froth. Then, I don't say the sun shines all the day, but that he peeps now and then ; yet he does shine all the day too, you know, though we don't see him. Brisk. Right, but the vulgar will never compre hend that. Lady Froth. Well, you shall hear. \u2014 Let me see. [Reads. For as the sun shines every day, So, of our coachman I may say, He shows his drunken fiery face, Just as the sun does, more or less. Brisk. He! egad, so I did: \u2014 my lord can sing it. Cyn. O, good my lord, let's hear it. Brisk. 'Tis not a song neither ; \u2014 it's a sort of an epigram, or rather an epigrammatic sonnet ; I don't know what to call it, but it's satire. \u2014 Sing it, my lord. Brisk. That's right, all's well, all's well ! \u2014 More or less. Lady Froth. [Reads.] And when at night his labour's done, Then too, like heaven's charioteer the sun \u2014 Ay, charioteer does better. Into the dairy he descends, And there his whipping and his driving ends; There he's secure from danger of a bilk, His fare is paid him, and he sets in milk. For Susan, you know, is Thetis, and so \u2014 Brisk. Incomparably well and proper, egad ! \u2014 But I have one exception to make : \u2014 don't you Lord Froth sings. Ancient Phillis has young graces. 'Tis a strange thing, but a true one ; Shall 1 tell you how ? She herself makes her own faces, And each morning wears a new one ; Where's the wonder now ? Brisk.

Cyn. I'll wait upon your ladyship. Brisk. Pray, madam, how old is lady Sappho ? Lady Froth. Three quarters ; but I swear she has a world of wit, and can sing a tune already. 'Tis not so hard to counterfeit joy in the depth of affliction, as to dissemble mirth in company of fools. \u2014 Why should I call 'em fools? the world thinks better of 'em ; for these have quality and education, wit and fine conversation are received and admired by the world : \u2014 if not, they like and admire themselves. \u2014 And why is not that true wisdom, for 'tis happiness ? and for aught I know, we have misapplied the name all this while, and mistaken the thing ; since \u2014 If happiness in self-content is placed, The wise are wretched,and fools only bless'd.

Here, then, I give you my promise, in spite of duty, any temptation of wealth, your inconstancy, or my own inclination to change \u2014 Mel. To run most wilfully and unreasonably away with me this moment, and be married. Cyn. Hold ! \u2014 never to marry anybody else. Mel. That's but a kind of negative consent. \u2014 Why, you won't balk the frolic ? Cyn. If you had not been so assured of your own conduct I would not ; \u2014 but 'tis but reasonable that since I consent to like a man without the vile consideration of money, he should give me a very evident demonstration of his wit ; therefore let me see you undermine my lady Touchwood, as you boasted, and force her to give her consent, and then \u2014 Mellefont and Cynthia. Cyn. I heard him loud as I came by the closet door, and my lady with him, but she seemed to moderate his passion. Mel. Ay, hell thank her, as gentle breezes mo derate a fire : but I shall counterwork her spells, and ride the witch in her own bridle. Cyn. It's impossible ; she'll cast beyond you still.\u2014 I'll lay my life it will never come to be a match. Mel. What? Cyn. Between you and me. Mel. Why so ? Cyn. My mind gives me it won't \u2014 because we are both willing ; we each of us strive to reach the goal, and hinder one another in the race ; I swear it never does well when the parties are so agreed. \u2014 For when people walk hand in hand, there's nei ther overtaking nor meeting : we hunt in couples, where we both pursue the same game, but forget one another ; and 'tis because we are so near that we don't think of coming together. Mel. I'll do't. Cyn. And I'll do't. Mel. This very next ensuing hour of eight o'clock is the last minute of her reign, unless the devil assist her in propria persona. Cyn. Well, if the devil should assist her, and your plot miscarry ? Mel. Ay, what am I to trust to then? Cyn. Why, if you give me very clear demon stration that it was the devil, I'll allow for irre sistible odds. But if I find it to be only chance, or destiny, or unlucky stars, or anything but the very devil, I am inexorable ; only still I'll keep my word, and live a maid for your sake. Mel. And you won't die one for your own ; so still there's hope. Cyn. Here's my mother-in-law, and your friend Careless ; I would not have 'em see us together yet. Mel. Hum, 'gad I believe there's something in't ; \u2014 marriage is the game that we hunt, and while we think that we only have it in view, I don't see but we have it in our power. Cyn. Within reach ; for example, give me your hand ; you have looked through the wrong end of the perspective all this while ; for nothing has been between us but our fears. Mel. I don't know why we should not steal out of the house this very moment, and marry one another, without consideration, or the fear of repentance. Pox o' fortune, portion, settlements, and jointures !

I would obey you to my power, sir ; but if I have not him, I have sworn never to marry. Sir Paul. Never to marry ! Heavens forbid ! must I neither have sons nor grandsons ? must the family of the Plyants be utterly extinct for want of issue male ? Oh, impiety ! But did you swear ? did that sweet creature swear ? ha ! how durst you swear without my consent ; ah, gadsbud, who am I ? Cyn. Pray, don't be angry, sir : when I swore, I had your consent ; and therefore I swore. Sir Paul. WThy, then, the revoking my consent does annul, or make of non-effect, your oath ; so you may unswear it again ; \u2014 the law will allow it. Cyn. Ay, but my conscience never will. Sir Paul. Gadsbud, no matter for that, con science and law never go together, you must not expect that. Lady Ply. Ay, but sir Paul, I conceive if she has sworn, d'ye mark me, if she has once sworn, it is most unchristian, inhuman, and obscene, that she should break it. \u2014 [Aside.] I'll make up the match again, because Mr. Careless said it would oblige him. Sir Paul. Does your ladyship conceive so ? W7hy, I was of that opinion once too. \u2014 Nay, if your ladyship conceive so, I'm of that opinion again ; but I can neither find my lord nor my lady, to know what they intend. Lady Ply. I'm satisfied that my cousin Melle font has been much wronged. Cyn. [Aside] I'm amazed to find her of our side, for I'm sure she loved him. your eyes, While at your feet your poor adorer dies. Lady Ply. Ah, very fine ! Care. [Still whining.] Ah I why are you so fair, so bewitching fair ? O let me grow to the ground here, and feast upon that hand ! O let me press it to my heart, my trembling heart ! the nimble movement shall instruct your pulse, and teach it to alarm desire. \u2014 [Aside.] Zoons ! I'm almost at the end of my cant if she does not yield quickly. Lady Ply. O that's so passionate and fine I cannot hear it :\u2014 I am not safe if I stay, and must leave you. Care. And must you leave me ! rather let me languish out a wretched life, and breathe my soul beneath your feet ! \u2014 [Aside.] I must say the same thing over again, and can't help it. Lady Ply.

I can't outlive this night without your favour ! \u2014 I feel my spirits faint, a general dampness overspreads my face, a cold deadly dew already vents through all my.pores, and will to-morrow wash me for ever from your sight, and drown me in my tomb. Lady Ply. I know my lady Touchwood has no kindness for him ; and besides I have been informed by Mr. Careless, that Mellefont had never any thing more than a profound respect. \u2014 That he has owned himself to be my admirer, 'tis true ; but he was never so presumptuous to entertain any dis honourable notions of things ; so that if this be made plain, I don't see how my daughter can in conscience or honour, or anything in the world \u2014 Sir Paul.

Care. That was unlucky. Lady Ply. O yonder he comes reading of it! for heaven's sake step in here and advise me quickly before he sees ! Brisk. O barbarous, to turn me into ridicule ! Yet, ha! ha! ha! \u2014 the deuse take me, I can't help laughing myself, ha '. ha ! ha ! \u2014 yet by hea vens ! I have a violent passion for your ladyship, seriously. Lady Froth.

O providence ! what a conspiracy have I discovered !\u2014 But let me see to make an"], [286, "THE DOUBLE-DEALEli. 192 ACT IV, end on't\u2014 [Reads.] Hum\u2014 After supper in the wardrobe by the gallery, if sir Paul should sur prise us, I have a commission from him to treat with you about the very matter of fact. Matter of fact ! very pretty ; it seems then I am conducing to my own cuckoldom ; why this is the very trai torous position of taking up arms by my authority, against my person. Well, let me see \u2014 Till thenl languish in expectation of my adored charmer.\u2014 Dying Ned Careless. Gadsbud, would that were matter of fact too ! Die and be damned ! for a Judas Maccabeus, and Iscariot both ! O friendship ! what art thou but a name ! Hence forward let no man make a friend that would not be a cuckold ! for whomsoever he receives into his bosom, will find the way to his bed, and there return his caresses with interest to his wife. Have I for this been pinioned night after night for three years nast ? have 1 been swathed in blankets till I have been even deprived of motion ? have I ap proached the marriage-bed with reverence as to a sacred shrine, and denied myself the enjoyment of lawful domestic pleasures to preserve its purity, and must I now find it polluted by foreign iniquity ? O my lady Plyant, you were chaste as ice, but you are melted now, and false as water ! \u2014 But Provi dence has been constant to me in discovering this conspiracy ; still I am beholden to Providence ; if it were not for Providence, sure, poor sir Paul, thy heart would break. Sir Paul. Why now, as I hope to be saved, I had no hand in this letter .\u2014Nay hear me, I beseech your ladyship : the devil take me now if he did not go beyond my commission. \u2014 If I desired him to do any more than speak a good word only just for me ; gadsbud, only for poor sir Paul, I'm an anabaptist, or a Jew, or what you please to call me. Lady Ply. Why, is not here matter of fact ? Sir Paul. Ay, but, by your own virtue and con tinency, that matter of fact is all his own doing I confess I had a great desire to have some honours conferred upon me, which lie all in your ladyship's breast, and he being a well-spoken man, I desired him to intercede for me. Lady Ply. Did you so, presumption ! \u2014 Oh, he comes ! the Tarquin comes ! I cannot bear his sight. \u25a0 \u2014 * \u2014 SCENE XL Careless and Sir Paul. Care. Sir Paul, I'm glad I've met with you : 'gad I have said all I could, but can't prevail. \u2014 Then my friendship to you has carried me a little farther in this matter \u2014 Sir Paul. Indeed !\u2014 Well, sir.\u2014 [Aside.] I'll dissemble with him a little. Care. Why, faith, I have in my time known honest gentlemen abused by a pretended coyness in their wives, and I had a mind to try my lady's virtue : \u2014 and when I could not prevail for you, 'gad I pretended to be in love myself. \u2014 But all in vain ; she would not hear a word upon that subject ; then I writ a letter to her ; I don't know what effects that will have, but I'll be sure to tell you when I do ; though, by this light, I believe her virtue is impregnable. Sir Paul. O Providence! Providence! what dis coveries are here made ? why, this is better and more miraculous than the rest. SCENE X. Sir Paul and Lady Plyant. Lady Ply. So, sir, I see you have read the letter. \u2014 Well now, sir Paul, what do you think of your friend Careless ? has he been treacherous, or did you give his insolence a licence to make trial of jwiir wife's suspected virtue ? D'ye see here ? [Snatches the letter as in anger.] Look, read it ? Gads my life, if I thought it were so, I would this moment renounce all communication with you ! Ungrateful monster ! he? is it so ? ay, I see it, a plot upon my honour; your guilty cheeks confess it. Oh where shall wronged virtue fly for repara tion ! I'll be divorced this instant ! Care. What do you mean ? Sir Paul. I can't tell you, I'm so overjoyed; come along with me to my lady, I can't contain myself; come, my dear friend. Care. So, so, so, this difficulty's over. [Aside. Sir Paul. Gadsbud ! what shall I say ? this is the strangest surprise ! Why I don't know any thing at all, nor I don't know whether there be anything at all in the world or no. Lady Ply. I thought I should try you, false man ! I that never dissembled in my life, yet to make trial of you, pretended to like that monster of iniquity, Careless, and found out that contriv ance to let you see this letter ; which now 1 find was of your own inditing ;\u2014 I do, heathen, I do !\u2014 See my face no more, I'll be divorced presently ! f Sir Paul. O strange, what will become of me '.\u2014 I'm so amazed, and so overjoyed, so afraid, and so sorry \u2014 But did you give me this letter on purpose, he ? did you ? v Lady Ply. Did I ! do you doubt me, Turk, Saracen ? I have a cousin that's a proctor in the Commons, I'll go to him instantly. Sir Paul. Hold ! stay ! I beseech your lady ship ! I'm so overjoyed, stay, I'll confess all. tody Ply. What will yon confess, Jew ? \u2014 * \u2014 SCENE XII. Mellefont, Maskwell, from different doors. Mel. Maskwell ! I have been looking for you \u2014 'tis within a quarter of eight. Mask. My lady is just gone into my lord's closet, you had best steal into her chamber before she comes, and lie concealed there, otherwise she may lock the door when we are together, and you not easily get in to surprise us. Mel. He ! you say true. Mask. You had best make haste ; for after she has made some apology to the company for her own and my lord's absence all this while, she'll retire to her chamber instantly. Mel. I go this moment. Now Fortune, I defy thee !"], [287, "THE DOUBLE-DEALER. SCENE XVII. 193 Lord Touch. I thank you. What is the villain's SCENE XIII purpose ? Mask. He has owned nothing to me of late, and what I mean now is only a bare suspicion of my own. If your lordship will meet me a quarter of an hour hence there, in that lobby by my lady's bed chamber, I shall be able to tell you more. Lord Touch. I will. Maskwell. I confess you may be allowed to be secure in your own opinion ; the appearance is very fair, but I have an after game to play that shall turn the ta bles ; and here comes the man that I must manage. Mask. My duty to your lordship makes me do a severe piece of justice. Lord Touch. I will be secret, and reward your honesty beyond your hopes. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE XIV. Maskwell and Lord Touchwood. SCENE XV. \u2014 Lady Touchwood's Chamber. Lord Touch. Maskwell, you are the man I wished to meet. Mellefont. Mask. I am happy to be in the way of your lordship's commands. Lord Touch. I have always found you prudent and careful in anything that has concerned me or my family. Mask. I were a villain else ! \u2014 I am bound by duty and gratitude, and my own inclination, to be ever your lordship's servant. / ord Touch. Enough \u2014 you are my friend ; I know it. Yet there has been a thing in your knowledge which has concerned me nearly, that you have concealed from me. Mask. My lord ! Lord Touch. Nay, I excuse your friendship to my unnatural nephew thus far ; \u2014 but I know you have been privy to his impious designs upon my wife. This evening she has told me all ; her good nature concealed it as long as was possible ; but he perseveres so in villany that she has told me even you were weary of dissuading him, though you have once actually hindered him from forcing her. Mask. I am sorry, my lord, I can't make you an answer ; this is an occasion in which I would willingly be silent. Pray heaven my aunt keep touch with her assigna tion ! \u2014 Oh that her lord were but sweating behind this hanging, with the expectation of what I shall see 1 \u2014 Hist ! she comes. \u2014 Little does she think what a mine is just ready to spring under her feet. But to my post. [Conceals himself behind the hangings. \u2666 \u2014 SCENE XVI. Lady Touchwood. 'Tis eight o'clock : methinks I should have found him here. Who does not prevent the hour of love outstays the time ; for to be dully punctual, is too slow. \u2014 [To Waskwell, entering.] I was accu ing you of neglect. SCENE XVII. Lady Touchwood and Maskwel: Mask. I confess you do reproach me when I see you here before me ; but 'tis fit I should be still behind-hand, still to be more and more indebted to your goodness. Lord Touch. I know you would excuse him ; and I know as well that you can't. Mask. Indeed I was in hopes 't had been a youthful heat that might have soon boiled over ; but\u2014 Lady Touch. You can excuse a fault too well, not to have been to blame. \u2014 A ready answer shows you were prepared. Mask. Guilt is ever at a loss, and confusion waits upon it ; when innocence and bold truth are always ready for expression \u2014 Lady Touch. Not in love ; words are the weak support of cold indifference ; love has no language to be heard. Lord Touch. Say on. Mask. I have nothing more to say, my lord \u2014 but to express my concern ; for I think his frenzy increases daily. Lord Touch. How ! give me but proof of it, ocular proof, that I may justify my dealing with him to the world, and share my fortunes. Mask. O my lord ! consider that is hard ; be sides, time may work upon him : then, for me to do it ! I have professed an everlasting friendship to him. Mask. Excess of joy has made me stupid ! Thus may my lips be ever closed. \u2014 [Kisses her.] And thus \u2014 Oh, who would not lose his speech, upon condition to have joys above it ? Lady Touch. Hold, let me lock the door first. [Goes to the door. Lord Touch. He is your friend, and what am I ? Mask. I am answered. Lord Touch. Fear not his displeasure ; I will put you out of his and Fortune's power ; and for that thou art scrupulously honest, I will secure thy fidelity to him, and give my honour never to own any discovery that you shall make me. Can you give me a demonstrative proof ? speak. Mask. I wish I could not ! \u2014 To be plain, my lord, I intended this evening to have tried all ar guments to dissuade him from a design which I suspect ; and if I had not succeeded, to have in formed your lordship of what I knew. Mask. [Aside.] That I believed; 'twas well I left the private passage open. Lady Touch. So, that's safe. Mask. And so may all your pleasures be, and secret as this kiss. Mel. [Leaping out.] And may all treachery be thus discovered I Lady Touch. Ah ! [Shrieks. Mel. Villain ! [Qfers to draw. Mask. Nay, then, there's but one way.

O madam, have a care of dying unprepared. I doubt you have some unrepented sins that may hang heavy, and retard your flight. Lady Touch. Oh, what shall I do ? say ? whither shall I turn ? Has hell no remedy ? Mel. None, hell has served you even as heaven has done, left you to yourself. \u2014 You're in a kind of Erasmus' paradise ; yet, if you please, you may make it a purgatory ; and with a little penance and my absolution, all this may turn to good account.

My lord, you hear him, he talks idly. Lord Touch. Hence from my sight, thou living infamy to my name ! when next I see that face I'll write villain in't with my sword's point. Mel. Now, by my soul, I will not go till I have made known my wrongs ! \u2014 nay, till I have made known yours, which (if possible) are greater \u2014 though she has all the host of hell her ser vants. Lady Touch. O the scene was shifted quick be fore me ! \u2014 I had not time to think \u2014 Iwas surprised to see a monster in the glass, and now I find 'tis myself. Can you have mercy to forgive the faults I have imagined, but never put in practice ? \u2014 O con sider, consider how fatal you have been to me ! you have already killed the quiet of this life. The love of you was the first wandering fire that e'er misled my steps, and while I had only that in view, I was betrayed into un thought- of ways of ruin. Mel. May I believe this true ? Lady Touch. O be not cruelly incredulous ! \u2014 How can you doubt these streaming eyes ? Keep the severest eye o'er all my future conduct ; and if I once relapse, let me not hope forgiveness, 'twill ever be in your power to ruin me. \u2014 My lord shall sign to your desires ; I will myself create your happiness, and Cynthia shall be this night your bride.\u2014 Do but conceal my failings, and forgive.

For heaven's sake, away, my lord ! he'll either tempt you to extravagance, or commit some him self. Mel. Death and furies ! will you not hear me ? Why by heaven she laughs, grins, points to your back ! she forks out cuckoldom with her fingers, and you're running horn-mad after your fortune !

Let me perish first, and from this hour avoid all sight and speech, and, if I can, all thought of that pernicious beauty. Ha ! but what is my distraction doing !

By heaven, 1 believe you can control her power ! and she fears it ; though chance brought my lord, 'twas your own art that turned it to advantage. Lady Touch. 'Tis true, it might have been my ruin \u2014 But yonder's my lord, I believe he's coming to find you. I'll not be seen. SCENE II. Maskwell. So ; I durst not own my introducing my lord, though it succeeded well for her, for she would have suspected a design which I should have been puz zled to excuse. My lord is thoughtful \u2014 I'll be so too ; yet he shall know my thoughts ; or think he does. Lord Touch. No more \u2014 I have resolved. \u2014 The writings are ready drawn, and wanted nothing but to be signed, and have his name inserted : \u2014 yours will fill the blank as well. \u2014 I will have no reply. \u2014 Let me command this time ; for 'tis the last in which I will assume authority \u2014 hereafter you shall rule where I have power.

Then, witness heaven for me, this wealth and honour was not of my seeking, nor would I build my fortune on another's ruin : I had but one desire \u2014 SCENE III. Maskwell and Lord Touchwood. Mask. What have I done ? Lord Touch. Talking to himself ! [Aside. Mask. 'Twas honest \u2014 and shall I be rewarded for it ! No, 'twas honest, therefore I shan't. \u2014 Nay, rather therefore I ought not ; for it rewards itself. Lord Touch. Unequalled virtue ! [Aside. Mask. But should it be known ! then I have lost a friend. He was an ill-man, and I have gained : for half myself I lent him, and that I have recalled ; so I have served myself, and what is yet better, I have served a worthy lord, to whom I owe myself. Lord Touch. Excellent man ! [Aside. Lord Touch. Thou shalt enjoy it. \u2014 If all I'm worth in wealth or interest can purchase Cynthia, she is thine. \u2014 I'm sure sir Paul's consent will fol low fortune ; I'll quickly show him which way that is going.

Her fury would spare no thing, though she involved herself in ruin. No, it must be by stratagem \u2014 I must deceive Mellefont once more, and get my lord to consent to my pri vate management.

Oh ! what woman can bear to be a property ? To be kindled to a flame, only to light him to another's arms ! Oh, that I were fire indeed, that I might burn the vile traitor ! What shall I do ? how shall 1 think ? I cannot think. \u2014 All my designs are lost, my love unsated, my revenge unfinished, and fresh cause of fury from unthought-of plagues.

Lady Touch. Oh, torture ! [Aside. Sir Paul. Gadsbud, I can't find her high nor low ; where can she be, think you ? Lady Touch. Where she's serving you, as all your sex ought to be served ; making you a beast. Don't you know that you're a fool, brother ? Sir Paul. A fool ! he ! he ! he ! you're merry. \u2014 No, no, not I, I know no such matter. Lady Touch. Why, then, you don't know half your happiness. Sir Paul. That's a jest with all my heart, faith and troth ! \u2014 But hark ye, my lord told me some thing of a revolution of things ; I don't know what to make on't. \u2014 Gadsbud, I must consult my wife. \u2014 He talks of disinheriting his nephew, and I don't know what. \u2014 Look you, sister, I must know what my girl has to trust to ; or not a syllable of a wed ding, gadsbud \u2014 to show you that 1 am not a fool. Lady Touch. Hear me ; consent to the breaking off this marriage, and the promoting any other, without consulting me, and I'll renounce all blood, all relation and concern with you for ever ; \u2014 nay, I'll be your enemy, and pursue you to destruction; I'll tear your eyes out, and tread you under my feet. Mask. Little do you think that your aunt has kept her word ! \u2014 How the devil she wrought my lord into this dotage, I know not ; but he's gone to sir Paul about my marriage with Cynthia, and has appointed me his heir. Mel. The devil he has ! What's to be done ? Mask. I have it ! \u2014 it must be by stratagem ; for it's in vain to make application to him. I think I have that in my head that cannot fail. \u2014 Where's Cynthia ? Mel. In the garden. Mask. Let us go and consult her : my life for yours, I cheat my lord ! SCENE VI.

But this is a thing of too great moment to be so suddenly resolved. Why Cynthia? why must he be married ? Is there not reward enough in raising his low fortune, but he must mix his blood with mine, and wed my niece ?

Why, qui vult decipi decipiatur. \u2014 'Tis no fault of mine : I have told 'era, in plain terms, how easy 'tis for me to cheat 'em ; and, if they will not hear the serpent's hiss, they must be stung into experience, and future caution. \u2014 Now to prepare my lord to consent to this. \u2014 But first I must instruct my little Levite ; there is no plot, public or private, that can expect to prosper without ore of them has a finger in't : he promised me to be within at this hour. \u2014 Mr. Saygrace ! Mr. Saygrace ! [Goes to the chamber zioor, and knocks. Mask. Why, I intend to tell my lord the whole matter of our contrivance, that's my way. Mel. I don't understand you. Mask. Why. I'll tell my lord I laid this plot with you on purpose to betray you ; and that which put me upon it was the finding it impossible to gain the lady any other way, but in the hopes of her marrying you. Mel. So\u2014 * \u2014 SCENE XII. Maskwell and Saygrace. Say. [Looking out.] Sweet sir, I will but pen the last line of an acrostic, and be with you in the twinkling of an ejaculation, in the pronouncing of an amen, or before you can \u2014 Mask. Nay, good Mr. Saygrace, do not prolong the time, by describing to me the shortness of your stay ; rather, if you please, defer the finishing of your wit, and let us talk about our business : it shall be tithes in your way. Say. [Enters.] Y7ou shall prevail; I would break off in the middle of a sermon to do you a pleasure. Mask. You could not do me a greater, \u2014 except \u2014 the business in hand. \u2014 Have you provided a habit for Mellefont ? Mash. So, why so, while you're busied in mak ing yourself ready, I'll wheedle her into the coach ; and instead of you: borrow my lord's chaplain, and so run away with her myself. Mel. O, I conceive you ; you'll tell him so ? Mask. Tell him so I ay ; why, you don't think I mean to do so ? Mel. No, no ; ha ! ha ! I dare swear thou wilt not. Mask. Therefore, for our farther security, I would have you disguised like a parson, that if my lord should have curiosity to peep, he may not discover you in the coach, but think the cheat is carried on as he would have it. Mel. Excellent Maskwell ! thou wert certainly meant for a statesman or a Jesuit \u2014 but that thou art too honest for one. and too pious for the other. Mask. Well, get yourselves ready, and meet me in half an hour, yonder in my lady's dressing-room : go by the back stairs, and so we may slip down without being observed.\u2014 I'll send the chaplain to you with his robes ; I have made him my own, and ordered him to meet us to-morrow morning at St. Alhan's ; there we will sum up this account, to all our satisfactions. Say. I have ; they are ready in my chamber, toge ther with a clean starched band and cuffs. Mask. Good, let them be carried to him. \u2014 Have you stitched the gown sleeve, that he may be puz zled, and waste time in putting it on ? Say. I have ; the gown will not be indued without perplexity. Mask. Meet me in half an hour here in your own chamber. When Cynthia comes let there be no light, and do not speak, that she may not dis tinguish you from Mellefont. I'll urge haste to excuse your silence. Say. You have no more commands ? Mask. None ; your text is short. Say. But pithy, and I will handle it with discre tion. lEx't- Mel.

Sure I was born to be controlled by those I should command : my very slaves will shortly give me rules how I shall govern them. Mask. I am concerned to see your lordship dis composed. Mel. 'Tis loss of time \u2014 I cannot think him false. Lord Touch. Have you seen my wife lately, or disobliged her ? Mask. No, my lord. \u2014 [Aside] What can this mean ? SCENE XVI. Lord Touch. Then Mellefont has urged some body to incense her. \u2014 Something she has heard of you which carries her beyond the bounds of patience. Cynthia and Lord Touchwood. Cyn. My lord musing !

How's this ! now I fear indeed. [Aside. Lord Touch. Cynthia here ! \u2014 Alone, fair cousin, and melancholy ? Cyn. Your lordship was thoughtful. Lord Touch. My thoughts were on serious business, not worth your hearing. Cyn. Mine were on treachery concerning you, and may be worth your hearing. Lord Touch. Treachery concerning me ! pray be plain. \u2014 Hark ! what noise ! Mask. [It'ithin] Will you not hear me ? Lady Touch. [Within.] No, monster ! traitor ! no. Mask. [Aside.] This I feared.\u2014 [Aloud.] Did not your lordship tell her of the honours you de signed me ? Lord Touch. Y'es. Mask. 'Tis that ; you know my lady has a high spirit, she thinks I am unworthy. Lord Touch. Unworthy ! 'tis an ignorant pride in her to think so : \u2014 honesty to me is true nobility. However, 'tis my will it shall be so, and that should be convincing to her as much as reason. \u2014 By heaven, I'll not be wife-ridden! were it possible, it should be done this night. Mask. [Aside.] By heaven he meets my wishes ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Few things are impossible to willing minds. Lord Touch. Instruct me how this may be done, you shall see I want no inclination. Mask. I had laid a small design for to-morrow (as love will be inventing) which I thought to com municate to your lordship ; but it may be as well done to-night. Lord Touch. Here's company. \u2014 Come this way, and tell me. Cyn. [Aside.] My lady and Maskwell 1 this may be lucky. \u2014 [Aloud.] My lord, let me entreat you to stand behind this screen, and listen ; per haps this chance may give you proof of what you ne'er could have believed from my suspicions.

You want but leisure to invent fresh falsehood, and soothe me to a fond belief of all your fictions ; but I will stab the lie that's forming in your heart, and save a sin, in pity to your soul. Mask. Strike then !\u2014 since you will have it so. Lady Touch. Ha ! A steady villain to the last ! Mask. Come, why do you dally with me thus ? Lady Touch. Thy stubborn temper shocks me, and you knew it would. \u2014 This is cunning all, and not courage ; no, I know thee well : but thou shalt miss thy aim. Mask. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Care. Is not that he now gone out with my lord? Cyn. Yes. Care. By heaven, there's treachery ! \u2014 The con fusion that I saw your father in, my lady Touch wood's passion, with what imperfectly I overheard between my lord and her, confirm me in my fears. Where's Mellefont ? Cyn. Here he comes. SCENE XV. Lady Touch. Ha ! do you mock my rage ? then this shall punish your fond, rash contempt! \u2014 [Goes to strike.] \u2014 Again smile ! \u2014 and such a smile as speaks in ambiguity ! \u2014 Ten thousand meanings lurk in each corner of that various face.

No ; my dear, will you get ready ? \u2014 the things are all in my chamber ; I want nothing but the habit. Care. You are betrayed, and Maskwell is the villain I always thought him. Cyn.

My lord, have patience, and be sensible how great our happiness is that this discovery was not made too late. Lady Touch. My lord himself surprised me with the news you were to marry Cynthia : \u2014 that you had owned your love to him, and his indul gence would assist you to attain your ends. Cyn. [Aside to Lord Touchwood.] How, my lord! Lord Touch. [Aside to Cynthia.] Pray forbear all resentments for a while, and let us hear the rest. Lord Touch. I thank you, yet it may be still too late, if we don't presently prevent the execu tion of their plots. \u2014 Ha, I'll do't. Where's Mellefont, my poor injured nephew ? \u2014 How shall I make him ample satisfaction ? \u2014 Cyn. I dare answer for him. Lord Touch. I do him fresh wrong to question his forgiveness ; for I know him to be all goodness. \u2014 Yet my wife ! damn her ! \u2014 She'll think to meet him in that dressing-room; \u2014 was't not so? and Maskwell will expect you in the chaplain's cham ber. \u2014 For once, I'll add my plot too. \u2014 Let us haste to find out, and inform my nephew ; and do you quickly as you can bring all the company into this gallery. \u2014 I'll expose the strumpet and the villain. Mask. I grant you in appearance all is true ; I seemed consenting to my lord ; nay, transported with the blessing. \u2014 But could you think that I, who had been happy in your loved embraces, could e'er be fond of an inferior slavery. Lord Touch. [Aside.] Ha! O poison to my ears ! what do I hear ! Cyn. Nay, good my lord, forbear resentment, let us hear it out. Lord Touch. Yes, I will contain, though I could burst. Mask. I that had wantoned in the rich circle of your world of love, could I be confined within the puny province of a girl ! No \u2014 yet though I dote on each last favour more than all the rest ; though I would give a limb for every look you cheaply throw away on any other object of your love ; yet so far I prize your pleasures o'er my own, that all this seeming plot that I have laid has been to gratify your taste, and cheat the world, to prove a faithful rogue to you. Lady Touch. If this were true ! \u2014 but how can it be? SCENE XX. Lord Froth and Sir Paul. Lord Froth. By heavens, I have slept an age ! \u2014 Sir Paul, what o'clock is't ? Past eight, on my conscience ! my lady's is the most inviting couch; and a slumber there is the prettiest amusement ! But where's all the company ? \u2014 Sir Paul. The company, gadsbud, I don't know, my lord, but here's the strangest revolution, all turned topsy-turvy ; as I hope for Provi dence. Mask. I have so contrived that Mellefont will presently, in the chaplain's habit, wait for Cynthia in your dressing-room : but I have put the change upon her that she may be otherwhere employed. \u2014 Do you procure her night-gown, and, with your hoods tied over your face, meet him in her stead ; you may go privately by the back stairs, and, un perceived, there you may propose to reinstate him in his uncle's favour, if he'll comply with your desires ; his case is desperate, and I believe he'll yield to any conditions. \u2014 If not, here take this ; you may employ it better than in the heart of one who is nothing when not yours. [Gives the dagger. Lady Touch. Thou canst deceive everybody, \u2014 nay, thou hast deceived me ; but 'tis as I would wish. \u2014 Trusty villain I I could worship thee ! Mask. No more. \u2014 There wants but a few minutes of the time ; and Mellefont's love will carry him there before his hour. Lord Froth. O heavens, what's the matter? where's my wife ? Sir Paul.

Could poets but foresee how plays would take, Then they could tell what epilogues to make ; Whether to thank or blame their audience most : But that late knowledge does much hazard cost : 'Till dice are thrown, there's nothing won nor lost- So, till the thief has stolen, he cannot know Whether he shall escape the law or no. But poets run much greater hazards far, Than they who stand their trials at the bar, The law provides a curb for its own fury, And suffers judges to direct the jury : But in this court, what difference does appear ! For every one's both judge and jury here ; Nay, and what's worse, an executioner. All have a right and title to some part, Each choosing that in which he has most art. The dreadful men of learning all confound, Unless the fable's good, and moral sound. The vizor-masks that are in pit and gallery, Approve or damn the repartee and raillery. The lady critics, who are better read, Inquire if characters are nicely bred ; If the soft things are penn'd and spoke with grace : They judge of action, too, and time, and place ; In which we do not doubt but they're discerning, For that's a kind of assignation teaming. Beaux judge of dress ; the witlings judge of songs ; The cuckoldom, of ancient right, to cits belongs. Poor poets thus the favour are denied Even to make exceptions, when they're tried.

My Lord, \u2014 A young poet is liable to the same vanity and indiscretion with a young lover ; and the great man who smiles upon one, and the fine woman who looks kindly upon t'other, are both of them in danger of having the favour published with the first opportunity. But there may be a different motive, which will a little distinguish the offenders. For though one should have a vanity in ruining another's reputation, yet the other may only have an ambition to advance his own. And I beg leave, my Lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the cause and excuse of this dedication. \"Whoever is king, is also the father of his country ; and as nobody can dispute your Lordship's monarchy in poetry ; so all that are concerned ought to acknowledge your universal patronage ; and it is only presuming on the privilege of a loyal subject, that I have ventured to make this my address of thanks to your Lordship ; which, at the same time, includes a prayer for your protection. I am not ignorant of the common form of poetical dedications, which are generally made up of panegyrics, where the authors endeavour to distinguish their patrons by the shining characters they give them above other men. But that, my Lord, is not my business at this time, nor is your Lordship now to be distinguished. I am contented with the honour I do myself in this epistle, without the vanity of attempting to add to or explain your Lordship's character. I confess it is not without some struggling that I behave myself in this case as I ought ; for it is very hard to be pleased with a subject, and yet forbear it. But I choose rather to follow Pliny's precept, than his example, when in his panegyrie to the Emperor Trajan he says \u2014 ,( Nee minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati possint, quam quid virtutibus debeatur.\" I hope I may be excused the pedantry of a quotation, when it is so justly applied. Here are some lines in the print (and which your Lordship read before this play was acted) that were omitted on the stage, and particularly one whole scene in the third Act, which not only helps the design forward with less precipitation, but also heightens the ridiculous character of Foresight, which indeed seems to be maimed without it. But I found myself in great danger of a long play, and was glad to help it where I could. Though notwithstanding my care, and the kind reception it had from the town, I could heartily wish it yet shorter ; but the number of different characters represented in it would have been too much crowded in less room. This reflection on prolixity fa fault for which scarce any one beauty will atone) warns me not to be tedious now, and detain your Lordship any longer with the trifles of, my Lord, your Lordship's most obedient, and most humble servant, WILL.

The husbandman in vain renews his toil, To cultivate each year a hungry soil ; And fondly hopes for rich and generous fruit, When what should feed the tree devours the root ; The unladen boughs, he sees, bode certain dearth, Unless transplanted to more kindly earth. So, the poor husbands of the stage, who found Their labours lost upon ungrateful ground, This last and only remedy have proved ; And hope new fruit from ancient stocks removed. Well may they hope, when you so kindly aid, Well plant a soil which you so rich have made. As Nature gave the world to man's first age, So from your bounty we receive this stage ; The freedom man was born to you've restored, And to our world such plenty you afford, Tt seems like Eden, fruitful of its own accord. But since in Paradise frail flesh gave way, And when but two were made, both went astray ; Forbear your wonder and the fault forgive, If in our larger family we grieve One falling Adam, and one tempted Eve. We who remain would gratefully repay What our endeavours can, and bring, this day, The first-fruit offering of a virgin play. We hope there's something that may please each taste, And though of homely fare we make the feast, Yet you will find variety at least. There's humour, which for cheerful friends we got, And for the thinking party there's a plot. We've something too, to gratify ill-na\u00c6ure, (If there be any here,) and that is satire ; Though satire scarce dares grin, 'tis grown so mild, Or only shows its teeth as if it smiled. As asses thistles, poets mumble wit, And dare not bite, for fear of being bit. They hold their pens, as swords are held by fools, And are afraid to use their own edge-tools. Since the Plain Dealer's scenes of manly rage, Not one has dared to lash this crying age. This time the poet owns the bold essay, Yet hopes there's no ill-manners in his play : And he declares by me, he has design'd Affront to none, but frankly speaks his mind.

Why, sirrah, I have no money, you know it ; and therefore resolve to rail at all that have ; and in that I but follow the examples of the wisest and wittiest men in all ages ; these poets and philosophers whom you naturally hate, for just such another reason, because they abound in sense, and you are a fool.

Val. Well, and now I am poor I have an oppor tunity to be revenged on 'em all ; I'll pursue Angelica with more love than ever, and appear more notoriously her admirer in this restraint, than when I openly rivalled the rich fops that made court to her ; so shall my poverty be a mortification to her pride, and perhaps make her compassionate Jer.

Why, he looks like a writ of inquiry into their titles and estates ; and seems commissioned by heaven to seize the better half. Jer. Now heaven, of mercy, continue the tax upon paper 1 you don't mean to write ! Val. Yes, I do ; I'll write a play. Jer. Hem ! \u2014 Sir, if you please to give me a small certificate of three lines ; \u2014 only to certify those whom it may concern, that the bearer hereof, Jeremy Fetch by name, has for the space of seven years, truly and faithfully served Valentine Legend, Esq. ; and that he is not now turned away for any misdemeanour, but does voluntarily dismiss his master from any future authority over him. Val. No, sirrah, you shall live with me still. Jer. Sir, it's impossible : \u2014 I may die with you, starve with you, or be damned with your works ; but to live, even three days, the life of a play, I no more expect it, than to be canonised for a Muse after my decease. Val. You are witty, you rogue ! I shall want your help ; I'll have you learn to make couplets, to tag the ends of acts ; d'ye hear, get the maids to crambo in an evening, and learn the knack of rhyming : you may arrive at the height of a song sent by an unknown hand, or a chocolate-house lampoon. Jer. But, sir, is this the way to recover your father's favour ? why, sir Sampson will be irrecon cilable. If your younger brother should come from sea, he'd never look upon you again. You're undone, sir, you're ruined, you won't have a friend left in the world if you turn poet Ah, pox confound that Will's Coffee-house ! it has ruined more young men than the Royal Oak lottery ; \u2014 nothing thrives that belongs to't. The man of the house would have been an alderman by this time with half the trade, if he had set up in the city. For my part, I never sit at the door that I don't get double the stomach that I do at a horse-race : \u2014 the air upon Banstead downs is nothing to it for a whetter. Yet I never see it, but the spirit of famine appears to me, sometimes like a decayed porter, worn out with pimping, and carrying billets-doux and songs ; not like other porters forhire, but for the jest's sake : \u2014 now like a thin chairman, melted down to half his proportion with carrying a poet upon tick, to visit some great fortune, and his fare to be paid him, like the wages of sin, either at the day of marriage, or the day of death. Val. Very well, sir ; can you proceed ? Jer. Sometimes like a bilked bookseller, with a meagre terrified countenance, that looks as if he had written for himself, or were resolved to turn author, and bring the rest of his brethren into the same condition : \u2014 and lastly, in the form of a worn out punk, with verses in her hand, which her vanity had preferred to settlements, without a whole tatter to her tail, but as ragged as one of the Muses ; or as if she were carrying her linen to the paper-mill, to be converted into folio books, of warning to all young maids, not to prefer poetry to good sense, or lying in the arms of a needy wit, before the embraces of a wealthy fool. Val. Therefore I would rail in my writings, and be revenged. Scan. Rail ? at whom ? the whole world ? Im potent and vain ! who would die a martyr to sense in a country where the religion is folly ? you may stand at bay for a while ; but when the full cry is against you, you shan't have fair play for your life. If you can't be fairly run down by the hounds, you will be treacherously shot by the huntsmen. No, turn pimp, flatterer, quack, lawyer, parson, be chaplain to an atheist, or stallion to an old woman, anything but poet ; a modern poet is worse, more servile, timorous and fawning, than any I have named : without you could retrieve the ancient honours of the name, recal the stage of Athens, and be allowed the force of open, honest satire. Val. You are as inveterate against our poets as if your character had been lately exposed upon the stage. \u2014 Nay, I am not violently bent upon the trade. \u2014 [Knocking at the door.] Jeremy, see who's there. \u2014 [Exit Jeremy.] But tell me what you would have me do ? What does the world say of me, and my forced confinement ? Scan. The world behaves itself as it uses to do on such occasions ; some pity you and condemn your father ; others excuse him and blame you ; only the ladies are merciful, and wish you well ; since love and pleasurable expense have been your greatest faults. Re-enter Jeremy. Val. How now ? Jer. Nothing, new, sir ; I have despatched some half-a-dozen duns with as much dexterity as a hungry judge does causes at dinner time. Val. What answer have you given 'em ? Scan. Patience, I suppose ? the old receipt. Jer. No, faith, sir ; I have put 'em off so long with patience and forbearance, and other fair words, that I was forced now to tell 'em in plain down right English \u2014 Val. What? Jer. That they should be paid. Val. When? Jer. To-morrow."], [299, "LOVE FOR LOVE. SCENE V. 205 I Val. And how the devil do you mean to keep your word ? Jer. Keep it ! not at all ; it has been so very much stretched that I reckon it will break of course by to-morrow, and nobody be surprised at the matter. \u2014 [Knocking.] Again ! \u2014 Sir, if you don't like my negotiation, will you be pleased to answer these yourself ? Val. See who they are. Trap. A good morning to you, Mr. Valentine, and to you, Mr. Scandal. Scan. The morning's a very good morning, if you don't spoil it. Val. Come sit you down, you know his way. Trap. [Sits.] There is a debt, Mr. Valentine, of fifteen hundred pounds of pretty long standing \u2014 Val. I cannot talk about business with a thirsty palate \u2014 [ To Jeremy.] Sirrah, the sack. Trap. And I desire to know what course you have taken for the payment ? Val. Faith and troth, I am heartily glad to see you: \u2014 my service to you. [Drinks.] Fill, fill, to honest Mr. Trapland, fuller. Trap. Hold, sweetheart; \u2014 this is not to our busi ness. My service to you, Mr. Scandal. [Drinks.] I have forborne as long \u2014 Val. T'other glass, and then we'll talk. \u2014 Fill, Jeremy. Trap. No more, in truth. \u2014 I have forborne, I say \u2014 \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE III. Valentine and Scandal. Val. By this, Scandal, you may see what it is to be great ; secretaries of state, presidents of the council, and generals of an army, lead just such a life as 1 do ; have just such crowds of visitants in a morning, all soliciting of past promises ; which are but a civiler sort of duns, that lay claim to voluntary debts. Val. [ To Jeremy.] Sirrah, fill when I bid you. \u2014 [To Trafland.] And how does your handsome daughter ? Come, a good husband to her. [Drinks. Scan. And you, like a true great man, having engaged their attendance, and promised more than ever you intend to perform, are more perplexed to find evasions than you would be to invent the honest means of keeping your word, and gratifying your creditors. Val. Scandal, learn to spare your friends, and do not provoke your enemies : this liberty of your tongue will one day bring a confinement on your body, my friend. Trap. Thank you. \u2014 I have been out of this money \u2014 Val. Drink first.\u2014 Scandal, why do you not drink ? [They drink. Trap. And in short, I can be put off no longer. Val. I was much obliged to you for your supply : it did me signal service in my necessity. But you delight in doing good. \u2014 Scandal, drink to me my friend Trapland's health. An honester man lives not, nor one more ready to serve his friend in dis tress, though I say it to his face. Come, fill each man his glass. Scan. What, I know Trapland has been a whore master, and loves a wench still. You never knew a whoremaster that was not an honest fellow. SCENE IV. Valentine, Scandal, and Jeremy. Jer. O sir, there's Trapland the scrivener, with two suspicious fellows like lawful pads, that would knock a man down with pocket-tipstaves ; \u2014 and there's your father's steward, and the nurse with one of your children from Twitnam. Val. Pox on her ! could she find no other time to fling my sins in my face ? Here, give her this, [Gives money] and bid her trouble me no more ; \u25a0 \u2014 a thoughtless, two-handed whore ! she knows my condition well enough, and might have over laid the child a fortnight ago, if she had had any forecast in her. Trap. Fy, Mr. Scandal ! you never knew \u2014 Scan. What, don't I know ? \u2014 1 know the buxom black widow in the Poultry \u2014 eight hundred pounds a-year, jointure, and twenty thousand pounds in money. Aha, old Trap ! Val. Say you so, i'faith ? come, we'll remember the widow : I know whereabouts you are ; come, to the widow \u2014 Trap. No more, indeed. Val. What, the widow's health.- \u2014 [To Jeremy.] Give it him. \u2014 Off with it. [ They drink.] A lovely girl, i'faith, black sparkling eyes, soft pouting ruby lips ; better sealing there than a bond for a mil lion, ha ! Trap. No, no, there's no such thing, we'd better mind our business ; \u2014 you're a wag. Val. No, faith, we'll mind the widow's business ; fill again. \u2014 Pretty round Reaving breasts, a Barbary shape, and a jut with her bum would stir an anchorite, and the prettiest foot ! Oh, if a man could but fasten his eyes to her feet, as they steal in and out, and play at bo-peep under her petti coats ! ah, Mr. Trapland ? Trap. Verily, give me a glass \u2014 you're a wag \u2014 and here's to the widow. [Drinks. Scan. What, is it bouncing Margery with my godson ? Jer. Yes, sir. Scan. My blessing to the boy, with this token of my love. \u2014 [Gives money.] And, d'ye hear, bid Margery put more flocks in her bed, shift twice a-week, and not work so hard, that she may not smell so vigorously. I shall take the air shortly. Val. Scandal, don't spoil my boy's milk. \u2014 [To Jeremy.] Bid Trapland come in. [Exit Jeremy.] If I can give that Cerberus a sop, 1 shall be at rest for one day. SCENE V. Scan. [Aside to Valentine.] He begins to chuckle ; ply him close, or he'll relapse into a dun. Valentine, Scandal, Trapland, and Jeremy. Val. O Mr. Trapland, my old friend, welcome ! \u2014 Jeremy, a chair quickly ; a bottle of sack and a toast ; \u2014 fly \u2014 a chair first."], [300, "206 LOVE FOR LOVE. ACT I. Scan. A very desperate demonstration of your love to Angelica ; and I think she has never given you any assurance of hers. Val. You know her temper, she never gave me any great reason either for hope or despair. Scan. Women of her airy temper, as they seldom think before they act, so they rarely give us any light to guess at what they mean ; but you have little reason to believe that a woman of this age, who has had an indifference for you in your prosperitv, will fall in love with your ill-fortune\";- besides! Angelica has a great fortune of her own; and great fortunes either expect another great fortune, or a fool. SCENE VI. Valentine, Scandal, Jeremy, Trapland, and Snap. Snap. By your leave, gentlemen Mr. Trap land, if we must do our office, tell us : we have balf-a-dozen gentlemen to arrest in Pall-mall and Covent-garden ; and if we don't make haste, the chairmen will be abroad, and block up the choco late-houses, and then our labour's lost. Trap. Udso, that's true. \u2014 Mr. Valentine, I love mirth, but business must be done ; are you ready to \u2014 Jer. Sir, your father's steward says he comes to make proposals concerning your debts. Val. Bid him come in. \u2014 Mr. Trapland, send away your officer ; you shall have an answer pre sently. Trap. Mr. Snap, stay within call. \u2014 \u2022 \u2014 SCENE IX. Valentine, Scandal, and Jeremy. Jer. More misfortune's, sir. Val. What, another dun ? Jer. No, sir, but Mr. Tattle is come to wait SCENE VII. upon you. Valentine, Scandal, Trapland, Jeremy, and Steward, who whispers Valentine. Val. Well, I can't help it ; \u2014 you must bring him up ; he knows I don't go abroad. Scan. Here's a dog now, a traitor in his wine ; \u2014 sirrah, refund the sack. \u2014 Jeremy, fetch him some warm water, or I'll rip up his stomach, and go the shortest way to his conscience. Trap. Mr. Scandal, you are uncivil ; I did not value your sack ; but you cannot expect it again, when I have drunk it. SCENE X. Valentine and Scandal. Scan. Pox on him ! I'll be gone. Val. No, prithee stay: Tattle and you should never be asunder ; you are light and shadow, and show one another ; he is perfectly thy reverse both in humour and understanding; and, as you set up for defamation, he is a mender of reputa tions. Scan. And how do you expect to have your money again, when a gentleman has spent it ? Val. [ To Steward.] You need say no more, I understand the conditions, they are very hard, but my necessity is very pressing ; I agree to 'em. Take Mr. Trapland with you, and let him draw the writing. \u2014 Mr. Trapland, you know this man, he shall satisfy you. Trap. Sincerely, I am loath to be thus pressing, but my necessity \u2014 Val. No apology, good Mr. Scrivener, you shall be paid. Trap. I hope you forgive me, my business requires \u2014 Scan. A mender of reputations ! ay, just as he is a keeper of secrets, another virtue that he sets up for in the same manner. For the rogue will speak aloud in the posture of a whisper ; and deny a woman's name, while he gives you the marks of her person : he will forswear receiving a letter from her, and at the same time show you her hand in the superscription ; and yet perhaps he has counterfeited the hand too, and sworn to a truth ; but he hopes not to be believed; and refuses the reputation of a lady's favour, as a doctor says No to a bishopric, only that it may be granted him. \u2014 In short, he is a public professor of secrecy, and makes proclamation that he holds private intelli gence. \u2014 He's here. SCENE VIII Valentine and Scandal. Scan. He begs pardon like a hangman at an execution. Val. But I have got a reprieve. Scan. I am surprised ; what, does your father relent ? \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE XI Val. No ; he has sent me the hardest conditions in the world. You have heard of a booby brother of mine that was sent to sea three years ago? this brother my father bears is landed ; whereupon he very affectionately sends me word, if I will make a deed of conveyance of my right to his estate after his death to my younger brother, he will imme diately furnish me with four thousand pounds to pay my debts, and make my fortune. This was once proposed before, and I refused it ; but the present impatience of my creditors for their money, and my own impatience of confinement, and absence from Angelica, force me to consent. Valentine, Scandal, and Tattle. Tat. Valentine, good morrow ; Scandal, I am yours, \u2014 that is, when you speak well of me. Scan. That is, when I am yours ; for while I am my own, or anybody's else, that will never happen. Tat. How inhuman ! Val. Why, Tattle, you need not be much con cerned at anything that he says : for to converse with Scandal, is to play at Losing Loadum ; you must lose a good name to him, before you can win it for yourself."], [301, "LOVE FOR LOVE. SCENE XIII. 207 Tat. But how barbarous that is, and how unfor tunate for him, that the world should think the better of any person for his calumniation ! \u2014 I thank heaven, it has always been a part of my cha racter to handle the reputation of others very ten derly indeed. Scan. Ay, such rotten reputations as you have to deal with, are to be handled tenderly indeed. Tat. Nay, but why rotten ? why should you say rotten, when you know not the persons of whom you speak ? how cruel that is ! Scan. Not know 'em ? why, thou never hadst to do with anybody that did not stink to all the town. Tat. Ha ! ha ! ha ! nay, now you make a jest of it indeed ; for there is nothing more known, than that nobody knows anything of that nature of me. \u2014 As 1 hope to be saved, Valentine, I never exposed a woman since I knew what woman was. Val. And yet you have conversed with several. Tat. To be free with you, I have ; \u2014 I don't care if I own that ; \u2014 nay more (I'm going to say a hold word now), I never could meddle with a woman that had to do with anybody else. Tat. Upon my soul, Angelica's a fine woman. \u2014 And so is Mrs. Foresight, and her sister Mrs. Frail. Scan. Yes, Mrs. Frail is a very fine woman ; we all know her. Tat. Oh, that is not fair! Scan. What ? Tat. To tell. Scan. To tell what ? why, what do you know of Mrs. Frail ? Tat. Who, I ? upon honour I don't know whether she be man or woman ; but, by the smoothness of her chin, and roundness of her hips. Scan. No ! Tat. No. Scan. She says otherwise. Tat. Impossible ! Scan. Yes, faith. Ask Valentine else. Tat. Why then, as I hope to be saved, I believe a woman only obliges a man to secrecy, that she may have the pleasure of telling herself. Scan. No doubt on't. Well, but has she done you wrong, or no ? you have had her ? ha ? Tat. Though I have more honour than to tell first, I have more manners than to contradict what a ladv has declared. Scan. How ! Val. Nay, faith, I'm apt to believe him. \u2014 Except her husband, Tattle. Tat. Oh, that \u2014 Scan. Well, you own it ? Tat. I am strangely surprised ! \u2014 Yes, yes, I can't deny't, if she taxes me with it. Scan. She'll be here by-andby, she sees Valen tine every morning. Tat. How ? Scan. What think you of that noble commoner Mrs. Drab ? Tat. Pooh, I know Madam Drab has made her brags in three or four places, that I said this and that, and writ to her, and did I know not what ; \u2014 but upon my reputation she did me wrong. \u2014 Well, well, that was malice : \u2014 but I know the bottom of it. She was bribed to that by one we all know ; \u2014 a man too \u2014 only to bring me into disgrace with a certain woman of quality \u2014 Scan. Whom we all know. Val. She does me the favour, I mean, of a visit sometimes. I did not think she had granted more to anybody. Scan. Nor I, faith ; but Tattle does not use to belie a lady ; it is contrary to bis character. \u2014 How one may be deceived in a woman, Valentine ! Tat. Nay, what do you mean, gentlemen ? Scan. I'm resolved I'll ask her. Tat. No matter for that. \u2014 Yes, yes, everybody knows \u2014 no doubt on't, everybody knows my secrets. \u2014 But I soon satisfied the lady of my inno cence ; for I told her \u2014 Madam, says I, there are some persons who make it their business to tell stories, and say this and that of one and t'other, and everything in the world ; and, says I, if your grace- \u2014 Tat. O barbarous ! why, did you not tell me \u2014 Scan. No, you told us. Tat. And bid me ask Valentine ? Val. What did I say ? I hope you won't bring me to confess an answer, when you never asked me the question ? Scan. Grace ! Tat. But, gentlemen, this is the most inhuman proceeding \u2014 Val. Nay, if you have known Scandal thus long, and cannot avoid such a palpable decoy as this was, the ladies have a fine time whose reputations are in your keeping. Tat. 0 Lord ! what have I said ? my unlucky tongue ! Val. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Scan. Why, Tattle, thou hast more impudence than one can in reason expect : I shall have an esteem for thee. Well, and ha ! ha ! ha ! well, go on : and what did you say to her grace ? Val. I confess this is something extraordinary. Tat. Not a word, as I hope to be saved ; an arrant lapsus lingu\u0153. \u2014 Come, let's talk of some thing else. Val. Well, but how did you acquit yourself? Tat. Pooh ! pooh ! nothing at all, I only rallied with you \u2014 a woman of ordinary rank was a little jealous of me, and I told her something or other, faith \u2014 I know not what. \u2014 Come, let's talk of some thing else.

Val. If there were, you have more discretion than to give Scandal such an advantage ; why, your running away will prove all that he can tell her. Tat. Scandal, you will not be so ungenerous ? \u2014 Oh, I shall lose my reputation of secrecy for ever ! \u2014 I shall never be received but upon public days ; and my visits will never be admitted beyond a drawing-room : I shall never see a bedchamber again, never be locked in a closet, nor run behind a screen, or under a tabte ; never be distinguished among the waiting-women by the name of trusty Mr. Tattle more. \u2014 You will not be so cruel. Val. Pox take 'em ! their conjunction bodes me no good, I'm sure. Frail. Now you talk of conjunction, my brother Foresight has cast both their nativities, and prog nosticates an admiral and an eminent justice of the peace to be the issue male of their two bodies. 'Tis the most superstitious old fool ! he would have persuaded me, that this was an unlucky day, and would not let me come abroad ; hut I invented a dream, and sent him to Artemidorus for interpre tation, and so stole out to see you. Well, and what will you give me now ? come, I must have something. Val. Step into the next room \u2014 and I'll give you something. Scan. Ay, we'll all give you something. Frail. Well, what will you all give me ? Val. Mine's a secret. Val. Scandal, have pity on him ; he'll yield to any conditions. Tat. Any, any terms. Scan. Come, then, sacrifice half-a-dozen women of good reputation to me presently. \u2014 Come, where are you familiar ? \u2014 and see that they are women of quality too, the first quality. Tat. 'Tis very hard. \u2014 Won't a baronet's lady pass ? Scan. No, nothing under a right honourable. Tat. O inhuman ! you don't expect their names ? Scan. No, their titles shall serve. Tat. Alas ! that's the same thing : pray spare me their titles ; I'll describe their persons. Scan. Well, begin then : but take notice, if you are so ill a painter, that I cannot know the person by your picture of her, you must be condemned, like other bad painters, to write the name at the bottom. Tat. Well, first then\u2014 Frail. I thought you would give me something that would be a trouble to you to keep. Val. And Scandal shall give you a good name. Frail. That's more than he has for himself. \u2014 And what will you give me, Mr. Tattle ? Tat. I ? my soul, madam. Frail. Pooh, no, I thank you, I have enough to do to take care of my own. Well ; but I'll come and see you one of these mornings : I hear you have a great many pictures. Tat. I have a pretty good collection at your service, some originals. Scan. Hang him, he has nothing but the Seasons and the Twelve C\u00e6sars, paltry copies ; and the Five Senses, as ill represented as they are in him self ; and he himself is the only original you will see there. SCENE XIV. Valentine, Scandal, Tattle, and Mrs. Frail. Tat. O unfortunate 1 she's come already ; will you have patience till another time; \u2014 I'll double the number. Scan. Well, on that condition. \u2014 Take heed you don't fail me. Frail. Ay, but I hear he has a closet of beauties. Scan. Yes, all that have done him favours, if Frail. I shall get a fine reputation by coming to see fellows in a morning. \u2014 Scandal, you devil, are you here too ? \u2014 Oh, Mr. Tattle, everything is safe with you, we know. Scan. Tattle ! you will believe him. Frail. Ay, let me see those, Mr. Tattle. Tat. Oh, madam, those are sacred to love and contemplation. No man but the painter and myself was ever blest with the sight. Frail. Well, but a woman \u2014 Tot. Mum. \u2014 O madam, you do me too much honour. Val. Well, lady galloper, how does Angelica ? Frail. Angelica ? manners ! Val. What, you will allow an absent lover \u2014 Frail. No, I'll allow a lover present with his mistress to be particular ; \u2014 but otherwise I think his passion ought to give place to his manners. Tat. Nor woman, 'till she consented to have her picture there too ; \u2014 for then she's obliged to keep the secret. Scan. No, no ; come to me if you'd see pictures. Frail. You ? Scan. Yes, faith, I can show you your own picture, and most of your acquaintance to the life, and as like as at Kneller's. Val. But what if he has more passion than manners ? Frail. O lying creature! \u2014 Valentine, does not he lie ? \u2014 I can't believe a word he says. Val. No, indeed, he speaks truth now ; for as Tattle has pictures of all that have granted him favours, he has the pictures of all that have refused him; if satires, descriptions, characters, and lam poons aie pictures. Scan. Yes, mine are most in black and white ; \u2014 aud yet there are some set out in their true colours, both men and women. I can show you pride, folly, affectation, wantonness, inconstancy, covetousness, dissimulation, malice, and ignorance, all in one piece. Then I can show you lying, Frail. Then let him marry and reform. Val. Marriage indeed may qualify the fury of his passion, but it very rarely mends a man's manners. Frail. You are the most mistaken in the world ; there is no creature perfectly civil but a husband. For in a little time he grows only rude to his wife, and that is the highest good breeding, for it begets his civility to other people. \u2014 Well, I'll tell you news ; but I suppose you hear your brother Ben jamin is landed.

Well, but that story is not true. Scan. I have some hieroglyphics too ; I have a lawyer with a hundred hands, two heads, and but one face ; a divine with two faces, and one head ; and 1 have a soldier with his brains in his belly, and his heart where his head should be. Scan. I will : I have a mind to your sister. Frail. Civil! Tat. I will, because I have a tendre for your ladyship. Frail. That's somewhat the better reason, to my opinion. Scan. Well, if Tattle entertains you, I have the better opportunity to engage your sister. Val. Tell Angelica, I am about making hard conditions to come abroad, and be at liberty to see her. Frail. And no head ? Scan. No head. Frail. Pooh, this is all invention. Have you ne'er a poet ? Scan. Yes, I have a poet weighing words, and selling praise for praise, and a critic picking his pocket. I have another large piece too, repre senting a school ; where there are huge-propor tioned critics, with long wigs, laced coats, Steenkirk cravats, and terrible faces ; with catcalls in their hands, and horn-books about their necks. I have many more of this kind, very well painted as you 3ball see. Scan. I'll give an account of you and your proceedings. If indiscretion be a sign of love, you are the most a lover of anybody that I know : you fancy that parting with your estate will help you to your mistress. \u2014 In my mind he is a thought less adventurer, Who hopes to purchase wealth by selling land, Or win a mistress with a losing hand.

SCENE I. \u2014 A Room in Foresight's House. Foresight and Servant. Fore. Heyday ! what are all the women of my family abroad ? Is not my wife come home, nor my sister, nor my daughter ? Ser. No, sir. Fore. Mercy on us, what can be the meaning of it ? sure the moon is in all her fortitudes. Is my niece Angelica at home ? Ser. Yes, sir. Fore. I believe you lie, sir. Ser. Sir? Fore. Ha, how ? faith and troth I'm glad of it ! \u2014 And so I have ; that may be good luck in troth, in troth it may, very good luck : nay, I have had some omens : I got out of bed backwards too this morn ing, without premeditation ; pretty good that too ; but then I stumbled coming down stairs, and met a weasel ; bad omens those : some bad, some good, our lives are chequered : mirth and sorrow, want and plenty, night and day, make up our time. \u2014 But in troth I am pleased at my stocking; very well pleased at my stocking. \u2014 Oh, here's my niece ! \u25a0 \u2014 Sirrah, go tell sir Sampson Legend I'll wait on him if he's at leisure ; \u2014 'tis now three o'clock, a very good hour for business. Mercury governs this hour. Fore. I say you lie, sir. It is impossible that anything should be as I would have it ; for I was born, sir, when the Crab was ascending, and all my affairs go backward. Ser. I can't tell, indeed, sir. Fore. No, I know you can't, sir ; but I can tell, sir, and foretell, sir. SCENE II. Foresight, Servant, and Nurse. SCENE III. Fore. Nurse, where's your young mistress ? Nurse. Wee'st heart, I know not, they're none of 'em come home yet. Poor child ! I warrant she's fond o' seeing the town ; \u2014 marry, pray heaven, they ha' given her any dinner. \u2014 Good lack-a-day, Angelica, Fokesight, and Nurse. Any.

What, would you be gadding too ? sure all females are mad to-day. \u2014 It is of evil porcent, and bodes mischief to the master of a family. \u2014 I remember an old prophecy written by Messahalah the Arabian, and thus translated by a reverend Buckinghamshire bard. which she had forgot in the caudle-cup Nay, I know something worse, if I would speak of it. Fore. I defy you, hussy ! but I'll remember this, I'll be revenged on you, cockatrice; I'll hamper you. \u2014 You have your fortune in your own hands, \u2014 but I'll find a way to make your lover, your pro digal spendthrift gallant, Valentine, pay for all, I will. \" When housewifes all the house forsake, And leave goodman to brew and bake, Withouten guile then be it said, That house doth stond upon its head ; Ang.

I care not, but all shall out then. \u2014 Look to't, nurse ; I can bring witness that you have a great unnatural teat under your left arm, and he another ; and that you suckle a young devil in the shape of a tabby-cat, by turns, I can. Nurse. A teat ! a teat ! I an unnatural teat ! O the false slanderous thing ; feel, feel here, if I have anything but like another Christian. [Crying. Fore. I will have patience, since it is the will of the stars I should be thus tormented. \u2014 This is the effect of the malicious conjunctions and oppositions in the third house of my nativity ; there the curse of kindred was foretold. \u2014 But I will have my doors locked up\u2014 I'll punish you, not a man shall enter my house. Ang. Do, uncle, lock 'em up quickly before my aunt comes home ; \u2014 you'll have a letter for alimony to-morrow morning. \u2014 But let me be gone first, and then let no mankind come near the house, but converse with spirits and the celestial signs, the Bull, and the Ram, and the Goat. Bless me ! there are a great many horned beasts among the Twelve Signs, uncle ; \u2014 but cuckolds go to heaven. Fore. But there's but one virgin among the twelve signs, spitfire, but one virgin. Ang. Nor there had not been that one, if she had had to do with anything but astrologers, uncle. That makes my aunt go abroad. Fore. How ? how ? is that the reason ? Come, you know something : tell me, and I'll forgive you ; do, good niece. \u2014 Come, you shall have my coach and horses ; \u2014 faith and troth, you shall. \u2014 Does my wife complain ? come, I know women tell one another.\u2014 She is young and sanguine, has a wanton hazel eye, and was born under Gemini, which may incline her to society ; she has a mole upon her lip, with a moist palm, and an open liberality on the mount of Venus. Ang. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Fore. Do you laugh? \u2014 Well, gentlewoman, I'll \u2014 but come, be a good girl, don't perplex your poor uncle, tell me ; wont you speak ? \u2014 Odd, I'll \u2014 And when the head is set in grond, Ne marl if it be fruitful fond.\" Fruitful, the head fruitful ;\u2014 that bodes horns ; the fruit of the head is horns Dear niece, stay at home; for by the head of the house is meant the husband ; the prophecy needs no explanation. Ang. Well, but I can neither make you a cuckold, uncle, by going abroad ; nor secure you from being one, by staying at home. Fore. Yes, yes ; while there's one woman left, the prophecy is not in full force. Ang. But my inclinations are in force ; I have a mind to go abroad ; and if you won't lend me your coach, I'll take a hackney, or a chair, and leave you to erect a scheme, and find who's in con junction with your wife. Why don't you keep her at home, if you're jealous of her when she's abroad ? You know my aunt is a little retrograde (as you call it) in her nature. Uncle, I'm afraid you are not lord of the ascendant, ha ! ha ! ha ! Fore. Well, Jill-flirt, you are very pert \u2014 and always ridiculing that celestial science. Ang. Nay, uncle, don't be angry ; \u2014 if you are, I'll rip up all your false prophecies, ridiculous dreams, and idle divinations : I'll swear you are a nuisance to the neighbourhood. \u2014 What a bustle did you keep against the last invisible eclipse, lay ing in provision, as 'twere for a siege ! What a world of fire and candle, matches and tinder-boxes did you purchase ! One would have thought we were ever after to live under ground, or at least making a voyage to Greenland, to inhabit there all the dark season. Fore. Why, you malapert slut 1 Ang. Will you lend me your coach, or I'll go on ? \u2014 Nay, I'll declare how you prophesied popery was coming, only because the butler had mislaid some of the apostle spoons, and thought they were lost. Away went religion and spoonmeat together. \u2014 Indeed, uncle, I'll indict you for a wizard. Fore. How, hussy ! was there ever such a pro voking minx ! Nurse. O merciful father, how she talks I Ang. Yes, I can make oath of your unlawful midnight practices ; you and the old nurse there \u2014 Nurse. Marry, heaven defend ! \u2014 I at midnight practices ! \u2014 O Lord, what's here to do ! \u2014 I in un lawful doings with my master's worship ! \u2014 Why, did you ever hear the like now? \u2014 Sir, did ever I do anything of your midnight concerns \u2014 but warm your bed, and tuck you up, and set the candle and your tobacco-box and your urinal by you, and now and then rub the soles of your feet? \u2014 O Lord, I?\u2014 SCENE IV. Angelica, Foresight, Nurse, and Servant. Serv. Sir Sampson is coming down to wait upon you. Ang. Good b'w'ye, uncle. \u2014 Call me a chair. \u2014 [Exit Servant.] I'll find out my aunt, and tell her, she must not come home. [Exit. Fore. I'm so perplexed and vexed, I am not fit to receive him ; I shall scarce recover myself before the hour be past Go, nurse, tell sir Sampson I'm ready to wait on him. Nurse. Yes, sir. [Exit1. Fore. Well \u2014 why, if I was born to be a cuckold, there's no more to be said \u2014 he's here already. Ang. Yes, I saw you together, through the key hole of the closet, one night, like Saul and the witch of Endor, turning the sieve and shears, and pricking your thumbs, to write poor innocent ser vants' names in blood, about a little nutmeg -grater,"], [305, "LOVE FOR LOVE. SOBNB VII, 211 Fore. [Aside.] What, does he twit me with my wife too ? I must be better informed of this. \u2014 [Aloud.] Do you mean my wife, sir Sampson ? Though you made a cuckold of the king of Bantam, yet by the body of the sun \u2014 Sir Samp. By the horns of the moon, you would say, brother Capricorn. Fore. Capricorn in your teeth, thou modern Mandeville ! Ferdinand Mendez Pinto was but a type of thee, thou liar of the first magnitude ! Take back your paper of inheritance ; send your son to sea again. I'll wed my daughter to an Egyptian mummy, ere she shall incorporate with a contemner of sciences, and a defamer of virtue. SCENE V. Foresight and Sir Sampson with a paper. Sir Samp. Nor no more to be done, old boy ', that's plain. \u2014 Here 'tis, I have it in my hand, old Ptolomee ; I'll make the ungracious prodigal know who begat him ; I will, old Nostrodamus. What, I warrant my son thought nothing belonged to a father but forgiveness and affection ; no authority, no correction, no arbitrary power ; nothing to be done, but for him to offend, and me to pardon. I warrant you, if he danced till doomsday, he thought I was to pay the piper. Well, but here it is under black and white, signalum, sigillatum, and deliberatum ; that as soon as my son Benjamin is arrived, he is to make over to him his right of inheritance. Where's my daughter that is to be \u2014 ha! old Merlin ! body o'me, I'm so glad I'm revenged on this undutiful rogue. Fore. Odso, let me see ; let me see the paper. \u2014 Ay, faith and troth, here 'tis, if it will but hold. I wish things were done, and the conveyance made. When was this signed, what hour ? Odso, you should have consulted me for the time. Well, but we'll make haste. Sir Samp. [Aside.] Body o'me, I have gone too far ; \u2014 I must not provoke honest Albumazar. \u2014 [Aloud.] An Egyptian mummy is an illustrious creature, my trusty hieroglyphic ; and may have significations of futurity about him ; odsbud, I would my son were an Egyptian mummy for thy sake. What, thou art not angry for a jest, my good Haly ? \u2014 I reverence the sun, moon and stars with all my heart. What, I'll make thee a present of a mummy : now I think on't, body o'me, I have a shoulder of an Egyptian king, that I purloined from one of the pyramids, powdered with hierogly phics ; thou shalt have it brought home to thy house, and make an entertainment for all the phi lomaths, and students in physic and astrology, in and about London. Sir Samp. Haste, ay, ay ; haste enough, my son Ben will be in town to night. \u2014 I have ordered my lawyer to draw up writings of settlement and jointure : \u2014 all shall be done to-night. No matter for the time : prithee, brother Foresight, leave superstition. Pox o'th' time ! there's no time but the time present, there's no more to be said of what's past, and all that is to come will happen. If the sun shine by day, and the stars by night, why, we shall know one another's faces without the help of a candle, and that's all the stars are good for. Fore. How, how, Sir Sampson ? that all? Give me leave to contradict you, and tell you, you are ignorant. Sir Samp. I tell you I am wise ; and sapiens dominabitur astris ; there's Latin for you to prove it, and an argument to confound your ephemeris. \u2014 Ignorant ! \u2014 1 tell you, I have travelled, old Fircu, and know the globe. I have seen the antipodes, where the sun rises at midnight, and sets at noon day. Fore. But I tell you, I have travelled, and travelled in the celestial spheres, know the signs and the planets, and their houses. Can judge of motions direct and retrograde, of sextiles, quad rates, trines and oppositions, fiery trigons and aquatical trigons. Know whether life shall be long or short, happy or unhappy, whether diseases are curable or incurable. If journeys shall be pros perous, undertakings successful ; or goods stolen recovered, I know \u2014 Sir Sarnp. I know the length of the emperor of China's foot ; have kissed the Great Mogul's slipper, and rid a hunting upon an elephant with the Cham of Tartary. \u2014 Body o'me, I have made a cuckold of a king, and the present majesty of Bantam is the issue of these loins. Fore. But what do you know of roy wife, sir Sampson ? Sir Samp. Thy wife is a constellation of virtues ; she's the moon, and thou art the man in the moon: nay, she is more illustrious than the moon ; for she has her chastity without her inconstancy ; 'sbud I was but in jest. SCENE VI. Foresight, Sir Sampson, and Jeremy. Sir Samp. How now, who sent for you ? hu ! what would you have ? [Jeremy whispers Sir Sampson. Fore. Nay, if you were but in jest \u2014 Who's that fellow ? I don't like his physiognomy. Sir Samp. [ To Jeremy.] My son, sir ; what son, sir ? my son Benjamin, hoh? Jer. No, sir ; Mr. Valentine, my master. \u2014 'Tis the first time he has been abroad since his confine ment, and he comes to pay his duty to you. Sir Samp. Well, sir. SCENE VII. Foresight, Sir Sampson, Valentine, and Jeremy. Jer. He is here, sir. Val. Your blessing, sir. Sir Samp. You've had it already, sir. I think I sent it you to-day in a bill of four thousand pounds. \u2014 A great deal of money, brother Foresight. Fore. Ay, indeed, sir Sampson, a great deal of money for a young man ; I wonder what he can do with it. Fore. I know when travellers lie or speak truth, when they don't know it themselves. Sir Samp. I have known an astrologer made a cuckold in the twinkling of a star ; and seen a conjurer that could not keep the devil out of his Sir Samp. Body o'me, so do I. \u2014 Hark ye, Valen tine, if there be too much, refund the superfluity ; dost hear, boy P wife's circle. ps"], [306, "LOVE FOR LOVE. 212 ACT H. Val. Superfluity, sir ! it will scarce pay my debts. I hope you will have more indulgence, than to oblige me to those hard conditions which my necessity signed to. Sir Samp. Sir, how, I beseech you, what were you pleased to intimate concerning indulgence ? Sir Samp. Body o'me, what a many-headed monster have I propagated ! Val. I am of myself a plain, easy, simple crea ture, and to be kept at small expense ; but the retinue that you gave me are craving and invin cible ; they are so many devils that you have raised, and will have employment. Sir Samp. 'Oons, what had I to do to get chil dren ! \u2014 can't a private man be born without all these followers ? \u2014 Why, nothing under an emperor should be born with appetites. \u2014 Why, at this rate, a fellow that has but a groat in his pocket, may have a stomach capable of a ten-shilling ordinary. Jer. Nay, that's as clear as the sun ; I'll make oath of it before any justice in Middlesex. Sir Samp. Here's a cormorant too. \u2014 'S'heart, this fellow was not born with you? \u2014 I did not beget him, did I ? Jer. By the provision that's made for me, you might have begot me too : \u2014 nay, and to tell your worship another truth, I believe you did, for I find I was born with those same whoreson appetites too that my master speaks of. Sir Samp. Why, look you there now \u2014 I'll main tain it, that by the rule of right reason, this fellow ought to have been born without a palate \u2014 'S'heart, what should he do with a distinguishing taste ? \u2014 I warrant now he'd rather eat a pheasant than a piece of poor John: and smell now\u2014 why, I war rant he can smell, and loves perfumes above a stink Why, there's it ; and music \u2014 don't you love music, scoundrel ? Val. Why, sir, that you would not go to the extremity of the conditions, but release me at least from some part. Sir Samp. Oh, sir, I understand you \u2014 that's all, ha? Val. Yes, sir, all that I presume to ask; \u2014 but what you, out of fatherly fondness, will be pleased to add shall be doubly welcome. Sir Samp. No doubt of it, sweet sir : but your filial piety and my fatherly fondness would fit like two tallies. \u2014 Here's a rogue, brother Foresight, makes a bargain under hand and seal in the morn ing, and would be released from it in the afternoon ; here's a rogue, dog, here's conscience and honesty; this is your wit now, this is the morality of your wits ! You are a wit, and have been a beau, and may be a \u2014 why, sirrah, is it not here under hand and seal ? \u2014 can you deny it ? Val. Sir, I don't deny it. Sir Samp. Sirrah, you'll be hanged ; I shall live to see you go up Holborn-hill. \u2014 Has he not a rogue's face ? \u2014 Speak, brother, you understand physiognomy, a hanging look to me ; \u2014 of all my boys the most unlike me ; he has a damned Tyburn face, without the benefit o' the clergy. Fore. Hum \u2014 truly I don't care to discourage a young man. He has a violent death in his face ; Jer. Yes, I have a reasonable good ear, sir, as to jigs and country dances, and the like ; I don't much matter your solos or sonatas ; they give me the spleen. Sir Samp. The spleen, ha ! ha ! ha ! a pox confound you ! \u2014 solos or sonatas ? 'Oons, whose son are you ? how were you engendered, muck worm ? but I hope no danger of hanging. Val. Sir, is this usage for your son ? \u2014 for that old weather-headed fool, I know how to laugh at him ; but you, sir \u2014 Sir Samp. You, sir j and you, sir ; \u2014 why, who are you, sir ? Val. Your son, sir. Sir Samp. That's more than I know, sir, and I believe not. Jer. I am by my father the son of a chairman; my mother sold oysters in winter and cucumbers in summer ; and I came up stairs into the world ; for I was born in a cellar Val. Faith, I hope not. Sir Samp. What, would you have your mother a whore ! \u2014 Did you ever hear the like ! did you ever hear the like ! Body o'me \u2014 Val, I would have an excuse for your barbarity and unnatural usage. Sir Samp. Excuse ! impudence ! Why, sirrah, mayn't I do what I please ? are not you my slave? did not I beget you? and might not I have chosen whether I would have begot you or no ? 'Oons ! who are you ? whence came you ? what brought you into the world ? how came you here, sir ? here, to stand here, upon those two legs, and look erect with that audacious face, hah ? answer me that ? Did you come a volunteer into the world ? or did I, with the lawful authority of a parent, press you to the service ? Val. I know no more why I came than you do why you called me. But here I am, and if you don't mean to provide for me, I desire you would leave me as you found me. Sir Samp. With all my heart : come, uncase, strip, and go naked out of the world as you came into't. Fore. By your looks, you should go up stairs out of the world too, friend. Sir Samp. And if this rogue were anatomised now, and dissected, he has his vessels of digestion and concoction, and so forth, large enough for the inside of a cardinal, this son of a cucumber! \u2014 These things are unaccountable and unreasonable. \u2014 Body o'me, why was not I a bear ? that my cubs might have lived upon sucking their paws. Nature has been provident only to bears and spiders ; the one has its nutriment in his own hands, and t'other spins his habitation out of his own entrails. Val. Fortune was provident enough to supply all the necessities of my nature, if I had my right of inheritance. Sir Samp. Again ! 'Oons, han't you four thou sand pounds \u2014 if I had it again, I would not give thee a groat. \u2014 What, wouldst thou have me turn pelican, and feed thee out of my own vitals? \u2014 'S'heart, live by your wits, \u2014 you were always fond of the wits : \u2014 now less see if you have wit enough to keep yourself. \u2014 Your brother will be in town to-night or to-morrow morning, and then look you perform covenants, and so your friend and servant. \u2014 Come, brother Foresight. Val. My clothes are soon put off;\u2014 but you must also divest me of reason, thought, passions, in clinations, affections, appetites, senses, and the huge train of attendants that you begot along with me."], [307, "LOVE FOR LOVE.

I'll allow you now to find fault with my face ; \u2014 for I'll swear your impudence has put me out of countenance : \u2014 but look you here now, \u2014 where did you lose this gold bodkin ? \u2014 0 sister, sister ! SCENE VIII. Valentine and Jeremy, Jer. I told you what your visit would come to. Val. 'Tis as much as I expected. \u2014 I did not come to see him : I came to Angelica ; but since she was gone abroad it was easily turned another way; and at least looked well on my side. \u2014 What's here? Mrs. Foresight and Mrs. Frail; they are earnest. \u2014 I'll avoid 'em. \u2014 Come this way, and go and inquire when Angelica will return. Frail. My bodkin ? Mrs. Fere. Nay, 'tis yours, look at it.

I have heard gentlemen say, sister, that one should take great care, when one makes a thrust in fencing, not to lie open one's self. Mrs. Fore. It's very true, sister ; well, since all's out, and as you say, since we are both wounded, let us do what is often done in duels, take care of one another, and grow better friends than before. Frail. With all my heart : ours are but slight flesh. wounds, and if we keep 'em from air, not at all dangerous : well, give me your hand in token of sisterly secrecy and affectioD. Mrs. Fore. Here 'tis with all my heart. Frail. Well, as an earnest of friendship and con fidence, I'll acquaint you with a design that I have. To tell truth, and speak openly one to another, I'm afraid the world have observed us more than we have observed one another. You have a rich husband, and are provided for ; I am at a loss, and have no great stock either of fortune or reputation ; and therefore must look sharply about me. Sir Sampson has a son that is expected to-night ; and by the account I have heard of his education, call be no conjurer ; the estate you know is to be mado over to him i\u2014 now if I could wheedle him, sister, ha ? you understand me ? Mrs. Fore. I do ; and will help you to the utmost of my power. \u2014 And I can tell you one thing that falls out luckily enough ; my awkward daughter in-law, who you know is designed to be his wife, is grown fond of Mr. Tattle ; now if we can improve that, and make her have an aversion for the booby, it may go a great way towards his liking you. Here they come together ; and let us contrive some way or other to leave 'em together. SCENE IX. Mrs. Foresight and Mrs. Frail. Frail. What have you to do to watch me 1 'slife, I'll do what 1 please. Mrs. Fore. You will ? Frail. Yes, marry will I. \u2014 A great piece of business to go to Covent-Garden square in a hack ney-coach, and take a turn with one's friend I Mrs. Fore. Nay, two or three turns, I'll take my oath. Frail. Well, what if I took twenty ? \u2014 I warrant if you had been there, it had been only innocent recreation. \u2014 Lord, where's the comfort of this life, if we can't have the happiness of conversing where we like ? Mrs. Fore. But can't you converse at home ? \u2014 I own it, I think there's no happiness like con versing with an agreeable man ; I don't quarrel at that, nor I don't think but your conversation was very innocent ; but the place is public, and to be seen with a man in a hackney-coach is scandalous : what if anybody else should have seen you alight, as I did ? \u2014 How can anybody be happy, while they're in perpetual fear of being seen and cen sured I \u2014 Besides, it would not only reflect upon you, sister, but me. F rail. Pooh, here's a clutter ! \u2014 Why should it reflect upon you ? \u2014 I don't doubt but you have thought yourself happy in a hackney-coach before now. \u2014 If I had gone to Knightsbridge,or to Chelsea, or to Spring Garden, or Barn Elms, with a man alone \u2014 something might have been said. Airs. Fore. Why, was I ever in any of those places ? what do you mean, sister ? Frail. Was I ? what do you mean ? Mrs. Fore. You have been at a worse place. Frail.

Is it to make a fool of me? or does she leave us together out of good morality, and do as she would be done by ? \u2014 Gad, I'll understand it so. Prue. Well ; and how will you make love to me ? come, I long to have you begin. Must I make love too ? you must tell me how. Tat. You must let me speak, miss, you must not speak first ; I must ask you questions, and you must answer Frail. Ah, devil ! sly devil ! \u2014 He's as close, sister, as a confessor. \u2014 He thinks we don't observe him. Prue. What, is it like the catechism ? \u2014 come then, ask me. Mrs. Fore. A cunning cur ! how soon he could find out a fresh harmless creature ! and left us, sister, presently. Tat. D'ye think you can love me ? Prue. Yes. Tat. Pooh ! pox ! you must not say yes already ; I shan't care a farthing for you then in a twinkling. Prue. What must I say then ? Tat. Why, you must say no, or you believe not, or you can't tell. Prue. Why, must I tell a lie then ? Tat. Yes, if you'd be well-bred ; \u2014 all well-bred persons lie. \u2014 Besides, you are a woman, you must never speak what you think : your words must contradict your thoughts ; but your actions may contradict your words. So, when I ask you, if you can love me, you must say no, but you must love me too. If I tell you you are handsome, you must deny it, and say I flatter you. But you must think yourself more charming than I speak you : and like me, for the beauty which I say you have, as much as if I had it myself. If I ask you to kiss me, you must be angry, but you must not refuse me. If I ask you for more, you must be more angry, \u2014 but more complying ; and as soon as ever I make you say you'll cry out, you must be sure to hold your tongue. Prue. O Lord, I swear this is pure ! \u2014 I like it better than our old-fashioned countFy way of speaking one's mind ; \u2014 and must not you lie too? Tat. Upon reputation \u2014 Mrs. Fore. They're all so, sister, these men : \u2014 they love to have the spoiling of a young thing, they are as fond of it, as of being first in the fashion, or of seeing a new play the first day. \u2014 I warrant it would break Mr. Tattle's heart, to think that anybody else should be beforehand with him. Tat. Oh Lord, I swear I would not for the world \u2014 Frail. O hang you ! who'll believe you ?-r- You'd be hanged before you'd confess \u2014 we know you \u2014 she's very pretty ! \u2014 Lord, what pure red and white ! \u2014 she looks so wholesome ; \u2014 ne'er stir, I don't know, but I fancy, if I were a man \u2014 Prue. How you love to jeer one, cousin ! Mrs. Fore. Hark ye, sister. \u2014 By my soul the girl is spoiled already \u2014 d'ye think she'll ever endure a great lubberly tarpaulin ! \u2014 gad, I warrant you, she won't let him come near her, after Mr. Tattle. Frail. O' my soul, I'm afraid not \u2014 eh ! \u2014 filthy creature, that smells all of pitch and tar. \u2014 [ To Tattle.] Devil take you, you confounded toad ! \u2014 why did you see her before she was married ? Mrs. Fore. Nay, why did we let him ? \u2014 My husband will hang us ; \u2014 he'll think we brought 'em acquainted. Frail. Come, faith, let us be gone If my bro ther Foresight should find us with them, he'd think so, sure enough. Mrs. Fore. So he would \u2014 but then leaving 'em together is as bad. \u2014 And he's such a sly devil, he'll never miss an opportunity. Frail. I don't care ; I won't be seen in't. Tat. Hum ! \u2014 Yes ; but you must believe I speak truth. Prue. O Gemini ! well, I always had a great mind to tell lies : but they frighted me. and said it was a sin. Tat. Well, my pretty creature ; will you make me happy by giving me a kiss ? Prue. No, indeed ; I'm angry at you. [Runs and kisses him. Mrs. Fore. Well, if you should, Mr. Tattle, you'll have a world to answer for ; \u2014 remember I wash my hands of it \u2014 I'm throughly innocent. Tat.

Admirable ! that was as well as if you had been born and bred in Covent-garden. And won't you show me, pretty miss, where your bed chamber 'is ? Prue.

Yes, but 1 dare trust you ; we were talk ing of Angelica's love for Valentine ; you won't speak of it ? \u25a0 Tat.

Pox take her ! \u2014 if she had stayed two minutes longer, I should have wished for her coming. Ang. How ! Tat. No, madam, his love for your ladyship. \u2014 Gad take me, I beg your pardon ; \u2014 for I never heard a word of your ladyship's passion till this instant. Prue. O dear, what shall I say ? tell me, Mr. Tattle, tell me a lie. Tat. There's no occasion for a lie ; I could never tell a lie to no purpose ; \u2014 but since we have done nothing, we must say nothing, I think. I hear her ; I'll leave you together, and come off as you can. [Thrusts her in, and shuts the door. Ang. My passion ! and who told you of my passion, pray, sir ? Scan. [Aside to Tattle.] Why, is the devil in you ? did not I tell it you for a secret ? Tat. [Aside to Scandal.] Gad so, but I thought she might have been trusted with her own affairs. Scan. Is that your discretion ? trust a woman with herself ? Tat. You say true, I beg your pardon; \u2014 I'll bring all off. \u2014 [Aloud.] It was impossible, madam, for me to imagine, that a person of your ladyship's wit and gallantry could have so long received the passionate addresses of the accomplished Valentine, and yet remain insensible ; therefore you will par don me, if, from a just weight of his merit, with your ladyship's good judgment, I formed the balance of a reciprocal affection.

ACT III. are obliged to acquit ourselves ; and for my part \u2014 but your ladyship is to speak first. Ang. Am I ? well, I freely confess I have resisted a great deal of temptation. Tat. And, egad, I have given some temptation that has not been resisted. has given thee this lesson of fustian to get by rote? Ang. I dare swear you wrong him, it is his own ; and Mr. Tattle only judges of the success of others from the effects of his own merit. For certainly Mr. Tattle was never denied anything in his life. Val. Good ! Tat. O Lord ! yes, indeed, madam, several times. Ang. I cite Valentine here, to declare to the court how fruitless he has found his endeavours, and to confess all his solicitations and my denials. Val. I am ready to plead not guilty for you, and guilty for myself. Scan. So, why this is fair, here's demonstration with a witness ! Ang. I swear I don't think 'tis possible. Tat. Yes, I vow aud swear I have : Lord, madam, I'm the most unfortunate man in the world, and the most cruelly used by the ladies. Ang. Nay, now you are ungrateful. Tat. No, I hope not : \u2014 'tis as much ingratitude to own some favours as to conceal others. Tat. Well, my witnesses are not present. But I confess I have had favours from persons \u2014 but as the favours are numberless, so the persons are nameless. Val. There, now it's out. Ang. I don't understand you now : I thought you had never asked anything but what a lady might modestly grant, and you confess. Scan. So, faith, your business is done here ; now you may go brag somewhere else. Tat. Brag ! O heavens ! why, did I name any body ? Ang. No, I suppose that is not in your power ; but you would if you could, no doubt on't. Tat. Not in my power, madam ! what, doei your ladyship mean that I have no woman's repu tation in my power ? Scan. [Aside to Tattle.] 'Oons, why, you won't own it, will you ? Tat. Faith, madam, you're in the right : no more I have, as I hope to be saved ; I never had it in my power to say anything to a lady's prejudice in my life. For, as I was telling you, madam, I have been the most unsuccessful creature living, in things of that nature ; and never had the good for tune to be trusted once with a lady's secret, not once. Scan. Pooh, this proves nothing. Tat. No ? I can show letters, lockets, pictures, and rings ; and if there be occasion for witnesses, I can summon the maids at the chocolate-houses, all the porters at Pali-Mall and Covent-Gardeo, the door-keepers at the play-house, the drawers at Locket's, Pontac's, the Rummer, Spring-Garden ; my own landlady, and valet-de-chambre ; all who shall make oath, that I receive more letters than the Secretary's Office ; and that I have more vizor masks to inquire for me than ever went to see the Hermaphrodite, or the Naked Prince. And it is notorious, that in a country church, once, an inquiry being made who I was, it was answered, I was the famous Tattle, who had ruined so many women. Val. It was there, I suppose, you got the nick. name of the Great Turk. Tat. True, I was called Turk-Tattle all over the parish. \u2014 The next Sunday all the old women kept their daughters at home, and the parson had not half his congregation. He would have brought me into the spiritual court, but I was revenged upon him, for he had a handsome daughter, whom I initiated into the science. But I repented it afterwards, for it was talked of in town ; and a lady of quality, that shall be nameless, in a raging fit of jealousy, came down in her coach and six horses, and exposed herself upon my account ; gad I was sorry for it with all my heart. \u2014 You know whom I mean \u2014 you know where we raffled \u2014 Scan. Mum, Tattle. Val. 'Sdeath, are not you ashamed? Ang. O barbarous ! I never heard so insolent a piece of vanity Fy, Mr. Tattle! -I'll swear I could not have believed it. \u2014 Is this your secrecy ? Tat. Gad so, the heat of my story carried me beyond my discretion, as the heat of the lady s passion hurried her beyond her reputation. \u2014 But I hope you don't know whom I mean ; for there were a great many ladies raffled. \u2014 Pox on't ! now could I bite off my tongue. Scan. No, don't ; for then you'll tell us no more. \u2014 Come, I'll recommend a song to you upon the hint of my two proverbs, and I see one in the next room that will sing it. [Exit. Tat. For Heaven's sake if you do guess, say nothing j gad, I'm very unfortunate. Ang. No 1 Val. Not once, I dare answer for him. Scan. And I'll answer for him ; for I'm sure if he had, he would have told me. \u2014 I find, madam, you don't know Mr. Tattle. Tat. No, indeed, madam, you don't know me at all, I find. For sure my intimate friends would have known \u2014 Ang. Then it seems you would have told, if you had been trusted. Tat. O pox, Scandal ! that was too far put. \u2014 Never have told particulars, madam. Perhaps I might have talked as of a third person, or have introduced an amour of my own, in conversation, by way of novel ; but never have explained parti culars. Ang. But whence comes the reputation of Mr. Tattle's secrecy, if he was never trusted ? Scan. Why thence it arises : the thing is pro verbially spoken ; but may be applied to him. \u2014 As if we should say in general terms, lie only is secret who never was trusted ; a satirical proverb upon our sex. \u2014 There's another upon yours, as She is chaste who ivas never asked the question. That's all. Val. A couple of very civil proverbs truly : 'tis hard to tell whether the lady or Mr. Tattle be the more obliged to you. For you found her virtue upon the backwardness of the men, and his secrecy upon the mistrust of the women. Tat. Gad, it's very true, madam, I think we Re-enter- Scandal with one to sing. Scan. Pray sing the first song in the last new play."], [311, "LOVE FOR LOVE. SCENE VI. 217 Ang.

As long as one must not speak one's mind, one had better not speak at all, I think, and truly I won't tell a He for the matter. Ben. Nay, you say true in that, 'tis but a folly to lie : for to speak one thing, and to think just the contrary way, is, as it were, to look one way and row another. Now, for my part, d'ye see, I'm for carrying things above board, I'm not for keep ing anything under hatches, \u2014 so that if you ben't as willing as I, say so a' God's name, there's no harm done.

But I'm sure it is not so, for I'll speak sooner than you should believe that; and I'll speak truth, though one should always tell a lie to a man ; and I don't care, let my father do what he will ; I'm too big to be whipped, so I'll tell you plainly I don't like you, nor love you at all, nor never will, that's more : so, there's your answer for you; and don't trouble me no more, you ugly thing 1 Ben.

But I tell you one thing, if you should give such language at sea you'd have a cat o' nine-tails laid cross your shoulders. Flesh ! who are you ? You heard t'other handsome young woman speak civilly to me, of her own accord : whatever you think of yourself, gad I don't think you are any more to compare to her than a can of small beer to a bowl of punch.

'Tis no earthquake ! Scan. No, not yet ; nor whirlwind. But we don't know what it may come to. \u2014 But it has had a consequence already that touches us all. Sir Samp. Why, body o'me, out with't. Scan. Something has appeared to your son Valentine. \u2014 He's gone to bed upon't, and very ill. \u2014 He speaks little, yet says he has a world to say. Asks for his father and the wise Foresight ; talks of Raymond Lully, and the ghost of Lilly. He has secrets to impart I suppose to you two. I can get nothing out of him but sighs. He desires he may see you in the morning, but would not be disturbed to-night, because he has some business to do in a dream. Mrs. Fore. Bless me, what's the matter, miss ? What, does she cry ? \u2014 Mr. Benjamin, what have you done to her ? Ben. Let her cry : the more she cries, the less she'll \u2014 she has been gathering foul weather in her mouth, and now it rains out at her eyes. Airs. Fore. Come, miss, come along with me, and tell me, poor child. Frail. Lord, what shall we do ? there's my brother Foresight and sir Sampson coming. \u2014 Sister, do you take miss down into the parlour, and I'll carry Mr. Benjamin into my chamber, for they must not know that they are fallen out. \u2014 Come, sir, will you venture yourself with me ? [Looking kindly on him. Ben. Venture, mess, and that I will, though 'twere to sea in a storm. Sir Samp. Hoity, toity, what have I to 4o with his dreams or his divinations ? \u2014 Body o'me. this is a trick to defer signing the conveyance. 1 warrant, the devil will tell him in a dream, that he must not part with his estate ; but I'll bring him a parson, to tell him that the devil's a liar ; or, if that won't do, I'll bring a lawyer that shall outlie the devil. And so I'll try whether my blackguard or his shall get the better of the day. SCENE IX. Sir Sampson and Foresight. Sir Samp. I left 'em together here ; what, are they gone ? Ben's a brisk boy ; he has^ got her into a corner ; father's own son, faith, he'll touzle her, and mouzle her ; the rogue's sharp set, com ing from sea ; if he should not stay for saying grace, old Foresight, but fall too without the help of a parson, ha ? Odd, if he should, I could not be angry with him ; 'twould be but like me, a chip of the old block. Ha ! thou'rt melancholic, old prog nostication ; as melancholic as if thou hadst spilt the salt, or pared thy nails on a Sunday. \u2014 Come, cheer up, look about thee : lookup, old star-gazer. \u2014 [Aside.] Now is he poring upon the ground for a crooked pin, or an old horse-nail, with the head towards him. Fore. Sir SamDson, we'll have the wedding to morrow morning. SCENE XI. Scandal and Foresight. Scan. Alas, Mr. Foresight ! I'm afraid all is not right. \u2014 You are a wise man, and a conscien tious man ; a searcher into obscurity and futurity ; and if you commit an error, it is with a great deal of consideration and discretion and caution. Fore. Ah, good Mr. Scandal \u2014 Scan. Nay, nay, 'tis manifest ; I do not flatter you. \u2014 But Sir Sampson is hasty, very hasty ;\u2014 I'm afraid he is not scrupulous enough, Mr. Foresight. \u2014 He has been wicked, and heaven grant he may mean well in his affair with you.\u2014 But my mind gives me, these things cannot be wholly insignificant. You are wise, and should not be over-reached, me thinks you should not. Fore. Alas, Mr Scandal!\u2014 Humanumesterrare. Scan. You say true, man will err ; mere man W;U err \u2014 but you are something more. \u2014 There have been wise men ; but they were such as you ; \u2014 men who consulted the stars, and were observers of omens. \u2014 Solomon was wise, but how ? \u2014 by his judgment in astrology : \u2014 so says Pineda in his third book and eighth chapter. Fore. You are learned, Mr. Scandal ! Scan. A trifler \u2014 but a lover of art. \u2014 And the wise men of the East owed their instruction to a star, which is rightly observed by Gregory the Great in favour of astrology I And Albertus Magnus makes it the most valuable science: because (says he) it teaches us to consider the causation of causes, in the causes of things. Fore. I protest I honour you, Mr. Scandal ; \u2014 Sir Samp. With all my heart. Fore. At ten o'clock, punctually at ten. Sir Samp. To a minute, to a second ; thou shalt set thy watch, and the bridegroom shall observe its motions ; they shall be married to a minute ; go to bed to a minute ; and when the alarm strikes, they shall keep time like the figures of St. Dunstan's clock, and consummatum est shall ring all over the parish. SCENE X. Sir Sampson, Foresight, and Scandal. Scan. Sir Sampson, sad news ! Fore. Bless us ! Sir Samp. Why, what's the matter ? \u2022Scan. Cau't you guess at what ought to afflict"], [314, "LOVE FOR LOVE. 220 ACT III. I I did not think you had been read in these matters. \u2014 Few young men are inclined \u2014 Scan. I thank my stars that have inclined me. \u2014 But I fear this marriage, and making over this estate, this transferring of a rightful inheritance, will bring judgments upon us. I prophesy it, and I would not have the fate of Cassandra, not to be believed. Valentine is disturbed, what can be the cause of that ? and sir Sampson is hurried on by an unusual violence. \u2014 I fear he does not act wholly from himself ; methinks he does not look as he used to do. claim my passion. But come a little farther this way, and I'll tell you what project I had to get him out of the way, that 1 might have an opportunity of waiting upon you. Fore. [Looking in the glass.] I do not see any revolution here ; \u2014 methinks I look with a serene and benign aspect \u2014 pale, a little pale \u2014 but the roses of these cheeks have been gathered many years \u2014 Ha ! I do not like that sudden flushing ; gone already I \u2014 hem, hem, hem I faintish. My heart is pretty good ; yet it beats ; and my pulses, ha ! \u2014 I have none \u2014 mercy on me ! \u2014 hum \u2014 yes here they are \u2014 gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, hey ! whither will they hurry me ? \u2014 Now they're gone again \u2014 and now I'm faiut again ; and pale again, and, hem ! and my, hem ! \u2014 breath, hem ! \u2014 grows short ; hem ! hem ! he, he, hem ! Scan. [Aside to Mrs. Foresight.] It takes; pursue it, in the name of love and pleasure I Mrs. Fore. How do you do, Mr. Foresight ? Fore. Hum, not so well as I thought I was. Lend me your hand. Scan. Look you there now \u2014 your lady says your sleep has been unquiet of late. .Fore. Very likely. Airs. Fore. O mighty restless ; hut I was afraid to tell him so. \u2014 He has been subject to talking and starting. Fore. He was always of an impetuous nature. \u2014 \u2022 But as to this marriage, I have consulted the stars, and all appearances are prosperous. Scan. Come, come, Mr. Foresight, let not the prospect of worldly lucre carry you beyond your judgment, nor against your conscience ; \u2014 you are not satisfied that you act justly. Fore. How ? Scan. You are not sitisfied, 1 say. \u2014 I arn loath to discourage you \u2014 but it is palpable that you are not satisfied. Fore. How does it appear, Mr. Scandal ? I think I am very well satisfied. Scan. Either you suffer yourself to deceive yourself ; or you do not know yourself. Fore. Pray explain yourself. Scan. Do you sleep well o'nights ? Fore. Very well. Scan. Are you certain ? you do not look so. Fore. I am in health, I think. Scun. And did not use to he so ? Mrs. Fore. Never, never, till within these three nights ; I cannot say that he has once broken my rest since we have been married. Scan. So was Valentine this morning ; and looked just so. Fore. How ! am I altered any way ? I don't perceive it. Fore. I will go to bed. Scan. Do so, Mr. Foresight, and say your prayers He looks better than he did. Airs. Fore. Nurse, nurse ! [Calls. Fore. Do you think so, Mr. Scandal ? Scan. Yes, yes ; I hope this will be gone by morning, taking it in time. Fore. I hope so. Scan. That may be, but your beard is longer than it was two hours ago. Fore. Indeed ! bless me ! SCENE XII. SCENE XIII, Scandal, Foresight, and Mrs. Foresight. Airs. Fore. Husband, will you go to bed ? it's ten o'clock. \u2014 Mr. Scandal, your servant. Scan. [Aside.] Pox on her! she has inter rupted my design : \u2014 but I must work her into the project \u2014 [Aloud.] You keep early hours, madam. Scandal, Foresight, Mrs. Foresight, and Nurse. Mrs. Fore. Nurse, your master is not well ; put him to bed. Scan. I hope you will be able to see Valentine in the morning. You had best take a little diaco dion and cowslip-water, and lie upon your back, may be you may dream. Fore. I thank you, Mr. Scandal, I will. \u2014 Nurse, let me have a watch-light, and lay the Crumbs of Comfort by me. Nurse. Yes, sir. Airs. Fore. Mr. Foresight is punctual, we sit up after him. Fore. My dear, pray lend me your glass, your little looking-glass. Scan. Pray, lend it him, madam \u2014 I'll tell you the reason \u2014 [She gives him the glass : Scandal and she talk aside.] My passion for you is grown so violent, that I am no longer master of myself. \u2014 I was interrupted in the morning, when you had charity enough to give me your attention, and I had hopes of finding another opportunity of explaining myself to you ; \u2014 but was disappointed all this day ; and the uneasiness that has attended me ever since, brings me now hither at this unsea sonable hour. Fore. And \u2014 hem, hem ! I am very faint. Scan. No, no ; you look much better. Fore. Do I ? \u2014 [ To Nurse.] And, d'ye hear, bring me, let me see \u2014 within a quarter of twelve \u2014 hem \u2014 he, hem !\u2014 just upon the turning of the tide, bring me the urinal. And I hope, neither the lord of my ascendant, nor the moon, will be combust ; aud then I may do well. Scan. I hope so. Leave that to me ; I will erect a scheme ; and I hope I shall find both Sol and Venus in the sixth house. Airs. Fore. Was there ever such impudence I to make love to me before my husband's face ! I'll swear I'll tell him. Fore. I thank you, Mr. Scandal ; indeed that would be a great comfort to me. Hem, hem ! good night. Scan. Do; I'll die a martyr, rather than Jis-"], [315, "LOVE FOR LOVE. SCENE XV. 221 SCENE XIV. SCENE XV. Scandal and Mrs. Foresight. Scandal, Mrs. Foresight, Mrs. Fbail, <mH Ben. Scan. Good night, good Mr. Foresight ; and I hope Mars and Venus will be in conjunction, while your wife and I are together. Mrs. Fore. Well, and what use do you hope to make of this project ? you don't think that you are ever like to succeed in your design upon me ? Scan. Yes, faith, I do ; I have a better opinion both of you and myself than to despair. Mrs. Fore. Did you ever hear such a toad ? Hark ye, devil ! do you think any woman honest ? Scan. Yes, several very honest; they'll cheat a little at cards, sometimes ; but that's nothing. Mrs. Fore. Pshaw ! but virtuous, I mean. Ben. Mess, I love to speak my mind ; father has nothing to do with me. Nay, I can't say that neither ; he has something to do with me. But what does that signify? if so be, that I be'n't minded to be steered by him, 'tis as tho'f he should strive against wind and tide. Frail. Ay, but, my dear, we must keep it secret till the estate be settled ; for you know marrying without an estate is like sailing in a ship without ballast. Ben. He ! he ! he ! why, that's true j just so for all the world it is indeed, as like as two cable ropes. Scan. Yes, faith ; I believe some women are virtuous too; but 'tis as I believe some men are valiant, through fear. For why should a man court danger, or a woman shun pleasure ? Mrs. Fore. O monstrous ! what are conscience and honour ? Frail. And though I have a good portion, you know one would not venture all in one bottom. Ben. Why, that's true again ; for mayhap one bottom may spring a leak. You have hit it indeed, mess, you've nicked the channel. Frail. Well, but if you should forsake me after all, you'd break my heart. Ben. Break your heart ! I'd rather the Mary gold should break her cable in a storm, as well as I love her. Flesh, you don't think I'm false hearted like a landman ! A sailor will be honest. tho'f mayhap he has never a penny of money in his pocket. \u2014 Mayhap I may not have so fair a face as a citizen or a courtier ; but for all that, I've as good blood in my veins, and a heart as sound as a biscuit. Scan. Why, honour is a public enemy ; and con science a domestic thief ; and he that would secure his pleasure, must pay a tribute to one, and go halves with t'other. As for honour, that you have secured ; for you have purchased a perpetual oppor tunity for pleasure. Mrs. Fore. An opportunity for pleasure I Scan. Ay, your husband ; a husband is an oppor tunity for pleasure ; so you have taken care of honour, and 'tis the least I can do to take care of conscience. Frail. And will you love me always ? Ben. Nay, au I love once, I'll stick like pitch ; I'll tell you that. Come, I'll sing you a song of a sailor. Mrs. Fore. And so you think we are free for one another. Scan. Yes, faith, I think so ; I love to speak my mind. Frail. Hold, there's my sister ; I'll call her to hear it. Mrs. Fore. W7hy, then I'll speak my mind. Now, as to this affair between you and me. Here you make love to me ; why, I'll confess, it does not displease me. Your person is well enough, and your understanding is not amiss. Scan. I have no great opinion of myself; but I think I'm neither deformed nor a fool. Mrs. Fore. Well, I won't go to bed to my husband to-night ; because I'll retire to my own chamber, and think of what you have said. Scan. Well ; you'll give me leave to wait upon you to your chamber door, and leave you my last instructions ? Mrs. Fore. Hold, here's my sister coming towards us. Mrs. Fore. But you have a villanous character ; you are a libertine in speech as well as practice. Scan. Come, I know what you would say ; you think it more dangerous to be seen in conversation with me, than to allow some other men the last favour. You mistake ; the liberty I take in talk ing is purely affected, for the service of your sex. He that first cries out, Stop thief ! is often he that has stolen the treasure. I am a juggler, that act by confederacy ; and, if you please, we'll put a trick upon the world. Mrs. Fore. Ay ; but you are such a universal juggler, that I'm afraid you have a great many confederates. Frail. If it won't interrupt you, I'll entertain you with a song. Ben. The song was made upon one of our ship's crew's wife ; our boatswain made the song ; mayhap you may know her, sir. Before she was married, she was called buxom Joan of Deptford. Scan. I have heard of her. Ben sings. A soldier and a sailor, A tinker and a tailor, Scan. Faith, I'm sound. Mrs. Fore. O, fy ! \u2014 I'll swear you're impudent. Scan. I'll swear you're handsome. Mrs. Fore. Pish 1 you'd tell me so, though you did not think so. Had once a doubtful strife, sir. To make a maid a wife, sir, Whose name was buxom Joan. For now the time was ended, When she no more intended To lick her lips at men, sir, And gnaw the sheets in vain, sir, Scan. And you'd think so, though I should not tell you so. A_nd now I think we know one another pretty well. Mrs. Fore. O Lord, who's here ? And lie o' nights alone. The soldier swore like thunder, He loved her more than plunder ;"], [316, "LOVE FOR LOVE 222 act ir A Dance. And show'd her many a scar, sir, That he had brought from far, sir, Ben. We're merry folks, we sailors, we han't much to care for. Thus we live at sea ; eat biscuit, and drink flip ; put on a clean shirt once a quarter \u2014 come home and lie with our landladies once a year, get rid of a little money ; and then put off with the next fair wind. How d'ye like us ? Frail. O you are the happiest, merriest men alive ! With fighting for her sake. The tailor thought to please her, With offering her his measure. The tinker too with mettle, Said he could mend her kettle, And stop up every leak. But while these three were prating, The sailor slily waiting, Mrs. Fore. We're beholden to Mr. Benjamin for this entertainment \u2014 I believe it's late. Thought if it came about, sir, That they should all fall out, sir, Ben. Why, forsooth, an you think so, you had best go to bed. For my part, I mean to toss a can, and remember my sweetheart, afore I turn in ; mayhap I may dream of her. Mrs. Fore. Mr. Scandal, you had best go to bed and dream too. He then might play his part. And just e'en as he meant, sir, To loggerheads they went, sir, And then he let fly at her A shot 'twixt w.ind and water, That won this fair maid's heart. Scan. Why faith, I have a good lively imagina tion ; and can dream as much to the purpose as another, if I set about it ; but dreaming is the poor retreat of a lazy, hopeless, and imperfect lover; 'tis the last glimpse of love to worn-out sinners, and the faint dawning of a bliss to wishing girls and growing boys. There's nought but willing, waking love that can Make blest the ripen'd maid and finish'd man. [Exeunt.

Not upon a kind occasion, madam. But when a lady comes tyrannically to insult a ruined lover, and make manifest the cruel triumphs of her beauty ; the barbarity of it something surprises me. Scandal and Jeremy. Scan. Well, is your master ready ? does he look madly, and talk madly ? Jer. Yes, sir ; you need make no great doubt of that ; he that was so near turning poet yesterday morning, can't be much to seek in playing the madman to-day. Scan. Would he have Angelica acquainted with the reason of his design ? Jer. No, sir, not yet ; \u2014 he has a mind to try, whether his playing the madman won't make her play the fool, and fall in love with him ; or at least own, that she has loved#him all this while and con cealed it. Ang. I don't like raillery from a serious face.\u2014 Pray tell me what is the matter ? Jer. No strange matter, madam ; my master's mad, that's all : I suppose your ladyship has thought him so a great while. Ang. How d'ye mean, mad ? Jer. Why, faith, madam, he's mad for want of his wits, just as he was poor for want of money ; his head is e'en as light as his pockets ; and any body that has a mind to a bad bargain, can't do better than to beg him for his estate. Ang. If you speak truth, your endeavouring at wit is very unseasonable. Scan. [Aside.] She's concerned, and loves him. Ang. Mr. Scandal, you cannot think me guilty of so much inhumanity, as not to be concerned for a man I must own myself obliged to ; pray tell me the truth. Scan. I saw her take coach just now with her maid ; and think I heard her bid the coachman drive hither. Jer. Like enough, sir, for I told her maid this morning my master was run stark mad only for love of her mistress. I hear a coach stop ; if it should be she, sir, I believe he would not see her. till he hears how she takes it. Scan. Faith, madam, I wish telling a lie would mend the matter. But this is no new effect of an unsuccessful passion. Scan. Well, I'll try her : \u2014 'tis she, here she comes. Ang. [Aside.] I know not what to think. \u2014 Yet I should be vexed to have a trick put upon me. \u2014 [Aloud.] May I not see him ? Scan. I'm afraid the physician is not willing you should see him yet. \u2014 Jeremy, go in and inquire. SCENE II. Scandal, Jeremy, Angelica, and Jenny. Ang. Mr. Scandal, I suppose you don't think it a novelty to see a woman visit a man at his own lodgings in a morning ?"], [317, "LOVE FOR LOVE. fcCENK VI. 223 with his mistress, he may descend from his exal tation of madness into the road of common sense, and be content only to be made a fool with other reasonable people. \u2014 I hear sir Sampson. You know your cue ; I'll to your master. SCENE III. Scandal, Angelica, and Jenny. Ang. [Aside.] Ha ! I saw him wink and smile \u2014 I fancy 'tis a trick \u2014 I'll try. \u2014 [Aloud.] I would disguise to all the world a failing which I must own to you. \u2014 I fear my happiness depends upon the recovery of Valentine. Therefore I conjure you, as you are his friend, and as you have compassion upon one fearful of affliction, to tell me what I am to hope for. \u2014 I cannot speak \u2014 but you may tell me, for you know what I would ask. Scan. [Aside.] So, this is pretty plain. \u2014 [Aloud.] Be not too much concerned, madam, I hope his condition is not desperate : an acknow ledgment of love from you, perhaps, may work a cure ; as the fear of your aversion occasioned his distemper. Ang. [Aside.] Say you so ? nay, then I'm con vinced ; and if I don't play trick for trick, may I never taste the pleasure of revenge ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Acknowledgment of love ! I find you have mistaken my compassion, and think me guilty of a weakness I'm a stranger to. But I have too much sincerity to deceive you, and too much charity to suffer him to be deluded with vain hopes. Good-nature and humanity oblige me to be concerned for him ; but to love is neither in my power nor inclination ; and if he can't be cured without I suck the poison from his wounds, I'm afraid he won't recover his senses till I lose mine. SCENE V. Jeremy, Sir Sampson, and Buckram. Sir Samp. D'ye see, Mr. Buckram, here's the paper signed with his own hand. Buck. Good, sir. And the conveyance is ready drawn in this box, if he be ready to sign and seal. Sir Samp. Ready, body o' me, he must be ready! his sham-sickness shan't excuse him. \u2014 O, here's his scoundrel. \u2014 Sirrah, where's your master? Jer. Ab, sir, he's quite gone. Sir Samp. Gone ! what, he is not dead ? Jer. No, sir, not dead. Sir Samp. What, is he gone out of town ? run away, ha ! has he tricked me ? speak, varlet. Jer. No, no, sir, he's safe enough, sir, an he were but as sound, poor gentleman. He is, indeed, here, sir, and not here, sir. Sir Samp. Heyday, rascal, do you banter me ? sirrah, d'ye banter me? \u2014 Speak, sirrah, where is he ? for I will find him. Jer. Would you could, sir ! for he has lost him self. Indeed, sir, I have almost broke my heart about him \u2014 I can't refrain tears when I think of him, sir : I'm as melancholy for him as a passing bell, sir ; or a horse in a pound. Sir Samp. A pox confound your similitudes, sir ! \u2014 Speak to be understood, and tell me in plain terms what the matter is with him, or I'll crack your fool's scull. Jer. Ah, you've hit it, sir ! that's the matter with him, sir ; his scull's cracked, poor gentleman ! he's stark mad, sir. Scan. [Aside.] Hey, orave woman, i'faith! \u2014 [Aloud.] Won't you see him then, if he desire it? Ang. What signify a madman's desires? besides, 'twould make me uneasy. If I don't see him, perhaps my concern for him may lessen. If I forget him, 'tis no more than he has done by him- self; and now the surprise is over, methinks I am not half so sorry as I was. Scan. So, faith, good-nature works apace ; you were confessing just now an obligation to his love. Ang. But I have considered that passions are unreasonable and involuntary ; if he loves, he can't help it j and if I don't love, I can't help it; no more than he can help his being a man, or I my being a woman ; or no more than I can help my want of inclination to stay longer here. \u2014 Come, Jenny. Sir Samp. Mad ! B uck. What, is he non compos ? Jer. Quite non compos, sir. Buck. Why, then all's obliterated, sir Sampson; if he be non compos mentis, his act and deed will be of no effect, it is not good in law. Sir Samp. 'Oons, I won't believe it ! let me see him, sir. \u2014 Mad ! I'll make him find his senses. Jer. Mr. Scandal is with him, sir ; I'll knock at the door. [Goes to the Scene, which opens. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 - SCENE IV. SCENE VI. Scandal and Jeremy. Sir Sampson, Valentine, Scandal, Jeremy, and Buck- ram. Valentine upon a couch, disorderly dressed. Scan. Humph ! \u2014 An admirable composition, faith, this same womankind 1 Jer. What, is she gone, sir ? Scan. Gone ? why she was never here ; nor anywhere else ; nor I don't know her if I see her ; nor you neither. Jer. Good lack ! what's the matter now ? are any more of us to be mad ? Why, sir, my master longs to see her; and is almost mad in good earnest with the j.oyful news of her being here. Scan. We are all under a mistake. Ask no questions, for I can't resolve you ; but I'll inform your master. In the mean time, if our project succeed no better with his father than it does Sir Samp. How now I what's here to do ? Val. Ha ! who's that ? Scan. For heaven's sake softly, sir, and gently 1 don't provoke him. Val. Answer me, who is that, and that ? Sir Samp. Gadsbobs, does he not know me ? Is he mischievous ? I'll speak gently.\u2014 Val, Val, dost thou not know me, boy ? not know thy own father, Val ? I am thy own father, and this is honest Brief Buckram the lawyer. Val.

Why, let me see, I can read it as plain as can be ; look you here \u2014 [Reads.] The condition of this obligation \u2014 look you, as plain as can be, so it begins and then at the bottom \u2014 As witness my hand, VALEN TINE LEGEND, in great letters ; why, 'tis as plain as the nose in one's face ; what, are my eyes better than thine ?

Why does that lawyer wear black ? \u2014 does he carry his conscience withoutside ? \u2014 Lawyer, what art thou ? dost thou know me ? Buck. O Lord ! what must I say ? \u2014 Yes, sir. Val. Thou liest, for I am Truth. 'Tis hard I cannot get a livelihood amongst you. I have been sworn out of Westminster-hall the first day of every term \u2014 let me see \u2014 no matter how long \u2014 but I'll tell you one thing; it's a question that would puzzle an arithmetician, if you should ask him, whether the Bible saves more souls in Westminster- Abbey, or damns more in Westminster-Hall ; for my part, I am Truth, and can't tell ; I have very few acquaintance. Sir Samp. Body o'me, he talks sensibly in his madness ! has he no intervals ? Val. Will you please to let me hold it, sir? Sir Samp. Let thee hold it, sayest thou ? \u2014 ay, with all my heart. \u2014 What matter is it who holds it ? what need anybody hold it ? \u2014 I'll put it up in my pocket, Val, and then nobody need hold it [Puts the paper in his pocket.] There, Val, it's safe enough, boy \u2014 but thou shalt have it as soon as thou hast set thy hand to another paper, little Val. Jer. Very short, sir. Buck. Sir, I can do you no service while he's in this condition ; here's your paper, sir \u2014 he may do me a mischief if I stay \u2014 the conveyance is ready, sir, if he recover his senses. SCENE IX. SirSAMPSON, Valentine, Scandal, Jeremy, and Buckram. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 Val. What, is my bad genius here again I Oh no, it is the lawyer with an itching palm ; and he's come to be scratched \u2014 my nails are not long enough \u2014 let me have a pair of red-hot tongs, quickly 1 quickly ! and you shall see me act St. Dunstan, and lead the devil by the nose. Buck. O Lord, let me be gone ! I'll not venture myself with a madman. SCENE VII. Sir Sampson, Valentine, Scandal, and Jeremy. Sir Samp. Hold, hold, hold, don't you go yet. Scan. You'd better let him go, sir ; and send for him if there be occasion ; for I fancy his pre sence provokes him more. Val. Is the lawyer gone ? 'tis well ; then we may drink about without going together by the ears \u2014 heigh-ho! WThat o'clock is 't? \u2014 My father here ! your blessing, sir. Sir Samp. He recovers. \u2014 Bless thee, Val,\u2014 how dost thou do, boy ? Val. Thank you, sir, pretty well \u2014 I have been a little out of order \u2014 won't you please to sit, sir ? Sir Samp. Ay, boy. \u2014 Come, thou shalt sit down by me. Val. Sir, 'tis my duty to wait. Sir Samp. No, no, come, come, sit thee down, honest Val ; how dost thou do ? let me feel thy pulse \u2014 Oh, pretty well now, Val ; body o' me, I was sorry to see thee indisposed ! but I'm glad thou art better, honest Val. SCENE X. Sir Sampson, Valentine, Scandal, and Jereaty. Val. Ha ! ha ! ha ! you need not run so fast, honesty will not overtake you. \u2014 Ha ! ha ! ha ! the rogue found me out to be in forma pauperis presently. Sir Samp. Oons ! what a vexation is here ! I know not what to do or say, or which way to go. Val. Who's that, that's out of his way ! I am Truth, and can set him right. \u2014 Hark ye, friend, the straight road is the worst way you can go : \u2014 he that follows his nose always, will very often be led into a stink. \u2014 Probatum est. \u2014 But what are you for, religion or politics ? There's a couple of topics for you, no more like one another than oil and vinegar ; and yet those two beaten together by a state-cook, make sauce for the whole nation. Sir Samp. What the devil had I to do, ever to beget sons ? why did I ever marry ? Val. Because thou wert a monster, old boy ; the two greatest monsters in the world are a man and a woman ; what's thy opinion ? Sir Samp. Why, my opinion is that those two monsters joined together, make yet a greater, that's a man and his wife. Val. I thank you, sir. Scan. Miracle ! the monster grows loving. [Aside. Sir Samp. Let me feel thy hand again, Val; it does not shake \u2014 I believe thou canst write, Val; ha, boy, thou canst write thy name, Val ? \u2014 Jeremy, step and overtake Mr. Buckram, bid him make haste back with the conveyance ; quick ! quick ! [Whispers Jeremy, whogoes out. SCENE VIII. Sir Sampson, Valentine, and Scandal. Val. Aha, old truepenny ! sayest thou so ? thou hast nicked it. \u2014 But, it's wonderful strange, Scan. That ever I should suspect such a heathen of any remorse ! [Aside. Jeremy."], [319, "SCENE XIII. LOVE FOR LOVF. 225 Jer. What is, sir? Airs. Fore. Not much ; \u2014 he's superstitious, and you are mad, in my opinion. Scan. You make me mad. \u2014 You are not serious ; \u2014 pray, recollect yourself. Val. That grey hairs should cover a green head, and I make a fool of my father. \u2014 What's here ! Erra Pater, or a bearded Sibyl ? If Prophecy comes, Truth must give place. Airs. Fore. O yes, now I remember, you were very impertinent and impudent, \u2014 and would have come to bed to me. Scan. And did not ? Mrs. Fore. Did not ! with what face can you ask the question ? Scan. [Aside.] This I have heard of before, but never believed. I have been told she had that ad mirable quality of forgetting to a man's face in the morning that she had lain with him all nigbt, and denying that she had done favours with more im pudence than she could grant 'em. \u2014 Madam, I'm your humble servant, and honour you. \u2014 [Aloud.] You look pretty well, Mr. Foresight.\u2014 How did you rest last night ? Fore. Truly, Mr. Scandal, I was so taken up with broken dreams and distracted visions, that I remember little. SCENE XI. Sir Sampson, Scandal, Foresight, Mrs. Foresight, and Mrs. Frail. Fore. What says he? what, did he prophesy? \u2014 Ha, sir Sampson, bless us ! how are we ? Sir Samp. Are we ! a pox o' your prognostica tion \u2014 why, we are fools as we use to be. \u2014 Oons, that you could not foresee that the moon would predominate, and my son be mad ! \u2014 Where's your oppositions, your trines, and your quadrates ? \u2014 What did your Cardan and your Ptolemy tell you ? your Messahalah and your Longomontanus, your harmony of chiromancy with astrology ? Ah ! pox on't, that I that know the world, and men and manners, that don't believe a syllable in the sky and stars, and sun and almanacs, and trash, should be directed by a dreamer, an omen-hunter, and defer business in expectation of a lucky hour ! when, body o' me, there never was a lucky hour after the first opportunity. Scan. 'Twas a very forgetting night. \u2014 But would you not talk with Valentine, perhaps you may un derstand him ? I'm apt to believe there is some thing mysterious in his discourses, and sometimes rather think him inspired than mad. Fore. You speak with singular good judgment, Mr. Scandal, truly. \u2014 I am inclining to your Turkish opinion in this matter, and do reverence a man whom the vulgar think mad. Let us go to him. Frail. Sister, do you stay with them ; I'll find out my lover, and give him his discharge, and come to you. \u2014 O' my conscience here he comes. SCENE XII. Scandal, Foresight, Mrs. Foresight, and Mrs. Frail. Fore. Ah, sir Sampson, Heaven help your head I This is none of your lucky hour ; Nemo omnibus horis sapit. What, is he gone, and in contempt of science ? Ill stars and unconvertible ignorance attend him ! SCENE XIII. Mrs. Frail and Ben. Scan. You must excuse his passion, Mr. Fore sight ; for he has been heartily vexed. \u2014 His son is non compos mentis, and thereby incapable of making any conveyance in law ; so that all his measures are disappointed. Fore. Ha ! say you so ? Frail. What, has my sea-lover lost his anchor of hope then ? [Aside to Mrs. Foresight. Airs. Fore. Oh, sister, what will you do with him ? Ben. All mad, I think. \u2014 Flesh, I believe all the calentures of the sea are come ashore, for my part! Frail. Mr. Benjamin in choler ! Ben. No, I'm pleased well enough now I have found you. \u2014 Mess, 1 have had such a hurricane upon your account yonder ! Frail. My account ! pray what's the matter ? Ben. Why, father came and found me squabbling with yon chitty-faced thing as he would have me marry, \u2014 so he asked what was the matter. \u2014 He asked in a surly sort of a way. \u2014 It seems brother Val is gone mad, and so that put'n into a passion ; but what did I know that, what's that to me ? \u2014 So he asked in a surly sort of manner, \u2014 and gad I answered 'en as surlily ; what tho'f he be my father ? I an't bound prentice to 'en : \u2014 so faith I told'n in plain terms, if I were minded to marry I'd marry to please myself, not him : and for the young woman that he provided for me, I thought it more fitting for her to learn her sampler and make dirt-pies, than to look after a husband ; for my part I was none of her man. \u2014 I had another voyage to make, let him take it as he will. Frail. So then, you intend to go to sea again ? Ben. Nay, nay, my mind run upon you, \u2014 but I would not tell him so much. \u2014 So he said he'd make my heart ache ; and if so be that he could get a woman to his mind, he'd marry himself. Gad, says I, an you play the fool and marry at these Frail. Do with him ! send him to sea again in the next foul weather. \u2014 He's used to an incon stant element, and won't be surprised to see the tide turned. Fore. Wherein was I mistaken, not to foresee this ? [Considers. Scan. Madam, you and I can tell him something else that he did not foresee, and more particularly relating to his own fortune.

SCENE XIV. Mrs. Frail and Mrs. Foresight. Frail. O sister, had you come a minute sooner, you would have seen the resolution of a lover Honest Tar and I are parted, \u2014 and with the same indifference that we met. \u2014 O' my life I am half vexed at the insensibility of a brute that I de spised. Mrs. Fore. What, then, he bore it most he roically ? Frail. Most tyrannically, \u2014 for you see he has got the start of me ; and I the poor forsaken maid am left complaining on the shore. But I'll tell you a hint that he has given me ; sir Sampson is enraged, and talks desperately of committing ma trimony himself; \u2014 if he has a mind to throw himself away, he can't do it more effectually than upon me, if we could bring it about. Mrs. Fore. Oh, hang him, old fox ! he's too cunning ; besides he hates both you and me. But I have a project in my head for you, and I have gone a good way towards it. I have almost made a bargain with Jeremy, Valentine's man, to sell his master to us. Frail. And were you this undutiful and grace less wretch to your father ? Ben. Then why was he graceless first ? \u2014 If I am undutiful and graceless, why did he beget me so ? I did not get myself. Frail. O impiety ! how have I been mistaken I what an inhuman merciless creature have I set my heart upon ! O I am happy to have discovered the shelves and quicksands that lurk beneath that faithless smiling face ' Ben. Hey toss ! what's the matter now ? why, you ben't angry, he you ? Frail. O see me no more ! \u2014 for thou wert born amongst rocks, suckled by whales, cradled in a tempest, and whistled to by winds ; and thou art come forth with fins and scales, and three rows of teeth, a most outrageous fish of prey. Ben. O Lord, O Lord, she's mad ! poor young woman ; love has turned her senses, her brain is quite overset ! Well-a-day, how shall I do to set her to rights ? Frail. No, no, I am not mad, monster, I am wise enough to find you out. Hadst thou the impudence to aspire at being a husband with that stubborn and disobedient temper ? \u2014 You that know not how to submit to a father, presume to have a sufficient stock of duty to undergo a wife ? I should have been finely fobbed indeed, very finely fobbed. Ben. Hark ye, forsooth ; if so be that you are in your right senses, d'ye see ; for aught as I perceive I'm like to be finely fobbed, \u2014 if I have got anger here upon your account, and you are tacked about already. \u2014 What d'ye mean, after all your fair speeches and stroking my cheeks, and kissing and hugging, what, would you sheer off so ? would you, and leave me aground ? Frail. No, I'll leave you adrift, and go which way you will. Frail. Sell him ! how ? Airs. Fore. Valentine raves upon Angelica, and took me for her, and Jeremy says will take any body for her that he imposes on him. Now I have promised him mountains, if in one of his mad fits he will bring you to him in her stead, and get you married together, and put to bed together ; and after consummation, girl, there's no revoking. And if he should recover his senses, he'll be glad at least to make you a good settlement. \u2014 Here they come : stand aside a little, and tell me how you like the design. \u2014 \u2022 \u2014 SCENE XV. Mrs. Foresight, Mrs. Frail, Valentine, Scandal, Ben. What, are you false-hearted, then ? Frail. Only the wind's changed. Ben. More shame for you : \u2014 the wind's changed ! It's an ill wind blows nobody good, \u2014 mayhap I have a good riddance on you, if these be your tricks. What did you mean all this while, to make a fool of me ? Foresight, and Jeremy. Scan. And have you given your master a hint of their plot upon him ? [To Jeremy. Jer. Yes, sir ; he says he'll favour it, and mis take her for Angelica. Scan. It may make us sport. Fore. Mercy on us ! Val. Hush ! \u2014 interrupt me not : I'll whisper prediction to thee, and thou shalt prophesy. I am Truth, and can teach thy tongue a new trick : \u2014 I have told thee what's past \u2014 now I'll tell what's to come. Dost thou know what will happen to-mor row ? \u2014 answer me not \u2014 for I will tell thee. To morrow, knaves will thrive through craft, and fools through fortune, and honesty will go as it did, frost-nipped in a summer suit. Ask me questions concerning to-morrow. Scan. Ask him, Mr. Foresight. Fore. Pray, what will be done at court ? Val. Scandal will tell you : \u2014 I am Truth, I never come there. Frail. Any fool but a husband. Ben. Husband ! gad, I would not be your hus band, if you would have me, now I know your mind, tho'f you had your weight in gold and jewels, and tho'f I loved you never so well. Frail. Why, canst thou love, porpoise ? Ben. No matter what I can do ; don't call names, \u2014 I don't love you so well as to bear that, whatever I did. I'm glad you show yourself, mistress. \u2014 Let them marry you, as don't know you: \u2014 gad, I know you too well, by sad experi ence ; I believe he that marries you will go to sea iu a hen-pecked frigate \u2014 I believe that, young wo man \u2014 and mayhap may come to an anchor at Cuckold's-point ; so there's a dash for you, take it as you will, mayhap you may holla after me when I won't come to. [Exit. Fore. In the cify ? Val. Oh, prayers will be said in empty churches, at the usual hours. Yet you will see such zealous faces behind counters, as if religion were to be sold in every shop.

And the crept prentice, that sweeps his master's shop in the morning, may, ten to one, dirty his sheets before night. But there are two things that you will see very strange ; which are wanton wives with their legs at liberty, and tame cuckolds with chains about their necks. \u2014 But hold,I must examine you before I go further ; you look suspiciously. Are you a husband ? Fore. I am married. SCENE XVI. Mrs. Foresight, Mrs. Frail, Valentine, Scandal, Foresight, Jeremy, Tattle, and Angelica. Jer. I'll take care, and \u2014 Val. Whisper. Ang. Nay, Mr. Tattle, if you make love to me, you spoil my design , for I intend to make you my confidant. Tat. But, madam, to throw away your person, such a person, and such a fortune, on a madman ? Ang. I never loved him till he was mad ; but don't tell anybody so. Scan. [Aside.] How's this ! Tattle making love to Angelica ? Tat. Tell, madam ! alas, you don't know me \u2014 I have much ado to tell your ladyship how long I have been in love with you ; but encouraged by the impossibility of Valentine's making any more addresses to you, I have ventured to declare the very inmost passion of my heart. Oh, madam, look upon us both ; there you see the ruins of a poor decayed creature, \u2014 here a complete and lively figure, with youth and health, and all his five senses in perfection, madam; and to all this, the most passionate lover \u2014 Ang. O fy, for shame ! hold your tongue ; a passionate lover and five senses in perfection ! when you are as mad as Valentine, I'll believe you love me, and the maddest shall take me. Val. Poor creature ! is your wife of Covent garden parish ? Fore. No ; St. Martiu's-in-the-fields. Val. Alas, poor man ! his eyes are sunk, and his hands shrivelled ; his legs dwindled, and his back bowed ; pray, pray, for a metamorphosis. Change thy shape, and shake off age ; get thee Medea's kettle, and be boiled anew ; come forth with la bouring callous hands, a chine of steel, and Atlas shoulders.

Very likely, truly ; you understand these matters; \u2014 Mr. Scandal, I shall be very glad to confer with you about these things which he has uttered \u2014 his sayings are very mysterious and hiero glyphical. Val. Oh, why would Angelica be absent from my eyes so long ? Jer. She's here, sir '. Val. It is enough. \u2014 Ha, who's here ? Frail. O Lord, her coming will spoil all ! [Aside to Jeremy. Jer. [Aside to Mrs. Frail.] No, no, madam, he won't know her; if he should, I can persuade him. Val. Scandal, who are these ? foreigners ? If they are, I'll tell you what I think. \u2014 [ Whispers.] Get away all the company but Angelica, that I may discover my design to her. Scan.

He won't know you, cousin, he knows nobody. Fore. But he knows more than anybody. Oh. niece, he knows things past and to come, and all the profound secrets of time. Tat. Look you, Mr. Foresight, it is not my way to make many words of matters, and so I shan't say much ; but, in short, d'ye see, I will hold you a hundred pounds now, that I know more secrets than he. Mrs. Fore. Now, sister. Frail. O Lord, what must I say ? Scan. Humour him, madam, by all means. Val.

Hark ye \u2014 I have a secret to tell you \u2014 Endymion and the moon shall nreet us upon mount Latmos, and we'll be married in the dead of night \u2014 but say not a word. Hymen shall put his torch into a dark lantern, that it may be secret ; and Juno shall give her peacock poppy-water, that he may fold his ogling tail, and Argus's hundred eyes be shut, ha !

O Lord ! SCENE XVIII. Angelica and Valentine. Val. Madam, you need not be very much afraid, for I fancy I begin to come to myself. Ang. [Aside.] Ay, but if I don't fit you, I'll be hanged. Val. You see what disguises love makes us put on : gods have been in counterfeited shapes for the same reason ; and the divine part of me, my mind, has worn this mask of madness, and this motley livery, only as the slave of love, and menial crea ture of your beauty. Ang. Mercy on me, how he talks ! poor Valen tine ! Val. O, exceeding good to keep a secret : for though she should tell, yet she is not to be believed. Tat. Ha ! good again, faith. Val. I would have music. \u2014 Sing me the song that I like. Val. Nay, faith, now let us understand one another, hypocrisy apart. \u2014 The comedy draws toward an end, and let us think of leaving acting, and be ourselves ; and since you have loved me, you must own, I have at length deserved you should confess it.

Charmion, could I time retrieve, And could again begin to love and live, To you I should my earliest offering give ; I know, my eyes would lead my heart to you, And I should all my vows and oaths renew ; But, to be plain, I never would be true. Ang. [Sighs.] I would I had loved you ! \u2014 for Heaven knows I pity you ; and could I have fore seen the bad effects, I would have striven ; but that's too late. [Sighs. For by our weak and weary truth I find, Love hates to centre in a point assign'd ; But runs with joy the circle of the mind : Val. What bad effects ? \u2014 what's too late ? My seeming madness has deceived my father, and pro cured me time to think of means to reconcile me to him, and preserve the right of my inheritance to his estate ; which otherwise by articles I must this morning have resigned : and this 1 had informed you of to-day, but you were gone, before I knew you had been here. Ang. How ! I thought your love of me had caused this transport in your soul ; which it seems you only counterfeited, for mercenary ends and sordid interest !

Nay, now you do me wrong ; for if any interest was considered it was yours ; since I thought I wanted more than love to make meworthy of you. Ang. Then you thought me mercenary. \u2014 But how am I deluded by this interval of sense, to reason with a madman ! Val. Oh, 'tis barbarous to misunderstand me longer ! Scan. Jeremy, follow Tattle.

Yes, madam, he has intervals ; but you see he begins to look wild again now. Val. Why, you thick-skulled rascal, I tell you the farce is done, and I will be mad no longer. [Beats him. SCENE XX. Angelica, Valentine, and Jenny. Ang. Well, have you been there ? \u2014 Come hither. Jen. [Aside to Angelica.] Yes, madam, sir Sampson will wait upon you presently. Val. You are not leaving me in this uncertainty ? Ang. Would anything but a madman complain of uncertainty ? Uncertainty and expectation are the joys of life. Security is an insipid thing, and the overtaking and possessing of a wish, discovers the folly of the chase. Never let us know one another better : for the pleasure of a masquerade is done, when we come to show our faces ; but 111 tell you two things before I leave you ; I am not the fool you take me for ; and you are mad, and don't know it. Ang. Ha ! ha ! ha ! is he mad or no, Jeremy ? Jer. Partly I think \u2014 for he does not know his own mind two hours. \u2014 I'm sure I left him just now in the humour to be mad ; and I think I have not found him very quiet at this present ! \u2014 [Knocking at the door.] Who's there ? Val. Go see, you sot. \u2014 [Exit Jeremy.] I'm very glad that I can move your mirth, though not your compassion. Ang. I did not think you had apprehension enough to be exceptions : but madmen show them selves most, by over-pretending to a sound under standing ; as drunken men do by over-acting sobriety. I was half-inclining to believe you, till I accidentally touched upon your tender part ; but now you have restored me to my former opinion and compassion. SCENE XXI. Valentine and Jeremy. Val. From a riddle you can expect nothing but a riddle. There's my instruction, and the moral of my lesson. Jer. What, is the lady gone again, sir? I hope you understood one another before she went ? Val. Understood ! she is harder to be under stood than a piece of Egyptian antiquity, or an Irish manuscript ; you may pore till you spoil your eyes, and not improve your knowledge. Jer. I have heard 'em say, sir, they read hard Hebrew books backwards ; may be you begin to read at the wrong end. Val. They say so of a witch's prayer : and dreams and Dutch almanacs are to be understood by contraries. But there's regularity and method in that ; she is a medal without a reverse or inscrip tion, for indifference has both sides alike. Yet while she does not seem to hate me, I will pursue her, and know her if it he possible, in spite of the opinion of my satirical friend, Scandal, who says, That women are like tricks by sleight of hand, W7hich, to admire, we should not understand. Re-enter Jeremy. Jer. Sir, your father has sent to know if you are any better yet. \u2014 Will you please to be mad, sir, or how ? Val. Stupidity ! you know the penalty of all I'm worth must pay for the confession of my senses ; I'm mad, and will be mad to everybody but this lady. Jer. So ; \u2014 Just the very backside of truth. \u2014 But lying is a figure in speech, that interlards the greatest part of my conversation. \u2014 Madam, your ladyship's woman. [.Exeunt. ACT V. SCENE I. \u2014 A Boom in Foresight's House. SCENE II. Angelica and Sir Sampson. Angelica and Jenny. Ang. Where is sir Sampson ? did you not tell me he would be here before me ? Sir Samp. I have not been honoured with the commands of a fair lady, a great while : \u2014 odd, madam, you have revived me ! \u2014 not since I was five-and-thirty. Ang. Why, you have no great reason to com plain, sir Sampson, that is not long ago. Sir Samp. Zooks, but it is, madam, a very great while, to a man that admires a fine woman as much as I do. Jen. He's at the great glass in the dining-room, madam, setting his cravat and wig. Ang. How ! I'm glad on't. \u2014 If he has a mind I should like him, it's a sign he likes me ; and that's more than half my design. Jen. I hear him, madam. Ang. Leave me ; and d'ye hear, if Valentine should come or send, I am not to be spoken with. Ang. You're an absolute courtier, sir Sampson. Sir Samp. Not at all, madam ; odsbud you wrong me ; I am not so old neither to be a bare"], [324, "230 LOVE FOR LOVE. ACT V. courtier, only a man of words : odd, I have warm blood about me yet, and can serve a lady any way. \u2014 Come, come, let me tell you, you women think a man old too soon, faith and troth, you do ! \u2014 Come, don't despise fifty; odd, fifty, in a hale constitution, is no such contemptible age. Ang. Fifty a contemptible age ! not at all, a very fashionable age, I think. \u2014 I assure you, I know very considerable beaux that set a good face upon fifty : \u2014 fifty ! I have seen fifty in a side-box, by candle-light, out-blossom five-and-twenty. Sir Samp. Outsides, outsides ; a pize take 'em, mere outsides ! hang your side-box beaux ! no, I'm none of those, none of your forced trees, that pretend to blossom in the fall, and bud when they should bring forth fruit ; I am of a long-lived race, and inherit vigour : none of my ancestors married till fifty ; yet they begot sons and daughters till fourscore ; I am of your patriarchs, I, a branch of one of your antediluvian families, fellows that the flood could not wash away. Well, madam, what are your commands ? has any young rogue affronted you, and shall I cut his throat ? or \u2014 Ang. No, sir Sampson, I have no quarrel upon my hands \u2014 I have more occasion for your conduct than your courage at this time. To tell you the truth, I'm weary of living single, and want a husband. Ang. Sir Sampson, as your friend, I must tell you, you are very much abused in that matter : he's no more mad than you are. Sir Samp. How, madam ! would I could prove it ! Ang. I can tell you how that maybe done. \u2014 But it is a thing that would make me appear to be too much concerned in your affairs. Sir Samp. [Aside.] Odsbud, 1 believe she likes me! \u2014 [Aloud.] Ah, madam, all my affairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your feet ; and I wish, madam, they were in a better posture, that I might make a more becoming offer to a lady of your incomparable beauty and merit. \u2014 If I had Peru in one hand, and Mexico in t'other, and the eastern empire under my feet, it would make me only a more glorious victim to be offered at the shrine of your beauty. Ang. Bless me, sir Sampson, what's the matter ? Sir Samp. Odd, madam, I love you ! \u2014 and if you would take my advice in a husband \u2014 Ang. Hold, hold, sir Sampson. I asked your advice for a husband, and you are giving me your consent. \u2014 I was indeed thinking to propose some thing like it in jest, to satisfy you about Valentine : for if a match were seemingly carried on between you and me, it would oblige him to throw off his disguise of madness, in apprehension of losing me : for you know he has long pretended a passion for me. Sir Samp. Odsbud, and 'tis pity you should ! \u2014 [Aside.] Odd, would she would like me, then I should hamper my young rogues : odd, would she would ; faith and troth she's devilish handsome ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Madam, you deserve a good husband, and 'twere pity you should be thrown away upon any of these young idle rogues about the town. Odd, there's ne'er a young fellow worth hanging ! \u2014 that is a very young fellow \u2014 Pize on 'em ! they never think beforehand of anything ; \u2014 and if they commit matrimony, 'tis as they commit murder ; out of a frolic, and are ready to hang themselves, or to be hanged by the law, the next morning : \u2014 odso, have a care, madam. Ang. Therefore I ask your advice, sir Sampson: I have fortune enough to make any man easy that I can like ; if there were such a thing as a young agreeable man with a reasonable stock of good nature and sense For I would neither have an absolute wit nor a fool. \u2022 Sir Samp. Gadzooks, a most ingenious contriv ance ! \u2014 if we were to go through with it. But why must the match only be seemingly carried on ? \u2014 Odd, let it be a real contract. Ang. O fy, sir Sampson ! what would the world say ? Sir Samp. Say ! they would say you were a wise woman and I a happy man. Odd, madam, I'll love you as long as I live, and leave you a good jointure when I die. Ang. Ay ; but that is not in your power, sir Sampson ; for when Valentine confesses himself in his senses, he must make over his inheritance to his younger brother. Sir Samp. Odd, you're cunning, a wary hag gage ! faith and troth, I like you the better. \u2014 But, I warrant you, I have a proviso in the obligation in favour of myself. \u2014 Body o'me, I have a trick to turn the settlement upon the issue male of our two bodies begotten. Odsbud, let us find children, and I'll find un estate. Ang. Will you ? well do you find the estate, and leave the other to me. Sir Samp. Odd, you are hard to please, madam ; to find a young fellow that is neither a wit in his own eye, nor a fool in the eye of the world, is a very hard task. But, faith and troth, you speak very discreetly ; for I hate both a wit and a fool. Sir Samp. O rogue ! but I'll trust you. And will you consent I is it a match then ? Ang. Let me consult my lawyer concerning this obligation ; and if I find what you propose prac ticable, I'll give you my answer. Sir Samp. WTith all my heart : come in with me. and I'll lend you the bond You shall consult vour lawyer, and I'll consult a parson. Odzooks I'm a young man : odzooks, I'm a young man, and I'll make it appear. Odd, you're devilish handsome : faith and troth, you're very handsome ; and I'm very young, and very lusty. Odsbul, hussy, you know how to choose, and so do I ; \u2014 odd, I think we are very well met. Give me your hand, odd, let me kiss it ; 'tis as warm and as soft \u2014 as what ? \u2014 Odd, as t'other hand ; give me t'other hand, and I'll mumble 'em and kiss 'em till they melt in my mouth. Ang. She that marries a fool, sir Sampson, forfeits the reputation of her honesty or under standing : and she that marries a very witty man is a slave to the severity and insolent conduct of hor husband. I should like a man of wit for a lover, because I would have such a one in my power ; but I would no more be his wife than his enemy. For his malice is not a more terrible consequence of his aversion than his jealousy is of his love. Sir Samp. None of old Foresight's Sibyls ever uttered such a truth. Odsbud, you have won my heart ! 1 hate a wit ; I had a son that was spoiled among 'em ; a good hopeful lad, till he learned to be a wit \u2014 and might have risen in the state. \u2014 But a pox on't ! his wit run him out of his money, and now his poverty has run him out of his wits."], [325, "SCENE V. LOVE FOR LOVE. 231 Ang. Hold, sir Sampson : you're profuse of your vigour before your time : you'll spend your estate before you come to it. Sir Samp. No, no, only give you a rent-roll of my possessions, \u2014 ha ! baggage ! \u2014 I warrant yon for little Sampson : odd, Sampson's a very good name for an able fellow : your Sampsons were strong dogs from the beginning. Ang. Have a care, and don't overact your part. If you remember, Sampson, the strongest of the name, pulled an old house over his head at last. Sir Samp. Say you so, hussy ? Come, let's go then ; odd, I long to be pulling too, come away. \u2014 Odso, here's somebody coming. Jer. 'Tis an act of charity, sir, to save a fine woman with thirty thousand pounds, from throwing herself away. Tat. So 'tis, faith. I might have saved several others in my time ; but egad I could never find in my heart to marry anybody before. Jer. Well, sir, I'll go and tell her my master's coming ; and meet you in half a quarter of an hour, with your disguise, at your own lodgings. You must talk a little madly, she won't distinguish the tone of your voice. Tat. No, no, let me alone for a counterfeit ; I'll be ready for you. SCENE IV. SCENE III. Tattle and Miss Prue. Tattle and Jeremy. Prue. O Mr. Tattle, are you here ! I'm glad I have found you ; I have been looking up and down for you like anything, 'till I am as tired as any thing in the world. Tat. O pox, how shall I get rid of this foolish girl ! [Aside. Prue. O I have pure news, I can tell you pure news. I must not marry the seaman now \u2014 my father says so. WThy won't you be my husband ? you say you love me, and you won't be my hus band. And I know you may be my husband now if you please. Tat. O fy, miss ! who told you so, child ? Prue. Why, my father. I told him that you loved me. Tat. Is not that she, gone out just now ? Jer. Ay, sir, she's just going to the place of appointment. Ah, sir, if you are not very faithful and close in this business, you'll certainly be the death of a person that has a most extraordinary passion for your honour's service. Tat. Ay, who's that ? Jer. Even my unworthy self, sir. Sir, I have had an appetite to be fed with your commands a great while ; and now, sir, my former master having much troubled the fountain of his understanding, it is a very plausible occasion for me to quench my thirst at the spring of your bounty. I thought I could not recommend myself better to you, sir, than by the delivery of a great beauty and fortune into your arms, whom I have heard you sigh for. Tat. I'll make thy fortune ; say no more. Thou art a pretty fellow, and canst carry a message to a lady, in a pretty soft kind of phrase, and with a good persuading accent. Jer. Sir, I have the seeds of rhetoric and oratory in my head ; I have been at Cambridge. Tat. Ay ! 'tis well enough for a servant to be bred at a university : but the education is a little too pedantic for a gentleman. I hope you are secret in your nature, private, close, ha ? Jer. O sir, for that, sir, 'tis my chief talent : I'm as secret as the head of Nilus. Tat. O fy, miss ! why did you do so ? and who told you so, child ? Prue. Who ! why you did ; did not you ? Tat. O pox ! that was yesterday, miss, that was a great while ago, child. I have been asleep since ; slept a whole night, aud did not so much as dream of the matter. Prue. Pshaw! O but I dreamt that it was so though. Tat. Ay, but your father will tell you that dreams come by contraries, child. O fy ! what, we must not love one another now \u2014 pshaw, that would be a foolish thing indeed ! Fy ! fy ! you're a woman now, and must think of a new man every morning, and forget him every night. \u2014 No, no, to marry is to be a child again, and play with the same rattle always ; O fy ! marrying is a paw thing. Prue. Well, but don't you love me as well as you did last night then ? Tat. No, no, child, you would not have me. Prue. No ! yes, but I would though. Tat. Pshaw ! but I tell you, you would not \u2014 You forget you're a woman, and don't know your own mind. Tat. Ay ! who is he, though ? a privy counsel lor ? Jer. [Aside.] O ignorance ! \u2014 [Aloud.] A cun ning Egyptian, sir, that with his arms would overrun the country; yet nobody could ever find out his head-quarters. Tat. Close dog ! a good whoremaster, I warrant him. The time draws nigh, Jeremy. Angelica will be veiled like a nun ; and I must be hooded like a friar ; ha, Jeremy ? Jer. Ay, sir, hooded like a hawk, to seize at first sight upon the quarry. It is the whim of my mas ter's madness to be so dressed ; and she is so in love with him, she'll comply with anything to please him. Poor lady, I'm sure she'll have reason to pray for me, when she finds what a happy exchange she has made, between a madman and so accomplished a gentleman. Tat. Ay, faith, so she will, Jeremy ; you're a good friend to her, poor creature. I swear I do it hardly so much in consideration of myself as com passion to her. Prue. But here's my father, and he knows my mind. SCENE V Tattle, Miss Prue, and Foresight. Fore. O, Mr. Tattle, your servant, you are a close man ; but methinks your love to my daughter was a secret I might have been trusted with ; or had you a mind to try if I could discover it by my art? Hum, ha! I think there is something in"], [326, "232 LOVE FOR LOVE ACT V your physiognomy that has a resemblance of her ; and the girl is like me. Tat. And so you would infer, that you and I are alike ? \u2014 [Aside] What does the old prig mean ? I'll banter him, aud laugh at him, and leave him. \u2014 [Aloud.] I fancy you have a wrong notion of faces. SCENE VII. Foresight, Mis9 Prue, Scandal, Mrs. Foresight, and Nurse. Fore. Did he so ? I'll despatch him for it pre sently ; rogue ! \u2014 Oh, nurse, come hither. Nurse. What is your worship's pleasure ? Fore. Here take your young mistress, and lock her up presently, till farther orders from me. \u2014 Not a word, hussy. Do what I bid you ; no reply ; away 1 And bid Robin make ready to give an account of his plate and linen, d'ye hear : begone when I bid you. Mrs. Fore. What is the matter, husband ? Fore. 'Tis not convenient to tell you now. \u2014 Mr. Scandal, heaven keep us all in our senses ! \u2014 I fear there is a contagious frenzy abroad. How does Valentine ? Fore. How ? what ? a wrong notion ! how so ? Tat. In the way of art : I have some taking fea tures, not obvious to vulgar eyes ; that are indica tions of a sudden turn of good fortune in the lottery of wives ; and promise a great beauty and great fortune reserved alone for me, by a private intrigue of destiny, kept secret from the piercing eye of per spicuity ; from all astrologers and the stars them selves. Fore. How ? I will make it appear that what you say is impossible. Tat. Sir, I beg your pardon, I'm in haste \u2014 Fore. For what ? Scan. O, I hope he will do well again : \u2014 I have a message from him to your niece Angelica. Fore. I think she has not returned since she went abroad with Sir Sampson. \u2014 Nurse, why are you not gone ? Tat. To be married, sir, married. Fore. Ay, but pray take me along with you, sir \u2014 Tat. No, sir ; 'tis to be done privately. I never make confidants. Fore. W7ell, but my consent I mean \u2014 You won't marry my daughter without my consent ? Tat. Who, I, sir? I'm an absolute stranger to you and your daughter, sir. Fore. Heyday ! what time of the moon is this ? Tat. Very true, sir, and desire to continue so. I have no more love for your daughter than I have likeness of you ; and I have a secret in my heart, which you would be glad to know, and shan't know ; and yet you shall know it too, and be sorry for it afterwards. I'd have you to know, sir, that I am as knowing as the stars, and as secret as the night. And I'm going to be married just now, yet did not know of it half an hour ago ; and the lady stays for me, and does not know of it yet. There's a mystery for you ! \u2014 I know you love to untie diffi culties \u2014 or if you can't solve this, stay here a quarter of an hour, and I'll come and explain it to you. SCENE VIII, Foresight, Scandal, Mrs. Foresight, and Ben. Airs. Fore. Here's Mr. Benjamin ; he can tell us if his father be come home. Ben. Who, father ? ay, he's come home with a vengeance. Mrs. Fore. Why, what's the matter ? Ben. Matter ! why, he's mad. Fore. Mercy on us ! I was afraid of this. Ben. And there's the handsome young woman, she, as they say, brother Val went mad for, she's mad too, I think. Fore. O my poor niece, my poor niece, is she gone too ? Well, I shall run mad next. Mrs. Fore. Well, but how mad? how d'ye mean ? Ben. Nay, I'll give you leave to guess : \u2014 I'll undertake to make a voyage to Antegoa \u2014 no, hold, I mayn't say so neither \u2014 but I'll sail as far as Leg horn, and back again, before you shall guess at the matter, and do nothing else ; mess, you may take in all the points of the compass, and not hit right. Mrs. Fore. Your experiment will take up a little too much time. SCENE VI. Foresight and Miss Prue, Prue. O father, why will you let him go ? won't you make him to be my husband ? Fore. Mercy on us ! what do these lunacies portend ? \u2014 Alas ! he's mad, child, stark wild. Prue. What, and must not I have e'er a hus band then ? What, must I go to bed to nurse again, and be a child as long as she's an old woman ? Indeed but I won't ; for now my mind is set upon a man, I will have a man some way or other. Oh! methinks I'm sick when I think of a man ; and if I can't have one, I would go to sleep all my life : for when I'm awake it makes me wish and long, and I don't know for what: \u2014 and I'd rather be always asleep, than sick with thinking. Ben. Why then I'll tell you ; there's a new wedding upon the stocks, and they two are a-going to be married to night. Scan. Who ? Ben. Why, father, and \u2014 the young woman. I can't hit of her name. Scan. Angelica? Ben. Ay, the same. Airs. Fore. Sir Sampson and Angelica? im possible ! Ben. That may be \u2014 but I'm sure it is as I tell you. Fore. O fearful ! I think the girl's influenced too. \u2014 Hussy, you shall have a rod. Prue. A fiddle of a rod ! I'll have a husband : and if you won't get me one. I'll get one for myself. I'll marry our Robin the butler ; he sayT9 he loves me, and he's a handsome man, and shall be my husband : I warrant he'll be my husband, and thank me too, for he told me so. Scan. 'Sdeath, it's a jest ! I can't believe it. Ben. Look you, friend, it's nothing to me whether you believe it or no. What 1 say is true, d'ye see; they are married, or just going to be married, I know not which."], [327, "SCENE XI. LOVE FOR LOVE. 233 Fore. Well, but they are not mad, that is, not do you bring your forecastle jests upon your father ? but I shall be even with you, I won't give you a groat. \u2014 Mr. Buckram, is the conveyance so worded that nothing can possibly descend to this scoundrel ? I would not so much as have him have the pro spect of an estate ; though there were no way to come to it but by the north-east passage. Buck. Sir, it is drawn according to your direc tions, there is not the least cranny of the law unstopped. Ben. Lawyer, I believe there's many a cranny and leak unstopped in your conscience. \u2014 If so be that one had a pump to your bosom, I believe we should discover a foul hold.

I don't know what you may call madness ; but she's mad for a husband, and he's horn mad, I think, or they'd ne'er make a match together. \u2014 Here they come. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE IX Foresight, Scandal, Mrs. Foresight, Ben, Sir Sampson, Angelica, and Buckram. Sir Samp. Where is this old soothsayer ? this uncle of mine elect ? \u2014 Aha ! old Foresight, uncle Foresight, wish me joy, uncle Foresight, double joy, both as uncle and astrologer ; here's a con junction that was not foretold in all your Ephe meris. The brightest star in the blue firmament \u2014 is shot from above in a jelly of love, and so forth ; and I'm lord of the ascendant. Odd, you're an old fellow, Foresight, uncle I mean ; a very old fellow, uncle Foresight ; and yet you shall live to dance at my wedding, faith and troth you shall. Odd, we'll have the music of the spheres for thee, old Lilly, that we will, and thou shalt lead up a dance in via lactea .' Sir Samp. Hold your tongue, sirrah ! \u2014 How now ? who's here ? SCENE XI. Sir Sampson, Angelica, Foresight, Mrs. Foresight, Ben, Buckram, Tattle, and Mrs. Frail. Frail. O sister, the most unlucky accident ! Airs. Fore. What's the matter ? Fore. I'm thunderstruck ! \u2014 You are not married to my niece ? Tat. Oh, the two most unfortunate poorcreatures in the world we are 1 Sir Samp. Not absolutely married, uncle ; but very near it, within a kiss of the matter, as you see. [Kisses Angelica. Fore. Bless us ! how so ? Frail. Ah, Mr. Tattle and I, poor Mr. Tattle and I are\u2014 I can't speak it out. Tat. Nor I \u2014 but poor Mrs. Frail and I are \u2014 Frail. Married. Ang. 'Tis very true, indeed, uncle ; I hope you'll be my father, and give me. Sir Samp. That he shall, or I'll burn his globes. Body o'me, he shall be thy father, I'll make him thy father, and thou shalt make me a father, and I'll make thee a mother, and we'll beget sons and daughters enough to put the weekly bills out of countenance. Airs. Fore. Married ! How ? Tat. Suddenly \u2014 before we knew where we were \u2014 that villain Jeremy, by the help of disguises, tricked us into one another. Fore. Why, you told me just now, you went hence in haste to be married. Scan. Death and hell ! where's Valentine ? Ang. But I believe Mr. Tattle meant the favour to me ; I thank him. Tat. I did, as I hope to be saved, madam ; my intentions were good. \u2014 But this is the most cruel thing, to marry one does not know how, nor why, nor wherefore. \u2014 The devil take me if ever I was so much concerned at anything in my life 1 SCENE X. Sir Sampson, Angelica, Foresight, Mrs. Foresight, Ben, and Buckram. Mrs. Fore. This is so surprising \u2014 Sir Samp. How ! what does my aunt say ? Surprising, aunt ! not at all, for a young couple to make a match in winter : not at all. \u2014 It's a plot to undermine cold weather, and destroy that usurper of a bed called a warming-pan. Ang. 'Tis very unhappy, if you don't care for one another. Tat. The least in the world ; \u2014 that is, for my part ; I speak for myself. Gad, I never had the least thought of serious kindness : \u2014 I never liked anybody less in my life. Poor woman ! gad, I'm sorry for her, too ; for 1 have no reason to hate her neither ; but I believe I shall lead her a damned sort of a life. Mrs. Fore. I'm glad to hear you have so much fire in you, sir Sampson. Ben. Mess, I fear his fire's little better than tinder : mayhap it will only serve to light up a match for somebody else. The young woman's a handsome young woman, I can't deny it ; but father, if I might be your pilot in this case, you should not marry her. It's just the same thing, as if so be you should sail so far as the Straits without provision. Sir Samp. Who gave you authority to speak, sirrah ? To your element, fish ! be mute, fish, and to sea! rule your helm, sirrah, don't direct me. Ben. Well, well, take you care of your own helm, or you mayn't keep your new vessel steady. Sir Samp. Why, you impudent tarpaulin! sirrah, Airs. Fore. [Aside to Mrs. Frail.] He's better than no husband at all \u2014 though he's a coxcomb. Frail. [Aside to Mrs. Foresight] Ay, ay, it's well it's no worse. \u2014 [Aloud.] Nay, for my part I always despised Mr. Tattle of all things ; nothing but his being my husband could have made me like him less. Tat. Look you there, I thought as much ! \u2014 Pox on't, I wish we could keep it secret ! why I don't believe any of this company would speak of it. Frail. But, my dear, that's impossible ; the parson and that rogue Jeremy will publish it."], [328, "LOVE FOR LOVE. act v. 234 tions have a better right to dispose of my person, than yours. Tat. Ay, my dear, so they will, as you say. Ang. O you'll agree very well in a little time ; custom will make it easy to you. Tat. Easy ! pox on't ! I don't believe I shall sleep to-night. Sir Samp. Sleep, quotha ! no ; why you would not sleep o' your wedding night ! I'm an older fellow than you, and don't mean to sleep. Ben. Why, there's another match now, as tho'f a couple of privateers were looking for a prize, and should fall foul of one another. I'm sorry for the young man with all my heart. Look you, friend, if I may advise you, when she's going, for that you must expect. I have experience of her, when she's going, let 'her go. For no matrimony is tough enough to hold her, and if she can't drag her anchor along with her, she'll break her cable, I can tell you that.\u2014 Who's here ? the madman ? Sir Samp. Are you answered now, sir ? Val. Yes, sir. Sir Samp. Where's your plot, sir ? and your contrivance now, sir? Will you sign, sir ? come, will you sign and seal ? Val. With all my heart, sir. Scan. 'Sdeath, you are not mad indeed, to ruin yourself? Val. I have been disappointed of my only hope ; and he that loses hope may part with anything. I never valued fortune, but as it was subservient to my pleasure ; and my only pleasure was to please this lady ; I have made many vain attempts, and find at last that nothing but my ruin can effect it ; which, for that reason, I will sign to. \u2014 Give me the raPer- \u201e -.,... Ang. Generous Valentine ! [Aside. Buck. Here is the deed, sir. Val. But where is the bond, by which I am \u2014 -\u2666 \u2014 obliged to sign this ? Buck. Sir Sampson, you have it. Ang. No, I have it ; and I'll use it, as I would everything that is an enemy to Valentine. [Tears the paper. SCENE XII.

No ; here's the fool ; and, if occasion be, I'll give it under my hand. Ang. [To Valentine.] Had I the world to give you, it could not make me worthy of so gene rous and faithful a passion ; here's my hand, my heart was always yours, and struggled very hard to make this utmost trial of your virtue. Val. Between pleasure and amazement, I am lost. \u2014 But on my knees I take the blessing. Sir Samp. Oons, what is the meaning of this ? Ben. Mess, here's the wind changed again !

What, have you found your senses at last then ? in good time, sir. Val. You were abused, sir, I never was dis tracted. Fore. How, not mad ! Mr. Scandal ? Scan. No, really, sir ; I'm his witness, it was all counterfeit. Val. I thought I had reasons But it was a poor contrivance ; the effect has shown it such. Sir Samp. Contrivance ! what, to cheat me ? to cheat your father ? sirrah, could you hope to prosper ? Val. Indeed, I thought, sir, when the father endeavoured to undo the son, it was a reasonable return of nature. Ang. Well, sir Sampson, since I have played you a trick, I'll advise you how you may avoid such another. Learn to be a good father, or you'll never get a second wife. I always loved your son, and hated your unforgiving nature. I was resolved to try him to the utmost ; I have tried you too, and know you both. You have not more faults than he has virtues ; and 'tis hardly more pleasure to me, that I can make him and myself happy, than that I can punish you. Sir Samp. Very good, sir! \u2014 Mr. Buckram, are you ready? \u2014 [To Valentine.] Come, sir, will you sign and seal ? Val. If you please, sir ; but first I would ask this lady one question. Sir Samp. Sir, you must ask me leave first That lady ! no, sir ; you shall ask that lady no questions, till you have asked her blessing, sir ; that lady is to be my wife. Val. I have heard as much, sir ; but I would have it from her own mouth. Val. If my happiness could receive addition, this kind surprise would make it double. Sir Samp. Oons, you're a crocodile ! Fore. Really, sir Sampson, this is a sudden eclipse. Sir Samp. You're an illiterate old fool, and I'm another ! [Exit. Tat. If the gentleman is in disorder for want of a wife, I can spare him mine. \u2014 [\"To Jeremy.] Oh, are you there, sir ? I'm indebted to you for my happiness. Jer. Sir, I ask you ten thousand pardons ; 'twas an arrant mistake. \u2014 You see, sir, my master was never mad, or anything like it : \u2014 then how could it be otherwise ? Sir Samp. That's as much as to say, I lie, sir, and you don't believe what I say. Val. Pardon me, sir. But I reflect that I very lately counterfeited madness ; I don't know but the frolic may go round.

Ang. 'Tis an unreasonable accusation, that you lay upon our sex : you tax us with injustice, oidy to cover your own want of merit. You would all have the reward of love ; but few have the con stancy to stay till it becomes your due. Men are generally hypocrites and infidels, they pretend to worship, but have neither zeal nor faith : how few, like Valentine, would persevere even to martyrdom, and sacrifice their interest to their constancy !

BRACEGIRDLE Sure Providence at first design'd this place To be the player's refuge in distress ; For still in every storm they all run hither, As to a shed that shields 'em from the weather. But thinking of this change which last befel us, It's like what I have heard our poets tell us : For when behind our scenes their suits are pleading, To help their love sometimes they show their read- ing; And wanting ready cash to pay for hearts, They top their learning on us and their parts. Once of philosophers they told us stories, Whom, as I think, they call'd \u2014 Py \u2014 Pythagories; \u2014 I'm sure 'tis some such Latin name they give 'em, And we, who know no better, must believe 'em. Now to these men (say they) such souls were given, That after death ne'er went to hell nor heaven, But lived, I know not how, in beasts ; and then, When many years were pass'd, in men again. Methinks, we players resemble such a soul ; \u25a0 That, does from bodies, we from houses stroll. Thus Aristotle's soul, of old that was. May now be damn'd to animate an ass ; Or in this very house, for aught we know, Is doing painful penance in some beau : And thus, our audience, which did once resort To shining theatres to see our sport, Now find us toss'd into a tennis-court. These walls but t'other day were filrd with noise Of roaring gamesters, and your damme boys ; Then bounding balls and rackets they encompass, And now they're fill'd with jests, and flights, and bombast I I vow, I don't much like this transmigration, Strolling from place to place by circulation; Grant, Heaven, we don't return to our first station ! I know not what these think, but, for my part, I can't reflect without an aching heart, How we should end in our original, a cart. But we can't fear, since you're so good to save us, That you have only set us up, \u2014 to leave us. Thus from the past, we hope for future grace, I beg it And some here know I have a begging face. Then pray continue this your kind behaviour, For a clear stage won't do, without your favour."], [330, "THE MOURNING BRIDE. & \u0152ragetrg.

Madam,\u2014 That high station which hy your birth you hold above the people, exacts from every one, as a duty, whatever honours they are capable of paying to your Royal Highness : but that more exalted place to which your virtues have raised you above the rest of princes, makes the tribute of our admiration and praise rather a choice more immediately preventing that duty. The public gratitude is ever founded on a public benefit ; and what is universally blessed, is always a universal blessing. Thus from yourself we derive the offerings which we bring ; and that incense which arises to your name, only returns to its original, and but naturally requites the parent of its being. From hence it is that this poem, constituted on a moral whose end is to recommend and to encourage virtue, ct consequence has recourse to your Royal Highness's patronage; aspiring to cast itself beneath your feet, and declining approbation, till you shall condescend to own it, and vouchsafe to shine upon it as on a creature of your influence. It is from the example of princes that virtue becomes a fashion in the people ; for even they who are averse to instruction will yet be fond of imitation. But there are multitudes who never can have means nor opportunities of so near an access, as to partake of the benefit of such examples. And to these Tragedy, which distinguishes itself from the vulgar poetry by the dignity of its characters, may be of use and information. For they who are at that distance from original greatness as to be deprived of the happiness of contemplating the perfections and real excellences of your Royal Highness's person in your court, may yet behold some small sketches and imagings of the virtues of your mind, abstracted and represented on the theatre. Thus poets are instructed, and instruct ; not alone by precepts which persuade, but also by examples which illustrate. Thus is delight interwoven with instruction ; when not only virtue is prescribed, but also represented. But if we are delighted with the liveliness of a feigned representation of great and good persons and their actions, how must we be charmed with beholding the persons themselves ! If one or two excelling qualities, barely touched in the single action and small compass of a play, can warm an audience, with a eoncern and regard even for the seeming success and prosperity of the actor : with what zeal must the hearts of all be filled for the continued and increasing happiness of those who are the true and living instances of elevated and persisting virtue ! Even the vicious themselves must have a secret veneration for those peculiar graces and endowments which are daily so eminently conspicuous in your Royal Highness ; and, though repining, feel a pleasure which, in spite of envy, they perforce approve. If in this piece, humbly offered to your Royal Highness, there shall appear the resemblance of any of those many excellences which you so promiscuously possess, to be drawn so as to merit your least approbation, it has the end and accomplishment of its design. And however imperfect it may be in the whole, through the inexperience or incapacity of the author, yet, if there is so much as to convince your Royal Highness, that a play may be with industry so disposed (in spite of the licentious practice of the modern theatre) as to become sometimes an innocent, and not unprofitable entertainment ; it will abundantly gratify tho ambition, and recompense the endeavours of your Royal Highness's most obedient, and most humbly devoted servant, \"WILLIAM CONGREVE.

And a less number new would well content ye. New plays did then like almanacs appear ; And one was thought sufficient for a year : Though they are more like almanacs of late ; For in one year, I think, they're out of date. Nor were they without reason join'd together; For just as one prognosticates the weather, How plentiful the crop, or scarce the grain, What peals of thunder, and what showers of rain So t'other can foretell, by certain rules, What crops of coxcombs, or what floods of fools. In such like prophecies were poets skill'd, Which now they find in their own tribe fulfill'd : The dearth of wit they did so long presage, Is fallen on us, and almost starves the stage. Were you not grieved as often as you saw Poor actors thrash such empty sheafs of straw ? Toiling and labouring at their lungs' expense, To start a jest, or force a little sense. Hard fate for us ! still harder in the event ; Our authors sin, but we alone repent. Still they proceed, and, at our charge, write worse; 'Twere some amends if they could reimburse : But there's the devil, though their cause is lost, There's no recovering damages or cost. Good wits, forgive this liberty we take, Since custom gives the losers leave to speak. But if provoked, your dreadful wrath remains, Take your revenge upon the coming scenes : For that damn'd poet's spared who damns a brother, As one thief 'scapes that executes another. Thus far alone does to the wits relate; But from the rest we hope a better fate. To please and move has been our poet's theme, Art may direct, but nature is his aim ; And nature miss'd, in vain he boasts his art, For only nature can affect the heart. Then freely judge the scenes that shall ensue ; But as with freedom, judge with candour too. He would not lose through prejudice his cause, Nor would obtain precariously applause ; Impartial censure he requests from all, Prepared by just decrees to stand or fall. ACT I. Have softly whisper'd, and inquired his health ; Sent in my sighs and prayers for his deliverance ; For sighs and prayers were all that I could offer. Aim. Indeed thou hast a soft and gentle nature. That thus couldst melt to see a stranger's wrongs. O Leonora, hadst thou known Anselmo, How would thy heart have bled to see his sufferings ! Thou hadst no cause, but general compassion. Leon. Love of my royal mistress gave me cause, My love of you begot my grief for him ; For I had heard that when the chance of war Had bless'd Anselmo's arms with victory, And the rich spoil of all the field, and you, The glory of the whole, were made the prey Of his success ; that then, in spite of hate, Revenge, and that hereditary feud Between Valentia's and Granada's kings, He did endear himself to your affection, By all the worthy and indulgent ways His most industrious goodness could invent ; Proposing by a match between AlphonBO His son, the brave Valentia prince, and you, To end the long dissension, and unite ' The jarring crowns. Aim. Alphonso ! O Alphonso ! Thou too art quiet \u2014 long hast been at peace \u2014 Both, both \u2014 father and son are now no more. Then why am I ? O when shall I have rest ? Why do I live to say you are no more ? Why are all these things thus .' \u2014 Is it of force ? Is there necessity I must be miserable?

The curtain rising slowly to soft music, discovers Almeria in mourning, Leonora waiting in mourning. After the music, Almeria rises from her chair and comes forward. Aim. Music has charms to soothe a savage breast, To soften rocks, or bend a knotted oak. I've read that things inanimate have moved, And, as with living souls, have been inform'd, By magic numbers and persuasive sound. What then am I ? Am I more senseless grown Than trees or flint ? O force of constant woe ! 'Tis not in harmony to calm my griefs. Anselmo sleeps, and is at peace ; last night The silent tomb received the good old king ; He and his sorrows now are safely lodged Within its cold but hospitable bosom. Why am not I at peace ? Leon. Dear madam, cease, Or moderate your griefs ; there is no cause \u2014 Aim. No cause ! peace, peace ; there is eternal cause, And misery eternal will succeed. Thou canst not tell \u2014 thou hast indeed no cause. Leon. Believe me, madam, I lament Anselmo, And always did compassionate his fortune : Have often wept to see how cruelly Your father kept in chains his fellow-king : And oft at night when all have been retired, Have stolen from bed, and to his prison crept ; Where, while his jailor slept, 1 through the grate"], [332, "238 THE MOURNING BRIDE. ACT I. By some unseen hand so, as of sure consequence, They must to me bring curses, grief of heart, The last distress of life, and sure despair ? Leon. Alas, you search too far, and think too deeply ! Aim. Why was I carried to Anselmo's court ? Or there, why was I used so tenderly ? Why not ill treated like an enemy ? For so my father would have used his child. O Alphonso ! Alphonso ! Devouring seas have washed thee from my sight, No time shall rase thee from my memory ; No, I will live to be thy monument ; The cruel ocean is no more thy tomb : But in my heart thou art interr'd ; there, there, Thy dear resemblance is for ever fix'd ; My love, my lord, my husband still, though lost. Leon. Husband ! O heavens ! And bulging 'gainst a rock was dash'd in pieces ! But Heaven spared me for yet much more affliction ! Conducting them who follow'd us to shun The shoal, and save me floating on the waves, While the good queen and my Alphonso perish'd. Leon. Alas ! were you then wedded to Alphonso ? Aim. That day, that fatal day, our hands were join'd. For when my lord beheld the ship pursuing, And saw her rate so far exceeding ours ; He came to me, and begged me by my love, I would consent the priest should make us one ; That whether death or victory ensued, I might be his beyond the power of fate : The queen too did assist his suit \u2014 I granted ; And in one day, was wedded and a widow. Leon. Indeed 'twas mournful. Aim. 'Twas as I have told thee ; For which I mourn, and will for ever mourn ; Nor will I change these black and dismal robes, Or ever dry these swollen and watery eyes ; Or ever taste content, or peace of heart, While I have life, and thought of my Alphonso. Leon. Look down, good Heaven, with pity on her sorrows, And grant that time may bring her some relief. Aim. O no, time gives increase to my afflictions. The circling hours, that gather all the woes, Which are diffused through the revolving year, Come, heavy-laden with the oppressing weight, To me ; with me, successively, they leave The sighs, the tears, the groans, the restless cares, And all the damps of grief, that did retard their flight ; They shake their downy wings, and scatter all The dire collected dews on my poor head ; Then fly with joy and swiftness from me. Leon. Hark ! The distant shouts proclaim your father's triumph. [Shouts at a distance. O cease, for heaven's sake, assuage a little This torrent of your grief ; for much I fear 'Twill urge his wrath to see you drown'd in tears, When joy appears in every other face. Aim. And joy he brings to every other heart, But double, double weight of woe to mine ; For with him Garcia comes \u2014 Garcia, to whom I must be sacrificed, and all the vows Aim. Alas ! what have I said ? My grief has hurried me beyond all thought : I would have kept that secret ; though I know Thy love and faith to me deserve all confidence. But 'tis the wretch's comfort still to have Some small reserve of near and inward woe, Some unsuspected hoard of darling grief, Which they unseen may wail, and weep and mourn, And, glutton-like, alone devour. Leon. Indeed I knew not this. Aim. O no, thou know'st not half, Know'st nothing of my sorrows. \u2014 If thou didst \u2014 If 1 should tell thee, wouldst thou pity me ? Tell me ; I know thou wouldst, thou art com- passionate. Leon. Witness these tears ! Aim. I thank thee, Leonora, Indeed I do, for pitying thy sad mistress ; For 'tis, alas ! the poor prerogative Of greatness, to be wretched and unpitied. But I did promise I would tell thee \u2014 what ? My miseries ? thou dost already know 'em ; And when I told thee thou didst nothing know, It was because thou didst not know Alphonso: For to have known my loss, thou must have known His worth, his truth, and tenderness of love. Leon. The memory of that brave prince stands fair In all report \u2014 And I have beard imperfectly his loss I But fearful to renew your troubles past, I never did presume to ask the story. Aim. If for my swelling heart lean, I'll tell thee. I was a welcome captive in Valentia, Even on the day when Manuel my father Led on his conquering troops, high as the gates Of king Anselmo's palace ; which in rage, And heat of war, and dire revenge, he fired. The good king flying to avoid the flames, Started amidst his foes, and made captivity His fatal refuge. \u2014 Would that I had fallen Amid those flames ! \u2014 but 'twas not so decreed. Alphonso, who foresaw my father's cruelty, Had borne the queen and me on board a ship Ready to sail ; and when this news was brought, We put to sea ; but being betray'd by some Who knew our flight, we closely were pursued, And almost taken ; when a sudden storm Drove us, and those that follow'd, on the coast Of Afric ; there our vessel struck the shore, I gave my dear Alphonso basely broken. No, it shall never be ; for I will die ; First, die ten thousand deaths !\u2014 Look down, look down, [Kneels. Alphonso, hear the sacred vow I make ; One moment cease to gaze on perfect bliss, And bend thy glorious eyes to earth and me ; And thou, Anselmo, if yet thou art arrived, Through all impediments of purging fire, To that bright heaven, where my Alphonso reigns, Behold thou also, and attend my vow. If ever I do yield, or give consent, By any action, word, or thought, to wed Another lord, may then just Heaven shower down Unheard-of curses on me, greater far (If such there be in angry Heaven's vengeance) Than any I have yet endured. \u2014 And now [Rising.

I would oblige him, but he shuns my kindness ; And with a haughty mien, and stern civility, Dumbly declines all offers : if he speak, 'Tis scarce above a word ; as he were born Alone to do, and did disdain to talk ; At least, to talk where he must not command. Osm. Because captivity Has robb'd me of a dear and just revenge. Alan. I understand not that. Osm. I would not have you. Zara. That gallant Moor in battle lost a friend, Whom more than life he loved ; and the regret Of not revenging on his foes that loss Has caused this melancholy and despair. Alan. She does excuse him ; 'tis as I suspected. Alan. Such sullenness, and in a man so brave, Must have some other cause than his captivity. Did Zara, then, request he might attend her ? Gar. My lord, she did. Man. That, join'd with his behaviour, Begets a doubt. I'd have 'em watched ; perhaps Her chains hang heavier on him than his own. [To Gonsalez. Gon.

For, lingering there, in long suspense she stands, Shifting the prize in unresolving hands : Unused to wait, I broke through her delay, Fix'd her by force, and snatch'd the doubtful day. Now late I find that war is but her sport ; In love the goddess keeps her awful court : Fickle in fields, unsteadily she flies, But rules with settled sway in Zara's eyes. Afan.

Thy father is not here, my love, nor Garcia : Nor am I what I seem, but thy Alphonso. Wilt thou not know me ? Hast thou then forgot me? Hast thou thy eyes, yet canst not see Alphonso ? Am I so alter'd, or art thou so changed, That seeing my disguise, thou seest not me ? Aim. Tt is, it is Alphonso ! 'tis his face, His voice ! I know him now, I know him all. O take me to thy arms, and bear me hence, Back to the bottom of the boundless deep, To seas beneath, where thou so long hast dwelt. O how hast thou return'd ? how hast thou charm'd The wildness of the waves and rocks to this ? That thus relenting, they have given thee back To earth, to light and life, to love and me. Osm. Oh I'll not ask, nor answer how, or why We both have backward trod the paths of fate, To meet again in life ; to know I have thee, Is knowing more than any circumstance Or means by which I have thee. To fold thee thus, to press thy balmy lips, And gaze upon thy eyes, is so much joy, I have not leisure to reflect, or know, Or trifle time in thinking. Aim.

Death, grim death, will fold Me in his leaden arms, and press me close To his cold clayey breast ; my father then Will cease his tyranny ; and Garcia too Will fly my pale deformity with loathing. My soul, enlarged from its vile bonds, will mount, And range the starry orbs, and milky ways, Of that refulgent world, where I shall swim In liquid light, and float on seas of bliss To my Alphonso's soul.

Why dost thou weep, and hold thee from my arms ; My arms which ache to fold thee fast, and grow To thee with twining ? Come, come to my heart. Aim. I will, for I should never look enough.

So thou dost think ; then do but tell me so ; Tell me, and thou shalt see how I'll revenge Thee on this false one, how I'll stab and tear This heart of flint till it shall bleed ; and thou Shalt weep for mine, forgetting thy own miseries. Osm. You wrong me, beauteous Zara, to believe I bear my fortunes with so low a mind, As still to meditate revenge on all Whom chance, or fate, working by secret causes, Has made perforce subservient to that end The heavenly powers allot me ; no, not you, But destiny and inauspicious stars Have cast me down to this low being : or, Granting you had, from you I have deserved it."], [341, "THE MOURNING BRIDE.

O thou dost wound me more with this Almeria and Osmyn. Osm. My life, my health, my liberty, my all ! How shall i welcome thee to this sad place ? How speak to thee the words of joy and transport? How run into thy arms, withheld by fetters ; Or take thee into mine, while I'm thus manacled And pinion'd like a thief or murderer ? thy goodness, Than e'er thou couldst with bitterest reproaches !

Have I done this ? Tell me, am I so cursed ? Osm. Time may have still one fated hour to come, Which, wing'd with liberty, might overtake Occasion past. Zara. Swift as occasion, I Myself will fly ; and earlier than the morn Wake thee to freedom.

But behold she comes For whom I fear, to shield me from my fears, The cause and comfort of my boding heart. my heart, If there he shoot not every other shaft ; Thy second self should feel each other wound, And woe should be in equal portions dealt.

The sacred union of connubial love Yet unaccomplish'd ; his mysterious rites Delay'd ; nor has our hymeneal torch Yet lighted up his last most grateful sacrifice ; But dash'd with rain from eyes, and swaled with sighs, Burns dim, and glimmers with expiring light. Is this dark cell a temple for that god ? Or this vile earth an altar for such offerings ? This den for slaves, this dungeon damp'd with woes ; Is this our marriage-bed ? Are these our joys ? Is this to call thee mine ? Oh, hold my heart ! To call thee mine ? Yes ; thus, even thus to call Thee mine, were comfort, joy, extremest ecstacy. But O, thou art not mine, not even in misery !

But look forward ; Think on to-morrow, when thou shalt be torn From these weak, struggling, unextended arms ; Think how my heart will heave, and eyes will strain, To grasp and reach what is denied my hands ; Think how the blood will start, and tears will gush To follow thee, my separating soul ! Think how I am when thou shalt wed with Garcia ! Then will I smear these walls with blood, disfigure And dash my face, and rive my clotted hair, Break on the flinty floor my throbbing breast, And grovel with gash'd hands to scratch a grave, Stripping my nails, to tear this pavement up, And bury me alive.

Thou hast already rack'd me with thy stay, Therefore require me not to ask thee twice ; Reply at once to all. What is concluded ? Sel. Your accusation highly has incensed The king, and were alone enough to urge The fate of Osmyn ; but to that, fresh news Is since arrived of more revolted troops. 'Tis certain Heli too is fled, and with him (Which breeds amazement and distraction) some Who bore high offices of weight and trust, Both in the state and army. This confirms The king, in full belief of all you told him, Concerning Osmyn and his correspondence With them who first began the mutiny. Wherefore a warrant for his death is sign'd, And order given for public execution. Zara. Ha ! haste thee ! fly ! prevent his fate and mine ; Find out the king, tell him I have of weight More than his crown to impart ere Osmyn die. Sel. It needs not, for the king will straight be Sel. My life is yours, nor wish I to preserve it, But to serve you. I have already thought. Zara. Forgive my rage ; I know thy love and truth. But say, what's to be done ? or when, or how, Shall I prevent, or stop the approaching danger ? Sel. You must still seem more resolute and fix'd On Osmyn's death ; too quick a change of mercy Might breed suspicion of the cause. Advise That execution may be done in private. Zara. On what pretence ? Sel. Your own request's enough. However, for a colour, tell him, you Have cause to fear his guards may be corrupted, And some of them bought off to Osmyn's interest, Who, at the place of execution, will Attempt to force his way for an escape. The state of things will countenance all suspicions. Then offer to the king to have him strangled In secret by your mutes, and get an order, That none but mutes may have admittance to here ; And as to your revenge, not his own interest, Pretend to sacrifice the life of Osmyn. Zara. What shall I say? Invent, contrive, advise, Somewhat to blind the king, and save his life In whom I live. Spite of my rage and pride, I am a woman, and a lover still. O, 'tis more grief but to suppose his death, Than still to meet the rigour of his scorn. From my despair my anger had its source ; him. I can no more, the king is here.

Manuel, Gonsalez, Zara, and Selim. Zara. I am your captive, and you've used me nobly ; And in return of that, though otherwise Your enemy, I have discover'd Osmyn His private practice and conspiracy Against your state : and fully to discharge Myself of what I've undertaken, now I think it fit to tell you, that your guards Are tainted : some among 'em have resolved To rescue Osmyn at the place of death. Man. Is treason then so near us as our guards ! Zara. Most certain ; though my knowledge is So ripe, to point at the particular men. [not yet Man. What's to be done ? Gon. None, sir. Some papers have been since discover'd In Roderigo's house, who fled with him, Which seem to intimate, as if Alphonso Were still alive, and arming in Valentia : Which wears indeed this colour of a truth, They who are fled have that way bent their course. Of the same nature divers notes have been Dispersed to amuse the people ; whereupon Some ready of belief have raised this rumour ; That being saved upon the coast of Afric, He there disclosed himself to Albucacim, And by a secret compact made with him, Open'd and urged the way to this invasion ; While he himself, returning to Valentia In private, undertook to raise this tumult. Zara. [Aside.] Ha ! hear'st thou that ? Is Osmyn then Alphonso ! O Heaven I a thousand things occur at once To my remembrance now, that make it plain. O certain death for him, as sure despair For me, if it be known ! \u2014 if not, what hope Have I ? Yet 'twere the lowest baseness, now To yield him up. \u2014 No, I will still conceal him, And try the force of yet more obligations. Gon. 'Tis not impossible. Yet, it may be That some impostor has usurp'd his name. Your beauteous captive Zara can inform, If such a one, so 'scaping, was received At any time, in Albucacim's court. Man. Pardon, fair excellence, this long neglect : An unforeseen, unwelcome hour of business, Has thrust between us and our while of love ; But wearing now apace with ebbing sand, Will quickly waste, and give again the day. Zara. You're too secure ; the danger is more imminent Than your high courage suffers you to see ; While Osmyn lives, you are not safe. Man. His doom Is pass'd ; if you revoke it not, he dies. Zara. That too I will advise. I have remaining in my train some mutes, A present once from the Sultana queen, In the Grand Signior's court. These from their infancy Are practised in the trade of death ; and shall (As there the custom is) in private strangle Osmyn. Gon. My lord, the queen advises well. Man. What offering or what recompense remains In me, that can be worthy so great services ? To cast beneath your feet the crown you've saved, Though on the head that wears it, were too little. Zara. Of that hereafter ; but, meantime, 'tis fit You give strict charge, that none may be admitted To see the prisoner, but such mutes as I Shall send. Man. Who waits there ? SCENE IV.

One who did call himself Alphonso Was cast upon my coast, as is reported, And oft had private conference with the king ; To what effect I knew not then : but he, Alphonso, secretly departed, just About the time our arms embark'd for Spain. What I know more is, that a triple league Of strictest friendship was profess'd between Alphonso, Heli, and the traitor Osmyn. Man. Public report is ratified in this. SCENE V. Manuel, Gonsalez, Zara, and Selim. Gon. [Aside.] That interdiction so particular, Pronounced with vehemence against the princess, Should have more meaning than appears barefaced : The king is blinded by his love, and heeds It not. \u2014 [To Zara.] Your majesty sure might have spared That last restraint ; you hardly can suspect The princess is confederate with the Moor."], [345, "THE MOURNING BRIDE.

There's somewhat yet of mystery in this ; Her words and actions are obscure and double, Sometimes concur, and sometimes disagree ; I like it not. Alan. What dost thou think, Gonsalez ; Are we not much indebted to this fair one ? Man. Whence is thy grief? give me to know the cause, Gon. I am a little slow of credit, sir, In the sincerity of women's actions. Methinks this lady's hatred to the Moor Disquiets her too much ; which makes it seem As if she'd rather that she did not hate him. I wish her mutes are meant to be employ'd As she pretends \u2014 I doubt it now \u2014 Your guards Corrupted ! how ? by whom ? who told her so ? 1'th' evening Osmyn was to die ; at midnight Siie begg'd the royal signet to release him ; 1'th' morning he must die again ; ere noon Her mutes alone must strangle him, or he'll Escape.

What mean these tears, but grief unutterable ! Man. They are the dumb confessions of thy mind, They mean thy guilt ; and say thou wert confederate With damn'd conspirators to take my life. O impious parricide ! now canst thou speak? Aim. O earth, behold, I kneel upon thy bosom ! And bend my flowing eyes, to stream upon Thy face, imploring thee that thou wilt yield ; Open thy bowels of compassion, take Into thy womb the last and most forlorn Of all thy race. Hear me, thou common parent ! I have no parent else \u2014 be thou a mother, And step between me and the curse of him Who was \u2014 who was, but is no more a father, But brands my innocence with horrid crimes ; And for the tender names of child and daughter, Now calls me murderer and parricide.

But if she had, what was't to her ? unless She fear'd her stronger charms might cause the Affection to revolt. [Moor's Alan. I thank thee, friend. There's reason in thy doubt, and I am warn'd.

Critics to plays for the same end resort, That surgeons wait on trials in a court ; For innocence condemn'd they've no respect, Provided they've a body to dissect. As Sussex-men, that dwell upon the shore, Look out when storms arise, and billows roar, Devoutly praying, with uplifted hands, That some well-laden ship may strike the sands ; To whose rich cargo they may make pretence, And fatten on the spoils of Providence : So critics throng to see a new play split, And thrive and prosper on the wrecks of wit. Small hope our poet from these prospects draws ; And therefore to the fair commends his cause.

My Lord, \u2014 Whether the world will arraign me of vanity or not, that I have presumed to dedicate this comedy to your Lordship, I am yet in doubt ; though, it may be, it is some degree of vanity even to doubt of it. One who has at any time had the honour of your Lordship's conversation, cannot be supposed to think very meanly of that which he would prefer to your perusal ; yet it were to incur the imputation of too much sufficiency, to pretend to such a merit as might abide the test of your Lordship's censure. Whatever value may be wanting to this play while yet it is mine, will be sufficiently made up to it when it is once become your Lordship's; and it is my security, that I cannot have overrated it more by my dedication, than your Lordship will dignify it by your patronage. That it succeeded on the 6tage, was almost beyond my expectation ; for but little of it was prepared for that general taste which seems now to be predominant in the palates of our audience. Those characters which are meant to be ridiculed in most of our comedies, are of fools so gross, that, in my humble opinion, they should rather disturb than divert the well-natured and reflecting part of an audience ; they are rather objects of charity than contempt ; and instead of moving our mirth, they ought very often to excite our compassion. This reflection moved me to design some characters which should appear ridiculous, not so much through a natural folly (which is incorrigible, and therefore not proper for the stage) as through an affected wit ; a wit, which at the same time that it is affected, is also false. As there is some difficulty in the formation of a character of this nature, so there is some hazard which attends the progress of its success upon the stage ; for many come to a play so overcharged with criticism, that they very often let fly their censure, when through their rashness they have mistaken their aim. This I had occasion lately to observe ; for this play had been acted two or three days, before some of these hasty judges could find the leisure to distinguish betwixt the character of a Witwoud and a Truewit. I must beg your Lordship's pardon for this digression from the true course of this epistle ; but that it may not seem altogether impertinent, I beg that I may plead the occasion of it, in part of that excuse of which I stand in need, for recommending this comedy to your protection. It is only by the countenance of your Lordship, and the fe w so qualified, that such who write with care and pains can hope to be distinguished ; for the prostituted name of poet promiscuously levels all that bear it. Terence, the most correct writer in the world, had a Scipio and a L\u00e6lius, if not to assist him, at least to support him in his reputation ; and notwithstanding his extraordinary merit, it may be their countenance was not more than necessary. The purity of his style, the delicacy of his turns, and the justness of his characters, were all of them beauties which the greater part of his audience were incapable of tasting ; some of the coarsest strokes of Plautus, so severely censured by Horace, were more likely to affect the multitude ; such who come with expectation to laugh at the last act of a play, and are better entertained with two or three unseasonable jests, than with the artful solution of the fable. As Terence excelled in his performances, so Lad he great advantages to encourage his undertakings ; for he built most on the foundations of Menander ; his plots were generally modelled, and his characters ready drawn to his hand. He copied Menander, and Menander had no less light in the formation of his characters, from the observations of Theophrastus, of whom he was a disciple ; and Theophrastus, it is known, was not only the disciple, but the immediate successor of Aristotle, the first and greatest judge of poetry. These were great models to design by; and the further advantage which Terence possessed, towards giving his plays the due ornaments of purity of style and justness of manners, was not less considerable, from the freedom of conversation which was permitted him with L\u00e6lius and Scipio, two of the greatest and most polite men of his age. And indeed the privilege of such a conversation is the only certain means of attaining to the perfection of dialogue. If it has happened in any part of this comedy, that I have gained a turn of style or expression more correct, or at least more corrigible, than in those which I have formerly written, I must, with equal pride and gratitude, ascribe it to"], [353, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD. 259 the honour of your Lordship's admitting me into your conversation, and that of a society where everybody else was so well worthy of you. in your retirement last summer from the town; for it was immediately after that this comedy was written. If I have sailed in my performance, it is only to be regretted, where there were so many, not inferior either to a Scipio or a L\u00e6lius, that there should be one wanting equal in capacity to a Terence. If I am not mistaken, poetry is almost the only art which has not yet laid claim to your Lordship's patronage. Architecture and painting, to the great honour of our country, have flourished under your influence and protection*. In the mean time, poetry, the eldest sister of all arts, and parent of most, seems to have resigned her birthright, by having neglected to pay her duty to your Lordship, and by permitting others of a later extraction, to prepossess that place in your esteem to which none can pretend a better title. Poetry, in its nature, is sacred to the good and great ; the relation between them is reciprocal, and they are ever propitious to it.

The time equal to that of the representation PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY MR, .. BETTERTON. Op those few fools who with ill stars are curst, Sure scribbling fools, call'd poets, fare the worst : For they're a sort of fools which Fortune makes, And after she has made 'em fools, forsakes. With Nature's oafs 'tis quite a different case. For Fortune favours all her idiot-race. In her own nest the cuckoo-eggs we find, O'er which she broods to hatch the changeling-kind. No portion for her own she has to spare, So much she dotes on her adopted care. Poets are bubbles, by the town drawn in, Suffer'd at first some trifling stakes to win ; But what unequal hazards do they run ! Each time they write they venture all they've won : The squire that's butter' d still, is sure to be undone. This author heretofore has found your favour ; But pleads no merit from his past behaviour. To build on that might prove a vain presumption, Should grants, to poets made, admit resumption : And in Parnassus he must lose his seat, He owns with toil he wrought the following scenes ; But, if they're naught, ne'er spare him for his pains : Damn him the more ; have no commiseration For dulness on mature deliberation, He swears he'll not resent one hiss'd-off scene, Nor, like those peevish wits, his play maintain, Who, to assert their sense, your taste arraign. Some plot we think he has, and some new thought ; Some humour too, no farce ; but that's a fault. Satire, he thinks, you ought not to expect; For so reform'd a town who dares correct ? To please, this time, has been his sole pretence, He'll not instruct, lest it should give offence. Should he by chance a knave or fool expose, That hurts none here, sure here are none of those : In short, our play shall (with your leave to show it) Give you one instance of a passive poet, Who to your judgments yields all resignation ; So save or damn, after your own discretion. If that be found a forfeited estate. s s"], [354, "260 THE WAY OF THE WORLD. ACT I. ACT I. the week. You and I are excluded ; and it *as once proposed that all the male sex should be excepted ; but somebody moved that, to avoid scandal, there might be one man of the commu nity ; upon which motion Witwoud and Petulant were enrolled members. SCENE I A Chocolate-House. Mirabell and Fainall, rising from cards, Betty waiting. Mir. You are a fortunate man, Mr. Fainall ! Fain. Have we done ? Mir. And who may have been the foundress of this sect ? My lady Wishfort, I warrant, who publishes her detestation of mankind ; and full ol the vigour of fifty-five, declares for a friend and ratafia ; and lit posterity shift for itself, she'll breed no more. Mir. What you please : I'll play on to enter tain you. Fain. No, I'll give you your revenge another time, when you are not so indifferent ; you are thinking of something else now, and play too negligently ; the coldness of a losing gamester lessens the pleasure of the winner. I'd no more play with a man that slighted his ill fortune than I'd make love to a woman who undervalued the loss of her reputation. Fain. The discovery of your sham addresses to her, to conceal your love to her niece, has provoked this separation ; had you dissembled better, things might have continued in the state of nature. Mir. I did as much as man could, with any reasonable conscience ; I proceeded to the very last act of flattery with her, and was guilty of a song in her commendation. Nay, I got a friend to put her into a lampoon, and compliment her with the imputation of an affair with a young fellow, which I carried so far, that 1 told her the ma licious town took notice that she was grown fat of a sudden ; and when she lay in of a dropsy, persuaded her she was reported to be in labour. The devil's in't, if an old woman is to be flattered further, unless a man should endeavour downright personally to debauch her ; and that my virtue forbade me. But for the discovery of this amour I am indebted to your friend, or your wife's friend, Mrs. Marwood. Mir. You have a taste extremely delicate, and are for refining on your pleasures. Fain. Prithee, why so reserved ? Something has put you out of humour. Mir. Not at all : I happen to be grave to-day, and you are gay ; that's all. Fain. Confess, Millamant and you quarrelled last night after I left you ; my fair cousin has some humours that would tempt the patience of a Stoic. What, some coxcomb came in, and was well received by her, while you were by? Alir. Witwoud and Petulant ; and what was worse, her aunt, your wife's mother, my evil genius ; or to sum up all in her own name, my old Lady Wishfort came in. Fain. O there it is then 1 She has a lasting passion for you, and with reason. \u2014 What, then my wife was there ? Fain. What should provoke her to be your enemy, unless she has made you advances which you have slighted ? Women do not easily forgive omissions of that nature. Alir. Yes, and Mrs. Marwood, and three or four more, whom I never saw before. Seeing me, they all put on their grave faces, whispered one another ; then complained aloud of the vapours, and after fell into a profound silence. Fain. They had a mind to be rid of you. Alir. For which reason I resolved not to stir. At last the good old lady broke through her pain ful taciturnity with an invective against long visits. I would not have understood her, but Mil lamant joining in the argument, I rose, and, with a constrained smile, told her, I thought nothing was so easy as to know when a visit began to be troublesome. She reddened, and I withdrew, with out expecting her reply. Fain. You were to blame to resent what she spoke only in compliance with her aunt. Mir. She is more mistress of herself than to be under the necessity of such a resignation. Fain. What ! though half her fortune depends upon her marrying with my lady's approbation ? Mir. I was then in such a humour, that I should have been better pleased if she had been less dis creet. Fain. Now, I remember, I wonder not they were weary of you ; last night was one of their cabal nights ; they have 'em three times a-week, and meet by turns at one another's apartments, where they come together like the coroner's inquest, to sit upon the murdered reputations of Alir. She was always civil to me till of late.\u2014 I confess I am not one of those coxcombs who are apt to interpret a woman's good manners to her prejudice, and think that she who does not refuse 'em everything, can refuse 'em nothing. Fain. You are a gallant man, Mirabell; and though you may have cruelty enough not to satisfy a lady's longing, you have too much generosity not to be tender of her honour. Yet you speak with an indifference which seems to be affected, and confesses you are conscious of a negligence. Mir. You pursue the argument with a dis trust that seems to be unaffected, and confesses you are conscious of a concern for which the lady is more indebted to you than is your wife. Fain. Fy, fy, friend ! if you grow censorious I must leave you. \u2014 I'll look upon the gamesters in the next room. Alir. Who are they ? Fain. Petulant and Witwoud.\u2014 [To Betty.] Bring me some chocolate. [Exit, Mir. Betty, what says your clock ? Bet. Turned of the last canonical hour, sir. [Exit. Alir. How pertinently the jade answers me ! \u2014 [Looking on his watch.] \u2014 Ha! almost one o'clock ! \u2014 O, y 'are come !"], [355, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD.

The catalogue was so large, that I was not without hopes one day or other to hate her heartily : to which end I so used myself to think of 'era, that at length, con trary to my design and expectation, they gave me every hour less and less disturbance ; till in a few days it became habitual to me to remember 'em without being displeased. They are now grown as familiar to me as my own frailties ; and in all pro bability, in a little time longer, I shall like 'em as well. SCENE II. Mirabeli. and Footman. Mir. Well, is the grand affair over ? You have been something tedious. Fool. Sir, there's such coupling at Pancras, that they stand behind one another, as 'twere in a coun try dance. Ours was the last couple to lead up ; and no hopes appearing of despatch ; besides, the parson growing hoarse, we were afraid his lungs would have failed before it came to our turn ; so we drove round to Duke's-place ; and there they were rivetted in a trice. Fain. Marry her, marry her ! be half as well acquainted with her charms, as you are with her defects, and my life on't, you are your own man again. Afir. So, so, you are sure they are married. Foot. Married and bedded, sir ; I am witness. Alir. Have you the certificate ? Foot. Here it is, sir. Alir. Say you so ? Fain. Ay, ay, I have experience : I have a wife, and so forth. Mir. Has the tailor brought Waitwell's clothes home, and the new liveries ? Foot. Yes, sir. Alir. That's well. Do you go home again, d'ye hear, and adjourn the consummation till further orders. Bid Waitwell shake his ears, and dame Partlet rustle up her feathers, and meet me at one o'clock by Rosamond's Pond, that I may see her before she returns to her lady ; and as you tender your ears be secret. SCENE IV. Mirabell, Fainall, Betty, and Messenger. Ales. Is one squire Witwoud here ? Bet. Yes, what's your business ? Ales. I have a letter for him, from his brother sir Wilfull, which I am charged to deliver into his own hands. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 Bet. He's in the next room, friend \u2014 that way. SCENE III, Mirabell, Fainall, and Betty. Fain. Joy of your success, Mirabell ; you look SCENE V. pleased. Alir. Ay ; I have been engaged in a matter of some sort of mirth, which is not yet ripe for dis covery. I am glad this is not a cabal night. I wonder, Fainall, that you who are married, and of consequence should be discreet, will suffer your wife to be of such a party. Fain. Faith, I am not jealous. Besides, most who are engaged are women and relations ; and for the men, they are of a kind too contemp tible to give scandal. Mir. I am of another opinion. The greater the coxcomb, always the more the scandal : for a woman, who is not a fool, can have but one reason for associating with a man who is one. Mirabell, Fainall, and Betty. Mir. What, is the chief of that noble family in town, sir Wilfull Witwoud ? Fain. He is expected to-day. Do you know him ? Alir. I have seen him. He promises to be an extraordinary person ; I think you have the honour to be related to him. Fain. Yes ; he is half brother to this Witwoud by a former wife, who was sister to my lady Wishfort, my wife's mother. If you marry Milla mant, you must call cousins too. Mir. I had rather be his relation than his acquaintance. Fain. Are you jealous as often as you see Wit woud entertained by Millamant ? Mir. Of her understanding I am, if not of her person. \u25a0\u00bb Fain. You do her wrong ; for, to give her her due, she has wit. Fain. He comes to town in order to equip him self for travel. Mir. For travel 1 why, the man that I mean is above forty. Fain. No matter for that; 'tis for the honour of England, that all Europe should know we have blockheads of all ages. Alir. I wonder there is not an act of parliament to save the credit of the nation, and prohibit the exportation of fools. Fain. By no means ; 'tis better as 'tis. 'Tis better to trade with a little loss, than to be quite eaten up with being overstocked. Alir. Pray, are the follies of this knight-errant, and those of the squire his brother, anything related ? Mir. She has beauty enough to make any man think so ; and complaisance enough not to contra dict him who shall tell her so. Fain. For a passionate lover, methinks you are a man somewhat too discerning iu the failings of your mistress. Mir. And for a discerning man, somewhat too passionate a lover ; for I like her with all her faults j nay, like her for her faults. Her follies are so natural, or so artful, that they become her ; and those affectations which in another woman would be odious, serve but to make her more agreeable. I'll tell thee, Fainall, she once used me with that insolence, that in revenge I took her Fain. Not at all ; Witwoud grows by the knight, like a medlar grafted on a crab. One will melt in your mouth, and t'other set your teeth on edge ; one is all pulp, and the other all core."], [356, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD. 262 ACT I, Alir. So one will be rotten before he be ripe, and the other will be rotten without ever being ripe at all. Fain. Sir Wilfull is an odd mixture of bash fulness and obstinacy. \u2014 But when he's drunk he's as loving as the monster in the Tempest, and much after the same manner. To give t'other his due, he has something of good-nature, and does not always want wit. Mir. Not always : but as often as his memory fails him, and his common-place of comparisons. He is a fool with a good memory, and somefew scraps of other folks' wit. He is one whose conversation can never be approved, yet it is now and then to be endured. He has indeed one good quality, he is not exceptious ; for he so passionately affects the reputation of understanding raillery, that he will construe an affront into a jest ; and call downright rudeness and ill language, satire and fire. Fain. If you have a mind to finish his picture, you have an opportunity to do it at full length. Behold the original ! for I never knew a fool but he affected to complain, either of the spleen or his memory. Fain. What have you done with Petulant ? Wit. He's reckoning his money \u2014 my money it was.\u2014 I have no luck to-day. Fain. You may allow him to win of you at play : for you are sure to be too hard for him at re partee; since you monopolise the wit that is between you, the fortune must be his of course. Alir. I don't find that Petulant confesses the superiority of wit to be your talent, Witwoud. Wit. Come, come, you are malicious now, and would breed debates. \u2014 Petulant's my friend, and a very honest fellow, and a very pretty fellow, and has a smattering \u2014 faith and troth, a pretty deal of an odd sort of a small wit : nay, I'll do him justice. I'm his friend, I won't wrong him neither. \u2014 And if he had any judgment in the world, he would not be altogether contemptible. Come, come, don't detract from the merits of my friend. Fain. You don't take your friend to be over nicely bred ? Wit. No, no, hang him, the rogue has no manners at all, that I must own ; \u2014 no more breeding than a bum-bailiff, that I grant you : \u2014 'tis pity, faith ; the fellow has fire and life. SCENE VI. Mirabell, Fainall, Betty, and Witwocd. Wit. Afford me your compassion, my dears ! pity me, Fainall ! Mirabell, pity me ! Alir. I do from my soul. Fain. Why, what's the matter ? Wit. No letters for me, Betty ? Bet. Did not a messenger bring you one but now, sir? Alir. What, courage ? Wit. Hum, faith I don't know as to that, 1 can't say as to that \u2014 Yes, faith, in a controversy, he'll contradict anybody. Mir. Though 'twere a man whom he feared, or a woman whom he loved. Wit. Well, well, he does not always think before he speaks ; \u2014 we have all our failings : you are too hard upon him, you are, faith. Let me excuse him \u2014 I can defend most of his faults, except one or two : one he has, that's the truth on't ; if he were my brother, I could not acquit him : \u2014 that, indeed, I could wish were otherwise. Wit. Ay, but no other ? Bet. No, sir. Wit. That's hard, that's very hard. \u2014 A mes senger ! a mule, a beast of burden ! he has brought me a letter from the fool my brother, as heavy as a panegyric in a funeral sermon, or a copy of commendatory verses from one poet to another : and what's worse, 'tis as sure a forerunner of the author, as an epistle dedicatory. Mir. Ay marry, what's that, Witwoud ? Wit. O pardon, me ! \u2014 expose the infirmities of my friend ! \u2014 No, my dear, excuse me there. Fain. What, I warrant he's unsincere, or 'tis some such trifle. Mir. A fool, and your brother, Witwoud! Wit. Ay, ay, my half brother. My half brother he is, no nearer upon honour. Alir. Then 'tis possible he may bebut half afool. Wit. Good, good, Mirabell, le drole ! good, good ; hang him, don't let's talk of him. \u2014 Fainall, how does your lady? Gad, I say anything in the world to get this fellow out of my head. I beg pardon that I should ask a man of pleasure, and the town, a question at once so foreign and domestic. But I talk like an old maid at a mar riage ; I don't know what I say : but she's the best woman in the world. Wit. No, no ; what if he be ? 'tis no matter for that, his wit will excuse that : a wit should no more be sincere, than a woman constant ; one argues a decay of parts, as t'other of beauty. Mir. Maybe you think him too positive ? Wit. No, no, his being positive is an incentive to argument, and keeps up conversation. Fain. Too illiterate ? Wit. That ' that's his happiness : \u2014 his want of learning giveshim the more opportunities to show his natural parts. Alir. He wants words ? Fain. 'Tis well you don't know what you say, or else your commendation would go near to make me either vain or jealous. Wit. No man in town lives well with a wife but Fainall Your judgment, Mirabell. Wit. Ay: but I like him for that now; for his want of words gives me the pleasure very often to explain his meaning. Fain. He's impudent ? Wit. No, that's not it. Mir. Vain ? Alir. You had better step and ask his wife, if you would be credibly informed. Wit. Mirabell? Wit. No. Alir. Ay. Wit. My dear, I ask ten thousand pardons ; \u2014 gad, I have forgot what I was going to say to you ! Mir. I thank you heartily, heartily. Wit. No., but prithee excuse me ; \u2014 my memory is such a memory. Mir. Have a care of such apologies, Witwoud; Alir. What ! he speaks unseasonable truths sometimes, because he has not wit enough to invent an evasion ? Wit. Truths ! ha ! ha ! ha ! no, no ; since you will have it, \u2014 I mean, he never speaks truth at all, \u2014 that's all. He will lie like a chambermaid, or a woman of quality's porter.

Three gentlewomen in a coach would speak with him. Fain. O brave Petulant ! three ! Wit. Empresses, my dear : \u2014 by your what-d'ye call-'ems he means sultana queens. Pet. Ay, Roxolanas. Alir.

You must bring two dishes of chocolate and a glass of cinnamon- water. Wit. Ha ! ha ! ha !

No ; the rogue's wit and readiness of invention charm me, dear Petulant. Bet. They are gone, sir, in great anger. Pet. Enough, let 'em trundle. Anger helps complexion, saves paint. Fain. This continence is all dissembled ; this is in order to have something to brag of the next time he makes court to Millamant, and swear he has abandoned the whole sex for her sake. Mir. You are very free with your friend's acquaintance. Wit. Ay, ay, friendship without freedom is as dull as love without enjoyment, or wine without toasting. But to tell you a secret, these are trulls whom he allows coach-hire, and something more, by the week, to call on him once a-day at public places. Alir. How I Mir. Have you not left off your impudent pre tensions there yet ? I shall cut your throat some time or other, Petulant, about that business. Pet. Ay, ay, let that pass \u2014 there are other throats to be cut. Wit. You shall see he won't go to 'em, because there's no more company here to take notice of him. \u2014 Why this is nothing to what he used to do : \u2014 before he found out this way, I have known him call for himself. Alir. Meaning mine, sir ? Pet. Not I \u2014 I mean nobody \u2014 I know nothing : \u2014 but there are uncles and nephews in the world \u2014 and they may be rivals \u2014 what then ! all's one far that. Fain. Call for himself ! what dost thou mean ? Wit. Mean ! why he would slip you out of this chocolate-house, just when you had been talking to him \u2014 as soon as your back was turned \u2014 whip he was gone ! \u2014 then trip to his lodging, clap on a hood and scarf, and a mask, slap into a hackney coach, and drive hither to the door again in a trice, where he would send in for himself ; that I mean, call for himself, wait for himself; nay, and what's more, not finding himself, sometimes leave a letter for himself. Mir. How ! hark'ee, Petulant, come hither : \u2014 explain, or I shall call your interpreter. Pet. Explain ! I know nothing. \u2014 Why, you have an uncle, have you not, lately come to town, and lodges by my lady Wishfort's ? Mir. True. Pet. Why, that's enough \u2014 you and he are not friends ; and if he should marry and have a child, you may be disinherited, ha ? Mir. Where hast thou stumbled upon all this truth ? Mir. I confess this is something extraordinary. \u2014 I believe he waits for himself now, he is so long a-coming : Oh ! I ask his pardon. Pet. All's one for that ; why then say I know something. Mir. Come, thou art an honest fellow, Petulant, and shalt make love to my mistress, thou 6ha't, faith. What hast thou heard of my uncle ? Pet. I ? nothing, I. If throats are to be cut, let swords clash! snug's the word, I shrug and am silent. Alir. Oh, raillery, raillery!

Ay, we'll all walk in the Park ; the ladies talked of being there. Mir. I thought you were obliged to watch for your brother sir Wilfull's arrival. Wit. No, no ; he comes to his aunt's, my lady Wishfort. Pox on him ! I shall be troubled with him too ; what shall I do with the fool ? Wit. She's handsome ; but she's a sort of an uncertain woman. Fain. I thought you had died for her. Wit. Umh\u2014 no- 's ain. She has wit. Wit. 'Tis what she will hardly allow anybody else : \u2014 now, demme, I should hate that, if she were as handsome as Cleopatra. Mirabell is not so sure of her as he thinks for. Pet. Beg him for his estate, that I may beg you afterwards : and so have but one trouble with you both. Wit. O rare Petulant ! thou art as quick as fire in a frosty morning ; thou shalt to the Mall with us, and we'll be very severe. Pel. Enough, I'm in a humour to be severe. Mir. Are you ? pray then walk by yourselves : let not us be accessary to your putting the ladies out of countenance with your senseless ribaldry, which you roar out aloud as often as they pass by you ; and when you have made a handsome woman blush, then yon think you have been severe. Pet. What, what ! then let 'em either show their innocence by not understanding what they hear, or else show their discretion by not hearing what they would not be thought to understand. Mir. But hast not thou then sense enough to know that thou oughtest to be most ashamed thy self, when thou hast put another out of countenance? Pet. Not I, by this hand ! \u2014 I always take blushing either for a sign of guilt, or ill-breeding. Mir. I confess you ought to think so. You are in the right, that you may plead the error of your judgment in defence of your practice. Where modesty's ill-manners, 'tis but fit That impudence and malice pass for wit. [Exeunt. 'Fain. Why do you think so ? Wit. We stayed pretty late there last night, and heard something of an uncle to Mirabell, who is lately come to town \u2014 and is between him and the best part of his estate. Mirabell and he are at some distance, as my lady Wishfort has been told ; and you know she hates Mirabell worse than a quaker hates a parrot, or than a fishmonger hates a hard frost. Whether this uncle has seen Mrs. Millamant or not, I cannot say, but there were items of such a treaty being in embryo ; aud if it should come to life, poor Mirabell would be in some sort unfortu nately fobbed, i'faith. Fain. 'Tis impossible Millamant should hearken to it. Wit. Faith, my dear, I can't tell; she's a woman, and a kind of humourist. Alir. And this is the sum of what you could collect last night ? Pet. The quintessence. Maybe Witwoud knows more, he staid longer : \u2014 besides, they never mind him ; they say anything before him. Mir. I thought you had been the greatest favourite. ACT II.

To pass our youth in dull indif ference, to refuse the sweets of life because they once must leave us, is as preposterous as to wish to have been born old, because we one day must be old. For my part, my youth may wear and waste, but it shall never rust in my possession. Airs. Fain. Then it seems you dissemble an aversion to mankind, only in compliance to my mother's humour? Mrs. Fainall and Mrs. Marwood. Mrs. Fain. Ay, ay, dear Marwood, if we will be happy, we must find the means in ourselves, and among ourselves. Men are ever in extremes ; either doating or averse. While they are lovers, if they have fire and sense, their jealousies are insupport able ; and when they cease to love, (we ought to think at least) they loathe ; they look upon us with horror and distaste ; they meet us like the ghosts of what we were, and as such, fly from us. Mar. True, 'tis an unhappy circumstance of life, that love should ever die before us ; and that the man so often should outlive the lover. But say what you will, 'tis better to be left, than never to Alar. Certainly. To be free ; I have no taste of those insipid dry discourses, with which our sex of force must entertain themselves, apart from men. We may affect endearments to each other, profess eternal friendships, and seem to doat like lovers ; but 'tis not in our natures long to persevere. Love will resume his empire in our breasts ; and every"], [359, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD. SCENE HI. 265 heart, or soon or late, receive and re-admit him as its lawful tyrant. Fain. My dear '. Airs. Fain. My soul ! Fain. You don't look well to-day, child. Airs. Fain. D'ye think so ? Alir. He is the only man that does, madam. AIis. Fain. The only man that would tell me so at least ; and the only man from whom I could hear it without mortification. Airs. Fain Bless me, how have I been deceived! why you profess a libertine. Alar. You see my friendship by my freedom. Come, be as sincere, acknowledge that your senti ments agree with mine. Mrs. Fuin. Never! Mar. You hate mankind ? Fain. O my dear, I am satisfied of your tender ness ; I know you cannot resent anything from me; especially what is an effect of my concern. Airs. Fain. Mr. Mirabell, my mother interrupted you in a pleasant relation last night ; I would fain hear it out. Airs. Fain. Heartily, inveterately. Mar. Your husband ? Airs. Fain. Most transcendently ; ay, though I say it, meritoriously. Alar. Give me your hand upon it. Airs. Fain. There. Alir. The persons concerned in that affair have yet a tolerable reputation. \u2014 I am afraid Mr. Fain all will be censorious. Mar. I join with you ; what I have said has been to try you. Airs. Fain. Is it possible? dost thou hate those vipers, men ? Alar. I have done hating 'em, and am now come to despise 'em ; the next thing I have to do, is eternally to forget 'em. Airs. Fain. There spoke the spirit of an Ama zon, a Penthesilea ! Airs. Fain. He has a humour more prevailing than his curiosity, and will willingly dispense with the hearing of one scandalous story, to avoid giving an occasion to make another by being seen to walk with his wife. This way, Mr. Mirabell, and I dare promise you will oblige us both. Mar. And yet I am thinking sometimes to carry my aversion further. Airs. Fain. How? SCENE III. Alar. Faith, by marrying; if I could but find one that loved me very well, and would be throughly sensible of ill usage, I thiok I should do myseif the violence of undergoing the ceremony. Airs. Fain. You would not make him a cuckold ? Fainall and Mrs. Marwood. Fain. Excellent creature ! Well, sure if I should live to be rid of my wife, I should be a miserable man. Mar. No ; but I'd make him believe I did, and that's as bad. Alar. Ay ! Fain. For having only that one hope, the ac complishment of it, of consequence, must put an end to all my hopes ; and what a wretch is he who must survive his hopes ! Nothing remains when that day comes, but to sit down and weep like Alexander, when he wanted other worlds to conquer. Airs. Fain. Why, had not you as good do it? Alar. Oh! if he should ever discover it, he would then know the worst, and be out of his pain ; but I would have him ever to continue upon the rack of fear and jealousy. Mrs. Fain. Ingenious mischief! would thou wert married to Mirabell. Mar. Will you not follow 'em ? Fain. Faith, I think not. Alar. Pray let us ; I have a reason. Fain. You are not jealous ? Alar. Of whom? Afar. Would I were ! Mrs. Fain. You change colour. Afar. Because I hate him. Mrs. Fain. So do I ; but I can hear him named. But what reason have you to hate him in particular? Mar. I never loved him ; he is, and always was, insufferably proud. Airs. Fain. By the reason you give for your aversion, one would think it dissembled ; for you have laid a fault to his charge, of which his enemies must acquit him. Alar. Oh then, it seems, you are one of his favourable enemies! Methinks you look a little pale, and now you flush again. Airs. Fain. Do I ? I think I am a little sick Fain. Of Mirabell. Alar. If I am, is it inconsistent with my love lo you that I am tender of your honour? Fain. You would intimate then, as if there were a fellow-feeling between my wife and him. Mar. I think she does not hate him to that de gree she would be thought. Fain. But he, I fear, is too insensible. Alar. It may be you are deceived. Fain. It may be so. I do now begin to appre hend it. f the sudden. Mar. What? Fain. That I have been deceived, madam, and you are false. Alar. That I am false ! what mean you ? Fain. To let you know I see through all your little arts. \u2014 Come, you both love him ; and both have equally dissembled your aversion. Your mutual jealousies of one another have made you clash till you have both struck fire. I have seen the warm confession reddening on your cheeks, and sparkling from your eyes. Alar. You do me wrong. Fain. I do not. 'Twas for my ease to oversee and wilfully neglect the gross advances made him Alar. What ails you ? Airs. Fain. My husband. Don't you see him ? He turned short upon me unawares, and has almost overcome me. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE II. Mrs. Fainall, 3Irs. Marwood, Fainall, and Mirabell. Mar. Ha ! ha ! ha ! he comes opportunely for you.

But could you think, because the nodding husband would not wake, that e'er the watchful lover slept ? Mar. And wherewithal can you reproach me ? Fain. With infidelity, with loving another, with love of Mirabell. of her fortune ; which then would have descended to my wife ; \u2014 and wherefore did I marry, but to make lawful prize of a rich widow's wealth, and squander it on love and you ? Mar. Deceit and frivolous pretence ! Fain. Death, am I not married ? What's pre tence ? Am I not imprisoned, fettered ? Have I not a wife ? nay a wife that was a widow, a young widow, a handsome widow ; and would be again a widow, but that I have a heart of proof, and some thing of a constitution to bustle through the ways of wedlock and this world ! Will you yet be re conciled to truth and me? Mar. 'Tis false ! I challenge you to show an instance that can confirm your groundless accusa tion. I hate him. Fain. And wherefore do you hate him ? he is insensible, and your resentment follows his neglect. An instance ! the injuries you have done him are a proof : your interposing in his love. What cause had you to make discoveries of his pretended passion ? to undeceive the credulous aunt, and be the officious obstacle of his match with Millamant ? Alar. Impossible. Truth and you are incon sistent : I hate you, and shall for ever. Fain. For loving you ? Mar. I loathe the name of love after such usage ; and next to the guilt with which you would asperse me, I scorn you most. Farewell ! Fain. Nay, we must not part thus. Mar. Let me go. Fain. Come, I'm sorry. Mar. I care not \u2014 let me go \u2014 break my hands, do \u2014 I'd leave 'em to get loose. Fain. I would not hurt you for the world. Have I no other hold to keep you here ? Alar. Well, I have deserved it all. Alar. My obligations to my lady urged me ; I had professed a friendship to her ; and could not see her easy nature so abused by that dissembler. Fain. What, was it conscience then ? Professed a friendship ! O the pious friendships of the female sex ! Alar. More tender, more sincere, and more en during, than all the vain and empty vows of men, whether professing love to us, or mutual faith to one another. Fain. You know I love you. Alar. Poor dissembling ! \u2014 O that \u2014 well, it is Fain. Ha ! ha ! ha ! you are my wife's friend too. not yet \u2014 Fain. What ? what is it not ? what is it not yet ? It is not yet too late \u2014 \u25a0 Mar. No, it is not yet too late ; \u2014 I have that comfort. Mar. Shame and ingratitude ! do you reproach me ? you, you upbraid me ? Have I been false to her, through strict fidelity to you, and sacrificed my friendship to keep my love inviolate ? And have you the baseness to charge me with the guilt, unmindful of the merit ? To you it should be meritorious, that I have been vicious : and do you reflect that guilt upon me, which should lie buried in your bosom ? Fain. You misinterpret my reproof. I meant but to remind you of the slight account you once could make of strictest ties, when set in competition with your love to me. Mar. 'Tis false, you urged it with deliberate malice ! 'twas spoken in scorn, and I never will forgive it. Fain. Your guilt, not your resentment, begets your rage. If yet you loved, you could forgive a jeaiousy : but you are stung to find you are dis covered. Fain. It is, to love another. Alar. But not to loathe, detest, abhor mankind, myself, and the whole treacherous world. Fain. Nay, this is extravagance. \u2014 Come, I ask your pardon \u2014 no tears \u2014 I was to blame, I could not love you and be easy in my doubts. Pray for bear \u2014 I believe you ; I'm convinced I've done you wrong ; and any way, every way will make amends. I'll hate my wife yet more, damn her! I'll part with her, rob her of all she's worth, and we'll retire somewhere, anywhere, to another world. I'll marry thee \u2014 be pacified. \u2014 'Sdeath, they come, hide your face, your tears ; \u2014 you have a mask, wear it a moment. This way, this way \u2014 be persuaded. Alar. It shall be all discovered. You too shall be discovered ; be sure you shall. I can but be exposed \u2014 If I do it myself I shall prevent your baseness. SCENE IV. Mirabell and Mrs. Fainall. Fain. Why, what will you do ? Afar. Disclose it to your wife ; own what has passed between us. Fain. Frenzy 1 Alar.

Airs. Fain. You have been the cause that I have loved without bounds, and would you set limits to that aversion of which you have been the occasion ? why did you make me marry this man ?"], [361, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD. SCENE V. 267 Alir. Why do we daily commit disagreeable and dangerous actions ? to save that idol, reputation. If the familiarities of our loves had produced that consequence of which you were apprehensive, where could you have fixed a father's name with credit, but on a husband ? I knew Fainall to be a man lavish of his morals, an interested and pro fessing friend, a false and a designing lover ; yet one whose wit and outward fair behaviour have gained a reputation with the town enough to make that woman stand excused who has suffered herself to be won by his addresses. A better man ought not to have been sacrificed to the occasion ; a worse had not answered to the purpose. When you are weary of him, you know your remedy. Afrs. Fain. I ought to stand in some degree of credit with you, Mirabell. Alir. In justice to you, I have made you privy to my whole design, and put it in your power to ruin or advance my fortune. Afrs. Fain. Whom have you instructed to repre sent your pretended uncle ? Alir. Waitwell, my servant. Afrs. Fain. He is an humble servant to Foible my mother's woman, and may win her to your interest. SCENE V. Mirabell, Mrs. Fainall, Mrs. Millamant, Witwoud, and Mincing, Alir. Here she comes, i'faith, full sail, with her fan spread and her streamers out, and a shoal of fools for tenders ; ha, no, I cry her mercy ! Airs. Fain. I see but one poor empty sculler ; and he tows her woman after him. Alir. [To Millamant.] You seem to be unattended, madam \u2014 you used to have the beau monde throng after you ; and a flock of gay fine perukes hovering round you. Wit. Like moths about a candle. \u2014 I had like to have lost my comparison for want of breath. Mil. O I have denied myself airs to-day, I have walked as fast through the crowd. Wit. As a favourite just disgraced ; and with as few followers. Mil. Dear Mr. Witwoud, truce with your similitudes ; for I am as sick of 'em \u2014 Wit. As a physician of a good air. \u2014 I cannot help it, madam, though 'tis against myself. Alii. Yet, again ! \u2014 Mincing, stand between me and his wit. Alir. Care is taken for that \u2014 she is won and worn by this time. They were married this morning. Mrs. Fiin. Who ? Wit. Do, Mrs. Mincing, like a screen before a great fire. \u2014 I confess I do blaze to-day, I am too bright. Mrs. Fain. But, dear Millamant, why were you so long ? Alii. Long ! Lord, have I not made violent haste ; I have asked every living thing I met for you ; I have inquired after you, as after a new fashion. Alir. Waitwell and Foible. I would not tempt my servant to betray me by trusting him too far. If your mother, in hopes to ruin me, should con sent to marry my pretended uncle, he might, like Mosca in the Fox, stand upon terms ; so I made him sure beforehand. Wit. Madam, truce with your similitudes. \u2014 No, you met her husband, and did not ask him for her. Alii. By your leave, Witwoud, that were like inquiring after an old fashion, to ask a husband for his wife. Airs. Fain. So, if my poor mother is caught in a contract, you will discover the imposture be times ; and release her by producing a certificate of her gallant's former marriage ? Alir. Yes, upon condition that she consent to my marriage with her niece, and surrender the moiety of her fortune in her possession. Mrs. Fain. She talked last night of endea vouring at a match between Millamant and your uncle. Wit. Hum, a hit ! a hit ! a palpable hit ! I con fess it. Mrs. Fain. You were dressed before I came abroad. Mil. Ay, that's true. \u2014 O but then I had\u2014Min cing, what had I ? why was I so long ? Alin. O mem, your laship stayed to peruse a packet of letters. Mil. O ay, letters \u2014 I had letters \u2014 I am perse cuted with letters \u2014 I hate letters \u2014 Nobody knows how to write letters, and yet one has 'em, one does not know why. They serve one to pin up one's hair. Wit. Is that the way ? Pray, madam, do you pin up your hair with all your letters ? I find I must keep copies. Mil. Only with those in verse, Mr. Witwoud, I never pin up my hair with prose I think I tried once, Mincing. Alin. O mem, I shall never forget it. Mil. Ay, poor Mincing tift and tift all the morning. Alin. Till I had the cramp in my fingers, I'll vow, mem : and all to no purpose. But when your laship pins it up with poetry, it sits so plea sant the next day as anything, and is so pure and so crips. Wit. Indeed, so crips ? Alin. You're such a critic, Mr. Witwoud. Mil. Mirabell, did you take exceptions last night ? O ay, and went away. \u2014 Now I think on't, Alir. That was by Foible's direction, and my instruction, that she might seem to carry it more privately. Airs. Fain. Well, I have an opinion of your success ; for I believe my lady will do anything to get a husband ; and when she has this, which you have provided for her, I suppose she will submit to anything to get rid of him. Alir. Yes, I think the good lady would marry anything that resembled a man, though 'twere no more than what a butler could pinch out of a napkin. Airs. Fain. Female frailty 1 we must all come to it, if we live to be old, and feel the craving of a false appetite when the true is decayed. Afir. An old woman's appetite is depraved like that of a girl \u2014 'tis the green sickness of a second childhood; and, like the faint offer of a latter spring, serves but to usher in the fall, and withers in an affected bloom. Mrs. Fain. Here's your mistress,"], [362, "268 THE WAY OF THE WORLD. ACT II. I'm angry \u2014 no, now I think on't I'm pleased \u2014 for I believe I gave you some pain. Mir. Does that please you ? Mil. Infinitely; I love to give pain. Mir. You would affect a cruelty which is not in your nature ; your true vanity is in the power of pleasing. Alii. Oh I ask you pardon for that \u2014 one's cruelty is one's power ; and when one parts with one's cruelty, one parts with one's power ; and when one has parted with that, I fancy one's old and ugly. How can you find delight in such society ? It is impossible they should admire you, they are not capable : or if they were, it should be to you as a mortification ; for sure to please a fool is some degree of folly. Mil. I please myself: \u2014 besides, sometimes to converse with fools is for my health. Alir. Your health ! is there a worse disease than the conversation of fools ? Alii. Yes, the vapours ; fools are physic for it, next to assafcetida. Mir. You are not in a course of fools ? Alir. Ay, ay, suffer your cruelty to ruin the object of your power, to destroy your lover \u2014 and then how vain, how lost a thing you'll be ! Nay, 'tis true : you are no longer handsome when you've lost your lover; your beauty dies upon the instant; for beauty is the lover's gift ; 'tis he bestows your charms \u2014 your glass is all a cheat. The ugly and the old, whom the looking-glass mortifies, yet after commendation can be flattered by it, and discover beauties in it ; for that reflects our praises, rather than your face. Mil. Mirabell, if you persist in this offensive freedom, you'll displease me. \u2014 I think I must resolve, after all, not to have you : \u2014 we shan't agree. Mir. Not in our physic, it may be. Alii. And yet our distemper, in all likelihood, will be the same ; for we shall be sick of one another. I shan't endure to be reprimanded nor instructed ; 'tis so dull to act always by advioe, and so tedious to be told of one's faults \u2014 I can't bear it. Well, I won't have you, Mirabell \u2014 I'm resolved \u2014 I think \u2014 you may go. \u2014 Ha ! ha ! ha ! what would you give, that you could help loving me ? Mil. O the vanity of these men ! \u2014 Fainall, d'ye hear him ? If they did not commend us, we were not handsome ! Now you must know they could not commend one, if one was not handsome. Beauty the lover's gift ! \u2014 Lord, what is a lover, that it can give ? Why, one makes lovers as fast as one pleases, and they live as long as one pleases, and they die as soon as one pleases ; and then, if one pleases, one makes more. Wit. Very pretty. Why, you make no more of making of lovers, madam, than of making so many card-matches. Alir. I would give something that you did not know I could not help it. Mil. Come, don't look grave then. Well, what do you say to me ? Mir. I say that a man may as soon make a friend by his wit, or a fortune by his honesty, as win a woman with plain-dealing and sincerity. Mil. Sententious Mirabell ! \u2014 Prithee, don't look with that violent and inflexible wise face, like Solomon at the dividing of the child in an old tapestry hanging. Mir. You are merry, madam, but I would persuade you for a moment to be serious. Mil. What, with that face ? no, if you keep your countenance, 'tis impossible I should hold mine. Well, after all, there is something very moving in a love-sick face. Ha ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 well, I won't laugh, don't be peevish \u2014 Heigho ! now I'll be melancholy, as melancholy as a watch-light. Well, Mirabell, if ever you will win me woo me now. \u2014 Nay, if you are so tedious, fare you well ; \u2014 I see they are walking away. Mir. Can you not find in the variety of your disposition one moment \u2014 Mil. To hear you tell me Foible's married, and your plot like to speed ; \u2014 no. Mir. But how you came to know it ? Alii. Without the help of the devil, you can't imagine ; unless she should tell me herself. Which of the two it may have been I will leave you to con sider ; and when you have done thinking of that, think of me. Alii. One no more owes one's beauty to a lover, than one's wit to an echo. They can but reflect what we look and say; vain empty things if we are silent or unseen, and want a being. Alir. Yet to those two vain empty things you owe two the greatest pleasures of your life. Mil. How so ? Alir. To your lover you owe the pleasure of hearing yourselves praised ; and to an echo the pleasure of hearing yourselves talk. Wit. But I know a lady that loves talking so incessantly, she won't give an echo fair play ; she has that everlasting rotation of tongue, that an echo must wait till she dies, before it can catch her last words. Mil. O fiction ! \u2014 Fainall, let us leave these men. Alir. Draw off Witwoud. [Aside to Mrs. Fainall. Airs Fain. Immediately. \u2014 I have a word or two for Mr. Witwoud. SCENE VI.

Me ? what did the filthy fellow say ? Foib. O madam ! 'tis a shame to say what he said \u2014 with his taunts and his fleers, tossing up his nose. Humph ! (says he) what, you are a hatch- ing some plot (says he), you are so early abroad, or catering (says he), ferreting for some disbanded officer, I warrant. \u2014 Half-pay is but thin subsist- ence (says he) ; \u2014 well, what pension does your lady propose? Let me see (says he), what, she must come down pretty deep now, she's super- annuated (says he) and\u2014 Lady Wish. Odds my life, I'll have him, I'll have him murdered ! I'll have him poisoned I Where does he eat ? \u2014 I'll marry a drawer to have him poisoned in his wine. I'll send for Robin from Locket's immediately. Foib. Poison him 1 poisoning's too good for him. Starve him, madam, starve him ; marry sir Row- land, and get him disinherited. Oh you would bless yourself to hear what he said ! Lady Wish. A villain ! superannuated ! Foib. Humph (says he), I hear you are laying designs against me too (says he), and Mrs. Mil- lamant is to marry my uncle (he does not suspect a word of your ladyship) ; but (says he) I'll fit you for that. I warrant you (says he) I'll hamper you for that (says he) ; you and your old frippery too (says he) ; I'll handle you \u2014 Lady Wish. Audacious villain 1 handle me ! would he durst ! \u2014 Frippery ! old frippery ! was there ever such a foul-mouthed fellow ? I'll be married to-morrow, I'll be contracted to-night. Foib. The sooner the better, madam. Lady Wish. Will sir Rowland be here, sayest thou ? when, Foible ? Foib. Incontinently, madam. No new sheriff's wife expects the return of her husband after knight hood with that impatience in which sir Rowland burns for the dear hour of kissing your ladyship's hand after dinner. SCENE III. Lady Wtishfort, Peg ivith a bottle and china cup. Peg. Madam, I was looking for a cup. Lady Wish. A cup, save thee ! and what a cup hast thou brought ! \u2014 Dost thou take me for a fairy, to drink out of an acorn ? Why didst thou not biing thy thimble ? Hast thou ne'er a brass thimble clinking in thy pocket with a bit of nut meg ? \u2014 I warrant, thee. Come, fill, fill ! \u2014 So \u2014 again. \u2014 [Knocking at the door.] \u2014 See who that is \u2014 Set down the bottle first \u2014 here, here, under the table. \u2014 What, wouldst thou go with the bottle in thy hand, like a tapster ? As I am a person, this wench has lived in an inn upon the road, before she came to me, like Maritornes the Astu rian in Don Quixote ! \u2014 No Foible yet ? Peg. No, madam ; Mrs. Marwood. Lady Wish. Oh, Marwood ; let her come in. \u2014 Come in, good Marwood. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE IV Lady Wishfort, Mrs. Marwood, and Peg. Alar. I'm surprised to find your ladyship in dishabille at this time of day. Lady Wish. Foible's a lost thing ; has been abroad since morning, and never heard of since. Alar. I saw her but now, as I came masked through the park, in conference with Mirabell. Lady Wish. With Mirabell ! \u2014 You call my blood into my face, with mentioning that traitor. She durst not have the confidence ! I sent her to negotiate an affair, in which, if I'm detected, I'm undone. If that wheedling villain has wrought upon Foible to detect me, I'm ruined. O my dear friend, I'm a wretch of wretches if I'm detected. Alar. O madam, you cannot suspect Mrs. Foible's integrity ! Lady Wish. Oh, he carries poison in his tongue that would corrupt integrity itself ! If she has given him an opportunity, she has as good as put her integrity into his hands. Ah, dear Marwood, what's integrity to an opportunity ? \u2014 Hark ! I hear her ! \u2014 dear friend, retire into my closet, that I may examine her with more freedom. \u2014 You'll pardon me, dear friend ; I can make bold with you There are books over the chimney. \u2014 Quarles and I'rynne, and The Short View of the Stage, with Bunyan's works, to entertain you. \u2014 [To Peg.] \u2014 Go, you thing, and send her in. Lady Wish. Frippery! superannuated frippery! I'll frippery the villain ; I'll reduce him to frip pery and rags ! a tatterdemalion ! I hope to see him hung with tatters, like a Long-lane pent-house or a gibbet thief. A slander-mouthed railer ! I warrant the spendthrift prodigal's in debt as much as the million lottery, or the whole court upon a birthday. I'll spoil his credit with his tailor. Yes, he shall have my niece with her fortune, he shall. Foib. He ! I hope to see him lodge in Ludgate first, and angle into Blackfriars for brass farthings with an old mitten. SCENE V. Lady Wishfort and Foible. Lady Wish. O Foible, where hast thou been ? what hast thou been doing ? Foib. Madam, 1 have seen the party. Lady Wish. But what hast thou done? Foib. Nay, 'tis your ladyship has done, and are to do ; I have only promised. But a man so ena moured \u2014 so transported! \u2014 Well, here it is, all that is left ; ali that is not kiss'd away. \u2014 Well, if wor shipping of pictures be a sin poor sir Rowland, I say. Lady Wish. Ay, dear Foible ; thank thee for that, dear Foible. He has put me out of all patience. I shall never recompose my features to receive sir Rowland with any economy of face."], [365, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD. SCENE VIII. 271 This wretch has fretted me that I am absolutely decayed. Look, Foible. Foib. Your ladyship has frowned a little too rashly, indeed, madam. There are some cracks discernible in the white varnish. Foib. O dear madam, Mr. Mirabell is such a sweet, winning gentleman \u2014 but your ladyship is the pattern of generosity. \u2014 Sweet lady, to be so good ! Mr. Mirabell cannot choose but be grate ful. I find your ladyship has his heart still. Now, madam, I can safely tell your ladyship our success ; Mrs. Marwood had told my lady ; but I warrant I managed myself ; I turned it all for the better. I told my lady that Mr. Mirabell railed at her ; I laid horrid things to his charge, I'll vow ; and my lady is so incensed that she'll be contracted to sir Rowland to-night, she says ; I warrant I worked her up, that he may have her for asking for, as they say of a Welsh maidenhead. Mrs. Fain. O rare Foible ! Lady Wish. Let me see the glass. \u2014 Cracks, sayest thou? \u2014 why, I am errantly flayed \u2014 I look like an old peeled wall. Thou must repair me, Foible, before sir Rowland comes, or I shall never keep up to my picture. Foib. I warrant you, madam, a little art once made your picture like you ; and now a little of the same art must make you like your picture. Your picture must sit for you, madam. Lady Wish. But art thou sure sir Rowland will not fail to come ? or will he not fail when he does come ? Will he be importunate, Foible, and push ? For if he should not be importunate, I shall never break decorums : \u2014 I shall die with confusion, if I am forced to advance. \u2014 Oh no, I can never ad vance ! \u2014 I shall swoon if he should expect advances. No, I hope sir Rowland is better bred than to put a lady to the necessity of breaking her forms. I won't be too coy, neither. \u2014 I won't give him despair \u2014 but a little disdain is not amiss ; a little scorn is alluring. Foib. A little scorn becomes your ladyship. Lady Wish. Yes, but tenderness becomes me best \u2014 a sort of dyingness \u2014 you see that picture has a sort of a \u2014 ha, Foible ! a swimmingness in the eye \u2014 yes, I'll look so \u2014 my niece affects it ; but she wants features. Is sir Rowland handsome ? Let my toilet be removed \u2014 I'll dress above. I'll re ceive sir Rowland here. Is he handsome ? Don't answer me. I won't know: I'll be surprised, I'll be taken by surprise. Foib. By storm, madam, sir Rowland's a brisk man. Foib. Madam, I beg your ladyship to acquaint Mr. Mirabell of his success. I would be seen as little as possible to speak to him : \u2014 besides, I be lieve madam Marwood watches me. \u2014 She has a month's mind ; but I know Mr. Mirabell can't abide her. \u2014 John! \u2014 [Calls.] remove my lady's toilet. \u2014 Madam, your servant: my lady is so im patient, I fear she'll come for me if I stay. Airs. Fain. I'll go with you up the back-stairs, lest I should meet her. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE VII. Mrs. Marwood. Indeed, Mrs. Engine, is it thus with you ? are you become a go-between of this importance ? yes, I shall watch you. Why this wench is the passe- partout, a very master-key to everybody's strong- box. My friend Fainall, have you carried it so swimmingly ? I thought there was something in it ; but it seems 'tis over with you. Your loathing is not from a want of appetite, then, but from a surfeit. Else you could never be so cool to fall from a principal to be an assistant ; to procure for him ! a pattern of generosity that, I confess. Well, Mr. Fainall, you have met with your match. \u2014 O man, man ! woman, woman ! the devil's an ass : if I were a painter, I would draw him like an idiot, a driveller with a bib and bells : man should have his head and horns, and woman the rest of him. Poor simple fiend \\ \u2014 AIadam Alarwood has a month's mind, but he can't abide her. \u2014 'Twere better for him you had not been his confessor in that affair, without you could have kept his counsel closer. I shall not prove another pattern of gene- rosity : he has not obliged me to that with those excesses of himself; and now I'll have none of him. Here comes the good lady, panting ripe ; with a heart full of hope, and a head full of care, like any chemist upon the day of projection. Lady Wish. Is he ! O then he'll importune, if he's a brisk man. I shall save decorums if sir Rowland importunes. I have a mortal terror at the apprehension of offending against decorums. 0, I'm glad he's a brisk man. Let my things be removed, good Foible. SCENE VI Mrs. Fainall and Foible. Mrs. Fain. O Foible, I have been in a fright, lest I should come too late ! That devil Marwood saw you in the Park with Mirabell, and I'm afraid will discover it to my lady. Foib. Discover what, madam ! Airs. Fain. Nay, nay, put not on that strange face, I am privy to the whole design, and know that Waitwell, to whom thou wert this morning married, is to personate Mirabell's uncle, and as such, winning my lady, to involve her in those difficulties from which Mirabell only must release her, by his making his conditions to have my cousin and her fortune left to her own disposal. Foib. O dear madam, I beg your pardon. It was not my confidence in your ladyship that was deficient ; but I thought the former good corre spondence between your ladyship and Mr. Mira bell might have hindered his communicating this secret SCENE VIII. Mrs. Marwood and Lady Wishfort. Lady Wish. O dear, Marwood, what shall I say for this rude forgetfulness ? \u2014 but my dear friend is all goodness. Mar. No apologies, dear madam, I have been very well entertained. Lady Wish. As I'm a person, I am in a very chaos to think I should so forget myself:\u2014 but Airs. Fain. Dear Foible, forget that."], [366, "272 THE WAY OF THE WORLD. ACT III, I have such an olio of affairs, really I know not what to do. \u2014 Foible! \u2014 [Calls.] I expect my nephew, sir Wilfull, every moment too. \u2014 Why, Foible ! \u2014 He means to travel for improvement. Mar. Methinks sir Wilfull should rather think of marrying than travelling at his years. I hear he is turned of forty. Lady Wish. O he's in less danger of being spoiled by his travels \u2014 I am against my nephew's marry ing too young. It will be time enough when he comes back, and has acquired discretion to choose for himself. the disguise. For a fool's visit is always a disguise , and never admitted by a woman of wit, but to blind her affair with a lover of sense. If you would but appear barefaced now, and own Mirabell, you might us easily put off Petulant and Witwoud as your hood and scarf. Aud indeed, 'tis time, for the town has found it ; the secret is grown too big for the pre tence. 'Tis like Mrs. Primly's great belly ; she may lace it down before, but it burnishes on her hips. Indeed, Millamant, you can no more conceal it, than my lady Strammel can her face ; that goodly face, which in defiance of her Rhenish wine tea, will not be comprehended in a mask. Alii. I'll take my death, Marwood. you are more censorious than a decayed beauty, or a discarded toast. \u2014 Mincing, tell the men they may come up. \u2014 My aunt is not dressing here ; their folly is less provoking than your malice. Mar. Methinks Mrs. Millamant and he would make a very fit match. He may travel afterwards. 'Tis a thing very usual with young gentlemen. Lady Wish. I promise you 1 have thought on't \u2014 and since 'tis your judgment, I'll think on't again. I assure you I will ; I value your judgment ex tremely. On my word, I'll propose it. \u2014 . \u2014 SCENE XT. SCENE IX. Millamant and Mrs. Marwood. Mrs. Marwood, Lady Wishfort, and Foible. Alii. The town has found it ! what has it found ? That Mirabell loves me is no more a secret, than it is a secret that you discovered it to my aunt, or than the reason why you discovered it is a secret. Alar. You are nettled. Lady Wish. Come, come, Foible \u2014 I had forgot my nephew will be here before dinner : \u2014 I must make haste. Foib. Mr. Witwoud and Mr. Petulant are come to dine with your ladyship. Alii. You're mistaken. Ridiculous ! Lady Wish. O dear, I can't appear till I'm dressed. \u2014 Dear Marwood, shall I be free with you again, and beg you to entertain 'em ? I'll make all imaginable haste. Dear friend, excuse me. Alar. Indeed, my dear, you'll tear another fan, if you don't mitigate those violent airs. Alii. O silly ! ha ! ha ! ha ! I could laugh im moderately. Poor Mirabell ! his constancy to me has quite destroyed his complaisance for all the world beside. I swear, I never enjoined it him to be so coy \u2014 If I had the vanity to think he would obey me, I would command him to show more gal lantry \u2014 'tis hardly well-bred to be so particular on one hand, and so insensible on the other. But I despair to prevail, and so let him follow his own way. Ha ! ha ! ha ! pardon me, dear creature, I must laugh, ha ! ha ! ha ! though I grant you 'tis a little barbarous, ha ! ha ! ha ! SCENE X Mrs. Marwood, Mrs. Millamant, and Mincing. Mil. Sure never anything was so unbred as that odious man ! \u2014 Marwood, your servant. Mar. You have a colour ; what's the matter ? Alii. That horrid fellow, Petulant, has provoked me into a flame: \u2014 I have broken my fan Mincing, lend me yours ; is not all the powder out of my hair ? Alar. What pity 'tis so much fine raillery, and delivered with so significant gesture, should be so unhappily directed to miscarry ! Mil. Ha ! dear creature, I ask your pardon \u2014 I swear I did not mind you. Alar. Mr. Mirabell and you both may think it a thing impossible, when 1 shall tell him by telling you \u2014 Mar. No. What has he done ? Mil. Nay, he has done nothing; he has only talked \u2014 nay, he has said nothing neither ; hut he has contradicted everything that has been said. For my part, I thought Witwoud and he would have quarrelled. Min. I vow, mem, I thought once they would have fit. Alii. O dear, what ? for it is the same thing if I hear it \u2014 ha ! ha! ha! Alii. Well, 'tis a lamentable thing, I swear, that one has not the liberty of choosing one's acquaint ance as one does one's clothes. Mar. That I detest him, hate him, madam. Mil. O madam, why so do I \u2014 and yet the crea ture loves me, ha ! ha ! ha ! how can one forbear laughing to think of it. \u2014 I am a sibyl if I am not amazed to think what he can see in me. I'll take my death, I think you are handsomer \u2014 and within a year or two as young \u2014 if you could but stay for me, I should overtake you\u2014 but that cannot be. \u2014 Well, that thought makes me melancholic. \u2014 Now, I'll be sad. Mar. If we had that liberty, we should be as weary of one set of acquaintance, though never so good, as we are of one suit though never so fine. A fool and a doily stuff would now and then find days of grace, and be worn for variety. Mil. I could consent to wear 'em, if they would wear alike ; but fools never wear out \u2014 they are such drop de Berri things ! without one could give 'em to one's chambermaid after a day or two. Alar. 'Twere better so indeed. Or what think you of the playhouse ? A fine gay glossy fool should be given there, like a new masking habit, after the masquerade is over, and we have done with Alar. Your merry note may be changed sooner than you think. Mil. D'ye say so? Then I'm resolved I'll have a song to keep up my spirits."], [367, "SCENE XV. THE WAY OF THE WORLD. 273 Pet. Why should a man be any further from being married, though he can't read, than he is from being hanged ? The ordinary's paid for setting the psalm, and the parish-priest for reading the ceremony.

Here's company ; if you please to walk in, in the mean time. \u2666 Sir Wil. Dressing ! what, it's but morning here, I warrant, with you in London ; we should count it towards afternoon in our parts, down in Shrop shire. \u2014 Why then, belike, my aunt han't dined yet, ha, friend ? SCENE XIII. Millamant, Mrs. Marwood, Mincing, Petulant, and Witwoud. Mil. Is your animosity composed, gentlemen ? Wit. Raillery, raillery, madam ; we have no animosity \u2014 we hit off a little wit now and then, but no animosity. \u2014 The falling-out of wits is like the falling-out of lovers : \u2014 we agree in the main, like treble and bass. \u2014 Ha, Petulant ? Foot. Your aunt, sir ? Sir Wil. My aunt, sir ! yes, my aunt, sir, and your lady, sir ; your lady is my aunt, sir. \u2014 Why, what dost thou not know me, friend ? why then send somebody hither that does. How long hast thou lived with thy lady, fellow, ha ? Foot. A week, sir ; longer than anybody in the house, except my lady's woman. Sir Wil. Why then belike thou dost not know thy lady, if thou seest her, ha, friend ? Foot. Why truly, sir, I cannot safely swear to her face in a morning, before she is dressed. 'Tis like I may give a shrewd guess at her by this time. Sir Wil. Well, prithee try what thou canst do ; if thou canst not guess, inquire her out, dost hear, fellow ? and tell her, her nephew, sir Wilfull Wit woud, is in the house. Pet. Ay, in the main \u2014 but when I have a humour to contradict \u2014 Wit. Ay, when he has a humour to contradict, then I contradict too. What, I know my cue. Then we contradict one another like two battle dores ; for contradictions beget one another like Jews. Pet. If he says black's black \u2014 if I have a humour to say 'tis blue \u2014 let that pass \u2014 all's one for that. If I have a humour to prove it, it must be granted. Wit. Not positively must \u2014 but it may \u2014 it may. Pet. Yes, it positively must, upon proof posi tive. Foot. I shall, sir. Sir Wil. Hold ye, hear me, friend ; a word with you in your ear ; prithee who are these gallants ? Foot. Really, sir, I can't tell ; here come so many here, 'tis hard to know 'em all. Wit. Ay, upon proof positive it must ; but upon proof presumptive it only may. \u2014 That's a logical distinction now, madam. Alar. I perceive your debates are of importance, and very learnedly handled. Pet. Importance is one thing, and learning's another ; but a debate's a debate, that I assert. Wit. Petulant's an enemy to learning j he relies altogether on his parts. Pet. No, I'm no enemy to learning ; it hurts not me. SCENE XV Sir Wilfull Witwoud, Petulant, Witwoud, and Mrs. Marwood. Sir Wil. Oons, this fellow knows less than a starling ; I don't think a' knows his own name. Mar. Mr. Witwoud, your brother is not behind hand in forgetfulness \u2014 I fancy he has forgot you too. Mar. That's a sign indeed it's no enemy to you. Pet. No, no, it's no enemy to anybody but them that have it. Alii.

We could have gazettes, then, and Dawks's Letter, and the Weekly Bill, till of late days. Pet. S'life, Witwoud, were you ever an attorney's clerk? of the familyof the Furnivals? Hal ha! ha! Wit. Ay, ay, but that was but for a while : not long, not long. Pshaw ! I was not in my own power then ; \u2014 an orphan, and this fellow was my guardian ; ay, ay, I was glad to consent to that, man, to come to London : he had the disposal of me then. If I had not agreed to that, I might have been bound 'prentice to afelt-makerin Shrewsbury; this fellow would have bound me to a maker of felts. Sir Wil.

May be not, sir ; thereafter, as 'tis meant, sir. Pet. Sir, I presume upon the information of your boots. Sir Wil. Why, 'tis like you may, sir : if you are not satisfied with the information of my boots, sir, if you will step to the stable, you may inquire further of my horse, sir. Pel. Your horse, sir ! your horse is an ass, sir ! Sir Wil. Do you speak by way of offence, sir ? Mar. The gentleman's merry, that's all, sir. \u2014 [Aside] S'life, we shall have a quarrel betwixt an horse and an ass before they find one another out. \u2014 [Aloud.] You must not take anything amiss from your friends, sir. You are among your friends here, though it maybe you don't know it. \u2014 If I am not mistaken, you are sir Wilfull Witwoud. Sir Wil. Right, lady ; I am sir Wilfull Wit woud, so I write myself ; no offence to anybody, I hope ; and nephew to the lady Wishfort of this mansion. Sir Wil. Serve or not serve, I shan't ask licence of you, sir ; nor the weathercock your companion : I direct my discourse to the lady, sir 'Tis like my aunt may have told you, madam \u2014 yes, I have settled my concerns, I may say now, and am minded to see foreign parts. If an how that the peace holds, whereby that is, taxes abate. Mar. I thought you had designed for France at all adventures. Mar. Don't you know this gentleman, sir ? Sir Wil. Hum ! what, sure 'tis not \u2014 yea by'r Lady, but 'tis \u2014 s'heart, I know not whether 'tis or no\u2014 yea, but 'tis, by the Wrekin. Brother Anthony! what Tony, i'faith ! what, dost thou not know me ? By'r Lady, nor I thee, thou art so becravated, and so beperiwigged. \u2014 S'heart, why dost not speak ? art thou overjoyed ? Wit. Odso, brother, is it you ? your servant, brother. Sir Wil. I can't tell that ; 'tis like I may, and 'tis like I may not. I am somewhat dainty in making a resolution \u2014 because when I make it I keep it. I don't stand shill I, shall I, then ; if I say't, I'll do't ; but I have thoughts to tarry a small matter in town, to learn somewhat of your lingo first, before I cross the seas. I'd gladly have a spice of your French as they say, whereby to hold dis course in foreign countries. Mar. Here's an academy in town for that use. Sir Wil. There is ? 'Tis like there may. Mar. No doubt you will return very much im proved. Wit. Yes, refined, like a Dutch skipper from a whale -fishing. Sir Wil. Your servant! why yours, sir. Your servant again \u2014 s'heart, and your friend and servant to that \u2014 and a \u2014 and a \u2014 flap-dragon for your ser vice, sir ! and a hare's foot and a hare's scut for your service, sir ! an you be so cold and so courtly.

S'heart, sir, but there is, and much offence ! \u2014 A pox, is this your inns' o' court breed ing, not to know your friends and your relations, your elders and your betters ? Wit. Why, brother Wilfull of Salop, you may be as short as a Shrewsbury-cake, if you please. But I tell you 'tis not modish to know relations in town : you think you're in the country, where great lubberly brothers slabber and kiss one another when they meet, like a call of serjeants \u2014 'tis not the fashion here ; 'tis not indeed, dear brother. Sir Wil. The fashion's a fool ; and you're a fop, dear brother. S'heart, I've suspected this \u2014 by'r Lady, I conjectured you were a fop, since you began to change the style of your letters, and write on a scrap of paper gilt round the edges, no bigger than a subp\u0153na.

Sir Wil. Cousin Fainall, give me your hand. Lady Wish. Cousin Witwoud, your servant ; Mr. Petulant, your servant \u2014 nephew, you are wel come again. Will you drink anything after youi journey, nephew ; before you eat? dinner's almost ready. Sir Wil. I'm very well, I thank you, aunt \u2014 however, I thank you for your courteous offer. S'heart, I was afraid you would have been in the fashion too, and have remembered to have forgot"], [369, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD. SCENE XVIII. 275 your relations. Here's your cousin Tony, belike, I mayn't call him brother for fear of offence. Lady Wish. O, he's a railleur, nephew \u2014 my cou sin's a wit : and your great wits always rally their best friends to choose. When you have been abroad, nephew, you'll understand raillery better. [Fainall and Mrs. Marwood talk apart. Sir Wil. Why then let him hold his tongue in the mean time ; and rail when that day comes. tion. Take the opportunity of breaking it, just upon the discovery of this imposture. My lady will be enraged beyond bounds, and sacrifice niece, and fortune, and all, at that conjuncture. And let me alone to keep her warm ; if she should flag in her part, I will not fail to prompt her. Fain. Faith, this has an appearance. Mar. I'm sorry I hinted to my lady to endea vour a match between Millamant and sir Wilfull : that may be an obstacle. Fain. Oh, for that matter, leave me to manage him : I'll disable him for that ; he will drink like a Dane ; after dinner, I'll set his hand in. Alar. Well, how do you stand affected towards your lady ? Fain. Why, faith, I'm thinking of it. \u2014 Let me see \u2014 I am married already, so that's over : \u2014 my wife has played the jade with me \u2014 well, that's over too : \u2014 I never loved her, or if I had, why that would have been over too by this time : \u2014 jealous of her I cannot be, for I am certain ; so there's an end of jealousy : \u2014 weary of her I am, and shall be \u2014 no, there's no end of that \u2014 no, no, that were too much to hope. Thus far concerning my repose ; now for my reputation. As to my own, I married not for it, so that's out of the question ; \u2014 and as to my partin my wife's \u2014 why, she had parted with her's before ; so bringing none to me, she can take none from me ; 'tis against all rule of play, that I should lose to one who has not wherewithal to stake. SCENE XVII. Sir Wilfull W7itwol-d, Petulant, Witwoud, Lady Wishfort, Mrs. Marwood, Fainall, and Mincing. Alin. Mem, I am come to acquaint your laship that dinner is impatient. Sir Wil. Impatient ! why then belike it won't stay till I pull off my boots. \u2014 Sweetheart, can you help me to a pair of slippers ? \u2014 My man's with his horses, I warrant. Lady Wish. Fy, fy, nephew ! you would not pull off your boots here ? \u2014 Go down into the hall dinner shall stay for you. \u2014 My nephew's a little unbred, you'll pardon him, madam. \u2014 Gentlemen, will you walk ? \u2014 Marwood \u2014 Alar. I'll follow you, madam \u2014 before sir Wil full is ready. Afar. Besides, you forget, marriage is honourable. Fain. Hum, faith, and that's well thought on ; marriage is honourable as you say ; and if so, wherefore should cuckoldom be a discredit, being derived from so honourable a root ? SCENE XVTII Mrs. Marwood and Fainall. Fain. Why then, Foible's a bawd, an arrant, rank, match-making bawd : and I, it seems, am a hus band, a rank husband ; and my wife a very arrant, rank wife\u2014 all in the way of the world. 'Sdeath, to be a cuckold by anticipation, a cuckold in em bryo ! sure I was born with budding antlers, like a young satyr, or a citizen's child. 'Sdeath ! to be out witted, to be out-jilted \u2014 out-matrimony'd ! \u2014 If I had kept my speed like a stag, 'twere somewhat, \u2014 but to crawl after, with my horns, like a snail, and be outstripped by my wife \u2014 'tis scurvy wedlock. Mar. Then shake it off ; you have often wished for an opportunity to part \u2014 and now you have it. But first prevent their plot \u2014 the half of Millamant's fortune is too considerable to be parted with, to a foe, to Mirabell. Mar. Nay, I know not ; if the root be honour able, why not the branches ? Fain. So, so, why this point's clear \u2014 well, how do we proceed ? Mar. I will contrive a letter which shall be de livered to my lady at the time when that rascal who is to act sir Rowland is with her. It shall come as from an unknown hand \u2014 for the less I appear to know of the truth, the better I can play the incen diary. Besides, I would not have Foible provoked if I could help it \u2014 because you know she knows some passages \u2014 nay, I expect all will come out \u2014 but let the mine be sprung first, and then I care not if I am discovered. Fain. If the worst come to the worst \u2014 I'll turn my wife to grass \u2014 I have already a deed of settle ment of the best part of her estate; which I wheedled out of her ; and that you shall partake at least. Fain. Damn him ! that had been mine \u2014 had you not made that fond discovery \u2014 that had been for feited, had they been married. My wife had added lustre to my horns by that increase of fortune ; I could have worn 'em tipped with gold, though my forehead had been furnished like a deputy-lieute nant's hall. Mar. I hope you are convinced that I hate Mira bell now; you'll be no more jealous ? Fain. Jealous ! no \u2014 by this kiss \u2014 let husbands be jealous ; but let the lover still believe ; or if he doubt, let it be only to endear his pleasure, and prepare the joy that follows, when he proves his mistress true. But let husbands' doubts convert to endless jealousy ; or if*they have belief, let it corrupt to superstition and blind credulity. I am single, and will herd no more with 'em. True, I wear the badge, but I'll disown the order. And since I take my leave of 'em, I care not if I leave 'em a common motto to their common crest : \u2014 Mar. They may prove a cap of maintenance to you still, if you can away with your wife. And she's no worse than when you had her \u2014 I dare swear she had given up her game before she was married. Fain. Hum ! that may be. Mar. You married her to keep you ; and if you can contrive to have her keep you better than you expected, why should you not keep her longer than you intended ? Fain. The means, the means. Mar. Discover to my lady your wife's conduct ; threaten to part with her ; \u2014my lady loves her, and will come to any composition to save her reputa- All husbands must or pain or shame endure ; The wise too jealous are, fools too secure.

Do you lock yourself up from me, to make my search more curious ? or is this pretty artifice contrived to signify that here the chase must end, and my pursuits be crowned 2 For you can fly no further. Sir Wil. Yes \u2014 your servant. No offence, I hope, cousin. Mil. Vanity ! no \u2014 I'll fly, and be followed to the last moment.

Oh, I should think I was poor and had nothing to bestow, if I were reduced to an inglorious ease, and freed from the agreeable fatigues of solicitation. Mir. But do not you know, that when favours are conferred upon instant and tedious solicitation, that they diminish in their value, and that both the giver loses the grace, and the receiver lessens his pleasure % Mil. It may be in things of common applica tion ; but never sure in love. Oh, I hate a lover that can dare to think he draws a moment's air, independent on the bounty of his mistress. There is not so impudent a thing in nature, as the saucy look of an assured man, confident of success. The pedantic arrogance of a very husband has not so pragmatical an air. Ah ! I'll never marry, unless I am first made sure of my will and pleasure. Alir. Would you have 'em both before marriage ? or will you be contented with the first now, and stay for the other till after grace ? Mil. Ah ! don't be impertinent. \u2014 My dear liberty, shall I leave thee ? my faithful solitude, my darling contemplation, must I bid you then adieu ?

Not at present, cousin \u2014 yes, I make bold to see, to come and know if that how you were disposed to fetch a walk this evening, if so be that I might not be troublesome, I would have sought a walk with you. Mil. A walk 1 what then ? Sir Wil. Nay, nothing \u2014 only for the walk's sake, that's all. Mil.

Let us never visit together, nor go to a play together ; but let us be very strange and well-bred : let us be as strange as if we had been married a great while ; and as well bred as if we were not married at all.

Truly I would contribute much both to the saving of your life, and the accomplishment of your revenge. \u2014 Not that I respect myself, though he has been a perfidious wretch to me. Wait. Perfidious to you ! Lady Wish. O sir Rowland, the hours that he has died away at my feet, the tears that he has shed, the oaths that he has sworn, the palpitations that he has felt, the trances and the tremblings, the ardours and the ecstacies, the kneelings and the risings, the heart-heavings and the hand-gripings, the pangs and the pathetic regards of his protest ing eyes ! \u2014 Oh, no memory can register ' Wait.

Poor Waitwell's gone to prison already. Mrs. Fain. Have a good heart, Foible ; Mira- bell's gone to give security for him. This is all Marwood's and my husband's doing. Foib. Yes, yes ; I know it, madam : she was in my lady's closet, and overheard all that you said to me before dinner. She sent the letter to my lady ; and that missing effect, Mr. Fainall laid this plot to arrest Waitwell, when he pretended to go for the papers ; and in the mean time Mrs. Marwood declared all to my lady. Mrs. Fain. Was there no mention made of me in the letter ? My mother does not suspect my being in the confederacy ? I fancy Marwood has not told her, though she has told my husband. Foib. Yes, madam ; but my lady did not see that part ; we stifled the letter before she read so far. \u2014 Has that mischievous devil told Mr. Fainall of your ladyship then ? Mrs. Fain. Ay, all's out \u2014 my affair with Mira- bell \u2014 everything discovered. This is the last day of our living together, that's my comfort. Foib. Indeed, madam ; and so 'tis a comfort if you knew all ; \u2014 he has been even with your lady- ship, which I could have told you long enough since, but I love to keep peace and quietness by my goodwill. I had rather bring friends together, than set 'em at distance: but Mrs. Marwood and he are nearer related than ever their parents thought for. Foib. No, no, dear madam. Do but hear me, have but a moment's patience, I'll confess all. Mr. Mirabell seduced me ; I am not the first that he has wheedled with his dissembling tongue ; your ladyship's own wisdom has been deluded by him ; then how should I, a poor ignorant, defend myself? O madam, if you knew but what he promised me, and how he assured me your ladyship should come to no damage ! \u2014 Or else the wealth of the Indies should not have bribed me to conspire against so good, so sweet, so kind a lady as you have been to me. Lady Wish. No damage ! What, to betray me, and marry me to a cast-servingman ! to make me a receptacle, an hospital for a decayed pimp ! No damage ! O thou frontless impudence, more than a big-bellied actress ! Foib. Pray, do but hear me, madam ; he could not marry your ladyship, madam. \u2014 No, indeed, his marriage was to have been void in law, for he was married to me first, to secure your ladyship. He could not have bedded your ladyship ; for if he had consummated with your ladyship, he must have run the risk of the law, and been put upon his clergy. \u2014 \"Yes, indeed, I inquired of the law in that case before I would meddle or make. Afrs. Fain. Sayest thou so, Foible ? canst thou prove this ? Foib. I can take my oath of it, madam ; so can Mrs. Mincing. We have had many a fair word from Madam Marwood, to conceal something that passed in our chamber one evening when you were at Hyde-park ; and we were thought to have gone a-walking, but we went up unawares ; \u2014 though we were sworn to secrecy too. Madam Marwood took a book aud swore us upon it, but it was hut a book of poems. So long as it was not a bible-oath, we may break it with a safe conscience. Ladi/ Wish.

I am sorry to see you so passionate, madam. More temper would look more like inno cence. But I have done. I am sorry my zeal to serve your ladyship and family should admit of misconstruction, or make me liable to affronts. You will pardon me, madam, if I meddle no more with an affair in which I am not personally concerned. Lady Wish. O dear friend, I am so ashamed that you should meet with such returns ! \u2014 [To Mrs. Fainall.] You ought to ask pardon on your knees, ungrateful creature ! she deserves more from you than all your life can accomplish. \u2014 [To Mrs. Marwood.] Oh, don't leave me destitute in this perplexity ! \u2014 no, stick to me, my good genius. Mrs. Fain. I tell you, madam, you are abused. \u2014 Stick to you ! ay, like a leech, to suck your best blood \u2014 she'll drop off when she's full. Madam, you shan't pawn a bodkin, nor part with a brass counter, in composition for me. I defy 'em all. Let 'em prove their aspersions ; I know my own innocence, and dare stand a trial. Mrs. Fainall, Foible, and Mincing. As in. My lady would speak with Mrs. Foible, mem. Mr. Mirabell is with her ; he has set your spouse at liberty, Mrs. Foible, and would have you hide yourself in my lady's closet till my old lady's anger is abated. Oh, my old lady is in a perilous passion at something Mr. Fainall has said ! he swears, and my old lady cries. There's a fearful hurricane, I vow. He says, mem, how that he'll have my lady: s fortune made over to him, or he'll be divorced. Mrs. Fain. Does your lady or Mirabell know that ? Alin. Yes, mem ; they have sent me to see if sir Wilfull be sober, and to bring him to them. My lady is resolved to have him, I think, rather than lose such a vast sum as six thousand pounds. \u2014 O come, Mrs. Foible, I hear my old lady. Mrs. Fain. Foible, you must tell Mincing that she must prepare to vouch when 1 call her. Foib. Yes, yes, madam. Alin. O yes, mem, I'll vouch anything for your ladyship's service, be what it will. SCENE V. SCENE IV. Lady Wishfort and Mrs. Marwood. Mrs. Fainall, Lady Wishfort, and Mrs. Marwood. Lady Wish. Why, if she should be innocent, if she should be wronged after all, ha? \u2014 I don't know what to think ; \u2014 and I promise you her educa tion has been unexceptionable \u2014 I may say it ; for I chiefly made it my own care to initiate her very infancy in the rudiments of virtue, and to im press upon her tender years a young odium and aversion to the very sight of men : \u2014 ay, friend, she would ha' shrieked if she had but seen a man, till she was in her teens. As I am a person 'tis true : \u2014 she was never suffered to play with a male child, though but in coats ; nay, her very babies were of the feminine gender. Oh, she never looked a man in the face but her own father, or the chap lain, and him we made a shift to put upon her for a woman, by the help of his long garments, and his sleek face, till she was going in her fifteen. Mar. 'Twas much she should be deceived so long. Lady Wish. O my dear friend, how can I enu merate the benefits that I have received from your goodness ! To you I owe the timely discovery of the false vows of Mirabell ; to you I owe the detection of the impostor sir Rowland. And now you are become an intercessor with my son-in-law, to save the honour of my house, and compound for the frailties of my daughter. Well, friend, you are enough to reconcile me to the bad world, or else I would retire to deserts and solitudes, and feed harm less sheep by groves and purling streams. Dear Marwood, let us leave the world, and retire by our selves and be shepherdesses. Mar. Let us first despatch the affair in hand, madam. We shall have leisure to think of retire ment afterwards. Here is one who is concerned in the treaty. Lady Wish. O daughter, daughter ! is it pos sible thou shouldst be my child, bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh, and, as I may say, another me, and yet transgress the most minute particle of severe virtue ? Is it possible you should lean aside to iniquity, who have been cast in the direct mould of virtue ? I have not only been a mould but a pattern for you, and a model for you, after you were brought into the world. Mrs. Fain. I don't understand your ladyship. Lady Wish. Not understand ! Why, have you not been naught ? have you not been sophisticated ? Not understand ! here I am ruined to compound for your caprices and your cuckoldoms. I must pawn my plate and my jewels, and ruin my niece, and all little enough \u2014 Mrs. Fain. I am wronged and abused, and so are you. 'Tis a false accusation, as false as hell, as false as your friend there, ay, or your friend's friend, my false husband. Mar. My friend, Mrs. Fainall '. your husband my friend ! what do you mean ? Mrs. Fain. I know what 1 mean, madam, and Lady Wish. I warrant you, or she would never have borne to have been catechised by him ; and have heard his long lectures against singing and dancing, and such debaucheries ; and going to filthy plays, and profane music-meetings, where the lewd trebles squeak nothing but bawdy, and the basses roar blasphemy. Oh, she would have swooned at the sight or name of an obscene play-book 1 \u2014 and can I think, after all this, that my daughter can be naught ? What, a whore ? and thought it excom munication to set her foot within the door of a play house ! O dear friend, I can't believe it, no, no ! as she says, let him prove it, let him prove it. Mar. Prove it, madam ! What, and have your name prostituted in a public court ! yours and your daughter's reputation worried at the bar by a pack of bawling lawyers ! To be ushered in with an O yes of scandal ; and have your case opened by an old fumbling lecher in a quoif like a man midwife ; to bring your daughter's infamy to light ; to be a theme for legal punsters and quibblers by the statute ; and become a jest against a rule of"], [378, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD. 284 ACT V. court, where there is no precedent for a jest in any record \u2014 not even in doomsday-book ; to discom pose the gravity of the bench, and provoke naughty interrogatories in more naughty law Latin ; while the good judge, tickled with the proceeding, sim pers under a grey beard, and fidges off and on his cushion as if he had swallowed cantharides, or sat upon cow-it.-h ! \u2014 \u25a0 agreed unto, and that positively.

And then to have my young revellers of the Temple take notes, like 'prentices at a conven ticle ; and after talk it over again in commons, or before drawers in an eating-house. Lady Wish. Worse and worse ! Mar. Nay, this is nothing ; if it would end here 'twere well. But it must, after this, be consigned by the short-hand writers to the public press ; and from thence be transferred to the hands, nay into the throats and lungs of hawkers, with voices more licentious than the loud flounder-man's : and this you must hear till you are stunned ; nay, you must hear nothing else for some days. Lady Wish. Oh, 'tis insupportable ! No, no, dear friend, make it up, make it up; ay, ay, I'll compound. I'll give up all, myself and my all, my niece and her all \u2014 anything, everything for composition. Afar. Nay, madam, I advise nothing, I only lay before you, as a friend, the inconveniences which perhaps you have overseen. Here comes Mr. Fainall ; if he will be satisfied to huddle up all in silence, I shall be glad. You must think I would rather congratulate than condole with you. Fain. I come to make demands \u2014 I'll hear no objections. Lady Wish. You will grant me time to con sider ? Fain. Yes, while the instrument is drawing, to which you must set your hand till more sufficient deeds can be perfected : which 1 will take care shall be done with all possible speed.

Lady Wish. *Twas against my consent that she married this barbarian, but she would have him, though her year was not out. \u2014 Ah ! her first hus band, my son Languish, would not have carried it thus. Well, that was my choice, this is hers ; she is matched now with a witness. \u2014 I shall be mad ! \u2014 Dear friend, is there no comfort for me ? must I live to be confiscated at this rebel-rate ? \u2014 Here come two more of my Egyptian plagues too. \u2014 + \u2014 SCENE VI.

Well, madam ; I have suffered myself to be overcome by the importunity of this lady your friend ; and am content you shall enjoy your own proper estate during life, on condition you oblige yourself never to marry, under such penalty as I think convenient. SCENE VIII. Lady Wish. Never to marry ! Fain. No more sir Rowlands ; \u2014 the next impos ture may not be so timely detected. Mar. That condition, I dare answer, my lady will consent to without difficulty ; she has already but too much experienced the perfidiousness of men. \u2014 Besides, madam, when we retire to our pas toral solitude we shall bid adieu to all other thoughts. Lady Wish. Ay, that's true ; but in case of necessity, as of health, or some such emergency \u2014 Fain. Oh, if you are prescribed marriage, you shall be considered ; I will only reserve to myself the power to choose for you. If your physic be wholesome, it matters not who is your apothecary. Next, my wife shall settle on me the remainder of her fortune, not made over already ; and for her maintenance depend entirely on my discretion. Lady Wish. This is most inhumanly savage ; exceeding the barbarity of a Muscovite husband. Fain. I learned it from his Czarish majesty's retinue, in a winter evening's conference over brandy and pepper, amongst other secrets of matri mony and policy, as they are at present practised in the northern hemisphere. But this must be Lady Wishfort, Mrs. Marwood, Millamant, and Sir Wilfull Witwoud. Sir Wil. Aunt, your servant. Lady Wish. Out caterpillar, call not me auut ! I know thee not! Sir Wil. I confess I have been a little in dis guise, as they say. \u2014 S'heart ! and I'm sorry for't. What would you have ? I hope I have committed no offence, aunt \u2014 and if I did I am willing to make satisfaction ; and what can a man say fairer ? If I have broke anything I'll pay for't, an it cost a pound. And so let that content for what's past, and make no more words. For what's to come, to pleasure you I'm willing to marry my cousin. So pray let's all be friends, she and I are agreed upon the matter before a witness. Lady Wish. How's this, dear niece ? have I any comfort ? can this be true ? Alii. I am content to be a sacrifice to your repose, madam ; and to convince you that I had no hand in the plot, as you were misinformed, I have laid my commands on Mirabell to come in person, and be a witness that I give my hand to this flower of knighthood : and for the contract that passed"], [379, "THE WAY OF THE WORLD. SCENE X. 285 between Mirabell and me, I have obliged him to make a resignation of it in your ladyship's pre sence ; \u2014 he is without, and waits your leave for admittance. that to your cruel indignation I have offered up this beauty, and with her my peace and quiet ; nay, all my hopes of future comfort. Sir Wil. An he does not move me, would I may never be o' the quorum ! \u2014 an it were not as good a deed as to drink, to give her to him again, I would I might never take shipping ! \u2014 Aunt, if you don't forgive quickly, I shall melt, I can tell you that. My contract went no farther than a little mouth glue, and that's hardly dry ; \u2014 one doleful sigh more from my fellow-traveller, and 'tis dissolved. Lady Wish. Well, nephew, upon your account \u2014 Ah, he has a false insinuating tongue! \u2014 Well, sir, I will stifle my just resentment at my nephew's request. \u2014 I will endeavour what I can to forget, \u2014 but on proviso that you resign the contract with my niece immediately. Alir. It is in writing, and with papers of concern ; but I have sent my servant for it, and will deliver it to you, with all acknowledgments for your trans cendent goodness. Lady Wish. \u2014 [Aside.] Oh, he has witchcraft in his eyes and tongue ! \u2014 When I did not see him, I could have bribed a villain to his assassination ; but his appearance rakes the embers which have so long lain smothered in my breast. Lady Wish. Well, I'll swear I am something revived at this testimony of your obedience ; but I cannot admit that traitor. \u2014 I fear I cannot fortify myself to support his appearance. He is as terrible to me as a gorgon ; if I see him I fear I shall turn, to stone, and petrify incessantly. Mil. If you disoblige him, he may resent your refusal, and insist upon the contract still. Then 'tis the last time he will be offensive to you. Lady Wish. Are you sure it will be the last time ? \u2014 If I were sure of that \u2014 shall I never see him again ? Alii. Sir Wilfull, you and he are to travel together, are you not ? Sir Wil. S'heart, the gentleman's a civil gentle man, aunt, let him come in ; why, we are sworn brothers and fellow-travellers. \u2014 We are to be Pylades and Orestes, he and I. \u2014 He is to be my interpreter in foreign parts. He has been over seas once already ; and with proviso that I marry my cousin, will cross 'em once again, only to bear me company. \u2014 S'heart, I'll call him in, \u2014 an I set on't once, he shall come in ; and see who'll binder him. [Goes to the door and hems. Mar. This is precious fooling, if it would pass ; but I'll know the bottom of it. SCENE X. Lady Wish. O dear Marwood, you are not going ? Alar. Not far, madam ; I'll return immediately. Lady Wishfort, Millamant, Sir Wilfull, Mirabell, Fainall, and Mrs. Marwood. Fain. Your date of deliberation, madam, is expired. Here is the instrument ; are you pre pared to sign ? Lady Wish. If I were prepared, I am not im powered. My niece exerts a lawful claim, having matched herself by my direction to sir Wilfull. Fain. That sham is too gross to pass on me \u2014 though 'tis imposed on you, madam. Mil. Sir, I have given my consent. Afir. And, sir, I have resigned my pretensions. Sir Wil. And, sir, I assert my right ; and will maintain it in defiance of you, sir, and of your instrument. S'heart, an you talk of an instru ment, sir, I have an old fox by my thigh shall hack your instrument of ram vellum to shreds, sir ! \u2014 it shall not be sufficient for a mittimus or a tailor's measure. Therefore withdraw your instrument, sir, or, by'r Lady, I shall draw mine. Lady Wish. Hold, nephew, hold ! Mil. Good sir Wilfull, respite your valour. Fain. Indeed ! Are you provided of your guard, with your single beef-eater there ? but I'm prepared for you, and insist upon my first pro posal. You shall submit your own estate to my management, and absolutely make over my wife's to my sole use, as pursuant to the purport and tenor of this other covenant. \u2014 I suppose, madam, your consent is not requisite in this case ; nor, Mr. Mirabell, your resignation ; nor, sir Wilfull, your right. \u2014 You may draw your fox if you please, sir, and make a bear-garden flourish somewhere else; for here it will not avail. This, my lady Wish fort, must be subscribed, or your darling daugh ter's turned adrift, like a leaky hulk, to sink or swim, as she and the current of this lewd town can agree. SCENE IX.

If a deep sense of the many injuries I have offered to so good a lady, with a sincere remorse, and a hearty contrition, can but obtain the least glance of compassion, I am too happy. \u2014 Ah, madam, there was a time ! \u2014 but let it be forgotten \u2014 I con- fess I have deservedly forfeited the high place I once held of sighing at your feet. Nay, kill me not, by turning from me in disdain. \u2014 I come not to plead for favour ; \u2014 nay, not for pardon ; I am a suppliant only for pity \u2014 I am going where I never shall behold you more \u2014 Sir Wil. How, fellow-traveller ! you shall go by yourself then. Afir. Let me be pitied first, and afterwards for gotten. \u2014 I ask no more. Sir Wil. By'r Lady, a very reasonable request, and will cost you nothing, aunt I Come, come, forgive and forget, aunt ; why you must an you are a Christian. Afir. Consider, madam, in reality, you could not receive much prejudice ; it was an innocent device ; though I confess it had a face of guiltiness, \u2014 it was at most an artifice which love contrived ; \u2014 and errors which love produces have ever been accounted venial.

There are some critics so with spleen diseased, May such malicious fops this fortune find, They scarcely come inclining to be pleased : , To think themselves alone the fools design'd : And sure he must have more than mortal skill, j If any are so arrogantly vain, Who pleases any one against his will. | To think they singly can support a scene, Then all bad poets we are sure are foes, And furnish fool enough to entertain.

But that they have been damn'd for want of wit. For, as when painters form a matchless face, Since when, they by their own offences taught, They from each fair one catch some different grace; Set up for spies on plays, and finding fault. And shining features in one portrait blend, Others there are whose malice we'd prevent ; To which no single beauty must pretend; Such who watch plays with scurrilous intent So poets oft do in one piece expose To mark out who by characters are meant.

A natura discedimus ; populo nos damus, nullius rei bono auctori, et in hac re, sieut in omnibus, incon-tan tissimo. \u2014 Senhca, Epist. 99. ARGUMENT. After Jupiter's amour with Europa, the daughter of Agenor king of Ph\u0153nicia, he again incenses Juno by a new affair in the same family ; viz- with Semele, niece to Europa, and daughter to Cadmus king of Thebes. Semele is on the point of marriage with Athamas ; which marriage is about to be solemnised in the temple of Juno goddess of marriages, when Jupiter by ill omens interrupts the ceremony ; and afterwards transports Semele to a private abode prepared for her. Juno, after many contrivances, at length assumes the shape and voice of Ino, sister to Semele ; by the help of which disguise and artful insinuations she prevails with her to make a request to Jupiter, which being granted must end in her utter ruin. This fable is related in Ovid ; (Metatn, 1. iii.) but there Juno is said to impose on Semele in the shape of an old woman, her nurse. It is hoped, the liberty taken in substituting Ino instead of the eld woman will be excused : it was done, because Ino is interwoven in the design by her love of Athamas ; to whom she was married, according to Ovid ; and, because her character bears a proportion with the dignity of the other persons represented. This reason, it is presumed, may be allowed in a thing entirely fictitious ; and more especially being represented under the title of an opera, where greater absurdities are every day excused. It was not thought requisite to have any regard either to rhyme or equality of measure, in the lines of that part of the dialogue which was designed for the recitative style in music. For as that style in music is not confined to tbe strict observation of time and measure, which is required in the composition of airs and sonatas, so neither is it necessary that the same exactness in numbers, rhymes, or measure, should be observed in words designed to be set in that manner, which must ever be observed in the formation of odes and sonnets. For what they call recitative in musio, is only a more tuneable speaking, it is a kind of prose in music ; its beauty consists in coming near nature, and in improving the natural accents of words by more pathetic or emphatical tones.

Hear, mighty queen, while I recount What obstacles you must surmount. With adamant the gates are barr'd, Whose entrance two fierce dragons guard; At each approach they lash their forky stings, And clap their brazen wings : And as their scaly horrors rise, They all at once disclose A thousand fiery eyes, Which never know repose. Juno. Hence, Iris, hence away, Far from the realms of day ! O'er Scythian hills to the M\u0153otian lake A speedy flight we'll take : There Somnus I'll compel His downy bed to leave and silent cell : With noise and light I will his peace molest, Nor shall he sink again to pleasing rest, Till to my vow'd revenge he grants supplies, And seals with sleep the wakeful dragons' eyes. Juno. Iris ! impatient of thy stay, From Samos have I wing'd my way, To meet thy slow return ; Thou know'st what cares infest My anxious breast, And how with rage and jealousy I burn : Then why this long delay ?

BEING THE SEQUEL OF \" THE FOOL IN FASHION.\" THE PREFACE. To go about to excuse half the defects this abortive brat is come into the world with, would be to provoke the town with a long useless preface, when 'tis, I doubt, sufficiently soured already by a tedious play. I do therefore (with all the humility of a repenting sinner) confess, it wants everything \u2014 but length; and in that, I hope, the severest critic will be pleaied to acknowledge I have not been wanting. But my modesty will sure atone for everything, when the world shall know it is so great, I am even to this day insensible of those two shining graces in the play (which some part of the town is pleased to compliment me with) \u2014 blasphemy and bawdy. For my part, I cannot find them out. If there were any obscene expressions upon the stage, here they are in the print ; for I have dealt fairly, I have not sunk a syllable that could (though by racking of mysteries) be ranged under that head ; and yet I believe with a steady faith, there is not one woman of a real reputation in town, but when she has read it impartially over in her closet, will find it so innocent, she'll think it no affront to her prayer-book, to lay it upon the same Bhelf. So to them (with all manner of deference) I entirely refer my cause ; and I'm confident they'll justify me against those pretenders to good manners, who, at the same time, have so little respect for the ladies, they would extract a bawdy jest from an ejaculation, to put 'em out of countenance. But I expect to have these well-bred persons always my enemies, since I'm sure I shall never write anything lewd enough to make 'em my friends. As for the saints (your thorough-paced ones, I mean, with screwed faces and wry mouths) I despair of them, for they are friends to nobody. They love nothing but their altars and themselves. They have too much zeal to have any charity ; they make debauches in piety, as sinners do in wine ; and are as quarrelsome in their religion, as other people are in their drink : so I hope nobody will mind what they say. But if any man (with flat plod shoes, a little band, greasy hair, and a dirty face, who is wiser than I, at the expense of being forty years older) happens to be offended at a story of a cock and a bull, and a priest and a bull-dog, I beg his pardon with all my heart ; which, I hope, I shall obtain, by eating my words, and making this public recantation. I do therefore, for bis satisfaction, acknowledge I lied, when I said, they never quit their hold ; for in that little time I have lived in the world, I thank God I have seen 'em forced to it more than once: but next time I'll speak with more caution and truth, and only say, they have very good teeth. If I have offended any honest gentlemen of the town, whose friendship or good word is worth the having, I am very sorry for it ; I hope they'll correct me as gently as they can, when they consider I have had no other design, in running a very great risk, than to divert (if possible) some part of their spleen, in spite of their wives and their taxes. One word more about the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, but 'twas not my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, drinking his mistress's health in Nantes brandy, from six in the morning to the time he waddled on upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone, and am since (with all due respect to Mrs. Rogers) very sorry she scaped ; for I am confident a certain lady (let no one take it to herself that's handsome) who highly blames the play, for the barrenness of the conclusion, would then have allowed it a very natural close.

SPOKEN BY MISS CROSS Ladies, this Play in too much haste was writ, To be o'ercharged with either plot or wit ; 'Twas got, conceived, and born in six weeks' So out they lug in wresty Nature's spite, As some of you spruce beaux do \u2014 when you fight. Yet let the ebb of wit be ne'er so low, Some glimpse of it a man may hope to show, Upon a theme so ample as \u2014 a beau. So, howsoe'er true courage may decay, Perhaps there's not one smock-face here to-day, But's bold as C\u00e6sar \u2014 to attack a play. Nay, what's yet more, with an undaunted face, To do the thing with more heroic grace, 'Tis six to four ye attack the strongest place. You are such Hotspurs in this kind of venture, Where there's no breach, just there you needs must enter : space, And wit, yon know, 's as slow in growth as \u2014 grace. Sure it can ne'er be ripen'd to your taste ; I doubt 'twill prove, our author bred too fast : For mark 'em well, who with the Muses marry, They rarely do conceive, but they miscarry. 'Tis the hard fate of those who are big with rhyme, Still to be brought to bed before their time. Of our late poets Nature few has made ; The greatest part are \u2014 only so by trade. Still want of something brings the scribbling fit ; For want of money some of 'em have writ, And others do't, you see, for \u2014 want of wit. Honour, they fancy, summons 'em to write, But be advised \u2014 E'en give the hero and the critic o'er, For Nature sent you on another score ; \u2014 She form'd her beau, for nothing but her whore. PROLOGUE ON THE THIRD DAY. SPOKEN BY MRS, i. VERBRUGGEN. Apologies for Plays, experience shows, Are things almost as useless as \u2014 the beaux. Whate'er we say (like them) we neither move Your friendship, pity, anger, nor your love. 'Tis interest turns the globe ; let us but find The way to please you, and you'll soon be kind : But to expeet, you'd for our sakes approve, Is just as though you for their sakes should love ; And that, we do confess, we think a task Which (though they may impose) we never ought to ask. How have I shook, and trembling stood with awe, When here, behind the scenes, I've seen 'em draw \u2014 A comb ; that dead-doing weapon to the heart, And turn each powder'd hair into a dart ! When I have seen 'em sally on the stage, Dress'd to the war, and ready to engage, I've mourn'd your destiny \u2014 yet more their fate, To think, that after victories so great, It should so often prove their hard mishap To sneak into a lane, and get \u2014 a clap. But, hush ! they're here already ; I'll retire, And leave 'em to the ladies to admire. They'll show you twenty thousand arts and graces, They'll entertain you with their soft grimaces, Their snuffbox, awkward bows, and \u2014 ugly faces. In short, they're after all so much your friends, That lest the Play should fail, the author ends ; They have resolved to make you some amends. Between each act (perform'd by nicest rules) They'll treat you with \u2014 an Interlude of fools: Of which that you may have the deeper sense, The entertainment's \u2014 at their own expense. This is an age, where all things we improve, But, most of all, the art of making love. In former days, women were only won By merit, truth, and constant service done ; But lovers now are much more expert grown; They seldom wait, to approach by tedious form ; They're for despatch, for taking you by storm : Quick are their sieges, furious are their fires, Fierce their attacks, and boundless their desires. Before the Play's half ended, I'll engage To show you beaux come crowding on the stage, Who with so little pains have always sped, They'll undertake to look a lady dead. ACT I. As might have shaken the most holy hermit, And made him totter at his altar,) I never knew one moment's peace like this. Here, in this little soft retreat, My thoughts unbent from all the cares of life, Content with fortune, Eased from the grating duties of dependence, From envy flee, ambition under foot, The raging flame of wild destructive lust Reduced to a warm pleasing fire of lawful love, My life glides on, and all is well within. SCENE I.\u2014 A Room in Loveless's Country- House. Enter Loveless, reading. Love. How true is that philosophy, which savs Our heaven is seated in our minds ! Through all the roving pleasures of my youth, (Where nights and days seem all consumed in joy. Where the false face of luxury Display'd such charms,"], [397, "THE RELAPSE; OR, VIRTUE IN DANGER. SOENE I. 303 That gossip to and fro, And do a world of mischief where they come. But you shall soon be mistress of 'em all ; I'll aid you with such arms for their destruction, They never shall erect their heads again. You know the business is indispensable, that obliges me to go for London j and you have no reason, that I know of, to believe that I'm glad of the occasion. For my honest conscience is my witness, I have found a due succession of such charms In my retirement here with you, Enter Am.\\.vd.v How does the happy cause of my content, [Meeting her kindly. My dear Amanda ? You find me musing on my happy state, And full of grateful thoughts to Heaven, and you. Aman. Those grateful offerings Heaven can't receive With more delight than I do : Would I could share with it as well The dispensations of its bliss ! That I might search its choicest favours out, And shower 'em on your head for ever. Love. The largest boons that Heaven thinks fit I have never thrown one roving thought that way. But since, against my will, I'm dragg'd once more To that uneasy theatre of noise, I am resolved to make such use on't, As shall convince you 'tis an old cast mistress. Who has been so lavish of her favours, She's now grown bankrupt of her charms, And has not one allurement left to move me. to grant, To things it has decreed shall crawl on earth. Are in the gift of woman form'd like you. Perhaps when time shall be no more, When the aspiring soul shall take its flight, And drop this ponderous lump of clay behind it, It may have appetites we know not of, And pleasures as refined as its desires \u2014 \u25a0 But till that day of knowledge shall instruct me, The utmost blessing that my thought can reach, [Taking her in his arms. Is folded in my arms, and rooted in my heart. Aman. There let it grow for ever ! Lore. Well said, Amanda \u2014 let it be for ever \u2014 Would Heaven grant that \u2014 Aman. Her bow, I do believe, is grown so weak Her arrows (at this distance) cannot hurt you ; But in approaching 'em, you give 'em strength. The dart that has not far to fly, will put The best of armour to a dangerous trial. Love. That trial past, and you're at ease for ever; When you have seen the helmet proved, You'll apprehend no more for him that wears it. Therefore, to put a lasting period to your fears, I am resolved, this once, to launch into temptation : I'll give you an essay of all my virtues, My former boon companions of the bottle Shall fairly try what charms are left in wine : I'll take my place amongst them, They shall hem me in, Sing praises to their god, and drink his glory: Turn wild enthusiasts for his sake, Aman. 'Twere all the heaven I'd ask. But we are clad in black mortality, And the dark curtain of eternal night At last must drop between us. Love. It must. That mournful separation we must see, A bitter pill it is to all ; but doubles its ungrateful And beasts to do him honour : Wrhilst I, a stubborn atheist, Sullenly look on, taste, When lovers are to swallow it. Aman. Perhaps that pain may only be my lot, You possibly may be exempted from it. Men find out softer ways to quench their fires. Love. Can you then doubt my constancy, Amanda ? You'll find 'tis built upon a steady basis \u2014 The rock of reason now supports my love, On which it stands so fix'd, Without one reverend glass to his divinity. That for my temperance, Then for my constancy \u2014 Aman. Ay, there take heed. Love. Indeed the danger's small. Aman. And yet my fears are great. Love. Why are you so timorous ? Aman. Because you are so bold. Love. My courage should disperse your appre- hension. The rudest hurricane of wild desire Would, like the breath of a soft slumbering babe, Pass by, and never shake it. Aman. Yet still 'tis safer to avoid the storm ; The strongest vessels, if they put to sea, May possibly be lost. Would I could keep you here in this calm port for ever ! Aman. My apprehensions should alarm your courage. Love. Fy, fy, Amanda ! it is not kind thus to distrust me. Aman. And yet my fears are founded on my love. Forgive the weakness of a woman, I am uneasy at your going to stay so long in town ; I know its false insinuaiing pleasures ; I know the force of its delusions ; I know the strength of its attacks ; I know the weak defence of nature ; I know you are a man \u2014 and I \u2014 a wife. Love. You know then all that needs to give you Love. Your love then is not founded as it ought; For if you can believe 'tis possible I should again relapse to my past follies, I must appear to you a thing Of such an undigested composition, That but to think of me with inclination, Would be a weakness in your taste Your virtue scarce could answer. Aman. 'Twould be a weakness in my tongue ; My prudence could not answer, rest, For wife's the strongest claim that you can urge. When you would plead your title to my heart, On this you may depend. Therefore be calm, Banish your fears, for they Are traitors to your peace : beware of them, They are insinuating busy things If I should press you farther with my fears ; I'll therefore trouble you no longer with 'em. Love. Nor shall they trouble you much longer, A little time shall show you they were groundless: This winter shall be the fiery trial of my virtue ;"], [398, "THE RELAPSE ; OR, VIRTUE IN DANGER 304 ACT I.

Enter Tom Fashion, Lory, and Tug. Fash. Thou mayst as well say I can't take orders because I'm an atheist. Fash. Come, pay the waterman, and take the portmantle. Lory. Faith, sir, I think the waterman had as good take the portmantle, and pay himself. Fash. Why, sure there's something left in't ! Lory. But a solitary old waistcoat, upon my honour, sir. Lory. Sir, I ask your pardon ; I find I did not know the strength of your conscience so well as I did the weakness of your purse. Fash. Methinks, sir, a person of your experi ence should have known that the strength of the conscience proceeds from the weakness of the purse. Fash. Why, what's become of the blue coat, sirrah ? Lory. Sir, 'twas eaten at Gravesend ; the reck oning came to thirty shillings, and your privy purse was worth but two half-crowns. Lory. Sir, I am very glad to find you have a conscience able to take care of us, let it proceed from what it will ; but I desire you'll please to con sider, that the army alone will be but a scanty maintenance for a person of your generosity (at least as rents now are paid). I shall see you stand in damnable need of some auxiliary guineas for your menus plaisirs ; I will therefore turn fool once more for your service, and advise you to go directly to your brother. Fash. Art thou then so impregnable a block head, to believe he'll help me with a farthing ? Lory. Not if you treat him de haut en has, as you use to do. Fash. Why, how wouldst have me treat him ? Lory. Like a trout \u2014 tickle him. Fash. I can't flatter. Fash. 'Tis very well. Tug. Pray, master, will you please to despatch me ? Fash. Ay, here a \u2014 canst thou change me a guinea ? Lory. [Aside. ] Good ! Tug. Change a guinea, master ! Ha! hal your honour's pleased to compliment. Fash. Egad, I don't know how I shall pay thee then, for I have nothing but gold about me. Lory. [Aside.] Hum, hum ! Fash. What dost thou expect, friend ? Tug. Why, master, so far against wind and tide is richly worth half a piece. Fash. Why, faith, I think thou art a good con scionable fellow. Egad, I begin to have so good an opinion of thy honesty, I care not if I leave my portmantle with thee, till I send thee thy money. Tug. Ha ! God bless your honour ; I should be as willing to trust you, master, but that you are, as a man may say, a stranger to me, and these are nimble times; there are a great many sharpers stir ring. \u2014 [Taking up the portmantle.] Well, master, when your worship sends the money, your port mantle shall be forthcoming ; my name's Tug, my wife keeps a brandy-shop in Drab- Alley, at Wapping. Fash. Very well ; I'll send for't to-morrow. Lory. Can you starve ? Fash. Yes. Lory. I can't. \u2014 Good-by t'ye, sir \u2014 [Going. Fash. Stay ; thou wilt distract me ! What wouldst thou have me say to him ? Lory. Say nothing to him, apply yourself to his favourites, speak to his periwig, his cravat, his feather, his snuff box, and when you are well with them, desire him to lend you a thousand pounds. I'll engage you prosper. Fash. 'Sdeath and furies ! why was that cox comb thrust into the world before me ? O Fortune ! Fortune ! \u2014 thou art a bitch by Gad ! [Exeunt. [Exit Tug. Lory. So. \u2014 Now, sir, I hope you'll own your self a happy man, you have outlived all your cares. Fash. How so, sir? SCENE III. \u2014 A Room in Lord Foppington's House. Lory. Why you have nothing left to take care of. Fash. Yes, sirrah, I have myself and you to take care of still. Enter Lord ForpiNGTON in his nightgown. Lory.

Sir ! \u2014 Pray, sir, do me the favour to teach your tongue the title the king has thought fit to honour me with. Fash. Why, if thou canst tell me where to apply myself, I have at present so little money, and so much humility about me, I don't know but I may follow a fool's advice. Page.

So, gentlemen, I hope you have all taken pains to show yourselves masters in your professions. Tailor. I think I may presume to say, sir \u2014 La Ver. My lord \u2014 you clawn, you '. Tailor. Why, is he made a lord ? \u2014 My lord, I ask your lordship's pardon, my lord ; I hope, my lord, your lordship will please to own I have brought your lordship as accomplished a suit of clothes as ever peer of England trod the stage in, my lord. Will your lordship please to try 'em now ? Lord Fop. They hurt me just below the instep. Shoe. [Feeling his foot.] My lord, they don't hurt you there. Lord Fop. I tell thee, they pinch me execrably. Shoe. My lord, if they pinch you, I'll be bound to be hanged, that's all. Lord Fop. Why, wilt thou undertake to nersuaae me I cannot feel ? Lord Fop. Ay ; but let my people dispose the glasses so that I may see myself before and behind, for I love to see myself all raund.

Your lordship may please to feel what you think tit ; but that shoe does not hurt you \u2014 I think I understand my trade. Lord Fop. Now by all that's great and powerful, thou art an incomprehensible coxcomb ! but thou makest good shoes, and so I'll bear with thee. Shoe. My lord, I have worked for half the people of quality in town these twenty years ; and 'twere very hard I should not know when a shoe hurts. and when it don't. Fash. Heyday, what the devil have we here ? Sure my gentleman's grown a favourite at court, he has got so many people at his levee. Lory. Sir, these people come in order to make him a favourite at court ; they are to establish him with the ladies. Fash. Good God ! to what an ebb of taste are women fallen, that it should be in the power of a laced coat to recommend a gallant to 'em ! Lory. Sir, tailors and periwig-makers are now become the bawds of the nation ; 'tis they debauch all the women. Lord Fop. Well, prithee be gone about thy business. \u2014 [Exit Shoemaker.] Mr. Mendlegs, a word with you : the calves of these stockings are thickened a little too much. They make my legs look like a chairman's \u2014 Fash. Thou sayest true ; for there's that fop now has not by nature wherewithal to move a cook-maid, and by that time these fellows have done with him, egad he shall melt down a coun tess ! \u2014 But now for my reception ; I'll engage it shall be as cold a one as a courtier's to his friend, who comes to put him in mind of his promise. Alend. My lord, my thinks they look mighty well. Lord Fop. Ay, but you are not so good a judge of those things as I am, I have studied 'em all my life ; therefore pray let the next be the thickness of a crawn-piece less. \u2014 [Aside.] If the town takes notice my legs are fallen away, 'twill be attributed to the violence of some new intrigue \u2014 [Exit Mendlegs.] Come, Mr. Foretop, let meseewhat you have done, and then the fatigue of the morning will be over. Lord Fop. [To his Tailor.] Death and eternal tartures ! \u2014 Sir, I say the packet's too high by a foot. Tailor.

You old bawd, how have you the impudence to be hobbling out of your grave twenty years after you are rotten ! Coup. When you begin to rot, sirrah, you'll go off like a pippin ; one winter will send you to the devil. What mischief brings you home again ? Ha ! you young lascivious rogue you. Let me put my hand into your bosom, sirrah. Fash. Stand off, old Sodom ! Lord Fop. What it may be by weight, sir, I shall not dispute ; but by tale, there are not nine hairs of a side. Fore. 0 lord ! O lord ! O lord ! Why, as Gad shall judge me, your honour's side-face is reduced to the tip of your nose ! Lord Fop. My side-face may be in an eclipse for aught I know ; but I'm sure my full-face is like the full-moon. Coup. Nay, prithee now, don't be so coy. Fash. Keep your hands to yourself, you old dog you, or I'll wring your nose off. Coup. Hast thou then been a year in Italy, and brought home a fool at last ? By my conscience, the young fellows of this age profit no more by their going abroad than they do by their going to church. Sirrah, sirrah, if you are not hanged before you come to my years, \u2014 you'll know a cock from a hen. But, come, I'm still a friend to thy person, though I have a contempt of thy under standing ; and therefore I would willingly know thy condition, that I may see whether thou standest in need of my assistance : for widows swarm, my boy, the town's infected with 'em. Fash. I stand in need of anybody's assistance, that will help me to cut my elder brother's throat, without the risk of being hanged for him. Coup.

Not a souse, by Jupiter! Coup.

So, Lory ; Providence, thou seest at last, takes care of men of merit : we are in a fair way to be great people. Lory. Ay, sir, if the devil don't step between the cup and the lip, as he uses to do. Fash. Why, faith, he has played me many a damned trick to spoil my fortune, and egad I'm almost afraid he's at work about it again now ; but if I should tell thee how, thou'dst wonder at me. Coup. He has given me a bond of a thou sand pounds for helping him to this fortune, and has promised me as much more in ready money upon the day of marriage, which, I understand by a friend, he ne'er designs to pay me. If therefore you will be a generous young dog, and secure me five thousand pounds, I'll be a covetous old rogue, aud help you to the lady. Fash. Egad, if thou canst bring this about, I'll have thy statue cast in brass. But don't you dote, you old pander you, when you talk at this rate ? Coup. That your youthful parts shall judge of. This plump partridge, that I tell you of, lives in the country, fifty miles off, with her honoured parents, in a lonely old house which nobody comes near ; she never goes abroad, nor sees company at home. To prevent all misfortunes, she has her breeding within doors : the parson of the parish teaches her to play on the bass-viol, the clerk to sing, her nurse to dress, and her father to dance. In short, nobody can give you admittance there but I ; nor can I do it any other way than by making you pass for your brother. Fash. And how the devil wilt thou do that ? Lory. Indeed, sir, I should not. Fash. How dost know ? Lory. Because, sir, I have wondered at you so often, I can wonder at you no more. Fash. No ! what wouldst thou say if a qualm of conscience should spoil my design ? Lory. I would eat my words, and wonder more than ever. Fash. Why, faith, Lory, though I am a young rake-hell, and have played many a roguish trick ; this is so full-grown a cheat, I find I must take pains to come up to't, I have scruples \u2014 Lory. They are strong symptoms of death ; if you find they increase, pray, sir, make your will. Fash. No, my conscience shan't starve me nei ther. But thus far I'll hearken to it ; before I execute this project, I'll try my brother to the bottom, I'll speak to him with the temper of a philosopher ; my reasons (though they press him home) shall yet be clothed with so much modesty, not one of all the truths they urge shall be so naked to offend his sight. If he has yet so much humanity about him as to assist me (though with a moderate aid), I'll drop my project at his feet, and show him how I can do for him much more than what I ask he'd do for me. This one conclusive trial of him I resolve to make \u2014 Coup. Without the devil's aid, I warrant thee. Thy brother's face not one of the family ever saw, the whole business has been managed by me, and all the letters go through my hands. The last that was writ to Sir Tunbelly Clumsey (for that's the old gentleman's name), was to tell him, his lordship would be down in a fortnight to consummate. Now, you shall go away imme diately, pretend you writ that letter only to have the romantic pleasure of surprising your mistress ; fall desperately in love, as soon as you see her ; make that your plea for marrying her immediately, and, when the fatigue of the wedding-night's over, you shall send me a swinging purse of gold, you dog you.

That pleasing prospect will be my chief est entertainment, whilst (much against my will) I am obliged to stand surrounded with these empty pleasures, which 'tis so much the fashion to be fond of. Enter Loveless and Amanda. Love. How do you like these lodgings, my dear ? For my part, I am so well pleased with them, I shall hardly remove whilst we stay in town, if you are satisfied. Love. I own most of them are indeed but empty; nay, so empty, that one would wonder by what magic power they act, when they induce us to be vicious for their sakes. Yet some there are we may speak kindlier of. There are delights (of Aman. I am satisfied with everything that pleases you, else I had not come to town at all. Love. Oh ! a little of the noise and bustle of the world sweetens the pleasures of retreat. We shall X 2"], [402, "308 THE RELAPSE; OR, VIRTUE IN DANGER. ACT II. which a private life is destitute) which may divert an honest man, and be a harmless entertainment to a virtuous woman. The conversation of the town is one; and truly(with some small allowances), the plays, I think, may be esteemed another. Aman. The plays, I must confess, have some small charms ; and would have more, would they restrain that loose obscene encouragement to vice, which shocks, if not the virtue of some women, at least the modesty of all. Aman. Nor do you know what company was with her? Love. I do not. Aman. Then I am calm again. Love. Why were you disturbed :' Aman. Had I then no cause ? Love. None, certainly. Aman. I thought I had. Love. But you thought wrong, Amanda : for turn the case, and let it be your story ; should you come home, and tell me you had seen a handsome man, should I grow jealous because you had eyes ? Aman. But should I tell you he were exquisitely so ; that I had gazed on him with admiration ; that I had looked with eager eyes upon him ; should you not think 'twere possible I might go one step further, and inquire his name ? Love. [Aside.] She has reason on her side, I have talked too much ; but I must turn it off an other way. \u2014 [Aloud.] Will you then make no difference, Amanda, between the language of our sex and yours ? There is a modesty restrains your tongues, which makes you speak by halves when you commend; but roving flattery gives a loose to ours, which makes us still speak double what we think. You should not, therefore, in so strict a sense, take what I said to her advantage. Love. But till that reformation can be made, I would not leave the wholesome corn for some intruding tares that grow amongst us. Doubtless the moral of a well-wrought scene is of prevailing force. \u2014 Last night there happened one that moved me strangely. Aman. Pray, what was that ? Love. Why 'twas about \u2014 but 'tis not worth re- peating. Aman. Y7es, pay let me know it. Love. No ; I think 'tis as well let alone. Aman. Nay, now you make me have a mind to know. Love. 'Twas a foolish thing. You'd perhaps grow jealous should I tell it you, though without a cause, Heaven knows. Aman. I shall begin to think I have cause, if you persist in making it a secret. Love. I'll then convince you you have none, by making it no longer so. Know then, I happened in the play to find my very character, only with the addition of a relapse ; which struck me so, I put a sudden stop to a most harmless entertain ment, which till then diverted me between the acts. 'Twas to admire the workmanship of nature, in the face of a young lady that sat some distance from me, she was so exquisitely handsome ! \u2014 Aman. So exquisitely handsome ! Love. Why do you repeat my words, my dear ? Aman. Because you seemed to speak them with such pleasure, I thought I might oblige you with their echo. Aman. Those flights of flattery, sir, are to our faces only : when women once are out of hearing, you are as modest in your commendations as we are. But I shan't put you to the trouble of farther excuses, if you please this business shall rest here. Only give me leave to wish, both for your peace and mine, that you may never meet this miracle of beauty more. Love. I am content. Enter Servant. Ser. Madam, there's a young lady at the door in a chair, desires to know whether your ladyship sees company. I think her name is Berinthia. Aman. O dear ! 'tis a relation I have not seen this five years. Pray her to walk in. \u2014 [Exit Ser vant.] Here's another beauty for you. She was young when I saw her last ; but I hear she's grown extremely handsome. Love. Don't you be jealous now ; for I shall gaze upon her too. Love. Then you are alarmed, Amanda ? Aman. It is my duty to be so, when you are in danger. Love. You are too quick in apprehending for me ; all will be well when you have heard me out. I do confess I gazed upon her, nay, eagerly I gazed upon her. Enter Berinthia. \u2014 Ha ! by Heavens the very woman I [Aside. Her. [Saluting Amanda.] Dear Amanda, I did not expect to meet with you in town. Aman. Sweet cousin, I'm overjoyed to see you. \u2014 Mr. Loveless, here's a relation and a friend of mine, I desire you'll be better acquainted with. Love. [Saluting Berinthia] If my wife never desires a harder thing, madam, her request will be easily granted. Ber. I think, madam, I ought to wish you joy. Aman. Joy ! Upon what ? Ber. Upon your marriage : you were a widow when I saw you last. Love. You ought rather, madam, to wish me joy upon that, since I am the only gainer. Eer. If she has got so good a husband as the world reports, she has gained enough to expect the compliments of her friends upon it. Love. If the world is so favourable to me, to Aman. Eagerly ! that's with desire. Love. No, I desired her not : I viewed her with a world of admiration, but not one glance of love. Aman. Take heed of trusting to such nice dis tinctions. Love. I did take heed ; for observing in the play, that he who seemed to represent me there was, by an accident like this, unwarily surprised into a net, in which he lay a poor entangled slave, and brought a train of mischiefs on his head, I snatched my eyes away ; they pleaded hard for leave to look again, but I grew absolute, and they obeyed. Aman. Were they the only things that were in quisitive ? Had I been in your place, my tongue, I fancy, had been curious too ; I should have asked her name, and where she lived (yet still without design :) \u2014 Who was she, pray ? Love. Indeed I cannot tell. Aman. You will not tcli. allow I deserve that title, I hope 'tis so just to my wife to own I derive it from her. Love. By all that's sacred then, I did not ask."], [403, "THE RELAPSE; OR, VIRTUE IN DANGER. SCENE I. 309 Ber. Sir, it is so just to you both, to own you are (and deserve to be) the happiest pair that live in it. Lord Fop. Why, that's the fatigue I speak of, madam. For 'tis impassible to be quiet without thinking; now thinking is to me the greatest fatigue in the world. Love. I'm afraid we shall lose that character, madam, whenever you happen to change your condition. Aman. Does not your lordship love reading then? Lord Fop. Oh, passionately, madam But I never think of what I read. Re-enter Servant. Ser. Sir, my lord Foppington presents his hum ble service to you, and desires to know how you do. He but just now heard you were in town. He's at the next door ; and if it be not inconve nient, he'll come and wait upon you. Rer. Why, can your loraship read without thinking ? Lord Fop. O Lard ! \u2014 can your ladyship pray without devotion, madam ? Aman. Well, I must own I think books the best entertainment in the world. Love. Lord Foppington ! \u2014 I know him not. Ber. Not his dignity, perhaps, but you do his person. 'Tis sir Novelty ; he has bought a barony, in order to marry a great fortune. His patent has not been passed above eight-and-forty hours, and he has already sent how-do-ye's to all the town, to make 'em acquainted with his title. Love. Give my service to his lordship, and let him know I am proud of the honour he intends me. \u2014 [Exit Servant.] Sure this addition of qua lity must have so improved his coxcomb, he can't but be very good company for a quarter of an hour. Aman. Now it moves my pity more than my mirth, to see a man whom nature has made no fool, be so very industrious to pass for an ass. Love. No, there you are wrong, Amanda ; you should never bestow your pity upon those who take pains for your contempt. Pity those whom nature abuses, but never those who abuse nature. Lord Fop. I am so much of your ladyship's mind, madam, that I have a private gallery, where I walk sometimes, is furnished with nothing but books and looking-glasses. Madam, I have gilded 'em, and ranged 'em, so prettily, before Gad, it is the most entertaining thing in the world to walk and look upon 'em. Aman. Nay, I love a neat library too ; but 'tis, I think, the inside of a book should recommend it most to us. Lord Fop. That, I must confess, I am not altogether so sand of. Far to mind the inside of a book, is to entertain one's self with the forced pro duct of another man's brain. Naw I think a man of quality and breeding may be much better diverted with the natural sprauts of his own. But to say the truth, madam, let a man love reading never so well, when once he comes to know this tawn, he finds so many better ways of passing away the four-and twenty hours, that 'twere ten thousand pities he should consume his time in that. Far example, madam, my life ; my life, madam, is a perpetual stream of pleasure, that glides through such a variety of entertainments, I believe the wisest of our ancestors never had the least conception of any of 'em. I rise, madam, about ten a-clack. I don't rise sooner, because 'tis the worst thing in the world for the complexion ; nat that I pretend to be a beau; but a man must endeavour to look whole some, lest he make so nauseous a figure in the side bax, the ladies should be compelled to turn their eyes upon the play. So at ten a-clack, I say, I rise. Naw, if I find it a good day, I resalve to take a turn in the Park, and see the fine women ; so huddle on my clothes, and get dressed by one. If it be nasty weather, I take a turn in the choco late-hause: where as you walk, madam, you have the prettiest prospect in the world ; you have look ing-glasses all round you.- \u2014 But I'm afraid I tire the company. Ber. Not at all. Pray go on. Lord Fop. Why then, ladies, from thence I go to dinner at Lacket's, where you are so nicely and delicately served, that, stap my vitals ! they shall compose you a dish no bigger than a saucer, shall come to fifty shillings. Between eating my dinner (and washing my mouth, ladies) I spend my time, till I go to the play ; where, till nine a-clack, I entertain myself with looking upon the company; and usually dispose of one hour more in leading them aut. So there's twelve of the four-and twenty pretty well over. The other twelve, madam, are disposed of in two articles : in the first four I toast myself drunk, and in t'other eight I sleep myself sober again. Thus, ladies, you see my life is an eternal raund O of delights. Love. 'Tis a heavenly one, indeed. Ber. Besides, the town would be robbed of one of its chiefest diversions, if it should become a crime to laugh at a fool. Aman. I could never yet perceive the town inclined to part with any of its diversions, for the sake of their being crimes ; but I have seen it very fond of some I think had little else to recom mend 'em. Ber. I doubt, Amanda, you are grown its enemy, you speak with so much warmth against it. Aman. I must confess I am not much its friend. Ber. Then give me leave to make you mine, by not engaging in its quarrel. Aman. You have many stronger claims than that, Berinthia, whenever you think fit to plead your title. Love. You have done well to engage a second, my dear ; for here comes one will be apt to call you to an account for your country principles. Enter Lord Foppington. Lord Fop. Sir, I am your most humble servant. Love. I wish you joy, my lord. Lord Fop. O Lard, sir! \u2014 Madam, your lady ship's welcome to tawn. Aman. I wish your lordship joy. Lord Fop.

Aman. Your lordship's too entertaining to grow troublesome anywhere. Lord Fop. [Aside.] That now was as much as if she had said \u2014 pray lie with me. I'll let her see I'm quick of apprehension. \u2014 [To Amanda.] 0 Lard, madam ! I had like to have forgot a secret, I must needs tell your ladyship. \u2014 [To Loveless.] Ned, you must not be so jealous now as to listen. Love. Not I, my lord ; I'm too fashionable a husband to pry into the secrets of my wife. Lord Fop. [ To Amanda, squeezing her hand. ] I am in love with you to desperation, strike me speechless ! Aman. [Giving him a box on the ear.] Then, thus I return your passion. \u2014 An impudent fool ! Lord Fop. Gads curse, madam, I'm a peer of the realm ! Aman. But I thought, my lord, you beaux spent a great deal of your time in intrigues : you have given us no account of 'em yet. Lord Fop. [Aside.] Son ; she would inquire into my amours \u2014 That's jealousy : \u2014 she begins to be in love with me. \u2014 [To Amanda] Why, madam, as to time for my intrigues, I usually make detach ments of it from my other pleasures, according to the exigency. Far your ladyship may please to take notice, that those who intrigue with women of quality, have rarely occasion for above half an hour at a time : people of that rank being under those decorums, they can seldom give you a langer view than will just serve to shoot 'em flying. So that the course of my other pleasures is not very much interrupted by my amours. Love. But your lordship is now become a pillar of the state ; you must attend the weighty affairs of the nation. Lord Fop. Sir, \u2014 as to weighty affairs \u2014 I leave them to weighty heads. I never intend mine shall be a burden to my body. Love. O but you'll find the house will expect your attendance. Lord Fop. Sir, you'll find the house will com pound for my appearance. Love. But your friends will take it ill if you don't attend their particular causes. Lord Fop. Not, sir, if I come time enough to give 'em my particular vote. Ber. But pray, my lord, how do you dispose of yourself on Sundays ? for that, methinks, should hang wretchedly on your hands. Lord Fop. Why faith, madam \u2014 Sunday \u2014 is a vile day, I must confess. I intend to move for leave to bring in a bill, that players may work upon it, as well as the hackney coaches. Though this I must say for the government, it leaves us the churches to entertain us. \u2014 But then again, they begin so abominable early, a man must rise by candle-light to get dressed by the psalm. Ber. Pray which church does your lordship most oblige with your presence ? Lord Fop. Oh, St. James's, madam : \u2014 there's much the best company. Aman. Is there good preaching too ? Lord Fop. Why faith, madam \u2014 I can't tell. A man must have very little to do there that can give an account of the sermon. Love. Hey ; what the devil do you affront my wife, sir ? Nay then \u2014 [They draw and fight. The ladies run shrieking for help. Aman. Ah 1 What has my folly done ! Help ! murder ! help ! part 'em for Heaven's sake. Lord Fop.

Aman. Alas, my lord ! I am the worst company in the world at church : I'm apt to mind the prayers, or the sermon, or \u2014 Lord Fop. One is indeed strangely apt at church to mind what one should not do. But I hope, madam, at one time or other, I shall have the honour to lead your ladyship to your coach there. \u2014 [Aside.] Methinks she seems strangely pleased with everything I say to her. \u2014 'Tis a vast pleasure to receive encouragement from a woman before her husband's faee. \u2014 I have a good mind to pursue my Syr. Why, what if I won't look upon his wound this hour, sir ? Love. Why then he'll bleed to death, sir. Syr. Why, then I'll fetch him to life again, sir. Love.

He thinks his title an authentic passport to every woman's heart below the degree of a peeress. Wor. He's coxcomb enough to think anything. But I would not have you brought into trouble for him : I hope there's no danger of his life ? Love. None at all. He's fallen into the hands of a roguish surgeon, who I perceive designs to frighten a little money out of him. But I saw his wound, 'tis nothing ; he may go to the play to-night, if he pleases. Wor. I am glad you have corrected him with- out farther mischief. And now, sir, if these ladies have no farther service for you, you'll oblige me if you can go to the place I spoke to you of t'other day.

Only a woman's foolish question, \u2014 how do you like my cousin here ? Love. Jealous already, Amanda ? Aman. Not at all, I ask you for another reason. Love. [Aside.] Whate'er her reason be, I must not tell her true. \u2014 [To Amanda.] Why, I confess she's handsome. But you must not think I slight your kinswoman, if I own to you, of all the women who may claim that character, she is the last would triumph in my heart. Aman. I'm satisfied. Syr. Then you shall dress it, sir ; for if anybody looks upon it, I won't. Love. Why, thou art the veriest coxcomb I ever saw. Syr. Sir, I am not master of my trade for nothing. Lord Fop. Surgeon ! Syr.

Why then perhaps there may be hopes. But we must avoid further delay. \u2014 Here ; help the gentleman into a chair, and carry him to my house presently, that's the properest place \u2014 [Aside] to bubble him out of his money. \u2014 [Aloud. ] Come, a chair, a chair quickly \u2014 there, in with him.

I shall hardly think it worth my prosecut ing any further, so you may be at rest, sir. Lord Fop. Thou art a generous fellow, strike me dumb ! \u2014 [Aside.] But thou hast an impertinent wife, stap my vitals ! Syr. So, carry him off ! carry him off ! we shall have him prate himself into a fever by-and-by ; carry him off. [Exit with Lord Foppington. Aman. Now on my knees, my dear, let me ask your pardon for my indiscretion, my own I never shall obtain. Love. Oh, there's no harm done : you served him well. Love. Now tell me why you asked ? Aman. At night I will. Adieu. Love. I'm yours. [Kisses her and exit. Aman. [Aside.'] I'm glad to find he does not like her ; for I have a great mind to persuade her to come and live with me. \u2014 [Aloud.] Now, dear Berinthia, let me inquire a little into your affairs : for I do assure you 1 am enough your friend to interest myself in everything that concerns you. Ber. You formerly have given me such proofs on't I should be very much to, blame to doubt it ; I am sorry I have no secrets to trust you with, that I might convince you how entire a confidence I durst repose in you. Aman. Why, is it possible that one so young and beautiful as you should live and have no secrets. Aman. He did indeed deserve it. But I trem ble to think how dear my indiscreet resentment might have cost you. Love. Oh, no matter, never trouble yourself about that. Ber. For Heaven's sake, what was't he did to you ? Aman. 0 nothing ; he only squeezed me kindly by the hand, and frankly offered me a coxcomb's heart. I know I was to blame to resent it as I did, since nothing but a quarrel could ensue. But the fool so surprised me with his insolence, I was not mistress of my fingers. Ber. Now, I dare swear, he thinks you had 'em at great command, they obeyed you so readily. Ber. What secrets do you mean ? Aman. Lovers. Enter \"Worthy. Wor. Save you, save you, good people : I'm glad to find you all alive ; I met a wounded peer carrying off. For Heaven's sake, what was the matter. Ber. Oh, twenty! but not one secret one amongst 'em. Lovers in this age have too much honour to do anything underhand; they do all aboveboard. Aman. That now, methinks, would make me hate a man. Love. Oh, a trifle ! He would have lain with my wife before my face, so she obliged him with a box o'th' ear, and I run him through the body : that was all. Ber. But the women of the town are of another mind : for by this means a lady may (with the expense of a few coquette glances) lead twenty fools about in a string for two or three years together. Whereas, if she should allow 'em greater favours, and oblige 'em to secrecy, she would not keep one of 'em a fortnight. Aman. There's something indeed in that to Wor. Bagatelle on all sides. But, pray madam, how long has this noble lord been a humble servant of yours ? Aman. This is the first I have heard on't. So, I suppose, 'tis his quality more than his love has"], [406, "312 THE RELAPSE ; OR, VIRTUE IN DANGER. ACT II. satisfy the vanity of a woman, but I can't compre hend how the men find their account in it. in town who has a better interest with the women, that are worth having an interest with. But 'tis all private : he's like a back-stair minister at court, who, whilst the reputed favourites are sauntering in the bedchamber, is ruling the roast in the closet. Ber. Their entertainment, I must confess, is a riddle to me. For there's very few of them ever get farther than a bow and an ogle. I have half a score for my share, who follow me all over the town ; and at the play, the Park, and the church, do (with their eyes) say the violentest things to me. \u2014 But 1 never hear any more of 'em. Aman. What can be the reason of that ? Aman. He answers then the opinion I had ever of him. Heavens! What a difference there is between a man like him, and that vain nauseous fop, sir Novelty. \u2014 [Taking her hand.] I must acquaint you with a secret, cousin. 'Tis not that fool alone has talked to me of love, Worthy has been tampering too. 'Tis true, he has done it in vain : not all his charms or art have power to shake me. My love, my duty, and my virtue, are such faithful guards, I need not fear my heart should e'er betray me. But what I wonder at is this : I find I did not start at his proposal, as when it came from one whom I contemned. I therefore mention this attempt, that I may learn from you whence it proceeds ; that vice (which cannot change its nature) should so far change at least its shape, as that the self-same crime proposed from one shall seem a monster gaping at your ruin ; when from another it shall look so kind, as though it were your friend, and never meant to harm you. Whence, think you, can this difference proceed ? For 'tis not love, Heaven knows. Ber. One reason is, they don't know how to go farther. They have had so little practice, they don't understand the trade. But, besides their igno ranee, you must know there is not one of my half score lovers but what follows half a score mistresses. Now, their affections being divided amongst so many, are not strong enough for any one to make 'em pursue her to the purpose. Like a young puppy in a warren, they have a flirt at all, and catch none. Aman. Yet they seem to have a torrent of love to dispose of. Ber. They have so. But 'tis like the river of a modern philosopher, (whose works, though a woman, I have read,) it sets out with a violent stream, splits in a thousand branches, and is all lost in the sands. Aman. But do you think this river of love runs all its course without doing any mischief ? Do you think it overflows nothing ? Ber. O yes ; 'tis true, it never breaks into any body's ground that has the least fence about it ; but it overflows all the commons that lie in its way. And this is the utmost achievement of those dreadful champions in the field of love \u2014 the beaux. Aman. But prithee, Berinthia, instruct me a little farther ; for I am so great a novice I'm almost ashamed on't. My husband's leaving me whilst I was young and fond threw me into that depth of discontent, that ever since I have led so private and recluse a life, my ignorance is scarce conceivable. I therefore fain would be instructed. Not (Heaven knows) that what you call intrigues have any charms for me ; my love and principles are too well fixed. The practic part of all unlaw ful love is \u2014 Ber. O no ; I would not for the world believe it were. But possibly, should there a dreadful sentence pass upon you, to undergo the rage of both their passions ; the pain you apprehend from one might seem so trivial to the other, the danger would not quite so much alarm you. Aman. Fy, fy, Berinthia ! you would indeed alarm me, could you incline me to a thought, that all the merit of mankind combined could shake that tender love I bear my husband. No, he sits triumphant in my heart, and nothing can dethrone him. Ber. But should he abdicate again, do you think you should preserve the vacant throne ten tedious winters more in hopes of his return ? Aman. Indeed I think I should. Though I confess, after those obligations he has to me, should he abandon me once more, my heart would grow extremely urgent with me to root him thence, and cast him out for ever. Ber. Oh, 'tis abominable ! But for the specu lative ; that we must all confess is entertaining. The conversation of all the virtuous women in the town turns upon that and new clothes. Ber. Were I that thing they call a slighted wife, somebody should run the risk of being that thing they call \u2014 a husband. Aman. O fy, Berinthia ! no revenge should ever be taken against a husband.

[Aside.] Alack a-day, there has gone more than that to improve me, if she knew all ! Aman. For Heaven's sake, Berinthia, tell me what way I shall take to persuade you to come and live with me ? Aman. Pray be so just then to me to believe, 'tis with a world of innocency I would inquire, whether you think those women we call women of reputation, do really 'scape all other men, as they do those shadows of 'em, the beaux. Ber. O no, Amanda; there are a sort of men make dreadful work amongst 'em : men that may be called the beaux antipathy ; for they agree in nothing but walking upon two legs. \u2014 These have brains, the beau has none. These are in love with their mistress, the beau with himself. They take care of her reputation, he's industrious to destroy it. They are decent, he's a fop. They are sound, he's rotten. They are men, he's an ass. Aman. If this be their character, 1 fancy we had here e'en now a pattern of 'em both. Ber. His lordship and Mr. Worthy ? Aman. The same. Ber.

He eating and drinking, I carding and playing. He the sound of a horn, I the squeak of a fiddle. We were dull company at table, worse a-bed. Whenever we met, we gave one another the spleen ; and never agreed but once, which was about lying alone. Aman. But tell me one thing truly and sincerely. Ber. What's that ? Aman. Nay, but to grow so passionately fond, that nothing butthe man you love can give you rest. Ber. Well, what then ? Aman. Why then you'll marry him. Ber. How do you know that ? Aman.

So well, that I have ardered my coach to the door : so there's no great danger of death this baut, Tam. Enter Lord Foppington and Servant. Lord Fop. Hey, fellow, let the coach come to the door. Ser. Will your lordship venture so soon to expose yourself to the weather ? Lord Fop. Sir, I will venture as soon as I can, to expose myself to the ladies ; though give me my cloak, however ; for in that side-box, what between the air that comes in at the door on one side, and the intolerable warmth of the masks on t'other, a man gets so many heats and colds, 'twould destroy the canstitution of a harse. Fash. I'm very glad of it. Lord Fop. [Aside.] That I believe's a lie. \u2014 [Aloud.] Prithee, Tam, tell me one thing : did not your heart cut a caper up to your mauth, when you heard I was run through the bady ? Fash. Why do you think it should ? Lord Fop Because I remember mine did so, when I heard my father was shat through the head. Ser. [Putting on his cloak.] I wish your lord ship would please to keep house a little longer ; I'm afraid your honour does not well consider your wound. Fash. It then did very ill. Lord Fop. Prithee, why so ? Fash. Because he used you very well. Lord Fop. Well ? \u2014 naw, strike me dumb ! he starved me. He has let me want a thausand wo men for want of a thausand paund. Lord Fop.

If I were a younger brother, I should think so too. Lord Fop. Thau art willing to receive it any haw, strike me speechless ! But these are damned times to give money in, taxes are so great, repairs so exorbitant, tenants such rogues, and periwigs so dear, that the devil take me, I am reduced to that extremity in my cash, I have been farced to retrench in that one article of sweet pawder, till I have braught it dawn to five guineas a manth. Naw judge, Tam, whether I can spare you five hundred paunds. Fash. If you can't I must starve, that's all. \u2014 [Aside.] Damn him I Lord Fop. All I can say is, you should have been a better husband. Fash. Why, is it possible you can value a wo man that's to be bought ? Lord Fop. Prithee, why not as well as a pad nag ? Fash. Because a woman has a heart to dispose of ; a horse has none. Lord Fop. Look you, Tam, of all things that belang to a woman, I have an aversion to her heart. Far when once a woman has given you her heart \u2014 you can never get rid of the rest of her bady. Fash. This is strange doctrine. But pray in your amours how is it with your own heart ? Lord Fop. Why, my heart in my amours \u2014 is like \u2014 my heart aut of my amours ; a la glace. My bady, Tam, is a watch ; and my heart is the pen dulum to it ; whilst the finger runs raund to every hour in the circle, that still beats the same time. Fash. Oons, if you can't live upon five thou sand a year, how do you think I should do't upon two hundred ? Lord Fop. Don't be in a passion, Tam, far passion is the most unbecoming thing in the world \u2014 to the face. Look you, I don't love to say anything to you to make you malancholy ; but upon this occasion I must take leave to put you in mind, that a running horse does require more attendance than a coach-horse. Nature has made some difference 'twixt you and I. Fash. Then you are seldom much in love ? Lord Fop. Never, stap my vitals ! Fash. Why then did you make all this bustle about Amanda ? Fash. Yes, she has made you older. \u2014 [Aside.] Pox take her ! Lord Fop. Because she was a woman of an inso lent virtue, and I thought myself piqued in honour to debauch her. lord Fop. That is nat all, Tam. Fash. Why, what is there else ? Lord Fop. [Looking first upon himself, then upon his brother. ] Ask the ladies. Fash.

Now, by all that's great and powerful, thou art the prince of coxcombs ! Lord Fop. Sir \u2014 I am praud of being at the head of so prevailing a party. Fash. Will nothing then provoke thee ? Draw, coward ! Fash. Very well. \u2014 [Aside.] Here's a rare fellow for you, to have the spending of five thousand pounds a year ! But now for my business with him. \u2014 [Aloud. ] Brother, though I know to talk to you of business (especially of money) is a theme not quite so entertaining to you as that of the ladies ; my necessities are such, I hope you'll have patience to hear me. Lord Fop. The greatness of your necessities, Tam, is the worst argument in the world for your being patiently heard. I do believe you are going to make me a very good speech, but, strike me dumb ! it has the worst beginning of any speech I have heard this twelvemonth. Lord Fop Look you, Tam, you know I have always taken you for a mighty dull fellow, and here is one of the foolishest plats broke out that I have seen a long time. Your paverty makes your life so burdensome to you, you would pro voke me to a quarrel, in hopes either to slip through my lungs into my estate, or to get your self run through the guts, to put an end to your pain. But I will disappoint you in both your designs ; far, with the temper of a philasapher, and the discretion of a statesman \u2014 I will go to the play with my sword in my scabbard. [Exit. Fash. So ! Farewell, snuff-box ! and now, conscience, I defy thee. \u2014 Lory ! Fash. I'm very sorry you think so. Lord Fop. I do believe thou art. But come, let's know thy affair quickly ; far 'tis a new play, and I shall be so rumpled and squeezed with pressing through the crawd, to get to my servant, the women will think I have lain all night in my clothes. Fash. Why then (that I may not be the author of so great a misfortune) my case in a word is this. The necessary expenses of my travels have so much exceeded the wretched income of my annuity, that I have been forced to mortgage it for five hundred pounds, which is spent ; so that unless you are so kind to assist me in redeeming it, I know no remedy but to take a purse. Lord Fop. Why, faith, Tarn \u2014 to give you my sense of the thing, I do think taking a purse the best remedy in the world : for if you succeed, you are relieved that way ; if you are taken \u2014 you are relieved t'other. Enter Lory. Lory. Sir ! Fash. Here's rare news, Lory ; his lordship has given me a pill has purged off all my scruples. Lory. Then my heart's at ease again. For 1 have been in a lamentable fright, sir, ever since your conscience had the impudence to intrude into your company. Fash. I'm glad to see you are in so pleasant a humour, I hope I shall find the effects on't. Lord Fop. Why, do you then really think it a reasonable thing I should give you five hundred paunds ? Fash. I do not ask it as a due, brother, I am willing to receive it as a favour. Fash. Be at peace, it will come there no more : my brother has given it a wring by the nose, and I have kicked it down stairs.

Undoing, was't, I said ! \u2014 who shall undo her ? Is not her empire fix'd ? am I not hers ? Did she not rescue me, a grovelling slave, When chain'd and bound by that black tyrant vice, I labour'd in his vilest drudgery ? Did she not ransom me, and set me free ? Love. Were I but sure of that, I'd quickly lay my case before you. Ber. Whether you are sure of it or no, what risk do you run in trying ? Love. Oh ! a very great one. Ber. How ? Love. You might betray my distemper to my wife. Nay more : when by my follies sunk To a poor tatter'd despicable beggar, Did she not lift me up to envied fortune !

Yet hold \u2014 if laying down my life Be demonstration of my love, What is't I feel in favour of Berinthia ? For should she be in danger, methinks I could incline to risk it for her service too ; and yet I do not love her. How then subsists my proof? \u2014 Oh, I have found it out ! What I would do for one, is demonstration of my love ; and if I'd do as much for t'other : it there is demonstration of my friendship Ay \u2014 it must be so. I find I'm very much her friend. Yet let me ask myself one puz zling question more : Whence springs this mighty friendship all at once ? For our acquaintance is of later date. Now friendship's said to be a plant of tedious growth, its root composed of tender fibres, nice in their taste, cautious in spreading, Check'd with the least corruption in the soil ; Long ere it take, And longer still ere it appear to do so : Whilst mine is in a moment shot so high, And fix'd so fast, It seems beyond the power of storms to shake it. I doubt it thrives too fast. [Musing. Love. By what ? Ber. By woman. Love. That's swearing by my deity. Do it by your own, or I shan't believe you. Ber. By man then. Love. I'm satisfied. Now hear my symptoms, and give me your advice. The first were these : When 'twas my chance to see you at the play, A random glance you threw at first alarm'd me, I could not turn my eyes from whence the danger came : I gazed upon you till you shot again, And then my fears came on me. My heart began to pant, my limbs to tremble, My blood grew thin, my pulse beat quick, my eyes Grew hot and dim, and all the frame of nature Shook with apprehension. 'Tis true, some small recruits of resolution My manhood brought to my assistance ; And by their help I made a stand a while, But found at last your arrows flew so thick, They could not fail to pierce me ; so left the field, And fled for shelter to Amanda's arms. What think you of these symptoms, pray ? Ber. Feverish every one of 'em. But what relief pray did your wife afford you? Love. Why, instantly she let me blood ; Which for the present much assuaged my flame. But when I saw you, out it burst again, And raged with greater fury than before. Nay, since yon now appear, 'tis so increased, That in a moment, if you do not help me, I shall, whilst you look on, consume to ashes. Enter Berinthia.

I think you are so much a deeper politician in these affairs than I am, that I ought to have a very great regard to your advice. Wor. Then give me leave to put you in mind, that the most easy, safe, and pleasant situation for your own amour, is the house in which you now are, provided you keep Amanda from any sort of suspicion. That the way to do that, is to engage her in an intrigue of her own, making yourself her confidant. And the way to bring her to intrigue, is to make her jealous of her husband in a wrong place ; which the more you foment, the less you'll be suspected. This is my scheme, in short ; which if you follow as you should do, my dear Berinthia, we may all four pass the winter very pleasantly. Ber.

Your lordship does me too much honour. It was exposing your person to too much Hoyd. Well, what do you make such a noise for, ha? what do you din a body's ears for? Can't one be at quiet for you ? Nurse. What do I din your ears for ! Here's one come will din your ears for you. Hoyd. What care I who's come ? I care not a fig who comes, nor who goes, as long as I must be locked up like the ale-cellar. Nurse. That, miss, is for fear you should be drunk before you are ripe. Hoyd. Oh, don't you trouble your head about that ; I'm as ripe as you, though not so mellow. Nurse. Very well ; now have I a good mind to lock you up again, and not let you see my lord to night. Hoyd.

Ah, poor girl, she'll be scared out of her wits on her wedding-night ; for, honestly speak ing, she does not know a man from a woman but by his beard and his breeches. Fash. Sir, I don't doubt but she has a virtuous education, which with the rest of her merit makes me long to see her mine. I wish you would dis pense with the canonical hour, and let it be this very night.

SCENE I.\u2014 A Boom in Sir Tunbelly Clum- sey's Country- House. Hoyd. Sir (my lord, I meant), you may speak to me about what you please, I shall give you a civil answer. Enter Miss Hoyden and Nurse. Fash. You give me so obliging a one, it encou rages me to tell you in few words what I think both for your interest and mine. Your father, I sup pose you know, has resolved to make me happy in being your husband, and I hope I may depend upon your consent, to perform what he desires. Hoyd. Sir, I never disobey my father in anything but eating of green gooseberries. Fash. So good a daughter must needs be an admirable wife ; lam therefore impatient till you are mine, and hope you will so far consider the violence of my love, that you won't have the cruelty to defer my happiness so long as your father designs it. Hoyd. Pray, my lord, how long is that ? Fash. Madam, a thousand year \u2014 a whole week. Hoyd. A week ! \u2014 why I shall be an old woman by that time. Fash. And I an old man, which you'll find a greater misfortune than t'other. Hoyd. Why I thought it was to be to-morrow morning, as soon as I was up ; I'm sure nurse told me so. Nurse. Well, miss, how do you like your hus band that is to be ? Hoyd. O Lord, nurse ! I'm so overjoyed I can scarce contain myself. Nurse. Oh, but you must have a care of being too food ; for men now-a-days hate a woman that loves 'em. Hoyd. Love him ! why do you think I love him, nurse ? ecod I would not care if he were hanged, so I were but once married to him ! \u2014 No \u2014 that which pleases me, is to think what work I'll make when I get to London ; for when I am a wife and a lady both, nurse, ecod I'll flaunt it with the best of 'em. Nurse. Look, look, if his honour be not a-com ing again to you ! Now, if I were sure you would behave yourself handsomely, and not disgrace me that have brought you up, I'd leave you alone to gether. Hoyd. That's my best nurse, do as you would be done by ; trust us together this once, and if I don't show my breeding from the head to the foot of me, may I be twice married, and die a maid. Nurse. Well this once I'll venture you ; but if you disparage me \u2014 Hoyd. Never fear, I'll show him my parts, I'll warrant him. \u2014 [Exit Nurse.] These old women are so wise when they get a poor girl in their clutches ! but ere it be long, I shall know what's what, as well as the best of 'em. Fash. And it shall be to-morrow morning still, if you'll consent. Hoyd. If I'll consent ! Why I thought I was to obey you as my husband. Fash. That's when we are married ; till then, I am to obey you. Hoyd. Why then if we are to take it by turns, it's the same thing ; I'll obey you now, and when we are married, you shall obey me. Fash. With all my heart ; but I doubt we must get nurse on our side, or we shall hardly prevail with the chaplain. Hoyd. No more we shan't indeed, for he loves Enter Tom Fashion. Fash.

Why then, my dear little bedfellow, if you'll call her hither, we'll try to persuade her presently. Hoyd. O Lord, I can tell you a way how to per suade her to anything. Fash. How's that ? young folks, you know, are impatient, and sir Tunbelly would make us stay a week for a wedding dinner. Now all things being signed and sealed, and agreed, I fancy there could be no great harm in practising a scene or two of matrimony in private, if it were only to give us the better assurance when we come to play it in public. Nurse. Nay, I must confess stolen pleasures are sweet ; but if you should be married now, what will you do when sir Tunbelly calls for you to be wedded ? Hoyd. Why tell her she's a wholesome comely woman \u2014 and give her half-a-crown. Fash. Nay, if that will do she shall have half a score of 'em. Hoyd. Why then we'll be married again. Nurse. What, twice, my child ? Hoyd. Ecod, I don't care how often I'm married, not I. Hoyd. O gemini ! for half that, she'd marry you herself. I'll run and call her. [Exit. Fash. So, matters go swimmingly. This is a rare girl, i' faith ; I shall have a fine time on't with her at London. I'm much mistaken if she don't prove a March hare all the year round. What a scampering chase will she make on't, when she finds the whole kennel of beaux at her tail ! hey to the park, and the play, and the church, and the devil ; she'll show them sport, I'll warrant 'em. But no matter, she brings an estate will afford me a separate maintenance. Fash. Pray, nurse, don't you be against your young lady's good, for by this means she'll have the pleasure of two wedding-days. Hoyd. [ To Nurse softly.] And of two wedding nights too, nurse. Nurse. Well, I'm such a tender-hearted fool, I find I can refuse nothing ; so you shall e'en follow your own inventions. Hoyd. Shall I !\u2014 [Aside.] O Lord, I could leap over the moon ! Re-enter Miss Hoyden and Nurse. Fash. Dear nurse, this goodness of yours shan't go unrewarded ; but now you must employ your power with Mr. Bull the chaplain, that he may do us his friendly office too, and then we shall all be happy : do you think you can prevail with him ? Nurse. Prevail with him ! \u2014 or he shall never prevail with me, I can tell him that. How do you do, good mistress nurse ? I desired your young lady would give me leave to see you, that I might thank you for your extraordinary care and conduct in her education ; pray accept of this small acknowledgment for it at present, and depend upon my farther kindness, when I shall be that happy thing her husband. Nurse. [Aside.] Gold by mackings ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Your honour's goodness is too great ; alas ! all I can boast of is, I gave her pure good milk, and so your honour would have said, an you had seen how the poor thing sucked it. \u2014 Eh, God's blessing on the sweet face on't ! how it used to hang at this poor teat, and suck and squeeze, and kick and sprawl it would, till the belly on't was so full, it would drop off like a leech. Hoyd. [Aside to Nurse angrily.] Pray one word with you. Prithee nurse don't stand ripping up old stories, to make one ashamed before one's love. Do you think such a fine proper gentleman as he cares for a fiddlecome tale of a draggle tailed girl ? If you have a mind to make him have a good opinion of a woman, don't tell him what one did then, tell him what one can do now. \u2014 [ To Tom Fashion.] I hope your honour will excuse my mismanners to whisper before you ; it was only to give some orders about the family. Fash. O everything, madam, is to give way to business ! Besides, good housewifery is a very com mendable quality in a young lady. Hoyd. Pray, sir, are the young ladies good house wives at London town ? Do they darn their own linen ? Hoyd. My lord, she has had him upon the hip this seven year. Fash. I'm glad to hear it ; nowever to strengthen your interest with him, you may let him know I have several fat livings in my gift, and that the first that falls shall be in your disposal. Nurse. Nay, then I'll make him marry more folks than one, I'll promise him. Hoyd. Faith do, nurse, make him marry you too, I'm sure he'll do't for a fat living : for he loves eating more than he loves his Bible ; and I have often heard him say, a fat living was the best meat in the world. Nurse. Ay, and I'll make him commend the sauce too, or I'll bring his gown to a cassock, I will so. Fash. Well, nurse, whilst you go and 6ettle matters with him, then your lady and I will go and take a walk in the garden. Nurse. I'll do your honour's business in the catching up of a garter. [Exit Fash. [Giving her his hand.] Come, madam, dare you venture yourself along with me ? Hoyd. O dear, yes, sir, I don't think you'll do anything to me I need be afraid on. [Exeunt. Fash. O no, they study how to spend money, not to save it. SCENE II. \u2014 Loveless's Lodgings. Enter Amanda and Berinthia. Hoyd. Ecod, I don't know out that may be better sport than t'other ; ha, nurse ? Fash. Well, you shall have your choice when you come there. Hoyd.

SCENE 11. 321 I'll leave that to your looking-glass. But to show you I have some good-nature left, I'll commend him, and may be that may do as well. Aman. You have a great mind to persuade me I am in love with him. Till iirped too far. Revenge ! he cries. A fatal shaft he drew, It took its passage through your eyes. And to my heart it flew. To tear it thence I tried in vain, To strive I quickly found Was only to increase the pain, And to enlarge the wound. Ber. I have a great mind to persuade you, you don't know what you are in love with. Aman. I am sure I am not in love with him, nor never shall be, so let that pass. But you were saying something you would commend him for. Ber. Oh ! you'd be glad to hear a good character of him, however. Ah ! much too well, I fear, you know What pain I'm to endure, Since what your eyes alone could do, Your heart alone can cure. And that (grant Heaven I may mistake !, I doubt is doom'd to bear A burden for another's sake. Who ill rewards its care. Aman. Psha ! Ber. Psha ! \u2014 Well 'tis a foolish undertaking for women in these kind of matters to pretend to deceive one another. \u2014 Have not I been bred a woman as well as you ? Aman. Well, now, Berinthia, I'm at leisure to hear what 'twas you had to say to me. Ber. What I had to say was only to echo the sighs and groans of a dying lover. Aman. Phu ! will you never learn to talk in earnest of anything ? Ber. Why this shall be in earnest, if you please : for my part, I only tell you matter of fact, you may take it which way you like best ; but if you'll follow the women of the town, you'll take it both ways ; for when a man offers himself to one of them, first she takes him in jest, and then she takes him in earnest. Aman. What then ! Ber. Why then I understand my trade so well, that whenever I am told of a man I like, I cry, psha ! But that I may spare you the pains of putting me a second time in mind to commend him, I'll proceed, and give you this account of him : That though 'tis possible he may have had women with as good faces as your ladyship's, (no discredit to it neither,) yet you must know your cautious behaviour, with that reserve in your humour, has given him his death's wound ; he mortally hates a coquette. He says 'tis impossible to love where we cannot esteem ; and that no woman can be esteemed by a man who has sense, if she makes herself cheap in the eye of a fool ; that pride to a woman is as necessary as humility to a divine ; and that far-fetched, and dear-bought, is meat for gentlemen as well as for ladies ; \u2014 in short, that every woman who has beauty may set a price upon herself, and that by under-selling the market, they ruin the trade. This is his doctrine, how do you like it ? Aman I'm sure there's so much jest and earnest in what you say to me, I scarce know how to take it ; but 1 think you have bewitched me, for I don't find it possible to be angry with you, say what you will. Ber. I'm very glad to hear it, for I have no mind to quarrel with you, for some reasons that I'll brag of ; but quarrel or not, smile or frown, I must tell you what I have suffered upon your account. Aman. Upon my account ! Ber. Yes, upon yours ; I have been forced to sit still and hear you commended for two hours together, without one compliment to myself; now don't you think a woman had a blessed time of that? Aman. So well, that since I never intend to have a gallant for myself, if I were to recommend one to a friend he should be the man. Enter Worthy. Aman. Alas! I should have been unconcerned at it; I never knew where the pleasure lay of being praised by the men. But pray who was this that commended me so ? Bless me ! he's here, pray Heaven he did not hear me. Ber. If he did, it won't hurt your reputation ; your thoughts are as safe in his heart as in your own. Ber. One you have a mortal aversion to, Mr. Worthy ; he used you like a text, he took you all to pieces, but spoke so learnedly upon every point, one might see the spirit of the church was in him. If you are a woman, you'd have been in an ecstacy to have heard how feelingly he handled your hair, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, your teeth, your tongue, your chin, your neck, and so forth. Thus he preached for an hour, but when he came to use an application, he observed that all these without a gallant were nothing. \u2014 Now con sider of what has been said, and Heaven give you grace to put it in practice. Aman. Alas ! Berinthia, did I incline to a gal lant (which you know I do not,) do you think a man so nice as he could have the least concern for such a plain unpolished thing as I am ? it is impossible ! Ber. Now have you a great mind to put me upon commending you. Aman. Indeed that was not my design. Ber. Nay, if it were, it's all one, for I won't do't, Wor. I venture in at an unseasonable time of night, ladies ; I hope, if I am troublesome, you'll use the same freedom in turning me out again. Aman. I believe it can't be late, for Mr. Loveless is not come home yet, and he usually keeps good hours. Wor. Madam, I'm afraid he'll transgress a little to-night ; for he told me about half an hour ago he was going to sup with some company he doubted would keep him out till three or four o'clock in the morning, and desired I would let my servant acquaint you with it, that you might not expect him : but my fellow's a blunder-head ; so lest he should make some mistake, I thought it my duty to deliver the message myself. Aman. I'm very sorry he should give you that trouble, sir : but \u2014 Ber. But since he has, will you give me leave, madam, to keep him to play at ombre with us ? Aman. Cousin, you know you command my house. V"], [416, "322 THE RELAPSE; OR, VIRTUE IN DANGER. ACT IV. Wor. [To Berinthia.] And, madam, you know you command me, though I am a very wretched gamester. Ber. Oh ! you play well enough to lose your money, and that's all the ladies require ; so with out any more ceremony, let us go into the next room and call for the cards. Love. I am very well pleased with iny trick thus far, and shall be so till I have played it out, if it ben't your fault. Where's my wife ? Ber. At cards. Love. With whom ? Ber. With Worthy. Love. Then we are safe enough. Ber. You are so ! Some husbands would be of another mind, if he were at cards with their wives. Aman. With all my heart. [Exit Worthy, leading Amanda. Ber. Well, how this business will end Heaven knows ; but she seems to me to be in as fair a way \u2014 as a boy is to be a rogue, when he's put clerk to an attorney. [Exit. Love. And they'd be in the right on't, too : but I dare trust mine. \u2014 Besides, I know he's in love in another place, and he's not one of those who court half-a-dozen at a time. Ber. Nay, the truth on't is, you'd pity him if you saw how uneasy he is at being engaged with us ; but 'twas my malice, I fancied he was to meet his mistress somewhere else, so did it to have the pleasure of seeing him fret. Love. What says Amanda to my staying abroad so late ? SCENE III. \u2014 Berinthia's Apartment. Enter Loveless cautiously in the dark. Love. So, thus far all's well. I'm got into her bedchamber, and I think nobody has perceived me steal into the house; my wife don't expect me home till four o'clock ; so, if Berinthia comes to bed by eleven, I shall have a chase of five hours. Let me see, where shall I hide myself ? Under her bed ? No ; we shall have her maid searching there for something or other ; her closet's a better place, and I have a master-key will open it. I'll e'en in there, and attack her just when she comes to her prayers, that's the most like to prove her critical minute, for then the devil will be there to assist me. [Retires into the closet, shutting the door after him. Ber. Why, she's as much out of humour as he ; I believe they wish one another at the devil. Love. Then I'm afraid they'll quarrel at play, and soon throw up the cards. \u2014 [Offering to pull her into the closet.] Therefore, my dear, charming angel, let us make good use of our time. Ber. Heavens ! what do you mean ? Love. Pray what do you think I mean ? Ber. I don't know. Love. I'll show you. Ber. You may as well tell me. Love. No, that would make you blush worse than t'other. Enter Berinthia, with a candle in her hand. Ber. Well, sure I am the best-natured woman in the world, I that love cards so well (there is but one thing upon the earth I love better), have pre tended letters to write, to give my friends a tSte-a tete: however, I'm innocent, for picquet is the game I set 'em to : at her own peril be it, if she ventures to play with him at any other. But now what shall I do with myself? I don't know how in the world to pass my time ; would Loveless were here to badiner a little I Well, he's a charming fellow ; I don't wonder his wife's so fond of him. What if I should sit down and think of him till I fall asleep, and dream of the Lord knows what ? Oh, but then if I should dream we were married, I should be frighted out of my wits! \u2014 [Seeing a book.] What's this book ? I think I had best go read. O splenetic ! it's a sermon. Well, I'll go into my closet and read the Plotting Sisters. \u2014 [She opens the closet, sees Loveless, and shrieks out.] O Lord, a ghost ! a ghost ! a ghost ! a ghost ! Ber. Why, do you intend to make me blush ? Love. Faith I can't tell that ; but if I do, it shall be in the dark. [Pulling her. Ber. O Heavens ! I would not be in the dark with you for all the world ! Love. I'll try that. [Putt out the candle. Ber. O Lord ! are you mad ? What shall I do for light ? Love. You'll do as well without it. Ber. Why, one can't find a chair to sit down. Love. Come into the closet, madam, there's moonshine upon the couch. Ber. Nay, never pull, for I will not go. Love. Then you must be carried. [Takes her in his arms. Ber. [Very softly.] Help! help!

No, no ; fire over their heads only to fright 'em ; I'll warrant the regiment scours when the colonel's a prisoner. Sir Tun. Then come along, my boys, and let your courage be great \u2014 for your danger is but small. Lori/. One word with you, for Heaven's sake ! Fash. What the devil's the matter ? Lory.

He was here just now. \u2014 [To Bull.] See for him, doctor, tell him Sir John is here to wait upon him. [Exit Bull. Sir John. I hope, sir Tunbelly, the young lady is not married yet.

A man sees perhaps a hundred women he likes well enough for an intrigue, and away ; but possibly, through the whole course of his life, does not find above one who is exactly what he could wish her : now her, 'tis a thousand to one, he never gets. Either she is not to be had at all (though that seldom happens, you'll say), or he wants those opportunities that are necessary to gain her ; either she likes some body else much better than him, or uses him like a dog, because he likes nobody so well as her. Still something or other Fate claps in the way between them and the women they are capable of being fond of : and this makes them wander about from mistress to mistress, like a pilgrim from town to town, who every night must have a fresh lodg ing, and's in haste to be gone in the morning. Aman. 'Tis possible there may be something in what you say ; but what do you infer from it as to the man we are talking of? Ber. Why, I infer, that you being the woman in the world the most to his humour, 'tis not likely he would quit you for one that is less. Aman. That is not to be depended upon, for you see Mr. Loveless does so. Ber. What does Mr. Loveless do ? Ber. Thou minister of darkness, get up again, for I hate to see the devil at his devotions. Wor. Well, my incomparable Berinthia, how shall I requite you ! Ber. Oh, ne'er trouble yourself about that : virtue is its own reward. There's a pleasure in doing good, which sufficiently pays itself. Adieu ! Wor. Farewell, thou best of women ! [Exeunt severally. Enter Amanda meeting Berinthia. Aman. Who was that went from you ? Ber. A friend of yours. 4man. What does he want ? Ber. Something you might spare him, and be ne'er the poorer. Aman. I can spare him nothing but my friend ship ; my lovealready's all disposed of: though, I confess, to one ungrateful to my bounty. Ber. Why, there's the mystery ! You have been so bountiful, you have cloyed him. Fond wives do by their husbands, as barren wives do by their lapdogs ; cram 'em with sweetmeats till they spoil their stomachs. Aman. Alas I had you but seen how passionately fond he has been since our last reconciliation, you would have thought it were impossible he ever should have breathed an hour without me. Aman. Why, he runs after something for variety I'm sure he does not like so well as he does me. Ber. That's more than you know, madam. Aman. No, I'm sure on't. I am not very vain, Berinthia, and yet I'll lay my life, if I could look into his heart, he thinks I deserve to be preferred to a thousand of her. Ber. Ay, but there you thought wrong again, Amanda; you should consider, that in matters of love men's eyes are always bigger than their bellies. They have violent appetites, 'tis true, but they have soon dined. Aman. Well ; there's nothing upon earth astonishes me more than men's inconstancy. Ber. Now there's nothing upon earth astonishes me less, when I consider what they and we are composed of: for nature has made them children, and us babies. Now, Amanda, how we used our babies you may remember. We were mad to have them as soon as we saw them ; kissed them to pieces as soon as we got them ; then pulled off their clothes, saw them naked, and so threw them away. Ber. Don't be too positive in that neither ; a million to one but she has the same opinion of you. W7hat would you give to see her ? Aman. Hang her, dirty trull ! \u2014 Though I really believe she's so ugly she'd cure me of my jealousy. Ber. All the men of sense about town say she's handsome. Aman. They are as often out in those things as any people. Ber. Then I'll give you further proof \u2014 all the women about town say she's a fool. Now I hope you're convinced ? Aman. Whate'er she be, I'm satisfied he does not like her well enough to bestow anything more than a little outward gallantry upon her. Ber. Outward gallantry ! \u2014 [Aside.] I can't bear this. \u2014 [Aloud.] Don't you think she's a woman to be fobbed off so. Come, I'm too much your friend to suffer you should be thus grossly imposed upon by a man who does not deserve the least part about you, unless he knew how to set a greater value upon it. Therefore, in one word, to my certain knowledge, he is to meet her now, within a quarter of an hour, somewhere about that Babylon of wickedness, Whitehall. And if you'll give me your word, that you'll be content with Aman. But do you think all men are of this temper? Ber. All but one. Aman. Who's that ? Ber. Worthy. Aman. Why, he's weary of his wife too, you see. Ber. Ay, that's no proof. Aman. What can be a greater ? Ber. Being weary of his mistress. Aman. Don't you think 'twere possible he might give you that too ? Ber. Perhaps he might, if he were my gallant ; not if he were yours. Aman. Why do you think he should be more"], [423, "THE RELAPSE ; OR, VIRTUE IN DANGER.

I'll tell thee what it's to thee. \u2014 This living is worth five hundred pounds a-year, and the presentation of it is thine, if thou canst prove thyself a lawful husband to Miss Hoyden. Fash. Sayest thou so, my protector ? Then, egad, I shall have a brace of evidences here pre sently. Coup. The nurse and the doctor ? Fash. The same. The devil himself won't have interest enough to make 'em withstand it. Coup. That we shall see presently. \u2014 Here they come. Aman. If you can do this, Berinthia, he's a villain. Ber. I can't help that ; men will be so. Aman. Well, I'll follow your directions, for I shall never rest till I know the worst of this matter. Ber. Pray, go immediately and get yourself ready then. Put on some of your woman's clothes, a great scarf and a mask, and you shall presently receive orders. \u2014 [Calls.] Here, who's there ? get me a chair quickly. Enter Nurse and Bull ; they start back, seeing Tom Fashion. Nurse. Ah, goodness, Roger, we are betrayed ! Fash.

But pray, Berinthia, before you go, tell me how I may know this filthy thing, if she should be so forward (as I suppose she will) to come to the rendezvous first ; for methinks I would fain view her a little. Nurse. I hope, sir, my years will move your pity ; I am an aged woman. Coup. That is a moving argument indeed. \u2014 [To Bull.] Are not you a rogue of sanctity ? Bull. Sir (with respect to my function), I do wear a gown. I hope, sir, my character will be considered ; I am Heaven's ambassador. Coup. Did not you marry this vigorous young fellow to a plump young buxom wench ? Nurse. [Aside to Bull.] Don't confess, Roger, unless you are hard put to it indeed. Coup. Come, out with't !\u2014 Now is he chewing the cud of his roguery, and grinding a lie between his teeth. Ber. Why, she's about my height ; and very well shaped. Aman. I thought she had been a little crooked ? Ber. O no, she's as straight as I am. But we lose time ; come away. [Exeunt. SCENE III. \u2014 Tom Fashion's Lodgings. Enter Tom Fashion, meeting Lory. Fash. Well, will the doctor come ? Lory. Sir, I sent a porter to him as you ordered me. He found him with a pipe of tobacco and a great tankard of ale, which he said he would de spatch while I could tell three, and be here. Fash. He does not suspect 'twas I that sent for him ? Bull. Sir, I cannot positively say \u2014 I say, sir, positively I cannot say \u2014 Coup. Come, no equivocation, no Roman turns upon us. Consider thou standest upon protestant ground, which will slip from under thee like a Tyburn cart ; for in this country we have always ten hangmen for one Jesuit. Bull. [To Tom Fashion.] Pray, sir, then will you but permit me to speak one word in private with nurse ? Lory. Not a jot, sir ; he divines as little for himself as he does for other folks. Fash. Will he bring nurse with him ? Lory. Yes. Fash. That's well ; where's Coupler ? Lory. He's half way up the stairs taking breath ; he must play his bellows a little, before he can get to the top. Enter Coupler. Fash. Oh here he is.\u2014 Well, Old Phthisic, the doctor's coming. Fash. Thou art always for doing something in private with nurse. Coup. But pray let his betters be served before him for once : I would do something in private with her myself. \u2014 Lory, take care of this reverend gownman in the next room a little. \u2014 Retire, priest. \u2014 [Exit Lory with Bull.] Now, virgin, I must put the matter home to you a little : do you think it might not be possible to make you speak truth ? Nurse. Alas, sir ! I don't know what you mean by truth. Coup. Nay, 'tis possible thou mayest be a stranger to it. Fash. Come, nurse, you and I were bettei friends when we saw one another last ; and I still believe you are a very good woman in the bottom. I did deceive you and your young lady, 'tis true. Coup.

Thou art out in thy logic. Thy major is"], [424, "THE RELAl'Sfc; OR, VIRTUE IN DANGER. 330 ACT V. Fash. All this I intend for you, doctor. What you are to do for me I need not tell ye. Bull. Your worship's goodness is unspeakable. Yet there is one thing seems a point of conscience ; and conscience is a tender babe. If I should bind myself, for the sake of this living, to marry nurse, and maintain her afterwards, I doubt it might be looked on as a kind of simony. Coup. [Rising up.] If it were sacrilege, the living's worth it : therefore no more words, good doctor ; but with the parish \u2014 [Giving Nurse to him] here \u2014 take the parsonage-house. 'Tis true, 'tis a little out of repair ; some dilapidations there are to be made good ; the windows are broke, the wainscot is warped, the ceilings are peeled, and the walls are cracked ; but a little glazing, painting, whitewash, and plaster, will make it last thy time. Bull. Well, sir, if it must be so, I shan't con tend. What Providence orders, I submit to. but I always designed to make a very good husband to her, and to be a very good friend to you. And 'tis possible, in the end, she might have found her self happier, and you richer, than ever my brother will make you. Nurse. Brother ! why is your worship then his lordship's brother ? Fash. I am ; which you should have known, if I durst have stayed to have told you ; but I was forced to take horse a little in haste, you know. Nurse. You were indeed, sir : poor young man, how he was bound to scaure for't ! Now won't your worship be angry, if I confess the truth to you ? \u2014 When I found you were a cheat (with respect be 'it spoken), I verily believed miss had got some pitiful skip-jack varlet or other to her husband, or I had ne'er let her think of marrying again. Coup. But where was your conscience all this while, woman ? did not that stare you in the face with huge saucer-eyes, and a great horn upon the forehead ? Did not you think you should be damned for such a sin ? \u2014 Ha ! Nurse. And so do I, with all humility. Coup. Why, that now was spoke like good people. Come, my turtle-doves, let us go help this poor pigeon to his wandering mate again ; and after institution and induction, you shall all goa-cooing together. [Exeunt. Fash. Well said, divinity ! press that home upon her. Nurse. Why, in good truly, sir, I had some fearful thoughts on't, and could never be brought to consent, till Mr. Bull said it was a peckadilla, and he'd secure my soul for a tithe-pig. Fash. There was a rogue for you ! Coup. And he shall thrive accordingly ; he shall have a good living. \u2014 Come, honest nurse, I see you have butter in your compound ; you can melt. Some compassion you can have of this handsome young fellow. Nurse. I have, indeed, sir. Fash. Why, then I'll tell you what you shall do for me. You know what a warm living here is fallen ; and that it must be in the disposal of him who has the disposal of miss. Now if you and the doctor will agree to prove my marriage, I'll pre sent him to it, upon condition he makes you his bride. SCENE IV. \u2014 Loveless's Lodgings. Enter Amanda in a scarf, fye., as just returned, her Maid following her. Aman. Prithee what care I who has been here ? Maid. Madam, 'twas my lady Bridle and my Lady Tiptoe. Aman. My lady Fiddle and my lady Faddle ! What dost stand troubling me with the visits of a parcel of impertinent women ! When they are well seamed with the small-pox, they won't be so fond of showing their faces. \u2014 There are more coquettes about this town \u2014 Maid. Madam, I suppose they only came to return your ladyship's visit, according to the cus tom of the world. Nurse. Naw the blessing of the Lord follow your good worship both by night and by day ! \u2014 Let him be fetched in by the ears ; I'll soon bring his nose to the grindstone. Coup. [Aside.] Well said, old white-leather ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Hey, bring in the prisoner there ! Aman. Would the world were on fire, and you in the middle on't ! Begone ! leave me ! \u2014 [Exit Maid.] At last I am convinced. My eyes are testimonies of his falsehood. The base, ungrateful, perjured villain ! \u2014 Good gods ! what slippery stuff are men com- posed of ! Sure the account of their creation's false, And 'twas the woman's rib that they were form'd of. But why am I thus angry ? This poor relapse should only move my scorn. 'Tis true, The roving flights of his unfinish'd youth Had strong excuses from the plea of nature ; Reason had thrown the reins loose on his neck, And slipp'd him to unlimited desire. Re-enter Lory with Bull. Coup. Come, advance, holy man. Here's your duck does not think fit to retire with you into the chancel at this time ; but she has a proposal to make to you in the face of the congregation.\u2014 Come, nurse, speak for yourself, you are of age. Nurse. Roger, are not you a wicked man, Roger, to set your strength against a weak woman, and persuade her it was no sin to conceal miss's nup tials ? My conscience flies in my face for it, thou priest of Baal I and I find by woful experience thy absolution is not worth an old cassock ; therefore I am resolved to confess the truth to the whole world, though I die a beggar for it. But his worship over flows with his mercy and his bounty ; he is not only pleased to forgive us our sins, but designs thou sha't squat thee down in Fatgoose living ; and which is more than all, has prevailed with me to become the wife of thy bosom. If therefore he went wrong, he had a claim To my forgiveness, and I did him right. But since the years of manhood rein him in, And reason, well digested into thought, Has pointed out the course he ought to run ; If now he strays, 'Twould be as weak and mean in me to pardon, As it has been in him to offend.

Do you think one could not get him made a knight, nurse ? Nurse. I don't know but one might, madam, when the king's in a good humour. Hoyd. Ecod, that would do rarely. For then he'd be as good a man as my father, you know. Nurse. By'r Lady, and that's as good as the best of 'em. So soft, and so indulgent to desire, It leaves the reins in the wild hand of nature, Who like a Phaeton, drives the fiery chariot, And sets the world on flame. Yet still the sovereignty is in the mind, Whene'er it pleases to exert its force. Perhaps you may not think it worth your while, To take such mighty pains for my esteem ; But that I leave to you. You see the price I set upon my heart ; Perhaps 'tis dear : but, spite of all your art, You'll find on cheaper terms we ne'er shall part. [Exit Hoyd. So 'tis, faith ; for then I shall be my lady, and your ladyship at every word, that's all I have to care for. Ha, nurse, but hark you me, one thing more, and then 1 have done. I'm afraid, if I change my husband again, I shan't have so much money to throw about, nurse. Nurse. Oh, enough's as good as a feast. Be sides, madam, one don't know but as much may fall to your share with the younger brother as with the elder. For though these lords have a power of wealth indeed, yet, as I have heard say, they give it all to their sluts and their trulls ; who joggle it about in their coaches, with a murrain to 'em ! whilst poor madam sits sighing, and wishing, and knotting, and crying, and has not a spare half crown to buy her a Practice of Piety.

For this very morn ing he told me I should have two hundred a year to buy pins. Now, nurse, if he gives me two hundred a year to buy pins, what do you think he'll give me to buy fine petticoats ? Nurse. Ah, my dearest, he deceives thee faully, and he's no better than a rogue for his pains! These Londoners have got a gibberidge with 'em would confound a gipsy. That which they call pin-money is to buy their wives everything in the varsal world, down to their very shoe-ties. Nay, I have heard folks say, that some ladies, if they will have gallants, as they call 'em, are forced to find them out of their pin-money too. Hoyd. Has he served me so, say ye ! \u2014 Then I'll be his wife no longer, that's fixed. Look, here he comes, with all the fine folks at's heels. Ecod, nurse, these London ladies will laugh till they crack again, to see me slip my collar, and run away from my husband. But, d'ye hear? Pray, take care of one thing: when the business comes to break out, be sure you get between me and my father, for you know his tricks ; he'll knock me down. Wor. Sure there's divinity about her ! And sh'as dispensed some portion on't to me. For what but now was the wild flame of love, Or (to dissect that specious term) the vile, The gross desires of flesh and blood, Is in a moment turn'd to adoration. The coarser appetite of nature's gone, and 'tis, Methinks, the food of angels I require. How long this influence may last, Heaven knows ; But in this moment of my purity, I could on her own terms accept her heart. Yes, lovely woman ! I can accept it. For now 'tis doubly worth my care. Your charms are much increased, since thus adorn'd. When truth's extorted from us, then we own The robe of virtue is a graceful habit.

Alas ! if your worship had seen how the poor thing begged, and prayed, and clung, and twined about me, like ivy to an old wall, you would say, I who had suckled it, and swaddled it, and nursed it both wet and dry, must have had a heart of adamant to refuse it.

Since 'tis the intent and business of the stage, To copy out the follies of the age ; To hold to every man a faithful glass, And show him of what species he's an ass : I hope the next that teaches in the school, Will show our author he's a scribbling fool. And, that the satire may be sure to bite, Kind Heaven inspire some venom'd priest to write 1 And grant some ugly lady may indite 1 For I would have him lash'd, by heavens I would !

Experience shows, to many a writer's smart, You hold a court where mercy ne'er had part ; So much of the old serpent's sting you have, You love to damn, as Heaven delights to save.

All tickle on the adventuring young beginner, And only scourge the incorrigible sinner; They touch indeed his faults, but with a hand So gentle, that his merit still may stand : Kindly they buoy the follies of his pen, That he may shun 'em when he writes again.

SCENE I. \u2014 A Room in Sir John Brute's maid of being chaste, as I am of being married. Sure, there's a secret curse entailed upon the very name of wife. My lady is a young lady, a fine lady, a witty lady, a virtuous lady \u2014 and yet I hate her. There is but one thing I loathe on earth beyond her : that's fighting. Would my courage come up but to a fourth part of my ill-nature, I'd stand buff to her relations, and thrust her out of doors. But marriage has sunk me down to such an ebb of resolution, I dare not draw my sword, though even to get rid of my wife. But here she comes. House. Enter Sir John Brute. Sir John. What cloying meat is love \u2014 when matrimony's the sauce to it ! Two years' marriage has debauched my five senses. Everything I see, everything I hear, everything I feel, everything I smell, and everything 1 taste \u2014 methinks has wife in't. No boy was ever so weary of his tutor, no girl of her bib, no nun of doing penance, nor old"], [431, "THE PROVOKED WIFE. SCENE 1. 337 absolved from mine \u2014 Ay, that seems clear to me. The argument's good between the king and the people, why not between the husband and the wife ? Oh, but that condition was not expressed. \u2014 No matter, 'twas understood. Well, by all I see, if I argue the matter a little longer with myself, I shan't find so many bugbears in the way as I thought I should. Lord, what fine notions of virtue do we women take up upon the credit of old foolish philosophers ! Virtue's its own reward, virtue's this, virtue's that\u2014 virtue's an ass, and a gallant's worth forty on't. Enter Lady BkuTE. Lady Brute. Do you dine at home to-day, sir John ? Sir John. Why, do you expect I should tell you what I don't know myself? Lady Brute. I thought there was no harm in asking you. Sir John. If thinking wrong were an excuse for impertinence, women might be justified in most things they say or do. Lady Brute. I'm sorry I've said anything to displease you. Sir John. Sorrow for things past is of as little importance to me, as my dining at home or abroad ought to be to you. Lady Brute. My inquiry was only that I might have provided what you liked. Sir John. Six to four you had been in the wrong there again ; for what I liked yesterday I don't like to-day, and what I like to-day, 'tis odds I mayn't like to-morrow. Lady Brute. But if I had asked you what vou liked ? En*er Belinda. Lady Brute. Good morrow, dear cousin ! Bel. Good-morrow, madam ; you look pleased this morning. Lady Brute. I am so. Bel. With what, pray ? Lady Brute. With my husband. Bel. Drown husbands ! for yours is a provoking fellow. As he went out just now, I prayed him to tell me what time of day 'twas ; and he asked me if I took him for the church-clock, that was obliged to tell all the parish. Lady Brute. He has been saying some good obliging things to me too. In short, Belinda, he has used me so barbarously of late, that I could almost resolve to play the downright wife \u2014 and cuckold him. Sir John. Why, then, there would be more asking about it than the thing is worth. Lady Brute. I wish I did but know how I might please you. Sir John. Ay, but that sort of knowledge is not a wife's talent. Lady Brute. Whate'er my talent is, I'm sure my will has ever been to make you easy. Sir John. If women were to have their wills the world would be finely governed. Bel. That would be downright, indeed. Lady Brute. Why, after all, there's more to be said for't than you'd imagine, child. I know, accord ing to the strict statute law of religion, I should do wrong ; but, if there were a Court of Chancery in heaven, I'm sure I should cast him. Lady Brute. What reason have I given you to use me as you do of late ? It once was otherwise. You married me for love. Bel. If there were a House of Lords you might. Lady Brute. In either I should infallibly carry my cause. Why, he's the first aggressor, not I. Bel. Ay, but you know, we must return good for evil. Sir John. And you me for money. So, you have your reward, and I have mine. Lady Brute. What is it that disturbs you ? Sir John. A parson. Lady Brute. Why, what has he done to you ? Sir John. He has married me. [Exit. Lady Brute. That may be a mistake in the translation. \u2014 Prithee, be of my opinion, Belinda; for I'm positive I'm in the right; and if you'll keep up the prerogative of a woman, you'll like wise be positive you are in the right, whenever you do anything you have a mind to. But I shall play the fool and jest on, till I make you begin to think I'm in earnest. Lady Brute. The devil's in the fellow, I think ! \u2014 I was told before I married him that thus 'twould be: but I thought I had charms enough to govern him ; and that where there was an estate, a woman must needs be happy ; so, my vanity has deceived me, and my ambition has made me uneasy. But there's some com fort still ; if one would be revenged of him, these are good times; a woman may have a gallant, and a separate maintenance too. \u2014 The surly puppy ! \u2014 Yet, he's a fool for't ; for hitherto he has been no monster : but who knows how far he may provoke me ? I never loved him, yet I have been ever true to him ; and that in spite of all the attacks of art and nature upon a poor weak woman's heart, in favour of a tempting lover. Methinks so noble a defence as I have made should be rewarded with a better usage. \u2014 Or who can tell \u2014 perhaps a good part of what I suffer from my husband, may be a judgment upon me for my cru- elty to my lover \u2014 Lord, with what pleasure could I indulge that thought, were there but a possibility of finding arguments to make it good !-\u2014 And how do I know but there may ? \u2014 Let me see. \u2014 What opposes ? \u2014 My matrimonial vow. \u2014 Why, what did I vow ? I think I promised to be true to my hus band. Well ; and he promised to be kind to me. But he han't kept his word. \u2014 Why, then, I am Bel. I shan't take the liberty, madam, to think of anything that you desire to keep a secret from me. Lady Brute. Alas, my dear ! I have no secrets. My heart could never yet confine my tongue. Bel. Your eyes, you mean ; for I'm sure I have seen them gadding, when your tongue has been locked up safe enough. Lady Brute. My eyes gadding ! prithee after who, child ? Bel. Why, after one that thinks you hate him as much as I know you love him. Lady Brute. Constant, you mean ? Bel. I do so. Lady Brute. Lord, what should put such a thing into your head ? Bel. That which puts things into most people's heads \u2014 observation. Lady Brute. Why what have you observed, in the name of wonder ? Bel. I have observed you blush when you m^et z"], [432, "THE PROVOKED WIFE. 338 ACT I. him, force yourself away from him, and then be out of humour with everything about you. In a word, never was poor creature so spurred on by desire, and so reined in with fearl Lady Brute. How strong is fancy ! Bel. How weak is woman ! Lady Brute. Prithee, niece, have a better opinion of your aunt's inclination. Bel. Dear aunt, have a better opinion of your niece's understanding. I am fully convinced, no man has half that pleasure in possessing a mistress as a woman has in jilting a gallant. Lady Brute. The happiest woman then on earth must be our neighbour. Bel. O the impertinent composition ! She has vanity and affectation enough to make her a ridi culous original, in spite of all that art and nature ever furnished to any of her sex before her. Lady Brute. She concludes all men her cap tives ; and whatever course they take, it serves to confirm her in that opinion. Bel. If they shun her, she thinks 'tis modesty, and takes it for a proof of their passion. Lady Brute. And if they are rude to her, 'tis conduct, and done to prevent town-talk. Bel. When her folly makes 'em laugh, she thinks they are pleased with her wit. Lady Brute. And when her impertinence makes 'em dull, concludes they are jealous of her favours. Bel. All their actions and their words she takes for granted aim at her. Lazly Brute. You'll make me angry. Bel. You'll make me laugh. LaJy Brute. Then you are resolved to persist ? Bel. Positively. Lady Brute. And all I can say \u2014 Bel. Will signify nothing. Lady Brute. Though I should swear 'twere false \u2014 Bel. I should think it true. Lady Brule. Then let us both forgive \u2014 [Kiss ing her] for we have both offended : I in making a secret, you in discovering it. Bel. Good-nature may do much : but you have more reason to forgive one, than I have to pardon t'other. Lady Brute. And pities all other women because she thinks they envy her. Bel. Pray, out of pity to ourselves, let us find a better subject, for I'm weary of this. Do you think your husband inclined to jealousy ? Lady Brute. Oh, no ; he does not love me well enough for that. Lord, how wrong men's maxims are ! They are seldom jealous of their wives, un less they are very fond of 'em ; whereas they ought to consider the women's inclinations, for there depends their fate. Well, men may talk ; but they are not so wise as we, that's certain. Lady Brute. 'Tis true, Belinda, you have given me so many proofs of your friendship, that my reserve has been indeed a crime. But that you may more easily forgive me, remember, child, that when our nature prompts us to a thing our honour and religion have forbid us, we vfrould (were't pos sible) conceal, even from the soul itself, the know ledge of the body's weakness. Bel. Well, I hope, to make your friend amends, you'll hide nothing from her for the future, though the body should still grow weaker and weaker. Lady Brute. No, from this moment I have no more reserve ; and for a proof of my repentance, I own, Belinda, I'm in danger. Merit and wit assault me from without ; nature and love solicit me within ; my husband's barbarous usage piques me to revenge ; and Satan, catching at the fair occasion, throws in my way that vengeance which, of all vengeance, pleases women best. Bel. 'Tis well Constant don't know the weak ness of the fortification ; for, o' my conscience, he'd soon come on to the assault ! Bel. At least in our affairs. Lady Brule. Nay, I believe we should outdo 'em in the business of the state too ; for methinks they do and undo, and make but bad work on't. Bel. Why then don't we get into the intrigues of government as well as they ? Lady Brute. Because we have intrigues of our own that make us more sport, child. And so let's in, and consider of 'em. [Exeunt. \u2014 \u2666 \u2014 SCENE II. \u2014 Lady Fancyful's Dressing-Room. Enter Lady Fancyful, Mademoiselle, and Cornet. Lady Brute. Ay, and I'm afraid carry the town too. But whatever you may have observed, I have dissembled so well as to keep him ignorant. So you see I'm no coquette, Belinda: and if you'll follow my advice, you'll never be one neither. 'Tis true, coquetry is one of the main ingredients in the natural composition of a woman ; and I, as well as others, could be well enough pleased to see a crowd of young fellows ogling, and glancing, and watching all occasions to do forty foolish officious things. Nay, should some of 'em push on, even to hanging or drowning, why, faith, if I should let pure woman alone, I should e'en be but too well pleased with't. Bel. I'll swear 'twould tickle me strangely. Lady Brule. But after all, 'tis a vicious prac tice in us to give the least encouragement but where we design to come to a conclusion. For 'tis an unreasonable thing to engage a man in a disease which we beforehand resolve we never will apply a cure to. Lady Fan. How do I look this morning ? Cor. Your ladyship looks very ill, truly.

Tant mieux : e'est done quelque chose de nouveau. Re-enter Cornet. Cor. Madam, here's a letter for your ladyship by the penny-post. [Exit. Lady Fan. Some new conquest, I'll warrant you. For without vanity, I looked extremely clear last night, when I went to the Park. \u2014 O agreeable ! Here's a new song made of me : and ready set too. 0 thou welcome thing ! \u2014 [Kissing it.] Call Pipe hither, she shall sing it instantly. Lady Fan. Why, how do I know what designs he may have ? He may intend to ravish me for aught I know. Mad. Ravish ! \u2014 bagatelle. I would fain see one impudent rogue ravish Mademoiselle ; oui, je le voudrais. Lady Fan. Oh, but my reputation, Made moiselle, my reputation ; ah, ma chere reputation ! Atad. Matam, quand on l'a une fois perdue, on n'en est plus embarrassee. Lady Fan. Fi Mademoiselle, si ! Reputation is a jewel. Enter Pipe. Here, sing me this new song, Pipe. Pipe sings. Fly, fly, you happy shepherds, fly Avoid Philira's charms ; Mad. Qui coute bien-chere, matam. Lady Fan. Why sure you would not sacrifice your honour to your pleasure? Mad. Je suis philosophe. La-dy Fan. Bless me, how you talk ! Why, what if honour be a burden, Mademoiselle, must it not be borne ? The rigour of her heart denies The heaven that's in her arms. Ne'er hope to gaze, and then retire, Nor yielding, to he blest : Nature, who form'd her eyes of fire, Of ice composed her breast. Yet, lovely maid, this once believe A slave whose zeal you move ; The gods, alas, your youth deceive, Their heaven consists in love. Mad. Chacun a sa fa<;on. Quand quelquechoso m'incommode moi, je m'en defais, vite. Lady Fan. Get you gone, you little naughty Frenchwoman you ! I vow and swear I must turn you out of doors, if you talk thus. Mad.

Mon Dieu, quelles scrupules ! Lady Fan. Well for once, Mademoiselle, I'll follow your advice, out of the intemperate desire I have to know who this ill-bred fellow is. But I have too much delicatesse to make a practice on't. Mad. C'est une charmante sainte. Lady Fan. It ruined our first parents. Mad. Elle a bien diverti leurs enfans. Lady Fan. L'honneur est contre.

These are strange liberties you take, Mr. Heartfree! Enter Lady Fancyful and Mademoiselle, Lady Fan. Well, I vow, Mademoiselle, I'm strangely impatient to know who this confident fellow is. Heart. They are so, madam, but there's no help for it ; for know that I have a design upon you. Lady Fan. Upon me, sir ! Heart. Yes ; and one that will turn to your glory, and my comfort, if you will but be a little wiser than you use to be. Lady Fan. Very well, sir. Heart. Let me see \u2014 your vanity, madam, I take to be about some eight degrees higher than any woman's in the town, let t'other be who she will j and my indifference is naturally about the same pitch. Now could you find the way to turn this indifference into fire and flames, methinks your vanity ought to be satisfied ; and this, perhaps, you might bring about upon pretty reasonable terms. Lady Fan. And pray at what rate would this indifference be bought off, if one should have so depraved an appetite to desire it ? Heart. Why, madam, to drive a quaker's bar gain, and make but one word with you, if I do part with it\u2014 you must lay me down \u2014 your affectation. Lady Fan. My affectation, sir! Heart. Why, I ask you nothing but what you may very well spare. Lady Fan. You grow rude, sir ! \u2014 Come, Made moiselle, 'tis high time to be gone. Mad. Allons, allons, allons ! Heart. [Stopping them.] Nay, you may as well stand still ; for hear me you shall, walk which way you please. Lady Fan. What mean you, sir ? Heart. I mean to tell you, that you are the most ungrateful woman upon earth. Lady Fan. Ungrateful ! To who ? Heart. To nature. Enter Heartfree. Look, there's Heartfree. But sure it can't be him ; he's a professed woman-hater. Yet who knows what my wicked eyes may have done I Mad. II nous approche, madame. Lady Fan. Yes, 'tis he : now will he be most intolerably cavalier, though he should be in love with me. Heart. Madam, I'm your humble servant; I perceive you have more humility and good-nature than I thought you had. Lady Fan. What you attribute to humility and good-nature, sir, may perhaps be only due to curio sity. I had a mind to know who 'twas had ill manners enough to write that letter. [Throwing him his Letter. Heart. Well, and now I hope you are satisfied. Lady Fan. I am so, sir ; good b'w'y t'ye. Heart. Nay, hold there ; though you have done your business, I han't done mine : by your lady ship's leave, we must have one moment's prattle together. Have you a mind to be the prettiest woman about town, or not ? How she stares upon me ! What ! this passes for an impertinent ques tion with you now, because you think you are so already. Lady Fan. Pray, sir, let me ask you a question in my turn : by what right do you pretend to examine me ? Heart. By the same right that the strong govern the weak, because I have you in my power; for you cannot get so quickly to your coach but I shall"], [435, "THE PROVOKED WIFE. SCENE I. 341 Lady Fan. Why, what has nature done for me ? Heart. What you have undone by art. It made you handsome ; it gave you beauty to a miracle, a shape without a fault, wit enough to make 'em relish, and so turned you loose to your own discre tion ; which has made such work with you, that you are become the pity of our sex, and the jest of your own. There is not a feature in your face, but you have found the way to teach it some affected convulsion ; your feet, your hands, your very fin gers' ends, are directed never to move without some ridiculous air or other ; and your language is a suitable trumpet, to draw people's eyes upon the raree-show. Mad. [Aside.] Est-ce qu'on fait l'amour en Angleterre comme ca ? Lady Fan. [Aside.] Now could I cry for mad ness, but that I know he'd laugh at me for it. Heart. Now do you hate me for telling you the truth, but that's because you don't believe it is so; for were you once convinced of that, you'd reform for your own sake. But 'tis as hard to persuade a woman to quit anything that makes her ridicu lous, as 'tis to prevail with a poet to see a fault in his own play. Lady Fan. Every circumstance of nice breeding must needs appear ridiculous to one who has so natural an antipathy to good manners. Heart. But suppose I could find the means to convince you, that the whole world is of my opi nion, and that those who flatter and commend you, do it to no other intent, but to make you persevere in your folly, that they may continue in their mirth. myself ; and another was, that as little as I care for women, I could not see with patience one that Heaven had taken such wondrous pains about, be so very industrious to make herself the jack-pud ding of the creation. Const. Well, now could I almost wish to see my cruel mistress make the self-same use of what Heaven has done for her, that so I might be cured of a disease that makes me so very uneasy ; for love, love is the devil, Heartfree. Heart. And why do you let the devil govern you ? Const. Because I have more flesh and blood than grace and self-denial. My dear, dear mis tress ! \u2014 'Sdeath ! that so genteel a woman should be a saint when religion's out of fashion ! Heart. Nay, she's much in the wrong truly ; but who knows how far time and good example may prevail ? Const. Oh ! they have played their parts in vain already. 'Tis now two years since that damned fellow her husband invited me to his wedding: and there was the first time I saw that charming woman, whom I have loved ever since, more than e'er a martyr did his soul ; but she is cold, my friend, still cold as the northern star. Heart. So are all women by nature, which makes 'em so willing to be warmed. Const. Oh, don't profane the sex ! Prithee think 'em all angels for her sake, for she's vir tuous even to a fault. Heart. A lover's head is a good accountable thing truly ! He adores his mistress for being vir tuous, and yet is very angry with her because she won't be lewd. Lady Fan. Sir, though you and all that world you talk of, should be so impertinently officious as to think to persuade me I don't know how to behave myself, I should still have charity enough for my own understanding, to believe myself in the right, and all you in the wrong. Mad. Le voila mort ! Const. Well, the only relief I expect in my misery is to see thee some day or other as deeply engaged as myself, which will force me to be merry in the midst of all my misfortunes. Heart. That day will never come, be assured, Ned. Not but that I can pass a night with a woman, and for the time, perhaps, make myself as good sport as you can do. Nay, I can court a woman too, call her nymph, angel, goddess, what you please : but here's the difference 'twixt you and I ; I persuade a woman she's an angel, and she persuades you she's one. Prithee let me tell you how I avoid falling in love ; that which serves me for prevention, may chance to serve you for a cure. [Exeunt Lady Fancyful and Mademoiselle. Heart. [Gazing after her.] There, her single clapper has published the sense of the whole sex. Well, this once 1 have endeavoured to wash the blackamoor white ; but henceforward I'll sooner undertake to teach sincerity to a courtier, gene rosity to a usurer, honesty to a lawyer, nay, humi lity to a divine, than discretion to a woman I see has once set her heart upon playing the fool. Const. Well, use the ladies moderately then, and I'll hear you. Enter Constant. Morrow, Constant. Const. Good morrow, Jack: what are you doing here this morning ? Heart. Doing ! guess, if thou canst. \u2014 Why I have been endeavouring to persuade my lady Fan cyful that she's the foolishest woman about town. Const. A pretty endeavour truly ! Heart. I have told her in as plain English as I could speak, both what the town says of her, and what I think of her. In short, I have used her as an absolute king would do Magna Charta. Const. And how does she take it ? Heart. As childeen do pills ; bite 'em, but can't swallow 'em. Heart. That using 'em moderately undoes us all ; but I'll use 'em justly, and that you ought to be satisfied with. I always consider a woman, not as the tailor, the shoemaker, the tire-woman, the sempstress, and (which is more than all that) the poet makes her ; but I consider her as pure nature has contrived her, and that more strictly than I should have done our old grandmother Eve, had I seen her naked in the garden ; for I consider her turned inside out. Her heart, well-examined, I find there pride, vanity, covetousness, indiscre tion, but above all things malice ; plots eternally a-forging to destroy one another's reputations, and as honestly to charge the levity of men's tongues with the scandal ; hourly debates how to make poor gentlemen in love with 'em, with no other intent but to use 'em like dogs when they have done ; a constant desire of doing more mischief, Const. But, prithee, what has put it into your head, of all mankind, to turn reformer ? Heart.

How does all your family ? Sir John. Pox o' my family ! Const. How does your lady ? I han't seen her abroad a good while. Sir John. Do ! I don't know how she does, not I ; she was well enough yesterday : I han't been at home to-night. merely as an outside ; she has a thin tiffany covering, over just such stuff as you and I are made on. As for her motion, her mien, her airs, and all those tricks, I know they affect you mightily. If you should see your mistress at a coronation dragging her peacock's train, with all her state and insolence about her, 'twould strike you with all the awful thoughts that heaven itself could pretend to from you ; whereas I turn the whole matter into a jest, and suppose her strutting in the self-same stately manner, with nothing on but her stays, and her under scanty quilted petticoat. Const. Hold thy profane tongue ! for I'll hear no more. Heart. What ! you'll love on then ? Const. Yes, to eternity. Heart. Yet you have no hopes at all. Const. None. Heart. Nay, the resolution may be discreet enough ; perhaps you have found out some new philosophy, that love's like virtue, its own reward. So you and your mistress will be as well content at a distance, as others that have less learning are in coming together. Const. No ; but if she should prove kind at last, my dear Heartfree. [Embracing him. Heart. Nay, prithee, don't take me for your mistress, for lovers are very troublesome. Const. Well, who knows what time may do ! Heart. And just now he was sure time could do nothing. Const. Yet not one kind glance in two years, is somewhat strange. Heart. Not strange at all ; she don't like you, that's all the business. Const. Prithee, don't distract me. Heart. Nay, you are a good handsome young fellow, she might use you better. Come, will you go see her ? Perhaps she may have changed her mind ; there's some hopes as long as she's a woman. Const. Oh, 'tis in vain to visit her ! Sometimes to get a sight of her I visit that beast her husband ; but she certainly finds some pretence to quit the room as soon as I enter. Heart. It's much she don't tell him you have made love to her too, for that's another good natured thing usual amongst women, in which they have several ends. Sometimes 'tis to recommend their virtue, that they may be lewd with the greater security. Sometimes 'tis to make their husbands fight, in hopes they may be killed when their affairs require it should be so : but most com monly 'tis to engage two men in a quarrel, that they may have the credit of being fought for ; and if the lover's killed in the business, they cry, Poor fellow, he had ill luck I \u2014 and so they go to cards. Const. What, were you out of town ? Sir John. Out of town ! no, I was drinking. Const. You are a true Englishman ; don't know your own happiness. If I were married to such a woman, I would not be from her a night for all the wine in France. Sir John. Not from her ! Oons ; what a time should a man have of that ! Heart. Why, there's no division, I hope. Sir John. No ; but there's a conjunction, and that's worse ; a pox of the parson ! \u2014 Why the plague don't you two marry ? I fancy I look like the devil to you. Heart. Why, you don't think you have horns, do you ? Sir John. No, I believe my wife's religion will keep her honest. Heart. And what will make her keep her religion? Sir John. Persecution ; and therefore she shall have it. Heart. Have a care, knight ; women are tender things. Sir John. And yet, methinks, 'tis a hard matter to break their hearts. Const. Fy ! fy ! you have one of the best wives in the world, and yet you seem the most uneasy husband. Sir John. Best wives ! \u2014 the woman's well enough, she has no vice that I know of, but she's a wife, and \u2014 damn a wife ! If I were married to a hogshead of claret, matrimony would make me hate it. Heart. Why did you marry, then ? you were old enough to know your own mind. Sir John. Why did I marry ! I married be cause I had a mind to lie with her, and she would not let me. Heart. Why did not you ravish her ? Sir John. Yes ! and so have hedged myself into forty quarrels with her relations, besides buying my pardon. But more than all that, you must know, I was afraid of being damned in those days ; for I kept sneaking cowardly company, fellows that went to church, said grace to their meat, and had not the least tincture of quality about 'em. Heart. But I think you have got into a better gang now. Sir John. Zoons, sir, my lord Rake and I are hand and glove, I believe we may get our bones broke together to-night ; have you a mind to share a frolic ? Const. Not I, truly ; my talent lies to softer exercises. Const. Thy injuries to women are not to be for given. Look to't, if ever thou dost fall into their hands \u2014 Sir John. What, a down-bed and a strumpet ? A pox of venery ! I say. Will you come and drink with me this afternoon ? Const. 1 can't drink to-day, but we'll come and sit an hour with you if you will. Sir John.

So won't I. Lady Fan. O let him come in by all means [Exit Cornet.] \u2014 Now, Mademoiselle, am I going to be unspeakably happy. Sir John. Why ? Const. Because 'tis a secret. Sir John. Would my wife knew it, 'twould be no secret long. Const. Why, do you think she can't keep a secret ? Enter Treble and Pipe. So, Mr. Treble, you have set my little dialogue ? Treb. Yes, madam, and I hope your ladyship will be pleased with it. Lady Fan. Oh, no doubt on't ; for really, Mr. Treble, you set all things to a wonder. But your music is in particular heavenly when you have my words to clothe in't. Sir John. No more than she can keep Lent. Heart. Prithee, tell it her to try, Constant. Sir John. No, prithee, don't, that I mayn't be plagued with it. Const. I'll hold you a guinea you don't make her tell it you. Sir John. I'll hold you a guinea I do. Const. Which way ? Sir John. Why, I'll beg her not to tell it me. Heart. Nay, if anything does it, that will. Const. But do you think, sir \u2014 Sir John. Oons, sir, I think a woman and a secret are the two impertinentest themes in the universe ! Therefore, pray let's hear no more of my wife nor your mistress. Damn 'em both with all my heart, and everything else that daggles a petticoat, except four generous whores, with Betty Sands at the head of 'em, who are drunk with my lord Rake and I ten times in a fortnight. [Exit. Const. Here's a dainty fellow for you ! and the veriest coward too. But his usage of his wife makes me ready to stab the villain. Heart. Lovers are short-sighted : all their senses run into that of feeling. This proceeding of his is the only thing on earth can make your fortune. If anything can prevail with her to accept of a gallant, 'tis his ill usage of her ; for women will do more for revenge than they'll do for the gospel. Prithee take heart, I have great hopes for you ; and since I can't bring you quite off of her, I'll endeavour to bring you quite on ; for a whining lover is the damn'dest companion upon earth. Const. My dear friend, flatter me a little more with these hopes ; for whilst they prevail, I have heaven within me, and could melt with joy. Heart. Pray, no melting yet : let things go far ther first. This afternoon perhaps we shall make some advance. In the meanwhile, let's go dine at Locket's, and let hope get you a stomach. [Exeunt. Treb. Your words themselves, madam, have so much music in 'em, they inspire me. Lady Fan. Nay, now you make me blush, Mr. Treble ; but pray let's hear what you have done. Treb. You shall, madam. Treble and Pipe sing. Treb. Ah ! lovely nymph, the world's on fire Veil, veil those cruel eyes ! Pipe. The world may then in flames expire, And boast that so it dies. Treb. But when all mortals are destroy'd, Who then shall sing your praise ? Pipe. Those who are fit to be employ'd : The gods Bhall altars raise. Treb. How does your ladyship like it, madam ? Lady Fan. Rapture, rapture, Mr. Treble, I'm all rapture ! O wit and art, what power you have, when joined ! I must needs tell you the birth of this little dialogue, Mr. Treble. Its father was a dream, and its mother was the moon. I dreamt that by an unanimous vote I was chosen qiieen of that pale world : and that the first time I appeared upon my throne \u2014 all my subjects fell in love with me. Just then I waked, and seeing pen, ink, and paper lie idle upon the table, I slid into my morn ing-gown, and writ this impromptu. Treb. So I guess the dialogue, madam, is sup posed to be between your majesty, and your first minister of state. Lady Fan. Just. He as minister advises me to trouble my head about the welfare of my subjects ; which I as sovereign find a very impertinent pro posal. But is the town so dull, Mr. Treble, it affords us never another new song ? Treb. Madam, I have one in my pocket, came out but yesterday, if your ladyship pleases to let Mrs. Pipe sing it. Lady Fan. By all means Here, Pipe, make what music you can of this song here. \u2666 SCENE II \u2014 A Room in Lady Fancyful's House. Enter Lady Fancyful and Mademoiselle. Pipe sings. Lady Fan.

Good-breeding I he wants to be caned, Mademoiselle : an insolent fellow ! And yet let me expose my weakness, 'tis the only man on earth I could resolve to dispense my favours on, were he but a fine gentleman. Well, did men but know how deep an impression a fine gentleman makes in a lady's heart, they would reduce all their studies to that of good-breeding alone. Not an angel dwells above Half so fair as her I love, Heaven knows how she'll receive me : If she smiles, I'm blest indeed ; If she frowns, I'm quickly freed ; Heaven knows she ne'er can grieve mo, None can love her more than I, Yet she ne'er shall make me die.

O Lord, Mr. Treble, my cold is still so barbarous to refuse me that pleasure. He, \u2014 he, \u2014 hem. [Coughs. Sure this Heartfree has bewitched me, Mademoi selle. You can't imagine how oddly he mixed himself in my thoughts during my rapture e'en now. I vow 'tis a thousand pities he is not more polished : don't you think so ? Alad. Matam, I tink it so great pity, dat if I was in your ladyship place, I take him home in my house, I lock him up in my closet, and I never let him go till I teach him everyting dat fine laty expect from fine gentleman. Laly Fan. Why truly I believe I should soon subdue his brutality ; for without doubt he has a strange penchant to grow fond of me, in spite of his aversion to the sex, else he would ne'er have taken so much pains about me. Lord, how proud would some poor creatures be of such a conquest ! But I, alas, I don't know how to receive as a favour, what I take to be so infinitely my due. But what shall I do to new-mould him, Mademoiselle ? for till then he's my utter aversion. Treb. I'm very sorry for it, madam. Methinks all mankind should turn physicians for the cure on't. Lady Fan. Why truly, to give mankind their due, there's few that know me, but have offered their remedy. Treb. They have reason, madam : for I know nobody sings so near a cherubim as your ladyship. Lady Fan. What I do, I owe chiefly to your skill and care, Mr. Treble. People do flatter me, in deed, that I have a voice, and aje-ne-sais-quoi in the conduct of it, that will make music of anything. And truly I begin to believe so, since what happened t'other night. Would you think it, Mr. Treble ? walking pretty late in the Park (for I often walk late in the Park, Mr. Treble) a whim took me to sing Chevy-Chase, and would you believe it ? next morning I had three copies of verses and six bil lets-doux at my levee upon it. Treb. And without all dispute you deserved as many more, madam. Are there any further eom mands for your ladyship's humble servant ? Lady Fan. Nothing more at this time, Mr. Treble. But I shall expect you here every morn ing for this month, to sing my little matter there to me. I'll reward you for your pains. Treb. O Lord, madam ! \u2014 Lady Fan. Good morrow, sweet Mr. Treble. Treb. Your ladyship's most obedient servant. [Exit with Pipe. Alad. Matam, you must laugh at him in all de place dat you meet him, and turn into de ridicule all he say and all he do. Lady Fan. Why truly, satire has ever been of wondrous use to reform ill-manners. Besides, 'tis my particular talent to ridicule folks. I can be severe, strangely severe, when I will, Mademoiselle. \u2014 Give me the pen and ink \u2014 I find myself whimsi cal \u2014 I'll write to him. \u2014 Or I'll let it alone, and be severe upon him that way. \u2014 [Sits down to write, rises up again.] Yet active severity is better than passive [Sils down.] 'Tis as good let it alone too ; for every lash I give him perhaps he'll take for a favour.\u2014 [Rises.] Yet 'tis a thousand pities so much satire should be lost. \u2014 [S'i/s.] But if it should have a wrong effect upon him, 'twould dis tract me. \u2014 [Rises.] Well, I must write though, after all. \u2014 [Sits.] Or I'll let it alone, which is the same thing \u2014 [Rises.

Come, you shall take one glass, though I send for a box of lozenges to sweeten your mouth after it. Lady Brute. Don't answer him. \u2014 Well, what do you advise me ? Bel. Why really I would not alter it at all. Methinks 'tis very pretty as it is. Lady Brute. Ay, that's true : but you know one grows weary of the prettiest things in the world, when one has had 'em long. Sir John. Yes, I have taught her that. Bel. Shall we provoke him a little ? Lady Brule. With all my heart. \u2014 Belinda, don't you long to be married ? Bel. Why, there are some things in it I could like well enough. Lady Brute. What do you think you should dislike ? Const. Nay, if one glass will satisfy you, I'll drink it, without putting you to that expense. Sir John. Why that's honest. \u2014 [ To Servant, who sills the glasses and exit.] Fill some wine, sirrah! \u2014 So, here's to you, gentlemen ! \u2014 A wife's the devil. To your being both married ?

No, pray excuse us now. We'll come another time, and then we won't spare it. Sir John. This one glass, and no more. Come, it shall be your mistress's health : and that's a great compliment from me, I assure you. Const. And 'tis a very obliging one to me : so give us the glasses. Sir John. So : let her live ! Bel. My husband, a hundred to one else. Lady Brute. O ye wicked wretch ! sure you don't speak as you think. Bel. Yes, I do : especially if he smoked tobacco. [Sir John looks earnestly at them. Lady Brute. Why, that many times takes off worse smells. [They drink : Sir John coughs in the glass. Heart. Aud be kind. Const. What's the matter ? does it go the wrong way? Sir John. If I had love enough to be jealous, I should take this for an ill omen : for I never drank my wife's health in my life, but 1 puked in the glass. Const. Oh she's too virtuous to make a reason able man jealous. Bel. Then he must smell very ill indeed. Lady Brute. So some men will, to keep their wives from coming near 'em. Bel. Then those wives should cuckold 'em at a distance. [Sir John rises in a fury, throws his pipe at them, and drives them out. As they go off Lady Brute runs against Constant. Sir John. Pox of her virtue ! If I could but catch her adulterating, I might be divorced from her by law. Heart. And so pay her a yearly pension, to be a distinguished cuckold. Enter Constant and Heartfree, a Servant following. Sir John. Oons, get you gone up stairs, you confederating strumpets you, or I'll cuckold you with a vengeance ! Lady Brute.

I'll cuckold you, with a pox ! Const. Heavens, sir John ! what's the matter ? Sir John. Sure, if woman had been ready created, the devil, instead of being kicked down into hell, had been married. Heart. Well, we won't hinder business. Sir John. Methinks I don't know how to leave you though ; but for once I must make bold. Or look you, maybe the conference mayn't last long: so if you'll wait here half an hour, or an hour ; if I don't come then \u2014 why then \u2014 I won't come at all. Heart. [Aside to Constant.] A good modest proposition truly ! Const. But let's accept on't however. Who knows what may happen ! Heart. Well, sir, to show you how fond we are of your company, we'll expect your return as long as we can. Heart. Why, what new plague have you found now? Sir John. Why these two gentlewomen did but hear me say, I expected you here this afternoon ; upon which they presently resolved to take up the room, o' purpose to plague me and my friends. Const. Was that all? Why we should have been glad of their company. Sir John. Then I should have been weary of yours : for I can't relish both together. They found fault with my smoking tobacco too ; and said, men stunk. But I have a good mind \u2014 to say something. Const. No, nothing against the ladies, pray. Sir John.

My dear lady Brute ! and sweet Belinda ! methinks 'tis an age since I saw you. Lady Brute. Yet 'tis but three days ; sure you have passed your time very ill, it seems so long to you. Const. I think I shall swoon. Heart. I'll speak first then, whilst you fetch breath. Lady Brute. We think ourselves obliged, gentle men, to come and return you thanks for your knight-errantry. We were just upon being devour ed by the fiery dragon. Bel. Did not his fumes almost knock you down, gentlemen ? Heart. Truly, ladies, we did undergo some hard ships ; and should have done more, if some greater heroes than ourselves hard by had not diverted him. Lady Fan. Why really, to confess the truth to you, I am so everlastingly fatigued with the ad dresses of unfortunate gentlemen, that were it not for the extravagancy of the example, I should e'en tear out these wicked eyes with my own fingers, to make both myself and mankind easy. \u2014 What think you on't, Mr. Heartfree, for I take you to be my faithful adviser ? Heart. Why truly, madam, I think every pro ject that is for the good of mankind ought to be encouraged. Lady Fan. Then I have your consent, sir \u2014 Heart. To do whatever you please, madam. Lady Fan. You had a much more limited com plaisance this morning, sir. \u2014 Would you believe it, ladies ? the gentleman has been so exceeding gene rous, to tell me of above fifty faults in less time than it was well possible for me to commit two of 'em. Const. Though I'm glad of the service you are pleased to say we have done you, yet I'm sorry we could do it no other way than by making our selves privy to what you would perhaps have kept a secret. Lady Brute. For sir John's part, I suppose he designed it no secret, since he made so much noise : and, for myself, truly I am not much concerned, since 'tis fallen only into this gentleman's hands and yours, who, I have many reasons to believe, will neither interpret nor report anything to my disadvantage. Const. Why truly, madam, my friend there is apt to be something familiar with the ladies. Lady Fan. He is, indeed, sir ; but he's won drous charitable with it. He has had the goodness to design a reformation, even down to my fingers' ends. \u2014 'Twas thus, I think, sir, you'd have had 'em stand ? \u2014 [Opening her fingers in an awkwardman ner.] My eyes too he did not like. \u2014 How was't you would have directed 'em ? \u2014 Thus, I think. \u2014 [Staring at him.] Then there was something amiss in my gait too 1 I don't know well how 'twas, but, as I take it, he would have had me walk like him. \u2014 Pray, sir, do me the favour to take a turn or two about the room, that the company may see you. \u2014 He's sullen, ladies, and won't. But, to make short, and give you as true an idea as I can of the matter, I think 'twas much about this figure in general he would have moulded me to : but I was an obstinate woman, and could not resolve to make myself mis tress of his heart by growing as awkward as his fancy. [She walks awkwardly about, staring ana looking ungainly; then changes on a sudden to the Const. Your good opinion, madam, was what I feared I never could have merited. Lady Brute. Your fears were vain then, sir; for I am just to everybody. Heart. Prithee, Constant, what is't you do to get the ladies' good opinions, for I'm a novice at it ? Bel. Sir, will you give me leave to instruct you ? Heart. Yes, that I will, with all my soul, madam. Bel. Why then you must never be slovenly, never be out of humour ; fare well, and cry roast meat ; smoke tobacco, nor drink but when you are a-dry. Heart. That's hard. Const. Nay, if you take his bottle from him, you creak his heart, madam. Bel. Why, is it possible the gentleman can love drinking ? Heart. Only by way of antidote. Bel. Against what, pray ? Heart. Against love, madam. Lady Brute. Are you afraid of being m love, sir ? Heart. I should, if there were any danger of it. Lady Brute. Pray, why so ? Heart.

[Aside.] Very pretty truly ! \u2014 But how the blockhead went out ! languishing at her ; and not a look toward me ! \u2014 Well, churchmen may talk, but miracles are not ceased. For 'tis more than natural, such a rude fellow as he, and such a little impertinent as she, should be capable of mak ing a woman of my sphere uneasy. But I can bear her sight no longer. \u2014 Methinks she's grown ten times uglier than Cornet. I must go home, and study revenge. \u2014 [To Lady Brute.] Madam, your hum ble servant; I must take my leave. Lady Brute. What, going already, madam ? Lady Fan. I must beg you'll excuse me this once ; for really I have eighteen visits to return this afternoon. So you see I am importuned by the women as well as the men. Bel. [Aside.] Now I'm sure she's fond of him ; I'll try to make her jealous. \u2014 [Aloud.] W7ell, for my part, I should be glad to find somebody would be so free with me, that I might know my faults, and mend 'em. Lady Fan. Then pray let me recommend this gentleman to you : I have known him some time, and will be surety for him, that upon a very limited encouragement on your side, you shall find an extended impudence on his. Heart. I thank you, madam, for your recom mendation : but hating idleness, I'm unwilling to enter into a place where I believe there would be nothing to do. I was fond of serving your lady ship, because I knew you'd find me constant em ployment. Lady Fan. I told you he'd be rude, Belinda ! Bel. Oh, a little bluntness is a sign of honesty, which makes me always ready to pardon it. \u2014 So, sir, if you have no other exceptions to my service, but the fear of being idle iu 't, you may venture to list yourself: I shall find you work, I warrant you. Bel. [Aside.] And she's quits with 'em both. Lady Fan. [Going.] Nay, you shan't go one step out of the room. Lady Brute. Indeed I'll wait upon you down. Lady Fan. No, sweet lady Brute, you know I swoon at ceremony. Lady Brute. Pray, give me leave. Lady Fan. You know I won't. Heart. Upon those terms I engage, madam ; and this (with your leave) I take for earnest. [Offering lo kiss her hand. Bel. Hold there, sir ! I'm none of your earnest givers : but if I'm well served, I give good wages, and pay punctually. [Heartfree and Belinda talk familiarly apart. Lady Brute. Indeed I must. Lady Fan. Indeed you shan't.

Heart. Up to a certain age, madam. Lady Fan. Which I'm not yet past, I hope. Heart. [Aside.] Nor never will, I dare swear. Lady Fan. [To Lady Brute.] Come, madam, will your ladyship be witness to our reconciliation ? Lady Brute. You agree then at last. Heart. [Slightingly.] We forgive. Lady Fan. [Aside.] That was a cold, ill-natured reply. Lady Brute. Then there's no challenges sent between you ? Heart. Not from me, I promise ! \u2014 [Aside to Constant.] But that's more than I'll do for her, for I know she can as well be damned as forbear writing to me. Re-enter Lady Brute. Lady Brute. This impertinent woman has put me out of humour for a fortnight. \u2014 What an agree able moment has her foolish visit interrupted ! \u2014 Lord, how like a torrent love flows into the heart, when once the sluice of desire is opened ! Good gods ! what a pleasure there is in doing what we should not do ! Re-enter Constant. Ha ! here again ? Const. Though the renewing my visit may seem a little irregular, I hope I shall obtain your pardon for it, madam, when you know I only left the room, lest the lady who was here should have been as malicious in her remarks, as she's foolish in her conduct. Lady Brute. He who has discretion enough to be tender of a woman's reputation, carries a virtue about him may atone for a great many faults. Const. If it has a title to atone for any, its pre tensions must needs be strongest, where the crime is lore. I therefore hope I shall be forgiven the attempt I have made upon your heart, since my enterprise has been a secret to all the world but yourself. Lady Brute. Secrecy indeed in sins of this kind Const. That I believe. But I think we had best"], [442, "348 THE PROVOKED WIFE. ACT 111. Is an argument of weight to lessen the punishment; but nothing's a plea for a pardon entire, without a sincere repentance. Const. That, madam, is only when they are forced to borrow of usurers, and not of a generous friend. Let us choose our creditors, and we are seldom so ungrateful to shun 'em. Lady Brute. What think you of sir John, sir ' I was his free choice. Const. If sincerity in repentance consists in sor row for offending, no cloister ever inclosed so true a penitent as I should be. But I hope it cannot be reckoned an offence to love, where 'tis a duty to adore. Const. I think he's married, madam. Lady Brute. Does marriage then exclude men from your rule of constancy ? Const. It does. Constancy's a brave, free, haughty, generous agent, that cannot buckle to the chains of wedlock. There's a poor sordid slavery in marriage, that turns the flowing tide of honour, and sinks us to the lowest ebb of infamy. 'Tis a corrupted soil ; ill-nature, avarice, sloth, cowardice, and dirt, are all its product. Lady Brute. Have you no exceptions to this general rule, as well as to t'other ? Const. Yes ; I would (after all) be an exception to it myself, if you were free in power aud will to make me so. Lady Brute. 'Tis an offence, a great one, where it would rob a woman of all she ought to be adored for, her virtue. Const. Virtue ! \u2014 Virtue, alas, is no more like the thing that's called so, than 'tis like vice itself. Virtue consists in goodness, honour, gratitude, sincerity, and pity ; and not in peevish, snarling, strait-laced chastity. True virtue, wheresoe'er it moves, still carries an intrinsic worth about it, and is in every place, and in each sex, of equal value. So is not continence, you see : that phantom of honour, which men in every age have so contemned, they have thrown it amongst the women to scrab ble for. Lady Brute. Compliments are well placed, where 'tis impossible to lay hold on 'em. Const. I would to heaven 'twere possible so; you to lay hold on miDe, that you might see it is no compliment at all. But since you are already disposed of beyond redemption, to one who does not know the value of the jewel you have put into his hands, I hope you would not think him greatly wronged, though it should sometimes be looked on by a friend, who knows how to esteem it as he ought. Lady Brute. If looking on't alone would serve his turn, the wrong perhaps might not be very great. Const. Why, what if he should wear it now and then a day, so he gave good security to bring it home again at night ? Lady Brute. Small security I fancy might serve for that. One might venture to take his word. Const. Then where's the injury to the owner ? Lady Brute. 'Tis injury to him if he think it one. For if happiness be seated in the mind, unhappiness must be so too. Const. Here I close with you, madam, and draw my conclusive argument from your own position ; if the injury lie in the fancy, there needs nothing but secrecy to prevent the wrong. Lady Brute. [Going.] A surer way to prevent it, is to hear no more arguments in its behalf. Const. [Following her.] But, madam\u2014 Lady Brute. But, sir, 'tis my turn to be discreet now, and not suffer too long a visit. Const. [Catching her hand.] By heaven you shall not stir ! till you give me hopes that I shall see you again at some more convenient time and place. Lady Brute. I give you just hopes enough \u2014 [Breaking from him] to get loose from you : and that's all I can afford you at this time. [Exit, running. Lady Brute. If it be a thing of so very little value, why do you so earnestly recommend it to your wives and daughters ? Const. We recommend it to our wives, madam, because we would keep 'em to ourselves ; and to our daughters, because we would dispose of 'em to others. Lady Brute. 'Tis then of some importance, it seems, since you can't dispose of 'em without it. Const. That importance, madam, lies in the humour of the country, not in the nature of the thing. Lady Brute. How do you prove that, sir? Const. From the wisdom of a neighbouring nation in a contrary practice. In monarchies things go by whimsy, but commonwealths weigh all things in the scale of reason. Lady Brute. I hope we are not so very light a people, to bring up fashions without some ground. Const. Pray what does your ladyship think of a powdered coat for deep mourning ? La/y Brute. I think, sir, your sophistry has all the effect that you can reasonably expect it should have ; it puzzles, but don't convince. Const. I'm sorry for it. Lady Brute. I'm sorry to hear you say so. Const. Pray why ? Lady Brute. Because if you expected more from it, you have a worse opinion of my understanding than I desire you should have. Const. [Aside.] I comprehend her : she would have me set a value upon her chastity, that I may think myself the more obliged to her when she nakes me a present of it. \u2014 [Aloud.] I beg you will believe I did but rally, madam ; I know you judge too well of right and wrong to be deceived by arguments like those. 1 hope you'll have so favourable an opinion of my understanding too, to believe the thing called virtue has worth enough with me to pass for an eternal obligation where'er 'tis sacrificed. Const. Now by all that's great and good, she's a charming woman ! In what ecstacy of joy she has left me ! For she gave me hope ; did she not say she gave me hope ? \u2014 Hope ! ay ; what hope ! \u2014 enough to make me let her go ! \u2014 Why that's enough in conscience. Or, no matter how 'twas spoke ; hope was the word ; it came from her, and it was said to me. Lady Brute. It is, I think, so great a one, as nothing can repay. Const. Yes ; the making the man you love your everlasting debtor. Lady Brute.

We ought to do so indeed, but 'tis a hard matter. For when a man is really in love he looks so insufferably silly, that though a woman liked him well enough before, she has tlien much ado to endure the sight of him. And this I take to be the reason why lovers are so generally ill used. Lady Brute. Well, I own now, I'm well enough pleased to see a man look like an ass for me. Bel. Ay, I'm pleased he should look like an ass too \u2014 that is, I am pleased with myself for making him look so. Bel. Don't trouble yourself to explain ; for, if I'm not mistaken, you and I have had some of these necessary dialogues before now, with the same intention. Lady Brute. Why, I'll swear, Belinda, some people do give strange agreeable airs to their faces in speaking. Tell me true \u2014 did you never practise in the glass ? Bel. Why, did you ? Lady Brute. Yes, faith, many a time. Bel. And I too, I own it ; both how to speak myself, and how to look when others speak. But my glass and I could never yet agree what face I should make when they come blurt out with a nasty thing in a play. For all the men presently look upon the women, that's certain; so, laugh we must not, though our stays burst for't, because that's telling truth, and owning we understand the jest : and to look serious is so dull, when the whole house is a-laughing. Lady Brute. Besides, that looking serious does really betray our knowledge in the matter as much as laughing with the company would do : for, if we did not understand the thing, we should natu rally do like other people. Bel. For my part, I always take that occasion to blow my nose. Lady Brute. You must blow your nose half off then at some plays. Bel. Why don't some reformer or other beat the poet for't? Lady Brute. Because he is not so sure of our private approbation as of our public thanks. Well, sure, there is not upon earth so impertinent a thing as women's modesty. Bet. Yes; men's fantasque, that obliges us to it. If we quit our modesty, they say we lose our charms; and yet they know that very modesty is affectation, and rail at our hypocrisy. Lady Brute. Thus one would think 'twere a hard matter to please 'em, niece : yet our kind mother nature has given us something that makes amends for all. Let our weakness be what it will, mankind will still be weaker ; and whilst there is a world 'tis woman that will govern it. But, prithee, one word of poor Constant before we go to bed, if it be but to furnish matter for dreams. \u2014I dare swear he's talking of me now, or thinking of me at least, though it be in the middle of his prayers. Bel. So he ought, I think ; for you were pleased to make him a good round advance to-day, madam. Lady Brute. Nay, truly, I think if he'd find some other way to express his passion, 'twould be more to his advantage. Bel. Yes ; for then a woman might like his pas sion, and him too. Lady Brute. Yet, Belinda, after all, a woman's life would be but a dull business, if 'twere not for men ; and men that can look like asses too. We should never blame fate for the shortness of our days ; our time would hang wretchedly upon our hands. Bel. Why, truly, they do help us off with a good share on't. For were there no men in the world, o'my conscience, I should be no longer a-dressing than I'm a-saying my prayers; nay, though it were Sunday : for you know one may go to church without stays on. Lady Brute. But don't you think emulation might do something? For every woman you see desires to be finer than her neighbour. Bel. That's only that the men may like her better than her neighbour. No ; if there were no men, adieu fine petticoats, we should be weary ot wearing 'em. Lady Brute. And adieu plays, we should be weary of seeing 'em. Bel. Adieu Hyde- Park, the dust would choke us. Lady Brute. Adieu St. James's, walking would tire us. Bel. Adieu London, the smoke would stifle us. Lady Brute. And adieu going to church, for religion would ne'er prevail with us. Both. Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! Bel. Our confession is so very hearty, sure we merit absolution. Lady Brute. Not unless we go through with't, and confess all. Suo, prithee, for the ease of our consciences, let's hide nothing. Bel. Agreed. Lady Brute. Why, then, I confess that I love to sit in the fore-front of a box ; for, if one sits behind, there's two acts gone perhaps before one's found out. And when I am there, if I perceive the men whispering and looking upon me, you must know I cannot for my life forbear thinking they talk to my advantage. And that sets a thou sand little tickling vanities on foot \u2014 Bel. Just my case for all the world ; but go on. Lady Brute. I watch with impatience for the next jest in the play, that I may laugh and show my white teeth. If the poet has been dull, and the jest be long a-coming, I pretend to whisper one to my friend, and from thence fall into a little small discourse, in which I take occasion to show my face in all humours, brisk, pleased, serious, melancholy, languishing. \u2014 Not that what we say to one another causes any of these alterations ; but \u2014 Lady Brute. Why, J have e'en plagued him enough to satisfy any reasonable woman. He has besieged me these two years to no purpose. Bel. And if he besieged you two years more, he'd be well enough paid, so he had the plundering of you at last. Lady Brute. That may be : but I'm afraid the town won't be able to hold out much longer : for, to confess the truth to you, Belinda, the garrison begins to grow mutinous. Bel. Then the sooner you capitulate the better. Lady Brute. Yet, methinks, I would fain stay a little longer to see you fixed too, that we might start together, and see who could love longest. What think you, if Heartfree should have a month's mind to you ? Bel. Why, faith, I could almost be in love with him for despising that foolish, affected lady Fancy-"], [445, "THE PROVOKED WIFE. 351 SCENE I. ful; hut I'm afraid he's too cold ever to warm himself by my fire. Lady Brute. Then he deserves to be froze to death. Would I were a man for your sake, dear rogue. [Kissing her. Bel. You'd wish yourself a woman again for your own, or the men are mistaken. But if I could make a conquest of this son of Bacchus, and rival his bottle, what should I do with him ? He has no fortune, I can't marry him ; and sure you would not have me commit fornication. Lady Brute. We must e'en have recourse to the old way ; make 'em au appointment 'twixt jest and earnest, 'twill look like a frolic, and that you know 's a very good thing to save a woman's blushes. Bel. You advise well ; but where shall it be? Lady Brute. In Spring-Garden. But they shan't know their women till their women pull off their masks ; for a surprise is the most agreeable thing in the world : and I find myself in a very good humour, ready to do 'em any good turn I can think on. Lady Brute. Why, if you did, child, 'twould be but a good friendly part ; if 'twere only to keep me in countenance whilst I commit \u2014 you know what. Bel. Well, if I can't resolve to serve you that way, I may perhaps some other as much to your satisfaction. But pray, how shall we contrive to see these blades again quickly ? Bel. Then pray write 'em the necessary billet without further delay. Lady Brute. Let's go into your chamber, then, and whilst you say your prayers, I'll do it, child. [Exeunt. ACT IV.

These courtiers are fuller of tricks than they are of money ; they'll sooner cut a man's throat than pay his bill. [Exit. Sir John. So, how do you like my shapes now ? Rake. This will do to a miracle; he looks like a bishop going to the holy war. \u2014 But to your arms, gentlemen, the enemy appears. Bully. Ay, she'll alarm the watch presently. Rake. Appear, knight, then ; come, you have a good cause to fight for, there's a man murdered. Sir John. Is there ! then let his ghost be satis fied, for I'll sacrifice a constable to it presently, and burn his body upon his wooden chair. Enter a Tailor, with a bundle under his arm. Bully. How now ! what have we got here ? a thief! Tailor. No, an't please you, I'm no thief. Rake. That we'll see presently. \u2014 Here, let the general examine him. Sir John. Ay, ay, let me examine him, and I'll lay a hundred pound I find him guilty in spite of his teeth \u2014 for he looks \u2014 like a \u2014 sneaking rascal. \u2014 Come, sirrah, without equivocation or mental re servation, tell me of what opinion you are, and what calling ; for by them \u2014 I shall guess at your morals. Enter Constable and Watchmen. Watchman. Stand ! Who goes there ? Come before the constable. Sir John. The constable's a rascal \u2014 and you are the son of a whore 1 Watch. A good civil answer for a parson, truly ! Tail. An't please you, I'm a dissenting jour neyman tailor. Sir John. Then, sirrah, you love lying by your religion, and theft by your trade ; and so that your punishment may be suitable to your crimes \u2014 I'll have you first gagged \u2014 and then hanged. Tail. Pray, good worthy gentlemen, don't abuse me ; indeed I'm an honest man, and a good workman, though I say it that should not say it. Sir John. No words, sirrah, but attend your fate. Rake. Let me see what's in that bundle. Constable. Methinks, sir, a man of your coat might set a better example. Sir John. Sirrah, I'll make you know \u2014 there are men of my coat can set as bad examples \u2014 as you can do, you dog you ! [Sir John strikes the Constable. They knock him downy disarm him, and seize him.

What the plague ails me ? \u2014 Love ? No, I thank you for that, my heart's rock still. \u2014 Yet 'tis Belinda that disturbs me ; that's positive. \u2014 Well, what of all that ? Must I love her for being troublesome? at that rate I might love all the women I meet, egad. But hold ! \u2014 though I don't love her for disturbing me, yet she may disturb me because I love her. \u2014 Ay, that may be, faith. I have dreamed of her, that's certain. \u2014 Well, so I have ot my mother ; therefore, what's that to the purpose ? Ay, but Belinda runs in my mind waking. \u2014 And so does many a damned thing that I don't care a farthing for. \u2014 Methinks, though, I would fain be talking to her, and yet I have no business. \u2014 Well, am I the first man that has had a mind to do an impertinent thing ? Const. Yes, for I am in love, I own it. Heart. Then so am I. Now laugh till thy soul's glutted with mirth [Embracing him.] But, dear Constant, don't tell the town on't. Const. Nay then, 'twere almost pity to laugh at thee, after so honest a confession. But tell us a little, Jack, by what new-invented arms has this mighty stroke been given ? Heart. E'en by that unaccountable weapon, called Je-ne-sais-quoi : for everything that can come within the verge of beauty I have seen it with indifference. Const. So in few words then ; the Je-ne-sais-quoi has been too hard for the quilted petticoat. Heart. Egad, I think the Je-ne-sais-quoi is in the quilted petticoat ; at least 'tis certain I ne'er think on't without \u2014 a \u2014 a Je-ne-sais-quoi in every part about me. Const. Well, but have all your remedies lost their virtue ? have you turned her inside out yet ? Heart. I dare not so much as think on't. Enter Constant. Const. How now, Heartfree! what makes you up and dressed so soon ? I thought none but lovers quarreled with their beds ; I expected to have found you snoring, as I used to do. Heart. Why, faith, friend, 'tis the care I have of your affairs that makes me so thoughtful ; I have been studying all night how to bring your matter about with Belinda. Const. But don't the two years' fatigue I have had discourage you ? Heart. Yes : I dread what I foresee, yet cannot quit the enterprise. Like some soldiers, whose courage dwells more in their honour than their nature. On they go, though the body trembles at what the soul makes it undertake. Const. With Belinda! Heart. With my lady, I mean :\u2014 and faith I have mighty hopes on't. Sure you must be very well satisfied with her behaviour to you yesterday ? Const. So well, that nothing but a lover's fears can make me doubt of success. But what can this sudden change proceed from ? Heart. Why, you saw her husband beat her, did you not ? Const. Nay, if you expect your mistress will use you, as your profanations against her sex deserve, you tremble justly. But how do you intend to proceed, friend ? Heart. Thou knowest I'm but a novice; be friendly and advise me. Const. Why, look you, then ; I'd have you \u2014 serenade and a \u2014 write a song \u2014 go to church \u2014 look like a fool \u2014 be very officious \u2014 ogle \u2014 write \u2014 and lead out : and who knows, but in a year or two's time, you may be \u2014 called a troublesome puppy, and sent about your business ? Heart. That's hard. Const. That's true : a husband is scarce to be borne upon any terms, much less when he fights with his wife. Methinks she should e'en have cuckolded him upon the very spot, to show that after the battle she was master of the field. Heart. A council of war of women would infal libly have advised her to't. But, I confess, so agreeablea woman as Belinda deserves abetter usage. Const. Belinda again ! Heart. My lady, I mean.\u2014 What a pox makes me blunder so to-day >\u2014 [Aside.] A plague of this treacherous tongue ! Const. Prithee look upon me seriously. Heart free.-Now answer me directly. Is it my lady or Belinda employs your careful thoughts thus ? Const. Yet thus it oft falls out with lovers, sir. Heart. Pox on me for making one of the number. Const. Have a care : say no saucy things ; 'twill but augment your crime ; and if your mistress hears on't, increase your punishment. Heart.

There is not so strict an alliance between 'em neither. 'Tis certain I should love you- then better (if that be possible) than I do now ; and where I love I always esteem. Lady Brute. Indeed, I doubt you much. Why, suppose you had a wife, and she should entertain a gallant ? Const. If I gave her just cause, how could I justly condemn her ? Lady Brute. Ah, but you'd differ widely about just causes. Const. But blows can bear no dispute. Lady Brute. Nor ill manners much, truly. Const. Then no woman upon earth has so just a cause as you have. Lady Brute. Oh, but a faithful wife is a beauti ful character. Sir John. Then you are a couple of damned uncivil fellows : and I hope your punks will give you sauce to your mutton ! [Exit. Lady Brute. Oh, I shall never come to myself again, I'm so frightened. Const. 'Twas a narrow 'scape indeed. Bel. Women must needs have frolics, you see, whatever they cost 'em. Heart. This might have proved a dear one though. Lady Brute. You are the more obliged to us, for the risk we run upon your accounts. Const. And I hope you'll acknowledge some thing due to our knight-errantry, ladies. This is a second time we have delivered you. Lady Brute. 'Tis true ; and since we see fate has designed you for our guardians, 'twill make us the more willing to trust ourselves in your hands. But you must not have the worse opinion of us for our innocent frolic. Heart. Ladies, you may command our opinions in everything that is to your advantage. Bel. Then, sir, I command you to be of opinion, that women are sometimes better than they appear to be. [Lady Brute and Constant talk apart. Heart. Madam, you have made a convert of me in every thing. I'm grown a fool : I could be fond of a woman. Bel. I thank you, sir, in the name of the whole sex. Heart. Wbich sex nothing but yourself could ever have atoned for. Const. To a deserving husband I confess it is. Lady Brute. But can his faults release my duty ? Const. In equity, without doubt. And where laws dispense with equity, equity should dispense with laws. Bel. Now has my vanity a devilish itch to know in what my merit consists. Heart. In your humility, madam, that keeps you ignorant it consists at all. Bel. One other compliment with that serious face, and I hate you for ever after. Heart. Some women love to be abused : is that it you would be at ? Lady Brute. Pray let's leave this dispute ; for you men have as much witchcraft in your argu ments as women have in their eyes. Const. But whilst you attack me with your charms, 'tis but reasonable I assault you with mine. Lady Brute. The case is not the same. What mischief we do we can't help, and therefore are to be forgiven. Bel. No, not that neither ; but I'd have men talk plainly what's fit for women to hear ; without putting 'em either to a real or an affected blush. Heart. Why then, in as plain terms as I can find to express myself, I could love you even to \u2014 matrimony itself, a-most, egad. Bel. Just as sir John did her ladyship there. What think you ? Don't you believe one month's time might bring you down to the same indiffer ence, only clad in a little better manners, perhaps ? Well, you men are unaccountable things, mad till you have your mistresses, and then stark mad till you are rid of 'em again. Tell me, honestly, ia Const. Beauty soon obtains pardon for the pain that it gives, when it applies the balm of compassion to the wound : but a fine face and a hard heart is almost as bad as an ugly face and a soft one ; both very troublesome to many a poor gentleman. Lady Brute. Yes, and to many a poor gentle woman too, I can assure you. But pray, which of 'em is it that most afflicts you ? A A 2"], [450, "356 THE PROVOKED WIFE. ACT V. Const. Your glass and conscience will inform you, madam. But for Heaven's sake ! (for now I must be serious) if pity or if gratitude can move you: \u2014 [ Taking her hand] if constancy and truth have power to tempt you : if love, if adoration can affect you, give me at least some hopes that time may do what you perhaps mean never to perform ; 'twill ease my sufferings, though not quench my flame. Coast Death and furies ! who are these ? Lady Brute. O Heavens ! I'm out of my wits : if they knew me, I am ruined. Const. Don't be frightened ! ten thousand to one they are strangers to you. Lady Brute. Whatever they are, I won't stay here a moment longer. Const. Whither will you go ? Lady Biute. Home, as if the devil were in me. \u2014 Lord ! whete's this Belinda now ? Lady Brute. Your sufferings eased, your flame would soon abate : and that I would preserve, not quench it, sir. Re-enter Belinda and Heartfree. Const. Would you preserve it, nourish it with favours ; for that's the food it naturally requires. Lady Brute. Yet on that natural food 'twould surfeit soon, should I resolve to grant all you would ask. Oh ! it's well you are come : I'm so frightened. my hair stands on end. Let's begone, for Heaven's sake ! Bel. Lord ! what's the matter ? Lady Brute. The devil's the matter, we are discovered. Here's a couple of women have done the most impertinent thing ! \u2014 Away ! away ! away ! away ! away ! [Exit running, the others following. Const. And in refusing all you starve it. For give me, therefore, since my hunger rages, if I at last grow wild, and in my frenzy force at least this from you. \u2014 [Kissing her hand.] Or if you'd have my flame soar higher still, then grant me this, and this, and this \u2014 [Kissing first her hand, then her neck], \u2014 and thousands more. \u2014 [Aside] For now's the time, she melts into compassion. Lady Brute. [Aside.] Poor coward virtue, how it shuns the battle. \u2014 [Aloud.] O Heavens I let me go. Re-enter Lady Fancyful and Mademoiselle. Lady Fan. Well, Mademoiselle, 'tis a prodi gious thing how women can suffer filthy fellows to grow so familiar with 'em. Mad. Ah, matam, il n'y a rien de si naturel. Lady Fan. Fi ! fi ! fi ! But oh my heart ! O jealousy ! O torture ! I'm upon the rack. What shall I do ? My lover's lost, I ne'er shall see him mine. \u2014 [Pausing.] But I may be revenged, and that's the same thing. Ah, sweet revenge ! Thou welcome thought, thou healing balsam to my wounded soul, be but propitious on this one occa sion, I'll place my heaven in thee for all my life to come. Const. Ay, go, ay : where shall we go, my charming angel ? \u2014 Into this private arbour. \u2014 Nay, let's lose no time \u2014 moments are precious. Lady Brute. And lovers wild. Pray let us stop here ; at least for this time. Const. 'Tis impossible. He that has power over ycu can have none over himself. [As he is forcing her into the arbour, Lady Fancyful and Mademoiselle rush out upon them, and run over the stage. Lady Brute. Ah, I'm lost ! To woman how indulgent nature's kind ! No blast of fortune long disturbs her mind Compliance to her fate supports her still ; If love won't make her happy \u2014 mischief will. [Exeunt Lady Fan. Fi ! fi ! fi ! fi ! fi ! Atad.

Enter Constant, Heartfree, Lady Brute, Belinda, and Lovewell. Mad. C'est que le mari n'y est pas. Lady Fan. No, so I believe, truly. But he shall be there, and quickly too, if I can find him out. Well, 'tis a prodigious thing, to see when men and women get together, how they fortify one another in their impudence. But if that drunken fool, her husband, be to be found in e'er a tavern in town, I'll send him amongst 'em. I'll spoil their sport ! Lady Brute. But are you sure you don't mistake, Lovewell ? Love. Madam, I saw 'em all go into the tavern together, and my master was so drunk he could scarce stand. [Exit. Lady Brute. Then, gentlemen, I believe we may venture to let you stay, and play at cards with us an hour or two : for they'll scarce part till morning"], [451, "THE PROVOKED WIFE. 357 SCENE II. Bel. I think 'tis a pity they should ever part. Const. The company that's here, madam. Lady Brute. Then, sir, the company that's here must remember to part itself in time. Const. Madam, we don't intend to forfeit your future favours by indiscreet usage of this. The moment you give us the signal, we shan't fail to make our retreat. Sir John. So, now you being as dirty and as nasty as myself, we may go pig together. But first I must have a cup of your cold-tea, wife. [Going to the closet. Lady Brute. [Aside.] Oh, I'm ruined! \u2014 [Aloud.] There's none there, my dear. Sir John. I'll warrant you I'll find some, my dear. Lady Brute. Upon those conditions then let us sit down to cards. Lady Brute. You can't open the door, the lock's spoiled ; I have been turning and turning the key this half-hour to no purpose. I'll send for the smith to-morrow. Re-enter Lov-ewe-l-l. Love. O Lord, madam ! here's my master just staggering in upon you ; he has been quarrelsome yonder, and they have kicked him out of the com pany. Sir John. There's ne'er a smith in Europe can open a door with more expedition than I can do. \u2014 As for example ! \u2014 Pou. \u2014 [He bursts open the door with his foot.] How now ! What the devil have we got here ? \u2014 Constant ! \u2014 Heartfree ! \u2014 and two whores again, egad ! \u2014 This is the worst cold-tea \u2014 that ever I met with in my life. \u2014 Lady Brute.

Gentlemen \u2014 I am your very humble servant \u2014 I give you many thanks \u2014 I see you take care of my family \u2014 I shall do ali I can to return the obligation. Const. Sir, how oddly soever this business may appear to you, you would have no cause to be uneasy if you knew the truth of all things ; your lady is the most virtuous woman in the world, and nothing has passed but an innocent frolic. Heart. Nothing else, upon my honour, sir. Sir John. You are both very civil gentlemen \u2014 and my wife, there, is a very civil gentlewoman ; therefore I don't doubt but many civil things have passed between you. Your very humble servant ! Lady Brule. [Aside to Constant.] Pray be gone : he's so drunk he can't hurt us to-night, and to-morrow morning you shall hear from us. Const. [Aside to Lady Brute.] I'll obey you, madam. \u2014 [Aloud.] Sir, when you are cool, you'll understand reason better. So then I shall take the pains to inform you. If not \u2014 I wear a sword, sir, and so good-bye to you ! \u2014 Come along, Heart free. [Exeunt Constant and Heartfree. Lady Brule. Lord, where have you been ? Sir John. I have been at \u2014 cuffs. Lady Brute. I fear that is not all. I hope you are not wounded. Sir John. Sound as a roach, wife. Lady Brute. I'm mighty glad to hear it. Sir John. You know \u2014 I think you lie. Lady Brule I know you do me wrong to think bo. For Heaven's my witness I had rather see my own blood trickle down than yours. Sir John. Then will I be crucified. Lady Brute. 'Tis a hard fate I should not be believed. Sir John. 'Tis a damned atheistical age, wife. Lady Brute. I am sure I have given you a thou sand tender proofs how great my care is of you. Nay, spite of all your cruel thoughts, I'll still per sist, and at this moment, if I can, persuade you to lie down, and sleep a little. Sir John. Why\u2014 do you think I am drunk \u2014 you slut, you ? Lady Brute. Heaven forbid I should : but I'm afraid you are feverish. Pray let me feel your pulse. Sir John. Stand off, aud be damned ! Lady Brute. Why, I see your distemper in your very eyes. You are all on fire. Pray go to bed ; let me entreat you. Sir John. Come kiss me, then. Sir John. Wear a sword, sir ! \u2014 And what of ail that, sir ? \u2014 He comes to my house ; eats my meat ; lies with my wife ; dishonours my family ; gets a bastard to inherit my estate \u2014 and when I ask a civil account of all this \u2014 Sir, says he, I wear a sword. \u2014 Wear a sword, sir ! Yes, sir, says he, I wear a sword. \u2014 It may be a good answer at cross purposes ; but 'tis a damned one to a man in my whimsical circumstances \u2014 Sir, says he, I wear a sword! \u2014 [To Lady Brute.] And what do you wear now? ha! tell me. \u2014 [Sitting down in a great-chair.] What ! you are modest, and can't. \u2014 Why then I'll tell you, you slut you !

ACT V.- me some time, but for reasons unknown to us has ever been very earnest the thing might be kept from sir John. That therefore hearing him upon the stairs he run into the closet, though against our will, and Constant with him, to prevent jealousy. And to give this a good impudent face of truth, (that I may deliver you from the trouble you are in), I'll e'en (if he pleases) marry him. Lady Brute. I'm beholden to you, cousin ; but that would be carrying the jest a little too far for your own sake. You know he's a younger brother, and has nothing. Bel. 'Tis true : but I like him, and have fortune enough to keep above extremity. I can't say I would live with him in a cell, upon love and bread and butter : but I had rather have the man I love, and a middle state of life, than that gentleman in the chair there, and twice your ladyship's splen dour. Bel. But sure we are not so wicked as they are after all ? Lady Brute. We are as wicked, child, but our vice lies another way. Men have more courage than we, so they commit more bold impudent sins. They quarrel, fight, swear, drink, blaspheme, and the like ; whereas we, being cowards, only back bite, tell lies, cheat at cards, and so forth. But 'tis late : let's end our discourse for to-night, and out of an excess of charity take a small care of that nasty drunken thing there. \u2014 Do but look at him, Belinda. Bel. Ah \u2014 'tis a savoury dish ! Lady Brute. As savoury as 'tis I'm cloyed with't. Prithee call the buttler to take it away. Bel. Call the butler ! \u2014 call the scavenger ! \u2014 [To a Servant within.] Who's there ? Call Rasor ! Let him take away his master, scour him clean with a little soap and sand, and so put him to bed. Lady Brute. Come, Belinda, I'll e'en lie with you to-night ; and in the morning we'll send for our gentlemen to set this matter even. Bel. With all my heart. Lady Brute. Good night, my dear ! [Making a low curtsy to Sir John. Lady Brute. In truth, niece, you are in the right on't : for I am very uneasy with my ambition. But perhaps, had I married as you'll do, I might have been as ill used. Bel. Some risk, I do confess, there always is : but if a man has the least spark, either of honour or good-nature, he can never use a woman ill, that loves him, and makes his fortune both. Yet I must own to you, some little struggling I still have with this teasing ambition of ours. For pride, you know, is as natural to a woman, as 'tis to a saint. I can't help being fond of this rogue ; and yet it goes to my heart to think I must never whisk to Hyde-park with above a pair of horses ; have no coronet upon my coach, nor a page to carry up my train. But above all \u2014 that business of place. \u2014 Well ; taking place is a noble prerogative. Lady Brute. Especially after a quarrel. Bel. Or of a rival. But pray say no more on't for fear I change my mind. For o' my conscience, were't not for your affair in the balance, I should go near to pick up some odious man of quality yet, and only take poor Heartfree for a gallant. Lady Brute. Then him you must have, however things go ? Bel. Yes. Both. Ha ! ha ! ha ! [Exeunt. Enter Rasor. Ras. My lady there's a wag \u2014 my master there's a cuckold. Marriage is a slippery thing : \u2014 women have depraved appetites: \u2014 my lady's a wag. I have heard all ; I have seen all ; I understand all ; and I'll tell all ; for my little Frenchwoman loves news dearly. This story'U gain her heart, or nothing will. \u2014 [ To his Master.] Come, sir, your head's too full of fumes at present to make room for your jealousy ; but I reckon we shall have rare work with you when your pate's empty. Come to your kennel, you cuckoldly drunken sot you ! [Carries him out upon his back. SCENE III. \u2014 A Room in Lady Fancyful's House. Lady Brute. Why we may pretend what we will, but 'tis a hard matter to live without the man we love. Enter Lady Fancyful and Mademoiselle. Lady Fan. But why did not you tell me before, Mademoiselle, that Rasor and you were fond ? Mad. De modesty hinder me, matam. Lady Fan. Why, truly, modesty does often hinder us from doing things we have an extravagant mind to. But does he love you well enough yet to do anything you bid him ? Do you think to oblige you he would speak scandal ? Atad. Matam, to oblige your ladyship, he shall speak blasphemy. Lady Fan. Why then, Mademoiselle, I'll tell you what you shall do. You shall engage him to tell his master all that passed at Spring-garden : I have a mind he should know what a wife and a niece he has got. Bel. Especially when we are married to the man we hate. Pray tell me : do the men of the town ever believe us virtuous when they see us do so ? Lady Brute. Oh, no : nor indeed hardly, let us do what we will. They most of 'em think, there is no such thing as virtue, considered in the strictest notions of it : and therefore when you hear 'em say, such a one is a woman of reputation, they only mean she's a woman of discretion. For they consider we have no more religion than they have, nor so much morality ; and between you and I, Belinda, I'm afraid the want of inclination seldom protects any of us. Bel. But what think you of the fear of being found out ? Alad. II le sera, matam. Lady Brute. I think that never kept any woman virtuous long. We are not such cowards neither. No : let us once pass fifteen, and we have too good an opinion of our own cunning to believe the world can penetrate into what we would keep a secret. And so in short we cannot reasonably blame the men for judging of us by themselves. Enter a Fwotman, who speaks to Mademoiselle apart. Foot. Mademoiselle, yonder's Mr. Rasor desires to speak with you. Alad. Tell him I come presently [Exit Foot man.] Rasor be dare, matam."], [453, "THE PROVOKED WIFE. 359 SCENE III. Lady Fan.

That any man of parts may draw tickling conclusions from 'em. Atad. Fort bien. Ras. We have found a couple of tight well-built gentlemen stuffed into her ladyship's closet. Mad. Le diable ! Ras. And I, in my particular person, have discovered a most damnable plot, how to persuade my poor master, that all this hide and seek, this will-in-the-wisp, has no other meaning than a Christian marriage for sweet Mrs. Belinda.

I should have, if I had a good opinion enough of hers, to believe she could do as much by me. For to do 'em right, after all, the wife seldom rambles till the husband shows her the way. Const. 'Tis true ; a man of real worth scarce ever is a cuckold but by his own fault. Women are not naturally lewd, there must be something to urge 'em to it. They'll cuckold a churl, out of revenge ; a fool, because they despise him ; a beast, because they loathe him. But when they make bold with a man they once had a well-grounded value for, 'tis because they first see themselves neglected by him. Heart. Nay, were I well assured that I should never grow sir John, I ne'er should fear Belinda'd play my lady. But our weakness, thou knowest, my friend, consists in that very change we so im pudently throw upon (indeed) a steadier and more generous sex. SCENE IV. \u2014 Another Room in the same. Enter Lady Fancyful and Mademoiselle Lady Fan. Marry, say ye? will the two things marry ? Mad. On le va faire, matam. Lady Fan. Look you, Mademoiselle, in short, I can't bear it. \u2014 No ; I find I can't. \u2014 If once I see 'em a-bed together, I shall have ten thousand thoughts in my head will make me run distracted. Therefore run and call Rasor back immediately, for something must be done to stop this impertinent wedding. If I can defer it but four-and-twenty hours, I'll make such work about town, with that little pert slut's reputation, he shall as soon marry a witch. Alad. [Aside.] La voila bien intentionnee. [Exeunt. Const. Why, faith, we are a little impudent in that matter, that's the truth on't. But this is wonderful, to see you grown so warm an advocate for those (but t'other day) you took so much pains to abuse ! SCENE V. \u2014 Constant's Lodgings. Enter Constant and Heartfree. Const. But what dost think will come of this business ? Heart. All revolutions run into extremes; the bigot makes the boldest atheist ; and the coyest saint, the most extravagant strumpet. But prithee advise me in this good and evil, this life and death, this blessing and cursing, that is set before me. Shall I marry \u2014 or die a maid ? Const. Why faith, Heartfree, matrimony is like an army going to engage. Love's the forlorn hope, which is soon cut off ; the marriage-knot is the main body, which may stand buff a long long time ; and repentance is the rear-guard, which rarely gives ground as long as the main battle has a being. Heart. Conclusion then ; you advise me to whore on as you do ? Const. That's not concluded yet. For though marriage be a lottery, in which there are a won drous many blanks ; yet there is one inestimable lot, in which the only heaven on earth is written. Would your kind fate but guide your hand to that, though I were wrapped in all that luxury itself could clothe me with, I still should envy you. Heart. And justly, too : for to be capable of loving one, doubtless is better than to possess a thousand. But how far that capacity's in me, alas ! I know not. Heart. 'Tis easier to think what will not come on't. Const. What's that ? Heart. A challenge. I know the knight too well for that : his dear body will always prevail upon his noble soul to be quiet. Const. But though he dare not challenge me, perhaps he may venture to challenge his wife. Heart. Not if you whisper him in the ear, you won't have him do't, and there's no other way left that I see. For as drunk as he was, he'll remem ber you and I were where we should not be ; and I don't think him quite blockhead enough yet to be persuaded we were got into his wife's closet only to peep in her prayer-book. Enter Servant with a letter. Serv. Sir, here's a letter ; a porter brought it. [Exit. Const. O ho ! here's instructions for us. \u2014 [Reads.] The accident that has happened has touched our invention to the quick. We would fain come off without your help, but find that's impossible. In a word, the whole business must be thrown upon a matrimonial intrigue between your friend and mine. But if the parties are not fond enough to go quite through with the matter, 'tis sufficient for our turn they own the design. We'll find pretences enough to break the \u25a0match. Adieu ! \u2014 Well, woman for invention I How long would my blockhead have been a pro- ducing this ! \u2014 Hey, Heartfree ! What musing, man ! prithee be cheerful. What sayest thou, friend, to this matrimonial remedy? Heart. Why I say it's worse than the disease. Const. Here's a fellow for you ! There's beauty and money on her side, and love up to the ears on his ; and yet \u2014 Heart. And yet, ' think, I may reasonably be allowed to boggle at marrying the niece, in the very moment that you are debauching the aunt. Const. Why truly there may be something in that. But have not you a good opinion enough of your own parts to believe you could keep a wife to yourself? Const. But you would know ? Heart. I would so. Const. Matrimony will inform you. Come, one flight of resolution carries you to the land of expe rience ; where, in a very moderate time, you'll know the capacity of your soul and your body both, or I'm mistaken. [Exeunt +\u25a0 \u2014 SCENE VI.\u2014 A Room in Sir John Brute's House. Enter Lady Brute and Belinda. Bel. Well, madam, what answer have you from 'em ? Lady Brute. That they'll be here this moment. I fancy 'twill end in a wedding : I'm sure he's a fool if it don't. Ten thousand pound, and such a lass as you are, is no contemptible offer to a younger brother. But are not y.,u under strange agitations ? Prithee how does your pulse beat ?"], [455, "THE PROVOKED WIFE. SCENE VI. 361 Bel. High and low, 1 have much ado to be valiant : sure it must feel very strange to go to bed to a man ! already to justify both her conduct and mine. You'll pardon me for meddling in your family affairs ; but I perceive I am the man you are jea lous of, and therefore it concerns me. Lady Brute. Um \u2014 it does feel a little odd at first, but it will soon grow easy to you. Sir John. Would it did not concern me, and then I should not care who it concerned. Enter Constant and Heartfree. Const. Well, sir, if truth and reason won't con tent you, I know but one way more, which, if you think fit, you may take. Sir John. Lord, sir, you are very hasty. If I had been found at prayers in your wife's closet, I should have allowed you twice as much time to come to yourself in. Const. Nay, sir, if time be all you want, we have no quarrel. Heart. [Aside to Constant.] I told you how the sword would work upon him. [Sir John muses. Const. [Aside to Heartfree.] Let him muse ; however, I'll lay fifty pound our foreman brings us in, Not Guilty. Sir John. [Aside.] 'Tis well \u2014 'tis very well. \u2014 In spite of that young jade's matrimonial intrigue, I am a downright stinking cuckold. \u2014 Here they are \u2014 Boo! \u2014 [Putting his hand to his forehead.] Methinks I could butt with a bull. What the plague did I marry her for ? I knew she did not like me ; if she had, she would have lain with me ; for I would have done so because I liked her : but that's past, and I have her. And now, what shall I do with her ? \u2014 If I put my horns in my pocket, she'll grow insolent. \u2014 If I don't, that goat there, that stallion, is ready to whip me through the guts The debate, then, is reduced to this ; shall I die a hero ? or live a rascal ? \u2014 Why, wiser men than I have long since concluded, that a living dog is better than a dead lion. \u2014 [Aloud.] Gentle men, now my wine and my passion are governable, I must own, I have never observed anything in my wife's course of life to back me in my jealousy of her : but jealousy's a mark of love ; so she need not trouble her head about it, as long as I make no more words on't. Lady Brute. Good-morrow, gentlemen ! How have you slept after your adventure ? Heart. Some careful thoughts, ladies, on your accounts have kept us waking. Bel. And some careful thoughts on your own, I believe, have hindered you from sleeping. Pray how does this matrimonial project relish with you ? Heart. Why faith e'en as storming towns does with soldiers, where the hopes of delicious plunder banishes the fear of being knocked on the head. Bel. Is it then possible after all that you dare think of downright lawful wedlock ? Heart. Madam, you have made me so foolhardy I dare do anything. Bel. Then, sir, I challenge you ; and matri mony's the spot where I expect you. Heart. 'Tis enough; I'll not fail. \u2014 [Aside. ] So, now, I am in for Hobbes's voyage ; a great leap in the dark. Lady Brute. Well, gentlemen, this matter being concluded then, have you got your lessons ready ? For sir John is grown such an atheist of late he'll believe nothing upon easy terms. Const. We'll find ways to extend his faith, madam. But pray how do you find him this morning ? Lady Brute. Most lamentably morose, chewing the cud after last night's discovery ; of which how ever he had but a confused notion e'en now. But I'm afraid the valet-de-chambre has told him all, for they are very busy together at this moment. When I told him of Belinda's marriage, I had no other answer but a grunt : from which you may draw what conclusions you think fit. \u2014 But to your notes, gentlemen, he's here. Enter Sir John Brute and Rasor. Enter Lady Fancyful disguised; she addresses Belinda apart. Const. Good-morrow, sir. Heart. Good-morrow, sir John. I'm very sorry my indiscretion should cause so much disorder in your family. Sir John. Disorders generally come from indis cretions, sir ; 'tis no strange thing at all. Lady Brute. I hope, my dear, you are satisfied there was no wrong intended you. Sir John. None, my dove. Bel. If not, I hope my consent to marry Mr. Heartfree will convince you. For as little as I know of amours, sir, I can assure you, one intrigue is enough to bring four people together, without further mischief. Const. I'm glad to see your reason rule at last. Give me your hand : I hope you'll look upon me as you are wont. Sir John. Your humble servant. \u2014 [Aside.] A wheedling son of a whore ! Heart. And that I may be sure you are friends with me too, pray give me your consent to wed your niece. Sir John. Sir, you have it with all my heart : damn me if you han't ! \u2014 [Aside.] 'Tis time to get rid of her :\u2014 a young pert pimp ! she'll make an incomparable bawd in a little time. Enter a Servant, who gives Heartfree a letter. Bel. Heartfree your husband, say you ? 'tis Sir John. And I know, too, that intrigues tend to procreation of more kinds than one. One intrigue will beget another as soon as beget a son or a daughter. Const. I am very sorry, sir, to see you still seem unsatisfied with a lady whose more than common virtue, I am sure, were she my wife, should meet a better usage. Sir John.

Younger brothers have nothing to settle but their hearts, and that I believe my friend here has already done very faithfully. Lady Brute. What means this sudden meta morphose % Ras. Nothing, without my pardon. Lady Brute. What pardon do you want ? Ras. Imprimis, your ladyship's; for a damnable lie made upon your spotless virtue, and set to the tune of Spring-Garden. \u2014 [To Sir John.] Next, at my generous master's feet I bend, for interrupting his more noble thoughts with phantoms of disgrace ful cuckoldom. \u2014 [ To Constant.] Thirdly, I to this gentleman apply for making him the hero of my romance \u2014 [To Heartfree.] Fourthly, your pardon, noble sir, I ask, for clandestinely marrying you, without either bidding of banns, bishop's licence, friends' consent \u2014 or your own knowledge. [To Belinda.] And lastly, to my good young lady's clemency I come, for pretending the corn was sowed in the ground, before ever the plough had been in the field. Bel. [Scornfully.] Are you sure, sir, there are no old mortgages upon it ? Heart. [Coldly.] If you think there are, madam, it mayn't be amiss to defer the marriage till you are sure they are paid off. Bel. [Aside.] How the galled horse kicks ! \u2014 [ To Heartfree] We'll defer it as long as you please, sir. Heart. The more time we take to consider on't, madam, the less apt we shall be to commit over sights ; therefore, if you please, we'll put it off for just nine months. Bel. Guilty consciences make men cowards ; I don't wonder you want time to resolve. Heart. And they make women desperate ; I don't wonder you were so quickly determined. Bel. What does the fellow mean ? Sir John. [Aside.] So that after all, 'tis a moot point, whether I am a cuckold or not. Bel. Well, sir, upon condition you confess all, I'll pardon you myself, and try to obtain as much from the rest of the company. But I must know then who 'tis has put you upon all this mischief? Ras. Satan and his equipage ; woman tempted me, lust weakened me \u2014 and so the devil overcame me ; as fell Adam, so fell I. Bel. Then pray, Mr. Adam, will you make us acquainted with your Eve ? Ras.

One moment brings sunshine.\u2014 [Pointing to Mademoiselle.] 'Tis true this is the woman that tempted me ; but this is the serpent that tempted the woman ; and if my prayers might be heard, her punishment for so doing should be like the serpent's of old. \u2014 [Pulls off Lady Fancyful's mask.] She should lie upon her face all the days of her life.

To speak for a play if it can't Bpeak for itself is vain ; and if it can, 'tis needless. For one of these reasons (I can't yet tell which, for 'tis now but the 6econd day of acting) I resolve to say nothing for \u00c6sop, though I know he'd be glad of help ; for let the best happen that can. his journey's up hill, with a dead English weight at the tail of him. At Paris indeed he scrambled up something faster (for 'twas up hill there too) than I'm afraid he will do here : the French having more mercury in their heads, and less beef and pudding in their bellies. Our solidity may set hard, what their folly makes easy : for fools I own they are, you know we have found them so in the conduct of the war ; I wish we may do so in the management of the peace : but that's neither \u00c6sop's business nor mine. This play, gentlemen (or one not much unlike it) , was writ in French about six years since by one Monsieur Boursault ; \u2022twas played at Paris by the French comedians, and this was its fate :\u2014 The first day it appeared, 'twas routed ;\u2014 people seldom being fond of what they don't understand, their own sweet persons excepted. The second (by the help of some bold knight-errants) it rallied ; the third it advanced ; the fourth it gave a vigorous attack ; and the fifth put all the feathers in town to the scamper, pursuing 'em on to the fourteenth, and then they cried out quarter. 'Tis not reasonable to expect \u00c6sop should gain so great a victory here, since 'tis possible by fooling with his sword I may have turned the edge on't. For I confess in the translation I have not at all stuck to the original. Nay, I have gone farther : I have wholly added the fifth Act, and crowded a country gentleman into the fourth, for which I ask Monsieur Boursaulfs pardon with all my heart, but doubt I never shall obtain it for bringing him into such company. Though after all, had I been so complaisant to have waited on his play word for word, 'tis possible even that might not have ensured the success of it : for though it swam in France, it might have sunk in England. Their country abounds in cork, ours in lead. DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6. People who come to \u00c6sop, upon several occasions, \u00c6sop. independent one of another.

PROLOGUE, For though with heavenly zeal you all abound, As by your lives and morals may be found ; Though every female here o'erflows with grace, And chaste Diana's written in her face ; Though maids renounce the sweets of fornication, And one lewd wife's not left in all the nation ; Though men grow true, and the foul fiend defy ; Though tradesmen cheat no more, nor lawyers lie Though not one spot be found on Levi's tribe, Nor one soft courtier that will touch a bribe ; Yet in the midst of such religious days. Sermons have never borne the price of plays. Gallants ! we never yet produced a play With greater fears than this we act to-day j Barren of all the graces of the stage, Barren of all that entertains this age. No hero, no romance, no plot, no show, No rape, no bawdy, no intrigue, no beau : There's nothing in't with which we use to please ve With downright dull instruction we're to tease ye: The stage turns pulpit, and the world 's so fickle, The playhouse in a whim turns conventicle. But preaching here must prove a hungry trade, The patentees will find so, I 'm afraid :"], [462, "368 \u00c6SOP. ACT I. ACT T. 'Tis true, he's plain ; but that, my girl's, a trifle. All manly beauty's seated in the soul ; And that of \u00c6sop, envy's self must own Outshines whate'er the world has yet produced. Cr\u0153sus, the prosperous favourite of Heaven ; Cr\u0153sus, the happiest potentate on earth ; Whose treasure (though immense) is the least part Of what he holds from Providence's care, Leans on his shoulder as his grand support ; Admires his wisdom, dotes upon his truth, And makes him pilot to imperial sway. But in this elevated post of power, What's his employ ? where does he point his thoughts ? To live in splendour, luxury, and ease, Do endless mischiefs, by neglecting good, And build his family on others' ruins ? No: He serves the prince, and serves the people too ; Is useful to the rich, and helps the poor ; There's nothing stands neglected, but himself. With constant pain, and yet with constant joy, From place to place throughout the realm he goes, With useful lessons, form'd to every rank : The people learn obedience from his tongue, The magistrate is guided in command, The prince is minded of a father's care ; The subject's taught the duty of a child. And as 'tis dangerous to be bold with truth, He often calls for fable to his aid, Where under abject names of beasts and birds, Virtue shines out, and vice is clothed in shame : And thus by inoffensive wisdom's force, He conquers folly wheresoe'er he moves ! This is his portrait. Dor. A very good picture of a very ill face ! Lear. Well, daughter ; what, not a word? Is it possible anything that I am father of can be un touched with so much merit ? SCENE I. \u2014 A Room in Learchus's House. Enter Learchijs, Euphronia, and Doris. Lear. At length I am blessed with the sight of the world's wonder, the delight of mankind, the incomparable \u00c6sop. \u2014 You had time to observe him last night, daughter, as he sat at supper with me. Tell me how you like him, child ; is he not a charming person ? Euph. Charming! Lear. What sayest thou to him, Doris ? Thou art a goon judge, a wench of a nice palate. Dor. You would not have me flatter, sir ? Lear. No, speak thy thoughts boldly. Dor. Boldly, you say ? Lear. Boldly, I say. Dor. Why then, sir, my opinion of the gentle man is, that he's uglier than an old beau. Lear. How! Impudence. Dor. Nay, if you are angry, sir, second thoughts are best ; he's as proper as a pikeman, holds up his head like a dancing-master, has the shape of a barb, the face of an angel, the voice of a cherubim, the smell of a civet-cat \u2014 Lear. In short, thou art fool enough not to be pleased with him. Dor. Excuse me for that, sir ; I have wit enough to make myself merry with him. Lear. If his body's deformed, his soul is beau tiful : would to kind Heaven, as he is, my daughter could but find the means to please him ! Euph. To what end, dear father ? Lear. That he might be your husband, dear daughter. Euph. My husband ! Shield me, kind Heaven ! Dor. Psha ! he has a mind to make us laugh, that's all. Lear. \u00c6sop, then, is not worth her care, in thy opinion ? Dor. Why truly, sir, I'm always for making suitable matches, and don't much approve of breed ing monsters. I would have nothing marry a baboon but what has been got by a monkey. Lear. How darsst thou liken so incomparable a man to so contemptible a beast? Dor. Ah, the inconstancy of this world ! Out of sight, out of mind. Your little monkey is scarce cold in his grave, and you have already forgot what you used so much to admire. Do but call him to remembrance, sir, in his red coat, new gloves, little hat, and clean linen ; then discharge your con science, utter the truth from your heart, and tell us whether he was not the prettier gentleman of the two. \u2014 By my virginity, sir, (though that's but a slippery oath you'll say,) had they made love to me together, \u00c6sop should have worn the willow. Lear. Since nothing but an animal will please thee, 'tis pity my monkey had not that virginity thou hast sworn by. But I, whom wisdom charms, even in the homeliest dress, can never think the much deserving \u00c6sop unworthy of my daughter. Dor. Now, in the name of wonder, what is't you so admire in him ? Euph. My duty may make all things possible. But \u00c6sop is so ugly, sir. Lear. His soul has so much beauty in't, your reason ought to blind your eyes. Besides, my in terest is concerned ; his power alarms me. 1 know throughout the kingdom he's the scourge of evil magistrates ; turns out governors when they turn tyrants ; breaks officers for false musters ; excludes judges from giving sentence when they have been absent during the trial ; hangs lawyers when they take fees on both sides ; forbids physicians to take money of those they don't cure. 'Tis true, my innocence ought to banish my fears : but my government, child, is too delicious a morsel not to set many a frail mouth a-watering. Who knows what accusations envy may produce ? But all would be secure, if thou couldst touch the heart of \u00c6sop. Let me blow up thy ambition, girl ; the fire of that will make thy eyes sparkle at him. \u2014 [Euphronia sighs.] What's that sigh for now? Ha ! \u2014 A young husband, by my conscience ! Ah, daughter, hadst thou a young husband, he'd make thee sigh indeed. I'll tell thee what he's composed of. He has a wig full of pulvilio, a pocket full of dice, a heart full of treason, a mouth full of lies, a belly full of drink, a carcass full of plasters, a tail Lear.

Had it been a handsome strong dog of five-and-twenty, she'd a fallen a coquetting on't, with every inch about her. But maybe it's I that spoil sport, I'll make a pretence to leave 'em together. \u2014 [ Aloud.] Will your lordship please to drink any coffee this morning? \u00c6sop. With all my heart, governor. Lear. Your lordship will give me leave to go and order it myself; for unless I am by, 'tis never perfect. \u00c6sop. Provided you leave me this fair maid in hostage for your return, I consent. Lear. My good lord does my daughter too much honour.\u2014 [Aside.] Ah, that the wench would but do her part ! \u2014 [Aside to Euphronia.] Hark you, hussy ! You can give yourself airs sometimes, you know you can. Do you remember what work you made with yourself at church t'other day ? Play your tricks over again once more for my pleasure, and let me have a good account of this statesman, or, d'ye hear ? \u2014 you shall die a maid ; go chew upon that ; go. [Exit. \u00c6sop. Here I am left, fair damsel, too much exposed to your charms, not to fall your victim. Euph. Your fall will then be due to your own weakness, sir ; for Heaven's my witness, I neither endeavour nor wish to wound you. \u00c6sop. I understand you, lady ; your heart's already disposed of, 'tis seldom otherwise at your age. Enter \u00c6sop. Lear. Good morning to my noble lord ! your excellency \u2014 \u00c6sop. Softly, good governor : I'm a poor wanderer from place to place ; Too weak to train the weight of grandeur with me. The name of excellency's not for me. Lear. My noble lord, 'tis due to your employ ; Your predecessors all \u2014 \u00c6sop. My predecessors all deserved it, sir, They were great men in wisdom, birth, and service ; Whilst I, a poor, unknown, decrepit wretch, Mounted aloft for Fortune's pastime, Expect each moment to conclude the farce, By sinking to the mud from whence I sprung. Lear. Great Cr\u0153sus' gratitude will still support His coffers all are open to your will, [you ; Y >ur future fortune's wholly in your power. \u00c6sop. But 'tis a power that I shall ne'er employ. /-ear. Why so, my lord ? \u00c6sop. I'll tell you, sir. A hungry goat, who had not eat Some nights and days \u2014 (for want of meat) Was kindly brought at last, By Providence's care, To better cheer, After a more than penitential fast. He found a barn well stored with grain, To enter in required some pain ; But a delicious bait Makes the way easy, though the pass is strait. Our guest observing various meats, He puts on a good modish face, He takes his place, He ne'er says grace, But where he likes, he there falls to and eats. At length with jaded teeth and jaws, Euph. My heart disposed of ! Dor. Nay, never mince the matter, madam. The gentleman looks like a civil gentleman, e'en confess the truth to him. He has a good interest with your father, and no doubt will employ it to break the heathenish match he proposes to you. \u2014 [To \u00c6sop. ] Yes, sir, my young lady has been in love these two years, and that with as pretty a fellow as ever entered a virgin's heart ; tall, straight, young, vigorous, good clothes, long peri wig, clean linen ; in brief, he has everything that's necessary to set a young lady a-longing, and to stay it when he has done. But her father, whose ambi tion makes him turn fool in his old age, comes with a back stroke upon us, and spoils all our sport. Would you believe it, sir ! he has proposed to her to-day the most confounded ugly fellow. Look, if the very thoughts of him don't set the poor thing a-crying ? And you, sir, have so much power with the old gentleman, that one word from you would set us all right again. If he will have her a wife, in the name of Venus let him provide her a handsome husband, and not throw her into the paws of a thing that nature in a merry humour has made half man, half monkey. \u00c6sop. Pray what's this monster's name, lady ? Euph. No matter for his name, sir ; my father will know who you mean at first word. \u00c6sop. But you should not always choose by the outside alone ; believe me, fair damsel, a fine peri wig keeps many a fool's head from the weather. Have a care of your young gallant. Dor. There's no danger, I have examined him ; his inside's as good as his out ; I say he has wit, and I think I know. He made a pause, And finding still some room, Fell to as he had done before, For time to come laid in his store ; And when his guts could hold no more, He thought of going home. But here he met the glutton's curse ; He found his belly grown so great, 'Twas vain to think of a retreat, Till he had render'd all he'ad eat, And well he fared no worse. To the application, governor. Lear. 'Tis easy to be made, my lord. \u00c6sop. I'm glad on't. Truth can never be too clear. [Seeing Euphronia. Is this young damsel your fair daughter, sir ? Lear. 'Tis my daughter, my good lord. Fair too, if she appears such in the eyes of the unerring \u00c6sop. \u00c6sop. I never saw so beautiful a creature. [Going up to salute her. Lear. [Aside.] Now's the time ; kiss, soft girl, and fire him. \u00c6sop. How partial's nature 'twixt her form and mine ! [Gazing at her. Lear. [Aside.] Look, look, look, how he gazes at her ! \u2014 Cupid's hard at work, I see that already. Slap ; there he hits him ! \u2014 If the wench would but do her part. \u2014 But see, see, how the perverse young Euph. Nay, she says true ; he's even a miracle of wit and beauty : did you but see him, you'd be yourself my rival. B B"], [464, "370 \u00c6SOP, ACT 1 \u00c6sop. Then youare resolved against the monster. Dor. Fy, sir, fy ! I wonder you'll put her in mind of that foul frightful thing. We shall have her dream of nothing all night but bats and owls, and toads and hedgehogs, and then we shall have such a squeaking and squalling with her, the whole house will be in an uproar : therefore, pray sir, name him no more, but use your interest with her father that she may never hear of him again. \u00c6sop. But if I should be so generous to save you from the old gallant, what shall I say for your young one ? Euph. Oh, sir, you may venture to enlarge upon his perfections ; you need not fear saying too much in his praise. Dor. And pray, sir, be as copious upon the defects of t'other ; you need not fear outrunning the text there neither, say the worst you can. Euph. You may say the first is the most graceful man that Asia ever brought forth. Dor. And you may say the latter is the most deformed monster that copulation ever produced. Euph. Tell him that Oronces (for that 's his dear name) has all the virtues that compose a perfect hero. Dor. And tell him that Pigmy has all the vices that go to equip an attorney. Euph. That to one I could be true to the last moment of my life. Dor. That for t'other she'd cuckold him the very day of her marriage. \u2014 This, sir, in few words, is the theme you are desired to preach upon. \u00c6sop. I never yet had one that furnished me more matter. may be understood ; language was designed for it, indeed it was. Hort. Of vulgar things, in vulgar phrase we talk ; But when of \u00c6sop we must speak, The theme's too lofty for an humble style : \u00c6sop is sure no common character. \u00c6sop. No, truly, I am something particular. Yet, if I am not mistaken, what I have extraor dinary about me, may be described in very homely language. Here was a young gentlewoman but just now pencilled me out to a hair, I thought ; and yet, I vow to Gad, the learned'st word I heard her make use of, was monster. Hort. That was a woman, sir, a very woman ; Her cogitations all were on the outward man : But I strike deeper, 'tis the mind I view. The soul's the worthy object of my care ; The soul, that sample of divinity, That glorious ray of heavenly light. The soul, That awful throne of thought, that sacred seat Of contemplation. The soul, that noble source Of wisdom, that fountain of comfort, that spring of joy, That happy token of eternal life : The soul, that \u00c6sop. Pray, lady, are you married ? Hort. Why that question, sir ? \u00c6sop. Only that I might wait upon your hus band to wish him joy. Hort. When people of my composition would marry, they first find something of their own species to join with ; I never could resolve to take a thing of common fabric to ray bed, lest when his brutish inclinations prompt him, he should make me mother to a form like his own. Enter Servaat. \u00c6sop. Methinks a lady so extremely nice, should be much at a loss who to converse with. Ser. My lord, there's a lady below desires to speak with your honour. \u00c6sop. What lady? Ser. It's my lady \u2014 my lady \u2014 [To Doris.] The lady there, the wise lady, the great scholar, that no body can understand. Dor. O ho, is it she : pray let's withdraw, and oblige her, madam ; she's ready to swoon at the insipid sight of one of her own sex. Euph. You'll excuse us, sir, we leave you to wiser company. [Exeunt Euphronia and Doris. Hort. Sir I keep my chamber, and converse with myself; 'tis better being alone, than to misally one's conversation. Men are scandalous, and women are insipid : discourse without figure makes me sick at my soul : Oh the charms of a metaphor 1 What harmony there is in words of erudition I The music of them is inimaginable. \u00c6sop. Will you hear a fable, lady ? Hort. Willingly, sir ; the apologue pleases me when the application of it is just. \u00c6sop. It is, I'll answer for it. Enter Hortensia. Hort.

I know he's modest, but I likewise know His intellects are categorical. \u00c6sop. Now, by my faith, lady, I don't know what intellect is ; and methinks categorical sounds as if you called me names. Pray speak that you I don't know why I should not try As well as he to sing.\" From that day forth she changed her note, She spoil'd her voice, she strain'd her throat She did, as learned women do, Till every thing That heard her sing, Would run away from her \u2014 as I from you.

Lear. Very fine ! but all this shan't serve her turn. \u2014 I have said the word, and will be obeyed. \u2014 My lord does her honour. Enter Hobson and Humphry. Hob. There he is, neighbour, do but look at him. Hum. Ay, one may know him, he's well marked. But, dost hear me ? what title must we give him ? for if we fail in that point, d'ye see me, we shall never get our business done. Courtiers love titles almost as well as they do money, and that's a bold word now. Dor. [Aside.] Yes, and that's all he can do to her [To Learchus.] But I can't blame the gentleman, after all ; he loves my mistress because she's handsome, and she hates him because he's ugly. I never saw two people more in the right in my life. \u2014 [To \u00c6sop.] You'll pardon me, sir, I'm somewhat free. \u00c6sop. Why, a ceremony would but take up time. \u2014 But, governor, methinks I have an admir able advocate about your daughter. Lear. Out of the room, Impudence ! begone, I say ! Hob. Why, I think we had best call him his Grandeur. Hum. That will do ; thou hast hit on't. Hold still, let me speak. \u2014 May it please your grandeur \u2014 \u00c6sop. There I interrupt you, friend ; I have a weak body that will ne'er be able to bear that title. Hum. D'ye hear that, neighbour ? what shall we call him now ? Hob. Why, call him, \u2014 call him \u2014 his Excellency; try what that will do. Hum. May it please your excellency \u2014 \u00c6sop. Excellency's a long word ; it takes up too much time in business. Tell me what you'd have in few words. Dor. So I will ; but you'll be as much in the wrong when 1 am gone as when I am here : and your conscience, I hope, will talk as pertly to you as I can do. \u00c6sop. If she treats me thus before my face, I may conclude I'm finely handled behind my back. Dor. I say the truth here, and I can say no worse anywhere. [Exit. Lear. I hope your lordship won't be concerned at what this prattling wench bleats out ; my daugh ter will be governed, she's bred up to obedience. There mny be some small difficulty in weaning her from her young lover ; but 'twon't be the first time she has been weaned from a breast, my lord. \u00c6sop. Does she love him fondly, sir ? Lear. Foolishly, my lord. \u00c6sop. And he her ? Lear. The same. Hum. Neighbour, this man will never give ten thousand pounds to be made a lord. But what shall I say to him now ? He puts me quite out of my play. Hob. Why e'en talk to him as we do to one another. Hum. Shall 1 ? why so I will then. \u2014 Hem ! Neighbour ; we want a new governor, neighbour. \u00c6sop. A new governor, friend I Hum. Ay, friend. \u00c6sop. Why, what's the matterwith your old one ? Mum. What's the matter ? Why he grows rich ; that's the matter : and he that's rich, can't be innocent ; that's all. \u00c6sop. Does he use any of you harshiy ? or punish you without a fault ? Hum. No, but he grows as rich as a miser, his purse is so crammed, it's ready to burst again. \u00c6sop. When 'tis full 'twill hold no more. A new governor will have an empty one. Hum. 'Fore Gad, neighbour, the little gentle man's in the right on't ! Hob. Why truly I don't know but he may. For now it comes in my head. It cost me more money to fat my hog, than to keep him fat when he was so. Prithee, tell him we'll e'en keep our old governor. Hum. I'll do't. \u2014 Why, look you, sir, d'ye see me ? having seriously considered of the matter, my neighbour Hobson, and I here, we are content to jog on a little longer with him we have : but if you'd do us another courtesy, you might. \u00c6sop. What's that, friend ? Hum. Why that's this : our king Cr\u0153sus is a very good prince, as a man may say : \u2014 but \u2014 a- but \u2014 taxes are high, an't please you ; and \u2014 a \u2014 poor men want money, d'ye see me. It's very hard, as we think, that the poor should work to maintain the rich. If there were no taxes, we should do pretty well. \u00c6sop. Is he young? Lear. Yes, and vigorous. \u00c6sop. Rich ? Lear. So, so. \u00c6sop. Well-born ? Lear. He has good blood in his veins. \u00c6sop. Has he wit ? Lear. He had, before he was in love. \u00c6sop. And handsome with all this ? Lear. Or else we should not have half so much trouble with him. \u00c6sop. Why do you then make her quit him for me ? All the world knows I am neither young, noble, nor rich ; and as for my beauty \u2014 look you, governor, I'm honest. But when children cry, they tell 'em \u00c6sop's a-coming. Pray, sir, what is it makes you so earnest to force your daughter ? Lear. Am I then to count for nothing the favour you are in at court ? Father-in-law to the great \u00c6sop ! What may I not aspire to ? My foolish daughter, perhaps, mayn't be so well pleased with't, but we wise parents usually weigh our chil dren's happiness in the scale of our own inclina tions."], [467, "\u00c6SOP. SCENE I. 373 Hub. Taxes indeed are very burdensome. \u00c6sop. I'll tell you a story, countrymen. Enter Roger ; he looks seriously upon \u00c6sop, and then bursts out a-laughing. Rots. Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Did ever mon behold the like ? ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Once on a time, the hands and feet, As mutineers, grew mighty great ; They met, caball'd, and talk'd of treason, They swore by Jove they knew no reason The belly should have all the meat; It was a damn'd notorious cheat, They did the work, and \u2014 death and hell, they'd eat! \u00c6sop. Hast thou any business with me, friend? Rog. Yes, by my troth, have I; but if Roger were to be hanged up for't, look you now, he could not hold laughing. W7hat I have in my mind, out it comes : but bar that ; I'se an honest lad as well as another. \u00c6sop. My time's dearer to me than yours, friend. Have you anything to say to me? Rog. Gadswookers, do people use to ask for folks when they have nothing to say to 'em? I'se tell you my business. \u00c6sop. Let's hear it. Rog. I have, as you see, a little wit. \u00c6sop. True. Rog. I live in a village hard by, and I'se the best man in it, though I say it that should not say it. I have good drink in my cellar, and good corn in my barn ; I have cows and oxen, hogs and sheep, cocks and hens, and geese and turkeys : but the truth will out, and so out let it. I'se e'en tiiedof being called plain Roger. I has a leathern purse, and in that purse there's many a fair half-crown, with the king's sweet face upon it, God bless him ; and with this money I have a mind to bind myself prentice to a courtier. It's a good trade, as I have heard say ; there's money stirring : let a lad be but diligent, and do what he's bid, he shall be let into the secret, and share part of the profits. I have not lived to these years for nothing : those that will swim must go into deep water. I'se get our wife Joan to be the queen's chambermaid ; and then \u2014 crack says me 1 1 and forget all my acquaint- ance. But to come to the business. You who are the king's great favourite, I desire you'll be pleased to sell me some of your friendship, that I may get a court-place. Come, you shall choose me one yourself ; you look like a shrewd man ; by the mass you do ! \u00c6sop. I choose thee a place ! Rog. Yes : I would willingly have it such a sort of a place as would cost little, and bring in a great deal ; in a word, much profit, and nothing to do. The belly, who adored good cheer, Had like to have died away for fear : Quoth he, \" Good folks, you little know What 'tis you are about to do ; If I am starved, what will become of you ?\" \" We neither know nor care,\" cried they ; 14 But this we will be bold to say, We'll see you damn'd Before we'll work. And you receive the pay.\" With that the hands to pocket went, Full wristband deep, The legs and feet fell fast asleep : Their liberty they had redeem'd, And all except the belly seem'd Extremely well content. But mark what follow'd ; 'twas not long Before the right became the wrong, The mutineers were grown so weak, They found 'twas more than time to squeak : They call for work, but 'twas too late. The stomach (like an aged maid, Shrunk up for want of human aid,) The common debt of nature paid, And with its destiny entrain'd their fate. What think you of this story, friends, ha ? Come, you look like wise men ; I'm sure you understand what's for your good. In giving part of what you have, you secure all the rest. If the king had no money, there could be no army ; and if there were no army, your enemies would be amongst you. One day's pillage would be worse than twenty years' taxes. What say you? is it not so ? Hum. By my troth, I think he's in the right on't again ! Who'd think that little humpback of his should have so much brains in't, neighbour ? \u00c6sop. Well, honest men, is there anything else that I can serve you in ? Hob. D'ye hear that, Humphry ? \u2014 Why that was civil now. But courtiers seldom want good breeding ; let's give the devil his due. \u2014 W7hy, to tell you the truth, honest gentleman, we had a whole budget full of grievances to complain of. But I think \u2014 a \u2014 ha, neighbour ? \u2014 we had e'en as good let 'em alone. \u00c6sop. But you must name what post you think would suit your humour. Rog. Why I'se pratty indifferent as to that : secretary of state, or butler ; twenty shillings more, twenty shillings less, is not the thing I stand upon. I'se no hagler, gadswookers ; and he that says I am \u2014 'zbud he lies ! There's my humour now. \u00c6sop. But hark you, friend, you say you are well as you are ; why then do you desire to change ? Rog. Why what a question now is there for a man of your parts ? I'm well, d'ye see me ; and what of all that ? I desire to be better. There's an answer for you. \u2014 [Aside.] Let Roger alone with him. Hum. Why good feath I think so too, for by all I can see, we are like to make no great hond on't. Besides, between thee and me, I begin to daubt, whether aur grievances do us such a plaguy deal of mischief as we fancy. Hob. Or put case they did, Humphry ; I'se afraid he that goes to a courtier, in hope to get fairly rid of 'em, may be said (in aur country dialect) to take the wrong sow by the ear. \u2014 But here's neighbour Roger, he's a wit, let's leave him to him. [Exeunt Hobson and Humphry. \u00c6sop. Very well : this is reasoning ; and I love a man should reason with me. But let us inquire a little whether your reasons are good or not. You say at home you want for nothing. Rog. Nothing, 'fore George. \u00c6sop. You have good drink ? Rog. 'Zbud the best i'th' parish ! [Sings. And dawne it merrily goes, my lad, And dawne it merrily goes !"], [468, "374 \u00c6SOP. ACT II. \u00c6sop. You eat heartily ? Rog. I have a noble stomach. \u00c6sop. You sleep well? Rog. Just as I drink, till I can sleep no longer. \u00c6sop. You have some honest neighbours ? Rog. Honest ! 'Zbud we are all so, the tawne raund, we live like breether ; when one can sarve another, he does it with all his heart and guts ; when we have anything that's good, we eat it together, holidays and Sundays we play at nine pins, tumble upon the grass with wholesome young maids, laugh till we split, daunce till we are weary, eat till we burst, drink till we are sleepy, then swap into bed, and snore till we rise to breakfast. \u00c6sop. And all this tbou wouldst leave to go to court ! I'll tell thee what once happened. A mouse, who long had lived at court, (Yet ne'er the better christian for't) Walking one day to see some country sport, He met a homebred village-mouse. Who with an awkward speech aud bow, That favoured much of cart and plough, Made a shift, I know not how, To invite him to his house. Quoth he, \" My lord, I doubt you'll find Our country fare of homely kind ; But by my troth, you're welcome to't, Y'ave that, and bread, and cheese to boot :'' And so they sat and dined. Rog. Very well. \u00c6sop. The courtier could have eat at least As much as any household priest, But thought himself obliged in feeding To show the difference of town-breeding : He pick'd and cull'd, and turn'd the meat, He champ'd and chew'd and could not eat : No toothless woman at fourscore, Rog. O Lord ! O Lord ! O Lord ! \u00c6sop. The nimble courtier skipp'd from table, The squire leap'd too, as he was able : It can't be said that they were beat. It was no more than a retreat ; Wfiicb, when an army, not to fight By day-light, runs away by night, Was ever judged a great and glorious feat. Rog. Ever ! ever ! ever ! \u00c6sop. The cat retired, our guests return, The danger past becomes their scorn, They fall to eating as before ; \u2014 The butler rumbles at the door. Rog. Good Lord ! \u00c6sop. To boot and saddle again they sound. Rog. Ta ra ! tan tan ta ra ! ra ra tan ta ra ! \u00c6sop. They frown, as they would stand their ground, But (like some of our friends) they found 'Twas safer much to scour. Rog. Tantive ! Tantive ! Tantive ! &c. \u00c6sop. At length the squire, who hated arms, Was so perplex'd with these alarms, lie rose up in a kind of heat : \" Udzwooks !\" quoth he, with all your meat, I will maintain a dish of pease, A radish, and a slice of cheese, With a good dessert of ease, Is much a belter treat. However, Since every man should have his due, 1 own, sir, I'm obliged to you For your intentions at your board ; But pox upon your courtly crew !\" Rog. Amen ! I pray the Lord. Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Now the de'el cuckold me if this story be not worth a sermon Give me your hond, sir. \u2014 If it had na' been for your friendly advice, I was going to be fool enough to be secretary of state. \u00c6sop. Well, go thy ways home, and be wiser for the future. Was ever seen to mumble more. He made a thousand ugly faces, Which Cas sometimes in ladies' cases) Were all design'd for airs and graces. Rog. Ila ! ha ! \u00c6sop. At last he from the table rose, He pick'd his teelh, and blow'd his nose, And with an easy negligence, As though he lately came from France. He made a careless sliding bow : \" 'Fore Gad,\" quoth he. \" I don't know how I shall return your friendly treat; But if you'll take a bit of meat In town with me, Rog. And so I will : for that same mause, your friend, was a witty person, gadsbudlikins ! and so our wife Joan shall know : for between you and I, 'tis she has put me upon going to court. Sir, she has been so praud, so saucy, so rampant, ever since I brought her home a laced pinner, and a pir.k cclour pair of shoe-strings, from Ticklcdawne Fair, the parson o'th' parish can't rule her ; and that you'll say's much. But so much for that. Naw I thank you for your good caunsel, honest little gentleman ; and to show you that I'se not un grateful \u2014 give me your hand once more. \u2014 If you'll take the pains but to walk dawne to our towne \u2014 a word in your ear \u2014 I'se send you so drunk whome again, you shall remember friendly Roger as long as you have breath in your body. [Exit. \u00c6sop. Farewell ! what I both envy and despise : Thy happiness and ignorance provoke me. How noble were the thing call'd knowledge, Did it but lead us to a bliss like thine ! But there's a secret curse in wisdom's train, Which on its pleasures stamps perpetual pain, And makes the wise man loser by his gain. [Exit You there shall see How we poor courtiers eat.\" Rog. Tit for tat ; that was friendly. \u00c6sop. There needed no more invitation To e'er a country squire i'th' nation : Exactly lo the time he came, Punctual as woman when she meets A man between a pair of sheets, As good a stomach, and as little shame. Rog. Ho ! ho ! ho ! ho ! ho ! \u00c6sop. To say the truth he found good cheer, With wine, instead of ale and beer : But just as they sat down to eat, Comes bouncing in a hungry cat."], [469, "\u00c6SOP, SCENE 1 375 ACT III.

You have something \u2014 wondrous noble in your air. \u00c6sop. Personable too ; view me well. Quaint. N \u2014 not tall ; but majestic. \u00c6sop. My shape. Quaint. A world of symmetry in it. \u00c6sop. The lump upon my back. Quaint. N \u2014 not regular ; but agreeable. \u00c6sop. Now by my honesty thou art a villain, herald. But flattery's a thrust I never fail to parry. 'Tis a pass thou shouldst reserve for young fencers; with feints like those they're to be hit : I do not doubt but thou hast found it so ; hast not ? Quaint. My business, sir, with every man, is first of all to do him service. \u00c6sop. And your next is, I suppose, to be paid for't twice as much as 'tis worth. Quaint. Your honour's most obedient, humble servant. \u00c6sop. Well, sir, but upon what account am I going to be obliged to you ? Quaint. Sir, I'm a genealogist. \u00c6sop. A genealogist ! Quaint. At your service, sir. \u00c6sop. So, sir. Quaint. Sir, I am informed from common fame, as well as from some little private familiar intelli- gence, that your wisdom is entering into treaty with the primum mobile of good and evil, a fine lady. I have travelled, sir ; I have read, sir ; I have considered, sir ; and I find, sir, that the nature of a fine lady is to be \u2014 a fine lady, sir ; a fine lady's a fine lady, sir, all the world over ; she loves a fine house, fine furniture, fine coaches, fine liveries, fine petticoats, fine smocks ; and if she stops there \u2014 she's a fine lady indeed, sir. But to come to my point. It being the Lydian custom, that the fair bride should be presented on her wed- ding-day with something that may signify the merit and the worth of her dread lord and master, I thought the noble \u00c6sop's pedigree might be the welcomest gift that he could offer. If his honour be of the same opinion \u2014 I'll speak a bold word ; there's ne'er a herald in all Asia shall put better blood in his veins, than \u2014 sir, your humble servant, Jacob Quaint. Quaint. I must confess, sir. I have sometimes made 'em bleed by't. But I hope your honour will please lo excuse me, since, to speak the truth, I get my bread by't, and maintain my wife and children : and industry, you know, sir, is a com mendable thing. Besides, sir, I have debated the business a little with my conscience ; for I'm l:ke the rest of my neighbours, I'd willingly get money, and be saved too, if the thing may be done upon any reasonable terms : and so, sir, I say, to quiet my conscience, I have found out at last that flat tery is a duty. \u00c6sop. A duty I Quaint. Ay, sir, a duty : for the duty of all men is to make one another pass their time as pleasantly as they can. Now, sir, here's a young lord, who has a great deal of land, a great deal of title, a great deal of meat, a greal deal of noise, a great many servants, and a great many diseases. I find him very dull, very restless, tired with ease, cloyed with plenty, a burden to himself, and a plague to his family. I begin to flatter : be springs off of the couch ; turns himself round in the glass ; finds all I say true ; cuts a caper a yard high ; his biood trickles round in his veins ; his heart's as light as his heels ; and before I leave him \u2014 his purse is as empty as his head. So we both are content ; for we part much happier than we met. \u00c6sop. Admirable rogue ! what dost thou think of murder And of rape ? Are not they duties too ? Wer't not for such vile fawning things as thou art, \u00c6sop. Dost thou then know my father, friend? for I protest to thee I am a stranger to him. Quaint Your father, sir, ha ! ha ! I know every man's father, sir, and every man's grandfather, and every man's great-grandfather. WThy, sir, I'm a herald by nature ; my mother was a Welch woman. \u00c6sop. A Welchwoman ! Prithee of what coun try's that? Quaint. That, sir, is a country in the world's backside, where every man is born a gentleman, and a genealogist.

A crab-fish once her daughter told, ( In terms that savour' d much of scold) She could not bear to see her go, Sidle, sidle, to and fro ; \" The devils in the wench!\" quoth she, \" When so much money has been paid, To polish you like me; It makes me almost mad to see Y'are still so awkward, an ungainly jade.\" Her daughter smiled, and look'd askew She answer'd (for to give her her due) Pertly, as most folks' daughters do : \" Madam, your ladyship,\" quoth she, \" Is pleased to blame in me What, on inquiry, you may find, Admits a passable excuse, From a proverb much in use, That 4 cat will after kind.' \" Enter Servant.

No ; I love to be out of debt, though 'tis being out of the fashion. \u2014 [To Servant] So, d'ye year? give this honest gentleman half a score good strokes on the back with a cudgel. Quaint.

Your generosity makes me blush, [Looking about to make his escape. Amin. Sir, I took you to be a man better brad, than to liken a lady to a crab-fish. \u00c6sop.

The most can be said is, her face is the worse for wearing : I'll answer for all the rest of her fabric. The men would be to be pitied, by my troth would they, if we should quit the stage, and leave 'em nothing but a parcel of young pert sluts, that neither know how to speak sense, nor keep themselves clean.

As thus : \u2014 You are a pretty, soft, warm, wishing young lady : I'm a straight, proper, handsome, vigorous, young fellow. You have a peevish, positive, covetous, old father, and he forces you to marry a little, lean, crooked, dry, sapless husband. This husband's gone abroad, you are left at home. I make you a visit ; find you all alone ; the servant pulls to the door ; the devil comes in at the window.

But since he can't be satisfied unless he has your heart, as well as all the rest of your trumpery, let me see you receive him in such a manner that he may think himself your choice well as mine ; 'twill make him esteem your judg ment : for we usually guess at other people's understandings, by their approving our actions, and liking our faces.

Euph. Did you but know that fop you dare to No bird, she cried, would serve her turn, But what could quench as well as burn, She'd have a young gallant ; so one she had. But ere a month was come and gone, The bride began to change her tone, She found a young gallant was an inconstant one. She wander'd to a neighbouring grove, Where after musing long on love, She told her confidant, she found When for one's life one must be bound, (Though youth indeed was a delicious bait,) An aged husband, rich, though plain, Would give a slavish wife less pain ; And what was more, was sooner slain, Which was a thing of weight. Behold, young lady, here, the cuckoo of the fable : I am deform'd, 'tis true, yet I have found The means to make a figure amongst men, That well has recompensed the wrongs of Nature. My rival's beauty promises you much ; Perhaps my homely form might yield you more ; At least consider on't, 'tis worth your thought. Euph.

But hark you, young lady ! marriage is to last a long, long time ; And where one couple bless the sacred knot, A train of wretches curse the institution. You're in an age where hearts are young and tender, A pleasing object gets admittance soon. But since to marriage There is annex'd this dreadful word, For Ever, The following example ought to move you. A peacock once of splendid show, Gay, gaudy, foppish, vain \u2014 a beau, Attack'd a fond young pheasant's heart With such success, He pleased her, though he made her smart ; He pierced her with so much address, She smiled the moment that he fix'd his dart. greater ; But what's a fortune to a heart like mine ? 'Tis true, I'm but a young philosopher, Yet in that little space my glass has run, I've spent some time in search of happiness : The fond pursuit I soon observed of riches, Inclined me to inquire into their worth ; I found their value was not in themselves, But in their power to grant what we could ask. I then proceeded to my own desires, To know what state of life would suit with them : I found 'em moderate in their demands, They neither ask'd for title, state, or power ; They slighted the aspiring post of envy : 'Tis true, they trembled at the name contempt ; A general esteem was all they wish'd ; And that I did not doubt might be obtain'd, If furnish'd but with virtue and good-nature ; My fortune proved sufficient to afford me Conveniences of life, and independence. This, sir, was the result of my inquiry ; And by this scheme of happiness I build, When I prefer the man I love to you. \u00c6sop. How wise, how witty, and how cleanly, young women grow, as'soon as ever they are in lo*e! Euph. How foppish, how impertinent, and how nauseous are old men, when they pretend to be so too ! \u00c6sop.

Sir, I have been a widow this twelvemonth. Dor. Patience, I beseech you. Oron. Patience !

If a body may guess at your heart by your petticoat, lady, you don't design to be so a twelvemonth more. Mrs. Forge. O bless me ! not a twelvemonth I why, my husband has left me four squalling brats. Besides, sir, I'm undone. \u00c6sop. You seem as cheerful an undone lady as I have met with. Dor. So you think au old woman a very unfor tunate thing, I find ; but you are mistaken, sir ; she may plague other folks, but she's as entertain ing to herself as any one part of the creation. Oron. [Walking to and fro.] She's the devil ! \u2014 and I'm one of the damned, I think ! But I'll make somebody howl for't, I will so. Mrs. Forge. Alas, sir, I have too great a spirit ever to let afflictions spoil my face. Sir, I'll tell you my condition ; and that will lead me to my business with you. Sir, my husband was a scrive ner. Dor. You'll e'en do as all the young fellqws in the town do, spoil your own sport : ah ! \u2014 had young men's shoulders but old courtiers' heads upon 'em, what a delicious time would they have on't ! For shame be wise ; for your mistress' sake at least use some caution. \u00c6sop. The deuse he was ! I thought he had been a count at least. Mrs. Forge. Sir, 'tis not the first time I have been taken for a countess ; my mother used to say, as I lay in my cradle, I had the air of a woman of quality ; and, truly, I have always lived like such. My husband, indeed, had something sneaking in him, (as most husbands have, you know, sir,) but from the moment I set foot in his house, bless me, what a change was there ! His pewter was turned into silver, his goloshoes into a glass coach, and his little travelling mare into a pair of Flanders horses. Instead of a greasy cookmaid, to wait at table, I had four tall footmen in clean linen ; all things became new and fashionable, and nothing looked awkward in my family. My furniture was the wonler of my neighbourhood, and my clothes the admiration of the whole town ; I had a necklace that was envied by the queen, and a pair of pend ants that set a duchess a-crying. In a word, I saw nothing I liked but I bought it ; and my hus band, good man, durst ne'er refuse paying for't. Thus 1 lived, and I flourished, till he sickened and died ; but, ere he was cold in his grave, his credi tors plundered my house. But what pity it was to see fellows with dirty shoes come into my best rooms, and touch my hangings with their filthy fingers ! You won't blame me, sir, if, with all my courage, I weep at this sensible part of my misfor tune. Oron. For her sake I'll respect, even like a deity, her father. He shall strike me, he shall tread upon me, and find me humbler even than a crawling worm, for I'll not turn again ; but for \u00c6sop, that unfinished lump, that chaos of humanity, I'll use him, \u2014 nay, expect it, for I'll do't \u2014 the first moment that I see him, I'll \u2014 Dor. Not challenge him, I hope. \u2014 'Twould be a pretty sight truly, to see \u00c6sop drawn up in battalia : fy, for shame ! be wise once in your life ; think of gaining time, by putting off the marriage for a day or two, and not of waging war with Pigmy. Yonder's the old gentleman walking by himself in the gallery ; go and wheedle him, you know his weak side ; he's good-natured in the bot- tom. Stir up his old fatherly bowels a little, I'll warrant you'll move him at last : go, get you gone, and play your part discreetly. Oron. Well, I'll try ; but if words won't do with one, blows shall with t'other ; by heavens they shall. [Exit. Dor. Nay, I reckon we shall have rare work on't by and by. Shield us, kind Heaven I what things are men in love !

Pray, sir, how high may you be taxed ? Sir Pol. How high may I be taxed, sir ! \u2014 Why, I may be taxed, sir, \u2014 four shillings in the pound, sir ; one-half I pay in money \u2014 and t'other half I pay in perjury, sir Hey, Joular! Joular!

But, sir, I don't like these taxes. This, widow, I take to be your case, and that of a great many others ; for this is an age where most people get falls by clambering too high, to reach at what they should not do. The shoemaker's wife reduces her husband to a cobbler, by endea vouring to be as spruce as the tailor's ; the tailor's brings hers to a botcher, by going as fine as the mercer's ; the mercer's lowers hers to a foreman, by perking up to the merchant's ; the merchant's wears hers to a broker, by strutting up to quality ; and quality bring theirs to nothing, by striving to outdo one another. If women were humbler, men would be honester. Pride brings want, want makes rogues, rogues come to be hanged, and the devil alone's the gainer. Go your ways home, woman ; and, as your husband maintained you by his pen, maintain yourself by your needle ; put your great girls to service, employment will keep 'em honest ; much work, and plain diet, will cure the green-sickness as well as a husband.

The choice can't sure be difficult to make; I hope you will excuse my youthful heat, Young men and lovers have a claim to pardon ; But since the faults of age have no such plea, I hope you'll be more cautious of offending. The flame that warms Euphronia's heart and mine Has long, alas ! been kindled in our breasts : Even years are past since our two souls were wed, 'Twould be adultery but to wish to part 'em. And would a lump of clay alone content you, A mistress cold and senseless in your arms, Without the least remains or signs of life, Except her sighs, to mourn her absent lover ? Whilst you should press her in your eager arms, With fond desire and ecstacy of love, Would it not pierce you to the very soul, To see her tears run trickling down her cheeks, And know their fountain meant 'em all to me ? Could you bear this ? Yet thus the gods revenge themselves on those Who stop the happy course of mutual love. If you must be unfortunate one way, Choose that where justice may support your grief, And shun the weighty curse of injured lovers. \u00c6sop. Why, this is pleading like a swan indeed ! Were anything at stake but my Euphronia \u2014 Oron. Your Euphronia, sir ! \u2014 \u00c6sop.

But our debate's about a lady, sir, That's young, that's beautiful, that's made for love. \u2014 So am not I, you'll say ? But you're mistaken ; sir ; I'm made to love, though not to be beloved. I have a heart like yours ; I've folly too : I've every instrument of love like others. Oron. But, sir, you have not been so long a lover ; Your passion's young and tender, 'Tis easy for you to become its master ; Whilst I should strive in vain : mine's old and Oron. O here he is. \u2014 Sir, I have been searching for you, to say two words to you. \u00c6sop. And now you have found me, sir, what are they ? Oron.

Know, sir \u2014 that you are in the right on't. Oron. But I pretend, sir, that nobody else shall admire her. \u00c6sop. Then I pretend, sir, she won't admire you. Oron. Why, so, sir ? \u00c6sop. Because, sir \u2014 Oron. What, sir ? \u00c6sop. She's a woman, sir. Oron. What then, sir ? \u00c6sop. Why then, sir, she desires to be admired by every man she meets. Oron. Sir, you are too familiar. \u00c6sop.

Yet age sometimes is strong, even to the verge of life. \u00c6sop. Ay, but there our comparison don't hold. Oron. You are too merry to be much in love. \u00c6sop. And you too sad to be so long. Oron.

Tell him, 'tis not impossible, a change may happen, provided he gives you time: but that if he goes to force you, there's another piece of nature peculiar to woman, which may chance to spoil all, and that's contradiction. Ring that argument well in his ears : he's a philosopher, he knows it has weight in't. In short, wheedle, whine, flatter, lie, weep, spare nothing ; it's a moist age, women have tears enough ; and when you have melted him down, and gained more time, we'll employ it in closet-debates how to cheat him to the end of the chapter. Euph. But you don't consiiSer, Doris, that by this means I engage myself to him ; and can't afterwards with honour retreat. Enter Euphronia and Doris. Euph. Heavens, what is't you make me do, Doris ? Apply myself to the man I loathe ; beg favours from him I hate ; seek a reprieve from him I abhor ; 'tis low, 'tis mean, 'tis base in me. Dor. Why, you hate the devil as much as you do \u00c6sop, (or within a small matter,) and should you think it a scandal to pray him to let you alone a day or two, if he were going to run away with you ; ha ? Euph. I don't know what I think, nor what I say, nor what I do : but sure thou'rt not my friend thus to advise me. Dor. I advise ! I advise nothing ; e'en follow your own way ; marry him, and make much of him. I have a mind to see some of his breed ; if you like it, I like it. He shan't breed out of me only ; that's all I have to take care of. Euph. Prithee don't distract me. Dor. Why, to-morrow's the day, fixed and firm, you know it. Much meat, little order, great many relations, few friends, horse-play, noise, and bawdy stories, all's ready for a complete wedding. Euph. Oh ! what shall I do ? Dor. Nay, 1 know this makes you tremble ; and yet your tender conscience scruples to drop one hypocritical curtsy, and say, pray, Mr. \u00c6sop, be so kind to defer it a few days longer. Euph. Thou knowest I cannot dissemble. Dor. I know you can dissemble well enough when you should not do't. Do you remember how you used to plague your poor Oronces ; make him believe you loathed him, when you could have kissed the ground he went on ; affront him in all public places ; ridicule him in all company ; abuse him wherever you went : and when you had reduced him within ambs-ace of hanging or drown ing then come home with tears in your eyes, and cry, Now, Doris, let's go lock ourselves up, and talk of my dear Oronces. \u2014 Is not this true ? Euph. Yes, yes, yes. But, prithee, have some compassion of me. Come, I'll do anything thou biddest me. \u2014 What shall I say to this monster ? tell me, and I'll obey thee. Dor. Nay, then there's some hopes of you. \u2014 Why you must tell him \u2014 'Tis natural to you to dislike folks at first sight : that since yon have considered him better, you find your aversion abated : that though perhaps it may be a hard matter for you ever to think him a beau, you don't despair in time of finding out his je-ne-sais-quoi. And that on t'other side ; though you have hitherto thought (as most young women do) that nothing could remove your first affection, yet you Dor. Madam, I know the world. \u2014 Honour's a jest, when jilting's useful. Besides, he that would have you break your oath with Oronces, can never have the impudence to blame you for cracking your word with himself. But who knows what may happen between the cup and the lip ? Let either of the old gentlemen die, and we ride triumphant. Would I could but see the states man sick a little, I'd recommend a doctor to him, a cousin of mine, a man of conscience, a wise physician ; tip but the wink, he understands you. Euph. Thou wicked wench, wouldst poison him ? Dcr. I don't know what I would do. I think, I study, I invent, and somehow I will get rid of him. I do more for you, I'm sure, than you and your knight-errant do together for yourselves. Euph. Alas ! both he and I do all we can ; thou knowest we do. Dor. Nay, I know y'are willing enough to get together ; but y'are a couple of helpless things, Heaven knows. Euph. Our stars, thou seest, are bent to oppo sition. Dor.

Now show yourself Dor. She shall give you fair play for't, sir ; opportunity and leave to prattle, and that's what carries most women in our days. Nay, she shall do more for you. You shall play with her fan ; squeeze her little finger ; buckle her shoe ; read a romance to her in the arbour ; and saunter in the woods on a moonshiny night. If this don't melt her, she's no woman, or you no man. \u00c6sop. I'm not a man to melt a woman that way : I know myself, and know what they require. 'Tis through a woman's eye you pierce her heart. And I've no darts can make their entrance there. a woman, if you are one. Enter \u00c6sop. \u00c6sop. I'm told, fair virgin, you desire to speak with me. Lovers are apt to flatter themselves ; I take your message for a favour. I hope 'twas meant so. Euph. Favours from women are so cheap of late, men may expect 'em truly without vanity. \u00c6sop. If the women are so liberal, I think the men are generous too on their side. 'Tis a well bred age, thank Heaven : and a deal of civility there passes between the two sexes. \u2014 What service is't that I can do you, lady ? Euph. Sir, I have a small favour to entreat you. \u00c6sop. What is't ? I don't believe I shall refuse you. Dor. You are a great statesman, sir ; but I find ! you know little of our matters. A woman's heart is to be entered forty ways. Every sense she has | about her keeps a door to it. With a smock-face, and a feather, you get in at her eyes. With power ful nonsense, in soft words, you creep in at her ears. An essenced peruke, and a sweet handker chief, lets you in at her nose. With a treat, and a box full of sweetmeats, you slip in at her mouth : and if you would enter by her sense of feeling, 'tis as beaten a road as the rest. What think you now, sir? There are more ways to the woods than one, you see. Euph. What if you should promise me you won't ? \u00c6sop. Why then I should make a divorce be tween my good-breeding and my sense, which ought to be as sacred a knot as that of wedlock. Euph. Dare you not trust then, sir, the thing you love ? \u00c6sop. Not when the thing I love don't love me : never ! \u00c6sop. Why, you're an admirable pilot ; I don't doubt but you have steered many a ship safe to harbour. But I'm an old stubborn seaman ; I must sail by my own compass still. Dor. Trust is sometimes the way to be beloved. \u00c6sop. Ay, but 'tis oftener the way to be cheated. Euph. Pray promise me you'll grant my suit. Dor. 'Tis a reasonable one, I give you my word for't. Euph. And, by your obstinacy, lose your vessel. \u00c6sop. No : I'm just entering into port ; we'll be married to-morrow. Euph. For Heaven's sake, defer it some days longrer ! I cannot love you yet, indeed I cannot. \u00c6sop. Nor never will, I dare swear. Euph. Why then will you marry me? \u00c6sop. Because 1 love you. Euph. If you loved me, you would never make me miserable. \u00c6sop. If it be so, I do promise to grant it. Dor. That's still leaving yourself judge. \u00c6sop. Why, who's more concerned in the trial ? Dor. But nobody ought to be judge in their own cause. \u00c6sop. Yet he that is so, is sure to have no wrong done him. Dor. But if he does wrong to others, that's worse. \u00c6sop. Not if I loved you for your sake ; but I love you for my own. Dor. [Aside.] There's an old rogue for you. Euph. [Weeping] Is there no way left ! must I be wretched ? \u00c6sop. Worse for them, but not for him. Dor. True politician, by my troht ! \u00c6sop. Men must be so when they have to do with sharpers. Euph. If I should tell you then there were a possibility I might be brought to love you, you'd scarce believe me. \u00c6sop. 'Tis but resolving to be pleased. You can't imagine the strength of resolution. I have seen a woman resolve to be in the wrong all the days of her life ; and by the help of her resolution she has kept her word to a tittle. Euph. Methinks the subject we're upon should be of weight enough to make you serious. \u00c6sop. Right. To-morrow morning, pray be ready ; you'll find me so : I'm serious. Now I hope you are pleased. [Turning away from her. Euph. Break heart! for if th.u boldest, I'm miserable. [Going off weeping, and leaning upon Doris. \u00c6sop. I should hope as a lover, and suspect as a statesman. Dor.

Amongst women, I must confess I have. Euph. Why, I'm a woman, sir. \u00c6sop. Why, truly, that gives me some hopes. Euph. I'll increase 'em, sir ; I have already been in love two years. Dor.

Where's my old friend Doris ? Dor. She's here, sir, at your service ; and as much your friend as ever : true to her principles, and firm to her mistress. But she has a much better opinion of you now than she had half an hour ago. \u00c6sop. She has reason : for my soul appeared then as deformed as my body. But I hope now one may so far mediate for t'other, that provided I don't make love, the women won't quarrel with me ; for they are worse enemies even than they are friends Come, gentlemen, I'll humour my dress a little longer, and share with you in the diversions these boon companions have prepared us. Let s take our places, and see how they can divert us. [\u00c6sop leads Euphronia to her place. All being seated, there follows a short concert of hautboys, trumpets. Lear. I shall be a great man. Re-enter Oronces, pinioned and guarded. \u00c6sop. O ho, here's my rival ! Then we have all we want. \u2014 Advance, sir, if you please. I aesire you'll do me the favour to be a witness to ray mar riage, lest one of these days you should take a fancy to dispute my wife with me. Oron. Do you then send for me to insult me ? 'Tis base in you. \u00c6sop. I have no time now to throw away upon points of generosity ; I have hotter work upon my hands. \u2014 Come, priest, advance. Lear. Pray hold him fast there ; he has the devil and all of mischief in's eye. \u00c6sop. [To Euphronia.] Will your ladyship please, mame, to give me your fair hand. \u2014 Heyday ! [She refuses her hand. Lear. I'll give it you, my noble lord, if she won't- \u2014 [Aside.] A stubborn, self-willed, stiff necked strumpet ! [Learchus holds out her hand to \u00c6sop, who takes it ; Oronces stands on \u00c6sop's left hand, and the Priest before them. \u00c6sop.

What I want in youth and fire, I have in love and in desire : They talk'd of nothing but their fires, Of raging heats and strong desires, Of eternal constancy ; How true and faithful they would De, Of this and that, and endless joys, And a thousand more such toys : The only thing they apprehended, Was that their lives would be so short, They could not finish half their sport Before their days were ended. But as from bough to bough they rove, They chanced at last In furious haste, On a twig with birdlime spread, (Want of a more downy bed) To act a scene of love. To my arms, my love, my joy ! Why so cold, and why so coy? Woman. 'Tis sympathy perhaps with you ; You are cold, and I'm so too. Old Man. My years alone have froze my blood ; Youthful heat in female charms, Glowing in my aged arms, Would melt it down once more into a flood. Woman. Women, alas, like flints, ne'er burn To make a virgin know [alone ; There's fire within the stone, Some manly steel must boldly strike the blow. Old Man. Assist me only with your charms, You'll find I'm man, and still am bold ; You'll find I still can strike, though old : Fatal it proved to both their fires. For though at length they broke away, And balk'd the schoolboy of his prey, WThich made him weep the livelong day, The bridegroom in the hasty strife, Was stuck so fast to his dear wife, I only want your aid to raise my arm. Enter a Youth, who seizes on the Young \"Woman. Youth. Who talks of charms, who talks of aid ? I bring an arm That wants no charm, That though he used his utmost art, He quickly found it was in vain, To put himself to further pain, They never more must part. A gloomy shade o'ercast his brow ; He found himself \u2014 I know not how: To rouse the fire that's in a flinty maid. Retire, old age ! \u2014 Woman. Winter, begone ! Behold, the youthful Spring comes gaily on. Here, here's a torch to light a virgin's fire ! To my arms, my love, my joy ! When women have what they desire, They're neither cold nor coy. [She takes him in her arms. The song and dance ended, \u00c6sop takes Euphronia and Oronces by the hands, He look'd \u2014 as husbands often do. Where'er he moved he felt her still, She kiss'd him oft against his will : Abroad, at home, at bed and board, With favours she o'erwhelm'd her lord. Oft he turn'd his head away, And seldom had a word to say. WThich absolutely spoil'd her play, For she was better stored. leading them forwards. \u00c6sop. By this time, my young eager couple, 'tis probable you would be glad to be alone ; perhaps you'll have a mind to go to bed even without your supper ; for brides and bridegrooms eat little on their wedding-night. But since if matrimony were worn as it ought to be, it would perhaps sit easier Rbout us than usually it does, I'll give you one word of counsel, and so I shall release you. When one is out of humour, let the other be dumb. Let your diversions be such as both may have a share in 'em. Never let familiarity exclude respect. Be clean in your clothes, but nicely so in your persons. Eat at one table, lie in one room, but sleep in two beds : I'll tell the ladies why. \u2014 Howe'er at length her stock was spent, (For female fires sometimes may be Subject to mortality ;) So back to back they sit and sullenly repent. But the mute scene was quickly ended, The lady, for her share, pretended The want of love lay at his door ; For her part she had still in store Enough for him and twenty more, Which could not be contented. He answer'd her in homely words, (For sparrows are but ill-bred birds,) That he already had enjoy'd So much, that truly he was cloy'd. Which so provoked her spleen, That after some good hearty prayers, A jostle, and some spiteful tears, They fell together by the ears, And ne'er were fond again. [Exeunt omne. [Turning to the boxes.

Why, sir, as for the scoundrels, they, poor dogs, stuck by the wreck. The captain gave them bread and cheese, and good words. He told them if they would patch her up, and venture t'other cruise, he'd prefer 'em all ; so to work they went, and to sea they got her. \u00c6sop. I hope he kept his word with 'em. Play. That he did ; he made the boatswain's mate lieutenant ; he made the cook doctor ; he was forced to be purser, and pilot, and gunner himself; and the swabber took orders to be chaplain. \u00c6sop. But with such unskilful officers, I'm afraid, they'll hardly keep above water long. Play. Why, truly, sir, we care not how soon they are under : but cursed folks thrive, I think. I know nothing else that makes 'em swim. I'm sure, by the rules of navigation, they ought to have overset long since ; for they carry a great deal of sail, and have very little ballast. \u00c6sop. I'm afraid you ruin one another. I fancy if you were all in a ship together again, you'd have less work and more profit. Play. Ah, sir \u2014 we are resolved we'll never sail under captain Patentee again. \u00c6sop. Prithee, why so ? Play. Sir, he has used us like dogs. Worn. And bitches too, sir. \u00c6sop. I'm sorry to hear that ; pray how was't he treated you ? Play. Sir, 'tis impossible to tell ; he used us like the English at Amboyna. \u00c6sop. But I would know some particulars ; tell me what 'twas he did to you. Play. What he did, sir ! \u2014 why, he did iu the first place, sir \u2014 in the first place, sir, he did \u2014 ecod, I don't know what he did. \u2014 Can you tell, wife ? Worn. Yes, marry can I ; and a burning shame it was too. \u00c6sop. Well, good people, who are all you ? All. Sir, we are players. \u00c6sop. Players! what players? Play. Why, sir, we are stage-players, that's our calling : though we play upon other things too ; some of us play upon the fiddle ; some play upon the flute ; we play upon one another ; we play upon the town ; and we play upon the pa tentees. Osop. Patentees ! prithee, what are they ? Play. Why, they are, sir \u2014 sir, they are \u2014 cod, I don't know what they are ! \u2014 fish or flesh \u2014 mas ters or servants : \u2014 sometimes one \u2014 sometimes t'other, I think \u2014 just as we are in the mood. \u00c6sop. Why, I thought they had a lawful autho rity over you. Play. Lawful authority, sir ! \u2014 sir, we are free born Englishmen, we care not for law nor authority neither, when we are out of humour. \u00c6sop. But I think they pretended at least to an authority over you ; pray upon what foundation was it built ? Play. Upon a rotten one \u2014 if you'll believe us. Sir, I'll tell you what the projectors did : they embarked twenty thousand pound upon a leaky vessel. \u2014 She was built at Whitehall ; I think they called her \u2014 the Patent \u2014 ay, the Patent : her keel was made of a broad seal \u2014 and the king gave them a white staff for their mainmast. She was a pretty tight frigate to look upon, indeed : they spared nothing to set her off ; they gilded her, and painted her, and rigged, and gunned her ; and so sent her a- privateering. But the first storm that blew, down went the mast ! ashore went the ship ! \u2014 Crack ! says the keel : \u2014 Mercy ! cried the pilot; but the wind was so high, his prayers could not be heard \u2014 so they split upon a rock \u2014 that lay hid under a petticoat. \u00c6sop. A very sad story, this : but what became of the ship's company ? Play. Why, sir, your humble servants here, who were the officers, and the best of the sailors \u2014 (little Ben amongst the rest) seized on a small bark that lay to our hand, and away we put to sea again. To s?y the truth, we were better manned than rigged, and ammunition was plaguy scarce amongst us. However, a-cruising we went, and some petty small prizes we have made ; but the blessing of heaven not being among us \u2014 or how the devil 'tis, I can't tell ; but we are not rich. Play. Oh, I remember now, sir, he would not give us plums enough in our pudding. \u00c6sop. That indeed was very hard ; but did he give you as many as he promised you ? Play. Yes, and more ; but what of all that? we had not as many as we had a mind to. 1 Worn. Sir, my husband tells you truth. \u00c6sop. I believe he may. But what other wrongs did he do you ? 1 Worn. Why, sir, he did not treat me with respect ; 'twas not one day in three he would so much as bid me good-morrow. 2 Worn. Sir, he invited me to dinner, and never drank my health."], [483, "\u00c6SOP.

Then he cocked his hat at Mrs. In short they all had hopes to see A heavenly crop of mutiny, And so to reaping fell : But in a little time they found, It was the devil had till'd the ground, And brought the seed from hell. The pack divided, nothing throve : Discord seized the throne of love. Want and misery all endure. Pert. 2 Worn. Yes, and told Mrs. Slippery he had as good a face as she had. \u00c6sop. Why, these were insufferable abuses ! 2 Play. Then, sir, I did but come to him one day, aud tell him I wanted fifty pound, and what do you think he did by me, sir \u2014 sir, he turned round upon his heel like a top \u2014 1 Play. But that was nothing to the affront he put upon me, sir. I came to him, and in very civil words, as I thought, desired him to double my pay : sir, would you believe it ? he had the bar barity to ask me if I intended to double my work ; and because I told him no, sir \u2014 he did use me \u2014 good Lord, how he did use me ! All take pains, and all grow poor. When they had toil'd the livelong day, And came at night to view their prey, Oft, alas ! so ill they sped, That half went supperless to bed. At length, they all in council sate, Where at a very fair debate, It was agreed at last, That slavery with ease and plenty, When hounds were something turn'd of twenty Was much a better fate, Than 'twas to work and fast. \u00c6sop. Prithee how ? 1 Play. Why, he walked off, and answered me never a word. \u00c6sop. How had you patience ? 1 Play. Sir, I had not patience. I sent him a challenge ; and what do you think his answer was ? \u2014 he sent me word I was a scoundrel son of a whore, and he would only fight me by proxy ! \u00c6sop. Very fine ! 1 Play. At this rate, sir, were we poor dogs used \u2014 till one frosty morning down he comes amongst us \u2014 and very roundly tells us \u2014 that for the future, no purchase no pay. They that would not work should not eat. \u2014 Sir, we at first asked him coolly and civilly, Why ? His answer was, because the town wanted diversion, and he wanted money.- \u2014 Our reply to this, sir, was very short ; but I think to the purpose. \u00c6sop. What was it ? 1 Play. It was, sir, that so we wallowed in plenty and ease \u2014 the town and he might be damned ! This, sir, is the true history of separation \u2014 and we hope you'll stand our friend. \u00c6sop. I'll tell you what, sirs \u2014 1 Play. Well, sir \u2014 and what did they do then ? \u00c6sop. Why, they all went home to their kennel again. If you think they did wisely, you'll do well to follow their example. [Exit. 1 Play. Well, beagles, what think you of the little gentleman's advice ? 2 Worn. I think he's a little ugly philosopher, and talks like a fool. 1 Play. Ah, why, there's it now ! If he had been a tall, handsome blockhead, he had talked like a wise man. 2 Worn. Why, do you think, Mr. Jowler, that we'll ever join again ? 1 Play. I do think, sweet Mrs. Juno, that if we do not join again, you must be a little freer of your carcass than you are, or you must bring down your pride to a serge petticoat. 1 Worn. And do you think, sir, after the affronts I have received, the patent and I can ever be friends ? I once a pack of beagles knew That much resembled \u2014 I know who ; With a good huntsman at their tail, In full command, With whip in hand, They'd run apace The cheerful chace, And of their game were seldom known to fail. But, being at length their chance to find A huntsman of a gentler kind, They soon perceived the rein was slack, The word went quickly through the pack \u2014 They one and all cried \" Liberty ! This happy moment we are free, We'll range the woods, Like nymphs and gods, And spend our mouths in praise of mutiny.\" With that old Jowler trots away, And Bowman singles out his prey ; Thunder bellow'd through the wood, And swore he'd burst his guts with blood. Venus tripp'd it o'er the plain, With boundless hopes of boundless gain. Juno, she slipp'd down the hedge, But left her sacred word for pledge ; That all she pick'd up by-the-by Should to the public treasury. And well they might rely upon her ; For Juno was a bitch of honour. 1 Play. I do think, madam, that if my interest had not been more affronted than your face, the patent and you had never been foes. 1 Worn. And so, sir, then you have serious thoughts of a reconciliation ? 1 Play. Madam, I do believe I may. 1 Worn. Why then, sir, give me leave to tell you, that \u2014 make it my interest, and I'll have seri ous thoughts on't too. 2 Worn. Nay, if you are thereabouts, I desire to come into the treaty. 3 Play. And I. 4 Play. And I. 2 Play. And I. No separate peace ; none of your Turin play, I beseech you. 1 Play. Why then, since you are all so chris tianly disposed, I think we had best adjourn im mediately to our council-chamber ; choose some potent prince for mediator and guarantee ; fix upon the place of treaty, despatch our plenipos, and whip up the peace like an oyster.

SCENE II. Enter a Country Gentleman, who walks to and fro, looking angrily upon \u00c6sop. \u00c6sop. Have you any business with me, sir ? Gent. I can't tell whether I have or not. \u00c6sop. You seem disturbed, sir. Gent. I'm always so at the sight of a courtier. \u00c6sop. Pray what may it be that gives you so great an antipathy to 'em ? Gent. My profession. \u00c6sop. What's that? Gent. Honesty. \u00c6sop. 'Tis an honest profession. I hope, sir, for the general good of mankind, you are in some public employment. Gent. So I am, sir ; no thanks to the court. \u00c6sop. You are then, I suppose, employed by \u2014 Gent. My country. \u00c6sop. Who have made you \u2014 Gent. A senator. \u00c6sop. Have you been much about town ? Gent. No, sir. \u00c6sop. Have you conversed much with men of business ? Gent. No, sir. \u00c6sop. Have you made any serious inquiry into the present disorders of the nation ? Gent. No, sir. \u00c6sop. Have you ever heard what the men now employed in business have to say for themselves? Gent. No, sir. \u00c6sop. How then do you know they deserve to be punished for the present disorders in your affairs? Gent. I'll tell you how I know. \u00c6sop. I would be glad to hear. Gent. Why, I know by this \u2014 I know it, I say, by this \u2014 that I'm sure on't. \u2014 And to give you demonstration that I'm sure on't, there's not one man in a good post in the nation \u2014 but I'd give my vote to hang him. Now 1 hope you are convinced. \u00c6sop. As for example : the first minister of state, why would you hang him ? Gent. Because he gives bad counsel. \u00c6sop. How do you know ? Gent. Wrhy they say so. \u00c6sop. And who would you put in his room ? Gent. One that would give better. \u00c6sop. Who's that ? Gent. Myself. \u00c6sop. The secretary of state, why would you hang him ? Gent. Because he has not good intelligence. \u00c6sop. Sir, I reverence you. [Bowing. ' Gent. Sir, you may reverence as low as you please ; but I shall spare none of you. Sir, I am entrusted by my country with above ten thousand of their grievances, and in order to redress 'em, my design is to hang ten thousand courtiers. \u00c6sop. Why, 'tis making short work, I must confess. But are you sure, sir, that would do't ? Gent. Sure ! \u2014 ay, sure. \u00c6sop. How do you know ? Gent. Why, the whole country says so, and I at the head of 'em. Now let me see who dares say the contrary. \u00c6sop. Not I, truly. But, sir, if you won't take it ill, I'll ask you a question or two. Gent. Sir, I shall take ill what I please ; and if you, or e'er a courtier of you all, pretend the con trary, I say it's a breach of privilege. Now put your question, if you think fit. \u00c6sop. Why then, sir, with all due regard to your character, and your privilege too, I would be glad to know what you chiefly complain of? Gent. Why, sir, I do chiefly complain, that we have \u2014 a great many ships, and very little trade ; a great many tenants, and very little money ; a great many soldiers, and very little fighting ; a great many gazettes, and little good news ; a great many states men, and very little wisdom ; a great many parsons, and not an ounce of religion. \u00c6sop. Why truly, sir, I do confess these are grievances very well worth your redressing. I per ceive you are truly sensible of our diseases, but I'm afraid you are a little out in the cure. Gent. Sir, I perceive you take me for a country physician : but you shall find, sir, that a country doctor is able to deal with a court quack ; and to show you that I do understand something of the state of the body politic, I will tell you, sir, that I have heard a wise man say, the court is the sto mach of the nation, in which, if the business be not thoroughly digested, the whole carcass will be in disorder. Now, sir, I do find by the latitude of the members, and the vapours that fly into the head, that this same stomach is full of indigestions, which must be removed. And therefore, sir, I am come post to town with my head full of crocus metallorum, and design to give the court a vomit. \u00c6sop.

And who would you have succeed him ? Gent. My uncle. \u00c6sop. The admiral, why would you hang him ? Gent. Because he has not destroyed the enemies. \u00c6sop. How do you know he could do it ? Gent. Why, I believe so. \u00c6sop. And who would you have command in his stead ? Gent. My brother. \u00c6sop. Andthegeneral.whywould youhanghim? Gent. Because he took ne'er a town last cam- paign. \u00c6sop. And how do you know 'twas in his power ? Gent. Why I don't care a souse whether it was in his power or not. But I have a son at home, a brave chopping lad ; he's been captain in the mi litia these twelve months, and I'd be glad to see him in his place. What do ye stare for, sir ? ha !

Allowances in all professions there must be, since 'tis weak man that is the weak professor. Believe me, senator, for I have seen the proof on't ; the longest beard amongst us is a fool. Could you but stand behind the curtain, and there observe the secret springs of state, you'd see in all the good or evil that attends it, ten ounces of chance for one grain either of wisdom or roguery. You'd see, perhaps, a venerable statesman Sit fast asleep in a great downy chair ; Whilst in that soft vacation of his thought, Blind chance (or what al least we blindly call so) Shall so dispose a thousand secret wheels, That when he wakes he needs but write his name, To publish to the world some bless'd event, For which his statue shall be raised in brass. Perhaps a moment thence you shall behold him Torturing his brain ; his thoughts all stretch'd upon The rack for public service : the livelong night, When all the world's at rest, Consumed in care, and watching for their safety, When by a whirlwind in his fate, In spite of him some mischief shall befal 'em, For which a furious sentence straight shall pass, And they shall vote him to the scaffold. Even thus uncertain are rewards and punishments ; And even thus little do the people know When 'tis the statesman merits one or t'other. \u00c6sop. In short, sir, I find if you and your family were provided for, things would soon grow better than they do. Gent. And so they would, sir. Clap me at the head of the state, and Numphs at the head of the army ; he with his club-musket, and I with my club-headpiece, we'd soon put an end to your business. \u00c6sop. I believe you would indeed. And there fore since I happen to be acquainted with your extraordinary abilities, I am resolved to give the king an account of you, and employ my interest with him, that you and your son may have the posts you desire. Gent. Will you, by the Lord ?\u2014 Give me your fist, sir\u2014 the only honest courtier that ever I met with in my life. \u00c6sop. But, sir, when I have done you this mighty piece of service, 1 shall have a small request to beg of you, which I hope you won't refuse me. Gent. What's that ? \u00c6sop. Why 'tis in behalf of the two officers who are to be displaced to make room for you and your son. Gent. The secretary and the general ? \u00c6sop. The same. 'Tis pity they should be quite out of business ; I must therefore desire you'll let me recommend one of 'em to you for your bailiff, and t'other for your huntsman. Gent. My bailiff and my huntsman !\u2014 Sir, that's not to be granted. \u00c6sop. Pray, why? Gent. Why! \u2014 because one would ruin my land, and t'other would spoil my fox-hounds. \u00c6sop. Why do you think so ? Gent. Why do I think so ! \u2014 These courtiers will ask the strangest questions ! \u2014 Why, sir, do you think that men bred up to the state and the army, can understand the business of ploughing and hunting ? \u00c6sop. I did not know but they might. Gent. How could you think so ? \u00c6sop. Because I see men bred up to ploughing and hunting, understand the business of the state and the army. Gent. I'm shot \u2014 I ha'nt one word to say for myself \u2014 I never was so caught in my life. \u00c6sop. I perceive, sir, by your looks what I have said has made some impression upon you ; and would perhaps do more if you would give it leave. \u2014 [Taking his hand.] Come, sir, though I am a stranger to you, I can be your friend ; my favour at court does not hinder me from being a lover of my country. 'Tis my nature as well as principles to be pleased with the prosperity of mankind. I wish all things happy, and my study is to make them so. The distempers of the government (which I own are great) have em- ployed the stretch of my understanding, and the deepest of my thoughts, to penetrate the cause, and to find out the remedy. But, alas ! all the product of my study is this: \u2014 that I find there is too near a resemblance between the diseases of the state and those of the body, for the most expert minister to become a greater master in one than the college is in t'other : and how far their skill extends you may see by this lump upon rny Gent. Now I do believe I am beginning to be a wise man ; for I never till now perceived I was a fool. But do you then really believe, sir, our men in business do the best they can ? \u00c6sop. Many of 'em do : some perhaps do not. But this you may depend upon ; he that is out of business is the worst judge in the world of him that is in : first, because he seldom knows anything of the matter: and, secondly, because he always desires to get his place. Gent. And so, sir you turn the tables upon the plantiff, and lay the fool and knave at his door. \u00c6sop. If I do him wrong, I'm sorry for't. Let him examine himself, he'll find whether I do or not. [Exit. Gent. Examine ! \u2014 I think I have had enough of that already. There's nothing left, that I know of, but to give sentence : and truly I think there's no great difficulty in that. A very pretty fellow I am indeed ! Here am I come bellowing and roar ing two hundred miles post to find myself an ass ; when with one quarter of an hour's consideration I might have made the self-same discovery, without going over my threshold. Well ! if ever they send me on their errand to reform the state again, I'll be damned. But this I'll do : I'll go home and reform my family if I can : them I'm sure I know.

[Aside.] An odd fellow this ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Pray, sir, who are you ? Beau. I can't tell. \u00c6sop. What would you do with her ? Beau. Why, I'd take care of her affairs, rid her of all her troubles, her maidenhead, and her portion. \u00c6sop. Do you know who I am ? Beau. No, sir : I'm a favourite at court, and I neither know myself nor anybody else. \u00c6sop. Are you in any employment ? Beau. Yes. \u00c6sop. And pray what sort of wife would you be willing to throw yourself away upon ? Beau. Why, upon one that has youth, beauty, quality, virtue, wit, and money. \u00c6sop. And how may you be qualified your self, to back you in your pretensions to such a one ? \u00c6sop. What is't ? Beau. I don't know the name on't. \u00c6sop. You know the business on't, I hope ? Beau. That I do \u2014 the business of it is \u2014 to \u2014 put in a deputy, and receive the money. \u00c6sop. Pray what may be your name ? Beau. Empty. \u00c6sop. Where do you live ? Beau. In the side-box. \u00c6sop. What do you do there ? Beau. I ogle the ladies. \u00c6sop. To what purpose ? Beau. To no purpose. \u00c6sop. Why then do you do it ? Beau. Because they like it, and I like it. \u00c6sop. Wherein consists the pleasure ? Beau. In playing the fool. \u00c6sop. Pray sir, what age are you' Beau. Five-and-twenty, my body ; my head's about fifteen. Beau. Why, I am qualified with \u2014 a periwig \u2014 a snuffbox \u2014 a feather \u2014 a \u2014 smooth face \u2014 a fool's head \u2014 and a patch. \u00c6sop. But one question more : what settle ments can you make ? Beau Settlements ! \u2014 why, if she be a very great heiress indeed, I believe I may settle \u2014 myself upon her for life, and my pox upon her children for ever. \u00c6sop. 'Tis enough ; you may expect I'll serve you, if it lies in my way. But 1 would not have you rely too much upon your success, because people sometimes are mistaken ; as for example \u2014 An ape there was of nimble parts, A great intruder into hearts, As brisk, and gay, and full of air, As you, or I, or any here ; Rich in his dress, of splendid show. And with a head like any beau : Eternal mirth was in his face ; Where'er he went, He was content, \u00c6sop. Is your father living ? Beau. Dead, thank God. \u00c6sop. Has he been long so ? Beau. Positively yes. \u00c6sop. Where were you brought up ? Beau. At school. \u00c6sop. What school ? Beau. The school of Venus. So Fortune had but kindly sent Some ladies \u2014 and a looking-glass. Encouragement they always gave him, Encouragement to play the fool ; For soon they found it was a tool, Would hardly be so much in love, But that the mumbling of a glove, Or tearing of a fan, would save him. These bounties he accepts as proof Of feats done by his wit and youth . He gives their freedom gone for ever, Concludes each female heart undone, Except that very happy one, To which he'd please to do the favour. In short, so smooth his matters went, He guess'd, where'er his thoughts were bent. The lady he must carry. So put on a fine new cravat, He comb'd his wig, he cock'd his hat, And gave it out he'd marry. But here, alas ! he found to's cost, He had reckon'd long without his host : For wheresoe'er he made the attack, Poor pug with shame was beaten back. The first fair she he had in chace, Was a young cat, extremely rich, Her mother was a noted witch; So had the daughter proved but civil, He had been related to the devil. \u00c6sop. Were you ever at the university ? Beau. Yes. \u00c6sop. What study did you follow there ? Beau. My bedmaker. \u00c6sop. How long did you stay ? Beau. Till I had lost my maidenhead. \u00c6sop. Why did you come away ? Beau Because I was expelled. \u00c6sop. Where did you go then ? Beau. To court. \u00c6sop. Who took care of your education there ? Beau. A whore and a dancing-master. \u00c6sop. What did you gain by them ? Beau. A minuet and the pox. \u00c6sop. Have you an estate ? Beau. I had. \u00c6sop. What's become on't ? Beau. Spent. \u00c6sop. In what ? Beau. In a twelvemonth. \u00c6sop. But how ? Beau. Why, in dressing, drinking, whoring, claps, dice, and scriveners. What do you think of me now, old gentleman ? \u00c6sop.

But prate, and talk, and play the fool. He said 'twas wealth gave joy and mirth, And that to be the dearest wife With that he went among the bitches, Such as had beauty, wit, and riches, And swore Miss Maulken, to her cost, Should quickly see what she had lost : But the poor unlucky swain Miss'd his shepherdess again ; His fate was to miscarry. It was his destiny to find, That cats and dogs are of a mind, When monkeys come to marry.

To gain your favour, we your rules obey, And treat you with a moral piece to-day ; So moral, we're afraid 'twill damn the play. For though ye have long been leagued (as people tell) To reduce the power exorbitant of hell ; No troops you send, to abate it in this field, But leave us still exposed, to starve or yield.

So should not meddle much in your debate. But since your cause is good, thus far we'll go. When Portugal declares, we'll do so too.

Hold, sir, hold ; there's enough in all con science ; I'm reasonable, I ask no more; I'm content. Don John. Then there's double content, you dog, and a brace of contents more into the bargain.

But really, sir, I would advise you to \u2014 Don John. Again ! I can bear thee no longer. Here, pen and ink, I'll give thee thy discharge. Did I take you for a valet, or a privy-counsellor, sir? should disengage in a week. If you live a little longer with me, sirrah, you'll know how to instruct your next master to the purpose : and therefore that I may charitably equip you for a new service, now I'm turning you out of my own, I'll let you know, that when a woman loves a man best, she's in the most hopeful way of betraying him ; for love, like fortune, turns upon a wheel, and is very much given to rising and falling. Lop. Like enough. But as much upon the weathercock as the ladies are, there are some the wind must blow hard to fetch them about. When such a sturdy hussy falls in your honour's way, what account may things turn to then, an't please ye ? Lop. 'Tis confessed, sir, you took me but for humble employment ; but my intention was agree ably to surprise you with some superior gifts of nature, to your faithful slave. J profess, my noble master, a most perfect knowledge of men and man ners. Yours, gracious sir, (with all respect I speak it) are not irreprehensible. And I'm afraid in time, sir, I am indeed, they'll wriggle you into some ill-favoured affair, whence with all my under standing I shall be puzzled to bring you off. Don John. Very well, sir. Lop. And therefore, sir, it is, that I (poor Lopez as I am) sometimes take leave to moralise. Don John. Go, go, moralise in the market-place; I'm quite worn out. Once more, march. Lop. Is the sentence definitive ? Don John. Positive. Don John. They turn to a bottle, you puppy. Lop. I find they'll always turn to something ; but when you pursue a poor woman only to make her lover jealous, what pleasure can you take in that? Don John. That pleasure. Lop. Look you there again ! Don John. Why, sirrah, d'you think there's no pleasure in spoiling their sport, when I can't make my own? Lop. Oh ! to a good-natured man, be sure there must ; but suppose, instead of fending and proving with his mistress, he should come to \u2014 a \u2014 parrying and thrusting with you ; what becomes of your joy then, my noble master ? Don John. Why do you think I'm afraid to fight, you rascal ? Lop. I thought we were talking of what we loved, not what we feared, sir. Lop. Then pray let us come to account, and see what wages are due. Don John. Wages ! Refund what you have had, you rascal you, for the plague you have given me. Lop. Nay, if I must lose my money, then let me claim another right ; losers have leave to speak. Therefore advance, my tongue, and say thy plea sure ; tell this master of mine, he should die with shame at the life he leads : so much unworthy of a man of honour. Tell him \u2014 Don John. I'll hear no more. Don John. Sir, I love everything that leads to what I love most. Lop. You shall indeed, sir. Don John. Here, take thy money and begone. Lop.

Don John. Very well. Lop. It is indeed, sir, and so are the stories you tell them to bring them to your matters. The handsome, she's all divinity to be sure ; the ugly, she's so agreeable, were it not for her virtue, she'd be overrun with lovers ; the light airy fiipflap, she kills him with her motions ; the dull heavy-tailed maukin melts him down with her modesty ; the scragged lean pale face has a shape for destruction ; the fat overgrown sow has an air of importance ; the tall awkward trapes with her majesty wounds ; tbe little short trundle-tail shoots a je-ne-sais-quoi: iu a word, they have all something for him \u2014 and he has something for 'em all.

Lop. He's a very dull fellow indeed. [Aside. Don Guz. In the meanwhile the object of my vows is a sharer in my grief, and the only cordial we have is the pleasure of a secret conversation, through a small breach I have made in a thin par tition that divides our lodgings. I trust you, Don John, with this important secret ; friend or enemy, you are noble, therefore keep it, I charge your honour with it. Don John. I was afraid he came to forbid me seeing his sister Isabella, with whom I'm upon very good terms. Lop. Why now that's a hard case, when you have got a man's sister, you can't leave him his mistress. Don John. No, changeling, I hate him enough, to love every woman that belongs to him ; and the fool has so provoked me by his threatening, that I believe I shall have a stroke at his mother before I think myself even with him.

About two months since, my father writ to me from Toledo, that he was going to marry me very advantageously at Valencia. He sent me the picture of the lady, and I was so well pleased with it, that I immediately got my conge, and embarked at Dunkirk ; I had a quick passage to the Groyne, from whence, by the way of Madrid, I am come hither with all the speed I could. I have, you must know, been two days in town, but I have lain incognito, that I might inform myself of the lady's conduct I'm to marry ; and I have discovered that she's served by two cavaliers of birth and merit. But though they have both given many proofs of a most violent passion, I have found for the quiet of my honour that this virtuous lady, out of modesty or prudence, has shown a perfect indifference to them and their gallantries ; her fortune is considerable, her birth is high, her manners irreproachable, and her beauty so great, that nothing but my love can equal it.

I have hearkened to you, Den Pedro, with a great deal of attention, and Heaven's my witness 1 have a mighty joy in seeing you ; but the devil fetch me, it makes my heart bleed to hear you are going to be married. Don Ped. Say no more of that, I desire you, we have always been friends, and I earnestly beg we ever may be so ; but I am not come to ask counsel about my marriage, my party is taken, and my inquiries have so much heightened my desire, that nothing can henceforth abate it. I must therefore expect from yon, dear friend, that you won't oppose it, but that you'll aid me in hastening the moment of my happiness. Don John. Since 'tis so impossible for you to resolve for your own good, I must submit to what you'll have me. But are not we to know the name of this piece of rarity, that is to do you this good turn ? Lop. With all my heart \u2014 [Aside.] It's at least a suspension of boxes o' th' ear, and kicks o' the backside. Don Ped. Then, honest Lopez, with your mas ter's leave, go to the new inn, the King of France on horseback, and see if my servant's returned ; I'll be there immediately, to charge thee with a com mission of more importance. Lop. I shall perform your orders, sir, both to your satisfaction and my own reputation. [Exit. Don John. Very quaint. \u2014 Well, old acquaint ance, we are going to be married then ? 'Tis re solved : ha! Don Ped. So says my star. Don John. The foolishest star that has said any thing a great while. Don Ped. Still the same, I see ! or, more than ever, resolved to love nothing. Don John. Love nothing ! why, I'm in love at this very time. Don Ped. With what ? Don John. A woman. Don Ped. Impossible! Don John. True. Don Ped. And how came you in love with her? Don John. Why I was ordered not to be in love with her. Don Ped. Then there's more humour than love in't. Don John. There shall be what you please in't : but I shan't quit the gentlewoman till I have con vinced her there's something in't. Don Ped. Mayn't I know her name? Don John. When you have let me into your conjugal affection. Don Ped. Pray stay here but till I have sent Lopez to my father-in-law : I'll eome back and carry you with me in a moment. Don John. I'll expect you. Don Ped. Adieu, dear friend ; may I in earnest see you quickly in love. Don John. May I, without a jest, see you quickly a widower. \u2014 [Exit Don Pedro.] He comes, he says, to marry a woman of quality that has two lovers. \u2014 If it should be Leonora? \u2014 But why she ? There are many, I hope, in that condition in Valencia. \u2014 I'm a little embarrassed about it, how ever. \u2014 Don Ped. You'll know it presently ; for I'm going to carry you to her house. Don John. You shall tell me at least who are her two gallants. Don Ped. One, they could not tell me his name; t'other is \u2014 But before we talk any more of these affairs, can you let me dispose of Lopez till the return of a servant I sent three days ago to \u2014 Friendship, take heed ; if woman interfere, Be sure the hour of thy destruction's near.

Our houses join, and when he looks at my window, you fancy 'tis at yours. Leo. But when he attacks my door, madam, and almost breaks it down, I don't know how in the world to fancy 'tis yours. Enter Leonora, Isabella, and Jacinta. Leo. Dear Isabella, come in. How I am plagued with this troublesome wretch ! \u2014 Jacinta, have you shut the outward gates ? Jac. I have, madam. Isab. A man may do that to disguise his real Leo. Shut the window too ; we shall have him get in there by and by. inclination. Leo. Nay, if you please, believe he's dying for you. I wish he were ; then I should be troubled no more with him. \u2014 Be sure, Jacinta, you don't open a window to-night. Isab. Not while I'm here at least ; for if he knows that, he may chance to press in. Leo. Look you, Isabella, 'tis entirely alike to me who he's fond of ; but I'm so much your friend. I can't endure to see you deceived. Isab. And since I have the same kindness for you, Leonora, know in short, that my brother is so alarmed at his passion for me, that he has forbid him the street. Isab. What's this you are in such apprehensions of, pray ? Leo. Nothing worth naming. Isab. You dissemble : something of love in the case, I'll warrant you. Leo. The reverse on't ; 'tis aversion. My imper tinent star has furnished me with a lover for my guard, who is never from my window ; he perse cutes me to distraction ; I affront him fifty times a-day, which he receives with a bow down to the ground : in short, all I can do is doing nothing at all : he still persists in loving me, as much as I hate him. Leo. Bless my soul ! and don't you plainly see by that he's jealous of him upon my account? Isab. [Smiling.] He's jealous of his honour, madam, lest he should debauch his sister. Isab. Have a care he don't get the better on't, for all that ; for when a man loves a woman well enough to persevere, 'tis odds but she at last loves him well enough to make him give it over. But I think I had as good take off my scarf ; for since my brother Don Guzman knows I'm with you, he won't quarrel at my return for the length of my visit. Leo. I say, he's jealous of his love, lest he should corrupt his mistress. Isab. But why all this heat ? If you love my brother, why are you concerned Don John should love me ? Leo. I'm not concerned ; I have no designs upon him, I care not who he loves. Leo. If he should, I should quarrel with him, which few things else would make me do. But methinks, Isabella, you are a little melancholy. Isab. And you a little thoughtful. Leo. Pray tell me your affliction. Isab. Pray don't conceal yours. Leo. Why truly, my heart is not at ease. Isab. Mine, I fear, never will. Leo. My father's marrying me against my incli nation. Isab. Why then are you angry ? Leo. Why do you say he does not care for me ? Isab. Well, to content you then, I know nothing certain but that 1 love him. Leo. And to content yon, I know nothing so certain, as that I neither love him, nor never can love him. And so I hope we are friends again. Isab. Kiss me then, and let us never be other wise. Isab. My brother is hindering me from marrying with mine. Leo. Agreed. \u2014 [They kiss.] And now my dear, as my misfortune's nearest, I am first to be pitied. I am the most wretched woman living. My father every moment expects a gentleman from Flanders, to whom he has resolved to marry me. But neither duty, nor prudence, nor danger, nor resolution, nor all I can summon to my aid, can drive your brother from my heart ; but there he's fixed to ruin me. Jac. Madam, here's Don Guzman at the cham ber-door ; he begs so passionately to come in, sure you can't refuse him. Leo. Heavens ! but does he consider to what he exposes me ? Leo. You know I love your brother, Don Guz man. Isab. And you shall know, I'm uneasy for Don John de Alvarada. Leo. Don John! Isab. The same. Leo. Have you any reason to hope for a return ? Isab. I think so. Leo. I'm afraid, my dear, you abuse yourself. Isab. Why ? Leo. Because he is already in love with \u2014 Isab. Who ? Jac. Madam, he considers nothing ; if he did, I'd say he were an impudent fellow to pretend to be in love with you. Leo. Shall I venture, Isabella ? Leo. Me. Isab. I would not have you too positive in that, madam, for I am very sure that \u2014 Leo. Madam, I am very sure that he's the trou blesome guest I just now complained of: and you may believe \u2014 Isab. Madam, I can never believe he's trouble some to anybody. Leo. O dear madam ! But I'm sure I'm forced to keep my windows shut till I'm almost dead with heat, and that I think is troublesome. Isab. You know best. Enter Don Guzman. Jac. Marry, methinks he knows best of us all, for here he comes. Don Guz. Forgive me, lovely Leonora ; 'tis the last time perhaps that I may beg your pity.

Don Guzman ! turned fellow. \u2014 [Aside.] He'll set all to rights by to-morrow morning, I'll answer for him. Don Fel. Don Pedro, you are welcome ; let me embrace you. Don Ped. In what terms, sir, shall I express what I owe you for the honour you do me ? and with what prospect of return can I receive this inestimable present ? \u2014 Your picture, madam, made what impression art could stamp, but nature has done more.

Has he seen Don Guzman ? Don Fel. Come son, (for I'm in haste to call you so) \u2014 but what's this I see ? Alvarada here ! Whence, sir, this insolence ; to come within my doors after you know what has passed ? Who brought you here ? Don Ped. 'Twas I, sir. Jac. Nay, the deuse knows. Isab. Where shall he hide himself ?

Don John. Keep down, my kindling jealousy : I've something tortures me I never felt till now. [Aside. Don Guz. I see your surprise, sir, but you need not be disturbed ; 'twas some sudden business with my sister brought me here.' Don Fel. 'Tis enough, sir : I'm glad to find you here ; you shall be a witness that I know how to preserve the honour of my family. Don Guz. What mean you, sir ? Don Fel. To marry Leonora this moment. Don Guz. How say you ? Don Fel. I say you shall have nothing left to ask of me. Don Ped. [ To Leonora.] Why this backward ness, madam ? Where a father chooses, a daughter may with modesty approve. Pray give me your hand. Don Guz. Is't possible ? O Heavens ! what joy I feel. Don Fel. Leonora, prepare your hand and heart. Leo. They both are ready, sir ; and in giving me the man I love, you charge me with a debt of gratitude can never be repaid. Don Guz.

I'm much alarmed. [Aside. Jac. Now methinks he looks like an old rogue ; I don't like his looks. [Aside. Don Fel. [ To Leonora. ] Repair what you have done, and look more cheerful on him. Enter Lopez. Lop. To all whom it may concern, greeting. Don Pedro Osorio acknowledging himself most unworthy of the honour intended him, in the per son of the fair Leonora, addresses himself (by me his small ambassador) to the generosity of Don Felix, for leave to walk in and take possession.

Have all the assurance man can have ; Y'ou'll, as you ought, discharge it. Don John. A very hopeful business you would have me undertake \u2014 keep a woman honest ! Udsdeath ! I'd as soon undertake to keep Porto carero honest. Look you, we are friends, intimate friends ; \u2014 you must not be angry if I talk freely. Women are naturally bent to mischief, and their actions run in one continued torrent till they die. But the less a torrent's checked, the less mischief it does ; let it alone, perhaps, 'twill only kiss the banks and pass ; but stop it, 'tis insatiable. Don Ped. I would not stop it ; but could I gently turn its course where it might run, And vent itself with innocence, I would. Leonora of herself is virtuous ; Her birth, religion, modesty, and sense, Will guide her wishes where they ought to point. \u2014 But yet let guards be what they will, That place is safest that is ne'er attack'd. Don John. As far as I can serve you, in hinder ing Guzman's approaches, you may command me. Don Ped. That's all I ask. Don John. What, already ? Don Ped. Already. Don John. That's to say, you have already enough of matrimony. Don Ped. I scarce know what I have, nor am I sure of what I am. Re-enter LorEZ. Lop. [To Don Pedro.] An't please your honour, yonder's your man Bertrand just arrived ; his horse and he so tired of one another, that they both came down upon the pavement at the stable-door. Don Ped. [To Don John.] He brings news from my father. Lop. I believe he does, and hasty news too ; but if you stay till he brings it hither, I believe it will come but slowly. But here's his packet ; I suppose that will do as well as his company. [Gives a letter. Don Ped. [Reads to himself.] My dear friend, here's ill news. Don John. Then all you ask is granted. Don Ped, I am at ease ; farewell ! D'>n John. Heaven bring you safe to us again ! \u2014 [Exit Don Pedro.] Yes, I shall observe her, doubt it not. I wish nobody may observe me ; for I find I'm no more master of myself. Don Guz man's passion for her adds to mine ; but when I think on what Don Pedro'll reap, I'm fire and flame ! Something must be done ; what, let love direct, for I have nothing else to guide me. Don John. What's the matter ? Don Ped. My poor old father's dying. Don John. I'm mighty sorry for't ; 'tis a weighty stroke I must confess ; the burden of his estate will almost bear you down. But we must submit to Heaven's good will. Don Ped. You talk, Alvarada, like a perfect stranger to that tenderness methinks every son should feel for a good father. For my part, I've received such repeated proofs of an uncommon affection from mine, that the loss of a mistress could scarce touch me nearer. You'll believe me, when you see me leave Leonora a virgin till I have seen the good old man. Don John. That will be a proof indeed ; Hea ven's blessing must needs fall upon so dutiful a son ; but I don't know how its judgments may deal with so indifferent a lover. Re-enter Lopez. Lop. [Aside.] Don Pedro is mounting for his journey, and leaves a young, warm, liquorish hussy, with a watery mouth, behind him. \u2014 Hum ! if she falls handsomely in my master's way, let her look to her 'st \u2014 there he is. Doing what ?\u2014think ing ? That's new ; and if any good comes on't, that will be newer still. Don John. [Aside.] How i abuse the trust a friend reposes in me ? and while he thinks me waking for his peace, employ the stretch of thought to make him wretched ? Don Ped. Oh, I shall have time enough to repair this seeming small neglect. But before I go, pray a word or two with you alone. \u2014 Lopez, wait without. \u2014 [Exit Lopez.] You see, my dear est friend, I am engaged with Leonora \u2014 perhaps I have done wrong ; but 'tis gone too far to talk or think of a retreat ; I shall go directly from this place to the altar, and there seal the eternal con tract. That done, I'll take post to see my father, if I can, before he dies. I leave then here a young and beauteous bride ; But that which touches every string of thought, I fear, I leave her wishing I were Guzman. If it be so, no doubt he knows it well ; And he that knows he's loved by Leonora, Can let no fair occasion pass to gain her : My absence is his friend, but you are mine, And so the danger's balanced. Into your hands, My dear, my faithful Alvarada\u2014 [Embracing him] I put ray honour, I put my life ; For both depend on Leonora's truth. Observe her lover, and \u2014 neglect not her.

Well, and I swore I was his. Why then, if 1 find I can break my oath, why should not I conclude he would do as much by his ? Lop. [Aside.] His countenance begins to clear up : I suppose things may be drawing to a con clusion. Don John. [Aside.] Ay, 'tis just so; and I don't believe he would have debated the matter half so long as I have done : egad, I think I have put myself to a great expense of morality about it. I'm sure, at least, my stock's out : but I have a fund of love, I hope, may last a little longer. \u2014 [Observing Lopez.] Oh, are you there, sir? Lop.

Don Fel. Pray what's the matter 2 You surprise me. Don Ped. The occasion of my delay presses you, I fear, much more ; you count the tedious minutes I am with you, and are reduced to mind me of my duty to free yourself from my sight. Leo. You urge this thing too far, and do me wrong. The sentiments I have for you are much more favourable than your jealousy suffers 'em to appear. But if my heart has seemed to lean an other way, before you had a title to it, you ought not to conclude I shall suffer it to do so long. Don Ped. I know you have virtue, gratitude, and truth ; ' And therefore 'tis I love you to my ruin. Could I believe you false, contempt would soon Release me from my chains, which yet I can't But wish to wear for ever ; therefore, Indulge at least your pity to your slave, 'Tis the soft path in which we tread to love. I leave behind a tortured heart to move you : \u2014 Weigh well its pains, think on its passion too, Remember all its torments spring from you ; And if you cannot love, at least be true. [Exit. Jac. Now, by my troth, madam, I am ready to cry. He's a pretty fellow, and deserves better luck. Leo. I own he does : and his behaviour would engage anything that were unengaged. But, alas! I want his pity more than he does mine. Jac. You do ! Now, I'm of another mind. The moment he sees your picture he's in love with you ; the moment he's in love with you, he embarks ; and, like lightning, in a moment more he's here : where you are pleased to receive him with a Don Guzman, I am yours ! Ah, poor man ! Leo. I own, Jacinta, he's unfortunate, but still I say my fate is harder yet. The irresistible pas sion I have for Guzman renders Don Pedro, with all his merit, odious to me ; yet I must in his favour make eternal war against the strength of inclination and the man I love. Don Ped. This letter, sir, will inform you. Don Fel. [Reads.] My dear son, Bertrand has brought me the welcome news of your return, and has given me your letter ; which has in some sort revived my spirits in the extremity I am. I daily expect my exit from this world. ' Tis now six years since I have seen you ; I should be glad to do it once again before I die. If you will give me that satisfaction, you must be speedy. Heaven preserve you ! \u2014 'Tis enough. The occasion I'm sorry for, but since the ties of blood and gratitude oblige you, far be it from me to hinder you. Fare well, my. sou ! may you have a happy journey, and if it be Heaven's will, may the sight of so good a son revive so kind a father ! I leave you to bid your wife adieu. [Exit. Don Ped. I must leave you, my lovely bride ; With bitter pangs of separation. [but 'tis Had I your heart to cheer me on my way, I might, with such a cordial, run my course : But that support you want the power to give me. Leo. Who tells you so ? Don Ped. My eyes and ears, and all the pains I bear. Leo. When eyes and ears are much indulged, Like favourite servants, they are apt to abuse The too much trust their master places in 'em. Don Ped. If I am abused, Assist me with some fair interpretation Of all that present trouble and disquiet, Which is not in my power to overlook, Nor yours to hide. Leo. You might, methinks, have spared My modesty ; and, without forcing me To name your absence, have laid my trouble there. Don Ped. No, no, my fair deluder, that's a veil Too thin to cover what's so hard to hide ; My presence, not my absence, is the cause. Your cold reception at my first approach, Prepared me for the stroke ; and 'twas not long Before your mouth confirmed my doom : Don Guz- man, I am yours ! Leo. Is't, then, impossible the mouth should utter one name for another ? Jac. [Aside.] Um \u2014 If I were in her case, I could find an expedient for all this matter. But she makes such a bustle with her virtue, I dare not propose it to her. Leo. Besides, Don Pedro possesses what he loves, but I must never think on poor Don Guz man more. [ Weeping. Jac. Poor Don Guzman, indeed! We han't said a word of the pickle he's in yet. Hark ! somebody knocks \u2014 at the old rendezvous. It's he, on my conscience. Leo.

Don John. Now begone. Lop. What ! shut the door first, and then be gone ? Now, methinks, I might as well have gone first, and then shut the door. Jac. O dear heart ! is't you ? Lop. Charming Jacinta ! fear me not. Jac. [Aside.] O ho ! he begins to talk soft \u2014 then let us take upon us again. Lop. Cruel Jacinta, whose mouth (small as it is) has made but one morsel of my heart. Jac. [Aside.] It's well he prevents me. I was going to leap about the rascal's neck. Lop. Barbare Jacinta, cast your eyes On your poor Lopez, ere he dies. Jac. [Aside.] Poetry too ! Nay then I have done his business. Don John. I bid you begone, you dog you ! do you find the way. Lop. [Aside.] Stark mad, and always so when a woman's in chase. \u2014 [Aloud.] But, sir, will you keep your chief minister out of the secrets of your state ? Pray let me know what this night's work is to be. Lop. Feel how I burn with hot desire, Ah ! pity me, and quench my fire ; Deaf, my fair tyrant, deaf to my woes, Nay then, barbarian, in it goes. [Drawing a knife. Jac. Why how now, Jack-sauce ? why how now, Presumption ? What encouragement have I given you, Jack-a-lent, to attack me with your tenders? I could tear your eyes out, sirrah, for thinking I am such a one. What indecency have you seen in my behaviour, impudence, that you should think me for your beastly turn, you goat you ? Lop. Patience, my much offended goddess, 'tis honourably I would share your bed. Jac. Peace, I say \u2014 Mr. Liquorish. I, for whom the most successful cavaliers employ their sighs in vain, shall I look down upon a crawling worm ? Pha ! \u2014 see that crop-ear there, that vermin, that wants to eat at a table would set his master's mouth a watering ! Don John. No questions, but march. Lop. Very well. \u2014 [Goes to the door, and returns.] But, sir, shall I stay for you in the street ? Don John. No, nor stir out of the house. Lop. So. Well, sir, I'll do just as you have ordered me ; I'll be gone, and I'll stay ; and I'll march, and I won't stir, and \u2014 just as you say, sir. Don John. I see you are afraid, you rascal you. Lop. Passably. Don John. Well, be it so ; but you shan't leave the house, sir ; therefore begone to your hogstye, and wait further orders. Lop. [Aside] But first I'll know how you intend to dispose of yourself. [Conceals himself behind the door. Don John. All's hush and still ; and I am at the point of being a happy \u2014 villain. That though comes uninvited : \u2014 then like an uninvited guest let it be treated : begone, intruder ! Leonora's charms turn vice to virtue, treason into truth ; nature, who has made her the supreme object of our desires, must needs have designed her the regulator of our morals. Whatever points at her, is pointed right. We are all her due, mankind's the dower which heaven has settled on her ; and he's the villain that would rob her of her tribute. I there fore, as in duty bound, will in, and pay her mine. Lop. [Aside.] There he goes, i'faith ; he seemed as if he had a qualm just now ; but he never goes without a dram ef conscience-water about him, to set matters right again. Don John. This is her door, 'tis locked ; but I have a smith about me will make her staple fly. [Pulls out some irons, and forces the lock. Lop. [Aside.] Hark! hark! if he is not equip ped for a housebreaker too. Very well, he has provided two strings to his bow ; if he 'scapes the rape, he may be hanged upon the burglary. Don John. There, 'tis done. So. \u2014 No watch light burning ? \u2014 [Peeping into her chamber.] All in darkness ? so much the better, 'twill save a great deal of blushing on both sides. Methinks I feel myself mighty modest, I tremble too ; that's not proper at this time. Be firm, my courage, I have business for thee. \u2014 So \u2014 how am I now ? \u2014 pretty well. Then by your leave, Don Pedro, I must supply your neglect. You should not have married till you were ready for consummation ; a maidenhead ought no more to lie upon a hand some bride, than an impeachment upon an inno cent minister. [Exit into the chamber. Lop. May I presume to make an humble meal upon what savoury remnants he may leave ? Jac. No. Lop. 'Tis hard ! 'tis wondrous hard ! Jac. Leave me. Lop. 'Tis pitiful, 'tis wondrous pitiful ! Jac. Begone ! I say Thus ladies 'tis, perhaps, sometimes with you ; With scorn you fly the thing which you pursue. [Aside. \u2014 Exit. Lop. 'Tis very well, Mrs. Flipflap, 'tis very well ; but do you hear \u2014 Tawdry, you are not so alluring as you think you are \u2014 Comb-brush, nor I so much in love ! \u2014 your maidenhead may chance to grow mouldy with your airs; \u2014 the pox be your bedfellow! there's that for you. \u2014 Come, let's think no more on't, sailors must meet with storms ; my master's going to sea too. He may chance to fare no better with the lady than I have done with her Abigail : there may be foul weather there too. I reckon at present he may be lying by under a mizen at the street-door, I think it rains too for his comfort. What if I should leave him there an hour or two in fresco, and try to work off the amour that way? No ; people will be physicked their own way. But perhaps I might save his life by't \u2014 yes, and have my bones broke for being so officious ; therefore, if you are at the door, Don John, walk in and take your fortune. [Opens the door. Enter Don John. Don John. Hist ! hist ! Lop. Hist ! hist ! Lop. [Coming forwards.] Well done, well done ; Gad a-marcy, my little Judas ! Unfortunate Don Pedro ! thou hast left thy purse in the hands of a robber; and while thou art galloping to pay the last duty to thy father, he's at least upon the trot to pay the first to thy wife.

But hark ! \u2014 now I hear \u2014 nothing ; she does not say a word ; she sleeps curiously. \u2014 How if she should take it all for a dream now ? or her virtue should be fallen into an apoplex ? \u2014 Where the pox will all this end ? Don Ped. [Aside. ] Naked ! and thus attended at the dead of night ! \u2014 my soul is froze at what I see. Confusion sits in all their faces, and in large characters I read the ruin of my honour and my love.\u2014 [Aloud.] Speak, statues, if you yet have power to speak, why at this time of night you are found with Leonora ? \u2014 None speak ! \u2014 Don John, it is from you I ought to know. Don John. My silence may inform you. Don Ped. Your silence does inform me of my shame, but I must have some information more ; explain the whole. Don John. I shall. You remember, Don Pedro\u2014 Don Ped. Be quick. Don John. You remember you charged me before you went \u2014 Don Ped. I remember well, go on. Don John. With the care of your honour. Don Ped. I did : despatch. Don John. Very well ; you see Don Guzman in this apartment, you see your wife naked, and you see me, my sword in my hand ; that's all. Don Ped. [Drawing upon Don Guzman.] 'Tis here then I am to revenge my wrongs. Don Guz. Hold ! Leo. [ Within.] Jacinta ! Beatrix ! Fernandes ! Murder ! murder ! help ! help ! help ! Lop. Now the play begins ; it opens finely. Leo. [Within.] Father! Alphonso! Save me ! 0 save me ! Leo. Comedy or tragedy for a ducat ! for fear of the latter, decamp Lopez. [Exit. SCENE III.\u2014 Leonora's Bedchamber. Leonora discovered in a gown, holding Don John by the sleeve. Leo. Whoever you are, villain, you shan't escape me ; and though your efforts have been in vain, you shan't fail to receive the recompense of your attempt. \u2014 Help, ho, help there ! help ! [Don John breaks from her, but can't find the door. Don John. [Aside.] 'Sdeath, I shall be un done ! where is this damned door ? Don Ped. Villain, defend thyself ! Leo. O Heaven ! Don Guz. Yet hear me. Don Ped. What canst thou say ? Don Guz. The truth, as holy Heaven itself is truth. I heard the shrieks and cries of Leonora ; what the occasion was I knew not, but she repeated 'em with so much vehemence, I found, whatever her distress might be, her succour must be sudden ; so leaped the wall that parts our houses, and flew to her assistance. Don John can, if he please, inform you more. Don Ped. [Aside.] Mankind's a villain, and this may be true ; Yet 'tis too monstrous for a quick conception. I should be cautious how I wrong Don John. Sure 'tis not right to balance. I yet have but their words against their words ; I know Don John for my friend, and Guzman for my rival. What can be clearer ? Yet hold : if Leonora's innocent, she may untangle all. \u2014 [Aloud.] Madam, I should be glad to know (if I have so much interest left) which way your evi dence will point my sword ? Leo. My lord, I'm in the same perplexity with you. All I can say is this, one of 'em came to force me, t'other to save me : but the night con founding the villany of the guilty with the gene rosity of the innocent, I still am ignorant to which I owe my gratitude or my resentment. Don Guz. But, madam, did you not hear me cry I came to help you ? Leo. I own it. Leo. He'll get away : a light there, quickly ! Enter Don Guzman with kis sword drawn. Don Guz. Where are you, fair angel? I come to lose my life in your defence. Don John. [Aside. ] That's Guzman's voice; the devil has sent him. But we are still in the dark ; I have one tour yet, impudence be my aid. \u2014 [Aloud.] Lights there, ho ! Where is the villain that durst attempt the virtuous Leonora ? Don Guz. His life shall make her satisfaction. Don John. Or mine shall fall in his pursuit. Don Guz. 'Tis by my hands that she shall see him die. Don John. My sword shall lay him bleeding at her feet. Leo. [Aside.] What can this mean ? But here's lights at last, thank the just bounteous heaven. Don John. Enter with the light there ; but secure the door, lest the traitor 'scape my ven geance. Enter Don Pedro with a light, lie finds Leonora between them ; both their swords drawn. Leo. O Heavens ! what is't I see ? Don John. Don Pedro here ! Don Ped. [Aside.] What monstrous scene is this! Don John. And did you not hear me threaten to destroy the author of your fears ? Leo. I can't deny it. Don Guz. What can there be more to clear me? Don Guz. [Aside.] What accident has brought him here ? Don John. [Aside.] Now I am intrigued indeed. [Don Pedro steps back, and shuts the door. Don John. Or me ? Don Ped. Y'et one's a villain still. \u2014 [Aside.] My confusion but increases : yet why confused ? It is, it must be Guzman. But how came Don John here? Right. Guzman has said how he came to her aid, but Alvarada could not enter but by treason. \u2014 [Aloud.] Then perish \u2014 Don Ped. [Aside.] This mystery must unfold before we part. What torments has my fate pro vided me ? Is this the comfort I'm to reap, to dry ray tears for my poor father's death ? \u2014 [Aloud.] Ah, Leonora! Leo. [Aside.] Alas ! where will this end! Don Guz. Who ' [Falling into a chair."], [500, "THE FALSE FRIEND. ACT IV. 406 Don Guz. I obey you ; but I'll lose my life, or show my innocence. [Exit. Don Fel. [ Within.] Open the door ; why am I kept out ? Don Ped. Don John, follow me by this back way. \u2014 And you, Leonora, retire. [Exit Leonora. Don John. [Aside.] If Don Guzman's throat were cut, would not this bustle end ? \u2014 Yes. \u2014 Why, then, if his throat be not cut, may this bustle end me. [Exeunt Don John. Who ? Don Ped. Just gods ! instruct me who. [Knocking at the door. Don Fel. [ Within.] Let me in, open the door ! Leo. 'Tis my father. Don Ped. No matter, keep the door fast. \u2014 [Aside.] I'll have this matter go no further, till I can reach the depth on't. \u2014 [Aloud.] Don Guzman, leave the house ; I must suspend my vengeance for a time. ACT IV. thought of her being given up to another made your passion flame out like mount _tna. That upon this your love got the bridle in his teeth, and ran away with you into her chamber, where that impertinent spy upon her and you, Don John, followed, and prevented farther proofs of your affection. SCENE I. \u2014 A Room in Don Guzman's House. Enter Don Guzman and Galtndo. Don Guz. [Musing.] Galindo ! Gal. Sir ! Don Guz. Try if you can see Jacinta ; let her privately know I would fain speak with her. Gal. It shall be done, sir. [Exit. Don Guz. Sure villany and impudence were never on the stretch before ! This traitor has racked 'em till they crack. To what a plunge the villain's tour has brought me ! Pedro's resent ment must at last be pointed here. But that's a trifle; had he not ruined me with Leonora, I easily had passed him by the rest. \u2014 What's to be done ? Which way shall I convince her of my innocence ? The blood of him who has dared declare me guilty, may satisfy my vengeance, but not aid my love. No, I'm lost with her for ever \u2014 Don Guz. Why sure \u2014 Jac. Why sure, thus I thought it was, and thus she thinks it is. If you have a mind in the depth of your discretion to convince her of your innocence \u2014 may your innocence be your reward. I'm sure were I in her place, you should never have any other from me. Don Guz. Was there then no merit in flying to her assistance when I heard her cries ? Jac. As much as the constable and the watch might have pretended to \u2014 something to drink. Don Guz. This is all raillery; 'tis impossible she can be pleased with such an attempt. Jac. 'Tis impossible she can be pleased with being reduced to make the attempt upon you. Don Guz. But was this a proper way to save her blushes ? Enter Jacinta. Speak, is't not so, Jacinta ? Am I not ruin'd with the virtuous Leonora ? Jac. One of you, I suppose, is. Don Guz. Which dost thou think ? Jac. 'Twas in the dark, that's one way. Don Guz. But it must look like downright violation. Jac. Why, he that came to spoil all ; who should it be? Don Guz. Prithee be serious with me if thou canst for one small moment, and advise me which way I shall take to convince her of my innocence, that it was I that came to do her service ? Jac. If it did not feel like it, what did that sig nify ? Come, sir, waggery apart, you know I'm your servant, I have given you proofs on't. There fore don't distrust me now if I tell you, this quar rel may be made up with the wife, though perhaps not with the husband. In short, she thinks you were first in her chamber, and has not the worse opinion of you for it ; she makes allowance for your sufferings, and has still love enough for you, not to be displeased with the utmost proofs you can give, that you have still a warm remain for her. Don Guz. If this be true, and that she thought 'twas me, why did she cry out to expose me ? Jac. Because at that time she did not think 'twas you. Will that content you ? And now she does think 'twas you, your business is to let her think so on ; for in a word, I can see she's concerned at the danger she has brought you into, and I believe would be heartily glad to see you well out on't. Don Guz. 'Tis impossible she can forgive me. Jac. Oons ! \u2014 Now Heaven forgive me, for I had a great oath upon the very tip of my tongue ; you'd make one mad with your impossibles, and your innocence, and your humilities. 'Sdeath, sir, d'you think a woman makes no distinction between the assaults of a man she likes and one she don't ? My lady hates Don John, and if she thought 'twas Jac. Why you both came to do her service, did not you ? Don Guz. Still trifling? Jac. No, by my troth, not I ! Don Guz. Then turn thy thoughts to ease me in my torment, and be my faithful witness to her, That Heaven and Hell and all their wrath I impre cate, if ever once I knew one fleeting thought, that durst propose to me so impious an attempt. No, Jacinta, I love her well ; but love with that humi lity, whatever misery I feel, My torture ne'er shall urge me on to seize, More than her bounty gives me leave to take. Jac. And the murrain take such a lover and his humility both, say I. Why sure, sir, you are not in earnest in this story, are you ? Don Guz. Why dost thou question it ? Jac. Because I really and seriously thought you innocent. Don Guz. Innocent ! what dost thou mean ? Jac. Mean ! why what should I mean ? I mean that I concluded you loved my lady to that degree you could not live without her : and that the"], [501, "THE FALSE FRIEND. SCENE II. 407 he had done this job, she'd hang him for't in her own garters ; she likes you, and if you should do such another, you might still die in your bed like a bishop for ber. Don Guz. Well, I'll dispute no farther. I put myself into thy hands. What am I to do next ? Jac. Why, do as she bids you ; be in the way at the old rendezvous, she'll take the first occasion she can to speak to you ; and when you meet, do as I bid you, and instead of your innocent and humble, be guilty and resolute. Your mistress is now married, sir, consider that. She has changed her situation, and so must you your battery. At tack a maid gently, a wife warmly, and be as rug ged with a widow as you can. Good bye t'ye, sir. [Exeunt severally. Don Ped. One was come to force her, t'other to rescue her. Don Fel. Which was the criminal ? Don Ped. Of that I yet am ignorant. They accuse each other. Don Fel. Can't your wife determine it ? Don Ped. The darkness of the night put it out of her power. Don Fel. But I perhaps may bring some light I have part in the affront : [to aid you. And though my arm's too old and weak to serve you, My counsel may be useful to your vengeance. Know then, that Don Guzman has a long time pursued my daughter ; and I as resolutely refused his suit : which however has not hindered him from searching all occasions to see and speak to her. Don John, on his side \u2014 SCENE II. \u2014 Leonora's Apartment. Don Ped. Don John's my friend, and I am confident \u2014 Enter Don Pedro. Don Fel. That confidence destroys you. Hear my charge, and be yourself his judge. He too has been a pressing suitor to my daughter. Don Ped. Impossible ! Don Fel. To me myself, he has owned his love to her. Don Ped. In what distraction have I pass'd this night ! Sure I shall never close my eyes again. No rack can equal what I feel. Wounded in both my honour and my love ; They have pierced me in two tender parts. Yet could I take my just revenge, It would in some degree assuage my smart. Oh, guide me Heaven to that cordial drop ! \u2014 Hold ! a glance of light I think begins to \u2014 yes \u2014 right. When yesterday I brought Don John hither, was not Don Felix much disturbed ? \u2014 He was. And why ? \u2014 That may be worth inquiring. But some thing more occurs. At my arrival in this city, Was I not told two cavaliers were warm Don Ped. Good gods ! Yet still this leaves the mystery where it was ; this charge is equal. Don Fel. 'Tis true ; but yonder's one (if you can make her speak) I have reason to believe can tell us more. \u2014 Ho, Jacinta ! Enter Jacinta Jac. Do you call me, sir ? Don Fel. Yes ; Don Pedro would speak with you. \u2014 [Aside to Don Pedro.] I'll leave you with her ; press her both by threats and promises, and if you find your wife in fault, old as I am, her father too, I'll raise my arm to plunge this dagger in her breast ; and by that fermete convince the world, my honour's dearer to me than my child. [Exit. In the pursuit of Leonora ? One I remember well they named ; 'twas Guzman : The other I am yet a stranger to. I fear I shall not be so long \u2014 'Tis Alvarada ; 0 the traitor ! \u2014 yet I may wrong him much. I have Guzman's own confession that he passed the wall to come to Leonora. \u2014 Oh, but 'twas to her assistance. \u2014 Don Ped. [Aside.] Heaven grant me power to stifle my rage, till 'tis time to let my vengeance fly ! \u2014 Jacinta, come near : I have some business with you. Jac. [Aside.] His business with me at this time can be good for nothing, I doubt. \u2014 [Aloud.] What commands have you, sir, for me ? for I'm not very well. And so it might, and he a villain still. There are assistances of various sorts. \u2014 What were her wants ? That's dark. \u2014 But what- They were, he came to her assistance. [soe'er Death be his portion for his ready service ! Don Ped. What's your disorder ? Jac. A little sort of a something towards an ague, Enter Don Felix. Don Fel. You avoid me, Don Pedro ; 'tis not well. Am I not your father, have you not reason to believe I am your friend ? Don Ped. I have. Don Fel. Why do you not then treat me like a father and a friend? The mystery you make to me of last night's disturbance I take unkindly from you. Come tell me your grief, that if I can I may assuage it. Don Ped. Nothing but vengeance can give me ease. I think. Don Ped. You don't seem so ill but you may tell me \u2014 Jac. Oh, I can tell you nothing, sir, I assure you. Don Ped. You answer me before you hear my question. That looks as if you knew \u2014 Jac. I know that what you are going to ask me, is a secret I'm out at. Don Ped. [Offering her a purse.] Then this shall let thee into it. Jac. I know nothing of the matter. Don Ped. Come, tell me all, and take thy reward. Don Fel. If I desire to know your wrongs, 'tis to assist you in revenging them. Don Fed. Know then, that last night in this apartment I found Don Guzman and Don John. Don Fel. Guzman and Alvarada ! Don Ped. Yes ; and Leonora almost naked be tween them, crying out for aid. Don Fel. Were they both guilty ? Jac. I know nothing of the matter, I say. Don Ped. [Drawing his sword.] Speak ; or by all the flame and fire of hell eternal\u2014 Jac. O Lard ! O Lard ! O Lard ! Don Ped. Speak, or th'art dead."], [502, "408 THE FALSE FRIEND. ACT IV. Jac. But if I do speak, shan't I be dead for all Don Ped. I hear something. Jac. 'Tis he. that ? Don Ped. Speak, and thou art safe. Jac. Well\u2014O Lard !\u2014 I'm so frighted !\u2014 But if I must speak then \u2014 O dear heart ! \u2014 give me the purse. Don Guz. [ Within.] Who's there ? Don Ped. [Softly.] Say you are Leonora. [Dumb show of her unwillingness, and his threatening. Jac. [Softly.] 'Tis Leonora. Don Guz. What are your commands, madam ? Is it possible so unfortunate a wretch as I can be capable of serving you ? Don Ped. There. Jac. Why truly, between a purse in one's hand\u2014 and \u2014 a sword in one's guts, I think there's little room left for debate. [Don Pedro whispers Jacinta, who seems backward to speak. Don Ped. Come, begin, I'm impatient. Jac. Begin ! let me see ; where shall I begin ? at Don Guzman, I think. Jac. I come to ask you, how you could so far forget that infinite regard you have professed, to make an attempt so dangerous both to yourself and me ; and which, with all the esteem and love I have ever borne you, you scarce could hope I ever should forgive you. Don Guz. Alas, my hopes and fears were vanish'd too. My counsel was my love and my despair. If they advised me wrong, of them complain, For it was you who made 'em my directors. Don Ped. [Aside.] The villain owns the fact. It seems he thinks He has not much to fear from her resentment. Oh, torture ! Don Ped. What of him ? Jac. Why he has been in love with my lady these six years. Don Ped. I know it, but how has she received him ? Jac. Received him ! Why \u2014 as young maids use to receive handsome fellows ; at first ill, afterwards better. Don Ped. [Aside.] Furies !\u2014 [Aloud.] Did they ever meet ? Jac. A little. Don Ped. By day or night ? Jac. Both. Don Ped. Distraction ! Where was their ren dezvous ? Enter Leonora. Jac. Where they could not do one another much good. Don Ped. As how ? Jac. [Aside.] So, she's here ; that's as I ex pected : now we are blown up. Leo. [Aside, not seeing them.] If I don't mis take, I heard Don Guzman's call. I can't refuse to answer it ; forgive me, gods, and let my woman's weakness plead my cause. \u2014 How ! my husband here ! Nay then \u2014 Don Ped. You seem disordered, madam ; pray what may be the cause ? Leo. [Confused.] I don't know really ; I'm not \u2014 I don't know that \u2014 Jac. As through a hole in a wall. Don Ped. The strumpet banters me. \u2014 Be serious, Insolence, or I shall spoil your gaiety ; I'm not disposed to mirth. Jac. Why I am serious, if you like my story the better for't. Don Ped. [Aside.] How miserable a wretch am 1 I Jac. I tell you there's a wall parts their two houses, and in that wall there's a hole. How the wall came by the hole, I can't tell ; mayhap by chance, mayhap by no chance ; but there 'tis, and there they use to prattle. Don Ped. And this is truth ? Don Ped. You did not know that I was here, I guess. Leo. Yes I did, and \u2014 came to speak with you. Don Ped. I'm not at present in a talking humour, But if your tongue is set to conversation, There's one behind the wall will entertain you. Don Guz. But is it possible, fair Leonora, that you can pardon my attempt ? Don Ped. [To Leonora.] You hear him, ma dam ; he dares own it to you. Leo. [Aside.] Jacinta winks ; I guess what scene they have been acting here. My part is now to play. \u2014 [To Don Pedro.] I see, sir, he dares own it : nor is he the first lover has presumed be yond the countenance he ever has received. Pray draw near, and hear what he has more to say : it is my interest you should know the depth of all has ever passed between us. \u2014 I fain would know, Don Guzman, whether In the whole conduct of my life, you've known One step that could encourage you to hope I ever could be yours, But on the terms of honour which you sought me ?

Ah, Jacinta, thou hast pierced my soul ! Jac. [Aside.] And yet I han't told you half I could tell you, my don. Don Ped. Where is this place you speak of ? Jac. There 'tis, if you are curious. Don Ped. When they would speak with one another, what's the call ? Jac. Tinkle, tinkle. Don Ped. A bell ? Jac. It is. Don Ped. Ring ! Jac. What do you mean, sir ? Don Ped. [Hastily.] Ring ! Jac. 'Tis done. [She makes the signal. Don Ped. [Aside.] I'll make use of her to examine him. \u2014 [Aloud.] Does he come ? Jac. Not yet. Don Ped. Pull again. Jac. Y'ou must give him time, sir; my lady always does so. Leo.

I'll tell you, sir : I only beg you'll go to the place where Don John expects him ; tell him I have intercepted his letter, and make him promise you he'll send no more. By this generous charitv you may hinder two men (whose piques are on a frivolous occasion) from murdering one another : and by this good office you'll repay the small debt you owe my brother for flyinglast night to Leonora's succour ; and doubly pay the obligation you have to me upon the same occasion. Don Ped. What obligation, madam ? I am ignorant ; pray inform me. Isab. 'Twas I, sir, that first heard Leonora's cries, and raised my brother to her aid. Pray let me receive the same assistance from your prudence which you have had from my care and my brother's generosity. But pray lose no time. Don John is perhaps already on the spot, and not meeting my brother, may send a second message, which may be fatal. Leo. If strong temptation be allow'd a plea, Vice, in the worst of shapes, has much to urge. No, Could anything have shaken me in virtue, It must have been the strength of'it in you. Had you shone bright enough to dazzle me, I blindly might have miss'd the path I meant To tread : but now you have clear'd my sight for ever. If therefore from this moment more you dare To let me know one thought of love, Though in the humblest style, expect to be A sacrifice to him you attempt to wrong. Farewell ! [She retires from him. Don Guz. Oh, stay and hear me ! I have wronged myself, I'm innocent ; by all that's sacred, just, and good, I'm innocent ! Don Ped. [Aside.] What does he mean ? Don Guz. I have owned a fact I am not guilty of ; Jacinta can inform you, she knows I never \u2014 Jac. I know ! the man's mad. Pray be gone, sir, my lady will hear no more. \u2014 I'll shut him out, madam, shan't I ? Leo. I have no farther business with him. Don Ped. Madam, be at rest ; you shall be satisfied, I'll go this moment. I'll only ask you first whether you are sure you heard my wife call out for succour, before your brother passed the wall? Isab. I did ; why do you ask that question ? Don Ped. 1 have a reason, you may be sure. \u2014 [Aside.] Just Heaven, I adore thee ! the truth at last shines clear, and by that villain Alvarada I'm betrayed. But enough, I'll make use of this occa sion for my vengeance. \u2014 [To Isabella.] Where, madam, is it Don John is waiting ? Isab. But here, in a small field behind the garden. [Jacinta shuts up the hole. Enter Isabella hastily. Isab. O Heavens, Leonora, where are you ? \u2014 Don Pedro, you can assist me better. Leo. What's the matter ? Don Ped. What is it, madam, I can serve you in ? Isab. In what the peace of my whole life con sists, the safety of my brother. Don John's servant has this moment left me a letter for him, which I have opened, knowing there is an animosity of some time between 'em. Don Ped. [Aside.] His blood shall do me reason for his treachery. Isab. Will you go there directly ? Don Ped. I will. Be satisfied. [Exit. Don Ped. Well, madam 1 Isab. O dear, it is a challenge, and what to do I know not! If I show it my brother, he'll imme diately fly to the place appointed : and if I don't, he'll be accused of cowardice. One way I risk his life, t'other I ruin his honour. Leo. You weep, Isabella. Isab. You see my trouble for a brother, for whom I would die, and a lover for whom I would live. They both are authors of my grief. Leo. They both are instruments of my mis fortune. Don Ped. What would you have me do, madam ? ACT V. SCENE I.\u2014 A Field adjoining Don Felix's Garden. Don Pedro, by all the powers ! What the pox does he here, or what the pox do I here ? I'm sure as matters stand, 1 ought to fly him like a creditor ; but he sees me, 'tis too late to slip him. Enter Lopez. Lop. Oho, my good signor Don John, you are mistaken in your man ! I am your humble valet,. 'tis true, and I am to obey you : but when you have got the devil in your body, and are upon your rantipole adventures, you shall Quixote it by your self for Lopez. Yonder he is, waiting for poor Guzman, with a sword of a fathom and a half, a dagger for close engagement ; and (if I don't mis take) a pocket pistol for extraordinary occasions. I think I am not in the wrong to keep a little out of the way. These matters will end in a court of justice, or I'm wrong in my foresight. Now that being a place where I am pretty well known, and not overmuch reputed, I believe 'tis best, neither to come in for prisoner nor evidence. But hold ; yonder comes another Toledo. Don Guzman I presume ; but I presume wrong ; 'tis \u2014 who is't ? Enter Don Pedro. Don Ped. How now, Lopez, where are you going ? Lop. I'm going, sir, I \u2014 I'mgoing \u2014 if you please I'm going about my business. Don Ped. From whence do you come ? Lop. Only, only, sir, from \u2014 taking the air a little, I'm mightily muddled with a whur \u2014 round about in my head for this day or two ; I'm going home to be let blood, as fast as I can, sir. Don Ped. Hold, sir, I'll let you blood here. \u2014 [Aside.] This rascal may have borne some part in this late adventure : He's a coward, I'll try to frighten it out of him. \u2014 [Aloud. ] Y'ou traitor you, y'are dead !

With respect to my master ; no. Don Ped. Frepare then to die. Lop. Give me but time, and I will. But noble Don Pedro, just Don Pedro, generous Don Pedro, what is it I have done ? Don Ped. In the heart of a sworn friend. Don John. [Aside.] I saw Lopez go from him ; without doubt he has told him all. \u2014 [Aloud.] Of what am I suspected ? Don Ped. Of betraying the greatest trust that man could place in man. Don John. And by whom am I accused. Don Ped. By me. Have at thy traitor's heart. Don John. Hold ! and be not quite a madman ! Pedro, you know me well. You know I am not backward upon these occasions, nor shall I refuse you any satisfaction you'll demand; but first, I will be heard, and tell you, that for a man of sense, you are pleased to make very odd conclusions. Don Ped. Why, what is't possible thou canst invent to clear thyself? Don John. To clear myself! Of what? I'm to be thanked for what I have done, and not re proached. I find I have been an ass, and pushed my friendship to that point, you find not virtue in yourself enough to conceive it in another. But henceforward I shall be a better husband on't. Don Ped. What if thou darest deny, I'll plunge this dagger deep into thy throat, and drive the falsehood to thy heart again. Therefore take heed, and on thy life declare ; didst thou not this last night open my doors to let Don Guzman in ? Lop. Don Guzman ! Don Ped. Don Guzman ? Yes, Don Guzman, traitor, him ! Lop. Now may the sky crush me, if I let in Don Guzman. Don Ped. Who did you let in then ? It wan't your master sure ! if it was him, you did your duty, I have no more to say. Lop. Why then if I let in anybody else, I'm a son of a whore. [Rising. Don Ped. Did he order you beforehand, or did you do't upon his knocking ? Lop. Why he ; I'll tell you, sir, he \u2014 pray put up that brilliant ; it sparkles so in my eyes, it almost blinds me [Don Peoro sheathes his poniard.] Thank you, sir. \u2014 Why, sir, I'll tell you just how the matter was, but I hope you won't consider me as a party ? Don Ped. Go on, thou art safe. Don Ped. I should be loath to find ingratitude could e'er be justly charged upon me : but aster what your servant has confessed \u2014 Don John. My servant ! right, my servant ! the very thing I guessed. Fy, fy, Don Pedro ! is't from a servant's mouth a friend condemns a friend ? or can servants always judge at what their masters' outward actions point ? But some allowances I should make for the wild agitations you must needs be in. I'm therefore calm, and thus far pass all by. Don Ped. If you are innocent, Heaven be my aid, that I may find you so. But still \u2014 Don John. But still you wrong me, if you still suspect. Hear then, in short, my part of this adventure. In order to acquit myself of the charge you laid upon me in your absence, I went last night, just as 'twas dark, to view the several approaches to the house where you had left your wife ; and I observed not far from one of the back doors two persons in close eager conference. I was disguised, so ventured to pass near 'em, and by a word or two I heard, I found 'twas Guzman talk ing to Jacinta. My concern for your honour made me at first resolve to call him to an immediate account. But then reflecting that I might possi bly o'erhear some part of their discourse, and by that judge of Leonora's thoughts, I reined my passion in ; and by the help of an advancing but tress, which kept me from their sight, 1 learned the black conspiracy. Don Guzman said, he had great complaint to make ; and since his honourable love had been so ill returned, he could with ease forgive himself, if by some rougher means he should procure what prayers, and tears, and sighs had urged in vain. Don Ped. Go on. Lop. Why then, sir, (when for our sins,) you had left us, says my master to me, Lopez, says he, go and stay at old Don Felix's house, till Don Pedro returns, they'll pass thee for his servant, and think he has ordered thee to stay there. And then says he, dost hear, open me the door by Leonora's apartment to-night, for I have a little business, says he, to do there. Don Ped. [Aside.] Perfidious wretch ! Lop. Indeed, 1 was at first a little wresty, and stood off ; being suspicious (for I knew the man) that there might be some ill intentions. But he knew me too, takes me upon the weak side, whips out a long sword, and by the same means makes me do the thing as you have made me discover it. \u2014 [Aside.] There's neither liberty nor property in this land, since the blood of the Bourbons came amongst us. Don Ped. Then you let him in, as he bid you ? Lop. I did : if I had not, I had never lived to tell you the story. Yes, I let him in. Don Ped. And what followed .' Lop. Why he followed. Don Ped. What ? Lop. His inclinations. Don Ped. Which way ? Lop. The old way ; to a woman. Don Ped. Confound him ' Lop. In short, he got to madam's chamber, and before he had been there long, (though you know, sir, a little time goes a great way in some matters) I heard such a clutter of small shot, murder ! murder I murder ! rape ! fire ! help ! and so forth.\u2014 But hold, here he comes himself, and can give you a more circumstantial account of the skirmish. [Exit. Don Ped. I thank thee, Heaven, at last, for hav ing pointed me to the victim I am to sacrifice. Don John. His kind assistant closed smoothly with him, and informed him with what ease that very night she'd introduce him to her chamber. At last they parted, with this agreement, that at some overture in a wall, he should expect her to inform him when Leonora was in bed, and all the coast was clear."], [505, "THE FALSE FRIEND. SCENE II. 411 Don Ped. Despatch the rest. \u2014 [Aside.'] Is't possible after all he should be innocent ! Don John. I must confess the resolution taken made me tremble for you. How to prevent it now and for ever was my next care. I immediately ordered Lopez to go lie at Don Felix's and to open me the door when all the family were in bed. He did as I directed him. I entered, and in the dark found my way to Leonora's apartment ; I found the door open, at which I was surprised. I thought I heard some stirring in her chamber, and in an instant heard her cry to aid. At this I drew, and rushed into the room ; which Guzman alarmed at, cried out to her assistance. His ready impudence, I must confess, at first quite struck me speechless ; but in a moment I regained my tongue, and loud proclaimed the traitor. Don Ped. Is't possible ! Don John. Yet more : your arrival hindering me at that time from taking vengeance for your wrong, I at this instant expect him here, to punish him (with heaven's righteous aid) for daring to attempt my ruin with the man, whose friendship I prefer to all the blessings Heaven and earth dis pense. And now, Don Pedro, I have told you this, if still you have a mind to take my life, I shall defend it with the self-same warmth I intended to Don Ped. I 11 go and find him out immediately. Don John. Very well: or hold \u2014 [Aside.] I must hinder 'em from talking, gossiping may dis cover me. \u2014 [Aloud.] Yes: let's go and find him : or, let me see \u2014 ay \u2014 'twill do better. Don Ped. What ? Don John. Why \u2014 that the punishment should suit the crime. Don Ped. Explain. Don John. Attack him by his own laws of war. \u2014 'Twas in the night he would have had your honour, and in the night you ought to have his life. Don Ped. His treason cannot take the guilt from mine. Don John. There is no guilt in fair retaliation. When 'tis a point of honour founds the quarrel, the laws of swordmen must be kept, 'tis true : but if a thief glides in to seize my treasure, methinks I may return the favour on my dagger's point, as well as with my sword of ceremony six times as long. Don Ped. Yet still the nobler method I would choose ; it better satisfies the vengeance of a man of honour. Don John. I own it, were you sure you should succeed : but the events of combats are uncertain. Your enemy may 'scape you : you perhaps may only wound him ; you may be parted. Believe me, Pedro, the injury's too great for a punctilio satisfaction. expose it in your service. [Draws. Don Ped. [Aside] If I did not know he was in love with Leonora, I could be easily surprised with what he has told me. But \u2014 but yet 'tis cer tain he has destroyed the proofs against him ; and if I only hold him guilty as a lover, why must Don Guzman pass for innocent ? Good Gods, I am again returning to my doubts ! Don John. [Aside.] I have at last reduced him to a balance, But one lie more toss'd in will turn the scale. \u2014 [Aloud.] One obligation more, my friend, you Don Ped. Well, guide me as you please, so you direct me quickly to my vengeance. What do you propose ? Don John. That which is easy, as 'tis just to execute. The wall he passed, to attempt your wife, let us get over to prevent his doing so any more. 'Twill let us in to a private apartment by his garden, where every evening in his amorous solitudes he spends some time alone, and where I guess his late fair scheme was drawn. The deed done, we can retreat the way we entered ; let me be your pilot, 'tis now e'en dark, and the most proper time. Don Ped. Lead on ; I'll follow you. Don John. [Aside.] How many villanies I'm forced to act, to keep one secret ! [Exeunt. owe me ; I thought to have let it pass, but it shall out. Know then, I loved, like you, the beauteous Leonora ; But from the moment I observed how deep Her dart had pierced you, I tore my passion from my bleeding heart, And sacrificed my happiness to yours. Now I've no more to plead ; if still you think Your vengeance is my due, come pay it me. Don Ped. Rather ten thousand poniards strike O Alvarada ! [me dead. Can you forgive a wild distracted friend ? Gods ! whither was my jealous frenzy leading me ? Can you forget this barbarous injury? Don John. I can : no more. But for the future, think me what I am, a faithful and a zealous friend. Retire, and leave me here. In a few moments I hope to bring you farther proofs on't. Guzman I instantly expect ; leave me to do you justice on him. Don Ped. That must not be. My revenge can ne'er be satisfied by any other hand but this. Don John. Then let that do't. You'll in a moment have an opportunity. SCENE II. \u2014 Don Guzman's Apartment. Don Guzman discovered sitting. Don Guz. With what rigour does this unfaithful woman treat me ! Is't possible it can be she, who appeared to love me with so much tenderness ? How little stress is to be laid upon a woman's heart? Sure they're not worth those anxious cares they give. \u2014 [Rising.] Then burst my chains, and give me room to search for nobler pleasures.

Bring some lights. Where are you ? Enter Galindo, rubbing his eyes, and drunk. Don Ped. You mistake, he won't be here. Don John. How so ? Gal. I can't well tell. Do you want me, sir ? Don Guz. Yes, sir, I want you. Why am I left in the dark ? what were you doing ? Gal. Doing, sir ! I was doing \u2014 what one does when one sleeps, sir. Don Ped. He has not had your challenge.

[Yawning.] Light ! \u2014 No, sir, \u2014 I have no light. I am used to hardship. I can sleep in the dark. Gal.

Distraction all ! is this a time to balance? Think on the injury he would have done you, 'twill fortify your arm, and guide your dagger to his heart. Don Guz. How came you to drink with him, beast ? Gal. Only par complaisance, sir. The coach man was to be drunk upon madam's wedding ; and I being a friend, was desired to take part. Don Guz. And so, you villain, you can make yourself merry with what renders me miserable ! Gal. No, sir, no ; 'twas the coachman was merry : I drank with tears in my eyes. The remembrance of your misfortunes, made me so sad, so sad, that every cup I swallowed, was like a cup of poison to me. Don Ped. Enough, I'll hesitate no more ; be satisfied, hark ! he's coming. Re-enter Don Guzman, he crosses the stage. Don Guz. I think these rogues are resolved to leave me in the dark all night. [Exit. Don John. Now's your time ; follow him, and strike home. Don Ped.

Well, I must bid you good-morrow ; I'm going where I doubt I shall meet but a sorry wel come. Mrs. Ami. Oh, for that, let us do 'em justice, neighbour ; they never make two words upon the price, all they haggle about is the day of pay ment. Mrs. Clog. There's all the dispute, as you say. Mrs. Ami. But that's a wicked one. For my part, neighbour, I'm just tired off my legs with trotting after 'em ; besides, it eats out all our profit. Would you believe it, Mrs. Cloggit, I have worn out four pair of pattens with following my old lady Youthful, for one set of false teeth, and but three pots of paint. Mrs. Clog. Look you there now ! Mrs. Ami. If they would but once let me get enough by 'em, to keep a coach to carry me a dunning after 'em, there would be some conscience in it. Mrs. Clog. To get in some old debt, I'll war rant you ? Mrs. Ami. Neither better nor worse. Mrs. Clog. From a lady of quality ? Mrs. Ami. No, she's but a scrivener's wife ; but she lives as well and pays as ill as the state liest countess of 'em all. [Exeunt severally. SCENE IL\u2014 The Street before Gripe's House. Mrs. Clog. Ay, that were something. But now you talk of conscience, Mrs. Amlet, how do you speed amongst your city customers ? Mrs. Ami. My city customers ! now by my truth, neighbour, between the city and the court (with reverence be it spoken) there's not a \u2014 to choose. My ladies in the city, in times past, were as full of gold as they were of religion, and as punctual in their payments as they were in their prayers ; but since they have set their minds upon quality, adieu one, adieu t'other, their money and their consciences are gone, Heaven knows where. There is not a goldsmith's wife to be found in town, but's as hard-hearted as an ancient judge, and as poor as a towering duchess. Mrs. Clog. But what the murrain have they to do with quality ! why don't their husbands make 'em mind their shops ? Mrs. Ami. Their husbands ! their husbands, sayest thou, woman ? Alack ! alack ! they mind their husbands, neighbour, no more than they do a sermon. Enter Brass. Brass. Well, surely through the world's wide extent, there never appeared so impudent a fellow as my school-fellow Dick. \u2014 Pass himself upon the town for a gentleman, drop into all the best com pany with an easy air, as if his natural element were in the sphere of quality ; when the rogue had a kettle-drum to his father, who was hanged for robbing a church, and has a pedlar to his mother, \u2014 who carries her shop under her arm ! \u2014 But here he comes. Enter Dick Amlet. Dick. Well, Brass, what news ? Hast thou given my letter to Flippanta ? Brass. I'm but just come : I han't knocked at the door yet. But I have a damned piece of news for you. Dick. As how ? Brass. We must quit this country. Dick. We'll be hanged first. Brass. So you will if you stay. Dick. Why, what's the matter ? Brass. There's a storm a coming. Dick. From whence ? Mrs. Clog. Good lack a-day, that women born of sober parents, should be prone to follow ill examples ! But now we talk of quality, when did you hear of your son Richard, Mrs. Amlet ? My daughter Flipp says she met him t'other day in a laced coat, with three fine ladies, his footman at his heels, and as gay as a bridegroom. Mrs. Ami. Is it possible ? Ah the rogue ! Well, neighbour, all's well that ends well ; but Dick will be hanged. Mrs. Clog. That were pity. Mrs. Ami. Pity indeed ; for he's a hopeful young man to look on ; but he leads a life \u2014 Well \u2014 where he has it, Heaven knows ; but they say, he pays his club with the best of 'em. I have seen him but once these three months, neighbour, and then the varlet wanted money ; but I bid him march, and march he did to some purpose ; for in less than an hour back comes my gentleman into the house, walks to and fro in the room, with his wig over his shoulder, his hat on one side, whist ling a minuet, and tossing a purse of gold from one hand to t'other, with no more respect (Heaven bless us !) than if it had been an orange. Sirrah, says I, where have you got that ?

Enter Clarissa, followed by Flippanta and Brass. Clar. No messages this morning from anybody, Flippanta ? Lard, how dull that is ! Oh, there's Brass ! \u2014 I did not see thee, Brass. What news dost thou bring ? Brass. Only a letter from Araminta, madam. Clar. Give it me. \u2014 Open it for me, Flippanta, I am so lazy to-day. [Sitting down. Brass. [Aside to Flippanta.] Be sure now you deliver my master's as carefully as I do this. Flip- Don't trouble thyself, I'm no novice. Clar. [To Brass.] 'Tis well ; there needs no answer, since she'll be here so soon. Brass. Your ladyship has no farther commands then ? Clar. O fy ! the very quintessence of it is wanting. Flip. What's that ? Clar. Why, I dare abuse nobody : I'm afraid to affront people, though I don't like their faces; or to ruin their reputations, though they pique me to it by taking ever so much pains to preserve 'em : I dare not raise a lie of a man, though he neglects to make love to me ; nor report a woman to be a fool, though she's handsomer than I am. In short, 1 dare not so much as bid my footman kick the people out of doors, though they come to ask me for what I owe 'em. Clar. Not at this time, honest Brass. \u2014 [Exit Brass.] Flippanta ! Flip. Madam. Clar. My husband's in love. Flip. In love ! Clar. With Araminta. Flip. All this is very hard indeed. Clar. Ah, Flippanta, the perquisites of quality are of an unspeakable value ! Flip. They are of some use, I must confess ; but we must not expect to have everything. You have wit and beauty, and a fool to your husband : come, come, madam, that's a good portion for one. Flip. Impossible ! Clar. This letter from her is to give me an account of it. Clar. Alas ! what signifies beauty and wit, when one dares neither jilt the men nor abuse the women? 'Tis a sad thing, Flippanta, when wit's confined ; 'tis worse than the rising of the lights. I have been sometimes almost choked with scandal, and durst not cough it up for want of being a countess. Flip. Poor lady ! Clar. Oh ! liberty is a fine thing, Flippanta ; it's a great help in conversation to have leave to say what one will. I have seen a woman of quality, who has not had one grain of wit, entertain a whole company the most agreeably in the world, only with her malice. But 'tis in vain to repine ; I can't mend my condition till my husband dies ; so I'll say no more on't, but think of making the most of the state I am in. Flip. That's your best way, madam ; and in order to it, pray consider how you'll get some ready money to set your basset-table a-going ; for that's necessary. Flip. Methinks you are not very much alarmed. Clar. No ; thou knowest I'm not much tor- tured with jealousy. Flip. Nay, you are much in the right on't, madam, for jealousy's a city passion ; 'tis a thing unknown amongst people of quality. Clar. Fy ! a woman must indeed be of a mecha nic mould who is either troubled or pleased with anything her husband can do to her. Prithee mention him no more ; 'tis the dullest theme. Flip. 'Tis splenetic indeed. But when once you open your basset-table, I hope that will put him out of your head. Clar. Alas, Flippanta ! I begin to grow weary even of the thoughts of that too. Flip. How so ? Clar. Why, I have thought on't a day and a night already ; and four-and-twenty hours, thou knowest, is enough to make one weary of any thing. Flip. Now, by my conscience, you have more woman in you than all your sex together : you never know what yon would have. Clar. Thou mistakest the thing quite. I al ways know what I lack, but I am never pleased with what I have. The want of a thing is per plexing enough, but the possession of it is intoler able. Flip. Well, I don't know what you are made of, but other women would think themselves blest in your case; handsome, witty, loved by every body, and of so happy a composure to care a fig for nobody. You have no one passion but that of your pleasures ; and you have in me a servant devoted to all your desires, let 'em be as extrava gant as they will. Yet all this is nothing ; you can still be out of humour. Clar. Alas ! I have but too much cause. Flip. Why, what have you to complain of? Clar. Alas ! I have more subjects for spleen than one. Is it not a most horrible thing that I should be but a scrivener's wife ? Come, don t flatter me ; don't you think nature designed me for something plus eleve'e ? Clar. Thou sayest true ; but what trick I shall play my husband to get some I don't know : for my pretence of losing my diamond necklace has put the man into such a passion, I'm afraid he won't hear reason. Flip. No matter ; he begins to think 'tis lost in earnest : so I fancy you may venture to sell it, and raise money that way. Clar. That can't be, for he has left odious notes with all the goldsmiths in town. Flip. Well, we must pawn it then. Clar. I'm quite tired with dealing with those pawnbrokers. Flip. [Aside.] I'm afraid you'll continue the trade a great while, for all that. Enter Jessamin. Jes. Madam, there's the woman below that sells paint and patches, iron-bodice, false teeth, and all sorts of things to the ladies ; I can't think of her name. lE*iL Flip.

But madam plays sometimes, so when she has good fortune, she may pay me out of her winnings. Flip. Oh, ne'er think of that, Mrs. Amlet ; if she had won a thousand pounds, she'd rather die in a jail than pay off a farthing with it. Play-money, Mrs. Amlet, amongst people of quality, is a sacred thing, and not to be profaned The dense ! \u2014 'tis consecrated to their pleasures, 'twould be sacrilege to pay their debts with it. Mrs. Ami. Why what shall we do then ? for I han't one penny to buy bread. Flip.

Madam I Clar. My hoods and scarf, and a coach to the door. Clar. What news brings Brass? Dick. Before Gad I'can't tell, madam; the dog will never speak out. \u2014 [To Brass.] My lord what d'ye call him waits for me at my lodging : is not that it ? Flip. AVhy, whither are you going ? Clar. I can't tell yet, but I would go spend some money, since I have it. Flip. Why, you want nothing that I know of. Clar. How awkward an objection now is that ! as if a woman of education bought things because she wanted 'em. Quality always distinguishes itself, and therefore as the mechanic people buy things, because they have occasion for 'em, you see women of rank always buy things, because they have not occasion for 'em. Now there, Flip panta, you see the difference between a woman that has breeding, and one that has none. O ho, here's Araminta come at last. Brass. Yes, sir. Dick. Madam, I ask your pardon. Clar. Your servant, sir [Exeunt Dick Am let and Brass.] Jessamin ! iShe sits down. Enter Jesasmin. Jes. Madam ! Clar. Where's Corinna ? Call her to me, if her father han't locked her up ; I want her company. Jes, Madam, her guitar-master is with her. [Exit. Clar. Psha! she's taken up with her impertinent guitar man. Flippanta stays an age with that old fool Mrs. Amlet. And Araminta, before she can come abroad, is so long a placing her coquette patch, that I must be a year without company. How insupportable is a moment's uneasiness to a woman of spirit and pleasure ! Enter Araminta. Lard, what a tedious while you have let me expect you ! I was afraid you were not well ; how d'ye do to-day ? Aram As well as a woman can do, that has not slept all night. Enter Flippanta. Oh, art thou come at last? Prithee, Flippanta, learn to move a little quicker, thou knowest how impatient I am. Flip. Yes, when you expect money. If you had sent me to buy a prayer-book, you'd have thought I had flown. Flip. Methinks, madam, you are pretty well awake, however. Aram. Oh, 'tis not a little thing will make a woman of my vigour look drowsy. Clar. But prithee what was't disturbed you ? Aram. Not your husband, don't trouble your self ; at least, I am not in love with him yet. Clar. Well remembered, I had quite forgot that matter. I wish you much joy, you have made a noble conquest indeed. Aram. But now I have subdued the country, pray is it worth my keeping ? You know the ground, you have tried it. Clar. A barren soil, Heaven can tell. Aram. Yet if it were well cultivated, it would produce something to my knowledge. Do you know it is in my power to ruin this poor thing of yours ? His whole estate is at my service. Flip. Cods-fish! strike him, madam, and let my Clar. Well, hast thou brought me any, aster all? Flip. Yes, I have brought some. There \u2014 \u25a0 [Giving her a purse.] The old hag has struck off her bill, the rest is in that purse. Clar. 'Tis well ; but take care, Flippanta, my husband don't suspect anything of this ; 'twould vex him, and I don't love to make him uneasy : so I would spare him these little sort of troubles, by keeping 'em from his knowledge. Flip. See the tenderness she has for him ! and yet he's always complaining of you. Clar. 'Tis the nature of 'em, Flippanta ; a husband is a growling animal. Flip.

Whenever she gives me her orders, I shall be very ready to obey 'em. Clar. Why, as odd a thing as such a project may seem, Araminta, I believe 1 shall have a little serious discourse with you about it. But, prithee, tell me how you have passed the night ? for I am sure your mind has been roving upon some pretty thing or other. Aram. Why, I have been studying all the ways my brain could produce to plague my husband. Clar. No wonder indeed you look so fresh this morning, after the satisfaction of such pleasing ideas all night. Aram. Why, can a woman do less than study mischief, when she has tumbled and tossed herself into a burning fever for want of sleep, and sees a fellow lie snoring by her, stock-still, in a fine breathing sweat ? Clar. Now see the difference of women's tem pers ! If my dear would make but one nap of his whole life, and only waken to make his will, I should be the happiest wife in the universe. But we'll discourse more of these matters as we go, for I must take a tour among the shops. Aram. I have a coach waits at the door, we'll talk of 'em as we rattle along. does not at all change my opinion, Flippanta, it only makes my head ache. Flip. Nay, if you can bear it so, you are not to be pitied so much as I thought. Cor. Not pitied ! Why is it not a miserable thing for such a young creature as I am should be kept in perpetual solitude, with no other company but a parcel of old fumbling masters, to teach me geography, arithmetic, philosophy, and a thousand useless things ? Fine entertainment, indeed, for a young maid at sixteen ? Methinks one's time might be better employed. Flip. Those things will improve your wit. Cor. Fiddle, saddle ! han't I wit enough already ? My mother-in-law has learned none of this trum pery, and is not she as happy as the day is long ? Flip. Then you envy her I find ? Cor. And well I may. Does she not do what she has a mind to, in spite of her husband's teeth ? Flip. [Aside.] Look you there now! If she has not already conceived that as the supreme blessing of life ! Cor. I'll tell you what, Flippanta ; if my mother in-law would but stand by me a little, and encou rage me, and let me keep her company, I'd rebel against my father to-morrow, and throw all my books in the fire. Why, he can't touch a groat of my portion ; do you know that, Flippanta ! Flip. [Aside.] So \u2014 I shall spoil her ! Pray Heaven the girl don't debauch me ! Cor. Look you: in short, he may think what he pleases, he may think himself wise ; but thoughts are free, and I may think in my turn. I'm but a girl, 'tis true, and a fool too, if you'll believe him ; but let him know, a foolish girl may make a wise man's heart ache ; so he had as good be quiet. \u2014 \u25a0 Now it's out. Clar. The best place in nature ; for you know a hackney-coacb is a natural enemy to a husband. [Exeunt Clarissa and Araminta. Flip. What a pretty little pair of amiable per sons are there gone to hold a council of war toge ther ! Poor birds ! What would they do with their time, if the plaguing their husbands did not help 'em to employment ! Well, if idleness be the root of all evil, then matrimony's good for some thing, for it sets many a poor woman to work. But here comes Miss. I hope I shall help her into the holy state too ere long. And when she's once there, if she don't play her part as well as the best of 'em, I'm mistaken. Han't I lost the letter I'm to give her ? \u2014 No, here 'tis ; so, now we shall see how pure nature will work with her, for art she knows none yet. Flip. Very well, I love to see a young woman have spirit, it's a sign she'll come to something. Cor. Ah, Flippanta ! if you would but encourage me, you'd find me quite another thing. I'm a devilish girl in the bottom ; I wish you'd but let me make one amongst you. Flip. That never can be till you are married. Come, examine your strength a little. Do you think you durst venture upon a husband ? Cor. A husband ! Why, a \u2014 if you would but encourage me. Come, Flippanta, be a true friend now. I'll give you advice when I have got a little more experience. Do you in your very conscience and soul think I am old enough to be married ? Flip. Old enough ! why, you are sixteen, are you not ? Cor. Sixteen ! I am sixteen, two months, and odd days, woman. I keep an exact account. Flip. The deuse you are ! Cor. Why, do you then truly and sincerely think I am old enough ? Flip. I do upon my faith, child. Cor. Why, then, to deal as fairly with you, Flippanta, as you do with me, I have thought so any time these three years. Flip. Now I find you have more wit than ever I thought you had ; and to show you what an opinion I have of your discretion, I'll show you a thing I thought to have thrown in the fire. Cor. What is it, for Jupiter's sake ? Flip. Something will make your heart chuck within you. Enter Corinna. Cor. What does my mother-in-law want with me, Flippanta ? They tell me she was asking for me. Flip. She's just gone out, so I suppose 'twas no great business. Cor. Then I'll go into my chamber again. Flip. Nay, hold a little if you please. I have some business with you myself of more concern than what she had to say to you. Cor. Make haste then, for you know my father won't let me keep you company ; he says you'll spoil me. Flip. I spoil you ! He's an unworthy man to give you such ill impressions of a woman of my honour. Cor. Nay, never take it to heart, Flippanta, for I don't believe a word he says. But he does so plague me with his continual scolding, I'm almost weary of my life. Flip. Why, what is't he finds fault with ? Cor. Nay, I don't know, for I never mind him ; when he has babbled for two hours together, me thinks I have heard a mill going, that's all. It Cor.

Well, since you are so well versed in your business, I suppose I need not inform you, that if you don't write your gallant an answer \u2014 he'll die. Cor. Nay, now, Flippanta, I confess you tell me something I did not know before. Do you speak in serious sadness 2 are men given to die if their mistresses are sour to 'em ? mad to have it. Flip. It's a four-cornered thing. Cor. What, like a cardinal's cap ? Flip. No, 'tis worth a whole conclave of 'em. How do you like it ? [Showing the letter. Cor. O Lard, a letter ! Is there ever a token in it? Flip. Yes, and a precious one too. There's a handsome young gentleman's heart. Cor.

Um \u2014 I can't say they all die. \u2014 No, 1 can't say they all do ; but truly, I believe it would go very hard with the colonel. Cor. Lard, I would not have my hands in blood for thousands ; and therefore, Flippanta \u2014 if you'll encourage me \u2014 Flip. What's the matter now? Cor. I shan't receive it. Flip.

You'll find I am. Mon. Ah, Flippanta ! How do you do, good Flippanta ? how do you do ? Flip. Thank you, sir, well, at your service. Mon. And how does the good family, your mas ter, and your fair mistress ? Are they at home ? Flip. Neither of 'em ; my master has been gone out these two hours, and my lady is just gone with your wife. Mon. Well, I won't say I have lost my labour, however, as long as I have met with you Flip panta. For I have wished a great while for an opportunity to talk with you a little. You won't take it amiss, if I should ask you a few questions ? Flip. Provided you leave me to my liberty in my answers. \u2014 [Aside.] What's this cotquean going to pry into now ! Mon. Prithee, good Flippanta, how do your master and mistress live together ? Flip. Live ! why \u2014 like man and wife ; generally out of humour, quarrel often, seldom agree, com plain of one another ; and perhaps have both rea son. In short, 'tis much as 'tis at your house. Mon. Good lack ! But whose side are you generally of ? Flip. Oh, the right side always, my lady's. And if you'll have me give you my opinion of these mat ters, sir, I do not think a husband can ever be in the right. Mon. Ha! Flip. So, here's fine work ! This 'tis to deal with girls before they come to know the distinc tion of sexes ! Cor. Confess who you had it from, and perhaps, for this once, I mayn't tell my father. Flip. Why then since it must out, 'twas the colonel. But why are you so scrupulous, madam ? Cor. Because if it had come from anybody else \u2014 I would not have given a farthing for it.

Their wives do by them as children do by dogs, tease and provoke 'em, till they make 'em so cursed, they snarl and bite at everything that comes in their reach. This wretch here is grown perverse to that degree, he's for his wife's keeping home, and making hell of his house, so he may be the devil in it, to torment her. How niggardly soever he is, of all things he possesses, he is willing to purchase her misery, at the expense of his own peace. But he'd as good be still, for he'll miss of his aim.

No ; my reputation's as good as the best of 'em ; and though I'm old, I'm chaste, you rascal you ! Dick. Lord, that is not the thing we talk of, mother ; but \u2014 Flip. I'll be your security. Cor. I'm young, and know nothing of the mat ter ; but you have experience, so it's your business to conduct me safe. Mrs. Ami. I think, as the world goes, they may be proud of marrying their daughter into a vartuous family. Dick. Oons ! Vartue is not the case \u2014 Flip. Poor innocence ! Cor. But tell me in serious sadness, Flippanta, does he love me with the very soul of him ? Flip. I have told you so a hundred times, and yet you are not satisfied. Cor. But, methinks, I'd fain have him tell me so himself. Mrs. Ami. Where she may have a good example before her eyes. Dick. O Lord ! O Lord ! O Lord ! Mrs. Ami. I'm a woman that don't so much as encourage an incontinent look towards me. Dick. I tell you, 'sdeath, I tell you \u2014 Mrs. Ami. If a man should make an uncivil motion to me, I'd spit in his lascivious face : and all this you may tell 'em, sirrah. Dick. Death and furies I the woman's out of her \u2014 Flip. Have patience, and it shall be done. Cor. Why, patience is a virtue ; that we must all confess. \u2014 But, I fancy, the sooner it's done the better, Flippanta. Enter Jessamin. Jes. Madam, yonder's your geography-master waiting for you. [Exit. Cor. Ah, how I am tired with these old fumbling fellows, Flippanta ! Flip. Well, don't let 'em break your heart, you shall be rid of 'em all ere long. Cor. Nay, 'tis not the study I'm so weary of, Flippanta, 'tis the odious thing that teaches me. Were the colonel my master, I fancy I could take pleasure in learning everything he could show me. Mrs. Ami. Don't you swear, you rascal you, don't you swear ; we shall have thee damned at last, and then I shall be disgraced. Dick. Why then in cool blood hear me speak to you. I tell you it's a city fortune I'm about, she cares not a fig for your vartue, she'll hear of nothing but quality. She has quarrelled with one of her friends for having a better complexion, and is re solved she'll marry, to take place of her. Mrs. Ami. What a cherry-lip is there ! Dick. Therefore, good dear mother now, have a care and don't discover me ; for if you do, all's lost. Mrs. Ami. Dear, dear, how thy fair bride will be delighted ! Go, get thee gone, go ! Go fetch her home ! go fetch her home ! I'll give her a sack-posset, and a pillow of down she shall lay her head upon. Go, fetch her home, I say ! Dick. Take care then of the main chance, my dear mother ; remember if you discover me \u2014 - Mrs. Ami. Go, fetch her home, I say ! Flip. And he can show you a great deal, I can tell you that. But get you gone in, here's some body coming, we must not be seen together. Cor. I will, I will, I will !\u2014 Oh, the dear colonel ! [Exit, running. Enter Mrs. Amlet. Flip. O ho, it's Mrs. Amlet. \u2014 What brings you so soon to us again, Mrs. Amlet ? Mrs. Ami. Ah, my dear Mrs. Flippanta, I'm in a furious fright ! Flip. Why, what's come to you ? Mrs. Ami. Ah, mercy on us all ! \u2014 Madam's diamond necklace \u2014 Dick. You promise me then \u2014 Mrs. Ami. March ! Flip. What of that ? Mrs. Ami. Are you sure you left it at my house ? Flip. Sure I left it ! a very pretty question truly ! Mrs. Ami. Nay, don't be angry ; say nothing to madam of it, I beseech you. It will be found again, if it be Heaven's good will. At least 'tis I must bear the loss on't. 'Tis my rogue of a son has laid his birdlime fingers on't. Dick. But swear to me \u2014 Mrs. Ami. Begone, sirrah ! Dick.

Do you breed youi children up to such tricks as these then ? Mrs. Ami. What shall I say to you, Mrs. Flip panta ? Can I help it ? He has been a rogue from his cradle, Dick has. But he has his deserts too. And now it comes in my head, mayhap he may have no ill design in this neither. Flip. No ill design, woman ! He's a pretty fellow if he can steal a diamond necklace with a good one. Flip. Who told you that, sirrah ? Brass. 'Tis a negotiation I am charged with, pert. Did not I tell thee I did business for half the town ? I have managed Master Gripe's little affairs for him these ten years, you slut you. Flip. Hark thee, Brass, the game's in our hands, if we can but play the cards. Brass. Pique and repique, you jade you, if the wives will fall into a good intelligence. Flip.

Hark you, Mrs. Flippanta, is not here a young gentlewoman in your house that wants a husband ? Flip. Why do you ask ? Mrs. Ami. By way of conversation only, it does not concern me ; but when she marries, I may chance to dance at the wedding. Remember I tell you so ; I who am but Mrs. Amlet. Flip. You dance at her wedding ! you ! Mrs. Ami. Yes I, I ; but don't trouble madam about her necklace, perhaps it mayn't go out of the family. Adieu, Mrs. Flippanta. [Exit. Flip.

Madam, I only called in as I was going by. \u2014 But some little propositions Mrs. Flippanta has been starting, have kept me here to offer your ladyship my humble service. Clar. What propositions ?

Well, hussy, how stand our affairs ? Has miss writ us an answer yet ? my master's very impatient yonder. Flip. And why the deuse does not he come him self ?

Why, madam, you have made a conquest. Clar. Hussy ! \u2014 But of who ? quick ! Flip. Of Mr. Moneytrap, that's all. Aram. My husband ! Flip. Yes, your husband, madam. You thought fit to corrupt ours, so now we are even with you. Aram. Sure thou art in jest, Flippanta ! Flip. Serious as my devotions. Brass. And the cross intrigue, ladies, is what our brains have been at work about. Brass. So much the worse for him ; 'tis his business. \u2014 But now, my dear, let thee and I talk a little of our own : I grow most damnably in love with thee ; dost hear that ? Flip.

Not she alone neither, therefore don't let her grow vain upon't ; for I have three or four affairs of that kind going at this time. Flip.

Mon. Good lack ! But I'll warrant, in general, 'tis her naughty husband that makes her house uneasy to her. But hast thou said a little some thing to her, chicken, for an expiring lover ? ha ! Flip. Said 1 \u2014 yes, I have said ; much good may it do me ! Clar. Now that's a vile article, Araminta ; for that thing your husband is so like mine \u2014 Flip. Phu, there's a scruple, indeed ! Pray, madam, don't be so squeamish ; though the meat be a little flat, we'll find you savoury sauce to it. Clar. This wench is so mad. Mon. Well, and how ? Flip. And how ! \u2014 And how do you think you would have me do't? And you have such a way with you, one can refuse you nothing. But I have brought myself into a fine business by it. Mon. Good lack ! \u2014 But I hope, Flippanta \u2014 Flip. Yes, your hopes will do much, when I am turned out of doors. Flip. Why, what in the name of Lucifer is it you have to do that's so terrible ? Brass. A civil look only. Aram. There's no great harm in that. Flip. An obliging word. Clar. That one may afford 'em. Brass. A little smile a propos. Aram. That's but giving one's self an air. Flip. Receive a little letter, perhaps. Clar. Women of quality do that from fifty odious fellows. Mon. Was she then terrible angry ? Flip. Oh ! had you seen how she flew, when she saw where I was pointing ; for you must know I went round the bush, and round the bush, before I came to the matter. Mon. Nay, 'tis a ticklish point, that must be owned. Flip. On my word is it \u2014 I mean where a lady's truly virtuous ; for that's our case, you must know. Mon. A very dangerous case indeed. Flip. But I can tell you one thing \u2014 she has an inclination to you. Mon. Is it possible ! Flip. Yes, and I told her so at last. Mon. Well, and what did she answer thee ? Flip. Slap \u2014 and bid me bring it you for a token. [Giving him a slap on the face. Mon. [Aside.] And you have lost none on't by the way, with a pox t'ye ! Flip. Now this, I think, looks the best in the world. Mon. Yea, but really it feels a little oddly. Flip. Why, you must know, ladies have different ways of expressing their kindness, according to the humour they are in. If she had been in a good one, it had been a kiss ; but as long as she sent you something, your affairs go well. Mon. Why, truly, I am a tittle ignorant in the mysterious paths of love, so I must be guided by thee. But, prithee, take ber in a good humour next token she sends me. Brass. Suffer (maybe) a squeeze by the hand. Aram. One's so used to that one does not feel it. Flip. Or if a kiss would do't ? Clar. I'd die first ! Brass. Indeed, ladies, I doubt 'twill be neces sary to \u2014 Clar. Get their wretched money, without paying so dear for it. Flip. Well, just as you please for that, my ladies. But I suppose you'll play upon the square with your favours, and not pique yourselves upon being one more grateful than another ? Brass. And state a fair account of receipts and disbursements ? Aram. That I think should be indeed. Clar. With all my heart, and Brass shall be our bookkeeper. So get thee to work, man, as fast as thou canst ; but not a word of all this to thy master. Brass.

Yes, two hundred pound. \u2014 Or let me see \u2014 so even a sum may look a little suspicious, \u2014 ay \u2014 let it be two hundred and thirty ; that odd thirty will make it look so natural the devil won't find it out.

Why, what difficulties can she be in ? Flip. Nay, I do but guess after all ; for she has that grandeur of soul, she'd die before she'd tell. Mon. But what dost thou suspect ? Flip. Why, what should one suspect, where a husband loves nothing but getting of money, and a wife nothing but spending on't ? Mon. So she wants that same then ? Flip. I say no such thing, I know nothing of the matter ; pray make no wrong interpretation of what I say, my lady wants nothing that I know of. Tis true \u2014 she has had ill luck at cards of late ; I believe she has not won once this month : but what of that ? Mon. Ha! Flip. Pounds, too, look I don't know how ; guineas I fancy were better : \u2014 ay, guineas, it shall be guineas. You are of that mind, are you not ? Mon. Um \u2014 a guinea, you know, Flippanta, is \u2014 Flip. A thousand times genteeler ; you are certainly in the right on't ; it shall be as you say, two hundred and thirty guineas. Mon. Ho \u2014well, if it must be guineas, let s see, two hundred guineas. Flip. And thirty ; two hundred and thirty : if you mistake the sum, you spoil all. So go put 'em in a purse, while it's fresh in your head, and send 'em to me with a penitential letter, desiring I'll do you the favour to restore 'em to her. Mon. Two hundred and thirty pounds in a bag ! Flip. Guineas, I say, guineas ! Mon. Ay, guineas, that's true. But, Flippanta, if she don't know they come from me, then I give my money for nothing, you know. Flip. Phu ! leave that to me ; I'll manage the stock for you, I'll make it produce something, I'll warrant you. Mon. Ha 1 Flip. 'Tis true, I know her spirit's that she'd see her husband hanged before she'd ask him for a farthing. Mon. Ha! Flip. And then I know him again, he'd see her drowned before he'd give her a farthing ; but that's a help to your affair, you know. Mon. 'Tis so indeed. Flip. Ah \u2014 well, I'll say nothing ; but if she had none of these things to fret her \u2014 \u2022 Mon. Why really, Flippanta \u2014 Flip. I know what you are going to say now ; you are going to offer your service, but 'twon't do ; you have a mind to play the gallant now, but it must not be, you want to be showing your liberality, but 'twon't be allowed ; you'll be pressing me to offer it, and she'll be in a rage\". We shall have the devil to do. Mon. Well, Flippanta, 'tis a great sum indeed , but I'll go try what I can do for her. You say, two hundred guineas in a purse ? Flip.

Nay, in our punishments you still made good your post ; for when once upon a time I was sentenced but to be whipped, I cannot deny but you were condemned to be hanged.

Look you, sir, some folks we mistrust, because we don't know 'em; others we mistrust, because we do know 'em : and for one of these reasons I desire there may be a bargain beforehand.

A devilish fellow ; one Mr. Amlet. Dick. Amlet ! I know no such man. Flip. You know the man's mother though ; you met her here, and are in her favour, I can tell you. If he worst you in your mistress, you shall e'en marry her, and disinherit him. Dick. If I have no other rival but Mr. Amlet, I believe I shan't be much disturbed in my amour.

Enter Corinna, Dick Amlet, and Brass. Brass. Don't fear, I'll give timely notice. [Goes to the door. Dick. Come, you must consent, you shall con sent. How can you leave me thus upon the rack ? a man who loves you to that excess that I do. Cor. Nay, that you love me, sir, that I am satis fied in, for you have sworn you do : and I am so pleased with it, I'd fain have you do so as long as you live, so we must never marry. Dick. Not marry, my dear ! why, what's our love good for if we don't marry ? Cor. Ah ! \u2014 I'm afraid 'twill be good for little if we do. Dick. Well, madam, have I then your promise? You'll make me the happiest of mankind ? Cor. I don't know what to say to you ; but I believe I had as good promise, for I find I shall certainly do't. Dick. Then let us seal the contract thus. [Kisses her. Dick. Why do you think so ? Cor. Because I hear my father and mother, and my uncle and aunt, and Araminta and her husband, and twenty other married folks, say so from morn ing to night. Dick. Oh, that's because they are bad husbands and bad wives ; but, in our case, there will be a good husband and a good wife, and so we shall love for ever. Cor. [Aside.] Um \u2014 he has almost taken away my breath : he kisses purely ! Dick. Hark! \u2014 somebody comes. Brass. [ Peeping in.] Gare there I the enemy ! \u2014 No, hold ! y'are safe, 'tis Flippanta. Enter Flippanta. Flip. Come, have you agreed the matter? If not, you must end it another time, for your father's in motion, so, pray kiss and part. Cor. That's sweet and sour [They kiss.] Adieu t'ye, sir ! [Exeunt Dick Amlet and Corinna. Cor. Why, there may be something in that truly ; and I'm always willing to hear reason, as a reasonable young woman ought to do. But are you sure, sir, though we are very good now, we shall be so when we come to be better acquainted? Dick. I can answer for myself, at least. Cor. I wish you could answer for me too. You see I am a plain-dealer, sir, I hope you don't Like me the worse for it. Filter Clarissa. Clar. Have you told him I'm at home, Flip panta? Flip. Yes, madam. Clar. And that I'll see him ? Dick. Oh, by no means ! 'Tis a sign of admir able morals ; and I hope, since you practise it yourself, you'll approve of it in your lover. In one word, therefore, (for 'tis in vain to mince the matter,) my resolution's fixed, and the world can't stagger me, I marry \u2014 or I die. Cor. Indeed, sir, I have much ado to believe you ; the disease of love is seldom so violent. Dick. Madam, I have two diseases to end my miseries ; if the first don't do't, the latter shall ; [Drawing his sword] one's in my heart, t'other's in my scabbard. Cor. Not for a diadem ! \u2014 [Catching hold of him.] Ah, put it up ! put it up ! Flip. Yes, that too. But here's news for you ! I have just now received the restitution. Clar. That's killing pleasure ; and how much has he restored me ? Flip. Two hundred and thirty. Clar. Wretched rogue ! But retreat; your master's coming to quarrel. Flip. I'll be within call, if things run high. [Exit. Enter Gripe. Gripe. O ho ! \u2014 are you there i'faith ? Madam, your humble servant, I'm very glad to see you at home, I thought I should never have had that honour again."], [525, "THE CONFEDERACY. SCENE I. 431 Clar. Good-morrow, my dear, how d'ye do ? Flippanta says you are out of humour, and that you have a mind to quarrel with me. Is it true ? ha ! \u2014 I have a terrible pain in my head, I give you notice on't beforehand. Flip. Pray, sir, let's know a little what puts you in all this fury ? Clar. Prithee stand near me, Flippanta, there's an odd froth about his mouth, looks as if his poor head were going wrong, I'm afraid he'll bite. Gripe. The wicked woman, Flippanta, the wicked woman ! Gripe. And how the pox should it be otherwise? It's a wonder you are not dead \u2014 [Aside] as a' would you were ! \u2014 [Aloud] with the life you lead. Are you not ashamed ? and do you not blush to \u2014 Clar. My dear child, you crack my brain ; soften the harshness of your voice. Say what thou wou't, but let it be in an agreeable tone. Gripe. Tone, madam ! don't tell me of a tone \u2014 Clar. Oh, \u2014 if you will quarrel, do it with tem perance ; let it be all in cool blood, even and smooth, as if you were not moved with what you said ; and then I'll hear you as if I were not moved with it neither. Clar. Can anybody wonder I shun my own house, when he treats me at this rate in it ? Gripe. At this rate ! Why in the devil's name \u2014 Clar. Do you hear him again ? Flip. Come, a little moderation, sir, and try what that will produce. Gripe. Hang her, 'tis all a pretence to justify her going abroad. Clar. A pretence ! a pretence ! Do you hear how black a charge he loads me with ? Charges me with a pretence ! Is this the return for all my downright open actions ? You know, my dear, I scorn pretences : whene'er I go abroad, it is without pretence. Gripe. Give me patience ! Flip. Y'ou have a great deal, sir. Clar. And yet he's never content, Flippanta. Gripe. What shall I do I Clar. What a reasonable man would do ; own yourself in the wrong, and be quiet. Here's Flip panta has understanding, and I have moderation ; I'm willing to make her judge of our differences. Flip. You do me a great deal of honour, ma dam : but I tell you beforehand, I shall be a little on master's side. Gripe. Had ever man such need of patience ! Madam, madam, I must tell you, madam \u2014 Clar. Another key, or I walk off. Gripe. Don't provoke me. Clar. Shall you be long, my dear, in your remonstrances ? Gripe. Yes, madam, and very long. Clar. If you would quarrel in abre'ge'e, I should have a world of obligation to you. Gripe. What I have to say, forsooth, is not to be expressed in abre'ge'e, my complaints are too numerous. Clar. Complaints ! of what, my dear ? Have I ever given you subject of complaint, my life ? Gripe. O pox ! my dear and my life ! I desire none of your tendres. Clar. How ! find fault with my kindness, and my expressions of affection and respect ? The world will guess by this what the rest of your com plaints may be. I must tell you I'm scandalised at your procedure. Gripe. I must tell you I'm running mad with yours. Gripe. Right, Flippanta has sense. Come, let her decide. \u2014 Have I not reason to be in a passion ? tell me that. Clar. You must tell her for what, my life. Gripe. Why, for the trade you drive, my soul. Flip. Look you, sir, pray take things right. I know madam does fret you a little now and then, that's true ; but in the fund she is the softest, sweetest, gentlest lady breathing. Let her but live entirely to her own fancy, and she'll never say a word to you from morning to night. Gripe. Oons ! let her but stay at bome, and she shall do what she will : in reason, that is. Flip. D'ye hear that, madam ? Nay, now I must be on master's side ; you see how he loves you, he desires only your company. Pray give him that satisfaction, or I must pronounce against you. Clar. Well, I agree. Thou knowest I don't love to grieve him : let him be always in good hu mour, and I'll be always at home. Flip. Look you there, sir, what would you have more ? Gripe. Well, let her keep her word, and I'll have done quarrelling. Clar. I must not, however, so far lose the merit of my consent, as to let you think I'm weary of going abroad, my dear. What I do, is purely to oblige you ; which, that I may be able to perform without a relapse, I'll invent what ways I can to make my prison supportable to me. Flip. Her prison ! pretty bird ! her prison ? don't that word melt you, sir? Gripe. I must confess I did not expect to find her so reasonable. Flip. Oh, sir, soon or late wives come into good humour. Husbands must only have a little pa tience to wait for it. Clar. Ah ! how insupportable are the humours of some husbands, so full of fancies, and so ungo vernable ! What have you in the world to disturb you? Gripe. What have I to disturb me ! I have you, death and the devil ! Clar. Ay, merciful Heaven ! how he swears ! You should never accustom yourself to such words as these ; indeed, my dear, you should not ; your mouth's always full of 'em. Gripe. Blood and thunder ! madam \u2014 Clar. Ah, he'll fetch the house down ! Do you know you make me tremble for you ? \u2014 Flippanta ! who's there ? Flippanta ! Gripe. Here's a provoking devil for you ! Re-enter Flippanta. Flip. What in the name of Jove's the matter ? you'll raise the neighbourhood. Clar. Why, here's your master in a most violent fuss, and no mortal soul can tell for what. Gripe. Not tell for what ! Clar. No, my life. \u2014 I have begged him to tell me his griefs, Flippanta ; and then he swears, good Lord, how he does swear ! Gripe. Ah you wicked jade ! ah you wicked jade ! Clar. Do you hear him, Flippanta ! do you hear him! Clar. The innocent little diversions, dear, that I"], [526, "432 THE CONFEDERACY ACT IV. shall content myself with, will be chiefly play and company. Flip. Come, sir, never lose so advantageous a peace for a pitiful porter. Gripe. Why, I shall be hooted at, the boys will throw stones at my porter. Besides, where shall I have money for all this expense ? Clar. My dear, who asks you for any ? Don't be in a fright, chicken. Gripe. Don't be in a fright, madam! But where, I say \u2014 Flip. Madam plays, sir, think on that ; women that play have inexhaustible mines, and wives who receive least money from their husbands, are many times those who spend the most. Clar. So, my dear, let what Flippanta says content you. Go, my life, trouble yourself with nothing, but let me do just as T please, and all will be well. I'm going into my closet, to consider of some more things to enable me to give you the pleasure of my company at home, without making it too great a misery to a yielding wife. [Exit. Flip. Mirror of goodness ! Pattern to all wives ! Well sure, sir, you are the happiest of all hus bands ! Gripe. Oh, I'll find you employment, your time shan't lie upon your hands ; though if you, have a mind now for such a companion as a \u2014 let me see \u2014 Araminta for example, why I shan't be against her being with you from morning till night. Clar. You can't oblige me more, 'tis the best woman in the world. Gripe. Is not she ? Flip. Ah, the old satyr ! [Aside. Gripe. Then we'll have, besides her, maybe sometimes \u2014 her husband ; and we shall see my niece that writes verses, and my sister Fidget ; with her husband's brother that's always merry ; and his little cousin, that's to marry the fat curate; and my uncle the apothecary, with his wife and all his children. Oh, we shall divert ourselves rarely ! Flip. Good ! [Aside. Clar. Oh, for that, my dear child, I must be plain with you, I'll see none of 'em but Araminta, who has the manners of the court ; for I'll con verse with none but women of quality. Gripe. Ay, ay, they shall all have one quality or other. Gripe. Yes \u2014 and a miserable dog for all that too, perhaps. Flip. Why what can you ask more than this matchless complaisance ? Gripe. I don't know what I can ask, and yet I'm not satisfied with what I have neither, the devil mixes in it all, I think; complaisant or per verse, it feels just as't did. Flip. WThy, then, your uneasiness is only a dis ease, sir; perhaps a little bleeding and purging would relieve you. Clar. [Calling ivithin.'] Flippanta 1 Flip. Madam calls. \u2014 I come, madam. \u2014 Come, be merry, be merry, sir, you have cause, take my word for't. \u2014 [Aside.] Poor devil ! [Exit Gripe. I don't know that, I don't know that : but this I do know, that an honest man, who has married a jade, whether she's pleased to spend her time at home or abroad, had better have lived a bachelor. Clar. Then, my dear, to make our home plea sant, we'll have consorts of music sometimes. Gripe. Music in my house ! Clar. Yes, my child, we must have music, or the house will be so dull I shall get the spleen, and be going abroad again. Flip. Nay, she has so much complaisance for you, sir, you can't dispute such things with her. Gripe. Ay, but if I have music \u2014 Clar. Ay, but sir, I must have music \u2014 Flip. Not every day, madam don't mean. Clar. No, bless me, no ; but three consorts a week : three days more we'll play after dinner, at ombre, picquet, basset, and so forth, and close the evening with a handsome supper and a ball. Gripe. A ball 1 Clar. Then, my love, you know there is but one day more upon our hands, and that shall be the day of conversation, we'll read verses, talk of books, invent modes, tell lies, scandalise ourfriends, be pert upon religion ; and in short, employ every moment of it in some pretty witty exercise or other. Flip. What order you see 'tis she proposes to live in ! a most wonderful regularity ! Gripe. Regularity with a pox ! [Aside. Clar. And as this kind of life, so soft, so smooth, so agreeable, must needs invite a vast deal of company to partake of it, 'twill be necessary to have the decency of a porter at our door, you know. Re-enter Brass. Brass. Oh, sir, I'm mighty glad I have found you. Gripe. Why, what's the matter, prithee ? Brass. Can nobody hear us ? Gripe. No, no, speak quickly. Brass. You han't seen Araminta since the last letter I carried her from you ? Gripe. Not I, I go prudently; I don't press things like your young firebrand lovers. Brass. But seriously, sir, are you very much in love with her ? Gripe. A porter ! \u2014 a scrivener have a porter, madam ! Gripe. As mortal man has been. Brass. I'm sorry for't. Gripe. Why so, dear Brass ? Brass. If you were never to see her more now ? Suppose such a thing, d'you think 'twould break your heart ? Gripe. Oh I Brass. Nay, now I see you love her ; would you did not! Gripe. My dear friend ! Brass. I'm in your interest deep ; you see it. Gripe. I do : but speak, what miserable story hast thou for me ? Clar. Positively, a porter. Gripe. Why, no scrivener since Adam ever had a porter, woman ! Clar. You will therefore be renowned in story, for having the first, my life. Gripe. Flippanta ! Flip. [Aside to Gripe.] Hang it, sir, never dispute a trifle ; if you vex her, perhaps she'll insist upon a Swiss. Gripe. But, madam \u2014 Ctar. But, sir, a porter, positively a porter; without that the treaty's null, and I go abroad this moment. Brass. I had rather the devil had, phu ! \u2014 flown"], [527, "THE CONFEDERACY. SCENE I. 433 away with you quick, than to see you so much in love, as I perceive you are, since \u2014 Gripe. Since what ? \u2014 ho ! Brass. Araminta, sir \u2014 stop her ; she's a woman of a noble resolution. So, sir, your humble servant ; I pity her, I pity you, turtle and mate ; but the fates will have it so, all's packed up, and I am now going to call her a coach, for she resolves to slip off without saying a word ; and the next visit she receives from her friends will be through a melancholy grate, with a veil instead of a top-knot. [Going. Gripe. It must not be, by the powers it must not ! she was made for the world, and the world was made for her. Gripe. Dead ? Brass. No. Gripe. How then ? Brass. Worse. Gripe. Out with't Brass. Broke. Gripe. Broke ! Brass. She is, poor lady, in the most unfortu nate situation of affairs. But I have said too much. Brass. And yet you see, sir, how small a share she has on't. Gripe. Poor woman ! is there no way to save Gripe. No, no, 'tis very sad, but let's hear it. Brass. Sir, she charged me, on my life, never to mention it to you, of all men living. Gripe. Why, who shouldst thou tell it to, but to the best of her friends ? her? Brass. Save her ! no ; how can she be saved ? Why she owes above five hundred pound. Gripe. Oh! Brass. Five hundred pound, sir ; she's like to be saved indeed ! \u2014 Not but that I know them in this town would give me one of the five if I would per suade her to accept of t'other four : but she has forbid me mentioning it to any soul living ; and I have disobeyed her only to you ; and so \u2014 I'll go and call a coach. Brass. Ay, why there's it now, it's going just as I fancied. Now will I be hanged if you are not enough in love to be engaging in this matter. But I must tell you, sir, that as much concern as I have for that most excellent, beautiful, agreeable, distressed, unfortunate lady, I'm too much your friend and servant, ever to let it be said, 'twas the means of your being ruined for a woman \u2014 by letting you know she esteemed you more than any other man upon earth. Gripe. Ruined ! what dost thou mean ? Brass. Mean ! why I mean that women always ruin those that love 'em, that's the rule. Gripe. The rule ! Brass. Yes, the rule ; why, would you have 'em ruin those that don't ? How shall they bring that about ? Gripe. Hold ! \u2014 Dost think, my poor Brass, one might not order it so as to compound those debts for \u2014 for \u2014 twelve pence in the pound? Brass. Sir, d'ye hear ? I have already tried 'em with ten shillings, and not a rogue will prick up his ear at it. Though after all, for three hun dred pounds all in glittering gold, I could set their chaps a-watering. But where's that to be had with honour ? there's the thing, sir. \u2014 I'll go and call a coach. Gripe. Hold, once more : I have a note in my closet of two hundred, ay \u2014 and fifty, I'll go and give it her myself. Brass. You will ; very genteel truly ! Go, slap dash, and offer a woman of her scruples money bolt in her face ! Why, you might as well offer her a scorpion, and she'd as soon touch it. Gripe. Shall I carry it to her creditors then, and treat with them ? Gripe. But is there a necessity then they should ruin somebody ? Brass. Yes, marry is there ; how would you have 'em support their expense else ? Why, sir, you can't conceive now \u2014 you can't conceive what Araminta's privy-purse requires : only her privy purse, sir ! Why, what do you imagine now she gave me for the last letter I carried her from you ? 'Tis true, 'twas from a man she liked, else, perhaps, I had had my bones broke. But what do you think she gave me ? Gripe. Why, mayhap \u2014 a shilling. Brass. A guinea, sir, a guinea ! You see by that how fond she was on't, by the by. But then, sir, her coach-hire, her chair-hire, her pin-money, her play-money, her china, and her charity \u2014 would consume peers. A great soul, a very great soul ! but what's the end of all this ? Brass. Ay, that's a rare thought. Gripe. Is not it, Brass ? Brass. Only one little inconvenience by the way. Gripe. As how ? Brass. That they are your wife's creditors as well as hers ; and perhaps it might not be altoge ther so well to see you clearing the debts of your neighbour's wife, and leaving those of your own unpaid. Gripe. Why that's true now. Brass. I'm wise you see, sir. Gripe. Thou art ; and I'm but a young lover. But what shall we do then ? Brass. Why I'm thinking, that if you give me the note, do you see, and that I promise to give you an account of it \u2014 Gripe. Ay, but look you, Brass \u2014 Brass. But look you ! \u2014 Why what, d'ye think I'm a pickpocket ? D'ye think I intend to run away with your note ? your paltry note ! Gripe. I don't say so \u2014 I say only that in case \u2014 Brass. Case, sir ! there's no case but the case I have put you ; and since you heap cases upon cases, where there is but three hundred rascally pounds in the case \u2014 I'll go and call a coach. Gripe. Prithee don't be so testy ; come, no more Gripe. Ha ! Brass. Why, I'll tell you what the end is \u2014 a nunnery. Gripe. A nunnery ! Brass. A nunnery. \u2014 In short, she is at last reduced to that extremity, and attacked with such a battalion of duns, that rather than tell her hus band (who you know is such a dog, he'd let her go if she did) she has e'en determined to turn papist, and bid the world adieu for life. Gripe. O terrible ! a papist ! Brass. Yes, when a handsome woman has brought herself into difficulties, the devil can't help her out of \u2014 to a nunnery, that's another rule, sir. Gripe.

Sir, your wits are worth that, or your wits are worth nothing. Come away. Gripe. Well say no more, thou shalt be satisfied. [Exeunt. Dick . I have no money, you dog ; you know you have stripped me of every penny. Brass.

'Tis not well, sir, 'tis very ill, sir ; we shall be all blown up. Brass. What, with pride and plenty ? Dick. No, sir, with an officious slut that will spoil all. In short, Flippanta has been telling her mistress and Araminta of my passion for the young gentlewoman ; and truly to oblige me (supposed no ill match by the by) they are resolved to propose it immediately to her father. Brass. That's the devil ! We shall come to papers and parchments, jointures and settlements, relations meet on both sides ; that's the devil ! Brass. No words now ; about your business, march ! Go stay for me at the next tavern : I'll go to Flippanta, and try what I can do for you. Dick. Well, I'll go, but don't think to \u2014 O pox, sir !\u25a0\u2014 [Exit. Brass. Will you be gone ? A pretty title you'd have to sue me upon truly, if I should have a mind to stand upon the defensive, as perhaps I may. I have done the rascal service enough to lull my con science upon't I'm sure : but 'tis time enough for that. Let me see \u2014 first I'll go to Flippanta, and put a stop to this family way of match-making, then sell our necklace for what ready money 'twill pro duce ; and by this time to-morrow I hope we shall be in possession of \u2014 t'other jewel here ; a precious jewel, as she's set in gold : I believe for the stone itself we may part with't again to a friend \u2014 for a tester.

I tell you no ; get you in again imme diately, and prevent it. Cor. My dear, dear, I am not able ; I never was in such a way before. Flip. Never in a way to be married before, ha ? is not that it ? Enter Brass and Flippanta. Brass. Well, you agree I'm in the right, don't you ? Flip. I don't know ; if your master has the estate he talks of, why not do't all above-board ? Well, though I am not much of his mind, I'm much in his interest, and will therefore endeavour to serve him in his own way. Brass. That's kindly said, my child, and I believe I shall reward thee one of these days, with as pretty a fellow to thy husband for't as \u2014 Flip.

Why, you must know I begun to give her a little sort of a hint, and \u2014 and so \u2014 why, and so she begun to put on a sort of a severe, haughty, reserved, angry, forgiving air. But soft ; here she comes. You'll see how you stand with her pre sently: but don't be afraid. Courage! Mon. He, hem ! Flip. Never complain of his avarice, madam, as long as you have his money. Clar. But is not he a beast, Flippanta ? me thinks the restitution looked better by half. Flip. Madam, the man's beast enough, that's certain ; but which way will you go to receive his beastly money, for I must not appear with his note ? Enter Clarissa. 'Tis no small piece of good fortune, madam, to find you at home : I have often endeavoured it in vain. Clar. 'Twas then unknown to me, for if I could often receive the visits of so good a friend at home, I should be more reasonably blamed for being so much abroad. Clar. That's true ; why send for Mrs. Amlet ; that's a mighty useful woman that Mrs. Amlet. Flip. Marry is she ; we should have been basely puzzled how to dispose of the necklace without her, 'twould have been dangerous offering it to sale. Clar. It would so, for I know your master has been laying out for't amongst the goldsmiths. But I stay here too long, I must in and coquette it a little more to my lover, Araminta will get ground on me else. Mon. Madam, you make me \u2014 Clar. You are the man of the world whose com- pany I think is most to be desired. I don't com pliment you when I tell you so, I assure you. Mon. Alas, madam ; yourpoorhumble servant \u2014 Clar. My poor humble servant however (with all the esteem I have for him) stands suspected with me for a vile trick I doubt he has played me, which if I could prove upon him I'm afraid I should punish him very severely. Mon. I hope, madam, you'll believe I am not capable of \u2014 Clar. Look you, look you, you are capable of whatever you please, you have a great deal of wit, and know how to give a nice aud gallant turn to everything ; but if you will have me continue your friend, you must leave me in some uncertainty in this matter. Flip. And I'll go send for Mrs. Amlet. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. \u2014 Another Room in the same. Araminta, Corinna, Gripe, and Moneytrap, are dis- covered at a tea-table, very gay and laughing. All. Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Mon. Mighty well, O mighty well indeed ! Enter Clarissa. Clar. Save you, save you, good folks ! you are all in rare humour methinks. Mon. Madam, I do then protest to you \u2014 Clar. Come, protest nothing about it, I am but too penetrating, as you may perceive ; but we sometimes shut our eyes rather than break with our friends ; for a thorough knowledge of the truth of this business, would make me very seriously angry. Gripe. Why, what should we be otherwise for, madam ? Clar. Nay, I don't know, not I, my dear ; but I han't had the happiness of seeing you so since our honeymoon was over, I think. Gripe. Why to tell you the truth my dear, 'tis the joy of seeing you at home \u2014 [Kisses her.] You see what charms you have when you are pleased to make use of 'em. Mon. 'Tis very certain, madam, that \u2014 Clar. Come, say no more on't, I beseech you, for I'm in a good deal of heat while I but think on't ; if you'll walk in, I'll follow you presently.

Clar. Horrid fellow ! [Aside. Gripe. Well, Mr. Clip, no news yet of my wife's necklace ? Clip. If you please to let me speak with you in the next room, I have something to say to you. Mon. Why, here's my love and I have been upon just such another treaty too. Aram. Well, sure there's some very peaceful star rules at present. Pray Heaven continue its reign. Gripe. Ay, with all my heart. Shut the dooi after us. \u2014 [ They come forward, and the scene shuts behind them.] Well, any news? Clip. Look you, sir, here's a necklace brought me to sell, at least very like that you described to me. Mon. Pray do you continue its reign, you ladies; for 'tis all in your power. [Leering al Clarissa.

'Twas a young fellow that I know : I can't tell whether he may be guilty, though it's like enough. But he has only left it me now, to show a brother of our trade, and will call upon me again presently. Gripe. Wheedle him hither, dear Mr. Clip Here's my neighbour Moneytrap in the house ; he's a justice, and will commit him presently. Clip. 'Tis enough. Mon. And I'll answer for another that has the same over me. [Ogling Clarissa. Clar. 'Tis mighty fine, gentleme_i ! mighty civil husbands, indeed ! Gripe. Nay, what I say's true, and so true, that all quarrels being now at an end, I am willing, if you please, to dispense with all that fine company we talked of to-day, be content with the friendly conversation of our two good neighbours here, and spend all my toying hours alone with my sweet wife. Enter Brass. Gripe. O, my friend Brass ! Brass. Hold, sir, I think that's a gentleman I'm looking for. \u2014 Mr. Clip, oh, your servant ! What, are you acquainted here ? I have just been at your shop. Clip. I only stepped here to show Mr. Gripe the necklace you left. Brass. [To Gripe.] Why, sir, do you under stand jewels ? I thought you had dealt only in gold. But I smoke the matter, hark you \u2014 a word in your ear \u2014 you are going to play the gallant again, and make a purchase on't for Araminta; ha, ha? Gripe. Where had you the necklace? Brass. Look you, don't trouble yourself about that ; it's in commission with me, and I caB help you to a pennyworth on't. Gripe. A pennyworth on't, villain? [Strikes at him. Mon. Why, truly, I think now, if these good women pleased, we might make up the prettiest little neighbourly company between our two fami lies, and set a defiance to all the impertinent people in the world. Clar. The rascals ! [Aside. Aram. Indeed I doubt you'd soon grow weary, if we grew fond. Gripe. Never, never, for our wives have wit, neighbour, and that never palls. Clar. And our husbands have generosity, Ara minta, and that seldom palls. Gripe. So, that's a wipe for me now, because I did not give her a new-year's-gift last time ; but be good, and I'll think of some tea-cups for you, next year. Mon. And perhaps I mayn't forget a fan, or as good a thing \u2014 hum, hussy. Clar. Well, upon these encouragements, Ara minta, we'll try how good we can be. Gripe. [Aside.] Well, this goes most rarely ! Poor Moneytrap, he little thinks what makes his wife so easy in his company. Mon. [Aside.] I can but pity poor neighbour Gripe. Lard, Lard, what a fool does his wife and I make of him ! Brass. Villain ! ahey, ahey ! Is't you or me, Mr. Clip, he's pleased to compliment? Clip. What do you think on't, sir ? Brass. Think on't ! now the devil fetch me if 1 know what to think on't. Gripe. You'll sell a pennyworth, rogue ! of a thing you have stolen from me. Brass. Stolen ! pray, sir \u2014 what wine have you drank to-day ? It has a very merry effect upon you. Clar. [Aside to Araminta.] Are not these two wretched rogues, Araminta ? Aram. [Aside to Clarissa.] They are indeed. Gripe. You villain ! either give me an account how you stole it, or \u2014 Brass. O ho, sir, if you please, don't carry your jest too far ; I don't understand hard words, I give you warning on't. If you han't a mind to buy the necklace, you may let it alone ; I know how to dispose on't. What a pox 1 \u2014 Gripe.

Why, truly, my dear, though (as you may all imagine) I should be very glad to recover so valuable a thing as my necklace, yet I must be just to all the world, this necklace is not mine. Brass.

Pray what were you to return for these pounds, madam, ha ? Aram. Nothing, my dear ; I only took 'em to reimburse you of about the same sum you sent to Clarissa. Brass. And the impudence to hire me for your servant, who am as well born as yourself ? Clar. Indeed I think he should be corrected. Aram. Indeed I think he deserves to be cud gelled. Flip. Indeed I think he might be pumped. Brass. Indeed I think he will be hanged. Mrs. Ami. Good lack a-day !

But amongst all this tintamar, I don't hear a word of my hundred pounds. Is it madam will pay me, or master ? Gripe. I pay ! the devil shall pay ! Clar. Look you, my dear, malice apart, pay Mrs. Amlet her money, and I'll forgive you the wrong you intended my bed with Araminta. Am not I a good wife now ? Gripe.

Yes forsooth, though I should lose the hundred you pawned your necklace for. \u2014 Tell 'em of that, Dick. Cor.

(WRITTEN BY MR. STEELE) SPOKEN BY MR. BOOTH. Our author's wit and raillery to-night Perhaps might please, but that your stage-delight No more is in your minds, but ears and sight. With audiences composed of belles and beaux, The first dramatic rule is, have good clothes. To charm the gay spectator's gentle breast, In lace and feather tragedy's express'd, And heroes die unpitied, if ill dress'd. The other style you full as well advance ; If 'tis a comedy, you ask \u2014 Who dance ? For oh ! what dire convulsions have of late Torn and distracted each dramatic state, On this great question, which house first should sell The new French steps, imported by Ruel ? Desbarques can't rise so high, we must agree, They've half a foot in height more wit than we. But though the genius of our learned age Thinks fit to dance and sing quite off the stage. True action, comic mirth, and tragic rage ; Yet as your taste now stands, our author draws Some hopes of your indulgence and applause. For that great end this edifice he made, Where humble swain at lady's feet is laid ; Where the pleased nymph her conquer'd lover spies, Then to glass pillars turns her conscious eyes, And points anew each charm, for which he dies. The Muse, before nor terrible nor great, Enjoys by him this awful gilded seat : By him theatric angels mount more high, And mimic thunders shake a broader sky. Thus all must own, our auihor has done more, For your delight than ever bard before. His thoughts are still to raise your pleasures fill'd To write, translate, to blazon, or to build. Then take him in the lump, nor nicely pry Into smalt faults, that 'scape a busy eye ; But kindly, sirs, consider, he to-day Finds you the house, the actors, and the play : So, though we stage-mechanic rules omit, You must allow it in a wholesale wit.

You are pleased to be jealous of your poor mistress without a cause. She uses you but too well, in my humble opinion. She sees you, and talks with you, till I am quite tired on't sometimes ; and your rival, that you are so scared about, forces a visit upon her about once in a fortnight. Don Cur. Alas ! thou art ignorant in these affairs : he that's the civilest received is often the least cared for. Women appear warm to one, to hide a flame for another. Lorenzo, in short, appears too composed of late to be a rejected lover ; and the indifference he shows upon the favours I seem to receive from her, poisons the pleasure I else should taste in 'em, and keeps me on a perpetual rack. No ! I would fain see some of his jealous transports ; have him fire at the sight o' me, contradict me whenever I speak, affront me wherever he meets me, challenge me, fight me \u2014 San. Run you through the guts. Don Car. But he's too calm, his heart's too much at ease, to leave me mine at rest. Jac. How ! Lorenzo ! San. If less will do, he'll tell you. Jac. Why, you are not mad, sir, are you ? Jealous of him 1 Pray which way may this have got into your head ? I took you for a man of sense before. \u2014 [To Sancho.] Is this your doings, Log? San. No, forsooth, Pert! I'm not much given to suspicion, as you can tell, Mrs. Forward : if I were, I might find more cause, I guess, than your mistress has given our master here. But I have so many pretty thoughts of my own person, house wife, more than I have of yours, that I stand in dread of no man. Jac. That's the way to prosper ; however, so far I'll confess the truth to thee ; at least, if that don't do, nothing else will. Men are mighty simple in love-matters, sir. When you suspect a woman's falling off, you fall a-plaguing her to bring her on again, attack her with reason, and a sour face. Udslife, sir ! attack her with a fiddle, double your good-humour ; give her a ball \u2014 powder your peri wig at her \u2014 let her cheat you at cards a little \u2014 aud I'll warrant all's right again. But to come upon a poor woman with the gloomy face of jealousy, before she gives the least occasion for't, is to set a complaisant rival in too favourable a light. Sir, sir ! I must tell you, I have seen those have owed their success to nothing else. Don Car Say no more, I have been to blame ; but there shall be no more on't. San. But, sir, you forget that there are two ways for our hearts to get at ease ; when our mis tresses come to be very fond of us, or we, not to care a fig for them. Now suppose, upon the rebukes you know he has had, it should chance to be the latter. Don Car. Again thy ignorance appears. Alas ! lover who has broke his chain will shun the Jac. I should punish you but justly, however, for what's past, if I carried back what I have brought you ; but I'm good-natured, so here 'tis ; open it, and see how wrong you timed your jea lousy ! Don Car.

For my part, master, I'm not so great a philosopher as you be, nor (thank my stars) so bitter a lover, but what I see \u2014 that I generally believe ; and when Jacinta tells me she loves me dearly, I have good thoughts enough of my person never to doubt the truth on't.

I'm glad I have found you at last ; I believe I have travelled five miles after you, and could neither find you at home, nor in the walks, nor at church, nor at the opera, nor \u2014 San. Nor anywhere else, where he was not to be found. If you had looked for him where he was, 'twas ten to one but you had met with him. Jac. I had, Jack-a-dandy ! Don Car. But, prithee, what's the matter? who sent you after me ? Jac. One who's never well but when she sees you, I think ; 'twas my lady. San. True flesh and blood, every inch of her, for all that. Don Car. [Reads again.] And if you prevail with him to lay his commands upon me, you shall be as happy as my obedience to 'em can make you. \u2014 O happy, happy Carlos ! \u2014 But what shall I say to thee for this welcome message ?

Hold, sir; pray leave a little something for our board-wages. \u2014 [To Jacinta.] You can't carry 'em all, I believe : shall I ease thee of this ? [Offering to take the purse. Don Car. Dear Jacinta, I fain would flatter myself, but am not able ; the blessing's too great to be my lot. Yet 'tis not well to trifle with me : how short soe'er I am in other merit, the tender ness I have for Leonora claims something from her generosity. I should not be deluded. Jac. And why do you think you are ? methinks she's pretty well above-board with you. What must be done more to satisfy you ? \u25a0San. Why, Lorenzo must hang himself, and Jac. No ; but you may carry \u2014 that, sirrah. [Giving him a box on the ear. San. The jade's grown purse-proud already. Don Car.

Shall I draw him on a Scotch pair of boots, mas ter, and make him tell all ? Jac. Enough. But I must begone ; success attend you with the old gentleman. Good-bye t'ye, sir. Don Car. Some questions I must ask him; call him hither. Don Car. Eternal blessings follow thee ! [Exit Jacinta. San. Hem, Lopez, hem ! San. I think she has taken 'em all with her ; the jade has got her apron full. Enter Locez, Lop. Who calls ? San. I and my master. Lop. I can't stay. San. You can indeed, sir. [Laying hold on him. Don Car. Is not that Lorenzo coming this way ? San. Yes, 'tis he ; for my part now I pity the poor gentleman. Enter Don Lorenzo. Don Car. Whither in such haste, honest Lopez ? What ! upon some love-errand ? Lop. Sir, your servant ; I ask your pardon, but I was going \u2014 Don Car. I guess where ; but you need not be shy of me any more, thy master and I are no longer rivals ; I have yielded up thi cause ; the lady will have it so, so I submit. Lop. Is it possible, sir ? Shall I then live to see my master and you friends again ?. San. Yes ; and what's better, thou and I shall be friends too. There will be no more fear of Christian bloodshed, I give thee up, Jacinta ; she's a slippery housewife, so master and I are going to match ourselves elsewhere. Don Car. I'll let him see at last I can be cheer ful too. \u2014 Your servant, Don Lorenzo ; how do you do this morning ? Don Lor. I thank you, Don Carlos, perfectly well, both in body and in mind. Don Car. What ! cured of your love then ? Don Lor. No, nor I hope I never shall. May I ask you how 'tis with yours ? Don Car. Increasing every hour ; we are very constant both. Don Lor. I find so much delight in being so I hope I never shall be otherwise. Don Car. Those joys 1 am well acquainted with, but should lose 'em soon were I to meet a cool reception. Lop. But is it possible, sir, your honour should be in earnest ? I'm afraid you are pleased to be merry with your poor humble servant. Don Car. I'm not at present much disposed to mirth, my indifference in this matter is not so thoroughly formed ; but my reason has so far mastered my passion, to show me 'tis in vain to pursue a woman whose heart already is another's. 'Tis what I have so plainly seen of late, I have roused my resolution to my aid, and broke my chains for ever. Don Lor. That's every generous lover's case, no doubt ; an angel could not fire my heart but with an equal flame. Don Car. And yet you said you still loved Leo nora. Don Lor. And yet I said I loved her. Don Car. Does she then return you \u2014 Don Lor. Everything my passion can require. Don Car. Its wants are small, I find. Don Lor. Extended as the heavens. Don Car. I pity you. Lop. Well, sir, to be plain with you, this is the joyfullest news I have heard this long time ; for I always knew you to be a mighty honest gentleman, and good faith it often went to the heart o' me to see you so abused. Dear, dear, have I often said to myself (when they have had a private meeting just after you have been gone) \u2014 Don Car. Ha! Don Lor. He must be a deity that does so. Don Car. Yet I'm a mortal, and once more can pity you. Alas ! Lorenzo, 'Tis a poor cordial to an aching heart, To have the tongue alone announce it happy : Besides 'tis mean, you should be more a man. Don Lor. I find I have made you an unhappy one, So can forgive the boilings of your spleen. Don Car. This seeming calmness might have the effect your vanity proposes by it, had I not a testimony of her love would (should I show it) sink you to the centre. Don Lor. Yet still I'm calm as ever. San. Hold, master, don't kill him yet. [Aside to Don Carlos. Lop. I say 1 have said to myself, what wicked things are women, and what pity it is they should be suffered in a Christian country I what a shame they should be allowed to play will-in-the-wisp with men of honour, and lead them through thorns and briars, and rocks, and rugged ways, till their hearts are torn in pieces, like an old coat in a fox chase ! I say, I have said to myself \u2014 Don Car. Thou hast said enough to thyself, but say a little more to me. Where were these secret meetings thou talkest of? Lop. In sundry places, and by divers ways ; sometimes in the cellar, sometimes in the garret, sometimes in the court, sometimes in the gutter ; but the place where the kiss of kisses was given was \u2014 Don Car. Nay, then have at your peace. Read that, and end the farce. [Gives him Leonora's letter. Don Lor. [After reading.] I have read it. Don Car. And know the hand ? Dun Lor.

Ay, o' my conscience had you. Don Car. Here's mystery in this \u2014 I like it not. San. I see his man and confidant there, Lopez. Don Car. In hell ! Lop. Sir ! Don Car.

Lop. I don't know but I may, sir. \u2014 [Aside.] What the devil's the matter now ! Don Car. O torment ! \u2014 But give me more on't ' when, how, to who, where ? Lop. Yesterday, to Leonora, by the parson in the pantry. Don Car. Look to't, if this be false, thy life shall pay the torment thou hast given me. Begone ! Lop. With the body and the soul o'me. [Exit. San. Base news, master. Don Car. Now my insulting rival's smile speaks out : O cursed, cursed woman ! Don Cor. There's not one word of truth in all thy cursed tongue has uttered. Lop. No, sir, I \u2014 I \u2014 believe there is not. Don Car. Why then didst thou say it, wretch ? Lop. Oh\u2014 only in jest, sir. Don Car. I am not in a jesting condition. Lop. Nor I \u2014 at present, sir. Don Car. Speak then the truth, as thou wouldst do it at the hour of death. Re-enter Jacinta. Jac. I'm come in haste to tell you, sir, that as soon as the moon's up, my lady '11 give you a meet ing in the close-walk by the back-door of the garden ; she thinks she has something to propose to you will certainly get her father's consent to marry you. Lop. Yes, at the gallows, and be turned off as soon as I've done. [Aside. Don Car. What's that you murmur ? Lop. Nothing but a short prayer. Don Car. [Aside.] I am distracted, and fright the wretch from telling me what I am upon the rack to know. \u2014 [Aloud.] Forgive me, Lopez, I am to blame to speak thus harshly to thee. Let this obtain thy pardon. \u2014 [Gif es him money.] Thou seest I am disturbed. Don Car. Past sufferance ! This aggravation is not to be borne. Go, thank her \u2014 with my curses. Fly ! \u2014 And let 'em blast her, while their venom's strong. [Exit. Jac. Won't thou explain ? What's this storm for ? San. And darest thou ask me questions, smooth faced iniquity, crocodile of Nile, siren of the rocks ! Go, carry back the too gentle answer thou hast received ; only let me add with the poet : \u2014 We are no fools, trollop, my master, nor me ; And thy mistress may go \u2014 to the devil with thee. Lop. Yes, sir, I see I have been led into a snare ; I have said too much. Don Car. And yet thou must say more ; nothing can lessen my torment but a farther knowledge of what causes my misery. Speak then ! have I any thing to hope ? Lop. Nothing ; but that you may be a happier bachelor than my master may probably be a mar ried man. [Exit. Jac. Am I awake ! \u2014 I fancy not ; a very idle dream this. Well : I'll go talk in my sleep to my lady about it ; and when 1 awake, we'll try what interpretation we can make on't. [Exit. Don Car.

SCENE I. \u2014 An open court near the House of Don Alvarez. before I say any more, you must resolve one doubt) which often gives me great disturbance ; whether Don Alvarez ever was himself privy to the mys tery which has disguised my sex, and made me pass for his son ? Isab. What you ask me is a thing has often perplexed my thoughts as well as yours, nor could my mother ever resolve the doubt. You know when that young child Camillo died, in whom was wrapped up so much expectation, from the great estate his uncle's will (even before he came into the world) had left him ; his mother made a secret of his death to her husband Alvarez, and readily fell in with a proposal made her to take you (who then were just Camillo's age) and bring you up in his room. You have heard how you were then at nurse with my mother, and how your own was privy and consenting to the plot ; but Don Alvarez was never let into it by 'em, Cam. Don't you then think it probable his wife might after tell him ? Isab. 'Twas ever thought nothing but a death bed repentance could draw it from her to any one; and that was prevented by the suddenness of her exit to t'other world, which did not give her even time to call Heaven's mercy on her. And yet} now I have said all this, I own the correspondence and friendship I observe he holds with your real mother gives me some suspicion, and the presents he often makes her (which people seldom do for Enter Cabhllo and Isabella. Isab. How can you doubt my secrecy ? have you not proofs of it ? Cam. Nay, I am determined to trust you; but are we safe here ? can nobody overhear us? Isab. Safer much than in a room. Nobody can come within hearing before we see 'em. Cam. And yet how hard 'tis for me to break silence ! Isab. Your secret sure must be of great import ance. Cam. You may be sure it is, when I confess 'tis with regret I own it e'en to you ; and, were it possible, you should not know it. Isab. 'Tis frankly owned indeed; but 'tis not kind, perhaps not prudent, after what you know I already am acquainted with. Have I not been bred up with you ? and am I ignorant of a secret which, were it known \u2014 Cam. Would be my ruin; I confess it would. I own you know why both my birth and sex are thus disguised ; you know how I was taken from my cradle to secure the estate which had else been lost by young Camillo's death ; but which is now safe in Day supposed father's hands, by my passing for his son; and 'tis because you know all this, I have resolved to open farther wonders to you. But,"], [538, "THE MISTAKE, 444 ACT II. nothing) confirm it. But, since this is all I can say to you on that point, pray let us come to the secret, which you have made me impatient to hear. Cam. Know, then, that though Cupid is blind, he is not to be deceived : I can hide my sex from the world, but not from him ; his dart has found the way through the manly garb I wear, to pierce a virgin's tender heart. \u2014 I love \u2014 Isab. How ! Cam. Lovers think no farther. The object of that passion possesses all desire. However, I have opened to you my wondrous situa tion, if you can advise me in my difficulties to come, you will But see\u2014 my husband ! Enter Don Lorenzo. Don Lor. You look as if you were busy ; pray tell me if I interrupt you ; I'll retire. Cam. No, no, you have a right to interrupt us, since you were the subject of our discourse. Don Lor. Was I ? Cam. Nay, ben't surprised at that, I have other wonders for you. Isab. Quick, let me hear 'em. Cam. I love Lorenzo. Cam. You were ; nay, I'll tell you how you entertained us too. Isab. Lorenzo 1 Most nicely hit ! The very man from whom your imposture keeps this vast estate ; and who, on the first knowledge of your being a woman, would enter into possession of it. This is indeed a wonder. Don Lor. Perhaps I had as good avoid hearing that. Cam. You need not fear, it was not to your dis advantage ; I was commending you, and saying, if I had been a woman, I had been in danger ; nay I think I said I should infallibly have been in love with you. Don Lor. While such an if is in the way, you run no great risk in declaring ; but you'd be finely catched now, should some wonderful transforma tion give me a claim to your heart. Cam. Then, wonder farther still, I am his wife. Isab. Ha ! his wife ! Isab. His wife, Isabella ; and yet thou hast not all my wonders, I am his wife without his know ledge : he does not even know I am a woman. Isab. Madam, your humble servant ; if you please to go on, I won't interrupt you, indeed I won't. Cam. Not sorry for't at all, for I ne'er expect to find a mistress please me half so well as you would do, if I were yours. Don Lor. Since you are so well inclined to me in your wishes, sir, I suppose (as the fates have ordained it) you would have some pleasure in help ing me to a mistress, since you can't be mine your self. Cam. Then hear how these strange things have passed : Lorenzo, bound unregarded in my sister's chains, seemed in my eyes a conquest worth her care. Nor could I see him treated with eontempt without growing warm in his interest : I blamed Leonora for not being touched with his merit ; I blamed her so long, till I grew touched with it myself : and the reasons I urged to vanquish her heart insensibly made a conquest of my own. 'Twas thus, my friend, I fell. What was next to be done my passion pointed out ; my heart I felt was warmed to a noble enterprise, I gave it way, and boldly on it led me. Leonora's name and voice, in the dark shades of night, I borrowed, to engage the object of my wishes. I met him, Isa bella, and so deceived him ; he cannot blame me sure, for much I blessed him. But to finish this strange story : in short, I owned I long had loved ; out, finding my father most averse to my desires, I at last had forced myself to this secret corre spondence ; Cam. Indeed I should not. Don Lor. Then my obligation is but small to you. Cam. Why, would you have a woman, that is in love with you herself, employ her interest to help you to another ? Don Lor. No, but you being no woman might. Cam. Sir, 'tis as a woman I say what I do, and I suppose myself a woman when I design all these favours to you. Therefore, out of that supposition, I have no other good intentions to you thau you may expect from anyone that says, he's \u2014 sir, your humble servant. Don Lor. So, unless Heaven is pleased to work a miracle, and from a sturdy young fellow make you a kind-hearted young lady, I'm to get little by your good opinion of me. Cam- Yes, there is one means yet left (on this side a miracle) that would perhaps engage me, if with an honest oath you could declare, were I woman, I might dispute your heart, even with the first of my pretending sex. Don Lor. Then solemnly and honestly I swear, that had you been a woman, and I the master of the world, I think I should have laid it at your feet. Cam. Then honestly and solemnly I swear, henceforwards all your interest shall be mine. Don Lor. I have a secret to impart to you will quickly try your friendship. Cam. I have a secret to unfold to you will put you even to a fiery trial. Don Lor. What do you mean, Camillo ? Cam. I mean that I love where I never durst yet own it, yet where 'tis in your power to make me the happiest of \u2014 Don Lor. Explain, Camillo ; and be assured, if your happiness is in my power, 'tis in your own. I urged the mischiefs would attend the knowledge on't, I urged 'em so, he thought 'em full of weight, So yielded to observe what rules I gave him. They were, to pass the day with cold indifference, To avoid even sign or looks of intimacy, But gather for the still, the secret night, A flood of love To recompense the losses of the day. I will not trouble you with lovers' cares, Nor what contrivances we form'd to bring This toying to a solid bliss. Know only, when three nights we thus had pass'd, The fourth It was agreed should make us one for ever ; Each kept their promise, and last night has join'd us. Isab. Indeed your talents pass my poor extent ; You serious ladies are well form'd for business. What wretched work a poor coquette had made on't! But still there's that remains will try your skill ; You have your man, but \u2014"], [539, "THE MISTAKE. SCENE I. 445 Cam. Alas ! you promise me you know not what. Don Lor.

Alas ! it is your \u2014 Don Lor. Speak ! Cam I cannot yet ; farewell ! Don Lor. Hold '. pray speak it now. Cam, I must not : but when you tell me your secret, you shall know mine. Don Lor.

You see me as much enraged at it as you are yourself, yet my brain is roving after the cause, for something there must be ; never letter was received by man with more passion and transport ; I was almost as charming a goddess as yourself, only for bringing it. Yet when in a moment after I come with a message worth a dozen on't, never was witch so handled ; something must have passed between one and t'other, that's sure. Leo. Nothing could pass worth my inquiring after, since nothing could happen that can excuse his usage of me ; he had a letter under my hand which owned him master of my heart ; and till I contradicted it with my mouth he ought not to doubt the truth on't. Cam. Get that consent, and then we'll try who best will keep their oaths. Don Lor. I am content. Cam. And I. Adieu ! Don Lor. Farewell. [Exit. Enter Leonora and Jacinta. Leo. 'Tis enough : I will revenge myself this way, if it does but torment him. I shall be con tent to find no other pleasure in it Brother, you'll wonder at my change ; after all my ill usage of Lorenzo, I am determined to be his wife. Cam. How, sister ! so sudden a turn ? This inequality of temper indeed is not commendable. Leo. Your change, brother, is much more justly surprising ; you hitherto have pleaded for him strongly ; accused me of blindness, cruelty\", and pride ; and now I yield to your reasons, and resolve in his favour, you blame my compliance, and appear against his interest. Cam. I quit his service for what's dearer to me, yours. I have learned from sure intelligence, the attack he made on you was but a feint, and that his heart is in another's chain : I would not there fore see you so exposed, to offer up yourself to one who must refuse you. Leo. If that be all, leave me my honour to take care of; I am no stranger to his wishes ; he won't refuse me, brother, nor I hope will you, to tell him of my resolution : if you do, this moment with my own tongue (through all a virgin's blushes) I'll own to him I am determined in his favour. \u2014 You pause as if you'd let the task he on me. Cam. Neither on you, nor me ; 1 have a reason you are yet a stranger to. Jac. Nay, I confess, madam, I han't a word to say for him, I'm afraid he's but a rogue at bottom, as well ts my Shameless that attends him ; we are bit, by my troth, and haply well enough served, for listening to the glib tongues of the rascals. But be comforted, madam ; they'll fall into the hands of some foul sluts or other, before they die, that will set our account even with 'em. Leo. Well, let him laugh ; let him glory in what he has done : he shall see I have a spirit can use him as I ought. Jac. And let one thing be your comfort by the way, madam, that in spite of all your dear affec tions to him, you have had the grace to keep him at arm's end. You han't thanked me for't ; but good faith 'twas well 1 did not stir out of the chamber that fond night. For there are times the stoutest of us are in danger, the rascals wheedle so. Leo. In short my very soul is fired with his treatment : and if ever that perfidious monster should relent, though he should crawl like a poor worm beneath my feet, nay, plunge a dagger in his heart, to bleed for pardon ; I charge thee strictly, charge thee on thy life, thou do not urge a look to melt me toward him, but strongly buoy me up in brave resentment ; and if thou seest (which Heavens avert !) a glance of weakness in me, rouse to my memory the vile wrongs I've borne, and blazon them with skill in all their glaring colours. Jac. Madam, never doubt me ; I'm charged to the mouth with fury, and if ever I meet that fat traitor of mine, such a volley will I pour about his ears ! \u2014 Now Heaven prevent all hasty vows ; but in the humour I am, methinks I'd carry my maiden head to my cold grave with me, before I'd let it simper at the rascal. But soft! here comes your father. Know then there is a virgin young and tender, Whose peace and happiness so much are mine, I cannot see her miserable ; She loves him with that torrent of desire, That were the world resign'd her in his stead, She'd still be wretched. I will not pique you to a female strife, By saying you have not charms to tear him from her; But I would move you to a female softness, By telling you her death would wait your conquest. What I have more to plead is as a brother, I hope that gives me some small interest in you ; Whate'er it is, you see how I'd employ it. Leo You ne'er could put it to a harder service. I beg a little time to think : pray leave me to myself a while. Enter Don Alvarez. Don Alv. Leonora, I'd have you retire a little, and send your brother's tutor to me, Metaphrastus. \u2014 [Exeunt Leonora and Jacinta.] I'll try if I can discover, by his tutor, what 'tis that seems so much to work his brain of late ; for something more than common there plainly does appear, yet nothing sure that can disturb his soul, like what I have to torture mine on his account. Sure nothing in this world is worth a troubled mind ! What racks has avarice stretched me on ! I wanted Cam. I shall ; I only ask that you would think, And then you won't refuse me.

And I tell you, I hope to be as famous as any Virgil of 'em all, when I have been dead as long, and have no need of a better phrase than my own to tell you my meaning. Metaph. You ought however to make choice of the words most used by the best authors. Tu vivendo bonos, as they say, scribendo sequare peritos. Don Alv. Again ! Metaph. 'Tis Quintilian's own precept. Don Alv. Oons ! Enter Metaphrastus. Metaph. Mandatum tuum euro diligenter. Don Alv. Master, I had a mind to ask you \u2014 Metaph. The title, master, comes from magis and ter, which is as much as to say, thrice worthy. Don Alv. I never heard so much before, but it may be true for aught I know. But, master \u2014 Metaph. Go on. Don Alv. Why so I will if you'll let me, but don't interrupt me then. Metaph. Enough, proceed. Don Alv. Why then, master, for the third time, my son Camillo gives me much uneasiness of late ; you kn ow I love him , and have many careful thoughts about him. Metaph. And he has something very learned upon it, that may be of service to you to hear. Don Alv. You son of a whore, will you hear me speak ? Metaph. What may be the occasion of this un manly passion ? What is it you would have with me? Don Alv. What you might have known an hour ago, if you had pleased. Metaph. You would then have me hold my peace \u2014I shall. Metaph. 'Tis true. Filio non potest pr\u00e6ferri, nisifilius. Don Alv. Master, when one has business to talk on, these scholastic expressions are not of use ; I believe you a great Latinist ; possibly you may understand Greek ; those who recommended you to me, said so, and I am willing it should be true : but the thing I want to discourse you about at present, does not properly give you an occasion to display your learning. Besides, to tell you truth, 'twill at all times be lost upon me ; my father was a wise man, but he taught me nothing beyond com mon sense ; I know but one tongue in the world, which luckily being understood by you as well as me, I fancy whatever thoughts we have to com municate to one another, may reasonably be con veyed in that, without having recourse to the language of Julius C\u00e6sar. Metaph. You are wrong, but may proceed. Don Alv. I thank you. What is the matter I do not know ; but though it is of the utmost con sequence to me to marry my son, what match soever I propose to him, he still finds some pretence or other to decline it. Don Alv. You will do very well. Metaph. You see I do ; well, go on. Don Alv. Why then, to begin unce again, I say my son Camillo \u2014 Metaph. Proceed ; I shan't interrupt you. Don Alv. I say, my son Camillo \u2014 \u25a0 Metaph. What is it you say of your son Camillo ? Don Alv. That he has got a dog of a tutor, whose brains I'll beat out if he won't hear me speak. Metaph. That dog is a philosopher, contemns passion, and yet will hear you. Don Alv. I don't believe a word on't, but I'll try once again. I have a mind to know from you, whether you have observed anything in my son \u2014 Metaph. Nothing that is like his father. Goon. Don Alv. Have a care ! Metaph. I do not interrupt you ; but you are long in coming to a conclusion. Don Alv. Why, thou hast not let me begin yet ! Metaph. And yet it is high time to have made an end. Don Alv. Dost thou know thy danger ? I have not \u2014 thus much patience left. [Showing the endof his finger. Metaph. He is, perhaps, of the humour of a brother of Marcus Tullius, who \u2014 Don Alv. Dear master, leave the Greeks and the Latins, and the Scotch and the Welsh, and let me go on in my business ; what have those people to do with my son's marriage ? Metaph. Again you are wrong ; but go on. Don Alv. I say then, that I have strong appre hensions, from his refusing all my proposals, that he may have some secret inclination of his own ; and to confirm me in this fear, I yesterday observed him (without his knowing it) in a corner of the grove where nobody comes \u2014 Metaph. A place out of the way, you would say ; a place of retreat. Don Alv. Why, the corner of the grove, where nobody comes, is a place of retreat, is it not ? Metaph. In Latin, secessus. Don Ah. Ha ! Metaph. Mine is already consumed. I do not use to be thus treated ; my profession is to teach, and not to hear, yet I have hearkened like a school boy, and am not heard, although a master. Don Alv. Get out of the room ! Metaph. I will not. If the mouth of a wise man be shut, he is, as it were, a fool ; for who shall know his understanding? Therefore a certain philosopher said well, Speak, that thou mayest be known ; great talkers, without knowledge, are as the winds that whistle ; but they who have learning should speak aloud. If this be not permitted, we may expect to see the whole order of nature o'er thrown ; hens devour foxes, and lambs destroy wolves, nurses suck children, and children give suck ; generals mend stockings, and chambermaids take towns ; we may expect, I say \u2014 Don Ah. That, and that, and that, and \u2014 [Strikes him and kicks him. Metaph. As Virgil has it, Estinsecessu locus. Don Alv. How could Virgil have it, when I tell you no soul was there but he and I ?

But 'tis now too late ; my villany is out, and I shall not only be forced with shame to restore him what is his, but shall be perhaps condemned to make him reparation with my own. O terrible view ! SCENE I The Street before the House of Don Alvarez. Enter Lopez. Lop. Sometimes Fortune seconds a bold design, and when folly has brought us into a trap, impu dence brings us out on't. I have been caught by this hot-headed lover here, and have told like a puppy what I shall be beaten for like a dog. Come ! courage, my dear Lopez ; fire will fetch out fire. Thou hast told one body thy master's secret, e'en tell it to half-a-dozen more, and try how that will thrive; go tell it to the two old Dons, the lovers' fathers. The thing's done, and can't be retrieved ; perhaps they'll lay their two ancient heads together, club a pennyworth of wisdom a-piece, and with great penetration at last find out that 'tis best to submit where 'tis not in their power to do other wise. This being resolved, there's no time to be lost. [Knocks at Don Alvarez's door. Enter Don Felix. Don Fel. [Aside.] My son to go and marry her without her father's knowledge ! This can never end well. I don't know what to do, he'll conclude I was privy to it, and his power and interest are so great at court he may with ease contrive my ruin \u25a0 I tremble at his sending to speak with me. \u2014 Mercy on me, there he is ! Don Alv. [Aside.] Ah ! shield me, kind Hea ven ! there's Don Felix come. How I am struck with the sight of him ! Oh, the torment of a guilty mind ! Don Fel. What shall I say to soften him ? [Aside. Don Alv. How shall I look him in the face ? [Aside. Don Fel. 'Tis impossible he can forgive it. [Aside. Don Alv. [Within.] Who knocks ? Lop. Lopez. Don Alv. [Looking out.] What dost want ? Lop. To bid you good-morrow, sir. Don Alv. Well, good-morrow to thee again. [Retires. Don Alv. To be sure he'll expose me to the whole world. [Aside. Don Fel. I see his countenance change. [Aside. Don Alv. With what contempt he looks upon me ! [Aside. Don Fel. I see, Don Alvarez, by the disorder of your face you are but too well informed of what brings me here. Don Alv. 'Tis true. Lop. What a \u2014 I think he does not care for my company. [Knocks again. Don Alv. [ Within.] Who knocks ? Lop. Lopez. Don Alv. [Looking out.] What wouldst have ? Lop. My old master, sir, gives his service to you, and desires to know how you do. Don Alv. How I do ! why, well ; how should I do ? Service to him again. [Retires. Lop. Sir ! Don Alv. [Returning.] What the deuse wouldst thou have with me, with thy good-morrows and thy services ? Don Fel. The news may well surprise you, 'tis what I have been far from apprehending. Don Alv. Wrong, very wrong, indeed. Don Fel. The action is certainly to the last point to be condemned, and I think nobody should pretend to excuse the guilty. Don Alv. They are not to be excused, though Heaven may have mercy. Don Fel. That's what I hope you will consider. Don Alv. We should act as Christians. Lop. [Aside.] This man does not understand good breeding, I find. \u2014 [Aloud.] Why, sir, my master has some very earnest business with you. Don Alv. Business ! about what ? What busi ness can he have with me ? Don Fel. Most certainly. Don Alv. Let mercy then prevail. Don Fel. It is indeed of heavenly birth. Don Alv. Generous Don Felix ! Don Fel. Too indulgent Alvarez I Don Alv. I thank you on my knee. Don Fel. 'Tis I ought to have been there first. [They kneel. Lop. I don't know, truly ; but 'tis some very important matter. He has just now (as I hear) discovered some great secret, which he must needs talk with you about. Don Alv. Ha ! a secret, sayest thou ? Lop. Yes ; and bid me bring him word if you were at home, he'd be with you presently. Sir, your humble servant. [Exit. Don Alv. Is it then possible we are friends ? Don Fel. Embrace me to confirm it. [They embrace. Don Alv. Thou best of men ! Don Fel. Unlooked-for bounty ! Don Alv. [Rising.] Did you know the torment this unhappy action has given me \u2014 Don Fel. 'Tis impossible it could do otherwise ; nor has my trouble been less. Don Alv. But let my misfortune be kept secret. Don Fel. Most willingly ; my advantage is suf ficient by it, without the vanity of making it public to the world. Don Alv. [Aside.] Incomparable goodness ! That I should thus have wronged a man so worthy \u2014 [Aloud.] My honour then is safe : Enter Don Alvarez, from the house. Don Alv. A secret ; and must speak with me about it ! Heavens, how I tremble ! What can this message mean ? I have very little acquaint ance with him, what business can he have with me ? An important secret 'twas, he said, and that he had just discovered it. Alas ! I have in the world but one, if it be that \u2014 I'm lost ; an eternal blot must fix upon me. How unfortunate am I, that I have not followed the honest counsels of my heart, which have often urged me to set my conscience at ease, by rendering to him the estate that is his due, and"], [542, "448 THE MISTAKE ACT 111, Don Fel. For ever, even for ever let it be a secret, I am content. Enter Don Lorenzo. So, sir, are you come to receive my thanks for your noble exploit ? You think you have done bravely now, ungracious offspring, to bring per petual troubles on me ! Must there never pass a day, but I must drink some bitter potion or other of your preparation for me ? Don Lor. I am amazed, sir ; pray what have I done to deserve your anger? Don Fel. Nothing, no manner of thing in the world ; nor never do. I am an old testy fellow, and am always scolding, and finding fault for nothing ; complaining that I have got a coxcomb of a son that makes me weary of my life, fancying he perverts the order of nature, turning day into night, and night into day ; getting whims in my brain, that he consumes his life in idleness, unless he rouses now and then to do some noble stroke of mischief ; and having an impertinent dream at this time, that he has been making the fortune of the family, by an underhand marriage with the daughter of a man who will crush us all to powder for it. Ah \u2014 ungracious wretch, to bring an old man into all this trouble ! The pain thou gavest thy mother to bring thee into the world, and the plague thou hast given me to keep thee here, make the getting thee (though 'twas in our honey moon) a bitter remembrance to us both. [Exit. Don Lor. So, all's out ! \u2014 Here's a noble storm arising, and I'm at sea in a cock-boat ! But which way could this business reach him ? by this traitor Lopez \u2014 it must be so ; it could be no other way ; for only he, and the priest that married us, know of it. The villain will never confess though : I must try a little address with him, and conceal my anger. \u2014 Oh ! here he comes. Don Alv. [Aside.] Noble gentleman! \u2014 [Aloud.] As to what advantages ought to accrue to you by it, it shall be all to your entire satisfaction. DonFel. [Aside.] Wonderfulbounty! \u2014 [Aloud.] As to that, Don Alvarez, I leave it entirely to you, and shall be content with whatever you think reasonable. Don Alv. I thank you, from my soul I must, you know I must.- \u2014 [Aside.] This must be an angel, not a man. Don Fel. The thanks lie on my side, Alvarez, for this unexpected generosity ; but may all faults be forgot, and Heaven ever prosper you ! Don Alv. The same prayer I, with a double fervour, offer up for you. Don Fel. Let us then once more embrace, and be forgiveness sealed for ever. Don Alv. Agreed ; thou best of men, agreed. [They embrace. Don Fel. This thing then being thus happily terminated, let me own to you, Don Alvarez, I was in extreme apprehensions of your utmost resentment on this occasion ; for I could not doubt but you had formed more happy views in the disposal of so fair a daughter as Leonora, than my poor son's inferior fortune e'er can answer : but since they are joined, and that \u2014 Don Alv. Ha ! Don Fel. Nay, 'tis very likely to discourse of it may not be very pleasing to you, though your Chris tianity and natural goodness have prevailed on you so generously to forgive it. But to do justice to Leonora, and screen her from your too harsh opinion in this unlucky action, 'twas that cunning wicked creature that attends her, who by unusual arts wrought her to this breach of duty, for her own inclinations were disposed to all the modesty and resignation a father could ask from a daughter ; my son I can't excuse, but since your bounty does so. I hope you'll quite forget the fault of the less guilty Leonora. Don. Alv. [Aside.] What a mistake have I lain under here ! and from a groundless apprehension of one misfortune, find myself in the certainty of another. Re-enter Lopez. Lopez ! Lop. Do you call, sir ? Don Lor. I find all's discovered to my father ; the secret's out ; he knows my marriage. Lop. He knows your marriage ! \u2014 How the pest should that happen ? Sir, 'tis impossible 1 \u2014 that's all. Don Lor. I tell thee 'tis true ; he knows every particular of it. Lop. He does ! \u2014 Why then, sir, all I can say is, that Satan and he are better acquainted than the devil and a good Christian ought to be. Don Lor. Which way he has discovered it I can't tell, nor am I much concerned to know, since, beyond all my expectations, I find him per fectly easy at it, and ready to excuse my fault with better reasons than I can find to do it myself. Lop. Say you so ? \u2014 I'm very glad to hear that ; then all's safe. [Aside. Don Fel. He looks disturbed ; what can this mean ? [Aside. Don Alv. [Aside.] My daughter married to his son ! \u2014 Confusion ! But I find myself in such unruly agitation, something wrong may happen if I con tinue with him ; I'll therefore leave him. Don Fel. You seem thoughtful, sir ; I hope there's no \u2014 Don Alv. A sudden disorder I am seized with ; you'll pardon me, I must retire. [Exit. Don Fel. I don't like this : \u2014 he went oddly off. \u2014 I doubt he finds this bounty difficult to go through with. His natural resentment is making an attack upon his acquired generosity : pray Heaven it ben't too strong for't. The misfortune is a great one, and can't but touch him nearly. It was not natural to be so calm ; I wish it don't yet drive him to my ruin. But here comes this young hot-brained coxcomb, who with his midnight amours has been the cause of all this mischief to me. Don Lor. 'Tis unexpected good fortune ; but it could never proceed purely from his own temper ; there must have been pains taken with him to bring him to this calm. I'm sure I owe much to the bounty of some friend or other ; I wish I knew where my obligation lay, that I might acknowledge it as I ought. Lop. [Aside.] Are you thereabouts, i'faith? Then sharp's the word ; egad I'll own the thing, and receive his bounty for't. \u2014 [Aloud.] Why, sir \u2014 not that I pretend to make a merit o' the matter, for, alas ! I am but your poor hireling, and there-"], [543, "THE MISTAKE.

Now methinks, sir, if you treated your son-in-law with a little more civility, things might go just as well in the main. Don Lor. What hast thou done ? Lop. What no man else could have done \u2014 the job, sir ; told him the secret, and then talked him into a liking on't. Don Lor. 'Tis impossible ; thou dost not tell me Don Alv. What means this insolent fellow by my son-in-law ! I suppose 'tis you, villain, are the author of this impudent story. Lop. You seem angry, sir ; \u2014 perhaps without cause. true. Lop. Sir, I scorn to reap anything from another man's labours ; but if this poor piece of service car ries any merit with it, you now know where to reward it. Don Alv. Cause, traitor ! Is a cause wanting, where a daughter's defamed, and a noble family scandalised ? Don Lor. Thou art not serious ? Lop. I am, or may hunger be my messmate ! Don Lor. And may famine be mine, if I don't reward thee for't as thou deservest ! \u2014 Dead ! Lop. There he is, let him answer you. Don Alv. I should be glad he'd answer me: why, if he had any desires to my daughter, he did not make his approaches like a man of honour. Lop. Yes ; and so have had the doors bolted against him, like a house-breaker. [Aside. Don Lor. Sir, to justify my proceeding, I have little to say ; but to excuse it, I have much, if any allowance may be made to a passion which, in your youth, you have yourself been swayed by. I love your daughter to that excess \u2014 Don Alv. You would undo her for a night's lodging. Don Lor. Undo ber, sir ! [Making a pass at him. Lop. Have a care there ! \u2014 [Leaping on one side.] What do you mean, sir? I bar all sur prise. Don Lor. Traitor ! is this the fruit of the trust I placed in thee, villain ! [Making another thrust at him. Lop. Take heed, sir ! you'll do one a mischief before y'are aware. Don Lor. What recompense canst thbu make me, wretch, for this piece of treachery ? Thy sordid blood can't expiate the thousandth ! \u2014 But I'll have it, however. [Thrusts again. Don Alv. Yes, that's the word. You knew it was against her interest to marry you, therefore you endeavoured to win her to't in private ; you knew her friends would make a better bargain for her, therefore you kept your designs from their knowledge, and yet you love her to that excess \u2014 Don Lor. I'd readily lay down my life to serve her. Lop. Look you there again ! Pray, sir, be quiet ; is the devil in you ? \"sis bad jesting with edged tools. Egad, that last push was within an inch o'me ! I don't know what you make all this bustle about; but I'm sure I've done all for the best, and I believe 'twill prove for the best too at last, if you'll have but a little patience. But if gentlemen will be in their airs in a moment Why, what the deuse \u2014 I'm sure I have been as eloquent as Cicero in your behalf! and I don't doubt, to good purpose too, if you'll give things time to work. But nothing but foul language, and naked swords about the house ! \u2014 Sa, sa ! run you through, you dog ! Why nobody can do business at this rate. Don Alv. Could you readily lay down fifty thou sand pistoles to serve her, your excessive love would come with better credentials : an offer of life is very proper for the attack of a counterscarp, but a thou sand ducats will sooner carry a lady's heart. You are a young man, but will learn this when you are older. Lop. But since things have succeeded better this once, sir, and that my master will prove a most incomparable good husband (for that he'll do, I'll answer for him), and that 'tis too late to recal what's already done, sir \u2014 Don Alv. What's done, villain ? Don Lor. And suppose your project fail, and I'm ruined by't, sir ! Lop. Why, ' twill be time enough to kill me then , sir ; won't it ? What should you do it for now ? Besides, I an't ready, I'm not prepared ; I might be undone by't. Don Lor. But what will Leonora say to her marriage being known, wretch ? Lop. Why maybe she'll draw \u2014 her sword too. \u2014 [Showing his tongue.] But all shall be well with you both, if you will but let me alone. Don Lor. Peace ! here's her father. Lop. Sir, I mean \u2014 that since my master and my lady are married, and \u2014 Don Alv. Thou best ! they are not married. Lop. Sir, I say \u2014 that since they are married, aud that they love each other so passing dearly \u2014 indeed, I fancy \u2014 that \u2014 Don Alv. Why, this impudence is beyond all bearing ! Sir, do you put your rascal upon this ? Don Lor. Sir, I am in a wood ! 1 don't know what it is you mean. Lop. That's well : we shall see how things go presently. Re-enter Don Alvarez. Don _ic. And I am in a plain, sir, and think I may be understood. Do you pretend you are married to my daughter ? Don Lor. Sir, 'tis my happiness on one side, as it is my misfortune on another. Don Alv. And you do think this idle project can succeed ? You do believe your affirming you are married to her will induce both her and me to consent it shall be so ? DonAlv. [Aside.] The more I recover from the dis order this discourse has put me in, the more strange the whole adventure appears to me. Leonora main tains there is not a word of truth in what I have heard ; that she knows nothing of marriage : and, indeed, she tells me this with such a naked air of sincerity, that, for my part, I believe her. What then must be their project ? Some villanous inten tion, to be sure ; though which way I yet am ignorant. \u2014 But here's the bridegroom ; I'll accost him.\u2014 [Aloud.] I am told, sir, you take upon you Lop. Sir, I see you make my master almost out of his wits to hear you talk so : but I, who am but a stander-by now, as I was at the wedding, have G G"], [544, "450 THE MISTAKE, ACT III. mine about me, and desire to know, whether you think this project can succeed ? Do you believe your affirming they are not married, will induce both him and I to give up the lady ? One short question to bring this matter to an issue, \u2014 why do you think they are not married ? Don Alv. Because she utterly renounces it. Lop. And so she will her religion, if you attack it with that dreadful face. D'ye hear, sir? the poor lady is in love heartily, and I wish all poor ladies that are so, would dispose of themselves so well as she has done ; but you scare her out of her senses. Bring her here into the room, speak gently to her, tell her you know the thing is done, that you have it from a man of honour, \u2014 me : that maybe you wish it had been otherwise, but are a Christian, and profess mercy, and therefore have resolved to pardon her. Say this, and I shall appear a man of reputation, and have satisfaction made me. love ; I humbly am content to owe the blessing to your generosity ; You saw the pains I suffer'd for your sake, And in compassion eased 'em. Leo. I did, sir ! Sure this exceeds all human impudence! Lop. Truly, I think it does. She'd make an in comparable actress. [Aside. Don Lor. I begin to be surprised, madam, at your carrying this thing so far ; you see there's no occasion for it ; and for the discovery, I have already told you 'twas not my fault. Lop. My master's ! no, 'twas I did it. Why, what a bustle's here ! I knew things would go well, and so they do, if folks would let 'em. But if ladies, will be in their merriments, when gentle men are upon serious business, why what a deuse can one say to 'em ! Leo. I see this fellow is to be an evidence in your plot. Where you hope to drive, it is hard to guess ; for if anything can exceed its impudence, it is its folly. A noble stratagem indeed to win a lady by ! I could be diverted with it, but that I see a face of villany requires a rougher treatment : I could almost, methinks, forget my sex, and be my own avenger. Don Alv. Or an impudent rogue, and have all your bones broke. Lop. Content! Don Alv. Agreed ! \u2014 Leonora ! \u2014 Who's there ? call Leonora. Lop. All will go rarely, sir ; we shall have shot the gulf in a moment. [Aside to Lorenzo. Don Lor. Madam, I am surprised beyond all \u2014 Lop. Pray, sir, let me come to her ; you are so surprised you'll make nothing on't : she wants a little snubbing. \u2014 Look you, madam, I have seen many a pleasant humour amongst ladies, but you outcut 'em all. Here's contradiction with a ven geance ! You han't been married eight-and-forty hours, and you are slap \u2014 at your husband's beard already. Why, do you consider who he is ?\u25a0 \u2014 who this gentleman is ? \u2014 and what he can do \u2014 by law ? Why, he can lock you up \u2014 knock you down \u2014 tie you neck and heels\u2014 Don Lor. Forbear, you insolent villain, you ! [Offering to strike him. Enter Leonora. Don Alv. Come hither, Leonora. Lop. So, now we shall see. Don Alv. I called you to answer for youself ; here's a strong claim upon you ; if there be any thing in the pretended title, conceal it no farther, it must be known at last, it may as well be so now. Nothing is so uneas.y as uncertainty, I would there fore be gladly freed from it. If you have done what I am told you have, 'tis a great fault indeed ; but as I fear 'twill carry much of its punishment along with it, I shall rather reduce my resentment into mourning your misfortune, than suffer it to add to your affliction ; therefore speak the truth. Lop. Well, this is fair play ; now I speak, sir. \u2014 You see, fair lady, the goodness of a tender father, nothing need therefore hinder you from owning a most loving husband. We had like to have been all together by the ears about this business, and pails of blood were ready to run about the house : but thank Heaven, the sun shines out again, and one word from your sweet mouth makes fair weather for ever. My master has been forced to own your marriage, he begs you'll do so too. Leo. What does this impudent rascal mean ? Lop. Ha ! \u2014 madam ! Leo. [To Don Lorenzo] Sir, I should be very glad to know what can have been the occasion of this wild report ; sure you cannot be yourself a party in it I Lop. He, he \u2014 Don Lor. Forgive me, dear Leonora, I know you had strong reasons for the secret being longer kept ; but 'tis not my fault, our marriage is disclosed. Leo. Our marriage, sir ! \u2014 Don Lor. 'Tis known, my dear, though much against my will ; but since it is so, 'twould be in vain for us to deny it longer. Leo. Then, sir, I am your wife ? I fell in love with you, and married you without my father's knowledge ? Don Lor. I dare not be so vain to think 'twas Leo. That \u2014 for what's past however. [Giving him a box on the ear. Lop. I think \u2014 she gave me a box o' th' ear ; ha !\u25a0 \u2014 [Exit Leonora.] Sir, will you suffer your old servants to be used thus by new comers ? It's a shame, a mere shame. Sir, will you take a poor dog's advice for once ? She denies she's married to you : take her at her word ; you have seen some of her humours, \u2014 let her go. Don Alv. Well, gentlemen, thus far you see I have heard all with patience ; have you content ? or how much farther do you design to go with this business ? Lop. Why truly, sir, I thinkwe arenearat astand. Don Alv. 'Tis time, you villain you ! Lop. Why and I am a villain now, if every word I've spoke be not as true as \u2014 as the Gazette : and your daughter's no better than a \u2014 a \u2014 a whimsical young woman, for making disputes among gentle men. And if everybody had their deserts, she'd have a good \u2014 I won't speak it out to inflame reckonings ; but let her go, master. Don Alv. Sir, I don't think it well to spend any more words with your impudent and villanous ser vant here. Lop. Thank you, sir : but I'd let her go. Don Alv. Nor have I more to say to you than this, that you must not think so daring an affront to my family can go long unresented. Farewell ! [Exit."], [545, "THE MISTAKE. SCENE I. 451 Don Lor. Well, sir, what have you to say for yourself now ? Lop. Why, sir, I have only to say, that I am a very unfortunate\u2014 middle-aged man ; and that I believe all the stars upon heaven and earth have been concerned in my destiny. Children now un born will hereafter sing my downfal in mournful lines, and notes of doleful tune : I am at present troubled in mind, despair around me, signified in appearing gibbets, with a great bundle of dog-whips by way of preparation. I therefore will go seek some mountain high. If high enough some mountain may be found, With distant valley, dreadfully profound, And from the horrid cliff \u2014 look calmly all around. Farewell ! Don Lor. No, sirrah : I'll see your wretched end myself. Die here, villain ! [Drawing his sword. Lop. I can't, sir, if anybody looks upon me. Don Lor. Away, you trifling wretch ! but think not to escape, for thou shalt have thy recompense. [Exit. Lop. Why, what a mischievous jade is this, to make such an uproar in a family the first day of her marriage ! Why, my master won't so much as get a honeymoon out of her ! Egad, I'd let her go. If she be thus in her soft and tender youth, she'll be rare company at threescore. Well, he may do as he pleases ; but were she my dear, I'd let her go \u2014 such afoot at her tail, I'd make the truth bounce out at her mouth like a pellet out of a pot-gun. [Exit. ACT IV. SCENE I A Street. Don Carlos. He'll but disturb us now, let us avoid him. [Exeunt. [Exeunt. Enter Camillo and Isabella. Enter Don Carlos and Sancho. Isab. 'Tis an unlucky accident indeed 1 Cam. Ah, Isabella, fate has now determined my undoing ! This thing can ne'er end here ; Leonora and Lorenzo must soon come to some explanation; the dispute is too monstrous to pass over without further inquiry, which must discover all, and what will be the consequence I tremble at. For whether Don Alvarez knows of the imposture, or whether he is deceived with the rest of the world, when once it breaks out, and that the consequence is the loss of that great wealth he now enjoys by it, what must become of me ? All paternal affections then must cease, and regarding me as an unhappy instrument in the trouble which will then o'erload him, he will return me to my humble birth, and then I'm lost for ever. For what, alas ! will the deceived Lo renzo say ? A wife, with neither fortune, birth, nor beauty, instead of one most plenteously en dowed with all. O Heavens ! what a sea of misery I have before me ! Don Car. Repulsed again ! this is not to be borne. What though this villain's story be a false hood, was I to blame to hearken to it ? This usage cannot be supported : how was it she treated thee ? San. Never was ambassador worse received. Madam, my master asks ten thousand pardons, and humbly begs one moment's interview : \u2014 Begone, you rascal you ! Madam, what answer shall I give my master ? \u2014 Tell him he's a villain. Indeed, fair lady, I think this is hasty treatment. \u2014 Here, my footmen ! toss me this fellow out at the window ; \u2014 and away she went to her devotions. Don Car. Did you see Jacinta ? San. Yes ; she saluted me with half-a-score rogues and rascals too. I think our destinies are much alike, sir : and, o' my conscience, a couple of scurvy jades we are hampered with. Don Car. Ungrateful woman ! to receive with such contempt so quick a return of a heart so justly alarmed. San. Ha! ha ! ha! Isab. Indeed you reason right, but these reflec tions are ill-timed ; why did you not employ them sooner P Don Car. What, no allowance to be made to the first transports of a lover's fury, when roused by so dreadful an appearance ! As just as my sus picions were, have I long suffered 'em to arraign her? Cam. Because I loved. Isab. And don't you do so now ? Cam. I do, and therefore 'tis I make these cruel just reflections. Isab. So that love, I find, can do anything. Cam. Indeed it can. Its powers are wondrous great, its pains no tongue can tell, its bliss no heart conceive, crowns cannot recompense its tor ments, heaven scarce supplies its joys. My stake is of this value. Oh, counsel me how I shall save it ! San. No. Don Car. Have I waited for oaths or impreca tions to clear her ? San. No. Don Car. Nay, even now is not the whole world still in suspense about her ? whilst I alone conclude her innocent. Isab. Alas ! that counsel's much beyond my wisdom's force, I see no way to help you. Cam. And yet 'tis sure there's one. Isab. What? San. 'Tis very true. Don Car. She might, methinks, through this profound respect, Observe a flame another would have cherish'd ; She might support me against groundless fears, And save me from a rival's tyranny ; She might release me from these cruel racks, And would, no doubt, if she could love as I do. San. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Cam. Death. Isab. There possibly may be another; I have a thought this moment \u2014 perhaps there's nothing in it ; yet a small passage comes to my remembrance, that I regarded little when it happened \u2014 I'll go and search for one may be of service.

Master, let us show ourselves men, and leave their briny tears to wash their dirty faces. Don Car. It is not in the power of charms to move me. Curse on the base humilities of love ! San. Right. Don Car. Let children kiss the rod that flays 'em, Let dogs lie down, and lick the shoe that spurns 'em. San. Ay- Don Car. I am a man by nature meant for San. Nor me, I hope ; and yet I fear those eyes Will look out sharp to snatch up such a prize. [Pointing lo Jacinta. Jac. He's coming to us, madam, to beg pardon ; but sure you'll never grant it him !

True, we are men, boo ! \u2014 Come, master, let us both be in a passion ; here's my sceptre. \u2014 [Showing a cudgel.] Subject Jacinta, look about you. Sir, was you ever in Muscovy ? the women there love the men dearly ; why ? because \u2014 [shaking his stick] there's your love-powder for you. Ah, sir, were we but wise and stout, what work should we make with them ! But this humble love-making spoils 'em all. A rare way indeed to bring mat ters about with 'em ! We are persuading 'em all day they are angels and goddesses, in order to use 'em at night like human creatures ; we are like to succeed truly ! Don Car. For my part, I never yet could bear a slight from anything, nor will I now. There's but one way, however, to resent it from a woman ; and that's to drive her bravely from your heart, and place a worthier in her vacant throne. San. Now, with submission to my betters, I have another way, sir ; I'll drive my tyrant from my heart, and place myself in her throne. Yes ; I will be lord of my own tenement, and keep my household in order. Would you would do so too, master ! For, look you, I have been servitor in a college at Salamanca, and read philosophy with the doctors ; where I found that a woman, in all times, has been observed to be an animal hard to understand, and much inclined to mischief. Now, as an animal is always an animal, and a captain always a captain, so a woman is always a woman : whence it is that a certain Greek says, her head is like a bank of sand ; or, as another, a solid rock ; or, according to a third, a dark lantern. Pray, sir, observe, for this is close reasoning ; and so as the head is the head of the body ; and that the body without a head, is like a head without, a tail ; and that where there is neither head nor tail, 'tis a very strange body ; so I say a woman is by com parison, do you see, (for nothing explains things like comparisons,) I say by comparison, as Aris totle has often said before me, one may compare her to the raging sea. For as the sea, when the wind rises, knits its brows like an angry bull, and that waves mount upon rocks, and rocks mount upon waves ; that porpoises leap like trouts, and whales skip about like gudgeons ; that ships roll like beer-barrels, and mariners pray like saints ; just so, I say, awoman A woman, I say, just so, when her reason is shipwrecked upon her passion, and the hulk of her understanding lies thumping against the rock of her fury ; then it is, I say, that by certain immotions, which \u2014 um \u2014 cause, as one may suppose, a sort of convulsive \u2014 yes \u2014 hurri canious \u2014 um \u2014 like \u2014 in short, a woman is like the devil. Don Car. You look, madam, upon me as if you thought I came to trouble you with my usual importunities ; I'll ease you of that pain, by telling you, my business now is calmly to assure you, but I assure it you with heaven and hell for seconds ; for may the joys of one fly from me, whilst the pains of t'other overtake me, if all your charms displayed e'er shake my resolution ; I'll never see you more. San. Bon ! Leo. You are a man of that nice honour, sir, I know you'll keep your word : I expected this assurance from you, and came this way only to thank you for't. Jac. Very well ! Don Car. You did, imperious dame, you did ! How base is woman's pride ! How wretched are the ingredients it is formed of! If you saw cause for just disdain, why did you not at first repulse me ? Why lead a slave in chains, that could not grace your triumphs ? If I am thus to be con temned, think on the favours you have done the wretch, and hide your face for ever. San. Well argued. Leo. I own you have hit the only fault the world can charge me with : the favours I have done to you I am indeed ashamed of; but, since women have their frailties, you'll allow me mine. Don Car. 'Tis well, extremely well, madam. I'm happy, however, you at last speak frankly. I thank you for it ; from my soul I thank you : but don't expect me grovelling at your feet again ; don't, for if I do \u2014 Leo. You will be treated as you deserve ; trod upon. Don Car.

When jealousy proceeds from such humble apprehensions, it shows itself with more respect than yours has done. Don Car. And where a heart is guiltless, it easily forgives a greater crime. Leo. Forgiveness is not now in our debate ; if both have been in fault, 'tis fit that both should suffer for it ; our separation will do justice on us. Don Car. But since we are ourselves the judges of our crimes, what if we should inflict a gentler punishment ? Leo. 'Twould but encourage us to sin again. Don Car.

Nay, sir, what I say is purely for your safety ; for as to myself \u2014 uds-death, I no more value the losing a quart of blood than I do drink ing a quart of wine. Besides, my veins are too full, my physician advised me but yesterday to let go twenty ounces for my health. So you see, sir, there's nothing of that in the case. Don Lor. Then let me hear no other objections; for till I see Leonora I must lie upon the rack. I cannot bear her resentment, and will pacify her this night, or not live to see to-morrow. Lop. Well, sir, since you are so determined, I shan't be impertinent with any farther advice ; but I think you have laid your design to \u2014 [Coughs] (I have got such a cold to-day !) to get in privately, have you not ? Don Lor. Yes ; and have taken care to be in troduced as far as her chamber-door with all secrecy. Enter Lopez. Lop. As soon as it is night, says my master to me, though it cost me my life, I'll enter Leonora's lodgings ; therefore make haste, Lopez, prepare everything necessary, three pair of pocket-pistols, two wide-mouthed blunderbusses, some six ells of sword-blade, and a couple of dark lanterns. When my master said this to me ; Sir, said I to my mas ter, (that is, I would have said it if I had not been iu such a fright I could say nothing, however I'll say it to him now, and shall probably have a quiet hearing,) look you, sir, by dint of reason I intend to confound you. You are resolved, you say, to get into Leonora's lodgings though the devil stand in the doorway ? \u2014 Yes, Lopez, that's my resolu tion. \u2014 Very well ; and what do you intend to do when you are there ? \u2014 Why, what an injured man should do ; make her sensible of \u2014 Make her sensible of a pudding ! don't you see she's a jade ? She'll raise the house about your ears, arm the whole family, set the great dog at you. \u2014 Were there legions of devils to repulse me, iu such a cause I could disperse them all. \u2014 Why then you have no occasion for help, sir, you may leave me at home to lay the cloth. \u2014 No ; thou art my ancient friend, my fellow traveller, and to reward thy faithful services this night thou shalt partake my danger and my glory. \u2014 Sir, I have got glory enough under you already, to content any reasonable servant for his life. \u2014 Thy modesty makes me will ing to double my bounty; this night may bring eternal honour to thee and thy family. \u2014 Eternal honour, sir, is too much in conscience for a serving man ; besides, ambition has been many a great soul's undoing. \u2014 I doubt thou art afraid, my Lopez; thou shalt be armed with back, with breast, and head-piece. \u2014 They will encumber me in my re treat. \u2014 Retreat, my hero ! thou never shalt retreat. \u2014 Then by my troth I'll never go, sir. \u2014 But here he comes. Lop. [Coughing.] This unlucky cough ! I had rather have had a fever at another time. Sir, I should be sorry to do you more harm than good upon this occasion : if this cough should come upon me in the midst of the action [coughs] and give the alarm to the family, I should not forgive myself as long as I lived.

I am informed from unquestionable hands that Don Carlos is enraged against you to a dangerous degree ; and that old Alvarez has given positive directions to break the legs and arms of your servant Lopez. Lop. Look you there now, I thought what 'twould come to ! What do they meddle with me for ? what have I to do in my master's amours ? The old Don's got out of his senses, I think; have I married his daughter ? Don Lor. Fear nothing, we'll take care o' thee. \u2014 Sir, I thank you for the favour of your intelligence, 'tis nothing however but what I expected, and am provided for. Enter Don Lorenzo. Don Lor.

Were your wants yet still greater than they are, I bring a plentiful supply. Cam. O Heavens ! is't possible ! Isab. New mysteries are out, and if you can find charms to wean Lorenzo from your sister, no other obstacle is in your way to all you wish. Cam. Kind messenger from Heaven, speak on. Isab.

Take 'em by all means, sir, you were never offered a better pennyworth in your life. Tol. Ah, sir ! \u2014 little Diego \u2014 you have heard of him ; he'd have been worth a legion upon this occasion.

Don Lor. Such a man is indeed much to be re gretted : as for the rest of your escort, captain, I thank you for 'em, but shall not use 'em. Tol. I'm sorry for't, sir, because I think you go in very great danger ; I'm much afraid your rival won't give you fair play. Lop. If he does I'll be hanged ! he's a damned passionate fellow, and cares not what mischief he does. Cam. How ! daughter to Alvarez ! Isab. You are : the truth this moment's come to light ; and till this moment he, although your father, was a stranger to it ; nay, did not even know you were a woman. In short, the great estate, which has occasioned these uncommon accidents, was left but on condition of a son ; great hopes of one there was, when you destroyed 'em, and to your parents came a most unwelcome guest. To repair the disappointment, you were exchanged for that young Camillo, who few months after died. Your father then was absent, but your mother quick in contrivance, bold in execution, during that infant's sickness, had resolved his death should not deprive her family of those advantages his life had given it ; so ordered things with such dexterity, that once again there passed a change between you. Of this (for reasons yet unknown to me) she made a secret to her husband, and took such wise pre cautions, that till this hour 'twas so to all the world, except the person from whom I now have heard it. Don Lor. I shall give him a very good oppor tunity ; for I'll have no other guards about me but you, sir. So come along. Lop. Why, sir, this is the sin of presumption ; setting heaven at defiance, making jack-pudding of a blunderbuss. Cam. This news indeed affords a view of no unhappy termination ; yet there are difficulties still may be of fatal hindrance. Isab. None, except that one I just now named to you ; for to remove the rest, know I have already unfolded all both to Alvarez and Don Felix. Don Lor. No more, but follow. \u2014 Hold ! turn this way ; I see Camillo there. I would avoid him, till I see what part he takes in this odd affair of his sister's. For I would not have the quarrel fixed with him, if it be possible to avoid it. [Exit. Lop. Sir ! \u2014 Captain Toledo ! one word if you please, sir. I'm mighty sorry to see my master won't accept of your friendly offer. Look ye, I'm not very rich ; but as far as the expense of a dollar went, if you'd be so kind to take a little care of me, it should be at your service. Tol. Let me see ; \u2014 a dollar you say ? but sup pose I'm wounded ? Lop. Why you shall be put to no extraordinary charge upon that : I have been prentice to a barber, and will be your surgeon myself. Tol. 'Tis too cheap in conscience ; but my land estate is so ill paid this war time \u2014 Lop. That a little industry may be commend able ; so say no more, that matter's fixed. [Exeunt. Cam. And how have they received it ? Isab. To your wishes both. As for Lorenzo, he is yet a stranger to all has passed, and the two old fathers desire he may some moments longer con tinue so. They have agreed to be a little merry with the heats he is in, and engage you in a family quarrel with him. Cam. I doubt, Isabella, I shall act that part but faintly. Isab. No matter, you'll make amends for it in the scene of reconciliation. Cam. Pray Heaven it be my lot to act it with him. Isab. Here comes Don Felix to wish you joy. Enter Don Felix. Enter Camillo. Don Fel. Come near, my daughter, and with extended arms of great affection let me receive thee.

Cam. I'm so encouraged by your forgiveness, sir, methinks I have some flattering hopes of his. Cam. How miserable a perplexity have I brought myself into !

Well, Don Felix, have you prepared your son ? for mine, he's ready to engage. Don Lor. And so is his. My wrongs prepare me for a thousand combats. My hand has hitherto been held by the regard I've had to everything of kin to Leonora ; but since the monstrous part she acts has driven her from my heart, I call for repa ration from her family. Don Alv. You'll have it, sir ; Camillo will attend you instantly. Lop. O lack ! O lack ! will nobody do a little something to prevent bloodshed ? \u2014 [ To Leonora.] Why, madam, have you no pity, no bowels ? Stand and see one of your husbands stotered before your face ?

Don Fel. My care shall be to make him do as a man of honour ought to do. Lop. What, will you let him fight then ? let your own flesh and blood fight ? Don Fel. In a good cause, as this is. Lop. O monslrum horrendum ! Now I have that humanity about me, that if a man but talks to me of fighting, I shiver at the name on't. Don Lor. What you do on this occasion, sir, is worthy of you : and had I been wanting to you, in my due regards before, this noble action would have stamped that impression, which a grateful son ought to have for so generous a father.

'Tis true, in justice it was yours before ; But 'tis the god of love has done you right.

He's welcome : though I had rather have drawn my sword against another. \u2014 I'm sorry, Camillo, we should meet on such bad terms as these ; yet more sorry your sister should be the wicked cause on't : but since nothing will serve her but the blood either of a husband or brother, she shall be glutted with't.

I imprecate the utmost powers of Heaven To shower upon my head the deadliest of its wrath ; I ask that all hell's torments may unite To round my soul with one eternal anguish, If wicked Leonora ben't my wife.

The proof she gives me of her love deserves a large acknowledgment indeed. Forgive me, therefore, Leonora, if what I owe this goodness and these charms, I with my utmost care, my life, my soul, endeavour to repay. Cam. Is it then possible you can forgive me ? Don Lor. Indeed I can ; few crimes have such a claim To mercy. But join with me then, dear Camillo, (For still I know you by no other name,) Join with me to obtain your father's pardon. Yours, Leonora, loo, I must implore ; And yours, my friend, for now we may be such. [To Carlos.

Why, if you'll contrive that my master may run away with your mistress, I don't much care, faith, if I run away with you. Lis. Don't you so, rogue's face ! But I hope to be better provided for.

Country -House. Enter Erastus and his Servant, Lisetta following. Lis. Once more I tell ye, sir, if you have any consideration in the world for her, you must begone this minute. Erast. My dear Lisetta, let me but speak to her, let me but see her only. Lis. You may do what you will ; but not here, whilst you are in our house. I do believe she's as impatient to see you as you can be to see her ; but \u2014 Erast. But why won't you give us that satisfac tion then ? Lis. Because I know the consequence ; for when you once get together, the devil himself is not able to part ye ; you will stay so long till you are sur prised, and what will become of us then ? Serv. Why, then we shall be thrown out at the window, I suppose. Lis. No, but I shall be turned out of doors. Erast. How unfortunate am I ! these doors are open to all the world, and only shut to me. Lis. Because you come for a wife, and at our house we do not care for people that come for wives. Erast. Then I find you pass your time comfort ably in this family. Lis. Not so bad as you imagine neither, perhaps ; for, thank Heaven, we have a mistress that's as bountiful as he is stingy, one that will let him say what he will, and yet does what she will. But hark, here's somebody coming ; it is certainly he. Erast. Can't you hide us somewhere ? Lis. Here, here, get you in here as fast as you can. Serv. What would you have us come for, child ? Lis. Anything but wives ; because they cannot be put off without portions. Serv. Portions ! No, no, never talk of portions ; my master nor I neither don't want portions ; and Serv. Thrust me in too.

So, Lisetta, where have you been ? I've been looking for ye all over the house. Who are those people in the garden with my mother-in-law ? I believe my father won't be very well pleased to see 'em there. Lis. And here's somebody else not far off, that I believe your father won't be very well pleased with neither. \u2014 Come, sir, sir! [Calls. Mon. Barn. But, sirrah, you must obey my or ders, not hers. Col. Why, the gentlefolks asked for her, they did not ask for you \u2014 what do you make such a noise about ? Mon. Barn. For that reason, sirrah, you should not have let 'em in. Col. Hold, sir, I'd rather see you angry than her, that's true ; for when you're angry you have only the devil in ye, but when madam's in a passion she has the devil and his dam both in her belly. Mon. Barn. You must mind what I say to you, sirrah, and obey my orders. Col. Ay, ay, measter\u2014 but let's not quarrel with one another \u2014 you're always in such a plaguy humour. Re-enter Erastus and Servant. Mar. O heavens ! Lis. Come, lovers, I can allow you but a short bout on't this time ; you must do your work with a jirk\u2014 one whisper, two sighs, and a kiss ; make haste, I say, and I'll stand sentry for ye in the meantime. [Exit. Mar. Do you know what you expose me to, Erastus ? What do you mean ? Erast. To die, madam, since you receive me with so little pleasure. Mon Barn. What are these people that are just come ? Col. Nay, that know not I \u2014 but as fine volk they are as ever eye beheld, Heaven bless 'em ! Mon. Barn. Did you hear their names ? Col. Noa, noa, but in a coach they keam all besmeared with gould, with six breave horses, the like on 'em ne'er did I set eyes on. \u2014 'Twould do a man's heart good to look on sike fine beast, measter. Mon. Barn. How many persons are there ? Col. Vour \u2014 two as fine men as ever woman bore, and two as dainty deames as a man would desire to lay his lips to. Mon. Barn. And all this crew sets up at my house. Mar. Consider what would become of me, if my father should see you here. Erast. What would you have me do ? Mar. Expect with patience some happy turn of affairs. My mother-in-law is kind and indulgent to a miracle ; and her favour, if well managed, may turn to our advantage ; and could I prevail upon myself to declare my passion to her, I don't doubt but she'd join in our interest. Erast. Well, since we've nothing to fear from her, and your brother, you know, is my intimate friend, you may therefore conceal me somewhere about the house for a few days. I'll creep into any hole. Col. Noa, noa, measter, the coachman is gone into the village to set up .his coach at some inn, for I told him our coach-house was vull of vaggots, but he'll bring back the six horses, for I told him we had a rare good steable. Mon. Barn. Did you so, rascal ? did you so ? [Beats him. Col. Doant, doant, sir, it would do you good to see sike cattle, i'faith they look as if they had ne'er kept Lent. Mon. Barn.

Since I have bought this damned country-house, I spend more in a summer than would maintain me seven year. Serv. Ay, but who must have the care of bring ing us victuals ? [Aside. Erast. Thrust us into the cellar, or up into the garret : I don't care where it is, so that it be but under the same roof with you. Serv. But I don't say so, for that jade Lisetta will have the feeding of us, and I know what kind of diet she keeps. \u2014 I believe we shan't be like the fox in the fable, our bellies won't be so full but we shall be able to creep out at the same hole we got in at. [Aside. Erast. Must I then begone ? must I return to Paris ? Re-enter Lisetta. Col, WTiy, if you do spend money, han't you good things for it ? Come they not to see you the whole country raund ? Mind how you're beloved, measter. Lis. Yes, that you must, and immediately too, for here's my master coming in upon ye. Erast. What shall I do ? Lis. Begone this minute. Mar. Stay in the village till you hear from me, none of our family know that you are in it. Erast. Shall I see you sometimes ? Mar. I han't time to answer you now. Lis. Make haste, I say ; are you bewitched ? Erast. Will you write to me ? Mar. I will if I can. Mon. Barn. Pox take such love! \u2014 Re-enter Lisetta. How now, what do you want? Lis. Sir, there's some company in the garden with my mistress, who desire to see you. Mon. Barn. The devil take 'em, what business have they here ? But who are they ? Lis. Begone, I say ; is the devil in you ? \u2014 [ Thrusts Erastus and Servant out.] Come this way, your father's just stepping in upon us. [Exeunt. Lis. Why, sir, there's the fat abbot that always sits so long at dinner, and drinks his two bottles by way of whet. Mon. Barn. I wish his church was in his belly, that his guts might be half full before he came. \u2014 And who else ? Enter Monsieur Barnaru beating Colin. Mon. Barn. Rogue ! rascal ! did not I com mand you? Did not I give you my orders, sirrah? Col. Why, you gave me orders to let nobody in ; and madam, her gives me orders to let everybody Lis.

W7hich I paid above fifty pounds for in earnest. \u2014 Very well, and pray how did madam receive all this fine company ? \u2014 With a hearty welcome, and a curtsy with her bum down to the ground, ha? Lis. No indeed, sir, she was very angry with 'em. Mon. Barn. How, angry with 'em, say you ? Lis. Yes indeed, sir, for she expected they would have staid here a fortnight, but it seems things happen so unluckily that they can't stay here above ten days. [Exit. Mon. Barn. Ten days ! how ! what ! four persons with a coach and six, and a kennel of hungry hounds in liveries, to live upon me ten days ! Mon. Bam. No, no, I don't hear them : who are they ? Mon. Griff. Three or four rake-helly officers, with your nephew at the head of 'em. Mon. Barn. O the rogue ! he might well send me fowls. \u2014 But is it not a vexatious thing, that I must stand still and see myself plundered at this rate, and have a carrion of a wife who thinks I ought to thank all these rogues that come to de vour me ! But can't you advise me what's to be done in this case ? Mon. Griff. I wish I could, for it goes to my heart to see you thus treated by a crew of vermin, who think they do you a great deal of honour in ruining of you. Mon. Barn. Can there be no way found to re dress this ? Mon. Griff. If I were you, I'd leave this house quite, and go to town. Mon. Barn. What, and leave my wife behind me ? ay that would be mending the matter indeed ! Enter Soldier. So, what do you want ? Sol. Sir, I come from your nephew, captain Mon. Griff. Why don't you sell it then ? Mon. Barn. Because nobody will buy it ; it has got as bad a name as if the plague were in't ; it has been sold over and over, and every family that has lived in it has been ruined. Hungry. Mon. Barn. Well, what does he want ? Sol. He gives his service to you, sir, and sends you word that he'll come and dine with you to morrow. Mon. Griff. Then send away all your beds and furniture, except what is absolutely necessary for your own family : you'll save something by that, for then your guests can't stay with you all night, however. Mon. Barn. Dine with me ! no, no, friend, tell him I don't dine at all to-morrow, it is my fast day, my wife died on't. Sol. And he has sent you here a pheasant and a couple of partridges. Mon. Barn. How's that, a pheasant and part ridges, say you ! \u2014 Let's see \u2014 very fine birds, truly. \u2014 Let me cousider \u2014 to-morrow is not my fast-day, I mistook ; tell my nephew he shall be welcome. \u2014 [To Colin.] And d'ye hear? do you take these fowl and hang them up in a cool place \u2014 and take this soldier in, and make him drink \u2014 make him drink, d'ye see \u2014 a cup, \u2014 ay, a cup of small beer \u2014 d'ye hear ? Col. Yes, sir. \u2014 Come along ; our small beer is reare good. [Exit. Sol. But, sir, he bade me tell you that he'll bring two or three of his brother officers along with him. Mon. Barn. I've tried that already, and it sig nified nothing : \u2014 for they all got drunk and lay iu the barn, and nextmorning laughed it off for afrolic. Mon. Griff. Then there is but one remedy lest that I can think off. Mon. Barn. What's that ? Mon. Griff. You must e'en do what's done when a town's on fire, blow up your house that the mischief may run no further. \u2014 But who is this gentleman ? Mon. Barn. I never saw him in my life before, but for all that, I'll hold fifty pound he comes to dine with me. Enter the Marquis. Alon. Barn.

Heaven be now my comfort, for my house is hell : \u2014 [Starts.] Who's there, what do you want? who are you? Jan. Cousin, we shan't give you much trouble, one bed will serve us ; for sister Mawkin and 1 always lie together. Alawk. But, cousin ; mother prays you that you'd order a little cock-broth for brother Janno and I, to be got ready as soon as may be. Jan. Ay, a propos, cousin Barnard, that's true ; my mother desires that we may have some cock broth to drink two or three times a-day between meals, for my sister and I are sick folks. Mawk. And some young chickens too, the doctor said, would bring us to our stomachs very soon. Enter Servant with a portmanteau. Serv. Sir, here's your cousin Janno and cou sin Mawkin come from Paris. Alon. Bam. What a plague do they want ? Enter Janno, leading in Mawkin. Jan. Come, sister, come along. \u2014 Oh, here's cou sin Barnard. \u2014 Cousin Barnard, your servant.\u2014 Here's my sister Mawkin and 1 are come to see you. Jan. You fib now, sister, it waunt young chick ens, so it waunt, it was plump partridges sure, the doctor said so. Mawk. Ay, cousin, here's brother Janno and I are come from Paris to see you. Pray how does cousin Mariamne do ? Alawk. Ay, so it was, brother Come, let's go in, and see our cousins. Jan. Ay, come along, sister. \u2014 Cousin Barnard, don't forget the cock-broth. [Exeunt Janno and Mawkin, Servant following. Alon. Barn. What the devil does all this mean ! Mother, and sister Flip, and little brother Hum phrey, and chickens, and partridges, and cock broth, and fire from hell to dress 'em all. Jan. My sister and I waunt well at Paris ; so my father sent us here for two or three weeks to take a little country air. Alon. Barn. You could not come to a worse place ; for this is the worst air in the whole country. Alawk. Nay, I'm sure, my father says it is the best. Alon. Barn. Your father's a fool ; I tell ye, 'tis the worst. Enter Colin. Col. O measter ! O measter ! \u2014 you'll not chide to-day, as you are usen to do ; no, marry will you not ; see now what it is to be wiser than one's measter ! Jan. Nay, cousin, I fancy you're mistaken now ; for I begin to find my stomach come to me already ; in a fortnight's time you shall see how I'll lay about me. Mon. Barn. I don't at all doubt it. Mawk. Father would have sent sister Flip and little brother Humphrey, but the calash would not holds us all, and so they don't come till to-morrow with mother. Jan. Come, sister, let's put up our things in our chamber ; and after you have washed my face, Alon. Barn. What would this fool have ? Col. Why, thanks, and money to-boot, an folk were grateful. Alon. Barn. What's the matter ? Col. Why, the matter is, if you have good store of company in your house, you have good store of meat to put in their bellies."], [558, "464 THE COUNTRY HOUSE. ACT lli Alon, Barn. How so ? how so ? hunting all this morning, they're now gone up to your wife's chamber. Alon. Bam. The devil go with 'em ! Alon. Griff. There's but one way to get rid of this plague, and that is, as I told you before, to set your house on fire. Mon. Bam. That's doing myself an injury, not them. Col. Why, a large and steately stag, with a pair of horns on his head, Heaven bless you, your wor ship might be seen to wear 'em, comes towards our geat a puffing and blawing like a cow in hard labour. \u2014 Now, says I to myself, says I, if my measter refuse to let this fine youth come in, why, then, he's a fool d'ye see.\u2014 So I opens him the geat, pulls off my hat with both my honds, and said, You're welcome, kind sir, to our house. Mon. Griff. There's dogs, horses, masters, and servants, all intend to stay here till to-morrow morning, that they may be near the woods to hunt the earlier : \u2014 besides (I overheard them) they're iu a kind of plot against you. Alon. Barn. What did they say ? Mon. Griff. You'll be angry if I should tell ye. Alon. Barn. Can I be more angry than I am ? Mon. Griff. They said, then, that it was the greatest pleasure in the world to ruin an old lawyer in the country, who had got an estate by ruining honest people in town. Mon. Barn. There's rogues for ye ! Alon. Griff. I'm mistaken if they don't play you some trick or other. Mon. Barn. Hold, let me consider. Alon. Barn. Well, well ! Col. Well, well, ay, and so it is well, as you shall straightway find. \u2014 So in he trots, and makes directly towards our barn, and goes bounce, bounce, against the door, as boldly as if he had been meas ter on't : \u2014 he turns'en about and thawcks'n down in the stra, as who would say. Here will I lay me till to-morrow morning. \u2014 But he had no fool to deal with : for to the kitchen goes I, and takes me down a musket, and, with a breace of balls, I hits'n such a slap in the feace, that he ne'er spoke a word more to me. \u2014 Have I done well or no, measter ? Alon. Barn. Yes, you have done very well for once. Col. But this was not all, for a parcel of dogs came yelping after their companion, as I suppose ; so I goes to the back-yard door, and, as many as came by, shul says I, and drove 'em into the gearden ; so there they are as safe as in a pawnd \u2014 ha ! ha ! \u2014 But I can't but think what a power of pasties we shall have at our house, ha ! ha !

I'm conceiving, I shall bring forth presently. \u2014 Oh, I have it! it comes from hence, wit was its father, and invention its mother ; if I had thought on't sooner, I should have been happy. At on. Griff. What is it ? Mon. Barn. Come, come along, I say ; you must help me to put it in execution. Alon. Barn. I see Providence takes some care of me : this could never have happened in a better time. Enter Lisetta. Lis. Sir, my mistress desires you to walk up ; she is not able, by herself, to pay the civilities due to so much good company. Aton. Bam. O the carrion ! What, does she play her jests upon me too? \u2014 but, mum, he laughs best that laughs last. Lis. What shall I tell her, sir, will you come? Mon. Barn. Yes, yes, tell her I'll come, with a pox to her ! [Exit with Monsieur Grifeard. Lis. Nay, I don't wonder he should be angry : \u2014 they do try his patience, that's the truth on't. Enter Cook. Cook. Sir, sir, in the name of wonder, what do you mean ? is it by your orders that all those dogs were let into the garden ? Alon. Barn. How ! Cook. I believe there's forty or fifty dogs tearing up the lettuce and cabbage by the root ; I believe before they have done, they'll rout up the whole garden. Alon. Bam. This is that rogue's doings. Cook. This was not all, sir, for three or four of 'em came into the kitchen, and tore half the meat off the spit that was for your worship's supper. Alon. Bam. The very dogs plague me ! Cook. And then there's a crew of hungry foot men who devoured what the dogs left, so that there's not a bit left for your worship's supper ; not a scrap, not one morse], sir. [Exit. Mon. Barn. Sure I shall hit on some way to get rid of this crew. Enter Mariamne. What, madam, have you left your mother and the company ? Mar. So much tittle tattle makes my head ache ; I don't wonder my father should not love the country, for besides the expense he's at, he never enjoys a minute's quiet. Lis. But let's talk of your own affairs : \u2014have you writ to your lover ? Mar. No, for I have not had time since I saw him. Re-enter Colin. Col.

Mar. What does the youDg rogue mean ? I swear I'll have you whipped. [Exeunt Charly and Mariamne. Char. Who do you think I met as I was coming here, but that handsome gentleman I've seen at church ogle you like any devil ? Mar. Hush, softly, cousin, Lis. Not a word of that for your life. Char. Oh, I know, I should not speak on't before folks ; you know I made signs to you above, that I wanted to speak to you in private, didn't I, cousin ? Mar. Yes, yes, I saw you. Char. You see I can keep a secret. \u2014 I am no girl, mun. \u2014 I believe I could tell ye fifty, and fifty to that, of my sister Cicely. \u2014 Oh, she's the devil of a girl! \u2014 but she gives me money and sugar plums \u2014 and those that are kind to me fare the better for it, you see, cousin. \u25a0 Mar. I always said my cousin Charly was a good-natured boy. Lis. Well, and did he know you ? Char.

Mar. Well, but what did he say to you ? Char. Why, he asked me where I was going ; I told him I was coming to see you ; You're a lying young rogue, says he, I'm sure you dare not go see your cousin : \u2014 for you must know my sister was with me, and it seems he took her for a crack, and I being a forward boy, he fancied I was going to make love to her under a hedge, ha ! ha !

So my sister's honour being concerned, and having a mind to win his louis-d'or, d'ye see \u25a0 \u2014 I bid him follow me, that he might see whether I came in or no. \u2014 But he said he'd wait for me at the little garden gate that opens into the fields, and if I would come through the house and meet him there, he should know by that whether I had been in or no.

Yes, sir. \u2014 Odsflesh ! we shall break all the inns in the country : \u2014 for we have a breave hand some landlady, and a curious young lass to her daughter. \u2014 Oh, here comes my young measter. \u2014 We'll make him chamberlain \u2014 ha ! ha !

Sir, there are some of 'em coming ; I only rid before to beg you to give 'em a favourable reception. Mon. Barn. Ay, why not ? It is both for your honour and mine ; you shall be master. Dor. Sir, we, have now an opportunity of making all the gentlemen in the country our friends. Mon. Barn. I'm glad on't with all my heart; pray how so ? Mar. Very well. . Char.

O, sir, a very ancient quarrel ; it happened between their great grandfathers about a duck. Mon. Barn. A quarrel of consequence truly ! Dor. And 'twill be a great honour to us if this should be accommodated at our house. Mar. Why, that was honestly done. Char. And then he talked to me of you, and said you had the charmingest bubbies, and every time he named 'em, Ha ! says he, as if he had been sipping hot tea. Mar. But was this all ? Char. No, for he had a mind, you must know, to win his louis-d'or back again ; so he laid me another that I dare not come back and tell you that he was there ; so, cousin, I hope you won't let me lose, for if you don't go to him and tell him that I've won, he won't pay me. Mar. What, would you have me go and speak to a man ? Char. Not for any harm, but to win your poor cousin a louis-d'or. I'm sure you will\u2014 for you're a modest young woman, and may go without danger. Mon. Barn. Without doubt. Dor. Dear sir, you astonish me with this good ness ; how shall I express this obligation ? I was afraid, sir, you would not like it. Mon. Barn. Why so ? m Dor.

But let me read this wiseacre's letter once over again. \u2014 [Reads.] Most honoured uncle, I do not doubt but you have much rejoiced at my success in my election.

She will visit all ladies that will let her into their houses, and she will run in debt to all the shop. keepers that will let her into their books.

And I you, dear Mr. James. Give me a kiss. \u2014 Why that's friendly. James. I wish they had been so, John, that you met with when you were here before. John. Ah \u2014 murrain upon all rogues and whores ! I say. But I am grown so cunning now, the deel himself can't handle me. I have made a notable bargain for these lodgings here, we are to pay but five pounds a-week, and have all the house to our selves. James. Then within the coach there was Sir Francis, my lady, the great fat lapdog. Squire Humphry, Miss Betty, my lady's maid, Mrs. Haody, and Doll Tripe the cook ; but she puked with sitting backward, so they mounted her into the coach-box. Unc. Rich. Very well. James. Then, sir, for fear of a famine before they should get to the baiting-place, there was such baskets of plum-cake, Dutch-gingerbread, Che shire-cheese, Naples biscuits, maccaroons, neats' tongues, and cold boiled beef; \u2014 and in case of sickness, such bottles of usquebaugh, black-cherry brandy, cinnamon-water, sack, tent, and strong beer, as made the old coach crack again. Unc. Rich. Well said ! James. And for defence of this good cheer and my lady's little pearl necklace, there was the family basket-hilt sword, the great Turkish cimiter, the old blunderbuss, a good bag of bullets, and a great horn of gunpowder. Unc. Rich. Admirable ! James. Then for bandboxes, they were so be piled up \u2014 to sir Francis's nose, that he could only peep out at a chance hole with one eye, as if James. Where are the people that belong to it to be then ? John. Oh ! there's only the gentlewoman, her two maids, and a cousin, a very pretty, civil young woman truly, and the maids are the merriest grigs\u2014 James. Have a care, John. John. Oh, fear nothing ; we did so play toge ther last night. James. Hush ! here comes my master. Enter Uncle Richard. Unc. Rich. What ! John has taken these lodg ings, has he ? James. Yes, sir, he has taken 'em. [Exit. Unc. Rich. O John ! how dost do, honest John I I am glad to see thee with all my heart."], [564, "470 A JOURNEY TO LONDON. ACT I. John. I humbly thank your worship.

My lady would gladly have been here last night, sir, though there were no lodgings got ; but her ladyship said, she did naw care for that, she'd lie in the inn where the horses stood, as long as it w.as in London. Unc. Rich. These ladies, these ladies, John ! \u2014 \u25a0 John. Ah, sir, I have seen a little of 'em, though not so much as my betters. Your worship is naw married yet ? Unc. Rich.

Lady Head. Miss Betty, don't you see your Uncle ? Unc. Rich. And for thee, my dear, mayst thou be, at least, as good a woman as thy mother. Miss Bet. I wish I may ever be so handsome, sir. Unc. Rich. Ha ! Miss Pert ! now that's a thought that seems to have been hatched in the girl on this side Highgate. [Aside. Sir Fran. Her tongue is a little nimble, sir. Lady Head. That's only from her country edu cation, sir Francis, she has been kept there too long ; I therefore brought her to London, sir, to learn more reserve and modesty. Unc. Rich. Oh, the best place in the world for it! Every woman she meets will teach her something of it.

Very kind and civil truly ; I believe we are got into a mighty good house here. Unc. Rich. [Aside.] For good business very probable. \u2014 [Aloud.] Well, niece, your servant for to-night ; you have a great deal of affairs upon your hands here, so I won't hinder you. Lady Head. I believe, sir, I shan't have much less every day, while I stay in this town, of one sort or other. John. Heavens bless you, and preserve you, sir. Unc. Rich. I think you have lost your good woman, John ? John. No, sir, that have I not ; Bridget sticks to me still, sir. She was for coining to London ton, but, no, says I, there may be mischief enough done without you. Unc. Rich. Why that was bravely spoken, John, and like a man. John.

Mrs. Hand. Almost, my lady ; there are only some of the bandboxes behind, and a few odd things. Lady Head. Pray, good sir Francis, he has been constantly eating in the coach, and out of the coach, above seven hours this day. I wish my poor girl could eat a quarter as much. Aliss Bet. Mama, 1 could eat a good deal more than 1 do, but then 1 should grow fat mayhap, like him, and spoil my shape. Lady Head. Mrs. Motherly, will you be so kind to tell them where they shall carry the things ? Mrs. Moth. Madam, I'll do the best I can : I doubt our closets will scarce hold 'em all, but we have garrets and cellars, which, with the help of hiring a store-room, I hope may do. \u2014 [To Tom.] Sir, will you be so good to help my maids a little in carrying away the things ?

Sir, here's Norfolk-nog to be had at next door. but heavy George and fat Tom are after 'em with a vengeance; they'll sauce their jackets for 'em, I'll warrant 'em. Enter George with a bloody face, and Tom. So, have you catched 'em ? Squire Hum. That's best of all, feather ; but make haste with it, John. [Exit John Moody. George. Catched em ! the gallows catch 'em for me ! I had naw run hafe the length of our beam, before somewhat fetched me such a wherry across the shins, that dawn came I flop o' my feace all along in the channel, and thought I should ne'er ha' gotten up again ; but Tom has skaward after them, and cried murder as he'd been stuck. Tom. Yes, and straight upo' that, swap comes 6omewhat across my forehead, with such a force, that dawn came I like an ox. Lady Head. Well, I wonder, Sir Francis, you will encourage that lad to swill his guts thus with such beastly, lubberly liquor : if it were bur gundy, or champagne, something might be said for't ; they'd perhaps give him some wit and spirit ; but such heavy, muddy stuff as this will make him quite stupid. Sir Fran. Why you know, my dear, I have drank good ale and strong beer these thirty years, andbyyour permission I don't know that I want wit. Miss Bet. But you might have had more, papa, if you had been governed by my mother. Squire Hum. So, the poor pye's quite gone then ! Tom. Gone, young measter ! yeaten I believe by this time. These I suppose are what they call sharpers in this country. Squire Hum. It was a rare good pye. Doll. As e'er these hands put pepper to. Lady Head.

Madam, they'll twitch a rump of beef out of a boiling copper ; and for a silver tan kard, they make no more conscience of that, than if it were a Tunbridge sugar-box. Sir Fran. I wish the coach and horses, George, were safe got to the inn. Do you and Roger take special care that nobody runs away with them, as you go thither. George. I believe, sir, our cattle woant yeasily be run away with to-night ; but weest take best care we con of them, poor sauls ! [Exit. Sir Fran. Do so, pray now. Squire Hum.

No, says he, you bump kin \u2014 Sir, he did the thing on very purpose, and so the folks said that stood by ; but they said your worship need na be concerned, for you might have a lawsuit with him when you pleased, that would not cost you above a hundred pounds, and mayhap you might get the better ot him.

Not if I were rich enough to live without one. Col. I'm sorry I am not rich enough to make thee so ; but we won't talk of melancholy things. Who are these folks your aunt has got in her house? Mar. One sir Francis Headpiece and his lady, with a son and daughter. Col. Headpiece ! cotso, I know 'em a little. I met with 'em at a race in the country two years since ; a sort of blockhead, is not he ? Mar. So they say. Col. His wife seemed a mettled gentlewoman, if she had had but a fair field to range in.

I found the street door as wide as it could gape. Deb. Sir, we are all in a bustle, we have lodgers come in to-night, the house full. Col. Where's your mistress ? Deb. Prodigious busy with her company ; but Til tell Mrs. Martilla you are here, I believe she'll come to you. Col. That will do as well.\u2014 [ Exit Deborah.] Poor Martilla ! she's a very good girl, and I have loved her a great while I think six months it is, since, like a merciless highwayman, I made her deliver all she had about her ; she begged hard, poor thing, I'd leave her one small bauble. Had I let her keep it, I believe she had still kept me. Could women but refuse their ravenous lovers that one dear destructive moment, how long might they reign over them ! \u2014 But for a bane to both their joys and ours, when they have indulged us with such favours as to make us adore them, they are not able to refuse us that one which puts an end to our devotion. Col. Why, then, she can blame neither you nor me. Airs. Aloth. You'll never be quiet till you get my windows broke ; but I must go and attend my lodgers, so good night. Col.

My lord, you grow scurrilous, and you'll make me hate you. 1'il have you to know I keep company with the politest people in the town, and the assemblies I frequent are full of such. Lord Love. So are the churches now and then. Lady Ara. My friends frequent them often, as well as the assemblies. Enter Lord Loverule and Lady Arabella. Lady Ara. Well, look you, my lord, I can bear it no longer ; nothing still but about my faults, my faults ! an agreeable subject truly ! Lord Love. But, madam, if you won't hear of vour faults, how is it likely you should ever mend *em? Lord Love. They would do it oftener,if a groom of the chamber there were allowed to furnish cards and dice to the company. Lady Ara. You'd make a woman mad ! Lord Love. You'd make a man a fool. Lady Ara. Why, I don't intend to mend 'em. I can't mend 'em, I have told you so a hundred times; you know I have tried to do it, over and over, and it hurts me so I can't bear it. Why, don't you know, my lord, that whenever (just to please you only) I have gone about to wean myself from a fault (one of my faults I mean that I love dearly), han't it put me so out of humour you could scarce endure the house with me ? Lady Ara. If Heaven has made you otherwise, that won't be in my power. Lord Love. I'll try if I can prevent your making me a beggar at least. Lady Ara. A beggar ! Cr\u0153sus ! I'm out of patience !- \u2014 I won't come home till four to-morrow morning. Lord Love. I'll order the doors to be locked at twelve. Lord Love. Look you, my dear, it is very true, that in weaning one's self from \u2014 Lady Ara. Weaning ! why, ay, don't you see, that even in weaning poor children from the nurse it's almost the death of 'em ? and don't you see your true religious people, when they go about to wean themselves, and have solemn days of fasting and praying, on purpose to help them, does it not so disorder them, there's no coming near 'em ; are they not as cross as the devil ? and then they don't do the business neither ; for next day their faults are just where they were the day before. Lord Love. But, madam, can you think it a rea sonable thing to be abroad till two o'clock in the morning, when you know I go to bed at eleven ? Lady Ara. And can you think it a wise thing (to talk your own way now) to go to bed at eleven, when you know I am likely to disturb you by coming there at three ? Lord Love. Well, the manner of women's living of late is insupportable, and some way or other \u2014 Lady Ara. It's to be mended, I suppose.' \u2014 Pray, my lord, one word of fair argument. You com plain of my late hours ; I of your early ones ; so far we are even, you'll allow. But which gives us the best figure in the eye of the polite world ? My two o'clock speaks life, activity, spirit, and vigour ; your eleven has a dull, drowsy, stupid, good-for nothing sound with it. It savours much of a me chanic, who must get to bed betimes that he may rise early to open his shop, faugh ! Lord Love. I thought to go to bed early and rise so, was ever esteemed a right practice for all people. Lady Ara. Beasts do it. Lord Love. Fy, fy, madam, fy! But 'tis not your ill hours alone disturb me ; but the ill com pany who occasion those ill hours. Lady Ara. Then I won't come home till to morrow night. iLiuiiuw ji.jh. Lord Love. Then you shall never come home again, madam. [Exit. Lady Ara. There he has knocked me down. My father upon our marriage said, wives were come to that pass, he did not think it fit they should be trusted with pin-money, and so would not let this man settle one penny upon his poor wife, to serve her at a dead lift for separate main tenance. Enter Clarinda. Clar. Good-morrow, madam; how do you do to-day ? you seem to be in a little fluster. Lady Ara. My lord has been in one, and as I am the most complaisant poor creature in the world, I put myself into one too, purely to be suitable company to him. Clar. You are prodigious good ; but surely it must be mighty agreeable when a man and his wife can give themselves the same turn of conversation. Lady Ara. Oh, the prettiest thing in the world ! Clar. But yet, though I believe there's no life so happy as a married one, in the main ; yet I fancy, where two people are so very much together, they must often be in want of something to talk upon. Lady Ara. Clarinda, you are the most mistaken in the world ; married people have things to talk of, child, that never enter into the imagination of others. Why now, here's my lord and I, we han't been married above two short years, you know, and we have already eight or ten things constantly in bank, that whenever we want company, we can talk of any one of them for two hours together, and the subject never the flatter. It will be as fresh next day, if we have occasion for it, as it was the first day it entertained us. Clar. Why that must be wonderful pretty. Lady Ara. Oh, there's no life like it ! This very day now, for example, my lord and I, after a pretty cheerful ttte-a-ttte dinner, sat down by the fireside, in an idle, indolent, picktoolh way for a while, as if we had not thought of one another's Lady Ara. And pray what ill company may those be ? Lord Love. Why, women that lose their money, and men that win it: especially when 'tis to be paid out of their husband's estate ; or if that fail, and the creditor be a little pressing, the lady will perhaps be obliged to try if the gentleman, instead of gold, will accept of a trinket."], [568, "A JOURNEY TO LONDON. 474 ACT II. being in the room. At last (stretching himself, and yawning twice), my dear, says he, you came home very late last night. 'Twas but two in the morning, says I. I was in bed (yawning) by eleven, says he. So you are every night, says I. Well, says he, I am amazed how you can sit up so late. How can you be amazed, says I, at a thing that happens so often ? Upon which we entered into conversation. And though this is a point has entertained us above fifty times already, we always find so many pretty new things to say upon't, that I believe in my soul it will last as long as we live. Lady Ara. And you'll live in town ? Clar. Half the year I should like it very well. Lady Ara. And you would live in London half a year, to be sober in it ? Clar. Yes. Lady Ara. Why can't you as well go and be sober in the country ? Clar. So I would the t'other half year. Lady Ara. And pray what pretty scheme of life would you form now, for your summer and winter sober entertainments ? Clar. A scheme that, I think, might very well content us. Clar. But in such sort of family dialogues (though extremely well for passing of time) don't there now and then enter some little witty sort of bitterness ? Lady Ara. Let's hear it. Clar. I could in summer pass my time very agreeably, in riding soberly, in walking soberly, in sitting under a tree soberly, in gardening soberly, in reading soberly, in hearing a little music soberly, in conversing with some agreeable friends soberly, in working soberly, in managing my family and children (if I had any) soberly, and possibly by these means I might induce my husband to be as sober as myself. Lady Ara. Well, Clarinda, thou art a most contemptible creature. But let's have the sober town scheme too, for I'm charmed with the coun try one. Lady Ara. O yes ; which don't do amiss at all, a little something that's sharp, moderates the extreme sweetness of matrimonial society, which would else perhaps be cloying. Though to tell you the truth, Clarinda, I think we squeezed a little too much lemon into it this bout ; for it grew so sour at last, that I think I almost told him he was a fool ; and he talked something oddly of turning me out of doors. Clar. Oh, but have a care of that ! Lady Ara. Why, to be serious, Clarinda, what would you have a woman do in my case ? There is no one thing he can do in this world to please me \u2014 except giving me money ; and that he is growing weary of; and I at the same time (partly by nature, and partly perhaps by keeping the best company) do with my soul love almost everything that he hates. I dote upon assemblies, adore masquerades, my heart bounds at a ball ; I love play to distraction, cards enchant me, and dice \u2014 put me out of my little wits. \u2014 Dear, dear hazard, what music there is in the rattle of the dice, com pared to a sleepy opera ! Do you ever play at hazard, Clarinda ? Clar. You shall, and I'll try to stick to my sobriety there too. Lady Ara. If you do, you'll make me sick of you. But let's hear it however. Clar. I would entertain myself in observing the new fashions soberly, I would please myself in new clothes soberly, I would divert myself with agree able friends at home and abroad soberly, I would play at quadrille soberly, I would go to court soberly, I would go to some plays soberly, I would go to operas soberly, and I think I could go once, or, if I liked my company, twice to a masquerade soberly. Lady Ara. If it had not been for that last piece of sobriety, I was going to call for some surfeit water. Clar. Never; I don't think it sits well upon women ; it's very masculine, and has too much of a rake ; you see how it makes the men swear and curse. Sure it must incline the women to do the same too, if they durst give way to it. Clar. Why don't you think, that with the fur ther aid of breakfasting, dining, supping, and sleeping (not to say a word of devotion), the four and-twenty hours might roll over in a tolerable manner ?

That's enough to hurst you ; but in time perhaps you'll let 'em fly as they do. Lady Ara. Why 'tis probable we may, for the pleasure of all polite women's lives now, you know, is founded upon entire liberty to do what they will. But shall I tell you what happened t'other night ? Having lost all my money but ten melancholy guineas, and throwing out for them, what do you think slipped from me? Clar. An oath ? Lady Ara. How I detest that word, tolerable ! And so will a country relation of ours, that's newly come to town, or I'm mistaken. Clar. Who is that ? Lady Ara. Even my dear lady Headpiece. Clar. Is she come ? Lady Ara. Yes, her sort of a tolerable husband has gotten to be chosen parliament-man at some simple town or other, upon which she has persuaded him to bring her and her folks up to London. Clar. That's good ; I think she was never here before. Lady Ara. Gud soons ! Clar. O Lord ! O Lord ! did not it frighten you out of your wits ? Lady Ara. Clarinda, I thought a gun had gone oft'. \u2014 But I forget, you are a prude, and design to live soberly. Clar. Why 'tis true ; both my nature and education do in a good degree incline me that way. Lady Ara. Well, surely to be sober is to be terribly dull. You will marry, won't you ? Clar. I can't tell but I may. Lady Ara. Not since she was nine years old ; but she has had an outrageous mind to it ever since she was married Clar. Then she'll make the most of it, I suppose, now she is come, Lady Ara. Depend upon that. Clar. We must go and visit her. Lady Ara. By all means ; and may he you'll have a mind to offer her your tolerable scheme for her London diversion this winter ; if you do,"], [569, "SCENE 1.

But however you two may stand in one another's, you must take another time if you desire to talk farther about it, or we shan't have enough to make our visits in ; and so your servant, sir. \u2014 Come, Clarinda. Sir Char. I'll stay and make my lord a visit, if you will give me leave. Lady Ara. You have my leave, sir, though you were a lady. [Exit with Clarinda. Enter Sir Charles. Re-enter Lord Loverlle. Sir Char. Madam, your servant; they told me lady Arabella was here. Clar. She's only stepped up to write a letter ; she'll come down presently. Sir Char. Why, does she write letters ? I thought she had never time for't : pray how may she have disposed of the rest of the day ? Clar. A good deal as usual ; she has visits to make till six ; she's then engaged to the play ; from that till court-time she's to be at cards at Mrs. Idle's ; after the drawing-room she takes a short supper with lady Hazard, and from thence they go together to the assembly. Sir Char. And are you to do all this with her ? Clar. The visits and the play, no more. Sir Char. And how can you forbear all the rest ? Clar. 'Tis easy to forbear what we are not very fond of. Lord Love. Sir Charles, your servant ; \u2014 what, have the ladies left you ? Sir Char. Yes ; and the ladies in general I hope will leave me too. Lord Love. Why so ? Sir Char. That I mayn't be put to the ill-man ners of leaving them first. Lord Love. Do you tbpn already find your gal lantry inclining to an ebb ? Sir Char. 'Tis not that I am yet old enough to justify myself in an idle retreat, but I have got, I think, a sort of surfeit on me that lessens much the force of female charms. Lord Love. Have you then been so glutted with their favours ? Sir Char. Not with their favours, but with their service ; it is unmerciful. I once thought mys_lf a tolerable time-killer; I drank, 1 played, 1 in trigued, and yet I had hours enow for reasonable uses ; but he that will list himself a lady's man of metal now, she'll work him so at cards and dice, she won't afford him time enough to play with her at anything else, though she herself should have a tolerable good mind to it. Lord Love. And so the disorderly lives they lead make you incline to a reform of your own. Sir Char. 'Tis true ; for bad examples (if they are but bad enough) give us as useful reflections as good ones do. Lord Love. 'Tis pity anything that's bad should come from women. Sir Char. I han't found it so. I have passed much of my life in this hurry of the ladies, yet was never so pleased as when I was at quiet without 'em. Clar. What then induced you to be with 'em ? Sir Char. Idleness and the fashion. Clar. No mistresses in the case ? Sir Char. To speak honestly, yes. When one is in a toyshop, there was no forbearing the bau bles; so I was perpetually engaging with some coquette or other, whom I could love perhaps just enough to put it into her power to plague me. Clar. Which power I suppose she sometimes made use of. Sir Char. 'Tis so indeed ; and there was a happy time when both you and I thought there never could. Sir Char. The amours of a coquette, madam, generally mean nothing farther ; I took upon them and prudes to be nuisances much alike, though they seem very different : the first are always disturbing the men, and the latter always abusing the women. Clar. And all I think is to establish the cha racter of being virtuous. Lord Love- Our early first conceptions of them, I well remember, were, that they never could be vicious, nor never could be old. Sir Char. We thought so then ; the beauteous form we saw them cast in, seemed designed a habitation for no vice, nor no decay ; all I had conceived of angels I conceived of them ; true, tender, gentle, modest, generous, constant, I thought was writ in every feature ; and in my devotions, Heaven, how did I adore thee, that blessings like them should be the portion of such poor inferior creatures as I took myself and all men else (com pared with them) to be !\u2014 But where's that adora tion now ? Sir Char. That is, being chaste they mean, for they know no other virtue ; therefore indulge them selves in everything else that's vicious ; they (against nature) keep their chastity only because they find more pleasure in doing mischief with it than they should have in parting with it. But, madam, if both these characters are so odious, how highly to be valued is that woman who can attain all they aim at without the aid of the folly or vice of either ! Lord Love. 'Tis with such fond young fools as you and I were then. Sir Char. And with such it ever will be. Re-enter Lady Arabella. Lady Ara Your servant, sir. I won't ask your pardon for leaving you alone a little with a lady that I know shares so much of your good opinion. Sir Char. I wish, madam, she could think my good opinion of value enough to afford me a small part in hers. Lady Ara. I believe, sir, every woman, who Lord Love. Ever. The pleasure is so great in believing women to be what we wish them, that nothing but a long and sharp experience can ever make us think them otherwise. That experience, friend, both you and I have had ; but yours has been at other men's expense ; mine \u2014 at my own."], [570, "A JOURNEY TO LONDON. 476 ACT Hr. Sir Char. Perhaps you'd wonder should you find me disposed to run the risk of that experience too. berty for gold, and I am foully paid in brass, shall I be held to keep the bargain ? Sir Char. What are you thinking of? Lord Love. Of what you have said. Sir Char. And was it well said ? Cord Love. I should indeed. Xir Char. And yet 'tis possible I may ; know, at least, I still have so much of my early folly left, to think there's yet one woman fit to make a wife of. How far such a one can answer the charms of a mistress, married men are silent in, so pass \u2014 for that, I'd take my chance; but could she make a home easy to her partner, by letting him find there a cheerful companion, an agreeable intimate, a useful assistant, a faithful friend, and (in its time perhaps) a tender mother, such change of life, from what I lead, seems not unwise to think of. Lord Love. I begin to think it might. Sir Char. Think on, 'twill give you ease. \u2014 The man who has courage enough to part with a wife, need not much dread the having one ; and he that has not ought to tremble at being a husband.\u2014 But perhaps I have said too much ; you'll pardon, however, the freedom of an old friend, because you know I am so ; so your servant. Lord Love. Charles, farewell ! I can take no thing as ill meant that comes from you.\u2014 [Exit Sir Charles.] Nor ought my wife to think I mean amiss to her, if I convince her I'll endure no longer that she should thus expose herself and me. No doubt 'twill grieve her sorely. Physic's a loathsome thing till we find it gives us health, and then we are thankful to those who made us take it. Perhaps she may do so by me ; if she does 'tis well ; if not, and she resolves to make the house ring with reprisals, I believe (though the misfortune's great) he'll make a better figure in the world who keeps an ill wife out of doors than he that keeps her within. [Exit. Lord Love. Not unwise to purchase, if to be had for millions ; but \u2014 Sir Char. But what ? Lord Love. If the reverse of this should chance to be the bitter disappointment, what would the life be then ? Sir Char. A damned one. Lord Love. And what relief ? Sir Char. A short one ; leave it, and return to that you left, if you can't find a better. Lord Love.

Ah, madam, two years keeping company with the polite people of the town will do wonders in the improvement of a lady, so she has it but about her. Airs. Moth. Why, my lord, madam, is a little humoursome, they say. Lady Head. Humoursome ! Airs. Aloth. Yes, they say he's humoursome. Lady Head. As how, pray ? Airs. Aloth.

My lord, says I, beggars must not be choosers ; but some place about a thousand a-year, I believe, might do pretty weel to begin with. Sir Francis, says he, I shall be glad to serve you in anything I can ; and in saying these words he gave me a squeeze by the hand, as much as to say, I'll do your business. And so he turned to a lord that was there, who looked as if he came for a place too. Enter Sir Francis. How do you do, sir ? I'm afraid these late parlia ment hours won't agree with you. Sir Fran. Indeed, I like them not, Mrs. Mo therly ; if they would dine at twelve o'clock as we do in the country, a man might be able to drink a reasonable bottle between that and supper-time. Mrs. Moth.

Enter Moneybag to the door, ivith a purse in his hand. Lady Ara. Yes, for you should never think of writing a receipt till the money is in your pocket. Short. Why, I did think 'twas in my pocket. Trus. Look you, thinking again ! Indeed, Mr. Shortyard, you make so many blunders, 'tis impos sible but you must suffer by it, in your way of trade. I'm sorry for you, and you'll be undone. Short. And well I may, when I sell my goods to people that won't pay me for 'em, till the interest of my money eats out all my profit : I sold them so cheap, because I thought I should be paid the next day. Trus. Why, there again ! there's another of your thoughts. Paid the next day ! and you han't been paid this twelvemonth, you see. Short. Oons, I han't been paid at all, mistress. Lady Ara. Well, tradesmen are strange, unrea sonable creatures, refuse to sell people any more things, and then quarrel with 'em because they don't pay for those they have had already. Now, what can you say to that, Mr. Shortyard? Short. Say! why \u2014 'sdeath, madam, I don't know what you talk of, I don't understand your argu ment. My lady says, you must not pay the money to-day, there's a mistake in the account, which she must examine ; and she's afraid too there was a false guinea or two left in the purse, which might dis grace her. \u2014 [Twitches the purse from him.'] But she's too busy to look for 'em just now, so you must bid Mr. What-d'ye-call-'em come another time. \u2014 [Exit Moneybag.] There they are, madam. \u2014 [Gives Lady Arabella the money.] The poor things were so near gone they made me tremble. I fancy your ladyship will give me one of those false guineas for good luck. \u2014 [Takes a guinea ] Thank you, madam. Lady Ara. Why, I did not bid you take it. Trus. No, but your ladyship looked as if you were just going to bid me, so I took it to save your ladyship the trouble of speaking. Lady Ara.

Trus. He's in a bitter passion with poor Money bag ; I believe he'll beat him. \u2014 Lord, how he swears ! Lady Ara. Why, what do you understand, man ? Short. Why, I understand that I have had above a hundred pounds due to me a year ago; that I came by appointment just now to receive it ; that it proved at last to be but thirty instead of a hun dred and ten ; and that, while the steward was telling even that out, and I was writing the receipt, comes Mrs. Pop here, and the money was gone. But I'll be bantered no longer if there's law iu England. Say no more, Shortyard. [Exit. Trus. What a passion the poor devil's in ! Lady Ara. Why, truly, one can't deny but he has some present cause for a little ill-humour; but when one has things of so much greater consequence on foot, one can't trouble oneself about making such creatures easy ; so call for breakfast, Trusty, and set the hazard-table ready ; if there comes no com pany I'll play a little by myself. Lady Ara. And a sober citizen too ! that's a shame. Trus. He says he will speak with you, madam, though the devil held your door. \u2014 Lord ! he's coming hither full drive, but I'll luck him out. Lady Ara. No matter, let him come : I'll reason with him. Trus. But he's a saucy fellow for all that. Enter Shortyard, What would you have, sir? Short. I would have my due, mistress. Trus. That would be \u2014 to be well cudgelled, master, for coming so familiarly where you should not come. Lady Ara. Do you think you do well, sir, to intrude into my dressing-room ? Short. Madam, I sold my goods to you in your dressing-room, I don't know why I mayn't ask for my money there. Lady Ara. You are very short, sir. Short. Your ladyship won't complain of my patience being so ? Lady Ara. I complain of nothing that ought not to be complained of; but I hate ill manners. Short. So do I, madam \u2014 but this is the seven teenth time I have been ordered to come, with good manners, for my money, to no purpose. Lady Ara. Your money, man ! is that the matter ? Why it has lain in the steward's hands this week for you. Short. Madam, you yourself appointed me to come this very morning for it. Lady Ara. But why did you come so late then ? Short. So late !

Thy condition, fellow, is preferable to mine ; the merciful bullet, more kind than thy ungrateful country, has given thee a debenture in thy broken leg, from which thou canst draw a more plentiful maintenance than I from all my limbs in perfection. Prithee, friend, why wouldst thou beg of me? dost think I'm rich? Crip. No, sir, and therefore I believe you chari table. Your warm fellows are so far above the sense of our misery, that they can't pity us ; and I have always found it, by sad experience, as need less to beg of a rich man as a clergyman. Our greatest benefactors, the brave officers, are all dis banded, and must now turn beggars like myself; and so, times are very hard, sir. Roe.

Yes, 'faith, a great many wear horns : but we had that, among other laudable fashions, from London. I think it came over with your mode of wearing high topknots ; for ever since, the men and wives bear their heads exalted alike. They were both fashions that took wonderfully. Pin. We masks are the purest privateers ! \u2014 Madam, how would you like to cruise about a little ? Luc. Then you have ladies among you ? Roe. Yes, yes, we have ladies, and whores, colleges and playhouses, churches and taverns, fine houses and bawdy-houses: in short, everything that you can boast of, but fops, poets, toads, and adders. Luc. Well enough, had we no enemies but our fops and cits : but I dread these blustering men of-war, the officers, who, after a broadside of damme's and sinkme's, are for boarding all masks they meet as lawful prize. Luc. But have you no beaux at all ? Roe. Yes ; they come over like the woodcocks, Pin.

My dear Roebuck ! \u2014 [Fling down their swords, and embrace.] Shall I believe my eyes ? Boe. You may believe your ears; 'tis I, by Gad ! Love. What, do you hold no innate principle of virtue in women ? Roe. I hold an innate principle of love in them. Their passions are as great as ours, their reason weaker. We admire them, and consequently they must us. And I tell thee once more, that had women no safeguard but your innate principle of virtue, honest George Roebuck would have lain with your sister, Ned, and should enjoy a countess before night. Love. But methinks, George, 'twas not fair to tempt my sister. Boe. Methinks \"twas not fair of thy sister, Ned, to tempt me. As she was thy sister, I had no design upon her ; but as she's a pretty woman, I could scarcely forbear her, were she my own. Lore. But, upon serious reflection, could not you have lived better at home by turning thy whore into a wife, than here by turning other men's wives into whores ? There are merchants' ladies in London, and you must trade with them, for aught I see. Boe. Ay, but is the trade open ? is the manu facture encouraged, old boy ? Love. Oh, wonderfully ! \u2014 a great many poor people live by't. Though the husbands are for engrossing the trade, the wives are altogether for encouraging interlopers. But I hope you have brought some small stock to set up with ? Roe. [Aside.] The greatness of my wants, which would force me to discover 'em, makes me blush to own 'em. \u2014 [Aloud.] Why faith, Ned, I had a great journey from Ireland hither, and would burden myself with no more than just necessary charges. Love. Why, thy being in London is such a mystery, that I must have the evidence of more senses than one to confirm me of its truth. \u2014 But pray unfold the riddle. Boe. Why 'faith, 'tis a riddle. You wonder at it before the explanation, then wonder more at yourself for not guessing it. \u2014 What is the universal cause of the continued evils of mankind ? Love. The universal cause of our continued evil is the devil, sure ! Boe. No, 'tis the flesh, Ned. \u2014That very woman that drove us all out of Paradise, has sent me a packing out of Ireland. Love. How so I Boe. Only tasting the forbidden fruit, that was all. Lore. Is simple fornication become so great a crime there as to be punishable by no less than banishment ? Boe. Egad, mine was double fornication, Ned ! \u2014The jade was so pregnant to bear twins, the fruit grew in clusters ; and my unconscionable father, because I was a rogue in debauching her, would make me a fool by wedding her. But I would not marry a whore, and he would not own a disobedient son, and so \u2014 Love. But was she a gentlewoman ? Roe. Psha ! no ; she had no fortune. She wore Love. Oh, then you have brought bills? Boe. No, faith, exchange of money from Dublin hither, is so unreasonable high, that \u2014 - Love. What ? indeed a silk manteau and high-head ; but these are grown as little signs of gentility now-a-days as that is of chastity. Love. But what necessity forced you to leave the kingdom ? Boe.

When you appeared, I was just thanking my stars for sending me a throat to cut, and consequently a purse : but my knowledge of you prevented me of that way, and therefore I think you're obliged in return to assist me by some better means. You were once an honest fellow ; but so long study in the inns may alter a man strangely, as you say. Love. No, dear Roebuck, I'm still a friend to thy virtues, and esteem thy follies as foils only to set them off. I did but rally you ; and to convince you, here are some pieces, share of what I have about me : take them as earnest of my farther supply. You know my estate sufficient to maintain us both, if you will either restrain your extrava gancies, or I retrench my necessaries. Roe. Thy profession of kindness is so great, that I couid almost suspect it of design. But come, friend, 1 am heartily tired with the fatigue of my journey, besides a violent fit of sickness, which detained me a month at Coventry, to the exhausting my health and money. Let me only recruit by a relish of the town in love and a bottle, and then\u2014 O heavens ! and earth ! and you know, Mr. Lovewell, that he's such a handsome man, and has so many ways of insinuat ing, that the frailty of woman's nature could not resist him.

I'm sure you have seen Mr. Roebuck, and I'm sure 'twould be the first thing he would tell you. I refer it to you, Mr. Lovewell, if he is not an ungrateful man, to deal so barbarously with any woman that had used him so civilly. I was kinder to him than I would have been to my own bom brother. Love. Oh, then I find kissing goes by favour, Mrs. Trudge. Trudge. Faith, you're all alike, you men are alike. \u2014 Poor child ! he's as like his own dadda as if he were spit out of his mouth. See, Mr. Love well, if he has not Mr. Roebuck's nose to a hair ; and you know he has a very good nose ; and the little pigsny has mamma's mouth. \u2014 Oh, the little lips! and 'tis the best-natured little dear! \u2014 [Smug gles and kisses it.] And would it ask its god father blessing ? \u2014 Indeed, Mr. Lovewell, I believe the child knows you. Love. Ha ! ba ! ha ! well, I will give it my blessing. [Gives it gold. [As they are going off. Roebuck starts back surprised. Love. What's the matter, man ? Roe.

Love. Mrs. Trudge ! my old acquaintance? Roe. Ay, ay, the very same ; your old acquaint ance ; and for aught I know, you might have clubbed about getting the brats. Love. 'Tis but reasonable then I should pay share at the reckoning.

I'll withdraw till she has discharged her first volley, then surprise her. [Retires behind. Re-enter Lucinda and Pindress, who seeing the others instantly abscond. Come, madam, I'll first settle you in a lodging, and then find the false man, as you call him. [Exit with Thudge. Luc.

Pin. Your conjecture, madam, bears a colour; for looking back, I could perceive 'em talking very familiarly ; so that they could not be strangers as their pretended quarrel would intimate. Luc. 'Tis all true as he is false. \u2014 What, slighted! despised ! my honourable love trucked for a whore ! O villain! epitome of thy sex! \u2014 But I'll be revenged. I'll marry the first man that asks me the question; nay, though he be a disbanded soldier, or a poor poet, or a senseless fop ; \u2014 nay, though impotent, I'll marry him. Pin. O madam ! that's to be revenged on yourself. Enter Trudge, with a child crying. Trudge. Hush, hush, hush ! \u2014 And indeed it was a young traveller! \u2014 And what would it say? It says that daddy is a false man, a cruel man, and au uograteful man. \u2014 In troth so he is, my dear child. \u2014 What shall I do with it, poor creature ? \u2014 Hush, hush, hush ! \u2014 Was ever poor woman in such a lamentable condition ? immediately after the pains of one travail, to undergo the fatigues of another ! \u2014 But I'm sure he can never do well ; for though I can't find him, my curses, and the misery of this babe, will certainly reach him.

I'm very glad to see you, \u2014 and yet am ashamed to see you. But indeed he promised to marry me, [Crying] Luc. I care not, fool ! I deserve punishment for my credulity, as much as he for his falsehood. \u2014 And you deserve it too, minx ; your persuasions drew me to this assignation : I never loved the false man. Pin. That's false, I'm sure. [Aside. Luc. But you thought to get another piece of gold. We shall have him giving you money on the same score he was so liberal to his whore just now.

You have a ticklish point to manage. \u2014 Can you tell, sir, what's her quarrel to you now? Love. I can't imagine. I don't remember that ever I offended her. Luc.

Brush. That's the first wise word you have spo ken these two months. Brush. That's it, sir. She resolves to put your easiness to the test now, that she may with more security rely upon't hereafter \u2014 Always suspect those women of designs that are for searching into the humours of their courtiers ; for they certainly intend to try them when they're married. Love. How earnest thou such an engineer in love ? Love. Trouble me with your untimely jests, sirrah, and I'll \u2014 Brush. Your pardon, sir ; I'm in downright earnest. \u2014 [Aside.] 'Tis less slavery to be appren tice to a famous clap-surgeon, than to a lover. He falls out with me, because he can't fall in with his mistress. I can bear it no longer. Brush. I have sprung some mines in my time, sir ; and since I have trudged so long about your amorous messages, I have more intrigue in the sole of my feet, than some blockheads in their whole body. Love. Sirrah, have you ever discovered any be haviour in this lady to occasion this suspicious discourse ? Love. Sirrah, what are you mumbling ? Brush. A short prayer before I depart, sir. \u2014 I have been these three years your servant, but now, sir, I'm your humble servant. [Bows as going. Love. Hold ! you shan't leave me. Brush. Sir, you can't be my master. Love. Why so ? Brush. Because you're not your own master ; yet one would think you might, for you have lost your mistress. Oons, sir, let her go, and a fair riddance! Who throws away a tester and a mistress, loses six pence. That little pimping Cupid is a blind gunner. Had he shot as many darts as I have carried billets doux, he would have laid her kicking with her heels up ere now. In short, sir, my patience is worn to the stumps with attending ; my shoes and stockings are upon their last legs with trudging between you. I have sweat out all my moisture of my hand with palming your clammy letters upon her. I have \u2014 Love. Hold, sir, your trouble is now at an end, for I design to marry her. Brush. And have you courted her these three years for nothing but a wife ? Love. Do you think, rascal, I would have taken so much pains to make her a miss ? Brush. No, sir ; the tenth part on't would ha' done. \u2014 But if you are resolved to marry, God b'w'ye ! Love. What's the matter now, sirrah ! Brush. Sir, has this lady ever discovered any behaviour of yours to occasion this suspicious quarrel ? I believe the lady has as much of the innate principle of virtue (as the gentleman said) as any woman ; but that baggage, her attendant, is about ravishing her lady's page every hour. 'Tis an old saying, Like master, like man ; why not as well. Like mistress, like maid ? Love. [Aside.] Since thou art for trying hu mours, have with you, madam Lucinda! Besides, so fair an opportunity offers, that fate seemed to design it. \u2014 [Aloud.] Have you left the gentleman at my lodgings ? Brush. Yes, sir, and sent a porter to his inn to bring his things thither. Love. That's right. \u2014 Love, like other diseases, must sometimes have a desperate cure. The school of Venus imposes the strict discipline ; And awful Cupid is a chastening god ; He whips severely. Brush. No, not if we kiss the rod. [Exeunt.

O' my conscience, the fawning creature loves you. Roe. Ay, the constant effects of debauching a woman are, that she infallibly loves the man for doing the business, and he certainly hates her. \u2014 But what company is she like to have at this same widow's, Brush ? Roe. What other lodgers are there ? Brush. One newly entered, a young squire, just come from the university. Roe. A mere peripatetic, I warrant him. \u2014 A very pretty family ! a heathen philosopher, an English poet, and an Irish whore ! Had the landlady but a Highland piper to join with 'em, she might set up for a collection of monsters. \u2014 Anybody within ? [Slaps Lovew_ll on the shoulder. Love. Yes, you are my friend ; all my thoughts were employed about you. In short, I have one Brush. Oh, the best of company, sir ! a poet lives there, sir. Roe.

This poverty ! how it makes a man sneak ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Well, prithee let's know this devilish virtuous lady. By the circumstances of my body, I shall soon be off or on with her. Roe. That you would relinquish your precise sober behaviour, and live like a gentleman, as I do. Roe. That I can't grant. Roe. Then we're off: though should your wo men prove no better than your wine, my debauch eries will fall of themselves for want of temptation. Love. Our women are worse than our wine; our claret has but little of the French in't, but our wenches have the devil and all. They are both adulterated ; to prevent the inconveniences of which, I'll provide you an honourable mistress. Roe. An honourable mistress ! what's that ? Love. Know then, for thy utter condemnation, that she's a lady of eighteen, beautiful, witty, and nicely virtuous. Roe. A lady of eighteen ! good. \u2014 Beautiful ! better. \u2014 Witty ! best of all. \u2014 Now with these three qualifications, if she be nicely virtuous, then I'll henceforth adore everything that wears a petti coat. \u2014 Witty and virtuous ! ha! ha! ha! Why, 'tis as inconsistent in ladies as gentlemen ; and were I to debauch one for a wager, her wit should be my bawd. \u2014 Come, come, the forbidden fruit was plucked from the tree of knowledge, boy. Love. Right. \u2014 But there was a cunninger devil than you, to tempt. I'll assure you, George, your rhetoric would fail you here ; she should worst you at your own weapons. Roe. Ay, or any man in England, if she be eighteen, as you say. Love. Have a care, friend ; this satire will get you torn in pieces by the females ; you'll fall into Orpheus's fate. Roe. Orpheus was a blockhead, and deserved his fate. Love. A virtuous lady, whom you must love and court ; the surest method of reclaiming you. \u2014 As thus : those superfluous pieces you throw away in wine may be laid out \u2014 Roe. To the poor ? Lore. No, no ; in sweet-powder, cravats, garters, snuffboxes, ribbons, coach-hire, and chair-hire. Those idle hours which you misspend with lewd sophisticated wenches, must be dedicated \u2014 Roe. To the church ? Love. No ; to the innocent and charming con versation of your virtuous mistress ; by which means the two most exorbitant debaucheries, drinking and whoring, will be retrenched. Love. Why ? Roe. Because he went to hell for a wife. Roe. A very fine retrenchment truly ! I must first despise the honest jolly conversation at the tavern, for the foppish, affected, dull, insipid enter tainment at the chocolate- house ; must quit my freedom with ingenious company to harness myself to foppery among the fluttering crowd of Cupid's livery-boys ! \u2014 The second article is, that I must resign the company of lewd women for that of my innocent mistress ; that is, I must change my easy natural sin of wenching, to that constrained de bauchery of lying and swearing. \u2014 The many lies and oaths that I made to thy sister, will go nearer to damn me, than if I had enjoyed her a hundred times over. Love. [Aside.] This happens right. \u2014 [Aloud.] But you shall go to heaven for a mistress, you shall court this divine creature\u2014 I don't desire you to fall in love with her ; I don't intend you should marry her neither : but you must be convinced of the chastity of the sex ; though if you should con quer her, the spoil, you rogue, will be glorious, and infinitely worth the pains in attaining. Roe. Ay, but Ned, my circumstances, my cir cumstances ! Love. Come, you shan't want money. Roe. Then I dare attempt it. Money is the sinews of love, as of war. Gad, friend, thou'rt the bravest pimp I every heard of. \u2014 Well, give me directions to sail by, the name of my port, lade my pockets, and then for the Cape of Good Hope. Love. You need no directions as to the man ner of courtship. Love. O Roebuck ! your reason will maintain the contrary when you're in love. Roe. That is, when I have lost my reason. \u2014 Come, come, a wench, a wench ! a soft, white, easy, consenting creature ! \u2014 Prithee, Ned, leave mustiness, and show me the varieties of the town. Love. A wench is the least variety. \u2014 Look out \u2014 see what a numerous train trip along the street there ! [Pointing outwards. Roe. O Venus ! all these fine stately creatures ! Fare you well, Ned! \u2014 [Runs out; Lovewell catches him and pulls him back.] Prithee let me go ; 'tis a deed of charity ; I'm quite starved. I'll just take a snap, and be with you in the twink- ling. \u2014 As you're my friend \u2014 I must go. Love. Then we must break for all together. \u2014 [Quits him.] He that will leave his friend for a whore, I reckon a commoner in friendship as in love. Roe. No ; I have seen some few principles on which my courtship's founded, which seldom fail. To let a lady rely upon my modesty, but to depend myself altogether upon my impudence ; to use a mistress like a deity in public, but like a woman in private : to be as cautious then of asking an imper tinent question, as afterwards of telling a story ; remembering, that the tongue is the only member that can hurt a lady's honour, though touched in the tenderest part. Love. Oh ! but to a friend, George, you'll tell a friend your success ? Roe. No, not to her very self; it must be as private as devotion. \u2014 No blabbing unless a squall ing brat peeps out to tell tales. \u2014 But where lies my course ? Love. Brush shall show you the house ; the lady's name is Lucinda ; her father and mother dead ; she's heiress to twelve hundred a year. But above all, observe this : she has a page which you must get on your side ; 'tis a very pretty boy ; I Roe.

And what are you, good monsieur Sa, sa? \u2014 Stand upon your guard, Mr. Mockmode, he's the greatest falsifier in his art: he'll fill your head so full of French principles of honour, that you won't have one of honesty left. His breastplate there he calls the but of honour, at which all the fools in the kingdom shoot, and not one can hit the mark. Enter Nimblewrist. Alock. Oh, Mr. Nimblewrist, I crave you ten thousand pardons, by the universe ! Nimb That was a home thrust ! \u2014 Good sir, I hope you're for a breathing this morning? \u2014 [Takes down a foil.] I'll assure you, Mr. Mockmode, you will make an excellent swordsman ; you're as well shaped for fencing as any man in Europe. The duke of Burgundy is just of your make ; he pushes the finest of any man in France \u2014 Sa ! sa ! \u2014 like lightning. Alock. I'm much in love with fencing : but I think, backsword is the best play. Nimb. Oh Lard, sir ! \u2014 Have you ever been in France, sir ? Nimb. Y7ou talk of Robin Hood, who never shot in his bow, sir. \u2014 You dancers are the battledores of the nation, that toss the light foppish shuttle cocks to and again, to get yourselves in heat. \u2014 Have a care, Mr. Mockmode ; this fellow will make a mere grasshopper of you \u2014 Sir, you're the grand pimp to foppery and lewdness ; and the devil and a dancing-master dance a coranto over the whole kingdom. Mock. No, sir ; but I understand the geography of it\u2014 France is bounded on the north with the Rhine \u2014 Nimb. No, sir ; a Frenchman is bounded on the north with quart, on the south with tierce \u2014 and so forth. 'Tis a noble art, sir ; and every one that wears a sword is obliged by his tenure to learn. The rules of honour are engraved on my hilt, and my blade must maintain 'em. My sword's my herald, and the bloody hand my coat of arms. Alock. And how long have you professed this noble art, sir 5 Rig. A pimp, sir ! what then, sir ? I engage couples into the bed of love, but you match 'em in the bed of honour. We only juggle people out of their chastity, but you cheat 'em out of their lives W7e shall have you, Mr. Mockmode, grin ning in the bed of honour, as if you laughed at the fool who must be hanged for you. \u2014 Which is best, Mr. Nimblewrist, an easy minuet, or a Tyburn jig ? Nimb. Don't provoke my sword, sir, lest that art you so revile should revenge itself ; for every one of you that live by dancing should die by pushing, sir. Rig. And every man that lives by pushing, should die dancing, I take it. Nimb. Zoons, sir ! what d'ye mean ? Rig. Nothing, sir ; \u2014 tal \u2014 dal \u2014 deral ! \u2014 [Dances] This takes the ladies, Mr. Mockmode ; this runs away with all the great fortunes in town.

[Pushes at Rigadoon, who dances and sings, retiring off Nimb. Truly, sir, I served an apprenticeship to this trade, sir Mock. What, are ye a corporation then ? Nimb. Yes, sir! the surgeons have taken us into theirs, because we make so much work for 'em. \u2014 But, as I was telling you, sir, I professed this science till the wars broke out : but then, when everybody got commissions, I put in for one, served the campaigns in Flanders ; and when the peace broke out, was disbanded ; so among a great many other poor rogues, am forced to betake to my old trade. Now the public quarrel's ended, I live by private ones. I live still by dying, as the song goes, sir. While we have English courages, French honour, and Spanish blades among us, I shall live, sir. Mock. Surely your sword and skill did the king great service abroad ? Nimb. Yes, sir ; I killed above fifteen of our own officers by private duels in the camp, sir ; killed 'em fairly ; killed 'em thus, sir.\u2014 Sa ! sa ! sa ! sa !

He was as like you, Mr. Mockmode, as one egg is like another ; he died like an angel. But I am sure he might have recovered but for the physicians. \u2014 Oh, these doctors ! these doctors ! Moek.

I'll assure you, sir, they fit you very well, and I like your fancy mightily. Alock. Ay, ay, madam. But what's most modish for beverage ? for, I suppose, the fashion of that alters always with the clothes. Bull. The tailors are the best judges of that : \u2014 but champagne, I suppose. Mock.

Oh, I was told she was very reserved, though 'tis very much of a widow. I have often heard my mother say, that sitting at home, and silence, were very becoming in a maid ; and she has often chid my sister Dorothy for gadding out to the meadows, and tumbling among the cocks with the haymakers.

You must get a little mistress, and treat her with it. How bless'd are lovers in disguise! Like gods, they see, As I do thee, Unseen by human eyes. Exposed to view, I'm hid from you, I'm alter'd, yet the same : The dark conceals me, Love reveals me ; Love, which lights me by its flame. Were you not false, you me would know ; For though your eyes Could not devise, Your heart had told you so. Lean. Sir, I have one mistress already; and they say, no man can serve two masters, much less two mistresses. How many mistresses have you, pray ?

Oh ye powers ! and did you love 'em all? Boe. Yes, desperately. I would have drank and fought for any one of 'em : I have sworn and lied to every one of 'em, and have lain with 'em all : that's for your encouragement, boy.

My lady ! what business have you with my lady, pray, sir ? Roe. Don't ask questions. You know Mr. Lovewell ? Lean. And did not one escape ye ? Boe. Yes, one did ; \u2014 the devil take her ! Lean. What, don't you love her then ? Boe. No, faith ; but I bear her an amorous grudge still, something between love and spite T could kill her with kindness. Lean. I don't believe it, sir ; you could not be so hard-hearted sure : her honourable passion, I think, should please you best. Boe. O child ! boys of your age are continually reading romances, filling your heads with that old bombast of love and honour : but when you come to my years, you'll understand better things. Lean. And must I be a false treacherous villain when 1 come to your years, sir? Is falsehood and perjury essential to the perfect state of manhood ? Boe. Psha ! children and old men always talk thus foolishly. \u2014 You understand nothing, boy. Lean. Yes, sir, I've been in love, and much more than you, I perceive. Boe.

No, sir ; but wondrous melancholy, by the departure of a dear friend of hers to another world. Roe. Oh, that was the person mentioned in her letter, whose departure occasioned your departure for England. Lean.

Come, come, sir, he shan't slip his neck out of the collar for all that. Money I will have, and money I must have ; let your play and you both be damned ! Lean. Wild as winds, and unconfined as air ! \u2014 Yet I may reclaim him. His follies are weakly founded, upon the principles of honour, where the very foundation helps to undermine the structure. How charming would virtue look in him, whose behaviour can add a grace to the unseemliness of vice ! Re-enter Lucinda. Luc. What, is the gentleman gone ? Lean. Yes, madam. He was instantly taken ill with a violent pain in his stomach, and was forced to hurry away in a chair to his lodging. [Exit. Luc. Oh, poor gentleman ! He's one of those conceited fools that think no female can resist their temptations. Blockheads that imagine all wit to consist in blaspheming heaven and women. \u2014 I'll feed his vanity, but starve his love. And may all coxcombs meet no better fate, Who doubt our sex's virtue, or dare prompt our hate. {.Exit. Lyr. Well, madam, my bookseller is to bring me some twenty guineas for a few sheets of mine presently, which I hope will free me from your sheets. Bull. My sheets, Mr. Lyric I pray what d'ye mean ? I'll assure you, sir, my sheets are finer than any of your Muses' spinning \u2014 marry come up ! Lyr. Faith, you have spun me so fine, that you have almost cracked my thread of life; as may appear by my spindle-shanks. Bull. Why sure \u2014 where was your Thalia, and your Melpomene, when the tailor would have stripped you of your silk waistcoat, and have clapped you on a stone doublet? Would all your golden verse have paid the serjeant's fees ? Lyr. Truly, you freed me from jail, to confine me in a dungeon ; you did not ransom me, but bought me as a slave ; so, madam, I'll purchase my freedom as soon as possible. Flesh and blood can't bear it. SCENE II.\u2014 A Room in Widow Bullfinch's House. Lyric discovered in a nightgown and cap, writing at a table, on which are papers scattered about. Lyr. Two as good lines as ever were written ! \u2014 [Rising.] Egad I shall maul these topping fellows ! Says Mr. Lee, Let there be not one glimpse, one starry spark, But gods meet gods, and jostle in the dark. Says little Lyric, Let all the lights be burnt out to a snuff, And gods meet gods, and play at blindman's-buff. Very well ! Let gods meet gods, and so \u2014 fall out and cuff. That's much mended. They're as noble lines as ever were penned. \u2014 Oh ! here comes my damned muse ; I'm always in the humour of writing elegy after a little of her inspiration. Bull. Take your course, sir. \u2014 There were a couple of gentlemen just now to inquire for you; and if they come again, they shan't be put off with the old story of your being abroad, I'll promise you that, sir. [Exit. Lyr. Zoons ! if this bookseller does not bring me money \u2014 Enter Pamphlet. Oh ! Mr. Pamphlet, your servant. Have you perused my poems ? Pam. Yes, sir ; and there are some things very well, extraordinary well, Mr. Lyric. But I don't think 'em for my purpose. \u2014 Poetry is a mere drug, sir. Enter Widow Bullfinch. Bull. Mr. Lyric, what do you mean by all this ? Here you have lodged two years in my house, pro mised me eighteen-pence a week for your lodging, and I have never received eighteen farthings, not the value of that, Mr. Lyric. \u2014 [Snaps with her fingers.] You always put me off with telling me of your play, your play ! Sir, you shall play no more with me ; I'm in earnest. Lyr. Is that because I take physic when I write. \u2014 [Aside.] Damn this costive fellow, now does he not apprehend the joke ! Pam. No, sir ; but your name does not recom mend 'em. One must write himself into a con sumption before he gain reputation. Lyr. [Aside.] This living on love is the dearest lodging \u2014 a man's eternally dunned, though perhaps he have less of one ready coin than t'other. \u2014 [Aloud.] There's more trouble in a play than you imagine, madam. Lyr. That's the way to lie abed when his name's up. Now, I lie abed before I can gain reputation. Pam. WThy so, sir? Lyr. Because I have scarcely any clothes to put on. \u2014 If ever man did penance in a white sheet \u2014 Bull. There's more trouble with a lodger than you think, Mr. Lyric. Lyr. First, there's the decorum of time. Bull. Which you never observe : for you keep the worst hours of any lodger in town. Lyr. Then there's the exactness of characters. Bull. And you have the most scandalous one I ever heard. Pam. You stand only sometimes in a white sheet for your offences with your landlady. Faith, I have often wondered how your muse could take such flights, yoked to such a cartload as she is. Lyr. Oh ! they are like the Irish horses, they draw best by the tail.\u2014 Have you ever seen any of my burlesque, Mr. Pamphlet ? I have a project of turning three or four of our most topping fellows into doggrel. As for example : \u2014 [Beads. Lyr. Then there's laying the drama. Bull. Then you foul my napkins and towels."], [593, "LOVE AND A BOTTLE. 8CKNK II. 499 Conquest With laurels has our arms adorn'd, And Rome in tears of blood our anger mourn'd. 1 Bail.

If you have any occasion for books to carry into the country, I can furnish you as well as any man about Paul's. Where's Mr. Lyric ? 1 Bail. These wits are damnable cunning ! \u2014 I always have double fees for arresting one of you wits.

Zoons, gentlemen, I'm not the person I I'm a freeman of the city ; I have good effects, gentlemen, good effects. D'ye think to make a fool of me ? I'm a bookseller, no poet. 2 Bail. Ay, sir, we know what you are by your fool's cap there. 1 Bail. Yes, one of you wits would have passed upon us for a corn-cutter yesterday ; and was so like one we had almost believed him. [Hauls him. Pam. WThy, gentlemen ! gentlemen ! officers I have a little patience, and Mr. Lyric will come up stairs. Lyr. [Aside.] This is the most ingenious fellow of his trade that I have seen ; he understands a good thing [Aloud.] But as to our business. What are you willing to give for these poems ? Prithee say something. There are about three thousand lines. \u2014 Here, take 'em for a couple of guineas. Pam. No, sir ; paper is so excessive dear, that I dare not venture upon 'em. Lyr. Well, because you're a friend, I'll bestow 'em upon you. Here, take 'em all. \u2014 [Aside.] There's the hopes of a dedication still. Pam. I give you a thousand thanks, sir ; but I dare not venture the hazard ; they'll never quit cost indeed, sir. 1 Bail. No, no ; Mr. Lyric shall go down stairs. He would have us wait till some friends come in to rescue him. Ah ! these wits are devilish cunning. [Exeunt Bailiffs hauling Pamphlet. Re-enter Lyric, with Mockmode and Club. Lyr.

Mock. What was it ? what was it, Mr. Lyric ? Lyr. Why, I am a statesman, sir. \u2014 I can't but laugh to think how they'll spunge the sheet before the errata be blotted out ; and then how he'll hamper the dogs for false imprisonment. Lyr. [Aside.] This fellow is one of the greatest blockheads that ever was a member of a corpora tion.\u2014How shall I be revenged ? Enter Boy. Boy. Sir, there are two men below desire to have the honour of kissing your hand. Lyr. They must be knaves or fools, by their fulsome compliment. Hark ye \u2014 [ Whispers Boy.] Bid 'em walk up. Pam. Since you have got company, sir, I'll take my leave. Lyr. No, no, Mr. Pamphlet, by no means ! We must drink before we part. Boy, a pint of sack and a toast. \u2014 [Exit Boy.] These are two gentle men out of the country, who will be for all the new things lately published ; they'll be good cus tomers. Come, sit down. \u2014 You have not seen my play yet ? \u2014 Here take the pen, and if you see any thing amiss correct it ; I'll go bring 'em up. \u2014 Stay, lend me your hat and wig, or I shall take cold going down stairs. [Takes Pamphlet's hat and wig, and puts his cap on Alock. But pray, what's the matter, Mr. Lyric ? Lyr. Nothing, sir, but a shirking bookseller that owed me about forty guineas for a few lines. He would have put me off, so I sent for a couple of bull- dogs, and arrested him. Alock. Oh Lord ! Mr. Lyric, honesty's quite out of doors ; 'tis a rare thing to find a man that's a true friend, a true friend is a rare thing indeed ! Mr. Lyric, will you be my friend ? I only want that accomplishment. I have got a mistress, a dancing and fencing-master ; and now I want only a friend to be a fine gentleman. Lyr. Have you never had a friend, sir? Alock. Yes, a very honest fellow ; our friend ship commenced in the college-cellar, and we loved one another like two brothers, till we unluckily fell out afterwards at a game at tables. Lyr. [Aside.] I find then that neither of ye lost by the set. \u2014 [Aloud.] But my short acquaint ance can't recommend me to such a trust. Pamphlet's head, and exit. Pam.

Alock. Psha, acquaintance! \u2014 You must be a man of honour, as you're a poet, sir ? Lyr. But what use would you make of a friend, sir ? . Alock. Only to tell my secrets to, and be my second. \u2014 Now, sir, a wit must be best to keep a secret, because what you say to one's prejudice will be thought malice. Then you must have a devilish deal of courage, by your heroic writing.\u2014 But know, that I alone am king of me. 1 Bail. Sir, you're the king's prisoner. Pam. That's a good fancy enough, Mr. Lyric ! But pray don't interrupt me, I'm in the best scene. Egad the drama is very well laid. 2 Bail. Come, sir. Pam. Well, well, sir, I'll pledge ye.

[Reads, Pert blockhead, who has purchased by the school Just sense enough to make a noted fool. That stings, Mr. Lovewell. Lohe. Pray, sir, let me see it. Lyr. This is imperfect, sir : but if you please to give your judgment on this piece. \u2014 [Gives him a paper.] 'Tis a piece of burlesque on some of our late writings. Love. Ay, you poets mount first on the shoulders of your predecessors, to see farther in making dis coveries ; and having once got the upper-hand, you spurn them under-foot. I think you should bear a veneration to their very ashes. Lyr. Ay, if most of their writings had been burned ! I declare, Mr. Lovewell, their fame has only made them the more remarkably faulty : their great beauties only illustrate their greater errors. Love. Well, you saw the new tragedy last night; how did it please ye ? Lyr. Very well ; it made me laugh heartily. Love. What, laugh at a tragedy ! Lyr. I laugh to see the ladies cry ; to see so many weep at the death of the fabulous hero. Who would but laugh, if the poet that made 'em were hanged ! On my conscience, these tragedies make the ladies vent all their love and honour at their eyes, when the same white handkerchief that blows their noses, must be a winding-sheet to the deceased hero. Pin. I hope your ladyship entertains no ill opinion of my virtue. Luc. Truly I don't know what to think on't : but I've so good an opinion of your sense, as to believe you would not play the fool with a child. Pin. We're all subject to playing the fool, if you continue your resolution in marrying the first man that asks you the question. Luc. No, my mind's changed ; I'll never marry any man. Pin. [Aside.] I dare swear that resolution breaks sooner than the former. \u2014 [Aloud.] Ah, madam, madam ! if you never believe man again, you must never be woman again ; for though we are as cunning as serpents, we are naturally as flexible too. Speak ingenuously, madam ; if Mr. Lovewell should, with an amorous whine, and suppliant cringe, tell you a formal story, contrary to what we suspect, would you not believe him ? Luc. What, believe his vain assertions before the demonstration of my senses ! no, no ; my love's not so blind. Did I not see his miss and his child? did I not behold him giving her money ? did I not hear him declare he would settle her in a lodging ? Pin. But, madam, upon serious reflection, where's the great harm in all this ? Most ladies would be overjoyed at such a discovery of their lover's ability. The child seemed a lusty chopping boy ; and let me tell you , madam, it must be a lusty chopping boy that got it. Luc. Urge no farther in his defence ; he's a vil lain, and of all villains that I hate most, an hypo critical one. The ladies give him the epithet of modest, and the gentlemen that of sober Lovewell. Now methinks, such a piece of debauchery sits so awkwardly on a person of his character, that it adds an unseemliness to the natural vileness of the vice ; and he that dares be a hypocrite in religion, will certainly be one in love Stay, is not that he ? [Pointing outwards. Love. Then there's something in the handker chief to embalm him, Mr. Lyric ? ha ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 But what relish have you of comedy ? Lyr. No satisfactory one : my curiosity is fore stalled by a foreknowledge of what shall happen ; for as the hero in tragedy is either a whining cringing fool, that's always a-stabbing himself, or a ranting, hectoring bully, that's for killing every body else : so the hero in comedy is always the poet's character. Love. What's that ? Pin. Yes, madam ; I believe he's going to the Park. Luc. Call a couple of chairs quickly ; we'll thither masked. \u2014 [Exit Pindress.] This day's adven tures argue some intended plot upon me, which I may countermine by only setting a face upon the matter. [Puts her mask on. Lyr. A compound of practical rake and specu lative gentleman, who always bears off the great fortune in the play, and shams the beau and squire with a whore or chambermaid : and as the cata strophe of all tragedies is death, so the end of comedies is marriage. Love, kn* some think that the most tragical conclusion of the two. For as hypocrisy in men can move, Here's the best hypocrite in female love. On even scores designing Heaven took care ; Since men false hearts, that we false faces wear. [Exit. SCENE II.\u2014 The Park. Lyr.

Because they play the fool, conscious that it will please ; and you're a wit, when sensible that coxcombs only are encouraged. I wonder, Mr. Lyric, that a man of your sense should turn poet ! You'll hardly ever rind a man that is capable of the employment will undertake it. Lyr. The reason of that is, every one that knows not a tittle of the matter pretends to be a judge of it. By the Lard, Mr. Lovewell, I put the critics next to plague, pestilence, and famine, in my litany ! Had you seen 'em last night in the pit, with such demure supercilious faces.\u2014 their contem plative wigs thrust judiciously backwards \u2014 their hands rubbing their temples, to chafe ill-nature, and with a hissing venomous tongue pronouncing, Pish ! Stuff ! Intolerable ! Damn him ! \u2014 Lord have mercy upon us ! Enter Mockmode, leading Trudoe dressed like a Widow. Alock. This is very fine weather, blessed weather indeed, madam ! 'twill do abundance of good to the grass and corn. Trudge. Ay, sir, the days are grown a great length ; and I think the weather much better here than in Ireland. Alock. Why, madam, were you ever there ? Trudge. Oh, no ! not I indeed, sir ; but I have heard my first husband (rest his soul !) say so. \u2014 He was an Irish gentleman. Alock. I find, madam, you have loved your first husband mightily, for you affect his tone in dis course. \u2014 Pray, madam, what did that mourning cost a yard ? Trudge. [Aside.] O Lard 1 what shall I say now ? 'tis none of mine. \u2014 [Aloud.] It cost, sir, \u2014 let me see \u2014 it cost about \u2014 but it was my steward bought it for me ; I never buy such small things. Alock. [Aside.] By the universe, she must be plaguy rich ! I will be brisk. \u2014 [Aloud.] Pray, madam \u2014 I \u2014 I Pray, madam, will you give us a song ? Trudge. A song ! \u2014 Indeed then I had a good voice before Mr. Roebuck spoiled it. Alock. Mr. Roebuck ! was that your first hus band's name, madam ? Love. [Behind.] She'll spoil all. Trudge. No, sir : Roebuck was a doctor that let me blood under the tongue for the quinsy, and made me hoarse ever since. Love. Ay, and you shall have others as foolish as they are ill-natured ; fond of being thought wits, who shall laugh outrageously at every smutty jest ; cry, Very well, by Gad ! That's fine, by heavens ! \u2014 and if a distich of rhyme happens, they clap so damnably loud that they drown the jest. Lyr. That's the jest ! the wit lies in their hands. And if you would tell a poet his fortune, you must gather it from the palmistry of the audience ; for as nothing's ill said but what's ill taken, so nothing's well said but what's well taken. And between you and I, Mr. Lovewell, poetry, without these laugh ing fools, were a bell without a clapper ; an empty sounding business, good for nothing ; and all we professors might go hang ourselves in the bell ropes ! Love. Ha ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 But I thought poetry was instructive. Alock. [Aside.] By the universe, she's a widow, and I'll be a little brisk ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Madam, will you grant me a small favour, and I will bend upon my knees to receive it ? [Kneels. Trudge. WThat is't, pray ? Alock. Only to take off your garter. Re-enter Lovewell. Love. [Aside.] Zoons ! her thick leg will dis cover all ! \u2014 [Aloud.] By your leave, sir, have you any pretensions to this lady ? [Pushes Mockmode down. Alock. [Aside.] I don't know whether this be an affront or not. \u2014 [Aloud.] Pretensions, sir ! I have so great a veneration for the lady, that I honour any man that has pretensions to her. \u2014 Demme, sir ! may I crave the honour of your acquaintance ? Love. No, sir. Alock. [Aside.] No, sir ! egad that must be wit, for it can't be good manners! \u2014 [Aloud. ] Sir, I respect all men of sense, and would therefore beg to know your name. Love. No matter, sir ; I know your name's Mockmode. Lyr. Oh, Gad forgive me, that's true ! \u2014 To ladies it is morally beneficial : for you must know, they are too nice to read sermons \u2014 such instruc- tions are too gross for their refined apprehensions ; but any precepts that may be instilled by easy numbers, such as of Rochester, and others, make great converts. Then they hate to hear a fellow in church preach methodical nonsense, with a firstly, secondly, and thirdly : but they take up with some of our modern plays in their closet, where the morality must be devilish instructive ! \u2014 But I must be gone ; \u2014 here comes the squire. What, in the name of wonder, has he got with him ? Love. That which shall afford you a more plen- tiful revenge than your lampoon, if you join with n.e in the plot. To the better effecting of which, you must be seemingly reconciled to him. Let's step aside, and observe 'em while I give you a hint of the matter. Alock. By the universe, that's very comical 1 That a fellow should pretend to tell me my own name !\u2014 Another question, if you please, sir. Love. What is it, sir ? Alock. Pray, sir, what's my christened name ? Love. Sir, you don't know. Alock. Zauns, sir ! would you persuade me out of my christened name ? I'll lay you a guinea that I do know, by the universe 1 \u2014 [Pulls a hand ful of money out.] Here's silver, sir ; here's silver, sir ; I can command as much money as another, sir ; I am at age, sir, and I won't be bantered, [Exeunt between the scenes, and seem to confer and hearken. sir !"], [598, "504 LOVE AND A BOTTLE. ACT IV. Love. Sir, you must know that I baptise you Rival ; for your love to this lady is the only sign of Christianity you can boast of. \u2014 And now, sir, my name's Lovewell. 2 Mask. Pray, sir, be civil ; you're mistaken, sir. \u2014 [Aside.] I have had an eye upon this fellow all this afternoon. \u2014 [Aloud.] You're mistaken, sir. Boe. Very likely, madam ; for I imagined you modest. Mock. Then I say, sir, that your love to that lady is the only sign of a Turk you can brag of. \u2014 \\ Aside.] I wish Club were come. Love. Sir, I shall certainly circumcise you, if you make any farther pretensions to madam Lu cinda here. 2 Mask. So I am, for I'm married. Roe. And married to your sorrow, I warrant you ! 2 Mask. Yes, upon my honour, sir. Roe. I knew it. I have met above a dozen this evening, all married to their sorrow. \u2014 Then I sup pose you're a citizen's wife ; and by the broadness of your bottom, I should guess you sat very much behind a counter. Mock. Circumcise me ! circumcise a pudding's end, sir ! \u2014 Zauns, sir ! I'll be judged by the lady who merits circumcision most, you or I, sir. \u2014 These London blades are all stark mad ! \u2014 [Lovewell courts Trudge m dumb show. 2 Mask. My husband's no mercer, he's a judge. Roe. Zoons, a judge ! I shall be arraigned at the bar for keeping on my hat so long. \u2014 'Tis very hard, madam, he should not do you justice : has not he an estate in tail, madam ? Enter Lucinda and Pindress, seeing the others they abscond. I met one about two hours ago that had forgot his name, and this fellow would persuade me now that I had forgot mine ! \u2014 Mr. Lyric is the only man that speaks plain to me : I must be friends with him, because I find I may have occasion for such a friend. \u2014 I'll find him out straight. [Exit. Love. Madam, will you walk? [Exit with Trudge. Luc. [Coming forward.] Now my doubts are removed ! 2 Mask. I seldom examine his papers ; they are a parcel of old dry shrivelled parchments ; and this court-hand is so devilish crabbed I can't endure it. Roe. Umph ! \u2014 Then I suppose, madam, you want a young lawyer to put your case to. But faith, madam, I am a judge too. 2 Mask. Oh heavens forbid ! Such a young man ! Roe. That's, I'll do nothing without a bribe. \u2014 Pray, madam, how does that watch strike ? 2 Mask. It never strikes, it only points to the business, as you must do, without telling tales. Dare you meet me two hours hence ? Boe. Ay, madam, but I shall never hit the time exactly without a watch. 2 Mask, Well, take it. \u2014 At ten exactly, at the fountain in the Middle-Temple. Coke upon Littleton be the word. [Exit. Roe. So \u2014 If the law be all such volumes as thou, mercy on the poor students ! From Coke upon Littleton in sheets deliver me. Pin. Mine are more puzzling. There must be something in this more than we imagine. You had best talk to him. Luc. Yes, if my tongue bore poison in it, and that I could spit death in his face ! Pin. If he is lost, your hard usage this morn ing has occasioned it. Luc. I'm glad on't ; I've gained by the loss ; I despise him more now than e'er I loved him ! That passion which can stoop so low as that blowze, is an object too mean for anything but my scorn to level at ! Pin. This were a critical minute for your new lover the squire, I fancy ; Mr. Lovewell's disgrace would bring him into favour presently. Luc. It certainly shall, if he be not as great a fool as t'other's false. Enter Lovewell. Love. What, engaged ? Myrmidon ! I find you'll never quit the battle till you have cracked a pike in the service. Roe. Oh, dear friend ! thou'rt critically come to my relief; for faith I'm almost tired. Love. What a miserable creature is a whore ! whom every fool dares pretend to love, and every wise man hates. Pin. You may be mistaken in your opinion of him, as much as you have been in Mr. Lovewell. Luc. No, Pindress ; I shall find what I read in the last miscellanies very true. But two distinctions their whole sex does part ; All fools by nature ; or all rogues by art. [Exeunt Roe. What, moralising again ! Oh, I'll tell thee news, man ; I'm entered in the inns, by the Lard ! Love. Psha ! Roe. Nay, if you won't believe me, see my note of admission. [Shows the watch. SCENE III. \u2014 Another part of the same. Love. A gold watch, boy 1 Roe. Ay, a gold watch, boy. Love. Whence had you money to buy it ? Roe. I took it upon tick, and I design to pay honestly. Love. I don't like this running o'th' score. \u2014 But what news from Lucinda, boy? is she kind? ha? Enter several Masks crossing the stage, Roebuck following. Roe. 'Sdeath ! what a coney-borough's here ! the trade goes swimmingly on. This is the great empory of lewdness, as the Change is of knavery. The merchants cheat the world there, and their wives gull them here. I begin to think whoring scan dalous, 'tis grown so mechanical. My modesty will do me no good, I fear. \u2014 Madam, are you a whore ? [Catches a Mask. 1 Alask. Yes, sir. [Exit. Roe. Short and pithy ! \u2014 If ever woman spoke truth I believe thou hast. \u2014 [Second Mask pulls him by the elbow.] Have you any business with me, madam ? Enter a Mask crossing the stage. Roe. Ha! there's a stately cruiser ; I must give her one chase. \u2014 I'll tell you when I return. [Exit, running. Love. I find he has been at a loss there, which occasions his eagerness for the game here. I begin to repent me of my suspicion ; I believe her virtue so sacred, that 'tis a pieoe of atheism to"], [599, "LOVE AND A BOTTLE. SCENE III. 505 distrust its existence. But jealousy in love, like the devil in religion, is still raising doubts, which without a firm faith in what we adore, will certainly damn us. Love. Thou'rt horn mad. Prithee leave imper tinence. \u2014 I received a note just now. Roe A note! 'sdeath, what note! what d'ye mean ? who brought it ? Love. A gentleman ; 'tis a challenge. Roe. Oh, thanks to the stars ! I'm glad on't. [Aside. Love. And you may be signally serviceable to me in this affair. I can give you no greater testi mony of my affection than by making so free with you. Enter a Porter. Por. Is your name Mr. Roebuck, sir ? Love. What would you have with Mr. Roebuck, sir? Por. I have a small note for him, sir. Love. Let me see't. Por. Ay, sir ; if your name be Mr. Roebuck, sir. Roe. What needs all this formality ? I'll be thy second, without all this impertinence. Love. There's more than that, friend. In the first place 1 don't understand a sword; and again, I'm to be called to the bar this term, and such a ousiness might prejudice me extremely. So, sir, you must meet and fight for me. Roe. Faith, Lovewell, I shan't stick to cut a throat for my friend at any time, so I may do it fairly, or so. \u2014 The hour and place ? Love. This very evening, in Moorfields. Roe. Umph ! how will you employ yourself the while ? Love. My name is Roebuck, blockhead. Por. God bless you, master. [Gives him a letter, and exit. Love. This is some tawdry billet, with a scrawl ing adieu at the end on't. These strolling jades know a young wholesome fellow newly come to town, as well as a parson's wife does a fat goose.

Oh, Heavens! Certainly it can't be! L, U, C, I, N, D, A ; that spells woman. 'Twas never written so plain before. Roebuck, thou'rt as true an oracle as she's a false one. Oh, thou damned Sibyl ! I have courted thee these three years, and could never obtain above a kiss of the hand, and this fellow in an hour or two has obtained the back-door open ! Mr. Roebuck, since I have discovered some of your secrets, I'll make bold to open some more of 'em. \u2014 But how shall I shake him off ? \u2014 Oh, I have it; I'll seek him instantly. [Exit. Love. I'll follow you at a distance, lest you have any foul play. Roe. Which if you do \u2014 No, faith, Ned, since I'm to answer an appointment for you, you must make good an assignation for me. I'm to meet one of your ladies at the fountain in the Temple to night. You may be called to the bar there, if you will. This watch will tell you the hour, and shall be your passport. Let me have yours. [Changes watches. Love. Oh, was that the jest ? Ha! ha! ha! \u2014 Well, I will answer an assignation for you sure enough. Ha! ha! ha! \u2014 [Aside.] How readily does the fool run to have his throat cut ! Roe. [Aside.] How eagerly now does my moral friend run to the devil, haviDg hopes of profit in the wind ! I have shabbed him off purely. \u2014 [Aloud.] But prithee, Ned, where had you this fine jewel ? [ Viewing one tied to the watch . Re-enter Roebuck meeting the Porter. Roe. Here, you sir, have you a note for one Roebuck ? Por. I had, sir ; but I gave it him just now. Roe. You lie, sirrah ! I am the man. Por. I an't positive I gave it to the right per son ; but I'm very sure I did ; for he answered the description the page gave to a T, sir. Roe.

'Gad, I'm afraid one or both of us may fall. But d'ye hear, Ned, remember you sent me on this errand, and are therefore answerable for all mischief; if I do whip my adversary through the lungs, or so, remember you set me upon't. Love. Well, honest George, you won't believe how much you oblige me in this courtesy. Roe. You know always I oblige myself by serv ing my friend. \u2014 [Aside.] I never thought this spark was a coward before. Love. [Aside.] I never imagined this fellow was so easy before.\u2014 [Aloud.] Well, good suc cess to us both ; and when we meet, we'll relate all transactions that pass. Re-enter Lovewell. Love. How now 1 why so merry ! Roe. Merry ! why, 'twould make a dog split, man ; ha ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 The watch, sir, the watch ; ha! ha! ha! Roe. That you're a fool. Love. That you're an ass. [Exeunt severally, laughing. Love. What of the watch ? You laugh by the hour ; you'll be run down by and by, sure ! Roe. Ay, but I shall be wound up again. This watch I had for a fee, lawyer Should I ever be tried before this judge, how I should laugh to see how gravely his goose cap sits upon a pair of horns ; ha I ha ! ha !

Behold Love well, injured Lovewell ! \u2014 This darkness, which opportunely hides your blushes, makes your shame more monstrous. Mock. But who are your guardians ? Lyr. The critics, who with their good will would never let us come to age. \u2014 But what have you got there ? Lean. Ha ! Lovewell ! I'm vexed 'tis he, but glad to be mistaken. Now, female policy, assist me. [Aside. Mock. By the universe, I don't know ; 'tis a woman's hand ; some billet-doux, I suppose ; it justled out of Lovewell's pocket.

'Tis the narrow gate to the lover's paradise ; Cupid stood sentry at the entrance ; love was the word, and he let me pass. \u2014 Now is my friend pleading for life ; he has a puzzling case to manage, ten to one he's nonsuited ; I have gulled him fairly. Enter Lovewell. Love. What, the page ! Lean. No counterplotting, good sir ; the mine's sprung already. \u2014 Ah, sir, I fancy Mr. Roebuck is better at discovering a man from a woman in the dark than you. Love. This discovery is the greatest riddle ! \u2014 Prithee, child, what makes thee disguised ? But above all, what meant that letter to Roebuck ? Lean. Then I find you intercepted it. \u2014 Why, sir, my lady had a mind to put a trick upon the impudent fellow, made him an assignation, and sent me in her stead, to banter him. But when I tell her how you fell into the snare, and how jealous you were \u2014 Ha ! ha ! ha ! Love. I've got in, thanks to my stars, or rather the clouds, whose influence is my best friend at present. Now is Roebuck gazing, or rather grop ing about for a fellow with a long sword ; and I know his fighting humour will be as mad to be balked by an enemy as by a mistress. Roe. Hark, hark ! I hear a voice ; it must be she. \u2014 Lucinda ! Love. True to the touch, I find.\u2014 Is it you, my dear ? Roe. Yes, my dear. Love. Let me embrace thee, my heart. Roe. Come to my arms.

Not even his falsehood shall my claim remove ; From mutual fires none can true passion prove ; For like to like, is gratitude not love. Lean. Mr. Roebuck ! sir, Mr. Roebuck ! Love.

Roe. No, madam ; a hair of the 6ame \u2014 is my receipt. \u2014 Come, come, madam, all things are laid to rest that will disturb our pleasure ; whole nature favours us ; the kind indulgent stars that directed me hither, wink at what we are about. \u2014 'Twere jilting of fortune to be now idle ; and she, like a true woman, once balked, never affords a second opportunity.\u2014 I'll put out the candle, the torch of love shall light us to bed.

Whence pro ceeds it ? from a vain thought of thy own graces, or an opinion of my virtue ? \u2014 If from the latter, know that I am a woman, whose modesty dare not doubt my virtue ; yet have so much pride to sup port it, that the dying groans of thy whole sex, at my feet, should not extort an immodest thought from me. Enter Roebuck, groping his way. Roe. On what new happy climate am I thrown ? This house is love's labyrinth ; I have stumbled into it by chance. \u2014 Ha ! an illusion ! let me look again. \u2014 Eyes, if you play me false, [Looking about] I'll pluck ye out. \u2014 'Tis she ; 'tis Lucinda! alone, undressed, in a bedchamber, between eleven and twelve a clock.

Your thoughts may be as modest as you please, madam. \u2014 You shall be as virtuous to morrow morning as e'er a nun in Europe ; the opinion of the world shall proclaim you as such, and that's the surest charter the most rigid virtue in England is held by. The night has no eyes to see, nor have I a tongue to tell : one kiss shall seal up my lips for ever. Luc. That uncharitable censure of women argues the meanness of thy conversation. Roe.

Madam, I'm a gentleman ; I know how to oblige a lady, and how to save her reputation. My love and honour go linked together ; they are my principals : and if you'll be my second, we'll engage immediately. Luc. Stand off, sir ! the name of love and honour are burlesqued by thy professing 'em. Thy love is impudence, and thy honour a cheat. Thy mien and habit show thee a gentleman ; but thy beha viour is brutal. Thou art a centaur ; only one part man, and the other beast. Luc. A trifle, said he! \u2014 [Aside.] Oh indigna tion ! slighted thus ! \u2014 I'll put a jewel out of his power, that he would pawn his soul to retrieve. \u2014 [Aloud.] If you be a gentleman, sir, whom grati tude can work up to love, or a virtuous wife reclaim, I'll make you a large return for that trifle.

No, I'm resolved ; and I'll prevent his discovering us ; I'll put on a suit of your clothes, and order Pindress to carry her night-gown to the gentleman in the garden, and bid him meet me in the lower arbour, in the west corner, and send the chaplain thither instantly.

Oh, but there are children, squalling children. Ay, but then there are rickets and small-pox, which perhaps may carry them all away. Oh, but there's horns ! Horns ! Ay, but then I shall go to heaven ; for 'tis but reasonable, since all mar riages are made in heaven, that all cuckolds should go thither. But then there's Leanthe? \u2014 that sticks.

Ay, sir; and a pillory that you would give your ears for; I warrant you think my master's over head and ears in the Irish quagmire you would have drowned him in. But, sir, we have found the bottom on't. Love. He may pass over the quagmire, sirrah ; for there were stepping-stones laid in his way. Club. He has got over dry-shod, I'll assure you.

You threw Mr. Lyric his poem, in a hurry, in the Park, and justled that sweet letter out of your pocket, sir. This letter fell into my master's hands, sir, and discovered your sham, sir, your trick, sir. Now, sir, I think you're as deep in the mud as he When her soft melting, white, and yielding waist, Within my pressing arms was folded fast, Our lips were melted down by heat of love, And lay incorporate in liquid kisses, Whilst in soft broken sighs we catch'd each other's souls.

The fear she lay under of being dis covered by you, gave me an opportunity of im posing Pindress upon her instead of this gentleman, whom she expected to wear one of Pindress's nightgowns as a disguise. To make the cheat more current, she disguised herself in my clothes, which has made her pass on her maid for me ; and I by that opportunity putting on a suit of her's, passed upon this gentleman for Lucinda, my next business is to find her out, and beg her pardon, endeavour her reconcilement to you, which the discovery of the mistakes between both will easily effect. [Exit. Roe. [To Lyric] Well, sir, how was your plot carried on ? Lyr. Why this squire, (will you give me leave to call you so now ?) this squire had a mind to per sonate Lovewell, to catch Lucinda.

Sib, \u2014 'Tis no small reflection on pieces of this nature, that panegyric is so much improved, and that dedication is grown more an art than poetry ; that authors, to make their patrons more than men, make themselves less ; and that persons of honour are forced to decline patronising wit, because their modesty cannot bear the gross strokes of adulation. But give me leave to say, Sir, that I am too young an author to have learned the art of flattery ; and, I hope, the same modesty which recommended this play to the world, will also reconcile my addresses to you, of whom I can say nothing but what your merits may warrant, and all that have the honour of your acquaintance will be proud to vindicate. The greatest panegyric upon you. Sir, is the unprejudiced and bare truth of your character, the fire of youth, with* the eedateness of a senator, and the modern gaiety of a fine English gentleman, with the noble solidity of the ancient Briton. This is the character, Sir, which all men, but yourself, are proud to publish of you, and which more celebrated pens than mine should transmit to posterity. The play has had some noble appearances to honour its representation ; and to complete the success, I have presumed to prefix so noble a name to usher it into the world. A stately frontispiece is the beauty of a building. But here I must transverse Ovid i\u2014materia svperabit opus. I am, honourable Sir, your most devoted and humble servant, G. FARQUHAR. PREFACE TO THE READER. An affected modesty is very often the greatest vanity, and authors are sometimes prouder of their blushes than of the praises that occasioned them. I shan't therefore, like a foolish virgin, fly to be pursued, and deny what I chiefly wish for. I am very willing to acknowledge the beauties of this play, especially those of the third night, which not to be proudof were the height of impudence. Who is ashamed to value himself upon such favours, undervalues those who conferred them. . . As I freely submit to the criticisms of the judicious, so I cannot call this an ill play, since the town has allowed it such success. When they have pardoned my faults 'twere very ill manners to condemn their indulgence. Some may think (my acquaintance in town being too slender to make a party for the play) that the success must be derived from the pure merits of the cause I am of another opinion : I have not been long enough in town to raise enemies against me : and the English are still kind to strangers. I am below the envy of great wits, and above the malice of little ones. I have not displeased the ladies, nor offended the clergy ; both which are now pleased to say, that a comedy may be diverting without smut and profaneness. .,,,,, _.,.._, . -, , Next to those advantages, the beauties of action gave the greatest life to the play, of which the town is so sensible that all will join with me in commendation of the actors, and allow (without detracting from the merit of others) that the Theatre Royal affords an excellent and complete set of comedians. Mt. W.Iks s performance has set him 60 far above competition in the part of Wildair, that none can pretend to envy the praise due to his merit.

Poets will think nothing so checks their fury As wits, cits, beaux, and women, for their jury. Our spark's half dead to think what medley's come, With blended judgments to pronounce his doom. 'Tis all false fear ; for in a mingled pit, Why, what your grave don thinks but dully writ, His neighbour i'th' great wig may take for wit. Some authors court the few, the wise, if any ; Our youth's content, if he can reach the many, Who go with much like ends to church, and play, Not to observe what priests or poets say ; No, no, your thoughts, like theirs, lie quite another At night, with empty bowels, grumbles o'er the play. And now the modish prentice he implores, Who, with his master's cash, stolen out of doors, Employs it on a brace of \u2014 honourable whores ; While their good bulky mother pleased, sits by, Bawd regent of the bubble gallery. Next to our mounted friends, we humbly move, Who all your side-box tricks are much above, And never fail to pay us \u2014 with your love. Ah, friends I Poor Dorset garden-house is gone ; Our merry meetings there are all undone : Quite lost to us, sure for some strange misdeeds, That strong dog Samson's pull'd it o'er our heads, Snaps rope like thread ; but when his fortune's told him, He'll hear perhaps of rope will one day hold him : At least, I hope, that our good-natured town Will find a way to pull his prizes down. Well, that's all I Now, gentlemen, for the play, On second thoughts, I've but two words to say ; Such as it is for your delight design'd, Hear it, read, try, judge, and speak as you find. way. The ladies safe may smile : for here's no slander, No smut, no lewd-tongued beau, no double-entendre. 'Tis true, he has a spark just come from France, But then so far from beau \u2014 why, he talks sense ! Like coin oft carried out, but \u2014 seldom brought from \u2022 thence. There's yet a gang to whom our spark submits, Your elbow-shaking fool, that lives by's wits, That's only witty though, just as he lives, by fits. Who, lion-like, through bailiffs scours away, Hunts, in the face, a dinner all the day, PROLOGUE. ANOTHER Our plays are farce, because our house is cramm'd ; Their plays all good ; for what ? \u2014 because they're damn'd. 'Tis hard, the author of this play in view, Should becondemn'd, purely for pleasing you : Charged with a crime, which you, his judges, own Was only this, that he has pleased the town. He touch'd no poet's verse, nor doctor's bills ; No foe to B re, yet a friend to Wills. No reputation stabb'd by sour debate ; Nor had a hand in bankrupt Brisco's fate : And, as an ease to's tender conscience, vows, He's none of those that broke the t'other house : In perfect pity to their wretched cheer, Because we pleasure you, you call us tools ; And 'cause you please yourselves they call you fools. By their good-nature, they are wits, true blue ; And men of breeding, by their respects to you. To engage the fair, all other means being lost, They fright the boxes with old Shakspeare's ghost ; The ladies of such spectres should take heed ; For 'twas the devil did raise that ghost indeed. Their case is hard that such despair can show ; They've disobliged all powers above, they know ; And now must have recourse to powers below. Let Shakspeare then lie still, ghosts do no good ; The fair are better pleased with flesh and blood. What is't to them, to mind the ancients' taste ? Because his play was bad \u2014 he brought it here. The dreadful sin of murder cries aloud j And sure these poets ne'er can hope for good, Who dipp'd their barbarous pens in that poor house's blood. 'Twas malice all : no malice like to theirs, To write good plays, purpose to starve the players. To starve by's wit, is still the poet's due, But here are men whose wit is match'd by few ; Their wit both starves themselves and others too. But the poor folks are mad, and I'm in haste.

The pride of these virtuous women is more insufferable than the immodesty of prostitutes ! \u2014 After all my encouragement, to slight me thus ! Foot. She said, sir, that imagining your morals sincere, she gave you access to her conversation ; but that your late behaviour in her company has convinced her, that your love and religion are both hypocrisy, and that she believes your letter like yourself, fair on the outside, foul within ; so sent it back unopened.

Then may desire prevail to make her curse that untimely pride her disappointed age repents ! \u2014 I'll be revenged the very first op portunity Saw you the old lady Darling, her mother ? Viz.

And did not we pay you for your lives, sir ? \u2014 Venture your lives ! I'm sure we ventured our money, and that's life and soul to me. \u2014 Sir, we'll maintain you no longer. Stand.

What is it, pray, sir ? Smug. A man at his devotion so near the court. \u2014 I'm very glad, boy, that you keep your sanctity untainted in this infectious place ; the very air of this park is heathenish, and every man's breath I meet scents of atheism. Viz. Oh ! but you have good friends, colonel ! Stand. Oh, very good friends ! my father's a lord, and my elder brother a beau. Viz. But your country may perhaps want your sword again. Stand. Nay, for that matter, let but a single drum beat up for volunteers between Ludgate and Charing Cross, and I shall undoubtedly hear it at the walls of Buda. Viz. Come, come, colonel, there are ways of making your fortune at home. \u2014 Make your ad dresses to the fair, you're a man of honour and courage. Viz. Surely, sir, some great concern must bring you to this unsanctified end of the town. Smug. A very unsanctified concern truly, cousin. Viz. What is't ? Smug. A lawsuit, boy. \u2014 shall I tell you ? \u2014 My ship the Swan is newly arrived from St. Sebastian, laden with Portugal wines : now the impudent rogue of a tidewaiter has the face to affirm, 'tis French wines in Spanish casks, and has indicted me upon the statute. \u2014 O conscience 1 conscience 1 these tidewaiters and surveyors plague us more with the French wines, than the war did with French privateers.

Prithee, no more on't. \u2014 You have awakened a thought, from which, and the king dom, I would have stolen away at once. \u2014 To be plain, I have a mistress. Viz. But pray, sir Harry, tell us some news of your travels. Sir Har. With all my heart. You must know then, I went over to Amsterdam in a Dutch ship ; I there had a Dutch whore for five stivers : I went from theDce to Landen, where I was heartily drubbed in the battle with the butt-end of a Swiss musket. I thence went to Paris, where I had half a-dozen intrigues, bought half-a-dozen new suits, fought a couple of duels, and here I am again in statu quo. Viz. But we heard that you designed to make the tour of Italy ; what brought you back so soon ? Sir Har. That which brought you into the world, and may perhaps carry you out of it; a woman. Viz. And she's cruel. Stand. No. Viz. Her parents prevent your happiness. Stand. Nor that. Viz. Then she has no fortune. Stand.

The same. Stand. What ! quit the pleasures of travel for a woman I Sir Har. Ay, colonel, for such a woman I I had rather see her ruelle than the palace of Louis le Grand. There's more glory in her smile than in the Jubilee at Rome ; and I would rather kiss her hand than the pope's toe. Stand. Why, he behaved himself very bravely. Viz. Why not ? dost think bravery and gaiety are inconsistent ? He's a gentleman of most happy circumstances, born to a plentiful estate ; has had a genteel and easy education, free from the rigid ness of teachers and pedantry of schools. His florid constitution being never ruffled by misfor tune, nor stinted in its pleasures, has rendered him entertaining to others, and easy to himself: \u2014 turn ing all passion into gaiety of humour, by which he chooses rather to rejoice his friends than be hated by any ; as you shall see.

Stand. 'Tis done ! Sir Har. I.'ll double the stakes. \u2014 But, gentle men, now I think on't, how shall we be resolved ? for I know not where my mistress may be found ; she left Paris about a month before me, and I had an account \u2014 Re-enter Sir Harry Wildair, Footman attending. Sir Har. Ha, Vizard ! Viz. Sir Harry ! Stand. How, sir ! left Paris about a month before you ! Sir Har. Who thought to find you out of the rubric so long ?

Come, gentlemen, the news ! the news o' th' town ! for I'm just arrived. Viz. Why, iu the city-end o' th' town we're playing the knave, to get estates. Stand.

Not so fast, sir Harry ; you must have my passport for your admittance, and you'll find my recommendation, in a line or two, will procure you very civil entertainment ; I suppose twenty or thirty pieces handsomely placed will gain the point ; I'll ensure her sound.

I love her, that's true ; \u2014 but, then, I love honest sir Harry Wildair better. The lady Lurewell is divinely charming \u2014 right \u2014 but, then, a thrust i'th' guts, or a Middlesex jury, is as ugly as the devil. Viz. Ay, sir Harry, 'twere a dangerous cast for a beau baronet to be tried by a parcel of greasy, grumbling, bartering boobies, who would hang you purely because you're a gentleman. Sir Har. Ay, but on t'other hand, I have money enough to bribe the rogues with : so, upon mature deliberation, I would fight for her. \u2014 But no more of her. Prithee, Vizard, can't you recom mend a friend to a pretty mistress by-the-by, till I can find my own ? You have store, I'm sure ; you cunning poaching dogs make surer game than we that hunt open and fair. Prithee now, good Vizard ! Enter Clincher Senior. Clinch. Sen. Here, sirrah, order my coach about to St. James's, I'll walk across the Park too. \u2014 Mr. Vizard, your most devoted. \u2014 Sir, [To Sir Harry Wildair.] I admire the mode of your shoulder knot ; methinks it hangs very emphatically, and carries an air of travel in it; your sword-knot too is most ornamentally modish, and bears a foreign mien. Gentlemen, my brother is just arrived in town, so that, being upon the wing to kiss his hands, I hope you'll pardon this abrupt departure of, gentlemen, your most devoted and most faith ful, humble servant. [Exit. Sir Har. Prithee, dost know him ? Viz. Know him ! why, 'tis Clincher, who was apprentice to my uncle Smuggler, the merchant in the city. Sir Har. What makes him so gay ? Viz. Why, he's in mourning for his father; the kind old man, in Hertfordshire t'other day, broke his neck a fox-hunting; the son, upon the news, has broke his indentures, whipped from behind the counter into the side-box, forswears merchandise, \u2014 where he must live by cheating, \u2014 and usurps gentility, where he may die by raking. He keeps his coach and liveries, brace of geldings, leash of mistresses, talks of nothing but wines, intrigues, plays, fashions, and going to the Jubilee. Sir Har. Ha! ha! ha! how many pound of pulvil must the fellow use in sweetening himself from the smell of hops and tobacco ?

Enter Colonel Standard. O Lord ! no sooner talk of killing, but the soldier is conjured up. You're upon hard duty, colonel, to serve your king, your country and a mistress too. Stand. The latter, I must confess, is the harder ; for in war, madam, we can be relieved in our duty : but in love who would take our post is our enemy ; emulation in glory is transporting, but rivals here intolerable. Stand. Thy estate ! no, I'll turn a knave and purchase one myself; I'll cringe to that proud man I undermine, and fawn on him that I would bite to death ; I'll tip my tongue with flattery, and smooth my face with smiles; I'll turn pimp, informer, office-broker, nay coward, to be great ; and sacrifice it all to thee, my generous fair.

Pardon me, dear Vizard ; our belief struggles hard, before it can be brought to yield to the disadvantage of what we love : 'tis so great an abuse to our judgment, that it makes the faults of our choice our own failing. \u2014 But what said sir Harry?

Sir Har. But, sir, what preparations have you made for yonr journey ? Clinch. Sen. A case of pocket-pistols for the bravoes, and a swimming-girdle. Sir Har. Why these, sir ? Clinch. Sen. O Lord ! sir, I'll tell you. Sup pose us in Rome now ; away goes me, I, to some ball \u2014 for I'll be a mighty beau !

There, up comes her bravo ; the Italian grows saucy, and I give him an English douse of the face. \u2014 I can box, sir, box tightly ; I was a prentice, sir. \u2014 But then, sir, he whips out his sti letto, and I whips out my bull-dog\u2014 slaps him through, trips down stairs, turns the corner of Russel-street again, and whips me into the ambas sador's train, and there I'm safe as a beau behind the scenes !

Sir Harry, I did not well understand the offence, and must therefore proportion it to the greatness of your apology ; if you would therefore have me think it light, take no great pains in an excuse.

Nay, madam, what do you mean ? If you go to that, I think now fifty guineas is a very fine offer for your strict modesty, as you call it. Angel. 'Tis more charitable, sir Harry, to charge the impertinence of a man of your figure, on his defect in understanding, than on his want of man ners. \u2014 I'm afraid you're mad, sir. Sir Har.

That daring reason which so oft pretends To question works of high omnipotence, Yet poorly truckles to our weakest passions, And yields implicit faith to foolish love, Paying blind zeal to faithless woman's eyes. I've heard her falsehood with such pressing proofs, That I no longer should distrust it. Yet still my love would baffle demonstration, And make impossibilities seem probable. [Looks up. Ha ! that fool too ! what, stoop so low as that animal! \u2014 'Tis true, women once fallen, like cowards in despair, will stick at nothing, there's no medium in their actions. They must be bright as angels, or black as fiends. But now for my revenge, I'll kick her cully before her face, call her a whore, curse the whole sex, and so leave her. Angel. I shall never hereafter trust common report, which represented you, sir, a man of honour, wit, and breeding ; for I find you very deficient in them all. [Exit. [Exit into the house. Sir Har. Now I find that the strictest pre tences which the ladies of pleasure make to strict modesty, is the reason why those of quality are ashamed to wear it. SCENE V.\u2014 A Room in the same.

I could have had two countesses in Paris for half the money, and je vous remercie into the bargain. Viz. Gone in her airs, say you ? and did not you follow her ? Lady Lure. Can't you think of anything, sir? Enter Tjm Errand. What do you want, sir ? Tim. Madam, I am looking for sir Harry Wil dair ; I saw him come in here this morning ; and did imagine he might be here still. Lady Lure.

I wonder, sir, how you have the confidence to approach me after so base a trick ! [ Weeping. Stand. [Aside.] Now, where are all my firm resolves ? I will believe her just. My passion raised my jealousy ; then why mayn't love be blind in finding faults as in excusing them ?\u2014 [Aloud.] I hope, madam, you'll pardon me, since jealousy, that magnified my suspicion, is as much the effect of love as my easiness in being satisfied. Lady Lure. Easiness in being satisfied ! You men have got an insolent way of extorting pardon by persisting in your faults. No, no, sir, cherish your suspicions, and feed upon your jealousy : 'tis fit meat for your squeamish stomach. With me all women should this rule pursue : Who thinks us false, should never find us true. Stand. O madam, all your artifices won't prevail. Lady Lure. Nay, sir, your artifices won't avail. I thought, sir, that I gave you caution enough against troubling me with sir Harry Wildair's company when I sent his letters back by you ; yet vou, forsooth, must tell him where I lodged, and expose me again to his impertinent courtship. Stand. I expose you to his courtship ! Lady Lure. I'll lay my life you'll deny it now. Come, come, sir ; a pitiful lie is as scandalous to a red coat as an oath to a black. Did not sir Harry himself tell me that he found out by you where I lodged ? Stand. You're all lies ! First, your heart is false, your eyes are double ; one look belies another : and then your tongue does contradict them all. Madam, I see a little devil just now hammering out a lie in your pericranium. Lady Lure. [Aside.] As I hope for mercy, he's in the right on't.\u2014 [Aloud.] Hold, sir, you have got the playhouse cant upon your tongue, and think that wit may privilege your railing : but I must tell you, sir, that what is satire upon the stage, is ill manners here. Stand. What is feigned upon the stage, is here in reality real falsehood. Yes, yes, madam ; I exposed you to the courtship of your fool Clincher too : I hope your female wiles will impose that upon me, also \u2014 . [Exit in a rage. Re-enter Clincher Senior. Clinch. Sen.

A fit match for your fifteen as could be, Lady Lure. He had a genteel sweetness in his face, a graceful comeliness in his person, and his tongue was fit to soothe soft innocence to ruin. His very looks were witty, and his expressive eyes spoke softer, prettier things, than words could frame. Lady Lure. Oh, my poor gentleman ! and was it beaten ? Clinch. Sen. Yes, I have been beaten : but where's my clothes ! my clothes ? Lady Lure. What ! you won't leave me so soon, my dear, will ye ? Clinch. Sen.

There will be mischief by-and-by ; I never heard a woman talk so much of eyes but there were tears presently after. Lady Lure. His discourse was directed to my father, but his looks to me. After supper, I went to my chamber, and read Cassandra ; then went to bed, and dreamt of him all night ; rose in the morning, and made verses : so fell desperately in love. My father was so well pleased with his con versation, that he begged their company next day ; they consented ; and next night, Parly \u2014 Par. Ay, next night, madam, \u2014 next night (I'm afraid) was a night indeed. Lady Lure. He bribed my maid, with his gold, out of her honesty ; and me, with his rhetoric, out of my honour. She admitted him to my chamber, and there he vowed, and swore, and wept, and sighed \u2014 and conquered. [Weeps. Par. Alack a-day, poor fifteen ! [Weeps- Lady Lure. He swore that he would come down from Oxford in a fortnight and marry me. Par.

Alas ! what wit had innocence like mine? He told me, that he was under an obliga tion to his companions of concealing himself then, but that he would write to me in two days, and let me know his name and quality. After all the binding oaths of constancy, joining hands, exchang ing hearts, I gave him a ring with this mot to, Love and honour, then we parted ; but I never saw the dear deceiver more. Par. No ! he went out of the back-door, and is run clear away, I'm afraid. Clinch. Sen. Gone! say you; and with my clothes ! my fine Jubilee clothes ! \u2014 Oh, the rogue ! the thief ! \u2014 I'll have him hanged for murder. But how shall I get home in this pickle ? Par. I'm afraid, sir, the colonel will be back presently ; for he dines at home. Clinch. Sen. Oh, then I must sneak off! \u2014 Was ever man so managed ! to have his coat well thrashed, and lose his coat too ? [Exit. Lady Lure. Thus the noble poet spoke truth : \u2014 Nothing suits worse with vice than want of sense : Fools are still wicked at thir own expense. Par. Methinks, madam, the injuries you have suffered by men must be very great, to raise such heavy resentments against the whole sex. Lady Lure. The greatest injury that woman couid sustain : they robbed me of that jewel which, preserved, exalts our sex almost to angels ; but destroyed, debases us below the worst of brutes \u2014 mankind. Pur. But I think, madam, your anger should be only confined to the author of your wrongs. Lady Lure. The author ! \u2014 Alas ! I know him not ; which makes my wrongs the greater. Par. Not know him ! 'tis odd, madam, that a man should rob you of that same jewel you men tioned, and you not know him ! Lady Lure. Leave trifling ! \u2014 'tis a subject that always sours my temper. But since, by thy faith ful service, I have some reason to confide in your secrecy, hear the strange relation. Some twelve years ago I lived at my father's house in Oxford shire, blest with innocence, the ornamental but weak guard of blooming beauty. I was then just fif teen, an age oft fatal to the female sex :\u2014 our youth is tempting, our innocence credulous, romances moving, love powerful, and men are \u2014 villains ! Then it happened, that three young gentlemen, from the university, coming into the country, and being benighted, and strangers, called at my father's : he was very glad of their company, and offered them the entertainment of his house. Par. No, nor never will I warrant you. Lady Lure. I need not tell my griefs, which my father's death made a fair pretence for ; he left roe sole heiress and executrix to three thousand pounds a year. At last, my love for this single dissembler turned to a hatred of the whole sex ; and, resolv ing to divert my melancholy, and make my large fortune subservient to my pleasure and revenge, I went to travel, where, in most courts of Europe, I have done some execution. Here I will play my last scene ; then retire to my country-house, live solitary, and die a penitent. Par. But don't you still love this dear dissem bler ? Lady Lure. Most certainly : 'tis love of him that keeps my anger warm, representing the base ness of mankind full in view ; and makes my resentments work. We shall have that old impo tent lecher Smuggler here to-night ; I have a plot to swinge him, and his precise nephew Vizard. Par. I think, madam, you manage everybody Par. Which they accepted, no doubt.\u2014 Oh ! these strolling collegians are never abroad but upon some mischief ! Lady Lure. They had some private frolic or design in their heads, as appeared by their not naming one another ; which my father perceiving, out of civility, made no inquiry into their affairs. Two of them had a heavy, pedantic, university air, a sort of disagreeable scholastic boorishness in their behaviour ; but the third ! \u2014 that comes in your way. Lady Lure. No, Parly, those men whose pre tensions I found just and honourable, I fairly dis missed, by letting them know my firm resolutions never to marry. But those villains that would attempt my honour, I've seldom failed to manage. Par. Ay, the third, madam !\u2014 the third of all things, they say, is very critical."], [623, "SCENE I. A TRIP TO THE JUBILEE. 529 Par. What d'ye think of the colonel, madam ? I suppose his designs are honourable. Lady Lure. That man's a riddle; there's some thing of honour in his temper that pleases : I'm sure he loves me too, because he's soon jealous, and soon satisfied. But he's a man still. When I once tried his pulse about marriage, his blood ran as low as a coward's. He swore, indeed, that he loved me, but could not marry me forsooth, because he was engaged elsewhere. So poor a pretence made me disdain his passion, which otberwise might have been uneasy to me. But hang him, I have teased Mm enough.

Put up your sword first ; you know I dare fight : but I had much rather make you a friend than an enemy. I can assure you, this lady will prove too hard for one of your temper. You have too much honour, too much in conscience, to be a favourite with the ladies. Sir Har. Draw sir! what shall T draw ? Stand. Come, come, sir, I like your facetious humour well enough ; it shows courage and uncon cern. I know you brave ; and therefore use you thus. Draw your sword. Sir Har. Nay, to oblige you, I will draw ; but the devil take me if I fight ! \u2014 Perhaps, colonel, this is the prettiest blade you have seen. Stand. I doubt not but the arm is good ; and therefore think both worth my resentment. Come, sir. Sta?id. I'm assured, sir, she never gave you any encouragement. Sir Har. A man can never hear reason with a sword in his hand. Sheathe your weapon ; and then if I don't satisfy you, sheathe it in my body. Stand. Give me but demonstration of her grant ing you any favour, and 'tis enough. Sir Har. Will you take my word ? Stand. Pardon me, sir, I cannot. Sir Har. But, prithee colonel, dost think that I am such a madman as to send my soul to the devil and my body to the worms upon every fool's errand ? Sir Har. Will you believe your own eyes ? Stand. 'Tis ten to one whether I shall or no ; they have deceived me already. Sir Har. That's hard But some means I shall Stand. I hope you're no coward, sir. Sir Har. Coward, sir ! I have eight thousand pounds a year, sir. Stand. You fought in Flanders to my know- ledge. Sir Har. Ay, for the same reason that I wore a red coat, because 'twas fashionable. Stand. Sir, you fought a French count in Paris. Sir Har. True, sir ; he was a beau like my- self. Now you're a soldier, colonel, and fighting's your trade ; and I think it downright madness to contend with any man in his profession. Stand. Come, sir, no more dallying : I shall take very unseemly methods if you don't show yourself a gentleman. Sir Har. A gentleman ! why there again now ? A gentleman ! I tell you once more, colonel, that I am a baronet, and have eight thousand pounds a year. I can dance, sing, ride, fence, understand the languages. Now, I can't conceive how run- ning you through the body should contribute one jot more to my gentility. But, pray, colonel, I had forgot to ask you : what's the quarrel? Stand. A woman, sir. Sir Har. Then I put up my sword. \u2014 Take her. Stand. Sir, my honour's concerned. Sir Har. Nay, if your honour be concerned with a woman, get it out of her hands as soon as you can. An honourable lover is the greatest slave in nature ; some will say, the greatest fool. Come, devise for your satisfaction. We must fly this place, else that cluster of mob will overwhelm us.

What shall we do with him, neigh bours ? 2 Mob. We'll pull him in pieces. 1 Mob. No, no ; then we may be hanged for murder : but we'll drown him. Clinch. Sen. Ha, good people, pray don't drown me ; for I never learned to swim in all my life. \u2014 Ah, this plaguy intriguing ! Mob. Away with him ! away with him to the Thames ! Clinch. Sen.

I rely on your word and honour, sir Harry ; which if I doubted, my distrust would cancel the obligation of their security. Sir Har. Then meet me half an bour hence at the Rummer. You must oblige me by taking a hearty glass with me toward the fitting me out for a certain project which this night I undertake. Stand. I guess by the preparation that woman's the design. Sir Har. Yes, faith. \u2014 I am taken dangerously ill with two foolish maladies, modesty and love; the first I'll cure with burgundy, and my love by a night's lodging with the damsel. A sure remedy. Probatum est ! Enter Constable. Const. Hold, neighbours! I command the peace- Wife. Oh, Mr. Constable, here's a rogue that has murdered my husband, and robbed him of his clothes. Const. Murder and robbery ! then he must be a gentleman. \u2014 Hands off there ! he must not be abused Give an account of yourself: are you a gentleman ? Clinch. Sen. No, sir, I am a beau. Const. Then you have killed nobody, I'm per suaded. How came you by these clothes, sir ? Clinch. Sen. You must know, sir, that walking along, sir, I don't know how, sir; I can't tell where, sir ; and \u2014 so the porter and I changed clothes, sir. Stand. I'll certainly meet you, sir. [Exeunt severally. Const. Very well, the man speaks reason and like a gentleman. Wife. But pray, Mr. Constable, ask him how he changed clothes with him. Const. Silence, woman ! and don't disturb the court. \u2014 Well, sir, bow did you change clothes ? Clinch. Sen. Why, sir, he pulled off my coat, and I drew off his ; so 1 puts on bis coat, and he puts on mine. Const. Why, neighbours, I don't find that he's guilty : search him ; and if he carries no arms about him, we'll let him go. SCENE 11.\u2014 The same. Enter Clincher Junior and Dicky. Clinch. Jun.

O gemini ! my Jubilee pistols ! Const. What, a case of pistols ! then the case is plain. \u2014 Speak, what are you, sir ? whence came you, and whither go you ? Clinch. Sen. Sir, I came from Russel-street, and am going to the Jubilee. Wife. You shall go to the gallows, you rogue ! Const. Away with him ! away with him to New bate, straight ! Clinch. Sen.

Speak, you rogue, what are you ? Tim. A poor porter, sir, and going of an errand. Dicky. What errand ? speak, you rogue. Tim. A fool's errand, I'm afraid. Clinch. Jun. Who sent you ? Tim. A beau, sir. Stand. With the generality of women, I grant you, these arts may prevail. Sir Har. Generality of women ! why there again you're out. They're all alike, sir ; I never heard of any one that was particular, but one. Stand. Who was she, pray ? Sir Har. Penelope, I think, she's called ; and that's a poetical story too. When will you find a poet in our age make a woman so chaste ? Stand. Well, sir Harry, your facetious humour can disguise falsehood, and make calumny pass for satire. But you have promised me ocular demon stration that she favours you : make that good, and I shall then maintain faith and female to be as in consistent as trulh and falsehood. Dicky. No, no, the rogue has murdered your brother, and stripped him of his clothes. Clinch. Jun. Murdered my brother ! O crimini ! O my poor Jubilee brother ! \u2014 Stay, by Jupiter Ammon, I'm heir though ! \u2014 Speak, sirrah, have you killed him? Confess that you have killed him, and I'll give you half-a-crown. Tim. Who, I sir ? Alack-a-day, sir, I never killed any man but a carrier's horse once. Clinch. Jun. Then you shall certainly be hanged, but confess that you killed him, and we'll let you go. Tim. [Aside.] Telling the truth hangs a man, but confessing a lie can do no harm ; besides, if Sir Har. Nay, by what you have told me, I am satisfied that she imposes on us all ; and Vizard, too, seems what I still suspected him : but his"], [625, "A TRIP TO THE JUBILEE.

Here's your money, sir : \u2014 but are you sure you killed him dead ? Tim. Sir, I'll swear it before any judge in EDgland. Dicky. But are you sure that he's dead in law ? Tim. Dead in law !

You gentlemen have the cunningest ways of playing the fool, and are so industrious in your profuseness ! Speak seriously, am I beholden to chance or design for this ring ? Sir Har. To design, upon my honour, and I hope my design will succeed. [Aside. Lady Lure. [Singing.] And what shall I give you for such a fine thing ? Sir Har. [Singing.] You'll give me another, you 11 give me another fine thing. Lady Lure. Shall I be free with you, sir Harry ? Sir Har. With all my heart, madam, so I may be free with you. Lady Lure. Then, plainly, sir, I shall beg the favour to see you some other time, for at this very minute I have two lovers in the house. Sir Har. Then, to be as plain, I must be gone this minute, for I must see another mistress within these two hours. Enter Lady Lurewell and Parlv. Lady Lure. Are you sure that Vizard had my letter? Par.^Yes, yes, madam ; one of your ladyship's footmen gave it to him in the Park, and he told the bearer, with all transports of joy, that he would be punctual to a minute. Lady Lure. Thus most villains, sometime or other, are punctual to their ruin ; and hypo crisy, by imposing on the world, at last deceives itself. Are all things prepared for his reception ? Par. Exactly to your ladyship's order ; the alderman too is just come, dressed and cooked up for iniquity. Lady Lure. Then he has got woman's clothes on? Par. Yes, madam, and has passed upon the family for your nurse. Lady Lure.

Come, come, madam, you know very well . those who stand so high, that the vulgar envy even their crimes, whose figure adds privilege to their sin, and makes it pass unquestioned; fair, high, pampered females, whose speaking eyes and pierc ing voice would arm the statue of a stoic, and animate his cold marble with the soul of an epicure ; all ravishing, lovely, soft, and kind, like you ! Smug. [Aside.] I'm very lovely and soft indeed ! you shall find me much harder than you imagine, friend! \u2014 [Aloud.] Well, sir, but I suppose your dissimulation has some other motive besides plea sure ? Par. This way, Mr. Alderman. Smug. Well, Mrs. Parly, I'm obliged to you for this trouble ; here are a couple of shillings for you. Times are hard, very hard indeed, but next time I'll steal a pair of silk stockings from my wife, and bring them to you. \u2014 What are you fum bling about my pockets for ? Par.

'Tis the most knavish, precise, covetous old rogue that ever died of a gout. Smug. [Aside.] Ah ! the young son of a whore ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Well, sir, and what of him ? Viz. Hell hungers not more for wretched souls than he for ill-got pelf : and yet (what's wonder ful) he that would stick at no profitable villany himself, loves holiness in another. He prays all Sunday for the sins of the week past ; he spends all dinner-time in too tedious graces ; and what he designs a blessing to the meat, proves a curse to his family. He's the most \u2014 Smvg. Well, well, sir, I know him very well. Viz. Then, madam, he has a swinging estate, which I design to purchase as a saint, and spend like a gentleman.

It shall be a deed to convey you to the gallows, then, you young dog ! [Aside. Viz. And no sooner he's dead, but I'll rattle over his grave with a coach-and-six, to inform his covetous ghost how genteelly I spend his money. Smug.

Drunkenness, sir Harry, is the worst pretence a gentleman can make for rudeness : for the excuse is as scandalous as the fault. \u2014 Therefore, pray consider who you are so free with, sir ; a woman of condition, that can call half-a-dozen footmen upon occasion. Sir Har. Nay, madam, if you have a mind to toss me in a blanket, half-a-dozen chambermaids would do better service. \u2014 Come, come, madam, though the wine makes me lisp, yet has it taught me to speak plainer. By all the dust of my ancient progenitors, I must this night quarter my coat of arms with yours. Angel. Nay then\u2014 Who waits there , [Calls. Enter Footmen. Take hold of that madman, and bind him.

I conjure you, sir, by the sacred name of honour, by your dead father's name, and the fair reputation of your mother's chastity, that you offer not the least offence ! \u2014 Already you have wronged me past redress. Sir liar. Thou art the most unaccountable creature ! Angel. What madness, sir Harry, what wild dream of loose desire could prompt you to attempt this baseness ? View me well. The brightness of my mind, methinks, should lighten outwards, and let you see your mistake in my behaviour. I think it shines with so much innocence in my face, That it should dazzle all your vicious thoughts : Think not I am defenceless 'cause alone. Re-enter Lady Darling. Lady Dar. Well, sir Harry, and how d'ye like my daughter, pray ? Sir Har. Like her, madam ! \u2014 Heark'ee, will you take it ? \u2014 Why, faith, madam 1 \u2014 Take the money, I say, or egad, all's out. Angel. All shall out ; sir, you're a scandal to the name of gentleman. Sir liar. With all my heart, madam. \u2014 In short, madam, your daughter has used me somewhat too familiarly, though I have treated her like a woman of quality. Lady Dar. How, sir ! Sir Har. Why, madam, I have offered her a hundred guineas. Lady Dar. A hundred guineas ! upon what score ! Your very self is guard against yourself: I'm sure, there's something generous in your soul ; My words shall search it out, And eyes shall fire it for my own defence. Sir Har.

[Looks foolish , and hums a song. Angel. Now, sir, I hope you need no instigation to redress our wrongs, since even the injury points the way. Lady Dar.

Consider whatatender blossom is female reputation, which the least air of foul detraction blasts. Sir Har. Yes, madam. [Bows to Angelica. Angel. Hold, sir, stop your abusive tongue ! too loose for modest ears to bear. Madam, 1 did be fore suspect that his designs were base, now they're too plain ; this knight, this mighty mao of wit and humours, is made a tool to a knave : Vizard has sent him of a bully's errand, to affront a woman ; but I scorn the abuse, and him that offered it. Lady Dar. How, sir, come to affront us ! d'ye know who we are, sir ? Sir Har. Know who ye are ! why, your daughter there is, Mr. Vizard's cousin, I suppose : \u2014 and for you, madam,\u2014 [Aside.] now to call her procuress a la mode France [AloudJ J'estime votre occupation.

Now I suppose you do understand me. Lady Dar. This is beyond sufferance ! But say, thou abusive man, what injury have you ere re ceived from me or mine, thus to engage you in this scandalous aspersion? Angel. Yes, sir, what cause, what motives, could induce you thus to debase yourself below your rank? Sir Har. Heyday ! Now dear Roxana, and you my fair Statira, be not so very heroic in your styles ; Vizard's letter may resolve you, and answer all the impertinent questions you have made me. Lady Dar. Angel. We appeal to that. Sir Har. And I'll stand to't ; he read it to me, and the contents were pretty plain, I thought. Angel. Here, sir, peruse it, and see how much we are injured, and you deceived. Sir Har. [Opening the letter.] But hold, ma dam\u2014[To Lady Darling] before I read, I'll make some condition. Mr. Vizard says here, that I won't scruple thirty or forty pieces. Now, ma dam, if you have clapped in another cipher to the account, and made it three or four hundred, by Gad, I will not stand to't. Angel. Now, can't I tell whether disdain or an \"er be the most just resentment for this injury. [Atide. Lady Dar. Call then to mind your rude and scandalous behaviour. Sir Har. Right, madam.

Lady Dor. Only one, sir, which if you can think of, you may do ; you know the business I enter tained you for. Sir Har. I understand you. madam. \u2014 [Exit Lady Darling.] Here am I brought to a very pretty dilemma ; I must commit muider or com mit matrimony !

Stand. You're always pleasant, sir Harry ; but this transcends yourself! whence proceeds it ? Sir Har. Canst thou not guess, my friend ? Whence flows all earthly joy ? What is the life of man and soul of pleasure ? \u2014 woman ! What fires the heart with transport, and the soul with rap tures ? \u2014 lovely woman ! What is the masterstroke and smile of the creation, but charming, virtuous woman ? When nature, in the general composi tion, first brought woman forth, like a flushed poet ravished with his fancy, with ecstacy she blessed the fair production ! \u2014 Methinks, my friend, you relish not my joy ; what is the cau\u201ee ?

What are those, whose eyes, like basilisks, shine beautiful for sure destruction, whose smiles are dangerous as the grin of fiends, but false, deluding woman ? Woman ! whose composition inverts hu manity : their body's heavenly, but their souls are clay ! Sir Har. Come, come, colonel, this is too much. I know your wrongs received from Lurewell may excuse your resentments against her: but 'tis unpardonable to charge the failings of a single woman upon the whole sex. I have found one, whose virtues \u2014 Clinch. Sen. Ay, sir, and you must put off your gravity, and run to the devil in petticoats ? You design to swing in masquerade, master, d'ye ? Smug.

'Tis ten to one now, but some malicious poet has my character upon the stage within this month. 'Tis a hard matter now that an honest sober man can't sin in private for this plaguy stage. I gave an honest gentleman five guineas myself towards writing a book against it : and it has done no good, we see. Clinch. Sen. Well, well, master, take courage ; our comfort is, we have lived together, and shall die together : only with this difference, that I have lived like a fool, and shall die like a knave ; and you have lived like a knave, and shall die like a fool.

So have I, sir Harry ; I have found one, whose pride's above yielding to a prince. And if lying, dissembling, perjury, and falsehood, be no breaches in woman's honour, she's as innocent as infancy.

I don't care a farthing for that ; I'm sure you're dead in law. Clinch. Sen. Why so, sirrah ? why so ? Clinch. Jun. Because, sir, I can get a fellow to swear he knocked out your brains. Sir Har. An odd way of swearing a man out of Lady Lure. Was it maliciously designed to let me find my misery when past redress ? to let me know you, only to know you false ? Had not cursed chance showed me the surprising motto, I had been happy. The first knowledge I had of you was fatal to me, and this second worse. Sir Har. What the devil's all this!

The travel of such fools as you doubly injures our country ; you expose our native follies, which ridi cules us among strangers ; and return fraught only with their vices, which you vend here for fashion able gallantry. A travelling fool is as dangerous as a homebred villain. Get you to your native plough and cart ; converse with animals like your selves \u2014 sheep and oxen ; men are creatures you don't understand. Stand. Stay, madam, you need not shun my sight ; for if you are perfect woman, you have con fidence to outface a crime, and bear the charge of guilt without a blush. Lady Lure. The charge of guilt ! \u2014 What, mak ing a fool of you ? I've done't, and glory in the act ! the height of female justice were to make you all hang or drown, dissembling to the prejudice of men is virtue ; and every look, or sign, or smile, or tear, that can deceive is meritorious.

Oh, name it not! \u2014 Yes, speak it out, 'tis so just a punishment for putting faith in man, that I will bear it all ; and let credulous maids, that trust their honour to the tongues of men, thus hear their shame proclaimed. \u2014 Speak now what his busy scandal, and your improving malice, both dare utter.

Sir Har. I wanted only this to make my plea sure perfect. Enter Alderman Smuggler. I did believe in spite of common fame : nay, against my own eyes I still maintained your truth. I ima gined Wildair's boasting of your favours to be the pure result of his own vanity. At last he urged your taking presents of him ; as a convincing proof of which you yesterday from him received that ring : \u2014which ring, that I might be sure he gave it, I lent him for that purpose. Lady Lure. Ha ! you lent him for that purpose ! Stand. Yes, yes, madam, I lent him for that purpose \u2014 no denying it. \u2014 I know it well, for I have worn it long, and desire you now, madam, to restore it to the just owner. Lady Lure. The just owner ! think, sir, think but of what importance 'tis to own it. If you have loye and honour in your soul, 'tis then most justly yours ; if not, you are a robber, and have stolen it basely. Stand. Hal your words, like meeting flints, have struck a light to show me something strange. \u2014 But tell me instantly, is not your real name Manly ? Lady Lure. Answer me first, did not you receive this ring about twelve years ago ? Stand. I did. Smug. So, gentlemen and ladies, is my gracious nephew Vizard among ye ? Sir Har.

And pray, sir Harry, when you see him next, tell him this news from me, that I have disinherited him, that I will leave him as poor as a disbanded quarter-master. And this is the positive and stiff resolution of three score and ten ; an age that sticks as obstinately to its purpose, as the old fashion of its cloak. Sir Har. [To Angelica.] You see, madam, how industriously Fortune has punished his offence to you. Angel. I can scarcely, sir, reckon it an offence, considering the happy consequence of it. Smug- O sir Harry, he is as hypocritical \u2014 Lady Lure. As yourself, Mr. Alderman: how fares my good old nurse, pray sir ? Smug. O madam, I shall be even with you before I part with your writings and money, that I have in my hands ! Stand. A word with you, Mr. Alderman ; do you know this pocket-book ? Smug. [Aside.] O Lord, it contains an account of all my secret practices in trading! \u2014 [Aloud.] How came you by it, sir ? Stand. Sir Harry here dusted it out of your pocket, at this lady's house yesterday. It contains an account of some secret practices in your mer chandising ; among the rest the counterpart of an agreement with a correspondent at Bordeaux, about transporting French wine in Spanish casks. \u2014 First return this lady all her writings, then I shall consider whether I shall lay your proceedings before the parliament or not ; whose justice will never suffer your smuggling to go unpunished. Smug. Oh, my poor ship and cargo ! Clinch. Sen. Hark'ee, master, you had as good come along with me to the Jubilee now. Angel. Come, Mr. Alderman, for once let a woman advise. Would you be thought an honest man, banish covetousness, that worst gout of age j avarice is a poor pilfering quality of the soul, aud will as certainly cheat, as a thief would steal. \u2014 Would you be thought a reformer of the times, be less severe in your censures, less rigid in your pre cepts, and more strict in your example. Sir Har. Right, madam ; virtue flows freer from imitation than compulsion ; of which, colonel, your conversion and mine are just examples. In vain are musty morals taught in schools, By rigid teachers, and as rigid rules, Where virtue with a frowning aspect stands, And frights the pupil from its rough commands. But woman, \u2014 Charming woman, can true converts make ; We love the precepts for the teacher's sake. Virtue in them appears so bright, so gay, We hear with transport, and with pride obey. , [Exeunt omnes. Lady Lure.

How has blind Fortune stumbled on the right ! \u2014 But where have you wandered since ? \u2014 'Twas cruel to forsake me. Stand. The particulars of my fortune were too tedious now ; but to discharge myself from the stain of dishonour, I must tell you, that imme diately upon my return to the university, my elder brother and I quarrelled. My father, to prevent farther mischief, posts me away to travel : I writ to you from London, but fear the letter came not to your hands. Lady Lure. I never had the least account of you, by letter or otherwise. Stand. Three years I lived abroad, and at my return, found you were gone out of the kingdom ; though none could tell me whither. Missing you thus, I went to Flanders, served my king till the peace commenced ; then fortunately going on board at Amsterdam, one ship transported us both to England. At the first sight I loved, though igno rant of the hidden cause. \u2014 You may remember, madam, that talking once of marriage, I told you I was engaged ; to your dear self I meant. Lady Lure. Then men are still most generous and brave \u2014 and to reward your truth, an estate of three thousand pounds a year waits your accept ance ; and if I can satisfy you in my past conduct, and the reasons that engaged me to deceive all men, I shall expect the honourable performance of your promise, and that you would stay with me in England. Stand. Stay! \u2014 not fame nor glory e'er shall part us more. My honour can be nowhere more con cerned than here. Re-enter SirllARny Wildair, Angelica, Clincher Senior, and Clincher Junior.

Now all depart, each his respective way, To spend an evening's chat upon the play ; Some to Hippolito's ; one homeward goes, And one with loving she retires to the Rose. The amorous pair in all things frank and free, Perhaps may save the play \u2014 in number Three. The tearing spark, if Phillis aught gainsays, Breaks the drawer's head, kicks her, and murders From box to stage, from stage to box they run, First steal the p'.ay, then damn it when they've done. But now, to know what fate may us betide, Among our friends, in Cornhill and Cheapside : But those, I think, have but one rule for plays ; They'll say they're good, if so the world says. If it should please them and their spouses know it, They straight inquire what kind of man's the Bays. To coffee some retreat to save their pockets, Others, more generous, damn the play at Locket's; But there, I hope, the author's fears are vain, Malice ne'er spoke in generous champagne. That poet merits an ignoble death, Who fears to fall over a brave Monteth. poet. But from side-box we dread a fearful doom, All the good-natured beaux are gone to Rome. The ladies' censure I'd almost forgot, Then for a line or two to engage their vote : But that way's old, below our author's aim, No less than his whole play is compliment to them. For their sakes then the play can't miss succeeding, Though critics may want wit, they have good breeding. They won't, I'm sure, forfeit the ladies' graces, By showing their ill-nature to their faces, Our business with good manners may be done, Flatter us here, and damn us when you're gone. The privilege of wine we only ask, You'll taste again before you damn the flask. Our author fears not you ; but those he may, Who in cold blood murder a man in tea. Those men of spleen, who fond the world should know it, Sit down, and for their twopence damn a poet.

TU THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF ALBEMARLE, &c. KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER. Mv Lotid, \u2014 My pen is- both a novice in poetry, and a stranger at court, and can no more raise itself to the style of panegyric, than it can stoop to the art of flattery ; but if in the plain and simple habit of truth, it may presume to mix with that crowd of followers that daily attend upon your Lordship's favour, please to behold a stranger, with this difference, that he pays more homage to your worth, than adoration to your greatness. This distinction, my Lord, will appear too nice and metaphysical to the world, who know your Lordship's merit and place to be so inseparable, that they can only differ as the cause from the effect ; and this, my Lord, is as much beyond dispute, as that youi royal master, who has made the noble choice, is the most wise and most discerning prince in the universe. To present the world with a lively draught of your Lordship's perfections, I should enumerate the judgment, conduct, piety and courage of our great and gracious king, who can only place his favours on those shining qualifications for which his majesty is so eminently remarkable himself; but this, my Lord, will prove the business of voluminous history, and your Lordship's character must attend the fame of your great master in the memoirs of futurity, as your faithful service has hitherto accompanied the noble actions of his life. The greatest princes in all ages have had their friends and favourites, with them to communicate and debate their thoughts, so to exercise and ripen their judgments ; or sometimes to ease their cares by imparting them. The great Augustus, we read in his project of settling the unwieldy Roman conquests on a fixed basis of government, had the design laid, not in his council, but his closet; there we find him with his two friends M\u00e6cenas and Agrippa, his favourite friends, persons of sound judgment and unquestionable fidelity, there the great question is freely and reason ably debated, without the noise of faction and constraint of formality ; and there was laid that prodigious scheme of government, that soon recovered their bleeding country, healed the wounds of the civil war, blessed the empire with a lasting peace, and styled its monarch, Pater Patrice. The parallel, my Lord, is easily made ; we have our C\u00e6sar too, no less renowned than the forementioned Augustus; he first asserted our liberties at home against popery and thraldom, headed our armies abroad with bravery and success, gave peace to Europe, and security to our religion. And you, my Lord, are his M\u00e6cenas, the private counsellor to those great transactions which have made England so formidable to its enemies, that (which I blush to own) it is grown jealous of its friends. Rut here, my Lord, appears the particular wisdom and circumspection of your Lordship's conduct, that you so firmly retain the favour of your master without the envy of the subject ; your moderation and even deportment between both, has secured to your Lordship the ear of the king, and the heart of the people; the nation has voted you their good Angel in all suits and petitions to their prince, and their success fills the three kingdoms with daily praises of your Lordship's goodness, and his majesty's grace and clemency. And now, my Lord, give me leave humbly to beg, that among all the good actions of your Lordship's high and happy fetation, the encouragement of arts and literature may not be solely excluded from the influence of your favour. The polite M\u00e6cenas, whom I presumed to make a parallel to your Lordship in the favour of his prince, had his Virgil and hia Horace, and his time was mostly divided between the emperor and the poet ; he eo managed his stake of royal favour, that as Augustus made him great, so the Muses fixed him immortal ; and Maro's excellency, my Lord, will appear the less wonder, when we consider that his pen was so cherished with bounty, and inspired by gratitude. But I can lay no claim to the merits of so great a person for my access to your Lordship ; I have only this to recom mend me without art void of rhetoric, that I am a true lover of my king, and pay an unfeigned veneration to all those who are his trusty servants and faithful ministers \u2022 which infers that I am, my Lord, with all submission, your Lord ship's mont devoted and most obedient humble servant, G.

PROLOGUE Our authors have, in most their late essays, Prologued their own, by damning other plays ; Made great harangues to teach you what was fit To pass for humour and go down for wit. Athenian rules must form an English piece, And Drury-lane comply with ancient Greece. Exactness only, such as Terence writ, Must please our mask'd Lucretias in the pit. Our youthful author swears he cares not a pin ForVossius, Scaliger, Hedelin, or Rapin : He leaves to learned pens such laboured lays, You are the rules by which he writes his plays. From musty books let others take their view, He hates dull reading, but he studies you. First, from you beaux, his lesson is formality, And in your footmen there \u2014 most nice morality ; To pleasure them his Pegasus must fly, Because they judge, and lodge, three stories high From the front boxes be has pick'd his style, And learns, without a blush, to make 'em smile : A lesson only taught us by the fair, \u2014 A waggish action, but a modest air. Among his friends here in the pit he reads Some rules that every modish writer needs. He learns from every Covent-garden critic's face, The modern forms of action, time, and place. The action he's ashamed to name, d'ye see ; The time is seveD, the place is number Three. The masks he only reads by passant looks, He dares not venture far into their books. Tims, then, the pit and boxes are his schools, Your air, your humour, his dramatic rules. Let critics censure then, and hiss like snakes, He gains his ends, if his light fancy takes St. James's beaux, and Covent-garden rakes. ACT I. SCENE I.\u2014 The Park. tell you the character I have heard of a fine lady ? A fine lady can laugh at the death of her husband, and cry for the loss of a lapdog : a fine lady is angry without a cause, and pleased without a rea son : a fine lady has the vapours all the morning and the colic all the afternoon : the pride of a fine lady is above the merit of an understanding head ; yet her vanity will stoop to the adoration of a peruke : and, in fine, a fine lady goes to church for fashion's sake, and to the basset-table with de votion ; and her passion for gaming exceeds her vanity of being thought virtuous, or the desire of acting the contrary. \u2014 We seamen speak plain, brother. Enter Colonel Standard and Captain Fireball meeting. Stand. Ha, brother Fireball ! welcome ashore. What, heart whole ? limbs firm, and frigate safe ? Fire. All, all, as my fortune and friends could wish. Stand. And what news from the Baltic ? Fire. Why, yonder are three or four young boys i' th' North, that have got globes and sceptres to play with. They fell to loggerheads about their playthings ; the English came in like Robin Good fellow, cried Boh ! and made 'em be quiet. Stand. In the next place, then, you're to con gratulate my success. You have heard, I suppose, that I've married a fine lady with a great fortune. Fire. Ay, ay; 'twas my first news upon my landing, that colonel Standard had married the fine lady Lurewell \u2014 a fine lady indeed I a very fine lady ! But faith, brother, I had rather turn skip per to an Indian canoe than manage the vessel you're master of. Stand. Why so, sir .' Fire. Because she'll run adrift with every wind that blows : she's all sail and no ballast. \u2014 Shall I Stand. You seamen are like your element, al ways tempestuous, too ruffling to handle a fine lady. Fire. Say you so ? why then, give me thy hand, honest Frank ; and let the world talk on, and be damned ! Stand. The world talk, say you ? what does the world talk ? Fire. Nothing, nothing at all.\u2014 They only say what's usual upon such occasions : that your wife's the greatest coquette about the court, and your wor ship the greatest cuckold about the city ; that's all."], [636, "542 SIR HARRY WILDAIR. ACT I. were a hundred ranks of sneering white teeth drawn upon your misfortunes at once ; which so mangled your wife's reputation, that she can never patch up her honour while she lives. S'and. How, how, sir ! Fire. That sheTs a coquette, and you a cuckold. Stand. She's an angel in herself, and a paradise to me. Fire. She's an Eve in herself and a devil to you. Stand. She's all truth and the world a liar. Stand. And their teeth were very white, you say ? Fire. Very white ! blood, sir, I say\\ they man gled your wife's reputation. Stand. And I say, that if they touch my wife's reputation with nothing but their teeth, her honour will be safe enough. Fire. Then you won't hear it? Stand. Not a syllable. Listening after slander, is laying nets for serpents, which, when you have caught, will sting you to death : let 'em spit their venom among themselves, and it hurts nobody. Fire. Lord ! Lord ! how cuckoldom and con tentment go together ! \u2014 Fy, fy, sir ! consider you have been a soldier, dignified by a noble post ; dis tinguished by brave actions, an honour to your nation, and a terror to your enemies. \u2014 Hell ! that a man who has stormed Namur, should become the jest of a coffee-table ! \u2014 The whole house was clearly taken up with the two important questions, whether the colonel was a cuckold or Kid a pirate. Stand. This I cannot bear. [Aside. Fire. Why then, egad, brother, it shall be so ; I'll back again to White's, and whoever dares mutter scandal of my brother and sister, I'll dash his ratafia in's face, and call him a liar. [Going. Stand. Hold, hold, sir! The world is too strong for us. Were scandal and detraction to be throughly revenged, we must murder all the beaux, and poison half the ladies. Those that have nothing else to say must tell stories : fools over burgundy, and ladies over tea, must have some thing that's sharp to relish their liquor ; malice is the piquant sauce of such conversation, and with out it their entertainment would prove mighty insipid. \u2014 Now, brother, why should we pretend to quarrel with all mankind ? Fire. Because that all mankind quarrel witb us. Stand. The worst reason in the world Would you pretend to devour a lion because a lion would devour you ? Fire. Yes, if I could. Stand. Ay, that's right ; if you could ! But since you have neither teeth nor paws for such an encounter, lie quietly down, and perhaps the furious beast may run over you. Fire. 'Sdeath, sir ! but, I say, that whoever abuses my brother's wife, though at the back of the king's chair, he's a villain. Stand. No, no, brother, that's a contradiction ; there's no such thing as villany at court. Indeed, if the practice of courts were found in a single person, he might be styled villain with a vengeance ; but number and power authorises everything, and turns the villain upon the:r accusers. In short, sir, every man's morals, like his religion now-a-days, pleads liberty of conscience *, every man's con science is his convenience, and we know no con venience but preferment. \u2014 As for instance, who would be so complaisant as to thank an officer for bis courage, when that's the condition of his pay ? and who can be so ill-natured as to blame a courtier for espousing that which is the very tenure of his livelihood ? Fire. Ay, (says a sneering coxcomb,) the colonel has made his fortune with a witness ; he has se cured himself a good estate in this life, and a re version in the world to come. Then (replies an other) I presume he's obliged to your lordship's bounty for the latter part of the settlement. There are others (says a third) that have played with my lady Lurewell at picquet, besides my lord ; I have capotted her myself two or three times in an evening. Stand. O matrimonial patience assist me ! Fire. Matrimonial patience ! matrimonial pes tilence ! \u2014 Shake off these drowsy chains that fetter your resentments. If your wife has wronged ye, pack her off, and let her person be as public as her character.: if she be honest, revenge her quarrel. \u2014 I can stay no longer : this is ray hour of attend ance at the Navy Office ; I'll come and dine with you ; in the meantime, revenge ; think on't. [Exit. Stand. How easy is it to give advice, and how difficult to observe it ! If your wife has wronged ye, pack her off. Ay, but how ! The Gospel drives the matrimonial nail, and the law clinches it so very hard, that to draw it again would tear the work to pieces. \u2014 That her intentions have wronged me, here's a young bawd can witness. Fire. A very good argument in a very damnable cause ! \u2014 But, sir, my business is not with the court, but with you : I desire you, sir, to open your eyes ; at least, be pleased to lend an ear to what I heard just now at the Chocolate-house. Stand. Brother ! Enter Parly, running across the stage. Here, here, Mrs. Parly ; whither so fast ? Par. Oh lord ! my master ! \u2014 Sir, I was running to mademoiselle Furbelo, the French milliner, for a new burgundy for my lady's head. Fire. Well, sir. Stand. Did the scandal please you when you heard it ? Fire. No. Stand. No, child, you're employed about an old fashioned garniture for your master's head, if I mis take not your errand. Par. Oh, sir ! there's the prettiest fashion lately come over ! so airy, so French, and all that ! The pinners are double ruffled with twelve plaits of a side, and open all from the face ; the hair is frizzled all up round the head, and stands as stiff as a bodkin. Then the favourites hang loose upon the temples, with a languishing lock in the middle Then the caul is extremely wide, and over all is a coronet raised very high, and all the lappets behind. \u2014I must fetch it presently. [Going. Stand. Then why should you think it should please me? Be not more uncharitable to your friends than to yourself, sweet sir : if it made you uneasy, there's no question but it will torment me, who am so much nearer concerned. Fire. But would you not be glad to know your enemies ? Stand. Psha! if they abused me they are my friends, my intimate friends, my table company, and pot companions. Fire. Why then, brother, the devil take all your acquaintance ! Y'ou were so rallied, so torn ! there"], [637, "SCENE I. SIR HARRY WILDAIR. 543 Stand. Hold a little, child ; I must talk with Par. Shall I tell you a christian lie, or a pagan truth ? V 8 you. Par. Another time, sir, my lady stays for it. Stand. One question first : \u2014 what wages does my wife give you ? Par. Ten pound a year, sir ; which Gad knows is little enough, considering how I slave from place to place upon her occasions. But, then, sir, my perquisites are considerable ; I make above two hundred pound a year of her old clothes. Stand. [Aside.] Two hundred pound a year by her old clothes ! what then must her new ones cost ? Stand. Come, truth for once. Par. Why, then, interest, interest. I have a great soul, which nothing can gain but a great bribe. Stand. Well, though thou art a devil, thou art a very honest one. Give me thy hand, wench. Should not interest make you faithful to me as much as to others ? Par. Honest to you ! marry for what ? You gave me indeed two pitiful pieces the dav you were married, but not a stiver since. One gallant gives me ten guineas, another a watch, another a pair of pendants, a fourth a diamond ring; and my noble master gives me\u2014 his linen to mend. \u2014 Faugh ! I'll tell you a secret, sir: stinginess to servants makes more cuckolds, than ill-nature to wives. Stand. And am I a cuckold, Parly ? Par. No, faith, not yet ; though in a very fair way of having the dignity conferred upon you very suddenly. Stand. Come, girl, you shall be my pensioner ; you shall have a glorious revenue ; for every guinea that you get for keeping of a secret, I'll give you two for revealing it. You shall find a husband once in your life outdo all your gallants in gene rosity. Take their money, child, take all their bribes : give 'em hopes, make 'em assignations ; serve your lady faithfully, but tell all to me. By which means, she will be kept chaste, you will grow rich, and I shall preserve my honour. Par. But what security shall I have for pre formance of articles ? \u2014 [Aloud.] But what do you get by visiting gal lants and picquet ? Par. About a hundred pound more. Stand. [Aside.] A hundred pound more! Now who can expect to find a lady's woman honest, when she gets so much by beingajade? \u2014 [Aloud.] What religion are you of, Mrs. Parly ? Par. 1 can't tell. Stand. What was your father ? Par. A mountebank. Stand. Where were you born ? I'ar. In Holland. Stand. Were you ever christened ? Par. No. Stand. How came that ? Par. My parents were Anabaptists : they died before I was dipped ; 1 then forsook their religion, and ha' got ne'er a new one since. Stand.

Yes, faith, and as gay as ever. Stand. And has he forgot his wife so soon ? Par. Why, she has been dead now above a year. \u2014 He appeared in the Ring last night with such splendour and equipage, that he eclipsed the beaux, dazzled the ladies, and made your wife dream all night of six Flanders mares, seven French liveries, a wig like a cloak, and a hat like a shittlecock. Stand- What are a woman's promises and oaths ? Par. Lord, sir, you need not be so furious. Never christened ! what then? I may be a very good Christian for all that I suppose. \u2014 Turn me off! sir, you shan't. Meddle with your fellows ; 'tis my lady's business to order her women. Stand. [Aside.] Here's a young whore for you now ! A sweet companion for my wife ! Where there's such a hellish confidante, there must be damnable secrets. \u2014 [Aloud.] Begone, I say ! My wife shall turn you away. Par. Sir, she won't turn me away, she shan't turn me away, nor she can't turn me away. Sir, I say, she dare not turn me away. Stand. Why, you jade ? why ? Par Because I'm the mistress, not she. Stand. You the mistress ! Par. W7ind, wind, sir. Stand.

Well, well ; I know all this already ; and that she plucked up her spirits at last, and went to follow him. Dicky. Very well. Follow him we did, far and far, and farther than I can tell, till we came to a place called Montpelier, in France ; a goodly place truly. \u2014 But Sir Harry was gone to Rome; there was our labour lost. \u2014 But, to be short, my poor lady, with the tiresomeness of travelling, fell sick \u2014 and died. [Cries. Par. Poor woman ! Dicky. Ay, but that was not all : here comes the worst of the story. Those cursed barbarous devils, the French, would not let us bury her. Par. Not bury her ! Dicky. No, she was a heretic woman, and they would not let her corpse be put in their holy ground. \u2014 Oh, damn their holy ground, for me ! Par. [Aside.] Now had not I better be an honest pagan, as I am, than such a christian as one of these ? \u2014 [Aloud.] But how did you dispose the body ? Dicky. Why, there was one charitable gentle woman that used to visit my lady in her sickness: she contrived the matter so, that she had her buried in her own private chapel. This lady and myself carried her out upon our own shoulders through a back-door, at the hour of midnight, and laid her in a grave that I dug for her with my own hands ; and if we had been catched by the priests, we had gone to the gallows without the benefit of clergy. Par. Oh, the devil take 'em! \u2014 But what did they mean by a heretic woman ? Par. I am now not only woman to the lady Lurewell, but steward to her husband, in my dou ble capacity of knowing her secrets, and command ing his purse. A very pretty office in a family ! For every guinea that I get for keeping a secret, he'll give me two for revealing it. \u2014 My comings-in, at this rate, will be worth a master in chancery's place, and many a poor Templar will be glad to marry rae with half my fortune.

Why, I han't tasted a bit this year and half, woman ; I have been wandering about all over the world, following my master, and come home to dear London but two days ago. Now the devil take me, if I had not rather kiss an English pair of pattens, than the finest lady in France. Par. Then you're overjoyed to see London again ? Dicky. Oh ! I was just dead of a consumption, till the sweet smoke of Cheapside, and the dear perfume of Fleet-ditch, made me a man again. Par. But how came you to live with sir Harry Wildair ? Dicky. I don't know ; some sort of a cannibal, I believe. I know there are some cannibal women here in England, that come to the playhouses in masks ; but let them have a care how they go to France : for they are all heretics, I believe. But I'm sure my good lady was none of these. Par. But how did sir Harry bear the news? Dicky. Why, you must know, that my lady after she was buried sent me \u2014 Dicky. Why, seeing me a handsome personable fellow, and well qualified for a livery, he took a fancy to my figure, that was all. Par. And what's become of your old master ? Dicky. Oh ! hang me, he was a blockhead, and I turned him off, I turned him away. Par. And were not you very sorry for the loss of your mistress, sir Harry's lady ? They say, she was a very good woman. Dicky. Oh ! the sweetest woman that ever the sun shined upon. I could almost weep when I think of her. [Wiping his eyes. Par. How did she die, pray ? 1 could never hear how 'twas. Par. How ! after she was buried ! Dicky. Psha ! why Lord, mistress, you know what I mean ! I went to sir Harry all the way to Rome ; and where d'ye think I found him ? Par. Where ? Dicky. Why, in the middle of a monastery among a hundred and fifty nuns, playing at hot cockles. He was surprised to see honest Dicky, you may be sure. But when I told him the sad story, he roared out a whole volley of English oaths upon the spot, and swore that he would set fire on the pope's palace for the injury done to his wife. He then flew away to his chamber, locked himself up for three days ; we thought to have found him dead ; but instead of that, he called for his best linen, fine wig, gilt coach ; and laughing very heartily, swore again he would be revenged, and bid them drive to the nunnery ; and he was re venged to some purpose. Dicky. Give me a buss then, and I'll tell ye. Par. You shall have your wages when your work's done. Dicky. Well then\u2014 courage !\u2014 Now for a doleful tale. \u2014 You know that my master took a freak to go"], [639, "SCENE T. SIR HARRY WILDAIR. 545 Par. How, how, dear Mr. Dicky ? Dicky. Why, in the matter of five days he got six nuns with child, and left 'em to provide for their heretic bastards. \u2014 Ah, plague on 'em ! they hate a dead heretic, but they love a piping bot warm heretic with all their hearts. \u2014 So away we came ; and thus did he jog on, revenging himself at this rate through all the Catholic countries that we passed, till we came home ; and now, Mrs. Parly, I fancy he has some designs of revenge too upon your lady.

I did nothing but tumble about, and fence with the sheets all night long. Oh ! my bones ache this morning as if I had lain all night on a pair of Dutch stairs. \u2014 Go, bring chocolate \u2014 and, d'ye hear ? be sure to stay an hour or two at least. \u2014 [Exeunt Chambermaids.] Well, these English animals are so unpolished !

Too strait, perhaps ? Lady Lure. Not at all I they fit me very well , but \u2014 Lard bless me ! can't you tell where she fault lies ? Bern. Why truly, madam, I can't tell. But your ladyship, I think, is a little too slender for the fashion. Re-enter Chambermaids with chocolate. Lady Lure. How ! too slender for the fashion, say you ? And what made you stay so long ? 1 Cham. I thought we did not stay at all, madam. Bern. Yes, madam ; there's no such thing as a good shape worn among the quality : your fine waists are clear out, clear out, madam. Lady Lure.

What ! d'ye think I wear clothes to please myself? Fit me ! fit the fashion, pray ; no matter for me. I thought something was the matter ; I wanted of quality-air. Pray, Mr. Remnant, let me have a bulk of quality, a spreading contour. I do remem ber now, the ladies in the apartments, the birth night, were most of 'em two yards about.

I'm your very humble servant ; you're not unlike your brother in the face ; but methinks, sir, you don't become his humour alto gether so well; for what's nature in him looks like affectation in you. Ban. Oh, Lard, sir ! 'tis rather nature in me what is acquired by him ; he's beholding to his education for his air. Now where d'ye think my humour was established ? that was all in sables for the death of his wife ; there I was told, that he designed to change his ha bitation, because he would avoid all remembrances that might disturb his quiet. You are the first person that has told me of his arrival, and I expect that you may likewise inform me where to wait on him. Stand. And I suppose, sir, this was the business that occasioned me the honour of this visit ? Ban. Partly this, and partly an affair of greater consequence. You must know, sir, that though I have read ten thousand lies in the university, yet I have learned to speak the truth myself ; and to deal plainly with you, the honour of this visit, as you were pleased to term it, was designed to the lady Lurewell.

Why, look ye, sir ; you may have the honour of being called the lady Lurewell's hus band ; but you will never find in any author, either ancient or modern, that she's called Mr. Standard's wife. 'Tis true, you're a handsome young fellow : she liked you, she married you ; and though the priest made you both one flesh, yet there's no small distinction in your blood. You are still a disbanded colonel, and she is still a woman of quality, I take it. Ban. First tell me, sir, which will you choose, to be run through the body, or shot through the head ? Stand. And you are the most impudent young fellow I ever met with in all my life, I take it. Ban. Sir, I'm a master of arts, and I plead the privilege of my standing. Fire. Follow me, and I'll tell ye. Ban. Sir, my servants shall attend ye, if you have no equipage of your own. Fire. Blood, sir ! Stand. Hold, brother, hold ! he's a boy. Ban. Look ye, sir, I keep half-a-dozen footmen that have no business upon earth but to answer impertinent questions ; now, sir, if your fighting stomach can digest these six brawny fellows for a breakfast, their master, perhaps, may do you the favour to run you through the body for a dinner. Fire. Sirrah, will you fight me ? I received just now six months' pay, and by this light, I'll give you the half on't for one fair blow at your scull. Ban. Down with your money, sir. Stand.

As I hope to breathe, I think 'tis the best penned piece I have seen a great while ; I don't know any of our authors have writ in so florid and genteel a style. Sir Har. Upon the subject, madam, I dare affirm there is nothing extant more moving. \u2014 Look ye, madam, I am an author rich in expressions ; The needy poets of the age may fill Their works with rhapsodies of flames and darts, Their barren sighs and tears, their speaking looks Aod amorous vows, that might in Chaucer's time, Perhaps, have pass'd for love; but now 'Tis only such as 1 can touch that noble passion, And by the true, persuasive eloquence, Turn'd in the moving style of louis-d'ors, Can raise the ravish'd female to a rapture. In short, madam, I'll match Cowley in softness, o'ertop Milton in sublime, banter Cicero in elo quence, and Dr. Swan in quibbling, by the help of that most ingenious society, called the Bank of England. Lady Lure. Ay, sir Harry, I begin to hate that old thing called love ; they say 'tis clear out in France. Sir Har. Clear out, clear out ! nobody wears it : and here, too, honesty went out with the slashed doublets, and love with the close-bodied gowns. Love ! 'tis so obsolete, so mean, and out of fashion, that I can conjpare it to nothing but the miserable picture of Patient Grizzle at the head of an old room. Lady Lure. Discovered, too, by a stranger ! \u2014 What shall I do ? Sir Har. [ Within.] Madam, you have got the most confounded pens here !

Like her! \u2014 ha I ha! ha! \u2014 so very well, faith, that for her very sake I'm in love with every woman I meet. Lady Lure. And did matrimony please you ex tremely ? Sir Har. So very much, that if polygamy were allowed, I would have a new wife every day. Lady Lure. Oh, sir Harry ! this is raillery. But your serious thoughts upon the matter, pray. Sir Har. Why then, madam, to give you my true sentiments of wedlock : I had a lady that I married by chance, she was virtuous by chance, and I loved her by great chance. Nature gave her beauty, education, and air, and Fortune threw a young fellow of five-and-twenty in her lap. I courted her all day, loved her all night, she was my mistress one day, my wife another : I found in one the variety of a thousand, and the very con finement of marriage gave me the pleasure of change. Lady Lure. And she was very virtuous ? Sir Har. Look ye, madam, you know she was beautiful. She had good-nature about her mouth, the smile of beauty in her cheeks, sparkling wit in her forehead, and sprightly love in her eyes. Lady Lure. Psha ! I knew her very well ; the woman was well enough. But yon don't answer my question, sir. Sir Har. So, madam, as I told you before, she was young and beautiful, I was rich and vigorous ; my estate gave a lustre to my love, and a swing to our enjoyment ; round, like the ring that made us one, our golden pleasures circled without end. Lady Lure. Golden pleasures ! golden fiddle sticks ! \u2014 What d'ye tell me of your canting stuff? Was she virtuous, I say ? Sir Har. [Aside.] Ready to burst with envy; but I will torment thee a little. \u2014 [Aloud.] So, madam, I powdered to please her, she dressed to engage me ! we toyed away the morning in amo rous n&nsense, lolled away the evening in the Park, or the playhouse, and all the night \u2014 hem ! \u2014 Lady Lure. Look ye, sir, answer my question, or I shall take it ill. Lady Lure. Why then, as I hope to breathe, you shall hear it. \u2014 The picture ! the picture ! the picture ! [Bawling aloud. Sir Har. Ran, tan, tan ! A pistol-bullet from ear to ear. Lady Lure. That picture which you had just now from the French marquis, for a thousand pound, that very picture did your very virtuous wife send to the marquis as a pledge of her very virtuous and dying affection. So that you are both robbed of your honour, and cheated of your money. [Aloud. Sir Har. Louder, louder, madam ! Lady Lure. I tell you, sir, your wife was a jilt; I know it, 111 swear it. \u2014 She virtuous ! she was a devil. Sir Har. Fal, al, deral ! [Singi. Lady Lure. Was ever the like seen ! He won't hear me \u2014 I burst with malice, and now he won't mind me. \u2014 Won't you hear me yet? Sir Har. No, no, madam. Lady Lure. Nay, then I can't bear it. \u2014 [Bursts out a-crying.] Sir, I must say that you're an unworthy person, to use a woman of quality at this rate, when she has her heart full of malice ; I don't know but it may make me miscarry. Sir3 I say again and again, that she was no better than one of us, and I know it ; I have seen it with my eyes, so I have. Sir Har. Good Heavens deliver me, I beseech thee! How shall I 'scape? [Aside. Lady Lure. Will you hear me yet ? Dear sir Harry, do but hear me ; I'm longing to speak. Sir Har. Oh, I have it ! \u2014 Hush ! hush! hush ! Sir Har. Then, madam, there was never such a pattern of unity. \u2014 Her wants were still prevented by my supplies ; my own heart whispered me her desires, 'cause she herself was there ; no contention ever rose, but the dear strife of who should most oblige ; no noise about authority : for neither would stoop to command, 'cause both thought it glory to ubey. Lady Lure. Stuff! stuff! stuff!\u2014 I won't be lieve a word on't. Lady Lure. Eh ! what's the matter ? Sir Har. A mouse ! a mouse ! a mouse ! Lady Lure. Where ? where ? where ? Sir Har. Your petticoats, your petticoats, ma dam ! \u2014 [Lady Lurewell shrieks and runs off.] Oh, my head !

Ha! ha! ha! \u2014 Then, madam, we never felt the yoke of matrimony, because our incli nations made as one ; a power superior to the forms of wedlock.

Sir Harry ! how came you hither ? Sir Har. Ah, poor fellow ! thou hast got thy load with a witness ; but the wine was humming strong ; I have got a touch on't myself. [ Reels a little. [Goes into the closet, and peeps out. Enter Shark and Sailor, with Clincher in a chair , Parly following. Par. Hold, hold, friend ! who gave you orders to lug in your dirty chair into the house? Shark. My master, sweetheart. Par. Who is your master, impudence ? Shark. Everybody, saucebox. \u2014 And, for the present, here's my master ! and, if you have any thing to say to him, there he is for ye. \u2014 [Lugs Clincher out of the chair, and throws him upon the floor.] Steer away, Tom. [Exit with Sailor. Sir Har. What the devil, Mr. Jubilee, is it you? Par. Bless me ! the gentleman's dead ! Murder ! murder ! Re-enter Lady Lurewell. Lady Lure. Protect me ! What's the matter, Clincher ? Par. Mr. Clincher, are you dead, sir ? Clinch. Yes. Lady Lure. Oh ! then, 'tis well enough. \u2014 Are you drunk, sir ? Clinch. No. Lady Lure. Well ! certainly I'm the most un fortunate woman living : all my affairs, all my designs, all my intrigues, miscarry. \u2014 Faugh ! the beast \u2014 But, sir, what's the matter with you ? Clinch. Politics. Stand. Wine, sir Harry ! what wine ? Sir Har. Why, 'twas new burgundy, heady stuff. \u2014 But the dog was soon gone, knocked under pre sently. Stand. What, then Mr. Clincher was with you, it seems ? eh ! Par. Where have you been, sir ? Clinch. Shark ! Lady Lure. What shall we do with him, Parly ? If the colonel should come home now, we were ruined. Enter Colonel Standard. Oh, inevitable destruction ! Sir Har. Yes, faith, we have been together all this afternoon ; 'tis a pleasant foolish fellow. He would needs give me a welcome to town, on pre tence of hearing all the news from the Jubilee. The humour was new to me ; so to't we went. \u2014 But 'tis a weak-headed coxcomb; two or three bumpers did his business. \u2014 [Aside to Lady Lurewell.] Ah, madam, what do I deserve for this ? Sir Har. Ay, ay ; unless I relieve her now, all the world can't save her. Stand. Bless me ! what's here ? \u2014 Who are you, sir? Clinch. Brandy. Stand. See there, madam ! \u2014 Behold the man that you prefer to me ! And such as he are all those topgallants that daily haunt my house, ruin your honour, and disturb my quiet. \u2014 I urge not the sacred bond of marriage ; I'll waive your ear nest vows of truth to me, and only lay the case in equal balance ; and see whose merit bears the greater weight, his or mine. Lady Lure. Look ye there, sir ; you see how sir Harry has cleared my innocence. \u2014 [Aside to Sir Habey Wildair ] I'm obliged t'ye, sir; but I must leave you to make it out, [Exit, Parly following. Stand. Yes, yes ; he has cleared you wonder fully. \u2014 But pray, sir, I suppose you can inform me how Mr. Clincher came into my house ? eh ! Sir Har. Ay ; why, you must know that the fool got presently as drunk as a drum ; so I had him tumbled into a chair, and ordered the fellows to carry him home. Now you must know he lodges but three doors off ; but the boobies, it seems, mistook the door, and brought him in here, like a brace of loggerheads. Stand. Oh, yes ; sad loggerheads, to mistake a door in James's for a house in Covent-garden. \u2014 Sir Har. Well argued, colonel! Stand. Suppose yourself freely disengaged, un married, and to make a choice of him you thought most worthy of your love ; would you prefer a brute ? a monkey ? one destined only for the sport of man ! \u2014 Yes : take him to your bed ; there let the beast disgorge his fulsome load in your fair, lovely bosom ; snore out his passion in your soft embrace ; and, with the vapours of his sick debauch, perfume your sweet apartment. Lady Lure. Ah, nauseous ! nauseous ! poison ! Stand. I ne'er was taught to set a value on my self: but, when compared to him, there modesty must stoop, and indignation give my words a loose, to tell you, madam, that I am a man unblemished in my honour, have nobly served my king and country ; and, for a lady's service, I think that nature has not been defective. Sir Har. Egad, I should think so too ; the fellow's well made. Here ! [Calls. Enter Footmen. Take away that brute. \u2014 [Footmen carry off Clincher.] And you say 'twas new burgundy, sir Harry, very strong ? Sir Har. [Aside.] Egad, there is some trick in this matter, and I shall be discovered. \u2014 [Aloud.] Ay, colonel ; but I must be gone : I'm engaged to meet \u2014 colonel, I'm your humble servant. [Going.

Oh, morbleu ! these hats, gloves, canes, and swords, are the ruin of all our designs. [Aside. Marq. Pardie, I'm amaze too. Stand. Look ye, monsieur Marquis, as for your part, I shall cut your throat, sir. Sir Har. Give me leave, I must cut his throat first. Stand. But where's your hat, sir Harry ? Sir Har. [Aside. ] I'll never intrigue again with anything about me but what is just bound to my body. How shall I come off? \u2014 [Aloud.] Hark ye, colonel, in your ear ; I would not have your lady hear it. \u2014 You must know, just as I came into the room here, what should I spy but a great mouse running across that closet-door. 1 took no notice, for fear your lady should be frighted, but with all my force (d'ye see), I flung my hat at it, and so threw it into the closet, and there it lies.

[Exit, Parly following. Sir Har. Ay, ay ; so 'tis, faith. Come, mon sieur, I must talk with you, sir. [Exeunt. Stand. And so, thinking to kill the mouse, you flung your hat into that closet ? Sir Har. Ay, ay ; that was all. I'll go fetch it. Stand. No, sir Harry, I'll bring it out. [Goes into the closet. Sir Har. Now have I told a matter of twenty lies in a breath. Stand.

In short, brother, a man may talk till doomsday of sin, hell, and damnation ; but your rhetoric will never convince a lady that there's anything of a devil in a handsome fellow with a fine coat. You must show the cloven-foot, expose the brute as I have done ; and though her virtue sleeps, her pride will surely take the alarm. Fire. Ay, but if you had let me cut off one of the rogue's ears before you sent him away \u2014 Stand. No, no ; the fool has served my turn, without the scandal of a public resentment ; and the effect has shown that my design was right ; I've touched her very heart, and she relents apace. Sir Har. Do you remember anything of a thou sand pounds lent to my wife in Montpelier by a French gentleman ? Marq. Oui, monsieur Dicky, you remembre de genrilman, he was one marquis. Dicky. Marqui, sir ! I think, for my part, that all the men in France are marqui's. We met above a thousand marqui's, but the devil a one of 'em could lend a thousand pence, much less a thousand pound I Marq. Morbleu, que dites-vous, bougre le chien? Sir Har. Hold, sir, pray answer me one ques tion ? What made you fly your country ? Marq My religion, monsieur. Sir Har.

Two hundred guineas ! have you any thing to show for it ? Sir Har. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Show for it, my lord ! I showed quint and quatorze for it ; and to a man of honour, that's as firm as a bond and judgment. Lord Bel. Come, sir, this won't pass upon me ; I'm a man of honour. Par. I thought so, madam.

Lord Bet. Why should you think so, sir ? Sir Har. Because the world's improved, my lord, and we find that this honour is a very trouble some and impertinent thing. Can't we live together like good neighbours and Christians, as they do in France ? I lend you my coach, I borrow yours ; you dine with me, I sup with you ; I He with your wife, and you lie with mine.

Pray, sir Harry, tell me what made you leave your wife? Sir Har. Ha! ha! ha! I knew it. \u2014 Pray, colonel, what makes you stay with your wife? Stand. Nay, but pray answer me directly ; I beg it as a favour. Sir Har. Why then, colonel, you must know we were a pair of the most happy, toying, foolish people in the world, till she got, I don't know how, a crotchet of jealousy in her head. This made her frumpish ; but we had ne'er an angry word : she only fell a-crying over night, and I went for Italy next morning. \u2014 But pray no more on't.\u2014 Are you hurt, monsieur ?

How came you by my letter to my brother ? Angel. By intercepting all your letters since I came home. But for my ghostly contrivance, good Mrs. Parly (moved by the justness of my cause, and a bribe) was my chief engineer. Enter Captain Fireball and Marquis. Fire.

Hold, bold, madam ! Don't be angry, my dear ; you took me unprovided : had you but sent me word of your coming, I had got three or four speeches out of Oroonoko and the Mourning Bride upon this occasion, that would have charmed your very heart. But we'll do as well as we can ; I'll have the music from both houses ; Pawlet and Locket shall contrive for our taste ; we'll charm our ears with Abel's voice ; feast our eyes with one another ; and thus, with all our senses tuned to love, we'll hurl off our clothes, leap into bed, and there \u2014 look ye, madam, if I don't welcome you home with raptures more natural and more moving than all the plays in Christendom \u2014 1'U say no more. Angel. As mad as ever ! Sir Har. But ease my wonder first, and let me know the riddle of your death. Angel. Your unkind departure hence, and your avoiding me abroad, made me resolve, since I could not live with you, to die to all the world besides ; I fancied that though it exceeded the force of love, yet the power of grief perhaps might change your humour, and therefore had it given out that 1 died in France ; my sickness at Montpelier, which indeed was next to death, and the affront offered to the body of our ambassador's chaplain at Paris, con duced to have my burial private. This deceived my retinue ; and by the assistance of my woman, and your faithful servant, I got into man's clothes, came home into England, and sent him to observe your motions abroad, with orders not to undeceive you till your return. \u2014 Here I met you in the quality of beau Banter, your busy brother, under which disguise I have disappointed your design upon my lady Lurewell ; and in the form of a ghost, have revenged the scandal she this day threw upon me, and have frighted her sufliciently from lying alone. I did resolve to have frighted you likewise, but you were too hard for me. [Pulling out the other picture. Ang. They are very much alike. Sir liar. So like, that one might fairly pass for t'other. \u2014 Monsieur marquis, ecoute. You did lie vid my vise, and she did give you de picture for your pain.

We're obliged to you, ladies, for your advice ; and in return, give me leave to give you the definition of a good wife, in the character of my own \u2014 The wit of her conversation never outstrips the conduct of her behaviour: she's affable to all men, free with no man, and only kind to me: often cheerful, sometimes gay, and always pleased, but when I am angry ; then sorry, not sullen. The Park, playhouse, and cards, she frequents in com pliance with custom ; but her diversions of inclina tion are at home : she's more cautious of a remarkable woman than of a noted wit, well knowing than the infection of her own sex is more catching than the temptation of ours. To all this, she is beautiful to a wonder, scorns all devices that engage a gallant, and uses all arts to please her husband. Stand. Now, sir Harry, we have retrieved our wives ; yours from death, and mine from the devil ; and they are at present very honest. But how shall we keep 'em so? Angel. By being good husbands, sir ; and the great secret for keeping matters right in wedlock, is never to quarrel with your wives for trifles.

In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas Corpora. \u2014 Ovid. Ovid. Met. TO RICHARD TIGHE, ESQ. Sir, \u2014 Dedications are the only fashions in the world that are more disliked for being universal ; and the reason is, that they very seldom fit the persons they were made for ; but I hope to avoid the common obloquy in this address, by laying aside the poet in everything but the dramatic decorum of suiting my character to the person. From the part of Mirabel in this play, and another character in one of my former, people are willing to compliment my performance in drawing a gay, splendid, generous, easy, fine young gentleman. My genius, I must confess, has a bent to that kind of description ; and my veneration for you, Sir, may pass for unquestionable, since in all these happy accomplishments, you come so near to my darling character, abating his inconstancy. What an unspeakable blessing is youth and fortune, when a happy understanding comes in, to moderate the desires of the first, and to refine upon the advantages of the latter ; when a gentleman is master of all pleasures, but a slave to none ; who has travelled, not for the curiosity of the sight, but for the improvement of the mind's eye ; and who returns full of everything but himself ! \u2014 An author might say a great deal more, but a friend, Sir, nay an enemy, must allow you this, I shall here, Sir, meet with two obstacles, your modesty and your sense ; the first as a censor upon the subject, the \u2022second as a critic upon the style. But I am obstinate in my purpose, and will maintain what I say to the last drop of my pen ; which I may the more boldly undertake, having all the world on my side ; nay, I have your very self against you; for by declining to hear your own merit, your friends are authorised the more to proclaim it. Your generosity and easiness of temper is not only obvious in your common affairs and conversation, but more plainly evident in your darling amusement, that opener and dilater of the mind, music ; \u2014 from your affection for this delightful study, we may deduce the pleasing harmony that is apparent in all your actions : and be assured, Sir, that a person must be possessed of a very divine soul, who is so much in love with the entertainment of angels. From your encouragement of music, if there be any poetry here, it has a claim, by the right of kindred, to your favour and affection. You were pleased to honour the representation of this play with your appearance at several times, which flattered my hopes that there might be something in it which your good-nature might excuse. With the honour I here intend for myself, I likewise consult the interest of my nation, by showing a person th.it is so much a reputation and credit to my country. Besides all this, I was willing to make a handsome compliment to the place of my pupilage ; by informing the world that so fine a gentleman had the seeds of his education in the same university, and at the same time with, Sir, your most faithful, and most humble servant, G. FARQUHAR. PREFACE. To give you the history of this play would but cause the reader and the writer a trouble to no purpose ; I shall only say that I t-iok the hint from Fletcher's \" Wild-Goose Chase ;\" and to those who say, that I have spoiled the original, I wish no other injury, but that they would say it again. \\s to the success of it, I think 'tis but a kind of Cremona business, I have neither lost nor won. I pushed fairly, but the French were prepossessed, and the charms of Gallic heels were toohard for an English brain ; but I am proud to own, that I have laid my head at the ladies' feet. The favour was unavoidable, for we are a nation 60 very fond of improving our understanding, that the instructions of a play does no good, when it comes in competition with the moral of minuet. Hiny tells us in his \" Natural History,\" of elephants that were taught to dance on the ropes ; if this could be made practicable now, what a number of subscriptions might be had to bring the Great Mogul out of Fleet-street, and make him dance between the acts I remember that about two years ago, I had a gentleman from France that brought the playhouse some fifty audiences in five months ; then why should I be surprised to find a French lady do as much ? 'Tis the prettiest way in"], [656, "THE INCONSTANT ; OR, 562 the world of despising the French king, to let him see that we can afford money to bribe away his dancers., when he, poor man, has exhausted all his stock, in buying of some pitiful towns and principalities : cum multis aliis. What can be a greater compliment to our generous nation, than to have the lady, upon her retour to Paris, boast of their splendid entertainment in England, of the complaisance, liberality, and good-nature of a people, that thronged her house so full that she had not room to stick a pin ; and left a poor fellow, that had the misfortune of being one of themselves, without one farthing, for half a year's pains that he had taken for their entertainment ! There were some gentlemen in the pit the first night, that took the hint from the prologue to damn the play ; but they made such a noise in the execution, that the people took the outcry for a reprieve ; so that the darling mischief was overlaid by their over-fondness of the changeling. 'Tis somewhat hard, that gentlemen should debase themselves into a faction of a dozen , to stab a single person, who never had the resolution to face two men at a time ; if he has had the misfortune of any misunderstanding with a particular person, he has had a particular person to answer it. But these sparks would be remarkable in their resentment ; and if anybody falls under their displeasure, they scorn to call him to a particular account, but will very honourably burn his house, or pick his pocket. The New-house has perfectly made me a convert by their civility on my sixth night ; for, to be friends, and revenged at the same time, I must give them a play, that is, \u2014 when I write another. For faction runs so high, that I could wish the senate would suppress the houses, or put in force the act against bribing elections ; that house which has the most favours to bestow, will certainly carry it, spite of all poetical justice that would support t'other. I have heard some people so extravagantly angry at this play, that one would think they had no reason to be displeased at all ; whilst some {otherwise men of good sense) have commended it so much, that I was afraid they ridiculed me; so that between both, 1 am absolutely at a loss what to think on't ; for though the cause has come on six days successively, yet the trial, 1 fancy, is not determined. When our devotion to Lent, and our lady, is over, the business will be brought on again, and then shall we have fair play for our money. There is a gentleman of the first understanding, and a very good critic, who said of Mr. Wilks, that in this part he out-acted himself, and all men that he ever saw. I would not rob Mr. Wilks, by a worse expression of mine, of a compli ment that he so much deserves. 1 had almost forgot to tell you, that the turn of plot in the last act, is an adventure of Chevalier de Chastillon in Paris, and matter of fact ; but the thing is so universally known, that I think this advice might have been spared, as well as all the rest of the preface, for any good it will do either to me or the play.

MOTTEUX Like hungry guests, a sitting audience looks: Plays are like suppers : poets are the cooks. The founder's you : the table is this place : The carvers we : the prologue is the grace. Each act, a course ; each scene, a different dish. Though we're in Lent, I doubt you're still for flesh. Satire's the sauce, high-season'd, sharp, and rough : Kind masks and beaux, I hope you're pepper- proof? Wit is the wine ; but 'tis so scarce the true, Poets, like vintners, balderdash and brew. Your surly scenes, where rant and bloodshed join, Are butcher's meat, a battle's a sirloin. Your scenes of love, so flowing, soft, and chaste, Are water-gruel, without salt or taste. Bawdy's fat venison, which, though stale, can please : Your rakes love hauts-gosits, like your damn'd French cheese. Your rarity for the fair guest to gape on, Is your nice squeaker, or Italian capon : Or your French virgin-pullet, garnish'd round, And dress'd with sauce of some \u2014 four hundred pound. An opera, like an oglio, nicks the age ; Farce is the hasty-pudding of the stage. For when you're treated with indifferent cheer, Ye can dispense with slender stage-coach fare. A pastoral's whipp'd cream ; stage whims, mere trash ; And tragi-comedy, half fish half flesh. But comedy, that, that's the darling cheer. This night we hope you'll an Inconstant bear: Wild-fowl is liked in playhouse all the year. Yet since each mind betrays a different taste, And every dish scarce pleases every guest, If aught you relish, do not damn the rest. This favour craved, up let the music strike : You're welcome all. \u2014 Now fall to where you like. '"], [657, "THE WAY TO WIN HIM. SCENE I. 563 ACT I.

The very same, he went abroad ; he's the only Frenchman I ever knew that could not change. \u2014 Your son, Mr. Mirabel, is more obliged to nature for that fellow's composition than for his own ; for he's more happy in Duretete's folly than his own wit. In short, they are as inse parable as finger and thumb, but the first instance in the world, I believe, of opposition in friendship. Old Mir. Very well ; will he be home to dinner, think ye ? Dug. Sir, he has ordered me to bespeak a din ner for us at Rousseau's at a louis-d'or a head. Enter Dugard and Petit. Dug. Sirrah, what's o'clock ? Pet. Turned of eleven, sir. Dug. No more ! We have rid a swinging pace from Nemours since two this morning ! Petit, run to Rousseau's, and bespeak a dinner at a louis d'or a head, to be ready by one. Pet. How many will there be of you, sir ? Dug. Let me see ; Mirabel one, Duretete two ; myself three \u2014 Pet. And I four. Dug. How now, sir, at your old travelling fami liarity ! When abroad, you had some freedom for want of better company ; but among my friends at Paris pray remember your distance. \u2014 Begone, sir ! \u2014 [Exit Petit.] This fellow's wit was necessary abroad, but he's too cunning for a domestic ; I must dispose of him some way else. \u2014 Who's here? Old Mirabel, and my sister 1 Old Mir. A louis-d'or a head ! Well said, Bob ; by the blood of the Mirabels, Bob's improved. But, Mr. Dugard, was it so civil of Bob to visit mon sieur Rousseau before his own natural father ? eh ! \u2014 Heark'ee Oriana, what think you now, of a fel low that can eat and drink ye a whole louis-d'or at a sitting ? He must be as strong as Hercules ; life and spirit in abundance. Before Gad I don't won der at these men of quality, that their own wives can't serve 'em ! A louis-d'or a head ! \u2014 'tis enough to stock the whole nation with bastards, 'tis faith. \u2014 Mr. Dugard, I leave you with your sister. [Exit. Dug. Well, sister, I need not ask you how you do, your looks resolve me ; fair, tall, well-shaped ; you're almost grown out of my remembrance. Ori. Why, truly, brother, I look pretty well, thank nature and my toilet; I have 'scaped the jaundice, green-sickness, and the small-pox ; I eat three meals a day, and very merry when up, and sleep soundly when I'm down. Dug. But, sister, you remember that upon my going abroad you would choose this old gentleman for your guardian ; he's no more related to our family than Prester John, and I have no reason to think you mistrusted my management of your for tune, therefore pray be so kind as to tell me with out reservation the true cause of making such a choice. Enter Old Mirabe*. and Oriana. My dearest sister ! Ori. My brother 1 welcome ! Dug. Monsieur Mirabel ! I'm heartily glad to see you. Old Mir. Honest Mr. Dugard, by the blood of the Mirabels I'm your most humble servant. Dug. Why, sir, you cast your skin sure ! you're brisk and gay, lusty health about you, no sign of age but your silver hairs. Old Mir. Silver hairs ! then they are quicksilver hairs, sir. Whilst I have golden pockets, let my hairs be silver an they will. Adsbud, sir, I can dance, and sing, and drink, and \u2014 no, I can't wench. But, Mr. Dugard, no news of my son Bob in all your travels ? Dug. Your son's come home, sir. Old Mir. Come home ! Bob come home ? By the blood of the Mirabels, Mr. Dugard, what say ye? Ori. Mr. Mirabel returned, sir ? Dug. He's certainly come, and you may see him within this hour or two. Ori. Look'ee, brother, you were going a rambling, and 'twas proper lest I should go a rambling too, that somebody should take care of me. Old mon sieur Mirabel is an honest gentleman, was our father's friend, and has a young lady in his house, whose company I like, and who has chosen him for her guardian as well as I. Dug. Who, mademoiselle Bisarre ? Ori. The same ; we live merrily together, with out scandal or reproach ; we make much of the old gentleman between us, and he takes care of us ; we eat what we like, go to bed when we please, rise when we will, all the week we dance and sing, and upon Sundays go first to church and then to the play. Now, brother, besides these motives for choosing this gentleman for my guardian, perhaps had some private reasons. Duo Not so private as you imagine, sister; your love to young Mirabel ; no secret I can assure Old Mir. Swear it, Mr. Dugard, presently swear it. Dug. Sir, he came to town with me this morn ing, I left him at the bagnieur's, being a little dis ordered after riding, and I shall see him again presently. Old Mir. What ! and he was ashamed to ask blessing with his boots on ? A nice dog ! Well, and how fares the young rogue, ha ? Dug. A fine gentleman, sir. He'll be his own messenger. Old Mir. A fine gentleman ! But is the rogue like me still ? Dug. Why yes, sir ; he's very like his mother, and as like you as most modern sons are to their fathers. Old Mir. Why, sir, don't you think that I begat Dug. WThy yes, sir ; you married his mother,"], [658, "THE INCONSTANT; OR, 564 ACT I you, but so public that all your friends are ashamed on't. Dug. Come, sir, you shall serve my sister : I shall still continue kind to you, and if your lady recommends yonr diligence upon trial, I'll use my interest to advance you ; you have sense enough to expect preferment. Here, sirrah, here's ten guineas for thee, get thyself a drugget suit and a puff-wig, and so \u2014 I dub thee gentleman usher. \u2014 Sister, I must go put myself in repair, you may expect me in the evening. \u2014 Wait on your lady home, Petit. [Exit. Ori. O' my word then, my friends are very bash ful ; though I'm afraid, sir, that those people are not ashamed enough at their own crimes, who have so many blushes to spare for the faults of their neighbours. Dug. Ay, but sister, the people say \u2014 Ori. Psha, hang the people ! they'll talk treason, and profane their Maker ; must we therefore infer that our king is a tyrant, and religion a cheat? Look'ee, brother, their court of inquiry is a tavern, and their informer claret. They think as they drink, and swallow reputations iike loches : a lady's health goes briskly round with the glass, but her honour is lost in the toast. Pet. A chair ! a chair '. a chair ! [Calls. Ori. No, no, I'll walk home, 'tis but next door. [Exeunt. SCENE II A Tavern. Dug. Ay, but sister, there is still something \u2014 \u25a0 Ori. If there be something, brother, 'tis none of the people's something ; marriage is my thing, and I'll stick to't. Young Mirabel and Captain Duretete are discovered rising from table. Young Mir. Welcome to Paris once more, my dear captain ; we have eat heartily, drank roundly, paid plentifully, and let it go for once. I liked everything but our women, they looked so lean and tawdry, poor creatures I 'Tis a sure sign the army is not paid. \u2014 Give me the plump Venetian, brisk and sanguine, that smiles upon me like the glow ing sun, and meets my lips like sparkling wine, her person shining as the glass, and spirit like the foaming liquor. Dur. Ay, Mirabel, Italy I grant yon ; but for our women here in France, they are such thin, brawn-fallen jades, a man may as well make a bed fellow of a cane chair. Dug. Marriage ! young Mirabel marry '. he'll build churches sooner. Take heed, sister, though your honour stood proof to his home-bred assaults, you must keep a stricter guard for the future ; he has now got the foreign air and the Italian softness, his witTs improved by converse, his behaviour finished by observation, and his assurance con firmed by success. Sister, 1 can assure you he has made his conquests ; and 'tis a plague upon your sex, to be the soonest deceived by those very men that you know have been false to others. Ori. Then why will you tell me of his conquests ? for I must confess there is no title to a woman's favour so engaging as the repute of a handsome dissimulation. There is something of a pride to see a fellow lie at our feet, that has triumphed over so many ; and then, I don't know, we fancy he must have something extraordinary about him to please us, and that we have something engaging about us to secure him, so we can't be quiet, till we put our selves upon the lay of being both disappointed. Dug. But then, sister, he's as fickle \u2014 Ori. For Gad's sake, brother, tell me no more of his faults, for if you do I shall run mad for him. Say no more, sir, let me but get him into the bands of matrimony, I'll spoil his wandering, I'll warrant him. I'll do his business that way, never fear. Dug. Welt, sister, I won't pretend to understand the engagements between you and your lover ; I expect, when you have need of my counsel or assist ance, you will let me know more of your affairs. Mirabel is a gentleman, and as far as my honour and interest can reach, you may command me to the furtherance of your happiness. In the mean time, sister, I have a great mind to make you a pre sent of another humble servant ; a fellow I took up at Lyons, who has served me honestly ever since. Ori. Then why will you part with him ? Dug. He has gained so insufferably on my good-humour, that he's grown too familiar ; but the fellow's cunning, and may be serviceable to you in your affair with Mirabel. Here he comes. Young Mir. France! a light, unseasoned coun try, nothing but feathers, foppery, and fashions ; we're fine indeed, so are our coach-horses ; men say we're courtiers, men abuse us ; that we are wise and politic, non credo, signor: that our women have wit ; \u2014 parrots, mere parrots I \u2014 assurance and a good memory sets them up. \u2014 There's nothing on this side the Alps worth my humble service t'ye. \u2014 Ha ! Roma la Santa, Italy for my money ; their customs, gardens, buildings, paintings, music, policies, wine, and women ! the paradise of the world. \u2014 Not pestered with a parcel of precise, old gouty fellows, that would debar their children every pleasure that they themselves are past the sense of; commend me to the Italian familiarity \u2014 Here son ; there's fifty crowns, go pay your whore her week's allowance. Dur. Ay, these are your fathers for you, that understand the necessities of young men ; not like our musty dads who, because they cannot fish themselves, would muddy the water, and spoil the sport of them that can. But now you talk of the plump, what d'ye think of a Dutch woman 1 Young Mir. A Dutch woman ! \u2014 too compact, nay, everything among 'em is so ; a Dutch man is thick, a Dutch woman is squab, a Dutch horse is round, a Dutch dog is short, a Dutch ship is broad-bottomed ; and, in short, one would swear the whole products of the country were cast in the same mould with their cheeses. Re-enter PETrr. Dur. Ay, but, Mirabel, you have forgot the English ladies. Young Mir. The women of England were excel lent, did they not take such unsufferable pains to ruin what nature has made so incomparably well ; they would be delicate creatures indeed, could they but thoroughly arrive at the French mien, or entirely Well, sir, have you been at Rousseau's ? Pet. Yes, sir ; and who should I find there but Mr. Mirabel and the captain, hatching as warmly over a tub of ice as two hen-pheasants over a brood. \u2014 They would let me bespeak nothing, for they had dined before I came."], [659, "THE WAY TO WIN HIM.

But come, Duretete, let us mind the business in hand, mistresses we must have, and \u00bbnust take up with the manufacture of the place ; and, upon a competent diligence, we shall find those in Paris shall match the Italians from top to toe. Young Mir. Sir, I did but jest, here's ten pistoles. Old Mir. Why, then, here's ten more ; I love to be charitable to those that don't want it. \u2014 Well, and how d'ye like Italy, ray boys ? Young Mir. Oh, the garden of the world, sir ! Rome, Naples, Venice, Milan, and a thousand others \u2014 all fine. Old Mir. Ay, say you so '. And they say that Chiari is very fine too. Dur. Indifferent, sir, very indifferent: a very scurvy air, the most unwholesome to a French constitution in the world. Dur. Ay, Mirabel, you will do well enough, but what will become of your friend ; you know I am so plaguy bashful, so naturally an ass upon these occasions, that \u2014 Young Mir. Psha, nothing on't ! these rascally Gazetteers have misinformed you. Old Mir. Misinformed me ! Oons, sir, were not we beaten there ? Young Mir. Psha, you must be bolder, man !

[Imitates him.] No, hang it, 'twill never do 1 \u2014 Oons, what did my father mean by sticking me up in a university, or to think that I should gain anything by my head, in a nation whose genius lies all in their heels ! Well, if ever I come to have children of my own, they shall have the edu cation of the country, they shall learn to dance before they can walk, and be taught to sing before they speak. Young Mir. Come, come, throw off that child ish humour, put on assurance, there's no avoiding it ; stand all hazards, thou'rt a stout lusty fellow, and hast a good estate ; look bluff, Hector, you have a good side-box face, a pretty impudent face ; so, that's pretty well. \u2014 [Aside. ] This fellow went abroad like an ox, and is returned like an ass.

Confound ye both for a brace of cow ards ! here are no Germans to overhear you ; why don't ye tell me how it was ? Young Mir. Why, then, you must know, that we marched up a body of the finest, bravest, well dressed fellows in the universe : our commanders at the head of us, all lace and feather, like so many beaux at a ball. \u2014 I don't believe there was a man of 'em but could dance a Charmer, morbleu ! Old Mir. Dance ! very well, pretty fellows, faith ! Young Mir. We capered up to their very trenches, and there saw peeping over a parcel of scarecrow, olive-coloured, gunpowdered fellows, as ugly as the devil. Dur. Egad, I shall never forget the looks of 'em while I have breath to fetch. Young Mir. They were so civil indeed as to welcome us with their cannon ; but, for the rest, we found 'em such unmannerly, rude, unsociable dogs, that we grew tired of their company, and so we e'en danced back again. Old Mir. And did ye all come back ? Young Mir. No, two or three thousand of us stayed behind. Old Mir. Why, Bob, why ? Young Mir. Psha ! \u2014 because they could not come that night. \u2014But, come, sir, we were talking of something else ; pray how does your lovely charge, the fair Oriana ? Old Mir.

Well, I an't the first son that has made his father's dwelling a bandy- house \u2014 let me see. Bis. Um ! \u2014 before that any young, lying, swear ing, flattering, rakehelly fellow, should play such tricks with me, I would wear my teeth to the stumps with lime and chalk. Oh, the devil take all your Cassandras and Cleopatras for me. \u2014 Pri thee mind your airs, modes, and fashions ; your stays, gowns, and furbelows. Hark'ee, my dear, have you got home your furbelowed smocks yet ? Ori. Prithee be quiet, Bisarre ; you know I can be as mad as you, when this Mirabel is out of my head. Old Mir. Well, which d'ye like ? Young Mir. Both. Old Mir. But which will you marry ? Young Mir. Neither. Gld Mir. Neither ! Don't make me angry now, Bob ; pray don't make me angry. Look'ee, sirrah, if I don't dance at your wedding to-morrow, I shall be very glad to cry at your grave. Young Mir. That's a bull, father. Old Mir. A bull ! why, how now, ungrateful sir, did I make thee a man, that thou shouldst make me a beast ? Bis. Psha ! would he were out, or in, or some way to make you easy.- \u2014 I warrant now you'll play the fool when he comes, and say you love him ; eh ? Ori. Most certainly ; I can't dissemble, Bis arre. \u2014 Besides, 'tis past that, we're contracted. Bis. Contracted ! a-lack-a-day, poor thing ! What, you have changed rings, or broken an old broad-piece between you ! Hark'ee, child, han't you broke something else between ye ? Ori. No, no, I can assure you. Bis. Then, what d'ye whine for ? Whilst I kept that in my power, I would make a fool of any fel low in France. Well, I must confess, I do love a little coquetting with all my heart ; my business should be to break gold with my lover one hour, and crack my promise the next ; he should find me one day with a prayer-book in my hand, and with a play-book another. He should have my consent to buy the wedding-ring, and the next moment would I laugh in his face. Ori. Oh, my dear, were there no greater tie upon my heart, than there is upon my conscience, I would soon throw the contract out a-doors ; but the mischief on't is, I am so fond of being tied, that I'm forced to be just, and the strength of my passion keeps down the inclination of my sex. \u2014 But here's the old gentleman. Young Mir. Your pardon, sir, I only meant your expression. Old Mir. Heark'ee, Bob, learn better manners to your father before strangers : I won't be angry this time, \u2014 but oons, if ever you do't again, you rascal ; remember what I say. [Exit. Young Mir. Psha ! what does the old fellow mean by mewing me up here with a couple of green girls ! \u2014 Come, Duretete, will you go ? Ori. I hope, Mr. Mirabel, you han't forgot \u2014 Young Mir. No, no, madam, I han't forgot, I have broughtyouathousandlittleltalian curiosities; I'll assure you, madam, as far as a hundred pistoles would reach, I han't forgot the least circumstance. Ori, Sir, you misunderstand me. Young Alir. Odso, the relics, madam, from Rome. I do remember now you made a vow of chastity before my departure ; a vow of chastity, or something like it ; was it not, madam ? Ori. O sir, I'm answered at present. [Exit. Young Mir. She was coming full mouth upon me with her contract. \u2014 Would I might despatch the t'other ! [Aside. Enter Old Mirabel. Old Mir. Where's my wenches ? where's my two little girls ? Eh ! have a care, look to your selves, faith, they're a-coming, the travellers are a-coming. Well, which of you two will be my daughter-in-law now ? Bisarre, Bisarre, what say you, madcap ? Mirabel is a pure wild fellow. Bis. I like him the worse. Dur. Mirabel, \u2014 that lady there, observe her, she's wondrous pretty faith, and seems to have but few words ; I like her mainly : speak to her, man, prithee speak to her. [Aside to Mirabel Young Mir. Madam, here's a gentleman, who declares \u2014 Dur. Madam, don't believe him, I declare nothing. \u2014 What the devil do you mean, man i Young Alir. He says, madam, that you are beautiful as an angel. Dur. He tells a damned lie, madam ; I say no such thing Are you mad, Mirabel ? why, I shall drop down with shame. Young Mir. And so, madam, not doubting but Old Mir. You lie, honey, you like him the bet ter, indeed you do. \u2014 What say you, my t'other little filbert, eh ! Ori. I suppose the gentleman will choose for himself, sir. Old Mir. Why, that's discreetly said ; and so he shall."], [661, "THE WAY TO WIN HIM. SCENE 1. 567 your ladyship may like him as well as he does you, I think it proper to leave you together. [Going. Dur. Hold, hold ! \u2014 Why Mirabel, friend, sure you won't be so barbarous as to leave me alone ! Prithee speak to her for yourself, as it were. Lord, Lord, that a Frenchman should want impudence ! Young Mir. You look mighty demure, madam ! . She's deaf, captain. Dur. I had much rather have her dumb. Re-enter Oriana. Well, madam, why d'ye follow me ? Ori. Well, sir, why do you shun me ? Young Mir. 'Tis my humour, madam, and I am naturally swayed by inclination. Ori. Have you forgot our contract, sir? Young Mir. All I remember of that contract is, that it was made some three years ago, and that's enough in conscience to forget the rest on't. Ort. 'Tis sufficient, sir, to recollect the passing of it, for in that circumstance, I presume, lies the force of the obligation. Young Mir. Obligations, madam, that are forced upon the will are no tie upon the conscience; I was a slave to my passion when I passed the instru ment, but the recovery of my freedom makes the contract void. Young Mir. The gravity of your air, madam, promises some extraordinary fruits from your study, which moves us with a curiosity to inquire the subject of your ladyship's contemplation. \u2014 Not a word ! Dur. I hope in the Lord she's speechless ; if she be, she's mine this moment. \u2014 Mirabel, d'ye think a woman's silence can be natural ? Ori. Sir, you can't make that a compulsion which was your own choice. Besides, sir, a sub jection to your own desires has not the virtue of a forcible constraint : and you will find, sir, that to plead your passion for the killing of a man will hardly exempt you from the justice of the punish ment. Bis. But the forms that logicians introduce, and which proceed from simple enumeration, are dubit able, and proceed only upon admittance \u2014 Young Mir. Hoyty toyty ! what a plague have we here ? Plato in petticoats 1 Dur. Ay, ay, let her go on, man ; she talks in my own mother-tongue. Bis. 'Tis exposed to invalidity from a contra dictory instance, looks only upon common opera tions, and is infinite in its termination. Young Alir. And so, madam, you make the sin of murder and the crime of a contract the very same, because that hanging and matrimony are so much alike ? Young Mir. Rare pedantry! Dur. Axioms ! axioms ! self-evident principles ! Bis. Then the ideas wherewith the mind is pre occupate \u2014 O gentlemen, I hope you'll pardon my cogitation ; I was involved in a profound point of philosophy ; but I shall discuss it somewhere else, being satisfied that the subject is not agreeable to you sparks, that profess the vanity of the times. [Exit. Ori. Come, Mr. Mirabel, these expressions I expected from the raillery of your humour, but I hope for very different sentiments from your honour and generosity. Young Mir. Look'ee, madam, as for my gene rosity, 'tis at your service, with all my heart : I'll keep you a coach and six horses, if you please, only permit me to keep my honour to myself; for I can assure you, madam, that the thing called honour is a circumstance absolutely unnecessary in a natural correspondence between male and female, and he's a madman that lays it out, con sidering its scarcity, upon any such trivial occa sions. There's honour required of us by our friends, and honour due to our enemies, and they return it to us again ; but I never heard of a man that left but an iuch of his honour in a woman's keeping, that could ever get the least account on't. Consider, madam, you have no such thing among ye, and 'tis a main point of policy to keep no faith with reprobates : thou art a pretty little reprobate, and so get thee about thy business. Ori. Well, sir, even all this I will allow to the gaiety of your temper ; your travels have improved your talent of talking, but they are not of force, I hope, to impair your morals. Young Mir. Morals ! why there 'tis again now. I tell thee, child, there is not the least occasion for morals in any business between you and I. Don't you know that of all commerce in the world there is no such cozenage and deceit as in the traffic between man and woman ; we study all our lives long how to put tricks upon one another. W7hat is your business now, from the time you throw away your artificial babies, but how to get natural ones with the most advantage ? No fowler lays abroad more nets for his game, nor a hunter for his prey, than you do to catch poor innocent men. Why do you sit three or four hours at your toilet in a morning ? Only with a villanous design to make some poor fellow a fool before night. What are your languishing looks, your studied airs and Young Mir. Go thy way, goodwife Bias. Do you hear, Duretete ? dost hear this starched piece of austerity ? Dur. She's mine, man ; she's mine : my own talent to a T. I'll match her in dialectics, faith. I was seven years at the university, man ; nursed up with Barbara, Celarunt, Darii, Ferio, Bara lipton. Did you never know, man, that 'twas metaphysics made me an ass ? it was, faith. Had she talked a word of singing, dancing, plays, fash ions, or the like, I bad foundered in the first step ; hut as she is \u2014 Mirabel, wish me joy. Young Alir. You don't mean marriage, I hope? Dur. No, no, I'm a man of more honour. Young Alir. Bravely resolved, captain ! Now for thy credit, warm me this frozen snow-ball, 'twill be a conquest above the Alps. Dur. But will you promise to be always near me ? Young Mir. Upon all occasions, never fear. Dur. Why then, you shall see me in two mo ments make an induction from my love to her hand, from her hand to her mouth, from her mouth to her heart, and so conclude in her bed, categori matice. [Exit. Young Alir. Now the game begins, and my fool is entered. \u2014 But here comes one to spoil my sport ; now shall I be teased to death with this old-fashioned contract.

What d'ye sigh for ? what d'ye weep for ? what d'ye pray for ? Why for a husband : that is, you implore Providence to assist you in the just and pious design of making the wisest of his creatures a fool, and the head of the creation a slave. Young Mir. Your face-mending toilet shall fly out of the window. Ori. And your face-mending periwig shall fly after it. Young Mir. I'll tear the furbelow off your clothes, and when you swoon for vexation, you shan't have a penny to buy a bottle of hartshorn. Ori. And you, sir, shall have hartshorn in abuc dance. Ori. Sir, I am proud of my power, and am re solved to use it. Young Afir. Hold, hold, madam ! not so fast. \u2014 As you have variety of vanities to make coxcombs of us ; so we have vows, oaths, and protestations, of all sorts and sizes, to make fools of you. As you are very strange and whimsical creatures, so we are allowed as unaccountable ways of managing you. And this, in short, my dear creature, is our present condition ; I have sworn and lied briskly to gain my ends of you, your ladyship has patched and painted violently to gain your ends of me : but, since we are both disappointed, let us make a drawn battle, and part clear of both sides. Ori. With all my heart, sir ; give me up my contract, and I'll never see your face again. Young Alir. Indeed I won't, child. Ori. What, sir, neither do one nor t'other ? Young Alir. I'll keep as many mistresses as I have coach-horses. Ori. And I'll keep as many gallants as you have grooms. Young Alir. I'll lie with your woman before your face. Ori. Have a care of your valet behind your back. Young Mir. But, sweet madam, there is such a thing as a divorce. Ori. But, sweet sir, there is such a thing as alimony : so divorce on, and spare not. [Exit. Young Alir. Ay, that separate maintenance is the devil : there's their refuge. O' my conscience, one would take cuckoldom for a meritorious action, because the women are so handsomely rewarded for't. [Exit. Young Alir. No, you shall die a maid, unless you please to be otherwise upon my terms. Ori. What do you intend by this, sir ? Young Mir. Why, to starve you into compliance. Look'ee, you shall never marry any man ; and you had as good let me do you a kindness as a stranger. Ori. Sir, you're a \u2014 Young Alir. What am I, mistress ? Ori.

O sir, she has a tongue as long as my leg, and talks so crabbedly, you would think she al ways spoke Welsh ! Dur. That's an odd language, methinks, for her philosophy. Pet. But sometimes she will sit you half a day without speaking a word, and talk oracles all the while by the wrinkles of her forehead, and tbe motions of her eyebrows. Dur. Nay, I shall match her in philosophical ogles, faith ; that's my talent : I can talk best, you must know, when I say nothing. Pet. But d'ye ever laugh, sir ? Dur. Laugh! won't she endure laughing? Pet. Why she's a critic, sir ; she hates a jest, for fear it should please her ; and nothing keeps her in humour but what gives her the spleen. And then for logic, and all that, you know \u2014 Dur. Ay, ay, I'm prepared, I have been prac tising hard words, and no sense, this hour, to entertain her. Young Alir. I'm glad on't. I never knew an honest fellow in my life but was a villain upon these occasions. Han't you drawn yourself now into a very pretty dilemma ? Ha ! ha ! ha ! the poor lady has made a vow of virginity, when she thought of making a vow for the contrary. Was ever poor woman so cheated into chastity ? Ori. Sir, my fortune is equal to yours, my friends as powerful, and both shall be put to the test, to do me justice. Young Alir. What ! you'll force me to marry you, will ye ? Ori. Sir, the law shall. Young Mir. But the law can't force me to do anything else, can it ? Ori. Psha, I despise thee, \u2014 monster ! Young Alir. Kiss and be friends then. Don't cry, child, and you shall have your sugar-plum. Come, madam, d'ye think I could be so unreason able as to make ye fast all your life long ? No, I did but jest, you 6hall have your liberty ; here, take your contract, and give me mine. Ori. No, I won't. Pet.

Why, she sighs for thee, and cries for thee, pouts for thee, and snubs for thee, the poor little heart of it is like to burst.

Hear you speak, sir ! if you had ten thousand tongues, you could not outtalk ten thou sand pound, sir. Young Mir. Nay, sir, if you won't hear me I'll begone, sir ! I'll take post for Italy this moment. Old Mir. Ah ! the fellow knows I won't part with him. W7ell, sir, what have you to say ? Young Mir. The universal reception, sir, that marriage has had in the world, is enough to fix it for a public good, and to draw everybody into the common cause ; but there are some constitutions, like some instruments, so peculiarly singular, that they make tolerable music by themselves, but never do well in a consort. Old Mir. Look'ee, friend, you may persuade me out of my designs, but I'll command you out of yours ; and though you may convince my reason that you're in the right, yet there is an old attend ant of sixty-three, called positiveness, which you nor all the wits in Italy shall ever be able to shake; so, sir, you're a wit, and I'm a father; you may talk, but I'll be obeyed. Young Alir.

I have swallowed my words already ; I have eaten them up, and how can you come at 'em, sir? Dag. Very easily, sir : 'tis but mentioning your injured ward, and you will throw them up again immediately. Old Mir. Sir, your sister was a foolish young flirt to trust any such young, deceitful, rakehelly rogue, like him. Dug. Cry you mercy, old gentleman! I thought we should have the words again. Old Alir. And what then ? 'Tis the way with young fellows to slight old gentlemen's words, you never mind 'em when you ought. \u2014 I say, that Bob's an honest fellow, and who dares deny it ? Old Mir. Why this is reason, I must confess, but yet 'tis nonsense too ; for though you should reason like an angel, if you argue yourself out of a good estate you talk like a fool. Young Alir. But, sir, if you bribe me into bond age with the riches of Cr\u0153sus, you leave me but a beggar for want of my liberty. Old Alir. Was ever such a perverse fool heard !

A fellow that has nothing left to re-establish him for a human creature, but a prudent resolution to hang himself. Young Mir. There is a way, madam, to force me to that resolution. Old Mir. Look'ee, Mr. Dugard, good words go farthest. I will do your sister justice, but it must be after my own rate, nobody must abuse my son but myself. For although Robin be a sad dog, yet he's nobody's puppy but my own. Bis. Ay, that's my sweet- natured, kind old gen tleman.\u2014 [Wheedling him.] We will be good then, if you'll join with us in the plot. Old Mir. Ah, you coaxing young baggage, what plot can you have to wheedle a fellow of sixty-three ? Bis. A plot that sixty-three is only good for, to bring other people together, sir ; and you must act the Spaniard, 'cause your son will least suspect you ; and if he should, your authority protects yon from a quarrel, to which Oriana is unwilling to expose her brother. Old Alir. And what part will you act in the bu siness, madam ? Bis. I'll do't with all my heart. Young Mir. Then you must marry me. Bis. Look'ee, sir, don't think your ill manners to me shall excuse your ill usage of my friend ; nor by fixing a quarrel here, to divert my zeal for the absent : for I'm resolved, nay 1 come prepared, to make you a panegyric that shall mortify your pride like any modern dedication. Young Alir. And I, madam, like a true modern patron, shall hardly give you thanks for your trouble. Bis. Come, sir, to let you see what little foun dation you have for your dear sufficiency, I'll take you to pieces. Young Mir. And what piece will you choose ? Bis. Your heart, to be sure ; 'cause I should get presently rid on't ; your courage I would give to a Hector, your wit to a lewd playmaker, your honour to an attorney, your body to the physicians, and your soul to its master. Young Mir. I had the oddest dream last night of the duchess of Burgundy ! methought the fur belows of her gown were pinned up so high behind, that I could not see her head for her tail. Bis. Myself, sir ; my friend is grown a perfect changeling : these foolish hearts of ours spoil our heads presently ; the fellows no sooner turn knaves but we turn fools. But I am still myself, and he may expect the most severe usage from me, 'cause I neither love him nor hate him. [Exit. Old Mir. Well said, Mrs. Paradox. \u2014 But, sir, who must open the matter to him ? Dug. Petit, sir, who is our engineer general. And here he comes. Bis. The creature don't mind me ! \u2014 [Here Mirabel pulls out a book and reads to himself while she speaks.] Do you think, sir, that your humorous impertinence can divert me ? No, sir, I'm above any pleasure that you can give, but that of seeing you miserable. And mark me, air ; my friend, my injured friend, shall yet be doubly happy, and you shall be a husband as much as the rites of marriage, and the breach of 'em, can make you. Young Mir.

Very much, madam, the most apropos in the world \u2014 for, what should I chop upon, but the very place where the perjured rogue of a lover and the forsaken lady are battling it tooth and nail. Come, madam, spend your spirits no longer, we'll take an easier method : I'll be \u00c6neas now, and you shall be Dido, and we'll rail by book. Now for you, madam Dido. Nee te nosier amor, nee tedala dextera quondam, Nee moritura tenet crudeli funere Dido \u2014 Ah, poor Dido ! [Looking at her. Bis. Rudeness ! affronts ! impatience !

That I have \u2014 [Pants and blows.] bribed, sir, bribed \u2014 your son's secretary of state. Old Alir. Secretary of state ! who's that, for Heaven's sake ? Pet. His valet-de-chambre, sir. You must know, sir, that the intrigue lay folded up with his master's clothes, and when he went to dust the embroidered suit, the secret flew out of the right pocket of his coat, in a whole swarm of your crambo songs, short-footed odes, and long-legged pindarics. Old Alir. Impossible ! Pet. Ah, sir, he has loved her all along ; there was Oriana in every line, but he hates marriage. Now, sir, this plot will stir up his jealousy, and we shall know by the strength of that how to proceed farther. Come, sir, let's about it with speed. 'Tis expedition gives our king the sway ; For expedition too the French give way ; Swift to attack, or swift to run away. [Exeunt. \u2666 \u2014 - SCENE II. \u2014 The same.

Old Alir. Ay, and your lover may be wounded, that's another thing. But I think you're pretty brisk again, my child. Ori. Ay, sir, my indisposition was only a pre tence to divert the quarrel ; the capricious taste of your sex excuses this artifice in ours. For often, when our chief perfections fail, Our chief defects with foolish men prevail. [Exit. Pel. Come, Mr. Dugard, take courage, there is a way still left to fetch him again. Old Mir. Sir, I'll have no plot that has any relation to Spain. Dug. I scorn all artifice whatsoever ; my sword shall do her justice. Pet. Pretty justice, truly ! Suppose you run him through the body ; you run her through the heart at the same time. Old Alir. Well, well, I am not your father. Young Alir.

Old Mirabel and Dugard discovered. Dug. The lady abbess is my relation, and privy to the plot. Your son has been there, but had no admittance beyond the privilege of the grate, and there my sister refused to see him. He went off more nettled at his repulse than I thought his gaiety could admit. Old Mir. Ay, ay, this nunnery will bring him about, I warrant ye. Dur. Settled it upon the church, sir. Old Mir. The church ! nay, then the devil won't get him out of their clutches.\u2014 Ten thousand livres a year upon the church !

Is your sister gone to the Filles Repentiesf I tell you, sir, she's not fit for the society of re penting maids. Dug. Why so, sir? Dur. Because she's neither one nor t'other; she's too old to be a maid, and too young to repent. [Exit, Dugard following him. Dur. Here, where are ye all? \u2014 O Mr. Mirabel, you have done fine things for your posterity ! \u2014 And you, Mr. Dugard, may come to answer this. \u2014 I come to demand my friend at your hands ; restore him, sir, or \u2014 [To Old Mirabel.

Bob turned friar ! \u2014 Why should the fellow shave his foolish crown when the same razor may cut his throat ? Dur. If you have any command, or you any interest over him, lose not a minute !

Save you, sister !\u2014 Youi brother, young lady, having a regard to your soul's health, has sent me to prepare you for that sacred habit by confession. Ori. But don't you think there is a great deal of merit, in dedicating a beautiful face and person to the service of religion ? Bis. Not half so much as devoting 'em to a pretty fellow. If our feminalityhad no business in this world, why was it sent hither? Let us dedi cate our beautiful minds to the service of Heaven. And for our handsome persons, they become a box at the play, as well as a pew in the church. Ori. But the vicissitudes of fortune, the incon stancy of man, with other disappointments of life, require some place of religion, for a refuge from their persecution. Bis. Ha ! ha ! ha ! and do you think there is any devotion in a fellow's going to church, when he takes it only for a sanctuary ? Don't you know, that religion consists in a charity with all mankind ; and that you should never think of being friends with Heaven, till you have quarrelled with all the world ? Come, come, mind your business ; Mirabel loves you 'tis now plain, and hold him to't : give fresh orders that he shan't see you. We get more by hiding our faces sometimes than by exposing them ; a very mask, you see, whets desire, but a pair of keen eyes through an iron gate, fire double upon 'em, with view and disguise. But I must be gone upon my affairs, I have brought my captain about again. Ori. But why will you trouble yourself with that coxcomb ? Ori. [Aside.] That's false ; the cloven foot already.\u2014 [Aloud.] My brother's care I own ; and to you, sacred sir, I confess, that the great crying sin which I have long indulged, and now prepare to expiate, was love. My morning thoughts, my evening prayers, my daily musings, nightly cares, was love ! My present peace, my future bliss, the joys of earth, and hopes of heaven, I all contemned for love ! Young Mir. [Aside.] She's downright stark mad in earnest; death and confusion, I have lost her ! \u2014 [Aloud] You confess your fault, madam, in such moving terms, that I could almost be in love with the sin. Ori. Take care, sir; crimes, like virtues, are their own rewards ; my chief delight became my only grief; he in whose breast I thought my heart secure turned robber, and despoiled the treasure that he kept. Young Mir. Perhaps that treasure he esteems so much, that like a miser, though afraid to use it, ne reserves it safe. Ori. No, holy father : who can be miser in another's wealth that's prodigal of his own? His heart was open, shared to all he knew, and what, alas ! must then become of mine ? But the same eyes that drew the passion in, shall send it out in tears, to which now hear my vow. \u2014 Young Alir. [Discovering himself] No, my fair angel, but let me repent ; here on his knees behold the criminal, that vows repentance his. \u2014 [Aside.] Ha! no concern upon her ! Ori. This turn is odd, and the time has been, that such a sudden change would have surprised me into some confusion. Bis. Because he is a coxcomb ; had not I better have a lover like him, that I can make an ass, than a lover like yours, to make a fool of me. \u2014 [Knock ing below.] A message from Mirabel, I'll lay my life [Runs to the door.] Come hither, run, thou charming nun, come hither.

Ori. Grovelling, sordid man ! why would you act a thing to make you kneel, monarch in pleasure to be slave to your faults ? Are all the conquests of your wandering sway, your wit, your humour, fortune, all reduced to the base cringing of a bended knee? Servile and poor ! I' \u2014 [Aside] love it. Young Alir. I come not here to justify my fault but my submission, for though there be a meanDess in this humble posture, 'tis nobler still to bend when justice calls, than to resist conviction. Ori. No more ! thy off-repeated violated words reproach my weak belief, 'tis the severest calumny to hear thee speak ; that humble posture which once could raise, now mortifies my pride. How canst thou hope for pardon from one that you affront by asking it ? Young Mir. [Rises.] In my own cause no more, but give me leave to intercede for you against the hard injunctions of that habit which for my fault you wear. Bis. Don't you see who's below ? Ori. I see nobody but a friar. Bis. Ah ! thou poor blind Cupid ! O' my con science, these hearts of ours spoil our heads in stantly ; the fellows no sooner turn knaves, than we turn fools. A friar ! don't you see a villanous genteel mien under that cloak of hypocrisy, the loose careless air of a tall rakehelly fellow ? Ori. As I live, Mirabel turned friar 1 I hope, in Heaven, he's not in earnest. Bis. In earnest ! ha ! ha ! ha ! are you in earnest ? Now's your time ; this disguise has he certainly taken for a passport, to get in and try your resolutions ; stick to your habit to be sure ; treat him with disdain, rather than anger ; for pride becomes us more than passion.

The cunning gamesters never gain too fast, But lose at first, to win the more at last. [Exit. Ori. His coming puts me into some ambiguity, I don't know how; I don't fear him, but I mistrust myself. Would he were not come ; yet I would not have him gone neither ; I'm afraid to talk with him, but I love to see him though. What a strange power has this fantastic fire, That makes us dread even what we most desire ! Ori. Surprising insolence ! My greatest foe pre tends to give me counsel; but I am too warm upon so cool a subject.

Look'ee, my dear counterfeiting nun, take my advice, be a nun in good earnest ; women make the best nuns always when they can't do other wise. \u2014 Ah, my dear father, there is a merit in your son's behaviour that you little think ; the free deportment of such fellows as I, makes more ladies religious, than all the pulpits in France. Ori. O sir, how unhappily have you destroyed what was so near perfection ! He is the counter feit that has deceived you. Old Alir. Ha ! Look'ee, sir, I recant, she is a nun. Bis. Perhaps I do not.

Where her young in nocence expected protection, here has she found her ruin. 2 Lady. A man ! we're mistaken, a man has manners ; the awkward creature is some tinker's trull in a periwig. Old Alir. Ay, the fault is mine, for I believe that rogue won't marry, for fear of begetting such a dis obedient son as his father did. I have done all I can, madam, and now can do no more than run mad for company. [Cries. Bis. Come, ladies, let's examine him. [They lag hold on him. Dur. Examine ! the devil you will ! Bis.

If you please to let me get away with my honour, I'd do anything in the world. Bis. Will you persuade your friend to marry mine ? Enter Dugard, with his sword drawn. Dug. Away ! Revenge ! revenge !

Patience ! the coward's virtue, and the brave man's failing, when thus provoked. \u2014 Villain ! Young Alir. Your sister' s frenzy shall excuse your madness ; and show my concern for what she suffers ; I'll bear the villain from her brother. Put up your anger with your sword ; I have a heart like yours, that swells at an affront received, but melts at an injury given ; and if the lovely Oriana's grief be such a moving scene, 'twill find a part within this breast, perhaps as tender as a brother's. Dug. To prove that soft compassion for her grief, endeavour to remove it. Dur. O yes, to be sure. Bis. And will you do the same by me ? Dur. Burn me if I do, if the coast be clear ! [Runs out. Bis.

Would my father have his youth ful son lie lazing here, bound to a wife, chained like a monkey to make sport to a woman, subject to her whims, humours, longings, vapours, and caprices ; to have her one day pleased, to-morrow peevish, the next day mad, the fourth rebellious ; and no thing but this succession of impertinence for ages together ?

Young Alir. My very soul is touched ! \u2014 Your hand, my fair. Ori. How soft and gentle you feel I\u2014 I'll tell you your fortune, friend. Young Alir. How she stares upon me ! PP Young Alir. Then you think that marriage, like treason, should attaint the whole blood ? Pray consider, sir, is it reasonable because you throw yourself down from one story, that I must cast my self headlong from the garret window ? You would compel me to that state, which I have heard you curse yourself, when my mother and you have battled it for a whole week together. Old Mir. Never but once, you rogue ! and that was when she longed for six Flanders mares.

First, let me bless the cunning of my sex, that happy counterfeited frenzy, that has restored to my poor labouring breast the dearest, best beloved of men ! Young Mir. Tune all ye spheres your instru- ments of joy, And carry round your spacious orbs The happy sound of Oriana's health ; Her soul, whose harmony was next to yours, Is now in tune again : The counterfeiting fair has play'd the fool.

Bless us, was she possessed ? Young Alir. With the worst of demons, sir,\u2014 a marriage-devil, a horrid devil! \u2014 Mr. Dugard, don't be surprised ; I promised my endeavours to cure your sister. No mad-doctor in Christendom could have done it more effectually. Take her into your charge, and have a care she don't relapse. If she should, employ me not again ; for I am no more infallible than others of the faculty ; I do cure sometimes. Enter Captain Duretete. Dur. Where are you all ? \u2014 What the devil ! melancholy, and I here ! Are ye sad, and such a ridiculous subject, such a very good jest among ye, as I am ? Young Mir. Away with this impertinence ! this is no place for bagatelle. I have murdered my honour, destroyed a lady, and my desire of repara tion is come at length too late. See there ! Dur. What ails her ? Ori. Your remedy, most barbarous man, will prove the greatest poison to my health ; for though my former frenzy was but counterfeit, I now shall run into a real madness. Young Mir. Alas ! she's mad.

Heavens further it ; for till they be cold as a key, there's no trusting them. You're never sure that a woman's in earnest till she be nailed in her coffin. Shall I talk to her? \u2014 Are you mad, mistress ? Re-enter Captain Duretete.

Oons, madam ! are you there ? [Runs off. Young Mir. Away, thou wild buffoon ! How poor and mean this humour now appears !

What, pretend a command over me, after his settlement of a thousand pound a year upon me ! No, no, he has passed away his authority with the conveyance ; the will of a living father is chiefly obeyed for sake of the dying one. What makes the worldattendand crowd the great ? Hopes, interest, and dependence, make their state. Behold the antechamber fill'd with beaux, A horse's levee throng'd with courtly crows.

You may remember what narrow 'scapes you have had abroad by following strangers : you forget your leap out of the courtesan's window at Bologna to save your fine ring there. Young Mir. My ring's a trifle ; there's nothing we possess comparable to what we desire. Be shy of a lad j barefaced in the front box with a thousand pound in jewels about her neck ! for shame, no more ! Enter Young Mirabel and Captain Duretete as from the play. Dur. How d'ye like this play ? Young Alir. I liked the company ; the lady, the rich beauty in the front-box, had my attention. These impudent poets bring the ladies together to support them, and to kill everybody else. For death's upon the stage, the ladies cry, But ne'er mind us that in the audience die : Enter Oriana, dressed as a Page, with a letter. The poet's hero should not move their pain. But they should weep for those their eyes have slain. Ori. Is your name Mirabel, sir ? Young Mir. Yes, sir. Ori. A letter from your uncle in Picardy. [Gives the letter. Young Mir. [Reads.] The bearer is the son of a Protestant gentleman, ivho flying for his religion, left me the charge of this youth. \u2014 A pretty boy ! \u2014 He's fond of some handsome service that may afford him opportunity of improvement, your care of him will oblige \u2014 Yours \u2014 Hast a mind to travel, child ? Dur. Hoity, toity ! did Phillis inspire you with all this ? Young Alir. Ten times more ! the playhouse is the element of poetry, because the region of beauty. The ladies, methinks, have a more inspiring tri umphant air in the boxes than anywhere else ; they sit commanding on their thrones with all their sub ject-slaves about them. Their best clothes, best looks, shining jewels, sparkling eyes, the treasure of the world in a ring. Then there's such a hurry of pleasure to transport us ; the bustle, noise, gal lantry, equipage, garters, feathers, wigs, bows, smiles, ogles, love, music, and applause. I could wish that my whole life-long were the first night of a new play ! Dur. The fellow has quite forgot this journey ! \u2014 Have you bespoke post-horses? Young Alir. Grant me but three days, dear captain : one to discover the lady, one to unfold myself, and one to make me happy ; and then I'm yours to the world's end. Dur. Hast thou the impudence to promise thy self a lady of her figure and quality in so short a time ? Ori. 'Tis my desire, sir ; I should be pleased to serve a traveller in any capacity. Young Mir. A hopeful inclination ! You shall along with me into Italy, as my page. Dur. I don't think it safe ; the rogue's too handsome. \u2014 [Noise without.] The play's done, and some of the ladies come this way. Enter Lamorce, her train borne up by a Page. Young Alir.

Then ! why \u2014 [To Oriana.] Look'ee, sirrah, the first piece of service I put you upon, is to follow that lady's coach, and bring me word where she lives. Ori. I don't know the town, sir, and am afraid of losing myself. Young Mir. Yes, sir ; I have a confident address, no disagreeable person, and five hundred louis-d'ors in my pocket. Dztr. Five hundred louis-d'ors ! you an't mad ! Young Alir. I tell you, she's worth five thou sand ; one of her black brilliant eyes is worth a diamond as big as her head. I compared her necklace with her looks, and the living jewels out sparkled the dead ones by a million. Young Afir. Psha ! Lam. Page, what's become of all my people ? Page. I can't tell, madam, I can see no sign of your ladyship's coach. Lam. That fellow is got into his old pranks, and fallen drunk somewhere: none of the footmen there? Dur. But you have owned to me, that abating Oriana's pretensions to marriage, you loved her passionately, then how can you wander at this rate? Young Alir. I longed for a partridge t'other day off the king's plate, but dy'e think, because I could not have it, I must eat nothing ? Page. Not one, madam. Lam.

I should be sorry if you made any sinister constructions of my freedom. Young Mir. O madam, I must not pretend to remark upon anybody's freedom, having so entirely forfeited my own. Lam. Well, sir, 'twere convenient towards our easy correspondence, that we entered into a free confidence of each other, by a mutual declaration of what we are, and what we think of one another. Now, sir, what are you? Young Mir. [To Captain Duretete.] Rude beast, be quiet! \u2014 [To Lamorce.] The farther from home, madam, the more occasion you have for guard \u2014 Pray, madam \u2014 Lam.

My name is Lamorce ; my birth noble ; I was married young, to a proud, rude, sullen, im perious fellow ; the husband spoiled the gentleman; crying ruined my face, till at last I took heart, leaped out of a window, got away to my friends, sued my tyrant, and recovered my fortune. I lived from fifteen to twenty to please a husband, from twenty to forty I'm resolved to please myself, and from thence upwards I'll humour the world. Young Mir. The charming wild notes of a bird broke out of its cage ! Lam. I marked you at the play, and something I saw of a well-furnished, careless, agreeable tour about you.

Why, how now, Tages, do you start up to give laws of a sudden? do you pretend to rise at court, and disapprove the pleasures of your betters ? Look'ee, sirrah, if ever you would rise by a great man, be sure to be with him in his little actions ; and, as a step to your advancement, follow your master immediately, and make it your hope that he go to a bawdy-house.

EPILOGUE, BY NATHANIEL ROWE SPOKEN BY MR. WILKS. From Fletcher's great original, to-day We took the hint of this our modern play : Our author, from his lines, has strove to paint A witty, wild, inconstant, free gallant, With a gay soul, with sense, and will to rove, With language, and with softness framed to move, With little truth, but with a world of love. Such forms on maids in morning slumbers wait, When fancy first instructs their hearts to beat, When first they wish, and sigh for what they know Whilst the respectful, like the Greek, sits down, And wastes a ten years' siege before one town. For her own sake, let no forsaken maid, Our wanderer, for want of love, upbraid ; Since 'tis a secret, none should e'er confess, That they have lost the happy power to please. If you suspect the rogue inclined to break, Break first, and swear you've turn'd him off, a week ; As princes, when they resty statesmen doubt, Before they can surrender, turn 'em out. Whate'er you think, grave uses may be made, And much even for inconstancy be said. Let the good man, for marriage rites design'd, WTith studious care, and diligence of mind, Turn over every page of womankind ; Mark every sense, and how the readings vary, And, when he knows the worst on't, \u2014 let him not yet. Frown not, ye fair, to think your lovers may Reach your cold hearts by some unguarded way ; Let Yilleroy's misfortune make you wise, There's danger still in darkness and surprise ; Though from his ramparts he defied the foe, Prince Eugene found an aqueduct below. With easy freedom, and a gay address, A pressing lover seldom wants success: marry."], [679, "THE TWIN-RIVALS. _- aromrtm. Sic vos non vobis, \u2014 Virgil. TO HENRY BRETT, ESQ. The commons of England have a right of petitioning ; and since by your place in the senate you are obliged to heaj and redress the subject, I presume upon the privilege of the people to give you the following trouble. As prologues introduce plays on the stage, so dedications usher them into the great theatre of the world ; and as we choose some stanch actor to address the audience, so we pitch upon some gentleman of undisputed ingenuity to recommend us to the reader. Books, like metals, require to be stamped with some valuable effigies before they become popular and current. To escape the critics, I resolved to take sanctuary with one of the best j one who differs from the fraternity in this, that his good-nature is ever predominant, can discover an author's smallest fault, and pardon the greatest. Your generous approbation, Sir, has done this play service, but has injured the author ; for it has made him insuffer ably vain, and he thinks himself authorised to stand up for the merit of his performance, when so great a master of wit has declared in its favour. The muses are the most coquettish of their sex, fond of being admired, and always putting on their best airs to the finest gentleman : but alas, Sir ! their addresses are stale, and their fine things but repetition ; for there is nothing new in wit, but what is found in your own conversation. Could Iwrite by the help of study, as you talk without it, I would venture to say something in the usual strain of dedication ; but as you have too much wit to suffer it, and I too little to undertake it, I hope the world will excuse my deficiency, and you will pardon the presumption of, Sir, your most obliged, and most humble servant, December 23, 1702. G. FARQUHAR THE PREFACE. The success and countenance that debauchery has met with in plays, was the most severe and reasonable charge against their authors in Mr. Collier's \" Short View ; \" and indeed this gentleman had done the drama considerable service, had he arraigned the stage only to punish its misdemeanours, and not to take away its life ; but there is an advantage to be made sometimes of the advice of an enemy, and the only way to disappoint his designs, is to improve upon his invective, and to make the stage flourish, by virtue of that satire by which he thought to suppress it. I have therefore in this piece endeavoured to show, that an English comedy may answer the strictness of poetical justice ; but indeed the greater share of the English audience, I mean that part which is no farther read than in plays of their own language, have imbibed other principles, and stand up as vigorously for the old poetic licence, as they do for the liberty of the subject. They take all innovations for grievances ; and, let a project be never so well laid for their advantage, yet the undertaker is very likely to suffer by't. A play without a beau, cully, cuckold, or coquette, is as poor an entertainment to some palates, as their Sunday's dinner would be without beef and pudding. And this I take to be one reason that the galleries were so thin during the run of this play. I thought indeed to have soothed the splenetic zeal of the city, by making a gentleman a knave, and punishing their great grievance\u2014 a whoremaster ; but a certain virtuoso of that fraternity has told me since, that the citizens were never more disappointed in any entertain ment : \" For,\" said he, \" however pious we may appear to be at home, yet we never go to that end of the town but with an intention to be lewd.\" There was an odium cast upon this play, before it appeared, by some persons who thought it their interest to have it suppressed. The ladies were frighted from seeing it by formidable stories of a midwife, and were told, no doubt, that they must expect no less than a labour upon the stage ; but I hope the examining into that aspersion will be enough to wipe it off, Binee the character of the midwife is only so far touched as is necessary for carrying on the plot, she being principally deciphered in her procuring capacity ; and I dare not affront the ladies so far as to imagine they could be offended at the exposing of a hawd. Some critics complain, that the design is defective for want of Clelia's appearance in the scene ; but I had rather they should find this fault, than I forfeit my regard to the fair, by showing a lady of figure under a misfortune ; for which reason I made her only nominal, and chose to expose the person that injured her; and if the ladies don't agree that I have done her justice in the end, I'm very sorry for't. Some people are apt to say, that the character of Richmore points at a particular person ; though I must contess l see nothing but what is very general in his character, except his marrying his own mistress ; which by the way he never did for he was no sooner off the stage but he changed his mind, and the poor lady is still in statu quo. But upon the"], [680, "586 THE TWIN-RIVALS. whole matter, 'tis application only makes the ass ; and characters in plays are like Long-lane clothes, not hung out for the use of any particular people, but to be bought by only those they happen to fit. The most material objection against this play is the importance of the subject, which necessarily leads into sentiments too grave for diversion, and supposes vices too great for comedy to punish. 'Tis said, I must own, that the business of comedy is chiefly to ridicule folly ; and that the punishment of vice falls rather into the province of tragedy ; but if there be a middle sort of wickedness, too high for the sock, and too low for the buskin, is there any reason that it should go unpunished ? What are more obnoxious to human society, than the villanies exposed in this play, the frauds, plots and contrivances upon the fortunes of men, and the virtue of women ? But the persons are too mean for the heroic ; then what must we do with them ? Why, they must of necessity drop into comedy ; for it is unreasonable to imagine that the lawgivers in poetry would tie themselves up from executing that justice which is the foundation of their constitution ; or to say, that exposing vice is the business of the drama, and vet make rules to screen it from persecution. Some have asked the question, why the Elder Wouldhe, in the fourth act, should counterfeit madness in his confine ment ? Don't mistake, there was no such thing in his head ; and the judicious could easily perceive, that it was only a start of humour put on to divert his melancholy ; and when gaiety is strained to cover misfortune, it may very naturally be overdone, and rise to a semblance of madness, sufficient to impose on the constable, and perhaps on some of the audience; who taking everything at sight, impute that as a fault, which lam bold to stand up for, as one of the most masterly strokes of the whole piece. This I think sufficient to obviate what objections I have heard made ; but there was no great occasion for making this defence, having had the opinion of some of the greatest persons in England, both for quality and parts, that the play has merit enough to hide more faults than have been found ; and I think their approbation sufficient to excuse some pride that may be incident to the author upon this performance. I must own myself obliged to Mr. Longueville for some lines in the part of Teague, and something of the lawyer ; but above all, for bis hint of the twins, upon which I formed my plot. But having paid him all due satisfaction and acknowledgment, I must do myself the justice to believe, that few of our modern writers have been loss beholden to foreign assistance in their plays, than I have been in the following scenes.

WILKS sounded, An Alarm With drums and trumpets in this warring age, A martial prologue should alarm the stage. New plays, ere acted, a full audience near, Seem towns invested, when a siege they fear. Prologues are like a forlorn hope, sent out Before the play, to skirmish and to scout : Our dreadful foes, the critics, when they spy, They cock, they charge, they fire, then \u2014 back thej fly. The siege is laid, \u2014 there gallant chiefs abound, Here foes intrench'd, there glittering troops around, And the loud batteries roar \u2014 from yonder rising ground. In the first act brisk sallies (miss or hit), With volleys of small shot, or snip-snap wit, Attack, and gall the trenches of the pit. The next the fire continues, but at length Grows less, and slackens like a bridegroom's strength. The third, feints, mines, and countermines abound, Your critic engineers safe underground, Blow up our works, and all our art confound. The fourth brings on most action, and 'tis sharp, Fresh foes crowd on, at your remissness carp, And desperate, though unskill'd, insult our counter - scarp. Then comes the last ; the general storm is near, The poet-governor now quakes for fear ; Runs wildly up and down, forgets to huff, And would give all he has plunder'd \u2014 to get off. So, Don and Monsieur, bluff before the siege, Were quickly tamed \u2014 at Venloo, and at Liege : 'Twas Viva Spagnia ! Vive France ! before; Now,Q_o?'/icr.' Alonsieur! Quartier! Ah, Senor! But what your resolution can withstand ? You master all, and awe the sea and land. In war your valour makes the strong submit ; Your judgment humbles all attempts in wit. What play, what fort, what beauty can endure, All fierce assaults, and always be secure ! Then grant 'em generous terms who dare to write, Since now that seems as desperate as to fight : If we must yield, yet ere the day be fist, Let us hold out the third, and, if we may, the sixth."], [681, "THE TWIN-RIVALS.

For that reason I communicate : I know thou art a perfect gazette, and will spread the news all over the town : for you must understand that I am now besieging another ; and I would have the fame of my conquest upon the wing, that the town may surrender the sooner.

No farther yet, Wouldbe ! 'tis almost one. Ben. Would. Then blame the clockmakers, they made it so ; the sun has neither fore nor afternoon. Prithee, what have we to do with time ? Can't we let it alone as nature made it? Can't a man eat when he's hungry, go to bed when he's sleepy, rise when he wakes, dress when he pleases, without the confinement of hours to enslave him ? Rich. No, no, women are cowards, and terror prevails upon them more than clemency : my best pretence to my success with the fair is my using 'em ill. 'Tis turning their own guns upon 'em, and I have always found it the most successful battery to assail one reputation by sacrificing another, Ben. Would. I could love thee for thy mischief, did I not envy thee for thy success in't. Rich. You never attempt a woman of figure. Ben. Would. How can I ? this confounded hump of mine is such a burden at my back, that it presses me down here in the dirt and diseases of Covent garden, the low suburbs of pleasure. Curst for tune ! I am a younger brother, and yet cruelly deprived of my birthright of a handsome person ; seven thousand a year in a direct line, would have straightened my back to some purpose. But I look, in my present circumstances, like a branch of an other kind, grafted only upon the stock which makes me grow so crooked. Rich.

No, no, Fortune took care of me there\u2014 I had none to lose. Rich. 'Tis that gives you the spleen. Ben. Would. Yes, I have got the spleen ; and something else. \u2014 Hark'ee \u2014 [Whispers. Rich. How! Ben. Would. Positively. The lady's kind re ception was the most severe usage I ever met with. Shan't I break her windows, Richmore ? Rich. A mighty revenge truly ! Let me tell you, friend, that breaking the windows of such houses are no more than writing over a vintner's door, as they do in Holland, Vin le koop. 'Tis no more than a bush to a tavern, a decoy to trade, and to draw in customers ; but upon the whole matter, 1 think, a gentleman should put up an affront got in such little company ; for the pleasure, the pain, and the resentment, are all alike scandalous. Ben. Would. Have you forgot, Richmore, how I found you one morning with the Flying-Post in your hand, hunting for physical advertisements ? Rich. That was in the days of dad, my friend, in the days of dirty linen, pit-masks, hedge-ta verns, and beefsteaks ; but now 1 fly at nobler game ; the Ring, the Court, Pawlet's, and the Park : I despise all women that I apprehend any danger from, less than the having my throat cut : and should scruple to converse even with a lady of for tune, unless her virtue were loud enough to give me pride in exposing it.\u2014 Here's a letter I received this morning ; you may read it. [Gives a letter. Ben. Would. [Reads.] If there be solemnity in protestation, justice in heaven, or fidelity on earth, I may still depend on the faith of my Richmore. Though I may conceal my love, I no longer can hide the effects on't from the world. Be careful of my honour, remember your vows, and fly to the relief of the disconsolate Clelia. The fair, the courted, blooming Clelia ! Rich. The credulous, troublesome, foolish Clelia. Did you ever read such a fulsome harangue ? Lard, sir, I am near my time, and want your as- Ben. Would. Then why should not I be a lord as well as he ? Had I the same title to the de formity I could bear it. Rich. But how does my lord bear the absence of your twin-brother ? Ben. Would. My twin-brother ! Ay, 'twas his crowding me that spoiled my shape, and his coming half an hour before me that ruined my fortune. My father expelled me his house some two years ago, because I would have persuaded him that my twin-brother was a bastard. He gave me my por tion, which was about fifteen hundred pound, and I have spent two thousand of it already. As for my brother, he don't care a farthing for me. Rich. Why so, pray ? Ben. Would. A very odd reason \u2014 because I hate him. Rich. How should he know that ? Ben. Would. Because he thinks it reasonable it should be so. Rich. But did your actions ever express any malice to him ? Ben. Would. Yes : I would fain have kept him company ; but being aware of my kindness, he went abroad. He has travelled these five years, and I"], [682, "588 THE TWIN-RIVALS. ACT I. am told, is a grave sober fellow, and in danger of living a great while ; all my hope is, that when he gets into his honour and estate, the nobility will soon kill him by drinking him up to his dignity. But come, Frank, I have but two eyesores in the world, a brother before me and a hump behind me, and thou art still laying 'em in my way : let us as sume an argument of less severity. Canst thou lend ine a brace of hundred pounds ? Rich. What would you do with 'em ? Ben. Would. Do with 'em ! there's a question indeed ! Do you think I would eat 'em ? Rich. Yes, o' my troth, would you, and drink 'em together. Look'ee, Mr. Wouldbe, whilst you kept well with your father, I could have ventured to have lent you five guineas : but as the case stands, I can assure you, I have lately paid off my sister's fortunes, and \u2014 Re-enter Jack. Take this ; pay for a bottle of wine, and bid Bal derdash bring it himself. \u2014 [Exit Jack.] How melancholy are my poor breeches ; not one chink ! \u2014 Thou art a villanous hand, for thou hast picked my pocket.- \u2014 This vintner now has all the marks of an honest fellow, a broad face, a copious look, a strutting belly, and a jolly mien. I have brought him above three pound a night for these two years successively. The rogue has money, I'm sure, if he will but lend it. Enter Balderdash with a bottle and glass, Jack attending. Oh, Mr. Balderdash, good morrow. Bald. Noble Mr. Wouldbe, I'm your most humble servant. I have brought you a whetting glass, the best old hock in Europe ; I know 'tis your drink in a morning. Ben. Would. I'll pledge you, Mr. Balderdash. Bald. Your health, sir. [Drinks Ben. Would. Sir, this put-off looks like an affront, when you know I don't use to take such things. Ben. Would. Pray, Mr. Balderdash, tell me one thing \u2014 but first sit down : now tell me plainly what you think of me ? Bald. Think of you, sir ! I think that you are the honestest, noblest gentleman, that ever drank a glass of wine ; and the best customer that ever came into my house. Ben. Would. And you really think as you speak ? Bald. May this wine be my poison, sir, if 1 don't speak from the bottom of my heart ! Ben. Would. And how much money do you think I have spent in your house ? Bald. Why truly, sir, by a moderate computa tion, I do believe that I have handled of your monev the best part of five hundred pounds within these two years. Ben. Would. Very well ! And do you think that you lie under any obligation for the trade I have promoted to your advantage ? Bald. Yes, sir ; and if I can serve you in any respect, pray command me to the utmost of my ability. Ben. Would. Well, thanks to my stars, there is still some honesty in wine ! \u2014 Mr. Balderdash, I embrace you and your kindness : I am at present a little low in cash, and must beg you to lend me a hundred pieces. Bald. Why, truly, Mr. Wouldbe, I was afraid it would come to this. I have had it in my head several times to caution you upon your expenses : but you were so very genteel in my house, and your liberality became you so very well, that I was unwilling to say anything that might check your disposition; but truly, sir, I can forbear no longer to tell you, that you have been a little too extravagant. Ben. Would. But since you reaped the benefit of my extravagance, you will, I hope, consider my necessity. Bald. Consider your necessity ! I do with all my heart, and must tell you, moreover, that I will be no longer accessary to it : I desire you, sir, to frequent my house no more. Ben. Would. How, sir ! Bald. I say, sir, that I have an honour for my good lord your father, and will not suffer his son to run into any inconvenience. Sir, I shall order my drawers not to serve you with a drop of wine. Would you have me connive at a gentleman's destruction ? Rich. Sir, your demand is rather an affront, when you know I don't use to give such things. Ben. Would. Sir, I'll pawn my honour. Rich. That's mortgaged already for more than it is worth ; you had better pawn your sword there, 'twill bring you forty shillings. Ben. Would. 'Sdeath, sir. \u2014 [Takes his sword off the table. Rich. Hold, Mr. Wouldbe! suppose I put an end to your misfortunes all at once ? Ben. Would. How, sir ? Rich. Why go to a magistrate, and swear you would have robbed me of two hundred pounds. Look'ee, sir, you have been often told, that your extravagance would some time or other be the ruin of you ; and it will go a great way in your indictment, to have turned the pad upon your friend. Ben. Would. This usage is the height of ingra titude from you, in whose company I have spent my fortune. Rich. I'm therefore a witness, that it was very ill spent. Why would you keep company, be at equal expenses with me, that have fifty times your estate ? What was gallantry in me, was prodigality in you ; mine was my health, because I could pay for't ; yours a disease, because you could not. Ben. Would. And is this all I must expect from our friendship ? Rich. Friendship ! sir, there can be no such thing without an equality. Ben. Would. That is, there can be no such thing when there is occasion for't. Rich. Right, sir ; our friendship was over a bottle only ; and whilst you can pay your club of friend ship, I'm that way your humble servant ; but when once you come borrowing, I'm this way \u2014 your humble servant. [Exit Ben. Would. Rich, big, proud, arrogant villain ! I have been twice his second, thrice sick of the same love, and thrice cured by the same physic, and now he drops me for a trifle. That an honest fellow in his cups should be such a rogue when he's sober ! The narrow-hearted rascal has been drink ing coffee this morning. Well, thou dear, solitary half-crown, adieu ! \u2014 Here, Jack ! Ben. Would. But methinks, sir, that a person"], [683, "SCENE II. THE TWIN- RIVALS. 589 of your nice conscience should have cautioned me before. Bald. Alas '. sir, it was none of my business. Would you have me be saucy to a gentleman that was my best customer ? Lackaday, sir, had you money to hold it out still, I had been hanged rather than be rude to you. But truly, sir, when a man is ruined, 'tis but the duty of a Christian to tell him of it. SCENE II.\u2014 A Room in Mrs. Mandrake's House. Mrs. Mandrake discovered. Mrs. Man. Who is there ? [Calls-. Enter Maid. Maid. Madam ! Ben. Would. Will you lend me the money, sir? Bald. Will you pay me this bill, sir ? Ben. Would. Lend me the hundred pound, and I will pay the bill. Bald. Pay me the bill, and I will not lend the hundred pound, sir. But pray consider with yourself now, sir, would not you think me an arrant cox comb, to trust a person with money that has always been so extravagant under my eye ? whose profuse ness I have seen, I have felt, I have handled? Have not I known you, sir, throw away ten pound of a night upon a covey of pit-partridges, and a setting-dog ? Sir, you have made my house an ill house : my very chairs will bear you no longer. In short, sir, I desire you to frequent the Crown no more, sir. Ben. Would. Thou sophisticated tun of iniquity, have I fattened your carcass, and swelled your bags with my vital blood ? Have I made you my com panion to be thus saucy to me? But now I will keep you at your due distance. [Kicks him. Airs. Alan. Has any message been left for me to-day ? Alaid. Yes, madam : here has been one from my lady Stillborn, that desired you not to be out of the way, for she expected to cry out every minute. Airs. Man. How ! every minute ! \u2014 Let me see. \u2014 [ Takes out a pocket-book.] Stillborn \u2014 ay \u2014 she reckons with her husband from the first of April ; and with sir James, from the first of March. \u2014Ay, she's always a month before her time. \u2014 [Knocking at the door.] Go see who's at the door. Alaid. Yes, madam. [Exit. Airs. Alan. Well, certainly there is not a woman in the world so willing to oblige mankind as my self! and really I have been so ever since the age of twelve, as 1 can remember. I have delivered as many women of great bellies, and helped as many to 'em, as any person in England ; but my watching and cares have broken me quite, I am not the same woman I was forty years ago. Enter Richmore. Jack. Welcome, sir 1 Ben. Would. Well said, Jack. [Kicks him again. Oh, Mr. Richmore ! you're a sad man, a barbar ous man, so you are ! What will become of poor Clelia, Mr. Richmore ? The poor creature is so big with her misfortunes, that they are not to be borne. [Weeps. Jack. Very welcome, sir 1 I hope we shall have your company another time. Welcome, sir ! [Balderdash is kicked off. Ben. Would. Pray wait on him down stairs, and give him a welcome at the door too. \u2014 [Exit Jack.] This is the punishment of hell ; the very devil that tempted me to the sin, now upbraids me with the crime \u2014 Ihavevillanously murdered my fortune; and now its ghost, in the lank shape of poverty, haunts me : is there no charm to conjure down the fiend ? Rich. You, Mrs. Mandrake, are the fittest per son in the world to ease her of 'em. Airs. Alan. And won't you marry her, Mr. Richmore ? Rich. My conscience won't allow it ; for I have sworn since to marry another. Mrs. Alan. And will you break your vows to Clelia ? Re-enter Jack. Rich. Why not, when she has broke hers to me ? Airs. Alan. How's that, sir? Jack. O sir, here's sad news ! Ben. Would. Then keep it to thyself, I have enough of that already. Jack. Sir, you will hear it too soon. Ben. Would. What ! is Broad below ? Rich. Why, she swore a hundred times Dever to grant me the favour, and yet, you know she broke her word. Airs. Alan. But she loved, Mr. Richmore, and that was the reason she forgot her oath. Rich. And I love Mr. Richmore, and that is the reason I forgot mine. Why should she be angry that I follow her own example, by doing the very same thing from the very same motive ? Mrs. Alan. Well, well, take my word, you'll never thrive. I wonder how you can have the face to come near me, that am the witness of your horrid oaths and imprecations ! Are not you afraid that the guilty chamber above-stairs should fall down upon your head? Yes, yes, I was acces sary, I was so ; but if ever you involve my honour in such a villany the second time \u2014 Ah, poor Clelia ! I loved her as I did my own daughter \u2014 you seduc ing man ! [Weeps. Rich. Heigh-ho, my Aurelia ! Airs. Alan. Heigh-ho, she's very pretty ! Rich. Dost thou know her, my dear Man- Jack. No, no, sir ; better twenty such as he were hanged. Sir, your father's dead. Ben. Would. My father! \u2014 Good night, my lord ! \u2014 Has he left me anything? Jack. I heard nothing of that, sir. Ben. Would. Then I believe you heard all there was of it. \u2014 Let me see.\u2014 My father dead ! and my elder brother abroad ! \u2014 If necessity be the mother of invention, she was never more pregnant than with me \u2014 [Pauses.] Here, sirrah, run to Mrs. Mandrake, and bid her come hither presently. \u2014 [Exit Jack.] That woman was my mother's mid wife when I was born, and has been my bawd these ten years. I have had her endeavours to corrupt my brother's mistress ; and now her assistance will be necessary to cheat him of his estate ; fur she's famous for understanding the right side of a woman, and the wrong side of the law. [Exit- drake ? Mrs. Alan. Heigh-ho, she's very pretty ! Ah,"], [684, "590 THE TWIN-RIVALS. ACT I. you're a sad man ! Poor Clelia was handsome, but indeed, breeding, puking, and longing, has broken her much. 'Tis a hard case, Mr. Richmore, for a young lady to see a thousand things, and long for a thousand things, and yet not dare to own that she longs for one. She had like to have miscarried t'other day for the pith of a loin of veal. \u2014 Ah, you barbarous man ! \u2014 your nephew ! he must be the man ; and shall be the man ; I have a kindness for him. Rich. But we must have a care ; the fellow wants neither sense nor courage. Mrs- Alan. Phu, phu ! never fear her part, she shan't want instructions ; and then for her lying in a little abruptly, 'tis my business to reconcile matters there, a fright or a fall excuses that. Lard, sir ! I do these things every day. Rich. 'Tis pity then to put you out of your road ; and Clelia shall have a husband. Rich. But, my Aurelia ! confirm me that you know her, and I'll adore thee. Mrs. Man. You would fling five hundred guineas at my head, that you knew as much of her as I do : why, sir, I brought her into the world ; I have had her sprawling in my lap. Ah ! she was as plump as a puffin, sir. Rich. I think she has no great portion to value herself upon ; her reputation only will keep up the market. We must first make that cheap, by crying it down, and then she'll part with it at an easy rate. Airs. Man. But won't you provide for poor Clelia ? Mrs. Man. Spoke like a man of honour ! and now I'll serve you again. This Aurelia, you say \u2014 Rich. Oh, she distracts me ! Her beauty, family, and virtue, make her a noble pleasure. Mrs. Man. And you have a mind for that reason to get her a husband ? Rich. Yes, faith ; I have another young relation at Cambridge is just going into orders; and I think such a fine woman, with fifteen hundred pound, is a better presentation than any living in my gift ; and why should he like the cure the worse that an incumbent was there before ? Rich. Provide ! why han't I taught her a trade ? Let her set up when she will, I'll engage her customers enough, because I can answer for the goodness of the ware. Mrs. Alan Nay, but you ought to set her up with credit, and take a shop ; that is, get her a husband. Have yon no pretty gentleman your relation now, that wants a young virtuous lady with a handsome fortune ? No young Templar that has spent his estate iu the study of the law, and starves by the practice ? No spruce officer that wants a handsome wife to make court for him among the major generals ? Have you none of these, sir ? Rich. Pho, pho, madam ! you have tired me upon that subject. Do you think a lady that gave me so much trouble before possession shall ever give me any after it ? No, no ; had she been more obliging to me when I was in her power, I should be more civi,l to her now she's in mine : my assi duity beforehand was an over price ; had she made a merit of the matter, she should have yielded sooner. Airs. Alan. Nay, nay, sir ; though you have no regard to her honour, yet you shall protect mine. How d'ye think I have secured my reputation so long among the people of best figure, but by keep ing all mouths stopped? Sir, I'll have no clamours at me. Heavens help me, I have clamours enough at my door early and late in my t'other capacity ! In short, sir, a husband for Clelia, or I banish you my presence for ever. Rich. Thou art a necessary devil, and I can't want thee. [Aside. Airs. Man. Thou art a pretty fellow ! At the same moment you would persuade me that you love a woman to madness, are you contriving how to part with her. Rich. If I loved her not to madness I should not run into these contradictions. Here, my dear mother, Aurelia's the word. [Offers her money. Airs. Man. Pardon me, sir !\u2014 [Refusing the money.] Did you ever know me mercenary ? No, no, sir ; virtue is its own reward. Rich. Nay, but, madam, I owe you for the teeth powder you sent me. Mrs. Alan. Oh, that's another matter, sir I \u2014 [Takes the money.] I hope you like it, sir ? Rich. Extremely, madam. \u2014 [Aside.] But it was somewhat dear of twenty guineas. Enter Footman. Foot. Madam, here is Mr. W7ouldbe's footman below with a message from his master. Airs. Alan. I come to him presently. \u2014 [Exit Footman.] Do you know that Wouldbe loves Aurelia's cousin and companion, Mrs. Constance with the great fortune, and that I solicit for him ? Rich. Why, she's engaged to his elder brother ! besides, young Wouldbe has no money to prosecute an affair of such consequence. You can have no hope6 of success there, I'm sure. Mrs. Man. Truly, I have no great hopes ; but an industrious body, you know, would do anything rather than be idle : the aunt is very near her time, and I have access to the family when I please. Rich. Now I think on't ; prithee, get the letter from Wouldbe that I gave him just now. It would be proper to our designs upon Trueman that it should not be exposed. Airs. Alan. And you showed Clelia's letter to Wouldbe ? Mrs. Alan. Look'ee, sir, 'tis your own advan tage ; 'tis only making over your estate into the hands of a trustee ; and though you don't absolutely command the premises, yet you may exact enough out of 'em for necessaries, when you will. Rich. Patience a little, madam ! I have a young nephew that is a captain of horse : he mortgaged the last morsel of his estate to me, to make up his equipage for the last campaign. Perhaps you know him ; he's a brisk fellow, much about court, captain Trueman. Mrs. Alan. Trueman ! ads my life, he's one of my ba'iies ! I can tell you the very minute he was born \u2014 precisely at three a clock next St. George's day Trueman will be two-and-twenty ; a stripling, the prettiest, good-nature 1 child, and Rich. Yes. Mrs. Alan. Eh, you barbarous man ! Who the devil would oblige you ? What pleasure can you take in exposing the poor creature ? Dear little child, 'tis pity, indeed it is ! Rich.

Come, come, walk about and divert it; the air will do you good ; think of other people's affairs a little. When did you see Clelia ? Con. I'm glad you mentioned her ; don't you observe her gaiety to be much more forced than formerly? her humour don't sit so easy upon her. Aur. No, nor her stays neither, I can assure you. Con. Did you observe how she devoured the pomegranates yesterday ? Aur. She talks of visiting a relation in Leices tershire. Con. How, how, cousin, you never told me that. Aur. How should I ? He never told it me, but 1 have discovered it by a great many signs and tokens, that are better security for his heart than ten thousand vows and promises. Con. He's Richmore's nephew. Aur. Ah, would he were his heir too ! He's a pretty fellow. But, then, he's a soldier ; and must share his time with his mistress, honour, in Flan ders.

That's for me whoever spoke it. \u2014 [The Ladies turn about.] Aurelia ! Con. What, captain, you're afraid of everything but the enemy ! True. I have reason, ladies, to be most appre hensive where there is most danger. The enemy is satisfied with a leg or an arm, but here I'm in hazard of losing my heart. Aur. None in the world, sir, nobody here de signs to attack it. True. But suppose it be assaulted, and taken already, madam ? Aur. Then we'll return it without ransom. Con.

Ben. Would. Why, a timorous, half-honest man, that a little persuasion will make a whole knave. He wants courage to be throughly just or entirely a villain ; but good backing will make him either. Afrs. Man. I defy any chambermaid in England to do it better. I have dressed up a hundred and fifty cheats in my time. Mrs. Alan. And he shan't want that !

By your father's will, man, your father's will : \u2014 that is, one that your father might have made, and which we will make for him. I'll send you a nephew of my own, a lawyer, that shall do the business. Go, get into possession, pos session, I say ; let us have but the estate to back the suit, and you'll find the law too strong for justice, I warrant you. Ben. Would. My oracle !

Why, truly, as you say, that favour is so easy that I wonder they make such a bustle about it. But get you gone and mind your affairs, I must about mine. \u2014 Oh \u2014 1 had forgot\u2014 where's that foolish letter you had this morning from Richmore ? Airs. Alan. You put the case very well. Ben. Would. One of two things I must choose \u2014 either to be a lord or a beggar. Mrs. Man. Be a lord to choose : \u2014 though I have known some that have chosen both. Ben. Would. I have a brother that I love very well ; but, since one of us must want, I had rather he should starve than I. Airs. Alan. Upon my conscience, dear heart, you're in the right on't. Ben. Would. Now your advice upon these heads. Airs. Alan. They be matters of weight, and I must consider \u2014 [Drinks.] Is there a will in the case ? Ben. Would. There is ; which excludes me from every foot of the estate. Airs. Man. That's bad.- \u2014 Where's your brother? Ben. Would. He's now in Germany, in his way to England, and is expected very soon. Airs. Alan. How soon? Ben. Would. In a month or less. Ben. Would. I have posted it up in the Choco late-house. Afrs. Afan. O ho ! a month is a great while ! our business must be done in an hour or two. We must \u2014 [Drinks] suppose your brother to be dead; nay, he shall be actually dead \u2014 and, my lord, my humble service t'ye ! Ben. Would. O madam, I'm your ladyship's most devoted! Make your words good, and I'll \u2014 Afrs. Afan. Say no more, sir ; you shall have it, you shall have it. Ben. Would. Ay, but how, dear Mrs. Man drake? Airs. Man. Yaw !\u2014 [Shrieks.] I shall fall into fits ; hold me \u2014 Ben. Would. No, no, I did but jest ; here it is. But be assured, madam, I wanted only time to have exposed it. Airs. Alan. Ah, you barbarous man ! why so ? Ben. Would. Because, when knaves of our sex, and fools of yours meet, they make the best jest in the world. Afrs. Alan. Sir, the world has a better share in"], [687, "SCENK III. THE TWIN-RIVALS. 593 the jest when we are the knaves and you the fools. But look'ee, sir, if ever you open your mouth about this trick, I'll discover all your tricks; therefore, silence and safety on both sides. Ben. Would. Madam, you need not doubt my silence at present ; because my own affairs will employ me sufficiently ; so there's your letter. \u2014 [Gives the letter.] And now to write my own. Enter Benjamin Wouldbe. Clear. Ah, sir ! we have all lost a father, a friend, and a supporter. Ben. Would. Ay, Mr. Steward, we must submit to fate, as he has done. And it is no small addition to my grief, honest Mr. Clearaccount, that it is not in my power to supply my father's place to you and yours. Your sincerity and justice to the dead merits the greatest regard from those that survive him. Had I but my brother's ability, or he my inclinations, I'll assure you, Mrs. Clearaccount, you should not have such cause to mourn. Mrs. Man. Adieu, my lord ! \u2014 [Exit Wouldbe.] Let me see. \u2014 [Opens the letter and reads.] If there be solemnity in protestations\u2014 that's foolish, very foolish ! Why should she expect solemnity in protestations ? \u2014 Um, um, um. \u2014 I may still de pend upon the faith of my Richmore Ah, poor Clelia ! \u2014 Um, um, um. \u2014 / can no longer hide the effects on't from the world. \u2014 The effects on't ! How modestly is that expressed ! Well, 'tis a pretty letter, and I'll keep it. [Exit. Airs. Clear. Ah, good noble sir ! Clear. Your brother, sir, I hear, is a very severe man. Ben. Would. He is what the world calls a pru dent man, Mr. Steward. I have often heard him very severe upon men of your business : and has declared, that for form's sake indeed he would keep a steward, but that he would inspect into all his accounts himself. Airs. Clear. Ay, Mr. Wouldbe, you have more sense than to do these things ; you have more honour than to trouble your head with your own affairs. Would to Heavens we were to serve you ! Ben. Would. Would I could serve you, madam, without injustice to my brother. SCENE 111.\u2014 A Room in Lord Wouldbe's House. Mr. and Mrs. Clearaccount discovered. Airs. Clear. You are to blame, you are much to blame, husband, in being so scrupulous. Clear. 'Tis true ; this foolish conscience of mine has been the greatest bar to my fortune. Mrs. Clear. And will ever be so. Tell me but one that thrives, and I'll show you a hundred that starve by it. Do you think 'tis fourscore pound a year makes my lord Gouty's steward's wife live at the rate of four hundred ? Upon my word, my dear, I'm as good a gentlewoman as she, and I ex pect to be maintained accordingly. 'Tis conscience I warrant that buys her the point-heads and dia mond necklace? Was it conscience that bought her the fine house in Jermyn-street ? Is it conscience that enables the steward to buy when the lord is forced to sell ? Enter Footman. Foot. A letter for my lord Wouldbe. Clear. It comes too late, alas ! for his perusal. Let me see it. [Opens and reads. Frankfort, Octob. 10, new style. Frankfort ! where's Frankfort, sir ? Ben. Would. In Germany. This letter must be from my brother ; I suppose he's a-coming home. Clear. 'Tis none of his hand. Let me see. [Reads. My Lord, I am troubled at this unhappy occasion of send ing to your lordship ; your brave son, and my dear friend, was yesterday unfortunately hilled in a duel by a German count \u2014 I shall love a German count as long as I live. \u2014 My lord, my lord, now I may call you so, since your elder brother's \u2014 dead. Clear. But what would you have me do ? Mrs. Clear. Do ! now's your time ; that small morsel of an estate your lord bought lately, a thing not worth mentioning ; take it towards your daughter Molly's portion. What's two hundred a year ? 'twill ne7er be missed. Clear. 'Tis but a small matter, 1 must confess ; and as a reward for my past faithful service, I think it but reasonable I should cheat a little now. Ben. Would., Airs. Clear. How? Clear. Read there. [Gives the tetter, Wouldbe peruses it. Ben. Would. Oh, my fate ! a father and a brother in one day ! Heavens ! 'tis too much. \u2014 Where is the fatal messenger ? Foot. A gentleman, sir, who said he came post on purpose. He was afraid the contents of the letter would unqualify my lord for company ; so he would take another time to wait on him. [Exit. Ben. Would. Nay, then 'tis true ; and there is truth in dreams. Last night I dreamed \u2014 Mrs. Clear. Nay, my lord, I dreamed too ; I dreamed I saw your brother dressed in a long minister's gown (Lord bless us !), with a book in his hand, walking before a dead body to the grave. Mrs. Clear. Reasonable ! all the reason that can be ; if the ungrateful world won't reward an honest man, why let an honest man reward himself. There's five hundred pounds you received but two days ago, lay them aside. You may easily sink it in the charge of the funeral. Do my dear now, kiss me, and do it. Clear. Well, you have such a winning way with you ! But, my dear, I'm so much afraid of my young lord's coming home ; he's a cunning close man, they say, and will examine my accounts very narrowly. Airs. Clear. Ay, my dear, would you had the younger brother to deal with ! you might manage him as you pleased. I see him coming. Let us weep, let us weep. [They pull out their handkerchiefs, and seem to mourn. Ben. Would. Well, Mr. Clearaccount, get mourning ready. Clear. Will your lordship have the old coach covered, or a new one made ? Ben. Would. A new one. The old coach, with the grey horses, I give to Mrs. Clearaccount here ; 'tis not fit she should walk the streets. Qtt"], [688, "THE TWIN-RIVALS. 594 ACT II. Airs. Clear. [Aside.] Heavens bless the Ger man count, I say ! \u2014 [Aloud.] But, my lord \u2014 Ben. Would. No reply, madam, you shall have it: and receive it but as the earnest of my favours \u2014 Mr. Clearaccount, I double your salary, and all the servants' wages, to moderate their grief for our great losses. Pray, sir, take order about these affairs. Clear. I shall, my lord. [Exit with Mrs. Clearaccount. Ben. Would. So ! I have got possession of the castle, and if I had but a little law to fortify me now, I believe we might hold it out a great while. Oh ! here comes my attorney. SCENE IV.\u2014 The Park. Enter Richmore and Captain Trueman, meeting. Rich. O brave cuz ! you're very happy with the fair, I find. Pray which of those two ladies you encountered just now has your adoration ? True. She that commands by forbidding it: and since I had courage to declare to herself, I dare now own it to the world : Aurelia, sir, is my angel. Rich. Ha ! \u2014 [A long pause.] Sir, I find you're of everybody's religion ; but methinks you make a bold flight at first. Do you think your captain's pay will stake against so high a gamester ? True. What do you mean ? Rich. Mean ! bless me, sir, mean ! \u2014 You're a man of mighty honour, we all know. \u2014 But I'll tell you a secret \u2014 the thing is public already. True. I should be proud that all mankind were acquainted with it ; I should despise the passion that could make me either ashamed or afraid to own it. Enter Subtleman. Mr. Subtleman, your servant. Sub. My lord, I wish you joy ; my aunt Man drake has sent me to receive your commands. Ben. Would. Has she told you anything of the affair .' Sub. Not a word, my lord. Ben. Would. Why then \u2014 come nearer. \u2014 Can you make a man right heir to an estate during the life of an elder brother ? Rich. Ha ! ha ! ha . prithee, dear captain, no more of these rhodomontados ; you may as soon put a standing-army upon us. I'll tell you another secret \u2014 five hundred pound is the least penny. Sub. I thought you had been the eldest. Ben. Would. That we are not yet agreed upon ; for you must know, there is an impertinent fellow that takes a fancy to dispute the seniority with me; for, look'ee, sir, my mother has unluckily sowed discord in the family, by bringing forth twins. My brother, 'tis true, was first-born ; but, I believe from the bottom of my heart, I was the first-begotten. Sub. 1 understand \u2014 you are come to an estate and dignity, that by justice indeed is your own, but by law it falls to your brother. Ben. Would. I had rather, Mr. Subtleman, it were his by justice and mine by law ; for I would have the strongest title, if possible. Sub. I am very sorry there should happen any breach between brethren : so I think it would be but a christian and charitable act to take away all farther disputes, by making you true heir to the estate by the last will of your father. Look'ee, I'll divide stakes ; you shall yield the eldership and honour to him, and he shall quit his estate to you. Ben. Would. Why, as you say, I don't much care if I do grant him the eldest, half an hour is but a trifle. But how shall we do about this will ? who shall we get to prove it ? True. Nay, to my knowledge, she has fifteen hundred. Rich. Nay, to my knowledge, she took five. True. Took five ! how ? where ? Rich. In her lap, in her lap, captain, where should it be? True. I'm amazed ! Rich. So am I ; that she could be so unreason able. \u2014 Fifteen hundred pound ! 'sdeath ! had she that price from you ? True. 'Sdeath ! I meant her portion. Rich. Why, what have you to do with her portion ? True. I loved her up to marriage, by this light! Rich. Marriage ! ha ! ha ! ha ! I love the gipsy for her cunning. A young, easy, amorous, credu lous fellow of two-and-twenty, was just the game she wanted; I find she presently singled you out from the herd. True. You distract me ! Sub. Never trouble yourself for that, I expect a cargo of witnesses and usquebaugh by the first fair wind. Rich. A soldier too, that must follow the wars abroad, and leave her to engagements at home. True. Death and furies ! I'll be revenged ! Rich. Why, what can you do ? You'll chal lenge her, will you ? True. Her reputation was spotless when I went over. Ben. Would. But we can't stay for them ; it must be done immediately. Sub. Well, well ; we'll find somebody, I warrant you, to make oath of his last words. Ben. Would. That's impossible ; for my father died of an apoplexy, and did not speak at all. Sub. That's nothing, sir : he's not the first dead man that I have made to speak. Ben. Would. You're a great master of speech, I don't question, sir; and I can assure you there will be ten guineas for every word you extort from him in my favour. Sub. O 6ir, that's enough to make your great grandfather speak. Ben. Would Come then, I'll carry you to my steward ; he shall give you the names of the manors, and the true titles and denominations of the estate, and then you shall go to work. [Exeunt. Rich. So was the reputation of mareschal Bouf flers ; but d'ye think, that while you were beating the French abroad, that we were idle at home? No, no, we have had our sieges, our capitulations, and surrendries, and all that. We have cut our selves out good winter quarters as well as you. True. And are you billeted there ? Rich. Look'ee, Trueman, you ought to be very trusty to a secret, that has saved you from destruc tion. In plain terms, I have buried five hundred pounds in that little spot, and I should think it very hard if you took it over my head. True. Not by a lease for life, I can assure you: but I shall \u2014"], [689, "THE TWIN-RIVALS. SCENE V. 595 Rich. What ! you han't five hundred pounds to give ?

Ben. Would. But is there no other way? Sub. No, sir. Why, d'ye think Mr. Clear account here will hazard soul and body to swear they are his last words, unless they be made his last words ? For my part, sir, I'll swear to nothing but what I see with my eyes come out of a man's mouth. True. Dear sir, I could worship you for this. Rich. Not for this, nephew ; for I did not intend it, but I came to seek you upon another affair. Were not you in the presence last night ! True. I was. Ben. Would. But it looks so unnatural. Sub. W7hat, to open a man's mouth, and put in a bit of paper ! \u2014 this is all. Ben. Would. But the body is cold, and his teeth can't be got asunder. Sub. But what occasion has your father for teeth now ? I tell you what, I knew a gentleman, three days buried, taken out of his grave, and his dead hand set to his last will, (unless somebody made him sign another afterwards,) and I know the estate to be held by that tenure to this day ; and a firm tenure it is ; for a dead hand holds fastest ; and let me tell you, dead teeth will fasten as hard. Ben. Would. W7ell, well, use your pleasure, you understand the law best. \u2014 [Exeunt Subtleman and Clearaccount.] What a mighty confusion is brought into families by sudden death ! Men should db well to settle their affairs in time. Had my father done this before he was taken ill, what a trouble had he saved us ! But he was taken suddenly, poor man ! Rich. Did not you talk to Clelia, my lady Taper's niece ? True. A fine woman. Rich. Well, I met her upon the stairs, and handing her to her coach, she asked me if you were not my nephew ; and said two or three warm things, that persuade me she likes you. Her relations have interest at court, and she has money in her pocket. True. But \u2014 this devil Aurelia still sticks with me. Rich. What then ! the way to love in one place with success, is to marry in another with conveni ence. Clelia has four thousand pound ; this ap plied to your reigning ambition, whether love or advancement, will go a great way : and for her virtue and conduct, be assured, that nobody can give a better account of it than myself. True. I am willing to believe from this late accident, that you consult my honour and interest in what you propose, and therefore I am satisfied to be governed. Rich. I see the very lady in the walk. \u2014 We'll about it. Re-enter Subtleman. Sub. Your father still bears you the old grudge I find. It was with much struggling he con sented ; I never knew a man so loath to speak in my life. True. I wait on you. [Exeunt. Ben. Would. He was always a man of few words. Sub. Now I may safely bear witness myself, as the scrivener there present : I love to do things with a clear conscience. [Subscribes. SCENE V. \u2014 A Room in Lord Wouldbe's House. Ben. Would. But the law requires three witnesses. Sub. Oh I I shall pick up a couple more, that perhaps may take my word for't. But is not Mr. Clearaccount in your interest ? Ben. Would. I hope so. Sub. Then he shall be one ; a witness in the family goes a great way; besides, these foreign evidences are risen confoundedly since the wars. I hope, if mine escape the privateers, to make a hundred pound an ear of every head of 'em. But the steward is an honest man, and shall save you Benjamin Wouldbe, Subtleman, and Clearaccount, discovered. Ben. Would. Well, Mr. Subtleman, you are sure the will is firm and good in law ? Sub.

What ! violate the dead ! it must not be, Mr. Subtleman. . Sub. With all my heart, sir! But I think you had better violate the dead of a tooth or so, the charges. [Exit. Ben. Would. The pride of birth, the heats of appetite, and fears of want, are strong temptations to injustice. \u2014 But why injustice ? \u2014 The world has broke all civilities with me, and left me in the eldest state of nature, wild, where force, or cunning first created right.

My hours indeed I numbered, but ne'er enjoyed 'em till this moment. \u2014 My brother ! what is brother ? we are all so ; and the first two were enemies.

Aid. Your lordship's humble servant ! \u2014 I have a favour to beg. You must know, I have a grace less son, a fellow that drinks and swears eternally, keeps a whore in every corner of the town : in short, he's fit for no kind of thing but a soldier. I am so tired of him that I intend to throw him into the army, let the fellow be ruined, if he will. Ben. Would. I commend your paternal care, sir I Can I do you any service in this affair ? Aid. Yes, my lord : there is a vacant company in colonel Whatd'yecalum's regiment, and if your lordship would but speak to the general \u2014 Ben. Would. Has your son ever served ? Aid.

Has he ever signalised his courage ? Aid. Often, often, my lord ; but one day par ticularly, you must know, his captain was so busy shipping of a cargo of cheeses, that he left my son to command in his place \u2014 would you believe it, my lord ? he charged up Cheapside, in the front of the buff-coats with such bravery and courage, that I could not forbear wishing, in the loyalty of my heart, for ten thousand such officers upon the Rhine. Ah ! my lord, we must employ such fellows as him, or we shall never humble the French king. \u2014 Now, my lord, if you could find a convenient time to hint these things to the general \u2014 Ben.

As for that clamorous rogue of a tailor, speak him fair till he has made up my liveries : then about a year and a half hence, be at leisure to put him off ; for a year and a half longer. Clear. My lord, there's a gentleman below calls himself Mr. Basset, he says your lordship owes him fifty guineas that he won of you at cards. Ben. Would. Look'ee, sir, the gentleman's money is a debt of honour, and must be paid im mediatelv. Clear! Your father thought otherwise, my lord. He always took care to have the poor tradesmen satisfied, whose only subsistence lay in the use of their money, and was used to say, that nothing was honourable but what was honest. Ben. Would. My father might say what he pleased, he was a nobleman of very singular hu mours : but in my notion there are not two things in nature more different than honour and honesty. Now your honesty is a little mechanic quality, well enough among citizens, people that do nothing but pitiful mean actions according to law ; but your honour flies a much higher pitch, and will do any thing that's free and spontaneous, but scorns to level itself to what is only just. Herm. Would. Though this fellow travelled the world over he would never lose his brogue nor his stomach. \u2014 Why, you cormorant, so hungry and so early ! Teague. Early ! Deel tauke me, maishter, 'tish a great deal more than almost twelve a-clock. Herm. Would. Thou art never happy unless thy guts be stuffed up to thy eyes. Teague. O maishter, dere ish a dam way of dis tance, and the deel a bit between. Enter Benjamin Wouldbe in a chair, passing over the stage, with four or Jive Footmen before him. Herm. Would. Heyday, who comes here ? with one, two, three, four, five footmen ! Some young fellow just tasting the sweet vanity of fortune. \u2014 Run, Teague, inquire who that is. Teague. Yes, maishter.\u2014 [Runs to one of the Footmen.] Sir, will you give my humble shervish to your maishter, and tell him to send me word fat naam ish upon him."], [692, "THE TWIN-RIVALS. 598 ACT III. Foot. You would know fat naam ish upon him ? Teague. Yesh, set would I. Teague. To my maishter, dear joy. Sub. Then you have a master ? Teague. Fet I have, but he's dead. Sub. Right ! and how do you intend to live ? Teague. By eating, dear joy, fen I can get it, and by sleeping fen I can get none : 'tish the fashion of Ireland. Foot. Why, what are you, sir? Teague. Be me shoul, I am a shentleman bred and born, and dere ish my maishter. Foot. Then your master would know it ? Teague. Arrah, you fool, ish it not the saam ting? Foot. Then tell your master 'tis the young lord Wouldbe, just come to his estate by the death of his father and elder brother. [Exit. Sub. What was your master's name, pray ? Teague. [Aside.] I will tell a lee now ; but it shall be a true one. \u2014 [Aloud.] Macfadin, dear joy, was his naam. He vent over vith king Jamish into France. \u2014 [Aside.] He was my master once. Deere ish de true lee noo. Herm. Would. What do I hear ? Teague. You hear that you are dead, maishter ; fere vil you please to be buried ? Herm. Would. But art thou sure it was my brother? Sub. What employment had he ? Teague. Je ne sai pas. Sub. What, can you speak French ? Teague. Oui, monsieur, I did travel France, and Spain, and Italy. Dear joy, I did kish the pope's toe, and dat will excuse me all the sins of my life ; and fen I am dead, St. Patrick will excuse tie rest. Teague. Be me shoul it was him nown self ; I know'd him fery well, after his man told me. Herm. Would. The business requires that I be convinced with my own eyes ; I'll follow him, and know the bottom on't. \u2014 Stay here till I return. Teague. Dear maishter, have a care upon your shelf: now they know you are dead, by my shoul they may kill you. Herm. Would. Don't fear ; none of his servants know me, and I'll take care to keep my face from his sight. It concerns me to conceal myself, till I know the engines of this contrivance. \u2014 Be sure you stay till I come to you ; and let nobody know whom you belong to. [Exit. Teague. Oh, ho, hon, poor Teague is left all alone ! [Sits on the portmantle. Sub. [Aside.] A rare fellow for my purpose ' \u2014 [Aloud.] Thou lookest like an honest fellow; and if you'll go with me to the next tavern. I'll give thee a dinner, and a glass of wine. Teague. Be me shoul, 'tis dat I wanted, dear joy ; come along, I will follow you. [Runs out with the portmantle on his back, Subtleman following. Re-enter Hermes Woui.dbe. Herm. Would. My father dead ! my birthright lost 1 How have my drowsy stars slept o'er my fortune? \u2014 Ha! \u2014 [Looking about] my servant gone ! The simple, poor, ungrateful wretch has left me. I took him up from poverty and want ; and now he leaves me just as I found him. My clothes and money too ! \u2014 But why should I repine? Let man but view the dangers he has passed, and few will fear what hazards are to come. That Providence that has secured my life from robbers, shipwreck, and from sickness, is still the same ; still kind whilst I am just. My death, I find, is firmly believed ; but how it gained so universal credit I fain would learn.\u2014 Who comes here ? \u2014 honest Mr. Fairbank ! my father's goldsmith, a man of substance and integrity. The alteration of five years* absence, with the report of my death, may shade me from his knowledge, till I inquire some news. Enter Subtleman and Clearaccount. Sub. And you won't swear to the will ? Clear. My conscience tells me I dare not do't with safety. Sub. But if we make it lawful, what should you fear ? We now think nothing against conscience, till the cause be thrown out of court. Clear. In you, sir, 'tis no sin ; because 'tis the principle of your profession : but in me, sir, 'tis downright perjury indeed. You can't want wit nesses enough, since money won't be wanting, and you must lose no time ; for I heard just now, that the true lord Wouldbe was seen in town, or his ghost. Sub. It was his ghost, to be sure ; for a noble man without an estate is but the shadow of a lord. Well, take no care ; leave me to myself; I'm near the Friars, and ten to one shall pick up an evi dence. Enter Fairbank. Sir, your humble servant ! Fair. Sir, I don't know you. [Shunning him. Herm. Would. I intend you no harm, sir; but seeing you come from my lord Wouldbe's house, I would ask you a question or two. \u2014 Pray what dis temper did my lord die of? Fair. I am told it was an apoplexy. Herm. Would. And pray, sir, what does the world say ? is his death lamented ? Fair. Lamented I my eyes that question should resolve ; friend, thou knewest him not : else thy own heart had answered thee. Clear. Speed you well, sir 1 [Exit. Sub. There's a fellow that has hunger and the gallows pictured in his face, and looks like my countryman. \u2014 How now, honest friend, what have you got under you there ? Teague. Noting, dear joy. Sub. Nothing ? is it not a portmantle ? Teague. That is noting to you. Sub. The fellow's a wit. Teague. Fet am I ; my grandfader was an Irish poet. He did write a great book of verses concerning the vars between St. Patrick and the wolf-dogs. Sub. Then thou art poor, I'm afraid? Teague. Be me shoul, my sole generation ish so. I have noting but thish poor ponmantle, and dat itshelf ish not my own. Sub. Why, who does it belong to ? Herm. Would. [Aside.] His grief, methinks, chides my defect of filial duty. \u2014 [Aloud.] But, I hope, sir, his loss is partly recompensed in the merits of his successor. Fair. It might have been ; but his eldest son, heir to his virtue and bis honour, was lately and unfortunately killed in Germany."], [693, "THE TWIN-RIVALS. SCENE III. 599 Herm. Would. How unfortunately, sir ? Fair. Unfortunately for him and us. I do remember him. He was the mildest, humblest, sweetest youth \u2014 Herm. Would. [Aside.] Happy indeed had been my part in life if I had left this human stage whilst this so spotless and so fair applause had crowned my going off. \u2014 [Aloud.] Well, sir. Fair. But those that saw him in his travels, told such wonders of his improvement, that the report recalled his father's years ; and with the joy to hear his Hermes praised, he oft would break the chains of gout and age ; and leaping up with strength of greenest youth, cry, Aty Hermes is myself. Me thinks I live my sprightly days again and I am young in him. Herm. Would. Spite of all modesty, a man must own a pleasure in the hearing of his praise. [Aside. gentleman. Come home with me ; I am as able to give you a dinner as my lord ; and you shall be very welcome to eat at my table every day, till you are better provided. Herm. Would. [Aside.] Goodman! \u2014 [Aloud.] Sir, I must beg you to excuse me to-day : but I shall find a time to accept of your favours, or at least to thank you for 'em. Fair. Sir, you shall be very welcome whenever you please. [Exit. Herm. Would. Gramercy, citizen 1 Surely, if Justice were an herald, she would give this trades man a nobler coat of arms than my brother.\u2014 But I delay : I long to vindicate the honour of my station, and to displace this bold usurper. \u2014 But one concern methinks is nearer still, my Constance! Should she, upon the rumour of my death, have fixed her heart elsewhere, \u2014 then I were dead indeed ; but if she still proves true, \u2014 brother, sit fast. Fair. You're thoughtful, sir \u2014 had you any rela tion to the family we talk of ? Herm. Would. None, sir, beyond my private concern in the public loss. \u2014 But pray, sir, what character does the present lord bear ? Fair. Your pardon, sir. As for the dead, their memories are left unguarded, and tongues may touch them freely : but for the living, they have provided for the safety of their names by a strong inclosure of the law. There is a thing called scan dalum magnatum, sir. I'll shake your strength, all obstacles remove, Sustain'd by justice, and inspired by love. [Exit SCENE III.\u2014 Constance's Apartment. Constance and Aurelia discovered. Con. For Heaven's sake, cousin, cease your impertinent consolation ! it but makes me angry, and raises two passions in me instead of one. You see I commit no extravagance, my grief is silent enough : my tears make no noise to disturb anybody. I desire no companion in my sorrows : leave me to myself and you comfort me. Aur. But, cousin, have you.no regard to your reputation ? \u2014 This immoderate concern for a young fellow \u2014 what will the world say ? You lament him like a husband. Herm. Would. I commend your caution, sir; but be assured I intend not to entrap you. I am a poor gentleman ; and having heard much of the charity of the old lord Wouldbe, I had a mind to apply to his sou ; and therefore inquired his character. Fair. Alas ! sir, things are changed. That house was once what poverty might go a pilgrimage to seek, and have its pains rewarded. The noble lord, the truly noble lord, held his estate, his honour, and his house, as if they were only lent upon the interest of doing good to others. He kept a porter, not to exclude, but serve the poor. No creditor was seen to guard his going out, or watch his coming in : no craving eyes, but looks of smiling gratitude. But now, that family, which like a garden fairly kept invited every stranger to its fruit and shade, is now run o'er with weeds. \u2014 Nothing but wine and revelling within, a crowd of noisy creditors without, a train of servants inso lently proud.\u2014 Would you believe it, sir, as I offered to go in just now, the rude porter pushed me back with his staff. I am at this present (thanks to Providence and my industry) worth twenty thou sand pounds. I pay the fifth part of this to maintain the liberty of the nation ; and yet this slave, the impudent Swiss slave, offered to strike Herm. Would. 'Twas hard, sir, very hard : and if they used a man of your substance so roughly, how will they manage me, that am not worth a groat ? , . Fair. I would not willingly defraud your hopes of what may happen. If you can drink and sweai ; perhaps \u2014 . r , \u2022 Herm. Would. I shall not pay that price for his lordship's bounty would it extend to halt he s worth. Sir, I give you thanks for your caution, and shall steer another course. Fair. Sir, you look like an honest, modest Con. No, you mistake : I have no rule nor me thod for my grief ; no pomp of black and darkened rooms ; no formal month for visits on my bed. I am content with the slight mourning of a broken heart ; and all my form is tears. [ Wetps. Enter Mrs. Mandrake. Airs. Alan. Madam Aurelia, madam, don't dis turb her. Everything must have its vent. 'Tis a hard case to be crossed in one's first love. But you should consider, madam, [To Constance] that we are all born to die ; some young, some old- , j Con.

His nurse was a hale, well-complexioned, sprightly jade as ever I saw ; but her milk was a little too stale, though, at the same time, 'twas as blue and clear as a cambric. Aur. Do you intend all this, madam, for a con. solation to my cousin ?"], [694, "600 THE TWIN-RIVALS. ACT III. Mrs. Alan. No, no, madam, that's to come. \u2014 I tell you, fair lady, you have only lost the man ; the estate and title are still your own ; and this very moment I would salute you lady Wouldbe, if you pleased. Con. Dear madam, your proposal is very tempt ing ; let me but consider till to-morrow, and I'll give you an answer. Mrs. Alan. I knew it, I knew it ! I said, when you were born, you would be a lady ; I knew it ! To-morrow, you say? \u2014 My lord shall know it immediately. [Exit. Aur. What d'ye intend to do, cousin ? Con. To go into the country this moment, to be free from the impertinence of condolence, the per secution of that monster of a man, and that devil of a woman. O Aurelia, I long to be alone ! I am become so fond of grief, that I would fly where I might enjoy it all, and have no interruption in my darling sorrow. Herm. Would. That my dear brother must do ; for he made the enigma. Aur. Methinks I stand here like a fool all this while ! would I had somebody or other to say a fine thing or two to me ! Herm. Would. Madam, I beg ten thousand pardons ! I have my excuse in my hand. Aur. My lord, I wish you joy ! Herm. Would. Pray, madam, don't trouble me with a title till I am better equipped for it. My peerage would look a little shabby in these robes. Con. You have a good excuse, my lord : you can wear better when you please. Herm. Would. I have a better excuse, madam : these are the best I have. Con. How, my lord ? Herm. Would. Very true, madam ; I am at present, I believe, the poorest peer in England. \u2014 Heark'ee, Aurelia, prithee lend me a piece or two. Aur. Ha ! ha ! ha ! poor peer indeed ! he wants a guinea. Con. I'm glad on't, with all my heart I Herm. Would. Why so, madam ? Con. Because I can furnish you with five thou sand. Enter Hermes Wouldbe unperceived. Herm. Would. In tears ! perhaps for me ; I'll try. [Drops a miniature, and retires behind, listening. Aur. If there be aught in grief delightful, don't grudge me a share. Con. No, my dear Aurelia, I'll engross it all. I loved him so, methinks I should be jealous if any mourned his death besides myself. What's here ! \u2014 [ Takes up the miniature.] Ha ! see, cousin\u2014 the very face and features of the man ! Sure, some officious angel has brought me this for a companion in my solitude ! Now I'm fitted out for sorrow ! With this I'll sigh, with this con verse, gaze on his image till I grow blind with weeping ! 9 Aur. I'm amazed! how came it here ? Herm. Would. Generous woman ! Enter Captain Trueman. Ha, my friend too ! True. I'm glad to find you here, my lord. Here's a current report about town that you were killed. I was afraid it might reach this family ; so I came to disprove the story by your letter to me by the last post. Aur. I'm glad he's come ; now it will be my turn, cousin. [Aside. True. Now, my lord, I wish you joy ; and I expect the same from you. Herm. Would. With all my heart ; but upon what score ? Con. Whether by miracle or human chance, 'tis all alike ; I have it here : nor shall it ever separate from my breast. It is the only thing could give me joy, because it will increase my grief. Herm. Would. [Coming forward.] Most glo rious woman ! now I am fond of life. True. The old score \u2014 marriage. Herm. Would. To whom ? True. To a neighbour lady here. [Looking at Aurelia. Aur.

Most wondrous are the works of fate for man ; and most closely laid is the ser pentine line that guides him into happiness 1 That hidden power which did permit those arts to cheat me of my birthright, had this surprise of happiness in store, well knowing that grief is the best pre parative for joy.

Come in, cries I ; and presently enters Mr. Moabite, followed by a snug chair, the windows close drawn, and in it a fine young virgin just upon the point of being delivered. We were all in a great hurly-burly for a while, to be sure ; but our production was a fine boy. I had fifty guineas for my trouble, the lady was wrapped up very warm, placed in her chair, and reconveyed to the place she came from. Who she was, or what she was, I could never learn, though my maid said that the chair went through the Park \u2014 but the child was left with me. The father would have made a Jew on't presently, but I swore, if he committed such a barbarity on the infant, that I would discover all. So I had him brought up a good Christian, and bound prentice to an attorney. Ben. Would. Very well ! Airs. Afan. Ah, my lord ! there's many a pretty fellow in London that knows as little of their true father and mother as he does : I have had several such jobs in my time ; \u2014 there was one Scotch nobleman that brought me four in half a-year.

I can be a knave as well as you, fen I think it con veniency. Herm. Would. Now, brother ! \u2014 Speechless ! \u2014 Your oracle too silenced ! \u2014 Is all your boasted fortune sunk to the guilty blushing for a crime ? \u2014 But I scorn to insult : let disappointment be your punishment. \u2014 But for your lawyer there \u2014 Teague, lay hold of him.

I'll order Mr. Clear account to give you a thousand pounds. Go take it, and pay me by your absence. Ben. Would. I scorn your beggarly benevolence ! had my designs succeeded, 1 would not have allowed you the weight of a wafer, and therefore will accept none. \u2014 As for that lawyer, he deserves to be pilloried, not for his cunning in deceiving you, but for his ignorance in betraying me.

[Kneeling.] My lord ! my dear lord Wouldbe, I beg you ten thousand pardons ! Ben. Would. What offence hast thou done to me ? Airs. Man. An offence the most injurious. I have hitherto concealed a secret in my breast to the offence of justice, and the defrauding your lordship of your true right and title.

My deceased lord, upon the sight of your deformity, engaged me, by a considerable reward, to say you were the last born, that the beautiful twin, likely to be the greater ornament to the family, might succeed him in his honour. This secret my con science has long struggled with.

Had I not come out that moment, you would have sneaked off ; your brother had been in possession, and then we had lost all ; but now you are estab lished : possession gets you money, that gets you law, and law, you know \u2014 Down on your knees, sirrah, and ask me blessing. Ben. Would. No, my dear mother, I'll give thee a blessing, a rent- charge of five hundred pound a year, upon what part of the estate you will, during your life. Mrs. Alan. Thank you, my lord : that five hundred a year will afford me a leisurely life, and a handsome retirement in the country, where I mean to repent me of my sins, and die a good Christian : for, Heaven knows, I am old, and ought to bethink me of another life Have you none of the cordial left that we had in the morn ing ?

No, I had but ten. Aur. That is, in plain terms, your sufficiency will presume much longer than my honour can resist.

[Aside.] Since my money won't prevail on this cross fellow, I'll try what my authority can do. \u2014 [Aloud.] What's the meaning of this riot, constable ? I have the commission of the peace, and can command you. Go about your business, and leave your prisoners with me. True. No, sir ; the prisoners shall go about their business, and I'll be left with you. \u2014 Look'ee, master, we don't use to make up these matters before company : so you and I must be in private a little. \u2014 You say, sir, that you are a justice of peace ? Rich. Yes, sir; I have my commission in my pocket. True. I believe it. \u2014 Now, sir, one good turn deserves another : and, if you will promise to do me a kindness, why, you shall have as good as you bring. Rich. What is it? Aur. Dear Mr. Constable \u2014 had you \u2014 staid but a moment longer \u2014 I had been ruined. True. [Aside.] Aurelia ! \u2014 [Aloud] Are you safe, madam ? Aur. Yes, yes; I am safe \u2014 I think \u2014 but with enough ado : he's a devilish strong fellow. True. Where is the villain that attempted it ? Aur. Psha ! \u2014 never mind the villain ; \u2014 look out the woman of the house, the devil, the monster, that decoyed me hither. Enter Teague, haling in Mrs. Mandrake by the hair. Teague. Be me shoul, I have taaken my shaare of the plunder. Let me she fat I have gotten. \u2014 [Takes her to the light.] Ububboo, a witch! a witch ! the very saame witch dat would swear my maishter was the youngest. True. [ Aside.] How ! Mandrake ! this was the luckiest disguise \u2014 [Aloud.] Come, my dear Pro serpine, I'll take care of you. Mrs. Alan. Pray, sir, let me speak with you. True. No, no ; I'll talk with you before a magistrate. \u2014 A cart, Bridewell, \u2014 you understand me ? \u2014 Teague, let her be your prisoner : I'll wait on this lady. Aur. Mr. Constable, I'll reward you. Teague. It ish convenient noo by the law of armsh, that I search my prishoner, for fear she may have some pocket-pishtols. \u2014 Dere is a joak for you ! [Searches her pockets. Mrs. Man. Ah ! don't use an old woman so barbarously. True. You must know, sir, there is a neighbour's daughter that I had a woundy kindness for. She had a very good repute all over the parish, and might have married very handsomely, that I must say ; but, I don't know how, we came together after a very kindly, natural manner, and I swore, that I must say, I did swear confoundedly, that I would marry her ; but, I don't know how, I never cared for marrying of her since. Rich. How so ? True. Why, because I did my business without it : that was the best way, I thought. The truth is, she has some foolish reasons to say she's with child, and threatens mainly to have me taken up with a warrant, and brought before a justice of peace. Now, sir, I intend to come before you, and I hope your worship will bring me off. Rich. Look'ee, sir, if the woman prove with child, and you swore to marry her, you must do't. True. Ay, master ; but I am for liberty and property. I vote for parliament men : I pay taxes, and, truly, I don't think matrimony con sistent with the liberty of the subject. Rich. But, in this case, sir, both law and justice will oblige you. True. Why, if it be the law of the land\u2014 I found a letter here \u2014 I think it is for your worship. Rich. Ay, sir ; how came you by it ? True. By a very strange accident truly. \u2014 Clelia \u2014 she says here you swore to marry her. Eh ! \u2014 Now, sir, I suppose that what is law for a petty constable may be law for a justice of peace. Rich. This is the oddest fellow \u2014 Teague. Dear joy, den fy vere you an old woman ? dat is your salt, not mine, joy ! \u2014 Uboo, here ish nothing but scribble-scrabble papers, I tink. [Pulls out a handful of letters. True. Let me see 'em ; they may be of use. \u2014 [Looks over the letters.] For Air. Richmore \u2014 Ay ! does he traffic hereabouts ? Aur. That is the villain that would have abused me. True. [Aside.] Ha ! then he has abused you ? Villain indeed ! \u2014 [Aloud.] Was his name Rich more, mistress ? a lusty, handsome man ? Aur. Ay, ay, the very same : a lusty, ugly fellow. True. Let me see \u2014 [Opening a letter] whose scrawl is this ? \u2014 [Aside-] Death and confusion to my sight ! Clelia, my bride, his whore ! \u2014 I've passed a precipice unseen, which to look back upon, shivers me with terror. \u2014 This night, this very moment, had not my friend been in confine ment, had not I worn this dress, had not Aurelia been in danger, had not Teague found this letter, had the least minutest circumstance been omitted, what a monster had I been! \u2014 [Aloud.] Mistress, is this same Richmore in the house still, think'ee? True. Here was the t'other lady that cried out so \u2014 I warrant now, if I were brought before you for ravishing a woman \u2014 the gallows would ravish me for't. Rich. But I did not ravish her. True. That I'm glad to hear : I wanted to be sure of that. [Aside. Aur. 'Tis very probable he may. True. Very well. \u2014 Teague, take these ladies over to the tavern, and stay there till I come to Rich.

He's just a-coming up, madam. [Exit. Con. My civility to this man will be as great a constraint upon me as rudeness would be to his brother : but I must bear it a little, because our designs require it. Enter Benjamin Wouldbe. \u2014 [Aside.] His appearance shocks me. \u2014 [Aloud.] My lord, I wish you joy. Ben. Would. Madam, 'tis only in your power to give it ; and would yon honour me with a title to be really proud of, it should be that of your hum blest servant. Rich. I'll give thee half my estate. True. Mercenary ! Rich. I'll make thee my sole heir. True. I despise it. Rich. What shall I do ? True. You shall \u2014 marry Clelia. Rich. How ! that's too hard. Con. I never admitted anybody to the title of an humble servant, that I did not intend should command me ; if your lordship will bear with the slavery, you shall begin when you please, provided you take upon you the authority when I have a mind. True. Too hard ! why was it then imposed on me? If you marry her yourself, I shall believe you intended rae no injury ; so your behaviour will be justified, my resentment appeased, and the lady's honour repaired. Rich. 'Tis infamous. Ben. Would. Our sex, madam, make much bet ter lovers than husbands ; and I think it highly unreasonable, that you should put yourself in my power, when you can so absolutely keep me in yours. True. No, by Heavens, 'tis justice ! and what is just is honourable : if promises from man to man have force, why not from man to woman ? Their very weakness is the charter of their power, and they should not be injured because they can't return it. Con. No, my lord, we never truly command till we have given our promise to obey ; and we are never in more danger of being made slaves, than when we have 'em at our feet. Rich. Return my sword. True. In my hand 'tis the sword of justice, and I should not part with it. Rich. Then sheathe it here, I'll die before I consent so basely. Ben. Would. True, madam, the greatest empires are in most danger of falling ; but it is better to be absolute there, than to act by a prerogative that's confined. Con. Well, well, my lord, I like the constitution we live under ; I'm for a limited power, or none at all. True. Consider, sir, the sword is worn for a distinguishing mark of honour : promise me one, and receive t'other. Ben. Would. You have so much the heart of the subject, madam, that you may rule as you please ; but you have weak pretences to a limited sway, where your eyes have already played the tyrant. \u2014 I think one privilege of the people is to kiss their sovereign's hand. [Taking her hand. Con. Not till they have taken the oaths, my lord ; and he that refuses them in the form the law prescribes, is, I think, no better than a rebel. Ben. Would.

I scorn to be compelled even to justice ; and now, that I may resist, I yield. Trueman, I have injured thee, and Clelia I have severely wronged. True.

My lord, a word. \u2014 [Whispers Hermes Wouldbe.] Now, gentlemen, please to hear this venerable lady. [Goes to the door, and brings in Mrs. Mandrake. Herm. Would. Mandrake in custody ! Teague.

Then I must own, (Heaven forgive me !) \u2014 [ Weeping] I must own, that Hermes, as he was still esteemed, so be is the first-born. Teague. A very honesht woman, be me shoule ! Ben. Would. That confession is extorted by fear, and therefore of no force. True. Ay, sir ; but here is your letter to her, with the ink scarce dry, where you repeat your offer of five hundred pound a year to swear in your behalf. Ben. Would. Yours will be the conquest, and I shall despise all the world but you. Con. But will you promise to make no attempts upon my honour? Ben. Would. [Aside.] That's foolish.\u2014 [Aloud.] Not angels sent on messages to earth shall visit with more innocence. Con. [Aside.] Ay, ay, to be sure. \u2014 [Aloud.] My lord, I'll send one to conduct you. [Exit. Ben. Would. Ha ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 no attempts upon her honour ! When I can find the place where it lies, I'll tell her more of my mind. \u2014 Now do I feel ten thousand Cupids tickling me all over with the points of their arrows. \u2014 Where's my deformity now ?

How ! my hopes deceived ! \u2014 Cursed be the fair delusions of her sex ! whilst only man opposed my cunning, I stood secure ; but soon as woman interposed, luck changed hands, and the devil was immediately on her side. \u2014 Well, sir, much good may do you with your mistress, and may you love, and live, and starve together. [Going. Herm. Would. Hold, sir ! I was lately your prisoner, now you are mine ; when the ejectment is executed, you shall be at liberty. Ben. Would. Ejectment ! Herm. Would. Yes, sir, by this time, I hope, my friends have purged my father's house of that debauched and riotous swarm that you had hived together. Con. Bless me, cousin, marry a constable ! Aur. Why truly, madam, if that constable had not come in a very critical minute, by this time I had been glad to marry anybody. True. I take you at your word, madam, you shall marry him this moment ; and if you don't say that I have genteel blood in my veins by to-morrow morning \u2014 Aur. And was it you, sir ? True. Look'ee, madam, don't be ashamed ; I found you a little in the dishabille', that's the truth on't, but you made a brave defence. Aur. I am obliged to you ; and though you were a little whimsical to-day, this late adventure has taught me how dangerous it is to provoke a gentleman by ill usage ; therefore, if my lord and this lady will show us a good example, I think we must follow our leaders, captain. True. As boldly as when honour calls. Con. My lord, there was taken among your brother's jovial crew, his friend Subtleman, whom we have taken care to secure. Ben. Would.

My Lords and Gentlemen, \u2014 Instead of the mercenary expectations that attend addresses of this nature, I hmroly beg, that this may be received as an acknowledgment for the favours you have already conferred. I have transgressed the rules of dedication in offering you anything in that style, without first asking your leave : but the entertainment I found in Shropshire commands me to be grateful, and that's all I intend. \"Twas my good fortune to be ordered some time ago into the place which is made the scene of this comedy ; I was a perfect stranger to everything in Salop, but its character of loyalty, the number of its inhabitants, the alacrity of the gentlemen in recruiting the army, with their generous and hospitable reception of strangers. This character I found so amply verified in every particular, that you made recruiting, which is the greatest fatigue upon earth to others, to be the greatest pleasure in the world to me. The kingdom cannot show better bodies of men, better inclinations for the service, more generosity, more good understanding, nor more politeness, than is to be found at the foot of the Wrekin. Some little turns of humour that I met with almost within the shade of that famous hill, gave the rise to this comedy; and people were apprehensive that, by the example of some others, I would make the town merry at the expense of the country-gentlemen. But they forgot that I was to write a comedy, not a libel ; and that whilst I held to nature, no person of any character in your country could suffer by being exposed. I have drawn the justice and the clown in their puris naturalibus ; the one an apprehensive, sturdy, brave blockhead ; and the other a worthy, honest, generous gentleman, hearty in his country's cause, and of as good an understanding as I could give him, which I must confess is far short of his own. I humbly beg leave to interline a word or two of the adventures of the Recruiting Officer upon the stage. Mr. Rich, who commands the company for which those recruits were raised, has desired me to acquit him before the world of a charge which he thinks lies heavy upon him, for acting this play on Mr. Durfey's third night. Bo it known unto all men by these presents, that it was my act and deed, or rather Mr. Durfey's ; for he would play his third night against the first of mine. He brought down a huge flight of frightful birds upon me ; when (Heaven knows !) I had not a feathered fowl in my play, except one single Kite ; but I presently made Plume a bird, because of his name, and Brazen another, because of the feather in his hat ; and with these three I engaged his whole empire, which I think was as great a Wonder as any in the Sun. But to answer his complaints more gravely, the season was far advanced ; the officers that made the greatest figures in my play were all commanded to their posts abroad, and waited only for a wind, which might possibly turn in less time than a day : and I know none of Mr. Durfey's birds that had posts abroad but his Woodcocks, and their season is over ; so that he might put off a day with less prejudice than the Recruiting Officer could ; who has this farther to say for himself, that he was posted before the other spoke, and could not with credit recede from his station. These and some other rubs this comedy met with before it appeared. But on the other hand, it had powerful helps to set it forward. The Duke of Ormond encouraged the author, and the Earl of Orrery approved the play. My recruits were reviewed by my general and my colonel, and could not fail to pass muster ; and still to add to my success, they were raised among my friends round the Wrekin. This health has the advantage over our other celebrated toasts, never to grow worse for the wearing : 'tis a lasting beauty, old without age, and common without scandal. That you may live long to set it cheerfully round, and to enjoy the abundant pleasures of your fair and plentiful country, is the hearty wish of, my Lords and Gentlemen, your most obliged, and most obedient servant, G.

Yes, yes, sir, and my fame's all about the country for the most famous fortune-teller that ever told a lie. \u2014 I was obliged to let my landlord into the secret, for the convenience of keeping it so ; but he's an honest fellow, and will be trusty to any roguery that is confided to him. This device, sir, will get you men, and me money, which, I think, is all we want at present. \u2014 But yonder comes your friend Mr. Worthy. \u2014 Has your honour any farther commands ? Re-enter Serjeant Kite. Kite. Welcome to Shrewsbury, noble captain ! From the banks of the Danube to the Severn side, noble captain, you're welcome ! Plume. A very elegant reception indeed, Mr. Kite ! I find you are fairly entered into your re cruiting strain : pray, what success ? Kite. I have been here but a week, and I have recruited five. Plume. Five ! pray what are they ? Kite. I have listed the strong man of Kent, the king of the gipsies, a Scotch pedlar, a scoundrel attorney, and a Welsh parson. Plume. An attorney ! wert thou mad ? List a lawyer ! Discharge him, discharge him this minute. Kile. Wrhy, sir ? Plume. Because I will have nobody in my com pany that can write ; a fellow that can write, can draw petitions. \u2014 I say this minute discharge him. Kite. And what shall I do with the parson ? Plume. Can he write ? Plume. None at present. \u2014 [Exit Serjeant Kite,] 'Tis indeed the picture of Worthy, but the life's departed. Enter Mr. Worthy. What ! arms a-cross, Worthy ! Methinks, you should hold 'em open when a friend's so near. \u2014 The man has got the vapours in his ears, I believe : I must expel this melancholy spirit.

Keep him by all means. \u2014 But how stands the country affected ? were the people pleased with the news of my coming to town ? Kite. Sir, the mob are so pleased with your honour, and the justices and better sort of people are so delighted with me, that we shall soon do our business. \u2014 But, sir, you have got a recruit here that you little think of. Plume. Who ? Wor. Plume ! my dear captain, welcome. Safe and sound returned ? Plume. I 'scaped safe from Germany, and sound, I hope, from London ; you see 1 have lost neither leg, arm, nor nose ; then for my inside, 'tis neither troubled with sympathies nor antipa thies; and I have an excellent stomach for roast beef. Wor. Thou art a happy fellow ; once I was so. Plume. What ails thee, man ? No inundations Kite. One that you beat up for last time you were in the country : you remember your old friend Molly at the Castle ? Plume. She's not with child, I hope? Kite. No, no, sir \u2014 she was brought to bed yes terday. nor earthquakes in Wales, 1 hope ? Has your father rose from the dead, and reassumed his estate ? Wor. No. Plume. Then you are married surely ?

And, pray, what is all this for? Wor. For a woman. Kite. Ay, or unmake it upon occasion. But your honour knows that I am married already. Plume. To how many ? Kite. I can't tell readily \u2014 I have set them down here upon the back of the muster-roll. \u2014 [Draws it oui ] Let me see, \u2014 Imprimis, Mrs. Sheely Snike reyes ; she sells potatoes upon Ormond Key in Dublin \u2014 Peggy Guzzle, the brandy-woman at the Horse-guard at Whitehall \u2014 Dolly Waggon, the carrier's daughter at Hull \u2014 Mademoiselle Van- Bottomflat at the Buss. \u2014 Then Jenny Oakham, the ship-carpenter's widow, at Portsmouth ; but I don't reckon upon her, for she was married at the same time to two lieutenants of marines, and a man-of-war's boatswain. Plume. Shake hands, brother ; if you go to that, behold me as obsequious, as thoughtful, and as constant a coxcomb as your worship. Wor. For whom ? Plume. For a regiment. \u2014 But for a woman ! \u2014 'Sdeath ! I have been constant to fifteen at a time, but never melancholy for one ; and can the love of one bring you into this pickle ? Pray, who is this miraculous Helen ? Wor. A Helen indeed, not to be won under a ten years' siege, as great a beauty, and as great a jilt. Plume. A jilt ! pho ! is she as great a whore ? Wor. No, no. Plume. A full company ! \u2014 You have named five \u2014 come, make 'em half-a-dozen, Kite. Is the child a boy or a girl ? Plume. 'Tis ten thousand pities. But who is she ? do I know her ? Wor.

Suppose I married a woman that wanted a leg ! such a thing might be, unless I examined the goods beforehand. If people would but try one another's constitutions before they engaged, it would prevent all these elopements, divorces, and the devil knows what. Wor. I did, and she hearkened to't, desiring only one week to consider : when, beyond her hopes, the town was relieved, and I forced to turn my siege into a blockade. Plume. Explain, explain ! Wor. My lady Richly, her aunt, in Flintshire dies, and leaves her, at this critical time, twenty thousand pounds. Plume. Oh, the devil ! what a delicate woman was there spoiled ! But, by the rules of war now, Worthy, your blockade was foolish. After such a convoy of provisions was entered the place, you could have no thought of reducing it by famine ; you should have redoubled your attacks, taken the town by storm, or have died upon the breach. Wor. I did make one general assault, and pushed it with all my forces ; but I was so vigor ously repulsed, that, despairing of ever gaining her for a mistress, 1 have altered my conduct, given my addresses the obsequious and distant turn, and court her now for a wife. Wor. Nay, for that matter, the town did not stick to say, that \u2014 Plume. I hate country towns for that reason. If your town has a dishonourable thought of Silvia it deserves to be burned to the ground. I love Silvia, I admire her frapk, geoerous disposition. There's something in that girl more than woman, her sex is but a foil to her. The ingratitude, dis simulation, envy, pride, avarice, and vanity of her sister females, do but set off their contraries in her. In short, were I once a general I would marry her. Wor. Faith, you have reason ; for were you but a corporal she would marry you. But my Melinda coquettes it with every fellow she sees. I'll lay fifty pound she makes love to you. Plume. I'll lay fifty pound that I return it, if she does. Look'ee, Worthy, I'll win her, and give her to you afterwards. Wor. If you win her you shall wear her, faith ; I would not give a fig for the conquest without the credit of the victory. Plume. So as you grew obsequious, she grew haughty ; and because you approached her as a goddess, she used you like a dog ? Wor. Exactly. Plume. 'Tis the way of 'em all. Come, Wor thy, your obsequious and distant airs will never bring you together ; you must not think to sur mount her pride by your humility. Would you bring her to better thoughts of you, she must be reduced to a meaner opinion of herself. Let me see ; the very first thing that I would do, should be to lie with her chambermaid, and hire three or four wenches in the neighbourhood to report that I had got them with child. Suppose we lampooned all the pretty women in town, and left her out? Or, what if we made a ball, and forgot to invite her with one or two of the ugliest ? Re-enter Serjeant Kjte. Kite. Captain, captain, a word in your ear. Plume. You may speak out, here are none but friends. Kite. You know, sir, that you sent me to com fort the good woman in the straw, Mrs. Molly \u2014 my wife, Mr. Worthy. Wor. O ho! very well! I wish you joy, Mr. Kite. Kite. Your worship very well may, for I have got both a wife and a child in half an hour. But, as I was a-saying, you sent me to comfort Mrs. Molly, my wife I mean ; but what d'ye think, sir ? she was better comforted before I came. Plume. As how ! Wor. These would be mortifications, I must confess ; but we live in such a precise, dull place, that we can have no balls, no lampoons, no \u2014 Plume. What ! no bastards ! and so many recruiting officers in town ! I thought 'twas a maxim among them to leave as many recruits in the country as they carried out. Wor. Nobody doubts your good-will, noble captain, in serving your country with your best blood ; witness our friend Molly at the Castle. There have been tears in town about that business, captain. Kite. Why, sir, a footman in a blue livery had brought her ten guineas to buy her baby-clothes. Plume. Who, in the name of wonder, could send them? Kite. Nay, sir, I must whisper that \u2014 Mrs. Silvia, [Whispers. Plume. Silvia! generous creature! Wor. Silvia ! impossible ! Kite. Here be the guineas, sir ; I took the gold as part of my wife's portion. Nay, farther, sir, she sent word that the child should be taken all imaginable care of, and that she intended to stand godmother. The same footman, as I was coming to you with this news, called after me, and told me,\" that his lady would speak with me. I went and, upon hearing that yon were come to town, she gave me half-a-guineafor thenews ; and ordered me to tell you, that justice Balance, her father, who is just come out of the country, would be glad to see you. Plume. There's a girl for you, Worthy ! Is there anything of woman in this ? No, 'tis noble and generous, manly friendship. Show me another woman that would lose an inch of her prerogative, that wav, without tears, fits, and reproaches ! The common jealousy of her sex, which is nothing but thtir avarice of pleasure, she despises; and can Plume. I hope Silvia has not heard of 't ? Wor. O sir, have you thought of her ? I began to fancy you had forgot poor Silvia. Plume. Your affairs had put my own quite out of my head. 'Tis true, Silvia and I had once agreed to go to bed together, could we have adjusted pre liminaries ; but she would have the wedding before consummation, and I was for consummation before the wedding ; we could not agree. She was a pert, obstinate fool, and would lose her maiden head her own way, so she may keep it for Plume. Wor. But do you intend to marry upon no other conditions ? Plume. Your pardon, sir, I'll marry upon no conditions at all. I f I should, 1 am resolved ne-. er to bind myself to a woman for my whole life, till I"], [710, "616 THE RECRUITING OFFICER. ACT I. part with the lover, though she dies for the man. Come, Worthy : where's the best wine? for there I'll quarter. Wor. Horton has a fresh pipe of choice Barce lona, which I would not let him pierce before, because I reserved the maidenhead of it for your welcome to town. Mel. Thou poor romantic Quixote ! Hast thou the vanity to imagine that a voung sprightly officer, that rambles over half the globe in half a year, can confine his thoughts to the little daugh ter of a country -justice, in an obscure corner of the world ? Silv. Psha ! what care I for his thoughts ? I should not like a man with confined thoughts, it shows a narrowness of soul. Constancy is but a dull sleepy quality at best, they will hardly admit it among the manly virtues ; nor do I think it deserves a place with bravery, knowledge, policy, justice, and some other qualities that are proper to that noble sex. In short, Melinda, I think a petticoat a mighty simple thing, and I am heartily tired of my sex. Mel. That is, you are tired of an appendix to our sex, that you can't so handsomely get rid of in petticoats, as if you were in breeches. O' my con science, Silvia, hadst thou been a man, thou hadst been the greatest **ake in Christendom. Silv. I should have endeavoured to know the world, which a man can never do thoroughly with out half a hundred friendships, and as many amours. But now I think on't, how stands your affair with Mr. Worthy ? Mel. He's my aversion ! Silv. Vapours ' Mel. What do you say, maaam ? Silv. I say, that you should not use that honest fellow so inhumanly. He's a gentleman of parts aud fortune ; and besides that he's my Plume's friend, and by all that's sacred, if you don't use him better, I shall expect satisfaction Mel. Satisfaction ! you begin to tancy yourself in breeches in good earnest. But to be plain with you, I like Worthy the worse for being so intimate with your captain, for I take him to be a loose. idle, unmannerly coxcomb. Silv. O madam ! you never saw him, perhaps, si nee you were mistress of twenty-thousand pound ; you only knew him when you were capitulating with Worthy for a settlement, which perhaps might encourage him to be a little loose, and un mannerly with you. Mel. What do you mean, madam ? Silv. My meaning needs no interpretation, ma dam. Plume. Let's away then. \u2014 Mr. Kite, wait on the lady with my humble service, and tell her I shall only refresh a little, and wait upon her. Wor. Hold, Kite ! \u2014 Have you seen the other recruiting-captain ? Kite. No, sir. Plume. Another ! who is he ? Wor. My rival in the first place, and the most unaccountable fellow \u2014 but I'll tell you more as we go. [Exeunt. SCENE II Melinda 's Apartment. Enter Melinda and Silvia meeting. Mel. Welcome to town, cousin Silvia, \u2014 [Salute.~] I envied you your retreat in the country ; for Shrewsbury, methinks, and all your heads of shires, are the most irregular places for living. Here we have smoke, noise, scandal, affectation, and pre tension ; in short, everything to give the spleen \u2014 and nothing to divert it. Then the air is intole rable. Silv. O madam ! I have heard the town com mended for its air. Mel. But you don't consider, Silvia, how long 1 have lived in't ! for I can assure you, that to a lady, the least nice in her constitution, no air can be good above half a year. Change of air I take to be the most agreeable of any variety in life. Silv. As you say, cousin Melinda, there are several sorts of airs. Mel. Psha ! I talk only of the air we breathe, or more properly of that we taste. Have not you, Silvia, found a vast difference in the taste of airs ? Silv. Pray, cousin, are not vapours a sort of air ? taste air ! you might as well tell me, I may feed upon air. But prithee, my dear Melinda, don't put on such an air to me. Your education and mine were just the same ; and I remember the time when we never troubled our heads about air, but when the sharp air from the Welsh mountains made our fingers ache iu a cold morning at the boarding-school. Alel. Our education, cousin, was the same, but our temperaments had nothing alike ; you have the constitution of a horse. Mel. Better it had, madam ; for methinks you are too plain. Silv. If you mean the plainness of my person, I think your ladyship as plain as me to the full. Afel. Were I sure of that, I would be glad to take up with a rakehelly officer as you do. Silv. Again ! \u2014 Look'ee, madam, you're in your own house. Silv. So far as to be troubled with neither spleen, colic, nor vapours ; I need no salts for my sto mach, no hartshorn for my head, nor wash for my complexion ; I can gallop all the morning after the hunting-horn, and all the evening after a fiddle. In short, I can do everything with my father, but drink, and shoot flying ; and I am sure, I can do everything my mother could, were I put to the trial. Alel. And if you had kept in yours, I should have excused you. Silv. Don't be troubled, madam, I shan't desire to have my visit returned. Alel. The sooner therefore you make an end of this the better. Silv. I am easily persuaded to follow my inclina tions, so, madam, your humble servant. [Exit. Mel. Saucy thing ! Mel. You are in a fair way of being put to't ; for 1 am told your captain is come to town. Silv. Ay, Melinda, he is come, and I'll take care he shan't go without a companion. Alel. You are certainly mad, cousin ! Silv. And there's a pleasure sure, in being mad, Which none hit madmen know. Enter Lucy. Lucy. What's the matter, madam z> Mel. Did you not see the proud nothing, how she swells upon the arrival of her fellow ?"], [711, "THE RECRUITING OFFICER. SCENE I. 617 Lucy. Her fellow has not been long enough arrived to occasion any great swelling, madam ; I don't believe she has seen him yet. Alel.

But I hope you have more honour than to quit the service, and she more prudence than to follow the camp ; but she's at her own disposal, she has fif teen hundred pound in her pocket, and so \u2014 Silvia, Silvia ! [Calls. Enter Justice Balance and Captain Plume. Bal. Look'ee, captain, give us but blood for our money, and you shan't want men. I remember that for some years of the last war, we had no blood nor wounds, but in the officers' mouths ; nothing for our millions but newspapers not worth a reading. Our armies did nothing but play at pri son bars, and hide and seek with the enemy ; but now ye have brought us colours, and standards, and prisoners. Ads my life, captain, get us but an other mareschal of France, and I'll go myself for a soldier. Enter Silvia Si.v. There are some letters, sir, come by the post from London ; I left them upon the table in your closet. Bal. And here is a gentleman from Germany. \u2014 [Presents Captain Plume to her.] Captain, you'll excuse me, I'll go read my letters, and wait on you. [Exit. Silv. Sir, you're welcome to England. Plume. You are indebted to me a welcome, ma dam, since the hopes of receiving it from this fair hand was the principal cause of my seeing England. Silv. I have often heard that soldiers were sincere, shall I venture to believe public report ? Plume. You may, when 'tis backed by private insurance : for I swear, madam, by the honour of my profession, that whatever dangers I went upon, it was with the hope of making myself more worthy of your esteem ; and if ever I had thoughts of pre serving my life, 'twas for the pleasure of dying at your feet. Silv. Well, well, you shall die at my feet, or where you will ; but you know, sir, there is a certain will and testament to be made beforehand. Plume. Pray, Mr. Balance, how does your fair daughter? Bal. Ah, captain ! what is my daughter to a mareschal of France ? We're upon a nobler subject, I want to have a particular description of the bat tle of Hochstadt. Plume. The battle, sir, was a very pretty battle as one should desire to see, but we were all so intent upon victory, that we never minded the battle. All that I know of the matter is, our general commanded us to beat the French, and we did so ; and if he pleases but to say the word, we'll do't again. But pray, sir, bow does Mrs. Silvia? Bal. Still upon Silvia ! For shame, captain ! you are engaged already, wedded to the war ; vic tory is your mistress, and 'tis below a soldier to think of any other. Plume. As a mistress, I confess, but as a friend, Mr. Balance. Plume. My will, madam, is made already, and there it is; [Gives her a parchment.] and if you please to open that parchment, which was drawn the evening before the battle of Blenheim, you will find whom I left my heir. Silv. [Opens the will and reads.] Mrs. Silvia Balance. \u2014 Well, Captain, this is a handsome and a substantial compliment ; but I can assure you, I am mucn better pleased with the bare knowledge of your intention, than I should have been in the possession of your legacy. But methinks, sir, you should have left something to your little boy at the Castle. Bal. Come, come, captain, never mince the matter, would not you debauch my daughter if you could ? Plume. How, sir ! I hope she's not to be debauched. Bal. Faith, but she is, sir ; and any woman in England of her age and complexion, by a man of your youth and vigour. Look'ee, captain, once I was young, and once an officer as you are ; and I can guess at your thoughts now, by what mine were then ; and I remember very well, that I would have given one of my legs to have deluded the daughter of an old plain country gentleman, as like me as I was then like you. Plume. But, sir, was that country gentleman your friend and benefactor ? Bal. Not much of that. Plume. There the comparison breaks : the favours, sir, that \u2014 Bal. Pho, I hate speeches ! If I have done you any service, captain , 'twas to please myself, for I Plume. [Aside.] That's home !\u2014 [Aloud.] My little boy ! Lack-a-day, madam, that alone may convince you 'twas none of mine. Why the girl, madam, is my serjeant's wife, and so the poor crea ture gave out that I was father, in hopes that my friends might support her in case of necessity\u2014 that was all, madam.\u2014 My boy ! no, no, no.

Heavens avert it, nothing could touch me nearer than to see that generous worthy gentleman afflicted. I'll leave you to comfort him, and be assured, that if my life and fortune can be any way serviceable to the father of my Silvia, she shall freely command both. Silv. The necessity must be very pressing that would engage me to endanger either. [Exeunt severally. dies, ah poor brother ! if he lives, ah poor sister ! 'Tis bad both ways ; I'll try again Follow my own inclinations, and break my father's heart ; or obey his commands, and break my own ? worse and worse.

[ To Servant.] Put four horses into the coach. \u2014 [Exit Servant.] Silvia ! Silv. Sir. Bal. How old were you when your mother died ? Silv. So young that I don't remember I ever had one ; and you have been so careful, so indulgent to me since, that indeed I never wanted one. SCENE II. \u2014 Another Boom in the same. Justice Balance and Silvia discovered. Silv. Whilst there is life there is hope, sir ; per haps my brother may recover. Bal. We have but little reason to expect it ; doctor Kilman acquaints me here, that before this comes to my hands, he fears I shall have no son. \u2014 Poor Owen ! \u2014 But the decree is just, I was pleased with the death of my father, because he left me an estate, and now I'm punished with the loss of an heir to inherit mine. I must now look upon you as the only hopes of my family, and I expect that the augmentation of your fortune will give you fresh thoughts, and new prospects. Silv. My desire of being punctual in my obe dience, requires that you would be plain in your commands, sir. Bal. Have I ever denied you anything you asked of me? Silv. Never that I remember. Bal. Then, Silvia, I must beg that, once in your life, you would grant me a favour. Silv. Why should you question it, sir ? Bal. I don't; but I would rather counsel than command. I don't propose this with the authority of a parent, but as the advice of your friend ; that you would take the coach this moment, and go into the country. SUv. Does this advice proceed from the contents of the letter you received just now ? Bal. No matter ; I shall be with you in three or four days, and then give you my reasons. But before you go, I expect you will make me one solemn promise. Silv. Propose the thing, sir. Bal. That you will never dispose of yourself to any man without my consent. Silv. I promise. Bal. Very well; and to be even with you, I pro mise that I will never dispose of you without your own consent ; and so, Silvia, the coach is ready ; farewell! \u2014 [Leads her to the door, and returns.'] Now she's gone, I'll examine the contents of this letter a little nearer. [Reads. Bal. The death of your brother makes you sole heiress to my estate, which you know is about twelve hundred pounds a year. This fortune gives you a fair claim to quality and a title ; you must set a just value upon yourself, and, in plain terms, think no more of captain Plume. Silv. You have often commended the gentleman, sir. Bal. And I do so still ; he's a very pretty fellow; but though I liked him well enough for a bare son in-law, I don't approve of him for an heir to my estate and family. Fifteen hundred pounds indeed I might trust in his hands, and it might do the young fellow a kindness ; but, ods my life ! twelve hundred pounds a year would ruin him \u2014 quite turn his brain ! A captain of foot worth twelve hundred pounds a year ! 'tis a prodigy in nature. Besides this, I have five or six thousand pounds in woods upon my estate; oh, that would make him stark mad ! For you must know, that all captains have a mighty aversion to timber ; they can't endure to see trees standing. Then I should have some rogue of a builder, by the help of his damned magic art, transform my noble oaks and elms into cornices, portals, sashes, birds, beasts, and devils, to adorn some magotty, new-fashioned bauble upon the Thames ; and then you should have a dog of a gardener bring a habeas corpus for my terra firma, remove it to Chelsea or Twittenham, and clap it into grass-plats and gravel-walks. Sir, My intimacy with Mr. Worthy has drawn a secret from him that he had from his friend cap tain Plume ; and my friendship and relation to your family oblige me to give you timely notice of it: the captain has dishonourable designs upon my cousin Silvia. Evils of this nature are more easily prevented than amended ; and that you would immediately send my cousin into the country, is the advice of, sir, your humble servants Melinda. W7hy the devil's in the young fellows of this age ! they are ten times worse than they were in my time. Had he made my daughter a whore, and forswore it like a gentleman, I could have almost pardoned it; but to tell tales beforehand is mon strous. Hang it, I can fetch down a woodcock or a snipe, and why not a hat and feather? I have a case Gf good pistols, and have a good mind to try. Enter Servant. Ser.

The asper sion, sir, was nothing but malice, the effect of a little quarrel between her and Mrs. Silvia. Bal. Are you sure of that, sir ? Wor. Her maid gave me the history of part of the battle just now, as she overheard it. But I hope, sir, your daughter has suffered nothing upon the account ? Apple. No, I'll be a justice of peace. Kite. A justice of peace, man ! Apple. Ay, wauns will I ; for since this pressing act, they are greater than any emperor under the sun. Kite. Done ! you are a justice of peace, and you are a king, and I am a duke ; and a rum duke, an't I ? Pear. Ay, but I'll be no king. Kite. What then? Pear. I'll be a queen. Kile. A queen ! Pear.

No, no, poor girl ; she's so afflicted with the news of her brother's death, that to avoid company she begged leave to be gone into the country. Wor. And is she gone ? Bal. I could not refuse her, she was so pressing ; the coach went from the door the minute before Kite.

I cannot forbear admiring the equality of our two fortunes. We loved two ladies, they met us half way, and just as we were upon the point of leaping into their arms, fortune drops into their laps, pride possesses their hearts, a maggot fills their heads, madness takes 'em by the tails ; they snort, kick up their heels, and away they run.

Yes, sir, I understand my business, I will say it. \u2014 You must know, sir, I was born a gipsy, and bred among that crew till I was ten year old. Th^re 1 learned canting and lying. I was bought from my mother, Cleopatra, by a certain nobleman for three pistoles ; who, liking my beauty, made me his page; there I learned impudence and pimping. I was turned off for wearing my lord's linen, and drinking my lady's ratafia ; and then turned bailiff's follower : there I learned bullying and swearing. I at last got into the army, and there I learned whoring and drinking : so that if your worship pleases to cast up the whole sum, viz. canting, lying, impudence, pimping, bullying, swearing, whoring, drinking, and a halberd, you will find the sum total amount to a recruiting serjeant. Wor. And pray, what induced you to turn soldier ? Bull. Ay, and if he ben't free for that, he shall have another man in her place. Kite.

He has the most universal acquaintance of any man living ; for he won't be alone, aud nobody will keep him com pany twice. Then he's a C\u00e6sar among the women, Veni, vidi, vici, that's all : if he has but talked with the maid, he swears he has lain with the mistress. But the most surprising part of his character is his memory, which is the most prodi gious and the most trifling in the world. Bal. I have met with such men ; and I take this good-for-nothing memory to proceed from a certain contexture of the brain, which is purely adapted to impertinencies, and there they lodge secure, the owner having no thoughts of his own to disturb them. I have known a man as perfect as a chro nologer, as to the day and year of most important transactions, but be altogether ignorant of the causes, springs, or consequences of any one thing of moment. I have known another acquire so much by travel, as to tell you the names of most places in Europe, with their distances of miles, leagues, or hours, as punctually as a postboy ; but for any thing else, as ignorant as the horse that carries the mail.

And pray, was it a ring, or buckle, or pen dants, or knots ? or, in what shape was the al mighty gold transformed, that has bribed you so much in his favour ? Lucy. Indeed, madam, the last bribe I had was from the captain, and that was only a small piece of Flanders edging for pinners. Mel. Ay, Flanders lace is as constant a present from officers to their women, as something else is from their women to them. They every year bring over a cargo of lace, to cheat the queen of her duty, and her subjects of their honesty. Lucy. They only barter one sort of prohibited goods for another, madam. Mel. Has any of 'em been bartering with you, Mrs. Pert, that you talk so like a trader? Lucy. Madam, you talk as peevishly to me, as if it were my fault ; the crime is none of mine, though I pretend to excuse it : though he should not see you this week, can I help it ? But as I was saying, madam \u2014 bis friend, captain Plume, has so taken him up these two days. Mel. Psha! would his friend, the captain, were tied upon his back ! I warrant, he has never been sober since that confounded captain came to town. The devil take all officers, I say ! they do the nation more harm by debauching us at home, than they do good by defending us abroad. No sooner a captain comes to town, but all the young fellows flock about him, and we can't keep a man to ourselves. Enter Mr. Worthy. Mel.

Recruiting and elections are rare friends to the excise. Wor. You an't drunk ? Plume. No, no, whimsical only ; I could be mighty foolish, and fancy myself mighty witty. Reason still keeps its throne, but it nods a little, that's all. Lucy. One would imagine, madam, by your concern for Worthy's absence, that you should use him better when he's with you. Mel.

Look'ee, I'm a great woman, and will provide for my relations. I told the captain how finely he could play upon the tabor and pipe, so he has set him down for drum- major. Bull.

Nay, for that matter, I am not so simple as to say that I can do anything with the captain but what I may do with anybody else. Silv. So ! and pray what do you expect from this captain, child ? Rose. I expect, sir, \u2014 I expect \u2014 but he ordered me to tell nobody But suppose that he should promise to marry me ? Silv. You should have a care, my dear, men will promise anything beforehand.

Yes, yes.\u2014 [Exeunt Rose and Bul lock.] And now, sir, here are your forty shillings. Silv. Captain Plume, I despise your listing money ; if I do serve, 'tis purely for love \u2014 of that wench, I mean. For you must know, that, among my other sallies, I have spent the best part of my fortune in search of a maid, and could never find one hitherto : so you may be assured I'd not sell my freedom under a less purchase than I did my estate. So, before I list, I must be certified that this girl is a virgin. Bull. Wauns, Ruose, what have you said ? Silv. Afterwards ! after what ? Rose. After I had sold him my chickens. \u2014 I hope there's no harm in that. Enter Captain Plume Plume. What, Mr. Wilful, so close with my market-woman ! Silv. [Aside.] I'll try if he loves her. \u2014 [Aloud.] Close, sir ! ay, and closer yet, sir Come, my pretty maid, you and I will withdraw a little. Plume. No, no, friend, Ihan't done with her yet. Silv- Nor have I begun with her, so I have as good right as you have. Plume. Thou art a bloody impudent fellow. Silv. Sir, I would qualify myself for the service. Plume. Hast thou really a mind to the service ? Silv. Yes, sir : so let her go . Rose. Pray, gentlemen, don't be so violent. Plume. Come, leave it to the girl's own choice. \u2014 Will you belong to me or to that gentleman ? Rose. Let me consider, you are both very hand some. Plume. Mr. Wilful, I can't tell you how you can be certified in that point till you try ; but, upon my honour, she may be a vestal for aught that I know to the contrary. I gained her heart, indeed, by some trifling presents and promises, and, knowing that the best security for a woman's soul is her body, I would have made myself master of that too, had not the jealousy of my imperti nent landlady interposed. Silv. So you only want an opportunity foi accomplishing your designs upon her ? Plume. Not at all ; I have already gained my ends, which were only the drawing in one or two of her followers. The women, you know, are the loadstones everywhere ; gain the wives, and you are caressed by the husbands; please the mistresses, and you are valued by the gallants ; secure an interest with the finest women at court, and you procure the favour of the greatest men : so, kiss the prettiest country wenches, and you are sure of listing the lustiest fellows. Some people may call this artifice, but I term it stratagem, since it is so main a part of the service. Besides, the fatigue of recruiting is so intolerable, that, unless we could make ourselves some pleasure amidst the pain, no mortal man would be able to bear it. Silv. Well, sir, I am satisfied as to the point in debate ; but now let me beg you to lay aside your recruiting airs, put on the man of honour, and tell me plainly what usage I must expect when I am under your command. Plume. You must know, in the first place, then, that I hate to have gentlemen in my company ; for they are always troublesome and expensive, some times dangerous ; and 'tis a constant maxim amongst us, that those who know the least obey the best. Notwithstanding all this, I find some thing so agreeable about you, that engages me to court your company ; and I can't tell how it is, but I should be uneasy to see you under the com mand of anybody else. Your usage will chiefly depend upon your behaviour; only this you mus expect, that if you commit a small fault I will excuse it, if a great one I'll discharge you ; for something tells me I shall not be able to pumsh Plume. Now the natural unconstancy of her sex begins to work. [Aside. [Aside. Rose. Pray, sir, what will you give me ? Bull. Don't be angry, sir, that my sister should be mercenary, for she's but young. Silv. Give thee, child ! I'll set thee above scan dal ; you shall have a coach with six before and six behind, an equipage to make vice fashionable, and put virtue out of countenance. Plume. Pho ! that's easily done. \u2014 I'll do more for thee, child, I'll buy you a furbelow scarf, and give you a ticket to see a play. Bull. A play! Wauns, Ruose, take the ticket, and let's see the show. Silv- Look'ee, captain, if you won't resign, I'll go list with captain Brazen this minute. Plume. Will you list with me if I give up my title? Silv. I will. Plume. Take her : I'll change a woman for a man at any time. Rose. I have heard before, indeed, that you captains used to sell your men. Bull. Pray, captain, do not send Ruose to the West Indies. [\u00bb\u2022\u00ab. Plume. Hal ha! ha! West Indies !\u2014 No, no, my honest lad, give me thy hand ; nor you nor she shall move a step farther than I do. This gentle man is one of us, and will be kind to you, Mrs. Rose. Rose. But will you be so kind to me, sir, as the captain would ?

That fellow is certainly the devil, or one of his bosom favourites, he has told me the most surprising things of my past life \u2014 Lucy. Things past, madam, can hardly be reck oned surprising, because we know them already. Did he tell you anything surprising that was to come ? Mel. One thing very surprising ; he said I should die a maid ! Silv. One favour I must beg.

You ! why, 1 passed for you. Lucy. So 'tis I that am to die a maid ! \u2014 But the devil was a liar from the beginning ; he can't make me die a maid. \u2014 [Aside.] I have put it out of his power already. Mel. I do but jest, I would have passed for you, and called myself Lucy ; but he presently told me my name, my quality, my fortune, and gave me the whole history of my life. He told me of a lover I had in this country, and described Worthy exactly, but in nothing so well as in his present indifference. I fled to him for refuge here to-day; he never so much as encouraged me in ray fright, but coldly told me that he was sorry for the accident, because it might give the town cause to censure my con duct ; excused his not waiting on me home, made me a careless bow, and walked off. 'Sdeath 1 I could have stabbed him, or myself, 'twas the same thing Yonder he comes \u2014 I will so use him ! Lucy. Don't exasperate him ; consider what the fortune-teller told you. Men are scarce, and as times go, it is not impossible for a woman to die a maid. Mel. No matter. Plume. What you please as to that. \u2014 Will you lodge at my quarters in the mean time ? you shall have part of my bed. Silv. O fy ! lie with a common soldier ! Would not you rather lie with a common woman ? Plume. No, faith, I'm not that rake that the world imagines; I have got an air of freedom, which people mistake for lewdness in me, as they mis take formality in others for religion. The world is all a cheat ; only I take mine, which is undesigned, to be more excusable than theirs which is hypocri tical. I hurt nobody but myself, and they abuse all mankind.- \u2014 Will you lie with me ? Silv. No, no, captain, you forget Rose ; she's to be my bedfellow, you know. Plume.

There's Leo, Sagit tarius, Forceps, Furnes, Dixmude.Namur, Brussels, Charleroy, and so forth \u2014 twelve of 'em. \u2014 Let me see \u2014 did you ever make any bombs or cannon bullets ? Wor. Withdraw ! oons, sir ! what d'ye mean by withdraw ? Braz. I'll show you. [Exit. Wor. She's lost, irrecoverably lost, and Plume's advice has ruined me! 'Sdeath! why should I, that knew her haughty spirit, be ruled by a man that's a stranger to her pride ? Enter Captain Plume. Plume. Ha ! ha ! ha ! a battle-royal. Don't frown so, man ; she's your own, I tell you ; I saw the fury of her love in the extremity of her pas sion : the wildness of her anger is a certain sign that she loves you to madness. That rogue Kite began the battle with abundance of conduct, and will bring you off victorious, my life on't; he plays his part admirably ; she's to be with him again presently. Wor. But what could be the meaning of Brazen's familiarity with her ? Plume. You are no logician, if you pretend to draw consequences from the actions of fools : there's no arguing by the rule of reason upon a science without principles, and such is their conduct. Whim, unaccountable whim, hurries 'em on like a man drunk with brandy before ten o'clock in the morning. \u2014 But we lose our sport : Kite has opened above an hour ago, let's away. [Exeunt. Thos. Not I. Kite. You either have or will. The stars have decreed, that you shall be \u2014 I must have more money, sir, \u2014 your fortune's great. Thos. Faith, doctor, I have no more. Kite. O sir, I'll trust you, and take it out of your arrears. Thos. Arrears ! what arrears ? Kite. The five hundred pound that's owing to you from the government. Thos. Owing me ! Kite. Owing you, sir. \u2014 Let me see your t'other hand.\u2014 I beg your pardon, it will be owing to you : and the rogue of an agent will demand fifty per cent, for a fortnight's advance. Thos. I'm in the clouds, doctor, all this while. Kite. Sir, 1 am above 'em, among the stars. In two years, three months, and two hours, you will be made captain of the forges to the grand train of artillery, and will have ten shillings a day, aud two servants. 'Tis the decree of the stars, and of the fixed stars, that are as immoveable as your anvil ; strike, sir, while the iron is hot. Fly, sir ! begone ! Thos. What, what would you have me do, doctor ? I wish the stars would put me in a way for this fine place. SCENE III. \u2014 Serjeant Kite's Quarters. Serjeant Kite, in a conjuror's habit, discovered sitting at a table, whereon are a globe and books. Kite. [Rising. ] By the position of the heavens, gained from my observation upon these celestial globes, I find that Luna was a tidewaiter, Sol a surveyor, Mercury a thief, Venus a whore, Saturn an alderman, Jupiter a rake, and Mars a serjeant of grenadiers ; and this is the system of Kite the conjurer. Kite. The stars do. \u2014 Let me see \u2014 ay, about an hour hence walk carelessly into the market-place, and you'll see a tall, slender gentleman, cheapen ing a pennyworth of apples, with a cane hanging upon his button. This gentleman will ask you what's o'clock. He's your man, and the maker of your fortune : follow him, follow him.\u2014 And now go home, and take leave of your wife and children ; an hour hence exactly is your time. Thos. A tall slender gentleman, you say, with a cane \u00bb pray, what sort of head has the cane ? Kile. An amber head, with a black ribbon. Thos. And pray, of what employment is the gentleman ? Enter Captain Plume and Mr, Worthy. Plume. Well, what success ? Kite. I have sent away a shoemaker and a tailor already ; one's to be a captain of marines, and the other a major of dragoons : I am to manage them at night. \u2014 Have you seen the lady, Mr. Worthy ? Wor. Ay, but it won't do. Have you showed her her name, that I tore off from the bottom of the letter ? Kite. No, sir, I reserve that for the last stroke."], [724, "630 THE RECRUITING OFFICER.

Pluck. Nay, then he is the devil ! \u2014 Pray, doctor, were you born of a woman ? or, did you come into the world of your own head ? Kite. That's a secret. \u2014 This gold was offered you by a proper handsome man, called Hawk, or Buz zard, or \u2014 Kile. Right ! He'll call you honest Tom. Thos. But how the devil should he know my name? Kite. Oh, there are several sorts of Toms ! Tom o' Lincoln, Tom-tit, Tom Tell-troth, Tom o' Bed lam, and Tom Fool. \u2014 [Knocking at the door.] Begone ! \u2014 an hour hence precisely. Thos. You say, he'll ask me what's o'clock ? Kite. Most certainly. \u2014 And you'll answer you don't know: \u2014 and be sure you look at St. Mary's dial ; for the sun won't shine, and if it should, you won't be able to tell the figures. Pluck. Kite you mean. Kite. Ay, ay, Kite. Pluck. As arrant a rogue as ever carried a hal berd ! The impudent rascal would have decoyed me for a soldier ! Kite. A soldier ! a man of your substance for a soldier ! Your mother has a hundred pound in bard money, lying at this minute in the hands of a mercer, not forty yards from this place. Pluck. Oons ! and so she has. but very few know so much. Thos. I will, I will. [Exit. Plume. [Behind.] Well done, conjurer ! go on and prosper. Kite. As you were. Enter Pluck. Kite. I know it, and that rogue, what's his name, Kite knew it, and offered you five guineas to list, because he knew your poor mother would give the hundred for your discharge. Pluck. There's a dog now ! \u2014 Flesn, doctor, I'll give you t'other half-crown, and tell me that this same Kite will be hanged. Kite. He's in as much danger as any man in the county of Salop. Pluck. There's your fee But you have forgol the surgeon-general all this while. Kite. You put the stars in a passion. \u2014 [Looks on his books.] But now they are pacified again : \u2014 Let me see, did you never cut off a man's leg ? Pluck. No. [Aside.] What my old friend Pluck the butcher ! I offered the surly bull-dog five guineas this morn ing, and he refused it. Pluck. So, master Conjurer, here's half-a crown. \u2014 And now you must understand \u2014 Kite. Hold, friend, I know your business before hand. Pluck. You're devilish cunning then, for I don't well know it myself. Kite. I know more than you, friend. \u2014 You have a foolish saying, that such a one knows no more than the man in the moon : I tell you, the man in the moon knows more than all the men under the sun. Don't the moon see all the world ? Pluck. All the world see the moon, I must con fess. Kite. Recollect, pray. Pluck. I say, no. Kite. That's strange ! wonderful strange ! but nothing is strange to me, such wonderful changes have I seen. \u2014 The second, or third, ay, the third campaign that you make in Flanders, the leg of a great officer will be shattered by a great shot, yon will be there accidentally, and with your cleaver chop off the limb at a blow : in short, the opera tion will be performed with so much dexterity, that with the general applause you will be made surgeon general of the whole army. Pluck. Nay, for the matter of cutting off a limb, I'll do't, I'll do't with any surgeon in Europe, but I have no thoughts of making a campaign. Kite. You have no thoughts ! what's matter for your thoughts ? The stars have decreed it, and you must go. Kile. Then she must see all the world, that's certain. \u2014 Give me your hand. \u2014 You're by trade, either a butcher or a surgeon. Pluck. True, I am a butcher. Kite. And a surgeon you will be, the employ ments differ only in the name : he that can cut up an ox, may dissect a man ; and the same dexterity that cracks a marrow-bone, will cut off a leg or an arm. Pluck. What d'ye mean, doctor, what d'ye mean ? Kite. Patience, patience, Mr. Surgeon General ; the stars are great bodies, and move slowly. Pluck. But what d'ye mean by surgeon-general, doctor ? Kite. Nay, sir, if your worship won't have patience, I must beg the favour of your worship's absence. Pluck. The stars decree it ! oons, sir, the justices can't press me ! Kile. Nay, friend, 'tis none of my business, I ba' done ; only mind this, you'll knowmorean hour and a half hence, that's all, farewell ! [Going. Pluck. Hold, hold, doctor ! \u2014 Surgeon-general ! what is the place worth, pray ? Kite. Five hundred pounds a year, besides guineas for claps. Pluck. Five hundred pounds a year ! \u2014 An hour and a half hence, you say ? Kite. Prithee, friend, he quiet, don't be so trouble some. Here's such a work to make a booby butcher accept of five hundred pound a year ! \u2014 But if you must hear it \u2014 I'll tell you in short, you'll be stand- Pluck. My worship! my worship ! but why my worship ? Kite. Nay then, I have done. [Silt down. Pluck. Pray, doctor \u2014 Kite. Fire and fury, sir ! \u2014 [Rises in a passion.] Do yon think the stars will be hurried ? Do the stars owe you any money, sir, that you dare to dun their lordships at this rate ?

My hand ! my hand ! the devil ! my hand ! \u2014 [Melinda and Lucy shriek, and run to a corner of the stage. Kite discovers Plume, and gets away his hand.] A plague o' your pincers! he has fixed his nails in my very flesh. \u2014 O madam ! you put the demon in such a passion with your scruples, that it has almost cost me my hand.

How! then I'll travel in good earnest. \u2014 [Looking at the letter.] By all my hopes, 'tis Lucy's hand ! Plume. Lucy's ! Wor. Certainly ; 'tis no more like Melinda's character than black is to white. Wor. I'll make it the best compliment to you that you ever made in your life, if you do. But I must be a traveller, you say ?

Stand off, I have my familiar already. Braz. Are you bewitched, my dear ? Kite. Yes, my dear ; but mine is a peaceable spirit, and hates gunpowder. Thus I fortify myself.\u2014 [Draws a circle round him.] And now, captain, have a care how you force my lines. Bran. Lines ! what dost talk of lines ! You have something like a fishing-rod there, indeed ; but I come to be acquainted with you, man. \u2014 What's your name, my dear? Kite. Conundrum. Wor. The very same, the other fragments I showed you just now. I once intended it for an other use, but I think I have turned it now to better advantage. Plume. But 'twas barbarous to conceal this so long, and to continue me so many hours in the pernicious heresy of believing that angelic creature could change ! \u2014 Poor Silvia ! Wor. Rich Silvia you mean, and poor captain, ha ! ha ! ha ! Come, come, friend, Melinda is true and shall be mine ; Silvia is constant, and may be yours. Braz. Conundrum ! rat me, I knew a famous doctor in London of your name ! \u2014 Where were you born ? Plume. No, she's above my hopes : but for her sake I'll recant my opinion of her sex. By some the sex is blamed without design, Light harmless censure, such as yours and mine; Sallies of wit, and vapours of our wine. Others the justice of the sex condemn, And wanting merit to create esteem, Would hide their own defects by censuring them. Hut they, secure in their all-conquering charms, Laugh at the vain efforts of false, alarms ; He magnifies their conquests who complains, For none would struggle were they not in chains. [Exeunt.

Just as I was last night, neither better nor worse for you. Silv. What's the matter ? did you not like your bedfellow ? Bal. Consider, Mr. Scale, that were it not for the bravery of these officers, we should have French dragoons among us, that would leave us neither liberty, property, wife, nor daughter. Come, Mr. Scale, the gentlemen are vigorous and warm, and may they continue so ; the same heat that stirs them up to love, spurs them on to battle : you never knew a great general in your life, that did not love a whore. This I only speak in reference to captain Plume \u2014 for the other spark I know nothing of. Scale. Nor can I hear of anybody that does Oh, here they come. Rose. I don't know whether I had a bedfellow or not. Silv. Did not I lie with you ? Rose. No : I wonder you could have the con science to ruin a poor girl for nothing. Silv.

'Tis a project for laying out a thousand pound. Plume. Were it not requisite to project first how to get it in ? Braz. You can't imagine, my dear, that I want twenty thousand pound ; I have spent twenty times as much in the service. Now, my dear, pray advise me, my head runs much upon architecture,' shall I build a privateer or a playhouse ? Plume. An odd question \u2014 a privateer or a play house 1 'Twill require some consideration. \u2014 Faith, I'm for a privateer. Braz. I'm not of your opinion, my dear. \u2014 For in the first place a privateer may be ill built. Plume. And so may a playhouse. Braz. But a privateer may be ill manned. Plume. And so may a playhouse. Braz. But a privateer may run upon the shal lows. Plume. Nay, nay, there's nothing of Lucy in this \u2014 I tell ye, I saw Melinda's hand, as surely as this is mine. Wor.

How ! her journey put off ! Plume. That is, her journey was a put-off to yon. Wor. 'Tis plain, plain ! \u2014 But how, where, when is she to meet Brazen ? Plume. Not so often as a playhouse. Braz. But you know a privateer may spring a leak. Plume. Just now, I tell you, half a mile hence at the water-side. Plume. And I know that a playhouse may spring a great many. Wor. Up or down the water ?

This man is but one man ; the country may spare him, and the army wants him ; besides, he's cut out by nature for a grenadier ; he's five foot ten inches high ; he shall box, wrestle, or dance the Cheshire round with any man in the country ; he gets drunk every sabbath day, and he beats his wife. Kite. May it please your worship, she's with child in conscience. Scale. Who married you, mistress ? Worn. My husband \u2014 we agreed that I should call him husband, to avoid passing for a whore, and that he should call me wife, to shun going for a soldier. Wife. You lie, sirrah ! you lie! \u2014 An please your worship, he's the best-natur'dst, pains-taking'st man in the parish, witness my five poor children. Scrup.

Yes, sir ; she shall go with us to the sea side, and there, if she has a mind to drown herself, we'll take care that nobody shall hinder her. Bal.

Hold, gentlemen ! \u2014 Hark'ee, friend, how do you maintain your wife and children ? Plume. They live upon wildfowl and venison, sir ; the husband keeps a gun, and kills all the hares and partridges within five miles round. Bal. A gun ! nay, if he be so good at gunning, he shall have enough on't. He may be of use against the French, for he shoots flying, to be sure. Scrup. But his wife and children, Mr. Balance! Wife. Ay, ay, that's the reason you would send him away; you know I have a child every year, and you are afraid they should come upon the parish at last. Re-enter Constable with Silvia.

Pardon ! no, no, child, your crime shall be your punishment \u2014 Here, captain, I deliver her over to the conjugal power for her chastisement ; since she will be a wife, be you a husband, a very husband. When she tells you of her love, upbraid her with her folly ; be modishly ungrateful, because she has been unfashionably kind, and use her worse than you would anybody else, because you can't use her so well as she deserves. Bal. Was ever man so imposed upon! I had her promise, indeed, that she should never dispose of herself without my consent. I have consented with a witness, given her away as my acu and deed. And this, I warrant, the captain thinks will pass ; no, I shall never pardon him the villany, first of robbing me of my daughter, and then the mean opinion he must have of me, to think that I could be so wretchedly imposed upon ; her extravagant passion might encourage her in the attempc, but the contrivance must be his. I'll know the truth presently. Enter Captain Pi.uaif. Pray, captain, what have you done with your young gentleman soidier ? Plume. He's at my quarters, I suppose, with the rest of my men. Bal. Does he keep company with the common soldiers ? Plume. No, he's generally with me. Bal. He lies with you, I presume ? Plume. No, faith, I offered him part of my bed ; but the young rogue fell in love with Rose, and has lain with her, I think, since he came to town. Plume. And are you Silvia, in good earnest ? Silv. Earnest ! I have gone too far to make it a jest, sir. Plume. And do you give her to me in good earnest ? Bal. So, that between you both, Rose has been finely managed. Plume. Upon my honour, sir, she had no harm from me. Bal. If you please to'take her, sir. Plume. Why then I have saved my legs and arms, and lost my liberty ; secure from wounds, I am prepared for the gout ; farewell subsistence, and welcome taxes ! \u2014 Sir, my liberty, and hopes of being a general, are much dearer to me than your twelve hundred pound a year. \u2014 But to your love, madam, I resign my freedom, and to your beauty my ambition : greater in obeying at your feet, than commanding at the head of an army.

Ladies, we must own, that this music of ours is not altogether so soft as Bononcini's ; yet, we dare affirm, that it has laid more people asleep than all the Camillas in the world ; and, you'll condescend to own, that it keeps one awake better than any opera that ever was acted. The Grenadier March seems to be a composure excellently adapted to the genius of the English, for no music was ever followed so far by us, nor with so much alacrity ; and, with all deference to the present subscription, we must say, that the Grenadier March has been subscribed for by the whole Grand Alliance ; and, we presume to inform the ladies, that it always has the pre-eminence abroad, and is constantly heard by the tallest, handsomest men in the whole army. In short, to gratify the present taste, our author is nowadapting some words to the Grenadier March, which he intends to have performed to-morrow, if the lady who is to sing it should not happen to be sick. We scorn the vulgar ways to bid you come, Whole Europe now obeys the call of drum. The soldier, not the poet, here appears, And beats up for a corps of volunteers : He finds that music chiefly does delight ye. And therefore chooses music to invite ye. Beat the Grenadier March \u2014 Row, row, tow ! \u2014 Gentlemen, this piece of music, called An Over ture to a Battle, was composed by a famous Italian master, and was performed with wonderful success at the great operas of Vigo, Schellenberg, and Blenheim ; -it came off with the applause of all Europe, excepting France ; the French found it a little too rough for their delicatesse.

Simpling our author goes from field to field, Aud culls such fools as may diversion yield ; And, thanks to nature, there's no want of those, For rain or shine, the thriving coxcomb grows. Follies to-night we show ne'er lash'd before, Yet such as nature shows you every hour ; Nor can the pictures give a just offence, For fools are made for jests to men of senso. crimes, Which then infested most the modish times : But now, when faction sleeps, and sloth is fled, And all our youth in active fields are bred ; When through Great Britain's fair extensive round, The trumps of fame, the notes of union sound ; When Anna's sceptre points the laws their course, And her example gives her precepts force : There scarce is room for satire ; all our lays Must be, or songs of triumph, or of praise.

Chamberlain! maid! Cherry! daughter Cherry ! all asleep ? all dead ? Enter Cherry running. Cher. Here, here ! why d'ye bawl so, father ? d'ye think we have no ears ? Bon. You deserve to have none, you young minx ! The company of the Warrington coach has stood in the hall this hour, and nobody to show them to their chambers. Bon. Eight-and-fifty years, upon my credit, sir \u2014 but it killed my wife, poor woman, as the sayiDg is. Aim. How came that to pass ? Bon. I don't know how, sir ; she would not let the ale take its natural course, sir ; she was for qualifying it every now and then with a dram, as the saying is ; and an honest gentleman that came this way from Ireland, made her a present of a dozen bottles of usquebaugh \u2014 but the poor woman was never well after : but, howe'er, I was obliged to the gentleman, you know. Aim. Why, was it the usquebaugh that killed her? Bon. My lady Bountiful said so. She, good lady, did what could be done ; she cured her of three tympanies, but the fourth carried her off. But she's happy, and I'm contented, as the saying is. Aim. Who's that lady Bountiful you mentioned? Bon. Ods my life, sir, we'll drink her health. \u2014 [Drinks.] My lady Bountiful is one of the best of women. Her last husband, sir Charles Boun tiful, left her worth a thousand pound a year ; and, I believe, she lays out one-half on't in chari table uses for the good of her neighbours. She cures rheumatisms, ruptures, and broken shins in men ; green-sickness, obstructions, and fits of the mother, in women ; the king's evil, chincough, and chilblains, in children : in short, she has cured more people in and about Lichfield within ten years than the doctors have killed in twenty ; and that's a bold word. Cher And let 'em wait, father ; there's neither red-coat in the coach, nor footman behind it. Bon. But they threaten to go to another inn to night. Cher.

Boniface, pretty well known upon this road, as the saying is. Aim. O Mr. Boniface, your servant ! Bon. O sir ! \u2014 What will your honour please to drink, as the saying is? Aim. I have heard your town of Lichfield much famed for ale ; I think I'll taste that. Aim. Has the lady been any other way useful in her generation 1 Bon. Yes, sir ; she has a daughter by sir Charles, the finest woman in all our country, and the greatest fortune. She has a son too, by her first husband, squire Sullen, who married a fine lady from London t'other day ; if you please, sir, we'll drink his health. Bon. Sir, I have now in my cellar ten tun of the best ale in Staffordshire ; 'tis smooth as oil, sweet as milk, clear as amber, and strong as brandy ; and will be just fourteen year old the fifth day of next March, old style. Aim. You're very exact, I find, in the age of your ale. Bon. As punctual, sir, as I am in the age of my children. I'll show you such ale ! \u2014 Here, tapster, broach number 1706, as the saying is. \u2014 Sir, you shall taste my Anno Domini. \u2014 I have lived in Lichfield, man and boy, above eight-and-fifty years, and, I believe, have not consumed eight-and-fifty ounces of meat. Aim. What sort of a man is he ? Bon. Why, sir, the man's well enough ; says little, thinks less, and does \u2014 nothing at all, faith. But he's a man of great estate, and values nobody. Aim. A sportsman, I suppose ? Bon. Yes, sir, he's a man of pleasure ; he plays at whisk and smokes his pipe eight-and-forty hours together sometimes. Aim. And married, you say ? Bon. Ay, and to a curious woman, sir. But he's a \u2014 he wants it ; here, sir. [Pointing to his forehead Aim. At a meal, you mean, if one may guess your sense by your bulk. Bon.

SCENE I. 643 I have but one daughter, and I can give her \u2014 but no matter for that. now, that I am a man of quality, and you my ser vant, when if our intrinsic value were known \u2014 Arch. Come, come, we are the men of intrinsic value who can strike our fortunes out of ourselves, whose worth is independent of accidents in life, or revolutions in government ; we have heads to get money and hearts to spend it. Aim. As to our hearts, I grant ye, they are as willing tits as any within twenty degrees ; but I can have no great opinion of our heads from the service they have done us hitherto, unless it be that they have brought us from London hither to Lichfield, made me a lord and you my servant. Arch. That's more than you could expect already. But what money have we left ? Aim. But two hundred pound. Arch. And our horses, clothes, rings, &c. \u2014 Why, we have very good fortunes now for moderate people ; and, let me tell you, that this two hundred pound, with the experience that we are now mas ters of, is a better estate than the ten we have spent. Our friends, indeed, began to suspect that our pockets were low, but we came off with flying colours, showed no signs of want either in word or deed. Aim. You're very happy, Mr. Boniface. Pray, what other company have you in town ? Bon. A power of fine ladies ; and then we have the French officers. Aim. Oh, that's right, you have a good many of those gentlemen : pray, how do you like their company ? Bon. So well, as the saying is, that I could wish we had as many more of 'em ; they're full of money, and pay double for everything they have. They know, sir, that we paid good round taxes for the taking of 'em, and so they are willing to reim burse us a little. One of 'em lodges in my house. Re-enter Archer. Arch. Landlord, there are some French gentle men below that ask for you. Bon. I'll wait on 'em. \u2014 [Aside to Archer.] Does your master stay long in town, as the say ing is ? Arch. I can't tell, as the saying is. Bon. Come from London ? Arch. No. Bon. Going to London, mayhap ? Arch. No. Aim. Ay, and our going to Brussels was a good pretence enough for our sudden disappearing; and, I warrant you, our friends imagine that we are gone a-volunteering. Arch. Why, faith, if this prospect fails, it must e'en come to that. I am for venturing one of the hundreds, if you will, upon this knight-errantry; but, in case it should fail, we'll reserve the t'other to carry us to some counterscarp, where we may die, as we lived, in a blaze. Bon. [Aside.] An odd fellow this.- \u2014 [To Aim well.] I beg your worship's pardon, I'll wait on you in half a minute. [Exit- Aim. The coast's clear, I see. \u2014 Now, my dear Archer, welcome to Lichfield. Arch. I thank thee, my dear brother in iniquity. Aim. Iniquity ! prithee, leave canting ; you need not change your style with your dress. Arch. Don't mistake me, Aimwell, for 'tis still my maxim, that there is no scandal like rags, nor any crime so shameful as poverty. Aim. The world confesses it every day in its practice, though men won't own it for their opinion. Who did that worthy lord, my brother, single out of the side-box to sup with him t'other night? Arch. Jack Handicraft, a handsome, well dressed, mannerly, sharping rogue, who keeps the best company in town. Aim. Right ! And, pray, who married my lady Manslaughter t'other day, the great fortune ? Arch. Why, Nick Marrabone, a professed pick pocket, and a good bowler ; but he makes a hand some figure, and rides in his coach, that he formerly used to ride behind. Aim. With all my heart ; and we have lived justly, Archer; we can't say that we have spent our fortunes, but that we have enjoyed 'em. Arch. Right ! so much pleasure for so much money. We have had our pennyworths ; and, had I millions, I would go to the same market again. \u2014 O London ! London ! \u2014 Well, we have had our share, and let us be thankful : past pleasures, for aught I know, are best, such as we are sure of; those to come may disappoint us. Aim. It has often grieved the heart of me to see how some inhuman wretches murder their kind fortunes ; those that, by sacrificing all to one appe tite, shall starve all the rest. You shall have some that live only in their palates, aud in their sense of tasting shall drown the other four : others are only epicures in appearances, such who shall starve their nights to make a figure a days, and famish their own to feed the eyes of others : a contrary sort confine their pleasures to the dark, and contract their spacious acres to the circuit of a muff-string. Arch. Right ! But they find the Indies in that spot where they consume 'em, and, I think, your kind keepers have much the best on't ; for they indulge the most senses by one expense, there's the seeing, hearing, and feeling, amply gratified ; and, some philosophers will tell you, that from such a commerce there arises a sixth sense, that gives infinitely more pleasure than the other five put together. Aim. And to pass to the other extremity, of all keepers I think those the worst that keep their money. Aim. But did you observe poor Jack Generous in the Park last week ? Arch. Yes, with his autumnal periwig, shading his melancholy face, his coat older than anything but its fashion, with one hand idle in his pocket, and with the other picking his useless teeth ; and, though the Mall was crowded with company, yet was poor Jack as single and solitary as a lion in a desert. Aim. And as much avoided, for no crime upon earth but the want of money. Arch. And that's enough. Men must not be poor ; idleness is the root of all evil ; the world's wide enough, let 'em bustle. Fortune has taken the weak under her protection, but men of sense are left to their industry. Aim. Upon which topic we proceed, and, I think luckily hitherto. Would not any man swear Arch.

Money 1 all that money ! why, sure, fa ther, the gentleman comes to be chosen parliament man. Who is he ? Aim. In that last particular you have the better of me. Arch. Ay, you're such an amorous puppy, that I'm afraid you'll spoil our sport ; you can't coun terfeit the passion without feeling it. Aim. Though the whining part be out of doors in town, 'tis still in force with the country ladies : and let me tell you, Frank, the fool in that passion shall outdo the knave at any time. Arch. Well, I won't dispute it now ; you com mand for the day, and so I submit : at Notting ham, you know, I am to be master. Aim. And at Lincoln, I again. Arch. Then, at Norwich I mount, which, I think, shall be our last stage ; for, if we fail there, we'll embark for Holland, bid adieu to Venus, and welcome Mars. Bon. I don't know what to make of him ; he talks of keeping his horses ready saddled, and of going perhaps at a minute's warning, or of staying perhaps till the best part of this be spent. Cher. Ay, ten to one, father, he's a highwayman. Bon. A highwayman 1 upon my life, girl, you have hit it, and this box is some new-purchased booty. Now, could we find him out, the money were ours. Cher. He don't belong to our gang. Bon. What horses have they ? Cher. The master rides upon a black. Bon. A black ! ten to one the man upon the black mare ; and since he don't belong to our fra ternity, we may betray him with a safe conscience : I don't think it lawful to harbour any rogues but my own. Look'ee, child, as the saying is, we must go cunningly to work, proofs we must have ; the gentleman's servant loves drink, I'll ply him that way, and ten to one loves a wench ; you must work him t'other way.

My mother was a good, generous, free hearted woman, and I can't tell how far her good nature might have extended for the good of her children.

As for fish, truly, sir, we are an inland town, and indifferently provided with fish, that's the truth on't ; and then for wildfowl \u2014 we have a delicate couple of rabbits. Aim. Get me the rabbits fricasseed. Re-enter Archer. Arch. What footman, pray, mistress, is so happy as to be the subject of your contemplation ? Cher.

Dost think, child, that my limbs were made for leaping of ditches, and clambering over stiles ? or that my parents, wisely foreseeing my future happiness in country-pleasures, had early instructed me in rural accomplishments of drinkir g fat ale, playing at whisk, and smoking tobacco with my husband ? or of spreading of plasters, brewing of diet-drinks, and stilling rosemary-water, with the good old gentlewoman my mother-in-law ? Dor. I'm sorry, madam, that it is not more in our power to divert you ; I could wish, indeed, that our entertainments were a little more polite, or your taste a little less refined. But, pray, madam, how came the poets and philosophers, that laboured so much in hunting after pleasure, to place it at last in a country life ? Mrs. Sul. Because they wanted money, child, to find out the pleasures of the town.

But there's a form of law in Doctors- Commons ; and I swear, sister Sullen, rather than see you thus continually discontented, I would advise you to apply to that : for besides the part that I bear in your vexatious broils, as being sister to the husband, and friend to the wife, your example gives me such an impression of matrimony, that I shall be apt to condemn my person to a long vacation all its life.

No, no, child, 'tis a standing maxim in conjugal discipline, that when a man would enslave his wife, he hurries her into the country ; and when a lady would be arbitrary with her husband she wheedles her booby up to town.

Well, sister, since the truth must out, it may do as well now as hereafter ; I think, one way to rouse my lethargic, sottish husband, is to give him a rival : security begets negligence in all people, and men must be alarmed to make 'em alert in their duty. Women are like pictures, of no value in the hands of a fool, till he hears men of sense bid high for the purchase. Dor. This might do, sister, if my brother's understanding were to be convinced into a passion for you ; but, I fancy, there's a natural aversion of his side ; and I fancy, sister, that you don't come much behind him, if you dealt fairly. Airs. Sul. I own it, we are united contradictions, fire and water : but [ could be contented, with a great many other wives, to humour the censorious mob, and give the world an appearance of living well with my husband, could I bring him but to dissemble a little kindness to keep me in counte nance. Enter Squire Sullen. Squire Sul. My head aches consuraedly. Mrs. Sul. Will you be pleased, my dear, to drink tea with us this morning ? it may do your head good. Squire Sul. No. Dor. Coffee, brother ? Squire Sul. Psha ! Mrs. Sul. Will you please to dress, and go to church with me ? the air may help you. Squire Sul. Scrub 1 [Calls. Enter Scrub. Scrub. Sir ! Squire Sul. What day o'th' week is this ? Scrub. Sunday, an't please your worship. Squire Sul. Sunday ! bring me a dram ; and d'ye hear, set out the venison-pasty, and a tan kard of strong beer upon the hall-table, I'll go to breakfast. [Going. Dor. Stay, stay, brother, you shan't get off so ; you were very naught last night, and must make your wife reparation ; come, come, brother, won't you ask pardon ? Squire Sul. For what ? Dor. For being drunk last night. Squire Sul. I can afford it, can't I ? Mrs. Sul. But I can't, sir. Squire Sul. Then you may let it alone. Mrs. Sul. But I must tell you, sir, that this is not to be borne. Squire Sul. I'm glad on't. Mrs. Sul. What is the reason, sir, that you use me thus inhumanly ? Dor. But how do you know, sister, but that, instead of rousing your husband by this artifice to a counterfeit kindness, he should awake in a real fury ? Mrs. Sul. Let him : if I can't entice him to the one, I would provoke him to the other. Dor. But how must I behave myself between ye ? Mrs. Sul. You must assist me. Dor. What, against my own brother ? Mrs. Sul. He's but half a brother, and I'm your entire friend. If I go a step beyond the bounds of honour, leave me ; till then, I expect you should go along with me in everything ; while I trust my honour in your hands, you may trust your brother's in mine. The count is to dine here to-day. Dor. 'Tis a strange thing, sister, that I can't like that man."], [741, "SCENE III. THE BEAUX-STRATAGEM. 647 Mrs. Sul. You like nothing ; your time is not come ; love and death have their fatalities, and strike home one time or other : you'll pay for all one day, I warrant ye. But come, my lady's tea is ready, and 'tis almost church time. [Exeunt. SCENE III. \u2014 Another Room in the same. Boniface and Cherry discovered. Bon. Well, daughter, as the saying is, have you brought Martin to confess ? Cher. Pray, father, don't put me upon getting anything out of a man ; I'm but young, you know, father, and I don't understand wheedling. Bon. Young ! why, you jade, as the saying is, can any woman wheedle that is not young ? your mother was useless at five-and-twenty. Not wheedle ! would you make your mother a whore, and me a cuckold, as the saying is? I tell you, his silence confesses it, and his master spends his money so freely, and is so much a gentleman every manner of way, that he must be a highway man. SCENE II. \u2014 A Room in Boniface's Inn. Aimwell and Archer discovered. Aim. And was she the daughter of the house ? Arch. The landlord is so blind as to think so ; but I dare swear she has better blood in her veins. Aim. Why dost think so ? Arch. Because the baggage has a pert jene sais quoi ; she reads plays, keeps a monkey, and is troubled with vapours. Aim. By which discoveries I guess that you know more ot her. Enter Gibbet. Arch. Not yet, faith ; the lady gives herself airs ; forsooth, nothing under a gentleman ! Aim. Let me take her in hand. Gib. Landlord, landlord, is the coast clear ? Bon. O Mr. Gibbet, what's the news ? Gib. No matter, ask no questions, all fair and honourable. \u2014 Here, my dear Cherry. \u2014 [Gives her a bag.] Two hundred sterling pounds, as good as any that ever hanged or saved a rogue ; lay 'em by with the rest ; and here \u2014 three wedding or mourn ing rings, 'tis much the same you know \u2014 here, two silver-hilted swords ; I took those from fellows that never show any part of their swords but the hilts \u2014 here is a diamond necklace which the lady hid in the privatest place in the coach, but I found it out \u2014 this gold watch I took from a pawnbroker's wife ; it was left in her hands by a person of quality, there's the arms upon the case. Cher. But who had you the money from ? Gib. Ah ! poor woman ! I pitied her ; \u2014 from a poor lady just eloped from her husband. She had made up her cargo, and was bound for Ireland, as hard as she could drive ; she told me of her hus band's barbarous usage, and so I left her half-a crown. But I had almost forgot, my dear Cherry, I have a present for you. Cher. What is't ? Arch. Say one word more o' that, and I'll de- clare myself, spoil your sport there, and every- where else ; look ye, Aimwell, every man in his own sphere. Aim. Right ; and therefore you must pimp for your master. Arch. In the usual forms, good sir, after I have served myself \u2014 But to our business. You are so well dressed, Tom, and make so handsome a figure, that I fancy you may do execution in a country church ; the exterior part strikes first, and you're in the right to make that impression favourable. Aim. There's something in that which may turn to advantage. The appearance of a stranger in a country church draws as many gazers as a blazing- star ; no sooner he comes into the cathedral, but a train of whispers runs buzzing round the congre- gation in a moment : Who is he ? Whence comes he? Do you know him? Then I , sir, tips me the verger with half-a-crown ; he pockets the si- mony, and inducts me into the best pew in the church ; I pull out my snuffbox, turn myself round, bow to the bishop, or the dean, if he be the commanding-officer ; single out a beauty, rivet both my eyes to hers, set my nose a-bleeding by the strength of imagination, and show the whole church my concern, by my endeavouring to hide it ; after the sermon, the whole town gives me to her for a lover, and by persuading the lady that I am a-dying for her, the tables are turned, and she in good earnest falls in love with me. Arch. There's nothing in this, Tom, without a precedent ; but instead of riveting your eyes to a beauty, try to fix 'em upon a fortune ; that's our business at present. Aim. Psha ! no woman can be a beauty without a fortune. Let me alone, for I am a marksman. Gib. A pot of ceruse, my child, that I took out of a lady's under-pocket. Cher. What, Mr. Gibbet, do you think that I paint? Gib. Why, you jade, your betters do; I'm sure the lady that I took it from had a coronet upon her handkerchief. Here, take my cloak, and go, secure the premises. Cher. I will secure 'em. [Exit. Bon. But, heark'ee, where's Hounslow and Bagshot ? Gib. They'll be here to-night. Bon. D'ye know of any other gentlemen o' the pad on this road ? Gib. No. Bon. I fancy that I have two that lodge in the house just now. Gib. The devil ! how d'ye smoke 'em ? Bon. Why, the one is gone to church. Gib. That's suspicious, I must confess. Bon. And the other is now in his master's chamber ; he pretends to be servant to the other, we'll call him out and pump him a little. Gib. With all my heart. Bon. Mr. Martin, Mr. Martin ! [Calls. Arch. Tom ! Aim. Ay. Arch. When were you at church before, pray ? Aim. Um I was there at the coronation. Arch. And how can you expect a blessing by going to church now ? . , . . Aim.

That's much. \u2014 The fellow has been at the bar by his evasions. \u2014 But, pray, sir, what is your master's name ? Arch. Nay, child, I must whip you if you don't mind your lesson ; he must treat his \u2014 Cher. O ay !\u2014 he must treat his enemies with re spect, his friends with indifference, and all the world with contempt; he must suffer much, and fear more; he must desire much, and hope little ; in short, he must embrace his ruin, and throw himself away.

[Aside to Boniface.] Plain, plain, he talks now as if he were before a judge. \u2014 [To Archer.] But pray, friend, which way does your master travel ? Cher. Because, being blind, he leads those that see, and, though a child, he governs a man. Arch. Mighty well ! \u2014 And why is Love pictured blind ? Cher. Because the painters out of the weakness or privilege of their art chose to hide those eyes that they could not draw. Arch. That's my dear little scholar, kiss me again And why should Love, that's a child, govern a man ? Arch. A-horseback. Gib. [Aside.] Very well again, an old offender, right. \u2014 [To Archer.] But, I mean, does he go upwards or downwards ? Arch. Downwards, I fear, sir. \u2014 Tall, all ! Cher. Because that a child is the end of love. Arch. And so ends Love's catechism. \u2014 And now, my dear, we'll go in and make my master's bed. Cher. Hold, hold, Mr. Martin! You have taken a great deal of pains to instruct me, and what d'ye think 1 have learned by it ? Arch. What ? Gib. I'm afraid my fate will be a contrary way. Bon. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Mr. Martin, you're very arch. This gentleman is only travelling towards Chester, and would be glad of your company, that's all. \u2014 Come, captain, you'll stay to-night, I sup pose ?

Open it quickly, come. Scrub. In the first place I inquired who the gentleman was ; they told me he was a stranger. secondly, I asked what the gentleman was ; they answered and said, that they never saw him before. Thirdly, I inquired what countryman he was ; they replied, 'twas more than they knew. Fourthly, I demanded whence he came ; their answer was, they could not tell. And, fifthly, I asked whither he went ; and they replied, they knew nothing of the matter, \u2014 and this is all I could learn. Mrs. Sul. But what do the people say ? can't they guess ? Scrub. Why, some think he's a spy, some guess he's a mountebank, some say one thing, some an other; but, for my own part, I believe he's a Jesuit. Dor. A Jesuit ! why a Jesuit ? Scrub. Because he keeps his horses always ready saddled, and his footman talks French. Mrs. Sul. His footman ! Scrub. Ay, he and the count's footman were gabbering French like two intriguing ducks in a mill-pond ; and I believe they talked of me, for they laughed consumedly. Dor. What sort of livery has the footman ? Scrub. Livery ! Lord, madam, I took him for a captain, he's so bedizzened with lace ! And then he has tops to his shoes, up to his mid leg, a silver headed cane dangling at his knuckles ; he carries his hands in his pockets just so \u2014 [Walks about foppishly,] and has a fine long periwig tied up in a bag. \u2014 Lord, madam, he's clear another sort of man than I ! \u25a0 \u2014 uumc : , .

Yes, faith. Dor. You must go and get acquainted with his footman, and invite him hither to drink a bottle of your ale because you're butler to-day. Scrub. Yes, madam, I am butler every Sunday. Mrs. Sul. O brave ! sister, o' my conscience, you understand the mathematics already. 'Tis the best plot in the world ; your mother, you know, will be gone to church, my spouse will be got to the alehouse with his scoundrels, and the house will be our own \u2014 so we drop in by accident, and ask the fellow some questions ourselves. In the country, you know, any stranger is company, and we're glad to take up with the butler in a country dance and happy if he'll do us the favour. Scrub. O madam, you wrong me ! I never refused your ladyship the favour in my life. Ar. h. I'm in love with ber already. Aim. Can't you give me a bill upon Cherry in the mean time ? Arch. No, no, friend, all her corn, wine and oil, is ingrossed to my market.

Never, sir ; but he's a master of languages, as the saying is ; he talks Latin \u2014 it does me good to hear him talk Latin. Aim. Then you understand Latin, Mr. Boniface ? Bon. Not I, sir, as the saying is ; but he talks it so very fast, that I'm sure it must be good. Aim. Pray, desiie him to walk up. Bon. Here he is, as the saying is. Gib. Yes, sir, and at White's too.

Not I, sir, captain is a good travelling name, and so I take it ; it stops a great many foolish inquiries that are generally made about gentlemen that travel, it gives a man an air of something, and makes the drawers obedient : \u2014 and thus far I am a captain, and no farther. Aim. And pray, sir, what is your true profession? Gib. O sir, you must excuse me ! \u2014 upon my word, sir, I don't think it safe to tell ye. Aim. Ha ! ha ! ha ! upon my word, I commend you. SCENE III.\u2014 The Gallery in Lady Bountiful's House. Enter Archer and Scrub singing, and hugging one another, the latter with a tankard in his hand. Gipsy listening behind. Re-enter Boniface. Well, Mr. Boniface, what's the news ? Bon. There's another gentleman below, as the say ing is, that hearing you were but two, would be glad to make the third man, if you would give him leave. Aim. What is he ? Bon. A clergyman, as the saying is. Aim. A clergyman ! is he really a clergyman ? or, is it only his travelling name, as my friend the captain has it ? ... Bon. O sir, he's a priest, and chaplain to the French officers in town. Scrub. Tall, all, dall ! \u2014 Come, my dear boy, Jet's have that song once more. Arch. No, no, we shall disturb the family. \u2014 But will you be sure to keep the secret? Scrub. Pho ! upon my honour, as I'm a gen tleman. Arch. 'Tis enough. You must know then, that my master is the lord viscount Aimwell ; he fought a duel t'other day in London, wounded his man so dangerously, that he thinks fit to withdraw till he hears whether the gentleman's wounds be mortal or not. He never was in this part of England before, so he chose to retire to this place, that's all. Gip. And that's enough for me. [Exit. Scrub. And where were you when your master fought? Aim. Is he a Frenchman ? Bon. Yes, sir, born at Brussels. Gib A Frenchman, and a priest! I won t be seen in his company, sir ; I have a value for my reputation, sir. Aim. Nav, but, captain, since we are by our selves\u2014 can'he speak English, landlord ? Bon. Very well, sir ; you may know him, as the saying is, to be a foreigner by his accent, and that s Arch. We never know of our masters' quarrels. Scrub.

To hinder two men from doing what they have no mind for. \u2014 But if you should chance to talk now of my business ? lived here all his life, and tells lies as if he had been a traveller from his cradle. Arch. And this priest, I'm afraid, has converted the affections of your Gipsy. Scrub. Converted ! ay, and perverted, my dear friend : for, I'm afraid, he has made her a whore and a papist ! But this is not all ; there's the French count and Mrs. Sullen, they're in the con federacy, and for some private ends of their own to be sure. Scrub. Talk ! ay, sir, had I not learned the knack of holding my tongue, I had never lived so long in a great family. Arch. Ay, ay, to be sure there are secrets in all families. Scrub. Secrets ! ay ; \u2014 but I'll say no more. Come, sit down, we'll make an end of our tankard : here \u2014 [Gives Archer the tankard. Arch. A very hopeful family yours, brother Scrub ! I suppose the maiden lady has her lover too ? Scrub. Not that I know : she's the best on 'em, that's the truth on't : but they take care to prevent my curiosity, by giving me so much business, that I'm a perfect slave. What 've think is my place in this family ? Arch. Butler, I suppose. Scrub. Ah, Lord help you ! I'll tell you. Of a Monday I drive the coach, of a Tuesday I drive the plough, on Wednesday I fullow the hounds, a Thursday I dun the tenants, on Friday I go to market, on Saturday I draw warrants, and a Sun day I draw beer. Arch. Ha ! ha ! ha ! if variety be a pleasure iu life, you have enough on't, my dear brother. Arch. With all my heart ; who knows but you and I may come to be better acquainted, eh ? Here's your ladies' healths ; you have three, I think, and to be sure there must be secrets among em. [Drinks. Scrub. Secrets ! ay, friend. \u2014 I wish I had a friend ! \u2014 Arch. Am not I your friend ? come, you and I will be sworn brothers. Scrub. Shall we ? Arch. From this minute. Give me a kiss :\u2014 and now, brother Scrub \u2014 \u25a0 Scrub. And now, brother Martin, I will tell you a secret that will make your hair stand an end. You must know that* I am consumedly in love. Arch. That's a terrible secret, that's the truth on't. Enter Mrs. Sullen and Dorinda. But what ladies are those 1 Scrub. Ours, ours ; that upon the right hand is Mrs. Sullen, and the other is Mrs. Dorinda. Don't mind 'em, sit still, man. Scrub. That jade, Gipsy, that was with us just now in the cellar, is the arrantest whore that ever wore a petticoat ; and I'm dying for love of her. Arch. Ha ! ha ! ha ! \u2014 Are you in love with her person or her virtue, brother Scrub Scrub. I should like virtue best, because it is more durable than beauty ; for virtue holds good with some women long, and many a day after they have lost it. Mrs. Sul. I have heard my brother talk of my lord Aimwell ; but they say that his brother is the finer gentleman. Dor. That's impossible, sister. Mrs. Sul. He's vastly rich, but very close, they say. Dor. No matter for that ; if I can creep into his heart, I'll open his breast, I warrant him : I have heard say, that people may be guessed at by the behaviour of their servants ; I could wish we might talk to that fellow. Arch. In the country, I grant ye, where no woman's virtue is lost, till a bastard be found. Scrub. Ay, could I bring her to a bastard, I should have her all to myself; but I dare not put it upon that lay, for fear of being sent for a soldier. Pray, brother, how do you gentlemen in London like that same pressing act ? Arch. Very ill, brother Scrub ; 'tis the worst that ever was made for us. Formerly I remember the good days, when we could dun our masters for our wages, and if they refused to pay us, we could have a warrant to carry 'em before a justice : but now if we talk of eating, they have a warrant for us, and carry us before three justices Scrub. And to be sure we go, if we talk of eat ing ; for the justices won't give their own servants a bad example. Now this is my misfortune \u2014 I dare not speak in the house, while that jade Gipsy dings about like a fury. \u2014 Once 1 had the better end of the staff. Mrs. Sul. So do I ; for, I think he's a very pretty fellow. Come this way, I'll throw out a lure for him presently. [Dorinda and Mrs. Sullen walks towards the opposite side of the stage Arch. [Aside.] Corn, wine, and oil indeed ! \u2014 But, I think, the wife has the greatest plenty of flesh and blood ; she should be my choice. \u2014 Ay, ay, say you so ! \u2014 [Mrs. Sullen drops her glove, which he picks up and presents to her.] Madam \u2014 your ladyship's glove. Mrs. Sul. Osir, I thank you!\u2014 [To Dorinda.] What a handsome bow the fellow has ! Dor. Bow ! why I have known several footmen come down from London set up here for dancing masters, and carry off the best fortunes in the country. Arch. And how comes the change now ? Scrub. Why, the mother of all this mischief is a priest. Arch. A priest ! Scrub. Ay, a damned son of a whore of Babylon, that came over hither to say grace to the French officers, and eat up our provisions. There's not a day goes over his head without a dinner or supper in this house. Arch. [Aside.] That project, for aught I know, had been better than ours.\u2014 [ To Scrub.] Brother Scrub, why don't you introduce me ? Scrub. Ladies, this is the strange gentleman's servant that you see at churoh to-day ; I under stood he came from London, and so I invited him to the cellar, that he might show me the newest flourish in whetting my knives. Dor. And I hope you have made much of him ? Arch. 0 yes, madam, but the strength of your Arch. How came he so familiar in the family ? Scrub. Because he speaks English as if he had"], [747, "SCENE III. THE BEAUX-STRATAGEM 653 ladyship's liquor is a little too potent for the constitution of your humble servant. Mrs. Sul. What then, you don't usually drink ale? Arch. I don't know how, madam. I had a lieutenancy offered me three or four times ; but that is not bread, madam \u2014 1 live much better as 1 do. Arch. No, madam ; my constant drink is tea, or a little wine and water. 'Tis prescribed me by the physician for a remedy against the spleen. Scrub. O la ! O la ! a footman have the spleen ! Mrs. Sul. I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of quality ? Arch. Madam, like all other fashions it wears out, and so descends to their servants ; though in a great many of us, I believe, it proceeds from some melancholy particles in the blood, occasioned by the stagnation of wages. Dor. [Aside to Mrs. Sullen.] How affectedly the fellow talks ! \u2014 [To Archer.] How long, pray, have you served your present master ? Arch. Not long ; my life has been mostly spent in the service of the ladies. Scrub. Madam, he sings rarely ! I was thought to do pretty well here in the country tiil he came ; but alack a day, I'm nothing to my brother Martin ! Dor. Does he ? \u2014 Pray, sir, will you oblige us with a song ? Arch. Are you for passion or humour? Scrub. O le ! he has the purest ballad about a trifle\u2014 Mrs. Sul. A trifle ' pray, sir, let's have it. Arch. I'm ashamed to offer you a trifle, madam ; but since you command me \u2014 [Sings. A trifling song you shall hear, Begun with a trifle and ended : All trifling people draw near, And I shall be nobly attended. Were it not for trifles, a few, That lately have come into play; The men would want something to do, And the women want something to say- Mrs. Sul. And pray, which service do you like best ? Arch. Madam, the ladies pay best; the honour of serving them is sufficient wages ; there is a charm in their looks that delivers a pleasure with their commands, and gives our duty the wings of inclination. What makes men trifle in dressing ? Because the ladies (they know) Admire, by often possessing, That eminent trifle a beau. Mrs. Sul. [Aside.] That flight was above the pitch of a livery. \u2014 [Aloud.] And, sir, would not you be satisfied to serve a lady again ? Arch. As a groom of the chamber, madam, hut not as a footman. When the lover his moments has trifled. The trifle of trifles to gain : No sooner the virgin is rifled, But a trifle shall part 'em again. What mortal man would be able At White's half an hour to sit ? Or who could bear a tea-table, Without talking of trifles for wit ? Mrs. Sul. I suppose you served as footman before ? Arch. For that reason I would not serve in that post again ; for my memory is too weak for the load of messages that the ladies lay upon their ser vants in London. My lady Howd'ye, the last mistress I served, called me up one morning, and told me, Martin, go to my lady Allnight with my humble service ; tell her I was to wait on her ladyship yesterday, and left word with Mrs. Rebecca, that the preliminaries of the affair she knows of, are stopped till we know the concurrence of the person that I know of, for which there are circum stances wanting which we shall accommodate at the old place ; but that in the mean time there is a person about her ladyship, that from several hints and surmises, was accessary at a certain time to the disappointments that naturally attend things, that to her knowledge are of more importance \u2014 Mrs. Sul. Dor. Ha ! ha ! ha ! where are you going, sir ? Arch. Why, I han't half done ! \u2014 The whole howd'ye was about half an hour long ; so I hap pened to misplace two syllables, and was turned off, and rendered incapable. Dor [Aside lo Mrs. Sullen.] The pleasantest fellow, sister, I ever saw !\u2014 [ To Archer.] But, friend, if your master be married, I presume you still serve a lady ? Arch. No, madam, I take care never to come into a married family ; the commands of the master and mistress are always so contrary, that tis impos sible to please both. . , . Dor. There's a main point gained : my ord^s not married I find. . Mrs Sul But I wonder, friend, that in so many good services, you had not a better provision made The court is from trifles secure, Gold keys are no trifles, we see : White rods are no trifles, I'm sure, Whatever their bearers may be. Bat if you will go to the place, Where trifles abundantly breed, The levee will show you his grace Makes promises trifles indeed. A coach with six footmen behind, I count neither trifle nor sin : But, ye gods ! how oft do we find A scandalous trifle within. A flask of champagne, people think it A trifle, or something as bad : But if you'll contrive how to drink it. You'll find it no trifle, egad ! A parson's a trifle at sea, A widow's a trifle in sorrow ; A peace is a trifle to-day, Who knows what may happen to-morrow ! A black coat a trifle may cloke, Or to hide it, the red may endeavour : But if once the army is broke, We shall have more trifles than ever. The stage is a trifle, they say. The reason, pray carry along, Because at every new play, The house they with trifles so throng. But with people's malice to trifle, And to set us all on a foot : The author of this is a trifle, And his song is a trifle to boot. Mrs. Sul. Very well, sir, we're obliged to yo.u. \u2014 Something for a pair of gloves. [Offering him money for you."], [748, "THE BEAUX-STRATAGEM. ACT 111. 654 Enter Count Bellair. Arch. I humbly beg leave to be excused : my master, madam, pays me ; nor dare I take money from anv other hand, without injuring his honour, and disobeying his commands. [Exit with Scrub. Dor. This is surprising ! Did you ever see so pretty a well-bred fellow ? Mrs. Sul. The devil take him for wearing that livery ! Dor. I fancy, sister, he may be some gentleman, a friend of my lord's, that his lordship has pitched upon for his courage, fidelity, and discretion, to bear him company in this dress, and who ten to one was his second too. Don't you wonder, monsieur le comte, that I was not at church this afternoon ? Count Bel. I more wonder, madam, that you go dere at all, or how you dare to lift those eyes to heaven that are guilty of so much killing. Mrs. Sul. If Heaven, sir, has given to my eyes with the power of killing the virtue of making a cure, I hope the one may atone for the other. Count Bel. Oh, largely, madam, would your ladyship be as ready to apply the remedy as to give the wound. Consider, madam, I am doubly a prisoner ; first to the arms of your general, then to your more conquering eyes. My first chains are easy, there a ransom may redeem me, but from your fetters I never shall get free. Mrs. Sul. Alas, sir ! why sho'dd you complain to me of your captivity, who am in chains myself? You know, sir, that I am bound, nay, must be tied up in that particular that might give you ease : I am like you, a prisoner of war, \u2014 of war, indeed I have given my parole of honour ; would you break yours to gain your liberty ? Count Bel. Most certainly I would, were I a prisoner among the Turks ; dis is your case, you're a slave, madam, slave to the worst of Turks, a husband. Mrs. Sul. It is so, it must be so, and it shall be so ! \u2014 for I like him. Dor. What ! better than the count ? Mrs Sul. The count happened to be the most agreeable man upon the place ; and so I chose him to serve me in my design upon my husband. But I should like this fellow better in a design upon myself. Dor. But now, sister, for an interview with this lord and this gentleman ; how shall we bring that about ? Mrs. Sul. Patience ! you country ladies give no quarter if once you be entered. Would vou prevent their desires, and give the fellows no wishing-time ? Look'ee, Dorinda, if my lord Aimwell loves you or deserves you, he'll find a way to see you, and there we must leave it. My business comes now upon the tapis. Have you prepared your brother ? Dor. Yes, yes. Mrs. Sul. And how did he relish it ? Mrs. Sul. There lies my foible, I confess; no fortifications, no courage, conduct, nor vigilancy, can pretend to defend a place, where the cruelty of the governor forces the garrison to mutiny. Count Bel. And where de besieger is resolved to die before de place. \u2014 Here will I fix ; \u2014 [Kneels] with tears, vows, and prayers assault your heart, and never rise till you surrender ; or if I must storm \u2014 Love and St. Michael ! \u2014 And so I begin the attack. Dor. He said little, mumbled something to him self, promised to be guided by me \u2014 but here he comes. Enter Squire Sullen. Squire Sul. What singing was that I heard just now ? Mrs. Sul Standoff! \u2014 [Aside.] Sure he hears me not ! \u2014 And I could almost wish \u2014 he did not ! \u2014 The fellow makes love very prettily.\u2014 [\u201e7ou\u201e.] But, sir, why should you put such a value upon my person, when you see it despised by one that knows it so much better ? Mrs. Sul. The singing in your head, my dear, you complained of it all day. Squire Sul. You're impertinent. Mrs. Sul. I was ever so, since I became one flesh with you. Count Bel. He knows it not, though he possesses it ; if he but knew the value of the jewel he is master of, he would always wear it next his heart, and sleep with it in his arms. Mrs. Sul. But since he throws me unregarded from him \u2014 Squire Sul. One flesh ! rather two carcasses joined unnaturally together. Airs. Sul. Or rather a living soul coupled to a dead body. Dor. So, this is fine encouragement for me ! Squire Sul. Yes, my wife shows you what you must do. Count Bel. And one that knows your value well comes by and takes you up, is not justice ? [Goes to lay hold of her. Mrs. Sul. And my husband shows you what you must suffer. Enter Squire Sullen with his sword drawn. Squire Sul. Hold, villain, hold ! Mrs. Sul. [Presenting a pistol.] Do you hold ! Squire Sul. What ! murder your husband, to defend your bully ! Mrs. Sul. Bully ! for shame, Mr. Sullen, bullies wear long swords, the gentleman has none, he's a prisoner, you know. I was aware of your outrage, and prepared this to receive your violence ; and, if occasion were, to preserve myself against the force of this other gentleman. Count Bel. O madam, your eyes be bettre fire- arms than your pistol ; they nevre miss. Squire Sul. What I court my wife to my face ! Mrs. Sul. Pray, Mr. Sullen, put up ; suspend your fury for a minute. Squire Sul. To give you time to invent an excuse ! Squire Sul. 'Sdeath, why can't you be silent ? Mrs. Sul. 'Sdeath, why can't you talk ? Squire Sul. Do you talk to any purpose P Mrs. Sul. Do you think to any purpose ? Squire Sul. Sister, heark'ee ! \u2014 [ Whispers.] I shan't be home till it be late. [Exit. Mrs. Sul. What did he whisper to ye ? Dor. That he would go round the back way, come into the closet, and listen as I directed him. But let me beg you once more, dear sister, to drop this project ; for as I told you before, instead of awaking him to kindness, you may provoke him to a rage ; and then who knows how far his brutality may carry him ? .Mrs. Sul. I'm providtd to receive him, I warrant you. But here comes the count, vanish ! [Exit Dorinda."], [749, "SCENE I. THE BEAUX-STRATAGEM. 655 Mrs. Sul. I need none. Squire Sul. No, for I heard every syllable of your discourse. Count Bel. Ah ! and begar, I tink the dialogue was vera pretty. Mrs. Sul. Then I suppose, sir, you heard some thing of your own barbarity ? Squire Sul. Barbarity ! oons what does the woman call barbarity ? do I ever meddle with you \u00bb Mrs. Sul. No. Re-enter Dorinda. Mrs. Sul. Nay, now, you're angry, sir. Count Bel. Angry I \u2014 Fair Dorinda [Sings and addresses Dorinda.] Madam, when your ladyship want a fool, send for me. Fair Dorinda, Revenge, fye. [Exit singing. Mrs. Sul. There goes the true humour of his nation \u2014 resentment with good manners, and the height of anger in a song I Well, sister, you must be judge, for you have heard the trial. Dor. And I bring in my brother guilty. Mrs. Sul. But I must bear the punishment. 'Tis hard, sister. Squire Sul. As for you, sir, I shall take another time. Connt Bel. Ah, begar, and so must I. Squire Sul. Look'ee, madam, don't think that my anger proceeds from any concern I have for your honour, but for my own, and if you can con trive any way of being a whore without making me a cuckold do it and welcome. Dor. I own it ; but you must have patience. Mrs. Sul. Patience ! the cant of custom \u2014 Pro- vidence sends no evil without a remedy. Should I lie groaning under a yoke I can shake off, I were accessary to my ruin, and my patience were no better than self-murder. Airs. Sul. Sir, I thank you kindly, you would allow me the sin but rob me of the pleasure. No, no, I'm resolved never to venture upon the crime without the satisfaction of seeing you punished for't. Dor, But how can you shake off the yoke ? your divisions don't come within the reach of the law for a divorce. Mrs. Sul. Law ! what law can search into the remote abyss of nature ? what evidence can prove the unaccountable disaffections of wedlock ? Can a jury sum up the endless aversions that are rooted in our souls, or can a bench give judgment upon antipathies ? Dor. They never pretended, sister ; they never meddle, but in case of uncleanness. Squire Sul. Then will you grant me this, my dear ? Let anybody else do you the favour but that Frenchman, for I mortally hate his whole ge neration. [Exit. Count Bel. Ah, sir, that be ungrateful, for begar, I love some of yours, madam \u2014 [Approaching her. Mrs. Sul. No, sir. Count Bel. No, sir ! garzoon, madam, I am not your husband. Mrs. Sul. 'Tis time to undeceive you, sir. I believed your addresses to me were no more than an amusement, and I hope you will think the same of my complaisance ; and to convince you that you ought, you must know, that I brought you hither only to make you instrumental in setting me right with my husband, for he was planted to listen by my appointment. Count Bel. By your appointment ? Mrs. Sul. Certainly. Count Bel. And so, madam, while I was telling twenty stories to part you from your husband, begar, I was bringing you together all the while ? Airs. Sul. I ask your pardon, sir, but I hope this will give you a taste of the virtue of the En glish ladies. Count Bel. Begar, madam, your virtue be vera great, but garzoon, your honeste be vera little. Airs. Sul. Uncleanness ! O sister! casual vio lation is a transient injury, and may possibly be repaired, but can radical hatreds be ever reconciled ? No, no, sister, nature is the first lawgiver, and when she has set tempers opposite, not all the golden links of wedlock nor iron manacles of law can keep 'em fast. Wedlock we own ordain'd by Heaven's decree, But such as Heaven ordain'd it first to be ; \u2014 Concurring tempers in the man and wife As mutual helps to draw the load of life. View all the works of Providence above, The stars with harmony and concord move ; View all the works of Providence below, The fire, the water, earth and air, we know, All in one plant agree to make it grow. Must man, the chiefest work of art divine, Be doom'd in endless discord to repine? No, we should injure Heaven by that surmise, Omnipotence is just, were man but wise. [Exeunt. IV.

Drawn by the ap pearance of your handsome house to view it nearer, and walking up the avenue within five paces of the court-yard, he was taken ill of a sudden with a sort of I know not what, but down he fell, and there he lies. upon a table, and with a chopping-knife you must lay it open as broad as you can, then you must take out the bone, and beat the flesh soundly with a rolling-pin, then take salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and ginger, some sweet-herbs, and season it very well, then roll it up like brawn, and put it into the oven for two hours. Worn. Heavens reward your ladyship ! \u2014 I have two little babies too that are piteous bad with the graips, an't please ye. Airs. Sul. Put a little pepper and salt in their bellies, good woman.

Come, good woman, don't mind this mad creature, I am the person that you want, I suppose. What would you have, woman ? Airs. Sul. She wants something for her hus band's sore leg. Lady Boun. What's the matter with his leg, goody ? Worn, It come first, as one might say, with a sort of dizziness in his foot, then he had a kind of laziness in his joints, and then his leg broke out, and then it swelled, and then it closed again, and then it broke out again, and then it festered, and then it grew better, and then it grew worse again. Mrs. Sul. Ha ! ha ! ha ! Lady Boun. Is your master used to these fits ? Arch. O yes, madam, frequently : I have known him have five or six of a night. Lady Boun. What's his name ? Arch. Lord, madam, he's a-dying ! a minute's care or neglect may save or destroy his life. Lady Boun. Ah, poor gentleman ! \u2014 Come, friend, show me the way ; I'll see him brought in myself.

Did not I tell you that my lord would find a way to come at you ? Love's his distemper, and you must be the physician ; put on all your charms, summon all your fire into your eyes, plant the whole artillery of your looks against his breast, and down with him. Dor. O sister ! I'm but a young gunner ; I shall be afraid to shoot, for fear the piece should recoil, and hurt myself. Lady Boun. How can you be merry with the misfortunes of other people ? Mrs. Sul. Because my own make me sad, madam. Lady Boun. The worst reason in the world, daughter ; your own misfortunes should teach you to pity others. Airs. Sul. But the woman's misfortunes and mine are nothing alike ; her husband is sick, and mine, alas ! is in health. Lady Boun. What ! would you wish your hus band sick ? Mrs. Sul. Never fear, you shall see me shoot before you, if you will. Dor. No, no, dear sister, you have missed your mark so unfortunately, that I shan't care for being instructed by you. Mrs. Sul. Not of a sore leg of all things. Lady Boun. Well, good woman, go to the pantry, get your bellyful of victuals, then I'll give you a receipt of diet-drink for your husband.

No, no, madam, the poor man's inclinable enough to lie still. [Exit. Lady Boun. Well, daughter Sullen, though you laugh, I have done miracles about the country here with my receipts. Mrs. Sul. Miracles indeed, if they have cured anybody ; but I believe, madam, the patient's faith goes farther toward the miracle than your prescrip tion. Dor. Poor gentleman !\u2014 Oh !\u2014 he has got my hand within his, and squeezes it unmercifully \u2014 Lady Boun. 'Tis the violence of his convulsion, child. Lady Boun.

Don't despair, sir ; I have known several in your distemper shake it off with a fort night's physic. Lady Boun.

He was of a sudden touched with something in his eyes, which, at the first, he only felt, but could not tell whether 'twas pain or pleasure. Lady Boun. Wind, nothing but wind ! Arch. By soft degrees it grew and mounted to his brain, there his fancy caught it ; there formed it so beautiful, and dressed it up in such gay, pleasing colours, that his transported appetite seized the fair idea, and straight conveyed it to his heart. That hospitable seat of life sent all its sanguine spirits forth to meet, and opened all its sluicy gates to take the stranger in. Lady Boun.

You're in the right, Dorinda ; pride is the life of a woman, and flattery is our daily bread ; and .she's a fool that won't believe a man there, as much as she that believes him in anything else. But I'll lay you a guinea that I had finer things said to me than you had. Dor. Done ! What did your fellow say to ye ? Airs. Sul. My fellow took the picture of Venus for mine. Scrub. Truly, I'm afraid so too; for where there s a priest and a woman, there's always a mystery and a riddle. This, I know, that here has been the doctor with a temptation in one hand and an absolution in the other, and Gipsy has sold her self to the devil ; I saw the price paid down, my eyes shall take their oath on't.

The count! \u2014 Did you hear nothing of Mrs. Sullen ? Dor. But my lover took me for Venus herself. Airs. Sul. Common cant ! Had my spark called me a Venus directly, I should have believed him a footman in good earnest. Dor. But my lover was upon his knees to me. Mrs. Sul. And mine was upon bis tiptoes to me. Dor.

Why, my ten thousand pounds may lie brooding here this seven years, and hatch nothing at last but some ill-natured clown like yours !

Long smiling years of circling joys for you, but not one hour for me ! [ Weeps. Scrub. I did hear some word that sounded that way ; but whether it was Sullen or Dorinda, I could not distinguish.

You're i' th' right, brother Scrub. Here's a treaty a foot between the count and the lady : the priest and the chambermaid are the plenipo tentiaries.

And must the fair apartment of my breast be made a stable for a brute to lie in? Airs. Sul. Well, sister ! Dor. And well, sister ! Airs. Sul. What's become of my lord ? Dor. What's become of his servant ? Airs. Sul. Servant ! he's a prettier fellow, and a finer gentleman by fifty degrees, than his master. Dor. O' my conscience, I fancy you could beg that fellow at the gallows-foot ! Airs. Sul. O' my conscience I could, provided I could put a friend of yours in his room. Dor. You desired me, sister, to leave you, when you transgressed the bounds of honour. Airs. Sul. Thou dear censorious country girl ! what dost mean ?

Dor. Will you promise not to make yourself easy in the mean time with my lord's friend ? Airs. Sul. You mistake me, sister. It happens with us as among the men, the greatest talkers are the greatest cowards ; and there's a reason for it ; those spirits evaporate in prattle, which might do more mischief if they took another course. \u2014 Though, to confess the truth, I do love that fellow ; \u2014 and if I met him dressed as he should be, and I undressed as I should be\u2014 look'ee, sister, I have no supernatural gifts \u2014 I can't swear I could resist the temptation ; though I can safely promise to avoid it ; and that's as much as the best of us can do.

Ay, sir ; and unless you have pity Sir Chas. Law ! as I take it, Mr. Justice, no body observes law for law's sake, only for the good of those for whom it was made. Squire Sul.

Nay, sir, if you call marriage a crime, you must disown it for a law. Squire Sul. Eh ! I must be acquainted with you, sir\u2014 But, sir, I should be very glad to know the truth of this matter.

EPILOGUE DESIGNED TO BE SPOKEN IN THE \" BEAUX-STRATAGEM.\" If to our play your judgment can't be kind, Let its expiring author pity find : Survey his mournful case with melting eyes, Nor let the bard be damn'd before he dies. Forbear, you fair, on his last scene to frown, But his true exit with a plaudit crown ; Then shall the dying poet cease to fear The dreadful knell, while your applause he hears. At Leuctra so the conquering Theban died, Claim'd his friends' praises, but their tears denied Pleased in the pangs of death he greatly thought Conquest with loss of life but cheaply bought. The difference this, \u2014 the Greek was one would fight, As brave, though not so gay as serjeant Kite ; Ye sons of Will's, what's that to those who write ? To Thebes alone the Grecian owed his bays, You may the bard above the hero raise, Since yours is greater than Athenian praise. THE END.
