Have you heard of those little children And the pitiful vows they made, For the sake of the Saviour's sepulchre To serve in the child-crusade ? But the children were weak and feeble, And the way was hard and long, And history tells that too many failed Of that poor little helpless throng ; And they laid them down in peace to die, But methinks the dear Lord knew (Though the children's hearts had made mistakes) That their love was brave and true. Have you heard of our children's army? Have you heard of the ringing call That summons forth at the present time The children one and all ? Come out in the morning of gladness, Come out ere life's blossoms fade, Come, take your place in the ranks of God, And fight in the child-crusade ! You need not travel by land and sea, Nor far from your dear ones roam ; Look up to God ! and you shall not fail, Though the foe be close at home. We have named our ranks the Band of Hope, And we march unto victory fair ! For though our foe be the giant Drink, Our strength is in earnest prayer."], [18, "14 recitations and concerted pieces.

The table was laden with dainty food, But nothing could tempt his naughty mood ; His tumbler sparkled with water clear, While that of his father was filled with beer. There lay the grievance ; and soon he said (With a saucy toss of his curly head) : \" I mean to grow up as fast as I can, And I'll cdways drink beer when I'm a man ! \" But the mother's cheek grew blanched with fear, And she glanced from her boy to the glass of beer Till now it had only a beverage been, But her eyes were opened, and lurking within She saw the germs of folly and crime Rapidly swelling 'neath touch of time, Hiding all trace of a once good name, Revelling in a drunkard's shame. She glanced at her husband ; his brow was sad, \u2014 The wilful words of his little lad Had reached his heart ; and he stopped to think : \" Oh, God ! Am I tempting my boy to drink ?"], [27, "23 concerning tobacco. \" In me it awakens no craving for more, And stronger spirits I loathe and abhor ; But my son may be tempted, though I be strong, And through my example he may go wrong. \" Please God, he shall never be able to say \u2014 ' I began to love it when, day by day, I saw my father his tumbler fill, And knew that in him it worked no ill.' \" Then, meeting the anxious gaze of his wife : \" Will you join,\" said he, \" in a pledge for life ?

I have finished my picture at last,\" Said the painter. \" My labour is done, But love made it light through the years that are past Since the beautiful task was begun ; And now all the world will be able to see The face of the Lord as revealed unto me. Standing back from his work as he spoke, He gazed on the face so Divine, Looking up, while the bread with blessing He broke As a sacred memorial sign, \" My bod}' and blood in these symbols ye see ; Do this,\" said the Lord, \" in remembrance of Me.\""], [48, "44 RECITATIONS AND CONCERTED PIECES.

The artist his brush lays aside, And longs of his triumph to tell, Not wholly apart from a feeling of pride That his work is completed so well : He has patiently toiled and has rendered his best, And fears not his picture to put to the test. And many the painting admire, Its design and its colouring praise, And some will its value in money inquire While the painter its beauties displays, But he longs for a critic, a competent guide, Whose opinion at once shall its merit decide. At last such a critic is found, And the picture is eagerly shown ; His experience is wide and his judgment is sound, And his fame to the world is well known : Says the painter \u2014 \"If he shall approval express, My picture will then be secure of success.\" \" Have I to the canvas conveyed In some measure my lofty ideal \u2014 May I hope that my work to some hearts will have made The Saviour more living and real ? \" But his friend stood before it and spoke not a word, As though the inquiry he scarcely had heard. In attention he quietly gazed, Then gently the silence he broke, And his strange words of comment the artist amazed, As calmly and slowly he spoke \u2014 \" Will the picture succeed ? I am sure that it will ; That wine-cup is painted with wonderful skill.\""], [49, "45 THE GOLDEN CUP. i The words are intended for praise, But, although they were truly sincere, The approval at once disappointment conveys, No censure had been so severe ; The gaze that should rest on that face looking up Is only engrossed with the beautiful cup ! The cup is of gold, it is true, And with glittering jewels is set, And very successfully copied, he knew, And a work of much labour, and yet The artist resolved it no longer should stay, And prepared from the canvas to sweep it away. So, seizing a brush at his side, In a moment the cup disappears ! \"If that is your verdict, my friend,\" he replies, \" So perish the labour of years. Look alone on the face of the Saviour Divine, Nor consider the cup that is holding the wine.\" And the picture its mission fulfilled, And with treasures of art found a place ; And many with heartfelt devotion were thrilled As they gazed on that beautiful face ; With love they remembered, with reverence adored, The world's great Redeemer and crucified Lord. So we, like the painter, aspire The beauty of Jesus to show, And while it is ever our earnest desire That all His salvation may know, There yet may be something that sets Him aside, That still may the heart from the Saviour divide. Blot it out, though of gold it may be, Though it glitters with jewels unpriced ; Though the work of long years, very precious to thee It is not so precious as Christ ; Beware lest it hinder the gaze that should rest On the Chief 'mid ten thousand, the dearest and best."], [50, "46 RECITATIONS AND CONCERTED PIECES.

Hurrah for Dark Susan, the pride of my dwelling, Whose wisdom and virtues no tongue can impart ; Oh, the truths that are found in the songs she is telling On subjects that lie very near to my heart ! She has sung to the queen like a dutiful daughter, And yet condescends my rude cottage to grace ; And oft as she sings of the blessings of water, I gaze with delight on her modest black face. How oft of an evening, when footsore and weary, I've gathered fresh strength as her song, full of glee, Has taught me, in language so truthful and cheery, The blessings derived from a cup of good tea !"], [56, "52 RECITATIONS and concerted pieces. And often I grieve o'er the days of my folly, When comfort I sought in the pipe and the glass, Till won from the habit by Susan so jolly, My evenings at home now with pleasure I pass. When fierce-tongued opponents, in clouds of dark meaning, Her form and her virtues endeavour to stain, She lifts up her voice with true eloquence streaming, And laughs in her bonnet again and again. Though slaves to old Bacchus with glasses of liquor Would taint her pure breathing and stifle her glee, Sue hisses a warning, then louder and quicker Sings, \"Water, the drink of the brave and the free.\" The poor and the feeble, the wise and the wealthy Have found her a friend in the hour of distress ; And her lessons for ages on \" How to be healthy \" Have proved that Dark Susan exists but to bless. From this great-hearted soul, such a friend to the nation, We caught the first notes of a wonderful theme, When in sweet, modest song to one lowly in station She sang of the might and the triumphs of steam. The smoke-begrimed workmen, with wisdom directed, Would build and improve on the primitive plan, And engines their genius and toil have erected Are sons of the kettle developed by man. And statesmen and sages who ever are yearning To frame righteous laws in the clearest of light, From Susan a clue to success may be learning, By heeding her ditty on Truth, Right, and Might. Charles P. W. Tutt. BRIANTS, THE SCULPTOR. The light burns low in the sculptor's room, Throwing deep shadows and murky gloom Into each comer so cold and bare, One doubts if comfort e'er rested there. The grate is empty, the pallet-bed Has never a pillow to prop the head,"], [57, "53 BRIANTS, THE SCULPTOR. i Through the broken pane gleams the starlight wan Bearing a message of Hope to man. Toiling, the sculptor, haggard and gaunt, Hums the refrain of a low glad chant ; Over and over, again and again, Falls the sweet sound of that soft refrain : \" To-night shall the trial and toil be done \u2014 To-morrow the glorious guerdon won ! \" And the starlight gleams on the sculptor's face As he deftly deepens the lines of grace. On the lattice the frost has pictures traced Of feathery fronds and of flow'rets chaste ; But the sculptor feels nor cold nor chill As he labours with rare unerring skill, For the fire of his genius warms his hand, As the pliant clay to a statue grand Is moulded out by the master mind Living apart from its humbler kind. For weeks and months he has toiled away, Fashioning out of the plastic clay What on his soul is engraven deep, Grudging the moments for rest and sleep ; Till at last 'neath the feeble, flickering light, His work will be finished to-night, to-night ! And his brain whirls round, and his pulses beat, As the dream of a life is at length complete. On the boards of his garret cold and bare, The sculptor kneels in a fervent pray'r, And the tears fall fast on his wasted cheek When he sinks to his pallet all faint and weak. One moment, and then, with a glance of dread, He springs to his feet from his lowly bed. 0 Heav'n ! the model \u2014 the crumbling frost ! That \u2014 that must be spared, though life the cost. His trembling fingers undo the vest That shields from the cold his panting breast, And one by one round the damp clay mould His garments are wound with a careful fold ;"], [58, "54 RECITATIONS AND CONCERTED PIECES. Then he sinks once more to his naked bed, With the starlight wan on his pale brow shed. \u2014 But in that room at the break of day Two figures were found, and they both were clay ! The man-wrought image was safe and sound, Save an arm which the garment had scantly bound ; But the God-made figure was frozen fast To that bed where his weary limbs he cast ; And an echo came through the dawning grey Into the room, and it seemed to say : \" Last night the trial and toil were done \u2014 To-day is the glorious guerdon won ! \" Ogilvie Mitchell. [Strangers who pay a visit to the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, will not fail to be attracted by the bronze Mercury, who is draw ing a thorn out of his heel. The right arm of the god is wanting, and they may imagine, not alone from the nobleness of the work, but from this defect, that they are lookiDg upon an old Greek statue. This Mercury was the last work of the luckless sculptor, Briants. Although he had gained the Prix de Borne, and his genius was acknowledged as incomparable among his French con temporaries, he was almost always, so far as commissions went, unemployed. A garret served him as studio, living-room, and bed-room. Here during the severe winter he worked at his Mer cury, always saving his small quantity of coal for the hours during which his model was sitting to him. He spent the rest of the day without a fire. One night the cold was so bitter that he heaped upon his bed all the clothes he possessed. He suddenly remembered his masterpiece, which he had just finished, and, dreading lest the damp clay should be frozen, he stripped himself and put all his clothing and bed-covering around the figure. When his friend Cavalie entered to see him on the next day, the sculptor lay on his bed, frozen to death. His Mercury also, in spite of the artist's sacrifice for his art, was frozen, and the right arm had fallen on the floor. His friends had the Mercury cast in bronze ; but they resolved, in memory of the sculptor, that it should be cast without the right arm, exactly as it was found at his death. This is the figure which is now exhibited for the study and inspiration of 3'oung French sculptors in the Ecole des Beaux Arts.]"], [59, "55 THE TEMPERANCE POSTMASTER. THE TEMPERANCE POSTMASTER.

As we were a-looking away up the road That goes to London straight, We sees a queer fellow a-coming our way, And shouts, \" What cheer, old mate ? \" Fact ! he looked like a walking bundle o' rags, And thin, ay, as a rat ! So I hands him a pot o' beer, and I says, \" Just dip your beak in that.\" At once you may guess that the old fellow did, Till he swilled down the lot ; He made no two bites of a cherry, oh no ! Nor two drinks of a pot. Just when he was telling a bit of his life, A coach, quite grand, rolled by ; A lady and girl were a-sitting inside, Looking so proud and high. Ah ! if you could only have seen how he looked When the swell carriage passed, You'd ha' thought the man was a-going to die \u2014 His breath came thick and fast. So we said to him, \" Tell us, old chap, whose coach Is that, so spruce and fine? \" He rose, and he said, with an oath and a curse, \" By all that's true, it's mine! Yes, I paid for it out of my wages, 7, More than a pound a week. A pound ! every one of the shillings was mine ! \u2014 I know it's truth I speak \u2014 And it should have gone to my wife and my kids, But it went another way ; It went to the publican, wealthy and fat, Who sports my coach to-day ! \" He flung himself down on the bench with a groan 'Twere dreadful sad to hear,"], [64, "60 RECITATIONS AND CONCERTED PIECES.

The America through the waters is ploughing her onward way, The billows towering above her like mountains green and grey, Or tossing her up above on their foaming summits to float, As though the Atlantic liner were a tiny pleasure boat. Every timber groans and creeks with the terrible strain and strife, As the good ship starts and shudders like a thing of nerve and life, Rising aloft to heaven on the crest of the curling wave, Or sinking between the billows as though to a yawning grave. Every moment the seas are sweeping over her naked decks \u2014 Seas that have surged in triumph over many abandoned wrecks, Seas that seem to be hungrily grasping and seeking their prey>. As they fling in defiance their foam on high, and their icy spray. And who is daring to face them all ?

The America plunges still, it is true, through a heavy sea, But, thanks to her faithful captain, she rides it secure and free : The hundreds of human lives she carries are safe at last, And, for the present, the peril of storm is over and past. Below in his cabin the captain lies \u2014 his duty is done ; He left his post when the hurricane sank with the rising sun ; Never again will he guide his ship over the stormy wave: He has saved the lives of others, but his own he may not save.

In hospital at Scutari A wounded soldier lay ; The tide of life within his breast Was ebbing fast away ; His thoughts were wandering helplessly In fever-fancies dim, And news of vict'ry or defeat Alike was nought to him. His laboured breath came slowly now, A painful race for life ! (The ward was full of wounded men Struck down amid the strife), When suddenly he started up ! A light flashed in his eye ; He raised his hand above his head, And shouted, \" Here ami!\" Then, panting, down he sank again, And all the ward was still ; Only, along those rows of beds, There ran a sudden thrill \u2014 Whose was the voice their comrade heard When all to them was hushed ? Whence was the light that lit his eye And o'er his paleness flushed ?"], [77, "73 DOCTOR and patient. Later, they asked him what it was ; His voice in whispers came, \" I heard the roll-call up in heaven, And answered to my name ! \" Ab, yes ! the eyes so dim on earth Had caught a fadeless glow ; The Captain called His soldier home, And he must rise and go ! Oh, brothers ! when the summons comes, (It may be drawing near !) When up above the roll-call sounds, That each of us must hear, Shall we arise with joyful hearts, Our erring past forgiven, And join the Captain we have loved, Who calls us home to heaven?

But, doctor, I am out of work : I'm very poor, you see \u2014 I have no suit of clothes but this ; how can I pay vour fee?

Some time ago, there dwelt not far from here A sturdy Quaker, who from year to year Had tilled his farm remote from care or strife, Content to live his uneventful life ; Despising luxury and all pretence \u2014 An honest man he was, a man of sense, Who prayed and strove in all to do the right, And see the wrong in its repulsive light. His wife, a comely and good-tempered dame, One of a type which, at the time I name, Was more abundant in the land than now ; Could spin, or bake, or reap, or milk the cow \u2014 In short, was to her husband on this plan A worthy helpmeet to a worthy man. To cheer their home, one darling child had they, A daughter fair and lovely as the day ;"], [82, "78 RECITATIONS and concerted pieces. So sweet a face, all brimming o'er with smiles, Could scarce be found though one had searched for miles. Yes, Lucy, in her modest Quaker dress, Was verily a gem of loveliness. So thought her cousin John, who with them stayed To help his uncle and to learn his trade. A real good fellow, John, though I must say He had his faults\u2014 he often went astray, And when he did so, he was apt to frame Some lame excuse, to screen himself from blame. In all things else he played a manly part, And fairly won his pretty cousin's heart. Our farmer, as I've said, was wide awake, And plainly saw the course events would take. He loved them both too well to wish them wed While John such weakness showed ; yet had not said A single word to cause John to suspect That he had seen and marked this grave defect. So matters stood, when, one fine morn in May, John went to market with a load of hay. A cheering morn it was, for everything Seemed glad to welcome back the timid Spring \u2014 Within the wood was heard the blackbird's song ; From the tall trees the thrush sang loud and long ; The nightingale, untired, with matchless skill Greeted the sun with sweeter music still ; The noisy rooks, on family cares intent, A cawing chorus to the concert lent ; While busy bees, as they their way pursued, Hummed in an undertone the interlude, And John, as happy, sang along the road To cheer up Dobbin with his fragrant load. # # * # * The sun had sunk behind the distant hill, The bees had homeward gone, the birds were still Except the nightingale ; he had begun His song afresh, now that the day was done, When Lucy stood beside the farmyard gate And wondered why it was John stayed so late. At length she heard, with palpitating heart, The well-known rumble of the coming cart,"], [83, "dobbin's lesson. 79 I \u00bb And ran to meet her lover ; but, when near Enough to see, she almost dropped with fear, For Dobbin, driverless, with dragging rein, Was all she saw there in the dark'ning lane \u2014 Small wonder, then, that she was filled with dread, And pictured her dear John as hurt or dead. But soon she knew, with lighter heart, that this Was not the case ; yet, something was amiss, For in the hay-cart John from sight had sunk, And there she found him, fast asleep, and\u2014 drunk ! \" What ails thee, lad ? Come, rouse thee up ! Awake His uncle shouted, giving him a shake. Poor John, part sobered with the sleep and ride, Opened his heavy eyes at last, and tried What I have told you was his usual plan, To lay the blame on others \u2014 so began : \" Uncle, you see, when coming from the town, Some whom I knew at school were at ' The Crown ' ; They saw me passing by, and made me stop, And, though I said I did not w*ant a drop, Forced me to drink with them.\" \" That was too bad ; If they did that, I cannot blame thee, lad. There, that will do, no more need now be said- Wife, get this ill-used youngster off to bed.\" Our farmer rose next morning with the sun, And after he had seen the milking done, He leaned awhile over the farmyard gate, Waiting for John, who in his bed lay late, And as he, with an honest pride, surveyed His trim-kept yard, old Dobbin loudly neighed. \" Aye, aye,\" said he, \" 'tis time that thou wast fed, But he who tends thee is, no doubt, abed, Aud very little doth he care or think How thou art calling for thy food and drink. But stay, I fancy I can see a plan Whereby to teach this pretty gentleman A sound and wholesome lesson \u2014 yes, I do,\" And as he spoke, his plan to ripeness grew. Leaving the gate, he nimbly crossed the yard, And speedily the stable door unbarred,"], [84, "80 recitations and concerted pieces. i Took Dobbin to the drinking-place, and when His thirst was quenched, quickly returned again, Tied up the horse and closed the stable door, And took his stand where he had stood before. Soon after, John, with aching head, came down, Feeling half fearful of his uncle's frown ; But he, good-humouredly, wished him \" good-day,\" And John, with mind more easy, made his way To Dobbin's stable, led him out, and took Him down to drink, as usual, at the brook. You well may guess, the horse refused to drink, But how or why it was, John could not think. While thus he stood perplexed, a well-known sound, His uncle calling, made him look around. \" Come, John, 'tis late ; what is it makes thee stay ? \" \" Why, Dobbin seems to want no drink to-day ! \" \" Aye, maybe, lad, it is so ; then do thou Just make him drink, nor say thou know'st not how, For yesterday, when coming from the town, Some thou hadst known at school were at ' The Crown They saw thee passing by, and made thee stop, And, though thou saidst thou didst not want a drop, They made thee drink \u2014 what then they did to thee Do thou to Dobbin, for I wish to see ; And Lucy and thy aunt, they, too, are here \u2014 Pray, then, proceed, \u2014 thou nothing hast to fear. What ! silent, John ? I thought it would be so ; But let me tell thee, ere I let thee go, Excuses rarely men of sense entrap \u2014 A straying cow will always find a gap ; And as for drinking, this will show to thee Those made to drink can not unwilling be. Resist temptation, and thou shalt be strong \u2014 Who strives for right is sure to conquer wrong ; But if thou shouldst slip, let it be thy plan In future, John, to own it like a man. If this thou doest, thou shalt always find Thy God forgiving, and thy uncle kind.\" I think John heeded him ; I do not say His footsteps always kept the narrow way, But from that time he certainly began"], [85, "81 THE TEMPERANCE FORGE.

Foul without, and foul within ; Till my mind was all bewildered, And I closed my eyes in pain, Thinking rest might soothe my spirit, And restore my burdened brain. Soon I heard the tramp of footsteps Break the silence of the night, And a crowd of haggard wretches Came before my startled sight. On they moved, a countless army, Men and women, young and old ; Some in rags and some in broadcloth, Types of misery untold. And the look upon their faces Made my heart within me sink, As they moaned in muffled accents. \" See in us the slaves of drink.\" Then a wail of sad entreaty Burst from every wretched tongue, \" We are doomed, but save our children Rescue them while they are young.\" And the multitude swept onwards, Swiftly vanishing from sight, But their cry, \" Oh, save the children ! \" Rang upon the quiet night."], [88, "84 RECITATIONS AND CONCERTED PIECES.

Mournfully they raised their voices, \" Cradled we on ruin's brink, Nursed in crime, in sin and sorrow, We the victims are of drink.\" They too passed, their dirge-like voices Backward borne upon the wind, Till my soul was filled with sadness For the woes of lost mankind. But again the tramp of footsteps Fell upon the quiet night, And the hum of glad young voices Heralded a glorious sight.

So I drove and sang, and the sleigh-bells rang, And the horses shook their manes, All silver-white I saw them hang With the frost that gemmed the reins, And their hoofs rang out with a sharp quick clang From the frozen snow of the plains.

But life was merry, and life was young With me, and, with love's light cheered \u2014 Though snow-flakes gathered my hair among.

And never a stauncher man, I ween, In such a service was ever seen, Than the Crown Commissioner, Dr. Cole \u2014 And so thought Reginald, Cardinal Pole. The Crown Commissioner started out, Choosing the most frequented ways ; Proud of his dignified charge, no doubt, And pleased at the storm he soon would raise. The stern decree was hanging now In his black valise at his saddle-bow ; He laughed as he thought of the Lutheran crew, And how he would soon their work undo.

The Doctor has reached the capital, And turns his steps to the Council-room : He smiles as he enters the crowded hall, For he thinks of the Lutherans' coming doom. And he rises now with a graver mien, And a curious light in his eye is seen ; He will show what will blanch a heretic's face, With that he opens the leathern case. But stay \u2014 the warrant?

I am only a poor little rat, it is true, And a rat with a grievance is nothing to you ; But a hearing I beg \u2014 nay, demand, as a right, For a man is the cause of my pitiful plight. 'Tis useless to rail at, or cavil at Fate, Maukind has, since Adam, held rat-kind in hate ; 'Gainst traps and plain poisons I've nothing to say, For in spite of your skill, every rat has his day. Without further preamble, my story I'll tell : In a fine open sewer at Highgate I dwell ; A throng of relations and friends live around, And a happier colony rarety is found. Was found, I should say, for, alas ! to my sorrow, To-day all is changed, and I fear that to-morrow, And many to-morrows, may come and may go Ere the memory fades of our downfall and woe. On Saturday last ('twas the nineteenth of June), I was on my wa3* home, gaih* whistling a tune, When I saw, on the opposite side of the wa3T, A sight that I cannot forget, night or day. 'Twas my friend and companion, Fine Whiskers by name, A rat of great culture \u2014 no stranger to fame ;"], [113, "THE RAT'S PROTEST. 109 < But when I approached, crying, \" How do you do ? \" He snarled in my face, and said, \" What's that to you ? \" Then seeing, perhaps, ni3' bewildered surprise, He winked first with one, then with both of his eyes ; Then he tried to embrace me, and then tried to bite, While his poor shaking limbs failed to keep him upright. I thought too much study had rendered him mad, And slowly went on, feeling downcast and sad ; But visions of home made me quicken m3* pace, As I pictured my pretty young wife's smiling face. But oh ! what a scene met my petrified gaze ! I stared at my wife \u2014 was it she ? \u2014 in amaze ! For she sprang at my whiskers, and clawed at ni3T face, While her voice, in abuse, echoed over the place. And my little ones, Rataplan, Fine3*, and Raby, Were fighting, and swearing, and pinching the bab3r ; Their fur, like their mother's, was ruffled and torn, And the house, till now spotless, looked lost and forlorn. I fled from their presence, and sat down to think ; Then faintness and thirst made me search for a drink : But when I had drunk from the fast-flowing stream, I felt like a rat in a horrible dream. Was I, too, going mad ? M3' brain was on fire, To fight, or to caper, seemed all my desire ; I felt that my senses were leaving me fast, When sleep's kindly fetters around me were cast. When I woke the next morning my head felt like lead ; Some around me were dying, Fine Whiskers was dead. I vowed to unravel the hideous design That had made cultured rats act like villainous swine. But my schemes that sad morning seemed fruitless and poor, Till I spied, floating gently along the main sewer, A crumpled half-sheet of that day's Daily News, Containing a statement no plea can excuse. It seems that a gentleman named William Green, Of drinking the folly and evil had seen ; So with total abstainers he threw in his lot, Though a store of rare wines in his cellar he'd got. He made up his mind, and he made it up soon, And sent for his friends that nineteenth of June ;"], [114, "110 RECITATIONS AND CONCERTED PIECES. He told them no price by^ his wines would he gain, So two thousand odd bottles he poured down the drain. Now, as far as mankind is concerned, I must own True love Mr. Green for his species has shown. But what have we rats done, that he should pollute Our streams, and of each decent rat make a brute ? All rat-traps and poisons we look on as fair, They kill only those who are caught in their snare ; But this villainous liquor throws madness around, Till murder grows common, and blood stains the ground. So though but a rat, I appeal to all men, And enter m3* protest, that never again May wine or strong liquor in any shape flow Through drains, sewers, or crannies, where rodents can go. K. E. Corkill.

In a speech explaining his reasons, he said that after mature reflection and earnest prayer, he had come to the con clusion that it was God's will that he should part with the con tents of his wine cellar. Three methods were pressed upon him from time to time. One was to sell the wine to the trade, knowing that they would sell wine, whether his or not ; the second was to sell it and give the money to some charity ; and the third was to give it, as it was, to the hospitals. In pursuing the first course, he would be participating in the sale of an article which had been proved to militate against the physical, social, and spiritual advancement of society. The same reasons were equally applic able to the second course, and beyond them, there was in addition the inconsistency of causing injury to others in order to benefit some one else. The third course was met by the success of the London Temperance Hospital, where it had been proved that alcohol was not necessary in the treatment of any disease.
