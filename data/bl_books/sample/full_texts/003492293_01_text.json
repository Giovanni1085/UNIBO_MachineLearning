' \" The King's Stratagem \" has symmetry, grace, and tenderness, and a strongly accentuated individuality; and is worthy of the reputation of La Stella.' Home Journal. ' It complies with all the conditions of legitimate tragedy.' Examiner. ' \" The King's Stratagem,\" was intended for the stage, and with good acting would be popular, as there is no lack of incident, and the story affords plenty of opportunities for theatrical effect. The plot turns upon the loves of Chris tine, the Pearl of Poland, and Milo : the King of the country has the hero assassinated in order to steal his bride, but she is saved from her intended fate, and retribution falls upon the ravisher. The best passage, as far as writing is concerned, is the Bishop's speech in the last scene of Act I.' The Graphic. 4 It is a play more suited for the study than the stage.' Westminster Review. ' \" The King's Stratagem,\" from the pen of a gifted lady, under the nom de plume of Stella, brings out into deep relief the terrible nature and punishment of crime, and the ennobling effects of true, constant love.' Victoria Magazine. 'In this very material age a volume of true poetry is always welcome, and such is the volume before us.' Central Express. ' \" The King's Stratagem \" is a tale of love and crime forcibly conducted to its tragic denouement. The plot is clearly conceived, the scenes well posed, and the characters drawn with a vigorous hand. The tone is high, and scattered through the piece are passages where the language rises to dramatic dignity.' Worcester Journal. ' \"The King's Stratagem,\" from the pen of Stella, the most talented of the American poets, is a dramatic version of one of the most tragic incidents of Polish History. It is full of striking positions, and if well put upon the stage would be popular.'

' BOLESLAS. Pontiff ! you are insulting Royalty ! STANISLAS. Very far from that, Sire ; I admire it much. And when this parable the Prophet ended, He said to this great King, ' Thou'rt this rich man ! ' The King then wept, and tore his raiment, Sire, And rolled upon the ground, exclaiming wildly \u2014 .

TJiy wives I will deliver to thy neighbour, And thou shalt lose the children born to thee.' And to that King God did all that He promised. BOLESLAS. Pontiff, away ! Pray, pray for me, but go !
