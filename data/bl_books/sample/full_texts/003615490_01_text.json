It will be eafily believed, that the au thor did not write it with a view to acquire the reputation of a genius : he muft be a fim pleton indeed, who hopes to give people an idea of his wealth by fhewing them a hand ful of farthings. He wrote it merely to comply with the requeft of a theatrical per fon, whom he had an inclination to oblige; it was defigned and finifhed in fomewhat lefs than a fortnight ; and his excufe for now fuffering it to appear in print (and he really thinks fuch an excufe neceffary) muft be the nature of a mufical entertainment, which requires, that the words fhould be A 2 put"], [8, "PREFACE. 6 put into the hands of the audience, who would otherwife find it impoffible to ac company the performers in what they fing upon the ftage.

But though what he here ventures into the world, is neither a Tragedy, a Comedy, or even fo much as a Comedy of two acts ; he flatters himfelf, there are fome few, who will not condemn it, merely becaufe it is not, what it was not defigned for : he hopes they will confider, that when he fat down to write it, he fat down to write a mufical entertainment; and that a certain poet and critic, who is allowed to have been a tolerable judge in fuch matters, has told us, no author can compafs more than he intends.

However, he would certainly point out the exceptionable lines, to fhew he is not ignorant of them; but that he takes it for granted, there will be people enough ready to fave him that trouble.
