LONDON : HUTCHINSON & CO., 25, PATERNOSTER SQUARE. MELBOURNE: COLE'S BOOK ARCADE."], [10, ""], [11, "PREFACE. If the cream of human thought and human knowledge is collected into one hundred books, as I have suggested, to form the popular Library of the Future for all Mankind, one of these books must be a Song Book, for there is no species of composition that is so wide reaching, so penetrating, and, it may be added, so fascinating as songs. Songs are sung in thousands of Theatres, tens of thousands of Concert Halls, and millions of Family Circles, and they more or less sweeten the lives of hundreds of millions at their daily toil. Songs portray, in a concise, pleasing, and easily remembered form, the sentiments, feelings, and passions of mankind ; in fact, they are almost the sole literature of the strongest and most important of all the human passions \u2014 LOVE. Three of the greatest subjects of song in the past have been War, Wine, and Love. War songs are becoming fewer, because mankind is becoming more rational, peaceful, humane, and fraternal. Drinking songs are becoming fewer, because mankind is getting more and more disgusted with, and ashamed of, the degrading vice of drunkenness. But Love, beautiful, soul-thrilling, and immortal Love, as a subject of song, is as popular as ever ; the tendency of the age is to purify it, but nothing can ever annihilate or even diminish it. Songs are the most fascinating of all literature, because they blend the beauty of the voice with the wisdom of the intellect and the feelings of the heart. In the whole range of social enjoyments and instructions, there is nothing more enjoyable and instructive than a good song, clearly, feelingly, and intelligently sung ; and where all can join in the chorus or the song itself, in meeting or the family circle, it is the most fraternising and socialising of all occupations or influences. As a means of spreading an idea or sentiment quickly and effectively amongst all classes throughout the length and breadth of the land, nothing equals the agency of the song form, and nothing has a stronger"], [12, "VI PREFA CE. and more permanent hold on mankind. Somebody has said, \" Let me select the songs for the people, and who will may make the laws,\" meaning that songs have a greater influence than laws; and he was right. The freedom-breathing words of the \" Marsellaise \" had an im mense influence in the French Revolution ; \" Home, Sweet Home \" has increased and endeared the idea of home in the breasts of millions; \" God Save the Queen \" has sent a thrill of national pride and loyalty through the breasts of millions ; also, \" Should Auld Acquaintance be Forgot ? \" has produced or reawakened feelings of friendship in millions again ; and so on, in every age and in every country, numbers of songs have had immense influence on the feelings of mankind. Such being the tremendous influence of songs, I would like, in con clusion, to add a word or two on the responsibilities of the singer. In selecting this volume of choice songs, I have read or glanced over not less than sixty thousand, and I must say that for the most part such a lot of contemptible and utter rubbish I did not believe existed in the world. Nineteen twentieths of the songs that are sung in the Music Halls of England and America are a disgrace to the intellect of man. Songs, as I have shown, have a great moving and teaching power, and it is the high privilege and duty of the gifted singer to use this great and pleasing power for the good of his fellow-men by singing good songs instead of bad ones. Funny songs are good, but let them contain real fun ; Sentimental songs are good, but let them contain wisdom or feeling, or both \u2014 in a word, sing bad songs and your own time and that of your audience is wasted ; sing good songs in a clear, distinct voice, so that every word can be heard and understood, and you make yourself one of the greatest blessings of humanity, through the blessing and instruction that you convey.

By kind permission of Sheard & Co., 192, High Holborn. L. Carter. The wild rain is steadily falling, And the desolate day is done ; Wakixs at early day, Gaily I take my way, I am thinking to-night of my darling, Who sang in the years that are gone. Trilling some ancient lay As I stroll along ; Oh, years ! have you left her as joyous, Her dear voice as ringing and free, Youthful hearts I cheer, Age delights to hear, As of old when she sang in the twilight, With her head bending low on my knee Gay and grave draw near, While I sing my song. As of old when she sang in the twilight, With her head bending low on my knee ? Far I've been on distant strand Where Christian warriors fell ; Many a tale of Holy Land To gentle dames I tell. And tell me, my song bird, my blessing, Have you found thro' the shadow and Waking at early day, Gaily I take my way, Trilling some ancient lay shine A hand that gave fonder caressing, Or kisses more loving than mine ? As I stroll along ; Or the heart more tender and truer Than the one that was beating for thee. Youthful hearts I cheer, Age delights to hear, Gay and grave draw near, When you sang to me, darling, at twilight, With your head bending lo won my knee ; While I sing my song. When you sang to me, darling, at twilight, With your head bending low on my knee ? Tra la la la. Humble tho' be my fare, Health is a boon I share, Little I dream of care That heart is but waiting, my own one, To pillow thy dear head again ! As thro' life I go : And if it grows silent in waiting, Then good-bye to sorrow and pain, None my steps molest ; If fatigued, opprest, 'Neath some tree I rest, I know in the golden hereafter Thy songs ever sweeter will be, And there forget my woe. All some kindness show to me Than they were when you sang in the twilight, Where'er I chance to roam ; Tho' a wand'ring life I lead, I always find a home. With your head bending low on my knee ; Than they were when you sang in the twilight, With your head bending low on my knee.

I HEAR AN ANGEL SING. kind permission of Evans & Co., 23, Argyll Street, London. Published by Sheard & Co., 192, High Holborn. Hark ! I hear an angel sing, i^lXG me an English song, With words kind, sweet, and true; For only such as you would speak, Should e'er be sung by you ; For only such as you would speak, Should e'er be sung by you. Your voice has always charmed me, Whate'er its tones express'd ; But when you sing an English song, I love its accents best. Angels now are on the wing ; And their voices, singing clear, Tell us that the spring is near. Dost thou hear them, gentle one ? Dost thou see the glorious sun Rising higher in the sky, As each day it passeth by ? Hark 1 I hear, etc. Just behind yon cliff of snow, Silver rivers gently flow, Smiling woods and fields are seen, Mantled in a robe of green ; Birds and bees and fruits and flowers Tell us all of vernal hours, Sing m.e an English song, With words kind, sweet, and true ; For only such as you would apeak, Should e'er be sung by you ; For only such as you would speak, Should e'er be sung by you. While the bees with merry lays Gladden in the spring-time days. Hark ! I hear, etc. What though the lay be old, And often heard before ; If mem'ry echo to its tones, 'Twill only please me more ; If mem'ry echo to its tones, 'Twill only please me more. 'M SADDEST WHEN I SING, Thomas Hayncs Bayly. Published by Sheard & Co., 192, High Holborn. Then keep all finer music To charm some brilliant throng, You think I have a merry heart, Because my songs are gay ; But oh I they all were taught to me By friends now far away : The bird retains his silver note, Though bondage chains his wing ; His song is not a happy one, I'm saddest when I sing 1 But when you sing for me alone, Give me an English song. Sing'me an English song, With words kind, sweet, and true ; For only such as you would speak, Should e'er be sung by you ; For only such as you would speak, Should e'er be sung by you. I heard them first in that sweet homo VESPER HYMN. ' I ne*er more shall see, And now each song of joy has got A plaintive turn for me ! Alas 1 'tis vain in winter time HARK, the vesper hymn is stealing O'er the waters soft and clear ; Nearer yet and nearer pealing, Now it bursts upon the ear, Jubilate, Jubilate, Jubilate, Amen. Farther now, now farther stealing, Soft it fades upon the ear. To mock the songs of spring, Each note recalls some wither'd leaf, I'm saddest when I sing ! Of all the friends I used to love, Now like moonlight waves retreating, To the shore it dies along ; Now like angry surges meeting, Breaks the mingled title of song.

FAIR, SWEET, AND YOUNG. John Dryden. Faie, sweet, and young, receive a prize Eeserved for your victorious eyes : From crowds, whom at your feet you see, Oh, pity and distinguish me 1 As I from thousand beauties more Distinguish you, and only you adore. George Lord Lyttelton. When Delia on the plain appears, Awed by a thousand tender fears, I would approach, but dare not move ; \u2014 Tell me, my heart, if this be love ? WThene'er she speaks, my ravish'd ear No other voice than hers can hear ; No other wit but hers approve ; \u2014 Tell me, my heart, if this be love ? Your face for conquest was design'd ; Your every motion charms my mind ; Angels, when you your silence break, Forget their hymns to hear you speak ; But when at once they hear and view, Are loath to mount, and long to stay with If she some other swain commend, Tho' I was once his fondest friend, His instant enemy I prove ; \u2014 Tell me, my heart, if this be love ? you. No graces can your form improve, But all are lost unless you love ; WEile that sweet passion you disdain, Your veil and beauty are in vain : In pity then prevent my fate, When she is absent, I no more Delight in all that pleased before, The clearest spring, the shadiest grove ;- TeU me, my heart, if this be love ? For after dying all reprieve's too late. When fond of power, of beauty vain, Her nets she spread for every swain, I strove to hate, but vainly strove ; \u2014 Tell me, my heart, if this be love ? IF 'TIS LOVE TO WISH YOU NEAR. Dibdin. OH ! SAY NOT WOMAN'S LOVE IS BOUGHT. If 'tis love to wish you near, To tremble when the wind I hear, Because at sea you floating rove ; If of you to dream at night, To languish when you're out of sight, \u2014 If this be loving, then I love. Isaac Pocock, Oh ! say not woman's love is bought With vain and empty treasure ; Oh ! say not woman's heart is caught By every idle pleasure. When first her gentle bosom knows Love's flame, it wanders never ; Deep in her heart the passion glows \u2014 She loves, and loves for ever. If, when you're gone, to count each hour, To ask of every tender power That you may kind and faithful prove; If void of falsehood and deceit, I feel a pleasure when we meet, \u2014 If this be loving, then I love. Oh ! say not woman's false as fair, That like the bee she ranges, Still seeking flowers more sweet and rare. As fickle fancy changes. Ah no ! the love that first can warm, To wish your fortune to partake, Determined never to forsake, Though low in poverty we strove ; If, so that me your wife you'd call, I offer you my little all, \u2014 If this be loving, then I love. Will leave her bosom never ; No second passion e'er can charm \u2014 She loves, and loves for ever."], [38, "\u25a0, 16 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

Moore, Once did my thoughts both ebb and flow, As passion did them move ; Once did I hope, straight fear again, \u2014 And then I was in love. Thine am I, thine am I, my faithful fair, Thine, my lovely Nancy, Every pulse among my veins, Every roving fancy. To thy bosom lay my heart, There to throb and languish ; Though despair had wrung its core, That would heal its anguish. Once did I waking spend the night, And told how many minutes move ; Once did I wishing waste the day, \u2014 And then I was in love. Take away \u2014 take away those rosy lips, Rich with balmy treasure ; Turn away those eyes of love, Lest I die with pleasure. What is life when wanting love ? Night without a morning ; Love's the cloudless summer sun Once, by my carving true-love's knot, The weeping trees did prove That wounds and tears were both our lot , And then I was in love. Once did I breathe another's breath, And in my mistress move ; Once was I not mine own at all, \u2014 Nature gay adorning. And then I was in love. NOBODY'S DARLING BUT MINE, LOVE. Once wore I bracelets made of hair, And collars did approve ; Once were my clothes made out of wax, And then I was in love. By kind permission of Francis, Day, & Hunter, 195, Oxford Street, London. Once did I sonnet to my saint, My soul in numbers move ; Once did I tell a thousand lies, \u2014 Nobody's darling but mine, love, Nobody loves you like me, In your bright eyes softly shine, love, Visions delightful to see ; Visions of beauty and pleasure, Filling my heart with their love, Bringing me joys without measure, Beaming like bright stars above. And then I was in love. Once in my breast did dangling hang A little turtle-dove : Once, in a word, I was a fool, \u2014 And then I was in love. Chorus. Nobody loves you like me, love, Fondly and truly I'm thine, Promise you ever will be, love, Nobody's darling but mine. NO PAIN I FEEL WHEN SHE IS NIGH. Oh, give me tender woman's love Above the world beside, And dearest hopes of heaven, that move Mine inmost soul with pride. No pain I feel when she is nigh To bind my aching brow ; The angel of my hopes on high, And minister below. Nobody's darling but mine, love, Truly I love you the best, [love, While your sweet arms round me twine, Earth is a haven of rest. Lonely I'd be, love, without you, And all the joys that you give, Surely I never could doubt you, Pride of my heart while I live 1 Choeds. Oh, who would crave a nobler boon Than woman's true regard, To dwell in everlasting noon, Adoring and adored ; To watch the tear that fills her eye, The tear of love and joy, That withering age shall never dry, Nor worldly care destroy 1 Nobody's darling but mine, love, Surely I love you alone, And my heart ever will pine, love, Till I may call you my own.

How meekly she bless'd her humble lot, When the stranger, William, had made her his bride, And love was the light of their lowly cot. Together they toil'd through winds and rains, Till William at length, in sadness, said, \" We must seek our fortune on other plains ; \" Then, sighing, she left her lowly shed. They roam'd a long and a weary way, Nor much was the maiden's heart at ease, When now, at close of one stormy day, They see a proud castle among the trees. \"To-night,\" said the youth, \"we'll shelter there; The wind blows cold, the hour is late : \" So he blew the horn with a chieftain's air, And the Porter bow'd as they pass'd the gate. \" Now, welcome, Lady,\" \" This castle is thine, : ' exclaim'd the youth, and these dark woods all.\" She believed him crazed, 1, but his words were truth, Rosna Hall 1 For Ellen is Lady of And deeply the Lord of Whom William the st: Kosna loves stranger woo'd and wed ; , in these lordly groves, d in the lowly shed.

Moore, Oh 1 the days are gone when Beauty bright my heart's chain wove ; When my dream of life from morn till night was Love, still Love 1 New hope may bloom, and days may come of milder, calmer beam ; But there's nothing half so sweet in life as Love's young dream : No, there's nothing half so sweet in life as Love's young dream. Though the bard to purer fame may soar, when wild youth's past ; Though he win the wise, who frown'd before, to smile at last ; He'll never meet a joy so sweet, in all his noon of fame, As when first he sung to woman's ear his soul-felt flame, And, at every close, she blush'd to hear the one loved name.

But fading flowers in every field To winter floods their treasures yield : A honied tongue, a heart of gall, Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall.

Say, should disease or pain befall, Wilt thou assume the nurse's care, Nor, wistful, those gay scenes recall, Where thou wert fairest of the fair ? And when at last thy love shall die, Wilt thou receive his parting breath ? Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh, And cheer with smiles the bed of death ? And wilt thou o'er his breathless clay And the leaves of the judgment Book unfold. From thy window look and see My passion and my pain ; I lie on the sands below, And I faint in thy disdain ; Let the night winds touch thy brow, With the breath of my burning sigh, And melt thee to hear the vow Of a love that ne'er shall die, Till the sun grows cold, And the stars are old, And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold.

And when young love rewards their pains, The heart to rosy love beguiling ; When pleasure wreathes her myrtle chains, And life's gay scene is fair and smiling, Oft shall they fondly trace the days, When, wrapt in fancy's waking trances They wish'd, and sigh'd, and loved to gaze And told their hopes in silent glances.

But the minstrel touched such a tender chord That the blush to her pale cheek sprang, And her eyes grew dim with a veil of tears As in passionate tones he sang : There's love so sweet for an hour, etc. She threw him a rose with a tearful smile, To his lips the sweet flower he pressed ; A smile for a smile, and that maiden proud Love's power at last confessed .

But thou thereon didst only breathe, And sent'st it back to me ; Since when it grows and smells, I swear, Not of itself, but thee 1 I look upon the fair blue skies, And nought but empty art I see ; But, when I turn me to thine eyes, It seemeth unto me Ten thousand angels spread their wings Within those little azure rings."], [49, "27 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WOHLD.

And man, howe'er his fancy roves, Seeks constant smiles of beauty. For still when warm'd with pleasure's glow He goes 'mid bright eyes ranging, Still, still, he loves, when meeting woe, The heart that beats unchanging. He often errs with harden'd heart, When falsehood's dream enshrouds him ; Still in his mind the secret dart Chokus.

And reason, gliding o'er the mind, 'Mong scenes of folly ranging, He longs for peace, and that he'll find In hearts that beat unchanging. Pacing the ocean's shore, Edged by the foaming roar, Words never breathed before, Sounding so sweetly to somebody ; Under the maple tree, Dark though the shadow be, Plain enough they can see ; Bright eyes has somebody.

But when that bay was blooming grass, And deck'd with flowers of spring, No flower was there that could compare With the blooming girl I sing, As she sat in her low-back'd car. The man at the turnpike bar Never ask'd for the toll, but just rubbed The lovers come near and far, And envy the chicken that Peggy is pickin As she sits in the low-back'd car. his old pole, And looked after the low-back'd car. In battle's wild commotion Oh, I'd rather own that car, sir, With Peggy by my side, Than a coach and four and gold galore, And a lady by my side \u2014 For the lady would sit forenenst me On a cushion made with taste, While Peggy would sit beside me, With my arm around her waist. While we drove in the low-back'd car The proud and mighty stars, With hostile scythes, demand the tithes Of death, or war-like cars. While Peggy, peaceful Goddess, Has darts in her bright eye That knock men down in the market town, As right and left they fly, While she sits in her low-back'd car, To be married by Father Maher, Oh, my heart would beat high, at her glance and her sigh, Though it beat in a low-back'd car.

Upon a rustic bridge we met One afternoon in spring, His loving words I can't forget, \u25a0Within my ears they ring. The swans were sailing on the lake, Fresh, as if touch'd by fairy wand, With beauty, grace, and life. He almost thought it spoke ; He gazed upon the treasure still : Absorb'd, delighted, and amazed To view the artist's skill. And all the park was gay, My hand in his he chanced to take In such a charming way. \" This picture is yourself, dear Jane, 'Tis drawn to nature true ; I've kiss'd it o'er and o'er again, It is so much like you.\" The flowers were bright, but, oh, They shone like stars of night, His smile was like the glowing skies, And fill'd me with delight. I seem'd in love's delicious dream, \" And has it kiss'd you back, my dear ? \" \" Why, no, my love,\" said he. \" Then, William, it is very clear 'Tis not at all like me.\" My heart with rapture beat ; And while his eyes did on me beam, I heard his lips repeat : Chorus. There is no harm in kissing, Pray tell me, is there, dear ? Those rosy lips invite me now, And no one lingers near ; When loving ones are meeting, No prying eyes to mark, There is no harm in kissing (a kiss) At twilight in the park. THE KISS, DEAR MAID.

We stroll'd along where roses grow, And all was bright and fair ; He promised ever to be true, And begg'd my love to share. The little birds were flying home, They heard my lips reply, And stars were bright in yonder dome Before we said good-bye ; I ask no pledge to make me blest In gazing when alone ; Not one memorial for a breast, Whose thoughts are all thine own. But, oh, he seem'd so sad to leave, My heart grew sad as well, For love within each heart did weave Its dear bewitching spell. We linger'd, though the hour was late, How quick the time had sped ; But when our lips met at the gate, He softly to me said : Nor need I write \u2014 to tell the tale My pen were doubly weak ; Oh, what can idle words avail, Unless the heart could speak ?

Away with your fictions of flimsy romance, Those tissues of falsehood which folly has wove, Give me the mild beam of the soul-breathing glance, Or the rapture which dwells on the first kiss of love. Ye rhymers, whose bosoms with phantasy glow, Whose pastoral passions are made for the grove, From what bless'd inspiration your sonnets would flow Could you ever have tasted the first kiss of love. If Apollo should e'er his assistance refuse, Or the Nine be disposed from your service to rove, Invoke them no more, bid adieu to the muse, And try the effect of the first kiss of love.

SILENT KISSES. Leigh Hunt. We'll breathe not a kiss to the tell-tale air, Nor proclaim the fond triumph for others to share, For the rose never speaks while it opes to the dew, And lovers say little whose feelings are true ; The soul-speaking eyes are the language of blisses, And we'll talk with our eyes amidst silent kisses. 'Tis silence gives soul to the beauty of night ; 'Tis silence keeps secrets, the lover's delight : The stream moves in stillness, when soft on its breast The willows' fond leaves lie in kisses at rest : The heart throbs in stillness, and we in our blisses, Will honour its feeling by sweet silent kisses. Yes ; when our lips move, yet have nothing to say, And our eyes in each other's warm beam fade away, 'Tis then my heart springs up and trembles to thee, As the arrow still trembles when fix'd in the tree : Oh, never let ear rob a part of our blisses !

I was a child, and she was a child, In this kingdom by the sea ; But we loved with a love that was more than love, I and my Annabel Lee ; With a love that the wing'd seraphs of heaven Coveted her and me. And this was the reason that long ago, In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling My beautiful Annabel Lee, So that her high-born kinsman came, And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulchre In this kingdom by the sea. But the moon never beams without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful Annabel Lee ; And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes Of the beautiful Annabel Lee ; And so all the night tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling \u2014 my darling \u2014 my life and my bride, In the sepulchre there by the sea, In the tomb by the sounding sea.

Thomas Ward. By kind permission of The London Music Publish- ing Co., Ltd., 7, Great Marlborough St., London. My true love's love is more to me Than aught beside on earth and sea : It fills my life with golden light, And makes the darkest day seem bright ; And everything, come joy or pain, My true love loves, I love again ; Like halo round a saintly shrine, My true love's love is ever mine. Ah ! let it be mine for ever, I LOVE HIM MORE THAN I CAN SAY. Only an angel's eye can see The holy throbbings of her breast Who in her youth loves fervently, And knows the future to be blest. In his true heart she finds a throne, And reigns alone ! then, day by day, Daring with modest pride to own, \" I love him more than I can say.\" Never let love depa r; Though long years wane, Never again Banish me from thy heart. My true love's love can hallow life, And soften all its care and strife ; It breathes enchantment, fills with grace The highest and the lowliest place. Ah ! by the charm that love has wrought. And by the gladness love has brought, By all the joy my heart can prove, And every spell that bids me love ; Ah I let it be mine for ever, Never let love depart ; Though long years wane, Never again, Banish me from thy heart. Thus, one by one, pass happy years, Endearing as they onward move ; E'en surrow scarcely stirs her fears, Ennobled by such princely love. But the solemn messenger call'd Death Bears him with sudden haste away; She pleads with failing heart and breath, \" I love him more than I can say.\" A struggle ! then a holier fire ! Her soul has found its heavenward wings, And meets its love translated higher In the palace of the King of kings. The parting sorrow has pass'd by, She kneels with yearning heart to pray, Breathing, to greet his soul on high, '; I love him more than I can say.\" LINGER NEAR ME, LITTLE DARLING.

My heart is like the faded flower Whosebeauty lost, and sweetness flown. Forgot, neglected, in the bower \u25a0 Is left by all to die alone ; And thus am I, all hope is o'er, That hope so cherish 'd in my heart ; I dare not wish to see him more, The spell is broken, we must part. I love my love in the morning, I love my love at noon, For she is bright as the lord of light, Yet mild as autumn's moon : Her beauty is my bosom's sun, Her faith my fostering shade, And I will love my darling one, Till even the sun shall fade. I thought he loved ; I was deceived \u2014 Oh, would that we had never met, For though he is no more believed My heart refuses to forget. And yet, alas ! I must not tell The grief that rends my aching heart : Adieu ! for ever, fare thee well ! I love my love in the morning, I love my love at even ; Her smile's soft play is like the ray That lights the western heaven : I loved her when the sun was high, I loved her when he rose ; But. best of all, when evening's sigh Was murmuring at its close. The spell is broken, we must part. THOUGH FATE, MY GIRL, Though fate, my girl, may bid us part, Our souls it cannot, shall not sever; The heart will seek its kindred heart, And cling to it as close as ever. LOVE AGAIN. He deems that I can love again, But first I must forget The loved, the lost, whose truth and worth Enchain my spirit yet ; He wooes me in the same kind tones But must we, must we part indeed 1 Is all our dream of rapture over ? And does not Julia's bosom bleed To leave so dear, so fond a lover 1 That I was wooed before \u2014 They fall like ice upon my heart, Their former spell is o'er. Does she too mourn 1 \u2014 Perhaps she may, Perhaps she weeps our blisses fleeting ; But why is Julia's eye so gay, If Julia's heart, like mine, is beating 1 He sings the songs of other days- Alas I he does not know They but recall the past to mind, And cause my tears to flow ; He strives to soothe my aching brow, Nor deems my grief can last, But kind words only seem to me Sad echoes of the past. He tells me that I still am fair, He loves not for my face ; No vacant spot my heart contains, If he that heart could trace : I grieve to feel he loves me still, His truth but gives me pain, For who that once has truly loved Can ever love again ? I oft have loved the brilliant glow Of rapture in her blue eyes streaming\u2014 But can the bosom bleed with woe While joy is in the glances beaming ? No, no ! yet, love, I will not chide, Although your heart n-cre fond of roving ; Nor that, nor all the world beside, Could keep your faithful boy from loving You'll soon be distant from his eye, And with you all that's worth possessing Oh ! then it will be sweet to die, When life has lost its only blessing."], [95, "73 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

But I know with gold they've won thee, And thy trusting heart beguiled ; Tby mother, too, doth shun me, For she knew I loved her child.

We meet ! \u2014 but not as once we met I Our better days are o'er, And, dearly as I prize thee yet, I cannot love thee more : \u2014 My young and precious hopes were wept With many tears, away, And since thy faith so long has slept, It wakes too late to-day ! Oh ! sighs and smiles are idle, all, To raise the thoughts of youth : They come and go, without a call, They linger but with truth ; \u2014 Like roses \u2014 if to-night they die, To-morrow's sun is vain ; And oh I like birds \u2014 if once let fly, They never come again ! My heart has found no treasure yet, Like what it lost in thee, And years of long and lone regret Have made me what you see I \u2014 Then dearly welcome back again, But ask no lover's vow ; The world \u2014 that had not won it then \u2014 Tell me no more how fair she is ; I have no mind to hear The story of that distant bliss I never shall come near : B}' sad experience I have found That her perfection is my wound. And tell me not how fond I am To tempt my daring fate, From whence no triumph ever came But to repent too late : There is some hope ere long I may In silence dote myself away. I ask no pity, Love, from thee, Nor will thy justice blame ; So that thou wilt not envy me The glory of my flame, Which crowns my heart whene'er it dies, In that it falls her sacrifice.

The loved one to forget ; And speak not of another, My heart clings to him yet. He loved me once, believe me, When first I met thee, warm and young, There shone such truth about thee, And on thy lips such promise hung, I did not dare to doubt thee. I saw thee change, yet still relied : Still clung with hope the fonder, And thought, though false to all beside, From me thou couldst not wander. But go, deceiver ! go \u2014 Though now grown cold and strange, He sought not to deceive me, False friends have wrought the change. Then speak not of another, Your pleading is in vain ; Believe me, oh, my mother, I cannot love again. The heart, whose hopes could make it Trust one so false, so low, Deserves that thou shouldst break it. Tell me no more of pleasure, The world for me has none My wish'd-for prize and treasure \u2014 Hope's brightest dream \u2014 is gone. I breathe no word upbraiding, For death I know is nigh ; When every tongue thy follies named, I fled the unwelcome story ; Or found, in even the faults they blamed. Some gleams of future glory. I still was true, when nearer friends I feel my strength is fading, And peacefully would die. The flame I tried to smother Conspired to wrong, to slight thee ; The heart that now thy falsehood rends Would then have bled to right thee. Has fired my throbbing brain; My heart is breaking, mother, I cannot love again. But go, deceiver ! go ! Some day, perhaps, thou'lt waken From pleasure's dream, to know The grief of hearts forsaken. MURMUR OF THE SHELL, The Hon. Mrs. Norton. By kind permission of Chappell &. Co., 50, New Bond Street, London. Evennow.though youth its bloom has shed No lights of age adorn thee : The few who loved thee once have fled, And they who flatter scorn thee. Thy midnight cup is pledged to slaves, No genial ties enwreathe it ; The smiling there, like light on graves, Has rank cold hearts beneath it. A SAILOR left his native land, A simple gift he gave, A seashell gather'd by his hand From out the rippling wave : \" Oh, love, by this remember me ! Far inland thou must dwell \u2014 But thou shalt hear the sounding sea In the murmur of the shell.\" Ah ! woe is me ! with tatter'd sail, The ship is wildly toss'd ; A drowning cry is on the gale, They sink \u2014 and all are lost ! While happy yet, untouch'd by fear, Repeating his farewell, Poor Mary smiles, and loves to hear The murmur of the shell. The tidings wreck'd her simple brain, And smiling still she goes ; A mad girl \u2014 reckless of her pain \u2014 Unconscious of her woes I But when they ring the village chimes That toll'd her lover's knell, She sighs, and says she hears at times Death music in the shell 1 Go I go ! though worlds were thine, I would not now surrender One taintless tear of mine For all thy guilty splendour. And days may come, thou false one ! yet, When even those ties shall sever ; When thou wilt call, with vain regret, On her thou'st lost for ever ; On her who, in thy fortune's fall, With smiles had still received thee, And gladly died to prove thee all Her fancy first believed thee. Go I go I 'tis vain to curse, 'Tis weakness to upbraid thee ; Hate cannot wish thee worse Than guilt and shame have made thee."], [98, "i 76 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

When the sheep are in the fauld, and the kye at hame, And a' the world to sleep are gane, The waes o' my heart fa' in showers frae my e'e, While my gudeman lies sound by me. Young Jamie lo'ed me weel, and he sought me for his bride But saving a crown he had naething beside. To mak the crown a pound, my Jamie gaed to sea ; And the crown and the pound were baith for me. He hadna been gane a week but only twa, When my father brake his arm, and our cow was stown awa' My mother she fell sick, and my Jamie at the sea, And auld Robin Gray came a-courting me. My father couldna work, and my mither doughtna spin ; I toil'd day and night, but their bread I couldna win ; Auld Rob maintain 'd them baith, and, wi' tears in his e'e. Said, \" Jenny, for their sakes, Oh, marry me ! \" My heart it said nay \u2014 I look'd for Jamie back ; But the wind it blew high, and the ship it was a wrack, The ship it was a wrack : why didna Jenny dee ? Oh ! why was I spared to cry, Wac's me ! My father urged me sair ; my mither didna speak. She look'd in my face till my heart was like to break. So they gied him my hand, though my heart was at the sea, Now auld Robin Gray is gudeman to me. I hadna been a wife a week but only four, When sitting sae mournfully ae night at the door, I saw my Jamie's wraith, for I couldna think it he, Till he said, \" I'm come back, love, to marry thee.\" Oh sair did we greet, and muckle did we say ; We took but ae kiss, and we tore ourselves away. I wish'd I were dead ; but I'm no like to dee, Oh ! why do I live to say, Wae's me ! I gang like a ghaist, and I carena to spin ; I darena think on Jamie, for that would be a sin ; But I'll do my best a good wife to be, For auld Robin Gray is' kind to me. \"Nae langer she wept\u2014 her tears were a' spent \u2014 Despair it was come, and she thought it content, She thought it content, but her cheek it grew pale, And she dropp'd like a lily broke down by the hail.\""], [99, "77 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

She sigh'd when he caress'd her, For she knew that they must part ; She spoke not when he press'd her To his young and panting heart. The banners waved around her From \"Bohemian Girl.\" By kind permission of Chappell & Co., 50, New Bond Street, London. And she heard the bugle's sound \u2014 They pass'd \u2014 and strangers found her Cold and lifeless on the ground. 'Tis gone, the past was all a dream, The light of Use is o'er, The hope that once so bright did seem Now shines for me no more. Ah ! foolish heart, without a thought, In joy that didst believe, Nor knew what many a tale has taught, Love smiles but to deceive. THOU HAST CAST OFF THE HEART. Thou hast cast off the heart that I gave thee No more I'll join with dance and song, Nor mingle with the gay, And happy as the day is long Beguile the hours away. I'll seek me out some silent spot In solitude to grieve, And learn what many a tale has taught, Love smiles but to deceive. Like a weed that is worthless and vain ; A heart that had perish'd to save thee, Thou hast given to the bleak world again. Thine is false, and so oft hast thou told me, Lived only to beat for my own ; And the arms that were wont to enfold me, Perhaps round another are thrown. When I gazed on thy beautiful tresses, On thy brow and thy bosom of snow ; When I lived but amid thy caresses, Oh, how little my heart did I know. When I felt that young heart wildly beat- ing, I believed it could beat but for me ; The delusion was lovely, but fleeting, As all that is lovely must be. SHE NEVER BLAMED HIM By kind permission of Sheard & Co., 102, High Holborn. She never blamed him, never ; But received him when he came, With a welcome kind as ever, And she tried to look the same ; But vainly she dissembled \u2014 For whene'er she tried to smile, A tear, unbidden, trembled, In her blue eye all the while. Yet who, when thy bosom was heaving, While he drank thy bewildering sighs, Could think that thine heart was de- ceiving, And false the pure light of thine eyes ? Oh! who, when thy arms were around him, As his lips to thy kisses he press'd, Could think that thy falsehood could wound him She knew that she was dying, And she dreaded not her doom ; She never thought of sighing O'er her beauty's blighted bloom. She knew her cheek was alter'd, And she knew her eye was dim ; Her voice, though, only falter'd When she spoke of losing him. That pillow'd thy head with his breast ? But go, though that soft breast were heaven, 'Tis true that he had lured her From the isle where she was born \u2014 Its snows were an heaven alone 'Tis true he had inured her To the cold world's cruel scorn ; To the chosen one to whom it is given To rest on it all as his own. But yet she never blamed him For the anguish she had known ; And though she seldom named him, Yet she thought of him alone. Farewell, thou art false, and I leave thee : Farewell, my vain hopes I resign ; Farewell, I could never deceive thee, \u2014 The crime and the ruin are thine."], [100, "78 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

On life grown sad and love grown cold, I hear its echo wandering by.

I love to gaze on smiling faces, Beaming merry mirth and glee ; Of all creation's charms or graces, None are half so fair to me. Life is full of joy and sorrow I But while sorrow's form we see, Joy from some a heart may borrow \u2014 Oh I a smiling face for me. When I gaze on smiling faces, Though my spirits may be sad, Their very sight all grief erases, And I smile to see them glad. Some say smiles are oft deceiving, While I own some such may be ; There are many worth believing \u2014 Oh I a smiling face for me. Let others love the pearly tear, The pearly cheek adorning ; And say 'tis like a dew-drop clear, That gems the rose of morning. Let others love to see the fair With pensive mien appearing ; Be mine to hail the sprightly air, The dimpled smile endearing. It speaks good-humour's mild control, With magic fascination ; It tells the feelings of the soul, With sportive animation. Superior to the brightest eyes, Or cheek with roses blooming ; A winning charm it still supplies, The lovely face illuming. SAVE A SUNNY SMILE FOR ME, George Cooper.

Young Robin, my sweetheart, is handsome and fair, His cheeks are fresh-colour'd, and raven his hair ; My Kobin is nimble, and light on his feet, To me he's the dearest I ever did meet. But Robin's so shy, . Tis very distressing that Robin's so shy. My Robin is ready and willing, I know, To come aud escort me wherever I go ; He ne'er in his life sought a kiss, it is true, While I am quite ready to let him have two. But Robin's so shy, etc. My Robin is gentle, so loving and kind, But yet he's too bashful to speak out his mind, To offer his love with true fondness to me, And say, My dear Mary, oh ! will you have me ? But Robin's so shy, etc. But should he some morning more courage command, And say, My dear Mary, while pressing my hand, Oh ! shall we be married, pray what do you say ? Yes ! Yes ! my dear Robin, we'll marry to-day. But Robin's so shy, etc. I SAID \"NO,\" BUT I THINK I MEANT \"YES.\" What ! ask me at once, and for ever, To quit the loved home of my youth ! To sever the fond ties of kindred, And trust to your love and your truth ! Perhaps never more to revisit The haunts of my happiest years, Orthose whose kind friendship has cheer'd me, When sorrow has waken'd my tears ! I'll try, when a few years pass over, Wherever you wish me to go ; But old ties so sweetly enthrall me That now I can only say \u2014 \" No 1 \" Oh ! start not away in such anger, Nor call me inconstant, unkind ; And leave me not just at this moment, For scarcely I know my own mind I I wish not to fail in my promise, To banish for you each regret ; To leave the sweet scenes of my childhood That never my heart can forget. I would not, if possible, grieve you, My feelings perhaps you may guess ; O'erwhelm'd by contending affections, I said \"No\" \u2014 but I think I meant \" Yes.\" JUANITA. Hon. Mrs. Norton.

It pleases me and pleases her, And she's as good as gold. MARY SMILED THE CLOUDS AWAY. When my heart was sad and lonely, Like a dreary winter's day ; When I felt by all forsaken, Mary smiled the clouds away.

When matters go a little wrong, And Fortune seems to frown, If one's a wife as good as gold, One can't be long cast down ; For when I reach my home at night, She does not fret or scold, But always greets me with a smile, And that's as good as gold. Though the storms of life may gather, Oh, how sweet if all could say, When misfortune frown'd the darkest, Mary smiled the clouds away. With a gentle hand she led me, Till her voice was soft and low, Found at last a chord of feeling I had buried long ago. How I hail'd the welcome sunshine Yes, she's as good as gold, she is, She's just as good as gold, And I can see she's fond of me, For she's as good as gold. Of that ne'er forgotten day, When, in simple, artless beauty, Mary smiled the clouds away. Contented folks are happier Than those who've greatest wealth, For gold does not buy happiness, Nor can it purchase health ; My wife and I will be content, When we have both growu old, To be as happy then as now, And that's as good as gold. Though the storms, etc. Years have pass'd, but true as ever, Mary's heart responds to mine ; Still to each we cling as fondly As the ivy or the vine. When approaching storms of sorrow Hide the sunshine's golden ray, Then, her loving arms around me, Mary smiles the clouds away. Yes, she's as good as gold, she is.

By kind permission of Robert Cocka & Co., New Bnrlington Street, London.

Round every tale to me you've told, And every song you've sung, And every spot where we have been, A hallow'd charm is flung : How dear to me the broomy knowes, The greenwood's fragrant shade, The flowery fields, the verdant banks, And braes where we have stray'd ! Then let the stranger live, sweet Kate, Amid its neighbours dark, Until they, too, in time shall pale Beneath the spoiler's mark.

While plodding on our way, the toilsome road of life, How few the friends that daily there we meet, Not many will stand by, in trouble and in strife, With counsel and affection ever sweet. But there is one whose smile will ever onus beam, Whose love is dearer far than any other, And wherever we may turn, this lesson we will learn, A boy's best friend is his mother. Then cherish her with care, and smooth her silv'ry hair, When gone you will never get another, And wherever we may turn, this lesson we shall learn, A boy's best friend is his mother. Though all the world may frown, and every friend depart, She never will forsake us in our need, Our refuge evermore is still within her heart, For us her loving sympathy will plead ; Her pure and gentle smile for ever cheers our way, 'Tis sweeter and 'tis purer than all other, When she goes from earth away, we'll find out while we stray, A boy's best friend is his mother. Then cherish her with care, etc. Her fond and gentle face not long may greet us here, Then cheer her with our kindness and our love, Remember at her knee, in childhood bright and dear, We heard her voice like angel's from above ; Though after years may bring their gladness or their woe, Her love is sweeter far than any other ; And our longing heart will learn, wherever we may turn, A boy's best friend is his mother.

The foremost picture in my mind is one I'll ne'er forget, Though years have dimm'd its brightness it is here before me yet : The picture is a cottage with the ivy trailing o'er, An aged woman and a boy are standing at the door. That woman was my mother, I was going far away, The sorrow in her eyes was more than any words could say, Her only boy was leaving her, perhaps for many years, And, trying to be brave, she spoke, in accents full of tears : Be upright and honest, fearless and bold, Remember that honour is purer than gold ; You may not be a hero, but still when you come back, Your mother will be proud of you, her own boy Jack ! Our hearts were torn with sorrow, yet the parting had to come, I tried to look so manly, but my boyish voice was dumb ; She sat the last few moments 'neath the branches of the vine, And let her trembling hand within my curly locks entwine. She said, where'er you Wander, Jack, on land or on the sea, If ever you are tempted, let your thoughts come back to me ; Remember how your father lived, remember how he died, Take my advice, you'U be like him, your mother's joy and pride. Be upright and honest, etc. And, after years of absence, to the homestead I return'd, An honour'd name and fortune in the struggle I had earn'd, The mother whom I loved was there to meet me at the door, And then and there I vow'd that I would never leave her more. I stay'd to close the dear old eyes, which once shone clear and bright, I kiss'd the lips which ne'er again would greet me with delight, And even now amid the friends who've lasted many a year, I'd give the whole world's riches if that voice I could but near.

How well I do remember, now many years ago, I journey'd down to Portsmouth with my mother, you must know j The ships were in the harbour, with flags and banners dress'd, And weeping wives and mothers were waiting with the rest. My father was a sailor on board a man-o'-war, And -once again was going to leave us by the shore ; He kiss'd our lips at parting, when standing on the quay, And as he bade us both good-bye, these words he said to me \" Stick to your mother, Tom, when I am gone, Don't let her worry, lad, don't let her mourn ; Bemember that she nursed you when I was far away Don't leave your mother when her hair turns grey.\" The time roll'd slowly onward, many changes had occurr'd, But of the good ship Victor for months we had not heard. My mother grew so anxious, her cheek was wan and pale, And I was very fearful that she suddenly might fail. At length there came a telegram to say the ship was lost, She'd founder'd manv miles away when she'd been tempest-toss'd. My mother fainted at the news, but when the swoon had fled, I kiss'd her as I told her of the words my father said. \" Stick to your mother, Tom,\" etc. She linger'd through the summer, until the frost and snow And bitter winds of winter very quickly laid her low ; She died in my embraces, with a spirit calm and brave, And now she's sleeping sweetly where the wild-flowers gently wave. I often go to see her grave and keep the verdure green, And plant some fragrant lilies there around the peaceful scene ; And I feel a satisfaction of knowing,. now she's dead, I tried to do my duty to the words my father said. \" Stick to your mother, Tom,\" etc. NO LOVE IS LIKE A MOTHER'S, Phil Rossiter. A mother's love ! with that fond word, What mem'ries in the heart are stirr'd\u2014 The tender look, the gentle smile, The hand that shielded us from guile, The heart that shared each joy or woe, With feeling mothers only know ; The soft sweet voice like cooing dove \u2014 For no love's like a mother's love. A mother's love, how sweet the name ! A noble ever-burning flame ; In infancy our steps it trains, And like a spirit o'er us reigns. It watches o'er us every hour, And soothes our ills with magic power ; From earth below to heaven above, No love is like a mother's love. Though other hearts may fondly bless, And other loving arms caress ; From earth below to heaven above, Though other hearts may fondly bless, And other loving arms caress ; From earth below to heaven above, No love is like a mother's love.

I've been thinking of the day that has long since pass'd away When my mother through sickness droop'd and died, And the still and silent room when they laid her in the tomb, I remember then how bitterly I cried : I but a boy was then, my age was scarcely ten, And with sorrow I had grown thin and pale ; When the home had to be sold, I cried with grief untold, Oh ! save my mother's picture from the sale. My mother's face, that dear old face, Her loss I ever shall bewail, Don't break an orphan's heart, with that don't make me part, Oh ! save my mother's picture from the sale. The auction day came round, with mirth the room did sound, The things I loved so well soon pass'd away, The chair in which she sat and in which she liked to chat, They all went into strangers' hands that day ; The table where I play'd, the cot in which I laid, All pass'd away like chaff before the gale, But when the end came near I cried with piteous fear, Oh ! save my mother's picture from the sale. My mother's face, etc The picture round was pass'd and questions they were ask'd, A price was bid for it just here and there, The tears stream'd down my face, I could scarce keep in the place When I saw the picture pass without a care ; But an angel of a girl, with a mass of golden curls, Who was struck to see my face so sad and pale, Outbid them all you see and presented it to me, And saved my mother's picture from the sale. My mother's face, etc. I CANNOT CALL HER MOTHER. The marriage rite is over ; And though I turn'd aside, To keep the guests from seeing The tears I could not hide, I wreathed my face in smiling, And led my little brother To greet my father's chosen, But I could not call her mother. She is a fair young creature, With meek and gentle air ; With blue eyes soft and loving, With silken sunny hair. I know my father gives her The love he bore another ; But if she were an angel I could never call her mother. To night I heard her singing A song I used to love, When its sweet notes were uttered It pain'd my heart to hear it, And my tears I could not smother, For every word was hallow'd By the dear voice of my mother. My father, in the sunshine Of happy days to come, May half forget the shadow That darken'd our old home. His heart no more is lonely \u2014 But myself and little brother Must still be orphan children : God can give us but one mother. They've borne my mother's picture From its accustom'd place, And set beside my father's A younger, fairer face. They've made her dear old chamber The boudoir of another ; But I will not forget thee, My own, my angel mother. By her who sings above."], [177, "155 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

I love it ! and who shall dare To chide me for loving that old arm-chair ? I've treasured it long as a sainted prize, I've bedew'd it with tears, I've embalm'd it with sighs ; 'Tis bound by a thousand bands to my heart ; Not a tie will break, not a link will start ! Would you know the spell 1 \u2014 a mother sat there ! And a sacred thing is that old arm-chair. In childhood's hour I linger'd near The haUow'd seat with list'ning ear ; And gentle words that mother would give To fit me to die, and teach me to live. She told me that shame would never betide, With Truth for my creed, and God for my guide ; She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer, As I knelt beside the old arm-chair. I sat and watch'd her many a day, When her eye grew dim, and her locks were grey ; And I almost worshipp'd her when she smiled, And turn'd from her Bible to bless her child. Years roll'd on, but the last one sped \u2014 My idol was shatter'd, my earth-star fled I I learn'd how much the heart can bear, When I saw her die in her old arm-chair. 'Tis past, 'tis past I but I gaze on it now With quiv'ring breath and throbbing brow ; 'Twas there she nursed me, 'twas there she died, And mem'ry flows with lava tide. Say it is folly, and deem me weak, Whilst scalding drops start down my cheek ; But 1 love it I I love it I and cannot tear My soul from a mother's old arm-chair. MY MOTHER DEAR. Samuel Lover.

My mother dear ! my mother dear !

There's anguish in a mother's fear, When farewell fondly taking, That so the heart of pity moves, It scarcely keeps from breaking. And when a mother kneels to Heaven, Above the quiet of the west The sunset banners hung, And backward from the mountain's crest The golden gateway swung.

May love shine ne'er again ! \" Then I heard a murmur of voices sweet, As of sounds that softly pray ; And lo ! as I gazed through the shadowy air, Stood an angel in the way ; Around him gather'd a little throng, So dear in the days of yore ; And I knew that my darlings who faded away Had come back to my heart once more. They whisper'd low to my wistful ear A promise of perfect peace, They beckon'd me on to that happier land Where the strife and storm shall cease. \" Fear not, fear not, fear not,\" they said, \" Life's lonely path ; for love o'er all doth shin\", And the hands that part by the world's wide sea Shall meet on a shore divine.\" CHILDREN'S HAPPY VOICES.

The children are playing at sundown, Under the crimson west, And they laugh, in the peaceful twilight, With never a thought of rest ; But soon cometh night, my bairnies, And soon ye must fall asleep, The little hearts all untroubled, To whom every word is dear, For the faltering prayers of the children Are the first that the angels hear. And wrapp'd in their dreamings deep. Then, bairnies, my bonnie bairnies, Play on in the sundown sweet ; For night brings peace, my darlings, And rest for the weary feet ! The children are singing at sundown A strain from the long ago, That floats o'er the peaceful meadow, Where sweet winds gently blow : Sing on, 'tis the even song, dears, And even must come for all, When starlight gleams above us, And deep'ning shadows fall. Then, bairnies, my bonnie bairnies, Sing on in the sundown sweet ; For night brings peace, my darlings, And rest for the weary feet ! When the heart with its grief is heavy, And the eyes can no longer weep ; When we walk with footsteps weary, Where the shadows gather deep : There is One who sees all our sorrow, Who teaches our heart to pray, That the simple faith of the children May be ours on our lifelong way. PUSS IN THE CORNER. Gus. Williams. What pleasure to me evening brings, When toil and worry's o'er, To see the young ones run about, And play upon the floor ; 'Tis then that little Harry, With Nellie, Kate, and May, With merry shout will romp about In happy childish play. God keep you, my bonnie bairnies, Alike through night and day ; God grant you His tender angels To watch o'er your life's rough way ; To lead you at last, my bairnies, When the dreary toil is o'er, Where the tired little feet find resting, And the children weep no more. Puss in the corner, puss in the corner, That's what the little ones shout ; Puss in the corner, puss in the corner, Laughing and romping about ; Puss in the corner, puss in the corner, Swiftly the hours take wing, Sweet voices ringing, joy to me bringing, The song that my little ones sing. Then, bairnies, my bonnie bairnies, Sleep on, 'neath the golden west ; For peace comes down at nightfall, And God will give us rest, And God will give us rest."], [200, "178 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD-M Music of all the Songs in this Book may be had of all Music-sellers. BAIRNS. And still He plays in pure sweet glee, And still her eyes with tears are dim; He knows not that she weeps to see The shadow looming over Him. And so, in glad and gloomy hours, Across our life's wide garden fair, Where'er we go a shadow lowers, The shadow of the Cross we bear. Mary Mark-Lemon. By kind permission of Evans & Co., 33, Argyll Street, London. There are hours so bright and golden, That haunt the bygone years, When the children were but children, With their many smiles and tears. They have faded with the roses, The bairns are bairns no more, But the music of their laughter Ever floats'across life's shore. Hear us, 0 Lord ! Help us to see Life's shadows changing To perfect light in Thee. Hear us, 0 Lord ! Grant us to see There are places in the meadows, Where the children used to play, Happy-hearted as the sunshine That softly fell across the way. There are places in the grass-land, Where the children are at rest, When the bairns are bairns for ever, Heaven's glory round us, And to dwell, to dwell with Thee. THE ROAD TO PARADISE, E. Williams. By kind permission of A. Hays, 26, Old Bond Street, London. Dreaming dreams so calm and blest ! Where busy people throng the street, And tall, dark houses rise, There are places in each heart, dear, Where some golden head has lain, And the glad remembrance softens Every sorrow, every pain. And it may be when we enter The golden gate on high, We shall wake as little children A little nameless child goes forth To seek for Paradise ; Her mother and the baby boy Are there, the neighbours say: How pleased they'll be, can she but find To Paradise the way I From the world's long lullabye. Her little feet press quickly on, Each unknown path she tries, And then in gentle voice she asks The way to Paradise. Some pass her by with laugh and stare, One pityingly replies ; Some kindly speak, but none can tell The way to Paradise. THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS. F. E. Weatlierly. Themusicofthis song is published by J. B. Cramer & Co., Regent Street, London. Through all the busy heedless town, Beside the restless sea, By fields where happier children play, She wanders wearily. Her step is growing feeble now, And dim the sweet dark eyes, Yet onward still she bravely goes, \" 'Tis far to Paradise.\" The cloudless noontide's golden rays Shine gladly o'er the holy Child, Among the flowers He darts and plays, Before His Virgin mother mild ; When lo ! against the garden walls, And o'er the open sunlit room, Where'er He plays a shadow falls, The shadow of His Cross of doom. Hear us, O Lord I The fleecy snowflakes kiss her brow Upon the lone, wild moor ; They wrap her in a pure white shroud, Her wanderings are o'er : The storm goes down, the clear starsshine, The night wind-round her sighs, God's angels now have shown the road That leads to Paradise. Help us to be Childlike, contented, And more and more like Thee, Hear us, O Lord 1 Help us to see No love, no hope of joy, Apart, apart from Thee."], [201, "179 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

Ye'll find him where the brave men stand, On the dreadful battle day ; I do not know your little boy, So, mother, ask no more : Ye'll raise for him your strong, true hand \u2014 My laddie far away.

For golden hair and soft blue eyes We sailors little care ; The bold and brave, 'tis they alone, Their messmates' friendship share. Ye'll tell him that his mother's prayer ; Is his by night and day ; There is a sunburnt brawny lad, A strong rough mate like me, Ye'll tell him that he's still her care, My laddie far away ! He was the only boy I know That went with us to sea. Ye'll tell him, for there's none so light, So light of heart as he, With that he doffd his tarry hat And flung it in the air ; I would that in his lightsome hours My lad might think of me. Above the sunburnt cheek she saw The brow, the golden hair. And then a look of sunshine flash'd From out his eyes of blue, Ye 11 bring him home when battle's past, So please kind Heaven, ye may ; He needed not to speak again, Her boy the mother knew. Yell bring him safely home at last, My laddie far away. Ye'll bring him, for I've none so dear, I've none so dear as he, And here, he said, are guineas bright, And hard 'twill go with me, Dear mother, if you e'er repent Your Bobin went to sea.

Charles Wolfe. If I had thought thou could'st have died, I might not weep for thee ; But I forgot, when by thy side, That thou could'st mortal be : It never through my mind had pass'd, The time would e'er be o'er \u2014 And I on thee should look my last, And thou should'st smile no more 1 WHY MUST WE SAY \"GOOD-BYE\"? Henry J. Treadwell. And still upon that face I look, And think 'twill smile again ; And still the thought I will not brook That I must look in vain ! But when I speak \u2014 thou dost not say What thou ne'er left'st unsaid ; And now I feel, as well I may, Sweet Mary ! thou art dead ! The music of this song is published by J. B. Cramer & Co., Regent Street, London. I entee'd the ancient minster On a snmmer's evening bright, And the setting sun through the windows Shed a flood of golden light. I was weary and worn -with toiling, With the burden and heat of day, So I sat in the gathering twilight, And dreamt I was far away. If thou would'st stay, e'en as thou art, All cold and all serene \u2014 I still might press thy silent heart, And where thy smiles have been ! While e'en thy chill bleak corse I have, Thou seemest still mine own ; We wander'd once more through the woodlands, We sat 'neath the same old tree, We whisper'd the old, old story Of a love that was sweet to me But there, I lay thee in thy grave \u2014 And I am now alone ! Oh, love, thou art mine for ever, Oh, love, I am thine for aye, Why should we ever part, dear ? Why must we say \" good-bye \" ? I do not think, where'er thou art, Thou hast forgotten me ; And I, perhaps, may soothe this heart, In thinking, too, of thee : Yet there was round thee such a dawn But we said farewell for ever, And parted with many a sigh ; Our hearts were sad and broken, . Of light ne'er seen before, As Fancy never could have drawn, And never can restore 1 But our love will never die."], [226, "204 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

I eemember, I remember The house where I was born, The little window where the sun Came creeping in at morn : He never came a wink too soon, Nor brought too long a day ; But now I often wish the night Had borne my breath away. Oh, the garden I remember, In the gay and sunny Spring, When our laughter made the thickets And the arching alleys ring ! Oh, the merry burst of gladness ! Oh, the soft and tender tone I I remember, I remember The roses, red and white, The violets and the lily-cups\u2014 Those flowers made of light ; The lilacs where the robin built, And where my brother set. The laburnum on his birthday \u2014 The tree is living yet ! Oh, the whisper, never utter'd Save to one fond ear alone 1 Oh, the light of life that sparkled In those bright and beauteous eyes 1 Ob, the blush of happy beauty \u2014 Tell- tale of the heart's surprise ! Oh, the radiant light that girdled Field and forest, land and sea, I remember, I remember Where I was used to swing, And thought the air must rush as fresh To swallows on the wing ; lly spirits flew in feathers then That are so heavy now, And summer pools could hardly cool The fever on my brow. When we all were young together, And the earth was new to me ! Where are now the flowers we tended ? \u2014 Wither'd, broken, branch and stem. Where are now the hopes we cherish 'd ? \u2014 Scatter'd to the winds with them. I remember, I remember The fir trees dark and high ; I used to think their slender tops Were close against the sky : It was a childish ignorance, But now 'tis little joy To know I'm farther off from heaven For ye, too, were flowers, ye dear ones ! Nursed in hope and rear'd in love, Looking fondly ever upward To the clear blue heaven above. Than when I was a boy."], [237, "215 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

I STOOD on the bridge at midnight, As the clock was striking the hour, And the moon rose o'er the city Behind the dark church tower, The veteran forgot His friends were changed or gone, The manly forms around him there As children he had known ; He pointed to the spot Where his dwelling used to be, Then told his name, and, smiling said, \" You now remember me ? \" And, like the waters rushing Among the wooden piers, A flood of thoughts came o'er me That fill'd mine eyes with tears. How often, oh, how often, In the days that had gone by, I had stood on the bridge at midnight, And gazed on that wave and sky ! How often, oh, how often, In the days that had gone by, I had stood on the bridge at midnight, And gazed on that wave and sky !

Alas ! none knew him there ; He pointed to a stone, On which the name he breathed was traced, A name to them unknown ; And then the old man wept, \" I'm friendless now,\" cried he, \" Where I had many friends in youth, Not one remembers me.\" ONLY A FACE AT THE WINDOW. By land permission of Edwin Ashdown, Ltd. , Hanover Square, London. Only a face at the window, Only a face, nothing more ; Yet the look in thoseeyes as they metmine Still comes to me o'er and o'er. For my heart was hot and restless, And my life was full of care, And the burthen laid upon me Seem'd greater than I could bear. But now it has fallen from me, Only a face at the window, etc. Only a word of greeting, It is buried in the sea, And only the sorrow of others Throws its shadow over me. Only a word, that was all ; Yet all day in my heart it echoed Like the sound of an angel call. Only a face at the window, etc. Only a smile of welcome, Yet whenever I cross the river, On its bridge with wooden piers. Like the odour of brine from the ocean Comes the thought of other years ; And for ever and for ever, As long as the river flows, As long as the heart has passions, As long as life has woes, The moon and its broken reflection Only a smile as I pass'd, But that smile will still be remerjaber'd As long as my life shaU last.

For grief with heavy wing hath shaded The hopes too bright to last. The corn was springing fresh and green, And the lark sang loud and high, The world, with morning's mantle clouded, Shines forth with purer rays ; And the red was on your lip, Mary, And the love-light in your eye. But the heartne'erfeelsinsorrow shrouded The light of other days. The place is little changed, Mary, The day is bright as then ; The leaf which autumn tempests wither, The birds which then take wing, The lark's loud song is in my car, And the corn is green again ! When winter's winds are past, come hither, To welcome back the spring. But I miss the soft clasp of your hand, And your breath warm on my cheek, The very ivy on the ruin, In gloom, full life displays ; And I still- keep list'ning for the words You never more may speak. But the heart alone sees no renewing The light of other days. 'Tis but a step down yonder lane, And the little church stands near ; The church where we were wed, Mary, I see the spire from here. IN THIS OLD CHAIR MY But the graveyard lies between, Mary, And my step would break your rest, FATHER SAT. E. Fitzball. For I've laid you, darling, down to sleep, With your baby on your breast. Published by Chappell & Co., 50, New Bond Street, London. In this old chair my father sat, In this my mother smiled ; I'm very lonely now, Mary, For the poor make no new friends ; But, oh ! they love the better far I hear their blessings on me wait, And feel myself a child. The few our Father sends ; And you were all I had, Mary, I feel the kiss of their fond love, Oh, joy ! oh, joy ! too bright to last ! My blessing and my pride : Ah ! why will cruel time remove Or mem'ry paint the past 1 There's nothing left to care for now, Since my poor Mary died I And here, alas 1 when they were gone, In beauty's own array, I'm bidding you a long farewell, My Mary, kind and true ! A pitying angel on me shone, To chase each grief away. But I'll not forget yon, darling, In the land I'm going to ! They say there's bread and work for all, But oh I it was delusive love, Alas ! too sweet, too pure to last, And the sun shines always there ; But I'll not forget old Ireland, And if such dream time must remove, Why, mem'ry, paint the past ?

Songs about Loving Remembrance THE DAYS THAT ARE NO MORE. O memories of green and pleasant places, Where happy birds their woodnotes twitter'd low I O love that lit the dear familiar faces We buried long ago ! From barren heights their sweetness we remember, And backward gaze with wistful, yearning eyes, As hearts regret, 'mid snow-drifts of December, The summer's sunny skies. Glad hours that seem'd their rainbow tints to borrow From some illumined page of fairy lore ; Bright days that never lack'd a bright to-morrow, Days that return no more. Fair gardens, with their many blossom'd alleys, And red, ripe roses breathing out perfume ; Deep violet nooks in green, sequester'd valleys, Empurpled o'er with bloom. Sunset that lighted up the brown-leaved beeches, Turning their dusky glooms to glittering gold ; Moonlight that on the river's fern-fringed beaches Stream'd white-ray'd, silvery cold. O'er moorlands bleak we wander weary-hearted, Through many a tangled, wild, and thorny maze, Bemembering, as in dreams, the days departed, The bygone, happy days. OH! BREATHE NOT HIS NAME. Moore. Oh ! breathe not his name ; let it sleep In the shade, Where cold and unhonour'd his relics are laid ; Sad, silent, and dark be the tears that we shed, As the night-dew that falls on the grass o'er his head. But the night-dew that falls, though in silence it weeps, Shall brighten with verdure the grave where he sleeps ; And the tear that we shed, though in secret it rolls, Shall long keep his memory green in our souls."], [250, "228 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD. may be had of all Music -sellers.

You call me sweet and tender names, and softly smooth my tresses, And all the while my happy heart beats time to your caresses : You love me in your tender way, I answer as you let me ; But ah ! there comes another day, the day when you'll forget me. I know that every fleeting hour is mark'd by thoughts I bring you, 1 know there dwells a subtle power in the sweet songs I sing you, I do not fear the darkest way, with those dear arms about me : Ah ! no, I only dread the day when you can live without me.

We were boys and girls together, When the step was firm and light, When the voice was clear and ringing, And the laughing eyes were bright ; Then our love sought no concealment, And our bosoms knew no art, And the sunshine of our childhood I spoke of hope \u2014 I spoke of fear, \u2014 Thy answer was a blush and tear ; But this was eloquence to me, And more than I had ask'd of thee.

IN the sky the bright stars giitter'd, On the grass the moonlight fell, Hush'd the sound of daylight's bustle, Closed the pink-eyed pimpernel ; All along the moss-grown woodpatch, Where the cattle love to roam, It may be that our youthful days To her were memories dear, For when I turn'd on her my gaze, She scarce could hide a tear ; I whisper'd fondly, trusting still, Ah ! need I name the theme ? From Aunt Patty's quibbling party, I was seeing Kelly home. Jetty ringlets softly flutter'd O'er a brow as white as snow, And her cheek \u2014 the crimson sunset Scarcely had a warmer glow ; 'Mid her parted lips vermilion, White teeth flash'd like ocean foam : The sweetest thought my mind can sill Is still my boyhood's dream.

White hair mingles with my tresses, Furrows steal upon my brow, But my love's smile cheers and blesses Life's declining moments now. Matron, in the snowy kerchief, Closer to my bosom come, Tell me, dost thou still remember When I saw sweet Nelly home ? Faces that I used to cherish, Lips that whisper'd soft and low, Come in flitting visions to me, i Shadows of the long ago.

Hush'd be that sigh, be dried that tear, Cease boding doubt, cease anxious fear- Dried be that tear. Let them fall, then, in our sorrow, Let them wash the bonnie cheek : Where the wounded heart may borrow Comfort ; let it, for 'tis weak.

And does that thought affect thee, too, The thought of Sylvio's death, That he, who only breathed for you, Must jield that faithful breath ? Hush'd be that sigh, be dried that tear. Nor let us lose our heaven here \u2014 Let them fall, then, in our sorrow, Let them wash the bonnie cheek : Where the wounded heart may borrow Comfort ; let it, for 'tis weak. Dried be that tear.

And softly flutt'ring here and there, He never sought to cleave the air, But chirrup'd oft, and free from care, Tuned to her ear his grateful strain Now having pass'd the gloomy bourne B'rom whence he never can return, His death and Lesbia's grief I mourn, Who sighs, alas I but sighs in vain."], [272, "250 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

I SAW thee weep ; the big bright tear Came o'er that eye of blue ; And then methought it did appear A violet dropping dew. I saw thee smile ; the sapphire's blaze Beside thee ceased to shine : I whisper'd her a last adieu, I gave a mournful kiss, , Cold showers of sorrow bathed her eyes, And her poor heart was torn with sighs ; YTt t, strange to tell, 'twas then I knew Most perfect bliss. It could not match the living rays That fill'd that glance of thine. For love, at other times suppress'd, Was all betray'd at this ; I saw him, weeping, in her eyes, I heard him breathe among her sighs ; And every sob which shook her breast Thrill'd mine with bliss. As clouds from yonder sun receive A deep and mellow dye, Which scarce the shade of coming-eve Can banish from the sky \u2014 Those smiles unto the moodiest mind Their own pure joy impart, Their sunshine leaves a glow behind That lightens o'er the heart. The sight which keen affection clears, How can it judge amiss ? To me it pictured hope, and taught My spirit this consoling thought, \u2014 That Love's sun, though it rise in tears, May set in bliss. THE TEAR. On beds of snow the moonbeam slept, And chilly was the midnight gloom, When by the damp grave Ellen wept\u2014 Sweet maid, it was her Lindor's tomb. A warm tear gush'd, the wintry air Congeal'd it as it flow'd away ; All night it lay a dewdrop there, At morn it glitter'd in the ray. An angel wandering from her sphere, Who saw this bright and frozen gem, To dew-eyed Pity brought the tear, And hung it on her diadem. THE TEAR. Rogers. Oh I that the chemist's magic art Could crystallise this sacred treasure, Long should it glitter near the heart, A secret source of pensive pleasure. The little brilliant ere it fell, Its lustre caught from Chloe's eye, Then trembling left its coral cell, The spring of sensibility ! WERT THOU LIKE ME, Sir Walter Scott. Sweet drop of pure and pearly light, In thee the rays of virtue shine, More calmly clear, more mildly bright, Than any gem that gilds the mine. Published by Sheard & Co., 192, High Holborn, London. Wert thou like me in life's low vale, With thee how blest, that lot I'd share , With thee I'd fly wherever gale Could waft, or bounding galley bear. But parted, by severe decree, Far different must our fortunes prove: May thine be joy \u2014 enough for me To weep and pray for him I love ! '1 he pangs this foolish heart must feel, When hope shall be forever slowu, Xo sullen murmur shall reveal, No selfish murmur ever own. Xor will I through life's weary years Like a pale drooping mourner move, While I can think my secret tears May wound the heart of him I love ! Benign restorer of the soul ! Who ever fly'st to bring relief. When first we feel the rude control Of love or pity, joy or grief.

THE LABOURER'S NOON- DAY HYMN. His hair is crisp, and black, and long, His face is like the tan ; His brow is wet with honest sweat, He earns whate'er he can, And looks the whole world in the face, Wordsworth. Up to the throne of God is borne The voice of praise at early morn ; And He accepts the punctual hymn, Sung as the light of day grows dim ; For he owes not any man. Nor will He turn His ear aside From holy offerings at noon-tide ; Then, here reposing, let us raise A song of gratitude and praise. Week in, week out, from morn till night, You can hear his bellows blow ; You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, With measured beat and slow, Like a sexton ringing the village bell, When the evening sun is low. What though our burden be not light ? We need not toil from morn till night ; The respite of the mid-day hour Is in the thankful creature's power. And children coming home from school Look in at the open door ; They love to see the flaming forge, And hear the bellows roar, Blest are the moments, doubly blest, That, drawn from this our hour of rest, Are with a ready heart bestow'd Upon the service of our God ! And catch the burning sparks that fly, Like chaff from a threshing floor. He goes on Sunday to the church, And sits among his boys ; He hears the parson pray and preach, He hears his daughter's voice Singing in the village choir, And it makes his heart rejoice. Why should we crave a hallow'd spot ? An altar is in each man's cot ; A church in every grove that spreads Its living roof above our heads. Look up to heaven ! the industrious sun Already half his race hath run ; He cannot halt nor go astray, But our immortal spirits may. It sounds to him like her mother's voice, Singing in Paradise ! He needs must think of her once more, How in the grave she lies ; And with his rough hard hand he wipes A tear out of his eyes. Lord I since his rising in the east, If we have falter'd or transgress'd, Guide from Thy love's abundant source What yet remains of this day's course.

Oh, life is a river, and man is the boat That over its surface is destined to float ! And joy is a cargo so easily stored, That he is a fool who takes sorrow on board. We all have a taste of the ups and the downs, As fortune dispenses her smiles and her frowns ; But may we not hope, if she's frowning to-day, That to-morrow she'll lend us the light of her ray ?

There's plenty of sunshine, then why choose the shade ? Half the clouds that come o'er us our own fears have made : Then go right ahead, and there's joy's smiling bay, Why run from our course to meet trouble half way ? Would summer be prized for its fruits and its flowers If winter ne'er follow'd with storm, winds, and showers? And does not the brightest of pleasures appear Still brighter when chequer'd by moments of care ?

Now bring the massive yule log, the fire pile well up, For we must draw around it to drain the wassail cup ; The harmless joke shall pass around, with spirits gay and light ; Our laughter shall ring out aloud and echo here to-night ; The old their gossip shaU enjoy, the youth with mirth combine : It was my father's custom, and so it shall be mine. Now see the gnests assemble, each with a smiling face ; They bend their heads in silence, to ask a holy grace : Hark ! the glasses rattle ; the guests enjoy their cheer: And see, the viands, great and small, quickly disappear: Be gay, my friends, be merry, boys, to feast let none decline . It was my father's custom, and so it shall be mine.

In happier hours, my pleasure all day Was to rove with the thoughtless, or dance with the gay ; Through life as I sported, no clouds could I see, And the hearts that were gayest were dearest to me. But now in affliction, how changed is the view, The gay hearts are many \u2014 sincere ones are few. Though some come around us to laugh and to jest, In sickness or sorrow they shrink from the test ; Their love and their friendship endure for a while, When fortune is smiling, they also can smile ; Like blossoms that wither when daylight is gone, And lose all their sweetness when out of the sun. But you, in my sorrow, still faithfully came, And though I am alter'd, I find you the same ; Whene'er you come near me, no pleasure you find, But always leave something like pleasure behind ; Like the night-blowing cereus, which sheds its perfume, And opens its blossoms midst darkness and gloom.

Listen to me I To be kind is the way to meet kindness, If not, what's the use of regret 1 Bail not at the world for its blindness, But pity, forgive, and forget. Our old friends no doubt will be true friends, The longer we love them the more ; But shut not your eyes against new friends, Though one be but true in a score.

They whistle when the storm-bird wheels in circles round the mast, And sing when, deep in foam, the ship ploughs onward to the blast. What care the mariners for gales 1 there's music in their roar, When wide the berth along the lee, and leagues of waves before : Let billows toss to mountain-heights, or sink to chasms low, The vessel stout will ride it out, nor reel beneath the blow.

The gale follows far abaft. We shoot through the sparkling foam, Like an ocean bird set free \u2014 Daek was the night, and fierce the blast : Almost in port, the men at last Clearly could hear the billows roar, Dashing against the angry shore ; And some stout hearts began to quail At those dread rocks so close to lee, But ever through the whistling gale The Captain cried out sturdily : Like the ocean bird, our home We'll find far out in the sea.

An old man sits by his cabin door, And he lists to the sound of the breakers' roar ; Many a night, in the dim time past, He has stemm'd the wave, he has braved the blast. But now the fisherman bends his head, And his brave old face has a look of dread, For he knows that a perilous night 'twill be, And his only son is away at sea. But the fisherboy far in his lonely boat Sings, \" Merry it is o'er the waves to float \" ; The fisherboy far in his lonely boat Sings, \" Merry it is o'er the waves to float. The old dame sits by the cabin fire, And she piles the driftwood fuel higher, And prays that its ruddy blaze may be A beacon-light to her boy at sea ; But a tear steals oft to her weary eyes, As she makes the bright flame flash and rise, For the hour is past that his welcome cheer Should gladden her heart, and he comes not near. Still the fisherboy sings in his lonely boat, \" Merry it is,\" etc. A maiden comes to the cabin door \u2014 She cannot sleep for the breakers' roar ; She had seen the bark in the morn depart, And a fear now falls on her throbbing heart. Oh I wretched it is alone to be, And the loved one far on a stormy sea ; But hark ! there's a cheery \" Shore ahoy ! \" 'Tis the well-known shout of the fisherboy !

[This in said to be the finest sea song in the World.] When war spread its wide desolation, And threaten'd our land to deform, Ye mariners of England, That guard our native seas, Whose flag has braved a thousand years The battle and the breeze ; Your glorious standard launch again, To match another foe, The ark of Freedom's foundation, Britannia rode safe through the storm With her garland of victory round her, So bravely she bore up her crew, And her flag floated proudly before her, The boast of the red, white, and blue. And sweep through the deep, While the stormy tempests blow, While the battle rages loud and long, And stormy tempests blow. The wine cup, the wine cup, bring hither, And fill it up true to the brim : May the wreath Nelson won never wither, Nor the star of his glory grow dim. May the service united ne'er sever, But still to her colours prove true, The Army and Navy for ever, Three cheersfor the red, white.andblue.

But, oh ! what rapture fills each breast Of the hopelesscrewof the ship distress'd ! Then, landed safe, what joy to teU Of all the dangers that befeU ! Then is heard no more, By the watch on shore, The minute gun at sea. A shudder shot through every vein \u2014 All eyes were turn'd on high : \u2014 There stood the boy, with dizzy brain, Between the sea and sky. No hold had he above, below \u2014 YE GENTLEMEN OF ENG- LAND. Martin Parker. Alone he stood in air ; At that far height none dared to go, No aid could reach him there. Ye gentlemen of England That live at home at ease, Ah I little do you think upon The dangers of the seas. Give ear unto the mariners, And they will plainly show All the cares and the fears We gazed \u2014 but not a man could speak With horror all aghast, In groups, with pallid brow and cheek, We watch'd the quivering mast. The atmosphere grew thick and hot, And of a lurid hue, When the stormy winds do blow. When the stormy, etc. As riveted unto the spot Stood officers and crew. The sailor must have courage, No danger he must shun, In every kind of weather His course he still must run.

When the stormy, etc. The father came on deck \u2014 Hegasp'd, \"Oh, God, Thy will be done !' Then suddenly a rifle grasp'd, And aim'd it at his son ! \" Jump far out, boy \u2014 into the wave !

By kind permission of Rohert Cocks & Co., New Burlington Street, London, Oh ! a tight Uttle craft was the Homeward Bound As ever upon the sea was found ; She'd a right good captain, and a right good crew, A right good cook and a bo'sun too ! But the right good cook had a nose so red That they call'd him \" Fiery Bob \" instead ! The captain, he held 'twas hardly right Of the cook's red nose to make so light ; Yet, whenever that bo'sun the cook did see, He'd shiver his timbers and shout with glee : \" Oh, he, he, he ! \" And the ship was saved by laughing. One day a leak in the hold was spied, \" All hands to the pumps ! \" the captain cried ; They pump'd away with main and might All through the day and through the night ; Till, hope and strength a-failing fast, \" No use ! \" the captain cried, at last, \" Let each man 'mong us for death prepare, And spend the last short hour in prayer ! \" But the bo'sun never a word pray'd he, But chuckled the while in unseemly glee : \" Oh, he, he, he ! \" And the ship was saved by laughing. Says the captain, \" There's certainly something amiss With a man who can laugh in an hour like this I Come, silence ! good fellow, and stay your jest, You surely of prayer have need as the rest 1 Hold ! silence, you madman I or make reply, And quick tell your captain the reason why I \" Then the bo'sun spake out as he glanced at the cook, While his quivering timbers with merriment shook : \"I was thinking o' Fiery Bob's nose, d'ye see : Oh, Cap'n ! won't it fizz when we gets in the sea ! Oh, he, he, he ! \" Aud the ship was saved by laughing. Well, although they were in such a sorrowful plight. The captain and crew they laugh'd outright ; Their drooping spirits again revived, The spell of rest new strength supplied ; And there in the cold grey morning light Again they pump'd with main and might ; When a passing vessel came in view And saved the ship and the goodly crew ! And I think you'll all agree with me That the song to sing when you're out at sea's \" Oh, he, he, he ! \" For the ship was saved by laughing."], [333, "311 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

Jack set sail at early morn, To cross the watery main, The ship was wreek'd, the crew was lost, He ne'er return'd again. The lass he loved was left to pine In solitude and pain, \" On earth,\" she said, \"his heart was mine, In heaven we'll meet again. Ah ! I'll be true, ever true, Eliza Cook. By kind permission of F.

The storm was long, but it found me true, So, mother, be proud of your boy in blue. Across the bay they dart away, Amid the tempest's roar : The waves are rolling mountains high, Their oars the billows grip, And skim beneath the starless sky, And if the breakers wreck our ship, And your boy goes down in the foam, Be sure that the last breath on his lip Is a prayer for those at home. But come, cheer up, methinks I heard A voice in the anchor chain, That whisper'd like a fairy bird : \" The bark will come back again.\" To seek the sinking ship ; Though danger darkens duty's path, They do the best they can, And man can do no nobler deed Than help his fellow-man. The women stand upon the land, And then, with bended knee, While lingering there they breat he a prayer For those upon the sea. The lads upon the ocean know A prayer ascends on land To One who holds the surging sea Within His sovereign hand. \" God bless thee, mother, adieu, adieu, But never weep for your boy in blue.\" A SAILOR AND HIS LASS. Frank Swift. By kind permission of Evans & Co., 33, Argyll Street, London. A sailor and his lass had met At eve to say farewell, The dawn of day steals o'er the bay, As those upon the shore See through the light that hides the night For he was off to sea at morn, Leaving his love for a spell. \" Cheer up, my lass,\" he whisper'd low, In accents fond and true, \" Though wandering o'er the world I go, I'll come back soon to you. The boat return once more ; Then while the sailors pull ashore, And all the saved are there, They sing as singers only sing When Heaven answers prayer. When danger darkens duty's path, Go forward if you can, For man can do no nobler deed For I'll be true, ever true, Always true to thee ; O'er the seas, in distant lands, I'll be true to thee.\" Than help his fellow-man."], [334, "312 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

I'M Longshoreman Billy o' Fortsmouth town, A fine old skipper I be ; And I worry the lubbers as they come down To spend a few hours at the sea. With glass to my eye, every ship I descry, From a F. and O. Boat to a whaler ; I yarn all the while in true nautical style, And all think that Billy's a sailor. But I ain't no sailor bold, And never was upon the sea ; If I chanced to fall therein, It's a fact I couldn't swim I And I quickly at the bottom should be. But we'll give three hearty cheers For the sailor roving free ; With a heave ho haulee, And a cheer for little FoUy, The Queen, and our ships at sea.

Three fishers went sailing away to the west, Away to the west ere the sun went down ; Each thought of his home and of those he loved best, And the children stood watching them out of the town. For men must work, and women must weep, And there's Uttle to earn, and many to keep, \u2014 Though the harbour bar be moaning. Three wives sat up in the light-house tower, And they trimm'd the lamps as the sun went down ; They look'd at the squaU, and they look'd at the shower, And the night-rack came roUing up, ragged and brown. But men must work, and women must weep, Though storms be sudden and waters deep, \u2014 And the harbour bar be moaning. Three corpses lay out on the shining sands, In the morning gleam, as the tide went down ; And the women are weeping and wringing their hands, For those who wiU never come back to the town. For men must work, and women must weep ; And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep, \u2014 And good-bye to the bar and its moaning. THE LAST OF THE BOYS. Henry George Murray.

But when at Cadiz town we stay'd, Jack fell in love with a Spanish maid, And only four were we ; And Ben, thrown over by Mary Ann, Married a little Italian, And so, my lads, it came to pass, They each got tack'd to a furrin lass, But that don't quite suit me ; I'll sarve 'em out as they gave me the slip, I'll take a mate aboard my ship, But an English girl for me, d'ye see, An English girl for me ; 111 take a mate aboard my ship, But an EngUsh girl for me.

I remember the night was stormy and wet, And dismally dash'd the dark wave, Whilst the wind and sleet cold and drearily beat On the mariner's new-dug grave. I remember 'twas down in a darksome glade, And near to a dreary cave, Where the wild winds wail round the wanderer pale, That I saw the mariner's grave. I remember how slowly the bearers trod, And how sad was the look they gave< As they rested their load near its last abode, And gazed on the mariner's grave. I remember a tear that slowly slid Down the cheek of a messmate brave ; It fell on the lid, and soon was hid, For closed was the mariner's grave. I remember no sound did the silence break, As the corse to the earth they gave, Save the wild bird's shriek, and the coffin's creak, As 'twas lower'd in the mariner's grave. Now o'er his cold grave the wild briars creep, And the wild flowers mournfully wave ; The willows weep and the moonbeams sleep On the mariner's silent grave. HURRAH! FOR THE JACKETS OF BLUE.

When first I took to the sea, my lads ; Steadily, steadily, yo heave ho ! As poor a chap as could be, my lads ; Steadily, yo heave ho ! No friendly faces waited near To send me off with a parting cheer ; But only Nellie stood on the pier, Weeping to see me go. An' as Fortsmouth light dropp'd out o' sight, Thinks I to myself in the deep'ning night, There's a sight o' sorrow, an' toil, an' care, Must fall to an Able Seaman's share. After two years or more, my lads ; Steadily, steadily, yo heave ho ! I came back home ashore, my lads ; Steadily, yo heave ho I The lasses welcomed me on the quay, As sweet an' lovin' as they could be ; For they quite forgot how they sneer'd at me A couple o' years ago. An' I see them smile in their bonniest style, An' thinks to myself, as I laugh the while, Sweethearts are easy enough to find When an Able Seaman's pockets are lined. Down in her cot by the sea, my lads ; Steadily, steadily, yo heave ho ! A lass was waiting for me, my lads ; SteadUy, yo heave ho ! One who was true when the luck was bad, Who gave me her heart an' all she had, An' faithfuUy loved her sailor lad Wherever his ship might go.

So loth we part from all we love, From all the links that bind us ; So turn our hearts, as on we rove, To those we've left behind us ! We think how great had been our bliss If Heaven had but assign'd us To live and die in scenes like this, With some we've left behind us ! As travellers oft look back at eve, When eastward darkly going, To gaze upon that light they leave Still faint behind them glowing, \u2014 So, when the close of pleasure's day To gloom hath near consign 'd us, We turn to catch one fading ray Of joy that's left behind us.

Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling, The darling of our crew ; No more he'll hear the tempest howling, For death has broach'd him to ; His form was of the manliest beauty, His heart was kind and soft ; Faithful, below, he did his duty, And now he's gone aloft. 'TwAS on a very stormy day, Far s'uthward of the Cape, When from a huge Nor'-wester We had just made our escape; Like an infant in the cradle, Each breeze was hush'd to sleep, And peacefully we sail'd upon The bosom of the deep. At length the helmsman gave a shout Of terror and of fear, As if he had just gazed upon Some sudden danger near. We look'd all round the ocean, Tom never from his word departed, His virtues were so rare, His friends were many and true-hearted. His Poll was kind and fair ; And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly \u2014 Ah ! many's the time and oft \u2014 But mirth is turn'd to melancholy, For Tom is gone aloft. And just upon our lee We saw The Flying Dutchman Come bounding through the sea. Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather, When He, who aU commands, Shall give, to call Use's crew together, The word to pipe all hands ; Thus death, who kings and tars dis- patches, In vain Tom's life has doff 'd, For, though his body's under hatches, His soul has gone aloft. \" Take in your flowing canvas, lads,\" Our watchful master cried, \" To us, and our ship's company Great peril doth betide \" ; The billows, cresting white with foam, All angry do appear ; The wind springs up a hurricane, Now Vanderdecken's near. He comes, The Flying Dutchman comes, Light o'er the lofty spray ; Preceded by the tempest dire, He makes for Table Bay ; With bird-like speed he's borne before The wild and howling blast, But ere he can cast anchor there BLOW HIGH, BLOW LOW. Dibdin. Blow high, blow low, let tempests tear The main-mast by the board, My heart, with thoughts of thee, my dear, And love weU stored, Shall brave all danger, scorn aU fear, The roaring wind, the raging sea, In hopes on shore to be once more Safe moor'd with thee. Aloft while mountains high we go, The whistling winds that scud along, And the surge roaring from below, Shall my signal be to think on thee, And this shall be my song : Blow high, blow low, etc. And on that night when all the crew The memory of their former lives, O'er flowing cans of flip, renew, And drink their \" sweethearts \" and The bay, alas 1 is past. He scuds along too rapidly To mark his eagle flight, And, lightning-like, the Dutchman's helm Full soon is out of sight ; The crews of ships far distant Now shudder at the breeze That bears dread Vanderdecken In fury o'er the seas. Then mourn for The Flying Dutchman, For terrible's his doom, The ocean round the stormy Cape, It is his living tomb ! There Vanderdecken beats about their \" wives \" ; I'll heave a sigh and think of thee, And as the ship rolls through the sea The burden of my song shall be, Blow high, blow low, etc. For ever, night and day, And tries in vain his oath to keep By entering the bay."], [339, "317 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

The famed Belle Poole straight ahead did lie, The Arethusa seem'd to fly, Not a sheet, or a tack, or a brace did she slack, Though the Frenchmen laugh'd and thought it stuff, But they knew not the handful of men, how tough, On board of the Arethusa. On deck five hundred men did dance, The stoutest they could find in France We with two hundred did advance On board of the Arethusa.

When the bloom was on the tender vine, A soldier left the silver Ehine, With his father's sword in eager hand, To fight for love and Fatherland. And as he kiss'd away his maiden's tears, In love's own language thus he soothed her fears : \u2014 \" Time is but fleeting, hearts truly beating Live in their love till time itself is gone. Love changeth never, love liveth ever, Love shaU abide while the silver Bhine flows on.\" Ere the bloom had left the glowing vine, One night a stranger reach'd the Bhine, From the distant fight he came to tell His comrade's long and last farewell. There he heard the maiden praying for her love, Loyal and true, her hope in Heaven above. Time is but fleeting, etc. Then like a flower she bow'dher head, And heard the message from the dead ; How he, the bravest of the brave, Had found both glory and a grave 1 One sigh alone bound life to heart, \" In life or death we ne'er can part ! \" An angel through the sunlit west Had borne the broken flower to rest.

A boy, he left his father's home The chance of war to try ; O'er regions yet untrod to roam \u2014 No friend or brother nigh. Yet still he march'd contented on ; Met danger, death, and pain: But now he halts \u2014 his toil is done, He'll never march again. William M. Hutchison. By kind permission of Marshalls, Limited, 70, Berners Street, London. A soldier stood in the village street, And bade bis love adieu, His gun and knapsack at his feet, His company in view. With tears she kiss'd him once again, Then turn'd away her head ; He could but, whisper in his pain, And this is what he said : The sweets of spring by beauty's hand Lie scatter'd o'er his bier ; His comrades, as they silent stand, D rop honest Ned a tear. And lovely Kate, poor Ned's delight, Chief mourner of the train, Cried, as she view'd the dreadful sight, \" He'll never march again.\" \" Oh, love, dear love, be true, This heart is only thine : When the war is o'er, We'll part no more At Ehren on the Bhine.\" \"KISS THE LITTLE ONES FOR ME.\" They march'd away down the village street, The banners floating gay : The children cheer'd for the trampling feet Far from home and loving faces, Sad the soldier keeps his post ; In the bright watch-fire he traces Forms of those who love him most. Winds, oh ! bear in accents tender, Far away across the sea, This, the message he would send her\u2014 \" Kiss the little ones for me.\" That went to war away I And one among them turn'd him round, To look but once again : And though his lips gave out no sound, His heart sigh'd this refrain : \" Oh, love, dear love,\" etc. On the battle-field the pale cold moon Is shedding her peaceful light, And is shining down on a soul that soon Will speed its eternal flight ; Amid the dying, the soldier lay, A comrade was close at hand, And he said, \" When I am far away, And you in our native land, Oh ! say to my love, ' Be true, Be only, only mine ! ' My life is o'er, Oh 1 ye zephyrs, softly bear it, Gently waft it o'er the sea. It will comfort her to hear it \u2014 \" Kiss the little ones for me.\" Heeds he not the coming morrow Brings the hot and vengeful foe ; He would trace no lines of sorrow In the embers' cheerful glow.

If perchance, the soldier ponders, Some stray shot should lay him low, Then from out the battle's thunders The tired soldier, bold and brave, Now rests his wearied feet ; And to the shelter of the grave He's made a safe retreat. To him the trumpet's piercing breath To arms shall call in vain ; Ned's quarter'd in the arms of death \u2014 He'll never march again. Let my dying accents go ! Whisper, winds, and say I've bless'd them ! Let my last fond message be, That in fancy I caress 'd them \u2014 Kiss the little ones for me.

Upon the hill he turn'd To take a last fond look It is not on the battle-field That I would wish to die ; It is not on a broken shield Of the valley and the village church, And the cottage by the brook ; He listen'd to the sounds, I'd breathe my latest sigh. And though a soldier knows not how To dread a soldier's doom, I ask no laurel for my brow, No trophy for my tomb. It is not that I scorn the wreath So familiar to his ear ; And the soldier lean'd upon his sword, And wiped away a tear. Beside the cottage porch A girl was on her knees, She held aloft a snowy scarf Which flutter'd in the breeze; She breathed a prayer for him, A prayer he could not hear, But he paused to bless her as she knelt, And wiped away a tear. A soldier proudly wears ; It is not that I fear the death A soldier proudly dares. When slaughter'd comrades round me lie, I'd be the last to yield ; But yet I would not wish to die Upon the battle-field. He turn'd and left the spot; \u2014 Oh ! do not deem him weak, When faint and bleeding in the fray, Oh ! still let me retain For dauntless was the soldier's heart, Though tears were on his cheek. Go, watch the foremost ranks Enough of life to crawl away To this sweet vale again. For, like the wounded, weary dove, That flutters to its nest, I fain would reach my own dear love, And die upon her breast.

When reposing that night on my pallet of straw, By the wolf -scaring faggot that guarded the slain, At the dead of the night a sweet vision I saw, And twice, ere the cock crew, I dreamt it again. Metbought, from the battle-field's dreadful array, Far, far I had roam'd on a desolate track, Till nature and sunshine disclosed the sweet way To the house of my father, who welcomed me back ; I flew to the pleasant fields, traversed so oft In Use's morning march, when my bosom was young ; I heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft, And knew the sweet strain that the corn reapers sung. Then pledged we the wine-cup, and fondly I swore From my home and my weeping friends never to part ; My little ones kiss'd me a thousand times o'er, And my wife sobb'd aloud, in her fulness of heart: \u2014 \" Stay, stay with us \u2014 rest I thou art weary and worn I \" And fain was the war-broken soldier to stay ; But sorrow return'd with the dawning of morn, And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away."], [348, "326 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

The wife of a soldier was starving with hunger, And close by her side was a poor little lad ; I've seen many children, but never one younger, Who seem'd so depress'd at the loss of his dad. \" Oh ! where is my father ? \" the boy kept on asking \u2014 \" I wish he would come, for I do feel so cold \" ; And then, in reply to the little one's tasking, Why, this was the tale that the poor mother told : \u2014 \" He'll be back by-and-bye, it is true I have told you, So cheer up, my darling, now don't sob and cry ; Your father, my lad, is a brave British soldier, Though torn from us now, he'll be back by-and-bye.\" \" Oh ! father, dear father, pray why did you leave us 1 And why from your boy to the war did you go 1 I've pray'd to the One up above to receive us,\" And, as he said this, the boy fell in the snow: The mother then clutch'd him more tightly and firmer Than ere she had done \u2014 how the poor soul did weep ; For, in the still night, you could hear her faint murmur, And these were the words as she hush'd him to sleep : \u2014 \" He'll be back,\" etc. The boy then awoke and \" Dear father \" was crying, The mother, poor soul, how she burst into tears ; She knew very well that her poor boy was dying. It had come now to this, 'twas the worst of her fears : \" Oh ! father, come quickly,\" his faint voice was calling, As he laid back his head in her arms, and he died. On that cold winter's night, as the snow fast was falling, I heard a faint sound as the poor mother cried : \u2014 \" He'll be back,\" etc. THE LAST MUSTER. Juba Kennerley.

We buried him darkly, at dead of night, The sod with our bayonets turning, By the struggUng moonbeam's misty light, And the lantern dimly burning. No useless coflin enclosed his breast, Nor in sheet nor in shroud we bound him ; But he lay like a warrior taking his rest, With his martial cloak around him. Few and short were the prayers we said, And we spoke not a word of sorrow ; But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead, And we bitterly thought of the morrow. We thought as we hoUow'd his narrow bed, And smooth'd down his lonely pillow. That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head, And we far away on the billow. Lightly they'U talk of the spirit that's gone, And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him ; But Uttle he'll reck, if they let him sleep on, In the grave where a Briton has laid him. But half of our heavy task was done, When the clock struck the hour for retiring ; And we heard the distant and random gun, That the foe was sullenly firing. Slowly and sadly we laid him down, From the field of his fame, fresh and gory ; We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone, But we left him alone in his glory. A WARRIOR BOLD. Edwin Thomas.

He owns the Uon's spirit and might, But the voice he has learnt to love Needs only be heard, and he'll turn to the word, As gentle as a dove.

Why do summer roses fade, If not to show how fleeting All things bright and fair are made, To bloom awhile, as half afraid To join our summer greeting? Or do they only bloom to tell How brief a season love may dwell ? Then while summer roses last, Oh ! let's be friends together; Summer-time will soon be past, When autumn leaves around us cast, Both flowers were cull'd \u2014 the tulip gay, Which once in brightness shone, Has wither'd ; now 'tis cast away, AU trace of it has gone ; The violet, which would scarce presume In life to lift its head, Is treasured for its sweet perfume, Although its leaves are dead.

It was on one summer's evening, In the merry month of June, I beheld a damsel sitting 'Mid flowers' sweet perfume. She had a novel reading Just as I was passing by, And as she turn'd another page, I saw the brightest eye. A bewitching smile was on her face, As charming as the posies ; I felt the smart of Cupid's dart \u2014 'Twas love among the roses. THE FOUR-LEAVED SHAM- Now I hate to tell, but then I must, Within her heart I placed my trust : She was sitting in the garden, Where the butterfly reposes, And how we met I'll ne'er forget\u2014 'Twas love among the roses.

I would not waste my magic might On diamond, pearl, or gold, For treasure tires the weary sense \u2014 Such triumph is but cold : Now I pass'd her home next evening, The clock had just struck eight, I saw my future happiness Standing by the garden gate. She smiled as I approach'd her, And I begg'd her to excuse ; May I view those pretty flowers ? She murmur'd, \" If you choose.\" I spoke about the violets, Then finally made proposes ; Through the garden we walk'd, of happi- ness talk'd \u2014 But I would play the enchanter's part In casting bliss around ; Oh 1 not a tear, nor aching heart, Should in the world be found. To worth I would give honour, I'd dry the mourner's tears, And to the pallid lip recall The smUe of happier years ; And hearts that had been long estranged, And friends that had grown cold, Should meet again, like parted streams, And mingle as of old.

Yonder, my father, Yonder, my mother Bringing their light, one by one, The glistening stars appear Upon the sky so clear ; My love \u2014 where, oh 1 where is he gone? G. Macfarren. Why should we sorrow That summer's dazzling ray So soon should pass away, Whilst we can borrow From Autumn's yellow light A scene more truly bright 1 Where'er the eye can wander, The garden and the field A richer prospect yield ; Earth seems to squander Her plenty in the sheaf, Her gold in eveiy leaf. See, dearest father, See, dearest mother, There is my true love, John; The moon is full and clear To bring him safely here ; Oh ! ne'er with such light she shone. Gay music sounding Invites us forth to roam PHILLIDA FLOUTS ME. And share the \" harvest-home,\" Where, all surrounding, A glad and grateful smile Bepays the ended toil. I love the spring's meek pansy, The summer's blushing rose, And winter's pearly snows ; But to my fancy, Of Nature's gems, the chief Is Autumn's golden leaf. Oh what a plague is love ! I cannot bear it ; She will inconstant prove, I greatly fear it ; It so torments my mind, That my heart failt-th ; She wavers with the wind, As a ship saileth ; Please her the best I may, She looks another way ; Alack and well-a-day ! Phillida flouts me. Life hath its changes, Its springtime, hope, and joy, Before we learn annoy ; Then swift it ranges Through summer heats and blights, Our passions and our slights ; And winter, unrelentful, At distance frowns severe ; But let us banish fear, Blest and contentful I often heard her say That she loved posies ; In the last month of May I gave her roses ; Cowslips and gilly-flowers, And the sweet lily, I got to deck the bowers Of my dear Philly ; She did them all disdain, And threw them back again ; Therefore, 'tis flat and plain, Phillida flouts me. To wither without grief, Like Autumn's golden leaf. SAW YOU, MY FATHER? Saw you, my father, Saw you, my mother, Saw ye my true love, John ? He said he would be here, But oh ! I greatly fear That he to another is gone. Mark well, my father, Which way soe'er I go, She still torments me ; And whatsoe'er I do, Nothing contents me : I fade and pine away With grief and sorrow ; I fall quite to decay, Like any shadow ; Since 'twill no better be, I'll bear it patiently ; Yet all the world may see Phillida flouts me. Mark weU, my mother, Shadows of night creep on ; My heart is dull and drear, For oh ! I greatly fear My love to another is gone."], [391, "371 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

Not a face with kindness greets me 'Mid the thousands that go past ; Then another thousand meets me, In happy days, when fate look'd kindly And Nancy smiled upon me, I felt so bless'd, I nurtured blindly The faith that hath undone me ; I vainly thought love's chain was fast When solemn vows were plighted ; Now daylight dawns, my dream is past : Would I were stiU benighted ! Strange and heedless as the last. Oh ! the solitude of cities Seems all solitudes above 1 Yet there's not a heart that pities Those who live not where they love. Thoughts of gain I cast behind me, Thoughts that lured me here to roam ; Yes, the coming spring shall find me Happy in my western home. Gaudy flowers may deck the meadow Where the thoughtless idlers rove ; Nestling in the forest's shadow Live the violets where they love. Her glance was bright whene'er I met her, But now she greets me coldly ; False girl ! I vow I wiU forget her, My mind 111 make up boldly. Alas ! our mind is not our own, Though sages grave may school it ; A maid to whom her power is known At pleasure stiU may rule it. A LEGEND OF THE AVON Q. Macfarren. I WANDER'D THROUGH THE GARDEN. Lady, wake, bright stars are gleaming Through the midnight gloom above ; All beneath lies dead or dreaming Save thy watchful fairy love : Oh ! most fair of earth's fair daughters, Wake thee, and let us roam O'er Avon's pure and tranquil waters To the glad fairies' home. I wander'd through the garden, And saw the flowers that grew, And all of them in turn, love, Beminded me of you. I gazed upon the lily, And thought of one more fair ; The rose recall'd thy cheek, dear, And roses blooming there. In my noiseless bark I'U row thee Close by yonder hallow'd shore ; Glowing visions I will show thee, Such as charm'd the bard of yore, Then to our sylvan grot retreating, Where mortal ne'er has been, A thousand lips shall give thee greeting, Bride of my heart and queen ! Thus he sung and thus he woo'd her Many a summer's night unblest ; Love at length, the sott intruder, Found a welcome in her breast ; The moon shone clear when gentle Mary, Woke from a charmed dream, And glided with her minstrel fairy Over the Avon's stream. Sad and silent dawn'd the morrow And when I saw the heart's-ease, A sigh I scarce suppress'd ; I could not find its likeness Within my aching breast, Alas ! in flowers of summer No comfort can I find ; They tell me you are lovely, But not that you are kind. I LIVE NOT WHERE I LOVE. Ah ! to me how dull and dreary Seems the gay and crowded town ! Ah ! these masses make me weary While I wander up and down 1 Nothing hoping, nothing seeking, Through the busy throng I rove, While a voice, within me speaking, Says, \" I live not where I love.\" To the friends she left alone ; Still they mourn with kindred sorrow Her for ever lost and gone ; And while each night as rolls the wave on Under the willows green, A milk-white swan floats down the Avon, Ariel's bridal queen 1"], [394, "374 THE THOUSAND BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD.

If poems containing great and noble truths beautifully expressed exist in the world, surely it is better that every thinking being should have the opportunity of reading them, and any one collecting them into a convenient form, or even spreading them abroad in any part of the world when so collected, is reaUy promoting the mental and moral progress and happiness of mankind. There is not one person in a thousand that ever read half the poems collected into this small book, and I have no hesitation in saying that if any thoughtful person reads this volume through, small as it is, he will be the happier for it. No thinking person can read these gems from those dozen grand and noble poets of humanity \u2014 Tennyson, Burns, Hood, Wordsworth, Mackay, Swain, Sims, Longfellow, Whittier, Lowell, Carleton, Felicia Hemans, and Eliza Cook, without being better, wiser, and happier for having done so. The pieces in this collection are not all that the severe critic would call good poetry. 1 have selected them for their soul-stirring ideas rather than for their mere poetic embelUshment. A grand idea which produces noble resolves, or a human recital which brings tears of sympathy into the eyes, although given in simple or even ungrammatical language, is of far greater value to man kind than volumes, or dozens of volumes, of exquisite obscurities or \" sublime nonsense.\" It is largely of these simple, touching poems, dear to the heart of humanity rather than to the head, that this book is composed. It is said by some, and I think rightly, that poetry acts upon human beings with a soothing effect like music. Fuller calls it \" music in words.\" Certainly the reading of beautiful poems has an intellectually pleasing and soothing effect upon troubled minds. This beneficial effect has been appreciated by millions in the past, and I believe that hundreds of millions in the future will more frequently take up their favourite book of poetry to read themselves, or say to some dear friend in the spirit, if not in the words, of one of the best poets of humanity, \u2014 \" Come, read to me some poem, Some simple and heartfelt lay, That shall soothe this restless feeling, And banish the thoughts of day. \" Come, read from the treasured volume The poem of thy choice, And lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice. \" And the night shall be fill'd with music, And the cares that infest the day Shall fold their_t\u00a3nts, like the Arabs, And as siilgjlj/sjjfel away.\""], [403, "383 THE LIBRARY OF THE FUTURE. TO BE COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF THE CREAM OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND KNOWLEDGE. Friendly Beader, \u2014 I propose to start a cheap, comprehensive, and concise library, to be caUed the \" Federation of the World Library.\" It is to consist of the hundred best books in the world, one book the best of its kind on each subject of human knowledge, such as astronomy, geology, geography, history, biography, poetry, botany, chemistry, electricity, architecture, mechanics, navigation, mathe matics, natural history, grammar, medicine, agriculture, cookery, religion, law, pohtics, fun, and so on, up to 100 volumes, which will comprise all the important branches of human knowledge and thought. Each of these books must be care fully prepared for the purpose, and can each be made to contain the best of human knowledge on the subject treated of. It is astonishing how easily and perfectly this can be done within a smaU compass. A moderate-sized song book will hold aU the best songs in the world ; a moderate-sized poetry book will hold all the best poems in the world ; a moderate-sized wisdom book will hold all the wisest sayings in the world ; a moderate-sized book, carefully prepared, of astronomy, geology, geography, chemistry, botany, or any of the sciences, will give a clear knowledge of the principles of each of those sciences. Such a library of 100 volumes of, say, 600 pages each can be produced to sell at \u00a310, thus bringing all the most important knowledge, and all the most beautiful thoughts, within the reach of every human being. Books are multiplying so fast now, that no man can know even the titles of them all, much less read their contents ; therefore, a desir able thing, and an absolute necessity of the future, will be to pick the grain out of so much chaff, and preserve it in condensed libraries for the ready instruction, elevation, and gratification of universal humanity. I have called it the \" Federa tion of the World Library,\" because I believe that the cream of human thought, collected into a convenient form, and brought within the reach of every one, will do much to spread the principles of right and truth and friendship \u2014 to make men think rightly, and consequently alike, and so bring about the federation of the human race. Mankind, as a whole, have infinitely greater regard for right and truth than they have for wrong and falsehood, and it is the high destiny of the Press to develop and nurture this good tendency in man by spreading and re spreading abroad those great principles of right and truth, until every one shall become a right thinker ; and no small part of the duty of the Press is to coUect the best knowledge and the best thoughts existing in the world, and bring them before every reading being in the form of convenient libraries, as above indicated. As one unit amongst the many, I am trying to do my share in carrying out this object ; I have Uttle leisure time, but I hope to be able to publish a few of these \"Best Books in the World.\" I have already published two\u2014 one entitled \" Cole's Funny Picture Book,\" of which I have sold 50,000 ; it is the best child's book in the world ; and the \"Fun Doctor,\" of which I have also sold 50,000, is the best fun book in the world. And I am just about to pubUsh three others\u2014 namely, \" The Thousand Best Songs in the World,\" \" The Thousand Best Poems in the World,\" and \" The Five Thousand Wisest Sayings in the World.\" Of course, I shall not make these selections with the completeness with which they will be done later, but I shall have the satisfaction of having done something towards initiating the greatest and most valuable necessity of the future \u2014 namely, A cheap and universal library fur all mankind.
