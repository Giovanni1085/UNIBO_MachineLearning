For if fighting continue, they say they did fear, That Men would be scarce, and Husbands be dear. So plainly the Speaker the Businesse unties, That presently all the Members did rise. They had hardly the leisure all things to lay ope, But some felt in their Bellies if they had not a Pope. Some strictly stood to them, and others did fear, Each carried about them a fierce Cavalier. This Businesse was handled by the close Com- mittee, That privately met at a Place in the City. So closely to voting the Members did fall, That the humble Sisters were overthrown all.

This Day a great Fart in the House they did hear, Which made all the Members make Buttons for fear; And One makes nine Speeches while the Businesse was hot, And spake through the Nose that he smelt out the Plot. He takes it to task, and the Articles drawes, As a breach of their own Fundamental-laws. Now Letters were read, which did fully relate A Victory against Newcastle of late ; That hundreds were slain, and hundreds did run, And all this was got ere the Battel begun. This they resolv'd to make the best on ; And next they resolv'd upon the Question, That Bonfires and Prayses, the Pulpit and Steeple, Must all be suborned to couzen the People.

Then Pym like a Pegasus trots up and down, And takes up an Angel to throw down a Crown. He stand like a Creature, and makes a long Speech, That came from his mouth, and part from his breech.

Sir Hugh Cholmley for being no longer a Traytor, Was accus'd of Treason in the highest Nature ; 'Cause he (as they bad him) his Souldiers did bring, To turn from Rebellion, and fight for the King. They voted him out, but, nor they nor their men Could vote him into the House agen. Sir Davids Remonstrance next to them was read, From the Cities Round-body, and Isaac's the head. 'Twas approv'd ; but one Cause produc'd a de- nyal, That all Traytors be brought to a Legal tryal. For 'tis against Reason to vote, or to do Against Traytors, when They are no other but so. Because about nothing so long they sit still, They hold it convenient Diurnalls to fill. And therefore they gave their Chronographer charge To stuff it with Orders and Letters at large. The King by's Prerogative, nor by the Law, Can speak nor print nothing his People to draw, Yet Pennyles Pamphletlers they do maintain, Whose only Religion is Stipendary gain.

They had rather the Land be destroy'd in a mi- nute, Than abide any thing that has Loyalty in it ; And yet their Rebellion so neatly they trim, They fight for the King, but they mean for King Pym. These all to fight for, and maintain are sent The Laws of England ; but New-England is meant. And though such disorders are broke in of late, They keep it the Anagram still of a State. For still they are plotting such riches to bring, To make Char-les a rich and glorious King. And by this Rebellion this good they will doe him, They forfeit all their Estates unto him.

And after much prating and fighting they say The Ropes serv'd for Traces to draw her away. Sure these were Sea-horses, or else by their lying They'le make them as famous for swimming as flying. The rest of the day they spent to bemoan Their Brother, the Roundhead that to Tyburn was gone. And could not but think it a barbarous thing, To hang him for killing a friend to the King. He was newly baptized, and held it was good To be washed, yet not in water, but blood. They ordered for his honour to cut off his ears, And make him a Martyr : but a Zealot appears,"], [205, "Part I.

Part I 320 Upon Cromwell's pulling out the Long Parliament. 1653. The Alligory. 1. AS Plutarch doth write, (a Man of known Credit) A Serpent there was had a Mutinous Tayle, Rebell'd 'gainst the Head, that so oft had fed it, And would not permit it to lead, or prevaile : Is't not fit that by turns we Leaders should be Quoth the Tayle ? follow me, as I've follow'd thee. 2. Now, the Body, being grown too strong for the Head, Quoth the Head, if it must be, then let it be so ; For quietnesse sake I yield to be lead, But fear that from hence some mischief will grow ; A thing so un-naturall never was read, As the Head to turn Tayle, and the Tayle to turn Head. 3- A Monster like this, but of stranger Conditions, Engender'd there was in the year thirty nine; Rebell'd 'gainst the Head, but with fawning Petitions, To have him his Pow'r and his Right to resign ; This Monster (the truth on't to speak) was begot By a Mongrell Parson, and that Hagg the Scot."], [337, "Part I. Rump Songs. 321 ! 4- So large and so mighty]this Tayle grew in length, That where e're it came, it swept all before it ; There was no resisting so pow'rfull a strength, The Head at the last was forc't to implore it : All our Castles and Towns this Tayle did subdue, A sad tale to tell, but believe me 'tis tme. 5- Above seven years Conflict this Head did endure, With that Monsterous Tayle, and the Spawn it begot : During which time no Man's life was secure, Our Goods and our Cattle all went to the Pot : At last came a Champion with an Iron flayle, And ended the strife 'twixt the Head, and the Tayle : 6. The Head being departed, the Body began To consult with the Tayle what was best to do ; St. George (quoth the Body) 'tis said was a Man, But what can this thing be is called St. O. Why he (quoth the Tayle) was one of our Rout, And 'tis wonderous strange he should turn Tayle about. 7- While thus they did argue in rusht our St. O. With Courage more keen then the Sword that he wore Quoth he, ye are vile things, not fit here to grow, Such Fiends ne're was known in this place heretofore The wealth and the fat of the Country doth feed you, And now I do guesse it is high time to bleed you. 2 I"], [338, "Part I. Rump Songs. 322 8. Some say that this Tayle wore the mark of a P, O, is a Letter in rank known before it ; How e're 't makes no matter, 'tis all one to me, Save this, that I'm sure the O had the more wit ; There's no Man so blind, but may easily see He hath added unto his small O, a tall P. 9- My Story now ended come viva St. George, That old true-blew Lad, and Hospitable-Saint, Bring a Butt of good Sack to fill up my Gorge, At this tale of Head and Tayle I almost faint ; Howe're let it pass, if you studdy upon't, I hope you will neither make Head or Tayle on't. The Advice. I. NE're trouble thy self at the Times nor their turnings, Afflictions run circular, and wheele about, Away with these Murmurings, and these Heartburnings, With the Juyce of the Grape wee'l quench the Fire out, Ne're chain, nor imprison thy Soul up in sorrow, What fails us to day, may befriend us to morrow, Wee'l scorn our Content from others to borrow."], [339, "Part I.

Though Fortune hath left us wee'le strive to regain her, And court her with Cupps till her Favourite come, Then with a Courage untam'd wee'le maintain her, And silence the noyse of the Enemies Dmm, Wee'le link her unto the Man most deserving, Shall keep her at work, as well as from starving. She shall not hereafter be at her own Carving. 3- I hold him a Novice in Humane affairs, Thinks whirlings in State a wonderous thing, To daub up old Ruines with dirty repairs, And instead of a Scepter to set up a Sling. Such Atomes of Greatnesse are but Fortune's laughter, She fattens them up 'till they're fitted for slaughter, Then leaves them at Tiburn to Tittar and Tauter. Sharers in the Government. A MEDLEY.

This takes off tall things, and sets up small things, This masters Money, though Money masters all things ; 'Tis not in season, to talk of Reason, Or call it Legal, when the Sword will have it Treason ; It conquers the Crown too, the Furres and the Gown too, This set up a Presbyter, and this pull'd him down too ; This subtil Deceiver, turn'd Bonnet to Beaver, Down drops a Bishop, and up starts a Weaver."], [350, "Rump Songs.
