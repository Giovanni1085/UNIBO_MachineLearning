Whatever else may be the fate of this feeble endeavour to serve so good a cause as that of the now languishing British Drama, I shall not be without reward if it contribute to strengthen that hope in its speedy revival which I believe to be daily acquiring a firmer consistence. Effort, moreover, though unsuccessful, is not wholly lost, inasmuch as even to witness it, provided the object be not unworthy, becomes a stimulant which may quicken the desire of success in minds where lie the powers to achieve it. That such are throbbing amongst us even now, I have quite sufficient confidence in ourselves and our future openly to maintain ; and when that slight but inexplicable change of taste, fashion, imitation, or whatever it may be, that begins with a shred but ends with the drag of a windlass, shall have passed over our social condition, I see no reason to doubt that days as bright and nights as cheering as ever yet have graced"], [8, "PREFACE. them, are still in store for the votaries and admirers of an art whose utility and instruction may be made all but commensurate with its entertainment and its power.

The sun went down last night as if 'twere loaded With blood, foretelling slaughter ; earth was dull, Strange moaning winds, and cold and clammy fogs, Hung sorrow on the soul, as 'twere a pall; 'Twas such a night as guilt would shudder at, And mirth be dumb. Mem. 'Twas such a night as never Should rise from Egypt's shrines and dearest homes, If only nature mourn' d as man should mourn ; You smile, 0 Thothmes ! but you cannot melt This stubborn fear; 'tis not unwarranted ; Behold a king, born, cradled, bred a king, His roote struck deep into our household loves, And his strong branches, tossing in the gales Of admiration, mark him all inured In fullest manhood and chief fire of life, To most imperious mieji and instant service, Such as in camps weighs at the very life The least infraction ; mark him safe return'd Full to abundance with his rich success, Dropping at ev'ry step, e'en at his wish, What all men covet most, power, honour, wealth, Coin for all cravings ; mark around him sown O'er the wide earth submission, as the seed Of slavery and disgrace ; oh ! we are lost, In such a field where blossoms liberty ! Perhaps 'tis in his heart, thence to shine forth To the utmost sea. You have condemn'd too soon. No, though the lion's chain be long enough Tho. Mem. To reach Numidia, he's a captive still. Tho.

First tell me, Memmo, What column is't whereon Sesostris stands, The mighty bulk whose shadow is too black For liberty and Memmo ? Whereon set ? Whence hewn its sandy stones or massy marble ? Love, lineal right, and harvested renown, Men suffer right, and bellow admiration, Stifling their hearts with envy. What are these ? I tell thee, Memmo, there are yet foundations, Broader and deeper, which no human might Or worth can compass to erect itself Fitly upon, but which may bear the load Of a sky-reaching tower, wherein may dwell Even such as you and I. Is it well, Thothmes, Even thus and now to turn my fears to jest ? This jest is more than man's. Listen, dear Memmo. I do not point to yonder secret adyt, Wherein a shapely stone, to the gross world Symbols the Inconceivable, to charge you That not one spirit which here my words evoke May fly in the common air ; for well thou knowest, The god we seek hath in each heart his temple, Whose plan and entrance we must skill to win ; But still, yon empty chamber is the frame We're set in best, and all too near approach Loses the air and haze of reverence. Therefore, whate'er my words (weak hints and shows), To thee make common, thou wilt deem it best To think on more than utter. I am bound For ever to thee \u2014 speak.

Yet, look up, 0 Memmo, For such is king-ship on a narrower base, (To change the poor word changes not the thought, Nor doth the thought change by intensity), So that a priest is even a nobler king When men revere him ; 'tis the central soul, Not the world-traffic of the citizen, Owes heaven allegiance, and to stand in the blaze That thence streams to the earth is, to man's weak And dazzled sense to he confounded, lost, And though a mote, beseem a part of glory.

I have drawn fire from every earthly passion, And from the altars of the immortal gods, To burn beneath it and consume my love, But I love on. You go not hence. I know And long have weighed our fate, long too have striven To turn it, but this hour I cease, and now Accept it though I perish, perish both, For world-wide are the wheels of destiny ; I have been scoffed and tlireatened, I can scoff And threaten too. Away, the world beside, All worlds are here ; I claim myself in thee ; My life is in thy veins, give me my own Ere I resume it. Che. Tho. Help, oh, help ? In vain, You cannot stir in these reverberate roofs ; One echo I should fear, you clasp the god ; Think you the god of Thothmes can be stone ? See afiasxavToo- yj/aui (strikes the statue of Osiris) one live drop That's seething in this brain is worth whole hills Slaves hew to monsters. Che. Tho. Madman ! Goddess thou ! Mad man will worship here. (Thothmes seizes Chelonis, who shrieks for help; a noise as of broken gates is heard without; Sesostris and soldiers, with many priests and others, enter tumultuously . Thothmes releases Chelonis, who falls into the arms of one of the priests.)"], [69, "SESOSTRIS. 65 Priest. A God ! a God ! Ses. Room ! room ! put back your columns, or one heart Will burst your temple roofs tho' even their shade Hath palsied many ; every stone I'll touch, And those that ring of any worldly passion I'll grind to powder : will your corners stand ? We'd spare the dotage of our father-gods, But shake the guardian's fierce rapacity That would devour their great estate of soul. I grow to them ; my veins are fire, my breath Hot as the desert's. Room ! I cannot breathe ; What may this mean ? [Phareth whispers Thothmes.] Tho. A greeting from the gods Across thy sepulchre. Ses. Who, who is this, In white robes like some goddess of the sea That in the moonlight listening sits to catch Their prayers who sail towards home ? I know her now. Back. She is sacred. I have said it ; I Love, love ! ye have it now \u2014 And who is he That dares encircle what Sesostris loves ? Life-trifler, quit thy hold ; thou wilt not, slave, Go drag him hither. Tho. Quick obey the king, Our godlike king. Che. Oh, no, no, see I quit His sheltering arms : I am prepared to go. See I am here to wander through the world. Ses. Wilt thou, my princess ? Che. Whither? whither? oh, Have mercy, Isis. (Chelonis stands irresolute until he who supported her throws off his robes and Onnophab comes forward ; she throws herself into his arms.) Thou hast slain us both ; But death is welcome here. Ses. This shalt thou have, Not Hell shall save him now."], [70, "66 SESOSTRIS.

( Coming forward. ) A God ! a God ! go cry it in the streets, Proclaim it on the housetops, let it ring From hill to vale. A God ! a righteous God ! In his own temple, never violate Until this hour, which had not pass'd away, Ere expiation came, hath his strong hand Writ on that brow where every eye was turned Almost with adoration, that this earth And kings as potent as this earth can make, Are dust upon his footstool ? cry aloud, Where there are souls to listen and to learn, That when the greatest man of all this earth Became a scorner, even upon a glance, He melted into dust. Peace to the dead, But let the living think of how he died. 1st Priest. Hark ! hark ! 'tis thunder ! 2nd Priest. But not of the air ; The nether powers upheave their giant strength, And wrestle with the rocky bones of the world. Another groan ! Ye Gods ! the solid ground Reels like a sea ; the air is burning black. 1st Priest. Look ! look ! the ponderous columns of the gate Plunge in the frighted sands. 2nd Priest. The God ! the God ! He stirs, he reels, \u2014 back, madman, death is on thee Close as thy shadow ; lo ! th' enormous mass Heaves to the fall. Great God ! too late, too late, I can but feel he comes, oh horror ! horror !
