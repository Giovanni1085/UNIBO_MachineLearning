HE High Commissioner had sailed for \"\"\u2022^ Tonga in H.M.S. Eapid. His official visits to the island kingdom had generally been so uneventful, that for the first three weeks of his absence from Suva the public interest in his movements had been languid ; but when the day appointed for his return had passed, and Saimone of the signal-station had swept the southern horizon in vain for a fortnight, \" the beach \" began to occupy itself with the usual pessimistic spec ulations. The Eapid had run short of coal \u2014 had broken down \u2014 was piled up on a new reef : King George was dead at last, and there was a row among the natives : Baker had been shot at again, and was hit this time. To the professional news-mongers of the beach only one A"], [22, "2 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. suggestion did not occur \u2014 namely, that the \" Honourable and Eeverend \" Shirley Waldemar Baker, First Minister of the king aud the State Church, had fallen from his high estate, and had been removed from the little kingdom where he had so long ruled the natives for their good and his own profit. The tongue of rumour was hushed at last. Suva awoke one morning to find the Eed Cross fluttering from the signal-staff, and her Majesty's ship, ironically christened the Eapid, creeping slowly along the reef. Almost before the yellow flag had been hauled clown the news flashed along the beach that Baker had indeed fallen, and could not again set foot in Tonga for two years on pain of imprisonment. A sketch of the events of the last few years cannot be avoided, but it shall be a sketch in outline only. When George Tubou became king in 1845 his people were in the white-heat of a conversion to Christianity. The missionaries had taught them to read and write, and to pass a simple code of law. They had imbued them with envy of the dignity of civilised States, \u2014 their law courts, their police, the uniforms and salaries of their officials, and their other blessings of civilisation \u2014 including taxes. All these the Tongans might have if they were shown how to begin. For years there was no one to direct their nascent aspirations. Their teachers had no enterprise, and devoted themselves to the spiritual rather than the temporal needs of their flock ; but at last with the neces sity came the man. Mr Baker was a genius in his way. None knew better than he how to work upon the feelin\u00abs of his congregation, or could better gauge the exact"], [23, "THE BOULANGER OF TONGA. 3 moment to send round the collection-plate. None could lay out the funds thus collected in church-building with better effect. None was so jealous of the honour and in dependence of Tonga, warning her when any of the great nations cast greedy eyes upon her emerald shores. He designed the national ensign, and the royal standard with three club-knives, such as the European officers strap to their sides, and a dove carrying a branch in its beak, and the Great Seal, and many other things that make a nation respected. These were foreigners' things and their mean ing was therefore not known to Tongans, but they were the emblems of civilisation. He it was who ordered the tim ber for the palace and the churches and all the public buildings, which cost a great deal of money. And lastly, it was he who persuaded a German Consul-General to come to Tonga in a man-of-war to make a treaty, so that Tonga was recognised of the Great Powers : for this honour only a small island was given to Germany as a coaling-station, and for his labours as interpreter between the plenipotentiaries Mr Baker received, as was right and proper, a decoration from the German Emperor. Then Unga, the premier and the king's son, died in Auckland, and Mr Baker, out of his love for the king, brought back the body to Tonga in a German man-of-war, and consented to fill the place that Unga had left empty. For charges had been made against Mr Baker \u2014 the great are always envied ! \u2014 and a committee of his peers in the Methodist Church had advised his removal to Australia. Thus Unga's death saved him from the pain of leaving the Tongans whom he loved. Now the king had a grievance against the Conference."], [24, "\u25a0i A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. Every year the mission collected for church purposes large sums that were not spent in Tonga, but were trans ferred to some other circuit more in need of money. He contended with reason that this money ought to be spent for the benefit of those who had contributed it. Mr Baker, as head of the mission, had been the most active in developing a doubtful method of collecting funds ; but as he, too, had a grievance against the Con ference who had profited by his ingenuity, and turned round upon him when the facts became too notorious to admit of denial, he threw in his lot with the king. After King George he was now the most powerful man in the kingdom, and his power could be greatly developed, pro vided that the missionaries left him alone. He had to choose between conciliating or fighting them, and he chose the latter alternative as more consonant with his tastes. If he failed, their opposition to him could not be more bitter than it was before ; whereas if he succeeded in driving them from Tonga, his government would be in dependent of all opposition, while his thirst to avenge his private wrongs would be gratified. It was a bold scheme, and it very nearly succeeded. King George had long been asking that Tonga should be constituted a separate Conference, having control over its own finances ; but unsuccessfully, because the Wes leyan authorities felt that an infant Church, whose mem bers were but yesterday practising heathen rites, and who were never remarkable for diffidence or stedfastness of purpose, were scarcely in a fit state to be freed from leading-strings. Mr Baker began to irritate this old sore. He suggested to the king that, if the Conference persisted"], [25, "THE STATE CHURCH. 5 in resisting his most reasonable demands, he ought to set up a Wesleyan Church of his own, a national Church, ruled by the same laws as those that governed other Methodist churches. He even persuaded his successor in the chairmanship of the district, a Mr Watkin, to betray his trust and secede with him. When all was ready, he telegraphed to the Australian Conference, then sitting, warning them to accept the king's terms, or suffer the consequences. He was probably aware, when he sent this telegram, that there was no time for the receipt of a favourable reply before the date he had fixed in his ultimatum, but he had, he considered, cleared his own character, and he now proceeded to make his eoup ditat. So the new Church was set up, and in a few weeks it had been embraced by a majority of the people and of the native ministers, who joined the new Church \" out of their love for Tubou \" and received higher salaries for their loyalty to their sovereign. The king's influence was enormous, but Mr Baker had slightly overrated it; for, in spite of all persuasions and threats, a very re spectable minority were left who flatly refused to turn, not probably for conscientious motives, \u2014 for the tenets of the two Churches were exactly the same, \u2014 but because they disliked Mr Baker and were attached to the Wes leyan missionary, and also because their natural ob stinacy and dislike of being \"hustled\" came to their support. He had now to face the Wesleyans, armed with very good grounds for complaint, and, to save him self from losing ground, he had recourse to persecution, petty at first, but descending later to rather gross out-"], [26, "6 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. rages. Unfortunately for the Wesleyan cause, these outrages were much exaggerated by well-meaning but inaccurate friends, so that people grew sceptical as to the truth of any of them. Being now in the zenith of his power, in the enviable position of a ruler who is his own treasurer and auditor and also controls the law courts, he became, as men of his stamp always do become, a petty tyrant, without the tact or temper to control the disaffection he created. A dan gerous feeling against him began to develop itself among the chiefs, and instead of conciliating them, as a shrewder man would have done, he trusted everything to his ascendancy over the king, and treated chiefs and com moners alike as his inferiors in virtue of his office. In 1886 four prisoners, undergoing imprisonment for petty offences, escaped from jail, and hid for months among the caves at the back of the island, living upon such food as the sympathy of the people procured for them under cover of night. On the night of January 5, 1887, they lay in wait for Mr Baker as he drove home in the dusk with his son and daughter. They fired, but the shot missed its mark, breaking the boy's arm as he ran to stop them, and wounding the girl as she tried to screen her father. The horse, not less terrified than its driver, bolted, leaving the two wounded children on the ground, nor could it be stopped until it had carried its master to a place of safety. It was a savage crime, but the revenue taken for it was scarcely behind it in savagery. There were wholesale arrests : there was a trial in the presence of the native Chief Justice, a native jury, and Mr Baker \u25a0 but as the public was not admitted to the court, and the"], [27, "AN EYE FOR A TOOTH. 7 few Europeans present were ignorant of Tongan, we have only native accounts of the proceedings to rely upon. Several men were condemned to death, including the actual perpetrators of the crime, and four, one of whom was more than probably innocent, were taken to Malinoa island and summarily shot. Others would have followed had not the Europeans interfered and threatened Mi- Baker personally, and during the delay thus secured H. M.S. Diamond arrived with the High Commissioner, Sir Charles Mitchell, from Fiji. Mr Baker had affected from the first to regard the attack upon him as_ a .conspiracy of the Wesleyans, and sought to connect the missionary, and even the English Vice-Consul, with the crime. It was an opportunity for wiping out the remnant of the Wesleyan Church. On the pretence that there was an insurrection against the king's authority in Tongatabu, he summoned the men of Haapai and Vavau to come and restore order. They came with all the savage ruffianism in them aroused by the remem brance that Tongatabu was their ancient enemy. Armed, and with blackened faces, they spread over the country, plundering the houses of the Wesleyans, flogging and in sulting all who refused to join the Free Church. The remnant of those who still held out, some two hundred souls, were huddled on board two small schooners, and shipped off to Fiji. They were thus thrust destitute upon the Government of that colony, which was put to no small inconvenience and expense in providing for them. Eventually they were settled on the fertile island of Koro, dissatisfied, and in continual disagreement with their Fijian neighbours. It was their sudden arrival that"], [28, "8 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. caused the High Commissioner to visit Tonga. The ex haustive judicial inquiry which he held furnished ample grounds for the removal of Mr Baker under the Order in Council which empowers the High Commissioner to remove any British subject who, in his opinion, is dangerous to the peace and good order of the island in which he is living. But since Mr Baker, in fact, constituted in himself the Tongan Government, it was not clear that his removal would not be followed by anarchy ; and as the king under took to put a stop to the persecution of the Wesleyans, and to adopt certain other reforms, Sir Charles Mitchell preferred allowing them to be effected through Mr Baker's agency to incurring the risk of the chaos that might result from his removal. The ship of war therefore sailed for Fiji, taking with her the rest of the prisoners lying under sentence of death. Now Mr Baker had expected to be removed, and he attributed this leniency to a different motive. He argued, doubtless, that if the High Commissioner had failed to remove him after the wholesale persecution of the Wes leyans and other illegalities, it was because he was afraid to do so, and that he was not likely to take extreme action against him for any lesser cause. So long, therefore, as he restrained himself within certain limits, he might con tinue his former policy without let or hindrance. The king, who had so often been his scapegoat, could be made to bear the sole blame of breaking the promises made to Sir Charles Mitchell. So the promises were not fulfilled, and things went on very much as before, except that the annoyances to which the Wesleyans were subjected were a little less flagrant. Not content with having escaped"], [29, "STATECRAFT. 9 retribution, he wanted to celebrate his triumph to the world. He was living in the king's palace, and to some extent at the king's expense. His crippled children were drawing pensions from the Treasury. It was time to settle with his enemies \u2014 such, at least, as had not been shot or exiled to Fiji. He called a shorthand writer, and dictated in Tongan a report of the attack on him, which he persisted in calling \" the assassination,\" writing with gross disrespect of the High Commissioner, and accusing the British Vice-Consul, since deceased, of having fur nished the musket with which the crime was committed. This document was thereupon taken to the native Chief of Police to be signed as his report to the king, for by this means did Mr Baker innocently suppose that he would protect himself from the penalties for the libels of which he was the author. It was then translated, and published as a Blue-book headed \" Private and Con fidential,\" probably with the view of protecting the Auck land printers. But this time he had gone too far. The High Commis sioner at once called upon him to retract the libels or take the consequences, and he apologised in the most abject manner ; but, when it came to publishing a refutation of the libel, difficulties arose. The Chief of Police flatly refused to sign it, and when at last he was induced to present it to the king, his Majesty threw it on the ground, declaring that he had been made a fool of. But it was printed all the same, \" By his Majesty's command.\" The Tongans were beginning to have quite enough of Mr Baker, who lived most of his time in Auckland devis ing obnoxious laws, travelling backwards and forwards at"], [30, "10 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. their expense, and only coming among them accompanied by a retainer armed with a revolver. In 1889 they simply neglected to pay their taxes, and the Premier was in con sequence unable to pay the salaries of his numerous officials. Now when a Government, however small, fails to pay its own servants, its time is near. The power to distrain for taxes was useless, for as soon as the sheriff's officer was abroad the defaulter made temporary loans of his property to his relations. The alternative was to sell the defaulter's labour to the highest bidder, but a Govern ment cannot put the whole of its subjects up to auction. So the Premier wisely went to Auckland, and, to tide over his more pressing necessities, floated a loan on the security of copra to be hereafter levied. But the High Commissioner had not done with him. The king's promises to Sir Charles Mitchell had not been fulfilled : the Wesleyan exiles were still a burden upon the Government of Fiji. It was useless for Mr Baker to shelter himself behind the king, because a Minister whose advice is not taken ought logically to resign. Mr Baker had, however, no intention of resigning, and could not afford to let the High Commissioner see the king in his absence. In May 1890, therefore, he went from Auckland to Tonga to await the expected visit, writing to some friends that he would return as soon as he had disposed of the \" champion of the Wesleyans,\" as he playfully termed Sir John Thurston. H.M.S. Eapid anchored at Nukualofa on the 25th June 1890, and on the 27th Sir John and his suite paid an official visit to King George at his house, the greater part of which was occupied by Mr Baker and his family. He"], [31, "A SHUFFLE FOR DEAL. 11 found the king supported on the one side by his Prime Minister, and on the other by Mr Watkin, the missionary who had deserted his employers to become the head of the Free Church of Tonga. After the usual interchange of courtesies the High Commissioner asked the king to ap point some of his chiefs to represent him in a Conference on matters of State, and especially on the subject of the promises made to his predecessor two years before. After a long and painful hesitation, King George said that he would like the proposal to be put in writing, and that he would see him again in a few days. In taking his leave Sir John desired Mr Baker to visit him on board the Eapid that afternoon. This interview must have been a painful one for Mr Baker, whose system of diplomacy, being founded upon habitual concealment of the truth, was quite unsuited for an encounter with one who knew as much about the secret history of Tonga as he did him self. To the question whether he intended to support Sir John's proposal for the appointment of a council of native chiefs, he would at first give no definite reply, hinting that if he were a party to the return of the exiles from Fiji he would be himself giving an opportunity for another attempt upon his life ; but when further pressed, he affected to pity the High Commissioner's ignorance of native matters in thinking that he could go to the king and virtually tell him that he was thought too old or too foolish to manage his own affairs. He at any rate would refuse to attend any such meeting. Sir John assured him that he was free to attend or not as he pleased, but that as it was clear that he meant to prevent any Conference taking place, he would not be accepted as an intermediary"], [32, "12 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. between the High Commissioner and the king or any of the native chiefs. Then Mr Baker tried to retrieve his lost ground, and asked what he had done to forfeit the confidence of the High Commissioner, receiving his answer in the form of a catalogue of his more notorious breaches of faith. War was declared, and Mr Baker's only resource was to cut off stragglers and impede the baggage-train of the enemy. He would not, he said, interfere in any way, but he ought to mention that the king was much annoved at the employment of Mr Moss as interpreter, and had instructed him to write a complaint to the Vice-Consul. It subsequently appeared that the ingenuous Premier had invented this difficulty in order to hamper the High Commissioner in the choice of an interpreter ; for besides Mr Moss, there was no one well versed in the Tongan language who was not either a creature of the Premier or a persona iiigrata to the king. After waiting some days for the letter of complaint, Sir John sent an apology to the king by the hands of the Vice-Consul and Mr Moss himself. They found him sitting on the verandah of his house in the best possible humour. He denied ever having complained about Mr Moss, for whom, he said, he had the most friendly regard, emphasising this by pinch ing him and laughing heartily. Indeed from a native point of view King George would regard Moss as his grandson, for he had adopted his father under the name of Tubou Haapai. The same afternoon the High Commissioner with his staff waited on the king by appointment. To their great surprise they found him looking very ill and abstracted,"], [33, "A LOSING HAND. 13 attended only by two chiefs of the third rank, and by Mr Watkin as interpreter. Sir John did his best to explain the object of the visit, but it was quite evident that the king could not follow what was said. He seemed to hear the last sentence \u2014 that the High Commissioner came as a true friend to Tonga \u2014 and said after a long silence that every good thing came from Britain, adding several times, \" Thank you ! Thank you ! \" He was again asked whether he would appoint a council of chiefs, but he remained silent, and was so evidently suffering from illness that Sir John Thurston rose, telling Mr Watkin that he could not think of troubling the king in his present state of health. Mr Watkin replied that the king was suffering from la grippe, and the party retired, convinced that, though his Majesty was certainly unwell, his complaint was not la grippe. The king's relations were very angry at the ill-success of this interview, and indulged in the most threatening language towards the Premier. The High Commissioner had now to consider whether, in view of the continual acts of oppression committed with Mr Baker's sanction and authority, and the dangerous irritation of the natives against him, his presence in Tonga would not almost cer tainly lead to the murder of himself and others after the ship of war had left the group. His life had already once been attempted before the higher chiefs had de clared their hostility towards him. He decided \u2014 and after-events have proved the wisdom of his decision \u25a0 \u2014 that the case demanded the exercise of his authority under the Western Pacific Order in Council in prohibit ing Mr Baker from remaining in Tonga after the 17th of"], [34, "14 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. the month, when the mail-steamer would leave for New Zealand. On the following morning Mr Collet, the Secretary to the High Commissioner, and Mr Leefe, the Vice-Consul, called on Mr Baker at Mr Watkin's house, and handed to him the written intimation. He was doubtless congrat ulating himself at the moment on the success of his diplo macy, feeling secure that if Sir Charles Mitchell could not deport him in 1887 for fear of anarchy, none of his suc cessors in office would dare to take such a step in the present embarrassed and disturbed state of the country. The letter came upon him like a thunder-clap : he turned very red, and asked if a reply was expected. \" None,\" was the answer, \" but we are to say that the High Com missioner will be glad to afford you protection from per sonal violence on board H.M.S. Eapid.\" \" Oh, that's all bunkum,\" replied the fallen Minister, heatedly. He then went off to see the king, but there he found the redoubtable Tungi, Lord of Hahake, and Speaker of the House of Assembly. The torrent of Tungi's vitup eration, aided by an excellent memory for Mr Baker's delinquencies during the past thirteen years, was too much for him. It was an inauspicious moment in which to approach the king, seeing that his most influential enemy had the royal ear. During the evening a message was delivered from the chiefs that they wished Mr Baker to leave the king's house, as they feared he would do him some mischief. The High Commissioner tried to reassure them, but, two hours later, they returned with a sworn statement that they feared he would do the king some serious harm."], [35, "A FALLING STAR. 15 It is probable that their real fear was that he would use the night to regain some of his lost influence, and that the progress of events would be arrested by some unfore seen action on the part of the king ; but, as it was quite possible that, in the present temper of the people, Mi- Baker might be roughly handled, the captain of the Eapid was asked to land a few marines and station them for the night at the palace already vacated by Mr Baker. Ac cordingly seven marines were landed unarmed under the command of a lieutenant. The verandah was occupied by a number of chiefs, and the night passed quietly. Mr Baker had unfortunately time to remove several packages of papers from the palace, and he and his children were seen late in the night burning papers, perhaps those for which a diligent and unsuccessful search was made by his successors. At daybreak he made an attempt to enter the Palace, but went away when refused admission by the marines. He was met at the gate by Taufaahau, the king's great-grandson and heir, who, with the title of \" Crown Prince of Tonga,\" had been sent to school in Auckland under Mr Baker's supervision. Infuriated at the ingratitude of his old protigi, he cried out, \" You shall pay me for your keep in my house in Auckland.\" \" And you,\" shouted the boy, \" shall pay for living for years in my grandfather's house I \" A few weeks later Taufaahau received the bill for his entertainment in Auckland ; but I have reason to fear that the debt is still owing, although he has long ago come into his kingdom and the command of his privy purse. A little later his Majesty himself came forth for his morning bath in the sea. One of the marines, having"], [36, "16 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. orders to allow no one to pass, and seeing nothing in an elderly native gentleman to betoken royalty, interfered. King George, much amused, attempted to explain the situation in the vernacular, but the marine was obdurate. The poor kiug had to go without his bath, but his admira tion for the sentry outweighed any annoyance on that score. \"No wonder,\" he said, \"that Britain is so powerful: these soldiers obey their officers and no one else. Ah ! if the Tongans were like that.\" This day being Sunday, the High Commissioner at tended church with the king, and after service accom panied him home by invitation. He had made a wonder ful recovery from la grippe, and was in the same high health and spirits as he had been forty-eight hours before when visited by the Vice-Consul without notice, and as he had not been when seen by the High Commissioner by appointment. He spoke for some time with great animation, repeatedly expressing his thankfulness for the action taken by his chiefs and his release from Mr Baker. He also cordially accepted an invitation to visit the Eapid, which he had previously declined on the advice of Mr Baker. The marines were now withdrawn, and on the following day the Premier was formally dismissed from office by the king. The vacancies thus qreated were rather numerous, for Mr Baker was Premier, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Presi dent of the Court of Appeal, Auditor-General, Minister of Lands, Judge of the Land Court, Minister of Education, Agent-General, and Medical Attendant to the kino- His Majesty at first wanted to appoint Josateki Tonga to the post of Premier, because, though a chief of inferior"], [37, "17 A SECRET OF STATE. rank, he had so long acted for Mr Baker in his absence that the king had a great belief in his knowledge of affairs. Sateki (as he is commonly called) declined, say ing that he was more fit to follow than to lead. Tungi was then proposed, but he excused himself on the ground of age and infirmity. The choice, therefore, fell on his son, George Tukuaho, the ablest young chief in Tonga. Tungi became Minister of Lands, and Asibeli Kubu, a young chief of Vavau of high rank on his mother's side, took the portfolio of Minister of Police, an important office including the control of Crown prosecutions and prisons. The other offices remained unchanged. The new Min isters at once took charge of their respective departments. The Premier's office was found to be in a state of the greatest confusion, and Mr Smart, one of the Customs clerks, was employed in endeavouring to set the papers in order, when Mr Baker appeared on the scene, anxious to remove some of his account-books. He was stopped by a native sentry, and for the moment he forgot that the reins of office had fallen from his hands \u2014 indeed at this time his dismissal from office, though already signed, had not yet been handed to him. His temper gave way. \" By whose orders was he prevented from entering his office ? \" \" By the king's.\" \"But I insist on removing my private property from the office.\" Consent was given provided that nothing was removed without the permission of a Government officer. They passed through the outer office to Mr Baker's elegantly furnished sanctum. Behind this was a \" holy of holies \" into which no Tongan had ever been known to penetrate. i;"], [38, "18 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. There had always been a mystery about this inner room with barred windows. All that was known of it was that Mr Baker frequently retired thither during office hours, and returned to his work with renewed vigour and in spiration ; and that large and heavy cases, marked \" T. G.,\" were periodically landed by the steamer to be carried into this inner chamber. When they reached the door they found that Mr Smart had succeeded in opening it, and that the secret lay disclosed. Straw pyramids littered the floor : there were empty cases and cases yet unemptied ; and a terrible array of \" dead marines,\" square-shouldered, round-shouldered, and sloping-shouldered, shocked the eye as they lay in unblushing and uncompromising evidence in every corner. The ex-Premier blushed deeply. \" This is all my private property,\" he said, angrily. But Mr Smart had been examining the cases. \" I think not,\" he said, with conviction ; \" the cases are marked ' T. G.,' which stands for Tongan Government.\" \" But I paid for them,\" retorted Mr Baker, \" In that case,\" said Smart, \" they must have evaded Customs duty, \u2014 private goods imported as Government property ! \" Mr Baker was speechless with indignation. \" I'll make you pay for this some day,\" he said, and turned away to claim other property. If views differ regarding Mr Baker's abilities as an administrator, no one who has since visited that inner room has thought of denying his genius as a judge of champagne. More than once have I heard a Cabinet Minister, the bitterest of his enemies, say with real conviction after repairing the tedium of a weary debate in the House, \" Misa Beika was a wise man ! \""], [39, "19 THE CASE FOR THE EXILES. He now wanted to remove his account-books, which were, he said, his private property ; but the writing was the writing of Otto Lahnstein, who was paid with Govern ment money, and the books had been paid for from the same funds. So he took his last view of the scene of his labours, and withdrew protesting. His son, who had been his Private Secretary, gazed with pride at the havoc of the clerk's office, and remarked to Smart, \" Well, at any rate you fellows can't say that we haven't done a lot of work here.\" A day or two later the king visited the Eapid in his State barge, and the High Commissioner paid an informal visit to him the same afternoon. He found him attended by thirty or forty chiefs in the ordinary native dress, a sure sign that they felt at ease. After a warm greeting the conversation turned upon Tongan affairs. Sir John expressed a hope that all petty oppression and persecution would now cease, and that the people would be allowed to return to their normal state of quietude. The king replied that he felt sure that a time of peace had arrived. The opportunity for testing the sincerity of his promises had come, and the High Commissioner decided to ask him to do that which Mr Baker had persisted in declaring he would never do \u2014 namely, to allow those exiled to Fiji for their religious views to return. He referred to the chiefs present who had relations among them \u2014 to Fatafehi, Governor of Haapai, whose mother, Charlotte, the king's daughter, was among the exiles, though past sixty years of age. The king was visibly affected, and said, \" I never sent them away : I did not want them to go. Let them come back. They were driven away. Bring them back"], [40, "20 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. to their friends.\" After a short silence the High Com missioner said, \" Will you also release the people at Tofua and other places who have been deprived of their liberty for years past, in some cases for no other reason than that they attended prayers at the house of a AVesleyan mis sionary ; others who have been unjustly convicted by illegal sentences being passed upon them ; and others who are in confinement upon the personal order of Mr Baker, after being duly discharged by a judge of the Tongan Supreme Court ? \" The king answered, \" Why go on ? This is a day of joy. I do not want them to be imprisoned. Let us rejoice at what has happened, and let all prisoners be set free.\" The High Commissioner explained that he had not asked for the release of prisoners properly convicted of offences against the law, and that the wholesale liberation of such people might be inconvenient ; but, nevertheless, every convict who had more than twelve months of his sentence to serve was turned loose upon society. The king then invited his guests to drink kava in another part of the house, and seated the High Commis sioner near himself. He asked more than once whether there was anything more that he wished done, and begged him to help his Government to keep clear of the disturb ances and embarrassments into which they had been led by Mr Baker. Then one of the chiefs seated near the bowl cried out, \" We, too, have something to ask. We want to break up this kava-party, that we may go out into the roads and cry the good news to all the people.\" There was a shout of applause, and the High Commissioner shook hands with the king and took leave. Except the"], [41, "THE APOTHEOSIS. 21 children, scarcely any one in Nukualofa went to sleep that night. The Europeans living in Tonga were apparently not above kicking their enemy when he was down, for the High Commissioner received information that they were preparing to make Mr Baker run the gauntlet of a shower of rotten eggs as he went along the wharf to embark. There was also a growing disposition among the natives to make an attack on him before he left the country. The native Government undertook to restrain its subjects ; and to control Mr Baker's compatriots, Sir John made it known through the Vice-Consul that the order of prohibition would not be served upon him till he embarked, and that if any European attempted to insult him it would probably not be served at all. One of these gentry told me after wards how disappointed he was. He said that the High Commissioner seemed first to take one side and then the other. \" If Baker was a rascal, what did he want to take his side for ? \" The mail-steamer Wainui anchored on July 17, and Mr Baker embarked before any one in Nukualofa was stirring. At ten o'clock the order of prohibition was served on him, and at half-past two he left the islands for New Zealand. At ten o'clock the High Commissioner and his staff landed at the king's invitation to receive the thanks of the people for his exertions on their behalf. They were conducted to seats on the lawn that separates the public offices from the sea. The native band of the king's Guards played \" Eule Britannia \" when they arrived, and continued to play while thousands of natives of both sexes filed past, laying their offerings before their visitors. The procession"], [42, "22 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION. seemed interminable, and the pile of gifts \u2014 mats, fans, combs, ngatu, and yams \u2014 grew to unmanageable dimensions, while the visitors' arms ached with the exercise of shaking hands. The barge had to be sent to bring off the presents; and one of the blue-jackets, with his mouth full of fresh pork and yam, was heard to sum up the situation in the evening, \" Tell yer what, Jack, I wish we'd a Baker to Re port every day.\" The High Commissioner, anticipating the storm that would arise among Mr Baker's friends \u2014 that is, among those to whom he gave the custom of the Tongan Govern ment \u2014 sent by the mail-steamer a full account of his action, to be telegraphed from Auckland to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Now that Mr Baker was gone, he had to consider what means could be adopted to fill his place. For the last few years the plan of Government had been becoming more and more complicated, and it was out of the question for any native to take up the reins of power without very considerable modification. All public records had been kept (when they had been kept at all) in the English language, with which no Tongan is acquainted. The code of law was most cumbrous and ambiguous ; a considerable portion of it had been published in the ' Gazette ' in English, and had never been translated for the benefit of the people who were to obey it. It had been Mr Baker's policy to complicate the administrative machinery, so as to imbue his colleagues with conviction that the simplest matter was beyond their power without his help ; and he thus gradually acquired control, not only of the law courts, but also of the Treasury. There was, it is true, a Minister of Finance, Junia Mafileo, the king's"], [43, "THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER. 23 nephew. He certainly looked the part of Treasurer of an insolvent kingdom. His brow was deeply seamed with the furrows of care, and he spoke little, as befits one \"/ ani Alinister of Finance, upon whose wealth of resource the financial fate of a country hangs. But when the High Commissioner ques tioned liim, the following conversation took place : \u2014"], [44, "24 A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION \" What is your office ? \" \" I am Minister of Finance. \" What is the revenue of Tonga ? \" I don't know.\" \" But what is your office ? \" \" Minister of Finance \" (warmly). \" Well, who knows what is the revenue of Tonga ? \" \" Misa Beika.\" Who takes care of the money ? \" I do.\" How much have you got in the Treasury ? \" I don't know.\" But you are Minister of Finance ? Yes ; I have told you that I am.\" Well, where's the money ? \" In the safe.\" ' Who knows how much there is ? \" '\u25a0' Misa Beika.\" ' Yes ; but he's gone. Can't you go and count it ? \" ' No ; I haven't got the key.\" \" Why, who keeps the key of the Treasury ? \" \" Misa Beika.\" It was clear that before the country could emerge from its difficulties some fuller information was required. Junia must have an assistant. On the High Commissioner's advice Mr Campbell, the Collector of Customs, was ap pointed Assistant to the Minister of Finance, and a better selection could not have been made. The liabilities were believed to be very large, and the balance in the Treasury, on being counted, proved to be less than \u00a32000. The ex-Premier was believed to have"], [45, "\"THE KINGFISHER HAS FALLEN.\" 25 made a number of yet unfulfilled contracts, for which his successors would be liable ; and the new Cabinet, com petent though they were to conduct kava-bowl diplomacy, were filled with an unconcealed awe of the mysteries of office-work. \" Was the High Commissioner,\" they asked, \" going to leave them to themselves before their path was clear ? \" They were not afraid of Tongans, \" but what about the white men ? Could he send no one to help them for a time ? \" Sir John Thurston was prepared for the request. It was clear that they must have help without involving the Imperial Government in any direct respon sibilities on their account. He told them that if the king made a formal request to him he would send them an officer not altogether unknown to them ; but that if he came they must follow his advice, and he must have a seat in the Privy Council. There being nothing more to do, the Eapid sailed for the northern groups of Haapai and Vavau, touching at each place, and telling the people the good news of the \" Jikota's \" 1 fall, and of the return of the exiles. In Vavau they received it with mixed feelings, for, while they hated Mr Baker, they could not forget that the exiles were Wesleyans, and Vavau is staunch Free Church. 1 Mr Baker had a number of nicknames \u2014 such as Kingfisher (Jikota), Empty Bottle, &c. The jikota of Tonga is an irrepressibly active and pugnacious bird, and Jlr Baker seemed to be proud of the comparison. Of some of his other sobriquets he had less reason to be proud."], [46, "26 II. HOW I TOOK OFFICE. I heard the High Commissioner's announcement with rather mixed feelings. To be at the age of twenty-nine elder brother to a monarch of over ninety does not fall to the lot of many, and new adventures are always worth undertaking ; but, on the other hand, I had already been to Tonga, and I knew enough of the place and the people to realise that, after the enthusiasm and excitement of Mi- Baker's ejectment, would come a strong reaction. By this time no doubt every Tongan had made up his mind that the millennium had arrived, in which there would be no more taxes nor Government, and every man would be a law unto himself. Any Government that tried to undeceive them on this point would be unpopular, and any white man who was associated with such a Government would bear the whole brunt of the popular distrust, already aroused by the revelations of Mr Baker's delinquencies imperfectly understood. With a people who would pay no taxes, how were the liabilities to be paid off ? Besides, I was to go there without any authority at my back but that which the king might choose to give me, and if I"], [47, "27 MY INSTRUCTIONS. failed, I alone must take the blame. The blame of failing in such a service would probably dog me for the rest of my official career. On the other hand, I might have the luck to succeed, and the experience was certain to be amusing. On the whole it seemed worth the risk. The High Commissioner was still telling me his proposals when my mind was made up. The plans were soon arranged. I was to go to Tonga in the steamer chartered to take back the Wesleyan exiles. I was not to be hampered by a detailed letter of instruc tions, but, furnished with a mere outline of the policy to be pursued, I was to present myself to the king, and there after be left with a free hand, to be guided by circum stances as to my future course. Meanwhile the exiles had been sent for from the island of Koro, and on their arrival they were assembled to hear from the High Commissioner the steps that were to be taken on their behalf. They were, he said, to go back to their homes after three years of exile, which they had borne with praiseworthy fortitude. They were not sent back by the British Government: they were invited to return by their own king, to whom alone they owed allegiance. They were not to think that because they had been exiled for wishing to continue in their Church, this invitation implied that their Church had triumphed. If they adopted a triumphant attitude in Tonga, or tried to push forward the cause of their Church, disturbances would be quite certain to follow, and they would be in a worse plight than before. Any such conduct on their part would be a poor return to the British Government"], [48, "28 HOW I TOOK OFFICE. who had befriended them, and whose one desire was to see Tonga at peace. They were especially to understand that the late events had come about from a true desire to help the king, and not from any ulterior object of extend ing British influence. Foolish things were often said in Tonga, and the most foolish of all was that England wished to take the country for her own. Victoria was not a \" stealing Queen,\" and wanted no country that belonged to others. She and her officers were now, as ever, ready to endorse the proverb, \" Tonga maa Tonga \" (Tonga for the Tongans), and it was their duty, whenever they heard this foolish statement made, to contradict it. Then William Maealiuaki replied on behalf of the exiles. He began with a long and very wearisome list of the presents given to them by the Fijian chiefs, and finished with a flowery oration of thanks. Charlotte, the king's daughter, an old woman of past sixty, had called upon Lady Thurston with her women, and had presented an immense roll of native cloth, which, she explained, had been brought to Fiji to serve as her shroud, but since God had allowed her to see her native country again and would let her die there, she wished to leave the shroud behind her. On August 16th the steamer Pukaki hauled into the wharf to receive her passengers. Counting children, the exiles numbered more than 120 souls. It was a curious scene. Half the population of Suva had assembled to see them off, including the High Commissioner and the Govern ment officials, and the wharf was crowded. Their native friends were weeping demonstratively, and the Tongans themselves were in a state of high emotion. The steamer,"], [49, "THE PROFITS OF MARTYRDOM. 29 dressed with all her signal flags, cast off amid deafening cheers from the shore party, and as she swung out into the stream she fired a salute. As the echoes of the last shot died away, the voices of the exiles were heard singing \" Home, Sweet Home,\" in their own language, taking well-sustained parts ; and they continued singing until we passed through the white line of reef -breakers, and the figures on shore had melted away in a cloud of white draperies. We had cast off our nationality, and were now Tongans. Our fellow-passengers spent their first day at sea in holding religious services, and in fussing about their luggage. These exiles for conscience' CO o sake had already reaped the reward of their constancy \u2014 an earthly re ward in the form of mats, native cloth, kava - bowls, and all things that are most precious to the native One of the Exiles heart. They numbered more than 120, and had left their homes almost naked. The}- went back with eighty tons of luggage \u2014 far more than they could possibly have accumulated in three years had they remained in their own country. Persecution had not been unprofitable. A grey fuzzy line just above the horizon, gradually re solving itself into cocoanut-palms \u2014 such was our first sight of Tongatabu. We steamed along the south-east coast, the Liku, watching the surf spout up in a hundred"], [50, "30 HOW I TOOK OFFICE. geysers as each heavy sea forced the water into the cave like tunnels in the reef; between the main island and picturesque Eua ; through an intricate channel among the reef islets, until some houses showed white against the thick mass of palms. This was Nukualofa. In the sun- light every colour was intense \u2014 the blue of the sea, the white of the foam and coral-sand, and the green of the vegetation. From the moment when the first land was sighted the exiles began to show signs of anxiety, which increased with every throb of the propeller. They got out mats from their bundles, presumably in order to land neatly dressed ; but, to our surprise, we saw that the outer mat petticoats they were putting on were impossibly dirty and ragged. Not ragged enough, however, to satisfy their critical taste, for as we neared the shore they began nervously to tear and unravel the edges of these filthy garments, stopping at times to inspect their progress towards disreputability. We had yet to learn that a Tongan expresses humility, repentance, and respect for dignities by the raggedness of his attire. The High Commis sioner's advice regarding their demeanour on arrival had not been lost upon them. We were boarded by the Collector of Customs and the Vice-Consul, and while we were still talking to them, two"], [51, "31 THE SWING OF THE PENDULUM. excited missionaries dashed up the ladder and fell upon their flock. It was a demonstration that might well have been spared, for the wharf was now filling with people, and it was the interest of the mission, as well as of the exiles, that they should return as the king's subjects, and not as members of a Church of which he disapproved. Meanwhile the chief men among the exiles, William Maealiuaki and Matealona, landed to report themselves to Tukuaho, the Premier, and we pulled to the wharf and landed among the crowd of sight-seers. I tried in vain to detect any enthusiasm, but, with the exception of the near relations of the exiles, who could be distinguished from the others by their eager questioning of the native crew of our boat, the people, who numbered perhaps 150, seemed to have come from mere motives of curiosity. Mrs S., the daughter of one of the missionaries, explained the absence of demonstration by saying that we had been expected on the previous Sunday, when large numbers had awaited our arrival ; but this explanation scarcely accounted for the absence of the townspeople, who had had fully two hours' notice of the arrival of the steamer. The people assembled were scarcely more than would have come to see the arrival of the ordinary monthly steamer. Mrs S. went on to say that affairs were less satisfactory than had been hoped. The king had gone away to Haapai to finish the building of a church. There had been a free sight between the lads of the Government and the Wes leyan colleges. The Collector of Customs had had a differ ence with the Premier about a copra contract, and, to the great inconvenience of the public, had closed the Customs office for a whole day as a protest. Moreover, \" certain"], [52, "32 HOW I TOOK OFFICE. persons \" had been endeavouring to set my native col leagues against me, and they were so demoralised by the turn affairs had taken that they talked freely of resigna tion. There were, in short, rumours of wars everywhere, and not a shilling had been taken as taxes since the High Commissioner left a month before. A little later I heard the other side of the story, which was that an enterprising copra-trader had persuaded the native Premier to proclaim that the Government would accept copra in lieu of money for taxes, and to sell the copra thus obtained to him at a fixed rate ; and Tukuaho, being new to the business, had been easily persuaded that the offer was disinterested, and had acted upon it, to the great indignation of the rival traders and the detriment of the Government, as will be explained hereafter. But the worst news of all, although the least unexpected, was that the Free Church ministers were up in arms. They felt, naturally enough, that in Mr Baker they had lost a powerful champion, and that the Government was no longer to use its machinery for the annoyance of their adversaries, the Wesleyans. The return of the exiles was a triumph for the minority, for among them were the only persons of rank who remained faithful to the old Church. Mr Baker was their prophet and their dcfensor fidci, who alone could keep alive the spirit of enthusiasm, and insure the punctual payment of their salaries from the annual mission collections. Naturally enough, therefore, they \" talked lotu \" from their pulpits\u2014 that is to say, they vili fied the rival sect, and hinted that the removal of Mr Baker was but the preface to the seizure of the country by Great Britain. Now every Tongan is hysterically patri-"], [53, "REACTION. 33 otic, and has a deep-seated conviction that the sovereigns of the other Powers do not sleep well of nights for ponder ing how they may plausibly compass the enthralment of Tonga. To accuse the chiefs who had taken office in the new Cabinet of selling their country to England was the surest way to make them extremely unpopular. This had been the news from Haapai, and the minds of the people in Tonga, both white and black, were deeply tinged with pessimism. There was a general undefined feeling that something was going to happen. c"], [54, "34 III. THE SHIP OF STATE AND HER CREW. My first business was to see my colleague, George Tukuaho, who had sent to say that he was confined to his house with a bad headache. On my last visit to Tonga, four years before, he was just recovering from a serious illness ; and though I had seen much of his father, Tungi, I had only conversed once with Tukuaho, and then only upon such general subjects as the comparison of the military .genius of Julius C\u00e6sar and the first Napoleon, whose lives I had found him reading in his own language. He was then commandant of the king's Guards, who numbered twenty men, and in that capacity he had had the shrewdness to outwit Mr Baker, then all-powerful. It had suggested itself to the Premier's fertile brain that military service might be turned to account against the stiff-necked Wesleyans, and he had accordingly compelled a number of the College boys to enlist in the militia. They were first required to take the oath, but this they refused to do, unless they were told to what they were going to bind themselves. A refusal to take the oath being at that time in the nature of sedition, they were"], [55, "35 THE NATIVE PRIME MINISTER. charged with that offence before the police court ; but Kubu, the new Minister of Police, who was then Police George Tukuaho. Magistrate, was not a creature of Mr Baker, and dis missed the case. This would not do at all, and Mr Baker"], [56, "36 THE SHIP OF STATE AND HER CREW. ordered them to be tried by court-martial. How a man who has not yet enlisted can be tried by court-martial was a technicality that did not trouble him. He sent an order to Tukuaho to form a court, but Tukuaho replied that he would like to have the order in writing. Mi- Baker committed the order to paper. The court sat, and the men were found guilty of refusing to take the oath with their eyes shut. A messenger was despatched to Mr Baker to inquire what sentence was to be pro nounced. The verbal answer was, \" Two years.\" But Tukuaho wanted to have this in writing too, and Mr Baker, grumbling at his pertinacity, wrote the order on a half sheet of note-paper. All this showed no very high degree of intelligence on the part of the commandant ; but the surprising incident was that he carefully pre served both letters, feeling that some day they might be useful. Many months later the High Commissioner, Sir C. Mitchell, held the inquiry before alluded to, and Mi- Baker was examined as to the reason for the monstrous sentence inflicted on these men. He knew, he said, noth ing whatever about it ; indeed he thought it severe him self, but, being inflicted by a court-martial, he had no power to interfere. Then Tukuaho was asked why he had pronounced such a sentence for no offence at all, and he said that he would not have passed such a sentence without written orders. Could he produce these orders ? He thought he could, and went to fetch them. The Premier's face meanwhile had been undergoing a change ; he was evidently feeling very uncomfortable. When the letters were produced, he said that he had quite forgotten having written them, but that they now refreshed his"], [57, "37 THE PREMIER AT HOME. memory, and he glanced at Tukuaho in a very peculiar way. Soon after this Tukuaho was relieved of his command, and made mayor of his father's town, Mua, some twelve miles from the capital. He had occasion to see the Premier upon matters connected with his duties. The great man was busily writing in his office. After waiting many minutes Tukuaho rose to go, saying that he saw the Premier was engaged. \" Sit where you are,\" replied Mi- Baker, \" until I am ready,\" \u2014 and he wrote on as if the safety of the nation depended on his pen. At last he stopped writing, and swung round in his chair. Tukuaho had heard from others of this mode of inspiring awe, and was in nowise disconcerted ; he returned the First Minis ter's fixed gaze. \" We are alone : tell me what cause for ill-will you have against me.\" Tukuaho raised his eye brows with a mild surprise, and intimated that he did not understand the question, but had come to ask when he was to distribute tax-allotments in Mua. \" You know well enough what I mean. Why did you betray me ? \" said the Premier, coining to the point. \" I have much love for you,\" answered Tukuaho, \" and I want you to tell me about Fifita's allotment.\" From that day Tukuaho was a marked man, but one to be conciliated rather than threatened. I found him in his new house still unfinished. A ngatu screen was suspended across the room, behind which a moscpiito - net was visible. A lamp stood upon a trade box, and the corner of the room was piled high with official-looking papers and torn envelopes in hopeless con fusion. I made a mental note of an admonition to be"], [58, "38 THE SHIP OF STATE AND HER CREW. administered to my colleague on this head, for any papers left in a Tongan's house are certain to be read by his re tainers, who will straightway bruit their contents at every kava-ring in the town, supplying the gaps with imagina tive but sensational details. Tungi was sitting in the middle of the floor, and rose to greet me with his usual courtly grace. He seated me on a box, and went to wake his son, who was sleeping off his headache in the mosquito net. Tukuaho presently emerged looking very unwell, but delighted to see me. He has the same massive head and features as his father ; and though only thirty - two, he already shows signs of attaining the ample proportions that no Tongan chief seems to escape. His face is plea sant, though the eyes are set at a peculiar Mongolian angle, very far apart, and the eyelids habitually droop over them. His manners err if anything on the side of showing too great a desire to please, but his conversation in his own language is very intelligent. I had hoped that he and some of my other colleagues could speak English, but I now found that their English was \" pidgin,\" and cpiite unsuited for conducting diplomatic negotiations with exactitude. It was a serious disappointment, for my knowledge of Tongan was slender, and my experience in Fiji and elsewhere had taught me never to trust to an interpreter in dealing with natives. I had before me the necessity of mastering the language sufficiently to speak in public before I could really begin my work, but for tunately my knowledge of Fijian stood me in good stead ; for though the two languages differ more than French differs from English, yet the idiom and metaphor is much alike, as one might expect among races who live under"], [59, "THE DANGERS OF CABINET MEETINGS. 39 similar conditions and have occasional intercourse with one another. Henceforward I devoted all my spare mo ments to the study of the language, particularly that form of it in use towards the chiefs, which may be called the language of respect : the mastery of such nuances gives the appearance of far greater facility than I was likely to acquire in the limited time at my disposal. Before I left Tonga the necessity for using the language in public, and for drafting the new code of law, had given me consider able fluency; and I was able to realise the vast superiority and richness of Polynesian as compared with Melanesian languages. My two colleagues were in a state of the deepest de jection. They were inclined to be reticent, and told me that they could make no changes without consulting the king. I said that one change at least did not require the sanction of his Majesty \u2014 namely, that the members of the Cabinet should meet together periodically to agree upon a common policy, and that none of them should take any important action without consulting his colleagues. This, I explained, was the rule of action in eveiy Cabinet in the world, and it was, moreover, provided for in the Tongan Constitution. They seemed much disturbed at this announcement, and Tukuaho replied that it was a new thing in Tonga, and that his colleagues would not understand it, but would say that he was arrogating to himself the powers of the king. He said that already the Hahavea chiefs, Maafu and Lavaka, actuated by jealousy, were stirring up the people against him though he had as yet done nothing, and had said bitter things in public about being subject to his family : that Tungi,"], [60, "40 THE SHIP OF STATE AND HER CREW. his father, wanted to resign, and was pressing him to follow his example. They were sowing distrust of him in the king's mind, and there was a strong party of Free Church ministers and their sympathisers in Haapai and Vavau who were doing all in their power to damage him. I soundly rated Tungi for his pusillanimity, saying that it was cowardly to throw up the sponge before we had even made one effort. They were appointed by the king, and as long as they had the king's support it did not matter two straws what people said or did. As for words, no Government in the world existed without enemies who abused it, but men who undertook public duties knew that words hurt no one. Our course was plain : we must see the king, and assure ourselves of his support ; if he refused to support us, then it would be time to resign. Tukuaho assented ruefully. Other Governments, he said, did not mind having enemies because they had friends as well ; but he seemed to have lost all his friends, and the king himself listened to others rather than to him. Poor Tukuaho's political prospects did not look very bright certainly, but I would not admit this to him, and before I left we had arranged to visit the king in Haapai, while Kubu, the Minister of Police, and his uncle, Sateki, were to leave at once for the outlyino groups of Vavau, Niua-foou, and Niua-tobutabu,1 to hold meetings and explain the nature of the changes that had taken place, before any garbled account should reach them. Until the house lent to us by the Tongan Government 1 See map at end."], [61, "THE PUBLIC DEBT. 41 should be ready, we enjoyed the hospitality of Mr Camp bell, who had the pretty house occupied by Mr Baker until the attempt on his life caused him to remove to the king's palace for safety. The officers of H.M.S. Egeria, who had finished their survey-work and were about to leave for China, dined with us. Our host had wisely imposed a fine for any one who uttered the word \" Baker \" at his table, for since the great Minister's de parture his exploits had been so much discussed as to become nauseating. Fortunately for the conversation there had been a mutiny on the Egeria, and her transfer to the China station was designed to take her crew out of the Australian atmosphere, where freedom, as known to the rampant section of the press, means resistance to all constituted authority. I spent the next day in the Premier's office. It is elaborately furnished with bookshelves and padded leather arm-chairs ; but when I opened one of the cupboards in the clerk's room my heart sank. A ton or so of official documents had been pitchforked into the pigeon-holes like so much waste-paper: these must all be examined and set in order before the actual position of the Govern ment could be ascertained. Tukuaho had been fairly active with his pen since his accession to office, but no copies of his letters were forthcoming, and none of his papers had been filed. The claims against the Govern ment, as far as could be ascertained, amounted to some \u00a37000, which under proper scrutiny could be reduced to something over \u00a36000 ; but the arrears of pay due to Government officials exceeded \u00a38000 \u2014 \u00a315,000 in all and to meet these claims there was \u00a32000 in the"], [62, "42 THE SHIP OF STATE AND HER CREW. Treasury. The European officials were hard-working men, wretchedly underpaid, two of them being married men with families. To leave their salaries nine months in arrear was sheer cruelty, but the native officials were certain to grumble if their claims were given precedence. When, however, a few days later, a proposal to pay the European officials was laid before the king, he laughed and said, \" Why not ? We Tongans can live on a bit of yam or kumala, but these white men must eat money or die of hunger. Let them be paid.\" One of Mr Baker's later freaks had been to import, at great expense, a number of labourers from Mahgaia in the Cook group, to form banana plantations on a large scale. To make the prospect of earning working expenses still more illusory, he had ordered railway plant to take the bananas to the steamer, and had even included a passenger car, the distance being at most a mile. We had now to pay off these labourers and send them home. They had done little work, and even if they had, the proceeds of their labour would have gone into the pockets of the New Zealand firm who had contracted to buy the bananas. This charge and the Europeans' arrears of salary nearly swallowed up our scanty balance. Our financial difficulties did not affect the spirits of the Government employees. The Premier's clerks were thor oughly happy with their new toys. Mataka, the chief clerk, had unearthed the Great Seal and a box of wafers, and was affixing it to blank sheets of note-paper. Sibu, his junior, was experimenting with a very messy contriv ance, called, I believe, a pantograph, by squeegeeing print ing-ink upon a stencil-paper, whence it travelled to his"], [63, "AN UNNECESSARY COMPLICATION. 43 face and clothes by way of his fingers. When order was resumed I tried to ascertain what prospect there was of our receiving any of the arrears of taxes. The first act of the new Government had been to remit the arrears of taxes due in the year 1888, and those who had paid were not unnaturally indignant, and declared that they would regard their taxes paid in that year as those due for 1889. Then the copra-trader had got hold of Tukuaho, and per suaded him that he would earn the lasting gratitude of his people if he would make them pay their taxes in copra, and refuse to accept money. But, to save appear ances, tenders had been called for, and the trader in ques tion tendered, but informally. I, knowing nothing of any arrangement between him and Tukuaho, called upon him to amend his tender to coincide with the conditions pub lished in the ' Gazette,' and within an hour I received a visit from his partner, who flatly declined to amend the tender, on the ground that he had a private arrangement with Tukuaho. My unwary colleague seemed to have tied a millstone about our necks, for his signature could not be repudiated. He had pledged himself to compel the natives, who could readily pay money for their taxes, to bring copra \u2014 a product which many of them did not possess, aud which had to be transported many miles in carts over bad roads instead of being sold to the store keeper in their own village. Knowing that I was on my way to advise him, he had yet yielded to the first trader who had approached him ; and, at the time when the natives needed every encouragement to pay their taxes, he had thrown a serious difficulty in their way. I have dwelt thus at length on this incident because it had after-"], [64, "44 THE SHIP OF STATE AND HER CREW. wards most disastrous results, and led to a lawsuit which, though amusing enough in the facts it brought to light, wasted seventeen days of valuable time. I felt bound to compromise the matter in the most advantageous manner possible, and to content myself by making the trader sign a bond which left the Government quite free as to the amount of copra they delivered, and allowed them to receive money for taxes after January 1, four months hence. I had many times to curse Tukuaho's naivete and good-nature when I saw taxpayers turned away from the tax-office windows with money in their hands, and carts full of copra passing the Government sheds on the way to the traders', while the Treasury safes were nearly empty. During the next few days it was clear enough that, friendly as my colleagues were, the people did not care to conceal their distrust. This was easily explained. The white traders as a body were quiet, law-abiding men, but there was the usual proportion of malcontents who are \" agin any Guv'ment.\" If these people must have a Gov ernment, they infinitely prefer a purely native one, which allows them opportunities unattainable when a country man of their own is at the head of affairs. Some of these, fearing that my presence would upset their pet schemes of abolition of the poll-tax on Europeans and the Customs dues, had been telling the natives that I had been sent to Tonga to smooth the way for annexation. This is the one story that every Tongan will believe, even though a white man has told it to him, and I knew that it would take months of hard work to live it down. The Free Church ministers, moreover, had not been idle, and their per-"], [65, "45 A SON OF THE IMMORTALS. sistent misrepresentation of me as a champion of the Wesleyans had contributed to the popular suspicion. The manners of the average Tongan to a white man whom he dislikes and does not fear leave much to be desired. I found myself jostled off the road by men on horseback, and subjected to many other petty annoyances. All this had to be borne good-temperedly if my mission was to be successful ; and I knew that in a few months I could succeed in changing the hostility and suspicion into friendliness. My first task was to inspire the chiefs with confidence : the people would follow their lead all in good time. As soon, therefore, as we were installed in our new house, I invited Fatafehi, the king's grandson, to visit me. This chief enjoys a far higher degree of rank than his relation ship to the sovereign would confer upon him, for he is a chief of the spiritual line ; and now that the office of Tui Tonga has been abolished, and Christianity has removed the superstition by which the descendant of the Immor tals was surrounded, he enjoys the highest consideration in the kingdom after the king. To him alone, besides the king, is used the peculiar language of respect by which the deity is addressed. Of the curious polity of Tonga before the introduction of Christianity I shall speak here after. Although hedged by divinity, Fatafehi bears his honours with great ease and good-humour. He has a jolly round face, fringed with grizzled whiskers and moustache ; and his kindly expression and burly figure give him the appear ance of a gentleman farmer when times were good. He is, moreover, almost the only Tongan who, in dress clothes,"], [66, "46 THE SHIP OF STATE AND HER CREW. looks like a gentleman. We had been good friends during my former visit, while his wife Fujipala was still alive. When they dined with me on that occasion, they drove up in an antiquated buggy, with a Hindustani coachman from Fiji, he in dress clothes, and she in mauve satin, bonnet and boots included, attended by four maids of honour, as befits a king's granddaughter who weighs seventeen stone. Poor Fuji ! her good sense and influence are badly wanted now. Her son, Taufaahau, deprived of her control, was running wild, and since he was generally regarded as the heir to the king, it was imperative that Fatafehi should bring him under some sort of discipline. It was partly to urge this upon him that I had invited him to visit me, and partly because he had never shown animus against the Wesleyans ; and I wished him, as Governor of Haapai, to endeavour to check the disaffection which the speeches of the Free Church ministers were creating. When he arrived, Vaea, a chief among the returned exiles, was drinking tea. He had just taken a cup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other when the great man was announced. \" Who ? \" asked Vaea, not catching the name. \" Tui Belehake,\" I answered, giving his title ; and as I spoke the portiire was flung aside and Fatafehi strode in heartily. When I looked round Vaea had disappeared from his chair, and was squatting in the corner with de pending lower jaw and eyes fixed vacantly on the ceiling. I spoke to him once or twice, trying to include him in the conversation, but he did not seem to hear. The only sio-n of life about him was the trembling of the teacup in his palsied hand. Suddenly he got up, and having no free hand to move the curtain, he plunged at it head-foremost,"], [67, "47 A HEREDITARY LAUGH. teacup and all, and disappeared. We found the empty cup afterwards on the lawn, turned upside down in the saucer. When his hostess had recovered from the effect of this unexpected exit, she asked Fatafehi for an explan- ation. He laughed heartily at her ignor ance of the usages of polite society, and said, \" It is the tabu. He can't eat while I'm here. Ha ! ha ! ha ! \" Fatafehi's laugh once heard was not to be forgotten. It began low down in his per son and bubbled up wards, until suddenly the upper part of his head fell back, and a mirthful roar burst forth that shook his portly presence to its foundation. It was a ready laugh, mirth- compelling, and it car ried far. When we \" He plunged at the curtain head -fore most.\" told Mrs S. of our august visitor, her first question was, \" Did you notice his laugh ? No other Tongan laughs like that. They say that it is hereditary in his family. You see it is his rank : no other Tongan would be allowed to laugh like that.\" Thereafter I looked with great respect"], [68, "48 THE SHIP OF STATE AND HER CREW. upon Fatafehi's hereditary laugh, the more since I found it useful when debates in the House were stormy, and the opposition had to be silenced. I was anxious to learn from Fatafehi what reception the exiles had really had, for rumours were most con flicting. From his account it appeared that while they had received no welcome from the people at large, this had been unnoticed in the presents that had been showered upon them by their immediate relations and friends irrespective of Church. They were housed in a large disused building called the \"Women's College,\" until such time as they could make arrangements for moving to their old homes, or the mission should appoint such of them as were native ministers to vacant parishes. They had not forgotten the hospitality shown to them in Fiji, for late in the afternoon G , who was alone in the house, saw a long train of men and women approaching with bales on their shoulders, evidently bent on perpe trating a ceremony. Now one cannot express gratitude with any accuracy in dumb-show, and the servants were therefore despatched in hot haste for an interpreter. Fortunately kind Mrs S. arrived just in time to save the situation, and reply to the set speech in which we received vicariously the gratitude clue to the Government of Fiji. It took the practical shape of a pony, several live pigs, rolls of ngatu, mats, combs, and the inevitable kava. Like all native presents, they had eventually to be paid for in return gifts of an equal or higher value. Our new house adjoined the Government College, bein\u00ab in reality the house of the English principal when such an officer existed. The undergraduates were a continuous"], [69, "49 SHOE-LEATHER AS A MEANS OF SALVATION. source of amusement for the first few days. On week days they were taught shorthand and the higher mathe matics by native tutors in cap and gown ; in the evenings they sang incessantly in excellently sustained parts. On Saturday they turned out with knives and baskets to clean up the College premises ; and on Sunday they all put on trousers and mortar-boards, and were marched off two and two to church, carrying their shoes in their hands. At the church-door the whole sixty pairs halted to put on their boots, and enter the house of God with dignity. They formed a magnificent choir of bass voices, and rendered the trashy Methodist hymns with a grandeur that would have greatly surprised their composers. During the sermon the sixth form were busy transcribing the homily in shorthand. D"], [70, "50 IV. HOW I FARED AT COURT. At length, on August 27, Fatafehi's schooner the Malokula was declared ready for sea, and I embarked with Tukuaho, Fatafehi, and Chief Clerk Mataka. The vessel was un pleasantly crowded with old women, whose prostrate bodies made the traverse of the deck at night impossible. At sunset we passed Malinoa, where lay the four men who were shot after the attempt on Mr Baker's life. Thence, clear of reefs, we stood on with a fair wind through the night until we could see the glare of the volcano of Tofua, then in eruption. After a fruitless attempt to capture a pig at Haafeva, which wasted a precious hour, we dropped anchor at Lifuka at nearly noon. We were on the lee side of a low narrow island, nowhere more than thirty feet above high-water mark, but covered with grass and cocoa - nuts to the water's edge. Other islands of the same kind stretched away to the north and south of us. The town was a mere row of iron roofed stores on the beach : behind them could be seen the usual native huts dotted about among the trees, with grass growing right up to the doors, and horses tethered"], [71, "THE KING'S KAVA. 51 here and there between them. A few cable - lengths to the northward of our anchorage was the spot where the privateer Port-au-Prince was treacherously taken by Finau Ulukalala, and on the beach opposite to us the master and crew were murdered. The two rusty iron guns among the ballast in the hold of our schooner are part of her armament. To this event we are indebted for a book of travels that closely approaches ' Eobinson Crusoe ' in style and surpasses it in interest. Mariner, one of the sur vivors, spent scarcely four years among the people, yet his account of the Tongans, elicited by questions put to him by Dr Martin, leaves little to be added by later travellers. The book so produced has become a classic : one does not know which most to admire, Mariner's observation and wonderful memory, or Martin's ingenuity, industry, and pure style.1 As our visit to the king was to be one of state, we had brought with us an old matahile, or master of cere monies, who landed with a root of kava to announce our arrival. We followed him immediately afterwards along the beach to the great native house occupied by the king. Before we reached it w-e saw the old man coming down from the unfinished church, followed by a train of his matabules. We halted until a mat was spread under the shade of some large trees, and his attendants formed a kava-ring, a large oval, with the bowl facing the king. Fatafehi then led me round outside the oval of sitting men, and we took our seats on the king's left, with our matabule between us and him. On my left was a white haired man with very bright eyes, who afterwards proved 1 Mariner's Account of the Tonga Islands."], [72, "52 HOW I FARED AT COURT. to be Kaho the chief jailer, and therefore the most im portant authority after the Governor. The king sat quite silent and impassive except for a nervous side glance of the eyes, which would have given him a suspicious look if it had not been evidently involuntary. Tukuaho had slunk off to the place of dishonour behind the bowl, where some of the attendants were pounding the root on a flat stone that rang out melodiously. This was because his father is still living, and no man in Tonga has any titular rank or status until his father be dead. At the king's kava the circle is sacred to chiefs and the matabules. For fully five minutes, while the kava was being pounded, not a word was spoken. The thirty or forty men who com posed the ring stared straight at the grass, oppressed by a sense of decorum as rigid as the etiquette at St James'. Suddenly, without a word of warning, our matabule shouted at the top of his voice to the matabule on the king's right,"], [73, "THE CEREMONY. 53 \" Oku lelei a Tonga \" (All is well at Tonga), and the other shouted back, \" Koe !\" (Indeed). Then our voice yelled, \" We left Tonga yesterday with a fair wind, and arrived to-day.\" The other barked his monosyllable, \" Koe ! \" After this conversation languished. I looked at the king to see how he would take their flagrant breach of manners, expecting that these unmannerly vassals who talked across him at the top of their voices would receive some reproof ; but he made no sign, and I was left to conclude that this mode of conversation was adopted in deference to the king's growing deafness. The pounded root, which had fallen from the stone upon a small mat, had been from time to time shot into the bowl, which was now handed to a man who sat directly opposite to the king with a crowd of commoners behind him. He tilted it up to show the contents, and cried, \" Koc kava cni huo tulei\" (This kava is pounded). The matabule on the king's right shouted, \" Palu \" (Mix), and two men came forward and sat one on each side of the bowl facing one another \u2014 the one with a fan to keep off the flies, and the other with some water-gourds. The man who presided at the bowl now rinsed his hands by pouring water over them from one of the gourds, and then squeezed the pounded root into a pyramid in the bottom of the bowl. The matabule now cried, \" Lingi ae vai\" (Pour in the water), and the contents of the gourds were slowly poured in, while the kava-maker kneaded the mass with both hands. Then the matabule cried, \" Tuku ae vai \" (Stop pouring), and the man dropped his gourds, and took up a banana-leaf to help his fellow in keeping off the flies. The matabule now cried, \"Ai ac fau \" (Put in the"], [74, "54 HOW I FARED AT COURT. strainer), and a tassel of the fibres of the yellow hibiscus, in shape and size looking not unlike a deck-swab, was laid floating upon the surface of the kava. The kava-maker now pushed the edges of this strainer carefully down to the bottom of the bowl, drawing it gently towards him, and bringing it up to the rim of the bowl till it overlapped the part that still floated, thus enclosing the fibres of the root in a sort of net. Then drawing the whole to the broad rim of the bowl, he folded it double, and wrung it out till the muddy fluid had slopped back into the bowl, and the strong fibres of the strainer cracked. He now handed it to his companion on the left, who shook it out and combed out the fibres with his fingers before giving it back. This process was repeated until all the fibres of the kava suspended in the fluid had been removed. These waste fibres, called efi, were afterwards pounded again in one of the neighbouring houses by some of the commoners. During this operation the most perfect silence was kept. Three men now came into the circle carrying baskets of boiled plantains, which they emptied in a heap on banana leaves, and, by the direction of the matabule, distributed amongst us \u2014 two plantains each. Before eating mine I waited to see what the others would do, but no one touched them, and before the end of the ceremony they were swept up and taken away in baskets. In Mariner's time, eighty seven years ago, they would have been eaten : now the custom has become an empty form, and survived like the buttons on the back of the modern dress-coat. The straining of the kava being now completed, the man at the bowl cried, \"IC-uo ma ac kava ni\" (This kava is clear), and the matabule answered, \"Fakatau\" (Pour out)."], [75, "A BIT OF FOLK-LORE. 55 Three or four men rose from behind the bowl and squatted within the circle, each holding a polished cocoa-nut shell. The kava-maker filled each in turn, using the strainer as a sponge, and, as each shell was filled, the man holding the fan cried in a peculiar long-drawn wail, \"Kara kuo heka \" (The kava is lifted), and the matabule replied, \"Angi in,,,, 1\" naming the title of each recipient. As each was named he clapped his hands to show the cupbearer where he was sitting. Two of the king's matabides drank first, then the king, then Fatafehi, then another mata bule ; then there was a pause, for the presiding matabule had to ascertain my name, which, being imperfectly caught, was reproduced as \"Angi maa Tobisoni.\" After several others had drunk, the matabule cried, \" Mai ma'aku, \" (Bring it to me), and received his own share. The distribution followed certain strict laws of precedence, which it is the matabule's trade to know. The first cup is given to the principal matabule, the second to the chief next in rank to the presiding chief, the third to the chief himself. Had Fatafehi been a visitor instead of Governor of the island, he would have received the first cup, but being regarded as a chief of the place, to whom no special com pliment was necessary, he received it immediately before the king, a sure indication that he was next in rank to him. In kava-parties of less ceremony, when the kava is brewed more than once, the order is changed. At the second brew the president drinks first, and the person next to him in rank third, the matabule intervening. The Tongans give a rather crude piece of folk-lore to account for this custom, the opposite of that observed in Fiji, where the chief always drinks first. They say that"], [76, "56 HOW I FARED AT COURT. there was a time, many years ago, when their fathers believed that the kava, growing everywhere wild in the forest, was a deadly poison. But one day a man going to his plantation saw a rat gnawing a kava-root. He waited expecting to see it die, but it ate on greedily, and at last ran off uninjured. Much excited by what he had seen, he hastened to tell the Tui Tonga, taking the gnawed root with him to bear out his statement. The chief listened to him and said, \" If the rat gnawed the kava and lived, then surely is the plant not poisonous : perhaps it is even a useful medicine ; let us try it.\" So they took shell knives, and scraped the root, and kneaded it with water, and presented it to the Tui Tonga in a cup. But he, look ing at it, said, \" Perhaps this fellow lied, and the kava is poison after all : let another drink first, that we may know.\" And he gave the cup to the matabule on his left hand, bidding him drink, and the chief sat gazing at him to see if he would die ; and after a while he called for another cup, and gave it to the matabule on his right hand, saying, \" Drink, for perhaps your fellow has a stronger stomach than I, and that which harms him not may kill me.\" And when both had drunk and were unharmed the Tui Tonga drank the cup, and found it pleasant to the taste, and bade them gather the kava from the forest, and let him drink of it daily. Thus it became the usage of the chief to drink the third cup, after the fashion of that Tui Tonga who made a trial of it on the bodies of his matabides. When the bowl was empty I whispered to Fatafehi that he should announce me as the bearer of a letter to the king from the High Commissioner. He passed the mes-"], [77, "THE HOUSE OF AN HONEST OFFICIAL. 57 sage on to our matabule, who shouted a mangled version of it across the king to the fellow sitting on his Majesty's right hand. This functionary as usual shouted \" Koc ! \" to the sea-birds circling over the reef. My letter was then passed to the king, who laid it down without looking at it. Meanwhile the second brew was being prepared, and although the formalities were sufficiently relaxed to per mit conversation, still the king stared straight before him, speaking to no one, and seeming not to hear the conver sation which was carried on at speaking-trumpet pitch out of compliment to his deafness. As soon as the cup had gone round again he rose without any warning, passed behind Fatafehi, and stooping over me, extended three fingers of his right hand in welcome, not from any motive of hauteur, but because the fourth finger had been sacrificed in his old heathen days to the manes of a deceased relative. Then without a word he walked off, carrying rather than leaning on his staff for all his ninety years, and disappeared into the long native house where he was staying. The kava-party at once broke up and went their several ways ; and Tukuaho emerged from his humble seat behind the bowl, and led us to a large but ruinous house that had once been the king's palace. This was to be our quarters during our visit. Fatafehi left us here to go to Government House and attend to his executive duties. A glance at that building \u2014 we could see it from our verandah \u2014 convinced me that whoever may have squandered the public funds, the Governor of Haapai was as guiltless as the Minister of Finance, whose house I had seen in Nukualofa."], [78, "58 HOW I FARED AT COURT. In Government House there were traces of a weather board bungalow, but the shingles had long ago rotted away, and been replaced from time to time with odd scraps of galvanised iron, rust-eaten through and through. The verandah posts had fallen, bringing down the roof with them, and the gaps in the flooring were mended with bits of an old canoe. But dilapidated as the house of his Majesty's representative was, it was a mansion in com parison to that of the Minister of Finance in Nukualofa, which seemed only to hold together to clear the character of its owner from any suspicion that an empty treasury might reasonably attach to him. It now transpired that Tukuaho had in his suite a couple of spies devoted to his interests, whose business was to loaf into the houses of their acquaintances and gauge public opinion. One of them, Peter Vi, would have surpassed even the \" Sham Squire \" if they had been con temporaries. His fat empty face and rotund person disarmed suspicion ; and he had besides an odour of the cloth about him, for his father and grandfather were both reverend pillars of the Free Church. The latter, indeed, was the oldest native minister, and a contemporary of the king. He paid us a visit in a hand-cart soon after we arrived, with a black coat over his vala, and a tall hat, carefully brushed the wrong way, upon his reverend head. The poor old gentleman had lost the use of his lower limbs and of part of his intellect ; but he said a prayer over us, and went his way, leaving a vapour of respect ability behind him which doubtless served to rehabilitate such disreputable politicians as we were believed to be : for although his son, as a Free Church minister, is dis-"], [79, "THE BLESSING OF THE CHURCH. 59 affected to the present Cabinet by profession, old Peter is long past polemics, for all creeds seem much alike when one is ninety, and expecting every day to have one's doubts explained away. Young Peter was only a third clerk in the Treasury at \u00a310 a-year, and bad at arith metic, and he wanted to be Sub-Inspector of Police at \" He paid ns a visit in a hand-cart.\" \u00a325 ; so, having his way to make in the world, he was a loyal spy. The other was Tukuaho's cousin. He was an ex-convict, and looked his part of spy so well that I suspect that the conversation at once turned upon the weather in any house that he entered ; but this did not prevent him from bringing blood-curdling reports of the hostility of the people, drawn probably from hearsay aided by a facile imagination. Having despatched our spies on secret service, we had"], [80, "60 HOW I FARED AT COURT. time to examine the three great rooms that formed our quarters. There was a depressing air of decayed grandeur about the worm-eaten furniture and weather-stained floor. A large room at the end became our pantry, and through the reed screen that divided it from the rest of the house came the incessant chatter of a Princess and two ladies from the jail who had been told off to attend to our wants. When not engaged in the menial service of wash ing dishes, they were drinking kava and retailing the local scandal in an atmosphere reeking with the fumes of sulukas. Lest I should seem to boast of my single experi ence of eating from the hand of a Princess of the Blood Eoyal, I hasten to add that Charlotte, the lady in ques tion, was a member of Fatafehi's household, and since we were his guests, it was in accordance with native etiquette that she should take charge of the culinary department. She discharged her task admirably, and rang the changes on fried chicken, fried sucking-pig, with baked cocoa-nuts and raw fish x for dessert, in the most practised manner. After luncheon Tukuaho became gloomy. Not a soul had come to greet him, and he was not accustomed to unpopularity. During his last visit, he said, his arm had been tired with shaking hands, and his digestion upset with the quantity of kava he had been obliged to drink with his admirers ; but now he saw all his old friends pass the door without looking in. Fat Peter's appearance 1 Raw fish is described by Mariner as a delicacy, and it was provided at my special request. It is cut up into lozenge-shaped pieces, and washed in salt water.

He returned from spying with black care on his brow, and with rumours of war on his lips. The people were talking of fighting ; they were not going to submit tamely to the yoke of Tungi and his son. \" When was Haapai under the authority of the Tongatabu chiefs ? \" But their resentment was not confined to Tukuaho \u2014 poor good-natured Fatafehi, their own Governor, came in for a share of the obloquy. Had he not sold his country to England ? And, as a proof of it, here was a white man sent down by the British Govern ment to meddle in their affairs. Tukuaho was much depressed, but, fortunately, at this juncture the burly Governor himself came in bursting with good-humour. He had heard the news too, but it did not disturb him in the least. As a descendant of the Immortals, human affairs were never more to him than food for amusement. His own rank was too secure for any popular aberration to disturb his composure, and his digestion was too good to allow him to look far into the future. \"Let them alone,\" he said ; \" they're all fools. All that we have to do is to prevent the king from listening to these Free Church ministers. Only wait until the bolotu on Sunday, then we'll talk to them. No, thanks. I have just eaten. I am full.\" The son of the Immortals sat down, and we got to business. The first thing to do was to persuade the king to hold a Privy Council, and to appoint me a Minister of the Crown ; the next, to pass certain draft Ordinances restraining the public expenditure within the limits of the Budget. First, I had to explain to my fellow-conspirators what a Budget really is. \" But,\" I asked, \" how is it that you do not"], [82, "62 HOW I FARED AT COURT. know all about this ? It is provided for in clause 19 of the Constitution.\" \" That may be,\" retorted Tukuaho ; \" many things are provided for in Mr Baker's Constitu tion, but we have never seen any of them done in Tonga. When has there been a ballot? Yet the Constitution says no one may sit in Parliament without being first elected by ballot. It is unlawful to confine any person without a warrant, yet where are the warrants for the prisoners in Tofua ? There are none, because the men were taken there without trial.\" I produced my draft Estimates, drawn up by Mr Camp bell, and unfolded the idea that no expenditure not first authorised by the Privy Council could be incurred. My colleagues scarcely contained their admiration ; but when I modestly produced voucher forms, and explained that not a penny could be spent without the signature of the Premier and the Auditor-General, and then only when proper detailed accounts are attached, my reputation as a statesman was thoroughly established. Fatafehi, giving short barks of half-comprehending appreciation, asked me to say it all over again. Then he leaned back in his chair, and laughed long and loud, looking all the while at Tukuaho, and crying, \" How now, boy ? If it had been like this in Mr Baker's time, eh ? Would there now be debts, eh ? Would the money have been stolen, eh ? This is a real thing. Look here,\" he added, be coming grave, \"you go and see Tubou now, and tell him all about it. Get him to fix the Council for to morrow, \u2014 just we three, and we will pass this law, and keep our money.\" \" Wait a moment,\" I interposed ; \" you must first have"], [83, "LEGISLATION BY EXPRESS. 63 me appointed one of the Ministers and a member of the Privy Council.\" \" Oh, Tubou will do that, of course. We cannot pass it without you. Look here, boy,\" he said, addressing his leader, \" go to Tubou now \u2014 he's alone : I saw him as I came up. I will send a policeman to keep the listeners off.\" So Tukuaho rather reluctantly girded on a ragged mat and walked down the slope to see his sovereign, and a police man in a smart uniform tunic and bare legs followed to clear the anteroom. This precaution proved to be useless, for anon we heard the voice of our colleague proclaiming State secrets in a voice that wounded the ear. He came back delighted with himself. The king had laughed more than once. The policeman had seen him laugh and would tell the town : it would have great results. Tubou bad told him all about the church he was building, and he told Tubou the news from Tongatabu. It was this that had made him laugh. \" But did he say that he would have a Council ? \" I asked anxiously, surprised at my colleague's levity. \" Yes, at ten o'clock. I had almost forgotten.\" \" And did he say that I should be appointed Assistant Premier ? \" \" Yes, so he did. I am to write a letter of appointment for you.\" Then we laid our plans. The new Ordinances must first be passed, and as the king knew that the Privy Council had power to pass Ordinances between the ses sions of the Legislative Council, there ought to be no difficulty in persuading him to sign them. Then, if he"], [84, "64 HOW I FARED AT COURT. were still in a good humour, we were to urge upon him the necessity of returning to Tongatabu to hold a great meeting of the people, and order them to pay their taxes. We sat on far into the night, discussing our plan of cam paign between the bowls of kava, until the Head Jailer and the Sub-Inspector of Police, both malcontents, came in, ostensibly to do us honour, but in reality to hear us talk and spread the news. But when they had all gone Peter's moon - face clouded, and he whispered his dire tidings into Tukuaho's willing ear. The town was sus picious and uncomfortable. \" Tukuaho sits all day with the white man writing. Let them write on. The coun try will not be lost to us by writings. There will be war before that happens.\""], [85, "65 V. HOW I' BECAME A PRIVY COUNCILLOR. I woke early with the feeling that a crisis had to be gone through during the day, and that we should need all our energies. I fondly hoped that a spark of enthusiasm would have been awakened in the breast of my colleague, and that he would be as eager as I to have a common plan of action laid down before our visit to the king, on which so much depended. But to my intense disgust the kava bowl, surrounded by its ministering spirits, was in course of preparation, and a precious hour was wasted. I lived to know that to expect a Tongan chief to forego native ceremonial in the exigencies of public business is to court disappointment. We had time for a hurried meal when Fatafehi, clad in decent black, came to escort me to the royal presence. He thought it better that I should see the king alone before the Council, and present the precious log of sandal-wood that I had brought as a present from the High Commissioner. He would stay, he said, during the interview and interpret for me. Eight men were pro duced, who lifted the tree on their shoulders, and preceded us to the native house that did duty for a palace, and, E"], [86, "66 HOW I BECAME A PRIVY COUNCILLOR. laying it endways to the door so that its entire length could be seen from within, retired. Then Fatafehi and I came forward. As soon as the king saw us he rose from his seat to fetch a chair for me from several that were set round the table in readiness for the Council. He was dressed in European clothes of rusty black cloth, and appeared to have been waiting for us for some time. The house was divided into three by reed partitions, and very meanly furnished : a green iron bed stead in the inner room covered with mats was the only bedroom furniture, and besides the table and office chairs in the middle room, there was only a shelf of the commonest crock ery. The outer room was occupied by his servants, who, I believe, were prisoners. It was characteristic of the king that while he had a well found house in Nukualofa, he lived from choice on the barest necessaries, and spent a large portion of his income on building churches. After we had shaken hands, Fatafehi announced in a stentorian voice that I had brought a little sandal-wood"], [87, "AN AUDIENCE. 67 from the High Commissioner. The king said, \"Fakafetai \" (Thanks), and there was a pause. I looked round for my interpreter : he was gone ! Here was I left sitting face to face with a monarch whose language I knew very imperfectly, bound to make a good impression while bellowing my halting sentences into his uncomprehend ing ear. \" Fatafehi shall pay for this,\" I thought savagely, trying the while to assume what I hoped was an ingratiating smile. The king laughed pleasantly. \" Malo hoo lelci \" (I am glad you are well), he said. I thought of the matabides, blessing them, and shouted, \" Koc ! \" Ah, you speak Tongan,\" said his Majesty, amiably \" A very little,\" I replied. There was silence, and to save the situation I said that I had lately been in the part of New Guinea to which the missionaries were going. The king was interested, and asked what the people were like. \" Is it true that they are teles ua ? \" he said. The word teles ua was unfamiliar, but I nevertheless shouted the universal \"Koc ! \" He chuckled much at this, and I wondered more than ever what telefua could mean. Then I tried to lead the conversation into political channels, and spoke of the debt. \" But we will pay it,\" he said. \" Yes, if the people will pay their taxes,\" I replied. \" Of course they will pay their taxes,\" he answered with easy conviction. After a few more remarks I murmured something about the Privy Council, and took my leave. Upon Fatafehi,"], [88, "68 HOW I BECAME A PRIVY COUNCILLOR. airing himself outside, I poured the vials of my wrath, and asked what telcfua meant. \" Having no covering \u2014 naked,\" he answered ; \" but why do you ask ? \" \" Because,\" I replied savagely, \" since you did not stay to interpret for me as you promised, I have told the king that the New Guinea people go about naked, which is not true.\" Fatafehi laughed his hereditary laugh. At ten o'clock we went down to meet the king in Council, followed by Mataka with his shorthand note-book and the Council minutes. As we went in the king took his place before a large Tongan Bible at the head of the table. Fatafehi and Tukuaho had moved to their seats, and I was on the point of taking mine when the king caught sight of me. My back was to the light and my face in shadow. He peered at me and said, \" Who is this papalagi (foreigner) who comes to our Council ? \" Tukuaho said, \" It is he of whom I told your Majesty.1 He who has come to help us, and make things plain.\" \" We have sent one foreigner away,\" said the king, \" and you bring another : I thought that the Council was to be for ourselves.\" This was a facer : without being in the Privy Council I should be utterly powerless, quite apart from the loss of prestige that such a rebuff would entail if it got abroad. 1 \" Hoo Afio \" is an exact equivalent for your Majesty, and the words are used in precisely the same connection. In former times they were ad dressed to the Tui Tonga only. In speaking of the king to a third person, \" Enc Afio \" (his Majesty) is said. Besides these words a number of special words for the verbs of sensation are used in speaking of, or to, the king or the Deity."], [89, "A REBUFF. 69 I had never been warned that the king was less anxious for my coming than were his Ministers, nor that the prin cipal argument used by his chiefs to induce him to dismiss Mr Baker was that they were quite prepared to govern their country without help from any foreigner. It flashed through my mind that I might stand on my dignity as the emissary of a foreign Government sent at the king's own request conveyed through his chief Minister, and insist upon the choice between admitting me to the Council or allowing me to resign and leave Tonga; but with the thought came the reflection that he would either admit me unwillingly, and henceforth regard me with suspicion, or accept my resignation. In the latter event I should return to Fiji to confess myself unable to do the work I had un dertaken : and English interests would be in a worse posi tion than if I had never come ; for with their sovereign's views every Tongan would agree, the Government would flounder deeper into the mire, and the German Vice-Con sul would be invited to give the aid in financial matters that I had failed to afford. So during the silence that followed the king's last remark, my mind was made up ; I would simply stand where I was, and pretend not to hear what was said. Fatafehi's elbow was close to me, and I fell back upon the undignified expedient of pinching it. He understood, and began to shout persuasive words into the king's ear. \" Pardon me,\" he said, \" it is about the money. Which of us understands the way of money, and such foreigners' things ? But this gentleman will explain it all to us : he is here only as an expounder.\""], [90, "70 HOW I BECAME A PRIVV COUNCILLOR. I stood my ground meanwhile, trying to look utterly unconscious, and after a pause the king said, \" Oku lelei be\" (Very well). We then took the oath, the terms of which forbid me to describe the proceedings, but I may say that before we rose I had succeeded in ingratiating myself with the king, and he had promised to visit Nukualofa, and to hold great meetings of his people in every province, urging them to pay their taxes, and declaring his confidence in his new Cabinet, a point on which proof was still wanting. Shortly after the Council Fatafehi was sent for by the king, and returned with a message from his Majesty ask ing my pardon for his having failed to recognise me. I believe that he would have resisted my admission to the Council if he had had time to consider the question, but his natural feeling of courtesy to a stranger prevented him from insisting on my withdrawal after I had entered his house. This curious misunderstanding, which so nearly ruined the success of my mission, showed me that I could not trust the discretion of any of my colleagues in matters concerning the king, in so great an awe did they stand of him. Tukuaho had asked the High Commissioner for my services without daring to obtain the full assent of his sovereign, as he had obtained his leave to appoint me Assistant Premier without touching on the question of my admission to the Council. Had I known this in time, I should have taken proper measures to win the kind's confidence before asking for a meeting of the Council : as it was, my colleague's blunder had saved me the delay"], [91, "SOCIETY IN HAAPAI. 71 which this would have entailed. The cue given by Tukuaho was a useful one, and for the present I became to the Tongans not a Minister of the Crown, but \" Koe tagata fakahinohino\" (The expounder \u2014 of the dark ways of civilised man). The Privy Council over, we had time to look about us. The island at this point is barely half a mile wide : every rood of it seems to be under cultivation, from the back of the town to the edge of the rocks on the Liku upon which the ocean-rollers, driven before the steady trade-wind, beat unceasingly. The Europeans of the place live in a row of stores on the beach, each hungry for copra, each fearing to give the natives credit, yet not daring to refuse lest they take their custom to a neighbour ; and each, when he has given credit, mortified by seeing his debtor pass his store to sell his copra to a hated rival. There is the agent of the great Hamburg firm, the agent for M' Arthur & Co., a free-lance or two, a carpenter, and the Customs officer of the port, who brings up a large family on \u00a3100 a-year. The only friendships in this heterogeneous society are mere alliances against a common foe, and as they are all by instinct against the Government, and can now have the exciting sport of setting the king against his Ministers, there is something very like reconciliation among them. On Sunday we went to church in a driving rain-storm, but, notwithstanding the weather, the little building was filled. The women in their native finery looked infinitely more respectable than their brothers and husbands, who had donned threadbare coats and trousers in honour of the day, but had stopped short of shoes. The king was"], [92, "72 HOW I BECAME A PRIVY COUNCILLOR. there, of course \u2014 nothing but illness prevents his attend ance at church. The sermon was dull, for there was no sedition in it, probably in deference to our presence : the preacher even called upon Tukuaho for an extempore prayer, and announced there would be a bolotu in the evening."], [93, "*7 Q VI. THE POLITICAL USES OF A STATE CHURCH. The bolotu, or night-service, is a growth of Tongan soil. As Christians the Tongans may no longer enjoy the mild excitement of taking kava to the shrine of a god, and see the priestess shiver and foam at the mouth in an ague fit, or hear her scream the favourable oracle in high falsetto. The missionaries have stopped all that. True, they may take to preaching, but they cannot all preach \u2014 there must be some to form the congregation. They have the histri onic instinct, and no outlet for it in private theatricals or drawing-room recitations ; therefore they wisely make the mission supply the place of that which it has taken away, and to do them justice, they have produced an exhibition far more picturesque than the religious orgies of the Salvation Army. The little thatched church blazed with kerosene-lamps that threw broad streaks of light from the windows upon the palm-leaves wet with the rain, lighting the gay valas and brown legs of several mysterious groups who had formed at a distance. We found the inside of the build-"], [94, "74 THE POLITICAL USES OF A STATE CHURCH. ing nearly empty, but there was a look of eager expectancy on the faces of the few old people who lined the walls.

At the end of each phrase they took a step for ward, and when they reached the reed pulpit their song merged into another in the far distance. It was the second choir : as their voices soared upward the first band became silent and scattered to their places along the"], [95, "A PIOUS DEBAUCH. 75 walls, amid the plaudits of the audience. So a second choir filed in, and a third and fourth, until the church was filled to overflowing. It was in reality a choral com petition between the different divisions of the town, the outcome of three weeks of practice under the direction of the composer. The native parson meanwhile took his stand in the pulpit, and gave out a text, which was sung with fine effect by the combined choirs to a tune of native composition. An inspiriting address followed, often interrupted by cries of applause. They were working up their enthusiasm for the real business of the evening. After the sermon there was a long pause, during which the people looked furtively at one another. At last an old woman stood up, and the shouts of \"Fakafctai\" became deafening. \" She is goin<f to tell about her soul,\" wins pered my neighbour. Upon this interesting subject she had a great deal to say in a monotonous flow of verbiage, drowned at times by the cries of \"Malo !\" I noticed, in deed, throughout the evening that the women had a far greater command of language than the men. Before she had finished, two middle-aged men and a very villanous looking policeman were on their feet. The first to rise caught the parson's eye, and gave us a very long and weary diagnosis of his spiritual symptoms. The second elder was jaunty, and gently chaffed his soul, exciting bursts of merriment by screwing up his eyes at the laughing places. Three or four others had now risen, and remained standing in penitent attitudes until their turn came. The criminal-looking policeman had his say first. With forced"], [96, "76 THE POLITICAL USES OF A STATE CHURCH. calm he told us what a sinner he had been, and at each disgraceful confession the audience shouted their applause. Then with bated breath he told of his awakening ; with suppressed emotion he described his inward tumult : words failed him ; he caught his breath, he flung up his arms pas sionately, and after a silent struggle his voice rent the air in a hideous yell, \" The Lord has got my soul ! \" He raved ; he tore open his shirt as if he would pluck the heart out of him ; and then, still raving, he flung himself on the ground in a frenzy of simulated sobs, and another took up the tale. It was a dis gusting exhibition, but it was the success of the evening.

Religion was to give place to politics. He told them that he had come to the church that evening to find comfort for his wounded spirit. He had landed on their shore with joy, thinking that he had come among old friends, but his joy had been turned into sorrow. They were his friends no longer \u2014 why ? He knew not, unless it was because a distasteful office had been forced upon him. Did they think that he had sought office ? No ! he was Premier by Tubou's com mand, not by his own choice.

There were some perhaps who loved the man who was gone. Well \u2014 he was not there to speak ill of the absent, but he would say this, that the accounts were now being audited, and that some very strange things were coming to light. Did they think that any Tongan could thread the dark passages of such cun ning ? No. The king knew that when he asked for a white man to be sent to audit the accounts, and to make the dark ways plain. He was present, sitting at his side. (I tried to look unconscious.) In six short months he would leave them : it would be useless for them to ask him to stay longer \u2014 he could not. But he (Tukuaho) was there to-night to speak of his soul, and not of politics. What had politics to do with a church in which before God all men were ecpial ? It was true that his soul was pained, but he had at least the comfort of knowing that he was doing his duty. Before the applause had subsided Fatafehi was on his feet. \" I hear that you are all angry with me. Very well : that's your affair. But what is it about ? \" He laughed \u2014 not his hereditary laugh, but a less pleasant sound. \" I will tell you why you are angry,\" he went on, and lashed the mischief-makers with great vehemence, not even deign ing to end his speech with a devotional peroration. \" There will be less foolish talk to - morrow,\" said Tukuaho as we came away. \" It was a good bolotu, only I am sorry that Fatafehi's words were so hot.\" As soon as we reached home the spies were set in"], [99, "MARY IN THE CONFESSIONAL. 79 motion to feel the pulse of the people after their dose of tonic.

The dreadful day had come, and one after another the men of the place slunk out to spread the dire* news among their comrades in distress. Plaudits and tears were alike suppressed: this was too serious a matter for ordinary demonstrations. A terrible and damning history fell from the lips of this penitent Phryne of the South Seas. \"When she had finished there was scarcely a man in the church, but the women sat and drank it all in, and many a household in Sawana dates its domestic troubles from that terrible bolotu when Mary \" told her soul.\" We began next day to reap the fruit of the seed scattered at the bolotu overnight. We were haunted by visitors. Our political opponents came in, each carrying in his hand the inevitable root of kava \u2014 for a Tongan making a visit of any ceremony would as soon forget his kava as an English lady her card-case under similar cir cumstances. They sat rubbing shoulders with the spies from whom we knew exactly how much their new-born friendship was Avorth. There was, moreover, a nervous hilarity about them that showed their sense of the awk wardness of their sudden change of front. At mid-day we summoned a meeting of the Govern ment officials in the wooden court-house. There were the judge, the police magistrate, and the pound-keeper, all malcontents ; a dozen policemen and jail - warders, be lieved to be the same ; the Treasury clerk, said to be loyal; and greater than all \u2014 the head jailer, Kaho, a dark horse whom it was important to win over.

His office, however, seemed to place him next to the Governor in importance, for he alone can have the ordering of other men's labour without paying for it \u2014 a distinction that carries weight in every community. Tukuaho told them how much he regretted that an empty Treasury had tied his hands, so that he could not yet pay them the nine months' salary due to them on Mr Baker's departure ; but he announced that from that day forward their salaries would be punctually remitted to them, and that the payment of the amount owing to them by his predecessor (he was not going to speak ill of the absent) would depend upon their own loyalty. The sooner they could induce their friends to pay their taxes, the sooner Avould they receive the arrears due to them. Next day the mail-steamer from New Zealand put in, after touching at Nukualofa. From the former place she brought Mr Baker's son \u2014 formerly his private secretary \u2014 carrying, for distribution among the natives, a bundle of lithographs of his father, subscribed \" The Premier ap pointed by Tubou \" ; and from the latter Mr Watkin, the chief minister of the Free Church, and the staunch ally of the late Premier, ostensibly to make church collec tions, but also, as it afterwards proved, to further unsettle the minds of his flock. At mid-day we set sail for Nukualofa. A chain of volcanoes traverses the Tongan group from north to south, and one or other of the craters is generally in a state of sufficient activity to be employed by one of the contend ing Church parties against the other.

But an eruption is public property, and I was told that Tofua was used by our own supporters to awe the opponents of \"the just-dealing Government \" into complacency. With the view of seeing the crater more closely we steered direct for Tofua, and were becalmed within two miles of the volcano long after sunset. The night was very dark, but every few minutes the dull glare of the crater was illuminated with a burst of flame, and masses of red-hot rock were projected into the air with deep reverberations. The crater Avas not more than 200 feet above the sea-level, and Avas close to the north shore of the island. I therefore tried to persuade the crew to take us into the deep strait that separates the island from the sugar-loaf cone of Kao. But they were frightened at the explosions, and flatly refused, urging that we should be becalmed on the lee side, and become a target for the missiles from the crater. It was useless to urge that the stones would not fall into the sea : they Avere obdurate, and we had reluctantly to steer southwards.

MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. The politics of Tonga are a never-ending struggle between the faikava and the fono. In the intervals of the solemn ceremony of kava-drinking the most outrageous scandal is talked, the most startling lies invented, \u2014 for kava loosens the tongue-strings without muddling the senses. AYere it less cheering and more inebriating it would be politically innocuous, for it is easier to govern a nation of drunkards than a people suffering from the diseased gar rulity born of the pepper-root. Kava is drunk in every village in Tonga at least once a-day. Beside the door post in every house lie the flat and the round pounding stones whitened Avith the dusty fibres ; and at each gathering, failing the moral character of an absent friend, politics, or church matters \u2014 which are so interlaced with politics that they are the more dangerous of the two \u2014 are the subject of conversation. To purify the air of the cloud of lies and miscomprehension that the failcaxas have discharged into it, periodical fonos are necessary. A fono is a compulsory meeting of the people to listen to the orders of some person in authority. Before Chris-"], [106, "86 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. tianity changed the face of the land the fono took the place of Avritten law. The matdbules, hereditary censors of public morals, summoned a fono to lecture the young chiefs whenever they had made a wider breach of the proprieties than their rank permitted. Nowadays its uses are various. In every village at six o'clock on Monday mornings there are fonos, at which the mayor reads out Government orders, and urges diligence on the defaulting taxpayers. There are Premier's fonos and king's fonos, the latter being very solemn functions, only adopted in cases of great national importance ; but in all fonos alike no discussion is allowed, and the people are only summoned to hear what those set in authority choose to tell them. The chief's orders of old were published abroad by the crier (fanongonongo), and this custom is revived when ever Government orders have to be proclaimed without the formality of a public meeting ; but this time-honoured method is not often resorted to on account of the inac curacy to which the human memory is subject. When Mr Baker promulgated his Wild Birds Protection Act, he instructed the criers to cry the preamble and a risumi of the Act \u2014 That whereas certain birds, particularly speci fied, were of public utility as the destroyers of Avorms, fleas, and other noxious insects, they were not to be killed on pain of heavy penalties. But the crier's version was : \" Hear me, all people. It is the command of the Govern ment \u2014 worms, fleas, and all creeping things are useful, so also are birds, therefore it is ordained that they shall not die ; whosoever shall kill any bug, or flea, or worm, or bird, or other such thing, shall be grievously punished.\" It is right to say that the Tongans received the order"], [107, "A MEETING OF THE MAYORS. 87 without surprise, for the protection of insects seemed to them quite as reasonable as the protection of birds, or indeed as any other of Mr Baker's statutes. On our return to Tongatabu we found the air surcharged with the gossip of the failcava. Two noblemen and the Government bandmaster, all disaffected for different rea sons, had filled the islands with a story that ran as follows : \" The Government was lying when it said that it was in want of money, for had not the Premier, when he opened the Treasury, found a bag containing a hun dred thousand sovereigns, and hidden them for the use of the Cabinet Ministers ? Was he not deceiving the people when he told them to pay their taxes, or their country would be ruined ? \" \" Mr Baker has gone to America, and has told the President what Britain has done, and he will come back in an American man-of-war to try the High Commissioner, and punish his enemies.\" \" A British official is in Tonga to pay Tukuaho for betray ing the country, and to arrange for annexation.\" It was plain that a fono must be held to cleanse the political atmosphere. My colleague did not dare to summon the entire island to a, fono without the express sanction of the king, so he determined to assemble the mayors from every village, knowing that they would carry an embroidered version of his speech to their constituents. Shortly after sun rise on the appointed day horsemen poured into the town, and tethered their horses outside the disused church at Pangai whither Ave were called to address them. As we entered the building at the pulpit end a policeman cried \" Koc Palemia,\" and the mayors rose and saluted"], [108, "88 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. with hands lifted above their heads. They were of every age \u2014 from the dressed-up monkey fresh from college, in black coat, trousers, and bare feet, proud in the possession of all human knowledge, to the grey-headed elder in the quiet dignity of the vala of native cloth. Tukuaho made a capital speech, denying emphatically the false reports that had been set about, and appealing to the patriotism of his hearers to get their taxes in and save their country from ruin. They must, he said, hold fonos, at which only those who were in arrears with their taxes should attend, and as each man completed his payments he should be relieved from further attendance. Then he called upon me for my maiden speech in Tongan, and I delivered myself of a string of platitudes about the independence of Tonga, and the desire of England to see her stand alone : that England did not want Tonga, having quite enough to do with the slice of the world she had already, to Avhicli Tonga was but a fly-blow on the map : that I had come at the king's request, not to meddle in their concerns, but to help them, and when they wanted help no longer I should go away. Then the spokesman fidgeted and asked leave to proffer a request. They were tired, he said, of talking to those who would not listen to them : would the Premier himself come and hold their fono ?\u25a0 After some discussion it was settled that we should hold a fono in each of the three great divisions of the island. News now came from Vavau that Mr Watkin and Mr Baker's son and former private secretary had between them contrived to stir up a hornet's nest. The boy, Avith the secrecy of a conspirator, had been distributing leaflets and photographs of his celebrated father, and the minister"], [109, "WARS AND RUMOURS OF WARS. 89 of peace had been talking war. My informant, the Wes leyan missionary, showed me a letter from one of his native colleagues which left no doubt upon the point. Mr George Brown, the energetic and able head of the mission, would have liked Mr Watkin to be allowed rope enough to hang himself, but as that would have involved the starvation of the Government, already reduced to inanition, I decided to \" belay.\" I was armed with a letter from the High Commissioner \u2014 to be given or with held as I thought fit \u2014 warning him in plain terms that abstention from politics was required of him. The time for using this letter had now come. There being a special reason for an interview for the purpose of adjusting the outstanding accounts between the Government and the Free Church, I invited him to meet me at the public offices, and asked C to be present and take notes of the conversation. The reverend gentleman was rather restless throughout the interview, and seemed particularly uncomfortable at seeing an unobtrusive figure busily writing columns of figures at the other table. Experience of his absent colleague's methods of diplomacy had taught him where traps were to be suspected. I kept him in conversation for some minutes upon matters affecting the welfare of the Church, and then he seized his hat, and Avould have beaten a precipitate retreat had I not stopped him, and handed him the letter. As he read it his face became cadaverous, and his hand trembled so that he could not have understood the words. I told him that there Avas a particular reason for giving him the letter at this moment, since he was reported to have been using the language of disaffection at Vavau, and, before he"], [110, "90 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARAr. could express the denial that rose to his lips, I read him a quotation from one of his sermons in which he talked of the injustice clone to the good Baker, and of fighting. I asked him whether to talk to natives of fighting was not likely to put the idea into their heads, if it was not there already. He said, \"When I said that I meant to warn them of doing anything so foolish ; and though I do sympathise with Mr Baker, there were many of his actions with which I did not at all agree.\" I then told him that the Government, with great reluctance, had re solved to take action against him unless he gave me a formal assurance that he would not only abstain from opposing them, but would also hold himself responsible for the actions and language of his subordinates ; and I added that we expected more from him than mere abstention \u2014 he must give us a loyal support. After some hesitation he promised to do all that lay in his power, and C took his words clown as he spoke them. He then said that there was one thing Avhich he Avanted very much to know \u2014 who had given me the information ? I told him that I did not doubt his curiosity, but that I had not the slightest intention of enlightening him. The man might have fared badly if his identity had been known. Whoe\\Ter he was, he was a good reporter. However difficult it may be to sympathise with a man Avho has betrayed his employers, I could not help pitying- Mr Watkin, who was made responsible for the actions of the most self-satisfied and insubordinate body of ecclesi astics in the world.

From this it is only a step to a new and original interpretation of the Scriptures, and to a bastard Christianity like the Hauhauism of the Maories and the Tuka of Fiji. Our three great fonos were a decided success. We rode first to Hihifo with an informal escort. of mounted police and clerks, not excepting the faithful spy, Peter. Tungi, being past the age and figure for equestrian exercise, travelled in an American buggy, which stuck fast every now and then in the deep mud caused by the rains, while we rode on at the untiring canter that is the easiest pace for Tongan ponies. Few of our escort had girths, and not all had saddles, but this did not seem to incommode them in the least. We reached Kolowai, the chief town, plas tered with mud, and halted under the celebrated colony of flying-foxes. They Avere a revolting sight. Four great banyan and ironwood trees shaded the road, and these were covered with the living fruit so thickly clustered that the branches drooped with their weight. Thousands upon thousands hung there from their hind-claws, sleep ing, crawling, squealing, quarrelling, stretching their uncanny sails, and scratching their light - brown heads with a winged claw. The leaves and the grass beneath the trees had long ago been killed by their unwholesome presence ; and the stench was so overpowering that we had to edge to windward. They are taibu \u2014 Heaven knows why, for they do immense damage to the plantations \u2014 and they are neA*er shot at. Formerly, it is said, they"], [112, "92 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. frequented some Toa-tvees near to the sea, but the great battle fought there in May 1799 frightened them aAvay, and they chose to emigrate to the large trees in the centre of the town. Ata told me that at sunset half go away to feed, while the others keep guard during their absence, but that they never fail to come back about midnight to take their turn of sentry -duty. Without vouching for this as a scientific fact, I can bear witness that they fly beyond Nukualofa, thirteen miles away, for hundreds of them were shot at nightfall as they flew in a continuous string towards the Government banana plantations near the lagoon. One thus brought down had a little one clinging to her body, bestirred and bewinged, a perfect miniature of its mother. In a feAV clays it became per fectly tame, and at night showed no inclination to leave the verandah where it hung in the daytime. The fono was held opposite Ata's house. Only tax payers were summoned, but they numbered several hun dreds, and included a few women \u2014 widows \u2014 holding tax allotments. They formed a compact semicircle, each bring ing a cocoa-nut-leaf to sit upon. On the outside of the ring a few policemen, armed Avith thick batons, stood erect in attitudes of stern attention. We, the authorities, sat in - a row in the verandah and addressed the crowd in turn, \u2014 Tukuaho in mood of suave conditional, I in bald indicative, and Ata, their chief, in uncompromising im perative.

Having lunched at the sacred enclosure of Kanokubolu, the scene of the massacre in 1800 in which the recreant missionary Vason took part, we rode off along the shore, leaving Tungi to water the seed we had sown. The meeting at Mua was a far more picturesque affair. Five or six hundred people were assembled in a wide circle, six deep, under the shade of the historical banyan trees beneath which Captain Cook sat when he witnessed the Great Inaji on the 17th June 1777.1 Acting on my colleague's advice, I gave some sensational instances of the squandering of money by our predecessor, and this part of my speech was listened to with breathless attention. As I told of the sums spent on cab-hire in Auckland, on boots and shoes, and on strong liquors, even Mr Baker's supporters looked discomfited. It was curious to note the alteration in Tukuaho's style when addressing his own people at Mua. Elsewhere his style was persuasive : here he took no trouble to give reasons or explanations. He simply asserted facts, and his people accepted them. He is a fine speaker, less polished in deliA-ery than his shrewd old father, Tungi, but more manly and open. The audi ence was enthusiastic \u2014 even old Nuku cried \" Malo ! \" as if he had forgotten that he was in disgrace. He had advised his people not to pay their taxes, an offence that would have landed him in jail if he had been less aristocratic ; but being a member of the Upper House, he could be threatened only with impeachment for conduct unbecom ing a Nobele. I watched him carefully at this meeting, and decided that he was mad, but not sufficiently so to be harmless, for he is an inveterate talker. When Tongan 1 See illustration on p. 317."], [114, "94 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. troubles were at their worst in 1886 Nuku held a fono, and thus addressed his people : \u2014 \" All the great nations of the earth have made treaties with Tonga. We have a treaty with Germany, a treaty of mutual love and respect. We have a treaty with France : this is for the mutual protection of religion. We have a treaty with America : this is to secure freedom of trade, so that a Tongan may go and sell things in America, just as an American may come and sell things in Tonga. And we have a treaty with Britain, but that is a very different thing : Tonga and Britain are like two cocks, each stand ing on his own dunghill, trying to raise his head above the other and crow him down ! \" The fono at Nukualofa was held at sunrise, and I was awakened by an excited policeman Avho came to say that chiefs and people were assembled and waiting for me. Launched hungry, sleepy, and uncomfortable upon an audience tired of waiting, I did not make a brilliant speech. By holding these fonos we had now done all that lay in our power to hasten the payment of taxes pending the arrival of the king from Vavau. We were in great straits for want of money, for we had undertaken to pay the salaries regularly from the day on which we assumed office, and hitherto not a penny of poll-tax had been taken at the windows. The Government was being carried on with the Customs dues alone, which, regular though they were, did not suffice to meet the current demands upon the Treasury, exclusive of salaries. But Ave could do no more, and it was high time to agree upon the line of policy to be pursued to promote unanimity among our-"], [115, "THE MINISTER OF POLICE. 95 selves. The two Cabinet Ministers, Kubu, the Minister of Police, and Josateki Tonga Veikune, the Paymaster, Asibeli Kubu, Minister of Po, now appointed Auditor-General in his absence, had re turned from their mission to Vavau and the Niuas to"], [116, "96 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. announce the change of Ministry. We therefore sum moned our first Cabinet Council. It was held in the Parliament House, a large wooden building furnished with pews and a long table. At one end was a faded crimson dais surmounted with the royal arms : here the king sits when he opens Parliament. We took our seats round the table, Tukuaho, as President, sitting at one end, and Mataka, with his shorthand note book, at the other. Let me describe my colleagues. Asibeli Kubu, the Minister of Police, is a short, dark little man of about thirty, with a stiff moustache, and erect rebellious black hair. He is full of restless energy, impulsive and boyish, full of loyalty to Tukuaho, and of devotion to his administration. His mother is Lavinia, who would be Tui Tonga fcfine if such dignities existed nowadays ; and his father is Inoke Fotu, a Judge of Vavau, a chief of the second rank. By his mother, therefore, Kubu is a great chief. He began his official career as a Police Magistrate under the Baker regime, and got himself into sad disgrace by not convicting to order. Being a creature of im pulse, and not endowed with cal culating tact, our Minister of Police is safer under discipline than when left to his own judg- Sateki. ment. To-day he is dressed in a suit of flannel pyjamas with quasi- military braid facings, his head is covered with au em broidered smoking-cap with a tassel, and his feet are bare Josateki, or Sateki as he is universally known, is a dis-"], [117, "97 THE LORD CHIEF-JUSTICE. ferent stamp of man. A chief of the third rank in Vavau, he was selected by Mr Baker as his Paymaster and As sistant Premier because of his implicit obedience to orders and his power of silence. In person he is erect and slim, with grizzled hair and beard, and fine features deeply wrinkled. He lives onlv for his work : lie is an official first and a man after wards, a A*ery rare quality for a native, to whom, as a rule, sustained purpose is unknown. We are not yet sure of Sateki. He is said to be hurt at my appointment as Assistant Premier, a post which, till now, he has nominally filled. If we once win him over we need not fear that he will desert us, but as he will not talk, and has never been known to laugh, he is difficult to conciliate. The Lord Chics-Justice Then there was Ahomee (day of dancing), the Lord Chief-Justice, a white-haired old gentleman, one of the first converts, and a great pillar of the Church in days gone by, but now very deaf of ear and dull of understand ing. The Minister of Finance, Junia Mafileo, the king's nephew, had not yet arrived, and Tukuaho, as President, G"], [118, "98 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. called upon Mataka to open the proceedings. The first business was to read a letter from Mr Campbell tendering his resignation as Assistant Minister of Finance because his chief does not come to his office, and no business can be transacted in the old gentleman's absence. The Lord Chief - Justice now fell asleep, and we passed to other matters while Air Goschen was being sent for. We had granted tea and sugar to the policemen on duty, and were deep in the discussion of the advantages of subsidising a mail service when he arrived. He is a careworn-looking old gentleman with very round eyes, classic features, and a beautiful set of false teeth, which in moments of excite ment snap to and remain obstinately closed. When this happens he continues his remarks over his upper jaw, with a hissing noise like an angry snake. His hair stands up in scanty grey bristles half an inch long all over his bullet head. Though the thermometer registers S5\u00b0, he is dressed in a thick double-breasted ulster, thrown open to display a checked Crimean shirt and trousers, and an enormous pair of lawn-tennis shoes. At the desire of the Premier I rise and read Campbell's letter of resignation. The Auditor-General pokes up the Chief-Justice, Avho, Avaking suddenly, under the impression that a motion is being put, holds his right hand aloft, and babbles of tea and sugar, the last question but one before the meeting. The Premier with due solemnity says that there is a grave accusation against the Minister of Finance. As all eyes are fixed upon the unconscious Goschen, it gradually dawns upon him that he is being attacked, and his round eyes gape in startled surprise. \" What is it ? \" he asks, blankly."], [119, "99 AN EMPTY OFFICIAL. \" You are to attend your office every clay,\" says Tungi with emphasis. Goschen springs to his feet in a state of frenzied emotion. \" I know,\" he cries, \" I have not been to my office for a week. And why . Because I am alone in the world. You talk of work ; well, I have been at work \u2014 my work is to fill my stomach\" (he clutches the organ in question with both hands). His eyes roll, i \u25a0 pi , i i i i :__i- _ _\u00ab(S his false snap, and them, \"I no sons, teeth shut with a __ he hisses over have no wife, no daughters. Who is to fill my stomach for me ? Why,\" he cried, as the whole pite ousness of the situation thrust itself upon him, \" it's empty now. Order me to do what you will and I will do it, but only feed me.\" He sat down choked with his impassioned burst of eloquence. The Premier suggested that a convict should be told off to catch fish for the Min- ister, and dig his yams. This was a straw to the drowning financier. \" Yes,\" he cried, \" give me a prisoner, two prisoners, or even three to feed me, but I think that it will want four : feed me, and I will sit in my office all day.\" It was eventually decided that Goschen should attend his office on alternate days, and"], [120, "100 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. upon this understanding Campbell withdrew his resigna tion. Goschen can scarcely write his own name, much less add up figures, but he is the king's nephew, and receives \u00a3120 a-year as Treasurer, and no money can be paid out of the Treasury except in his presence. One of the many weak features in the former adminis tration was Mr Baker's fear of dealing with Europeans. He had so wholesome a dread of consular intervention, that in the few cases in which he dared to prosecute a European in the courts the sentence was not carried into effect, and the natives were not slow in attributing this leniency to its true cause. The Constitution that declared all men equal in the eye of the law looked well enough on paper, but in practice they had come to believe that there was one law of Draconian severity for the Tongan, and another of timorous laxity for the white man. The judicial machinery in Tonga is not less complicated than it is in other little States which are allowed to keep their independence, although within the sphere of British influence. As native magistrates are liable to human error, subjects of the treaty Powers are exempted from their jurisdiction in civil suits and in offences recognised as felonies and misdemeanours by English law. In such cases British subjects are only amenable to the High Com missioner's Court, presided over by the Deputy Commis sioner in Tonga: Germans and Americans are theoreti cally amenable to the Consular Courts of those nations ; but as there is no competent authority within the group itself, and their representati\\*es in Samoa cannot find time to A'isit Tonga, they are virtually exempt from all penal-"], [121, "RESPECT FOR THE COURTS. 101 ties. For offences against the local laws of police, public health, customs, and taxation, foreigners are amenable to the Tongan courts, the Consul being duly notified to be present if he will ; and the subjects of all States having no treaty with Tonga may be tried by the Tongan courts without reference to any one. It Avas to provide for such cases that Mr Baker was about to import a European magistrate when he himself was deported. If the native courts were to be respected they must be reformed, and they must not be afraid to deal impar tially with foreigners. It happened that a Bussian Finn, named Holt, had brutally assaulted a German in an out lying village, where the two men were rival bakers. The case could not be trusted to a native magistrate without reducing the courts to a farce ; and as there was no one else available, I reluctantly had myself appointed Special Magistrate under an Act of Mr Baker that was still in force. Bather to my surprise, the defendant appeared to his summons ; the prosecutor was represented by amateur counsel, and there was a curious audience of traders and natives. Bloodstained clothes were produced and identi fied, and the evidence showed the feeling between the two men to be very bitter. The only defence was that the prosecutor \" had done it himself by running his head against a tree.\" Holt was fined \u00a310 or a month's imprisonment, and, as I expected, he chose to serve his time. Perhaps he thought that the native Government would not dare to carry out the sentence, but in this he was disappointed. I at once had a disused lock-up cleaned out and roughly furnished, and installed a white police man as jailer, with a contract to feed his prisoner accord-"], [122, "102 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. ing to scale at a fixed rate. The man was restive at first, and made dire threats of what he would do when he came out. He wrote to the Bussian Consul in Sydney to claim an indemnity, and received answer that the consular juris diction did not extend to Tonga. But he served his full month, and gave no more trouble. This imprisonment of a white man had the very best effect upon those natives Avho were inclined to trade upon the Aveakness of the new Government. I had only two other cases. A trader assaulted a native boy Avhose friends laid an information. I fined him 30s. or fourteen days' imprisonment in default. He raised no question of nationality until after the court rose, when he came to say that he was a naturalised American, and that I had therefore no jurisdiction over him. As he seemed a decent fellow enough, and likely to listen to reason, I pointed out that he was an Englishman by birth, and that he had no papers to prove his naturalisation : that unless he paid his fine I should certainly put him in jail : he would then, no doubt, appeal to his Consul in Samoa, who would call upon the Government for particulars : the copy of the evidence we should send would show that he had beaten a Tongan with very little provocation : the Consul would not, therefore, be likely to make a demand for indemnity in such a case, but if they did, the Government would of course pay it : by that time, however, he would have served his time in jail, which was a very uncomfortable sort of place, and full of moscpiitos. Did he think that all this was worth the 30s. ? Being a reasonable man he did not, and paid the money. My third and last case very nearly led to a breach with"], [123, "103 THE POLICE ARE JUSTLY SCANDALISED. my valued colleague, the Minister of Police. A white man was summoned by the police for not keeping the road in front of his leased land free from weeds. As there had been bitter complaints by the Europeans that the native magistrates would only listen to the police in such cases, I determined to test the prosecution by hearing the charge myself. The police mustered in force, headed by the Inisipckcta. The clerks of the court sat below me with their shorthand note-books. The accused, a German, was charged with having left a clump of weeds in the road two yards from his fence : three policemen swore to the size and position of the clump. The defendant pleaded that the so-called road was an impassable swamp, and that he had weeded the road on which the traffic went. The police, however, said that they had nothing to do with the traffic, nor with the marsh. The road used to skirt the fence, and it was therefore the road within the meaning of the Act. The case was dismissed, and the myrmidons of the law exchanged glances. A few hours later Tukuaho received an official letter from Kubu saying that he could not discharge his duties if the magistrates gave such deci sions ; that the police were much pained with the \" Ex pounder,\" and were threatening to resign. Tukuaho showed me the letter, begging me not to be angry, but to under stand that the police were a little dark-minded. I sent for Kubu and his Inisipeketa, and asked them to tell me their grievance, and I would answer it. They said that it was a new thing in Tonga for any man whom the police accused to be let off; that if this were done the people would respect them no more, and crimes would greatly in crease, to the shame and discomfiture of the Government."], [124, "104 MEETINGS ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY. Gently but firmly I explained to Kubu that if the police were always to obtain convictions, it was a waste of time to bring offenders before a magistrate ; that the police, if they would be worthy of their hire, should only bring accusations that they were sure of sustaining ; and then, when I had manured his mind for a new idea, I told him that to punish a man simply because the police accused him was \"contrary to the Constitution.\" At the magic word \" Konisitutone \" the Minister and his satellite gave Avay, utterly crushed. That they should have unwittingly fallen under the charge they had so often launched against Mr Baker overwhelmed them. \" Pardon us,\" said Kubu, with humility, \" what do we know ? We are dark-minded, Misa Tomisoni ; you must bear with us and teach us.\" I liar don ed him."], [125, "105 VIII. CONVICTS AND POLICE. There are times in life when one should be allowed four hands, two brains, and sustained insomnia. There was a great deal to do, and the sun, unmindful of the political importance of Tonga, would not stand still. I was threat ened with lawsuits by merchants in New Zealand, who wanted me to recognise ruinous verbal contracts alleged to haA*e been made with my predecessor ; the British Vice- Consul was remonstrating with me for demanding rent from a British subject who claimed the fee-simple of the land he occupied ; the courts were playing football with the law ; the police were trampling airily on the rights of private property ; the convicts walked the town with all the liberty and twice the assurance of free men ; and the Europeans had resuscitated the defunct Chamber of Com merce, and were for once united in a determination to embarrass the Government. The Treasury and Customs, it was true, were safe in the hands of my able second ; but Baker's accounts were crying to be audited, and if I were to relax my vigilance among my native colleagues, they were sure to fall out with me and with each other."], [126, "106 CONVICTS AND POLICE. And with all this we knew that our enemies were busy in Vavau trying to sow distrust of us in the mind of the king. Of all non-financial departments in the public service, the Prison Avas that which called first for reform. The jail was a wooden building fitted with tiny cells, so ill- A-entilated that to confine any person in them for many hours would be dangerous. In practice, only persons just arrested were confined there pending their trial : con victs were not confined at all. It was the most economi cal penal system in the world, for the convicts had to lodge, feed, and clothe themselves. A man sentenced to a fine of \u00a320 must work for the Government for 400 days (his daily task being valued at Is.) He might live at home, and work for the Government during the daytime : his sentence was counted by working days only, and did not include Sundays, nor clays too wet to allow of work. The same rule applied to convicts sentenced to penal servitude. An original sentence of two years would be lengthened by sickness or wet weather to nearly three years, for it meant 730 days' labour. He could take a few holidays here and there Avhen he pleased ; but if he absented himself for many clays in succession, he would receiA*e a domiciliary visit from the head jailer. If he had a horse and cart, the loan of it to the Government, when the steamer Avas in, would reduce the sentence at the rate of 4s. a-day. The prisoners were variously em ployed. Some were the household servants of the king and the Cabinet Ministers \u2014 my seat in the Cabinet en titled me to two ; others formed the crew of the Govern ment vessels ; others were stationed at the pilot station"], [127, "107 THE SOCIAL PRESTIGE OF CONVICTS. on an island in the bay ; but the majority lived upon the Government banana plantations. All alike were free to sleep where they pleased, and, if their homes were at a distance, were obliged to beg or steal their food. The female prisoners, who were generally in trouble for social offences, might be seen any day weeding the public squares ; while their brown babies, oblivious of the fact that they had no right to exist, rolled about in the shade of the nearest tree. As a natural consequence of such a system, there was not only no disgrace attaching to im prisonment, but, since the beginning of the Church quarrels, there was even a certain cdchct in being one of the goodly company of ministers of the Church and men of rank in trouble for their religious views. Let it not be supposed that so great a legislator as Mr Baker had forgotten to provide regulations for the control of his convicts. I discovered them by mere accident, for they were not published. As already related, the son of the late Premier had passed through the group distributing photographs of his estimable father. The day lie left Nukualofa, Ula, the head jailer, came to Tukuaho with a document in Tongan in the young man's handwriting, which may be translated as follows : \" I, Ula, do declare before God that I have never flogged a woman by the orders of Mr Baker.\" There was a date and a place for the signature and the seal, neither of which had been affixed. \" He sent twice to me to ask me to sign this,\" said Ula, \" but I would not. Then he came himself, and asked me to sign by the love that I bore his father, but still I would not, so he called me by bad names and went away in the steamer.\""], [128, "108 CONVICTS AND POLICE. \" And did you flog women by order of Mr Baker ? \" I asked. Ula fumbled in his waistband, and produced a tiny green-paper book, printed in Tongan, and pointed to the words, \" It shall be lawful to flog any prisoner guilty of unruly conduct.\" Then turning over the pages he showed me the signature at the foot, \" Misa Beika.\" They were the Prison Regulations, and I at once annexed them for future study. \" There is nothing there forbidding me to beat Avomen,\" continued Ula, \" so I beat them when they were unruly, and Mr Baker knew that I did and said nothing. It is not forbidden in our customs.\" It ap peared that the story of the women being flogged had been carried to Auckland by one of the ships-of-war, and the fallen Premier wanted to clear his character by an affidavit from a Tongan jailer. As the right to punish was \\*ested in the jailer, it was of course not used against those who had taken the pre caution of winning his faA'our. There was in fact no dis cipline, and the prisoners were fast becoming a source of public danger. Yet smooth as was the life of a Tongan malefactor, no Tongan likes work ; and since it was so easy to escape, it became fashionable to steal boats and set sail for Samoa or Fiji. There was a spice of adventure and danger about such an escape that exactly suits a Tongan. They suffered sometimes. Jope, who reached Lakemba in an open boat in 1886, would haA-e died of hunger in another twelve hours. Two men who sailed from Niuafoou were never again heard of. On the other hand, several such attempts were successful. The men who stole the Government"], [129, "109 THE GENTLEMEN OF THE JAIL. despatch-boat Beatrice have settled at Wallis Island, and those who escaped in the boat of the German firm from Vavau reached Samoa in safety. But for the extradition clause of the English treaty they would all have safely made Fiji with a fair wind, but they knew that from a British colony they would be sent back to be dealt with in a Tongan court. The German firm was now pressing a demand for compensation for the value of their stolen boat ; and an English storekeeper, from whom the prisoners had stolen their clothes, was arguing witli reason that a GoA'ernment that would not keep its prisoners under lock and key should be held responsible for the consequences of their acts. It was high time to introduce prison reform, if I could find a prison. The houses built for the labourers introduced by Baker to work the Government plantations were still standing, and could be made prisoner-proof pending the erection of a proper jail, for which I had plans prepared. One of the long buildings would do for the men and the other for the women, while the warder could live in the small house between the two. I hunted up a lot of iron bars, and set the native carpenters to sink them into the window frames. Then I drafted Prison Begulations of the usual kind, and passed them through the Cabinet under the authority of one of the existing laws. As soon as they had been printed in the native press, a day was appointed when, to their intense indignation, the gentlemen of the jail were made to bow their heads to the scissors, and, worse indignity still, were locked up at night. Even the Cabinet was aghast at the boldness of this step. The prisoners vowed vengeance. Tonga under such circum-"], [130, "110 CONVICTS AND POLICE. stances was not to be endured : the Government must either be turned out, or the prisoners must seize the Gov ernment vessels and escape to Samoa. For a time \u2014 strange though it sounds \u2014 the prisoners proved themselves to be an influential body of men, and actually embarrassed the Government by appealing to the sympathy of their friends. Their confinement at night was thought to be a despotic exercise of power, and the compulsory hair- A card-party in the jail. cutting little short of a barbarity. For several days the prisoners appeared in hats, and as this marked them from other people, and also kept the sun off their heads, they were not interfered with. The only precaution we thought it necessary to take was to arm the night warder and the masters of the Government vessels. One evening a few weeks later I strolled towards the jail, whence most unpenitential sounds of merriment had been reported. The men's ward and the Avarder's cottage"], [131, "A CARD-PARTY IN PRISON. 111 were in darkness, but a blaze of light streamed from the windows of the female ward. I thought I caught the muffled ring of kava-stones, and \u2014 oh, horror ! \u2014 the sound of masculine laughter. Kubu, my companion, vowing A'engeauce against the unsuspecting warder, led me towards the window. There were two kerosene-lamps on the floor, a female prisoner Avas pounding kava, while the other prisoners of both sexes were squatting in a circle watch ing a game of euchre between the warder and a house breaker, each with a good-looking partner from the female ward. I left Kubu to break in upon this pleasant little party, and I heard next day that the warder had retired into pri\\*ate life. Not long after this two prisoners, who formed the crew of the Government ketch Kumeti, took the opportunity of seizing the Government despatch-boat Alice while her police crew and their own warder were making a night of it on shore. They guarded against pursuit by taking with them the gear belonging to the Kumeti. Beaching Samoa, they stranded the boat, and joined the settlement of Tongans on Upolu. We had no extradition treaty with Samoa. The bickerings between the three Powers were slaked for the moment by the Treaty of Berlin, under which brilliant effort of statecraft a Consular Board, a Municipal Council, a Lands Commission, and a Swedish Chief-Justice had been sent to fight the quarrel out upon the spot. But Malietoa was king, and to Malietoa I applied for the recovery of the boat and the prisoners. I chose the smart embossed paper headed \"Ministry for Foreign Affairs,\" and wrote in the king's name to request his royal brother to arrest the runaways, and to send back the boat."], [132, "112 CONVICTS AND POLICE. In due course I received an answer, written by the king's native secretary in excellent English, saying that the men had been arrested but had broken loose again. A month later, however, they were rearrested very cleverly, and landed with the stolen boat at Nukualofa, where they received in the Supreme Court a sentence likely to deter others from similar attempts. With them came a second letter from King Malietoa, enclosing his account for ex penses \u2014 \u00a33, 15s. \u2014 and a polite intimation that he was obliged to make this charge, owing to the unsettled state of his Government ; but that in a few months, when he had had time to organise his staff, he would be Arery glad to do such small services for his brother's Government for nothing. We heard afterwards that at that time he had no police at all, but that he had offered a reward for the capture, and a number of big Samoans had gone man hunting until the runaways were caught. The whole transaction was probably illegal, but it was morally justi fiable, and not more irregular than most other movements of public affairs in Samoa at the time. The police also had so fine a disregard for legal forms that they were becoming a source of embarrassment. They were cursed with an excess of zeal bred of ambition. They were classed in three ranks \u2014 the Inisipeketa (Inspec tor) Avith a salary of \u00a330, the polisi (policeman) with \u00a320, and the kateta (cadet) with \u00a310 a-year. Kubu had hit upon the happy idea of letting promotion depend upon individual activity, as shown by the number of prosecu tions instituted by each man. Just as even the best of Christians does not pass a single day without committing some sin, so must a Tongan be morbidly law-abiding who"], [133, "113 HOAV TO EARN PROMOTION. can lie clown at night without having been entangled in the meshes of Air Baker's code by sins of omission or commission. An ambitious kateta had only to note a hole in the road, or a few dead leaves in the town square, or to peer through the trans parent reed walls of a private house at illicit card-playing after ten o'clock curfew, to have ground for laying an information. If he wanted excitement, he might chase one of the numerous stray horses and pigs, and lead it in triumph to the pound ; or, if all these failed, he need only lie in wait at dusk on the road leading to the planta tions for some heedless wretch returning home with his shirt over his arm, to secure a conviction for indecent exposure of the person. If he had a taste for gossip \u2014 and what Tongan has not ? \u2014 he might forestall his own Inisipekcta by hunting down a flirtation, and haling the delinquents n"], [134, "114 CONVICTS AND POLICE. before the grim tribunal ; but this, being the special sphere of his superior officer, was dangerous ground. The eighteen policemen of Nukualofa Avere divided into three \" classes \" (kalasi). Each class was on duty in the police-station for seven days ; during the following week they rode about the island picking up from the mayors and village constables materials on which to found charges in the police court ; but for the third week they were off duty, and were free to attend to their food-plantations. The Inspector and his assistant took it in turns to be on duty at the station to receive reports. Each policeman was expected to find his own horse, but the Government supplied him with a saddle. He had also to provide his own rations, except during the week he was on duty, when he had the run of a tin of biscuits. The station Avas a ruinous little building, containing two rooms and a row of ill- ventilated cells. One of Kubu's first acts was to dismantle a number of these cells to make bunks, in which one or two policemen might always be found asleep, while the rest sat on the floor pounding kava. They had no regular beats, and besides attending court and execut ing distress warrants, their principal occupation seemed to consist in carrying messages for the Cabinet Ministers, who summoned them for the purpose by an electric bell that connected the station with the Premier's office. Besides the native police there was one white constable, Avho for \u00a350 a-year was content to obey the orders of his native superiors. He was an assiduous officer when sober, and even at other times he could not be described as inactive, if hoisting the American flag of a Sunday afternoon, and fighting any of his colleagues who tried"], [135, "THE DISADVANTAGES OF \" ZEALOUS OFFICERS.\" 115 to haul it down, may be held to establish a claim to energy. As promotion depended upon the quantity rather than the quality of the prosecutions instituted by the police, they naturally chose those that entailed the least amount of labour. Thefts are troublesome to unravel, therefore thieves were wisely let alone in favour of luckless wights guilty of wearing turbans, or of not wearing girdles within the town, or of failing to dismount in the presence of a member of the House of Lords ; for though the penalty for these offences was only one dollar, yet the convictions would all count for promotion. Less simple, but more in teresting, were the prosecutions for flirting ; and although the glory of conviction would redound to the sole credit of the Inisipekcta, yet the policeman who worked up the case had the reward of every good man who fearlessly does his duty. The mistaken zeal of these assiduous officers was pro voking loud murmurs against us. Their little fingers, it was said, were thicker than their predecessors' loins, and I was accused of having destroyed the last lingering re spect for a white man in the mind of the Tongan police man \u2014 a respect which even Air Baker had been at pains to preserve. They pounced upon horses tethered in the road by their European owners and took them in triumph to the pound : under the late Administration the police left Avhite men's horses unmolested. They even built a pound for pigs, and initiated it by the imprisonment of Air L 's sow, thus bringing upon me several consular remonstrances headed \"Be L 's sow.\" They trampled under foot the sanctity of private property by pursuing"], [136, "116 CONVICTS AND POLICE. stray cattle into private enclosures ; and \u2014 last indignity of all \u2014 they made the Consul's servant take his turban off, and threatened to prosecute him for wearing it. This last piece of effrontery precipitated the crisis, and I lost no time in providing Kubu with a hastily drafted code of Police Begulations for submission to the Cabinet. They set forth the offences which the police should prosecute, and those which should be left to the injured party, and among the latter class I included flirting, which I con sidered to be a matter for the relations of the offenders rather than for the police. Kubu and Tukuaho both agreed with me ; Tungi and Sateki were doubtful, think ing it a dangerous innovation. The Chief-Justice did not understand the question, and therefore A*oted with us ; and the Afinister of Finance was far away in some fiscal prob lem, or deep in the difficulties of his domestic commis sariat, and did not A*ote. So the Begulations were passed and printed. The police took them cheerfully until they understood that they were to be debarred from prosecu tions for philandering. When this was explained to them, a deputation, consisting of the Inisipckda and Peter Yi, \u2014 whose enterprise as spy had won him his heart's desire, the post of Assistant Inspector, \u2014 waited respectfully upon Tukuaho as representatives of their body. They said that when they first read the clause they supposed it to be a mistake, but the Minister had undeceived them. If these Begulations became law their occupation would be gone. Thefts ? Why, there were but few thefts, and they were all past finding out, being of A*arious kinds ; whereas flirta tions were many and easily fathomable, since their nature"], [137, "117 FLIRTING A FELONY. did not vary. But we were obdurate. The law did not make the police moral censors, nor was it so written in the Constitution. The awful word \"Konisitutone\" silenced argument, and the question was shelved until the meeting of Parliament, when, as I shall presently relate, Ave were worsted."], [138, "118 IX. A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. Mutual confidence has so far decayed in this cynical age that the financial powers of statesmen are usually limited to the disbursement of the money voted to them by the Legislature, while even this limited authority is subjected to the rigid scrutiny of an uncompromising auditor. But Air Baker saw the ignoble suspicion that such a system implied. He said to King George, \" Trust me not at all, or all in all,\" and thenceforth voted his own supplies, kept his own Treasury, and was his own auditor, \u2014 a com bination of offices that reflects equal credit upon the in tellect that devised it and the high-minded confidence of the people who suffered it to be. But what public character escapes the self-debasing slings of calumny ? There were many who dared to throw doubts upon this arrangement, and to ask how the Hon ourable and Reverend Shirley Waldemar Baker so far transcended his fellow-men as to be exempted from the audit to which other Alinistries are subject. It showed a mean and grovelling spirit; but the hydra-headed body called the public is composed for the most part of mean"], [139, "THE ANNUAL AUDIT. 119 and grovelling spirits, Avho pay their taxes without en thusiasm, and persist in regarding their rulers as men of like passions with themselves. So wise a man as the ex-Premier was not ignorant of the fact that public con fidence was worth maintaining, even by pandering to the lower wants of his constituents, and he gave them the independent audit they sighed for. He selected as audi tors a doctor, since deceased, an ease-lo\\*ing soul, who chose life in Tonga because it was far from the irksome conventionalities of an effete ch'ilisation, and the manager of the German firm \u2014 both unconnected with his detractors, and above the suspicion of partiality for himself. On the appointed day the books, and as many of the receipts as could be found, were laid before the two auditors, Avho added up the totals, and ticked off the receipts against the corresponding entries in the ledger. Then they asked for more receipts, and the Premier's office was ransacked without complete success for documents that had been mislaid. The audit dinner followed \u2014 a A*ery sumptuous repast, if the viands bore any analogy to the wine merchant's bill, \u2014 the audit certificate was signed, and forthwith printed and published to the censorious world. The auditors conceived that their business began and ended with the books. If the money spent was all accounted for, it was not their affair to ask the Premier whence he derived authority for building a railway, for whom a cargo of strong liquors Avas intended, or why his club subscription should be paid from public funds. They Avere called in as accountants to audit certain books, not to ask irrelevant questions. They had perforce to accept the statement of the books as to the amount of revenue,"], [140, "120 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. because Air Baker said they were correct, and there was no means of checking a calculation that was arrived at by the ingenious yet simple method of counting the balance of coin in the safe at the end of the year, and adding it to the expenditure. This, by the way, is the best of all methods for ascertaining one's income, because the sum must come out right. Once a-year the Premier published a financial statement, but with this the auditors had nothing to do, and one must reluctantly confess that it was received by the world with cold suspicion. I have already related that the fallen statesman was very anxious to take away some of his account-books. Not long after my arrival in Tonga he had written offici ally to demand them, and to challenge the right of an auditor to examine accounts which (he was pleased to say) had received the approval of Parliament ; adding that if any adverse criticisms were made upon his financial transactions, he would demand an independent audit of his own. He was indeed so hyper-sensitive upon the subject of this threatened audit, that we felt a pardonable anxiety to lose no time in setting to work. One glance at the disorder of the books and papers sufficed to convince me that I could not hope to make a complete audit for months to come, and I therefore wrote to the High Commissioner to ask him for the services of an accountant from the Colonial Govern ment of Fiji. The return steamer brought Air Forth, the present Auditor of that colony. He was allowed a fortnight only in which to attack his difficult task, and, considering the confusion and deficient information with which he had to contend, he made remarkable progress."], [141, "THE \"TREASURY ORDERS.\" 121 Some time was lost in attempting to begin at the date of Air Baker's dismissal and work backwards ; but with the discovery that many of the vouchers were missing, and that there was no means of ascertaining the exact amount of revenue, we abandoned hope of making a complete audit of the past year, and contented ourselves with a scrutiny of the payments we knew to have been made. But before examining the books for which an audit cer tificate had been published, I applied to Herr T- , the only surviving auditor, for permission to publish a criti cism of these accounts, a request to which he very kindly acceded. The financial system is worth describing. There was a head-treasury at Nukualofa, and sub-treasuries at Haapai, Vavau, and the two Niuas. The native revenue-collectors were required to pay in their weekly receipts to the sub treasurer, who kept with intermittent exactitude elaborate books ruled in columns for every conceivable head of receipt. When sufficient time had been allowed for ac cumulation the Premier made a descent upon the sub treasuries, and carried oft' the money to Nukualofa, amid the murmurs of the men of Haapai and Vavau, who thought that the money should be spent in their own island. When the bags of silver reached the head-treasury, Tubo, the chief clerk, patiently counted it over, entered it in his books as revenue from Haapai or Vavau, as the case might be, and put it into his safe for the liquidation of \" Treas ury Orders.\" These \" Treasury Orders \" were a financial triumph of which any Chancellor of the Exchequer might be proud. When salaries or accounts became clue the \" Paymaster \" drew a cheque upon the Treasury,"], [142, "122 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. which, when countersigned by Air Baker as Auditor- General, became virtually a floating paper currency until redeemed by presentation at the head-treasury. Let us trace the career of one of these \" Treasury Orders \" now before me. It was drawn on January 7, 1889, in favour of Sekonaia Tuuhetoka for 27 dollars, probably a quarter's rent of one of the leases in Haapai, since it is indorsed \" Department of Leases.\" It bears Air Baker's signature lithographed, besides Sateki's name as Minisita Peimasita (Alinister Paymaster), and S. E. AY. Baker's as clerk to the Premier. Tuuhetoka has long ago forestalled this money at the nearest store, and he hands over the \"Treasury Order\" towards the reduction of his score, in the hope that it may so far soften the heart of the merchant as to procure fresh credit for him. In Alarch the storekeeper buys a cartload of copra from a native, and tenders Tuuhetoka's \" Treasury Order \" in payment ; and a week later the man hands it to the tax clerk in settlement of his poll-tax, now two years in arrear. It is written in the law that the sub-treasurers shall not cash \" Treasury Orders,\" but it is nowhere for bidden to receive them as reA'euue. So the clerk gives him a receipt in full for his taxes, and the revenue-books show the country to be 27 dollars richer for the worthless paper which has never been debited as expenditure. Then the Premier's descent upon the sub-treasury is made, and the \" Treasury Order \" finishes its mendacious career in the wastepaper-basket in Nukualofa. Sometimes a \" Treasury Order,\" eight years old, was presented for pay ment, grimy and frayed from wandering from hand to hand in some distant island, but the finances were con ducted on too large a scale to be disturbed by such trifles."], [143, "THE CRAMPING EFFECT OF BUDGETS. 123 The salary or rent due for 1881 was paid in 1889, and no one but the auditors \u2014 who were not expected to worry about such minuti\u00e6 \u2014 could be one whit the worse. The \" Treasury Orders \" served their purpose, however. Printed in Tongan, and countersigned by Sateki, they kept the natives from asking inconvenient questions, and left the Premier free to indulge his overmastering appetite for spending money. The Customs duties and rents were paid by Europeans in cheques upon Australian and New Zealand banks, and these, being beyond the ken of Ton gans, Avere handed over to Air Baker to be paid into an account in the Union Bank in Auckland, of which he had the absolute control. To clothe this position with a sort of authority, he kept two sets of books, \u2014 the one labelled Agent-General, and the other Auditor-General, \u2014 hoping probably to suggest the inference that the Auditor kept a suspicious check upon the Agent. But the Auditor- General seems to have been an easy-going, pliant sort of official, who hated to make himself disagreeable, and contented himself with keeping his books on a plan of his own, which \u2014 so great was the sympathy that existed between the two officers \u2014 proved to be identical with that adopted by his methodical colleague. Estimates were made for groA*elling spirits. They are a useful check upon incompetent rulers, but a blighting drag upon the soaring genius of a dictator. The Constitution, it is true, says \u2014 ISTor shall any money be paid out of the Government Treasury or debts contracted by the Government but as shall be arranged by the Legislative Assembly excepting in cases of war or rebel lion or fearful epidemic or a like calamity and in such case it"], [144, "124 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. shall be done with the consent of the Cabinet and the King shall call together at once the Legislative Assembly and the Treasurer shall give the reason why that money was expended and the amount (sic). The Legislative Assembly had not \" arranged \" that the Agent-General should have the spending of some \u00a36000 a-year at will, nor did a \" war ... or like calamity \" warrant him in breaking the Constitution ; but he must be held blameless, for we read \u2014 The Treasurer shall not permit any moneys to be paid out of the Treasury on any consideration whatever excepting in cash ing \" Treasury Orders \" of the Tongan Government duly signed by the Paymaster and the Auditor-General. So poor old Goschen was responsible, and upon his grey head would the blow fall if Farliament ever demanded a reckoning. There was a pathos about Goschen's position in the matter. Besponsible for public moneys, solemnly required by the Constitution to submit a financial report to Parliament accounting for the last penny, liable to im peachment and other unknown terrors if he were found wanting, he sat placidly upon the hidden mine, agitated only by anxiety as to whether the cravings of his physical nature would be satisfied. But who would have thought of blaming Goschen ? He himself had severer views as to his responsibilities than had his colleagues. He had never read the Constitution \u2014 his education had been neglected in early youth \u2014 and he believed that the duties of a self respecting Alinister of Finance began and ended with the guardianship of the key of the safe, which, as he could trust no other with so precious a charge, hung round his"], [145, "HOW THE KEY AVAS LOST. 125 neck by a shoe - lace. Had Goschen been a less con scientious person, the business of the country could have been continued even while he was providing for his appetite ; but since no money could be paid out with out the key of the safe, his frequent absences from the Treasury had called forth those remon strances from his col- leagues which I have al ready related. Now Gos chen had a passion beyond the mere satisfaction of his grosser appetites. He was the professor of a dying art. At low tide his lone figure might be seen at the outer edge of the reef in sharp silhouette against the blue water, his vala girded up, his hand-net balanced on his forearm, lifting his skinny legs high, and sinking his feet into the"], [146, "126 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. knee-deep water without making a ripple as he crept upon his prey. He would poise his body as he watched the man\u0153uvres of a shoal of little fish, his right arm would be cautiously drawn back, and would presently dart out like lightning, cunningly flinging the small net in a circle round the shoal. Then, with incredible agility, he would leap upon the net, and transfer the entangled prey to the fish -basket hanging from his shoulder. The clay came when, after an almost miracu lous haul had demanded special effort from his age stiffened limbs, he felt at his neck for the precious key and found that it was missing. The string had snapt as he flung the net, and the key lay buried under a foot of water. He felt about for it with his toes ; he lay face downwards in the water with his nose upon the coral, and crawled about with eyes wide open. Four hours later, when the reef was dry, he made a further unavailing search with his convict servants. Then he came to make his confession. His colleagues indulged in no A'ulgar re crimination. They had expected it, and their annoyance was tempered with the reflection that the loss of the key would be a full and adequate excuse for closing the Treas ury for a time, and for thus allowing funds to accumulate. Goschen was sternly commanded to make further search, and a bunch of old duplicate keys from the Premier's office were tried one by one. A week passed during which Goschen daily scoured the reef at low tide, and the Pre mier's office Avas ransacked for a duplicate. The situation began to look serious. A month's salaries were clue, and our creditors were becoming importunate. A locksmith must be sent for from New Zealand or the iron doors be"], [147, "\"BY SPECIAL VOTE.\" 127 burst open. At last, dusty and rust-eaten, in the corner of a drawer a key was found which, when oiled and cleaned, proved to be the duplicate. The Treasury was reopened, and the news spread among the hungry creditors, who formed a continuous stream to and from the building for two days before their claims could be satisfied. But no one thought of telling Goschen. One clay, after the Treas ury had been open for a week, and the episode of the lost key had been almost forgotten, the old man sat down beside me in the Council-room. His anxieties had added another wrinkle to his furrowed brow, and he longed for a sympa thetic ear. \" What shall we do ? \" he said. \" I am dead of looking for the key. It is now clear that it is lost. How would it be to break open the doors ? \" I felt the glow that must have warmed the heart of the pitiful Samaritan, as I told him that his office had been open for at least a week, and watched the smile of deep relief smooth out his harassed features. \" Malo ! \" he said, \" they never told me ; \" and he shuffled off to resume control of the finances of the country. But my admiration for the patient Goschen has led me into a digression. I must return to his fallen chief. When deep in empirical research into the abstruse science of book-keeping \u2014 in which an Auditor-General cannot seek instruction without a loss of public confi dence and dignity \u2014 one can imagine with what satisfac tion the many-sided statesman penned the words \" By special vote of the Legislative Assembly ; \" \" By vote of the Privy Council.\" While the issue of the year's finances lay hidden in the womb of the future, in the midst of uneasy doubt whether there would be cash enough in the"], [148, "128 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. safe to pay the serried array of bills, how that ray of order and regularity must have soothed the faint twinges of a seared conscience ! If the words comforted him as he stifled the remembrance of his own Constitution, who will quarrel with him for writing them ? The obsequious Par liament would have voted the money had they been asked. But to ask them involved a loss of time and prestige, and detailed explanations, abhorrent to any right-minded dic tator, would then have become necessary. If all the bills before Legislatures were to be actually read through three times, parliamentary business would be even more dilatory than it is ; and if bills may be taken as read, why may not money be taken as voted ? This must have been the Auditor-Premier's reflection as he ornamented his ledger Avith the soothing phrase ; while the Hansard of the Legis lative Assembly bore silent witness to the absence of all money A'otes but life-pensions to Air Baker's children and a doctor's salary. AVhen the fateful clay for balancing the books came round, the poor Auditor- General must have discovered that, besides his revenue and expenditure, he had a tcr tium quid to reckon with \u2014 a mysterious balance one way or the other that could no more be absorbed than the waste products of an abortive chemical experiment. One of his predecessors in the chair of the AVesleyan mission, a most estimable man, used to be troubled with the same difficulty when he presented his accounts to his district meeting. But he never allowed the fact that his credit and debit columns failed to balance by \u00a35 to ruffle him. \" You have only to subtract \u00a32, 10s. from this column and add it to the other, and the two will be the same,\""], [149, "129 QUEER PUBLIC EXPENSES. he would say with mild triumph. Whether Air Baker had sat at the feet of this elder of the Church, or had arrived at the same discovery by an independent chain of reasoning, concerns us not : that he had devised such a process for the absorption of the tertium quid may be gathered from a naive letter of his clerk and accountant, Air 0. Lahnstein, dated the 13th of August 1889: \"The differences of S700 and !?250 have to be taken out of the books. The easiest way would be by alteration, as the books have not been added up with ink.\" It must have been a very pretty piece of financial jugglery this absorp tion of the tertium quid among the columns that had not been added up with ink. AVhen the books were at last balanced, and the fleeting figures caught and fixed with pen and ink, the Annual Statement of Accounts was prepared for publication. There was a haziness of outline about this that invited scrutiny. Items such as \" Police uniforms, hardware, parliamentary expenses, tanks, medicine, building mate rials, lime, &c., \u00a3769, 6s. 2d.,\" flung together in hetero geneous incongruity, provoked speculation as to what the \" et-cetera \" might comprise ; and when the vouchers dis closed the fact that groceries (\u00a335, 19s. 2d.), Air Baker's subscription to the Northern Club, Auckland, his son's cab, tram, and boat hire (\u00a346), and boots and shoes (\u00a32, 9s. 9d.) were included, it was felt that the search had not been in vain. A wicked curiosity prompted us to write to the fallen Alinister to inquire whether his club sub scription had not been charged to the Government in error; but if we hoped to abash him, we were much mistaken. He had the honour to inform us that the i"], [150, "130 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. payment had been approved by his Majesty in Council. The minute-book was silent on the point, and the em phatic disclaimer of the king and his Ministers has plunged the question in a doubt from which I shall not attempt to extricate it. The \u00a346 spent in cab-hire by the ex-Premier's sou could not be impugned, for certain offi cial despatches, written by the son in the family dining room to his father in the study, beginning and ending, \" Sir, I have the honour,\" showed that the rather stolid youth had spent much of this money in peripatetic di plomacy. He had called upon the British Admiral and a Colonial Minister to discuss the question of national defence and the purchase of ordnance ; and his tolerant reception by these dignitaries seems to have turned his head. Even at the Auckland prices \u00a346 would provide a vast number of jaunts, sweetened no doubt by the re flection that they were at the public expense. Possibly the \u00a32, 9s. 9d., paid for boots and shoes on the authority of Air Baker, junior, as Public Officer, was charged to the Treasury to cover the expenditure of shoe-leather in cross ing the curbstone to the cabs. An absentee First Minister was an expensive luxury to the Tongans. In 1889 it cost the country \u00a3171 to provide steamboat passages for him in his frequent trips to Auck land.

Had this ex-missionary reverted to the methods of medieval Italian republics to choke opposition ? and dared he flaunt his infamy in the pages of his Government ' Gazette,' proclaiming with cynical insolence the exact price to a penny at which he valued human life ? But an examination of the voucher brought relief not unmixed with bewilderment. It was headed \"Assassination,\" but the money had been paid to an Auckland coachbuilder for the entire renovation, on the most expensive scale, of the Premier's private carriage. I tried honestly to dis cover by what process of reasoning the repair of a private carriage at public expense could be classed as Assassina tion. At last a light broke in upon me. Air Baker had been dirving when he was shot at three years before, and a bullet had struck the splash-board of his carriage. He had always spoken of the attempt on his life as \" the Assassination,\" and he was now soothing his conscience for repairing the ravages of time at public expense in the same way as when he wrote \" By special vote of the Legis lative Assembly \" in his account-books.1 The last item in the statement \u2014 \" Extraordinary ex pense, \u00a362, 7s. 9d.\" \u2014 included the cost of an enlarged photograph of Air Baker, besides some other mysterious payments which we were willing to believe deserved the classification given to them, although we could never discoA-er their nature. In the ledger we found the entry, \" Loan Account, 1 I have been told that Mr Baker munificently presented this carriage to the king."], [152, "132 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. \u00a31085.\" Sateki, the Paymaster, enlightened us. The Free Church was about to hold its annual collection. The enthusiasm had been wrought by soul-stirring sermons to the pitch when a Tongan will strip the coat from his back, and fling it into the basin to win one more shout of applause ; but it chanced that money was tight, there Avas no copra, and the Civil servants all had debts at the stores. Air Baker had surmounted such difficulties before when he was a missionary, and he was not to be beaten now that he was 1'rime Alinister as well. He advanced their salaries on the eve of the collection, and stopped the loans out of their pay as it became due. As none of them seem to have died or to have been dismissed before they had had time to earn the amount of their advances, the Government lost nothing but the interest. The financial relations between the Government and the Free Church had been an inexhaustible theme for the Opposition, and there was some disappointment among the mission party that our revelations were not more startling. There was indeed nothing to reveal, for the only record of these transactions was contained in a few sheets of loose foolscap, evidently compiled from memory within the last few months ; for although the transactions had extended over a period of five years, none of the entries were dated. Air AVatkin, the President of the Free Church, assured me that he knew nothing about the state of the account, and in this respect he was probably no more ignorant than his wily colleague. The Treasury seems to have acted as banker to the Free Church, and to have imported at public cost whatever goods were required by the Conference, who paid over money on account from time to time as the"], [153, "WEIGHED AND FOUND WANTING. 100 Loo takings of the collection-plate permitted. The account was never adjusted, but the Government is said to have advanced \u00a35177, and to have received \u00a35065, lea\\7ing a balance of \u00a3112 still due. When asked to pay this, Air Watkin, who appeared relieved at getting off' so easily, only asked for time. The Free Church had been living beyond its means. It was hopeless to verify undated transactions five years old, but one strange entry provoked my curiosity. Among the Government disbursements I read, \" Loss of mission copra, against \u2014 \u00a3167, Is. 5d.\" In 1889 the Free Church collections were paid in copra, which the Government bought and stored in their sheds, crediting the Free Church with \u00a31289, 9s. 3d., the estimated quan tity being 120 tons or more. When, however, this copra Avas sold by the Government and weighed out to the purchaser, it proved to be so much less than the reputed quantity, that the loss could only be accounted for on the theory of fraudulent weighing by the native who received the contribution. Instead of charging the loss to the Free Church, the Government complacently con sented to bear it. In a burst of loyalty to his royal master the ex-Premier had, during the closing months of 1886, inaugurated a sub scription for a statue of King George, to be executed by an Italian artist, and erected in the centre of the Malaekula, the public square of Nukualofa. Aloney flowed in rapidly. The High Commissioner headed the list, and scarcely a European or native in the group failed to give accord ing to his means. Sateki, as trustee, took charge of the money, and the Premier was commissioned to order the"], [154, "134 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. statue. Four years passed away, during which the curious learned that an artist in Italy was carving the marble at the very moment of the inquiry. But this picture of the patient Italian artist failed to satisfy the subscribers, and I was entreated to track the sealed bag of silver, last seen in the hand of Sateki, and to set the question of its fate beyond a doubt. Sateki re membered the occurrence perfectly. He had given the bag to the Treasury clerk for custody in the safe. That was all he knew. It was the last clerk but one \u2014 he who was dismissed for embezzlement. I waded through the incoherencies of the Treasury book till I found the entry I Avanted, \" Bevenue from the Paymaster \u2014 \u00a31299, 13s. 6d.,\" \u2014 the exact amount of the subscriptions \u2014 used for purposes of general expenditure. Let us char itably suppose that the purchase of a statue was really intended, and that, when the Premier published the financial statement in which this sum figured as revenue, the clivers cares of office had chased the recollection of its purpose from his mind. Among the disbursements for the past year was the following : \u2014 Julian Thomas Printing \u00a350 0 0 37 10 0 A peripatetic journalist, writing under the pseudonym of \" The Vagabond,\" had passed through Tonga during the previous year, stopping some six hours in Nukualofa, and about half that time in Haapai and Vavau.

In a style founded upon that of Air Pomponius Ego, the correspondent immortalised by Air Jorrocks, he chatters unblushingly of personal ad ventures in every quarter of the globe, of those playful familiarities which personages seem to reserve for their intercourse with \"specials,\" of the miracles which dis criminating Nature disdains to reveal to less gifted mor tals, \u2014 till the bewildered reader, forgetting the purpose of the letter, finds himself speculating whether Air Julian Thomas was coeval with his grandfather, and possesses the gift of ubiquity and the personal friendship of the celebrities of half a century, or whether But the alternative is too discourteous to be set down here. It so happened that he was smarting from an action for libel in which the plaintiffs, the Wesleyan Alission, had been successful, and the spectacle of their reverses in the religious strife in Tonga tempted him to turn aside and curse them. In seven long letters to the ' Alelbourne Age,' he worked up his seven hours' visit into an indict ment of their agents personally and their methods in general, contriving by the way to bespatter Air Baker with the eulogy of faint dispraise. He Avrote of the history of the islands, lacking, we may charitably sup pose, the time to read more than the opening chapter of Alariner's ' Tonga,' which he glibly quotes as his authority for the remarkable statement that King George was the grandson of Finau, and that the latter murdered the Tui Tonga. He wrote of Air George Brown, and so unlovely is the picture that he paints of the gifted Secretary of"], [156, "136 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. Missions, that the reader instinctively scrutinises the line spaces for the record of some affront offered to the special correspondent. \" He calls upon me,\" says the guileless Aragabond, \" as the heathen did upon Balaam, to also curse the Premier of Tonga.\" But not even the son of Beor could surpass Air Julian Thomas in incorruptibility and a delicate sense of honour ; for he at least allowed the Balak to offer burnt sacrifice, and the latter, if we may believe him, feared the blunting influence of even a dinner upon his sensitive conscience. \" I may hint here that I am bidden to sit at meat with the king, . . . but neither from monarch nor Premier nor missionary could I accept the slightest hospitality. I do not know what I may have to say about each, and keep perfectly unfettered and un biassed by any considerations which the reception of any courtesies might enforce upon me. Aly attitude in this matter rather offends the Tongan Premier.\" It is a fine image this of the pressman, after years spent in the hurly-burly of colonial journalism, so punctilious of his honour that he puts behind him the temptations of a meal, lest they turn him from the stern duty which be owes to society. Would that no rude hand had been put forth to smutch so fair a picture ! But there in damning evidence lay the voucher \" for the right of reprinting ' Holy Tonga,' \" signed by The Aragabond as claimant, and by its side a copy of Air Baker's letter inviting him to fix his own honorarium, and his reply naming the modest sum of \u00a350. The letters to the ' Age ' were reprinted in Auckland in pamphlet form under the title of ' Holy Tonga,' and a thousand copies now lay upon the floor of the Premier's"], [157, "137 TO BE BURNED BY THE COMMON HANGMAN. office. Since Air Baker shared with Air AVatkin the honour of The Aragabond's eulogy, the Free Church had with unanswerable logic been debited with half the \" honorarium \" ; but the remaining \u00a362, 15s. was a dead loss to the Government. The fate of the pamphlet was decided from the moment when a kind friend translated to Tungi the following passage : \" Tungi wipes his greasy fingers on his fat thighs, and then looks up at us with a query in his wicked black eyes. . . . He is very obese, the fat swelling into wrinkles on his wrists and legs like those of a prize baby. He looks sensual and wicked, and strikes us as the very model of a black Tiberius.\" But the late Premier, probably uneasy as to the view that might be formed regarding his share in the transac tion, authorised his son to buy the pamphlet at the price it had cost the Treasury. The offer was tempting in view of the emptiness of the Exchequer, but I could not close with it until the consent of my colleagues had been obtained. The proposal was laid before the Cabinet. Kubu and Tukuaho were against making terms with Air Baker of any kind ; Sateki thought that the money should not be refused; the Chief- Justice did not catch the pro posal, and Goschen's thoughts were elsewhere. Then Tungi rose. He had heard, he said, that the book was libellous, and spoke evil of dignities. He thought he remembered seeing the white man who wrote it : he was a man of disreputable appearance (nmtamata tu'a), and he looked as if he drank much strong kava. If the book were sold Air Baker would distribute it abroad, and Tonga would haA*e an evil smell. ' Holy Tonga ' was brought to judg ment and condemned to suffer at the stake, like many a"], [158, "138 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. better book before it. But the time of execution was put off from day to day, and I strongly suspect that the thou sand copies still lie piled away forgotten in the Premier's back-office. There were no offers to buy back the other extrava gances of the late Premier, though the inventory showed a tempting variety. There was a passenger 'car to run on the tram-line from the wharf to the banana plantation ; a safe that cost \u00a3150, so large as to be unsaleable even in Auckland; a book of New Zealand birds costing \u00a311, 11s., bought in order that Air Baker's name might figure on the title-page as joint patron with the Queen and other per sonages ; an electric -light installation of an antiquated and useless pattern ; a full outfit of electrical toys, induc tion coils, miniature pumps, tiny lights, dancing-dolls, &c; and a quantity of <*/M\u00abst-scientific apparatus stored in the Fate Saienisi (Science House) at the College ; besides a vast quantity of stores of all kinds dissipated among the natives. We had now to devise some system of book-keeping for the revenue clerks, simplified to suit that peculiar mathe matical talent that can solve a problem in higher algebra without being able to add up a column of figures cor rectly, yet sufficiently elaborate to admit of an accurate statement of revenue from any source at a given time, and of a check being kept upon dishonest officials. We abolished at one sweep the old books with their complicated headings, and substituted common cash-books for them. The revenue collectors gave printed receipts for every payment made to them, retaining a duplicate to show to the officer who audited their books. Once a-week"], [159, "ON HIS DEFENCE. 139 they paid their revenue to the sub-treasurer, who gave them a receipt, which they sent every month, pinned to a copy of their cash-books, to Nukualofa. The sub-treasurer had also to post a copy of his book to the capital, where it was carefully compared with the receipts he had given to the revenue collectors. If they failed to agree, it was plain that the sub-treasurer had received more than he accounted for, and any defalcations of the revenue col lectors could be checked by an examination of the num bered butts of their receipt-books. Embezzlement could therefore only pass unnoticed if the sub-treasurer and the revenue collectors were in league to defraud the country. This elementary trap was no sooner set than it secured a quarry. The monthly statement of the sub-treasurer of A'avau tallied with the receipts he had given to the revenue collectors in so far as the total was concerned ; but the A*arious items, when added up, fell short of the reputed amount by some 70 dollars. Each item had been clipped in accordance witli a system that had probably been going on for years without detection. Explanations were called for ; but the sub-treasurer took the high ground that as it cast a personal reflection on his honour, the demand w*as beneath his notice. Aly colleagues were loath to proceed to extremities ; for the defaulter was highly connected in Aravau, and was likely to use his influence to estrange the Civil servants already wavering in their loyalty to the Government. He was, moreover, the pet clerk of old Inoke Fotu, Kubu's father, on whose devotion we counted to defeat the hostile influence of Alanase, the Governor. But I was firm. Campbell had established the defalcations without a doubt ; the facts"], [160, "140 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. were well known to numbers of the native clerks ; and to allow so flagrant an offence to go unpunished would be to invite dishonesty from all our employees. Tukuaho at last gave way so far as to consent to the man's dismissal, if I would allow him to bring the end about in his own way. He showed me a letter from the defaulter in which he forgave him (Tukuaho) from his heart for the wrong he had clone him. It was, he wrote, not Tukuaho's fault that so wicked a conspiracy had been formed, for he knew that it was the work of these deceitful foreigners who were his advisers ; and in a magnificent peroration he besought him by their common God, Jehovah (with whom they both appeared to have relations of an intimacy denied to deceitful foreigners), to become the saviour of his country by casting out his two advisers, especially Kamibeli, aud by restoring him (the writer) to the emi nence to which his own superior qualities had raised him. The tone of the letter was magnanimous throughout, and from a clerk guilty of embezzlement to the Premier of the country it would haA*e been a startling production in any other part of the world. Tukuaho's object was to get the man away from his friends in Vavau before dealing with him. He therefore invited him to clear himself before the Cabinet in Nukualofa, handing over his office during his absence to the sub-treasurer of Haapai. He swallowed the bait, and in clue course stood at the bar of the Council-house to clear his character before his Alajesty's Ministers. He was a large cow-faced man, with his lips pursed into a perpetual whistle. I was commissioned by Goschen to prefer the charge, and described the dis crepancy between his monthly statement and the receipts"], [161, "COOKING THE FIGURES. 141 he had given to the revenue collectors. The accused was calm, collected, and perfectly respectful. He had with him his books for the last three years, and he proceeded to read them, pausing at intervals to take breath and to \" He had with him his books for the last three years.\" explain that, but for Mr Baker of execrable memory, the matter would be clear to a person of even Campbell's limited comprehension. Although his harangue had as much to do with the point at issue as it had with the"], [162, "142 A SCHOOL OF COOKERY FOR ACCOUNTANTS. English Budget, I could see that the array of figures had produced a favourable impression. It was in vain that I put direct questions to the accused about the missing $70 ; he continued blandly to quote the monetary trans actions of past years with the superior consciousness of convincing argument. Goschen was nodding ; Tungi wore the expression of a disinterested spectator at a prize-fight ; Kubu was honestly trying to understand what it was all about; and Tukuaho was wavering between his faith in me and his respect for the display of erudition on the part of the defaulting treasurer. At my instance the accused was cut short, and ordered to withdraw while we discussed the matter. As soon as he was released from the spell of the treasurer's bovine countenance, Tukuaho pointed out that, whether the charge was proved or not, it was clear that the books were badly kept to have given rise to any doubts on the score of the treasurer's honesty ; and as the work was going on very well in his absence, he thought he should be relieved of active employment until the meeting of Parliament, who might reinstate him if they pleased. This middle course having been agreed to, the cow-faced sub-treasurer was sent home to do his worst with the members for Aravau. Alas for human proposi tions ! AVhen Parliament did meet, his grievances were forgotten in the intoxication of debate, and in the en thusiasm evoked by a Alinistry who catered well for the physical wants of its supporters. Alanase, his chief ally, was himself impeached, and his case never even came to a hearing."], [163, "143 X. THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. There were several troublesome claims upon the Govern ment to be settled. One of the steamboat companies was receiving a Government subsidy of \u00a350 a -month, and alleged a twelvemonth's contract as a reason for its con tinuance. We did not want the steamer, nor could we afford to pay the subsidy. Fortunately our predecessor's rooted objection to being bound by paper stood us in good stead. There was no formal written contract, and the claim was compromised. Another New Zealand firm de clared that Air Baker had promised to sell them 500 tons of copra at current market rates in return for their com placence in lending him money at a time when he was hard pressed for it. AVe had repaid the borrowed money, and we had already sold all our tax copra to another firm for a higher price. In this case also no written agreement was forthcoming. I proposed arbitration by the Consul- General. The case was referred to his law officers, and decided in our favour. The claimants were Plymouth Brethren, and if all the elect are as sharp in business as they were, they are likely to enjoy the good things of this"], [164, "144 THE AVOLF AT THE DOOR. life as well as of the next. Except for trivial amounts, they put their trust in no one ; for it was currently re ported that the agent in Tonga wrote to his partners in New Zealand telling them to fully insure all goods of over \u00a350 in value, but that they might trust shipments of lesser value \" to the care of Almighty Piwidence.\" These difficulties were no sooner settled than a new source of annoyance broke forth. Air Baker, just before his departure, had engaged a schoolmaster for the Govern ment College for five years, at an annual salary of \u00a3200, which the impoverished Treasury was quite incapable of paying. He was offered, and accepted, a sum of \u00a3100 and a free passage to Sydney in full release of all claims he might have upon the Government. But before he left Tonga he had made a secret compact with the College boys to return if his salary could be collected. The lads, actuated partly by a genuine desire for education, and partly by a boyish delight at their new-found importance, had gone to the king with Alaafu \u2014 who joined them in the hope of annoying Tukuaho \u2014 and persuaded him to countermand the arrangements made for the school master's departure. The order arrived in Nukualofa too late, and before the man could be recalled from Sydney his communications to the Australian newspapers had effectually dissipated the king's wish for his return. But the scholars of the College, all thirsting for excitement, set themselves to raise contributions to pay the salary, and formed themselves into a guild to encourage educa tion and defy the Government. The College had a brass band and a magic-lantern : these were embarked in the Alalokula, and taken off to Haapai and A'avau as the"], [165, "\"the house that jack built.\" 145 nucleus of au entertainment for a money-collecting tour. Tukuaho, Tungi, and Fatafehi were indignant, but power less to interfere. The entertainments were reported to be an immense success. The band paraded the towns, and took the half-dollars at the doors, and exhibited in rapid succession lantern - slides of the Holy Land and \" The house that Jack built,\" with a fine disregard to subject and sequence. The people cheerfully paid their half dollars, dimly understanding that the money was to be used in embarrassing the Government. At last the glass chimney of the lantern broke, and the schooner made a K"], [166, "146 THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. special voyage to Nukualofa to beg a new chimney from Tukuaho. It was high time to interfere with these boyish escapades, and we therefore temporised, sending a message to the band that they had overstayed their leave, and would be expelled unless they came back. This brought them to their senses, and they sailed in with flags flying, and the big drum beating defiance. They were forthwith assembled, and offered the choice between obedience to orders or expulsion. They were at first inclined to be mutinous, but on the reflection that the instruments were GoArernment property they became more amenable to discipline. Tonga is not the first State whose public affairs have been deranged by feminine frailty. Was there not a Alark Antony ? But Alark Antony did not write short hand nor keep the minutes of the Council, and it may therefore be doubted whether he was as necessary to the dying Republic as Uiliame Umufuke, alias Alataka, was to the kingdom of Tonga. Mataka was invaluable. He knew all the secrets of the Cabinet and Privy Council, yet his mouth was closed ; he understood the business of each office better than the head of the Department ; he could take down a speech in shorthand faster than the speaker could utter the words ; and he was a more useful spy and detective than fat Peter or any of his satellites. A blow was struck at the wellbeing of the State when Alataka got into trouble, for there was but one inexorable law for the rich and the poor, the indispensable and the un necessary. Alataka's troubles fell on this wise. Tukuaho had a fair cousin, Lobase, who had espoused Lulu the bandmaster,"], [167, "A FRAIL FAIR. 147 now absent in Vavau in the train of the magic-lantern. Alataka, it seems, had been indiscreet, and Lulu had instructed the Inisipckda of Police to prosecute on his behalf. I know nothing of the details \u2014 they did not interest me ; I only know that Alataka and Lobase were weighed in the scales of justice, and that their scale kicked the beam. Alataka's seat was empty next morning, and the office was disorganised. Sibu made four mistakes in his first letter, and could not find the correspondence register. Later in the day, in the person of a sulky convict with cropped head unloading a banana waggon, I recog nised the Clerk of the Privy Council. The frail fair meanwhile, being unable to find the 60 dollars required to pay her fine, delivered herself up to work it out at the rate of Is. a-day, and was told off to G.'s household. She was a fair specimen of the grisette of the country, coquettish, naive, aud thoroughly frivolous. Her A-rews of life were matured.

She had heard that there were people who gave their hearts once and for all \u2014 she could indeed dimly imagine the condition of mind that brought it. It was very nice and all that, but her own experience was different. She had been in love a great many times, and always just as much each time. What made her fall in love ? She did not know. She supposed that the man surpassed all others for strength and beauty \u2014 then she loved him, and after a while he grew to seem less handsome in her eyes, and she saw another who surpassed even him. No ! She never"], [168, "148 THE WOLF AT THE DOOR loved Lulu. He was her husband, chosen for her by her friends : moreover, he was an angry man. Lobase's punishment sat lightly on her. In due course bandmaster Lulu returned and compounded the matter with the jailer ; but even this did not seem to soften the heart of his spouse. Less than a week af ter his return he burst into my office in great ex citement to com plain that band practice was im possible because his cornet was locked up in his house, and \" the woman Lobase \" had hidden the key. The con jugal recrimina tions, when she was called upon for explanations, Lobase were bitter and shrill. Poor Lulu ! His band in the act of rehearsing the grand march from Tannhauser was easier to manage than his fair but fickle wife. There is a lack of thoroughness about the Tongans. They pine to live like Europeans, to own implements and horses and saddlery, yet not one of them can bake a loaf"], [169, "THE RULES OF THE SERVICE. 149 of bread, nor forge a bolt, nor splice a strap. Their thirst is not for knowledge, but for showy accomplishments : their genius is frothy and ephemeral. This moral untidiness pervades everything. In the king's palace there is a throne room furnished like an Australian parlour, with Kidderminster carpet, ormolu ornaments under glass shades, and crewel-work mats on the tables, \u2014 the whole in unimaginable order, \u2014 while in a bare room on the ground - floor the king sleeps on his mat spread on the boards, and eats his yams from a single plate. A Cabinet Alinister may be seen sitting on the floor of his well furnished office eating his mid-day meal from a large dish with his fingers. The Alinister of Police bustles about his work, delighted with the new routine he imperfectly un derstands. \" It is excellent,\" he says with enthusiasm, only he cannot say how many officials draw pay in his department, nor can the Premier as Alinister of Education. The latter thinks that they are paid in proportion to the number of their pupils, but he does not know for certain. Shrewd old Sateki, the Auditor-General, alone is not en thusiastic. He dares to think that some clay his work will be plain to him, but at present his mind is darkened. He is a really dependable subordinate this Sateki, but I can see that he sighs for the clay when he received his orders, right or wrong, and had only to carry them out without the responsibility of deciding anything for himself. He was the only official besides Tukuaho who attended his office every day. The pay of the Civil servants was fixed on the supposition that they should have time for the cultivation of their food-gardens. The clerks had to attend"], [170, "150 THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. their offices on Mondays, AVednesdays, and Fridays, but they were free on all other clays in the week. This arrangement had its inconveniences, but so long as it afforded a reason for not increasing the salaries, it could not be altered. Tukuaho did his best to attend every day ; but funeral feasts or the requirements of religion (he was a local preacher) often interfered to keep him from the office, and I had to content myself with the reflection that he was advancing our interests by the not less effective means of making friends with the mammon of unrighteous ness. But the others did not even keep the short hours required of them. Not many clays after our first Cabinet Council there was a fresh alarm that the Treasury was closed again on a Friday. A policeman was despatched in hot haste to fetch the Treasury officials, and in ten min utes a melancholy procession filed into the office, headed by Goschen. \" This is Friday,\" I began, \" and the Treas ury is closed again at three o'clock. How is our work to go on under such conditions ? \" The aged Alinister and his satellites crouched cross-legged before me like a lot of naughty schoolboys. \" AVe were in church,\" said Goschen, solemnly. This spiked my gun, and I handed them over to Tukuaho, who knew more of their spiritual require ments than I. The Tongans are a race of athletes. In foot-races and feats of strength, notably the tug-of-war, they have gener ally worsted the blue-jackets whom they have challenged, but their real passion is cricket. Soon after its intro duction the game became a national clanger. The planta tions were neglected ; the cocoa-nuts lay rotting on the ground : for the whole population played cricket from"], [171, "A HOSTILE PRESS. 151 dawn till dusk all over the island, with a bat if they could get it, but otherwise with a cocoa-nut branch and an unripe orange.

This Avas all changed when cricket was regulated by law, and confined to Tuesdays and Thursdays only ; besides, the heat of the cricket - passion has had time to cool. But I record the matter if only to serve the speakers at cricket-dinners with a useful illustration. The two principal papers in Auckland were bespatter ing us with satirical abuse. This was not unexpected, for we had been warned that Air Baker was a shareholder in one of them. It is good for a Government to be reviled by the press \u2014 it produces a healthy glow of reaction, like a shower-bath on a cold morning ; but Ave owed money in Auckland, and were dependent upon our credit for our sup plies. I had a weapon to brandish over the head of one of these organs : the Government printing was done in its office, but I could scarcely insist on its closing its columns to hostile criticisms without providing it with a correspon dent free from prejudice. I knew of no one in Tonga at the time who could be trusted to write without bias against the new Administration except myself. I there fore had a message conveyed to the proprietors of the ' Herald ' that we could not continue to give our printing to a hostile journal, and that if they wanted our custom they must amend their tone. If their \" own correspon-"], [172, "152 THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. dent \" was past reform, I promised to provide them with a monthly letter. To the ' Star ' I wrote that we were think ing of dividing our printing if we could find a friendly firm to undertake a -portion of it, but that the inimical tone of their paper had hitherto prevented us from doing so. If, however, they would adopt an impartial attitude, I should be glad to meet them half-way by supplying regu lar news. Thenceforth I became \" Our own Correspon dent \" to both papers, and wrote by each mail two separate letters, alike only in their colourless stolidity, in which neither favour nor ill-will to the Government of Tonga shocked the eye, and the printing was divided. This arrangement was not made too soon, for the wordy effu sions of the disappointed schoolmaster, had they appeared in print, would have created a panic among our creditors. The impartiality of the Government in sectarian dis putes had had the effect of allaying to some extent the bitter feeling between the rival Churches. But the AVes leyans still suffered disabilities, and were far from satisfied. The all, or plantations of the ministers, confiscated during the disturbances, had not yet been given back to them, and indeed could not be restored without injustice to the present occupants, who were given possession in good faith by the late Government. The Free Church ministers still had possession of a quantity of timber, some windows, and a church bell, bought with the mission funds, and refused to give them up, on the ground that they were paid for with the subscriptions of the AVesleyans who have since turned to the Free Church. No doubt the property was vested in the trustees of the AVesleyan Church, but I urged forbearance, for every day of harmony was a gain"], [173, "CHURCH SQUABBLES. 153 to the AVesleyan cause worth far more than the value of the trumpery church property said to be unlawfully de tained. So long as the Bev. George Brown remained in Tonga as the head of the mission the Wesleyans showed the most admirable self-restraint. They bore their disa bilities with good temper, and did not run the risk of irri tating the susceptibilities of the Free Church ministers by attempting to regain any of their lost ground. But he was the General Secretary of Alissions, and could not continue to stay in Tonga now that his Church was no longer in imminent danger of extinction. As soon as his restraining influence was withdrawn, and Air C became the head of the mission, there was a change. He was an amateur lawyer, whose natural turn for hair splitting polemics had been sharpened by much bandying of words with Tongan magistrates during the Beign of Terror. In an evil hour he came to Nukualofa, and with his brother-in-arms began to plan cutting-out expeditions into the enemy's country. They held the fallacious belief that the people were only deterred by fear of the king from returning to the bosom of their old Church, and that since a period of toleration had been proclaimed they might safely hold services again in the villages that they had lost. It chanced that an old woman from Havelu had lately been reconverted, and she, questioned as to the spiritual attitude of her fellow-villagers, declared that they were only waiting for a favourable opportunity to follow her example. Air C consulted the impetuous Kubu, who told him that there would be no danger in holding services again in Havelu, and upon the following- Sunday a chosen band of native teachers rode thither,"], [174, "154 THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. and reopened the long-disused church with a thanks giving service. In the evening the Free Church held a bolotu, and in the excitement of that inebriating act of worship vowed that they would not again suffer their village to be desecrated by the hosannas of the Fakaongo. Each speaker surpassed the last, until nine fanatics rushed out of the church for their axes and fell upon the AVes leyan church, hacking at the tie-beams until the roof fell in Avith a crash. The news reached Nukualofa very late on the Sunday night, and before daylight the nine men of action had been haled to the police station, and thrown into the dark cells. Then the fiery Kubu, having had time for reflection, came to me for advice. I called at the mission -house and tried to point a moral. The reverend gentlemen were not a little aghast at the (to them) unexpected result of applying a match to dry gunpowder, and were as anxious as I to repair the damage they had done. The men had been arrested for rioting. They could not be kept in jail, but it would not be politic to let them out without trial. On the other hand, if they were severely punished there would be a new outbreak of indignation against the Fakaongo. I suggested that they should be brought before a magistrate that afternoon, and that Air C should attend to beg them off on condition that they rebuilt the church. He seemed to feel quite a glow of Christian forbearance in anticipation of the lustre that so politic an act would shed upon him. An intima tion of the stage arrangements was conveyed to the magis trate. The culprits \u2014 the only actors in the scene who had not learned their parts \u2014 had been so calmed by nine hours in the dark cells that they were ready to promise"], [175, "155 A MUTINOUS GOVERNOR. anything, and the magnanimity of the Wesleyans in begging them off was not without its effect. A dis agreeable crisis was thus averted, but the incident did considerable damage to the cause of the mission. Church matters were not going smoothly at Vavau. The mayor of a small village took the opportunity of the change of Government to turn AVesleyan, and Alanase, the GoArernor, immediately dismissed him. The right of dis missal of Civil servants, including mayors, is vested only in the Premier, and therefore Manase was obviously ex ceeding his powers ; but being a bigoted Free Churchman, without sufficient brains to see that the Church had now to learn to stand alone without bolstering from the State, he did not stop to think of legality. If Alanase's action had been one of intolerance only, I do not think that we should have interfered, for the coveted end of sectarian peace would have been better served by the patient endur ance of all present injuries for the sake of allaying the natural irritation of the Free Churchmen at the change in their circumstances ; but Manase had wilfully broken the law, and this could not be passed over. Tukuaho wrote to order him to reinstate the mayor : Alanase took no notice of the letter. To a stronger command he replied that \" it was not his wish that any Fakaongo should hold office,\" and therefore he could not reinstate him. This was a declaration of war, but the king only had power to dismiss a governor, and he was at Vavau at the time, and more likely to listen to Alanase than to his Ministry. News from the distant islands of Niuafoou and Niuatobu tabu was equally disquieting. No sooner had Kubu and Sateki set sail than Tuia of the former and the powerful"], [176, "156 THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. Maatu of the latter island began simultaneously to intimi date the Wesleyans. \"Air Baker might be gone,\" they said, \" but the church that Tubou set up was still stand ing, and they, as his deputies, would allow no other within his dominions. As for what Kubu said about toleration, that was a lie. Tubou had not changed.\" Alaatu was reported to have reached Vavau about the time that Manase had declared his defiance of the Ministry, and it seemed not improbable that their false representation to the king would land us in still deeper embarrassments. It was clear that at all hazards we must get hold of the king, or, if we could not persuade him to come to the capital, take it in turns to shepherd him at Aravau. We decided to first send Tukuaho and his father Tungi, on the understanding that they would call at Haapai and per suade Fatafehi to accompany them, since he had the greatest influence with the king. At the last moment Tungi, who is too old for any diplomacy that involves physical exertion, withdrew \u2014 as every one had prophesied \u2014 and Tukuaho sailed on the 16th of October, undertaking to return in eight days with or without the king. Two months had now elapsed since my arrival, and, but for the Customs dues, we were still existing upon credit. To retain the wavering loyalty of our CLvil ser vants we had paid them a month's salary, and had given a public assurance that the arrears due to them by our predecessors would be dealt with by Parliament. A\\rith the remnant of our slender balance we had paid a quarter of our liabilities to merchants in New Zealand and Sydney \u2014 some \u00a31500 \u2014 so as to restore our credit abroad, but we had now to depend solely upon the arrears of the poll-tax"], [177, "PHILATELY AS A SOURCE OF REVENUE. 157 for our current expenses. Before all things I was resolved not to negotiate a loan, and so exchange one set of liabili ties for another, besides setting my colleagues a dangerous example which they were sure to follow in future times of financial embarrassment. It was better to make our creditors wait, and silence them by doling out instalments from time to time. I must now make a disgraceful con fession. Among the letters in the postmaster's office were a number from firms in England and America which deal in postage stamps, some of which bad enclosed consider able sums of money. The Treasury was in dire straits, and a sum of \u00a3200 well worth a sacrifice of self-respect. AYe determined to change our stamps. The change could be effected for \u00a340, and the sale of our old stamps, thus enhanced in value, would bring us in \u00a3200 or more. I have since heard that a year later the Government of Costa Bica descended to the same disreputable expedient, but I believe I may fairly take to myself the discredit of being the first to devise the scheme. Alany a time did I curse the complaisancy of Tukuaho in binding his people to pay in copra when they were so ready to pay in coin. Numbers had been turned away from the tax-office with money in their hands, vowing that they would not hire a cart to carry their copra along miry roads for many miles when they could sell it advantageously to the storekeeper in their own vil lage. The main road from the interior branched just opposite our house, one branch leading to the Govern ment copra - sheds and the other to the stores of the traders. At the sound of wheels I used to come out to watch the copra-laden carts reach the turning. If they"], [178, "158 THE WOLF AT THE DOOR. turned to the left they were loyal subjects of King George, going to pay their just debts to his Government ; if they took the straight road on they were traitors and renegades, who loved filthy lucre better than the honour of their country. I tried to guess from the drivers' faces which way they would turn. \"Here,\" I thought, \"is a loyalist.\" The mild - faced, semi -clerical -looking driver left the reins slack on the horse's neck : the cart creaked \" There was an animated discussion.\" onward. For one moment it seemed to pause as if about to turn off, but it was fancy : the horse did not leave the middle rut, and the driver was a traitor in loyalist cloth ing after all. Clumsily disguised though, for I used then to remember that he had a cunning expression about the mouth, for all his assumed benevolence. Once a long string of carts going towards the traders so exasperated me that I sent a servant to waylay the next comer, and to tell him to take his freight to the Government stores."], [179, "SEDITIOUS PAPERS. 159 The cart stopped, and there was an animated discussion. Aly envoy was apparently successful, for at last the wheels creaked again, and I saw it crawling clown the road to the left. But when I saw the store -books that evening I found that no copra had been received. The man had taken the road to escape my importunity, but as soon as he was out of sight he had diverged along the beach to wards the traders' stores. Through the influence of the Wesleyan missionaries, who were anxious to compare favourably in loyalty with their rivals, a few of the Fakaongo had paid their arrears, but not enough to satisfy the contractor, who was becom ing restive as time passed and his prospective profits grew more and more hazy in the distance. He now proposed to lend the Government money, thinking, no doubt, that if he could put us under an obligation to him, we should bring a pressure to bear upon the defaulters more effectual than the mere threat of seizure and sale of their chattels ; but we \" feared the Greeks even when bringing gifts,\" and declined. He objected to the issue of writs of distress, thinking rightly that the majority would prefer even that disagreeable formality to a few days' steady work. The captain of the mail-steamer that arrived about this time put into the hands of the Government a parcel of printed papers, which had been handed to him by Mr Baker for secret conveyance to some of his friends to distribute among the natives. Not wishing to involve himself in the turgid politics of the little kingdom, or to infringe the Customs law, he landed it at the Custom house like any other parcel of merchandise. It proved to be an ingenious mistranslation in Tongan of the letter of"], [180, "160 THE AArOLF AT THE DOOR. prohibition, the High Commissioner being styled through out as \"the Governor of Fiji,\" probably in the hope of exciting native jealousies of their despised neighbours interfering in Tongan affairs. As it was doubtless sent to pave the way for more seditious documents, and was designed to further disturb the native mind, a Cabinet Council was summoned to consider the propriety of con fiscating the packet. It so happened that Air Baker, fearing hostile criticism in the A'ernacular, had passed an Act that all printed documents should bear an imprimatur, on pain of heavy penalties ; and this Act being still in force, the temptation to hoist him with his own petard was too great to be resisted. The packet Avas accordingly seized and burned with due indignity in the backyard of the police station by Ula, the jailer. From an angry pro test in the Auckland ' Star ' we learned that our shaft had gone home : at any rate, we were troubled no more with seditious papers."], [181, "161 XL VAVAU. AIany pens have written of Vavau. Alissionaries h&ve extolled it for its sensational conversion to Christianity ; journalists have described it as a future health-resort ; a naA*al officer has enlarged upon the natural defences of its harbour ; Byron, mixing up the two books on the Pacific of his day, Alariner's ' Tonga ' and the ' Alutiny of the Bounty,' describes it in the \" Island \" with more rhyme than geographical accuracy ; and lastly, Air St Johnstone, a sentimental young gentleman into whose soul the smell of cocoa-nut-oil had entered, raved of the beauty of its scenery and its women. In short, for its size and its distance from the civilised world, Vavau has had its full share of paper and printing-ink. But it deserves it all. The harbour may be a little less safe, the girls on nearer inspection a little greasier and less virtuous than they are painted, but the scenery, and the indescribable romance that clings about the miniature precipices of the wild Liku, cannot be exaggerated.

This was a breach of implied contract with the firm who had tendered for the tax-copra, and although they had taken advantage of Tukuaho's inexperience to obtain the contract, and had therefore little claim upon our consider ation, I felt that we were morally bound by Tukuaho's word to refuse to accept money for taxes until after Dec-"], [183, "163 THE CELTS OF TONGA, ember. The Free Church had taken this opportunity for holding their annual collections in Vavau, and the people, having sold all their available copra to get money for the church, had none left from which we could draw for the benefit of the contractor. With this news came stories of persecution in the Niuas. The Wesleyans were again being persecuted, and it was rumoured that the people had formed a league to pay no taxes. AVe held a Cabinet meeting, and resolved that the four principal members of the Cabinet, Tukuaho, Fatafehi, Kubu, and myself, should make a tour through the islands as far as Niua. The mail-steamer was to drop us at Niua on her way to the north, and a schooner was to be sent from Vavau to bring us back. But at Vavau the state of affairs was so un satisfactory that it was decided to leave me behind to settle matters with the copra-contractor. At the moment of entering the landlocked channel to the harbour one passes into a different atmosphere. The mood of the people of Tongatabu and Haapai matches their flat shores. They cover their restlessness with a crust of reserve even as the honeycomb of water-caves is hidden by plains and palm-groves : but in this land of orange-trees and wild precipices lives a different race. There is an unquiet activity about them, a vivacity of manner, a use of gesture to illustrate speech never seen among their cousins of the southern islands. The air, heavy with the scent of orange-blossom, is yet full of impulse. The men stride down to the wharf to meet the steamer, not ashamed to show that they have curi osity : the girls assemble in groups on the grassy road to chaff new-comers with an easy familiarity more respect-"], [184, "164 VAVAU, able than the mission primness of the Tongatabu maidens, whose discreet deportment invites suspicion. From the wharf one climbs a grassy slope, and straight way one is in the orange-groves. The whole town is an orange-garden. Beneath the dark shiny foliage lie piles of rotting fruit, half-concealed by the rank couch-grass. Some of the trees are bent with their green load, others are white with blossom, for the crops succeed each other with little intermission. Behind the long rows of trees nestle the brown thatched houses, set down, as it Avere, upon the grass like the toy cottages of a child. There is no beach here. The shores of the inlet are steep to, and the main road runs along the edge of the cliff. On this road stands the \" Palace,\" a barn-like decaying structure of wood, from which the paint has long ago been washed by successive rainy seasons. Poor Laifone main tained the place with magnificence, \u2014 that is to say, there were marble mantelpieces (never paid for), cut-glass de canters, china, plate, whips, walking - sticks, boot - trees, ornaments, and saddles scattered in heaps over the fur niture and floors, very dirty and in indescribable confusion; while the royal master of all this luxury slept on the floor, ate his meals with his fingers, and drank his liquor simply from the black bottle without the intermediary of a cut glass decanter. But now even those glories have departed, and the house is empty except when the king pays a fly ing visit to Vavau. Beyond the \" Palace \" were the stores, built on the seaward side of the road for greater facility in shipping copra, which comes next to oranges as the chief product of Vavau. These stores, kept by rival traders struggling for the custom of the passing Tongans, breed by"], [185, "UNITED BY DIVISIONS. 165 their juxtaposition an inextinguishable hate in the breasts of their proprietors. Flung together in this outer corner of the world, the Europeans did not scruple to slander one another to the natives, a fact that would alone suffice to account for the low estimation in which Europeans are held in Tonga. A wicked slander has it that no fresh meat can be eaten in Aravau because a sheep is too much for one family, and no man is on good enough terms with his neighbour to ask him to share with him. These men are nearly all substantial traders. Living harder lives, and dealing with a more energetic class of natives, than their compatriots in Tongatabu, more than one of the Germans could, if he sold out, realise \u00a320,000, made in a few years from a wretched little store built and furnished without capital. The Englishmen, here as elsewhere in the Pacific, were behind the Germans in wealth, as they were in industry and frugality, and as they were before them in the faculty of meddling in the local politics. I found that for once there was something resembling unanimity among the traders of Vavau, who were gener ally too busy to care about politics, and paid their taxes without grumbling. The \" Chamber of Commerce,\" re vived in Tongatabu for the joint object of worrying the new Government and of helping the insolvent publican by holding their thirst-provoking meetings at his hostelry, had lately sent a delegate to their brothers of Vavau to invite their co-operation. The unwonted excitement of a public meeting and a real live political agitation was so new, that for the moment personal enmities were laid aside. There were even suggestions by some wild enthusiast that a"], [186, "166 VAVAU, \" Chamber of Commerce \" should be founded in Vavau itself ; but though the more sober-minded renounced this proposal as impracticable, they eagerly assured the sister Chamber in Tongatabu that they might be counted upon for support in the righteous crusade against the Customs department. A deputation from the still-born Chamber of Commerce waited upon me the morning after my arri\\*al. The fumes of the public meeting had had time to e\\*aporate, and I found the deputation to be sensible fellows, whose views contrasted favourably with the intol erant resolution of the body which they represented. The good sense and moderation of the traders of Vavau is not to be measured by the ferocity of their language when convened in a public meeting, \u2014 a phenomenon not alto gether unknown in other parts of the world. Two of the traders, a Bussian Jew and an Englishman, were accused by the police of carrying on an illicit trade in liquor. The law of Tonga forbids the sale of intoxi cants to natives under a heavy penalty, and it speaks well for the good sense of the people themselves that the native Parliament has always confirmed this wise restriction. British subjects are, besides, liable to penalties before the Deputy-Commissioner's Court. Yet probably no offence is committed with greater impunity, owing to the difficulty of obtaining convictions when it is the interest of both seller and buyer to commit perjury. I once tried a case in Fiji in which it appeared that the police had given an Indian coolie 6s. to buy whisky from a storekeeper, had watched him go empty-handed to the store and return with a bottle of the damning fluid in his hand, aud had proved it by tasting to be nearly allied"], [187, "SLY GROG-SELLERS. 167 to \" Cape smoke \" and \" Nail-rod.\" The trader was a respectable and God-fearing man, and he appeared to his summons clad in decent broadcloth and patent-leather shoes without socks. He swore with awful solemnity that neither he nor any of his men had sold spirits to the Indian ; he even produced a number of his assistants to corroborate his statement. The coolie swore that he had deliberately humbugged the policeman, and that he had picked the bottle up in the grass on the way from the store. He found another Indian to swear that he had put it there, and the trader got off. Two years later he retired with a fortune. To return from this digression. Aly Russian was a man of substance, and was reputed to be a man of his word ; my Englishman was an old offender, whose sense of honour had possibly been blunted by the joint effect of the climate and his own stock-in-trade, \u2014 so the cases had to be treated differently. I sent for the Bussian Jew, and got him to make a clean breast of his delinquencies. I showed him how the law had been enacted for the protection of the Europeans themselves, for, with his thirty years' experience of the Pacific, none knew better than he what sort of a community was a native mob in liquor. He grew penitent, and promised solemnly never to sell liquor to a native again, adding that if I doubted his word he would give me a bond for \u00a31000. I declined this characteristic offer, saying that I did not doubt his word, and I believe that he justified my confidence.

One of our first acts on landing had been to pay our official visit to the Governor, who had disobeyed and defied us. One always forms a clear mental picture of a person whose acts and utterances are familiar, and the picture is generally ill-drawn. I had imagined this truc ulent Free Churchman as a self-sufficient middle-aged Tongan of the blatant kind: I found him a mild-man nered old gentleman, endowed with an apostolic saint liness of feature and expression that must have disarmed my colleagues had they not known their man so well.

AVe sat in a circle on the floor of his house and made conversation while the kava was brewed, and then, when the bowl had been removed, and we were so far alone that his household and their friends only formed a wall of ears on the other side of the reed -partition, Tukuaho and Fatafehi spoke their minds. Alanase took it all in silence with furrowed brow aud meek eyes, as who should say, \" This too I for give for the Gospel's sake ! \" As we left the house Tukuaho said that Alanase would take his lesson to heart. I thought otherwise, and in this instance I was right. Until the king's reign, as I have related elsewhere, the nobles of Vavau have always held a somewhat independent position. The Finau Ulukalala, the chiefs of the principal family, haA*e, so long as history recalls them, been men of strong personal character and individuality. They seem to have acknowledged the Tui Kanakubolu as their suze rain from inclination rather than from necessity. To a Finau of the eighteenth century we owe Captain Cook's hospitable reception in Tonga \u2014 a hospitality that would have resulted in his massacre at Alaofanga instead of in Hawaii but for a fortunate accident. To another was due the great revolution of 1799, and all the stirring times that succeeded it. His strong individuality, so wonder fully painted by au eye-witness, called forth from a Quar terly Beviewer of the day a comparison between him and the heroes of Greek tragedy. Another, Tuabaji, after re-"], [190, "170 VAVAU sisting for years the teachings of the missionaries, brought about that dramatic conversion of the whole island to Christianity that seemed to the missionaries so striking an instance of divine interposition. The line was not extinct. Though Alanase was governor under the king, a Finau Ulukalala lived in the person of an unwieldy man of thirty, a nobde of the House of Lords, it is true, and the king's aide-de-camp, but in all other respects ignored by the Government. He was not a man of high moral eleva tion, nor could the missionaries point to him as a cheering instance of the efficacy of their work. He swore fluently in both German and English, and had a cultivated taste for strong waters. Finau was a ne'er-do-weel, but perhaps a scapegrace of the kind that is not past reform if in trusted with responsibility. There was no doubt about his being the hereditary ruler of the place : one might see that from the manner of the old men as he rode through the country. Surrounded by rowdy young boon companions, holding no post that gave him a vestige of authority, he yet could not enter a village without holding an informal levte of all the inhabitants, while Alanase the Governor might pass unnoticed. Possessed of such inherent influence, he was certainly worthy of trial as Manase's successor if the king could be induced to dis miss so ardent a Free Churchman, and to appoint in his place the descendant of the chiefs whom he had dispos sessed. Perhaps guessing my sentiments, Finau attached himself to me throughout this visit. He offered to escort me to the Liku, and as I could best enjoy the scenery of this weird place alone, I was at some pains to give him the slip.

The rough a\\rerage rate of suicide in the Pacific \u2014 the figures dealt with are too insignificant for unvarying accuracy \u2014 is about equal to the rate for the United Kingdom, viz., .006 per mille of the population ; but since most of the suicides in Europe are committed under the influence of mania or Mourning. extreme misery, \u2014 conditions that are generally absent in these favoured isles, \u2014 we may assume that the Pacific islanders haA*e a predisposition towards self-destruction. The usual causes are lovers' quarrels, and the fear of being neglected in incurable illness. In the latter case suicide is a mere survival of the old custom that constrained a sick man to importune his relations to strangle or bury him alive, \u2014 itself an evolution from an earlier time when"], [193, "FAREWELL IN CIPHER. 173 the existence of a family depended upon its having no disabled members to protect. The lovers' quarrels that result in suicide are quite as trivial as those of civilised communities. On the sudden impulse of some slight misunderstanding the distressed lover resorts to the picturesque but inadequate method of climbing to the top of a cocoa-nut-palm and jumping off, with the usual result of a broken limb, a reconciliation with the beloved object, and permanent lameness. Of late years the cocoa nut-tree has become less fashionable for men who are in earnest. These generally prefer a precipice, or, if their despair be of the more deliberate kind, poison, which, being a mere infusion of bark or leaves, must lie drunk in such large quantity that it more often produces vomiting than death. The ancient mode of execution in Tonga \u2014 putting the condemned adrift in leaky canoes \u2014 still occasionally survives as a method of suicide. In February a schooner, bound from Niuatobutabu to Nukualofa, picked up a derelict canoe floating unharmed, with her paddles and baler in her, and a crumpled letter which ran as follows : \u2014 162 78982 810 6126 74 ni2 127216 m2 892 162 9812 74 m2 m274 b4 810 m2 892 16274 16m807850 892 270 1820 2m454 1118 232.

Moreover, a man cannot very well strangle himself without help. A pretence of hanging is much resorted to by people who imagine themselves to be misunderstood, or who wish to frighten their friends into making some concession, because a dramatic effect can be produced with the least possible personal inconvenience. Yet whenever confederates can be found to help, the South Sea Islander appears to prefer strangling to hang ing. In Fiji a few years ago, when Australia was ringing with the achievements of the Kelly gang of bushrangers, a trader in Vanualevu, with the aid of a Sydney news paper, was entertaining a gaping circle of Fijians by try ing to make their flesh creep. In the minds of two of his listeners, youths from the neighbouring village, the seed fell upon a rich soil. Why should they be condemned to this life of spiritless toil in subjection to their chiefs and the Government, compelled to drudge in the fields and the tax-plantations, while the free, glorious bush lay behind them ? If these foreigners, who could not exist without tinned meats, could live in the bush, how much more they who only wanted a wild yam or kaile roasted on the embers of an open fire ? They could rob all the foreigners' stores, and with the plunder tempt the girls of the vdlage to come and join them, and they would eat tinned meats and turkeys and fowls every day with out having to pay for them or work to make money. They discreetly opened their project to one of their friends, but when he understood the full daring of the scheme he modestly withdrew, in words that were trans lated by the magistrate who afterwards held the inquest as, \" Pardon me, but this thing is beyond my capacity.\""], [196, "176 VAVAU. So the three went out into the bush alone. During the first week they robbed two stores, and stabbed an elderly German in the back, escaping after each exploit into the impenetrable bush. They succeeded in establishing a real panic, so that none dared to leave the village alone ; and the native police nightly thanked Providence that they had not stumbled across them. AVhen the magistrate reached the place a week or two later with a force of police, he found that the outrages had ceased, and that nothing had been heard of the daring bush rangers for more than ten days. Weeks passed, and the confidence of the villagers was so far restored that they ventured armed into their gardens, believing that the bushrangers had gone to another part of the island. At last an old man, whose garden lay far afield, was drawn by the evidences of corruption to look into his yam-shed. Two bodies were there, decayed almost beyond recognition. One had a masi cord tied tightly round the neck, Avith both the ends free ; the other had been strangled by a cord tied by one end to the upright post. Further search led to the discovery of a third body hanging by the neck from a tree. It was the poor trio, who had also found bushranging beyond their capacity. They got lonely, and longed for companionship to prop their failing courage ; and when they could bear it no longer, and they had to choose between giving themselves up or suicide, they chose death by their own hands rather than by the unknown terrors of the law of the foreigners. So A and B put a noose round C's neck in the old style, and pulled at the ends till he was dead. Then B tied the end of his malo to the post, Avound it round his neck,"], [197, "TUTAWI THE HERMIT. 177 and gave the end to A to pull.

At the beginning of the disturbances that followed the revolution of 1799, this man, weary of the violence of men and the perfidy of women, left his home secretly to live a solitary life, communing with Nature and the spirits of the haunted Liku. The great war and the siege of Feletoa had raged within a few miles of his hiding-place unheeded by him. M"], [198, "178 VAVAU. Years after his relations had eaten his funeral feast, in the belief that he had perished in one of the numerous night attacks of that perilous time, he was accidentally dis covered by a party of girls who had wandered hither in search of scented flowers for garlands, and here the great Finau sought an interview with him and tempted him with the promise of land, slaves, and wives if he would return to the life he had left. But he refused them all, and died as he had lived, alone and unheeded of the few who remembered his existence. At length we stood upon the precipice of the Ana Alatangi, or \" CaA-e of the winds.\" Through a cleft in the rock a narrow path led to a ledge whence the adventurous might climb to the caA'e's mouth ; but the Government had taken alarm at the fatal accidents that had occurred here, and had made it a penal offence to make the attempt. The cave's mouth is the top of a vast subterranean funnel whose base is below the sea-level, so that when the tide is rising the air within is compressed with immense force and rushes out of the hole with a deep vibrating hum, and at ebb-tide is sucked in with a Avhistling hiss audible many yards away. Four times a-day, for a few minutes when the tide is turning, this cave of the winds is at rest, and at these moments it is safe to enter ; but at half-tide any one crossing the mouth is either blown off the ledge or sucked in, unless he have a firm foothold and a clear head. This was not the only expedition in which Finau shepherded me. Like every tourist who stopped at VaA'au before me, I paid a visit to the Hunga submarine cave twice famed by Alariner and Byron. It lies some miles"], [199, "THE CAVE OF BYRON's \" ISLAND.\" 179 to the seaward of Neiafu up the harbour, and when we reached it a heavy swell was rolling in towards the cliff. I was well prepared for the dive into the mouth by my experiences of the Yasawa-i-lau cave in Fiji, but my fol lowers were obdurate, declaring that no one would attempt the Hunga in a westerly swell unless he was resolved on self-destruction. They cited the case of the captain of a ship of war, who was driven upwards by an incoming wave as he was in mid-passage, and who escaped indeed with life, but with his spine so lacerated by the sharp stalactites that he was permanently crippled. While we were still debating the question a smart sailing-boat bore clown on us with a stout figure at the tiller, whom I recognised as Finau. He hailed us to say that he had come to pilot us to the other show-cave of the place, and (parenthetically, of course) to point out the bound aries of some land of which it was proposed illegally to deprive him. The cave just allowed our boats to run in with masts standing. Inside it heightened and broadened to a width of 60 or 70 feet. The limestone walls were disfigured with the names of Europeans and Tongans, and the dates of their offence ; for, with the art of writing, has come the Cockney instinct to deface Nature with a record of existences to which she and all her creatures are supremely indifferent. The stock entertainment of the place was a shaft of rock which, when struck with the handle of an oar, gave out a deep musical note. But Finau had something more serious in view than this puerile amusement. Leaving our boats, we clambered over the rocks through a dark passage and emerged into another cave, in size and shape"], [200, "180 VAVAU like the interior of a large lime-kiln, even to the hole in the conical roof. Acting under Finau's orders, one of our men now swam back to the entrance of the cave, and a Sending up a thick column of smoke to the leafy chimney few minutes later a shout from the dome warned us to \" stand from under.\" Through the chimney-hole invisible hands showered down great billets of firewood. Matches"], [201, "RAIDING THE TREASURY. 181 were produced, and in a few moments a large fire was heating the stones in the middle of the cave's floor, and sending up a thick column of smoke to the leafy chimney in the roof. AA7hen the stones were red-hot and the oven was ready for its lining, the same invisible hand, in obe dience to Finau's shout, poured through the hole a shower of green branches and banana-leaves, that fluttered down like the ruins of Klingsor's garden. The chickens and yams were soon baking in the steam of the leaves, buried under a foot of soil. Picnics such as this are to the idle young Tongan one of the highest forms of earthly happiness. Fonos and addresses to the Civil servants had done something towards allaying suspicion and discontent in Vavau, in spite of the strenuous efforts of Air Baker's son and the other Europeans to foster hostility to the Government. The result of the Governor's misconduct in accepting coin in payment of taxes had been to pour into the empty local treasury between \u00a32000 and \u00a33000 in silver. Seeing that the cow-faced sub-treasurer, in addi tion to his other delinquencies, reported that \u00a36 had miraculously vanished from a saucer in which he guarded the public funds, though the fastenings of the treasury were intact, it was plainly time to remove the whole sum to a place where it could be employed in liquidating the debts of the country rather than those of the local officials. There was a strange display of emotion among the treasury clerks when I announced my intention. The Customs officer, an Englishman, enlightened me. The nobles of Vavau were Home Bulers to a man, at least in so far as their money was concerned. They held that every dollar-"], [202, "182 ATAVAU, piece paid into their treasury should be spent in their island\u2014 the very self-same coins, not changelings from Tongatabu. Therefore, though the law enjoined them, on receipt of instructions from the Minister of Finance, to remit their money to Nukualofa, even in the zenith of Air Baker's power they habitually disregarded such orders, until the Premier himself, accompanied by a Cabinet Alinister or two, had to come and remove the money under escort, amid the outspoken murmurs of the whole island. As soon as the clerks had spread the news of my intention, all sorts of obstacles sprang into existence. There were no bags to put the money in ! It could not be counted in time ! It was safer in Vavau than in Nukualofa ! The king did not wish the money to go ! The king's sanction was not in the least necessary; but as I always preferred to take the least thorny path to my object, I called upon his Alajesty to ask his permission, as well as to obtain the royal pardon for Tevita Finau, one of the religious exiles who still lay under sentence of penal servitude for church offences. I found the king in the back verandah of the tumble-down Palace, apparently alone ; but a glance at the rickety kitchen, that stood within earshot, told me that the building was packed with the gossips of Vavau assembled to take notes of our interview. \" Is not this a time for forgiveness ? \" the king said, in reply to my formal request for a pardon for Finau. \" Sign the papers in my name.\" To my second demand he said, \" Let them talk. Take the money. Is not A'avau the land of foolish talking ? \" But I wanted more than this. Alanase had to learn a"], [203, "183 I OBTAIN AN ORDER IN COUNCIL. lesson, and I asked for a Privy Council for the ostensible purpose of passing a short Ordinance of routine. To make the necessary quorum, I suggested that Inoke Fotu, the judge, Kubu's father, should be sworn in as an extra ordinary member. Though a professed adherent of our party, he had shown signs of independence under the suspension of his relative and protigi, the cow-faced sub treasurer, and I thought that the appointment, besides flattering him, would force him to declare against his old adversary Alanase. The king was in an executive mood. \"Hail ha taha !\" (Let some one come !) he cried. From among the trees in the distance a burly Tongan burst at a quick run. Gathering speed as he approached, when at ten yards from the king he leaped suddenly into the air and landed in a sitting posture right at the king's feet, Avith head bowed and body rigid in the attitude of respect. It was the most physically painful act of rex erence I had ever witnessed. \" Tell Inoke and Alanase to come at once.\" The man sprang to his feet and dashed oft' into the trees at his topmost speed. In a few moments the two chiefs arrived, eA*idently perturbed at the urgency of the summons. AVe moved into the dining-room, and held our Council there and then. Alanase's feeble protest against the first resolution, that the funds in the treasury should be remitted to Nukualofa according to law, was unheeded by the king, but it sufficed to rouse old Inoke, and the resolution was of course carried. Armed with so formidable a mandate as an Order of the king in Council, I summoned all the treasury officials to count the cash, and ordered canvas bags to be made at"], [204, "184 VAVAU the nearest store.

The bags were scarcely sealed when the steamer came in.

MISSIONARIES. In our efforts to induce the people to pay their taxes, our principal competitors were not the traders, but the Churches. There was but one money-harvest in the year, and the directors of the several bodies that preyed upon the Tongans \u2014 the Government, the two Wesleyan mis sions, and in a lesser degree the Eoman Catholics \u2014 set themselves to reap the golden crop simultaneously as soon as the sun had dried the copra. I must admit that the Wesleyans, in their anxiety to prove their loyalty, did not hold their missionary collections until the ma jority of their people had paid their taxes. The other missions were less considerate, and took largely of the things that were C\u00e6sar's. The fakamisonali is so charac teristic an entertainment that I must attempt to describe one. For some days previously six or seven chosen vessels had been canvassing their friends on behalf of the plates for which they were to be responsible on the great day. There was a keen rivalry between them, and to the im portunities of one of them I fell a A*ictim, defending"], [206, "186 MISSIONARIES. myself from the others by sheltering behind the promise I had given him not to contribute to any plate but his. Their method was ingenious. The tout took care to approach his victim in the evening when the house was full of people. He would remark that Pita (a neighbour) had promised two dollars this year, and would hint that he scarcely supposes the victim will allow himself to be outdone by such a one as Pita ! The unfortunate man, constrained by false shame, promises more than he can afford ; the amount is noted in a book, and has to be found by importunity or petty larceny. As the day drew nearer we were set upon by numbers of the faithful, including our convict groom, who came to borrow money to give to the Church. For these I had but one form of argument \u2014 forcible if not altogether reverent. They were, I said, proposing to give my money to the Church \u2014 not their own ; and as it was extremely unlikely that they would ever pay me back, and therefore either I or the Church would have to go without the money, I thought the Church was better able to afford the loss. Cynics among the traders even went the length of declaring that the fakamisonali is always accompanied by the disappearance of their ducks and fowls, which may generally be found in the yard of a rival trader living at a distance, who has innocently bought them from a natiA*e bent upon contributing his mite to the Church. This is no doubt a slander. On the appointed day the whole population donned their gala trousers and petticoats, and streamed to the church, whose big bell was being tolled by relays of urchins. The pews were crowded : there was not even"], [207, "SENDING ROUND THE HAT. 187 standing-room round the walls. At the pulpit end was a semicircle of seats for the European aristocracy, includ ing, of course, Air Al , the contractor for the Govern ment copra, who aspired to be thought the deliverer of oppressed Tongans, and could not therefore allow such an opportunity for advertisement to pass. How shall I describe the scene that followed ? How shall I portray the unction of the presiding missionary, as he poured forth his prayers for a full plate in a voice shaken with emotion, the roar of \"Malo!\" as each senti ment found expression, the rich smiles of the owners of the filling basins, and the mortified anxiety of the owners of the still empty ones ? How tell of the magnificent, if somewhat ostentatious, liberality of the portly Air Al , as his interpreter, the local butcher, announced, amid deafening cheers, that he was about to give \u00a320 to the Lord out of his deep compassion for the suffering and oppressed ? If the bolotu was a pious orgy, the faka misonali was a religious debauch. In front of the pulpit stood a table on which lay a common wash-hand basin and an account-book, guarded each by a native teacher. The patrons of the basins sat in a stiff row behind. After the preliminary religious exercises the missionary announced the name of the patron of the \" plate \" first to be filled. It might be the name of the person in charge of it, or that of some dead or absent one to whose memory it was dedicated. In one case a young blood of Vavau called his plate after a favourite dog, deceased some months before ; but the presiding missionary had to draw the line somewhere, and he elected to draw it at dead dogs, because he feared that it might import a spirit of levity into the"], [208, "188 MISSIONARIES. proceedings. As the name of each patron was called she rose in a stately manner and cast her contribution into the basin as a nest-egg. And now those who had promised contributions to the \" plate \" just announced, swaggered up the aisle and flung their coins into the basin. It was amusing to note the difference of gesture. Here a man would march up with an air of deep disdain and toss his \" Let ?iot thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.\" coins into the basin one by one. Another would approach with proud humility and dash down a handful of threepenny pieces with a crash, retiring as he had come amid the shouts of well-merited applause for the dramatic contrast between his bearing and his bounty. In earlier days, before the glare of publicity had checked the spontaneity of the fakamisonali, the real sensation, as in all well-"], [209, "A PIOUS ORGY. 189 arranged spectacles, was kept until the end. A band of men and women would come up together and walk round and round the basin, each throwing in a threepenny piece as he passed. After a few rounds a man whose stock of coins was exhausted would fall out, and the procession continued without him. Then only two were left to circle round each other in a sort of dance, amid deafening applause. At last one of the survivors gave out, and the victor was left alone to stand before the basin and chuck in his coins from a distance. He was the hero of the clay. Behind the pulpit were the tables of the money-changer, who, so far from being driven out of this temple, was con sidered necessary to its very existence, being, in fact, the missionary himself. The mode of collection demanded a larger stock of small coins than was obtainable at the local stores, and as every contributor was encouraged to enlighten his right hand as to the doings of his left, the smaller coins are made to do double duty. AVhen the congregation would no longer respond to the taunts or the entreaties of the basin-man, the contents of the basin were counted and dumped upon the money-changer's table, thus supplying him with change to satisfy the require ments of the contributors whose turns were yet to come. In the palmy days of the AVesleyan mission, when Air Baker was still the trusted shepherd of an undivided flock, the mission treasury was filled by a system for the ingenuity of which I believe he deserves the entire credit. In the hysterical enthusiasm so cleverly fostered by the missionaries, the natives were quite ready to mortgage their crops for the brief glory of surpassing their neigh-"], [210, "190 MISSIONARIES. hours ; but it was thought that if the missionaries them selves advanced the money and afterwards sued their debtors in the courts when the excitement of the collection had had time to cool down, adverse criticism, and perhaps even the resentment of the faithful, might be aroused. So Air Baker entered into an unholy alliance with Messrs Buge & Co., a German firm newly arrived in the group. The agents of the firm were to advance cash to any native who wanted it for the church collections on promissory notes, to be repaid in copra when the crop was ripe ; and as the firm had not sufficient coin to satisfy all comers, the mission was to hand back the coin to the agents as fast as it was collected, taking bills on Sydney in exchange. Thus the firm secured a lien on all the future crop, to the exclusion of its rivals, the mission trebled its collections, and when the bills became due, it was the German firm who incurred the obloquy of haling the over -generous debtor before the court, and of selling up his live stock and furniture. The complacency of the courts might be counted on, for the chairman of the mission was also the unofficial adviser of the Government. Strange stories of the fakamisonali of those days were told to the Commis sion of Enquiry sent to investigate Mr Baker's proceedings \u2014 how, when the trading agent at the church door dared not advance any more cash, the disappointed native would rush back to the basin, stripping off his coat as he ran, and fling it in to win one more yell of applause from his excited fellow-worshippers. These more picturesque incidents have now given place to sober business.

After the benediction had been pronounced, the congregation walked thoughtfully home to cool down and face the future. It is easy to sneer at the missionaries in the South Pacific as drones sucking the honey that others have stored ; as ministers of the collection -plate rather than of the Gospel ; as moral teachers whose grim code is re sponsible for the deterioration of native morality. The books written about the Pacific Islands have been the work of either missionaries or passing travellers, and hostile criticism by the latter has been in obedience to the natural law of reaction after the sometimes nauseous series of self-laudatory books given to the world by the missionaries themselves. Casual travellers, who hoped to see the natives in their primitive simplicity of manners, are disappointed to find them clad and in their right minds, and galled at the restrictions, apparently arbi trary and unreasonable, laid upon them by their spirit ual guides. They haA*e read much of the hardships of the missionary's life. They find him sleek and prosperous, the autocrat of his flock, living in a good house, traArelling in a comfortable and well-found boat : they feel that an attempt has been made to obtain their sympathies under false pretences, and they write down mission enterprise a fraud, and the system a mere institution for raising money from the gullible native. In this extreme view they are supported by the Europeans of the place, \u2014 for traders do not love missionaries, regarding them as com petitors who, besides crippling trade, interfere with their domestic arrangements."], [213, "193 A DEFENCE OF ICONOCLASM. They are wrong, of course. It may be true that, with a few brilliant exceptions, the missionaries are men of but slight education and extreme narrowness of views, and that the time for hardship and danger has passed away; but one need only compare the past with the present to acknowledge how great is the work they have accom plished. The early missionaries went with their lives in their hands, having nothing to gain from their enterprise but the inward reward of self-sacrifice. As for the women who followed their husbands to suffer with them the pri- A-ations they Avere less able to endure, forced to bear and rear children in unhealthy climates, shocked almost daily bv scenes that disgust us even to read about, and relieved at last only to return to their fellows with shattered health, \u2014 no praise can be too great for them. If the first mis sionaries were ignorant and narrow-minded, so also, ac cording to modern lights, have the apostles seemed, but no less in their case than in that of their great prototypes was their very narrowness of vision a means of success. Natives, like children, do not understand half-measures. If their gods were false gods, then was every custom con nected with their worship, whether mutilations of the body, or ornaments, or dances, or ceremonies, fit only for the most rigid prohibition. To gain an ascendancy over them, something more was wanted than the mere ingraft ing of a new belief upon their lives. Their own creeds were hedged about with talus, each enforced by the fear of death, and a religion without such prohibitions could not long hold their respect. So, from no calculating wisdom, they took unconsciously the wisest course and made their new code as uncompromising as that they were displacing. N"], [214, "194 MISSIONARIES. But now that the missionaries are only called upon to carry on the work founded by their predecessors, and know nothing of the danger their predecessors had to encounter, it is not astonishing that, among men recruited from a lower stratum of society and education, there should be some whose behaviour has detracted from the credit of the Alissionary Society, and that these have been taken by hostile critics as types of the body of which they are members. The two main charges brought against the missionaries of to-day are that they give a first place to the collection of money, and that they have introduced and kept alive among the natives the unedifying spectacle of warring Churches. To the first charge it may be answered that no Church ever was or ever will be carried on without funds, A Tongan schoolgirl. and it is surely to the credit of a mission that they should have induced the people whom they benefit to support their Church and schools instead of leaving them to make appeals to philanthropists for funds to carry on their work. For the missions are not con cerned only with the spiritual needs of the natives \u2014 they also do the great practical work of maintaining day schools in every village. The missionaries themselves"], [215, "FIRST BEGINNINGS. 195 would not deny that there have been grave abuses in the means adopted for obtaining subscriptions ; but these abuses have not been general, and they have been due to the fact that among the missionaries, as among every considerable body of men, there have been a few who were unworthy of the cause in which they were employed. The second charge is unfortunately true. I shall not speak of the Church of England Alission working in Melanesia, of the Presbyterian Alission of the New Hebrides, nor of the London Alission of Baratonga, Samoa, and New Guinea, for none of those Societies are concerned with Tonga ; but I shall confine myself to a review of the AVesleyan Methodist Alission of Australasia and the Bonian Catholic Alission of the Societe de Alarie. The Wesleyans sent their first missionary to Tonga in June 1822, and after three years' interruption they began work in earnest in 1826. There were two years of doubt and difficulty, three of slow but certain advance, and then they found themselves successful beyond their wildest hopes. With the conversion of King Josiah Aleamotu and of Taufaahau their cause was assured. The people followed their hereditary chiefs, and the heathen party became an ever-dwindling minority. Haapai and Aravau were Christian to a man : two-thirds of Tongatabu had embraced the new religion. Yet in the year 1835 we find this minority so hostile to Christianity that they are pre pared to fight rather than accept it. In 1837 they are actually embarked in the hopeless struggle against an overwhelming majority. In 1840 they have driven back their assailants, even when supported by an English ship of-war, and the hated missionaries are in flight. ATet there"], [216, "196 MISSIONARIES. was no advance on their side, no plundering nor laying waste after the manner of the cruel savages the mission aries represent them to be. With the discomfiture of their aggressors they seem to ask only for peace. The story of these events, as told by the missionary historians, lacks cohesion. The finger of Providence, it is true, is pointed in every page. We are invited to shudder at the dark - mindedness of the heathen who reject the proffered salvation ; to thrill at the virtue of the Christian troops fighting in a holy crusade ; to feel a glow of triumph as we read of the fall of each heathen town ; to pity the peace-loving missionaries forced into war's alarms, but enduring all things for compassion of their erring flock ; and yet, when we have read it all, there is a sense of something kept back. Missionary records are unfortunately never remarkable for lucidity. They were not penned for the eye of an unsympathetic public, nor should we expect them to be impartial histories of public events. They were written with a purpose, by men who A'iewed all things by the light of their appointed task; who classed all events, all native customs and ceremonies, as helping or retarding \" the Avork \" ; who revelled in iconoclasm, destroying recklessly with that narrowness of vision which is the characteristic of all human evan gelists ; who saw divine interposition in the most trivial occurrences of their liA*es. To advance their cause money was necessary, and to win money from a cold and in different public, compassion for their hardships and sym pathy with their self-sacrifice had to be aroused. It is an ungrateful and even a dangerous task to read between the lines of these records ; yet, since they are our only"], [217, "A MISSION ACCOUNT OF THE AVAR. 197 published sources of information, I may be acquitted of a wish to detract from a really great work if I submit them to the tests from which even sacred history is no longer exempt. The principal facts, as related by the missionaries, are these. AVith the con\\*ersion of the higher chiefs Chris tianity spread with a rapidity that proved the direct interposition of Providence. Five years later there re mained but a minority inspired by the evil one to resist the truth. Not content to remain heathen, they took up arms in the cause of Antichrist, and even made their religious differences an excuse to rebel against the civil authority of their king. Two reasons are assigned for their hostility : they \" set themselves to the task of up rooting Christianity,\" and \" they were an army of rebels, fighting against their earthly aud their heaA'enly sove reign.\" A more grievous thing followed : they received into their midst the \" emissaries of Borne,\" and their last state was worse than the first. The mission party fought, we are repeatedly assured, not as Christians against heathen, but as soldiers of the State against rebels ; and the missionaries visited the besiegers morning and even ing to give them the consolations of religion, while the French \" Jack priests,\" as the Bev. Air A^onge is pleased to call his fellow-workers, stayed within the walls of the fort, and encouraged the heathen in their seditious resist ance to lawful authority. Several questions occur to the reader of this narrative. If the war was really a mere civil disturbance, it is strange that the line of cleavage between loyalists and rebels should have been the same as that which separated the"], [218, "198 MISSIONARIES. Christians from the heathen. If the heathen were the aggressors, why do we always find them in the position of besieged rather than of besiegers ? If, on the other hand, they were simply fighting for liberty to dissent from the majority, they can scarcely have been the aggressors ; and indeed for persons fighting \" for the express purpose of destroying their king, Avhom they hated on account of his religion, and of slaughtering all his Christian subjects,\" they showed a singular neglect of their own interests, for they allowed King Aleamotu to return to his friends after he had voluntarily placed himself within their power. With questions such as these to solve, the reader feels that if he accepts the statement that the civil war in Tonga was the work of the \" great enemy of God and man,\" he must also admit that, with diabolical cunning, the devil chose the pious missionaries as his instruments for producing strife. If the missionaries succeeded in blinding themselves regarding the origin of these wars, they did not deceive the natives. In October 1893 it was my good fortune to find Akesa, the daughter of Lavaka, chief of Bea, still living in Fiji as a pensioner-servant of a mission family, \u2014 bright-eyed and intelligent for all her seventy years. From her relationship to the chief of the heathen party, she had been selected by King George to carry messages to and from the enenij*, and had been present both at the death of Captain Croker and the fall of Bea. She began her narrative with the words, \" \\rou must know that there were three wars to make the heathen turn to Christianity.\" Besides the missionaries there was but one Avriter who was an eye-witness of the disturbances of 1840. Com-"], [219, "199 THE REAL CAUSE. modore Wilkes of the United States navy, after vainly endeavouring to mediate between the two belligerent parties, did not hesitate to lay some of the blame of the war at the door of the missionaries, thereby calling clown upon himself a torrent of vituperation from their apolo gists. He hints that they had it within their power to avert the bloodshed by consenting to allow the heathen freedom of choice, but that they would listen to no terms but the enforced conversion of the enemy to Christianity. Whether they were or were not to blame, the war of 1840 did not leave them scatheless. When H.AI.S. Favourite left the island after the disaster at Bea, we are told that the surviving officers \" took with them the two mission aries, Alessrs Tucker and Babone, with their families.\" Commodore AAllkes is more explicit. He says that the Christian party, the aggressors, were put to flight, and that the missionaries hastened away from the storm they had provoked and were powerless to allay. The mis_sionaries have accused AVilkes of a bias against them, and of \" a strange prejudice in favour of man in his savage state \" : it is therefore fair to compare the state ment of an observer who was confessedly an admirer of the great results they had accomplished. Commodore Erskine, who visited the group in 1853, writes : \u2014 I am indeed bound in justice to remark that in respect of their treatment of the people here [in Haapai] and in Vavau, the gentlemen of this mission do not compare favourably with those of the London Society in the Samoan islands.

The missionaries seemed also to live much more apart from the natives than in Samoa, where free access is allowed to them at all times. Here, on the contrary, the gates of the enclosures were not merely kept closed, but sometimes locked, \u2014 a precaution against intrusion which, although perhaps warranted in some degree by the custom of fencing their grounds, and by the greater propensity on the part of these people to theft, I never saw adopted elsewhere, and which must operate unfavourably to that freedom of intercourse so necessary to the establishment of perfect confidence between the pastors and their flock. If the missionaries were overbearing to the chiefs even at that early date, a light is thrown upon the curious persistence with which some of them clung to paganism. The ancient beliefs of the Bolynesians never formed a system of religion, and, to compare small things with great, as the way was already smoothed for Christianity by the growing scepticism of the Boman empire, so were the minds of the Tongan chiefs ripe to seize upon any religious creed with a more logical foundation than the worn-out mummeries of their own ancestor-worship. Ber haps the ancient priestcraft, with its exactions of votive offerings and its hysterical oracles, would have shared the fate of its forgotten predecessor, phallus-worship, had the priests been less politic and tactful. But they knew that the existence of their order depended upon the union of Church and State ; and their oracular utterances, plastic as those of Delphi, were directed always to upholding the privileges of the chiefs. Between the two orders there"], [221, "201 A WORN-OUT HEATHEN CREED. was a thorough understanding. The chief saw that the regular offerings to the spirits were not stinted ; the priest, possessed by his god, retained sufficient self-com- mand to gasp prophecies in re markable accordance with the chief's interest. That they, like the Augurs, could meet without grinning, was doubtless clue to the grim reality of the risk that often attached to the sacerdotal office ; for was not the priest of Tubou Totai already doomed to be strangled for failing to restore Finau's daughter, when sudden death overtook his patron? Even seventeen years before the arrival of the first missionaries, the chiefs did not care to con ceal their scepticism ; and per haps, if the tragic death of Finau had not seemed so signal a re- A^enge of the outraged gods, the missionaries would have found that the ancient faith had crumbled away of itself before their arrival.

The opposition came from the chiefs them-"], [222, "202 MISSIONARIES. selves, inspired thereto, not as the good missionaries tell us, by the \" great enemy of God and man,\" but by what has since proved to be a well-grounded alarm for the safety of their order. Some of them were shrewd enough to see in the new creed a political system that struck directly at their privileges. In Tonga, as in Galilee and in Borne, the first Christian convert was a commoner. The chiefs, who held that their inferiors possessed no souls, learned with dismay that in the sight of the missionaries all men, not ministers of the Gospel, are equal ; that one law was to bind the chief and his serf alike \u2014 that the proudest aristocracy in the world Avere to be abased to the level of the meanest plebeian. Their real stumbling - block was the socialism of Christianity ; for the Tongan chiefs having, like Nicodemus, great posses- sions, were not masters of the higher Biblical criticism that has adapted the creed to the social inequalities that clash with its teachings. To them the new system seemed to strike directly at the privileges of their order. Their power rested upon superstition, hardened and cemented by long custom, and to admit mere foreigners to superior authority was to lower them in the eyes of their sub jects. They did not resist the new teachers, they simply claimed the liberty to dissent from the majority, \u2014 a liberty which of all others men are least willing to grant to one another. Missionaries are by the nature of their calling in tolerant. Tolerance in an evangelist is a sign that he is unfit for his mission. If Alessrs Babone and Tucker had been the men to discourage their new converts from coercing the heathen, they would not have achieved their"], [223, "203 THE SOCIALISiAI OF CHRISTIANITY. remarkable success. Expecting hardships, disappoint ments, and possibly martyrdom, they suddenly found themselves the most powerful persons in the country. Whatever measure of influence the chiefs possessed, that they were able to exert for the furtherance of their cause ; and, as the unrealised possibilities of their position were borne in upon them, they gave God the praise, and began to make their power felt on their own account. The chiefs whose favour they had courted were now to discover that these foreigners, who had so meekly sought their pro tection, were, as the vicars on earth of a great and ter rible Otua, to assume their rightful position of superiority. Henceforth the chiefs must pay to them the deference they had themselves received from their inferiors. Small wonder that, to those who still hesitated, this new portent of the secular power of the priesthood, never admitted under their heathen system, became so insurmountable a difficulty that they chose rather to cleave to their heathen gods and their independence. It is easy to blame the missionaries after the event, to point to the lessons of history by which they might have been guided, and to forget that if they had been of that cool and calculating temper that is capable of founding a policy upon the teachings of history, they would never have come to Tonga.

As in the fifteenth century the Popes, the successors of Peter the fisherman, exacted the obeis ance of sovereigns, so (to strain a comparison) the follow ers of Him who took the world for His parish claimed from the chiefs of Tonga the same marks of respect as were paid to them by their own vassals.

While they were complacently receiving the homage of their flock, when they reproved the chief Vuke for presum ing to stand in their presence ; when they humbled the chiefs and exalted the commoners ; when they taught their flocks the rudiments of a representative government ; when they allowed the natives to see their thirst for money, \u2014 they were infecting their cause with the disease of which it is now dying : while they Avrangled with the priests of the rival Church, and taught the natives that to worship their crucified God with a visible crucifix was a degree lower than the heathenism they had cast away, they drilled with their own hands the holes by which their ship has foundered. There are many who blame Air Baker only for the deplorable state of things that has made the AAresleyan Church in Tonga a byword throughout the southern hemisphere. Baker was not alone to blame. He must share the responsibility with the founders of the mission who begat the traditions of temporalities exacted by the ministry, of intolerance of rival creeds, and of the auri fames which their successors have inherited. It is difficult to say which mission is most to blame for the unseemly antagonism which they displayed towards each other. The AVesleyans have reproached the Boman Catholic priests with having joined and assisted the king's enemies in a rebellion against his authority, and so justify themselves for revding them to the half-converted natives. The reproach seems to me to be in a great measure unde served. The French priests found that the Protestant missionaries had failed to convert a large body of the natives, \u2014 that they had even sanctioned an attack upon"], [226, "206 ODIUM THEOLOGICUM. them by the forces of the Protestant chiefs. AVhat more natural than that they should take their message to the heathen who had refused Protestantism than to natives who had already accepted it ? AVhat more natural than that they should retaliate with the same weapons for the slanders heaped upon them ? Is there a sadder picture in mission history than this, of men charged with the mes sage of peace and love, choosing this distant field to fight out their old quarrel, forcing their half-savage converts to take sides with them, proclaiming aloud their divine mes sage of peace and goodwill, and whispering gross slanders of one another into the Avondering ears of those whom they were sent to teach ? Had they made the civi lised world the umpire of their quarrel, we might have deplored the evil chance without blaming the combatants, but since they chose to submit their theological disputes to the judgment of half-tamed savages, no censure can be too severe for them. It is no compensation that they are punished for it, that in slandering one another they have damaged the cause of both for all time. Savages are logical : it is because they are too logical that we class their intelligence as inferior to our own. These men came to teach them peace, and bade them love one another, and with the same breath they declared that the other foreign ers who were preaching the same doctrine were liars and worse. If these foreigners, they argued, thus disagreed among themselves about their religion, how was it more true than the teachings of their own priests ? If, while commanding to love, they could thus hate one another, which of the commandments of God need be read liter ally ?

As soon as the people had grasped the idea that their foreign leaders were not themselves aboA*e criticism, they rushed into the field of sectarian strife with the same savage ardour that had fired them in battle a few years before. The Gospel was true, but its evangelists were fallible. They did well enough as leaders of the Church forces, but they were open to the free criticism of their own followers. Of the means used by the missionaries to inflame the natives against their rivals I might quote many instances. In the ' Apologia,' printed in France by the priests in the most atrocious Fijian, Martin Luther is described as a \" disgusting fellow,\" Wesley as a lying teacher, and the Beformation as brought about by Henry VIII. from even lower motives than those usually assigned to him by hos tile historians. The Wesleyans replied to this by a pamphlet printed in red ink in Fijian, intituled ' A Cate chism concerning the Catholic Church,' from which I take a few extracts : \u2014 6. Q. Do they adduce evidence of their teachings from the Bible 1 A. Certainly not. Nor has their religion at any time been general throughout the world. 7. Q. Is it right that they should be called disciples of Christ 1. A. This is strangely like false teachings and evil deeds, and therefore we disbelieve them. 17. Q. AVhy do not the Papists injure people in England and other countries in these days 1 A. Because it is forbidden in the law of the land, and because the people of the true faith are numerous in some countries, and it is therefore impossible."], [228, "208 ODIUM THEOLOGIGUM. 20. Q. Is not he [the priest] perhaps a deceiver 1 A. In very truth he is. He is like an animal that conceals its claws, and pretends to be inoffensive and tame, and some times snaps and bites. 32. Q. Are men tortured there [in Boman Catholic countries] 1 A. There are many Papists in Borne ; and if any one declares the evils of the Popish Church, he is seized in the night and dragged to the House of Inquisition, and shut up there, and is probably never seen again. 120. Q. Alay we not do anything to check those that in jure us 1 A. Yes, if we do it in a lawful manner, but not in a spirit of anger, but quietly, that good may come of it. 121. Q. How then\"? Is it right that we should feel ill-will towards them [the Catholics] 1 A. Certainly not ; for Jesus bade us love our enemies. 131. Q. Can a priest lie ? A. It is true that many do so, because they are taught that it is allowable, if it be to the glory of God. 134. Q. Is it your meaning that it is lawful for the priests or the Papists to lie if they think that it would be of service to their Church when truth would not serve it 1 A. It is so. They conceal their sins, and approve the liar, for they say that that which serves the Church of the Pope is to the glory of God. 151. Q. Cannot the Englishmen who live in those lands [Spain, Portugal, and Italy] practise their religion? A. Yes, for they cannot be altogether prevented : but they do it as strangers and very quietly ; and if they attempt to teach the people or distribute Bibles, they are dragged to prison or to the Inquisition. 182. Q. AVho is the \"Alan of Sin\" spoken of by Paul (2 Thess. ii.)? A. Wise and good men believe that it refers to the Pope."], [229, "AN ACTION FOR SLANDER. 209 223. Q. Is it true that they [the priests] beat people of the lower orders ? A. Y\"es. The priests of Ireland take staves and whips, and sometimes beat grown men, and they say nothing. 237. Q. AVhat will the Popish priests say of this Catechism? A. Alas ! that it is all lies, and that not a word of it is true. 238. Q. AVhat ! are we to disapprove of it if they say this ? A. Certainly not, &c, &c. Such is a fair translation of passages selected from this remarkable document, which, it is to be feared, will be criticised by others than the priests in the terms antici pated by the writer in answer No. 237. Air Aloore, who prostituted his excellent Fijian scholarship to such an end, does not bear the odium of this production alone, for, with a few redeeming exceptions, none of the missionary body have had the taste and Christian feeling to withhold their approbation. The pamphlet was widely distributed among the natives, but whenever the priests could hear of the existence of a copy, they immediately bought it up. As lately as the end of 1892 a Air Chapman, one of the AVesleyan missionaries in Fiji, whose excuse for his con duct was that he was returning evil for evil, translated to a public meeting of Fijians, which Boman Catholics were compelled to attend, some revoltingly horrible stories, printed by Father Chiniquy, the Canadian priest who left the Boman Church after fifty years' ministration as a priest, and published two of the most obscene books in the English language. The priests, conceiving the stories to be applied personally to two of their number, sued Chapman in the Supreme Court of the colony, and though they lost their case, they had the satisfaction of hearing n"], [230, "210 ODIUM THEOLOGIGUM. the defendant's conduct reprobated by the Chief-Justice as it deserved. Nothing abashed, the Wesleyan body rallied to the support of their calumnious brother, and appealed to the public to subscribe the costs of his defence. Gradually the fervour of the first converts gave place to the mere heat of partisanship. The Churches flourished simply from their rivalry with each other. The Wesley ans poured their offerings into the missionary-basins as a defiance to the taunts of the Boman Catholics. The Catholics flocked to the church festivals to prove the superior attractions of their form of worship. But after the fall of Bea, and the consequent conversion of the heathen to one Church or the other, the active quarrels between the two missions began to die down. The AVes leyans were the strongest, and the Catholics saw that they could gain nothing by over - zeal in proselytising. The king and most of the influential chiefs were on the other side, and the attractions of pictures, music, and processions in their services did not outweigh the pleasures of being allowed to pray and preach, which were permitted to every AVesleyan who had a turn in that direction. As an intelligent AAresleyan in Fiji once put it in accounting for the popularity of his Church, \" among the Catholics there is no torotoro (promotion). In our Church we may hold family prayers twice a - day, and one may be a local preacher without ever entering the ministry. If that is not enough, one may enter the ministry and at last be ordained like the white clergy, and may preach continually, waxing hot in the discourse. The Papists have none of these pleasures. They may only listen to the priests without ever being allowed to preach.\""], [231, "211 MISSION COLLECTIONS. The AVesleyan missionaries had made two mistakes \u2014 they had humbled the chiefs, and they had vilified their rivals. They were now to make a third. Political power was in their grasp, and with the fearlessness of deep ignorance they rushed on their doom. Brought up in Australia to believe that universal suffrage and repre sentative government is the nearest approach to Utopia attainable by mortal man, they persuaded the king and chiefs against their better judgment to exchange the ancient communal system for a bran-new constitution on the English plan. Those who have seen the machine at work in the Australian colonies will know best how it Avas to behave in Tonga. They had sealed the fate of their own cause. The commoners, accustomed to let their chief think for them, now found themselves free to think and act as their inclinations led them, and the first result was a weakening of the influence of the missionaries, who began to find the smattering of education they had given to their native helpers a source of danger. The native ministers had a vote in their district meetings, aud began to exercise it independently. Awkward questions were whispered about salaries. AVhat was the difference between the foreigner and the Tongan, that the one should have \u00a3200 a-year and a wooden house, and the other \u00a320 and a grass hut ? AATien Air Baker brought his acquisi tive genius to bear upon the system of mission collections, the conference in Sydney had still the absolute disposal of the funds, and the country was annually drained of many thousands of dollars over and above the cost of local expenditure. Demands were not unnaturally made for a share in the disposal of this money, and, as I have"], [232, "212 ODIUM THEOLOGIGUM. related elsewhere, the Conference unwisely resisted the demand for home -rule until it was too late, and Air Baker had gone over to the enemy and founded the Free Church. Then all the dormant fires of sectarian hatred burst out afresh. The majority of the native ministers, tempted by the promise of higher salaries, went over in a body to a Church in which they had greater liberty, higher pay, and a satisfied feeling of patriotism. They scarcely needed Baker's encouragement to persecute the minority that remained faithful, for they knew that upon the universality of the new Church depended their ap pointments. The old, regarding them as traitors, would neA'er have taken them back except at a great disadvan tage. So they persecuted, and thereby awoke in their opponents all the obstinacy of the Tongan character. The old Church flourished under persecution as Churches always have flourished. Left contemptuously alone, it might possibly have died a natural death : under the shadow of a promise of martyrdom, some of the vigour of its lost youth returned to it. But the life-giving fire was party spirit, not religious feeling. From the estab lishment of the Free Church dates the real overthrow of devotional earnestness among the Tongans. The change had been long impending, for the temperament of the people is incapable of a steady warmth. A fire of enthusiasm that had blazed so fiercely must needs soon smoulder away into ashes. Henceforward the form only survived \u2014 the spirit had burnt itself out. AVith the Free Church a fourth party, who mockingly called themselves the Lotu jio or \" Looking-on Church,\" came into existence. They were the lukewarm, who"], [233, "PERSECUTION. 213 had now an excuse for declaring their indifference. For the sake of peace they professed to belong to the Free Church, but they attended none of the services, and in reality they belonged to no Church at all. The Boman Catholics, as neutrals, sucked no small advantage out of the quarrel, for they opened their doors to all those who feared to be Wesleyans and refused to be Free Churchmen. It is a compliment to the Bev. J. E. Aloulton to say that, in their hour of need, the AAresleyans were un fortunate in their champion. They wanted a rough handed fighting man, cool, thick-skinned, and not over scrupulous, who would meet such a man as Baker on his own ground, and fight him with his own weapons. They had instead a gentleman and a scholar, full of generous impulses and enthusiasm, a born teacher, whose field was the class-room, not the atmosphere of low political intrigue. Against each successive outrage his only resource was protest ; and until it was too late and he had earned the king's enmity, he failed to see that calm good-humoured toleration of insult might have under mined Baker's influence where indignant remonstrance only served to strengthen his position. He left all the fighting to his coadjutor, \u2014 a gentleman with a natural turn for litigation, whose ill-directed efforts, while they embarrassed the native Government, inflamed the chiefs of the Free Church against the people he was endeav ouring to serve. These missionaries were unable to realise that the steadfastness of their followers was obstinancy under the lash of persecution rather than the fire of religious"], [234, "214 ODIUM TIIEOLOGICUM. conviction. The tenets of the new Church were the same as those of the old, and therefore no conscientious scruples could have weighed with the inflexible minority. They were held really by the natural repugnance of every man of independent character to being bullied into doing a thing he has at first refused. But the mission aries expected that, as soon as the removal of Air Baker put an end to persecution, the people would flock back to their old Church. They were bitterly disappointed when they found that A*ery few of their old adherents cared to do so. The truth was that the old Church had become unfashionable, now that its members could no longer have the distinction of aspiring to martyrdom. Indifference had permeated the new Church aud the old alike. People still went to church because the king did, and because it was the sole opportunity for the display of new clothes ; but they dropped religion from their con- Arersation, and spoke of their respective Churches only as political organisations. The AVesleyan Conference had withdrawn Air Aloulton, and substituted for him one of their ordinary ministers, ignorant of the Tongan language and character, who found himself confronted with an un expected difficulty. The returned exiles from Fiji, of whom the majority of their leading men were composed, had been spoilt by the fuss that had been made over them. Their natural conceit as Tongans had been so fostered by their admiring friends, that they would no longer submit to the control of any foreigner were he a hundred times their minister. Perhaps the antagonism to Europeans, which the early missionaries in their war against the traders had so industriously cultivated, was"], [235, "215 THE MISSION CODE. partly responsible for this. The missionary found himself outvoted by the members of his own district meeting, and the last vestige of the power of the missionaries was gone. One of the strangest features in this struggle of op posing forces was the unwitting modification in the Chris tian code as taught by the missionaries themselves. The people were polygamists. Their climate, physique, and mode of life conduced to incontinence, which, however, was kept in check by a severe social code of their own. This the missionaries swept away. For the dread of immediate physical punishment which the people felt, the mission aries tried to substitute the fear of retribution in another world, \u2014 a contingency too remote to have much weight with them. The standard of social morality, neA'er very high, was at once lowered, and the astonished missionaries tried in vain to stem the flowing tide with every penalty they could invent and enforce. Gradually their own sense of proportion became warped. The seventh command ment overshadowed all the others in their mental horizon. The police, taking their cue from the Sunday sermon, let felons go their way, and spent all their energies in tracking down philanderers. Even the Legislature, copy ing the early missionary codes, gave such a prominence to offences against the social laws, that, provided a man kept the seventh commandment in its widest application, he might commit almost any other crime in the calendar. The change in the temper of the people has not taken place without a corresponding change in the spirit of the missionaries. Tonga and Fiji are no longer regarded as the fields for men of special talents. The young men sent"], [236, "216 ODIUM TEEOLOGICUM. there by the Conference in Australia seem to be chosen at haphazard from among the ordinary recruits for the Wes leyan ministry. They themselves appear to regard their mission as a profession rather than as a call, and to attach greater importance to the details of church government than to the spirit of missionary enterprise. Few of them are sufficiently interested in the natives to care to learn more of their inner life than has a direct bearing upon their church membership. I may even say without harsh ness that their chief efforts are devoted to securing ade quate collections, and to defeating the work of their rivals, the Boman Catholics. From the ' Methodist Missionary Beview' of November 1892 I take the following ingenuous passage from the pen of the most active among the present missionaries in Fiji : \" Our average for the past three years has been \u00a31000 a - year. Some of our mountain sections have greatly increased their subscriptions, so that I do not walk hundreds of miles across the awful paths of Colo for nothing.\" In another place the same writer jocosely alludes to a curious system of remuneration : \" Now there arose a new Alission Board over the brethren in foreign fields, and they said \u2014 through the General Secretary \u2014 ' Behold, the children of these missionaries are more and mightier every year ; come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and cause a debit balance in the annual accounts.' So it has come to pass that the brethren in the foreign fields have been notified that a reduction of five guineas per annum will be made on all children bom after the 31st December next.\" One cannot forbear wondering whether this heartless order had the desired effect."], [237, "217 THE FATE OF THE MISSIONS. The experience of Hawaii, New Zealand, Tonga, and Fiji, goes to teach us that the acti\\*e life of Christian missions in the South Seas is from fifty to seventy years. A mission was founded in New Zealand by Air Marsden in 1814. The missionaries, being men of a lower class than those who laboured in Polynesia, used their oppor tunities for acquiring private property in land, a fact that, among a people so earth-hungry as the Polynesians, may have precipitated the crisis. Hauhauism, that strange compound of Christianit)' and paganism, broke out in 1865, and finally quenched the spark of life that remained to the mission after the war. The mission in Tonga, founded in 1822 by Air Lawry, and shattered by the dissensions of 1887, enjoyed an active life of sixty-five years. The AVesleyan mission in Fiji, founded in 1837, is already showing evident signs of decay. I do not allude to the practice of Tv.ka (Immor tality), a pagan cult curiously like Hauhauism, which was put down by the Government in 1887, and has since reap peared at intervals, but to that general inanition that has proved fatal to the Church in Tonga. Nor is this sur prising when one remembers upon how slender a base most of these conversions rest. A vast majority of Ton gans and Fijians embraced Christianity because, for poli tical reasons, it suited their chiefs to do so. One who was present at the conversion of an entire tribe in Fiji once gaA'e me an account of the ceremony. A great feast was made for the missionary, who took his seat by the side of the chief. The heathen priest, taking a kava root in his hand, thus addressed the ancestor-gods : \" This is the paltry feast which we, your poverty - stricken children,"], [238, "218 ODIUM THEOLOGIGUM. have made for you. It is our farewell to you : do not be angry with us that we are going to leave you for a time. AVe are your children, but for a time we are going to worship the god of the foreigners : nevertheless, be not angry with us ! \" Then the gods consumed the spiritual essence of the meat, and the missionary and his suite ate its grosser material fibre and enjoyed it very much. To the converted native the heathen gods are not always false gods ; they continue to exist, but they have been deserted for a time in favour of the gods of the foreigners. This is why relapses into heathenism on the part of the most promising converts will always be so dangerously easy. The spirits of their ancestors are to them what Baal and Bimmon were to the people of Israel \u2014 existing beings, who may at any time become malignant and demand propitiatory sacrifice. With so thin a curtain drawn between the old and the new faith, the fickleness of the natives, and the coolness that always follows hard upon the white heat of conversion, have doubtless each contributed their share to the decay of mission influ ence ; but I venture to assert that the main cause has been the unseemly dissension between the Churches, and the enlistment of the natives in feuds utterly un worthy of the Christianity the missionaries profess to be teaching. I do not forget that the Wesleyans were first in the field, and that all these evils might have been avoided if, as in British New Guinea, the Churches had agreed upon exclusive spheres of influence, with well-defined boun daries for each mission. But the time for that has gone by, and it remains for the missions to look to the concli-"], [239, "219 APOLOGIA. tions of their A*ery existence in a spirit of mutual concilia tion and tolerance. It is an ungrateful task to endeavour to pass a friendly criticism upon so privileged a body as the missionaries. No one has yet attempted it without being accused of blind prejudice or envy that wilfully ignores the good in order to drag into a false prominence the defects from which no great undertaking is free. If I seem to have erred in speaking strongly of imperfections that continue to suck the life-blood of the mission, it is because they might easily be removed if the missionaries could clear their eyes from the petty irritations of the moment, and see that their real interests lie in following the doctrine they are teaching \u2014 to have charity one toward another. Their predecessors achieved a great work. They found the natives almost irredeemable savages, and they so far influenced their outward lives that every man, woman, and child in the islands is a professing Christian ; but they are going far towards casting away this precious result for want of a little patience and self - restraint. No one can admire more than I the admirable work that has been done : no one can more deplore the waste of so great an opportunity."], [240, "220 XIV. AMATEUR LAAV-GIVING. The dismissed Premier was not only a spiritual and tem poral dignitary, he was also the lawgiver of Tonga ; yet it was only in the most limited sense that he united the qualities of Aioses and Alelchisedec. It has been the fate of Tonga to furnish the vile body on which the legislative experiments of amateurs haA*e been tried. The first written code of law in Tongan history was promulgated in Vavau in 1839, and, crude though it was, it may be doubted whether it was not far better suited to the people than the elaborate but often incoherent effusions of the missionary lawyers of later days. It was King George's own composition, and it was intended for his own people only, to be ad ministered by judges of his own race. There was a long preamble filled with Biblical quotations, after which follow a few plain straightforward clauses such as the following : \u2014 It is my mind : That the land should be brought into culti vation and be planted. Hence, I inform you it is unlawful for yon to turn your hogs outside the sty. If a hog be found"], [241, "THE FIRST CODE. 221 eating the yams, or destroying the produce of the land, the owner of the hog shall be at once informed that he may shut the hog up, and he shall restore whatsoever be damaged.

Hitherto the laws had merely expressed in writing the prohibitions that already existed in the native mind, but for which no fixed punishment had been stipulated. The government by chiefs was defined and their powers de scribed, but it was the same form of government that had been in force since the social organisation of the people was crystallised out of the primitive family. King George \u2014 to his credit be it said \u2014 long resisted the importunities of the missionaries to grant his people a Constitution, aud ape the form of government evolved in Europe from centuries of civilisation. The people were not ready for it, he said. It might suit England very well. There the people were perhaps accustomed to think for themselves, but the Tongans were wont to let their chiefs think for them. The Tongans had reached a stage of development mid way between the patriarchal and feudal systems. Their chiefs had the blood of the founder of the family in its purest form, and were the earthly incarnation of their deified ancestors. Each chief had hereditary retainers who followed him to battle, and obeyed him in time of peace ; but the constant wars during the latter half of the eighteenth century had created a lower class of ser vants than these \u2014 the tu'a, children of prisoners of war. These, together with the illegitimate children of the chief's father or grandfather (his cousins, in fact, for a chief bred servants for his descendants), were in the nature of serfs, leading, however, an easier life than such a designation would imply. The missionaries had perhaps read of Beter the Great and AVilberforce, and they too panted to win the grateful admiration of posterity. To"], [243, "223 THE CONSTITUTION GRANTED. their heated fancy the people appeared as slaves, because they yielded service without fixed wages, and nothing would content them but a formal liberation. They did not stop to reflect that these \" serfs \" were fed and clothed by their chief, and that as members of his household they enjoyed privileges which men of their low rank could not hope for in other societies. If they were contented, they ought to be taught a noble discontent, and to pine for the Anglo-Saxon fetish, freedom. King George, as he hoped to be saved, must \" liberate the serfs.\" In 1862 he yielded, and signed a bran-new Constitution, drawn up by the missionaries, after a model devised for the King of Hawaii by a Air St Julian. On the 4th of June 1862 there was a solemn meeting of the newly con stituted Parliament. In the intervals of feasting the code was passed, and at the end of two months the legislators dispersed, leaving the land as bare as if a swarm of locusts had passed over it. The missionary historian waxes emo tional as he tells of how they contrived to eat 150,000 large yams and 9000 hogs, besides other provisions, and of how they feasted daily at a board spread in Euro pean fashion, clad in decent black broadcloth and white chokers, to the glory of God and the triumph of mis sionary statecraft. This code was considerably altered, \u2014 I reject the word \"amended\" advisedly, \u2014 and in 1875 a complete penal code, far too elaborate for the Tongans, yet infinitely better than the pretentious laws that afterwards repealed it, was passed by the native Parliament. From 1875 to 1888 Air Baker tried his 'prentice hand at legislation. He altered the Constitution four times, and he drafted"], [244, "224 AMATEUR LAW-GIVING. and passed laws and ordinances whenever the fit took him, until the body of law had become so confused and conflicting that not even a Blackstone could have cut a path through its thorny labyrinths. Some of these laws were not even read to the Barliament that passed them : more than a few were enacted in English, and never trans lated into Tongan. Of these, some were printed in the ' Gazette ' in English ; others had not even this courtesy extended to them. The fatal ease of legislation bred in the Bremier's mind a kind of disease \u2014 Lcgislatitis \u2014 until every idea that flitted through his facile imagination was crystallised into an ordinance, and the cause of every passing annoyance Avas made penal by enactment. Some one remarked that the wild cluck were becoming scarce : an ordinance was passed to preserve them. A ship-of war was disappointed in not finding coal : a statute con verted Nukualofa into a coaling-station for foreign ships. Some urchins shouted \" Sail ho ! \" on the beach near the Premier's office : to cry \" Sail ho ! \" became forthwith a penal offence. Alany of these enactments were extremely unpopular ; but the wily Premier knew how to let the fury of the mob beat upon other heads than his, and generally caused his laws to be promulgated the day after he sailed for one of his frequent holidays to New Zealand. By the time he returned the people had become accus tomed to them. The confused state of the law had a remarkable effect upon the magistrates. The only written law Avithin their reach had been so often altered and repealed that they had come to rely for their decisions not upon the written law, but upon the verbal directions of the Brime Alinister."], [245, "ABUSE OF THE COURTS. 225 I myself came at last to admit the advantages of this system, since, when I declined to give them advice upon cases sub judicc, much of my time was occupied in ap peasing consular representatives for illegalities practised by the courts upon the subjects of foreign Bowers. If I had attempted to right the wrongs of Tongans suffered at the hands of their own magistrates, I should have had time for nothing else. The stumbling-block of the magis trates was the subtlety of their reasoning. Not long before my arrival three men were indicted for stealing a pig. It transpired in the evidence that two of them had agreed to keep watch while the third committed the theft. \" This,\" said his worship, \" was no ordinary theft ; it was con spiracy ! \" He found that his law-book defined conspiracy as a synonym for talisone (treason), and the punishment provided for talisone was twenty years' penal servitude. These criminals were said to be languishing in prison when the general amnesty that followed Air Baker's fall set them at liberty. The pliancy of the police magistrates made them, in the hands of a Free Church Government, ready instruments of persecution. The courts took their bias from the atti tude of the Executive. Every law that could be made to bear hardly upon the Wesleyans was strained to their dis comfort. By an abuse of the land laws they were deprived of their holdings. In places where the minister was the only AVesleyan, he was charged with neglecting to keep the church lands weeded \u2014 each enclosure being treated as a separate cause of offence \u2014 and imprisoned in default of paying the enormous fines imposed upon him. For all these abuses Air Baker has, with some injustice, been p"], [246, "226 AMATEUR LAW-GIVING. made personally responsible. He, it is true, gave the bias to the courts, but, once started on their devastating way, the magistrates in their crass stupidity went to lengths he would have repudiated had he dared. They were generally men of inferior calibre. Tongotea, the most notorious, was a handsome, bright-eyed man of about fifty, too young to be naturally tolerant, too old to be reformed. In the missionary reports on the Church troubles his name recurs as often as Air Baker's in these pages. Execrated by the missionaries, he was not less hated by the traders for his habitual discourtesy and dis like to Europeans when on the bench. He was too hardened an offender to realise that the old order had changed, and we had at last to yield to the continued petitions for his dismissal. At the beginning of 1888 the confusion in the laws had become such a scandal that Air Baker determined to codify them. He lacked either the courage or the energy to submit his code to Parliament, and he therefore passed an Act empowering him to \" re\\*ise \" the code of laws and print them in Tongan and English \u2014 surely the widest power ever conferred upon an individual in the history of representative government. At the end of two years he had written the English version and about half the Tongan. I have it on the authority of the pundits \u2014 native and European \u2014 that the Tongan version was so full of errors as to be quite unintelligible ; but it is possible that in his anxiety to retain his position as legal adviser to the magistrates, he intentionally made their path thorny and difficult. The English version is entitled to rank high among the"], [247, "227 A LITERARY CURIOSITY. curiosities of literature. If compositors turned loose with all the known founts of capitals can alone make a code, then the work was a monument to jurists ; but, since the lavishness of printer's art only brings into greater promi nence confusion in arrangement, gross contradictions, and vital omissions, the Ministry were justified in not feeling proud of a production for the revision of which they had to pay a bill of fifty guineas to a solicitor in Auckland. But regarded merely as a literary \" sport,\" it was well worth the money.

Did the reA-erend jurist mean that if the poisoned person dies he shall be considered guilty of murder, but that if he (the unfortunate victim) be known before the death of some one else, it {i.e., the poison, the water, or the death) shall be considered manslaughter ? And if not this, what did he mean ?

A Tongan who wished to strike his enemy had first to ascertain whether he had children. These are only two out of the many claims put forth by the late Bremier in this wonderful book to a high place among the un conscious humourists of literature. Following the general policy of complicating the ad ministrative machinery of the tiny State, the law estab lished a vast number of unnecessary law courts. There were (1) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; (2) the Supreme Court; (3) the three District Courts; (4) the Police Courts. There were thus three appeals against a decision of the police court, and each appeal brought in fees. Even in criminal cases the unfortunate defendant Avas mulcted in fees which had to be worked off in the form of additions to his term of imprisonment. Besides these courts there were \u2014 the Probate Court, the Divorce Court, the Admiralty Court, the Lands Court, and Courts-Martial, for none of which was any form of procedure laid down. In the case of disputed wills I found the practice to be for one claimant to seize the property, and for the other to prosecute him for larceny. In one case an unfortunate widow was convicted at the suit of her stepson of stealing her late husband's house in which she was living. AVe condemned this code on its first hearing. No amount of amendment could make it work. The Tongan version was unintelligible ; the English was ridiculous. Nothing less than a new code would meet the necessities of the case. I confess that at first I recoiled from the toil of drafting a code, translating it into Tongan, taking it through Parliament, and passing both volumes through"], [249, "229 DRAFTING THE CODE. the press with compositors ignorant of the language they were setting up. The work must be done in odd hours, snatched from arduous administrative duties, in a period of less than six months. I succeeded, and a consideration of the difficulties against which I had to contend should soften the harsher criticisms that may be passed upon my code in the future. I worked upon the Indian Penal Code and the existing law of Tonga, using the plan of the former, and simplifying the latter as far as the constitu tion would let me. Working far into the night, I made my rough draft in English, and then with the help of a little shorthand writer, Pauli by name, I turned the draft into halting Tongan. This version went sheet by sheet to Tukuaho for conversion into elegant Tongan, and then came back to me for careful revision, lest the sense should have suffered in the process of decoration. Aly principal difficulty lay in the Constitution. Though the king readily consented to the abrogation of the laws, he had an almost superstitious dread of tampering with the Constitution. This attitude had its advantages when we wanted to silence our opponents of the Badical party in the House. We had only to point to the Constitution, which \" Tubou did not wish to alter,\" as a reason for re enacting an old statute, and the opposition collapsed ; but we were well aware that the pretentious document begin ning, \" Seeing it appears to be the Will of God for man to be free,\" with its complicated machinery, designed to deceive strangers into the belief that Tonga was a State growing in importance and prosperity, was utterly un stated to the Tongans. I had a strong objection to include in my code any matter couched in such wretched English"], [250, "230 AMATEUR LAAV-GIVING. \u2014 English of which a schoolboy would be ashamed. I was spared this necessity by an inspiration. Had not Air Baker himself declared that the Constitution was passed by a Tongan Legislature? It must therefore have been enacted in the native language, and the Tongan version was the original. I had only to translate it back into English, and my code would be cleansed of the phraseology that constitutes Air Baker's principal claim to distinction. Chief among the purely Tongan enactments of the new code were the land laws. In former times the soil of Tonga was vested in the Tui Tonga \u2014 the spiritual chief. The great nobles and small cultivators held their lands from him, and he had theoretically the right to dispossess them at will. AVhen the office of Tui Tonga became vacant, and the title was absorbed by the present king, the people readily adopted the idea that all the land was vested in the Crown who had the power to grant holdings in return for taxes. But in 1888, Air Baker, acting either under pressure from the chiefs, or spontaneously wishing to create a landed aristocracy, foolishly caused the king to grant large estates, which he called \" inheritances,\" to a number of hereditary lords, who were to receive from the tenants a rental of $1 per annum for each holding of about eight acres. In dealing with the land I could not hope to rid myself of these superfluous landlords, but I could, without evoking dangerous opposition, deprive them of all power over their estates. I determined to make the Crown collect their rents and pay it over to them, while reserving to itself all rights of granting allotments and evicting tenants. Thus for all practical purposes the land still belonged to the State ; for so long as the rents were"], [251, "THE LAND LAWS. 231 paid to the lords of the manor, the Government was virtually the landlord, and the king had voluntarily made over to the Treasury all rents due upon the lands not included within any \"inheritance.\" The chief obstacle that would confront every Govern ment in Tonga would always be the difficulty in collecting the poll-tax. The people required some stronger incentive to pay than the fear of levy by distress. To meet this difficulty I adopted an idea, suggested to me by Air Han slip, that the tenure of land should be made dependent upon the regular payment of taxes. I converted the poll tax into a land-tax, and gave to every taxpayer the right of occupying one allotment of a fixed area, inalienable in his family so long as he and his heirs continued to dis charge their debts to the State, but liable to forfeiture if for three successive years they were guilty of neglect. As each man arrived at manhood he was entitled to claim an allotment ; and when the father of grown-up sons died his widow kept his allotment for her lifetime. At her death each of the sons might choose whether they would relinquish their own holdings in favour of their father's or not ; but in no case could a man occupy more than one holding. Thus we combined the \" Nationalisation of land \" with the institution of lords of the manor. By changing the name of the tax I disposed of the necessity for claiming it from Europeans, since, being possessed of no land of their own, they could not reasonably be called upon to pay a \" land-tax.\" The poll-tax had for many years been the chief grievance of the traders, for Euro peans will pay an amount of indirect taxation which, if imposed in direct form, would cause a rebellion."], [252, "232 AMATEUR'LAW-GIVING. A more delicate, if less important, question was that of the marks of respect to be paid to nobles. The Tongans still cling tenaciously to certain ancient forms of respect, such as the unturbaned head and the cinctured waist in the precincts of a village. To traverse Nukualofa without a girdle would be a greater solecism than to walk the length of Piccadilly hatless and in one's shirt - sleeves. But the more servile forms of homage to chiefs \u2014 squatting at the roadside or performing mocmoe \u2014 were so incon venient that by the king's order a jwasi-military salute was generally substituted. In Bolynesia, to raise your self physically above another is to lay claim to a moral superiority over him, and the introduction of horses brought a new difficulty. To sit elevated above the world on the back of a horse tends to make Tongans cheeky, just as in Fiji the consciousness of having long hair makes the most respectful man insolent to his superiors. Many years before, a law had been enacted compelling commoners to dismount when they passed a member of the Upper House, or rode past his house. The Europeans laid the blame of this enactment at Air Baker's door ; but, if I may judge from the savage tenacity with which the nobles clung to this obnoxious section, it is more probable that the law was passed in spite of him. Puerile as the restriction appears, let it not be forgotten that a primitive people is always ruled by outward forms ; and wherever in the Pacific, and in deed elsewhere, a tribe is found who show no respect to their chiefs, there will be a people less susceptible to government and good order. Such laws, of course, always tend towards the ridiculous. A noble died, and one Jone"], [253, "233 RESPECT FOR DIGNITIES. Fifita, his distant cousin, was invested with the vacant title.

After patrolling the town for half an hour with a hand bell to attract buyers, the police swooped clown upon the doomed house, planted the Tongan ensign before the door, and seized all the portable property in it. Then the fakatautuki (sale by the hammer) began. The mats, pots, and gnatu were knocked down without much attempt being made to obtain the highest available price, and then as many of the horses, fowls, and pigs as could be caught were sold at an average price \u2014 for the horses and poultry at eighteenpence each, and for the pigs at fifteen or twenty times that amount. There are recorded cases of horses being disposed of at these sales for threepence."], [255, "235 LOG-ROLLING. This unusually spirited conduct of the Government produced a panic among the defaulting taxpayers. They became, indeed, almost as unscrupulous in their Avay of raising money for the Government as for the Churches. In the next three weeks Ave began to see our way out of our financial difficulties. The debt could already be discharged by instalments, and the arrears of salary to officials could safely be left to Parliament, upon whose rather reckless imagination it might have a healthy re straining influence when the Budget came to be discussed. Aly chief concern was to prevent my colleagues from re volting against the rigid economy I had enforced upon them, now that they knew there was a balance in the Treasury. About this time a meeting of the Cabinet was held to decide finally upon the Budget that was to be laid before Parliament. Tukuaho fully explained that the sole object of the meeting was to secure unanimity among the Ministers. AYe took the items seriatim \u2014 salaries first. AVhen we came to the Premier's department, Kubu pro posed that Tukuaho should withdraw, and thus relieve us of the delicacy of discussing the question of his emolu ments in his presence. And now began a very elegant display of log-rolling. Tukuaho's salary was raised at one stroke from \u00a3400 a-year to \u00a3700. Then Kubu's turn came, and he withdrew, to receive an addition of \u00a350 ; and the whole of the Cabinet, except the Chief-Justice, who Avas absent, were in like manner handsomely provided for. Aly lips were sealed, because my own salary was being A*oted for the additional term of six months for which the High Commissioner, at the king's request, had allowed me to remain, and the Alinisters would have been in-"], [256, "236 INCUBATION. capable of distinguishing between voting an ordinary salary and voting themselves an addition, since both acts sprang from a high-minded liberality. But that night Tukuaho, who Avas the one member of the Cabinet who cared more for his work than for its emoluments, came to ask me whether the minutes of the meeting might not be cancelled and expunged from the book. He wanted no increase of salary, he said ; but when they had voted him one, he could not in decency refuse the same courtesy to others. It was a mea fakatonga \u2014 a necessity of Tongan etiquette; and since even the incorruptible Sateki had yielded to the prevailing spirit of generosity, and had accepted an increase of \u00a330, I suppose that it was. We now gave political dinners almost nightly. As Parliament drew near, and rumours reached us of ven geance A'owed over the kava-bowls of Vavau, Tukuaho lost no opportunity of seizing and converting all the influential Aravauans who chanced to visit Nukualofa. No sooner did they set foot in the capital than they received an invitation to dine with me. Besides G and myself, the party usually consisted of Tukuaho, his father or Kubu, and the victim. Our quarry would fain have borrowed from his friends for the occasion the full panoply of European dress, but the invitation always specified native attire. There was a dinner with champagne, and as soon as the only lady had withdrawn, whisky and politics. The guest always went away with triumph in his heart that among all the chiefs of Vavau the Cabinet had thought his advice only as worth seek ing.

When they grumbled he wagged his head as befits one who could speak 'an he would. Aly code was nearly finished. Aly little clerk had well earned the copy of ' Hymns Ancient and Modern ' he had begged as the guerdon of his services, and a large part of the Tongan \\*ersion had come back in type from the Auck land printers. Parliament was to be opened in Alay, and there was little enough time for holding the general elec tion. The existing code contained elaborate directions for the guidance of the electoral officers, and laid clown as one of the qualifications for electors that they should have paid up all arrears of taxes before voting. In this we thought we recognised an opportunity for a final effort to induce the defaulters to pay their debts to the State. Nightly for a whole week the crier proclaimed throughout the villages that defaulters would be deprived of the price less right of choosing their representatives in Parliament. It was perhaps the experience of past elections that robbed our scheme of the result we had so good a right to expect. If the proper ritual had been followed, an election should haAre been just such a ceremony as would delight the soul of a Tongan. By law an elector could write the name of his dearest friend on the ballot-slip and pop it into the box, and until the result was declared the excitement must have far transcended the stir at the most hotly contested election in England, since even the meanest elector might find parliamentary honours showered upon him unsought. I understood, however, from my col leagues, that in practice the free and enlightened elec-"], [258, "238 INCUBATION. tors played a very secondary part. \" AAre were called,\" said my informant, \" to a fono on the grass behind the Government offices. Air Baker came out on the A*er andah and said, ' You are summoned to-day to choose a representative of the people. I propose So-and-so. Those who are in favour of So-and-so will hold up their hands ! ' Then se\\*eral held up their hands, and Air Baker said that So-and-so was elected, and we all went home.\" It was not to be hoped that after such experiences the privilege of being an elector would succeed where the terrors of the law had failed. AVe heard afterwards, when it was too late, that had the hundreds of dis qualified electors known the nature of the entertain ment we provided for them, they would have sold their goods and given to the Government rather than miss it. To invest the first free election with proper solemnities a deputation of his Majesty's Ministers presided. Below the verandah where we sat was a table furnished with writing materials and the ballot-box. The entire male adult population of Nukualofa sat in a semicircle on the grass-plot, hemmed in with police as at a fono. Tukuaho read the clauses of the Constitution relating to elections, and explained that every qualified elector might write the name of whomever he would upon the ballot-slip. Then he called upon those who still owed their taxes for the year 1889 to withdraw: about half the people rose and went away laughing. The dismissal of the defaulters for 1890 sent away fully one-half of the remainder ; and when \" all persons under twenty-one years of age \" had left us,"], [259, "239 AN ALARM. there remained barely one hundred persons, composed, I saw with growing consternation, almost exclusively of Wesleyans \u2014 returned exiles \u2014 and men so old and infirm as to be excused from taxes altogether. It was our own fault. We had forgotten that the Wesleyans, having been excused all taxes due for the period of their exile, had only had one dollar to pay, and had paid it in order to prove that their loyalty to the State was stronger than that of the Free Churchmen. The qualified electors were, therefore, Wesleyans almost to a man. The inevitable came to pass. Each man came to the ballot-box and filled up his paper without hesitation, and the scrutiny showed that four AVesleyans had been chosen to repre sent a constituency in which a A'ast majority were Free Churchmen. Fortunately one of them was a British subject, and I was able to give him his choice between repudiation of his nationality or voidance of his seat. As I expected, he chose the latter, and in his place Hobo, pre-eminent among Boman Catholic schoolmasters, was elected. Having thus initiated Sibu, the new ballot-clerk, in his duties, we left him to hold the other elections throughout the kingdom. \"He never yet stood sure that stands secure.\" With a balance in the treasury, and an ever-strengthening party, we were comfortably congratulating ourselves when the bolt fell. One evening while the Alinistry were playing bowls on the sea-front after a protracted meeting of the Cabinet, a schooner was seen bearing clown upon the anchorage. She was recognised as Alaatu's vessel from Vavau, and we were idly speculating on her errand when she brought to unexpectedly and lowered a boat without"], [260, "240 INCUBATION. going to the wharf. Two men sprang ashore and ran towards us. Their news justified their haste. Tubou was dying, and they were sent to summon the lords of Tonga tabu to be with him at the last. Divested of the exag geration natural to all bearers of evil tidings, the story ran that four clays previously the king had bathed as usual at daybreak and had caught a chill. For two days his illness caused no alarm, but on the third he grew worse and sent for his chiefs. AVhen old Tungi heard this he collapsed and said, \" If Tubou summoned his chiefs, it is the end ; by this time the hea\\7ens have fallen ! \" (kuo halcc ae laneji.) For me, no less than the country, no more disastrous event could have happened than the king's death. The whole castle of cards that I had been so painfully rearing during the last eight months would topple headlong to the ground. The balance in the Treasury, nursed with unflinching watchfulness and parsimony, would be swal lowed up at one gulp in the expenses of the funeral ; the public servants, trained to attend their offices by a system of judicious nagging, would, in the idleness inseparable from great public ceremonies, return to their former habits ; public tranquillity, so hardly won, would give place to disturbance, and perhaps civil war. Even if, by a miracle, all these disasters could be averted, and Parliament be brought together, the Ministry could not hope to pass the new laws without the king's sanction. If the king was dead there was nothing left for me but to stay and try to keep the peace. It was idle to hope that the work on which I had built so much could survive. It was one of those crises in which one is paralysed by the"], [261, "SUSPENSE RELIEVED. 241 knowledge that effort is useless. Impending misfortune that calls for action is endurable : it is the passive waiting for the bolt to fall that is so hard to bear. After the first moment of consternation all the para phernalia of civilisation were thrown to the winds, and for the first time I caught a glimpse of old Tonga. In the presence of death the king's Alinisters sank each to the social status his forefathers had held for generations before him. Ata, Lord of Hihifo, who was, politically speaking, a nonentity, became now the chief figure. He with Tungi must be at the dying king's side. Tukuaho and Kubu, having fathers still living, sank into obscurity. The schooners were \\rictualled and loaded far below safety mark with a living freight of chiefs and matabules. Tonga tabu was left to the care of Sateki and me, for neither of us had concern in the great affairs that were toward. A hush fell upon the island \u2014 the hush of a great expectancy. Alen spoke to one another in low voices when they met in the street, and all traffic of carts from the plantations was suspended. The houses were all crowded with men and women, even at high noon, always talking earnestly of the time that was coming upon them. Tukuaho had sailed primed with good advice for all emergencies. I spent two days of great anxiety. On the third a sail was seen in the northern passage. A huge concourse of people had collected on the beach when she brought to, and suppressed excitement was in every face. Scarcely a word was spoken as the dinghy pulled ashore. AVould the men never speak ? At last the steersman, a grey-haired matabule, stood up and cried, \" Oku lelei a Tubou ! \" (It is well with Tubou !) and a great sob of Q"], [262, "242 INCUBATION. gratitude and relief went up from the assembled people. The suspense of the mob turned to wild garrulous joy, and the news ran from mouth to mouth that the king had awakened from a long stupor and had called for food, and that from that moment his recovery had been rapid and sure. Two days later we learned that he and all his chiefs were on their way to the capital ; and at daybreak one morning the five schooners that formed the fleet of Tonga, led by the Toafa Haamea flying the royal standard, made their appearance in the passage. Strange are the uses of flattery ! I had occasion to see the king alone a few days after his arrival. He was at his best when seen informally, and I generally found my Avay to his room unannounced, leaving \u2014 if the conversa tion was to be of a private nature \u2014 a trusty policeman, sworn to Tukuaho's interest, to keep the sentry from play ing eavesdropper at the corner of the Palace verandah. The room was empty, and hearing voices from the back verandah, I reconnoitred from the screen of an oleander bush. The old man was sitting cross-legged between two burly native carpenters, and was trying with his tremulous hands to shave down an axe-haft to fit the steel head, discoursing to his companions of his ancient prowess in their craft. They meanwhile watched his nerveless efforts with affected admiration, looking like schoolboys who are taking their first lesson in tying flies from the village poacher. At last the king flung his knife and axe-haft petulantly aside, saying, \" AVhat has come to me ? You do it.\" A burly courtier took up the tool with a silly smile. For him the job was the work of a moment ; but as the knife neared the wood his hand shook so that not a"], [263, "243 THE USES OF FLATTERY. single shaving curled off. He kept up the farce until the king snatched the tool from him with a good-humoured laugh, saying, \" A'ou're worse than I am ! \" I do not know Avhether that axe was ever finished, because in the laugh that followed I was seen and recognised, and the carpen ters disappeared. This was delicate flattery, for besides his prowess in battle and on the sea Tubou was most famous for his skill in carpentry, and in Tonga the carpen ter enjoys the same consideration as the artist in Europe. In the South Seas imitation is not always the sincerest flattery. Some years ago I was walking with Boko Tui Nandronga on an impassable goat-path, which he dignified with the title of \" Government road.\" We had to pass along a steep descent of red clay, ice-slippery with the night's rain. The Boko was followed by a dozen or so of his retainers in single file. Half-way down the hill the chief slipped and fell flat on his back with a loud shout, and almost simultaneously every one of his followers did the same, leaving me standing alone. AVhen they got up, with their clean white sulus bedaubed with red mud, they pretended one and all not to have seen the chief's fall, and for the next ten minutes they discoursed to each other of the exact cause of their tumble. One knew from the first that he would fall, another had a sore toe, and so on. Of course the chief knew perfectly well that the falls were intentional, as did each one of his followers ; but the act has become conventional, and so they all play their proper parts in the farce. Can we, who limp in imitation of a personage's deformity, or who wore crinolines which were designed to conceal a personage's misfortune, afford to laugh at them ?"], [264, "244 INCUBATION. Hardly had the king returned when a new task was thrust upon my collar-galled shoulders. The contractor for the tax-copra, to whom I haA*e before alluded, brought an action against the Government in the High Commis sioner's Court to recover damages for the losses he had sustained through over-estimating the amount of copra the taxpayers would bring in. To the Tongans, knowing nothing of civil jurisdiction, the position of defendant in a court of law has mysterious terrors. \" Here,\" they said, \" is the fruit of this new Government ! We are to be haled to court and punished for the sins of Tukuaho and his foreign adviser. AVe shall be fined, and then a man of-war will come and perhaps seize the country.\" There being no counsel within reach, I had to conduct the case in person. I felt sure enough of my ground to promise the king a victory, or at least that, in the event of defeat, I would myself pay whatever damages were given against us; and this confident assurance went far to dispel his alarm : but the case occupied seventeen precious days at a time when they could least be spared. Yet our victory afterwards proved to be almost worth the waste of time, for the fickle mind of the Tongans leans ever to the win ning side, and our contractor unwittingly gained us many adherents in Parliament. The Free Church ministers, aghast no doubt at the portent of the election of four AVesleyans to represent Nukualofa, now shot their last bolt. They began to preach against me in the pulpit. Early one Alonday morning a letter written in Fijian was handed to me with great secrecy by a mounted messenger from Hihifo, who had followed me about until he found me alone. It"], [265, "AN ATTACK FROM THE PULPIT. 245 was from an old Fijian friend of mine, who Avrote to tell me that in two pulpits at least I had been the text for the sermon of the previous clay. One preacher, after describing the distrust with which my arrival had in spired him, said, \"We hear a great deal about stealing and embezzlement. AVhat ? Do foreigners never steal ? This one who guides our Government has stolen 7000 dollars from the Treasury, and who knows how much more of our money he will take ? In the sermon of the other there was a passage not less startling. \" When the theft became known the foreigner went to Tukuaho and said, ' AVho told the people this ? ' And Tukuaho said, ' It was Sateki. You know his way : let a matter be ever so secret, Sateki will find it out.' Hearing this the foreigner was silent and cast clown.\" I put the matter in Tukuaho's hands. The police made inquiries, aud traced the story to its source in the fertile brain of the first preacher. The Cabinet decided that policy demanded a prosecution for slander, but that if the man was convicted I might obtain a pardon for him from the king. This course was taken. The incident was in structive in the light it threw upon the estimation in which Europeans are held in Tonga. No calumny against them is thought too gross to be ridiculous. The respon sibility for such a state of things must rest upon those Europeans \u2014 missionaries as well as laymen \u2014 who have stooped to defame one another to the natives. The High Commissioner, in H.AI.S. Cordelia, now appeared upon the scene. It chanced that the gunboat Goldfinch, bound from Barotonga to Fiji, had put in on the preceding day in search of coal, knowing nothing of the"], [266, "246 INCUBATION. Cordelia's visit. Tongans never admit coincidences. I was asked for explanations and gave them, but my ques tioners shook their heads gravely, and spread it abroad that the gunboat had been sent by the High Commissioner to prepare, his way, but that for his own purposes \"the expounder\" had chosen to shroud the truth in mystery. Since this self-deception Avas more likely to do good than harm, I made no effort to belittle the importance of Sir John Thurston's visit. The king received him with effusion, and had evidently lost all uneasiness about the ulterior objects of his coming. An amendment to the treaty between Great Britain and Tonga was to be signed, and I found myself in the odd position of representing a foreign Government in negotiations with my chief \u2014 being, in fact, at the same time an officer in the English and the Tongan services. The presence of the Cordelia had a curious effect upon my relations with the king and my colleagues. They seemed suddenly to remember that I was not one of them, and the old confidence between us gave place to an almost imperceptible constraint, which, as soon as the ship sailed, disappeared as suddenly as it had come. To Sir John Thurston, who remembered the anxieties that had beset him a year before, the visit must have brought that satisfaction which is the reward of every one who, having chosen one of two opposite courses, finds that it was the wisest as well as the most courageous."], [267, "247 XVI. LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. The Ministry were at last in a position to fix the day for the making of history. The Code Avas drafted, the repre sentatives of the people were all duly elected, the new uniforms had come from a Sydney tailor, and the store on the wharf Avas piled high with sacks of provisions and cases of strong liquors, upon which the fate of the Alin istry mainly depended, since legislators cannot be com plaisant on empty stomachs. In this again I was com pelled to recognise the master mind of the late Premier. It may be inconvenient to force upon the Alinistry the task of catering for the parliamentary table, but so long as one has to reckon with the physiological fact that the road to a man's heart is clown his throat, the arrangement gives a Government of epicurean tendencies an immense advan tage over the Opposition. The King's Guards, the band, the College students, and the clerks of the House had all undergone rehearsals: there remained but one important function before the Par liament was ready for the business of the country. Wait-"], [268, "248 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. resses had to be selected for the dining-table of the House. Kubu invited me to form one of the committee charged with the delicate duty of selecting a band of twenty from among the competitors. AVe took our seats at the long table in the hall, and sternly ordered the candidates to be brought before us. A clerk with the instruments of his trade sat beside us, to give an air of formality to the proceedings. \" Two things are necessary,\" I heard it whispered ; \" they must be comely, and they must be intelligent. Who will eat if they be ugly ? and stupid women will break the plates.\" Then from the door that led kitchenwards twenty damsels sidled in and sat down on the lon\u00b0* form facing us. Some sucked their fingers in bashful ness ; a few looked shyly defiant ; the majority giggled. None of them looked as if they would break plates, but several fell short, very far short, of the first require ment. One damsel in particular had been so harshly treated by Nature that I whispered my doubts to my"], [269, "THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE. 249 neighbour. \" It is true,\" he answered, \" but we can never reject her for such a reason. She would die of shame. The other girls would cast it in their teeth.\" So they were all taken and divided into watches under the leadership of matrons of experience, \u2014 four to the kitchen, and eight to each of the tables destined to accommodate the Lords and Commons. Those who had never Avaited at table before were ordered to take lessons in the houses of the missionaries ; and Joe, the captain of the Kumeti, was appointed head steward and keeper of the spirit room, because strong liquors were known to disagree with him. At last the contingent from the distant Niuas arrived, and we became anxious that the opening of Parliament, already delayed three weeks beyond the appointed time, should take place without further delay. Humour had been busy on the beach. The king, it was said, would not open Parliament until the High Commissioner had left : the Government were afraid to face the Va\\*au contingent in their present frame of mind. The former rumour de termined us to fix the opening ceremony a day or two before H.A1.S. Cordelia left. The king made no diffi culties ; and the last week of preparation w*as spent in meetings of the Cabinet and Privy Council, in final re hearsal, and in providing with open-handed liberality for the creature comforts of the Opposition. There was but one hitch in the arrangements. We had prepared the King's Speech with some care. The only allusion to the political events of the recess was a short sentence, \" You all know that I have lately dismissed my Premier, and have appointed a Tongan in his stead.\" The"], [270, "250 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. Speech had been copied out and submitted to the king ; for several days we heard no more of it. Half afraid that our opponents would contrive to see it and endeavour to have it altered, at the last moment I insisted upon Tukuaho asking for it back. After some delay it was produced \u2014 in another handwriting as I expected. The passage about Mr Baker had been so altered as to convey an untrue and improper meaning. The handwriting was Sateki's, but he seems to have been merely the amanuensis. Bather than that it should stand in its present form, I took the Speech to the king. He was evidently expecting a remonstrance, and showed in his tone that he was on the defensive. \" But why allude to the past ? \" I asked. \" Was it I who did so ? \" he said. Then apparently satisfied with having his advantage, he laughed, and readily allowed me to expunge the Avhole passage. The great day dawned cloudless and drowsy. The hum of the fleecy breakers on the distant reef, the faint tap of the gatu mallets, \\*aguely suggested a reverie in a hammock and the unsubstantial folds of the vala ,* but native gar ments were to-day forbidden, for Parliaments in civilised"], [271, "251 SION A CENTURY AGO. lands are not opened in bare legs save in the imagination of Carlyle. For days past the stores on the beach have clone a spirited trade in trousers, coats, and shoes \u2014 not the sort of shoes that may be bought by the dozen at any boot maker's, but majestic fabrics of leather, built expressly for the opening of South Sea Parliaments, upon a special last 14 inches long by 8 or 9 broad. Such shoes as these cannot be lightly used. And so the spiritual guides of the people, when teaching that no self-respecting Tongan should attend church without black coat and trousers, admitted the religious principle that a man might work out his salvation in bare feet, and the shoes were relegated to the meetings of Parliament. The scene outside is very picturesque. It is high tide, and the sea laps to the very edge of the short grass that carpets the approach to the white Parliament House. The tall spars of the Cordelia tower above the spires of the miniature palace. The College students, dressed in white, are drawn up in two lines, so as to form a lane from the palace to the doors. The band and guard of honour look undeniably smart, both in their bearing and the polish of their accoutrements. It is a strange con trast with the same scene as it is described by Labil lardiere in 1791, exactly a century ago, when Minimi held his faikava on Sion Hill, now crowned with a church, but then with those twenty-four funny little huts into each of which a Cabinet Alinister crawled to sleep off' the effects of the Court bowl.

Truly missionary enter prise has worked great changes. The House was filled long before the appointed hour. Tukuaho had issued invitations to most of the traders. Native ladies of rank, and a few of the chiefs who held no seat, were accommodated below the gangway : men and women of every shade of colour filled the benches in front of them. It is an anxious moment for the newly appointed Sergeant-at-Arms, Kubu's brother, Kalauta, who is charged with the duty of finding room for every one. The \" Bepresentatives of the Beople \" (as the Constitution calls them) are packed into the benches on the right side of the House above the gangway ; the Nobles on the left behind the Treasury bench, where sit the Cabinet Aiinis ters, headed by Goschen, who, in a naval frock-coat and check trousers, gives a tone of elegance to the whole Alinistry. The next front bench has with difficulty been reserved for the suite of the High Commissioner, whose British uniforms are thrown into shade by the magenta satin gowns that clothe the portly forms of the Princesses Charlotte and Anna Jane behind them. On the crimson dais is the king's gilt chair ; and beside it the royal crown, the heaviest in the world, reclines upon its cushion sup ported by a three-legged table. The crown was bought by the late Premier from some merchants in Sydney, and, but for the verdigris in the flutings, might very well pass for gold. The suspense is broken at last by the rattle of saluting arms, and the blare of the Tongan National Anthem.

The Speech consisted of the usual Ministerial platitudes, congratulations upon \" our cordial relations with the other Bowers,\" and promises for the future. The allusion to the past was very brief. He, the king, gave thanks to God that these clouds were hap pily dispersed, and left it to the Legislature to provide for the future by revising all the laws and regulating finance. Convinced that their efforts in pursuit of civilisation would not be crowned with complete success until they mastered another language besides their own, and that national prosperity could not be assured unless the popu lation ceased to decrease, he had provided them with a schoolmaster for their minds and a doctor for their bodies. In conclusion, he commended them to God, and trusted that there would be no more dissension between the Churches \u2014 the expectation which, in the present temper of the missionaries, is, of all those contained in the Boyal Speech, the least likely to be realised. The king inter rupted the Speech twice, telling the reader impatiently to speak up. It had been intended to unveil a picture of the king, but almost before Taufaahau had articulated the closing words, his Alajesty rose and strode out as he had come, with the air of a man who has loyally discharged an irk some duty.

In ten minutes the members of both Houses will be pig-smeared to the elbows. Let them be happy in their own way to-day, for the morrow will bring debates, shoes, and the knife and fork. At ten o'clock next morning H.M.S. Cordelia steamed through the hazy reef as the great wooden drum announced that the business of the country was to begin. The House had been cleared for action. On the dais the throne had been replaced by the Speaker's chair; and a long table, at which sat four clerks of the Parliament, filled the place of the visitors' benches. Two sentries of the Guards and four policemen drawn up at the door saluted as we went in. The members of both Houses were in their places \u2014 Nobles on the right and Commons on the left of the chair. The Cabinet had a bench to themselves among the Nobles, and below them sat the governors of districts \u2014 sixty-eight members in all, counting myself. So long as I continued to hold the portfolio of Fakahinohino I had a seat ex, officio as a member of the Upper House. For twehe minutes not a word is spoken. AYe are waiting for the Speaker.

Some moments later there is a movement behind the dais-screen. Claud, Sergeant-at- Arms, clatters in and cries, \"Koe Sea /\" (The Chair !) We all rise. Tungi climbs the dais panting, but with the de liberate air of a man who knows his business ; for he held his office through two at least of Air Baker's Parliaments, and is not in the least collar-shy like the rest of us. He"], [277, "257 MEMBERS TAKE THE OATH. is, moreover, held in awe by the Commons, for \"Tungi ne montre jamais le fond du sac,\" as one of the French priests said of him. He is followed by Mr W , the Pontifex Maximus of Tonga, clad in decent black, and wearing an expression of deprecating piety. He is to earn to-day his stipend as Royal Chaplain, an item that has received the anxious atten- tion of the Cabinet, to whom a retrenchment of \u00a3100 a-year is of importance. He gives out a hymn, the member for Vavau, who forms the choir, bellows the tune, while the rest follow him two octaves lower pianissimo. The House shades its eyes with its hand, while the prelate wres tles in prayer and discreetly withdraws. There is a pause. Then Mataka, the chief clerk (who, by the way, is still sup posed to be undergoing imprison ment for flirting with the fair Lobase), calls the roll. The new members are now to take the oath.

They object to be sworn upon the Protestant Bible, and a clerk runs in haste for a version of the Bible translated into Tongan by the Boman Catholics. He returns with a thick shiny-covered book, which the two members kiss cheerfullv. I examined it afterwards, and Et"], [278, "258 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. found it to be a French and English dictionary. The oath taken contained the words, \" I swear . . . that I will to the utmost of my power discharge my duty as a member of the Legislative Assembly \" \u2014 a phrase that we had cause to remember, since a majority of the Commons held that to discharge their duty as representatives meant opposition to the Government, whether right or wrong, upon every cpiestion submitted to them. AVe Avere anxious not to afford the Vavau contingent an opportunity for making an attack upon the Government until we had had time to win the confidence of the other members, and we therefore proposed that the duty of drafting an Address in reply should be relegated to a Committee of six, selected from the Lords and Commons in equal numbers. As scarcely three members in the House knew Avhat an Address in reply was, it Avas at once suggested by the nominated members that the Cabinet should stay to help them, Avhile the rest of the House adjourned. With an air of intense relief the members trooped out to smoke sulukas in the shade. The Select Committee conversed in knots, leaving the draft to Tu kuaho and myself. Aly draft was couched in terms of excessive politeness, and read a little flat and colourless, \u2014 a defect due as much to my ignorance of the higher forms of the language as to my anxiety not to introduce contro versial matter. It was handed to Tukuaho as a skeleton to work upon, and it came forth glorified, bristling with expressions of gratitude of which I had never dreamed. It was unanimously adopted by the Committee. The Sergeant-at-Arms recalled the House by shouting to the members from the doorstep. The Address was read. At"], [279, "THE PROFESSOR QUESTION. 259 the words, \" We feel confident that God will avert religious strife, for He is the God of peace,\" I saw a cynical smile curl the lips of Hoho the Bomanist, who has a stronger sense of humour than the others who are in the secret of the Alission politics. The Address had been voted, and we were congratulating ourselves that the Vavau party had decided to reserve their grievances for a more fitting opportunity, when we discovered Alanase, the Governor of Vavau, upon his feet, wearing his usual expression of apostolic saintliness, but labouring under some mental excitement. AVe had not expected an attack from this quarter, for it had doubtless been conveyed to Alanase that there was a proposal before the Cabinet to impeach him for disaffection. Instigated by Air AV , the disappointed schoolmaster, he rushes blindly on his doom. \" The Address is good,\" he says, \" with one exception. AVhy was a schoolmaster ap pointed without consulting the wishes of Vavau ? \" Three Cabinet Aiinisters rise at once. \" Is it becoming,\" asks the Auditor-General, \" in a governor appointed by the king to question his Alajesty's action ? \" The House murmurs. The unfortunate Alanase would explain ; but the House wants no explanation, and he has to sit down, crushed and humbled. Tukuaho whispers to me that it is a good opportunity to reassure the House as to the truth of a rumour that Air H , the College master appointed by the Government, is a failautohi and not a faiako. As the words both mean \" school-teacher,\" it seems to my untutored ear to be a distinction without a difference, and I fail to grasp the full significance of the rumour. In the whispered explanation that"], [280, "260 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. follows it is borne in upon me that faiako has the restrictive meaning of professor, and that Mr H 's enemies have put it abroad that he is a mere school master and no professor. I am able to reassure the House on this point with a clear conscience, on the authority of no less a personage than the Alinister of Education of New Zealand. By the time the Address had been despatched to the king by the hands of the chief clerk the wooden drum had begun to beat. Aged Nobles, whose eyes had been getting dim, and whose heads had fallen forwards, started and straightway threw off twenty years of their burden of life. The whole House fixed its gaze upon the clock. It was the dinner-hour, and the Speaker, with an indulgent smile, adjourned the House. A stream of black-coated legislators hobbled to a long white building a few yards away, and besieged the doors as if it were the pit entrance to a theatre. A bolt was drawn, and both Houses surged inwards. There were two long tables, eacli accommo dating forty guests, \u2014 the one reserved for the Lords, and the other for the Commons. The ministering damsels were ordered to appear in a white uniform, without lace or other ornaments. They had treated the order with the scorn it deserved. The ox-eyed Sau, breathing propriety with every sigh, was dressed in white satin trimmed with furniture lace, and had a crimson sash tied coquettishly round her waist; the demure A7ika \u2014 demure only in the presence of her elders \u2014 had broken out in bugles of jet and a cincture of native cloth. The trader who supplied her striped xala would be sold out of that pattern on the morrow, for the fashion in Tonga is set by the pretty"], [281, "<TNTE OF THE ELECT. 2G1 One of the elect."], [282, "262 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. girls. When not languidly handing plates these damsels whispered and giggled in the windows, and hid their blushes on each other's glistening shoulders. The morning sitting has induced a remarkable appetite. The dinner on the first day numbered some seventeen courses of solid viands, yet scarce a plate goes away with enough upon it to indicate its contents. It is right to say, however, that this scale of entertainment is not main tained throughout the session. As the clays went on, course after course fell away as the supplies in the store house diminished. The Lords are allowed a glass of sherry and a glass of beer each, the Cabinet Alinisters half a tumbler of rum in addition ; the Commons have to content themselves with beer only. At last the Chaplain hammers on the table with his knife-hanclle and says grace, and the places of the legislators are taken by as many of the Civil servants as can muster trousers and shoes. There follows a fatal half hour, during which the fell effects of such a dinner become apparent. AVhen the bell rings members sink into their places, glare determinedly at the ceiling for a few moments, and lapse into unconsciousness. The Sergeant-at-Arms, having drunk neither ele nor lanm, rises and creeps stealthily towards the Lords. Such of the members as still retain consciousness crane their necks in breathless excitement. He is stalking Havea, Lord of Haapai. Catlike he creeps on, gold-mounted scabbard in hand, poises the weapon over the bowed head, and \u2014 Havea starts up with an exclamation that I could translate exactly, though I never heard it before. The House in dulges in a well-bred titter. Aleanwhile the clerks are looking round the House, and making frequent entries in"], [283, "THE LORDS' AWAKENER. 263 a book. It is the book of the Sleeping.

It is high time to adjourn. The second day brought a storm from an unexpected quarter. This bolt from the blue came from the Commons, who are possessed with a burning zeal for debate, and have not had time to appreciate the limits of their duties. The chief business of the session being to enact a com plete code, and to sweep away all former enactments, time is valuable, and the Premier expresses the hope that the House will not waste it in opposing such parts of the code as are transcribed from the Constitution, and are neces sary only for completeness. \" The king is supreme over all the chiefs and people, but his Ministers are alone responsible for good government.\" Bises Holio, repre sentative of a Boman Catholic constituency, lately a lead ing schoolmaster and a light of intellect and culture, who resigned his school in order to qualify as a repre sentative of the people. Tall, attenuated, and Mephisto phelian, he looks more like a Spaniard than a Tongan. With palms turned outwards and uplifted shoulders, he has even caught the Latin gestures. \"Why,\" he asks, \" should the king be supreme, and why should his Min isters be responsible ? \" He for one can never A*ote for such a measure. The House snorts impatiently. The Premier points out that the words are transcribed from the Constitution, and that Hoho should reserve his steel. Hoho retorts that he resigned his post as schoolmaster to make himself eligible for election ; that he has taken a solemn oath to do his duty to the best of his ability ; and that if he did not oppose this measure he would not be doing his duty. At this all the members with"], [285, "THE UPPER HOUSE IS INSULTED. 265 a reputation for intelligence start up, slap their chests, and quote the terms of their oath. The Sergeant-at-Arms rages up and down, calling upon all but Wiliame to sit down. William is understood to say that he respects the terms of his oath, but defers to the wisdom of the Nobles. Hoho springs to his feet with a sense of having the whole Catholic hierarchy at his back, and passionately exclaims that if comparisons are to be made between the two sides of the House, he thinks he knows on which side Avisdom will be found. There is a solemn hush. Aged noblemen gasp and make a mute appeal to the Speaker, who rises in agitation. \" Never in the whole course of his parliamentary experience had such a terrible insult been offered to the chiefs of the land. That a commoner, a vile commoner, who after all was only there to listen to the words of his superiors, should have so dared to throw decency to the winds, was un known in the history of their country. But, thank heaven, he was there to deal with such cases.\" Then waving his arm in the direction of the jail he continued, \" AVithout stand the dark cells, within the Sergeant-at- Arms. To the cells with the low-born ! \" The oration lasted many minutes, during which the low-born sat Avith bowed head until the storm should pass over him. The Nobles thanked the Speaker with their eyes ; there was an awkward pause. The Brenner, Avho had been looking very uncomfortable during this exposition of the liberty of speech about which the Government organ had been singing so joyously of late, filled the breach by reading the next section. But it was evident that another storm was brewing, for when"], [286, "266 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. the question was put not one of the Commons would vote. A message was accordingly conveyed to the Speaker from the Treasury bench that he should ad journ the House. As the author of the mischief stalked out a group at the door cried derisively, \" Go thou with the priest to France.\" In the evening poor Tukuaho received an indignant protest from the resident priest, hinting that the consequences would be serious for Tonga if any rumour of this national insult should reach the ears of the Government of the great Republic. A mild reproof must have been conveyed to Tungi before the morning sitting, for he rises after prayers to apologise to the Commons for the strength of his language over-night. They look pleased. He goes on to remind them of the severe provocation he had received, and as the full magnitude of the insult is borne in upon him, he lets fly again, and gives the Commons a more furious lashing than in the speech for which he rose to apologise. The Ministers cover their faces, and the Commons look sulky. The Premier implores the House to regard the incident as closed, and to believe that they have the fullest liberty of speech \u2014 in short, not to mind what his father says. After a long silence Vili Tai, member for Nukualofa, rises. His heart is subdued by fear: in spite of his oath he no longer dares to speak. The Commons sadly shake their heads. Some unwritten standing orders appear to have sur vived from Air Baker's last Parliament three years ago. Kubu is an authority upon these, for he then held the influential post of Sergeant-at-Arms, now occupied by his brother Claude. When the House goes into Committee"], [287, "CATCHING THE SERGEANT'S SWORD. 267 after the second reading, the Speaker vacates the chair and takes part in the debate as an ordinary member of the Upper House. But the most important of these rules is that, until the House is in Committee, no one but a Cabinet Alinister may speak more than once upon a measure. In Committee no restriction is exercised but that \\rery necessary one of preA'enting more than one member from speaking at a time. The Sergeant-at-Arms is the arbiter between rival claimants to be heard ; for the gold-hilted sword is no idle tapper of sleepy heads, \u2014 it imperiously indicates the favoured member who may address the House. In Tonga one does not catch the Speaker's eye \u2014 one catches the Sergeant's sword. Feeling certain that the Commons, however sulky, will not be able to resist the temptation of the freedom of debate permitted in Committee, I move the election of a Chairman of Committees. Four candidates, whom eti quette requires to be reluctant, are put forward, and Ata, Lord of Hihifo is elected. As I expected, the Commons immediately forget their wounded pride in the excite ment of passionate debate. At the conclusion of each speech half a dozen members are discovered standing and talking at once, while the rest of the House calls \" Order.\" Each speaker is trying to impress the Sergeant at-Arms with his claim to be first heard. That officer strides into the middle of the floor and points his dicta torial sword at the member Avho has found favour. The others perforce sit down till their turn comes. These standing orders were as useful to the Government as a closure. Often when time was short, and we were sure of the support of a majority, we relentlessly refused"], [288, "268 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. to move that the Speaker do vacate the chair, and were deaf to the entreaties of members who had discharged one wordy flood and longed for a Committee of the House to reopen the sluice-gates of their eloquence. The best speakers in the House were Alanase (not the Governor of that name) and Sovea of Vavau. The former was nervous, impulsive, and gi\\*en to the display of rhetorical fireworks ; the latter, a cool keen debater, with a logical mind and an inconvenient habit of asking questions. He had served through the last Parliament, and was credited with knowing all the weak spots in the Government armour. In person he was an insignifi cant little man, disfigured by bad teeth. He sat by him self at the extreme end of the House, and a compact body of members from Vavau and Haapai, his admirers, separated him from the rest of the Commons. He proved to be a far more dangerous opponent than the generous Alanase, whom we soon won 0Arer to our cause. The chief grievance of the Vavau contingent was the pre dominance of Tongatabu chiefs in the Cabinet, and the favour which the present Cabinet were alleged to show to the Wesleyans. Their discontent had been fostered by the traders of Vavau, who, in the hope of effecting a reduction in the Customs tariff, had persuaded them that the Government was really in the hands, not of Tongans, but of C and myself, and that if there were no Customs the prices of all important articles would be lowered. The king had announced that he did not wish any revision of the Constitution to be dis cussed this session. Their mouths were therefore closed in respect of their principal grievance, and they were"], [289, "THE WESLEYAN MEMBERS. 269 compelled to reserve their main attack for the discussion of the tariff. The four AVesleyan members were a trial to us. They seemed to believe that they had a monopoly of intelligence as well as of independence of character. This A\\*as probably a natural effect of exile for conscience' sake and the triumph of the cause for which they suffered. The worst of these was Josaia, the head tutor at the Wesleyan College. Teaching had become so much a habit with him, that he spoke only to pour upon the House the stores of his cultured mind. The House was not grateful, and but for the standing order already alluded to, I fear that Josaia would have been held to deserve the fate of Socrates, and for the same reason. Wiliame Alaealiuaki was less didactic and more sensible, but he had long been in the hands of the trading com munity, and had a mission to get the Customs tariff reduced. In other respects he was a supporter of the Government. Arili Tai was cursed Avith a sensitive con science, which took him by the throat whenever he was going to A*ote in accordance with his better judgment, \u2014 at least that is what he told us. He has an ominously long upper lip, and looks altogether like a retired Non conformist grocer of truculent respectability. Upon Vili Tai's conscience assaults of reason beat in impotence. AVe could only beg him earnestly to make a second and more careful diagnosis of his symptoms before finally committing himself to the cause of the Opposition. The chapter relating to the Executive was passed with out serious opposition. \" The Premier shall provide ac commodation for the members of the Legislative As sembly,\" &c.

When I came to Haapai on my way hither I wandered hungry up and clown the beach, and slept on the cold sands, and (laughter). There is nothing to laugh at. I was \" He got no further. The Speaker waved his hand, the gold-hilted sword was raised, and he sat clown and poured the rest of his story into the sympathetic ear of the member next to him. Tukuaho must have got through a great deal of Avork in propitiating the Opposition over the kava-bowl at night, for, on the whole, there was great good sense and intelli gence shown throughout the debates of the first few days. The idea of civil procedure was, it is true, rather hard to convey to their understanding, Hitherto all injuries, whether malicious or accidental, Avere treated as criminal offences. There was also a haziness regarding the defini tion of larceny ; for the Tongan magistrates had been unaccustomed to distinguish between the taking of pro perty dishonestly, and property removed by a person who honestly believes that it lawfully belongs to him. My draft Code, after the Indian Penal Code, upon which it was founded, was interspersed with frequent illustrations of the law in operation, and these illustrations had an unfortunate tendency to evoke personal reminiscences, so that the House wandered away into the bypaths of anecdote, and much precious time was wasted. The errors in translation from my draft were not very numerous, for Tukuaho professed to have asked me the meaning of all the passages that were not absolutely clear to him when he revised my draft. A somewhat remarkable provision was, however, nearly enacted in respect of Quakers or"], [291, "271 THE CURSE PRESCRIBED FOR QUAKERS. other persons who could not properly be sworn when called as witnesses. I knew of no word that signified \" affirmation \" as distinguished from oath (fuakava). I endeavoured to explain to Tukuaho that the word required had a meaning akin to oath but fell short of it. After mature thought he declared that talatukii had the exact meaning required. Talatukii was accordingly printed in the draft. An expression of surprise and inquiry crossed the faces of the more intelligent of the Commons, and Sovea rose to inquire from the fakahinohino why Quakers should be permitted to talatukii in a court of law, and who they were to do it to. On more exact inquiry, I learned that the word talatukii means to curse \u2014 to use imprecations so deadly and horrible, that the person against whom they were directed usually died from the effect ; and this was the conduct prescribed by my Code for Quakers in the witness-box ! In Titipu, if Air Gilbert is to be taken seriously, flirting is punishable with death ; in Tonga the penalty is penal servitude. Whether the severity of the punishment or the frailty of human nature is to blame for the prevalence of this crime I know not, but whatever be the cause, the police are so actively engaged in hunting clown delinquents that they haA*e neither time nor inclination to attend to burglaries, thefts, or other less interesting offences. Once before I had tried to reform the practice in this re spect, by inserting in the instructions to the police an injunction to leave prosecutions of this nature to the in jured parties. The Cabinet agreed with me, but, as I have already related, a deputation of policemen, headed by the grey - headed Inspector, subsequently waited upon the"], [292, "272 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. Premier to implore him to reflect before committing him self to an innovation that would not only destroy the traditions of the \" Force,\" but would also without doubt call clown upon his country the divine wrath. At Tukuaho's desire I had consented to shelve the question until the meeting of Parliament, lest ill-conditioned per sons might misrepresent our motives to the king. I was therefore prepared for opposition, but having the support of the Cabinet, I Avas determined to relieve the police of this part of their duties, and to sacrifice the prison labourers and the revenue in fines with which these pro secutions annually provided the Government. The pro posal evoked a passionate debate. Vili Tai opposed the measure in a burst of fiery oratory. He fully believed that it may suit Britain or France to regard flirting as an offence against the individual, but in Tonga, at least, it is a crime against the State. For have not the Tongans solemnly dedicated their country to God ? Pointing to the royal arms blazoned above the dais, he cried, \" What other nation has the right to that motto, ' God and Tonga are my inheritance ' ? If you quote Avhat is done in Bilitania, I will quote you the motto of the nation.\" There was a murmur of applause. It was in vain to point out that a restriction of the functions of the police is not in itself likely to call down the divine wrath. The reservoir of Tongan eloquence had burst its banks, and cold common sense could never stem the flood. Another enthusiast fixed a rapt and inspired gaze on the ceiling, and de manded whether the House would dare to break its faith with the Almighty. \" It may be true that under our present laws our country is becoming depopulated,"], [293, "273 THE GREAT DEBATE ON FLIRTING but better Ave should perish from the face of the earth than break our solemn covenant with God.\" William Maealiuaki, who generally talks sense, reminds the House that thirteen years ago a similar measure was passed, and that within three months an epidemic attacked the people, but when the measure was re pealed the sickness abated. He only mentions the fact without drawing any deduction, except that there is room for belief that the Almighty does expect higher tilings from Tonga than from other countries. A personal element is imported by one of the Nobles, who remarks that the law would be entirely unnecessary if it were not for the professional bachelors, such as Moengan gongo, Kubu's brother, and Alatealona, and half-a-dozen others who sat among them. These unfortunates, having no defence ready to meet this unprovoked attack, look foolish. A fortnight after the session Aloengangongo espoused the ox-eyed waitress Sau, but whether in conse quence of this public attack, or the young lady's charming poses in the Avindows of the dining-room, has not as yet transpired. Forced against our will to play the unwel come part of \" devil's advocate,\" we at last applied the closure, and the votes were taken. Two of the Alinistry, Sateki and Kubu, voted against us. I was about to ex plain to Kubu that one of the principles of party govern ment was that the members of the Cabinet should act in concert, and that, as he had promised to vote for this measure, his attitude required explanation ; but he fore stalled me by saying that during the debate his konisienisi (conscience) had met him face to face, and that there fore the terms of his oath compelled him to desert his s"], [294, "274 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. party. The Government carried the motion by a bare majority of two. That evening Alataka read it to the king, sitting at the old man's feet. When the fateful words Avere reached Tubou expressed his disapproval, and declined to sign until it had been taken back to the House for further discussion. The news leaked out, and at the next division the Alinisters were left alone. A Tongan has no convictions that are not shared by his king. These debates were useful to us, for they enabled us to sift the dispositions of the members, and to gauge our chances of o\\*ercoming opposition in the more important debate on the Customs. As soon as our position seemed sufficiently secure, we determined to skip the intermediate part of the Code, and at once attack the chapter dealing with the tariff'. The announcement was made without warning, so that we might hear the views of the members themselves without prompting from the Europeans. I told them that the Customs at present produced a revenue of about \u00a36000 a-year, which Ave could not afford to do without unless the expenditure was considerably reduced ; but that before proceeding further with the Code, we must know the views of the House regarding the con tinuance of the tute, as they called the collection of Cus toms dues. If they refused to raise reA*enue by this means, it would be a waste of time to pass an elaborate Customs law. There was some whispering amongst the Commons, and AVilliam rose to ask a question. If the Customs were abolished, Avhat would happen ? To this I replied that the revenue must be raised by increased direct taxation, or by a reduction of the expenditure by one - third. Vili Tai wished to know whether it was"], [295, "275 THE SELECT COMMITTEE. true, as they had heard, that the tariff was heavier in Tonga than in other countries, and that the most pros- perous countries owed their success to there being no Customs at all ? I had a list of the ad valorem tariffs showing that Tonga, with a duty of 10 per cent, levied a lighter tax than New Zealand, Canada, Queensland, or even Fiji. Then a member from Vavau rose to put the all-important question whether, in the event of the aboli- tion of the Customs dues, the prices of calico and kerosene would be lowered by the storekeepers, as the white men had promised ? At this stage the Speaker joined in the debate. He remembered the prices of such things before there ever was a tariff, and he could assure the House that the prices were not a farthing lower then. He could tell them what the effect would be. The traders' profits would be increased, but the Tongans would not be one whit the better for it, AVhen the question was put, the House Avas unanimous in A'oting for a continuance of the duties, provided that the laAvs relating to Customs were translated so as to be intelligible to them. This proviso enabled us to complete our victory. AVe asked the House to nominate a committee of pundits to assist the Govern- ment in translating the mercantile laws, knowing full well that Ave should thus convert our adversaries into champions of a bill which they had themselves helped to draft. AVilliarn, Filimone, and Alanase of Aravau were obviously flattered at being singled out as the Govern- ment nominees for such a work. For the next fortnight we met nightly at seven o'clock, and adjourned at two in the morning, after submitting each clause of the law to the most careful system of polishing by the entire com-"], [296, "276 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. mittee. Every half -hour during the sitting four convicts entered with a full bowl of kava and retired with an empty one, until the air was so charged with tobacco smoke that they were scarcely discernible. Hearing the disputes over the meaning of every phrase and idiom, I learned more Tongan during that fortnight than during all the rest of the time I spent in the country. The Government was pledged to the Chamber of Com merce to introduce certain reductions in the tariff which provided some rather A'exatious duties on articles little used. As soon as the debate was opened Hoho rose. He for one fully approved of the principle of collecting revenue by Customs dues, but he thought it became the Government to be magnanimous, and not to press for duties on the necessaries of life, as, for instance, red wines. (Laughter, and a voice, \" Drinking liquor is for bidden.\") Hoho stopped, disconcerted, and the Alinister of Folice pointed an accusatory finger at him. \" This man,\" he said, \" is speaking the words of the priests. Who drinks red wine but the priests ? And yet he has sworn to follow the dictates of his own conscience.\" Not only did the House decline to lower the duty on claret, but they showed a stubborn disinclination to listen to any of the Government proposals for reduction. In A*ain we told them that we were prepared to sacrifice revenue to the extent of \u00a3400 a-year. The Europeans had overdone their part in declaiming against the Customs, and the natives, sore at having been made the victims of defective arithmetic, were disinclined to vote for any proposal that might appear to be concession to the agitation. The Government was beaten on a division, and was regarded"], [297, "277 HANSARD. by Parliament as being in league with the traders, and by the traders as being guilty of the blackest duplicity. The Chamber of Commerce, indeed, Avith its dying breath de manded from me why the Government, so ignominiously beaten on so vital a point as the import duty on kerosene, had not at once tendered their resignation. The shipping laws were more intelligible to the House. Many of them, as the owners or masters of small craft, had had a bitter experience of the law regarding coasting licences, and a strong party were in favour of exempting craft OAvned by Tongans and used only as yachts from the coasting dues paid by steamers and vessels plying for hire. But the majority were against enacting any thing that might be cast up against them as one-sided legislation. Hansard, meanwhile, Avas growing to unmanageable dimensions. The clerks took down every speech in shorthand, and sat up till daylight night after night transcribing their notes. Not the smallest spoken word passed unrecorded. It was time for a brief holiday, for the sick-list was heavy ; and many noblemen who could take the air in native attire could not attend the House until their feet had sufficiently recovered to encounter again the penalties attaching to boots. The Speaker an nounced a three days' holiday, and added that by special arrangement the Government medical officer would pre scribe gratis for all members in need of medical treat ment. During the morning a dense crowd of legislators besieged the dispensary. AVithin was the newly arrived doctor, heated and gesticulating, trying to drive back the mob of senators, who were all stri\\*ing to describe in"], [298, "278 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. dumb-show the peculiar symptoms of stomach-ache from generous living. The debate upon the land question, scarcely less im portant than the Customs, opened inauspicionsly. Alanase, the orator, made a set speech upon the history of the land laws of the country, incidentally alluding to the magnan imity of the king. The House seems to be moved \u2014 per haps by his eloquence. There is a long and ominous silence. Then Niukabu, a noble of Vavau with a grey moustache, rises to order. He has with difficulty con tained himself, he says, during the last indecent speech. AVhat does Manase think ? Have the lords of Hahavea no feelings ? Do they like to be reminded of the past ? The three lords of Hahavea glare responsive at the ceiling. I ask Kubu my neighbour what Alanase has said to hurt their feelings. He whispers that when the king conquered them in the last war of 1853, contrary to Tongan custom, he restored their lands to them, and to speak of the king's magnanimity recalls unpleasant memories. I mentally resolve not to make even the most distant allusion to Tongan history. In spite, however, of the temporary gloom thrown over us by this incident, our pet land scheme was passed with but slight alteration. In future a tax payer who refused to pay his taxes Avas to lose his land. I was absent from the second reading of the Alinor Offences Bill. When I came in the Premier, who is not often moved to express himself strongly, was rating the House in unmeasured terms. He had not believed, he said, that the Legislative Council of Tonga could so far forget its dignity as to indulge in such a disgraceful scene. AVhat would be said of Tonga if such a thing were known"], [299, "279 A DISGRACEFUL SCENE. outside the walls of that House ? AVhat respect for Tonga could any of the ci\\*ilised nations retain if they heard of this disgrace ? The Commons seemed quite OA-ercome with a sense of their guilt, \" AVhat has happened ? \" I whispered to Kubu. \" A disgraceful thing.\" \" But what ? \" \" A shameful thing. AVhen Osaiase Puaka [Osaias Hogg] was speaking, some of the Representatives of the People pretended to cough, and shuttled their feet.\" The House had been lashed by the Speaker before his son took them in hand, and Kubu described his remarks as \" very heavy.\" He spoke to me afterwards about it. \" I was glad,\" he said, \" that you were not there to see this shameful thing ; if the miscreants bad not been so many, I would have committed them all to the dark cells. I suppose if such a thing were to happen in the Parliament of Bili tania, the delinquents would go to prison ? \" \" Ye-e-s,\" I answered. \" But such a thing never has happened ? \" \" Oh, no ; though I have heard of it happening in the French Parliament,\" I said, and thought of the House during one of Air Conybeare's speeches. But this was before Alessrs Carson and Fisher had taken their seats. A gloom fell OA*er the House during the debate on the land laws. For some clays Havea, a lord of Haapai, had been absent from his seat. At last it is whispered that his illness is unnameable \u2014 that leprosy, the scourge of the Bacific, has seized upon him. It makes one thoughtful to remember that until a Aveek ago we were sitting and eating with a leper ; but the consternation in the faces of my colleagues is due to other causes. For by Tongan etiquette it is more than questionable taste to speak of the illness of a chief ; it is forbidden in polite society to mention"], [300, "280 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. leprosy at all ; but to describe a chief as a leper is too gross an offence to be conceivable. But the thing has to be clone somehow, and the Premier nobly fills the breach. They had all heard, he said, about their dear friend and colleague, and they all mourned when they heard. He felt sure that he expressed the sentiments of them all when he said that Havea 's friends were pining for him at home, and therefore it was but right that they should cheerfully sacrifice their own wishes and relieve the long ing of his friends by allowing him to return to them. At the same time it was right to say that the doctor had pronounced the report about Havea to be not entirely true \u2014 in short, that the proximity of Havea was not likely to render it advisable that his companions should return to their friends. But Tuuhetoka Avas less guarded, being of a coarser fibre than his chief. \" I am in favour,\" he said, \" of gratifying the longing of Havea's friends to see his face. Nay, more : to the westward are delightful little islands, which I know Havea is longing to visit, where his every wish may be gratified, and where\u2014 well \u2014 Avhere the wind would blow so nicely from us to him that Havea would be more than happy.\" I improved the opportunity by urging the necessity of isolating infected persons to check the alarming increase in the disease. The Com mons watched me with the uneasy interest felt by the crowd at a dangerous tight-rope performance without a net underneath. I soon floundered helplessly, and before I was aware of it I uttered the fatal word leprosy (kilia). The House shuddered, and I was covered with shame. To effect a diversion, I described the labours of Father Damien at Alolokai. At the adjournment Jesuit Hoho button-"], [301, "LEGISLATION IN AVHITE MAN'S FASHION. 281 holed me, and said, \" I come to thank you for your words about the priest Tamiene. I shall report your Avords to my priest and the bishop, avIio will be much gratified.\" There was a fierce battle over the Taxes Bill. It was in vain for us to explain that the abolition of interest on arrears was a large concession, and that the land-tax of 9 dollars was no higher than the old poll-tax, since the education rate had been abolished. It was in vain that we promised that as soon as the country was out of debt we would consider a proposal of reduction. The majority had expected in a vague way that Parliament would reduce the individual taxes from \u00a32 to \u00a31 a man ; and, bad the country been out of debt, we should have been ready enough to recognise that their request was reason able, \u2014 for direct taxation, vexatious to a Tongan as to a white man, is only defensible when it is light. But the Government knew that any reduction would mean a deficit in their Budget, unless Barliament would consent to abolish some half of the offices of the cumbrous Civil Service, and they declared their intention of resigning in a body if they were beaten. Then the aged Niukabu rose sobbing, and cried aloud, imploring the Bremier not to act fdkapapcdagi (in white man's fashion). \" We are all Ton gans, not white men, therefore pity us and reduce our taxes.\" But the Alinistry were obdurate, and Niukabu's sobs were drowned by those who dreaded a change of Alinistry worse than taxes. I had now been eleven months in Tonga, the greater part of my Code had become law, and the remainder was certain to be passed without alteration : the Alinistry had the confidence of Barliament, and there was a sufficient"], [302, "282 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. balance in the Treasury to meet all immediate liabilities, after paying off two instalments of the debt to Civil ser vants for arrears of pay. Aly work Avas done : there re mained only the printing of the Code, and this I was to superintend in Auckland. For the last five weeks I had been working the House at high pressure, for they were not accustomed to sit for six successive days in the week. It was time to leave them to finish the session after their own fashion. The last clays before the arrival of the steamer were spent in leave-taking. The Privy Council met in order that I might take a formal leave of the king. I was spared any speech-making. The old man said a few words full of quiet dignity and regret that pleased me more than any elaborate and effusive thanks would have done. Later in the day a formal letter of thanks, signed in his tremulous handwriting, was brought to me. On the day of the steamer's arrival a message was con veyed to me that my presence in the House was not desired. During the course of the morning Nuku, now converted into an ardent supporter of the present Alin istry, by his threatened impeachment, and by a term of imprisonment for a civil offence, appeared in correct par liamentary attire, and presented me with an address of thanks. He added a message that the House Avas waiting to receive me. I went first to say farewell to the king, for whom I, in common Avith every one who knew him well, felt a strong respect and affection. There Avas in this good-bye an added sadness, in that we both knew that Ave should neA'er meet again. \" Alay God guard you ! \" he said, as we shook hands. \" AVho knows whether we shall meet again, tama ? but I think not, for my time is near.\""], [303, "283 FAREAVELL. As I passed the gates he was still standing in the sun looking after me. I never saw him again, for eighteen months later he was carried to the Alalaekula, full of clays and honour, wanting but four years to complete a century of life. In the House every member was in his place. As soon as I had taken my seat Tungi left the chair and came to the table. He had, he said, been deputed by the House to tender to me the thanks of the chiefs and people of Tonga, and to ask me to accept from them a memento of my sojourn among them. At the end of his speech he put a heavy bag into my hands. In my reply I explained that the rules of my service forbade me to accept any present from them, and that for doing no more than was required of him no man was entitled to reward. Instead of so valuable a present, I begged them to give me some thing of little value to remind me of them when I was far away, \u2014 whose value should lie in the associations that clung to it instead of in its intrinsic worth ; for I should prize such a present eA*en more highly, in that it would not carry with it the discharge of an obligation. I afterwards found that, despite my representations, they had asked the High Commissioner to present me on their behalf with a beautiful service of plate, a gift that I shall always prize the more that it was sent after I had left them, and any temporary heat of enthusiasm had had time to flame out, leaving a steady warmth of feeling behind it. As I spoke of the vicissitudes of life that throw men into close companionship for a common work, and then separates them, perhaps for ever, I saw that they as well"], [304, "284 LORDS AND COMMONS IN COUNCIL. as I were overcome with emotion. It was hard to part with men who had been such staunch comrades in a hard fight, knowing that in the ordinary course of the world I should never see them again. The king's band had meanwhile assembled outside the House, struck up a inarch as we came out, and I found myself the centre of a procession led by the band, and followed by all the members of Parliament. The third whistle had long sounded, and the steamer began to cast off as I said my last good - bye. The propeller churned the sleepy water into foam, we glided seawards, and in a few moments the faces became indistinct, and faded into a confusion of waving draperies, \u2014 fainter and fainter, till the low shore grew grey and woolly, merged into a cloud-bank, and disappeared. We Avere alone in the Pacific, bound for the great world, and all the brief turmoil of Tonga and its turgid politics slid into a pleasant memory as unreal as the clouds that hung over the spot on the horizon Avhere it had vanished."], [305, "285 POSTSCRIPT. Many things happen in three years. Aly narrative should properly have ended where I have left it ; but, since circum stances have combined to defer its publication, I cannot pass over all that has happened since 1891. I left Tonga clear of her embarrassments, with a strong popular ( 'overnment, and every promise of prosperity. In 1894 she is divided in her councils, suspicious of her rulers, and financially unsound. Her destiny depended upon the wisdom of the king's advisers. It was too much to hope that, without any European assist ance, a native Government could steer clear of difficulties ; but I hoped, at least, that the lessons of economy they had learnt so painfully would ensure the native Cabinet against living beyond their means. AVhen I left, Air AIoss was ap pointed clerk to the Premier, and for a time all went well. In December 1891 there was a balance of \u00a38000 in the treasury, after all debts had been discharged. Then came a series of disasters. Air AIoss died, and there was keen competition for his vacant place. AVhile they were still wrangling and in triguing, the king was taken suddenly ill, and after only four days' illness he died on February 18, 1893. He had alarmed them so often with his sudden seizures that the blow came upon the people almost unprepared. They had come to look upon their king of ninety-six as immortal. Even the oldest of them could not remember a time when George Tubou was not a central figure in the country. All work came to an end. The eocoa-nuts lay unhusked upon the ground for months :"], [306, "286 POSTSCRIPT. trade was at a standstill. The people went to their planta- tions only to dig up and carry away food for the great funeral feasts. Their only labour was the erection of the great tomb in the Malaekula (Bed square). Contrary to general expectation, the king's great-grandson, George Taufaahau, succeeded him without disturbance. This was in a great measure due to the loyalty and good sense of Tukuaho, who might easily, had he pleased, have divided the country into factions. The young- king of twenty ill repaid this devotion. For the first few months, it is true, he followed his Premier's advice. But no sooner did he begin to feel secure in his new position than he began to listen to advisers of another kind. The balance in the treasury had melted away in the expenses of the funeral. Under the most favourable circumstances, the country could only recover under careful management. But before the people could return to work, an epidemic of measles, then prevalent in New Zealand, broke out in Nukualofa, AVe all know the story of the measles in Fiji, \u2014 how, in 1876, it swept away 40,000 out of the population of 150,000. Aleasles, when it attacks the Polynesians, is no longer the infantine malady we know of. It becomes a devastating plague. The Tongans, with the experi- ence of Fiji in their memories, took, it is true, some precautions against the after-effects of the disease ; but, nevertheless, one- twentieth of the population was carried off, and the remainder was so demoralised that it was threatened with famine. The measles gave the enemies of the Government the opportunity they wanted. The infection must have been brought by a steamer, and the Premier had been responsible for the granting of pratique. It mattered not that the king had himself sanc- tioned the hauling down of the yellow flag. An excuse was wanted for dismissing him, and the king availed himself of it. There was a coup-d'etat. One morning the European officers of Customs found sentries at their office doors. Tukuaho was summarily dismissed without any assigned reason, Sateki ap pointed in his place, and an unemployed schoolmaster and a"], [307, "287 A FORECAST AND A AVARNING. fisherman appointed in the room of the two dismissed Euro pean officers. These, not content with their triumph, pro ceeded to audit the Customs' accounts, and declared that they had discovered defalcations. The ex-collector of Customs im mediately brought an action for wrongful dismissal and slander before the High Commissioner's Court, and, to the great dis comfiture of a majority of the storekeepers (what Customs officer was ever loved ?), triumphantly cleared his character. Since then things have gone from bad to worse. The people are less than ever inclined to pay their taxes, now that the Gov ernment has no longer the strong arm of Tubou to support it. I should be wiser if I said nothing about the future ; for no man ever yet succeeded in foretelling accurately the shifts and turns of political events. Yet even at the risk of hurting the feelings of my good friends in Tonga, I will state my belief in the hope that it may act as a warning. England does not want Tonga, nor New Zealand either, if she knew her own interests ; and yet, even if there were none of those restless spirits that egg on the Governments of our half-populated colonies to extend their boundaries and responsibilities, Tonga must eventually fall under the flag of England or of Australasia. \"When this happens, it will be the fault of the Tongans themselves. If, instead of hysterical professions of patriotism, the Tongans would show the very moderately patriotic feelings that prompt other peoples to pay their taxes, Tonga might remain inde pendent for generations ; but with a weak Government and a divided people, how can a little State, hemmed in by powerful and growing neighbours, maintain her independence 1 AVe do not want Tonga, and yet we cannot allow any other great Power to take our place there. If Tonga must be taken, it is we who must take her; but though I am no \"Little Englander,\" I have seen enough of our small possessions to know that the increased incentive to British trade that may result from the hoisting of a flag does not compensate for the weakness that a host of half bankrupt islands throws upon the Empire."], [308, ""], [309, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA T"], [310, ""], [311, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. i. THE BORDERLAND OF MYTH. Seeing that the past is the key to the present, I was at some pains to learn the history of Tonga. This tiny kingdom of 20,000 people, inhabiting widely scattered islands, but speaking the same language, intermarrying, and obeying the same Government, boasted so compli cated a social polity that its history, as an illustration of the growth of human institutions, is worthy of study for its own sake. Until the introduction of Christianity swept away the old beliefs and the institutions that depended on them, there were in Tonga a spiritual and a temporal king. The former \u2014 the Tui Tonga \u2014 was lord of the soil, and enjoyed divine honours in virtue of his immortal origin ; but he had an ever-diminishing share in the government, and he could take no part in any civil quarrel. His sole duty"], [312, "292 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. was to absolve his subjects from the penalties of the broken tabu, and to take the good things provided for him without descending into the arena of political strife : he was, in fact, the heaven -appointed sovereign in a limited monarchy. The temporal king \u2014 the Tui Kano kubolu \u2014 was the irresponsible sovereign of the people, wielding absolute power of life and death over his subjects, and was charged Avith the burden of the civil government and the ordering of the tribute due to the gods and their earthly representative, the Tui Tonga. None but the son or grandson of a Tui Tonga could succeed to that dignity, and his mother must be the daughter of the Tui Kano kubolu. The temporal king was therefore always grand father or uncle of the Tui Tonga. Thus was the blood kept pure. Although the Tui Tonga had no executive functions, yet, as representative on earth of the immortals, he was environed with the most rigid tabu. As it would be inconvenient to multiply personages of such transcendent rank, his Avife was always taken from him after having borne him two children. Her son was the heir, but her daughter attained an even higher rank than her father or brother. She was the Tui Tonga fefine (female Tui Tonga), and even her father must bow to her for absolu tion of the tabu. No mortal might aspire to marriage with her, but she might, without loss of dignity, have children, and her daughter, if she had one, became the Tamaha \u2014 the highest earthly dignity.

These higher dignities, however, were a superstructure built of the high estimation in which women were held upon the fundamental idea of the divine affinity of the Tui Tonga. The key to this belief is to be found in the epic of Kau-ulu-fonua, from whose reign Tongan history may be said to date.2 The following is an unworthy prose version of the story : \u2014 In clays of old the Tui Tonga was lord of all Tonga \u2014 lord of the soil and of the men, and of the first-fruits ; and to no other chief was tribute paid but to the Tui Tonga only. He received tribute from Haapai, from Haafulu hao,3 from Niuafo'ou/1 from Niua-tobutabu,6 from 1 A salute paid to the highest chief present. The person performing it sits cross-legged before him, aud bows the head until the forehead touches the sole of the chief's foot, and then brushes the foot first with the palm and then with the back of eacli hand. After touching a chief's person the moemoe must be performed on pain of the liver swelling up and causing death. As they are subject to scrofulous diseases, which they attribute to an unwitting breach of the tabu, they used to perform the moemoe frequently from motives of caution, without reference to any special tabu they had broken. 2 Circa 1535. There are fragmentary traditions of an earlier time when the Tongans were in a lower social state, and cannibalism was practised. A colony from Tonga founded a powerful clan in Mangaia (Cook Islands) before the end of the fifteenth century, and it is probable that Pylstaart was peopled from Tonga before the sixteenth century ; but the names of the kings before Kau-ulu-fonua are unreliable (vide Appendix I. ), and the traditions are too disconnected to be classed in their proper sequence. The old men who stored up these traditions have passed away, and it cannot now be hoped that the records of the dim past will ever be rescued from oblivion. 3 Vava'u. 4 Boscawen Island. 5 Keppel's Island."], [314, "294 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA.

The people of Tonga were so thick in the land that the commands of the king were carried from one end of the land to the other, the people lying on their mats and shouting the message one to the other. It was the time of \" Fanogonogo Tokoto \" (making proclamation when reclining).5 And seeing that all men were his slaves, and that the world held none that did not do him homage, the Tui Tonga put heavy burdens upon the people, and made them drag great stones and set them up for a memorial of his greatness ; and the people neglected their yam plantations to do the tasks set them by their king, so that there was a great scarcity. And when they hungered they began to cry out against their king, for men are ever hard to govern when their bellies are empty. Now there came a Tui Tonga, named Takalaua, who was strong and harsh, and was greatly feared of the people. Every day he sent out his fishermen from Mua into the bay, and they would land on the islands to arrange their nets. One day they landed on Ata, near Euaiki, and when they sailed the two old people who 1 Wallis Island. 3 Samoa. 2 Hoorn Island. 4 Gilbert Islands. 5 At the time of Tasman's visit in 1643 there seem to have been no villages.

They saw a bunch of cocoa-nuts and ran to pick it up, and when they reached the spot they saw lying near it the body of a little new - born child, but the head was like the head of a clove. The old woman took it up gently, and found that it still breathed. She had no children, and she begged her husband to let her adopt it and bring it up as her own ; and she took it home and reared it in secret. And as the girl grew up she lost the dove's head, and grew into the fairest woman that was ever born into the world. So fair was she that her foster-parents greatly feared lest some man should see her and take her from them ; and they taught her to hide always in the cover of the trees, and to look well abroad before she ventured into the sea to bathe, for great monsters floated on the sea, who, if they saw her, would swallow her up. But the days passed and she saw no one, for Ata was remote from the ways of men, and the fishermen knew it for a barren spot. Now there came a clay when the Tui Tonga sent his fishermen, bidding them return with fish, for he hungered for them. But the chief of the fishermen hesitated, saying that the weather was too stormy for their nets, whereat the Tui Tonga grew very wroth, and swore that unless he had fish that day the chief fisherman should die. So they went out into the bay and tried to cast their nets, but each cast was spoiled by the wind and waves, which twisted the net and drove the floats under. And towards evening the chief said, \" Let us at least try Ata : perchance the water is smoother there. Let us cast but once, and if we fail,"], [316, "296 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA then let us return and face the anger of the Tui Tonga, for only the gods could catch fish in this weather.\" So they sailed to Ata and cast their nets on the lee side of the island, but could catch nothing. And the chief fish erman left the others to roll up the nets and went round the beach of the island to look to windward. And as he passed the point he saw a girl bathing, who, seeing him, \" She fled swiftly up the sand.\" fled swiftly up the sand and was hidden in the trees; and he wondered greatly, for he knew not that any man lived on the island, and this girl was the fairest that he had ever seen. He said nothing to his companions, but returned to Mua with them, and went into the presence of the Tui Tonga. \" Where are your fish ? \" the king asked."], [317, "THE BORDERLAND OF MYTH. 297 \" The gods themselves could not take fish in such a sea. Pardon thy servants, for we have toiled as never man toiled before.\" \" Did I not say that unless you brought me fish you should die ? Have ye ever known me to lie ? Bring bamboos and the trough, and cut him in pieces.\" So they brought the great trough and the bamboo knives, and bound him with vines, unresisting. But when the king's cooks took the knives to cut his flesh he cried out, \" Let me speak one word to the Tui Tonga. If I must die I must. I do not ask for a life that is of no value to my chief ; but I know something that will never be known unless I tell it before I die.\" \" What does he know ? \" said the king : \" if he knew the secret of the wind to make it fair at will, yet it should not save him.\" And the men went to seize him again, but he cried, \" It is well : let me die, since the chief cares not for a beautiful girl.\" When he heard this the Tui Tonga cried, \" Stop. Do not harm him. What is this he says about a girl ? Let him tell us first : if he has fooled us then he shall die.\" And the fisherman said, \" What am I that I should lie to my chief ? I know the fairest girl in all the world, and if the chief wills I can bring her here.\" And the Tui Tonga said, \" Loose him and make ready a canoe ; but if he has lied to us, he shall be hewn in pieces with tortures.\" So they prepared the canoe, and the chief of the fisher men called his men together and they set sail, and dragged their canoe ashore at Ata ; and the chief fisherman bade"], [318, "298 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. his men wait near the canoe, and he went up alone into the trees. There he saw two houses, the one closed and the other open, and he went in and found an old woman sitting on the mats. And he said, \" I have come for the maiden to be the chief's handmaid.\" But she feigned not to understand him, and said, \" What maiden will you take ? Only I and my husband live on Ata, and we have seen no maiden.\" But he said, \" You cannot hide her from me ; for we are many, and you but two only. Come now, I will break clown the door of the house if you do not show her to me.\" And the old woman began to weep, crying for her only daughter ; but he bade her be of good heart, for she ought rather to rejoice that her daughter was chosen to be the handmaid of the Tui Tonga. And she said, \" Wait till I have prepared her for her lord ; \" and she took the girl and bathed her in the sea, and oiled her with scented oil, and bound flowering wreaths in her hair, weeping all the while, and took the finest mats of Haamoa, fringed with the pre cious scarlet feathers of the kula, and bound them round her slender waist, and brought her to the canoe. And the men who saw her were smitten with her beauty, for there had been no other woman born into the world so fair as she. And they set sail, leaving the woman weeping on the shore, and bore the girl away weeping for her foster mother's grief, and for fear of that which should befall her. And when they came near to Mua they saw a great crowd assembled at the landing-place, for the Tui Tonga in his impatience had left his house to watch for the return of the canoe ; and he kept calling to them to ply their paddles with a stronger hand. When they drew"], [319, "THE BORDERLAND OF MYTH. 299 near he cried out to them to tell her name ; and they re plied, \" Vae-lavea-mata \" (The-foot-that-wounds-the-eye). And he took her to his house. And when her first child was born he called him Kau ulu-fonua (Dweller-in-the-hilltops), and he ordered him to be taken away from his mother lest she should suckle him and her beauty be spoiled. So they took him to Niutao, and nursed him there. And a second child was born to her, and they called him Mounga-motua (Old-mountain), and his father ordered that he too should be taken from his mother, and nursed by one of her women. And a third child was born \u2014 a girl \u2014 who was called Melino-a- Tonga (The-peace-of-Tonga). Her also they took away. And Vae-lavea-mata grieved for her children whom she had never seen, so that when her fourth child would be born she besought the king earnestly that he would let the child be with her. \" For,\" she said, \" to what end have I suffered in bringing them forth, if I may not"], [320, "300 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. suckle them as other women suckle their children?\" And he granted her prayer, and let her suckle the child ; and she called him Lo-tawai. So he only of them all saw his father, the Tui Tonga. And as the years passed the Tui Tonga's face was changed towards his people, and he laid heavy tasks upon them, even in the planting-time, when every man should be in his own yam-garden. For he built a tomb for him- self in the burying -place of his fathers; but he would surpass them all, and bade the people hew great stones from the reef, greater than any of his fathers had taken for their malae. And the stone-cutters hewed a huge stone upon the Liku, like an island for greatness ; and the Tui Tonga sent to the people of Belehake, saying, \" Go, and drag the stone for the side of my malae; so I shall not be forgotten hereafter.\""], [321, "THE BORDERLAND OF MYTH. 301 They toiled at the stone all day, sore at heart, for it was planting-time, and in the evening they sent to Tui Tonga, praying that he would suffer them first to plant their yams, and afterwards return to drag the stone, for that it would take many days, and the time for yam planting was far spent. But he returned answer that they were idle and dishonoured his commands. And the people were afraid when they heard his answer, and gathered to gether to the stone before it was yet day. And the sun rose on their toil, but the stone was so heavy that when it was low in the west they had only reached the cave Ana meama, on the Liku, where there is fresh water. Their throats were dried up with thirst, and they crowded one upon the other in their haste to drink ; but so many were they that before they had all drunk the pool was dry, and they licked the mud, and cursed their king in their hearts. Then one said, \" How long shall we suffer this ? He has other tasks in his mind for us, and who knows whether we shall live or die, and our wives be given to others ? Shall we not take rest ? \" So they conspired that night to kill the Tui Tonga, and in the morning two old men, Tamajia and Malofafa of Belehake, met him in the path as he went to bathe, and slew him there, and cut up the body so that none might know it, and hung the limbs in a tree. And one of the king's women ran to Niutao, to tell the children that their father was dead. They were racing toy canoes in the shallow water ; and Kau-ulu-fonua, the elder, now almost grown to manhood, was intent upon his canoe, and saw not that the sea was rising and falling"], [322, "302 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. unnaturally, but his brother, Mounga-motua, saw it as he sat watching the game on the beach. And he cried, \"Chief, the sea is strange.\" But the elder, thinking only of his game, told him roughly to be silent. Then the younger saw the sea turn to blood, and as he again cried out in fear, the woman came and sat clown re spectfully before her chief, therefore the place is called Faete (Crouching-place) to this day. She said, \" I bring tidings (tala fo'ou) \" (therefore the place is called Tala fo'ou to this clay). \" The chief, your father, has been slain.\" Kau-ulu-fonua leaped to his feet, and seizing the mast of a canoe, he broke it into three pieces, and gave them to his brothers and to his sister, saying, \" Which of us knows our father ? Only the child Lo-tawai has seen him.\" And Lo-tawai answered, \" Yes, I shall know him.\" So they went forth, led by the woman, and came to the wood called Vao-tabu (Sacred Grove) in which the king had been slain ; and the woman led them to the tree in which their father's body hung in a basket. The place is called Tatatinga-o-Tui-Tonga, because the body was cut up there. And Lo-tawai looked on it and said, \" This is our father : I know the face for his face.\" 1 And they buried their father there, and called the people to them to war against his murderers, who fled to Eua. There Kau-ulu-fonua fought them and drove them out, and they fled to Haapai : thither the brothers pursued them, and they fled to Vavau. And as the avengers still 1 Penem etiam patris per granditatem mirabilem recognovit ; cui quidem nornen proprium datum erat, \"Ulie-hae-a,\" scilicet \" Anguis-qui-sepi menta-perrurnpit.\""], [323, "303 THE BORDERLAND OF MYTH. pursued, they launched forth upon the ocean, and sailed to Niua-tobutabu, aud thence before the wind to distant Niua-foou ; but even thither did Kau-ulu-fonua pursue them. And they fled northward again to Haamoa, whose ancient name was Hahafakamoa,1 and were driven out from thence. Then they put forth again, and fled to Uvea, and still they were pursued. So they fled west ward to Futuna ; and because this was the end of the world, and there was no land beyond them to which they might flee, they awaited the coming of Kau-ulu-fonua and his brothers with the remnant of their army. And when he landed, he prepared his men for war, and the men of Futuna, marvelling at his prowess, said, \" Thou art not brave of thyself, but by favour of the gods.\" And he mocked them, and cried, \" Then I will leave my back to the gods to defend, and myself defend my face.\" And as he was attacking the gate of the wall which his father's murderers had built, one of them wounded him in the back as he was passing through the gate. Thereat he cried, \" The gods are fools : they cannot even shield my back.\" And he seized the old man who had wounded him, and held him until his men came up ; and they took the town, and bound both the murderers, and brought them before him, and there was peace. Therefore to this day are there two divisions of Futuna \u2014 the one Futuna, and the other Futuna Tini because it was left unharmed by the war. And Kau-ulu-fonua told the people of Futuna that, as a reward to them for having helped him to seize his father's murderers, he would grant that they should always spoil the Tongan canoes that reached their 1 Hahafakamoa = beating like a cock's wings."], [324, "304 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. shores.1 And he gave to the people of Uvea that they should comb the hair of the Tongans who landed on their island with the tail of a sting-ray ; and to Niua that they should push away the canoes of the Tongans, and not let them land : therefore is Niua called Niua-teke-vaka (Niua the canoe spurner).2 Now the murderers were old men and had no teeth, and when they were brought before Kau-ulu-fonua, he ordered hard dry kava to be brought, and made them chew it before him, so that their mouths were filled with blood. And he bade them pour water into the bowl, and knead and strain the kava, and he drank the draught alone. Therefore was he named Kau-ulu-fonua-fekai (Kau-ulu-fonua the savage) ; and he slew his father's murderers in Futuna and returned to Tonga. When he was returned he called his brothers to him, and he said, \" I am the chief, but this people have dared to slay the Tui Tonga. What will they not dare ? And how shall the land stand fast if the chief be slain ? Now therefore it is my mind to set a chief over the people to govern them, and I will be supreme lord of the soil only, and of the offerings.\" And he made his brother, 1 When the Tongan matabule Kau Moala visited Futuna in 1808 he was spoiled of all his goods, and his canoe was broken up. On leaving he was presented with everything he required, but, despite his entreaties, nut a single article of his own property was returned to him. - After I had left Tonga I asked an old native of Futuna whether he knew any legends of a Tongan invasion. He wrote down for me an old Saga describing an invasion by the King of Tonga, who cried, when wounded in the back, \" The gods are fools ! \" The only difference in the two stories was that the Futuna account describes the utter rout of the Tongans with so great a slaughter that stacks were made of the dead bodies. Traditions so corroborated rise at once to the dignity of history."], [325, "1610.] 305 THE BORDERLAND OF MYTH. Mounga-motua, lord over the people, and sent him to the peninsula, calling him Tui Haatakalaua. Since that clay, though there have been wars in Tonga, and chief has fought against chief, yet the Tui Tonga has passed unharmed through them all, for he was lord of the soil only and of the offerings. And there came a Tui Haatakalaua, named Mounga tonga, who took to wife a chief woman of Haamoa (Samoa), of the land of Safata in Upolu, named Tohu'ia. She bore him a son, Ngata (Snake), from whom the lords of Kanokubolu, the kings of Tonga, are descended. For Moungatonga saw that they did not honour the chief whom they obeyed, but only him to whom they gave the offer ings ; and he made his son Ngata lord over the people and his descendants, and called him Tui Kanokubolu, and he himself was content to receive the offerings only. From this Ngata, child of the woman of Haamoa, were all the Tui Kanokubolu sprung, even to Tubou, the king. Such is the tradition of the origin of the curious politi cal system of Tonga that so puzzled Captain Cook. It is easy to divest the story of its envelope of heroic fiction, and to find the kernel of sound history. The chiefs in Polynesia represent the blood of the original family in its purest form, and to ancestor-worshippers they naturally become the living embodiment of the ancestral spirit. As the tribe grows in numbers and importance, they begin to receive semi-divine honours : with the superstitious respect comes power, and with power the inclination to abuse it. The people are goaded into resistance, and the chief, to protect himself and his successors, delegates the u"], [326, "306 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. executive power to an inferior chief, and by thus plac ing a buffer between himself and his subjects, he secures not only his own safety from popular outbreak, but an in creased reverence for the rigid tabu that begins to environ him. This evolution of a sacred line of chiefs is not pecu liar to Tonga, but the system was there complicated by a repetition of the process by which the temporal sovereign again delegated his authority ; and by the curious higher degrees of rank enjoyed by females of the spiritual chief's family, arising from the high estimation in which women were held. As Tongan history may be said to begin with the reign of Kau-ulu-fonua, it is important to fix approximately the date of his exploits. In Appendix I. will be found a list of the Tui Tonga from Kau-ulu-fonua to the last holder of the office. Since the visit of Captain Cook in 1777 the frequent civil wars, and the introduction of Christianity, caused years to pass without the installation of a Tui Tonga, and the office was abolished on the death of Lau filitonga. There have therefore been only four since that date. From 1643 to 1777, a period of 134 years, five Tui Tonga reigned for an average of twenty-seven years each.1 By the same computation the four Tui Tonga who preceded Tasman's visit in 1643 would have covered 108 years, and Kau-ulu-fonua was Tui Tonga in the year 1535. From a list of the Tui Kanokubolu it appears that there have been ten since 1777, and eight before that date, including Ngata, who was the first to assume the title. 1 Captain Cook found that the natives remembered the circumstances of Tasman's visit in 1 643, and were able to point out his anchorage, and to say correctly how many days he stayed. They gave the name of the Tui Tonga then reigning, and the names of five successors of the same dynasty."], [327, "1535-1610.] THE BORDERLAND OF MYTH. 307 Taking twenty years as the average reign of a Tui Kano kubolu before 1777 (for the short duration of reigns dur ing the past century was owing to the incessant civil wars that followed the murder of Tukuaho), the date of Ngata's assumption of the title would be about 1610. The Tui Kanokubolu was not strictly a hereditary office, like that of the Tui Tonga. None but a member of the reigning family could succeed, and a custom seems to have grown up of choosing the successor alternately from the families of the Tui Haatakalaua and the Tui Kanokubolu ; but it was always open to the principal chiefs, who formed the electoral college, to reject any aspirant to office who was physically, mentally, or morally unfit to reign. Two conditions weighed with them \u2014 the dying wishes of the late king, and the relative power and popularity of the candidates. The election took place immediately after the funeral ceremonies, when the entire nation was assembled ; and the election of the most influential chief was a guar antee against civil disorder. Considering the primitive character of the canoes and their ignorance of navigation, the geographical knowledge of the Tongans was already wide at this remote date. Their canoes must have often been carried out of their course to Fiji, which lies only 400 miles direct to leeward. That they made voyages to and from Samoa in the sixteenth century is shown by the fact that Ngata's mother was a woman of Upolu in Samoa ; and the pursuit of his father's assassins by Kau-ulu-fonua shows that they knew of the existence of the Niuas, Uvea, and Futuna, as early as the sixteenth century. A very ancient saga describing the customs of one of the Line Islands indicates that they were visited at a very remote date.

If their young men wanted excitement, there was Fiji : there they might have their fill of war and rap ine, but in Tonga they must obey the chiefs set over them by the gods or brave the consequence of the broken tabu. In those days no Tongan had dared to test the belief. It was not a superstition. They had seen men die whom they knew to have infringed a tabu, and others, cursed by some enemy, had withered away before their eyes. Thus was royal authority strengthened by physical fear \u2014 ever the strongest influence with the mob.1 For sixty years the land was at peace. They built great tombs for their chiefs, and turned the islands into vast gardens, so that there was abundance, and rich portions of the first-fruits were presented to the gods. Then Mou ngatonga, the Tui Haatakalaua, took the Samoan woman Tohuia to wife, and when her son Ngata grew to man hood, Moungatonga grew wearied with the weight of authority, and charged him with the dominion of the people, while he withdrew himself into the honoured obscurity of rank without power. The new temporal king took his title from the sacred soil of Kanokubolu 1 Now that the bugbear of the tabu has been put to flight before the light of Christianity, they have preserved the belief in a changed form. They believe that he who swears falsely, after kissing the Bible, must die.

The natives crowded on board his ships to barter provisions for iron, but beyond pilfering when unobserved, they did not annoy their visitors.

Four kings had reigned and had been laid in their"], [333, "1767.] THE COMING OF THE FOREIGNERS. 313 malae when foreigners again set foot on the soil of Tonga. On August 13, 1767, Wallis, fresh from the discovery of Tahiti, brought to for one day at Niua-tobutabu, and gave the people a few nails in exchange for provisions. These gifts, so precious to a people still in the stone age, were at once carried to their suzerain chiefs in the islands to the far southward ; and when Captain Cook landed six years later in Tongatabu, he saw them in the hands of his entertainers. When the Discovery anchored at Hihifo on the 10th June 1773 the principal chiefs were absent in the islands to the northward, and he saw no one but Latelibulu, the brother of the Tamaha, whom, judging from the honour paid to him, he mistook for the king. Four years later he landed at Namuka in the Eesolution and Discovery, and met Finau Ulukalala, whose restless character had raised him from the position of hereditary chief of Vavau to one of greater power than the Tui Kanokubolu himself wielded. Cook thus describes him : \"He was tall and thin, and appeared to be about thirty years of age. His features were more of the European cast than any we had seen here.\" His evident authority in Namuka led Cook at first to suppose that he was king, but when he was confronted with Pau, the Tui Tonga, and performed to him the humble act of moemoe, he rated him as an impostor of that con temptible kind that pretends to a dignity to which he is not entitled. When, however, he realised in Tongatabu the extent of his influence with the older chiefs, and saw that even the Tui Tonga did homage to his female relative the Tamaha, he abandoned all hope of solving the mystery of the Tongan Constitution, and, for want of a better"], [334, "314 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1777. definition, elevated Finau to the dignity of Commander in-Chief. Anxious to keep the visitors to himself, Finau showed them the most lavish hospitality at Haapai, and did all in his power to persuade them to visit Vavau. But the Tui Tonga, attracted by the accounts of the priceless posses sions of the strangers, now arrived, and invited them to become his guests at Tongatabu. Finau, nothing abashed at having fallen in his visitors' estimation, followed in his own fleet, and encamped on the shore opposite the little island of Pangaimotu, where the ships were anchored. The white men were not always conciliatory. The peas ants, or serfs, were a noisy, uncouth set, who, when unre strained by their chiefs, treated the strangers with scant respect, and robbed them whenever they had an oppor tunity. In their eyes a successful theft was an achieve ment to be boasted of rather than a crime ; and as a serf has no soul, it was a matter of indifference to the chiefs how they were punished. Thieves were flogged almost daily on board the ships without disturbing the friendli ness of Finau in the least ; indeed he himself recom mended this punishment. An officer wrote in his journal : \" One was punished with seventy -two lashes for stealing only a knife ; another with thirty-six for endeavouring to carry off some drinking-glasses ; three with three dozen each for throwing stones at the wooders ; but, what was still more cruel, one man, for attempting to carry off an axe, was ordered to have his arm cut to the bone, which he bore without complaining.\" As no such punishment as seventy-two lashes was allowed in the navy at that time, and the writer was so evidently hostde to his com-"], [335, "1777.] 315 THE COMING OF THE FOREIGNERS. mander, it is probable that the severity of the punishments has been exaggerated. The chiefs owed their visitors no gratitude. Every present they had received, every condescension shown to them, had been repaid by liberal gifts of provisions. The ships were filled with treasures as precious in their eyes as gold would have been in the eyes of their visitors, and in a few clays they would sail away never to return. Why, 4 bo-me'e or night-dance at Haapai, Ju?tc 1777. (1 a steel engraving in the British Museum.) they thought, should they not prevent this ? For the de tails of the conspiracy they had recourse to Finau, who had seen more of the white men than any of the others. Preparations had already been made for the assemblage of a vast concourse for the performance of dances in honour of the visitors : what would be easier than to fall upon the white men during a night dance by torchlight, conceal the bodies, and, when a party came from the ships to look for"], [336, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1777. 316 their commander, to lead them inland and massacre them ? The ships thus weakened would be an easy prey. But Finau thought that the attempt should be made by day light, lest, in the confusion caused by the darkness, they should fail in boarding the ships. When he found that the majority were disinclined to adopt his advice, Finau declared that he would have nothing to do with the scheme, and it was reluctantly abandoned. On Tuesday, June 17, Cook and his officers attended the dances with out suspicion, surrounded by nearly 10,000 natives, who, if the signal had been given, would assuredly have suc ceeded in massacring the whole party.1 The gathering of so vast a crowd in the neighbourhood of the ships could not fail to produce disorder. There was a scarcity of food, and the parties landing for wood and water were insolently plundered. Several turkeys were stolen, and for the first time Cook determined to hold the chiefs responsible for the acts of their serfs. He landed with an armed guard, and without any warning put Finau and Maealiuaki, the Tui Kanokubolu, under arrest in their own house. A number of armed men now assembled with the evident intention of attacking the guard, but Finau, concealing his feelings, ordered them to disperse, and despatched messengers to recover the turkeys. As soon as these returned with the birds the guard was withdrawn, and their friendly relations were resumed. They still dined on board, and continued to send provisions to the captain. But when, a few days later, the muskets of one of the shore parties were stolen, and Cook proceeded on shore to repeat his policy, he found that the chiefs had wisely with- 1 Mariner's Account of the Tonga Islands."], [337, "1777.] THE COMING OF THE FOREIGNERS. O 1 r\u2014 ol I drawn, and it was not until he had given them solemn assurances of their safety that they consented to return. The stolen arms were eventually recovered through the medium of the chiefs, who were not in the least concerned that one of the thieves, who had been wounded with a ball, was not expected to live.1 Cook now prepared to leave Tonga, but contrary winds detained him long enough to witness the ceremony of the The great inaji at which Captain Cook was present, J anc- 17 (From a steel engraving in the British Museum.) inaji, or the presentation of the first-fruits to the gods in the person of the Tui Tonga, their representative on earth. The ceremonial, the dresses, the wooden symbols for the yams, puzzled him extremely. Though forbidden to ap proach, he forced his way into the inner circle that sur rounded the Tui Tonga, and was allowed to remain on the 1 This man was seen alive and well sixteen years later by D'Entrecasteaux- Labillardiere."], [338, "318 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1777. condition that he bared his shoulders; for the Tongans, then as now, did not expect foreigners to conform to their manners, and were lenient to any breach of their laws committed by a stranger in ignorance. On June 25 he set sail, after a stay of seven weeks, and not many months later met his tragic end in Hawaii from an over-confidence in the natives, which his experience of the Tongans (whom he misnamed the \" Friendly Islanders \") may have helped to engender. It seems strange that a people who, to both Tasman and Cook, appeared unaccustomed to the use of arms, should, twenty-two years after the visit of the latter, be found practising all the barbarities of savage warfare. What internal ferment, one asks, can have produced so abrupt a change ? Native traditionary history supplies the answer. Intercourse with Fiji was warping the Tongan character. At the time of Cook's visit increasing and regular intercourse with Fiji was rapidly changing the Tongans for the worse. Ethnologically, between Fiji and Tonga there is a great gulf fixed. The former belong to the great family of the Melanesians ; the latter to the pure stock of the light -skinned race, which, for want of a better name, are called the Malayo- Polynesians. The Fijians knew no higher form of society than that of the family or clan, shut up within its ow*n intrenchments, at perpetual war with its neighbours ; no nobler occupation than the devising of treachery against their enemies. But generations of peace had dulled the warlike instincts of the Tongans, and allowed their institutions to take a firm root. Timber for sea-going canoes was scarce in Tonga,"], [339, "THE COMING OF THE FOREIGNERS. 319 A warrior of Fiji."], [340, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1777. 320 and it was not until the eighteenth century that any but the principal chiefs could fit out expeditions for distant voyages. A little before 1750 several canoes had run down the wind to Lakemba, and their crews, after joining one or other of the local chiefs in war, and gaining him the victory by their superior daring, had taken their share of the spoil, exchanged their small canoes for larger craft, built of vcsi from Kambara, and returned to their own country laden with exotic plunder, and boasting of their foreign experiences. Thenceforth an expedition to Fiji became the keystone of a Tongan chief's education, just as in Europe at the same period the \" grand tour \" was considered essential to the training of an English gentleman ; and as our travellers brought back outlandish habits and strange wares, which were admired because they were foreign, so Cook found that the Tongans spoke of their neighbours as their superiors in war and in the useful arts. The cold-blooded treachery that will betray a brother to gratify the thirst for blood ; the brutal ferocity that spares neither sex nor age ; the depraved lust that is gratified in outrage on the dead ; the foul appetite of revenge that will eat the body of a slain enemy, \u2014 all these seemed to the young Tongan the badges of a manliness worthy of imitation. He regarded the comparative refinement of his own people as effeminacy, and vied with his fellows in imitating the accomplish ments of his more travelled countrymen. It would sur prise the Tongan of to-day to hear that his fathers looked up to the Fijians as his superiors.

The taste for licence engendered by intercourse with Fiji could not but have its effect upon the political situation of Tonga. The young chiefs chafed at their enforced inaction, for there was no scope for personal ambition in a State controlled by so firm a central Government. III. THE REVOLUTION. Tukuaho now became the central figure upon the stage. In his morose and cruel temper, his unbending policy, his tragic end, and the long years of bloodshed and misery that followed it, he stands out in the memory of his countrymen in lurid relief. About the year 1784 the Tui Tonga, Pau, who had so hospitably entertained Captain Cook, died, and Tukuaho immediately seized the estates claimed by his widow on behalf of her son Mau ulu-beko-tofa, who was still a minor. Her resistance was useless, and she was driven to take refuge in the island of Eua. It was the first sign of the waning power of the Tui Tonga, and the growing assumptions of the high temporal chiefs. Tukuaho's motive was doubtless to seize upon a conspicuous place and secure to himself in due course the reversion of the office of Tui Kano kubolu. About 1790 Finau Ulukalala died, and was suc ceeded by his brother under the same title. The younger Finau was Tukuaho's only rival for the leadership of the young party, and he, being occupied with the affairs of x"], [342, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1797. 322 Haapai, could not as yet interfere in the affairs of Tonga tabu. As soon as the office of Tui Kanokubolu became vacant by the death of Mulikihaamea, Tukuaho success fully schemed for the election of his father Mumui to the title, that he himself might wield the power. His father was already so old that he could not long stand in his way. Meanwhile a bitter jealousy sprang up between Finau and Tukuaho, none the less bitter that it was concealed. It was unfortunate for their country that the two men should have existed in the same generation. Both ambitious, both un scrupulous, both of inflexible purpose, the tiny stage was not large enough for both to play their parts, and a struggle to the death was inevitable. At this juncture the ship Duff, fitted out by the London Missionary Society, landed nine artisan missionaries, who at tached themselves to various chiefs, and were thus enabled to record the events of the most stirring times in Tongan history. Unfortunately for themselves, they quarrelled with two runaway sailors who had landed some months before them, The Tui Tonga's fish-hook. and were already in high favour with the chiefs ; and these men lost no opportunity of damaging them with the natives, by representing their religious services as witchcraft designed to destroy them, \u2014 a statement to which a prevailing epidemic among the chiefs gave colour."], [343, "1797.] 323 THE REVOLUTION. Mumui was now very infirm, and not likely to survive many months. The executive power had therefore passed into the hands of his son Tukuaho, who lived at Hihifo, but virtually governed the whole island. The power of the spiritual chiefs had so far declined since Cook's visit that the missionaries describe the Tui Tonga as coming below the Tui Kanokubolu in power and influence. On the 29th May 1797 Mumui died, in spite of the sacrifice of one of his relations at the shrine of the gods. Two of his widows, after the custom of Fiji, now fast becoming the fashion, were strangled at his grave, and the usual scenes of barbarous grief ensued.1 At the close of the funeral ceremonies Tukuaho was formally elected Tui Kanokubolu, and inducted with the ceremony of kava drinkkig. He is thus described by a contemporary : \" He is a stout man, and may be about forty years of age, is of a sullen, morose countenance, speaks very little, but when angry bellows forth with a voice like a roaring lion.\" Possessed at last of the supreme power in name as well as in substance, he gave rein to his instincts \u2014 the instincts of a beast of prey. Many stories are told of bis cruelties : how for a mere whim, worthy of a Commodus, he ordered the right arms of twelve of his servants to be amputated ; how, as a punishment for a woman who had offended him, he had her sawn asunder lengthwise while still alive.2 But these were not the true causes of Finau's hatred against him, though they served as an excuse for his ambition and insatiable restless ness. Against a more popular ruler he would not have dared to rebel ; but the savage and wanton cruelties of 1 'Missionary Voyage of the Duff.' 2 Mariner's 'Tonga.'"], [344, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1799. 324 Tukuaho had rendered him so unpopular, that it was easy to gain adherents to the cause of rebellion. He had long been gathering the young men round him, thus taking the position which Tukuaho had himself used to raise himself to the position he held. At last the opportunity came. It was the time of the annual inaji, or the offering of the first - fruits to the Tui Tonga, when the whole nation gathered to Mua to implore a bountiful harvest from the gods. At such a time enmities and political distinctions are laid aside, and the Tui Tonga becomes for the time, as of old, the head of the nation. Thus when Finau and Tubou Niua, the tributary chiefs of Haapai and Vavau, arrived at Mua with a large body of followers carrying their share of the offering, there could be no suspicion of their designs. In the evening they took leave of the chiefs and set sail with their followers as if bound for Haapai, but in reality to wait on one of the small islands at the mouth of the lagoon until the people, wearied with dancing, should be asleep. In the dead of night they landed on the coast some miles from Mua, and returned overland to the capital. The night was very dark, and they had to feel their way to the door of the king's house. When Finau had posted guards in every ap proach, Tubou Niua, whom he had put forward to do the deed, crept into the house among the sleeping forms, until he could smell the precious sandal-wood-oil with which he knew the king's head only could be anointed. Unwilling that he should die in ignorance of the hand that struck him, he smote him on the face with his open palm, and, as the sleeper started up, he cried, \" It"], [345, "1799.] THE REVOLUTION. 325 is I, Tubou Niua, that strike,\" and immediately shattered his skull with a tremendous blow from his club. He snatched up Tukuaho's adopted son, whom he wished to save, and rushed out of the house as Finau's guards ran in to kill the women just awakened. The alarm was now given. The frightened attendants tried to escape the unknown danger by flight to the bush, but in every road they were met by Finau's guards aud struck clown. Hastily collecting their party, the assassins made for the beach and broke up all the canoes but those sufficient to transport them to the eastern end of the island. The sun rose at Mua upon a scene of bewilderment and con fusion. Men from all parts of the island were crowding into the town ; warriors, hastily armed, were blackening their faces for war ; women were wailing over the dead ; and old matabides went from group to group exhorting them to avenge the death of their chief. To Muliki haamea \u2014 now the most important executive chief in the island after the dead king \u2014 they all looked to lead them against the murderers, whom they knew to be awaiting the turn of events at Hahake. The hopes of the Eoyalist party were centred in him, but he would take no decisive action, and the half-hearted expedition despatched against the rebels returned in the evening with the loss of half their number, aud reported that Finau had sailed to Haapai for reinforcements. Three days later he re turned with ten war - canoes carrying a large body of men. Thousands had now joined Mulikihaamea, who was expected to dispute Finau's landing ; but, to the dismay of the Eoyalists, he went over with his whole force to Finau, and together they swept the country as"], [346, "326 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1799. far as Mua, driving their enemy before them to Hihifo. The eastern and central portions of the island were thus ranged against the western. Tradition has left us no clue to the motive of Mulikihaamea, but, to judge from Finau's subsequent conduct, it seems probable that the rebels were assured of his support before they ven tured to strike the blow.1 For the events that followed we have the accounts of the missionaries who accompanied the Eoyalist army ; of the apostate Vason, who actually fought on the side of the rebels ; and the descriptions given by the natives to Mariner eight years later. Tukuaho fell on the night of the 21st April 1799. The missionaries were scattered throughout the different districts, each living under the protection of some leading chief, who, though willing to protect them during times of peace, was quite unable to restrain his people after war had broken out. With the first news of the rebellion the serfs broke clown all restraint, and slaughtered pigs and fowls wholesale to compensate them for their enforced abstinence in times of peace. For the first fortnight there was no general engagement, but there were slight skirmishes which served to embitter the hostility between the two parties. One of the rebels was taken prisoner, and was cut up alive and eaten, \u2014 a reversion to cannibal ism, after the lapse of two centuries, that was owing, doubtless, to the baleful example of Fiji. Ata, the hered itary chief of Hihifo, ordered the bones of Finau's father to be exhumed, and hung upon a tree in Pangaimotu. This was the grossest insult that could be offered to the 1 Vason's ' Four Years in Tongatlibu.'"], [347, "1799.] THE REVOLUTION. 327 Ulukalala family, and it served several chiefs as an excuse for deserting to the rebels. On the 9th May news reached Hihifo that the rebels were advancing, supported by Finau's fleet of fifteen sail of canoes. Their plan was to shut the Eoyalists up in the narrow promontory of Hihifo and utterly destroy them. The rebel army, led by Mulikihaamea in person, marched on the evening of the 9th as far as Teikiu, and despatched an advance - guard to reconnoitre. Among these was Vason. This party advanced till nightfall, and then took shelter for the night in a house near the road without taking the precaution of posting sentries. The Eoyalists meanwhile, led by Ata, left Hihifo at four o'clock in the afternoon, halting during the night to allow a party time to push to the front. The night was very dark, and they crept forward, each holding the belt of the man in front of him. They could have slaughtered the rebel outpost as they slept, but they chose rather to pass them and take the main body by surprise at Teikiu. At daybreak the rebel outpost was surprised by the main body of the Eoyalists. They observed no sort of order or formation, and in a few moments they were in full flight. They rallied again at the end of the cross-road that led to the position of their main force ; but the enemy, leaving a small force to keep them from effecting a junction, ran off to reinforce their comrades then engaged with Muliki haamea. At the sight of this reinforcement the rebel army, which had been taken by surprise at daylight, was filled with dismay. Their leader tried in vain to restore confidence: they wavered and fled. In his efforts to rally them Mulikihaamea was left behind in his litter, and the"], [348, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY\" OF TONGA. [1799. 328 enemy, making a sudden rush, surrounded the twenty people who formed his guard and overturned the litter. They gave no quarter to his companions, three of whom were women ; and while they hesitated to slay so great a chief, a man ran up crying, \" Kill him ! \" and upon the sudden impulse he was clubbed where he lay. After the death of their leader the rebels made no further stand, and the Eoyalists pursued until they reached Haateiho, where three of the missionaries, who had declined to ac company either army, were still living. They had been warned by the fleeing rebels to come with them, but, trusting in their known neutrality, they preferred to remain to protect their houses. Among the Eoyalists was a man to whom they had refused an axe which he coveted. Calling to his companions, this man set upon them, clubbed them, and looted their house. Tired of pursuit, the Eoyalists returned and found that the rebel outpost had succeeded in driving off the few men who had been left to keep them in check, and were trying to succour their wounded. They now set off in full flight for the coast, pursued by the victors. On their way they met Finau's contingent, who had just disembarked. By their direction they continued their flight, drawing the enemy across the beach towards the canoes. Suddenly they turned and fell upon their pursuers, who, taken by surprise, dropped Ata's litter and took to flight. There was now a debate as to what should be done with their prisoner, who was related to one of the chiefs who had captured him. This chief, unwilling to seem partial to an enemy, wished them to kill him, but his attendants insisted that, out of respect for himself, the prisoner's life"], [349, "1799.] THE REVOLUTION. 329 should be spared. They therefore retired and called to his sons, who came forward and bore him off in his litter. The three surviving missionaries, who had accompanied the victorious army, had left it very early in the day, disgusted with the acts of ferocity they had seen. In one place they had come upon an old man in the act of cooking part of the body of an enemy, intending ap parently to eat it ; in another a man was celebrating his triumph over a fallen chief by cutting up his body, \u2014 and even some of the women dipped their hands in his blood and licked them. On their return to their house in Hihifo, they found that it had been looted by their own party and destroyed. In despair they took refuge among the caves on the deserted Liku. The rebel army passed the night in their canoes. At daybreak they saw that the enemy was preparing to attack them in force as soon as they landed, hoping to take them by surprise at the sacred enclosure of Pangai, the burying-place of the Tui Kanokubolu ; but Finau, warned of their intention, landed his men and attacked them simultaneously from three points. After an ob stinate resistance they fled to the enclosure within which stands the king's tomb, hoping that the sanctity of the place would protect them. The rebels, not daring them selves to desecrate the place, applied to Vason, who set it on fire. No quarter was given, and the refugees, driven out by the fire, were all slain, except a few women who preferred slavery to death. These became the property of their captors. The victors now dragged the dead bodies to the shore, exhausting their ingenuity in insulting them,"], [350, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1799. 330 and there had roasted, and begun to eat them, when the enemy returned to the attack. There was a rush for the canoes. Overloaded and nearly sinking, they put off from the shore before the fugitives could all embark. One canoe laden with men and women was aground, and its occupants, together with those left behind, were all massacred. The remnant of the rebel army succeeded in reaching the island of Atata, where they were confined for three clays by a severe gale : they spent the time in murdering the defenceless inhabitants, who were supposed to have Eoyalist sympathies. From Atata they sailed to Mua to take counsel for a renewal of the attack. The missionaries, who had taken refuge on the Liku, now ventured to come out of their hiding - place and accompany a number of the Eoyalists to Maofanga. This is a sacred spot, situated a mile to the eastward of Nukualofa, which, from the rigid tabu that attached to it, had become a place of refuge never violated by war. In a few clays Finau's army made another descent upon Hihifo by sea, and on May the 29th, after an obstinate engagement, they utterly routed the enemy. On the 3d of June he summoned the refugees before him at Maofanga, and allowed all except ten of the leaders to go free. Mafi, the bravest and most influential of the Eoyalist warriors, and nine others were sentenced to various pun ishments. Some, bound hand and foot, were taken out to sea and put adrift in leaky old canoes, while Mafi and the others were led to the canoes amid the loud lamentations of their wives and children, and landed at Lofanga, a small island of the Haapai group, where they were bound naked to cocoa-nut-trees and left to starve to"], [351, "1800.] 331 THE REVOLUTION. death. There, exposed to the heat of the sun, to raging thirst and hunger, they were tortured by the boys of the place, who amused themselves by sticking spears into their flesh, or by showing them food to tantalise them ; yet some of them lingered till the eighth day, and all bore their sufferings without complaint. The people of Lofanga still say that at night they hear the groans of the spirits that haunt the spot. Having settled the affairs of Tongatabu, Finau Uluka lala returned to Haapai. He found a body of Eoyalists drawn up to meet him at Haano, who after a sharp conflict surrendered to him. He disarmed the lower orders, and punished the chiefs with the same barbarity he had practised on the chiefs of Hihifo. From Haapai he sailed with Tubou Niua to Vavau, which submitted to him after a desultory warfare lasting for several weeks. For nine months there was peace. The Hihifans had not in truth accepted the new order, but they had not recovered sufficient strength to resist. On the 24th of January 1800 the privateer Betsy, with a Spanish prize in tow, took away all the survivors of the ill-fated mis sion except the apostate Vason. A few days later, while a party of Finau's men were at Hihifo collecting provisions to relieve the scarcity at Haapai, the rebellion against Finau broke out. A party of Hihifans ravaged the cen tral district, burning and laying waste, and at last hemmed in the Haapai men at the narrow promontory of Hihifo. Here they took an ample revenge for the wrongs they had suffered. When the slaughter was ended they made stacks of the bodies, laying them transversely one upon another."], [352, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1800. 332 As soon as the news reached Finau he set sail with all his forces from Haapai, and disembarked at Hahake, the eastern end of Tongatabu, in order to procure provisions for his army ; but he found that the country had been utterly laid waste by the enemy. He therefore lost no time in coasting westward. In Hihifo he met an unex pected check. The enemy had intrenched themselves behind earthworks surmounted with a strong reed fence. He tried in vain to force the gate, and when his men were wearied with repeated attacks the enemy rushed out and put them to flight. They ran for their canoes, and sailed at once for Haapai. Finau was now driven to revenge himself by a series of night attacks. He would arrive off the coast at nightfall, and post men in every road leading to the fortress. A sudden attack would then be made, and the enemy, taken by surprise, would rush into the country for shelter, where they were struck down by the men in ambush. Before the alarm could spread to the neighbouring forts Finau's men had re-embarked and were under sail for Haapai. These expeditions were made in a single canoe carrying 250 men. The planting season had come and gone, and the con stant alarms had prevented any provision for the ensuing year from being made. The object of every hostile expe dition had been to destroy as much of the crops as pos sible. The year 1800 opened, therefore, with a terrible famine in Tongatabu, while in Haapai the land proved insufficient to support the large number of men congre gated there. Each district had thrown up intrenchments, within which the people lived, not daring to resume the cultivation of their lands. Many were driven to can-"], [353, "1806.] THE REVOLUTION. 333 nibalism for the support of life, and the warfare between the different fortresses degenerated into mere head-hunt ing expeditions. Tukuaho had been nominally succeeded by Maafuli muloa, and upon his death, a few months later, Tukuaho's eldest surviving son, Tubou-malohi, was proclaimed Tui Kanokubolu, albeit a king without subjects. Safe within their fortresses the petty chiefs acknowledged no superior ; and Tubou-malohi was so harassed by Takai, the one-eyed chief of Bea, that he became in reality a fugitive from his own subjects. Misfortunes attended all his enterprises. Having failed to avenge his father's death upon Finau and Tubou Niua, he set sail for Fiji. There he remained in voluntary exile for nearly five years ; but in 1805, hearing that Finau's descents upon Tonga had become mere annual predatory expeditions, he returned and built a large for tress on the hill at Nukualofa. In 1806 an event occurred that vastly strengthened Finau's position. An English privateer, the Port - au - Prince, put into Haapai for repairs, having on board Mr Mariner, the son of one of the owners. The crew were mutinous, and insisted on going ashore, and the temptation was too great for Finau. They were massacred, and the ship was then surprised and captured by the natives. Air Mariner became a great favourite with Finau, with whom he spent four years, and to his captivity we are indebted for a most charming book of travel. With the carronades of the captured ship, manned by English sailors, Finau made an attack upon Tubou-malohi's fortress and destroyed it with great slaughter. But instead of pursuing his victory he withdrew, and had the mortifi-"], [354, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1808. 334 cation of seeing his works burnt by Takai, his pretended ally, as he was sailing away. Tubou-malohi henceforth became a wanderer from fortress to fortress, taking refuge with his tributary chiefs, being driven out by each of his hosts in turn, until at length he became the guest of Teukava x in Hihifo. Unfortunately for both of them, his restless spirit could not be satisfied with inaction. They laid siege to the neighbouring fortress of Nukunuku, against the advice of their matabules, and in attempting to garrison it, Teukava lost his life. Emboldened by his death, his enemies attacked the fortress at Hihifo, and although they were beaten off by the bravery of its de fenders, yet Tubou-malohi feared to remain there. He accordingly despatched an embassy to his younger brother, Tubou-toa, then Governor of Haapai, begging him to in tercede with Finau Ulukalala to allow him to live in security at Haapai. In due course the two brothers visited Vavau, and the elder did homage to his father's murderer and his own subject. It must have been a proud moment for the usurper. Tubou-malohi lived in retirement in Haapai until 1812, leaving his kingdom of Tongatabu to the civil war and anarchy that he had been unable to repress. Tubou-toa, though he had given in his adhesion to the stronger party, had not forgotten the murder of his father. He had taken a solemn vow not to drink from a cocoa nut-shell until he had had his revenge upon Tubou Niua, and his submission to Finau, whom he knew to be equally guilty with his brother, was designed to bring him nearer 1 This chief had a white woman, Eliza Mozer, for his wife. She was taken from the American ship Duke of Portland."], [355, "1807.] THE REVOLUTION. 335 to his object. Tubou Niua, as Governor of Vavau, had become very popular with his people. He was of a brave and open character, little fitted to cope with the cunning of his inveterate enemy, who lost no opportunity of poison ing Finau's mind against him. He was, he said, plotting a rebellion against Finau's authority, and he habitually neglected to send tribute of the value due to Finau's rank and power. At last he openly proposed his assassination ; and Finau, never deaf to any proposal that would advance his own interests, even at the cost of the treacherous murder of a brother, listened to him. The murder is thus described by an eye-witness : \u2014 One evening, about an hour before sunset, the king desired Mr Mariner to accompany him and his daughter to Mahina Fekite, about three-quarters of a mile off : he was going, he said, to consult an old chief, Toki-ae-moana, who resided there, upon some political business. Finau usually carried with him a large whaling-knife (the blade of which was 2 feet long and 3 inches wide). Mr Mariner, observing on this occasion that he did not take his knife, asked him if he should take it, and carry it for him: he replied, \" Xo, I have no need of it.\" Mr Mariner obeyed, and followed him and his daughter unarmed. In their way they came near to a pool, and Finau stepped aside to bathe, previously sending an attendant to Tubou Niua to desire him to come to him. By the time he had done bathing Tubou Niua arrived, and all four pursued their walk to the old chief's house, where, when they arrived, the two chiefs and Finau's daughter entered the inside fencing, while Mr Mariner went into a house within the outside fencing, and remained in conversation with a female attendant of Finau's daughter. They had not been long here before Tubou-toa came in, and shortly after went out again. There entered soon after four men belonging to him, who immediately began to take down the sail, mast, and spars"], [356, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1807. 336 of a small canoe, stating as their reason, when questioned by the woman, Tubou-toa's orders to prepare a canoe : having taken what they wanted they went out. In about two hours Finau came out of the inner fencing, followed by Tubou Niua and his own daughter. As they passed on, Mr Mariner followed her, and the female attendant walked last. It was now night, but somewhat moonlight. As they passed the corner of the outer fencing, Tubou-toa and the four men just spoken of rushed from their hiding-place, and made a violent assault on Tubou Niua. The first blow of a club he received on his shoulder (intended for his head). He immediately exclaimed, \" Oi-au-e Finau, ten mate?\" (0, Finau, am I to be killed?), and retiring a few steps, he set his back against the fencing. Finau, who was several paces in advance, immediately made what was thought to be a feigned attempt to defend him, exclaiming, \" Oi-au-e seuke, kuo mate ae tangata ! \" (Alas ! this noble man is killed;) but he was held from his strong, yet pretended, endeavour to run to his assistance by some other attendants of Tubou-toa, who came up and forced Finau into the fencing. (It must be recollected that Finau did not choose to bring his whaling-knife with him.) Tubou Niua, who was without any offensive weapon, as he had been without any suspicion, warded off several blows with his hands and arms till, these being both broken, he was unable to lift them up, when a blow from Tubou-toa on the head made him stagger, another knocked him down, and he was beaten as long as signs of life remained, and for some time after. At this moment a young warrior, whose name was Latuila, and whose father had been formerly killed under suspicions, strong suspicions, of conspiracy by Tubou Niua, came up to the spot possessed by a spirit of implacable revenge. He struck the body of the dead chief several times, and exclaimed, \" The time of vengeance is come ! Thou hast been long enough the chief of Vavau, living in ease and luxury, thou murderer of my father ! I would have declared my senti ments long ago if I could have depended upon others to second"], [357, "1807.] THE REVOLUTION. 337 me : not that I feared death by making you my enemy, but the vengeance of my chief, Tubou-toa, was first to be satisfied, and it was a duty I owed the spirit of my father to preserve my life as long as possible that I might have the satisfaction to see thee thus lie stinking \" (dead). He then repeated the blows several times upon his stomach. In spite of Finau's positive denial of complicity with the murderers of his brother, he did not deceive the chiefs of Vavau. In Haapai, in the centre of Finau's army, they were at a great disadvantage. When the stone was let down upon the tomb of their murdered chief, one of the assassins publicly challenged any of them to single combat ; but none of them accepted, preferring to reserve their revenge. They swore allegiance to Finau upon a con secrated bowl, and received his commands to put them selves under the authority of his aunt, Toe-umu ; and all, except the late chief's matabulcs, who were kept back by Finau, returned to Vavau. But a fortnight later the news came that Toe-umu herself had declared her independence of Finau, who had so treacherously allowed the death of his brother, her great friend. They had built the largest fortress ever seen in Tonga, and they were prepared to resist Finau to the death. While the preparations for an invasion of Vavau were being made, Finau's son, Moengangongo, and Vuna, the former Governor of Vavau, arrived from Samoa, where they had been absent for some years. One of their canoes, with sixty people on board and all their treasures, was lost in a gale which the other five succeeded in weathering. Finau, in obedience to an oracle, first visited Vavau alone to endeavour to make terms with the inhabitants, Y"], [358, "338 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1808. but they would only consent to listen to him on the condition that he would cut off all communication with Haapai. He therefore returned to Haapai and embarked his forces, about 5000 men and 1000 women, in fifty war canoes, with four carronades and ammunition. The siege lasted many months, and the garrison only submitted in obedience to the gods, and after imposing conditions upon their assailants to take no revenge upon any of them. These conditions were not observed. Finau heard, or pre tended that he had heard, of a plot upon his life. Several of the leading chiefs were seized at his kava-party, bound, and summarily despatched ; but eighteen were reserved for the more signal punishment of being turned adrift in leaky canoes. On their way to the open sea they implored their executioners to knock out their brains instead of consigning them to the slow and ignominious death of drowning, and the request was granted in twelve cases. The other six, all chiefs of high rank, were turned adrift, and died regret ting their foolishness in trusting to the honour of Finau. In Finau's mind there was a growing scepticism regard ing the religion of his ancestors. He was now in the zenith of his prosperity, and he had never deserved well of the gods by submission to their will, or by regularity in his offerings. To him the institution of a Tui Tonga seemed a useless tax upon the people \u2014 a worn-out cult, a mere survival of the superstition of a darker age. He was proposing seriously to abolish the inaji, the great annual presentation of food to the Tui Tonga, which, in the famine that had succeeded the war, was very difficult to provide, when a great misfortune fell upon him. His daughter, after a long illness, died. While there was"], [359, "1809.] THE REVOLUTION. 339 still hope he humbled himself before the deities lie had slighted, and implored them to visit his sins on his own head rather than upon hers ; but the inspired priest answered that her death was required as an atonement for his continued neglect, and that a severer punishment was in store for him.

(From an engraving in the British Museum.) Tonga could not end with his life. He had found his country in peace and plenty, he left it torn by famine and civil war, having in his short life caused more bloodshed and human suffering than the aggregate in the whole of Tongan history before his time. A con temporary writer thus sums up his character: \"A char-"], [360, "340 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1810. acter like Finau's would have well suited the Greek drama. The great masters of that drama would have desired no better elements than are to be found in the history of this remarkable man : his remorseless ambition and his natural affections \u2014 his contempt for the fables and ceremonies of his country, when in prosperity \u2014 his patient submission to them, when in distress \u2014 his strong intellect \u2014 his evil deeds \u2014 and the death which was be lieved to be inflicted on him in vengeance by the over ruling divinities whom he defied.\" 1 He was succeeded by his son, Moengangongo, a chief of milder character, whose one desire was peace. His first act was to banish to Haapai the chiefs who were likely to plot against his Government, and to announce that hence forth all communication with Haapai would be at an end. His people were, he said, to devote themselves to cultivat ing the soil, and those who preferred less peaceful pursuits had this opportunity of joining Tubou-toa ; for after the canoes left there would be no further intercourse with the islands to the southward. A few months after his acces sion the Tui Tonga, Fatafehi Fuanunuiava, died, having reigned only four years, and the young chief, now to be known by the family title of Finau, seized the opportunity for carrying out his father's intention of abolishing the office. Like his father, he regarded the institution with its attendant ritual as a useless tax upon the people ; and he foresaw too that as long as the annual presentation of the inaji was continued, it would be impossible to cut off all intercourse with the outside world. The office was there fore abolished for some years, and when it was revived in 1 Quarterly Review."], [361, "1812-1820.] 341 THE REVOLUTION. the person of Laufilitonga, the last of the Tui Tonga, the ceremony of the great inaji had been discontinued too long to be resumed. Mariner, the only historian of this period, left in 1810 ; and for the events of the next few years we are depen dent upon native sources. In 1811 Finau II. died, and was succeeded by his uncle, Finau Fiji, otherwise known as Tuabaji \u2014 a wise and temperate chief, with greater experience if less natural mental activity than his nephew. Under his rule intercourse with Haapai was resumed, for he felt himself strong enough to keep dis orderly spirits in check. Haapai now became the political, as it was the geographical, centre of the kingdom. Tubou - toa had gathered round him the great warriors of Tonga, many of them trained in the arts of war as practised in Fiji. With him were his brother Tubou-malohi, the nominal Tui Kanokubolu, and Vuna, the banished chief of Vavau. To keep his warriors employed, he was obliged to make an annual descent upon Tongatabu without any decided success. In 1S12, however, Tubou-malohi died, and his brother became the natural successor, although bis mother had been a woman of inferior rank. He was duly elected to the post by the chiefs who were under his leadership, and he lost no time in invading Tongatabu.

[1820, 342 IV KING GEORGE. When Tubou-toa was establishing himself in Tongatabu, he did not leave the government of Haapai unprovided for. His son Taufaahau1 was now growing up to man hood. Born in the year 1797, be was two years old when the murder of his grandfather, Tukuaho, plunged the country into civil war. His childhood was spent among scenes of famine and bloodshed, the horrors introduced from Fiji, where boys of his age were taught to torture wounded prisoners in order to make them pitiless. He saw the crew of the Port-au-Prince struck down on the beach at Haano, and stood by while eight of his country men perished, stifled by the oil in the vessel's hold, in which they could not swim. He remembered the alarms of that night when his father slew Tubou Niua, and so avenged his grandfather's death. At an age when boys are still playing with toy canoes, he was join ing his father in the night attacks that have made his name a terror to Tongatabu. His great natural powers were enhanced by the most careful athletic training. As he surpassed his fellows in stature and length of limb, so was he their superior in all sports that demand skill. None was so fleet of foot, none could meet him in a wrestling- or a boxing-match, none could endure against him in swimming in the surf, nor handle a tafaanga laden 1 In this chapter King George is called Taufaahau until his accession to the throne under the royal name of Tubou."], [363, "1820.] KING GEORGE. 343 with fish in a seaway as he ; none was his match in a fight to the death. During one of the annual attacks upon Tonga, he had left his comrades near the canoe, and had gone a little way from the shore. Suddenly he found himself, armed with only a Fijian throwing-club, face to face with five assailants, who had lain in ambush for him. His followers were too far off for his voice to reach them, and he knew that against their long spears his throwing club could avail him little. He turned and ran before them, keeping just out of reach of their weapons, leading them inland towards a place that he knew of where the soil gave place to jagged limestone rocks. Little dis tressed himself, he ran on until he knew by their labour ing breath that his pursuers had begun to tail off. This was his opportunity. He turned and met the leading man, and struck him down before he could recover from his surprise. Seizing the spear that dropped from his hand, he fell upon the second and third, who, gasping for"], [364, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1822. 344 breath after their run, were at a great disadvantage. The other two did not await his onset, but fled, leaving him victorious. Such was his reputation as a warrior, that he was marked as the future leader of the Haapai people when he had scarcely attained manhood. He was twenty-three when his father died in 1820, and the unity of Tongatabu, bought by years of hard fighting, was again swept away by civil war. Taufaahau saw no advantage in following his father's example, who ever wearily pushed up the stone of conquest in Tongatabu only to see it roll back upon him weakened by his hopeless labour. The Govern ment of Haapai, impoverished as it was by the years of war, would give him work enough. For six years there was no Tui Kar^kubolu. The garrisons of Tongatabu still lived within their intrench ments, but they were tired of war, and for a time there was an armed peace. But a power was at hand which was destined to accomplish that which invading armies had fought in vain. In June 1822 a Methodist mis sionary named Lawry, fired by the writings of the sur vivors of the artisan missionaries landed by the Duff, made a second attempt to teach Christianity. The grow ing disbelief in the ancient superstitions that had led Finau Ulukalala to attempt the abolition of the great inaji, and to curtail the privileges of the Tui Tonga, had spread to Tongatabu. The influence of the priests had been undermined by the licence of war, and Lawry had not to face the difficulties that beset the pioneers of the Duff. He found the chief power in Tongatabu to be in the hands of Maealiuaki, or Talau as he was"], [365, "1826.] KING GEORGE. 345 also called, the son of Mulikihaamea, who was temporal sovereign before Mumui. He had married Kananga, a granddaughter of Mumui, who had just borne him a son, Tungi,1 who was through his grandfather, Mulikihaamea, the representative of the Tui Haatakalaua. Fortunately for Lawry's influence, in November 1823 a young chief named Futakava, who had been taken to New . Zealand and Sydney by a passing vessel, returned to Tonga. They had treated Lawry's accounts of the wonders of foreign countries with scepticism, but they did not think of doubting the evidence of one of their own countrymen, even when, after the manner of travellers, he indulged in exaggeration. But before Lawry could expect to reap the fruit of his labours he left the islands. His stay of fourteen months served, however, to pave the way for his successor. In 1826 two Tahitian teachers landed at Nukualofa and began to hold services ; and two months later a Mr Thomas, despatched by the Methodist Society in England, landed at Hihifo, and put himself under the protection of the chief Ata. For some months he had to contend against opposition, but in 1827 the spirit of curiosity was so far awakened in the natives as to make it safe for him to hold services in Nukualofa. At the close of the previous year Tubou, a half-brother of the murdered Tukuaho, was elected Tui Kanokubolu, and formally installed. It has been said that he was elected as a bribe to wean him from his leanings towards the new faith ; but a comparison of the dates of his appointment and Mr Thomas's arrival makes it more 1 Speaker of the Assembly, aud Tukuaho's father."], [366, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1827. 346 probable that his election was the result of a prolonged peace of six years, which gave the chiefs time to revert to the ancient constitution of society. One year after his election he publicly embraced Christianity, and a party, having for its object active resistance to the new faith, was immediately formed against him. Tubou was utterly wanting in force of character. His impulse to please every one led him to temporise with the heathen party, which was composed for the most part of chiefs who saw in the new faith a menace to their own power over their people. Had he been less vacillating he might have crushed the growing resistance to his authority at its birth, but his resolution failed him until it was too late. Against his irresolution the character of Taufaahau stood out in strong relief. He had long been sceptical about the gods of his ancestors, and his mind was ripe to imbibe new ideas. He had heard of the new teachings, and he longed to hear them for himself. He therefore wrote to Mr Thomas asking that a missionary might be sent to him. No white missionary was available at the time, and he had therefore to be content with Peter Vi,1 the ablest of the new converts. Bitterly disappointed, Taufaahau refused at first to receive him, but at last his curiosity prevailed, and he allowed Peter to teach him to write. As soon as he understood the teachings of the new religion he signed the death-warrant of the old. To silence the opposition of the native priests, he dragged Peter with him into many escapades intended to discredit the deities of his ancestors. They presented kava to 1 The same who visited us on a hand-cart in Haapai."], [367, "1831.] KING GEORGE. 347 the priestess of Haehaetahi, and beat the unfortunate woman, challenging her god to avenge the insult ; they hanged five idols by the neck, and burned the spirit houses, to convince the people by ocular demonstration that infringement of the tabu had no penalties. In 1827 Captain d'Urville in the Astrolabe anchored at Pangaimotu,1 and was attacked by a party of natives, who carried oft' with them one of his marines. Not being disposed to land, or apply to the local authorities, and knowing the evil character the people had earned in their attempts to take ships, he bombarded the island for two days without doing serious damage. Later in the year Peter Dillon, on his way to find the remains of de la Perouse's ill - fated expedition at Vanikoro, put in for a few days to secure interpreters. Finau Ulukalala III. (Tuabaji, alias Finau Fiji2), who now held independent sway over Vavau, following Tau faahau's example, had also written for a missionary ; but his motive proved to be that of mere curiosity, and he soon cast off his new professions. In April 1831 Tau faahau visited Vavau with twenty -four sail of canoes, on political business, and took that opportunity for attempting the conversion of his eccentric neighbour. It was a hard task, and he found it necessary to sail back to Haapai unattended to ascertain from the mis sionary whether it would be safe to promise Finau a missionary if he would consent to renounce his gods. Satisfied upon this point, he returned to the attack. Being before all things practical, Finau determined to give his fathers' gods one last chance before finally 1 Near Nukualofa. ~ Described by Mariner."], [368, "A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. [1832. 348 breaking with them. He had seven of the principal idols placed in a row, and addressed them as follows: \" I have brought you here to prove you, and I will tell you beforehand what I am going to do, so that you may have no excuse. I am going to burn you. If you be gods, escape ! \" But as the idols made no attempt to escape, he gave orders that the spirit-houses should be set on fire. Eighteen were thus destroyed ; but the weather being clamp, they took four clays to consume, and the people sat by terrified, waiting for the retribu tion that must follow such iniquity. Meanwhile Finau's brother prepared to oppose the new faith by force of arms. After plundering the outlying villages of Vavau, he intrenched himself on an uninhabited island. Finau called upon Taufaahau to help him out of the difficulty brought about by following his advice. At the head of a strong party of Haapai warriors he landed on the island, and tried his powers of persuasion upon the hostile force. Besides his physical prowess Taufaahau possessed another gift that appeals most powerfully to primitive man \u2014 eloquence. Often when his men were jaded, hungry, and dispirited, a few words from him would turn their thoughts from their own sufferings to the glory to be won by fiery courage and the shame of failure. \"When Tubou spoke like that,\" said one of his chiefs, \" the warriors would not wait to hear the end, but rushed upon the enemy and bore them clown.\" While the enemy still hesitated he prepared for the at tack, but they did not await his onset. They threw open the rude gateway and sued for peace. No blood was shed, but the leader was banished to Fiji, and a number of his"], [369, "1833.] 349 KING GEORGE. followers were taken to Haapai as prisoners of war. This moderation on the part of conquerors was the first-fruits of the new faith, for by ancient usage the lives of the chief rebels would have been forfeited. In 1833 Finau Ulukalala died, and on his deathbed committed the government of Vavau to Taufaahau until his heir should be grown up. Upon this the Boman Catholic missionaries have founded a charge of usurpation against King George which may be easily answered. The heir died, and before his successor had attained manhood Tonga had become a united kingdom with a Constitution, and to give Vavau an independent government would have brought the whole fabric to the ground. But Tubou showed me on more than one occasion that he was uneasy about Finau's dying charge. Taufaahau was now in reality an independent sovereign of the joint kingdoms of Haapai and Vavau, and was free to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Tui Kanokubolu or not as he pleased. Under his influence the new religion had been embraced by the people of Haapai and Vavau with all the emotional zeal of new converts. In their restless energy, and the ease with which enthusiasm or suspicion may be excited in their minds, the Vavauans are a race distinct from their neighbours of the southern groups, \u2014 as distinct as the contrast between their moun tainous romantic island and the flat shores of Haapai and Tongatabu. They may be violent partisans or bitter enemies \u2014 they cannot be neutral. They are, in short, the Irish of Tonga. It was not long before the mis sionaries, by awakening this curious quality of hysterical enthusiasm, had established over them a clerical despot-"], [370, "[1837. 350 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. ism that made them independent of political changes. But against the silent forces of inherited enmities in Tongatabu, the legacy of years of civil war, Christian ity could make no headway. It was enough that Tubou the king had accepted the white man's religion for the chiefs averse to his rule to remain heathen. That Tui Vakano had been converted was reason enough for Lavaka, lord of Bea, to continue unregenerate. In 1835 the chief holding the title of Tui A7akano joined the missionaries, and his people formally deprived him of his title, and expelled him from their midst. Furious at the treatment he had received, he reported that the heathen party were determined to depose King Tubou by force of arms. The Christians immediately threw up intrenchments at Nukualofa, and thus pre cipitated the outbreak of hostilities. But a severe hurri cane, that destroyed the food supplies, compelled both parties to remain inactive throughout 1836. At this juncture it is probable that the king might have averted war had he shown the least firmness or energy ; but as he made no effort to win over the hostile party by diplomatic means, and the missionaries were powerless to quell the strife they had raised, civil war became inevitable. In January 1837 the Christian party took up arms with the avowed object of suppressing a rebellion, and met a body of the heathen near Bea, defeating them. \" The heathen party could put more fighting men into the field, and Tubou therefore sent to Taufaahau for reinforce ments from Haapai.

By the middle of March the struggle was at an end and peace was declared, but still neither party felt safe outside of their intrenchments. The principal con ditions imposed upon the heathen were that no person should be persecuted for bis religion. They did not long keep their undertaking. Both at Hihifo and Bea the new converts were subjected to petty annoyances that more than once drove them to arms again, and goaded several to return to the gods of their forefathers. But the threatened renewal of civil war did not prevent the hostile parties from meeting on the occasion of a great national festival. On the 14th of May 1837, Tui Belehake, a chief of the family of the Tui Tonga, married Charlotte, Taufaahau's daughter. At this mar riage all the heathen chiefs attended and mixed with the Christian chiefs on friendly terms.1 One can sympathise with the feelings of the heathen chiefs. The new religion, they saw, would soon destroy the little power that remained to them. It was introduced by foreigners, and was being forced on them by their hered itary enemies of Haapai and Vavau, who made it an ex cuse for plundering their homes, just as they had done in their annual raids before the Christian religion had been 1 This event enables us to fix the king's age with some degree of proba bility.

It was a foreign religion, and it aimed at destroying their influence over their people aud substituting that of a foreigner; therefore they, as Tongans, would resist it to the death. In 1839 it was reported that a plot to assassinate the king had been discovered. The storm-clouds were gathering thick, but still they did not break. In January 1840 King Josiah Tubou paid a friendly visit to Ata in Hihifo, and some of Ata's followers took that opportunity for attacking and killing a party of Christians in their plantations. This outrage being a declaration of war, a strong party was at once despatched from Nukualofa to bring the king to a place of safety. The heathen party invested Fou'i, and Tubou, knowing that the fall of Fou'i would be the signal for an attack upon Nukualofa, sent a fast-sading canoe to Haapai to implore Taufaahau's help. When he arrived it was arranged that he should meet the enemy and submit terms of peace to them. A deserter from the enemy met him on the way to the meeting, and warned him that a plot had been formed to shoot him from an ambush as soon as he reached the appointed place. He at once returned to Nukualofa, and advanced upon Hihifo with all his forces. After investing the place for nearly a fortnight he had re course to a curious stratagem. When civil war breaks out in Tonga, it is the custom for each man to fight on the side of the people with whom he happened to be staying on the outbreak of hostilities. Thus brothers often find them selves ranged against one another. He now ordered such of his men as had relations or friends among the enemy to advance to the ditch and call upon his friend to desert, as suring him of safety. When this was done numbers of the"], [373, "q k q ooo KING GEORGE. besieged jumped over the wall and joined the besiegers, leaving the garrison too weak to resist. Hihifo thus yielded without the loss of a single life, and Taufaahau, true to his promise, spared the lives of the 500 prisoners who fell into his hands. He now consented to take up his permanent quarters in Nukualofa with his army of 900 men and their families. On April 20, 1840, an attack was made upon some strag glers near Nukualofa. The Christians were upon the point of making reprisals when Commodore Wilkes of the United States exploring expedition arrived, and offered his ser vices as mediator between the hostile parties. But his efforts were frustrated by a fresh attack by the heathen, and he left the island without effecting his object. Rightly or wrongly, he formed the opinion that the missionaries by their indiscriminating zeal had brought about the war, and that King George Taufaahau was using the oppor tunity to so increase his prestige as to secure his succession to the office of the reigning king. Although the result of the war was the advancement of the interests both of King George and the missionaries, I see no reason to believe that either were disinclined for peace. The worst that can be said is that it was a missionary war, brought about by zeal untempered with discretion, and that in this respect only can the bloodshed be laid at the missionaries' door. On the 21st May 1810 Captain Croker anchored at Nukualofa in H.M.S. Favourite, and was appealed to by the missionaries to help them out of their difficulties. He landed half his ship's company, and advanced upon the fortress of Bea with three field-pieces. The guns were brought into position within range of the enemy's muskets, z"], [374, "354 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. and Captain Croker entered the fort under a flag of truce. The garrison were willing to listen to his terms, aud he left them with the understanding that they should have half an hour to consult their allies. At the end of the time an English sailor, nicknamed Jimmy the Devil,1 who was armourer to the heathen forces, appeared above the gate and asked for more time \u2014 indeed it afterwards trans pired that they were upon the point of accepting the terms ; but Captain Croker stood watch in hand, and upon the stroke of the half-hour he ran towards the gate crying, \" Now, men, follow me.\" In the first volley from the fort he and several of his men were wounded, and as he leaned for support against a cocoa-nut-tree he was shot through the heart. Two of his officers were killed, and nineteen men wounded : the survivors succeeded with great diffi culty in carrying off the injured, and they at once put to sea, taking with them the missionaries and their families. The field-pieces are still in the hands of the Tongans, and serve to keep green the memory of how they beat a British man-of-war. The whole blame of this extraordinary incident, which has done so much to damage British prestige with the Tongans, must rest upon Captain Croker, who paid for his folly with his life. For becoming the aggressor in a quar- 1 There was more than one \"Jimmy the Devil\" in Tonga. A few months after the attack upon Bea, some of the blue-jackets were discuss ing the affair in a public-house in Sydney. A man sitting near, hearing the word Tonga, joined in the conversation, saying that he had been in the islands. \"They called me 'Jimmy the Devil ' down there,\" he added. The wretched man barely escaped from the blue-jackets with his life. They had mistaken him for the \" Jimmy \" who shot down their com mander."], [375, "KING GEORGE. 355 rel that did not concern him he may be excused \u2014 for, in the excitement of the time, it is more than probable 'that the missionaries greatly exaggerated their own danger, and thus placed him in the position of a protector of British interests ; but for the gross incompetence and indiscretion shown in leading the attack he must bear the sole respon sibility. The heathen party, having beaten off their assailants, began to grow tired of the confinement of life within their intrenchments, and readily accepted peace without the imposition of terms on either side. The new converts, with the doctrine of universal love ringing in their ears, were now to learn something of Christian hate, and, to do them justice, they made very apt pupils. In 1842 some Roman Catholic priests landed and joined the heathen at Bea, among whom they had as much right to be as the Methodist missionaries who had failed to convert them. The mutual recriminations of the rival teachers could not leave their followers unaffected. Religious differences among natives, fostered as they always are by their spiritual guides, invariably lead to political troubles. The heathen chiefs now asserted that they had a right to be independent, and that they would give asylum to any fugitive from the laws promulgated by the king. The priests had set their followers in the road that leads to civil war, and for the misfortunes that overtook them they had only themselves to thank. On November 14, 1845, King Josiah Tubou died. On his deathbed he summoned Tungi, the representative of the Tui Haatakalaua and the principal heathen chief, and charged him to regard George Taufaahau as his succes-"], [376, "356 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. sor. Perhaps his dying wishes would have failed to out weigh the claims of a competitor possessing higher influ ence with the chiefs whose duty it is to elect the member of the reigning family best fitted to succeed, but there was no such competitor. The two chiefs who had the nearest claims were Mumui, and Maafu, King Josiah's son ; but as Tubou-toa's son and Tukuaho's grandson, Taufaahau's rights were unquestioned. George Taufaahau went through the usual native form of disclaiming any desire to succeed ; but resistance to the proffered honour is expected of every candidate. On December 4, 1845, the chiefs from all parts of the king dom assembled in the time-honoured grove at Pangai in Hihifo, under the hoary toa-tvees that had seen the royal cup placed in the hands of Ngata and his successors in lineal descent for two centuries, and whose roots had been watered with the blood of the avengers of the murdered Tukuaho in the great rebellion of 1799. The state kava-ring was formed ; the two hereditary king makers took their seats on either side of the king-elect ; the kava was poured into the cup ; the presiding matabule proclaimed that this was the kava of Taliai-Tubou, Tui Kanokubolu. George Taufaahau, the warrior, the chief of Haapai and Vavau, was no more ; and George Tubou, the champion of the new faith, reigned over all Tonga as his fathers had reigned before him. King George Tubou, as he will now be called, spent the first years of his reign in cementing his authority. Signs were not wanting that the heathen party had not accepted the new order of things. In 1847 he decided to remove his Court from Nukualofa to Haapai, as a warning to such"], [377, "357 KING GEORGE. of the chiefs of Tongatabu who had failed in their re spect towards him. He left Tongatabu under the govern ment of the two Hahavea chiefs, \u2014 Maafu and Lavaka of Bea, \u2014 making them responsible for the maintenance of peace. They, in common with the other chiefs, had taken a pledge not to repair the fortifications of any of the fortresses, and to punish the first chief who should dare to disturb the peace. But as soon as he had left the island they lost no time in repairing the earthworks of Bea. When the news reached the king, he returned to Tonga in a fleet of war-canoes, and summoned the ac cused chiefs to his presence. They strenuously denied the charge of sedition, and renewed their assurances of loyalty. But the king had scarcely returned to Haapai when they began again to annoy their more loyal neighbours, hoping to goad them into open resistance. The chiefs now petitioned the king to return to Nukualofa, and in July 1851 he acceded to their request. The rebel chiefs now showed their intentions more clearly. They refused to meet the king, and declared their intention of separ ating themselves from his Government. They had with them some French priests, who have been accused of encouraging them in their resistance. In February 1852 the works of Bea were hurriedly restored, and a col lision became inevitable. The quarrel was again a ques tion of the new religion. The heathen had for a time been allow*ed to follow their own inclinations ; but in 1850 Tungi, the son of Maealiuaki, the most influential of their party, joined the Christians, and they saw that they must either follow his example and surrender their influence, or take up arms in the defence of their in-"], [378, "358 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. dependence. They were the more ready to adopt the latter alternative since the priests pointed out to them that they would be surrendering not to King George \u2014 that they had already done\u2014 but to the English mission aries, who bad become his Ministers of State as well as of the Gospel. Before finally taking the field, the king made an effort to induce the priests to leave the rebels \u2014 for his foresight told him that any injury they might sustain would afford a pretext for the demands of a foreign Power for in demnity. They refused, however, to leave the fort, pro bably feeling that the desertion of their friends on the approach of danger would destroy their prestige beyond repair. The courage they showed in braving the dangers of a siege by a stronger party, with the prospect of the horrors of savage victory at the close, compares favour ably with the conduct of their rivals who fled the island in 1840, and deserves something better than the sneers that have been heaped upon them by the Wesleyan missionaries. On March 1st the king distributed muskets among his chiefs, and formally declared war. After two slight skir mishes, a pitched battle was fought near Bea, with con siderable loss on both sides, but without decisive result. On the 14th the Roman Catholic Bishop of Samoa arrived in a French ship-of-war to inquire into the cause of the war, and left again with the avowed intention of bringing help for the beleaguered priests from Tahiti. On the 12th of April the king closely invested Bea, by throwing up four earthworks at different points of the fortification, garrisoning them with a total force of 10,000 men. He"], [379, "KING GEORGE. 359 might probably have taken the place by assault, but for some reason he hesitated from day to clay in the hope that the enemy would themselves sue for peace. Houma meanwhile had resisted all Ata's efforts to carry it by storm, and the king's troops were driven to try the expedient of starving the garrison into submission. Early in July the Houma people sued for peace, and received the king's pardon, sitting before him with m-leaves, em blematic of submission, hanging from their necks. Five weeks later a large ship was reported off the anchorage, and the king, supposing it to be the help promised to the enemy from Tahiti, prepared to assault Bea before the French should have time to interfere. But she proved to be H.M.S. Calliope, commanded by Sir Everard Home, who offered his services to the king as mediator with his enemies. Terms were again sent to the enemy by four chiefs of high rank, \u2014 that the lives of the entire garrison should be spared, on the condition that the fort should be given over to pillage and destruction. But the enemy distrusted the faith of the king's troops, and asked for one of the missionaries and the king's son as hostages for their safety. To this the king would not consent, and the negotiations threatened to break clown when news reached Nukualofa that the principal chiefs had left the fortress, and that the royal forces were sacking the place. The king, accompanied by Sir Everard Home, set off for Bea in hot haste, and traversed the four intervening miles almost at a run. They arrived just in time to prevent the victors, drunken with the excitement of rapine, from proceeding to outrage. The town was in flames, and the priests were threatened with rough treatment. By the"], [380, "360 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. king's efforts they were removed to a place of safety, and their property was dragged out of their burning houses. Lavaka, Maafu, and Tubouleva were pardoned, and they forthwith renounced both heathenism and the Christianity of the Roman Church, which the Protestant chronicler naively classes together. Thus ended the second Wes leyan crusade, and Protestantism, sustained by the musket and the club, was again triumphant. In the following November the long-expected help from Tahiti arrived in the person of Captain Belland of the Imperial frigate Moselle. A formal inquiry was held to investigate the charges brought by the priests and the captain of a French whaler ; and the French commander, while acquitting the king of responsibility for any injury sustained by the priests, warned him against allowing his zeal to blind him to the right of his subjects to entire freedom of conscience. In closing the inquiry he said to the interpreter, \" Tell him that I have known many chiefs in the South Seas, but I have never met his equal.\" Relieved of his anxieties at home, King George had now the leisure to consider his long-cherished scheme of travelling abroad. More than once in his youth he had almost yielded to a temptation to ship before the mast in one of the passing whalers that made Tonga their annual port of call. Had he done so, the history of his country would have been different, but he was reserved for higher things. His mind naturally turned to Fiji, where a new kingdom had been unexpectedly won for him. The num ber of Tongans settled in Fiji had grown into a standing menace to the peace of Tonga. Any disaffected chief might recruit an army of free-lances there, well trained in"], [381, "361 KING GEORGE. arms, and return to Tonga as an invader. The only safe guard against this was to set a chief over them who would find an outlet for their restless energy in Fiji itself. Fiji would be, moreover, a vent for the disaffection of a num ber of his own subjects, who would be glad enough to become exiles with the brilliant prospect of conquest and booty before them. The man lay ready to hand. Maafu, the son of his predecessor, had all the qualities for a leader of such an expedition. He had, besides, a strong claim to the succession, and would be made the figurehead of any rebellion that might be launched against the throne by the heathen party. An expedition was soon fitted out, and early in 1848 Maafu, at the head of a strong and numerous following, set sail for Lakemba. During the next five years he fought his way into the supremacy of the whole of the Lau group, wresting the power from the hands of Tui Nayau, and vesting the lands in his principal followers. Maafu, accustomed to the Tongan system of land tenure, did for Fiji what the British Government has never had the courage to do. He cut the Gordian knot of boundary disputes by dividing out the communal lands into small individual holdings, and securing them to the grantees with a strong hand. He did not, more over, allow his Fijian subjects to alienate an inch of land to Europeans except on lease. He was a student of history. Asked by what right he divided the lands of the Fijians, he replied sardonically, \" I am King William \u2014 William the Conqueror ! \" Having established settled government upon the Tongan model, he turned his eyes westward, and threatened the powerful chieftain cies of Bau, Thakaundrove, and Mathuata. The cession"], [382, "362 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. of Fiji to England reduced him from the position of an independent viceroy to that of a pensioner of the British Government. Deprived of all stimulus to activity, he became demoralised, took to drink, and died in 1880. Affairs stood thus when, in 1853, King George em barked for Sydney in the mission brig John Wesley. The ship dropped anchor at Bau, and King George met Thakombau and formed the alliance that ultimately brought about the annexation of the group by England. The Fijian chief promised him the canoe Ea Marama, the largest craft afloat, if the king would visit him to bring her away. His power was already waning, and he hoped that his alliance with the Tongan king, whose name was become a terror throughout the group, would cow his enemy Eatu Mara. Sydney made a deep impression upon George's mind. His questions were unending. Nothing escaped him, from the form of legislature to the uniforms of the police men. One fact, indeed, he lost no time in applying to his own country, and to it is due the present independence of the kingdom of foreign interference. European settlers had already been pressing him to sell land to them, and he had resisted hitherto, feeling that it would give them a status in the country that would sooner or later affect his own independence. He now found that in Sydney land could be granted to a stranger without passing out of the hand of its real owner. He resolved that not a rood of Tongan land should be alienated except upon lease, and he kept his resolution. On his return to Tonga he wrote to Thakombau the letter 'that induced him to accept the missionaries' teach-"], [383, "KING GEORGE. 363 ings which he had so long rejected, and he then made his preparations for the visit he had promised. His fleet consisted of thirty sail of double canoes, manned by many hundreds of warriors. He had no intention of joining in any of the local wars, but he knew the necessity of being independent of the protection of his host, whose power, he knew, was not undisputed. From Moturiki he de spatched a canoe to Ovalau, commanded by Tavake, one of his own relations. Before the canoe could reach the shore it was fired upon by the natives, who were at the time in alliance with Ratu Mara, Thakombau's revolted brother. Tavake was killed, and the canoe hastened back to the king with the news. The murderer could not be captured without a general attack upon Ovalau and a war with the whites, who sided with Mara, and would not surrender the murderer to any ally of Thakombau. King George therefore resolved to join Thakombau in an attack upon the fortress of Kamba on the mainland, where the enemy were massed in force. Thakombau's fortunes were now at the lowest ebb. If he failed in reducing Kamba, his fate was sealed. His enemies had hemmed him in; his vassals had revolted; even his own town, filled with his own relations, was against him, and in open communication with the enemy. His conversion to Christianity had alienated many of those who still clung to him, and his only hope lay in his Tongan allies. On the 7th of April 1853 the allied armies landed on the peninsula. A party of Tongans was despatched to reconnoitre the fort, and they had scarcely left the main body when news came that they were engaged with the enemy. The rest of the Tongans advanced to the attack,"], [384, "364 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. dashed against the stockade, and after a few minutes' hand-to-hand fighting the enemy were in full flight, and Kamba, invincible to Fijian methods of warfare, was in flames. None of their Fijian allies appeared until the looting had begun. With the fall of Kamba the heart of Mara's rebellion was crushed, and Thakombau recovered his prestige. Had King George failed him, Bau would have fallen, and the cession of the country to England, which Thakombau brought about, might never have taken place. Before leaving the group, King George made a tour through some of the heathen islands to urge upon the chiefs the adoption of Christianity. Traces of this ex pedition may still be seen in the wavy seal-like hair of some of the natives of Kandavu and Vatulele, who were born shortly after the departure of the Tongans. . After settling the policy to be adopted by Maafu in Lau, the king set sail for Tonga. He found the Governor of Tahiti, M. du Bouzet, awaiting his return with a treaty ready for his signature, which was so worded as to give the French priests the fullest liberty of action. It was then the policy of the Empire, as it is now of the Ee public, to lend the Church the powers of the State abroad while ignoring her claims at home. To this point, in spite of the bloodshed the introduction of Christianity had cost, the missionaries' influence had been for good ; but from the king's return from Fiji they felt their position to be secure, and they began to abuse their power by meddling in the affairs of the State. They were burning with a desire for radical reform : they panted to see their flock enjoying the sweets of constitutional government. Mr St Julian, the King of Hawaii's Mayor"], [385, "KING GEORGE. 365 of the Palace, having persuaded his own patron to bow down before the freedom-god, wrote a flattering letter to the Tongan missionaries to enlist them in the same holy cause. The king, to his credit be it said, long resisted, ob jecting that his people were not ready for such reforms ; that, though in Sydney it might be well to curtail the power of the chiefs, the Tongans would use their new liberty for the indulgence of their natural idleness. But in 1862 he was over persuaded, and a Constitution was granted which swept away the form of government which had taken centuries to elaborate, and substituted exec utive machinery on the English plan. A system evolved from centuries of experiment to suit the needs of Anglo- Saxons was forced in a single day upon a handful of ignor ant Orientals, with whose inborn convictions it was in com plete antagonism. The Konisitutone became thenceforth the fetish of the Tongan people. Most of them did not know what it was, but it had been introduced by the missionaries, and was intimately connected, they believed, with its outlandish fellow Konisienisi (Conscience), and in some mysterious way it elevated their country to the level of one of the Great Powers. It was not until after the feasting and the speech-making and the ecstatic ser mons of the black-coated missionaries that the chiefs had time to realise that they had sold their birthright for a sheet of vellum, and that their power was gone. It was a heavy price to pay for being sivilaisi. The power of the missionaries was now at its height. The king had no other advisers, and it was natural that he should rely upon them. The early indifference to their teachings had given place to an almost hysterical en-"], [386, "366 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. thusiasm. They had scarcely to ask for contributions \u2014 the emulation among their congregations filled the mission oil-tanks \u2014 and they, too, began to be astonished at their own moderation. As the king's advisers they now began to dabble in politics. They designed a Royal Standard with doves and crossed swords, and other un-Polynesian devices ; they ordered a Crown and a Great Seal ; they taught the officers of State to pace the beach in Eng lish military uniforms ; they encouraged the women to disfigure themselves with bonnets and European dress. They had laboured hard, and if they now complacently accepted the blind adoration of their flock, it was but human nature. But there was one among the new converts who was less blind than his teachers. One of the missionaries was leaving the group, and the villages for miles round as sembled to take leave of him. A vast pile of mats, cloth, and other native property was heaped up before the smil ing clergyman : the excitement was hysterical. Tungi, the latest convert, was curiously watching the scene with a companion by his side. \" Uiliame,\" he said, \" do you re member how they treated Mr when he came, how they stole his things and insulted him, and do you see them now ? They are dying of love for him, Uiliame ; yet I think that you and I will live to see the time when their love will be turned into hate. This will not last for long, Uiliame ; their minds are too hot.\" Uiliame re membered these words twenty years later, when he saw an angry crowd assembled outside the mission - house demanding the bodies of the native Wesleyans who had taken refuge there, and he told the story as a proof of"], [387, "367 KING GEORGE. Tungi's wisdom. But the missionaries had no misgiv ings. They had learned the fickleness of their people by bitter experience, but in the days of their apotheosis they forgot the law of reaction. The first cloud was no bigger than a man's hand. For some years the contributions exceeded the needs of the Church in Tonga, and the people asked that the surplus might be spent among them, instead of being swallowed up by impecunious missions in other lands. The hesita tion of the Wesleyan Conference in Australia in granting this very reasonable request gave birth to a desire for ecclesiastical self-government. The ignorant but self effacing missionaries of the early days had made way for a very different stamp of man, not less ignorant, perhaps, but far better versed in the affairs of the world. The modern missionary was not called to the post owing to any inward conviction : he took up the work as he would any other profession, and he aimed at the aggran disement of the Church of which he was a member, rather than the ultimate good of the people committed to his care. He saw that the moving spirit of the Tongan mind was display and emulation, and he skilfully adapted it to the needs of the collection-plate. The chairman was now Mr Baker, a plausible and not over-scrupulous man, half educated, but possessed of considerable knowledge of the world. Little by little he brought the king to look to him for advice in secular matters. The secret of his influence was the king's fear of losing his independence. Mr Baker worked upon this fear, representing England as only waiting for an opportunity to seize the country as she had done in Fiji. It was only by following his advice"], [388, "368 A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF TONGA. that these nefarious designs could be frustrated. He now began to play into the hands of Germany, thinking that he would flatter the king by negotiating a treaty with one of the Great Powers. He approached the German Consul- General in Samoa, and found him ready to treat with him for a fair price \u2014 namely, the cession of a coaling-station in the unequalled harbour of Vavau. On the 1st of Novem ber 1876 the native plenipotentiaries, with their reverend interpreter, proceeded to a German ship-of-war to sign the treaty that had been prepared for them. It was read, and when the passage about the coaling-station was reached Tungi objected that he would like to consult the king before signing such a clause, but the German commander sternly told him that it was all settled, and that it was too late to withdraw. So the treaty was signed, and the coaling-station ceded \" without prejudice to the rights of sovereignty of the King of Tonga,\" and the \" interpreter \" received a decoration from the Emperor of Germany for the trouble he had taken in the matter. I have now brought this sketch to the point of the establishment of the Free Church, whence I have traced it in the opening chapters of this volume. For those who have heard of King George only as a persecutor, or as a sovereign ruled by his own Minister, owe it to themselves and to his memory to give at least an equal prominence in their minds to the story of his early career."], [389, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL 2 A"], [390, ""], [391, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL It was the census year, and the law provided that the Alinister of Police should be responsible for numbering the people. His arrangements were somewhat primitive, but I daresay that they produced more satisfactory results than would the more elaborate machinery of our Begistrar- General if put into the hands of such workmen. Kubu simply ordered his policemen to visit every village and write down the names of the inhabitants. In a country where every individual is personally known if not related to the enumerator, not many omissions are likely to have been made. The total census of the natives was 19,196. The registers of the births and deaths for the previous ten years showed the population to be steadily decreasing, not so much on account of excessive mortality as of a low birth-rate. The death-rate (36 per mille), however, was high when compared with European countries ; and it would be strange if it were not so, when it is remembered that the arrival of Europeans has introduced the germs of many diseases from which the natives were formerly free, and to which they are therefore not yet inured. Chiefly de-"], [392, "372 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. structive among these are dysentery and whooping-cough, both of them unknown to the Tongans before the advent of European ships. But apart from bacilli of actual foreign diseases, there is now no doubt that the different races of men are themselves uncongenial, and that their first meeting generates a mysterious poison fatal to the weaker race. In the Pacific, Tahiti, Niue (Savage Island), and Penrhyn Island in particular were swept by a destructive epidemic immediately after the visit of the first European ship, though the visitors were not themselves suffering from any such ailment at the time. Such disasters have led the natives of some of the islands to adopt a murderous system of quarantine, and the loss of many lives has been the result. Tonga, however, seems to have been spared this penalty that attaches to the \" blessings of civilisa tion,\" unless the tradition of an epidemic following Tas man's visit has been lost. The first sickness preserved by tradition is the ngangau (lit. headache), a new disease that ravaged the group about the year 1776, but which was not associated in the natives' minds with the visit of Captain Cook three years before. Of this many hundreds are said to have perished. I do not believe that the population of Tonga ever greatly exceeded 20,000. It is true that the natives have traditions of a time when the king's orders could be shouted from house to house as the people lay on their mats ; but I think that this refers to the time when each family lived in its own plantation instead of in villages, \u2014 a state of things that was observed by Tasman in 1643. Cook estimated the people present at the entertainment given to him at Maofanga in June 1777 at 10,000, the"], [393, "o 17 \u2022> 6 I O THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. present population of Tongatabu. Since that time the population has been either stationary or decreasing \u2014 slightly under normal circumstances, rapidly in time of epidemic. In 1893 the measles and the diseases con sequent upon it carried off one-twentieth of the people. In the absence of such severe visitations whooping-cough is the most destructive of the introduced diseases. The mothers lack the knowledge and the self-devotion re quired to successfully nurse their children through such ill nesses, and content themselves with calling in one native quack after another to dose the unfortunate child with a succession of nostrums until death puts an end to its sufferings. For the low birth-rate there are several reasons. In ancient times the women were required to do no work beyond the light occupations of fishing and cloth-beating. The men planted the food, carried in the wood and water, and did the cooking. The missionaries have so industriously cultivated the idea of family life that in most Tongan households the women, after marriage, do the same work as the wives of the peasantry in Europe. In other respects they have greater liberty than under the heathen system. Formerly a girl's hair was cropped short at about twenty, and she was thenceforward classed as an old woman (fefinc motua). No woman of mature age could then masquerade in the guise of a young girl, and there was no inducement to defer marriage and the cares of maternity ; for the woman who aspired to be younger than her years had no peace from the sneers of her con temporaries. This is all changed. Under the grim social code of the missionaries, by a mockery of fate, a laxer"], [394, "374 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. moral tone allows a girl to prolong her independence to the limit set by time to her attractions, and she finds life so amusing that she defers marriage until the last possible bridegroom has left her for a younger generation. Even after marriage she is at a disadvantage as compared with her grandmother, who could count in childbed upon the help of her female relatives, according to certain fixed rules, instead of having, as now, to receive help as a favour only. These reasons and the increased skill of the women in forbidden forms of surgery tend to a decrease in the birth-rate. To those who would know more of this sub ject, I commend the Report of the Commission appointed to inquire into the decrease of the native race in Fiji, 1893. The report, besides being interesting, is of high anthropological value. Though the Tongans are vastly particular about out ward modesty, they cannot truthfully be described as an over-sensitive people. We halted one day for lunch in a small village at the back of Tongatabu. The house was filled with the notables of the place, and the children stared at us six deep through the crevices in the reed walls. There was a sudden cry of fade ! and in a few seconds we were left alone in the house. The children dashed off at the first cry, and after a decent interval our hosts made excuses one after another to leave the house. From the doorway I saw the whole population of the village thronging into a hut on the opposite side of the square. It was a birth. A Tongan mother is delivered in a reclining posture, supported in the arms of her husband. There is no privacy,\u2014 the whole village is present. There is always a"], [395, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 375 \" wise woman \" officiating, generally one of the hereditary sisterhood, but sometimes an old woman who had adopted the profession from choice, and is consequently looked down upon as an interloper and a quack. The fees, given in kind, are high when the poverty of the donors is con sidered \u2014 ngatu and mats to the value of 30s. or more. The \" wise woman \" receives the child on a tiny mat specially plaited for the occasion. If it is a boy, the umbilicus is severed on a digging-stick to make him a good cultivator ; if a girl, on a ngatu - mallet to make her a good beater of cloth. The child is then washed and rubbed over with oil and turmeric, a small quantity of candle-nut and cocoa-nut juice is forced into its mouth to make it vomit, and for the first two days it is fed by hand upon cocoa-nut-milk, or suckled by another woman, because at that early stage the mother's milk is believed to be insufficient and unwholesome. During the first month the child's grandmothers, or its unmarried aunts, are told off to supply the mother with food and look after the house, and the mother is spared all exertion. It would be better for her and the child if at this stage she were also deprived of kava and tobacco. Before the missionaries had inculcated family life on the European plan, the native social system recognised a physical peculiarity in Tongan women, and insisted upon the seclusion of the mother during the whole period of lacta tion in order to avoid a second gestation within too short a period of the birth, and consequently the premature weaning of the first child. As in Japan, the time of suckling was prolonged until all the teeth had come ; for the Tongans have no good substitute for the mother's"], [396, "376 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. milk, and could only give the children taro, yam, or fish as the first food after weaning. The change in this system of family separation is the cause most commonly quoted by the natives for the high mortality among children. I have said that the Tongans are sticklers for propriety in appearances. In some respects, however, they share with the other Polynesian peoples a gross lack of delicacy. Ancient custom still constrains the elderly female relations of the bridegroom to go home with the married pair and stay with them until they are in a position to prove to the other relations that the marriage is satisfactory, and that the dower is therefore due. All the weaknesses of pride of race that we laugh at in ourselves, and feel none the less keenly, may be studied among these other islanders of the antipodes. There is a Tongan colony in Fiji, the children of the army of occu pation taken over by Maafu in 1848. The real Tongans patronise their colonials, and speak of them behind their backs as barbarians, ignorant of the usages of polite society. The colonists affect to ridicule the Tongan aristocracy as effete and effeminate, and envy them in secret, bestowing on them the involuntary flattery of imitation. A Tongan colonist who has been to Nukualofa and conversed with the great of the earth returns home to be a nuisance to his fellows, who try to disguise their feeling of inferiority by disparagement of the intercourse which they so much envy. Thus, as between the English and the Australians, a gulf is gradually being fixed between the Tongans of Tonga and Fiji. Not less instructive is the feeling between the Tongans and the Fijians. While affecting to despise the Fijians for their want of refinement, the"], [397, "377 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. Tongan chief, stripped of his wealth and influence by his new-fangled communism, secretly envies the authority which his Fijian neighbour has been too wise to sur render : the Fijian chief, though full of contempt for the leaning towards foreign customs that has reduced the Tongan chief to poverty, tries hard to imitate his air of superior refinement. The Tongan chief likes nothing better than to be entertained by a great chief in Fiji, and feel again vicariously the glories of his lost estate, and eat taro, and hear the murmur of running water, both luxuries unknown in his own dry country. The Fijian loves to have such guests, and show them off to his neighbours as proof of the wide range of his influence. So each reflects glory on the other. They are ridiculously shy of one another. While Tukuaho was paying a visit to me in Auckland, Eatu Lala, the Tui Thakau, came from Fiji to make a tour through the Australian colonies. The two chiefs, on the ground of their relationship through a common ancestress, were very anxious to meet, and they both besought me to bring about the introduction. Tukuaho spoke excellent Fijian, and Eatu Lala is no less fluent in Tongan, but to my astonishment I found that I was expected to act as interpreter between them. Their conversation was complimentary and formal. Tukuaho reminded his Fijian relative of the romantic legend that connected their families. Eatu Lala pressed him to make the bond closer by paying him a visit. They were both so painfully shy that even this stilted conversation would have been impossible unless I had stayed to interpret their languages to each other. I have spoken already of the music and poetry of the"], [398, "378 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. present day. As in most primitive countries, both words aud music are the work of the same hand. The modern music has adopted the harmonies and cadence of the European compositions which the composers have heard, but it retains a distinctly native character, widely differ ent though it is from the form of the ancient melodies. The songs are all sung in four-part chorus without accom paniment. The poetry is uninteresting in that it gen erally treats of scenery and flowers, seldom of the drama of life, never of the drama of love. Of traditionary poetry little remains. The admirable efforts of the Rev. J. E. Moulton came too late to rescue the stores of legendary lore that passed away with the advent of Christianity, but the purely historical traditions that have been rescued, and which form the basis for the early history of the people, may be relied upon as having been correctly handed down. I had a curious instance of the durability of tradition. While conducting the native newspaper in Fiji, I took some trouble to collect and preserve the fragments of historical poetry that were still remembered, and invited contributions from the whole native community. At the same time I sent to press some fragments that were published in a missionary book about 1860. Among the contributions received in response to my appeal was a poem of the murder of Koroitamana {circa 1825). It had been gathered from the mouth of a very old woman of Bau. My native sub editor recognised it as being the same as one of the frag ments from the missionary book, and brought me the printer's proof. Here, then, was an opportunity of com paring versions of the same poem taken thirty-three years"], [399, "379 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. apart. The poem contained five or six stanzas of ten lines, and in all these there were but two differences of one word each. The ancient monuments of Tonga have an interest of their own, since they are the rare efforts of a people who build their bouses and temples of materials no more en during than grass. The tombs of the Tui Tonga, described by so many travellers, are in the ordinary form of the Polynesian malae, a quadrilateral mound faced by huge blocks of stone, rising sometimes in terraces to a height of 20 feet. From the account left to us by the first mission aries of the funeral of Mumui in the year 1797, we know that each of these mounds contains in its exact centre the body of a dead king. The tombs are now so overgrown with forests that it is almost impossible to photograph them. Banyan -trees have sprouted on the terraces, and have bored their roots into every crevice, covering the stones with a lacework of tendrils which, year by year, force great blocks asunder, till the form of the terraces is almost obliterated. I tried to persuade a leading man of Mua to clear away the forest and preserve the tombs ; but I found that even in these days the tradition of the tahu is strong enough to make this a sacrilege. The rule was, that after a body was laid to rest, Nature should be allowed to shroud it from the vulgar gaze, and that no foot should trample the hallowed ground until the death of a successor. When this happened, the people reverently cleared the whole ground, and built a new tomb, and practised the extraordinary funeral rites that have been so minutely de scribed by Mariner. But now that the office of Tui Tonga has been abolished, the tombs will never again be cleared"], [400, "380 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. until their site has been forgotten by posterity, or they have themselves crumbled away into a shapeless mound. Besides these tombs, there is an older monument con cerning which no tradition has been preserved. It stands upon land which is the peculiar property of the Tui Tonga, at a spot perhaps two furlongs from the beach. It consists of two upright monoliths of hardened coral, neatly squared, and across them rests a similar stone mortised into their summits. Each of these stones must weigh at least fifty tons. I climbed them and found upon the top of the cross stone a cup-like depression, very carefully cut. The only tradition preserved, is that the stones are the property of the Tui Tonga, and are called Haamonga, but their meaning is now forgotten. I carefully examined the surrounding ground for a sign of excavation, but there was none ; yet I believe that one may argue from analogy that these stones were set on end by inclined planes of earth as heavy house - posts are sometimes raised to this clay. Probably Stonehenge and all the similar monoliths of primitive peoples were raised in the same way. It once fell to my lot to build a native house which was to gratify the natural vanity of the mountaineers in Fiji by surpassing all other houses in size and magnificence. The main pjosts were enormous logs of vesi, a timber heavier than oak, and each of them must have weighed more than ten tons. I had the holes dug to receive them, and lined them with two feet of stones to prevent the trees from driving farther into the earth than the measured depth. Then I borrowed some strong tackle blocks and ropes, and summoned all the able-bodied men of the district to help in lifting them. I carefully explained"], [401, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 381 the use of the tackle, and tried to get them into their places ; but a council of elders sat on the case, and flatly declined to use it. There was only one way, they said, of raising heavy weights, and that was the way of their fathers. What could one lone white man do against an army of pig-headed ancestor worshippers ? I gave in and watched them. They spent the first day in getting stout logs with forked tops. With these they built a solid platform sloping upwards to a height of 15 feet above the holes. Then they fastened strong vines to the end of the logs, and rolled them to the base of the inclined plane. Butt-end first, they dragged them inch by inch along the platform \u2014 100 men on either vine \u2014 until the logs lay at length horizontal, with their bodies projecting over the platform, above the hole. Then the council of elders sat on them, literally and metaphorically, and had them shifted an inch or two to the side. When they were satis fied, two men with axes hacked at the logs that formed the end of the platform. One by one these snapped, until, as the supports were cut away, the great butt-end overbalanced, and the huge log began to tip up. Its head rose to au angle of 45\u00b0, and then with a crash and a deep thud it shot down into the hole, and then men swarmed up and fastened vines to its summit by which it was easily hauled into position. 1 must say, in paren thesis, that I was unlucky enough to intervene at this juncture with my block-and-tackle. I made it fast to a cross-beam lashed to two trees, but no sooner had my twenty men begun to strain upon the rope than the beam snapped like a watch-spring, and swept the council of elders into the hole ; so that, until this accident is for-"], [402, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 382 gotten, the primitive method of raising weights is likely to prevail in that district. I asked the old men what they did with heavier weights still, and they immediately answered, \"We make the platform of earth, and dig it away to make the log tip up.\" No doubt, when the log or stone is on end, they dig away the platform, throwing the earth into its old position, so that no trace remains. Having seen the whole process, I shall continue to believe that Stonehenge was built like this, until some one offers a better explanation. There is a legend that the Haamonga stones were brought by the god Maui in a gigantic canoe from Uea (Wallace Island), and that you may see there great holes in the rock whence they were quarried. A European even assured me that the stone is of a kind not found in Tonga at all. This part of the story at least is not true, for the stone is mere coral, hardened by exposure, of exactly the same quality as the reef close by. In discussing the peculiarities of man I have altogether neglected the lower animals in Tonga. The only indig enous mammals were a small field-rat, a fruit-eating bat or flying fox, and a small cave-bat. The rat, having no enemies but man, swarmed throughout the islands : so numerous were they that it was a chieflike sport to shoot them in the paths with a bow and arrow. They have almost vanished now before the cats, dogs, and their voracious Norway cousin, and rat - shooting is now as extinct as bear-baiting in England. The first foreign arrival was of course the pig. It is a popular fallacy that Captain Cook, among his other benefi-"], [403, "383 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. cent actions, introduced the pig into the islands of the Pacific. It would be questionable whether, if he had clone so, he would have deserved the gratitude of posterity ; for the pig, in his role of universal scavenger, adds to the insanitary state of the village when alive, and when dead disagrees with his owners. For he was never an article of common diet, being killed only on occasions of cere mony, and then eaten to excess. So far from taking pigs to Tonga, Cook called there to obtain them in order to preserve his crew from the scourge that wrecked so many other expeditions, the scurvy. One hundred and thirty years before Cook's visit Tasman exchanged iron for pigs at Hihifo. But pigs had not then reached all the islands. Penrhyn was without them ; and tradition tells of a time when even Fiji, so rich in all else, knew not the taste of pork. The story comes from Samoa, and its very inco herence seems to stamp it as having a core of true metal within its thick coating of alloy : \u2014 \" Many generations ago, when the world was still young, the crops in Upolu failed, and there was a great famine. And a man, who had a daughter married to the chief of Tutuila, called his son to him and said, ' The people are dying of hunger, and beside these two pigs we have naught to eat. If we kill these the neighbours will come in and take the meat from us, and afterwards we shall all perish together. But I have heard that in thy sister's land, in Tutuila, there is yet plenty. Now go to her and ask her for shelter for me and thy mother and thy brothers who made her marriage-feast for her, for we would live with her until there be again plenty in Upolu.'"], [404, "384 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. \" So the young man launched his canoe and sailed for his sister's village. It chanced that on that clay the men of the village had taken a great haul of fish from the reef, and were laying it upon the beach to be shared out among the households. And as the canoe drew near, and the girl recognised her brother, she cried to the men to hide the fish in the house, ' lest these hungry ones take all ! ' And when her brother landed she said, ' Alas ! that you seek relief from a fasting land. The famine with us is more grievous than with you.' \" Now the youth had seen the men hiding the fish as his canoe approached the shore, and he returned and told all to his father. There was bitter grief that day in their house when they knew that the daughter had treated them as strangers, and the old man would not be com forted, but said, ' If we are strangers, let us be strangers indeed.' So he made ready his canoe, and they prepared to leave their land for ever. They took with them the people of their house and their two hogs and food for four days, and sailed towards the west, caring not whether they reached a land or no. On the fourth day they reached Fiji, and beached their canoe on an uninhabited part of the shore. They let their hogs go in the bush and came to the village of the chief, who entertained them for many days. This people had no hogs, but when they made their feasts human flesh was the thai (relish) of the yams. When they had dwelt there many months misfortune began to follow the chief's warriors. Many were slain and eaten of the enemy, and the chief had not tasted the flesh of men. Then the priests, speaking the voice of the gods, said that the strangers were bringing disaster upon"], [405, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 385 the warriors, and that only if they were killed and eaten would the doom of the tribe be averted. When the young Samoan heard this he took counsel with his father, and went to the chief and said, ' If I find thee a sweeter dainty than the flesh of men, will you spare our lives ? ' And the chief said Yes, for he thought that he knew all the foods that were in his island. So the youth went into the bush that now swarmed with hogs, the offspring of those he had set free there, and took a young hog and baked it secretly and presented it to the chief with due ceremony. And when the chief tasted it he was transported with delight, and swore that no more men should be eaten in his island as long as there were hogs to eat ; and he felt a great gratitude towards the Samoan strangers, and would refuse them nothing. And they, being now weary of life in this barbarous country, asked a boon of him that he would give them a canoe, and let them depart to their own land. And when this was granted they asked that they might load her with all things necessary for a long voyage ; and the chief granted them all kinds of provisions except hogs, for he would not allow any of this precious food to be removed from the country. But when they still entreated, he granted that they might take with them one cooked hog, but no live ones, lest they should give the animals to any of his enemies. So they killed a very large hog, and disembowelled it, and caught a sow big with young, and sewed up the living sow in the belly of the dead hog, and so carried them both to the canoe ; for they rightly judged that in the famine the people of their land of Upolu had destroyed all the hogs. So they sailed, and reached their land in safety with the sow still living ; 2 B"], [406, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 386 and there was great rejoicing, for there were no hogs in the island. And from this sow was the whole island replenished.\" Some writers have remarked upon the Polynesian word for pig\u2014 puaka or vuaka \u2014 as being a proof that the pigs were first introduced by the Portuguese. There are, how ever, other words of Melanesian origin for the animal in Fiji\u2014 nngo and vore \u2014 that show the animal to have been known in the Pacific by others than the Malayo-Poly nesians. It is most probable that the name is a mere coincidence, and that the people brought their pigs to the Pacific with them. The name may even be onomatop\u0153ic. The pig of the Pacific is long-snouted, humpbacked, lean, and out-at-elbows. He seems to have forgotten such of the decencies as may be traditionary among his civilised cousins, and will eat putrid flesh and other things that are unmentionable. He is, besides, stricken with a deep melancholy, from which neither the sunshine nor the cloud of flies in which he passes his existence can rouse him. Domestic poultry must also have come to the Pacific with the ancestors of the present Polynesians. The Tongan name moa and the Fijian too, are of course onoma top\u0153ic. The Maories, already possessing the word to denote domestic fowls, applied it to the great wingless birds they saw on their arrival in New Zealand ; for the moa in their eyes was simply a hen on a gigantic scale. The cat was probably the next arrival, and its native name is proof-positive that it was introduced by a person who called it \" pussy,\" therefore an Englishman. In an"], [407, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 387 ancient poem celebrating one of the earliest visits of a European ship, an unsuspecting cat has been handed clown to posterity as sitting on the fo'csle : \u2014 \" Pusi ka tiko e mua ni wanga.\" To the native poet it was the most remarkable feature of the ship. In Tonga it is pusi, in Fiji vusi, and, by meta thesis, kusi. If the Polynesians had brought their cats with them, we should no doubt find that, like the ancient Egyptians, they called it miau. As for \" puss,\" has not a living writer remarked that the god Pasht had a cat's head ? Then came the dogs. The name kuli has given rise to a popular delusion that the first dog was a colley, but this satisfying theory will not withstand the fact that the accent of the native name falls on the ultimate, and that dogs were called kuli as early as 1777, before sheep-dogs were generally known as colleys, the dogs in the Pacific at that date being not colleys at all. The more ancient Fijian name for dog is tui, but the word kuli is in use in all parts of that group that have been affected by Tongan immigration. Captain Cook found no dogs in Tonga in 1773, but on his return four years later he noticed numbers of dogs, \" commonly of a sallow colour, small and pretty, nearly resembling the Pomeranian dog,\" which the natives declared they had lately obtained from Fiji. Whence the Fijians acquired them will now never be known ; but, since the dingos or native dogs of Aus tralia and New Guinea are very unlike the animals described by Cook, it seems probable that they are late introductions, landed from some vessel the tradition of"], [408, "388 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. whose visit has now been forgotten. Vessels from Manilla and the East Indies probably visited Vanualevu for sandal wood at intervals throughout the eighteenth century, recording their visit in their log-book, but not thinking it worth while to report their discoveries on their return to port. In one of these the first dogs may have been landed. It is perhaps safe to assume that animals whose names are onomatop\u0153ic are indigenous, and that those that are called by a corruption of a foreign name are recent intro ductions. A curious instance of the latter kind of nomen clature is to be found in Rotuna and the Gilbert Islands, where a dog is called a kamia, the elegant native conver sion of the homely \" Come 'ere \" with which the first dog was addressed by his illiterate master. The natives fled in terror from the new monster, and the sailor called it off, little thinking that he was adding a new word to the language of the island. Little less curious is the origin of the Fijian name for cattle. The first cattle brought to Tonga were presented by Cook to Finau at Haapai. The two animals were pointed out to him as a bull and a cow (bulu mo kau). When they were afterwards shown to the Fijians, whose conjunction is not mo, the names were taken to be one word ; and thenceforward all cattle, irrespective of sex, were called bulumokau, the sex being distinguished by suffixing the words for male or female. The ridiculous word is applied even to beef, and by the Melanesian servants domiciled in Fiji to mutton, when qualified by the word si-pi (sheep). The Tongans have now forgotten the kau, and speak only of the bulu, adding the words tagata or fefinc to denote the sex. Thus with them a cow"], [409, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 389 is a female bull (koe bulu fcfine). D'Entrecasteaux, who visited Tonga fourteen years after Cook, found that the existence of the cattle left by that navigator was so far forgotten that the natives did not know which island they were on, if indeed they were alive at all. They were then spoken of as puaka tide (Cook's pigs). Cook himself records the fact that the new animals excited but little interest. This indifference still survives in the unwilling ness of the people to keep cattle, in spite of the excellent pasture in the island and the large profits to be made from the sale of milk. Almost every Tongan owns a horse ; scarcely half a dozen keep cows. A cow cannot be ridden, and it must be watered and milked with absolute regularity or it will run dry ; and of all the products of civilisation, regular routine is the most hateful to the Polynesian. I have spoken elsewhere of horses. The ancestors of the present breed were brought from New Zealand some forty years ago, but through promiscuous breeding they have dwindled to the size of the American mustang, \u2014 hard wiry ponies, without either mouth or paces, full of tricks and ill-temper, but capable of covering immense distances without fatigue. They vary in price from a few shillings to \u00a37 or \u00a38. The Government might easily have improved the breed by making gelding compulsory, or by enforcing the horse - tax ; as it is, the country is overrun with wretched beasts, covered with sores, whose only use is to keep the grass short. I remember one of the police magistrates applying to the Government for an impounded horse,\u2014 \" not that I may ride it, but because I am old, and there is no one to weed my enclosure.\""], [410, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 390 One result of the introduction of horses has been the almost entire destruction of the bread-fruit-tree through out Tonga. The glutinous sap is irresistible to horses, and they greedily tear off the bark as far up the trunk as they can reach, of course killing the tree. The men ride like centaurs, but, unlike centaurs, they have no hands. As a consequence, the Tongan pony has no mouth. Almost as soon as the boys can walk they are galloping barebacked, with no bridle but a rope knotted round the horse's nose. Grown men generally use a saddle of some kind without girths or surcingle, and too often without stuffing. The women have not yet taken to riding like their cousins in Hawaii, who have even converted the European women of the place to trousers and a man's saddle. The people are as cruel to their animals as the Egyp tian donkey-boys. A sore back is never thought a reason for sparing a horse. I have seen ponies returning from the plantations in the evening with a basket of yams slung on either side with a sinnet cord, which was cutting deep into a bleeding raw on the withers. I stopped the man and tried to convince him of his brutality. He was simply incapable of comprehending the idea of cruelty to animals, \u2014 an idea which, after all, is only found among the stricter Buddhists and the Anglo-Saxons, and with the latter is but the growth of a single century. The wheel traffic of Tonga has increased enormously. Every man who can afford it has a cart, the richer natives American buggies. In wet weather the wheels cut the soft grass-roads into rivers of mud, in which the wheels are logged to the axle-trees. On such roads the heaviest"], [411, "THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. 391 cart is noiseless, and so after nightfall they are compelled by law to carry a light. The law is satisfied by the economical expedient of a smouldering brand, visible no farther than a lighted cigar. There is little bird-life in the islands, but two of the species show remarkable peculiarities. The kaka, a green parrot common to all the islands of Fiji, is in Tonga con fined to the little island of Eua. Though tame parrots have been taken across the narrow strait that separates Eua from Tongatabu, and have escaped in the larger island, they have never bred there. Wallace has recorded the fact that land-birds will not cross a deep-water strait, however narrow ; but no one has offered a plausible ex planation of the arrival of the kaka in Eua without touch ing at Tongatabu. The Eua species differs slightly from the green parrot of Fiji. Stranger still is the presence of the megapodius (nudao) in Niuafoou (Boscawen Island), which, if one may judge from the absence of a fringing reef and the volcanic nature of the soil, is of more recent formation than the others. It is covered with the large mounds in which this ener getic little bird lays its eggs, leaving them to be hatched by the sun if they be fortunate enough to escape the eyes of the people or the pigs of the place. These eggs, enor mous when compared with the size of the bird, have been for centuries regarded as a delicacy of Tongatabu, and have been exported thither in every canoe sailing south ward during the breeding season. I was told (with what truth I know not, for I tried it aud failed) that the eggs thus taken to Tongatabu are often hatched artificially and the young malao reared. The jungle of the southern"], [412, "392 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. islands differs little from that of Niuafoou. Whence comes it, then, that a bird so hardy in its breeding arrangements should be confined to that one small island ? and how is it that a bird whose eastern limit is the Solomon Islands should be found in Polynesia at all, after skipping all the intermediate islands of Melanesia ? If it was brought thither by man, of what strange story of the migration of races is it the only surviving record ? This is not Nature's only caprice in respect of this strange bird. Its enormous egg, its untiring industry in mound building, its unnatural indifference to its young, its wari ness on foot, and its wonderful stupidity when forced to take to flight, give to it and its allied species an exclusive position among birds. The natives of New Guinea catch and tame the young by the simple expedient of building a fence round the mound. The little creatures, hatched by the warmth of the decaying leaves among which the mother lays them, scratch their way to the surface fully equipped for their fight with Nature, and are easily caught within the circle of the fence. In British New Guinea, where the megapodius was often our only animal food, it was some time before I learned the secret of shooting him. When he first sees you he runs like a pheasant, stopping every twenty yards or so to reconnoitre. You stalk him, but find that lie always keeps a few yards out of shot, until you lose him altogether among the trees. The only way to make sure of him is to run after him as soon as he sees you. He then discovers that his legs are not fast enough, and reluctantly takes to wing, flaps awkwardly to the nearest bough, and there, secure in his commanding position, and proud of the"], [413, "393 THINGS ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL. mighty effort he has made, he sits blinking at you until you get within easy shot. This fatuous behaviour is not likely to bring about his extermination, for the natives of New Guinea prize his eggs so much as a delicacy that they are most unwilling to kill him.

As she came near to us we shot at her with one of our pieces right over her to make them strike, but they would not ; so then we lowered our boat with ten small arms men in her to catch them, which, calling to them, we shot another piece, yet without any intent to reach or hurt them, but they would not strike."], [417, "397 EXTRACTS FROM JOURNAL OF SCHOUTEN. When at about half a musket-shot's distance from them our men fired four times at them. Some jumped into the water, one of them with a small child. We hauled one out of the water, and another was hurt, and had three holes in his back, but not very deep, for it was hail-shot. In our vessel we secured two men who had overstayed on board the canoe, they not once resisting, for in truth they had no arms. One was an old and grey man, the other was a youth. Presently the shallop rowed to fetch those that leapt overboard to save their lives ; but they got only two of them that drove upon one of their oars, and pointed to our men with their hands to the ground, as much as to say that the rest were drowned. In the canoe were eight women with three young sucking children, and some were about ten years old, so that altogether there may have been about twenty -five people in the canoe. Towards evening we put the men aboard again, and they were much welcomed by their women. We gave them some beads, which they hung about their necks, and some knives. And to us they presented two fine mats and two cocoa-nuts, which were all they had to eat and drink. In fact they had drunk all the water of the nuts, so that there remained nothing more to them to drink. We saw them drink salt water out of the sea, and give it also to their young children to drink, which we thought to be against nature. They were reddish people, and had certain clothes of a yellowish colour which they wore before their persons. They were smeared with oil, and the women had all short hair, like the men in Holland. The men's hair was long and frizzed, and very black. Their vessel was fashioned as shown in the drawing \u2014 very remarkable to see \u2014 and consisted of two long canoes covered by a good broad table. Along each canoe were laid two wide planks, about the midship portion, to keep out the water ; and at either end timbers were laid crosswise from the one hull to the other, securely lashed, and the ends were also decked over in a watertight fashion. [Further description of mast and steer-"], [418, "398 APPENDIX. ing-gear.] As they departed from us they set their course towards the south-east, in the hopes of picking up some of the others, who were good swimmers. On the 10th the wind was S.S.-easterly, veering from S.E. to S. The course was W. and S.W. ; and in the morning, after breakfast, we saw [on the horizon 1] some very high and blue looking land lying between S.E. and S., about eight miles from us. We sailed all day towards it with a light air, but were un able to get within reach, so stood off and on for the night ; and towards evening we saw a sail a good way out off the land, and shortly after another one, which we took to be fishing craft, because they put to sea at night time and used torches. On the llth we arrived by mid-day at an island which was very high ; and about two miles beyond it we saw another island, long and low. During the day we sailed over a bank with fourteen fathoms water on it, rocky bottom, lying about two miles off the land. As soon as we had passed over it we were unable again to get soundings. We anchored in twenty five fathoms, sandy bottom, a long shot from the shore of the farther island. The island is a high mountain, shaped nearly like one of the Moluccas, and is covered with timber, mostly cocoa-nut palms, wherefore we called it Cocos Island. The other island is much longer, but narrower, and lies east and west. . . . [Intercourse with the people followed readily, and great numbers swarmed on board the ship. They traded freely, and sold 180 cocoa-nuts by evening, at the rate of 5 nuts for a few beads.] Canoes from the other island came off to the ship. The natives had hardwood staves in their hands like assegais. They boarded our shallop, and thought to have taken it from us ; but our men being thereby constrained to defend themselves, let fly three muskets among them. At first they thought this was child's play ; but the third shot struck one of them in the"], [419, "399 EXTRACTS FROM JOURNAL OF SCHOUTEN. breast, and they fled to one of the canoes with sails and tried to persuade them to attack, but they would not, having been well used by us. They were very thievish and exceedingly de sirous of iron, trying to draw the bolts out of the ship. They were of fine stature, well-proportioned, naked but for an apron. Their hair was dressed and frizzed, and some had long hair tied up in a knot. They were notable swimmers. Cocos Island lies in lat. 16\u00b0 10'. On the \\'2th, in the morning, trading was reopened. We bought 1 200 nuts that day ; also bananas, obas [yams], and some water. The ship had eighty-five people all told on board, and every one had a dozen nuts. The king of the other island sent a canoe with a black wild pig as a present to us. In the after noon the chief himself came with a great sailing canoe, fashioned as has been described heretofore, like an ice-sled, and was ac companied by quite thirty-five small canoes. This chief was called by his people Latent} We received him with drums and trumpets, no little to his astonishment, as he had not seen or heard these instruments before. Many of the people who accompanied this chief kissed our feet, bowing and clapping their fists together over their heads, and other strange cere monies, and showed great wonderment at our ship. The chief seemed to have good authority over his people. The chief himself could not be induced to come on board our ship, but his son did. 13/7). \u2014 In the morning fully forty-five small canoes and an armada of twenty-three sailing ones came off towards us to trade. The latter had about twenty-five men in each, and the former four and five apiece. They wanted us to sail over to the other island, and we weighed anchor and proceeded \u2014 the chief sailing in his canoe abreast of us. Presently the chief made a signal, and boarded us with great force, breaking the prow of his canoe, and thereat the rest began 1 Latu is still the title of the chief of Niua-tobutabu. Cf. Fijian title Ratu."], [420, "400 APPENDIX. to sling stones at us ; but we shot at them with muskets and three great pieces loaded with nails, whereat they leaped over board, not knowing whither to go. But we continued our course, sailing W. and W. by S. This king must have assembled all his forces, for we were surrounded by quite 1000 people afloat, of whoni one we noticed was wholly white. The first island \u2014 the high one \u2014 we called Cocos bergh, and to the other, about a mile from it, we gave the name of Verraders Eylandt, because the people from it sought to betray us. [Discovery of Niuafoou.] lifh. \u2014 This morning we saw another island right ahead of us, about seven miles distant, appearing as if round in form, and by our reckoning about fifty miles from the islands we had left. We named this one \"Hope,\" and hurried towards it, in the hope that we might find better facilities for watering there than we had hitherto. . . . The soundings were irregular, forty, twenty, thirty fathoms, and no bottom. . . . Twelve canoes came off: were friendly. They gave us four flying-fish, and we gave them beads. Sent the boat along shore for water : some jumped overboard from canoes to capture the boat, which seeing, we fired six musket-shots at them, and two were killed, one shot dead, while the other sat in the canoe wiping the blood from his chest with his hand. They could not understand the shooting, for they saw no missile. The people on shore cried out Bou ! bou I bou ! So did people in the canoes. Finding no anchorage, we got our boat in and went on our course, in the hope of soon finding other land, to the S.W. The island was full of black cliffs, green on the top, and black, and was full of cocos - trees and black earth. There was a large village and several other houses on the sea-shore : the land was undulating, but not very high. We called it Good Hope, because we had had good hope of refreshing there."], [421, "EXTRACTS FROM JOURNAL OF SCHOUTEN. 401 15th. \u2014 At noon we were in 86\u00b0 12' [misprint for 16\u00b0 12'] the wind being S.E., course W. and W. by S., fine weather. 17th. \u2014 Wind N.E., course W. by S., but the two last quar ters we set our course W.N.W.

[On this day Schouten reviewed his position and prospects, and spoke to his crew, pointing out the shortness of food, and the impossibility of returning eastwards. The Terra Australis, of which they were in search, had not appeared, though they were 1600 miles to the westward of the coast of Peru. It remained only to steer more northerly and make for the Moluc cas, braving the dangers of the New Guinea navigation, and making the best of their ill luck. The course was therefore altered to N.N.W.] [Discovery of Futuna.] 19th. \u2014 Southerly wind. Course N.

Fired two cannon-shots. Sent boat out to sound, but got no bottom, eight small-arms men in her. A fight ensued, and six were killed. Stood off and on all night. 22ri. \u2014 Sent the boat in to sound again, and got anchorage in thirty-five fathoms, a gun-shot from shore. The Captain went in the boat and got a convenient place for the ship to moor in, close to a fresh-water creek inside the reef. Canoes came and brought cocoa-nuts, and obas, and two roast pigs. We paid them in 2 C"], [422, "402 . APPENDIX. knives, beads, and nails. We sent four of our men to be hos tages on shore, and kept some of the people in the ship. These people were very active, swam and dived with great skill, like those we met with at the other islands. There were round huts along the beach, thatched, about 25 feet in circumference, and 1 2 feet in height, with a doorway. . . . [The Journal contains the earliest published description of the drinking of kava, which coincides with the present cere mony. Peace was established, visits of ceremony paid, and cordial relations maintained.
