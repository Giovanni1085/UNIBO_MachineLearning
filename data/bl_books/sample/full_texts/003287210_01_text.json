It is a fact which cannot but, be surprising to every one who has at all looked into the subject, that notwithstanding the extraordinary efforts which have within the last thirty or forty years been made by great men of all countries in investigating the History of Rome \u2014 her Constitution, Laws, Religion. Literature and Social condition \u2014 and notwithstanding the important results which have not only changed the aspect of the early History of Rome but have at the same time given a different tone and colour to the later history of that extraor dinary nation, \u2014 the books on Roman History which are used in our schools still continue, to a great extent, ti be what they were half a century ago. Old errors and misconce tions, which have long since been exposed and exploded by scholars, are daily re peated and impressed upon the mind and memory of the rising generation ; and the student is left to discover these errors at a maturer age, when it is not always an easy matter to get rid of them. But why, in the name of truth, should boys con tinue to learn that which has been proved again and again to be false and incorrect, aud which afterwards they have to unlearn ? The teacher has so much to do in storing the minds of his pupils with knowledge, and in training their mental powers to independent activity, that it is worse than waste of time to teach that which is false or unsound, and which in the"], [12, "IV PREFACE. progress of their studies must prove an obstacle rather than an assistance. So long as any science, of whatever kiud it may be, is yet in its infancy, and so long as no great and positive results have been gained in it, the subject is not a fit one for educational purposes : only that which is well known and firmly esta blished can form a solid foundation for a youth to take his stand upon, from which afterwards he may extend his studies in whatever direction he pleases. What is here said of science in general, holds good also of any uncertain or disputed points in any science of which use is made for educational purposes. But if in any subject which does form part of a liberal educa tion great and important discoveries have been made, certainly no teacher who is in earnest about the intellectual advance ment of those intrusted to his care can with indifference over look and disregard the new light which has been thrown on that subject. But this, unfortunately, is the case with Roman His tory : it is taught more or less in all schools, and in the majority of cases without the least regard to the immense pro gress that has been made in it since the year 1811, when Niebuhr published the first edition of the first volume of his great work. The object which the author of the present undertaking has kept in view, was to produce a book which should place the History of Rome before the young student in a manner worthy of, and consistent with, the progress which has been made in this branch of our historical knowledge. Whether he has been successful in his attempt, he must leave others to judge. It should, however, be bome in mind, that to condense and to select out of an immense mass of detail that which is really necessary to give a vivid picture of any period in history, is often far more difficult than to give a minute narrative of all the particulars recorded in the authorities. In conformity"], [13, "PREFACE. V with the principle above laid down, he has stated as facts those points which are now acknowledged by all competent judges to be facts, though in older books they are either not mentioned at all or are placed in a wrong light. Among them he may mention the nature of the plebeians, and their relation to the patricians, which render the history of the long-pro tracted struggle between the two orders so instructive and interesting ; the character of the ager publicus and of the agrarian laws ; for these are no longer the opinions of this or that scholar, but facts established as firmly as any others in history. Those points, on the other hand, which are still matters of uncertainty or dispute, have when necessary been stated as such, or passed over altogether in order not to confuse the learner. References to ancient authorities have been given only where they seemed to be of particular interest, and on the whole the author has been sparing of them, partly in order not to increase the bulk of the work, which even as it is has grown larger than he anticipated, and partly because he knows from experience that they are of little use to young students, the majority of whom are not in the possession of all the ancient writers, and if they were, would not be able to consult them with advantage. He needs hardly remark, that he has availed himself of all the more important works on Roman History, or portions of it, which have appeared since the time when Niebuhr gave a fresh life and new impulse to the subject ; and wherever the opinions of Niebuhr have been confirmed by subsequent investi gations, the author has not scrupled to adopt them, and even to use his very words, when they seemed to him to convey in the most appropriate manner that which he had to state : those words, when he had the happiness of being among the pupils of that distinguished man, made in many instances so deep an impression upon his then youthful mind, that it would be at"], [14, "VI PREFACE. once difficult and painful to him to express his sentiments in any other language. But, notwithstanding his veneration for his instructor, he has endeavoured to exercise his own judgment, as will be perceived by those who are acquainted with the views of Niebuhr. When the author entered upon his undertaking, he intended to carry the History of Rome down to the year a.d. 476, that is, to the overthrow of the Western Empire ; but during the execution he found that, in order to get the whole within reason able compass, he should have to curtail considerably the history of those periods which are of most importance to young scholars : to make this sacrifice for the purpose of being able to relate the history of a period which offers little to instruct aud less to interest a young mind, and nothing calculated to ennoble the feelings, seemed to him to be opposed to the objects for which the book was intended. He has therefore carried the History of the Empire no further than to the death of Commodus, at which time the moral degradation of the Empire reached its highest point ; and he must refer those who wish to prose cute the study onward, to the master-work of Gibbon, or to the brief but graphic sketches in Niebuhr's Lectures on Roman History. In conclusion, he ventures to express a hope, that the present work, though mainly designed for schools and colleges, may be found a not unwelcome gift to the more intelligent among general readers.

INTRODUCTION. GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE HISTORY OF ROME. \u2014 ITALY AND ITS EARLIEST INHABITANTS. T^YEEY nation owes the position it occupies in the history of the world, partly to its innate genius, and partly to the cir cumstances under the influence of which it grows and develops its character. In the history of Eome both these things combined to make her the mistress of the world; and often when circum stances had reduced her to the last extremities, her peculiar genius rose with fresh vigour and energy, and carried victory before it. From the moment of her foundation Eome had to secure her existence by force of arms; and like a young giantess, she crushed, one after another, every one of her neighbours that came in contact with her, until towards the end of the fifth century after her birth, she had subdued all the tribes of Italy, and acquired the sovereignty of the whole peninsula. What, in her youth, the giantess had been obliged to do in self-defence, and what had been a struggle for her own existence, became in the end her favourite pursuit ; one war ever gave rise to fresh wars ; she hastened from victory to victory, and from conquest to conquest, till about the beginning of the Christian era she dictated her laws to nearly the whole of the known world. A B"], [22, "2 HISTORY OF ROME. most wonderful system of polity, such as in ancient times was devised only by the genius of the Eomans, and as is seen in modern times only in the vast empire of Britain, kept together the heterogeneous masses of nations and countries, that were brought under one rule : one mighty spirit pervaded the whole system of government and administration, and gave to the empire its life and its power. But what had been built up by the virtues of the earlier Eomans, was lost or destroyed by the vices of their degenerate descendants, and, after Eome had enjoyed her triumphant existence for nearly a thousand years, the ancient spirit gradually died away ; the lifeless mass of the empire sank into decay and dissolution, and the whole became the prey of barbarians, who invaded it on all sides, and raised new king doms and states upon its ruins. But the spirit of dominion which had been developed at Eome, and was now vmable to maintain itself by the power of the sword, .could not renounce its former habits, and after the fall of the Eoman empire, that spirit of dominion showed itself in a different form : Eome assumed the spiritual and ecclesiastical supremacy, and for a period of more than a thousand years ruled over the whole of the Christian world as its spiritual sovereign. At the time of the Eeformation this power again was broken, and broken by the descendants of those same barbarians who, a thousand years before, had brought about the overthrow of the Eoman empire. Only a shadow and a faint echo still continue to exist, to tell the tale of the former greatness of the eternal city. The history of Eome forms the transition from ancient to modern times, and it is mainly owing to this intermediate posi tion of Eome between the two that we are indebted for our knowledge of the ancient world and its history. This is a point which we ought not to forget, when at times we hear of the immense ravages and devastations which mark the conquests of the Eomans in various countries. Innumerable treasures of Greek art and literature would have been lost and forgotten, were it not for the intervention of Eome, where a certain spark"], [23, "ITS IMPORTANCE. 3 of the spirit of antiquity was glimmering, throughout the middle ages, beneath the overwhelming heaps of its nuns ; until, about the middle of the 15th century, at the time of the revival of letters, it burst forth into a blazing flame which soon spread light and warmth over the whole of civilised Em-ope. But more important than all this is the fact, that the whole of our modern civilisation is only a further development of that of the Eomans, and is essentially based upon it; for the history of all the nations of antiquity ends in that of Eome, and that of all modern nations has grown out of that of Eome. The languages of Italy and its surrounding islands, of Spain, Portugal, Trance, and to some extent of England also, are to this very day so many proofs of the power and influence of the Eomans in those countries. These languages are only dialects formed from the Latin, and modified by time and a variety of circumstances; and whoever wishes to acquire a thorough knowledge of them will find the key in a proper understanding of the Latin. The greater number of the towns in the southern and middle parts of Europe are foundations of the Eomans, and owe their origin to then- wonderful system of colonisation. In this respect, again, there is no modern nation which presents such striking re- semblances with Eome as England, whose spirit and system of colonisation is not equalled by any other European nation. The barbarians, who destroyed the Eoman empire towards the end of the fifth century of our era, were themselves subdued by the spirit of Eome, which still continued to live in her institutions and her language ; and thus it came to pass, that, although Eome's political and military power was broken, yet the spirit of her institutions and language exercised its influence upon the victorious barbarians, and so became the groundwork of a new European civilisation. Proofs of this readily present themselves to an attentive observer in all the countries of Europe, from its southernmost point to the Baltic and the extreme north of Scot land. But it was, above all things, the Eoman law, the most genuine and perfect production of the Eoman mind, that retained b 2"], [24, "4 HISTORY OF ROME. its influence almost unimpaired. No nation of antiquity had shown such wisdom in its legislation, or brought its code of laws to such a state of perfection and internal consistency as the Eoman ; nay, there is, perhaps, not one among modem nations that in this respect can be compared with it. This legacy of the Eoman mind, therefore, continued to retain its ascendancy down to the latest times, among the nations which conquered Eome. In England the Eoman law, it is true, never struck such firm root as in some other countries, especially in Germany, where a shadow of the Eoman emperors continued to exist down to the beginning of the present century ; but, even in our English law, the traces of Eoman influence are greater and more nume rous than people are inclined to think ; and, it is not too much to say, that a considerable portion of Eoman law is still in force among us. In like mamier it may be asserted that the Latin language, properly speaking, was never reduced to the state of a perfectly dead language, in the sense in which the ancient Hebrew and many others became so. Eor although, after the fall of the western empire, the language of the people, by a mixture with the languages of the barbarians, was gradually transformed into the Italian, Srjanish, and Erench, yet the Latin language continued to be written in all parts of Europe down to the middle of the last century ; and throughout the middle ages all works of a philosophical or scientific nature were written in Latin. In the church of Eome, Latin is the ordinary language down to this day. Until the last century, Latin was thus the common language of all scholars, philosophers, and men of science in all Europe. The practice of writing works belonging to the higher species of literature in Latin has, indeed, ceased in our days ; but whether science is really benefited by the innovation or not, is a question which is still open to some doubt. A nation which has exercised such an influence upon the fate of its contemporaries, and upon posterity, has a claim to the most careful consideration of every thinking man ; and all that can be said of the importance of history in general holds good in"], [25, "DESCRIPTION OF ITALY. 5 a much higher degree in that of Eome. As there is no modern nation whose history presents so many points of resemblance and comparison with that of Eome as the English, so the history of Eome deserves the greatest attention of every Englishman, who has here an opportunity of seeing the history of his own country, as it were, foreshadowed in a mirror. There is a class of persons who look at all historical studies, and more especially at the study of antiquity, with disregard, if not with contempt, and at best treat it only as a matter of curiosity. Such a mode of thinking however is only the fruit of ignorance, which generally depreciates that which lies beyond its comprehension ; and, surely, no one ought to listen to the advice of persons who talk about things of which they are ignorant. That school of modern philo sophy, moreover, which would fain turn our eyes from the past, and persuade us to look only to the present and the future, is of the very shallowest kind : it removes from under our feet the firm ground on which we stand, and shows as much wisdom as it would if it taught us to believe that men were made for flying instead of walking. He who wishes to comprehend the present, and divine the future, must take his lessons from the past; for it is there that he finds the roots of the present, and the germs of the future. Italy is a peninsula stretching into the Mediterranean, in a south-eastern direction, from the foot of the Alps to the straits of Sicily. The length from north-west to south-east is about 750 miles : its breadth, in the central parts, about 150 miles. In the north, where its breadth is greatest, it is protected by the Alps against the influence of the north winds. A range of mountains issuing from the western Alps, and running along the coast of Genoa, traverses Italy from north to south, and, form ing as it were the spine of the peninsula, sends out its ramifi cations and rivers to the west and to the east, thus creating the most beautiful valleys and fertile plains. This range of mountains bears the name of the Apennines (Apenninus mons) : in the south it seems to have been originally connected with"], [26, "6 HISTORY OF ROME. the mountains of Sicily, from which it was torn asunder by the formation of the straits of Sicily. The two halves, into which Italy is divided by the Apennines, are countries of a totally different nature : the part east of the Apemiines is a country of secondary or still more frequently of tertiary formation, and of quite the same character as Ulyricum on the opposite side of the Adriatic ; the western part, on the other hand, is mostly of a volcanic nature, and of the same kind as the islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica : so that the Apennines rise between two large valleys, the deepest parts of which are filled on the one side by the Adriatic, and on the other by the Tyrrhenian sea. The northern part of Italy, between the Alps, the Apennines, and the Adriatic, forms an extensive plain (the plain of Lombardy) inter sected by the river Po, and its numerous tributaries; while the whole of Italy, south of this large plain, is a more or less mountainous country, including the richest and most fertile plains and valleys, with hilly districts of the most beautiful and picturesque character. The whole peninsula enjoys, generally speaking, a clear, bright, and transparent atmosphere, and is endowed by nature with the greatest advantages and facilities both for agriculture and commerce. No wonder, therefore, that Italy in ancient times was one of the most popidous and best? cultivated countries : the number of its towns is said to have amounted at one time to 1197. * The name Italy (Italia) was originally confined to the southern most part of what was afterwards called Bruttium, and was believed to have been derived from the numerous and fine oxen (vituli, IraXoi) which that district produced:5 it was afterwards extended to the country south of the river Laos, in the west, and Metapontum in the east ; Tarentum being beyond the limits 1 \u00c6lian, Var.

Lastly, about the time of Polybius, the name was used in its widest extent, embracing the country from the rivers Macra and Eubicon to the straits of Sicily ; so that Etruria and Umbria were regarded as countries in Italy. The extent of country from the foot of the Alps down to the rivers Macra and Eubicon was called Cisalpine Gaul (Gallia Cisalpina), being inhabited by a number of Gallic tribes. There are many other names used by poets as designations of the peninsula : they are derived either from the inhabitants of particular districts, or are connected with and explained by certain Greek legends : names of this kind are Hesperia, Opica, Ausonia, Oenotria, Camesene, Argessa, Saturnia. The greater part of Italy was inhabited, in the earliest tunes, by Pelasgians, belonging to the same stock as the original inha bitants of Greece. The Siculians about the lower part of the Tiber, the Tyrrhenians in Etruria, the Aborigines in the neigh bourhood of Eeate (also called Casci, Prisci, and Sacrani), the Chones and Oenotrians in the west, and the Peucetians in the east of southern Italy, appear to have been branches of the widely-spread race of the Pelasgians. A second great tribe, which inhabited the north of Italy, were the Umbrians, who are called the most ancient inhabitants of the country.5 Their 3 Strabo, vi. p. 254; Thucyd. vii. 33; Comp.

The country in the north- west of Italy was inhabited by the Ligurians, who, in early times, seem to have occupied a much larger tract of country than afterwards : their history however is, unfortunately, un- known to us, till the time when we find their nation in a state of decay and dissolution. The country between the Tiber and the lower sea, and as far north as the Eaetian Alps, was inha- bited by the Etruscans, or, as they called themselves, Easena. They seem to have invaded Italy from the north, and to have subdued the Pelasgian Tyrrhenians and occupied their country. The Umbrians also lost a considerable portion of their territory by the conquest of the Etruscans : tradition related that the Etruscans conquered three hundred Umbrian towns ;6 nay, the Etruscans are even said to have carried their conquests as far as Campania ; and Velleius Paterculus7 states that the towns of Nola and Capua were founded by the Etruscans about forty-seven years before the building of Eome. There can be no doubt that the Etruscans were a mighty nation : although their history is involved in the greatest obscurity, it is manifest that they pos- sessed a high degree of civilisation ; and that arts and sciences flourished among them long before the foundation of Eome, which derived many of its religious and political fornis from them. The country about Amiternum, in the Apennines, was in- habited by the Sabines, who formed the stock to which belonged the Marsians, Pelignians, Samnites, and Lucanians. These tribes, which are now usually called by the generic name of Sabel lians, produced a complete revolution in central and southern Italy, of which we shall speak hereafter. The Vestinians, Marrucinians, and Frentanians, belonged, in all probability, to the Sabellians.

The Ausonians or Auruncans formed a distinct branch of this race ; and the smaller tribes of the Volscians, Sidicines, Saticuli, and Aequi, likewise belonged to it. The Oscan lan guage was spoken throughout the south-western part of Italy, and was understood even at Eome, where Oscan plays were per formed and understood down to a comparatively late period. The peninsula forming the south-west of Italy was inhabited by the Oenotrians ; and the districts to the north and east of the Oenotrians were occupied by the Daunians, Chones, Peucetii, and Sallentines or Messapians. We must add the- observation, that the whole of southern Italy, from the river Silarus in the west and the Erento in the east, was afterwards called Magna Graecia, on account of the numerous Greek colonies established in that part of the country, which formed the connecting link between the civilisation, arts, and literature of the Italians and the Greeks of the mother country.

Latium, which Aristotle1 describes as a district of Opica, anciently extended from the mouth of the Tiber in the north to Cape Circeii in the south, and was subsequently distinguished as such by the name of Latium vetus or antiquwm? At a later time the name of Latium was extended as far south as the mouth of the river Liris, and inland as far as the country of the Marsians and Pelignians; and Latium, in this extent, was distinguished from ancient Latium by the name of Latium novum or adjectum. According to Aristotle, who calls Latium a district in Opica, its inhabitants would have been the Oscans or Opicans ; but, according to the traditions of the Eomans themselves, which are coDected and minutely discussed in Dionysius, Latium was inha bited, in the earliest times, by Siculi, a Pelasgian tribe, whom tradition traced to some mytliical king Latinus. These Siculi were connected with the Itali in the extreme south of Italy. The district north-east of Latium, in the neighbourhood of Eeate and Carseoli, was inhabited by the Aborigines, a kindred tribe of the Siculi. These Aborigines were driven from their seats, and urged forward to the river Anio, by the Sabines.3 The Sicu lians of Latium were obliged to give way before the Aborigines,4 and a portion of them are said to have emigrated to Sicily, which 1 Polit. vii. 10. or Pelasgians; but the fact is, that both Umbrians and Opicans were in all probability Pelasgians, like the Aborigines. 2 Plin.\u00c6.iV.iii.9; Strabo, v. p. 231. 3 Dionys. ii. 49. 4 Some writers call the conquerors of the Siculians, Opicans, Umbrians,"], [31, "INHABITANTS OF LATIUM. 11 derived its name from them. The ancient name of the Abori gines was Casci, Prisci, or Sacrani ;5 and, in connection with those Siculians who remained behind in Latium, they gradually formed the people of the Prisci Latini, that is, Prisci et Latini, or simply Latini. The emigration of the Siculians to Sicily was placed by some ancient historians about the year B.C. 126-t,6 but by Thucydides\" at a considerably later period, viz., about nine hundred years previous to the first Greek settlements in Sicily, that is, about B.C. 1035. But these chronological statements cannot be considered as of any historical value. The Aborigines are described by the poets and historians of later ages as a savage nation, without laws and civilised manners, and as Uving on the produce of the chase ; but this description seems to be no more than a sort of philosophical notion, which persons of a civilised age are always apt to form of the earliest periods of then- history : we know that the Aborigines were an agricultural people, and lived in villages and towns, of which Varro, in his Origines, has given a list, and some of which con tinued to be inhabited in the time of Dionysius of Halicamassus, such as Palatium on the Quintian road. Most of these towns, however, lay in ruins.3 The population of Latium was thus a mixed one: consisting, on the one hand, of Siculians, Aborigines, and Oscans, all of whom belonged to the Pelasgian race ; and on the other, of Sabellians (Sabines). This fact is not only stated in the ancient traditions, but is manifest from the language spoken in Latium (the Latin language, or the language of the Latins), for we can still distinguish the two elements : one is of a Pelasgian character, and constitutes the great affinity between the Latin and Greek languages; the other element, which is utterly foreign to the Greek, is of Sabellian origin. From these elements, so far as they are discernible, we may form some 5 Saufeius in Servius ad Virg.Aen. Dionys. i. 22. i. 6 ; comp.

Most Latin words relating to agriculture, and a more civilised state of society, are the same in Latin and Greek ; but others, which are of Sabelhan origin, are chiefly words relating to war and the chase. The Aborigines are said to have worshipped Janus, as the founder of a better mode of life : Saturn was believed to have taught them husbandry, and accustomed them to live in fixed habitations. Janus, or Dianus, was the god of the sun : Saturn and his wife Ops were, in all probability, the god and goddess of the earth ; that is, the personifications of the vivi fying and productive powers of the earth. Late accounts de scribe Saturn as a king who, after being expelled from his own dominions, arrived in Italy by sea, and was hospitably received by Janus. The story of Hercules arriving in Latium, and of his adventure there with the fire-breathing giant Cacus,9 has been looked upon by some writers as suggesting an immigration into Latium from the east ; and it is asserted that Cacus, who was slain by Hercules, is identical with the Cretan Talus, or even the Ph\u0153nician Moloch : but this opinion is more than doubtful ; and if any inference is to be drawn at all from the wanderings of Hercules through, Italy, it is that they suggest the spreading of the Pelasgians and their civilisation throughout the western parts of Italy and in Liguria. The same idea is implied in the tra dition of Evander, the Arcadian, arriving hi Italy with a train of followers; but this story, although ancient and home-sprung, seems to be based only on an etymological speculation, and to be no more than a fiction. We mentioned above, that the ancient Pelas gian town of Palatium, which was situated on a hill near the Tiber, about twenty stadia from Eeate, was still inhabited in the time of Augustus. The name of this town naturally reminding the Greeks of the Arcadian town of Pallantium, some ancient connection of the two places was devised by the imagination in the shape of a genealogy, which would be done the more easily, 9 Dionys. i. 39 ; Liv. i. 7."], [33, "TROJANS IN LATIUM. 13 as Pelasgian and Arcadian are convertible terms with the Greek genealogists. Evander, accordingly, was said to have come from Arcadia, to have landed in Italy near the Tiber, and introduced there a knowledge of the arts and the ways of civilised life. During his reign Hercules arrived in his kingdom, was hospitably received, and obtained Evander's daughter Launa (Lavinia) in marriage. By her he became the father of Pallas, and from this Pallas the hill and town of Palatium were made to receive their name. Evander himself seems to be only another form of Latinus, for the legends of the two bear a strong resemblance to each other. But tradition separates them by two generations, making Picus and Faunus the successors of Evander, before Latinus became king of the Aborigines. In his reign Aeneas is said to have landed in Italy with his Trojans. The tradition of the Trojan colony in Latium is the more important, as it stands in direct connection with the stories about the foundation of Eome. It shoidd not indeed be regarded in any other light than as a fiction ; but it cannot be passed over unnoticed, forming as it does the direct road to the earliest part of Eoman story. It would be a hopeless undertaking to seek for any direct or circumstantial evidence to prove the tradition either to be historical or fabulous ; and in the absence of all evidence, considering also the time of the reputed immigration of the Trojans \u2014 the destruction of Troy is commonly dated about 430 years previous to the building of Eome \u2014 no one imbued with the spirit of historical criticism can for a moment allow the tradition about the Trojan colony to be of any historical weight. If indeed that colony were described as numerous, and as one that coidd by any possibility have had an influence upon the people among whom it settled, we might expect to discover some trace or other by which to establish its truth ; but giving the greatest latitude to the tradition, the Trojan immigrants were only a small band, for whom the fields of a sino-le village would have been sufficient, and they cannot possibly have changed or modified the character and manners"], [34, "14 HISTORY OF ROME. of their neighbours. The only questions therefore that we can endeavour to answer here, are, whether the tradition arose in Italy ? or whether it was introduced there by the Greeks ? and what was its probable origin ? The story itself runs thus. After long wanderings, Aeneas and his Trojans arrived in Latium, and as signs seemed to point to that country as the end of their suiferings, they took possession of a part of it. When king Latinus received the tidings of the arrival of the strangers, and of their attempt to settle in his dominions, he marched out with an army to expel them; but as he had to cany on a war against Turnus, king of the Eutuli, he concluded an alliance with the Trojans, .and gave them a tract of land. With their assistance, he then conquered the Eutuli. Aeneas married Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus, and called his colony, after her, Lavinium. Another war with the Eutuli soon broke out, and as Latinus fell in it, Aeneas henceforth ruled over the Aborigines and Trojans, to both of whom he gave the joint name of Latins. The Butuli now strengthened themselves by an alliance with the Etruscan Mezentius. The Latins were victorious in the ensuing struggle, but Aeneas was slain in battle, and as his body could not be found anywhere, he was believed to have ascended into heaven, the people henceforth worshipping him under the name of Jupiter Indiges.1\" This is the story of Aeneas and his Trojan colony, as related by Livy and Dionysius : it was also adopted by Virgil, though with poetical license he has extended and embellished it with a variety of incidents. The earliest writers on the Trojan war, and on the subsequent fate of its heroes, do not appear to have known anything about a Trojan colony in Latium : Cephalon of Ger githes, who probably lived about 350 years after the building of Eome, seems to have been the first to introduce Aeneas into Latium : but while the common story represents Ascanius as the son and successor of Aeneas, and assumes an interval of many 10 Liv. i. 2 ; Dionys. i. SS."], [35, "ORIGIN OF THE STORY OF AENEAS. 15 generations between Aeneas and the foundation of Borne, Cephalon called one of the sons of Aeneas, Eomus, and stated that this Eomus in conjunction with his followers built the city of Eome.\" From that time forward the story gained more and more ground among the Greeks ; and at the time when Pyrrhus waged war against Eome, which then for the first time attracted the atten tion of the eastern world, the belief in its being a Trojan colony appears to have been generally entertained by the Greeks.12 Another tradition, which is evidently much older, since it is alluded to even by Hesiod,13 represents Latium as having received a colony consisting of the Greeks who, on their return from Troy, were thrown on its coasts ; just as other places in Italy were believed to have been founded by Greeks returning from the Trojan war. But this tradition never became popular ; and the one universally adopted by the Eomans, in later times, was that of which an outline is given above. Now it can scarcely be conceived that a traditional story like this, so firmly established, and so universally believed by a proud nation like the Eomans, who looked with contempt upon everything foreign, shoidd have been imported from abroad. It appears that it was current among the Eomans previous to the time when they are known to have been generally acquainted with Greek hterature, for allu sion is made to it in an occurrence belonging to about b.c. 240, ' and afterwards mention of it is made very frequently. The poet Naevius, who lived in the time of the first Punic war, related the story of Aeneas, and his arrival in Italy, at full length. Con sidering all these circumstances, it appears highly probable that the tradition was not introduced into Italy by the Greeks, but that it was home-sprung. It is in itself without the slightest historical truth or importance, as we shall endeavour to show by what we conceive to have been its probable origin. It may be observed in general, that the accounts of the early 11 Dionys. i. 49. 72. 13 Theogon. 1011, &c. 12 Pausanias, i. 12; Dionys. i. 67. 14 Justin, xxviii. 1; Sueton. Claud. 25."], [36, "16 HISTORY OF ROME. migration of nations frequently indicate neither more nor less than that there existed a national affinity between the reputed immi grants and those among whom they are said to have settled; and this appears to have been the case in the present instance. The Trojans belonged to the Pelasgians ; so did also the Arca dians (from whom Evander was beheved to have come to Italy) and the Epirots on the one hand, and a great part of the inhabit ants of Italy, such as the Oenotrians, Aborigines, and Tyrrhenians, on the other ; and it was probably this national affinity, between nations of the east and of Italy, that gave rise to the stories about the coming of the Trojans into Latium, and of the migration of the Tyrrhenians to the islands of Lemnos, Imbros, and the coun tries about the Hellespont. The worship of the Penates at Lavinium was believed to be the same as that of the gods of Samothrace ; and such a belief might easily give rise to a legend about the introduction of the Penates from the east into Italy.15 The Samothracians themselves were regarded as kinsmen of the Eomans.16 Now, Samothrace was the centre of the ancient Pelas gian religion ; and as Pelasgians met there, for religious purposes, from all parts of the world, it may easily be imagined that there they awakened and strengthened in one another the belief of their kindred through a common ancestor, Aeneas. When the elements of the story had once taken root, it was, like all other legends of the kind, further developed and propa gated by oral tradition and poetry; but it was looked upon in the main as an indubitable historical fact, notwithstanding the most palpable inconsistencies, and although it might be opposed to the most firmly established events. Among the discrepancies in the various accounts we shall mention the following. Accord ing to the ordinary calculations, Troy was taken and destroyed in B.C. 1184, and Aeneas must, cossequently, have arrived in Italy a few years later ; but Virgil, probably after the example of Naevius and Timaeus, described the arrival of Aeneas in Italy 15 Serv. ad Virg.

Aen. iii. 12."], [37, "ALBA LONGA. 17 as contemporaneous with the founding of Carthage by the Ph\u0153 nician princess Dido or Elissa, about B.C. 814. 17 But to return to the story about Aeneas and his descendants: the common tradition is, that he was succeeded in the govern ment, by his son Ascanius, or, as the Eomans called him, lulus,18 who, thirty years after the foundation of Lavinium, is said to have led its inhabitants away, and to have founded the town of Alba Longa, along the slope of the Alban Mount. But besides this, there existed at Lavinium another tradition, which inverts the order of things by stating that Lavinium was an Alban colony, founded by 600 Alban families.19 A reconciliation be tween the two is attempted, in the story that the Penates, who had been carried from Lavinium to Alba, refused to dwell in the latter place; and that the Alban king, having at last consented to their being restored to the deserted Lavinium, sent with them 600 Alban families. But the story about the foimdation of Alba Longa must stand or fall with the legend of the Trojan colony. Thus much we can see clearly, that Lavinium20 was the seat of congress for the Latins : it was the sacred abode of their gods, and stood in the same relation to Latium as Panionium stood to the Ionian towns in Asia Minor. From the position which in the legends Alba Longa occupies among the communities of Latium, it seems clear that it must have existed at an earlier period than that which is implied in the tradition of its being a colony of Lavinium. The successors of Ascanius now reigned at Alba for a period of upwards of three centuries ; but the lists of the kmgs, as given by Livy and Dionysius,21 have evidently been made up in later times 17 The year of the foundation of Carthage is not the same in all ac counts. According to Velleius Pater culus (i. 6) that city was built in b.c. 819 ; accordingto Justin (xviii. 6) in b.c. 826 ; according to Syncellus in b.c. 861 ; and according to Appian (Be Reb. Pun. 1) even fifty years previous to the fall of Troy. 13 To him the Roman gens of the Julii traced its origin. 19 Dionys. i. 67. 30 The name of Lavinium is evi- dently the same as Latium. 21 Compare Ovid. stts\u00ab.iv. 39\u2014 56; Metam. xiv. 609 ; Serv. ad Virg.

All the inhabitants of Latium consisted of two distinct unions or confederacies, which conjointly bore the name of the Latins. We are forced to make this distinction in order to understand the contradictory accounts of our authorities, for commonly the Latins, or, as they are called, the Prisci Latini, are said to have inhabited thirty townships, which are called colonies of Alba, founded in the reign of Latinus Silvius ; but, in the first place, many of the towns which must have belonged to these thirty, such as Laurentum, Ardea, and Tibur, were older than Alba ; and, secondly, Pliny22 clearly distinguishes between the Lathi towns, of which he enumerates upwards of twenty, and the populi Albenses, who inhabited Alba Longa, and thirty other townships or villages. Hence we must infer that only these populi Albenses were the colonies said to have been founded by Alba, and not the other more important towns ; and that the populi Albenses were in the same or a similar relation to Alba as the Attic denies to Athens: \" they formed,\" as Niebuhr expresses it, \"the boroughs of a free commonalty,\" like the thirty plebeian tribes in the con stitution of king Servius Tullius. This Alban state took part, with the other Latin towns or states, in the common festival cele brated on the Alban Mount in honour of Jupiter Latiaris. These thirty Latin states were probably dependent cantons : they seem to have stood in the same relation to Alba, the head of the confederacy, as they subsequently did at Eome. From these preliminary investigations, it is evident that Latium long before the time assigned to the building of Eome was a flourishing country, and stocked with numerous towns and villages. Its inhabitants formed a powerful confederacy, the affairs of which were discussed in assemblies held near the well of Ferentina in 22 Hist. Nat. iii. 9."], [39, "ALBA LONGA. 19 the neighbourhood of Alba, and which extended from the Tiber in the north to Terracina in the south. The history of the con federacy previous to the building of Eome is completely lost, for the lists of the kings of Alba, as well as the number of years assigned to the reign of each, must be rejected as late fabrica tions. The founders of Eome are called descendants of the Alban kings, although the legends nowhere describe Eome as a colony of Alba."], [40, "20 HISTORY OF ROME. CHAPTEE II. THE FOUNDATION OF ROME \u2014 LEGENDS OF ROMULUS AND REMUS, AND THEIR HISTORICAL VALUE \u2014 THE TRIBES, CURIAE, AND GENTES. The story concerning the foundation of Eome was the subject of ancient lays, and was looked upon by the Eomans with implicit faith and almost religious reverence. When the Eomans began to reflect upon the probable origin of their community, they naturally fell upon the idea, which is universally met with in the history of Greek cities, that the founder's name must have had some connection with that of the city, and that consequently it must have been Eomus or the dimimitive Eomulus. Now, sup posing that there existed a neighbouring place of the name of Eemuria1 on the Aventine, the idea of a twin brother of Bomulus would naturally present itself to the mind of a Eoman antiqua rian ; and a hero Eemus, who had been slain by his brother on the Palatine, would be the result of such genealogical specula tions. The notion that Eome was the work of twin brothers was thus in all probability of Eoman origin : it is peculiarly adapted to the character of the early Eoman constitution, in which nearly all the great offices were divided between two per sons. The legends about the foundation of the city, however, have come down to us in such confusion, and with such contradictions in the various reports, that it is impossible to say what belongs to the genuine ancient tradition, and what may be mere poetical embellishments and inventions grafted upon it by later poets. 1 The existence of a place of the Remuria, is attested by Dionysius, name of Romoria, i. e. Remoria or i. 85."], [41, "FOUNDATION OF ROME. 21 There is no other town in Italy respecting the foundation of which there is so much doubt and obscurity, as there is in that of Eome -. but the origin of the eternal city was to be clothed in impenetrable darkness; its beginning is as obscure and indefinite as the time of its duration. The various statements about the date of the foundation of Eome may be divided into two classes : the first contains those accounts in which the building of the city is placed in close connection with Aeneas (or his son) and the Trojans; and the second, those in which Eome is connected with Alba Longa, through the ruling family of the Silvii2. One isolated statement places the building of Eome even before the Trojan times.3 Timaeus, without mentioning the name of any one person as founder, made the building of Eome contemporaneous with that of Carthage.4 The traditions of the first class appear to have been current principally among the Greeks, whose interest it was to connect the founder of Eome with their own mythical genealogies ; those of the second, which seem to have been a combination of national Italian traditions with others imported by the Greeks, and winch allow a considerable interval to have intervened between the arrival of Aeneas in Italy and the found ation of Eome, were adopted by the Eomans themselves. The accounts of the latter class vary, in regard to the date of the building of Eome, between the third year of the sixth Olympiad and the fourth year of the twelfth Olympiad, that is, between B.C. 753 and 729. The former of these eras was adopted by Varro : as it is supported by most authorities, and has been followed by most modern writers on Eoman history, we shall adopt it in the present work, in order to avoid confusion. We may add the remark, that Cato placed the building . of Eome one year later than Varro, that is, in B.C. 752.5 But whatever the discre pancies are in regard to the year of the foundation of the city, all 2 It is said that all the Alban kings, 3 Antiochus ap.

Be Bie Nat. 17."], [42, "22 HISTORY OF ROME. are agreed upon the day of the event ; stating that it was on the 21st of April, that is, the festival of the Palilia, when the country people, having prayed to the gods to protect and increase their flocks, and to pardon then involuntary violation of sacred spots, purified themselves by passing through a fire. That day was in later times celebrated every year as the birth-day of the city of Eome. It would be idle indeed to attempt to establish the truth of any part of the story connected with the foundation of Eome ; for whatever may have been its original form, successive story tellers and poets in the course of time established one particular form of it, which then became an article of popular belief. This beautiful form of the legend, which was related in prose by Q. Fabius Pictor and many others after him, was the subject of national songs among the Eomans as late as the time of Diony sius of HaKcarnassus. It runs as follows : \u2014 Procas, king of Alba, who belonged to the family of the Silvii, had two sons, Numitor and Amidius; and on his death he left his kingdom to Numitor, the elder. But Amulius, disregarding the will of his father, and stimulated by the love of dominion, not only deprived Numitor of his kingdom, but put his son to death, and compeDed his daughter, Ehea Silvia,\" to become a vestal virgin ; whereby he hoped effectually to secure his usurpation against any attempts on the part of Numitor's family to vindi cate then rights. Numitor himself was left in the possession of his father's private estates ; and in the enjoyment of them he lived rich and secure. But the gods interposed, and made the injured maiden the means not only of avenging the wrong that was done to her and her family, but of raising a new power, before which that of Alba and all the Latins was one day to fall prostrate. Once as Ehea Silvia was going to draw water from a well for the service of the goddess Vesta, the sight of a wolf made her fly into a cave. There Mars overpowered the timid 7 They who connect the founders tunate princess, Ilia, and make her a of Rome with Aeneas, call the unfor- daughter of Aeneas."], [43, "ROMULUS AND REMUS. 23 maiden, and then consoled her with the promise of illustrious children. But he did not protect her ; and when she was deli vered of twins, Amulius, in accordance with the severe law in regard to vestals guilty of unehastity, ordered her to be put to death. Her twins were to be drowned in the river Anio. The bowl or cradle containing the children was earned into the Tiber, which had at the time overflowed its banks far and wide, even to the foot of the woody hills. As the waters decreased, the cradle remained standing on the ground near a wild fig-tree8 at the foot of the Palatine hill. A she-wolf who came to drink at the river, and heard the whimpering of the babes, earned them into her den and suckled them ; and whenever they wanted other food than milk, a wood-pecker, (which, like the wolf, was an animal sacred to Mars) brought it them, while other birds hovered over them, and protected them from insects. This marvellous spectacle was beheld by Faustulus, the shepherd of the flocks of Amulius: he took the children, and carried them to his wife Acca Laurentia, who became their foster-mother, and brought them up with her own children, in straw huts, on the Ealatine.9 The two boys, Eomulus and Eemus, grew the stoutest among the shepherd-lads, fought bravely against wild beasts and robbers, and maintained their right against every one by their might. The followers or comrades of Eomulus were called Quintilii, and those of Eemus Fabii. Their wantonness engaged them in disputes with the shepherds of Numitor, who fed their flocks on Mount Aventine. Eemus was made captive, and dragged to Alba before Numitor, as a robber who had encroached upon his estates. When Numitor heard of the two brothers, he was involuntarily reminded s This fig-tree, called Picas Rumin alis, was preserved at Rome, and held sacred for many centuries after.

Eomulus, in the mean time, had likewise been informed of his kindred by Faustulus ; and the two brothers, joined by their faithfvd comrades, made an attack upon king Amulius. Amulius was slam in the affray, and Numitor restored to the throne of Alba. Eomulus and Eemus then resolved upon building' a town on the spot where they had passed the days of then infancy. Their former comrades joined them in their undertaking ; some say that a number of Albans and Latins, and even some nobles descended from the Trojans, also took part in it. Discord, however, soon arose between the two brothers, who began to dispute as to which of them was to rule over the new city, and whether it was to be called Boma or Eemoria. Others add that the brothers were not agreed upon the site of the new town ; Eomulus wishing to build it on the Palatine, and Eemus on the Aventine, or on a spot which was four miles further down the river.10 As there was no difference of age between them, and neither was willing to yield, it was left to the gods to decide the point by augury. Eomulus accordingly observed the heavens from the Palatine, and Eemus from the Aventine ; and he whom the gods favoured was to be king, and to give name to the new city. Eemus had the first augury, seeing six vultures flying from north to south. When the tidings of it were brought to Eomulus, he suddenly saw twelve vultures11 flying past him. Eight was on the side of Eemus ; but Eomulus and his party insisted upon the double number of birds as a proof of the divine favour, and Eemus was obliged to yield.12 Eomulus now set about making the sacred inclosure called the pomoerimn,13 according to the custom of the Etruscans.- 10 Serv. ad Virg.

Where a gate was to be made, the plough was carried across the space.14 On the line of the pomoerium the city was inclosed with a wall and a ditch. In the centre of the city a vault was built underground, filled with the firstlings of all natural productions necessary to support human life, and with earth which each of the settlers had brought with him from his own home. This vault was called mundus}1 Eemus, who still felt the wrong that was done to him, leaped in scorn over the low wall, for which insidt he was slain by one Celer, or by his own brother Eomulus, who exclaimed, \" So shall die whoever ventures to leap over my wall.\" But no sooner was the murder committed, than Eomulus was seized with remorse and grief : he rejected all food and every comfort, until the shade of his brother appeared to then foster-father Faustulus, and promised to be reconciled if Eomulus would institute a festival for the souls of the dead. Eomidus not only fulfilled the desire of his brother's shade by instituting the Lemuria,16 but, as a permanent mark of honour to him, he set up a second throne by the side of his own, with the sceptre, crown, and other badges of royalty.1\" The first act of the founder of Eome was the murder of his brother, \u2014 an ominous sign of the position which Eome was des tined to occupy, and of the fate which awaited those who should venture to insult her majesty. When the city was built, it was found that the small number of settlers would be unable to defend themselves against enemies that might attack them ; and in order to increase the population, Eomulus threw the city open to every stranger : freemen and runaway slaves, as well as exiles and criminals, found a welcome reception at Eome.13 But one 14 Hence porta, the name of a gate, was derived from the verb portare, to carry. the year for the souls of the departed.

Romulus, therefore, tried to conclude treaties with the neighbour ing towns, for the purpose of establishing the possibility of legiti mate marriages between his Romans and the women of other states.19 But the offer was treated with dislike and mistrust, and the answers which were brought back were insulting to the Romans. Romulus then resolved upon obtaining by stratagem or force what was denied to his open and honest request. He proclaimed that a festival (the Comualid) was going to be cele brated at Rome, and invited the neighbouring Latins and Sabines to come and witness the solemnities and games. Numbers of strangers, with their wives and children, flocked to Rome, not suspecting the fate which awaited them. The Romans set aside all regard for the laws of hospitality, and for the religious sanctity of the occasion, which should have protected their visitors ; and when all were intently looking upon the games, on a signal being given, the Romans fell upon the strangers, and carried off their women.20 The fear and alarm of the maidens were soon soothed; but their parents and relatives, who had dispersed and taken to flight on the outbreak of the conspiracy, prepared to avenge the wrong by main force. * The inhabitants of Caenina, Crustumerium, and Antemnae, an asylum for these strangers. The asylum itself was shown in later times as a small inclosure. If that place contained all the strangers who took refuge at Rome, their number cannot surely have been very great ; nor can it, in general, be conceived, that the rabble described by Livy and Diony sius should have been very numerous in those early times. The whole story of the asylum probably arose out of the idea of the jus exulandi. See Niebuhr, Hist, of Rome, i. p. 324. 19 Had Rome been regarded in the legend as a colony of Alba, the new settlers would not have been in want of women, for they would have had the connubium, i. e. the right of con tracting legal marriages with Alban and Latin women. 20 The number of the Sabine maidens thus carried off was said to have been thirty, and the thirty curiae were believed to have derived their names from them.

They marched into the Eoman territory; but as they could not agree among themselves, Eomu lus conquered them one after another. Acron, king of Caenina, fell in battle. Eomulus, with his victorious band, returned to Eome, offering the first spolia opima to Jupiter Feretrius. At length the Sabines also rose in arms, and, under their king T. Tatius, marched against Eome, resolved upon humbling the rob bers either by force or si-aud. Unable to resist in the open field, Eomulus kept his Eomans within the walls of the city. Tarpeia, the daughter of Tarpeius, the commander of the Eoman citadel on the Capitoline, as she descended from the hill to draw water, was dazzled by the splendour of the Sabine armour ; and Tatius prevailed upon her, by promising her some of the gold ornaments of the Sabines, to betray her countiy. When the enemy was led to the gate, which was opened to them by Tar peia, they rushed through it, but crushed Tarpeia under the weight of the ornaments she had desired, and she expiated her crime by her death.21 Being now in possession of the Capitoline, the Sabines next tried to storm the city. The Eomans had made a fruitless attempt to recover their citadel, and now prepared to meet the Sabines in the valley between the Palatine and Capito line. They were on the point of being defeated, when Eomulus vowed a temple to the flight-staying Jupiter (Jupiter Stator). The fight continued for a long time with varying success, till at length the Sabine women, anxious to effect a reconciliation between their husbands and fathers, rushed between the combat ants, and brought about a peace.22 Its terms were, that hence forth the two nations should be inseparably united in one state 21 The remembrance of Tarpeia's guilt and her death is still preserved at Rome in popular legends.

This was the first step to the increase of Tome's extent and power. The Sabines now built a new town for themselves on the Capitoline and Quirinal; the former hill being its citadel,- and the residence of king T. Tatius ; while Bomidus continued to dwell on the Palatine. When any affair of importance was to be deliberated, the two kings or their senates met in the plain between the Capitoline and Palatine, which was hence called the comitium. This happy union, however, did not last long ; for, after a few years, T. Tatius was slain at Lavinium, during a solemn sacrifice, by some Laurentines, to whom his kinsmen had offered some wrong, and to whom the Sabine king had refused to afford redress.24 No successor of Tatius was appointed ; and Eomulus, who henceforth was sole king of the Eomans and Sabines, made no attempt to avenge the murder of his colleague. But both the Eomans and Laurentines were visited by a plague, which did not cease until the guilt of both parties had received the punishment it deserved. During the long period which now ensued, until the death of Bomidus, tradition is very meagre; and the events we have on record scarcely suffice to establish the warlike character which fame has at all times ascribed to Eomulus. We hear only of two wars. The first is that against Fidenae, the inhabitants of which had begun to feel uneasy about the growing power of Eome, and had ravaged the Eoman territory. Eomulus, however, put them to flight, and took the town of Fidenae,25 which received 23 Populus Romanus et Quirites, or Populus Romanus Quirites, which was afterwards corrupted into Populus Romanus Quiritium. latter statement however seems to have arisen from a confusion of the Sabines with the plebeians, to whom the Aventine peculiarly belonged. 25 This war against Fidenae is related in almost precisely the same manner as that which occurred about b.c. 457, and is probably nothing but the trans fer of an historical event to the mythical ages. 24 The tomb of T. Tatius was after wards shown on the Aventine hill, where, according to some authorities, the Sabines received settlements from Romulus. (Plut. Romul. 23 ; Varro, in Serv. ad Virg. Aen. vii. 657.) The"], [49, "EXPLANATIONS OF THE LEGEND. 29 a colony. The second war is that against the Etruscans of Veii, who were actuated by the same spirit as the Fidenates. They ravaged the Eoman territory and returned home with their booty; but Eomulus set out and conquered them in an open battle : he drove them back into then- city, but abstained from besieging them ; and, having laid waste their country, he returned to Eome. The humbled enemy sued for peace, which was granted them, on condition of their giving up a part of their territory. A truce was further concluded with them for a period of one hundred years. Eomulus is said to have ruled thirty-seven years; and in the account of his death, the legend again assumes that beautiful and poetical character in which it relates the circumstances of his birth and early life. On the nones of Quintilis, that is, on the day on which the festival of the Quirinalia was celebrated, when the king was reviewing his people in the plain near lake Capra, the sun withdrew his light; and while the earth was covered with darkness, Mars descended in a tempest, and bore his son up to heaven. The people fled in dismay, and when light returned they sought their king in vain ; but then lamentation was changed into rebgious reverence, when they were told by Froculus Julius, that the glorified king had appeared to liim in a vision, and pro mised to watch over his people as the god Quirinus.26 These are the outlines of the traditional story of Eomulus, such as was held sacred at Eome for many centuries ; it was commemorated in poetry, and repeated by successive historians. That such a legend cannot be taken as history, has been felt at all times by those who looked at history with critical eyes ; but the question is, whether any information of real historical value can be derived from it, and in what manner it is to be arrived at. There have been men, in ancient as well as in modern times, who fancied they coidd make history out of any poetical or legendary story, by stripping it of its poetical features, cutting away the supernatural and marvellous, and thus reducing it to a common and intelligible every-day occurrence, as if it had 26 Liv. i. 16 ; Cicero, de Re Publ. i. 41, ii. 8, 9; Ovid. Fast. ii. 475, &c."], [50, "30 HISTORY OF ROME. not been the intention of the authorities thus mutilated to give a marvellous story.\"7 The results of such dull and perverse pro ceedings appear in the story of Romulus in various ways, and may be read in the accounts of Dionysius and Plutarch, who looked upon such critics as sensible men. The she-wolf, who suckled the twins, was thus changed into a woman of the name of Lupa; and the miraculous disappearance of Romulus was made out to have been nothing but an insurrection of the senators, who, having been dissatisfied with the king's rule, in order to get rid of him and take the government into their own hands, are said to have assassinated him, and, from fear of the people, to have spread the report of his having been carried up to heaven. This latter interpretation was probably got up in after-times by the plebeians, who thought the patricians capable of every crime that might fur ther their selfish interests ; but they forgot that in the ancient legend Romulus is nowhere represented as a tyrant. On the con trary, after the death of T. Tatius, whose rule is really described as tyrannical, the reign of Romulus is said to have become more legal and milder than it had been before: he consulted the senate on all matters, and punished the refractory citizens only with fines of cattle ; in short, there is no trace in the story of his having ever been an object of hatred with the senate. The only manner in which we can derive any historical results from national legends, if they have any historical basis, as they have in almost all cases, is to receive them just as they are handed down to us ; not altering or modifying them in any way, but looking steadily at what they state as facts, as well as at what they teach us by implication. It may, indeed, happen, that not one of the facts stated is of any historical value ; but we fre quently catch a glimpse of the state of things, in regard to the political, social, and religious life of the times, to which the traditions refer; and this is pre-eminently the case in early 27 The school of critics here alluded to has not yet quite disappeared; and it is a matter of the highest importance to the young minds of students to be cautioned against it."], [51, "PRIMITIVE ROME. 31 Eoman history. It is, indeed, impossible either to assert or to deny whether Eomulus and Eemus are historical personages or not, whether Eomulus actually did build Eome, or whether he really was the founder of the institutions ascribed to him ; but with regard to the questions as to what Eome was before the dawn of her historical period, how she grew out of her cradle, and what her political and social institutions were, a great deal of information may be gleaned from the traditions. Great assistance may also be derived from the institutions of later times ; for their principles remained on the whole the same, and the changes they experienced were only the results of a natural progress and development. Troceeding on this principle we offer the following observations, which partly complete and partly illustrate the above-mentioned traditions. It was the general belief of the Eomans themselves that Bome, the name of their city, was not Latin ; and that its Latiii name was kept as a sacred secret.23 There existed on the Talatine hill, previous to the time of Eomulus, a Siculian, Pelasgian, or Tyrr henian town, whose name was in all probability Eoma.29 This explains the statement that Eome was a Tyrrhenian place, as well as the foreign appearance of the name of Eoma. All accounts agree in placing the original town of Eome on the Palatine hill, just as the Aborigines dwelt in a number of villages on the neighbouring heights. Its territory was bounded on the Etruscan side by the river Tiber, and on the other sides by the territories of the small towns of the Aborigines ; on the side towards the sea, alone, it extended to any distance.30 Niebuhr supposes that on what was then called the Agonian hill there existed a town, of which the Capitoline might be considered as the citadel. It was inhabited by Sabines, and bore the name of Quirium, whence its citizens were called Quirites, and the Agonian hill afterwards Quirinalis. That the Sabines constituted 28 Macrob.

Tatius, but is evident from the fact that most of the Eoman religious ceremonies were Sabine, and were said to have been introduced by T. Tatius, or Numa Bonrpilius.31 It is well attested that the Sabines had pushed then conquests far down the Tiber, and that the towns of Collatia and Begillum belonged to them, though the surrounding places were in the hands of the Latins.32 The story about the rape of the Sabine women seems to indicate, that at one time there existed no right of intermarriage (connubium) between the towns on the Palatine and Capitoline ; and that the former, which was probably in a state of dependance, raised itself by force of arms to an equality, and even to a preponderance of power. The double character of the Eoman people may be traced in a variety of circumstances, such as the double Janus, the symbol of the double state ;33 the story about the twin brothers, Eomulus and Eemus ; the double throne of Eomulus ; the title of the whole body of Eoman citizens, populus Eomanus Quirites, that is, popidus Eomanus et Quirites ; and in the double number of so many Eoman magis trates. A third element was introduced into the population of Eome, but it was not placed on an equality with the two others till a much later period. Eomulus, the founder of the city, was naturally regarded by posterity as the author of the groundwork of the political con stitution of his new state; just as his successor, Numa Eompilius, was considered as the founder of most of the religious institu tions. Eomulus is thus said to have divided the whole people into three tribes, the Eamnes, Tities, and Luceres ; each tribe again into ten curiae, and each curia into gentes. The original senate, consisting of one hundred members, is also said to have been increased by one hundred others, at the time when the Sabines were united with the Eomans under one state. These traditions 31 Dionys. ii. 50; Liv. i. 33; Varro, \u00e6 Liv. i. 38, ii. 16; Dionys. vi. 40. de Ling. Lat. vi. 74. ed. Miiller. 'a Serv. ad Virg. Aen. i. 291."], [53, "THE TRIBES. 33 require some explanation. The two nations, of which the Roman state consisted, are called tribes, the Ramnes and Tities (or Ramnenses and Titienses), the names of which are universally traced by the ancients to then- respective kings, Romulus and Titus Tatius. Along with these two, a third tribe, the Luceres, is mentioned as early as the time of Romulus ;34 but the ancients are not agreed upon the origin of the name. Most writers derive it from one Lucumo, an Etruscan ally of Romulus, who is said to have fallen in the war against the Sabines ;35 and others from Lucerus, a king of Ardea. According to the former opinion the Luceres would be Etruscans, and according to the latter, Tyrrhenians ; but we believe, with the majority of the ancients, that they were Etruscans, and derived their name from a Lucumo, either Caeles Vibenna or an earlier one.36 The existence of an Etruscan element, in the population of Rome, is also well attested by a number of institutions and religious rites, which are expressly said to have been derived from the Etrus cans. But whatever we may think on this subject, thus much is certain, that for a considerable time the Luceres were in a state of subjection to the other tribes, from which they emerged only by degrees ; though the gradual extension of the full rights of citizenship is scarcely perceptible in the historians whose works we possess, except in then- accounts of the gradual in crease of the number of senators ; for at the time when the Luceres were incorporated with the Roman state, the number of senators was raised to 300, which number afterwards remained unaltered for many centuries. The senators representing the first tribe had, for a time, certain privileges in which those of the second did not participate; and when the Luceres were of the name of thethird tribe, Lucertes, said to occur in Festus (s. v. Luce renses), that they were the inhabitants of a place called Lueer or Lueerunx on the Caelian hill ; and he assumes that they were Latins; but the form Lu certes does not occur in Festus, nor in any other passage that we know ot. 34 Liv.i. 13. 35 He is, perhaps, no other than the Etruscan, Caeles Vibenna, whose title Lucumo was mistaken for a proper name Caeles Vibenna is said to have settled on the Caelian hill, which de rived its name from him. 36 Niebuhr infers from another form c 3"], [54, "34 HISTORY OF ROME. admitted, then- senators, for a long time, were inferior in rank to those of the first two, and were hence called patres minorum gentium, whereas those of the two other tribes were designated as patres majorum gentium, and gave their votes before the senators of the Luceres. Each of the three tribes was divided, for political purposes, into ten curiae ; and each curia constituted a body of citizens, united together by certain religious rites and civil duties. Each had a separate name, said to have been derived from one of the Sabine women, who brought about the reconciliation between the Eomans and Sabines ; and the affairs, especially the religious ones, of each curia were managed by an officer called curio. The thirty curiones formed a college or body of priests, headed by one of then number, who bore the title of curio maximus. Each curia contained a number of gentes. The real nature of the ancient gentes, and their relation to the decads mentioned by Dionysius,37 are among the most difficult points in early Eoman histoiy. Dionysius states that each curia was subdivided into ten decads or decurias ; and Niebuhr, identifying these decads with the gentes, believes that the thirty curies, that is, the whole body of Eoman citizens, consisted of 300 gentes. He further regards the gentes as analogous to the clans of other countries ; and with reference to the definition given by Cicero,33 he maintains that there existed no family affinity between the members of a gens who had only one name in common, and that the gentes were purely political divisions. A gens might, accordingly, contain different families ; as the Cornelia gens, e.g., contained the Scipios and the Sullae. Now it should be ob served in the first place, that the decads mentioned by Diony sius do not occur anywhere else ; and that, whenever the subdi visions of the curiae are spoken of, we hear only of o-entes ; 37 II- 7. a Topic. 6.

Qui capite non sunt diminuti. Hoc fortasse satis est."], [55, "CURIAE AND GENTES. 35 whence we must infer that the decads (decuriae), like the decuriones, had nothing to do with the political division of the Eoman people, but referred only to the organisation of the army. Secondly, Varro39 expressly recognises a family affinity among the members of the same gens. The fact of different families appearing in the same gens, in later times, does not prove that the same was also the case originally, considering the great changes that must have taken place by intermarriages, so that, in the end, it became a matter of impossibility for any par ticular individual to trace his origin to the earliest times, and he was accordingly satisfied with the gentile name, which had become the main requisite. Each gens had its sacra privata, which also seems to indicate that it was not a mere political body, like the curiae ; else it would, like the latter, have had its sacra publica. The supposition, that the number of gentes was limited to 300, thus seems to fall to the ground : it is irre concilable also with the fact, that when strangers were admitted among the gentes, as the Julii, Servilii, Quintii, Geganii, and others, they retained their gentile names and formed new gentes ; whereas, if they had been incorporated with other gentes, they would have been obliged to give up their own names, and to take those of the gentes into winch they were introduced. The three tribes and then subdivisions (the curiae and gentes) contained the whole body of Eoman citizens; and besides them there existed, in the earliest times, no one that could be truly called a Eoman citizen. They constituted the sovereign people, and were the populus, populus Eomanus, patres or patricii. The plebeians, as a distinct order, did not exist in those times. But along with those real citizens there occur two other classes of persons, viz., slaves, as in all the states of antiquity, and clientes.\" The latter formed a class of people altogether pecu- 39 Be Ling.

There is no perfect analogy in the whole range of ancient history with these Italian clientes. They formed a body of people who had fewer rights than those contained in the curiae and gentes : they stood in a relation of strict dependance on the free citizens; not indeed as a body on the body of Eoman citizens; but as individuals, one or more being attached to a particular gens or family.41 They appear in Eoman story from the very earliest times; but the question as to their origin can only be answered by a conjecture, being beyond the reach of historical investigation. It is, however, probable that they were the original inhabitants of those countries, who being subdued by the new settlers and having lost their landed property, continued to live in a state of submission to then new lords, and retained pieces of land for cultivation, which however were the property of the conquerors.42 The nature of this clientela is sufficiently indicated by the term patronus (from pater), the title of the person to whom a client was attached. The relation of the clientela descended from father to son, and involved hereditary rights and duties : it was of peculiar sanctity, and analogous to the relation existing between a father and his children ; nay, it is expressly stated that the clients had higher claims on then- patron than Iris own relatives.43 The duties of the patron, as well as of the client, are stated by Dionysius :44 the patron had to expound the law to his clients ; to protect their property and interests, just as those of his own children ; to defend them against any unlawful attacks ; to represent them in the courts of justice ; and in general to afford them every pro tection both in public and private affairs. The client, in return, wis obliged to support his patron on many occasions : thus, he 41 Dionys. ii. 46, v. 40, x. 14; Liv. ii. 16. tled at Rome under the protection of certain Roman citizens, who became their patrons. 43 Cato, in Gellius, v. 13. 44 Dionys. ii. 10. 42 It may also be that the clients were strangers who did not belong to any of the three tribes, and who set-"], [57, "37 THE CLIENTS. had to contribute towards the dowry of his patron's daughter, if the patron himself had not sufficient means ; and if the patron or any of his sons had been made prisoner of war, the clients had to pay the ransom for him. A like assistance was expected from the client on many other occasions. He belonged, of course, to the gens of his patron, and accordingly bore the same gentile name. Neither of the two was allowed to come forward as accuser of the other, to bear witness against him, or to vote against him. It is further frequently mentioned that the clients accompanied their patrons in war.45 The patron who was guilty of a crime against his client was devoted to the infernal gods : he was outlawed, and any one might kill him ; and severe punishments awaited him even in the lower world.46 It was the pride of illustrious Eoman families to have a great number of clients. Commerce and trade seem to have been the principal means from which the clients derived their means of subsistence. The nature of the ancient clientela, however, in the course of time became completely altered; and at the time when the ple beians had raised themselves to an equality with the patricians, the ancient relation must have ceased altogether : it appears gradually to have passed over into that kind of clientela, which we find at Eome during the latter period of the republic, and which is the same as the relation between an advocate or legal adviser and his client, in the modern sense of the term. We defer speaking of the plebeians till the time when they appear in history as a distinct order, and as opposed to the patricians. Our authorities speak of plebeians as early as the time of Boniulus ; and Dionysius confounds them with the clients, who may in some respects be regarded as the plebeians of those early times, but are by no means identical with the later order of plebeians. We do not, however, mean to deny that there existed, even in the time of Eomulus, the elements of 4S Dionys. vi. 47, vii. 19. 46 Serv. ad Virg.

NUMA POMPILIUS AND HIS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS \u2014 TULLUS HOSTILIUS. After the disappearance of Eomulus, the senate, being de sirous of getting the reins of government into its own hands, would not allow a new king to be elected ; and for a whole year every senator enjoyed the regal power in rotation under the title of interrex. But in the end the people grew tired of this state of things, being more severely oppressed by these many riders than they had before been by one; and they became vehement in insisting upon the right to elect a sovereign to protect them. The senate yielded, in order not to lose in the end even more than what was now demanded ; and they permitted that a king should be elected by the people subject to the approval of the senate. But the Eomans and Sabines now began to dispute from which of the two tribes the king should be taken : it was at length agreed that the Eomans should choose him out of the Sabines. All concurred in electing the Sabine, Nmna Pompilius of Cures, who was famed far and wide for his wisdom and piety, having been a disciple of the Greek sage Pythagoras.1 When he had consulted the auguries, and assured himself that the gods approved of his election, his first care was turned to 1 Most ancient writers, as Polybius, Livy, and Dionysius, seeing the chro nological impossibility of this state ment, since Pythagoras lived nearly two centuries after the time assigned to Numa, endeavour to show that the mistake arose out of a confusion of the philosopher Pythagoras with a later person of the same name. But it should be remembered that the story about Numa is altogether legen dary, and as such sets chronology at complete defiance. It may further be observed, that the historical existence of Numahimself is more than doubtful; and that a connection between the king and the Greek philosopher was believed at Rome for many centuries.

He concluded peace and treaties with the surrounding states, and divided among the people the lands which Boniulus had conquered, and which yet remained un occupied. In connection with this distribution of landed pro perty, he instituted the worship of Terminus, the protector of boundaries, who was to watch over the seciu-ity of property. \u2022 After having thus bestowed due care upon human affairs, he set about legislating for religion, thinking that his people, who had no longer to fear any foreign enemy, would be best and most effectually ruled over by instilling fear of the gods into then minds. He acted under the guidance and instructions of the Cameua Egeria, who was married to him in a mortal form, and with whom he had secret interviews in a sacred grove. As a preliminary step to his religious legislation, he undertook the regulation of the year ; and by adding to the Bomulian year of ten months the January of 29, and February of 28 days, he made out a lunar year consisting of twelve months, or 355 days.2 He also fixed the days on which public business might be trans acted, and those wliich were to be set apart for religious purposes. After these things he regulated the whole of the Eoman hierarchy, or the different priestly colleges, and all the religious affairs of the state. He instituted the flamines, or priests of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, to minister in the temples of these great divinities ; the chaste vestal virgins; the twelve Salii of Mars Gradivus, who worshipped the god with songs and dances in armour ; the pontiffs, to whose keeping were intrusted the written instructions about sacred rites, sacrifices, temples, religious days, and the means of defraying the expenses of all things connected with religion: he further placed under their superintendence all things 2 In order to make this year har monise with the solar one of 365 days, he is said to have inserted every other year an intercalary month (Merce donius), alternately of 22 and 23 days.

The augurs also, are said to have been instituted by him : it was their duty to explore by augury the will of the gods, for the purpose of giuding the counsels of men. Numa himself knew the means of compelling Jupiter to make known his will by lightning or the flight of birds. The incantation or charm by which he effected this, he had learned from Faunus and Picus, whom, by the advice of Egeria, he enticed and bound in chains. He also built numerous temples and altars to the gods. Amid these pious works the reign of Numa glided away in quiet happiness, and without any war or other calamity; for even the neighbouring people, who had before looked upon Eome as though it were an enemy's camp, were so overawed by these pious proceedings, that they did not venture to undertake any thing against a city so completely devoted to the worship of the gods. The temple of Janus, which was Numa's work, was closed during the whole of his reign, for peace extended over Eome and all its neighbourhood. After a reign of forty-three years3 (from B.C. 715 to 673) Numa, the favourite of the gods, died full of years.4 The legend of Numa Pompilius, though not without some highly poetical features, does not seem to have been the theme of an ancient epic : he is said indeed to have enjoined that among all the Camenae the highest honours should be paid to Tacita.5 As Eomulus had been the son of a god, and in the end became a god himself, so Numa was closely connected with divine beings ; his story is as much a poetical fiction as that of Bomidus, if not more so ; and the number of years assigned to their reigns arose either from numerical speculations of the priests who kept the annals of the kingdom, or from mere caprice or 3 Polybius (ap. Cic. de Re Pull. ii. 14) assigned to him a reign of only 39 years, and others make it last 41 years.

Eomulus and Numa Pompilius, therefore, stand quite apart from the remaining five kings : the former are gods or demigods ; whereas the historical existence of the latter cannot reasonably be doubted, though the detail of the accounts about them, and the duration of then- several reigns, cannot be re garded as history. The account we have of the election of Numa seems to indicate, that it had been adopted as a principle by the two nations, of which the Eoman people consisted, that the king should be elected alternately from the Eamnes and Tities, and by one tribe out of the other ; but that after the death of Eomulus, the Eamnes at first refused to adhere to the regulation ; just as Eomulus liimself, after the death of T. Tatius, would not allow a successor to be appointed. This alternation continued in the case of the two successors of Numa ; Tullus Hostilius being a Eamnes, and Ancus Marcius a Sabine. All the principal religious institutions of Eome were referred in the Eoman legends to Numa as their founder, just as the main features of the political constitution were traced to Eomu lus. The religion of the Eomans, however, was surely not the work of one man : all that a king whom the legend calls Numa can have done, was to regulate the elements he found, and to reduce the outward religious forms and observances to a system. The Eoman religion was neither exclusively Latin, nor Sabine, nor Etruscan, but contained elements of all three, though the Sabine seems to have been predominant ; and Numa did nothing but reduce the heterogeneous mass. The worship of Vesta, for example, had existed at Alba Longa even before the time of Eomulus ; and the science of the augurs, which is known to have been derived from the Etruscans, was applied by Eomulus, who is even said by Cicero6 to have appointed three augurs : in like manner it is certain that the curiones, whom Dionysius mentions among the colleges of priests instituted by Numa, must have existed as long as the curiae themselves, whose religious repre sentatives they were ; and the two flamines of Jupiter and Mars 6 Be Re Publ. ii. 14."], [63, "RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. 43 are said, in some traditions, to have been appointed by Eomulus.7 That, therefore, is nothing but a pleasing fiction, which referred the establishment of the Eoman hierarchy, and the ceremonial law, such as it existed hi later times, to one of the semi-divine kings, who was encouraged and assisted in his work by the goddess Egeria ; for a well-informed Eoman must have been aware that Numa did not establish any worship that was absolutely new, but that he only regulated and reduced to a system that which he found existing among his own subjects, and among the neighbouring people. The institution of the several colleges of priests, with a view to insure the observance of religious duties, and the number of the members of each college, were closely connected with the number of the tribes ; and we perceive from these numbers that the institutions of Numa had reference only to two tribes, the Eamnes and Tities, the Luceres either not existing at that time, or not being taken into consideration in his religious legislation. Thus there were four augurs, two for each tribe ; two vestals, one for each tribe ; four pontiffs (not including the pontifex maximus), two for each tribe ; and twenty feeiales, or judges of international law, that is, one for every curia of the first two tribes. The Eoman hierarchy, although it exercised a most powerful influence upon all matters of public interest, yet could never acquire that independent and overwhelming power which was possessed by the priesthood among the Egyptians, Chaldaeans, and other nations of antiquity ; for the priests did not form a distinct and privileged caste of persons. The private worship was left to the care of every head of a family, and the pubbc sacra were under the immediate care of the curiones or presi dents of the curiae : all the Eoman magistrates were connected \u25a0with certain priestly rights and functions ; and the king himself was the high priest of the nation : the pontiffs, augurs, and other priests, again, might at the same time be invested with civil offices : in short, all the ecclesiastical institutions were most 7 Plut. Numa, 7."], [64, "44 HISTORY OF ROME. closely connected with the civil government ; and the religion of the Eomans was pre-eminently a political or state religion. The main objects of worship among the Eomans were the various powers and manifestations of nature : hence their whole religious system must be called a theology, rather than a mythology, such as we find among the Greeks. For a period of 170 years, the Eomans are said to have worshipped then gods without any images ; and it was not till the time of Tarquinius Priscus, who was initiated in the Samothracian mysteries, that statues of Juno and Minerva were erected.s But after that time the re ligion and mythology of Greece gradually became mixed up with that of the Eomans ; for the latter, like most nations of antiquity, did not look upon the gods of foreign nations with disdain or contempt : they respected the gods and religious cere monies of other countries ; and in most cases they recognised hi foreign gods and rites only modifications of those to which they themselves had been accustomed ; and, guided by such feelings, they very frequently contrived to make out that foreign gods were the same as then own.9 This peculiarity is the source of great confusion in the history of the Eoman religion; for the Eomans in later times not unfrequently forgot the meaning and import of their own ancient divinities, having been in the habit of transferring to them all the attributes that were given to the Greek gods with whom they were identified. It must at the same time be observed in honour of the Eomans, that licentious and orgiastic mysteries, such as we meet with in Greece, were at all times held in abomination ; and that whenever attempts were made to introduce them, they were energetically suppressed by the state. The great historian Polybius10 remarks, that the 3 Varro, ap. Plut. Numa, 8; Au gustin. de Civ. Bei, iv. 31 ; Macrob.

The interreign (interregnum) which followed after the death of Numa Pompilius w-as of short duration ; the senate and interrex chose Tullus Hostilius, who belonged to the Eamnes, for their king ; and his election was approved of by the curiae. He is de scribed as unlike his predecessor, and even as more warlike and ferocious than Eomulus. The accounts which have come down to us of his reign seem to partake more of the character of real history than those of his two predecessors ; although the fight of the Horatii and Curiatii, and the destruction of Alba, are undoubtedly poetical legends, and were the themes of poems of which an echo is still perceptible in the narrative of Livy. The city of Alba wholly disappears from the legends as soon as Eome is built, and for a period of upwards of eighty years we hear nothing about her, until at the beginning of the reign of Tullus Hostilius a war is said to have been called forth between Eome and Alba by mutual violence. The inhabitants of the two little kingdoms had ravaged each other's territories, and it so happened that embassies were sent by both parties at the same time to de mand reparation. Alba was at the time governed by C. Cluibus. The Boman king who wished for war, and was anxious to have the appearance of justice on his side, detained the Alban am bassadors by feasts and banquets ; whereas the Eoman envoys were ordered to demand satisfaction immediately on their arrival at Alba. The atonement was refused, as Tullus had anticipated, and war was declared against Alba. Both parties made the necessary preparations ; and the Albans began to march into the Eoman territory. They encamped in a place not far from Bome, and surrounded themselves with a ditch called the fossa Cluilia, after then- king C. Cluihus who died in the camp. The Albans then appointed Mettius Fuffetius dictator in his place. Tullus, encouraged by the king's death, and eager to attack the"], [66, "46 HISTORY OF ROME. enemy, marched past the Alban camp, and invaded the enemy's territory. Mettius, following the Romans as quickly as he could, sent a message to Tullus requesting an interview before the battle commenced. The two armies were drawn up over against each other, and when the two chiefs had advanced and met in the space between their armies, they came to an agreement to avert the battle by a combat. There happened to be in each army three brothers of the same age and strength, the Horatii on the side of the Romans, and the Curiatii on that of the Albans;11 and these brothers were chosen to decide the issue of the war by a combat. A solemn treaty was concluded on these terms, that the nation, whose champions should win the victory, should be regarded as the conqueror, and should rule over the other in peace. The three champions now came forward on both sides ; and the two armies looked on with the most anxious expectation, seeing that their respective sovereignties were at stake. Two of the Horatii were soon slain; but the remaining one was unhurt, while all the three Curiatii were wounded. The surviving Horatius was too prudent to continue the contest against the three Albans at once : he therefore took to flight ; and the Albans followed him, each as well as the state of his wounds permitted. When the Roman, on looking back, perceived that they were following him at intervals, he suddenly turned round, and conquered them one after another. This glorious victory of their champion filled the Romans with delight, and the Albans submitted to their fate.12 The Albans were ordered by Tullus to remain in arms, as he was likely soon to be obliged to make use of them against another enemy : the Romans then returned home. Horatius marched at the head of the army, carrying the spoils of the Curiatii in triumph. When he arrived at the gate of the city, historical foundation.

Horatius, em-aged at her conduct on an occasion so glorious for himself and so fortunate for the state, ran her through with his sword. The king at first hesitated what to do with the man who was at once the murderer of his sister and the saviour of the state ; but his sense of justice prevailed, and he appointed duumviri perduellionis to try him. Horatius was sentenced to be hanged ; but he appealed to the people, who acquitted him, moved as they were by the thought of what he had done for his country, and by the entreaties of his father who justified his conduct.13 The peace between Eome and Alba, however, did not last long ; for the Albans, who keenly felt the loss they had sustained, and yet despaired of success in an open revolt, excited other towns to war with a view of treacherously assisting to defeat Eome, and thus to recover their independence. An oppor tunity was soon offered; for Fidenae, which had been con quered by Boniulus, revolted, and with the assistance of the Veientines, expelled the Eoman colonists. Tullus Hostilius, joined by Mettius Fuffetius and the Albans, set out against the enemy. The armies were drawn up in such a manner that the Eomans faced the Veientines, and the Albans the Fidenates. Mettius, who was as cowardly as he was faithless, gradually led away his men from the conflict towards the hills, and there drew them up in battle array, intending to join the party that should be victorious. Tullus, who saw his conduct, and feared lest it should discourage his Eomans, declared that Mettius acted by his command. The Fidenates, alarmed by what they heard, and dreading an attack of the Albans upon their flanks, 13 The forms of the proceedings at this trial, as well as the ceremonies observed in the declaration of the war against Alba (Liv. i. 26 and 24), were, in all probability, taken by Livy from very ancient documents, the books of the pontiffs and augurs, and are genuine ancient formularies."], [68, "48 HISTORY OF ROME. took to flight. Tullus pursued them, and then turned with all his might against the Veientines, who were likewise put to flight : as they had to cross the Tiber, most of them were cut to pieces on its banks, or perished in the waters.14 The Albans now descended into the plain, and congratulated Tullus on his victory. He pretended to be unaware of their trea cherous design, and invited them to a solemn sacrifice on the next day. At sunrise, the Albans came without their arms: on a given signal the Eomans surrounded them; and Tullus announced to them that then dictator, for the faithlessness he had shown in the hour of danger, shoidd be torn in pieces by horses driven two opposite ways, that their city shoidd be razed to the ground, and that the Albans should be carried to Eome. This sentence was forthwith carried into execution ; the Albans being compelled to quit their city, which was completely destroyed, with the exception of the temples of the gods. The fall of Alba doubled the power of Eome. Tullus assigned to the homeless Albans settlements on the Caelian hill, a part of which was aheady occupied by Etruscan settlers. Then number is said to have been equal to that of the Eomans. The noble Alban gentes, such as the Julii, Servilii, Quintii, Geganii, Curiatii, and Cloelii, were added to the Eoman gentes, and retained their original names.15 The great bulk of the Alban people formed the first element of the Eoman plebs, of which we shall speak pre sently. The Eoman army, both the infantry and cavalry, was increased by this augmentation of the Eoman population. The fall of Alba itself must be looked upon as an historical fact ; but the whole account of its destruction appears to be no less fabulous than the story about the destruction of Troy. Accord ing to the Italian law of nations, the territory of Alba woidd 14 Livy does not say that Tullus pursued the Veientines any further, but from a statement of Varro (ap. Pest. s. v.

But see above, p. 33."], [69, "TULLUS HOSTILIUS. 49 have belonged to the conquerors, but we find it in the possession of the Lathis for a long time afterwards ; 16 whence we must infer that Alba was either taken by the united forces of the Romans and Latins, and that they divided the territory of the conquered between themselves ;17 or that the Latins alone destroyed Alba without any participation of the Romans, and that some of the Albans who took refuge at Rome, received settlements there as refugees. After the destruction of Alba, a war broke out with the Sabines, who, next to the Etruscans, were the most powerful nation of Italy. The war arose from offences committed by the two nations against each other. The Sabines were joined by some Veientines, though the state of Veii took no part in the war. Tullus was the first to invade the enemy's territory, and a fierce battle was fought, in which the Sabines were worsted. After this war Dionysius18 speaks of one with the Latins, which Livy passes over in silence. Fifteen years after the destruction of Alba, Tullus, it is said, claimed the same supremacy over the Latin towns which had formerly belonged to Alba. Hereupon the Latins assembled in their usual place, near the well of Ferentina, and decreed not to yield to the pretensions of the Romans. The war which now ensued, and lasted for five years, consisted chiefly of ravages made in the enemy's country. Medullia was the only town that was taken, and a peace was then concluded with the Latins. In this manner the reign of Tullus Hostilius was an uninter rupted series of successes, until the anger of the gods, whose worship had been neglected at Rome, and destroyed at Alba, was manifested by a shower of stones on the Alban mount, and other prodigies ; and not long after a pestilence also broke out. 16 Liv. i. 50, vii. 25. neralsfrom the Latin towns of Anagnia and Tusculum protected Rome while Tullus was engaged in the siege of Veii. 17 The existence of an alliance between Rome and the Latins, in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, is attested by Livy (i. 32) and Varro (ap. Fest. s. v. Septimontio) who states that ge- 18 III. 34. D"], [70, "50 HISTORY OF ROME. The king's health and spirits began to sink, and in despondence he gave himself up to restless superstition. His example had its effect upon the people, who joined him in his religious ob servances. As the gods persisted in their silence, and refused sending any sign to reveal the means of propitiating then anger, Tullus considted the books of Numa, and finding in them certain mysterious rites which had been performed by Numa to Jupiter Elicius, he withdrew into solitude, and attempted to compel Jupiter to send him a sign. But, owing to some oversight in the perilous conjuration, or to the wrath of the gods, Jupiter killed him by a flash of Hghtning, winch at the same time de stroyed his house and all his family. He is said to have reigned 32 years, that is, from B.C. 673 to 642. After the death of Tullus Hostilius, the people, assembled in their curi\u00e6 under the presidency of an interrex, sanctioned the election of Ancus Marcius, a son of Nnma's daughter, and consequently belonging to the tribe of the Tities, as their king. Mindful of his grandfather's example, he endeavoured to restore the religious observances which had been instituted by Numa, but which had fallen into neglect imder his successor. He accordingly ordered the chief pontiff (pontifex maximus) to tran scribe the ceremonial law from the books of Numa on whited tables, which were set up in public, that all might become acquainted with the religious law. But with this pious disposi tion Ancus combined that degree of wariike spirit which was required for Eome, surrounded as she was by jealous and envious tribes. The Latins, who had concluded a peace with Tullus, began to look for better success against a king of apparently a most peaceful character ; they accordingly rose in arms and invaded his dominions. The Eomans demanded reparation, but when this was haughtily refused, war was declared against them and Ancus, leaving the care of religion to the priests, led his army against the Latins. Their towns do not appear to have acted in perfect concert; for Ancus took the towns of Politorium, Tellen\u00e6, and Ficana, and carried then inhabitants to Eome, where"], [71, "ANCUS MARCIUS. 51 he assigned to them the Aventine hill. At length all the Latins assembled in the neighbourhood of Medullia, and made despe rate efforts against their common enemy. For some time the victory seemed doubtful, but at length Ancus gained it in a hard fought battle, and returned to Eome with immense booty. Many thousands of Latins were again carried to Eome, where the king assigned to them the districts between the Aventine and Pala tine. He further incorporated with the city the hill Janiculum, as a bulwark against Etruria, and built the first wooden bridge (pom sublicius) across the Tiber. On the Eoman side of the river he made the ditch of the Quirites as a protection of those parts of the city which were low and exposed.19 As with the immense increase of the population crimes also became more frequent, he built a fearful prison in the heart of the city, on the side of the hill above the forum.20 Ancus, however, not only extended, improved, and secured the city itself, but increased the Eoman territory in various directions ; thus, he took a district from the Veientines, and extended his kingdom as far as the sea-coast. At the mouth of the Tiber he built the town of Ostia, the most ancient Eoman colony, and the port of Bome ; and in its neigh bourhood salt-works were established, from which the state de rived a revenue (vectigal). He reigned for a period of twenty four years (from B.C. 641 to 617), and was not inferior to any of his predecessors, either in the arts of peace or of war. The reigns of Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius are of the greatest importance in Eoman history ; for the population of the Latin towns conquered by these kings, and carried to Eome, formed the elements of the plebeian order, to which Eome owes her greatness and power, and to whose struggles for freedom and independence Eoman history owes its peculiar charm and 19 This ditch was probably a con tinuation of the fossa Cluilia and the same as the modern Man-ana.

When we read in Livy, that the population of Alba and the other Latin towns conquered by Ancus Marcius were trans planted to Eome, we cannot compare such a transplantation with those which we read of in the history of Bersia ; for the districts assigned to them at Eome woidd have been far too small to con tain the immense number of new settlers. The Italian law with regard to conquered land was this : the territory of a conquered enemy became the property of the Eoman state, that is, ager pub licus. One portion of it was used for the purpose of esta blishing colonies, another was given back to the original pro prietors, and a third was left unoccupied, to be either parcelled out among the Eoman citizens, or left as a precarious tenure to those who chose to cultivate it and pay a certain small rent for it to the state. Now if all the Latins and Albans had been transplanted to Eome, most of them would have found it impossible at such a distance to cultivate the farms that were given them by the state. We therefore conceive, that the trans plantation of these large numbers of Latins means only, that the Eomans allowed the conquered people to take up their abode, if they chose to do so, on the Caelian hill, the Aventine, and the valley between the Aventine and Palatine. By far the greater ma jority, unquestionably, did not remove to Eome, but remained on then farms. We have seen above that the noble Alban gentes were placed on an equality with the Eoman gentes, and added to them; but the great mass of the Latins, although they were incorpo rated with the Eoman state, and thus became Eomans, yet formed a body quite distinct from the populus, (the Eomans con tained in the three tribes and thirty curiae), and were designated by the name plebs or plehes. Our authorities, Livy and Dio nysius, who were completely misguided by the meaning attached to the term plebs in their own days, conceived the plebeians to have been a low populace, which had been separated even by Eomulus from the better part of the community. But this, with many other errors which had been established in Eoman history, has been triumphantly and for ever refuted by Niebuhr,"], [73, "THE PLEBES. 53 whose great and peculiar merit it is, to have explained the true nature of the plebeian estate, and its relation to the patricians. The first plebeians, then, we repeat it, consisted of the conquered Albans and other Latin towns, who after their reduction became incorporated with the Boman state. They became Eomans, but not Eoman citizens in the proper sense of the word. Being ex cluded from the tribes and curiae, they had no right of voting in the assembly of the populus, could take no part in the manage ment of public affairs, were not eligible to any magistracy, and had no right of contracting legal marriages (i. e., they had no connubium) with the citizens contained in the tribes and curiae. These constituted the sovereign people ; while the plebeians were indeed free and personally independent, but politically inferior to the populus. The Eomans contained in the three tribes hence forth form a class of nobles under the name ot patres, patricii, or populus, hi contradistinction from the plebs. The plebeians, whose large numbers constituted the principal part of the Eoman armies, and who had to shed then blood for then new country, were in no way inferior to the Eomans : they were Latins like the Eamnes, the oldest and noblest tribe of the Eomans ; but they had had the misfortune to be conquered. All this the plebeians felt ; and as oppression and tyranny on the part of the patricians gradually roused the oppressed to a contest with their oppressors, which lasted for centuries, they present one of the noblest spectacles in the history of mankind, till in the end their perseverance suc ceeded in placing them on a footing of perfect equality with the patricians. The Aventine was at all times regarded as the peculiar habita tion of the plebeians, and as such it was not included in the pomoerium. King Ancus Marcius was revered by the plebeians as the founder of their estate, and was believed to have framed their original laws, just as those of the three patrician tribes were regarded as the work of Bomidus. He is even said to have distributed the conquered land, which had become public domain,"], [74, "54 HISTORY OF ROME. among the people,-21 and the plebeians of later times seem to have looked upon him as the first that ever distributed public land among the members of then order. Hence Ancus Marcius was regarded by them as the good old king ;22 while Virgil, in his partiality for the patricians, charges him with having courted popular favour.23 21 Cic. de Re Publ. ii. 18. 22 Ennius, Annul, iii. p. 107, ed.

The period of Eoman history which begins with the reign of Tarquinius Triscus shows us a state of things very different from what it was under the preceding kings: the little state, which under Ancus Marcius embraced only a very small tract of country in the immediate neighbourhood of Eome, now appears as a powerful monarchy ruling far and wide, and with the means of constructing architectural works which in grandeur and dura bility rival those of the Egyptian Fharaohs. Now, if the state under Ancus Marcius really was as small and insignificant as it is described by our authorities, a long period of growth and de velopment must have followed, before it could have become what it appears to have been under Tarquinius Triscus. But of such a period of growth and development there is no trace in the ancient historians : they represent Tarquinius as the immediate successor of Ancus Marcius ; and we must therefore either sup pose that they passed over that period in silence for want of materials to fill it up ; or we must look for the cause of the in consistency in the nature of the legendary traditions, by means of which the history of those early ages was handed down to pos terity. Toetical legends are not bound to strict historical com pleteness : they may leave unnoticed a whole series of events in their proper place, merely because those events present nothing that is capable of poetical embellishment; and hence, when we afterwards behold a state of things which has become completely altered, without being informed by what means it was brought about, we are naturally surprised, until we remember the omission"], [76, "56 HISTORY OF ROME. or gap that may exist in the legends. Thus it may have been that the reign of Tullus Hostilius, and still more so that of Ancus Marcius, was much richer in great events than it appears from the narratives of Livy and Dionysius. This view of the case derives considerable support from the fact, that the traditions concerning the latter part of Tullus Hostilius's reign, and the whole of that of Ancus, are extremely meagre, and present scarcely any poetical features. We therefore infer, either that the events of that period were not the themes of poems, or that if they were, their substance as well as their form is lost ; and thus it is that when we enter upon the history of Tarquinius Triscus, which, down to the battle of Lake Begillus in b.c. 499, is full of poetry, we find ourselves transported, as it were, into a new world. The lay of Tarqiunius Triscus runs as follows : \u2014 In the reign of Ancus Marcius, an Etruscan Lucumo,1 a wealthy, enterprising and ambitious man, a son of Demaratus of Corinth, emigrated from the Etruscan town of Tarquinii to Eome, hoping there to acquire honours and distinction ; for being a foreigner, every avenue to honour was closed against him at Tarquinii. Dema ratus the father was a member of the obgarchic family of the Bacchiadae at Corinth ; but during the struggles with the demo cratic party headed by Cypselus, being obliged like many others, to quit his country, he had taken up his residence at Tarquinii in Etruria, where as a merchant he had previously formed connexions of friendship. He is said to have been ac companied by celebrated Greek artists,2 and to have taught the Etruscans alphabetical writing.3 He married an Etruscan woman, who bore him two sons, Lucumo and Aruns. Lucumo survived his father, and inherited all his large property. Aruns died before his father, leaving behind him a son called Egerius. 1 Lucumo is commonly regarded by the ancient historians as a proper 2 Plin. Hist.

When they arrived on the top of the Janiculum, an eagle earned away Lucumo's hat ; and, having for a while soared high in the air, descended again, and replaced the hat on his head. Tanaquil understood the sign, and rejoiced at it. They took up their abode at Eome, where they were welcomed ; and Lucumo, on being admitted to the rights of citizenship, changed his name into Lucius Tarquinius, to which Livy adds the surname Triscus. His wealth, the splen dour in which he lived, and his condescension and affability, soon acquired for him the favour of the people. His reputation even reached the ears of the king, who drew him to his court, formed an intimate friendship with him, and not only consulted him upon all matters of importance, but in his will appointed him guardian of his sons. When Ancus Marcius died, his sons were near the age of maturity : Tarquinius, who himself coveted the throne, took care that the people should elect a successor as soon as possible ; and on the day of election he contrived to keep his wards at a distance, occupied with the chase. Tarquinius himself came forward as a candidate for the crown ; and after having harangued the people, he was unanimously elected their king. Of the changes which Tarquinius Triscus made in the consti tution we shall speak presently, and shall first direct our atten tion to the wars he had to carry on. Dionysius, who evidently follows very late authorities, gives minutely detailed accounts of these wars ; but they are of little or no historical value, and are frequently at variance with the brief and more dignified account of Livy, both in regard to the order of the wars and the events of each. According to Livy, it was the Latins that made the first obstinate but unsuccessful attempt to resist the growing power of Eome. Appiolae, one of their towns, was taken by force \u2022 D 3"], [78, "58 HISTORY OF ROME. and Tarquinius, who carried away great booty, celebrated more splendid games than any of his predecessors had ever done. He marked out the space of the Circus Maximus, and instituted the Great or Eoman games sludi magni or Romani), which were afterwards celebrated every year. He further distributed the places around the forum among those who were inclined to sur round it with porticoes, stalls, or booths; and he even formed the plan of inclosing the whole city with a stone wall. But this scheme was prevented by a war with the Sabines, who suddenly crossed the Anio, and invaded his kingdom. After having driven them back to their camp, Tarquinius increased the number of his cavalry, and then began the war afresh. By the bravery of his army, no less than by stratagems, he gained a brilliant victory over the Sabines, great numbers of whom perished in the Anio. He then pursued his enemies into their own country ; and when they were beaten a second time, they sued for peace. Collatia and all its territory was taken from them ; and Tarquinius, returning to Eome in triumph, built the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, which he had vowed during the battle.4 His victory in this war is ascribed to his having doubled the number of his cavalry, in conformity with which measure, he wished also to double the number of the centuries of equites,\" and to name the three new centuries after himself and Ms fi-iends. Attus Navius, the most famous augur of the time, opposed the plan, declaring that no change of the kind could be made without the sanction of the gods. Tarquinius, who appears to have had no great regard for the prophetic powers of his opponent, and wanted either to test his powers or to put him to shame, demanded of the augur to discover whether what he was thinking of at the moment was fea- 4 Some attribute the building of this temple to Tarquinius Superbus. 5 Romulus is said to have esta blished three centuries of equites, the Ramnenses, Titienses, and Luceres, each consisting of 100 men. Tullus Hostilius doubled the number of equi- tes contained in each centuria, leav ing however their number (three) unchanged ; so that Tarquinius found the three equestrian centuries still existing, but each consisting of 200 equites."], [79, "TARQUINIUS PRISCUS. 59 sible or not. Attus Navius, after consulting the auguries, answered that the king's thoughts were feasible ; and Tarquinius held out to him a whetstone and a razor, requesting him to split the stone with the razor, which the augur did, to the amazement of all who witnessed it. This proof of the truth of augury, and the power of his opponent, had such an influence upon the king, that he abandoned his scheme, and henceforth undertook nothing without consulting the will of the gods by augury. He was thus obliged to content himself with doubling the number of equites contained in the three equestrian centuries, which now accordingly contained 1200 equites. The 600 new eqmtes were called posteriores or secunii, and the 600 old ones prior es or primi. After the war with the Sabines, Tarquinius was involved in another with the Latins, who, as usual, were not agreed among themselves; and he was thus enabled to conquer their towns one after another. In this manner he subdued all Latium, and de stroyed or reduced to submission the towns of Cormculum, Ficulea, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and No mentum. Feace was then concluded with the Latins. This is all that Livy relates of the military engagements of Tarquinius ; but Dionysius and Cicero6 also speak of a war with the Aequians, who were already a most powerful people, but were subdued by Tarquinius.7 Dionysius further relates that after the peace with the Sabines, the twelve Etruscan cities south of the Apennines united then forces against Eome ; that after a defeat, which they sustained at Eretum, they submitted, and recognised Tarquinius as their sovereign ; and that they did homage to him by presenting him with the ensigns of royalty, which he displayed in his triumph over them. If we put together the results of his wars, Tarquinius in the evening of his days must have been the acknowledged sovereign of the Sabines, Latins, and Etruscans.8 This great extent of the kingdom of Bome is not mentioned 6 De Re Publ. ii. 20. 1 Compare Strab. v. p. 231. Livy, i. 55, ascribeB the war against the Aequians to the second Tarquinius. 8 Dionys. iii. 57 ; Floras, i. 5."], [80, "60 HISTORY OF ROME. either by Livy or Cicero ; but whatever we may think of these conquests, this much is certain, that, under Tarquinius Triscus, the power of Eome was far greater than it had ever been before. What has made the name of Tarquinius Triscus still more illus trious than his wars and conquests, are the great works which he designed and executed to increase the greatness and splendour of the city. After the conquest of Latium he is said to have con tinued the building of the stone walls, which had been interrupted by the Sabine war; and he began to fortify those parts which were not protected by nature.9 He drained the lower portions of the city about the foram, and the other valleys, which until then had been swamps, by sewers which led the waters into the Tiber. Some of the works and exploits of this king are ascribed in the traditions to the second Tarquinius ; but all agree in stating that the great sewer (cloaca maxima), which still excites the wonder and astonishment of the beholder, is his work.10 As this and similar structures could never have been executed without oppres sive taskwork, he provided, in order to cheer his people, that they shoidd be amused with the celebration of splendid games. On the whole it may be observed, that tradition represents Tarquinius as having been just as ambitious, and as fond of the display of splendour, after his accession as he had been before : hence the rites of religion, which had been plain and simple, were under him clothed with splendour, bloody sacrifices were introduced, and it was in his reign that the Eomans first repre sented their gods in human forms. ,J Tarquinius does not appear to have done much more than form the plan of surrounding Rome with a stone wall; for the execution of the first wall to protect the city is unani mously ascribed by the ancients to his successor, Servius Tullius. vault, a semicircle of about 18 Roman palms in width and in height, is covered by two other vaults : all arc formed of hewn blocks, fixed toge ther with cement : earthquakes, the pressure of buildings, and the neglect of more than 1500 years, have not moved a stone out of its place ; and for thousands of years to come the structure may remain as perfect as it is at this day. 10 This astonishing structure, which in greatness and solidity rivals the greatest works of the Etruscans, may still be seen at Rome : it is of gigantic dimensions. Its innermost"], [81, "TARQUINIUS PRISCUS. 61 With regard to his constitutional changes, Livy simply states that he added one hundred to the number of senators ; and that the hundred new ones were called the patres minorum gentium,11 to distinguish them from the old senators, who were now called patres majorum gentium}- Some writers even allude to his having intended to make a change in the constitution of the three ancient tribes.13 Although the people must have sighed under the yoke of Tar quinius Triscus, yet in after-times they honoured and celebrated him as one of the greatest and most glorious sovereigns ; and it became customary to impute the sufferings inflicted upon the people to his detested son, Tarquinius Superbus. Nay, even his wife, Caia Caeciha (for so she is called in some traditions, instead of Tanaquil) was reverenced as a beneficent enchantress, and a model of ancient domestic virtue. According to tradition, Tar quinius had reigned 38 years (from B.C. 616 to 579), when his glorious career was terminated by assassination. The sons of Ancus Marcius had long wished for an opportunity of taking vengeance on the usurper ; and as they had reason to fear lest he should secure the succession to his favourite Servius Tullius, his son-in-law, they contrived to hire two sturdy shepherds, who, pretending to have a quarrel between them, gained access to the king that he might decide between them, and gave him a deadly wound. It has been proved by modern critics, that the story of Tarqui nius being a son of Demaratus, a contemporary of Cypselus, is irreconcilable with chronology ; for Tarquinius ought to have been born about fifty years later than the story implies. The tradition of Demaratus having introduced alphabetical writing among the Etruscans is of the same kind as that of Evander, who is said to raised to the rank of patricians ; and that they were added to the old senate of 200 members. 11 Cicero, de Re Publ. ii. 20, says that he doubled the number of senators. 15 Dionysius, iii. 67, states that the 100 new senators were chosen from among the plebeians who had been 13 Festus, s. v. Navia, p. 169, ed. Miiller."], [82, "62 HISTORY OF ROME. have taught the Latins the art of writing ; for both only mean to represent the introduction of the alphabet as belonging to a very early period. All traditions about Tarquinius point to Etruria as the country from which he came to Rome ; but still they con tain in themselves strong reasons for rejecting the Etruscan origin of the king. The Tarquinii were not, as the story would lead us to believe, a mere family in our sense of the word, but a whole gens,14 which was banished together with the last king. There are further several traces which may lead us to the belief that this gens was of Latin origin ; for example, the surname Prisons, which also occurs among the Servilii, who were transplanted to Rome from Alba; but we must at all events suppose that Tarquinius belonged to one of the gentes of the Luceres. The legend, which called the wife of Tarquinius Caia Caecilia, was unquestionably older than the one which calls her Tanaquil ; and Caecilia seems to be connected with Caeculus, the founder of Praeneste.15 But it is impossible to say in what manner the story about the Etruscan origin of the Tarquinii may have arisen. The conquest of Etruria, which Dionysius ascribes to Tarquinius, is more than doubtful, although the fact that at one time there was a king at Rome, who ruled over all Etruria, may not be without some his torical foundation ; but whether Rome conquered Etruria, or whether an Etruscan prince fixed his residence at Rome, and from thence ruled over Etruria, Latium, and the. Sabines, are questions which history does not answer. The plebeians, who had existed in the Roman state ever since the time of Tullus Hostilius, and had been increased in the reign of Ancus Marcius, had been left by those kings without any internal organisation of their body, and without any exact definition of their relation to the patricians. But Tarquinius seems to have formed a plan for remedying these evils. The three centuries of equites, which he found existing on his acces sion, contained 600 men; and when he made the attempt to 14 Liv. ii. 2 ; Cic. de Re Publ. ii. 25, 31 ; Varro, ap. Nonium, s. v. Reditus. 15 Serv. ad Virg. Aen. vii. 681."], [83, "TARQUINIUS PRISCUS. 63 double the number of centuries, he undoubtedly contemplated at the same time to add three new tribes to the ancient Eamnes, Tities, and Luceres, and to form them out of the plebeians ; but this plan being thwarted by the opposition of the patricians, who availed themselves of the influence of the augur Attus Navius,16 the king was obliged to content himself with raising the number of the equites contained in the three centuries to 1200, so that each century contained two hundred priores and two hundred posteriores or secundi.17 These 600 new equites were taken from among the plebeians whom the king raised to the rank of patricians. The plebeians thus raised were of course incorporated with the three ancient tribes, without the number of the tribes themselves being altered; and it was out of the same body of new patricians, called gentes minores, that the king elected the hundred new senators, whence they are called the patres minorum gentium. The increase of the number of senators is interpreted by Niebuln to mean that Tar quinius raised the Luceres, who had until then been in a state of submission, to an equality with the two other tribes ; and that accordingly he elected one hundred of them into the senate. But, in the first place, it is scarcely credible that the privilege of becoming members of the senate shoidd have been withheld so long from the third tribe ; and in the second, it is attested by the ex press testimony of Dionysius, that the hundred new senators were taken from among the plebeians who had been raised to the rank of patricians, and consequently could not be Luceres. But if, on the one hand, the three tribes were already represented in the senate, each by one hundred members, it is difficult to see how Tarquinius could have added one hundred others with out going beyond the number of three hundred, which hence forth always appears as the regular number.18 This difficulty 16 Dionys. iii. 71, &c; Festus,s.f. Navia, p. 169, ed. Miiller. '' The different statements in Livy, i. 36, and Cicero, de Re Publ. ii. 20, probably arise from corrupt readings. 18 Liv. ii. 1 ; Dionys. v. 13; Fes tus, s. V. qui patreB qui conscript], p. 254, ed. Miiller."], [84, "64 HISTORY OF ROME. can only be solved by the supposition, either that so many of the old patrician families had become extinct, that they could no longer furnish three hundred senators ; or that the three tribes, up to the time of Tarquinius, had never been represented in the senate by one hundred members each, but only by two hundred for all the three tribes.19 But in whatever manner we may endeavour to explain these difficulties and contradictory statements, thus much is firmly established, that for several centuries after the time of Tarquinius Triscus the regular number of senators was three hundred. The plan of Tarquinius, to put the plebeians in some manner on an equality with the patricians, being thwarted by the latter, he was obliged to leave them in the same position as he had found them : all that he was able to accomplish was, that he raised the most illustrious among them to the rank of patricians. The carrying out of his grand scheme, at least to some extent, was reserved for his successor. The traditions of the early life and death of Servius Tvdlius, the sixth king of Eome, is as marvellous as anything in Eoman history, and in reality nothing more than a poetical lay ; but the political changes, which he is said to have introduced after his accession, are of a genuine historical character, as is proved by their more or less modified continuance through many centuries. The institutions themselves, therefore, are as certain as they well can be : the only point that remains doubtful, is whether they really originated with the one king, Servius Tullius, to whom the gratitude of the later plebeians ascribed the foundation of everything which gave them that position in the state which they desired and deserved. 19 They who conceive that, until the time of Tarquinius, the Luceres were not represented in the senate, might with Livy say that Tarquinius increased the number of senators by 100 ; while those who conceive that the new patricians were a large body of men equal in number to the old patricians, might with Cicero say that Tarquinius doubled the number of senators, just as he doubled the number of equites contained in the three centuries."], [85, "SERVIUS TULLIUS. 65 Ocrisia, the mother of Servius Tullius, is said to have been a handmaid of Tanaquil, the wife of Tarquinius Priscus, and to have been one of the captives taken at Ocricuhim. One day, as she was bringing some offering to the household god, she saw the god himself appear in the fire on the hearth. Tanaquil, on being informed of the vision, ordered her to dress herself as a bride, and to shut herself up in the chapel. There she became the mother of Servius Tullius : his father was, according to some, the household god ; and according to others, Vulcan.20 That the child was destined one day to occupy a high position was indicated even in his infancy ; for once, as he was sleeping in his cradle, his head was seen girt \"with flames. All those who were present were struck with terror at what they witnessed. Some brought water, to extinguish the fire ; but Tanaquil forbade it, for she knew that the fire was the spirit of the child's father, and foresaw that he was called to great things. She also ordered the child not to be moved till he woke of his own accord; and when at last he did wake, the flames vanished. The queen henceforth educated him as her own child, and great hopes were entertained of him. When he had grown up to manhood, Tarquinius gave 20 Ovid. Fast. vi. 625, &c. ; Dio nys. iv. 2. Other traditions stated that his mother was a native of Tar quinii, his father one of the clients of king Tarquinius, and he himself in his childhood a slave. (Cic. de Re Publ. ii. 21.) A third account, which, how ever, is only a rationalistic interpreta tion of the genuine old legend given in the text, and is preferred by Livy (i. 39), states that his father, likewise called Servius Tullius, was an illus trious citizen of Corniculum, who fell in battle, when his native place was taken, leaving his wife in a state of pregnancy. She was carried to Rome like the other captives, but was not allowed to perform any degrading or menial services ; and in the house of Tarquinius Priscus she became the mother of Servius Tullius. AVe can- not leave unnoticed a tradition which was derived by the emperor Claudius from Etruscan sources (see the frag ments of the oration of Claudius in Oberlin's Tacitus, vol. iv. p. 806), although it has little historical value. Servius Tullius is there called the most faithful companion of Caeles Vibenna, an Etruscan condottiere, with whom he shared all his fortunes. With the remnants of his friends'' troops he went to Rome, took posses sion of mount Caclius, changed his Etruscan name Mastarna into the Roman Servius Tullius, and was in the end elected king of Rome. AH that we can derive from this story is that perhaps at one time an Etruscan chieftain established himself as king at Rome."], [86, "66 HISTORY OF ROME. him his own daughter in marriage; and Servius remained the favourite of gods and men. Even in more advanced life, he never ceased to hold communion with the higher powers : the goddess Fortune, who carried him through all the various stages of life, from the lowest to the highest, loved and visited him; and he built a temple to her, placing in it his own statue, which remained uninjured when the temple itself was consumed by fire. Servius Tullius assisted his father-in-law both in council and war ; and none of the young Romans surpassed him in strength and courage. When Tarquinius became old, Servius lightened the yoke which pressed on his subjects; and the great popularity which he thus acquired with the people excited the fears of the sons of Ancus, lest he should be elected to the throne, which they claimed as their lawful inheritance. The result of their fear was the assassination of Tarquinius. Tanaquil, however, kept the king's death secret; and in order to appease the excited multitude, she announced that his wound was not dangerous, but that for the present he had appointed Servius to govern in his stead. Servius accordingly performed the functions of king; and after the lapse of some time, when the death of Tarquinius became known, he was instigated by the queen openly to come forward as king : he was thus the first king that reigned at Rome without having been elected by the senate and sanctioned by the curiae. Afterwards, however, the curiae, at his own request, invested him with the imperium.-1 In order that the sons of his predecessor, Lucius and Aruns Tarquinius, might not turn against him, as those of Ancus Marcius\"2 had done against Tarquinius, he gave them his two daughters in marriage ; but this precaution, far from averting the danger he feared, rendered his fate only more tragic and horrible. The reign of Servius Tullius, like that of Numa, is not cele brated for great military achievements. Livy speaks of a war with 21 Cicero, de Re Publ. ii. 21; Dio- nys. iv. 12; Liv. i. 46. 22 After the death of Tarquinius, the sons of Ancus are said to have quitted Rome, and to have gone to Suessa Pometia into exile."], [87, "SERVIUS TULLIUS. 67 Yeii and other Etruscan cities, in which the king was as brave as he was successfid, and put to flight a large army ; but the his torian gives us no details. Dionysius, on the other hand, men tions victories over the whole Etruscan nation, which is said to have revolted after the death of Tarquinius Priscus, but was again reduced to submission.23 The reign of Servius, however, is of the highest importance in the history of the Eoman constitution ; for his great deeds were laws ; and as tradition called Numa the author or regulator of religious worship, so Servius was regarded as the founder of all civil rights and institutions. He first of all carried out the plan of Tarquinius, of completing the city of Eome, by incorporating with it the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline hills, on the last of which he himself took up his residence, and by surrounding the whole of the city with a stone wall, called after him the wall of Servius Tullius. We shall defer entering into an examination of the constitutional changes introduced by this king, until we have completed his legendary history. He is said to have paid the debts of those who were reduced to poverty out of his private purse ; to have redeemed those who had pledged their labour for the money they had bor rowed; and lastly, to have assigned to the plebeians allotments of land out of the territories that had been conquered in war. The Latins were leagued with the Eomans by treaty ; and Ser vius Tullius prevailed upon them, in common with the Eomans, to build a temple to Diana on the Aventine, the chief abode of the Latins, who had lately become citizens of Eome. This was a tacit acknowledgment, on the part of the Latins, that Eome was the head of their confederacy. The Sabines too seem to have joined in this common worship, as we must infer from the story of the Sabine and his bull. A Sabine yeoman, it is said, had a bull of prodigious size and great beauty born among his cattle. It was announced by the soothsayers, that whoever should sacri fice the animal to Diana on the Aventine, would raise his nation to rule over its confederates. A report of this prophecy reached 23 Liv. i. 42 ; Cicero, De Re Pull. ii. 21. Dionys. iv. 12, 27."], [88, "68 HISTORY OF ROME. the ears of the high-priest of the temple ; and when the Sabine appeared with the victim before the altar of the goddess, the priest rebuked him for attempting to offer it up with unclean hands. While the Sabine went down to the Tiber and washed his hands the Eoman priest accomplished the sacrifice, which caused great joy to the king and all the people. But the beneficent laws and regulations introduced by the good king were received by the patricians with sullenness and anger ; which feelings were further increased by his forbidding the patri cians to fix their habitations on the Esquiline, and by his assigning to them the valley which was called after them the vicus patri cius.2i To take vengeance on the venerable old king, they con spired with the most heinous rebel. The popularity, which the king enjoyed among the people, more and more deprived L. Tarquinius of the prospect of succeeding to the throne of his father.\"5 L. Tarquinius himself was a person of vehement temperament : he was, besides, stimulated at home by his ambitious wife Tullia, the elder of the two daughters of Ser vius Tullius. She, who had at first been married to his bro ther Aruns, himself a person of a mild and honest character, was a woman of a truly fiendish nature ; while her younger sister Tullia, who was married to L. Tarquinius, was amiable and vir tuous like Aruns. The elder Tullia, enraged at the long life of her father, and the apparent indolence of her husband, who showed no ambition, and seemed ready when the throne became vacant to resign it to his brother, resolved upon destroying both her father and her husband. She addressed herself to L. Tarquinius, and induced him to kill his brother and her own sister. No' sooner were the crimes perpetrated than the elder Tullia and L. Tarquinius married. Servius Tullius saw all these tilings, but was unable to prevent them. His life at length becoming insup- 24 Festus, s.v. p. 221. 25 The traditions were not agreed as to whether L.

The whole chrono logy of the Tarquinii is in the greatest confusion."], [89, "DEATH OF SERVIUS. 69 portable to the diabolical couple, Tullia incited L. Tarquinius by day and by night to cut short the life of her father, and place himself upon the throne. The crimes already committed made him, as is usually the case, little concerned about committing another. He began courting the favour of the patricians, especially of the minor gentes, by reminding them of the benefits which his father had conferred upon them. But suddenly something hap pened which seemed to deprive the criminals of the object of their crime; for it was reported that Servius Tullius, to complete his legislation, intended to resign the royal dignity, and to esta blish the considar form of government.26 The patricians also were alarmed at the prospect of such a change; for they had reason to fear lest the hateful laws of the king should be confirmed for ever, if consuls were to be appointed; and they therefore unhesitatingly joined in the conspiracy of L. Tarquinius. When the whole plan was ripe, Tarquinius appeared in the senate with all the ensigns of royalty, and heaped all possible obloquy and calumnies upon the aged king. As the report of the seditious commotion soon reached the king's ears, he hastened to the senate-house, and standing in the door-way rebuked Tarquinius as a seditious traitor ; but the latter treated the king with insults and contempt; and as the friends of each party were preparing for violence, he seized the king and threw him down the steps of the senate house, and then returned to his associates in the senate. Servius Tullius, who was bleeding profusely, was picked up and led away by some of his faithful servants. But before he reached his dwelling, he was overtaken by the emissaries whom Tarquinius had sent after him, and was murdered in the street. His body was left weltering in its blood. Tullia at whose instigation this horrid deed had been committed, was too impatient to wait at home for the tidings of the result of her husband's doings on that day. Through the midst of the crowd she drove to the senate-house, and was the first to salute her husband as king ; but he ordered her to get out of the tumult and return home. * Liv. i. 48 ; Dionys. iv. 40; Plutarch. Be Fort. Rom., p. 323, d."], [90, "70 HISTORY OF ROME. On her way thither she passed through the street in which the body of her father was lying. The driver horror-struck stopped the carriage; but the inhuman Tullia ordered him to drive on over the corpse; and she and her carriage were covered with the blood of her father.27 Tarquin forbade the burial of the king's body, saying in mockery, \"Eomulus too went without a funeral;\" and this impious mockery is said to have given rise to his sur name Superbus.28 Servius Tullius had reigned for a period of forty-four years (from B.C. 578 to 535). His memory continued to be cherished by the plebeians for centuries; and his birth-day was celebrated on the nones of every month ; for he was known to have been born on the nones of some month, the month itself having become a matter of uncertainty. At the time when the plebeians were most cruelly oppressed by the patricians, their veneration for the good king Servius, who had suffered the death of a martyr in then cause, became so strong, that the senate foimd it necessary to enact that markets should never be held on the nones ; lest the people, inflamed by oppression, and animated by the remembrance of better days, should venture to rise, and restore the laws of the king.29 It can hardly be thought necessary to show, that the account of the tragic death of Servius Tullius is not historical : there must indeed have been some historical foundation for it; but the odium attached to the detested name of the last king, and the bitter hatred of the plebeians against the patricians, probably combined to make up the fearfully tragic story of the king's death. There cannot, however, be any doubt that the truth which lies at the bottom of the story, is that Servius fell a victim to a patrician counter-revolution, by which the greater part of his institutions for establishing the freedom and independence of the commonalty were abolished. The story of Servius being the offspring of a slave seems to be a mere etymological speculation about the origin of the name -7 In commemoration of this crime 28 Compare Ovid. Fast. vi. 581, the street was in after-times called the &c vicus sceleratus. ffl Macrobius, Sat. i. 13."], [91, "THE SERVIAN CONSTITUTION. 71 Servius, which was connected with serous and servire; and we must observe in general, that the history of Servius Tullius, the most remarkable among the Eoman kings whose personal exist ence is sufficiently established, is quite as mythical as that of Eomulus or Numa. The genuine Eoman tradition about his descent leads us to the belief that he was a Latin, and probably belonged to a family which had been incorporated with the Eoman curiae in the reign of Tarquinius Priscus. His Etruscan origin would be irreconcilable with the whole character of the political institutions ascribed to him. The statement that Servius Tullius completed the building of the city, and for the sake of safety surrounded it with a wall embracing seven distinct districts, commonly called hills, is esta blished beyond a doubt : the districts he thus inclosed and for tified are to us a proof of his having formed a correct notion of the destiny of the city. But what makes the reign of Servius Tullius more memorable than anything else, and therefore deserves our special attention, is the new constitution which he gave to his kingdom; and more especially the arrangements he made for improving the condition of the plebeians. His great object was to unite, on principles of justice and equity, the two bodies of the patricians and plebeians into one great and powerful nation. We remarked above that Tarquinius Priscus attempted to remedy the evils arising out of the separation of the Eomans into two classes of citizens, one of which had to bear its share in all the public burdens and duties, while it was excluded not only from all honours and advantages, but from exercising any influence whatever upon the government. These latter citizens were in fact treated as aliens, and were with out any internal organisation of their body ; no laws, in fine, existed to regulate their relation to the ruling class or patricians. Tarquinius had raised some of them to an equality with the patricians ; but the great mass of the plebeians still continued in their undefined and precarious position, until Servius Tullius, with as much wisdom as boldness, set about the task. It is a re markable circumstance, that we do not hear of any opposition"], [92, "72 HISTORY OF ROME. having been made by the patricians against his legislation until the whole was completed. The first thing he did was to give the plebeians an inde pendent political organisation : for this purpose, he divided the city of Eome, with the exception of the Capitol and the Aventine, into four regions or districts, which, according to the analogy of the three patrician tribes, he called tribus (tribus urbanae) ; and the territory of Eome (ager Romanus) into twenty six other tribes (tribus rusticae). These thirty tribes, being distinct localities, were naturally inhabited by patricians, no less than by plebeians ; but they were instituted exclusively for the plebeians; and, politically, the patricians did not come into con sideration in this division.30 The affairs of each tribe were managed by an officer called trihunus, whose office must, however, be distinguished from that of the later tribunes of the people ; and each tribe was again divided into a number of pagi, each of which was headed by an officer called magister pagi. The tribunes, who were also called curatores tribuiim,31 had to keep the lists of the members of their respective tribes, and to collect the tributum. The assemblies of the tribes (comitia tributa) in the constitution of Servius Tullius, had no other power than that of discussing the affairs of the tribes as such ; and any resolutions passed in them were binding only on those contained in the tribes, that is, on the plebeians. It is further stated, that the king assigned allotments of public land to the poorer plebeians, probably to those who belonged to the country tribes, and were not yet possessed of landed property. The twenty-six country tribes contained the wealthier portion of the plebeians, who lived on their farms, and carried on agricultural pursuits, the most honourable occupation among the early Eomans; whereas the members of the four city tribes were probably engaged in 30 It might seem surprising to find that in the year b.c 495, when one new tribe had already been added, the total number did not amount to more than twenty-one (Liv. ii. 21) ; but Niebuhr has shown that in the war with Por- considerable part, perhaps one-third, of their territory, which would naturally have reduced the original number of thirty tribes to twenty. 31 Varro, Be Ling.

The civil relations between the two estates also occupied the king's attention; and he regulated them by a number of laws, which he caused to be carried in the assembly of the curiae. Hitherto birth and descent alone had constituted any legal dis tinction between Eoman citizens ; and there was accordingly no other division except that into patricians or nobles, and plebeians. But Servius, like Solon, established a timocracy ; that is, he made property the standard to determine the rights and duties of every citizen. He accordingly instituted a census, for the purpose of ascertaining the property of every citizen, both patri cian and plebeian ; and as property is a fluctuating thing, he ordained that a census should be held every five years, which period was called a lustrum.32 In this census, the whole people was conceived of as an army (exercitus or classis), and as consisting of two parts, the infantry and cavalry. The part which formed the infantry (pedites) were divided, according to the amount of their property, into six classes ; an institution which, with some modifications, continued down to the end of the republic. The class to which a citizen belonged determined the amount of tribute he had to pay for purposes of war, his position in the army, and the kind of armour with which he had to equip him self. For the purpose of voting in the great assembly, each class was divided into a number of centuriae or suffragia, each of which had one vote; and one-half of the number of the centuriae of each class consisted of the elder persons (seniores), while the other half contained the younger ones (juniores). The first class con tained all persons whose property amounted to at least 100,000 ases (100 attic minae, or about 320Z. of our money); the second, those who had at least 75,000 ases (75 attie minae, or about 2407.) ; the third, those who possessed at least 50,000 ases (50 attic minae, or about 160Z.) ; the fourth, those who had at least 32 This word is connected with end of each census a lustratio or puri ustrare and lustratio, because at the fication of the whole people took place. E"], [94, "74 HISTORY OF ROME. 25,000 ases (25 attic minae, or about 80/.) ; the fifth, those who, according to Livy, had 11,000 ases, or, according to Dionysius, 12\u00a3 minae, (that is, 12,500 ases, or about 40/.) Those whose property did not amount to the last-mentioned sum formed the sixth class : being exempt from the tribute, and having to pay oiuy a poll-tax, they were called proletarii or capite censi; whereas those contained in the five other classes were called assidui or locupletes?3 It is not stated whether the sums here mentioned, as qualifications for each class, refer to a man's annual revenue, or to the whole stock of Iris property ; but all circumstances compel us to bebeve that the latter was meant. The sums mentioned cannot surprise us by their smallness, if we recollect that the law specifies only the minimum ; and that a person might possess twice or three times the amount prescribed to the first class, and yet have belonged to it. We must also bear in mind the extraor- dinary cheapness of everything in ancient Italy ; so that a person possessed of 320/. was really a man of considerable property. In addition to all this, it seems to have been the intention of the king, that the first class shoidd not contain only the very wealthy, but all those whom we should term \" rich persons of the middle class.\" Each class was divided into two equal halves, the seniors and the juniors : the latter were men from their seventeenth to their forty-fifth year ; and the former, those from the age of forty five to that of sixty : the seniors were not obliged to march out into the field, but in case of need they might be called to arms to defend the city. After the completion of his sixtieth year, each person was exempt from military service.34 We have hitherto made mention of two kinds of assemblies, the one of the curiae 33 The accounts of the minimum of property in each of the five classes are not the same in all writers, but the differences may easily be accounted for. (Gottling, Geschichfe der Rom. Staatsverfassung, p. 246, &c.) It should also be stated that some writers mention only five classes, the proleta- rians not being taken into account. 34 It is commonly stated that the men above sixty were not allowed to vote in the assembly of the people ; but this opinion is in itself absurd, and is contradicted by numerous historical facts. See Becker, Handbuch der Rom. Alterthumer, ii., p. 216."], [95, "75 THE SERVIAN CONSTITUTION. (comitia curiata), which of course consisted only of patricians, the other of the thirty local tribes (comitia tributa) in which plebeians only took part ; but along with these Servius Tullius instituted the great national assembly of the centimes (comitia centuriata), which met in the Campus Martius, and in which patricians and plebeians met on a sooting of equality ; for there the importance of every citizen was determined by no other standard than that of property and age. Eor the purpose of voting in that assembly, each class was divided into a certain number of centuries, each of which counted as one vote. The first class was divided into eighty centuries or suffragia ; that is, forty centuries of the seniores, and forty of the juniores : the second, third, and fourth classes were divided each into twenty centuries ; ten of the seniores, and ten of the juniores : the fifth class had thirty centuries ; fifteen of the seniores, and fifteen of the juniores. Hence, the total number of the centuries of the five classes was one hundred and seventy, of which the first class alone had eighty, while the four others together had no more than ninety, so that wealth had a decided advantage in these assemblies. Besides the one hundred and seventy centuries of the classes, Servius instituted five others, which did not belong to the classes, but voted between them. They were, two cen turies of the fabri (smiths and carpenters) which, according to Livy, voted after the centuries of the first class, and, according to Dionysius, after those of the second class ; two centuries of the cornicines and tubicines (hornists and trumpeters), which, accord ing to Livy voted after the fifth, and, according to Dionysius, after the fourth class ; and, lastly, all those persons whose pro perty did not come up to the minimum of the fifth class : thus, all who belonged to the sixth class formed only one century, and accordingly had only one vote. The five additional centuries were not divided like those of the classes into seniores and juniores, but the century of the sixth class appears to have consisted of three sub-divisions, viz., the accensi velati, the proletarii, and capite censi, according to the amount of their property : the e 2"], [96, "76 HISTORY OF ROME. accensi velati were those whose property was between 1500 ases and the minimum of the fifth class, and they were regularly called upon to serve in the army ; the proletarii were those whose property was less than 1500 but above 375 ases, and they were rarely called out to military service, until in the year B.C. 290 the custom was established of enlisting them regularly. The capite censi, who possessed less than 375 ases, were not obliged to serve in the army until the time of Marius.30 All that has been said hitherto refers to the Eoman citizens only in so far as they formed the infantry of the army : in addi tion to the 175 centuries which we have enumerated above, Servius Tulhus formed a certain number of equestrian centuries, which were not subdivided into seniores and juniores, but con tained only men below the age of forty-six. When he began his reforms, he found the three double centuries of equites, as they had been constituted by Tarquinius Priscus. Servius divided these three double centuries into six single ones, each consisting of 200 equites : they were called the sex suffragia, and formed the corps of patrician equites. In addition to these six centuries, Servius created twelve new ones, which he took from among the wealthiest plebeians, and which, like the six patrician ones, undoubtedly contained 200 men each ; so that the total number of the eighteen equestrian centuries was 3600. As to the pro perty quabfication required of an eques in those early times, we have no exact testimony : all we are told is, that the equites were taken from among those who had the highest census, which might mean, that all of them belonged to the first class ; but as, in the later times of the republic, the equestrian census was four times as high as that of the citizens of the first class, we may reasonably suppose, that the same or a similar arrangement was made by Servius Tullius. Each eques received from the pubhc treasury a certain sum of money (acs equestre) for the purpose of 35 If we suppose that the first two century would have contained five pivisions of this century were subdi- divisions, which would account for its vided, like the centuries of the classes, name quintana classis, and also for into seniores and juniores, the whole Dionysius calling it the sixth class."], [97, "THE SERVIAN CONSTITUTION. 77 purchasing a war-horse (equus publicus), and an additional annual sum for its maintenance. This annual sum was levied upon orphans and widows, who were otherwise exempt from the tri bute. The sum total of all the centuries in the Servian consti tution was thus 193 ; so that 97 formed a majority of votes in the assembly. Now, considering that the equites gave their votes first, and next the seniores and juniores of the first class; it is evident that a great preponderance of power was placed in the hands of the wealthiest Eomans ; for if the eighteen equestrian centuries and the eighty centuries of the first class were agreed upon any point under discussion, the question was decided at once, and there was no necessity for putting it to the vote of the Other centuries. The following table will show at a glance the Census of each class, the order of voting, the number of votes (centuriae or suffragia) assigned to each, and the slight differences which occur in the accounts of the two principal historians, Livy and Dionysius.

There seems to be little doubt that the account given by Dionysius is the correct one; for, according to Livy's calculation, it would have been impossible to obtain an absolute majority, since it might so happen that ninety-seven centuries voted for a proposal, aud the other ninety-seven against it. The assembly of the people, in which the votes were given according to centuries, comprising, as it did, both patricians and plebeians, was a true representation of the whole nation, and the only one in which a plebeian felt himself placed on an equality with his patrician neighbour, pro vided he was possessed of the same amount of property. To these comitia, which, generally speaking, stept into the place of those of the curiae, although the latter still continued to be held, Servius transferred the election of the highest magistrates,36 the decision upon peace and war, and the confirmation of legislative. measures proposed by the senate. No mention is made of Ser vius having established the connubium between patricians and plebeians, nor of his having made them ebgible either to the highest magistracies, and priestly offices, or into the senate. All that Servius aimed at, seems to have been to secure to the ple beians an influence upon the legislature, the election of magis trates, and other matters of public importance ; and as the degree of influence was dependent upon property, its exercise was within the reach of every industrious plebeian. The king showed his political wisdom by not altogether upsetting the ancient order of things ; and by placing the plebeians in a position from which they might gradually work their way upwards, or in one which, at least, rendered further development a matter of possibility. His institutions, therefore, contained the germs and foundation of the future equably between the two estates. The statement, that he intended to resign his regal power, and to institute two consuls, one a patrician, the other a plebeian,37 as also to invest the tri- 36 The officers of the curiae and those of the thirty local tribes were of course appointed respectively by the curiae and tribes : we are here speaking only of those magistrates whose office concerned the whole people.

CHAPTEE V. L. TARQUINIUS SUPERBUS BANISHMENT OF THE KING AND HIS FAMILY RETROSPECTIVE VIEW OF THE ROMAN CONSTITUTION UNDER THE KINGS, AND OF THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE. There can be no doubt that the hatred of the kingly form of government, which was so deeply rooted in the hearts of the repubbcan Eomans, though it may have arisen from the arbitrary and tyrannical rule of Tarquinius Superbus, yet contributed, in its turn, not a little to blacken his character in history ; and that no small part of the odium attaching to his name must be set down to the love of exaggeration. Tarquinius Superbus was un questionably a general of great talent ; and the splendour and magnificence of Eome were advanced by him more than by any of his predecessors. After the murder of Servius Tullius, L. Tarquinius Superbus ascended the throne, without either being elected by the senate and people or sanctioned by the curiae. In the revolution to which he owed his elevation, the rights and privUeges conferred upon the plebeians by Servius were abobshed. The people were so severely oppressed, kept so much to hard work in erecting the king's magnificent buildings, and abandoned so much to the caprices of the tyrant and the patricians, that numbers of them made away with themselves ; to check which the king is said to have ordered their dead bodies to be nailed to the cross.1 It was however not the plebeians alone that had to suffer : many of the old patricians were put to death or sent into exile, probably because they had 1 Plin.

Aen. xii. 603."], [101, "TARQUINIUS SUPERBUS. 81 not been as zealous in support of his usurpation, as those patricians who had of late been raised to their rank by his father. He surrounded himself with a body-guard for the purpose of securing his usurped power ; and after being thus strengthened, he took the whole aclministration of justice into his own hands ; many senators were put to death; others were sent into exile, and their property was confiscated by the king. The number of senators was thus greatly reduced; and no new ones were elected to fill the vacant places : nay, he never condescended even to assemble the senate, or to consult it upon any matter, taking upon himself the decision of all questions respecting which it had formerly been customary to ask the opinion of the senate. Tarquinius Superbus, like many other tyrants who about the same time ruled in the cities of Greece, was no less bold and warlike than fond of splendour and magnificence. All Latium was obbged to bow before the majesty of Eome, and to recognise her as the head of the Latin confederacy. According to Livy and Dionysius,2 Latium was reduced to submission by persuasion, by the personal influence of the tyrant upon the leading men among the Latins, and by the family connections he established with them;3 while men Kke Turnus Herdonius of Aricia, who ventured to oppose the king's schemes, were treated as malefactors and sentenced to death. Cicero,4 on the other hand, speaks of all Latium having been conquered by force of arms. But however this may have been, the Eoman king hence forth sacrificed the bull at the annual festival of all the Latins (feriae Latinae) on the Alban mount, in the front of the temple of Jupiter Latiaris, and on behalf of all the Latin towns, each of which received a portion of the victim's flesh.5 In order that in war the Latins should not have any separate commanders and 2 Liv. i. 49 ; Dionys. iv. 45, &e. 5 Some ruins of this common sanc- 3 Thus he is said to have given his tuary of the Latins are still visible on daughter in marriage to Octavius Ma- the hill, which now bears the name of milius of Tusculum.

The league was also joined by the Hernicans, and the Volscian towns of Ecetra and Antium, but their cohorts were kept apart from the Eoman legions. The next thing which engaged his attention was the war against the Volscians. Suessa Pometia, a wealthy Volscian town, with a most fertde and luxurious domain, was besieged and taken. The king made immense booty; and the vast sum of money produced by its sale enabled him to build the magnificent temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline hill, which his father had vowed in the Sabine war.6 But the money thus raised was not sufficient to cover the expenses, and the people were burthened with heavy taxes and compelled to hard task-work. All the gods, to whom places had before been dedicated on the Capitol, now gave way to the great gods whose worship was to be esta bbshed there, with the exception of Juventas and Terminus, indi cations that the youth of the Eoman empire would never fade, and its boundaries never be reduced. In digging the foundations of the temple, the workmen found a human head,7 undecayed and trickling with blood, which was taken as a sign that Eome was destined to be the head of the world. In a subterraneous cell of this temple, on the Capitol, were preserved the Sibylbne books, in which the fate of Eome was revealed. The king was said to have received them from a sibyl or prophetess. She had offered to sell him nine books for three hundred pieces of gold; but being treated by the king with scorn, she burnt three, and then three more, and threatened to destroy the remaining three also, unless the king would pay her for them the same sum which she had at first asked for all nine. His curiosity was at last excited, and he purchased the three books, whereupon the' sibyl disappeared.3 See p. 58. 7 The head was ascribed to one Tolus, and the hill, which had before been called Mons Tarpeius, was henceforth called Capitolium.

The war with Suessa Pometia, in the territory of which Tar quinius afterwards established the colonies of Signia and Circeii, was the first of a series which fill the early annals of the republic, and lasted for upwards of two hundred years. The Eoman arms were next directed against Gabii, one of the Latin towns, situated about twelve miles from Eome. It had proudly rejected the proposal to join the confederacy with Eome. Tarquinius attempted to besiege the place, but was repulsed ; and what could not be accomplished by force he then endeavoured to effect by fraud and treachery. While he was occupied with the continuation of Iris great buildings at Eome, his eldest son Sextus, according to a preconcerted plan, went to Gabii, pretending to have been ill-treated by his father; and showing the wounds which he said his cruel parent had inflicted on him, he implored the protection of the Gabines against the tyrant. He was kindly received by the Gabines, who hoped that, with the assistance of an infuriated son, they might soon compel the father to abstain from hostilities. Sextus stimulated the Gabines to wage war against Eome : they listened to his advice, and even intrusted him with the command of a body of volunteers, who marched out and ravaged the Eoman territory. Every enterprise succeeded ; for booty and soldiers were thrown in his way by his father at certain places. The deluded Gabines at length made him chief commander of their troops. Several skirmishes took place with the Eomans, in which the Gabines were allowed to gain advan tages over their enemies ; and the confidence of the Gabines in their leader increased from day to day. When Sextus had reached the height of his power, and was doubtful as to the manner in which he should deliver Gabii into the hands of his father, he secretly sent a messenger to him, to request his advice. Tar quinius, who happened to be in his garden when the messenger arrived, was afraid to trust the man with any express and definite message. He therefore, while walking about in the garden, as trusted to two officers, duumviri, who state was visited by any extraordinary had to consult them whenever the calamity."], [104, "84 HISTORY OF ROME. if he were meditating upon an answer, struck off the heads of the tallest poppies with his stick ; and without saying a word he dis missed the messenger. The latter, on his arrival at Gabii, related to Sextus what he had seen; and the prince at once understood the meaning of his father's act. He caused the principal men at Gabii to be put to death, by bringing false accusations against them, whde others were despatched in secret, or sent into exile. Their property was confiscated and distributed among the multi tude, who by this means were made to forget the pubbc misfortune. When the city was thus bereaved of its best citizens it was without a struggle debvered up into the hands of the Eoman king, who gave the Eoman franchise to its citizens;9 he also concluded a peace with the Aequians, and renewed the treaty with the Etruscans. After these successful military undertakings, Tarquinius again devoted his attention to the completion of the CapitoKne temple, the sewers, and other useful or ornamental buildings. But his security of uninterrupted good fortune was disturbed by alarming prodigies. The oracle of Delphi was then in the highest repute in the ancient world; and as the prodigies appeared to announce misfortunes to the royal family, the king sent his two younger sons, Titus and Aruns, to consult the oracle about the means of averting the evil. They took with them costly presents for the god, and were accompanied by L. Junius Brutus, a son of the king's sister. His brother had been put to death by Tarquinius, and he himself had saved his life only by assuming the appearance of a dullard or idiot, though in reality he was a young man of strong judgment and intellect, and was only watching for an opportunity of deHvering his country from the tyranny of his uncle. When the king's command had been executed at Delphi, the youths coidd not resist the temptation to ask the Pythia who was to become king of Eome after the death of Tarquinius. The o Traces of the ancient greatness of town was a heap of ruins; and this Gabii are still seen in the walls of the temple and the walls of the city were cell of a temple of Jupiter. But as all that then remained. early as the time of Dionysius the"], [105, "85 LUCRETIA. Pythia answered, \" He who first kisses Ms mother.\" The two brothers determined to keep this oracle secret from their brother Sextus, that he might be shut out from the throne, and settled between themselves by lot as to which of them shoidd first kiss their mother on their return to Eome. But their plan was an idle one, for the Pythia did not mean their carnal mother, but the earth, the mother of all mortals ; and Brutus, who understood the meaning, pretending to fall, as he touched the ground, kissed the earth without being observed by his cousins. After the return of the princes to Eome, other prodigies harassed the king's mind : they clearly foreboded his downfall, and warned him; but he was bKnd to their import, and his fate had its own way. As the great pubbc works had exhausted his treasury, and he was in want of means to soothe the anger of his hard-worked and oppressed people, who began loudly to show their discontent, he undertook a war against Ardea, a wealthy town of the Butulians, which was situated on a lofty rock. An attempt was made to take the place by assault ; but as this was impracticable, the Eomans laid siege to it, hoping gradually to compel the inhabitants by hunger to surrender. The Eomans therefore lay idle in their tents, waiting till the people of Ardea should have consumed their stores of provisions. One day as the king's sons and their cousin, L. Tarquinius, sumamed Colla tinus (from the town of Collatia) were banqueting in their tent, a discussion arose about the virtues of their wives, and each extolled his own above those of the others. Collatinus however was strongest in the praise of his wife Lucretia, and challenged the princes to convince themselves by going to Eome and Col latia, and paying an unexpected visit to their wives. Heated by wine they forthwith mounted their horses, and straightway rode to Eome. There they found the princesses revelling in the evening, at a luxurious banquet, with their friends. From Eome they proceeded to Collatia ; and though they arrived very late at night, they found Lucretia engaged in spinning amid the circle of her maids. Collatinus and the princes were kindly received"], [106, "86 HISTORY OF ROME. by Lucretia; and her husband enjoyed the triumph he had gained through her domestic virtues. A few days after their return to the camp, Sextus Tarquinius, inflamed by reckless lust, went secretly with only one trusty com panion to Collatia. Being a kinsman, he was hospitably received by Lucretia; but in the dead of night he entered her chamber, sword in hand, threatening that unless she would consent to satisfy his brutal lust, he would kill her, and lay a slave with his throat cut beside her body; that he would thus render her memory for ever loathsome, and return to the camp and tell Collatinus that he had avenged his honour. By this terrific threat he gained his end. Lucretia, overwhelmed with grief, in the morning sent a messenger to her husband at Ardea, and to her father Lucretius at Eome, begging them to come to Collatia, each with his most faithful friend, for that horrible things had taken place. Lucretius came with P. Valerius who was after wards surnamed Pubbcola, and Collatiiius with L. Junius Brutus. They found the disconsolate wife sitting in her chamber ; and as her friends entered, tears burst from her eyes. She told them the dreadful tale, and called upon them to avenge the crime of which she was the victim. They swore that the fiendish man should be chastised, and endeavoured to comfort her ; but in vain : she drew forth a dagger which she had concealed under her garment, and plunged it into her breast. While the others stood by, amazed at what they had heard and what they saw, Brutus drew the dagger out of the body, and swore by the bloody weapon to destroy Tarquinius Superbus and all his race. His three friends swore to the same effect, and followed Brutus as their leader, as he demanded of them to put an end to the tyranny exercised by Tarquinius and his sons. They carried the corpse of Lucretia into the market-place of Collatia. The people, moved and excited by the dreadful sight, took up arms, and at once renounced the rule of Tarquinius. A garrison was formed at Collatia, and all the young men followed Brutus to Eome. The news of the deed of Sextus produced the same indignation at"], [107, "87 BANISHMENT OF THE KING. Eome as it had done at Collatia. The gates were closed ; and Brutus, who held the office of tribune of the Celeres, ordered the people to be called together in the forum. When the people were assembled, and Brutus had explained to them the object of their meeting, all were animated by only one feebng : with one accord they decreed the deposition of king Tarquinius, and banished him with his wife and fanrily. Brutus then assembled a body of volunteers, to set out against the king, who was still in the camp at Ardea; while Lucretius, who had been invested by Tarquinius with the office of prefect of the city, was left behind with the supreme command at Eome. Tullia, the queen, had taken to flight ; and the people left her punishment to the spirits of her father and husband whom she had murdered. When the king in his camp was informed of what was going on at Eome, he immediately set out to quell the insurrection. But he found the gates of the city closed against hini ; while Brutus, by a different road, had reached the camp at Ardea. The soldiers saluted him as the hberator of their country, expelled the king's sons, and confirmed the deposition of the tyrant. Tarquinius and his two sons, Titus and Aruns, took refuge at Caere in Etru ria, where Eoman exiles were entitled to settle as citizens. Sextus fled to Gabii, which he regarded as his own principality ; but the friends of those whom he had put to death now made him pay for his crimes with Iris life. L. Tarquinius Superbus had reigned at Eome, for a period of 25 years, from b.c. 534 to 510; but no king was elected after him. According to the regulations of Servius Tullius, the comitia of the centuries met in the field of Mars : a truce was concluded with Ardea, and the army called back to Eome. The people abobshed the kingly dignity for ever, and outlawed every one who should attempt to rule as king at Eome. The laws of Servius Tullius were restored ; and under the presidency of the prefect of the city, the people elected two men, L. Junius Brutus and L. Tarquinius Collatinus, to rule over them with the title of consuls, for the term of one year. The day of the king's"], [108, "88 HISTORY OF ROME. flight (regifugium or fugalia) was celebrated at Eome every year on the 24th of February ; but though the Eomans detested the kingly form of government, and even the very name of king, they did not abobsh any of the civil or religious institutions of their kings, and even their statues on the Capitol were preserved from destruction by a certain feeling of reverence. The history of the last Tarquinius is so much interwoven with poetical tales, and bears such evident marks of exaggeration, that all we can look upon as really historical are the bare facts that he was a tyrannical ruler, and the last king of Eome. The story of the war with Gabii, and the treachery of Sextus, are nothing but a repetition of that of Sinon related by Virgil, and that of Zopyrus told by Herodotus.10 It is inconceivable that any ancient sovereign should have granted the franchise, as Tarquinius is said to have done, to a city bke Gabii, and after such occur rences as tradition has handed down. The treaty with Gabii was engraved upon a wooden shield, which was preserved at Eome in a temple as late as the time of Dionysius; and the very existence of such a treaty shows the absurdity of the story of the surrender of that town. The account of the enormous spoils taken at Suessa Pometia is quite incredible ; and though Tar quinius is said to have destroyed the place, it re-appears in history a few years later,\" when it is besieged and taken. The stories of the particular cruelties of Tarquinius bear the strongest marks of being either inventions or very much exaggerated : one of them tells us that he introduced human sacrifices;1'2 and another that he invented instruments of torture.13 The statement that Brutus acted the part of an idiot, and was treated as such, is at variance with the one that he was invested with the office of tribune of the Celeres ; and the two statements must have arisen from two different traditions, which were afterwards combined into one. It is not impossible that the story of his feigned idiocy ]\u00b0 III. 154, v. 92. 11 Liv. ii. 17. 13 Euseb. Chron. N. 1469; Isidor. Oriy. v. 27. 13 Macrob. Satum.i. 7."], [109, "THE KINGLY PERIOD. 89 had no other ground than the signification of the name Brutus, which means \" dull \" or \" stupid,\" and in the Oscan language \" a run-away slave.\" We may also mention that in the year before the deposition of Tarquinius, Brutus is described as a youth, and scarcely two years later we find him the father of a son who is old enough to take part in a conspiracy. The beautiful and tragic tale of Lucretia, and of the subsequent banishment of the Tarquins, has in itself nothing improbable : that of Lucretia in particular is one of those which happen most frequently in little states governed by tyrants ; but it is inseparably connected with the story about the Eoman camp before Ardea. Now we are told that immediately after the banishment of the king, a truce was concluded with Ardea; and in the treaty with Carthage, which was estabhshed in the same year, we find the Eomans stipidating that no injury should be done to the Ardeatans, just as if Ardea had been one of the subject Latin towns.14 This fact renders the conclusion of the truce, and consequently the story of the siege, altogether, extremely doubtful. The period during which Eome was governed by kings is not the same in all authorities : according to some it was 240, accord ing to others 243, and according to others again 244 years; though the first or round number of 240 seems to have been the one most generally adopted. Even if we look apart from the unusual phenomenon of seven elective kings ruling for so long a period as 240 years, there are obvious reasons for treating the chronology of the kingly period, and of the subsequent time down to the taking of Eome by the Gauls, as artificially made up by later annabsts ; for there is symmetry throughout, and where such a symmetry exists, we cannot help saying with Archimedes, when he saw mathematical figures in the sand, \" Here I perceive the hand of man.\" Not to mention the impossibilities and absurdities connected with the history of the Tarquins, the mere fact of the whole period from the foundation of the city to its capture by the 14 Polyb. iii. 22."], [110, "90 HISTORY OF ROME. Gauls being divided into three almost- equal portions, each be ginning with some great event in Eoman history \u2014 the formation of the plebeian order about the middle of the reign of the fourth king, the expulsion of the kings, and the conquest of Eome by the Gauls \u2014 is sufficient to show, that little or no rebance can be placed upon such chronological speculations. The result of these considerations, which Niebuhr has pursued with great minuteness, is that we cannot say whether Eome was actually governed by seven kings only, or whether there were actually no more than seven and that the period assigned to their reigns is too long. In short, we have no hesitation in concluding that the whole chronology of those times is a fabrication, made up at a time when the genuine ancient documents were lost ; for it is an acknowledged fact, that at the time when Eome was sacked by the Gauls, nearly all the ancient historical monuments were destroyed ; and the history of the times previous to that calamity was afterwards restored as well as it could be. Let us now cast a glance at the constitution of Eome under her kings, and the condition of the people. Down to the trine of Servius Tiilrius, the whole government was divided between the king, the senate, and the assembly of the curiae. Eome was an elective monarchy, in which the power of the king was limited by the senate and the people. The sons of the later kings are said, in the traditions, to have claimed a certain right to succeed their fathers ; but such a right was never recognised. The king was the head of the state, and united in his person the judicial, the executive, and, to some extent, also the legislative power : he was, at the same time, at the head of all rebgious and military affairs. These powers however were delegated to him, at his election, by the whole body of the citizens ; and on his death they naturally devolved on the people. An interrex was then appointed, for the purpose of conducting the new election of the king, who was in reabty no more than the highest magistrate. When the senate and the interrex had agreed upon a fit candi date, he was proposed to the assembly of the people, who had to"], [111, "POWERS OF THE KING. 91 decide whether they would accept him or not. But besides this decision of the people, it was necessary that the gods should ap prove of the election by augury ; when, if the signs were favour able, the new king was inaugurated. When this ceremony was over, the king proposed to the assembled curiae a decree or law, by which they should confer upon him the imperium, that is, the highest military and judicial power (lex curiata de imperio)}1 In the constitution of Servius Tullius, it was of course intended that the king should be elected in the comitia of the centuries ; and that the imperium should be conferred upon him by the curiae : this regulation was followed in the time of the republic, in reference to the elections of the repubbcan magistrates. The king was thus the supreme commander in war, the chief judge, and the high priest of the nation : in his judicial functions how ever he was probably assisted by a councd ; and it would also seem that a person condemned by the king might appeal to the assembly of the curiae. The ensigns of the king's power were the fasces, or bundles of axes, which were carried before him by twelve bctors. These fasces, as well as the other badges of royalty, the curule chair, and the toga praetexta, are said to have been introduced into Eome from Etruria, according to some in the reign of Eomulus, and according to others in that of the elder Tarquinius or Tullus Hostilius. The king derived his income from a portion of the domain land (ager publicus), and from his share of the booty taken in war. Besides the king there was no permanent magistrate, unless we consider the tribune of the Celeres, who was the king's vicegerent in all military under takings, to have been one. The custos, or praefectus urbis, that is, the prefect of the city, was intrusted with the protection and defence of the city whenever the king was absent, and was ap pointed by the king himself. 16 This is expressed by Livy by cians assembled in the comitia curiata ; the phrase patres auctores sunt or and does not by any means signify the facti sunt : the word patres in this senate. phrase is quite equivalent to the patri-"], [112, "92 HISTORY OF ROME. The senate was a deliberative assembly, which formed the state council of the king, who had the power of electing into it whom soever he pleased, without being responsible to any power in the state. Hence it cannot properly be said that the senate represented the people, or any portion of it : the only thing that might lead to such an idea is the circumstance, that an equal number of senators was taken from each of the three tribes. The power of the senate, in its relation to the king, appears to have been of a very Mmited kind ; for no meeting of the senators could be held unless it was convened by the king, or his vicegerent, the prefect of the city. The king himself introduced the subjects for discussion, and asked the senators for their opinion ; but as the senate was not an invention of the Eoman kings, but an institution which we find in all the states of antiquity, as well as in Latium, usage undoubtedly exercised a powerful influence in regard to the king's actions towards the senate : although the senate could not act without the king's will, and had no means of opposing it, yet the king was obbged to listen to his senate ; and it was only the tyranny of Tarquinius the Proud that dis pensed with consulting the senate. The chief subjects, which were brought before it for discussion, were those relating to affairs with foreign cities or nations ; such as the beginning of war, the conclusion of peace, the formation of treaties and alli ances, and the like. Eespecting the part which the senate took in legislation, and the administration of pubbc affairs, we have no information ; but though it may be presumed that the king consulted the senate upon legislative matters, still the fact of Servius Tullius having been able to carry out his constitutional changes, which were greatly against the wishes of the senate, shows that the senate must have been very powerless, and had no means of thwarting the king's plans. With regard to matters of administration, it may be taken for granted, that the lands conquered in war were not disposed of without the co-operation of the senate ; and also, that the king could not tax his subjects at discretion, or without the consent of the senate."], [113, "POWERS OF THE SENATE AND PEOPLE. 93 The assembly of the people, previous to the constitution of Servius Tidlius, is naturally no other than the assembly of the patricians, according to their curiae (comitia curiata). This assembly may, in some respects, be said to have possessed the sovereign power ; for it was the source from which the king derived his, and to which it returned on the king's death. In delegating to one person the rights originally belonging to them, the people, in one sense, renounced those rights ; but, at the same time, they did not pledge themselves to submit to his will, or to give up their co-operation in, and their right of voting upon, matters of pubbc importance. The rights of the people, therefore, were not, as in many modern states, a concession made to them by their sovereign ; but they originally belonged to them ; and what they retained, or gave up, was based upon a contract between the people and their king. The comitia of the curiae were convened by the king, or his vicegerent, through a lictor, and had the power of accepting or rejecting any proposal that was brought before them.16 Each citizen had a personal and independent vote in his particular curia ; but the people did not vote as a mass of individuals : when the opinion of each curia was ascertained by the majority of individuals in it, then all the curiae voted, each curia being reckoned as one vote ; just as in the comitia of the centuries, the votes were given by centu ries, and not by individuals. The comitia curiata were held in the comitium, under the presidency of the king, or the magis trate who had convoked them. They had not the power to originate any measure whatever, to propose amendments, or to discuss the merits or deinerits of a proposal : all they could do was to accept or reject ; but on this point they had perfect freedom to act as they thought fit, and their decision was final. 16 With these comitia curiata we must not confound mere condones, that is, assemblies in which certain things were only announced to the people; nor the comitia calata, which were held under the presidency of the pontiffs, and in which the people likewise acted a passive part, either re ceiving information or being called to be witness to certain religious or legal transactions."], [114, "94 HISTORY OF ROME The principal subjects on which the assembly had to decide were, the election of the king, the passing of laws, and a variety of subjects connected with the internal administration of the affairs of the curiae, rentes, and families.17 In the reign of Tullus Hos tilius, the assembly is said to have become the high court of appeal in criminal cases ; but this is very doubtful, as the same is stated to have taken place in the first year of the republic. In the constitution of Servius Tullius, most of the rights of the comitia curiata were transferred to the comitia of the centuries, of which we have already spoken ; and the comitia of the curiae received a compensation, in their right of sanctioning or rejecting the measures which had been passed by the centuries. Respecting the condition of the people, and their mode of bring in those early times, scarcely anything is known beyond what may be gleaned from the legendary traditions. The progress of civilisation must have been greatly impeded by the constant wars which the Romans had to carry on with their neighbours ; although the stories about king Numa and his regulations would lead us to infer, that there existed in his reign a certain degree of well-being and industrial activity, forming a strong contrast with the shepherds, and their mode of Use, in the time of Romulus. The eariiest Romans had no coinage ; and what they had to pay they paid in cattle, or masses of brass ; for Servius Tullius is said to have been the first king who coined brass, marking it with the figure of some animal.13 It was not till the time of Tarquinius that Rome, which until then had been a place of not much note, and more bke a cluster of separate villages or Httle townships, acquired fi Dionysius, (ii. 14, iv. 20) who in general describes the distribution of the powers of government nearly the same as it was in the later times of the republic, is wrong in his de finitions. With regard to the comi tia, e.g. he mentions that they had also to decide upon peace and war ; but in the kingly period, and for a long time after, no instance occurs of the people having had anything to do with the conclusion of a peace, whereas it is well known that war could not be declared without the con sent of the people.

The principal and most honourable occupa tion of a Eoman was agriculture ; and rustic festivals sanctified and enlivened the toil of the labourer in the field. Commerce and trade, for purposes of gain, being bttle esteemed, were mostly left to the cbents, and afterwards to those plebeians who had no farms of their own to cultivate ; but still commerce must have acquired considerable importance, from the time that Ostia became the port of Eome, as we may gather from the treaty which Eome concluded with Carthage in the first year of the republic. The fine arts and riterature were yet foreign to the Eomans ; and the great architectural works, which were executed under the last kings, were designed and superintended by Etrus can artists. The language of the Eomans was harsh and inflexible, and bttle suited to the purposes of riterature : the art of writing was unquestionably known, but probably used only for pubbe purposes, such as the census, the keeping of the annals or records of the most remarkable events and prodigies of each year, and other similar purposes. The Eomans did not possess the artistic genius, which forms so prominent a feature in the character of the Greeks : their character was more severe and warlike ; and practical and domestic rife had more charms for them than for the volatile Greeks. The power of a father over his children was almost unliniited. Their domestic life was of the simplest kind : it seems to have resembled that of our ancestors during the early part of the middle ages ; for the virtues of the wife of the first Tarquinius, and of the chaste Lucretia, consisted in their industrious and domestic habits : we find these princesses de scribed as occupied with spinning amid their maid- servants; while tradition mentions with disapprobation the luxurious life of the princesses in the court of the last king."], [116, "96 HISTORY OF ROME. CHAPTEE VI. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REPUBLIC \u2014 EVENTS DOWN TO THE BATTLE OP LAKE REGILLUS \u2014 DEATH OF TARQUINIUS SUPERBUS. The revolution which put an end to the kingly government at Eome, and changed it into a republic, did not produce any mate rial alteration in the state of affairs, or in the condition of the people : all that was done was the restoration of the constitu tion of Servius Tullius; for the two republican magistrates,1 who had been appointed after the banishment of the king, received the same power, and the same ensigns of their dignity, as had before belonged to the king. The only difference was, that one of the magistrates might be checked by the other ; and that their office lasted only one year ; after which they retired to a private station, and might be taken to account for their conduct during the period of their office. The king had been the high priest, as he had to perform certain public sacrifices on behalf of the whole nation ; but this priestly dignity was not transferred to the consuls ; and a separate priest (rex sacrificulus or rex sacrorum) was appointed for the purpose of offering those public sacrifices. The two consuls, moreover, had not the fasces, the ensigns of their power, both at the same time, but alternately every month, beginning with the elder of the two magistrates, or the consul major; so that in reality one only was invested with the imperium at a trine. 1 We shall throughout this work call them by the title of consuls, although it is a well-known fact that at first and down to the year B.C. 449 they bore the title of praetores, and in Greek writers arparvyoi (Zonaras, vii. 19 ; Liv. iii. 55.) The word consul is probably composed of con and sul, which contains the same root as the verb salio, so that consules sig nifies \" those who go together,\" just as praesul and exml signify \"one who goes before,\" and \" one who goes out.\""], [117, "THE REPUBLIC. 97 The period which now follows, from the establishment of the commonwealth down to the battle of Lake Begillus, is not more historical than any of the preceding periods : it is full of poetical tales, and forms the conclusion of the mythical age of Eome. But we shall relate the traditions as they have been handed down to us, and make our comments on them as we proceed. Brutus, who had the fasces first, made the people swear not to allow any one ever to rule at Eome with the title of king : his next step was to fill up the vacancies in the senate, which had been greatly reduced by the late king. He increased the number of senators to 300, which henceforth remained unchanged for many centuries. The new senators were taken from the eques trian order, that is, from the wealthiest class of Eoman citizens ; and their number probably comprised plebeians as well as patri cians. A distinction, however, is said to have been made, inas much as the new senators were called conscripti, while the old ones were styled patres ; so that henceforth a person, in address ing the senate, had to use the title patres conscripti, that is, patres et conscripti. As Tarquinius Collatinus, the second in the first pair of con suls, belonged to the family of the exiled king, Brutus prevailed upon him to resign his office ; and Collatinus withdrew to Lan uvium, where he lived in quiet retirement until his death. This simple story contains two points which are inexplicable : first, how was it that Brutus, himself a nephew of the exiled king,2 could propose to Collatinus to resign his office, without offering himself to set the example ? and, secondly, is it not revolting to every good feering, that Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia, should have been allowed to go into exile ? The common excuse, derived from the jealousy of republics, is quite inapplicable here ; for Collatinus had done nothing to provoke such a jealousy. The story, in its present form, therefore, is either incomplete and incorrect ; or we must believe that the poet, from whom it is derived, overlooked those points on which history has a right to 2 Liv. i. 56. F"], [118, "98 HISTORY OF ROME. demand an answer. In the place of Brutus, the people elected P. Valerius, who had likewise been one of the four liberators of his country ; and at the same time the centuries exiled the whole gens of the Tarquinii. There was, however, at Eome, a party of young men, especially nobles, who delighted more in the licentious and voluptuous life they had been permitted to lead under the rule of the late tyrant, and in their intercourse with the reckless princes of the royal family, than in that freedom of all ranks, which obliged them to keep within the bounds of decency. While they, therefore, regretted the abolition of the regal power, circumstances seemed to render its recovery possible; for at that time there arrived at Eome Etruscan ambassadors, to demand of the senate the restoration of the Tarquins, or, at least, that their property should be given back to them. During their stay at Eome, these ambassadors formed a conspiracy, the object of which was to effect the restora tion of the exiled king, who had in the meantime repaired from Caere to Tarquinii. The Vitellii, Aquririi, and the two sons of Brutus, (who himself was married to a sister of the Vitellii,) were accomplices in the conspiracy.3 The senate having decreed that the property left behind at Eome should be given up to the exiles; the ambassadors, while making preparations for carrying away the goods, rigorously prosecuted their treacherous scheme. But a slave, who had overheard all that was planned, at a banquet in the house of the Vitellii, and knew that the ambassadors were in possession of letters from their Eoman accomplices, denounced the whole affair to the consuls. The consuls forthwith ordered the conspirators to be arrested, and had them brought to trial. Their guilt was established beyond a doubt ; and Brutus con- demned his own sons to death, by virtue of the power he had over them as their father. The same verdict was | pronounced 3 We have already noticed the in- consistency of the story which makes Brutus a juvenis a short time before the revolution, and in the very year of the revolution describes him as the father of two sons old enough to join in a treasonable plot. See p. 89. /"], [119, "THE TARQUINS ATTEMPT TO RETURN. 99 against the others ; but being patricians, they had a right to appeal to their peers. The example of Brutus, however, left the curiae no choice, and all the criminals were scourged and beheaded. The promise of the senate, to restore the property to the exries, was retracted on the discovery of the conduct of the ambas sadors, and all the king's goods were abandoned to the plunder of the populace. The estates of the Tarquins were distributed among the plebeians, in parcels of seven jugers each, whereby those who received allotments acquired a personal interest in assisting to prevent the return of the Tarquins. These estates were con secrated to Mars, and were afterwards called the Field of Mars (Campus Martins). The com which grew there was just ripe ; but as the people were scrupulous about the propriety of con suming it, they took the sheaves, and threw them all into the river, which happened to be very shallow. The sheaves and baskets ran against one another: their course was checked; and) as they accumulated, they formed the island in the Tiber known by the name of insula Tiberina,4 which afterwards became sacred to the god Aesculapius. When the news of these occurrences were brought to Tarquinius, for the ambassadors had been allowed to depart unmolested, he at once resolved on waging war against Eome ; and as he promised the Tarquinians andVeientines that the districts whichBome had taken from them, should be restored to them, they joined lrim with large armies. The Eoman consuls marched out to meet their enemies : Valerius commanded the infantry, and Brutus the cavalry. The Etruscan cavalry was in the command of the king's son Aruns, who, on recognising Brutus, galloped against him with all his might. Brutus, no less gallant, did the same; and the shock with wlrich the two rushed against each other was so vehement, that both fell dead from their horses. The infantry then took up the fight, which lasted all day. In the evening, both armies, being- 4 It scarcely requires to be observed See Gellius, vi. 7 ; Plut.

F 2"], [120, "100 HISTORY OF ROME. equally worn out, withdrew to their camps; though neither party would admit that they were vanquished. But in the night the voice of the god Silvanus was heard saying, that the Etruscans had lost one man more than the Eomans, and that victory belonged to the latter. This voice filled the Etruscans with terror, and they immediately took to flight. On the following morning Valerius, on seeing that the enemy was gone, collected the spoils, and returned to Eome in triumph. This battle was fought near the forest of Arsia. Valerius solemnized the burial of Brutus with great splendour ; but his loss was felt so deeply by the people, that the Eoman matrons mourned for him a whole year as for a father. His statue was placed in the Capitol, amid those of the Eoman kings. As P. Valerius did not cause a successor to Brutus to be elected, and as he was at the same time building for himself a stone house on the top of the Velia, in a lofty and strong position, the people suspected him of aiming at kingly power. He lirinself was una ware of any such thing ; but when he was told of the rumours that were afloat, he stopped the building ; and baring convoked the assembly of the curiae, he appeared before them with his fasces lowered, a sign that he respected the majesty of the people, and regarded them as the source of Iris power. This display of deference to them created great delight among the people : they granted him a piece of land in the ascent of the Velia, and conferred upon him the privilege of having the doors of his house opening into the street. In order to prove still more to the people how little he was inclined to revive the kingly dignity, and how seriously he thought even of restraining the consular power within certain limits he enacted several laws, which were so agreeable to the people that they honoured him with the surname of Publicola, that is, the man who honours the populus. One of these laws allowed a citizen, who had been condemned by a magistrate to be fined, scourged, or put to death, to appeal to the assembly of the people. This law of course referred only to the plebeians, who"], [121, "P. VALERIUS PUBLICOLA. 101 thus obtained the right of appeal to the assembly of the plebeian tribes ;5 for the patricians had always been in the enjoyment of the right of appeal to the curiae. This right of appeal, however, did not extend beyond one mile from the city ; for there the magistrate might avail himself of his imperium against patricians as well as plebeians.6 Another law of Valerius enacted that any one who should be convicted of aiming at regal power, or should exercise any authority with which he was not invested by the peo ple, should be devoted with all his substance to the gods.' When these laws were passed, he convened the assembly of the centuries for the election of a successor to Brutus. The new consul was Sp. Lucretius, but as he was a man much advanced in years, who died a few days after his election, the people chose in his place M. Horatius Pulvillus. An event soon occurred which created jealousy between the two consuls and their friends. The temple of Jupiter, on the Capitol, had not yet been dedicated ; and as each consul was anxious to perform the solemnity, they drew lots ; but fortune favoured Horatius. The friends of Valerius tried by all means to throw obstacles in the way, but in vain. At the moment when Horatius was grasping the door-post of the temple, some one suddenly called out to him that his son had died, and that under these circumstances he ought not to per form so solemn an act ; but Horatius exclaimed, \" It concerns me not,\" and completed the dedication. The ides of September, on which the dedication took place, was the beginning of a new era ; and an account of it was kept by a nail being driven into the wall of the temple every year on the same day. One of the most interesting events of the first year of the republic, and one which is established by better authority than any other of the same time, is the first treaty that Eome con cluded with Carthage. Polybius,3 the only writer who has noticed the treaty and rescued it from oblivion, translated it 5 Liv. iii. 55, x. 9 ; Dionys. ix. 39. 7 Liv. ii. 8 ; Dionys. v. 19 ; Plut. 6 Liv. iii. 20 ; Gaius, iv. 105. Public. 11, &c. 8 iii. 22."], [122, "102 HISTORY OF ROME. from brazen tables then existing in the Capitol, in the archives of the aediles. The language of the treaty was so obsolete, that in some parts even the more learned among the Eomans could only guess at the meaning. From this treaty we learn that Eome, at the time when it was concluded, ruled over the whole coast of Latium, from the mouth of the Tiber to Terraeina ; that Eome made stipulations in behalf of Ardea, Antium, Aricia, Circeri, and Terraeina ; that the Eomans and their confederates promised not to sail into any of the harbours south of Cape Her maeum, which formed the eastern boundary of the gulph of Carthage ; that in Sicily, the Eoman merchants were to have the same privileges as the Carthaginians ; that they were allowed to trade at Carthage, on the coast of Libya west of Carthage, and in Sardinia. This treaty with the great commercial republic of Carthage opens at once a wide field of speculation, inasmuch as we here find Eome in a relation of which her legendary his tory has not preserved a trace. It is worthy of remark, that the treaty mentions Brutus and Horatius as the two consuls under whom it was concluded, a circumstance which is irreconcilable with the common traditions, in which Brutus and Horatius were not consuls at the same time, but the latter was the successor of the former. In this manner the first year of the republic passed away, and P. Valerius was elected consul a second trine with T. Lucretius. The exiled king, who with his family, had in the meantime taken refuge with Porsenna, the lord (Lar) or king of Clusium, in Etru ria, prevailed upon him to make war against Eome. Porsenna accordingly marched with a formidable army into the territory of the republic.9 The Eomans were alarmed in the highest degree, for never had so powerful an enemy appeared in the neighbour hood of the city : everything, that could be devised, was done to please the people (the plebeians) ; and thus to make them hold out 9 Dionysius makes Octavius Mami- lius and the Latins join the Etruscans; but this is a mere fiction, arising from the notion that the son-in-law of Tar quinius could not have been idle dur ing the struggle."], [123, "103 WAR WITH PORSENNA. firmly against the mighty invader. The Janiculum was taken at once by the Etruscans ; and the Eoman garrison of that fort took refuge within the city, which was now separated from the enemy only by the wooden bridge (pons sublicius). As the Etruscans advanced towards it, the Eomans fled, with the exception of Horatius Codes, who had been appointed to guard it, and his com rades Sp. Larcius and T. Herminius. While the Eomans were flying across, Horatius kept off the assailing host, and bade the Eomans tear down the bridge, as soon as they reached the other side. The three heroes stood like rocks against thousands of enemies ; but at length Horatius commanded his comrades to return to the city; and he alone resisted the foes, until the shouts of the workmen and the crash of the timber annoimced to him that all were safe, and that the bridge was torn down. He then prayed to the god of the Tiber, that he would save him and his arms, and dashed into the stream. Amid the showers of the enemy's arrows he swam across to the city. His grateful fellow citizens afterwards erected a statue to him in the comitium, and gave him as much land as he could plough round in a day.10 The Etruscans now besieged Eome, which began to suffer from famine. The citizens testified their gratitude to Horatius, by bringing him all the provisions they could stint themselves of. When the famine was raging very high, and there appeared to be no hope of saving Eome, C. Mucius, a noble youth, with the sanction of the senate, went across the Tiber with the intention of killing king Porsenna with a sword which he had concealed under his garment. He understood the Etruscan language, and made his way up to the king's tent ; but mistaking a scribe, who was transacting business with the soldiers, for the king, he ran his sword through the scribe. As he attempted to force his wTay back through the surrounding crowd, the king's attendants seized him and brought him before their master. Mucius frankly declared 10 This is of course a poetical exag- the very wealthiest Romans of later geration, and quite incompatible with times. the amount of land possessed even by"], [124, "104 HISTORY OF ROME. what had been his intention, and told the king that there were many more, who were bold and resolute enough to follow his example. The enraged king forthwith ordered a fire to be kindled to wrench from Mucius by torture an explanation of the vague threat he had held out ; but Mucius, to show that such things could not intimidate him, thrust his right hand into the flame which was burning on the altar. The king, amazed at this unequalled courage and defiance, rose from his seat and bade him depart in peace. Mucius then informed him that there were 300 young Eomans who had sworn to destroy him, and would without fail accomplish what he himself had not succeeded in. Mucius, who henceforth bore the surname of Scaevola from his having only his left (scaevus) hand, returned to Eome.11 He was immediately followed by ambassadors from Porsenna, who was anxious to get out of the perilous position in which he found himself through the revelation of Mucius, and now proposed terms of peace. It was in vain that he demanded the restoration of Tarquinius : the Eomans however consented to give back to the Veientines the seven districts (pagi) which had been taken from them; and to give hostages for the withdrawal of the Etruscan garrison from the Janiculum. Peace was thus concluded; and Porsenna with his army withdrew from the Eoman territory. After such heroic deeds of the men, the Eoman women also resolved upon winning laurels for themselves. Cloeria, one of the female hostages whom Porsenna had taken with him, con trived with the other maidens to escape from the Etruscan camp, and swam across the Tiber amid the darts of the pursuers. She brought her friends back in safety to their parents at Eome. The king, on hearing of it, sent envoys to demand the surrender of the hostages ; and the Eomans faithful- to their treaty, sent Cloeria and her companions back : Porsenna, acting in a no less chivalrous spirit, treated her with honour and distinction, and allowed her to set free any of the young damsels she pleased. 11 He was rewarded with a piece of which was in after-times known by the land, on the Etruscan side of the river, name of prata Mucia."], [125, "WAR WITH PORSENNA. 105 She chose the youngest, as being most in need of protection, because most exposed to danger. Peace was then renewed, and the Eomans honoured Cloeria with an equestrian statue, which was set up at the top of the sacred road (via sacra). This is the story about the war with Porsenna, such as it was celebrated in poetry and corrupted and disfigured by the vanity of the Eomans, who could uot prevail upon themselves to own that their city had once been the prey of a foreign conqueror. But that Eome did fall, and fall very low, is implied in several features of the story itself, in spite of all attempts to disguise it ; and Tacitus 12 clearly and expressly acknowledges that Eome was forced to sur- render to Porsenna. Pliny13 informs us, that among the con- ditions of peace which the conqueror dictated to Eome, there was 'one forbidding the Eomans the use of iron except for agricultural purposes ; and a people who were obliged to submit to such a condition, must surely have been compelled to deliver up all their arms. Now although there is, in the tradition of this war, per- haps not a single fact that can stand the test of criticism, there cannot be the slightest doubt that Porsenna for a time was lord of Eome, which had yielded up its sovereignty to him. This is also implied in the statement that the Eoman senate sent him an ivory throne and the other badges of royalty ;14 and we may safely believe that Eome, when she recovered her independence, was obliged to give up to her conqueror a large portion of her terri- tory, for on this supposition alone is it intelligible, how in the year B.C. 495, the Eoman territory had no more than 21 tribes or regions out of the 30 instituted by Servius Tullius.15 Livy compresses the whole war with Porsenna into the space of one year, whereas others state that it was carried on for three suc cessive years. The evacuation of the Janiculum did not in all probability take place until Eome had regained her independence. The Eomans, in forging their account of the war with Porsenna, seem to have forgotten that it is a more glorious thing to liberate 14 Dionys. v. 35. 16 Liv. ii. 21 ; comp, above, p. 72. 12 Histor. iii. 72. 13 Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 39. f3"], [126, "106 HISTORY OF ROME. oneself from the yoke of a foreign conqueror, than to make the vain boast of having never been conquered. From Eome, either during her reduction or after her restora tion, Porsenna sent his son Aruns with a detachment of his troops to lay siege to Alicia, probably with a view of making him self master of all Latium ; but Aruns fell in battle, and a small band only escaped to Eome in a most wretched condition. The Eomans received them with great kindness, nursed the wounded, and provided them with all they wanted. Some of these Etrus cans afterwards returned to their own country, but others remained at Eome, where a place was assigned to them which was subsequently named after them the Tuscus vicus. Porsenna had in the meantime returned to Clusium, and again sent envoys to Eome respecting the restoration of Tarquinius, whom the tradition loses sight of throughout the war with Por senna. But the Eomans remaining firm in their determination, Porsenna at length declared, that he would no further inter fere on behalf of the exiles ; and in order not to be outdone by the Eomans in generosity, he sent back the hostages who were yet in his power, as well as restored to Eome the Veientine dis tricts which had before been taken from her. Porsenna is thus made to display his liberality towards Eome at the cost of his own airies. But how little confidence can be placed in these accounts is evident from the fact, that more than fifty years later Eome had no possessions on the Etruscan side of the Tiber, with the exception of the Janiculum and the district of the Vatican. The defeat of the Etruscans at Aricia may be regarded as histo rical, and it was probably this defeat which afforded Eome an opportunity of shaking off their yoke. The property which Por senna on quitting Eome left behind him, and at the disposal of the Eomans, was sold by public auction, which gave rise to the symbolical custom at auctions of selling the goods of king Por senna. This custom lasted down to the end of the republic. Livy himself found it difficult to explain how such a custom could have arisen, if Porsenna had parted from Eome in friend-"], [127, "107 THE CLAUDII. ship. Henceforth the Etruscan king disappears from history. The mythical character of the stories about lrim is further evident from the sepulchral monument which the Etruscans are said to have erected to him, which is as inconceivable as anything described in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments.16 All that can be said with certainty is, that at one time Eome was subject to an Etruscan conqueror ; but whether this conquest belongs to the time to which tradition assigns it, or to an earlier period, must be left uncertain. After the peace with Porsenna, Tarquinius withdrew to his son-in-law, Mamilius Octavius, at Tuscidum. The Eomans, after having recovered their independence, again provided themselves with arms, and carried on wars with some of the Sabine towns, in which they were victorious. Disputes among the Sabines themselves, as to whether peace should be concluded with the Eomans, or the war continued, induced the proud Sabine, Atta Clausus, afterwards called Appius Claudius, to migrate with his family and a host of clients to Eome. The Claudii received the Eoman franchise, and were raised to the rank of patricians : they formed the Claudian tribe, lands being assigned to them beyond the river Anio. The consuls then marched into the country of the Sabines, and a victory which they gained over them did away with all fear of further aggression from that quarter. In the same year, B.C. 503, died Valerius Pubbcola, the greatest hero of the time : he was honoured with a burial at the public expense, and the Eoman matrons mourned for him as they had done for Brutus. About the same time a war was carried on with the Auruncans, the towns of Cora and Pometia having revolted against Eome and joined the Auruncans. On the first encounter the Aurun cans were put to flight, and the war became concentrated about Pometia, which was besieged ; but the Eomans were worsted and returned home. Soon after the Eomans made another attempt upon Pometia, with more success, for the town was 16 Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxxvi. 19, \u00a7 3, &c."], [128, "108 HISTORY OF ROME. obliged to surrender, and most of its inhabitants were put to the sword or sold as slaves, and the town itself was razed to the ground.17 In B.C. 501, a more serious war broke out with the Latins. It is described in detail by Dionysius, although it is anything but historical. Livy passes over it very rightly, and only relates the great and decisive battle of Lake Eegrilus, which he places in B.C. 499, while others, and among them Dionysius, place it four years later. The whole affair, however, is only an heroic lay ; for though the Eomans are said to have won a complete victory, yet after several years of inactivity, B.C. 493, they con clude a treaty with Latium, in which the Latins are placed on a footing of equality with the Eomans \u2014 the very object for which the Latins are said to have fought the battle of Lake Eegillus. Thirty Latin townships, it is said, had conspired against Eome, at the instigation of Mamilius Octavius. Under these alarming circumstances, the Eomans appointed a dictator to conduct the war against the Latins. His name, according to the earliest writers, was T. Larcius. The office of dictator, which had existed at Alba and in other Latin towns long before this time, conferred upon the person invested with it a more unlimited power than had been possessed by the kings, for he had the imperium within the city, and from his sentence there was no appeal. In this manner the patricians, from among whom alone the dictator could be chosen, were enabled to coerce the plebeians when they refused to take up arms against the Latins.18 Whether any thing was undertaken by the dictator against the Latins, is uncertain, but his appointment kept the Sabines in awe, and the '7 The account of this war is very nearly the same as that against the Volscians (Liv. ii. 22.) which is placed ten years later. Perhaps the one is only a repetition of the other. 18 A dictator was appointed only for six months, on the proposal of the senate ; he was always taken from among the consulars, or the men who had been consuls. His original title was magister populi. Another officer who was always appointed along with him, and stood under him, bore the title of magister equitum, or com mander of the horse. In the earlier times he was chosen by the senate, but afterwards by the dictator himself."], [129, "109 WAR AGAINST THE LATINS. plebeians in quiet submission. However, in the year after, Fidenae was besieged, Crustumeria taken, and Praeneste, which deserted the cause of the Latins, joined the Eomans. As the contest between the two nations began to take a serious turn, both engaged to keep peace for a time,19 that the various ties among their citizens might be peaceably dissolved. All the women of each nation who were married in the other obtained leave to return to their relatives, taking their daughters with them ; accordingly the Eoman women left their Latin husbands, and all the Latin women, with the exception of two, quitted Eome. When these things were settled, A. Postumius was appointed dictator, and T. Aebutius his master of the horse. The Eomans marched out towards the Lake Eegillus, in the territory of Tuscu lum. A report that the exiled king Tarquinius was in the army of the Latins so much enraged the Eomans, that they attacked the enemy at once. The battle which now ensued, according to the description in Livy,20 is, as Niebuhr remarks, \"a conflict between heroes like those in the Iliad. All the heroes encounter, hand to hand, and by them the victory is thrown now into one scale, now into another, while the troops fight without any effect.\" It would be idle here to give an account of the battle ; suffice it to say, that most of the heroes fell, and that the Eoman equites at length decided the victory, by routing the vanquished enemy. A tem ple had been vowed by the dictator to the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux), and two gigantic youths on white horses were seen fight ing in the Eoman ranks : before the pursuit of the Latins was over, the two divine heroes appeared at Eome, and announced the happy event of the day to the people assembled in the comitium. This glorious battle concludes the mythical period of Eoman history; and though the subsequent history is still much mixed up with fables and lays, we feel that we have reached historical 19 What here follows is a genuine preserved in Dionysius, vi. 1. fragment of the ancient lay, and is :\u00b0 ii. 19, &c."], [130, "110 HISTORY OF ROME. ground. Sextus Tarquinius had fallen in the battle ; but his father had only been wounded, and escaped to Cuma, where he died in B.C. 496, leaving his property to Aristodemus, the tyrant of Cuma. The traditions of this Latin war lead us to believe that so long as Tarquinius was abve, and Eome was threatened by dangers from without, the patricians did all they could to keep the plebeians, who formed the main strength of the Eoman armies, in good humour ; and when they did not succeed by such means, the appointment of a dictator was an efficient way of compelbng them to obedience. It is expressly stated that in the year of Tarquinius' death the patricians began to trample upon the plebeians."], [131, "111 CHAPTEE VII.

WARS AGAINST VEII, THE VOLSCIANS AND AEQUI- ANS. PUBLILIUS VOLERO, TERENT1LLUS ARSA, AND THE INTERNAL STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE TWO ESTATES. The plebeians, who ever since the estabbshment of the repubbc had been obbged to shed their blood in her wars, and were sub ject to the most rigorous laws at home, had been kept quiet, partly by mildness and moderation in times of danger, partly by the terror of a. dictator ; but no sooner had the outward danger disappeared and Tarquinius died, than the patricians at once threw off the mask, and indidged in every kind of oppression that aristocratic pride and insatiable avarice could devise. General poverty and debts were frequently the causes of great civil com motions in the states of antiquity ; and such was the case at Rome also. But the commotions which there occurred, far from leading to the dissolution or overthrow of the constitution, as they would probably have done in other states, were only the means of its natural development and improvement. The distress and poverty of the plebeians must have been gra dually increasing, ever since their incorporation with the Roman state ; for, not to mention the hardslups and oppression to which they were subjected by the last king, they had been obliged during the uninterrupted wars to serve in the armies and to pay the tribute ; and thus were unable to attend to their farms and fields, which were neglected, and ravaged by foreign enemies. The consequence was, that the impoverished plebeians were"], [132, "112 HISTORY OF ROME. obliged to borrow money of the wealthy patricians at an exorbi- tant rate of interest. Now a creditor at Eome, as at Athens previous to the legislation of Solon, might by law deprive Iris in- solvent debtor of his freedom and life;1 nay, even the children and grandchildren of an insolvent debtor might be thrown into the pri- vate dungeons of the nobles, in which, down to a very late period, they were kept as slaves :2 for the law was that, if a debtor, within a certain period after the debt had been proved before the ma- gistrate, was unable to satisfy his creditor, he was given over to him as Iris bondsman ; that is, he became what was called his creditor's addictus. If, on the other hand, a person in borrow- ing money of another disposed of himself and all that belonged to him, he became a nexus or nexu vinctus; that is, he formally sold himself and all he possessed by his own act and deed.3 A person who had thus disposed of himself, in the form of a sale, remained in possession of his rjledge, that is, of Iris own person, for the time ; after the lapse of which he had to redeem himself by re- paying the borrowed money. If it was not repaid, the creditor laid claim to the debtor's property. Persons who had no pro- perty to pledge must always have contracted their loans under the form of a sale, and any one who dreaded becoming an addictus might pledge Iris person or become a nexus, in order to escape the greater misfortune ; for as a nexus he might pay off his debt by labour, whereas as an addictus he was at once thrown into prison and became the slave of his creditor. If, however, a nexus was unable to pay Iris debt in any way, the magistrate declared him an addictus; and his lot was chains, corporal punishment, and all the hardslrips of slavery. The number of addicti and nexi must have been very great at the time when Tarquinius Superbus 'died ; and as the plebeians were excluded from all share in the 1 It is said, that a law prohibiting a debtor from pledging his person had been promulgated by king Servius Tullius, that it was abolished by the last Tarquinius, and again enacted by Valerius Publicola.

Such a state of things could not last long, and, as it usually happens, one spark only was needed to bring about the confla gration. In the consulship of Appius Claudius and P. Servilius, B.C. 495, an old man, in a most miserable and emaciated condi tion, rushed into the forum, showing the bloody stripes on his back, and telling the people his history, which undoubtedly was the same as that of many hundred others : he had served in several wars, his farm had been ravaged and burnt, and his cattle driven away ; in order to pay his taxes he had been obbged to run into debt ; the usurious interest had at length deprived him of his estate, and he had been compelled by his creditor to work as a slave. The excitement created by this occurrence soon spread through the whole city. Numbers of persons who had reason to fear a similar fate, as well as many who were actuated by a feering of humanity, were seized with indignation ; and large crowds assembled in the forum. The senate, and the consuls, were undecided as to what should be done ; but Appius Claudius, rich and greedy, and haughty and insolent like all the members of his family, was bent upon quieting the rioters by force, while his colleague tried to appease the excited multitude by gentle means. As these things were going on, messengers from the country announced that a Volscian army was on its road to Eome, intending to lay siege to the city. The plebeians were forthwith called upon to enlist in the legions ; but they spurned the summons, declaring that they would rather see the whole republic perish than sacrifice themselves for the benefit of their tyrants and oppressors. At this critical moment, when com pulsion was impossible, P. Servilius issued a proclamation, that the complaints of the commonalty should be looked into after the war ; that no person imprisoned for debt should be hindered from serving, if he were willing; that no creditor should possess"], [134, "114 HISTORY OF ROME. or sell the property of any one serving in the army ; and that the children and grandchildren of the soldiers shoidd remain at liberty during the war. Upon this announcement, all the nexi gave in their names and took the military oath, and the consul was soon enabled to lead a spirited army into the field. The Volscians were defeated and put to flight ; their camp and the town of Suessa fell into the hands of the Eomans, and were given to the soldiers to plunder. The consul then returned with his victorious army to Eome. Ecetra obtained peace, but lost a part of its territory. A. Postumius, who had before been dictator, defeated the Sabines, who had made a predatory excursion on the banks of the Anio; and the Auruncans, who had likewise tried to derive advantages from the perUous situation of Eome, were beaten. After such brilliant achievements, the armies returned full of hope that justice woidd be done to them ; but they were bitterly deceived. Appius Claudius opposed every measure of humane and wise forbearance : those who had been slaves for debt were sent back to their prisons, and those who before had been only nexi were given up to their creditors as addicti ; in short, all the old horrible practices were renewed. But it was impossible to execute the tyrant's commands. Those who had served under P. Servilius applied to him for redress, and reminded him of his solemn promise ; but as Iris plans were opposed both by his col league and the whole body of the patricians, he coidd do nothing, and was despised and hated by both parties. The people were in open insurrection, and protected those whom Appius Claudius condemned. The Sabines again threatened Eome with a war, but the plebeians stedfastly refused to enlist in the legions. In this manner the year came to its close. The new consuls were commanded by the senate to raise an army, but they were unable to carry the command into effect, for the plebeians continued in their state of insurrection ; they held public and secret meetings on the Esquiline and Aventine, and demanded of the patricians to fulfil their promises before calling"], [135, "INSURRECTION OF THE PLEBS. 115 upon the plebeians to fight fresh battles. Whenever attempts were made to compel the people, scenes of violence occurred which threatened to end in general civil bloodshed. Some pa tricians advised to purchase peace by granting what the insurgents demanded ; some would insist upon treating with those only who had served in the late campaign ; wlrile a third party, headed by Appius Claudius, obstinately declared that the insurrection ought to be quelled by the appointment of a dictator. Appius Claudius would have been invested with the office, had it not been for the fear lest things should come to extremes at a moment when Eome was threatened by the Sabines, Volscians, and Aequians. The more moderate party therefore prevailed, and M. Valerius was created dictator. The plebeians had confidence in the family of the Valerri ; they allowed themselves to be enlisted ; and an army consisting, it is said, of ten legions, was soon, ready to take the field. The consuls marched against the Volscians and Ae quians, and gained brilliant victories. Valerius led the troops against the Sabines, who were put to flight in a fierce battle, and their camp was taken ; Velitrae also fell into the hands of the victors ; and the dictator returned to Eome in triumph, and was rewarded with distinguished honours. Faithful to his promise, he demanded that the condition of the plebeians shoidd be inves tigated ; and as the infatuated senate refused, he resigned his dictatorship. The plebeians, seeing it was not his faidt that they were again deceived, conducted him to his house ; but the sena tors fearing lest the consular armies, when disbanded, shoidd again hold their secret and nocturnal meetings, ordered the legions to remain in arms, under the pretext that the Aequians were renewing their hostilities. This order drove the army into open rebellion. The soldiers appointed L. Sicinius their leader, crossed the river Anio, and took up a strong position on the Sacred Mount, in the neighbourhood of Crustumerium.4 The 1 Hence Varro, L. L. v. 81, calls cause on leaving it the plebeians con the secession Secessio Crustumerina. secrated it to Jupiter. Some writers The mount was called the Sacred, be- say that the plebeians seceded only to"], [136, "116 HISTORY OF ROME. consuls and patricians returned to Eome, and the plebeians for some days remained quiet in their camp, merely waiting to see what the patricians were going to do. This secession of the plebs caused the greatest alarm and consternation at Eome ; and as it was manifest that force would be of no avari, the senate despatched an embassy of ten men, headed by Menenius Agrippa, to treat with the insurgents.5 When they were admitted into the camp, Menenius Agrippa is said to have addressed the people, and to have related to them the well-known fable of the Belly and the Members, which refused to render their ordinary service to the belly, in consequence of which, not only that part, but all the members and the whole body had to suffer. The plebeians understood the moral of the fable, and were ready to treat with the deputies. A solemn compact was concluded, which was to bind all Eoman citizens, both patricians and plebeians. In order to form a correct esti mate of the terms of this treaty, it must be observed, that in the meantime the patricians had contrived to gain the interest of the Latins, through a treaty which was concluded with them by Sp. Cassius during the secession of the plebs, of which treaty we shall say more presently. The terms of the compact between the two orders were, that all the contracts of insolvent debtors were to be cancelled, and that all those who had been made slaves, on account of debts, should be restored to freedom.6 The effect of these concessions was of course only momentary; for the laws of debt themselves, not being touched, remained the same as they had been before. But an important and permanent advantage was gained at that time in the institution of the tribimes of the plebs. The sole object of their office then was to afford the plebeians the Aventine ; but the contradiction may be removed by the supposition, that the soldiers assembled on the Sacred Mount,wbile the otherplebeians, who were not under arms at the time, gathered from the city and other parts and occupied the Aventine. 5 Liv. ii. 32 ; Dionys. vi. 69. Cicero (Brut. 14) describes the recon ciliation between the two orders as the work of the dictator Valerius. 6 Dionys. vi. 83 ; Cic. De Re Publ. ii. 34."], [137, "THE COMPACT AFTER THEIR SECESSION. 117 protection against any abuse of a consul's authority. The per son of a tribune was sacred : any one who violated the person of a tribune was declared an outlaw, so that any one might kill the offender ; and his house was forfeited to the temple of Ceres. As a tribune was a public guardian, his house was kept open day and night for all who were in want of his succour, either against a magistrate or a private individual. The tribunes further pre sided in the assemblies of the plebeian tribes : they might bring before them any proposal they thought fit ; and if any one im peded them in so doing, they had the power to arraign him before the commonalty, and propose a fine to be inflicted on him : if the offender refused paying the fine, his property was forfeited. Another great power of the tribunes consisted in their veto, or their right of intercession, by which they might stop any act of a ma gistrate or decree of the senate ; for they were allowed to sit at the entrance of the senate-hall, and thus to hear all that was going on within. The senate henceforth appears as the guardian of the patrician order, while the tribunes watched the interests of the commonalty, and the two therefore are natural antagonists. The mere preventive character, however, which the tribunes ori ginally possessed, gradually rose to a preponderating, and, in the end, to an overwhelming power, before which consuls and dic tators were made to tremble. The people had now acquired an organ through which they could give utterance to their wishes and wants, and this is the first element in the development of a free constitution. From this time we must date the struggle between the two orders, the plebeians being resolved to acquire an equality of rights with the patricians, and the latter being just as obstinate in preserving their exclusive rights. For a long time the plebeians indeed continued to recognise certain privi leges of the nobles; but they earned on the contest with a perse verance, forbearance, and moderation, of which there is scarcely a parallel in the history of the world. The main causes of this gradual advancement of the plebeians were, on the one hand, the reverence with which the Eomans at all times treated the ancient"], [138, "118 HISTORY OF ROME. and time-hallowed institutions of their country, their respect for estabbshed laws, and their love of civil order ; and, on the other, the intrigues of the patricians, who frequently either disturbed the meetings of the plebeians, or contrived to set the tribunes against one another. The number of tribunes first appointed was two, who immediately after chose three more as their col leagues.7 The number five had reference to the five classes ; one tribune being chosen from each. The tribunes were elected in the assembly of the centuries, subject to the sanction of the curiae.8 Another class of plebeian officers, whose institution is likewise connected with the secession to the Sacred Mount, were the aediles (aediles plebis), who formed a sort of plebeian police, and acted as judges in cases referred to them by the tribunes. At a later period they also had the superintendence of markets, and of the archives kept in the temple of Ceres. In this man ner the internal peace of the republic was restored, and the ple beians returned to their usual occupations. During the secession of the plebeians, the consul Sp. Cassius concluded a treaty with the Latin confederacy, the terms of which were ratified by a solemn sacrifice : it was agreed that peace shoidd be for ever estabbshed between the two commonwealths ; neither shoidd make war against the other, or instigate a foreign nation to do so, or lend its assistance ; when one suffered damages or vexation from a foreign enemy, the other was to render it pro tection, help, and succour ; booty, and everything gained in war, was to be equally divided ; the command of the joined armies was to belong alternately to a Eoman and a Latin ; and, lastly, no alteration was to be made in this compact without the con sent of both parties. It is scarcely required to observe that the 7 Some writers state that the addi tion of three tribunes to the original number of two belongs to a later date, Liv. ii. 58 ; and Cicero further states that in the year after the secession the number of tribunes was raised from two to ten ; but this is an evident mis- take, for we know on good authority that it was not till the year b.c 456 that the number of tribunes was raised to ten. 8 Some writers absurdly attribute the election of the tribunes to the curiae."], [139, "119 VOLSCIAN WAR. right of contracting legal marriages between persons of the two states continued to exist.9 Eome was thus strengthened against foreign enemies ; and in the struggles of the patricians against the plebeians, the former could always rely on the support of the allies. But the equality established between the two nations could not be of very long duration, for Eome coidd not bear the feeling of sharing her power with another state : her ambition was too boundless, and she gradually assumed a superiority at the common diet, where the affairs of the allied states were dis cussed ; until, after the lapse of somewhat more than a century, Eome's arrogance brought about the final dissolution of the Latin confederacy. The secession of the plebs had taken place during the autumn of the year B.C. 493, and the fields and the harvest had been completely neglected ; the consequence was that in the next year Eome was visited by dearth and famine. Envoys were sent to Campania, Etruria, and Sicily, to obtain the necessary provisions ; and in B.C. 491, Gelo of Syracuse is said to have been generous enough not to accept the money for a large supply of corn, which had been purchased in the port of his capital.10 While Eome was struggling with these difficulties, a war was carried on against the Volscians, which is said to have com menced in the year of the secession, and to have been conducted by Postumus Cominius, the codeague of Sp. Cassius. After the conquest of a few towns, the Eomans besieged Corioli, which was taken through the gallantry of a young patrician, C. Marcius, who, from this event, received the surname of Coriolanus. Had not the Volscians at this time been visited by a plague, they would again have fallen upon the starving Eomans ; who, in order to secure themselves against foreign enemies, founded several colonies, which served as strongholds and garrisons against hostile attacks. The plebeians naturally suffered most under these circumstances ; and when the supply of corn arrived 9 Dionys. vi. 95 ; Festus, s. v. concileable with chronology, for Gelo praetor ad portam. was not then tyrant of Syracuse. 10 This statement however is irre-"], [140, "120 HISTORY OF ROME. from Sicriy, the selfish and hard-hearted patricians bethought themselves whether it would not be feasible to make the ple beians seU for bread the rights which they had gained by their secession. Marcius Coriolanus was the most avowed enemy of the plebeians and their tribunes ; and it was he who suggested the treacherous thought to his fellow-patricians. The senate itself thought the scheme too inhuman ; and the plebeians would have torn Coriolanus to pieces as he came out of the senate, had not the tribunes interfered. They impeached him before the commonalty, charging him with attempting to destroy the com pact entered into by the two estates on the Sacred Mount.11 The exasperation of the plebeians was as great as the exertions and intrigues of the patricians to prevent the trial of their champion, or to obtain his acquittal. As he did not appear on the day fixed for the trial, he was condemned in his absence, and escaped to the Volscians, threatening to invade his country at the head of a foreign army. The Volscians were glad at the arrival of a powerful Eoman who was ready to assist them in their wars against Eome ; and Attius Tullius, the most distinguished among them, and the most inveterate enemy of the Eomans, received him hospitably into his house. There was at the time no war with the Volscians; but as the Eomans demanded of all the Volscians who happened to be staying among them forthwith to quit the city, the in dignation of the Volscians was roused, and war was decreed at once. Attius Tullius and Coriolanus were entrusted with the joint command of the Volscian army. The latter marched against Circeri ; he expeUed the Eoman colonists from the place, and delivered up the town into the hands of the Volscians. In like 11 Niebuhr justly remarks, that the powers said to have been exercised by the tribunes, in the proceedings against Coriolanus, cannot have been possessed by them at that early time ; consider ing, moreover, that there was no motive then for a Sicilian tyrant to support Rome, and that Gelo was not yet tyrant of Syracuse, Niebuhr concludes, that the story of Coriolanus belongs to a much later date, and has been inserted here by mistake. The whole legend of Coriolanus is full of contradictions ; for Corioli, e.g., at the time when he is said to have taken it, was a Latin town, and in alliance with Rome."], [141, "CORIOLANUS. 121 manner he took a great number of other towns, steaddy advanc ing towards Eome. At length he pitched his camp near the Chririan ditch, and ravaged the country in the vicinity of Eome, leaving the estates of the patricians unhurt. The plebeians were unwilling to fight, and the senate at length resolved to send ambas sadors to Coriolanus to prevail upon him to desist from his hostile acts towards his country. But they were haughtily received and sent back with a scornful answer. A second embassy was not admitted into the camp ; and it was even in vain that the priests, attired in their sacred robes, went to him as suppliants. At length his mother, Veturia, and his wife, Volumnia, with her two young children, accompanied by many other Eoman matrons, proceeded to the camp of Coriolanus. What the am bassadors of the senate, and the priests of the gods had been unable to effect, was accompbshed by the tears and entreaties of the women. Coriolanus broke up his camp, and led his legions away from the Boman territory. Some traditions related that he died immediately after, overwhelmed with shame and repent ance ; whereas, according to others, he continued to bve among the Volscians, and died an old man. The temple of Fortuna Muliebris was said to have been dedicated in commemoration of the debvery of Eome by the women. It is a remarkable fact, that the ancient songs, from which the above story of Coriolanus was derived, praised him as a just and pious man.12 The whole story seems to be based upon the fact, that Eome and Latium were at one time greatly humbled, and reduced to extremities by the Volscians; and that the latter and the Aequians, at the cost of the Latins, acquired a great increase of power, which they maintained for a long time afterward. It is true, the Eomans speak only of their own victories over these nations ; but we never hear of any permanent conquest, while we know that some of the Latin towns continued to be in the hands of the Volscians. Much that is untrue in the early his- 12 Dionys. viii. 62 ; Liv. ii. 40. G"], [142, "122 HISTORY OF ROME. tory of Eome arose from forgeries made to satisfy the national vanity of the Eomans, who, great as they were, seldom had the courage to own that they had been vanquished. After the withdrawal of Coriolanus, the Volscians and Aequians are said to have returned into the Eoman dominions ; but as the Aequians refused to acknowledge Attius Tullius as their com mander, the two nations became involved in a war, which saved Eome at once from two enemies. In the third consulship of Sp. Cassius and Proculus Virginius, b.c. 486, a league was con cluded with the Hernicans, on the same terms as that with the Latins, and by the same Sp. Cassius who had concluded the alliance with Latium. In the year previous to this treaty, the Hernicans are said to have been at war with Eome, and to have been conquered. Eome now concluded the treaty, with a view to strengthen herself against the Volscians and Aequians ; and henceforth the armies of the Eomans, Latins, and Hernicans took the field conjointly, and a third of the spoils, and the conquered territory, fell to the lot of each. This plain fact is strangely misrepresented by Livy,13 who says that two-thirds of the terri tory of the Hernicans was taken from them \u2014 a notion arising from his belief that the treaty was one of peace, and was con cluded after a war ; but that war is a mere fiction. The year of Cassius's third consulship is further remarkable for being the first in which we hear of an agrarian law at Eome. A large portion of the public land, that is, land conquered in war, and therefore the property of the populus or patricians, was possessed14 by private patricians. Sp. Cassius proposed that this land should be taken from the patricians, and distributed among the plebeians, who were yet without landed property, and who had a claim to it, since it had been conquered in war with their assistance.15 His 13 Liv. ii. 41; compare Dionys. the territory taken from the Hernicans in equal portions between the plebeians and Latins.

CASSIUS. 123 colleague and all the patricians, who were possessors of the public domain, opposed his scheme with all their might. It is surprising to find that the plebeians, who were to be benefited by his mea sure, did not support him as much as might have been expected ; but this lukewarmness may perhaps have arisen from jealousy, because he intended to confer the same benefit upon the two allied states. However, the law was enacted, though many years elapsed before the patricians could be induced to allow it to be carried into effect. When the year of his consulship was over, Sp. Cassius was impeached by the quaestors before the assembly of the curiae, which, being at once his enemy and his judge, con demned him to death. He was beheaded in b.c. 485, his house was destroyed, and the ground on which it had stood was cursed. Sp. Cassius must have been a great man, for he had been thrice consul, he had celebrated three triumphs, and concluded the treaties with the Latins and Hernicans ; his enemies themselves must have felt that they had outraged the feelings of humanity by his execution ; .and for the purpose of excusing themselves a report was spread, that he had aimed at making himself king of Eome. The selfishness, crimes, and tyranny of the patricians succeeded, for the present, in preventing the agrarian law from being carried into effect ; but the tribunes, watchful of the interests of their order, had become aware of the importance of the law, and repeatedly demanded its execution. In B.C. 481, the tribune Icdius made an unsuccessful attempt ; and in B.C. 473 the tribune Genucius, who arraigned the consuls before the commonalty for delaying to carry the law into effect, was assassinated by the patricians, who thus tried to intimidate other tribunes, and deter them from further attempts ; but all was of no avad, the greediness of the nobles was thwarted by the persevering energy of the plebeians. It is a singular phenomenon, that for a period of seven years, from B.C. 485 to B.C. 479, one of the places in the consulship was always filled by a member of the Fabian gens. It seems scarcely possible that this should have been a mere accident, and g2"], [144, "124 HISTORY OF ROME. it was perhaps an attempt of the old patrician gentes to establish an oligarchy ; but the attempt failed, for the minor patricians felt themselves disregarded and neglected, and for a time appear to have made common cause with the plebeians. The oppression practised upon the latter by the patricians of the major gentes, and the remembrance of the ignominious death of Sp. Cassius, raised up bold men among the plebeians, who demanded the execution of the Cassian agrarian law. In order to avert the threatening danger, the patricians stirred up wars. The Fabii were at first at the head of the high aristocracy ; and Q. Fabius, after having defeated the Aequians and Volscians, in B.C. 485, refused to allow the soldiers any share in the booty, which was sold, and the proceeds put into the pubbc treasury. In the year after, an attempt was made to restore the right of electing magistrates to the curiae, and to leave to the comitia of the centuries nothing but the pleasure of doing homage to the per sons elected, whereby the plebeians would have been excluded from exercising any influence upon the elections. The attempt succeeded for two years, and the men thus raised to the consul ship were such as were most odious to the plebeians. The latter at last displayed a most resolute obstinacy, and refused to serve in the wars that had been kindled by the patricians. The men were compelled to march into the field, but they were determined not to gain laurels for their commanders; and the consuls, derided by their soldiers, returned home without victory. The hatred of the plebeians was redoubled ; and it would seem that the patri cians of the major gentes formed a reconcibation with those of the minor gentes, for henceforth both again appear equady hostde to the plebeians. When the senate tried to raise the blood-thirsty App. Claudius to the consulship, the tribunes and the whole com monalty, as one man, opposed the illegal proceeding, and enforced the election by the centuries. C. Julius and Q. Fabius accord ingly were elected for the year B.C. 482 ; but after that time, and down to the decemvirate, one consul was invariably, and sometimes both, elected by the curiae on the proposal of the"], [145, "125 THE FABII. senate : the centuries elected the other, who was treated as an inferior officer, and was merely given to the first as his assistant. After the ridiculous campaign of Q. Fabius, the Fabri seem to have felt that it was a wretched honour to command over men who would not gain victories ; and they resolved to make friends with the commonalty.16 M. Fabius, in B.C. 480, gained the good-will of the plebeians. The soldiers followed his summons to a war against the Etruscans, and promised obedience. His brother Quintus fell in battle : Marcus won the favour of the plebeians still more, by the great care he took of the men who were wounded ; and henceforth the Fabii were the favourites of the plebeians. Kaeso Fabius, who was consul a third time in B.C. 479, immediately proposed that the lands taken in war should be distributed in equal portions among the plebeians ; \" for it is but just,\" said he, \"that those shoidd have it by whose sweat and blood it has been gained : \" but this same man had before been one of those who had condemned Sp. Cassius to death for having proposed the same thing. The patricians naturally treated him as an apostate, and revried him as infinitely more deserving of punishment than a plebeian tribune ; but the plebeians were all the more anxious to show their attachment to him : with their assistance he drove the Aequians back into. their country; and speedily returning, he saved his colleague, who was on the point of being defeated by the Veientines. After this victory, a fresh trial was made to bring about a reconciliation between the two estates ; but it faded, and the Fabia gens now offered to the senate to carry on the protracted war against Veii at its own expense. This strange offer can be accounted for only by the supposition, that the Fabii, owing to their conduct towards the plebeians, had fallen out with their brother patricians ; and that they now proposed to emigrate, in order to avoid an open rupture. The senate gladly accepted the offer ; and the Fabii, 306 in number, with a host of 4000 clients, emigrated, and took up a strong position on the banks of the 16 Liv. ii. 47."], [146, "126 HISTORY OF ROME. river Cremera. One member alone of the family remained at Rome, and there continued the race of the Fabii. This emigra tion of the Fabii was the theme of ancient songs among the Romans ; and the detail of their history must be viewed accord ingly. The war against Veii had been kindled by the patricians in B.C. 483, and as the Fabii were then at the head of the aris tocracy, they had undoubtedly been the foremost to stir it up ; but they had to pay dearly for their sin. We have already men tioned that the troops under K. Fabius would not fight, and abandoned then camp to the enemy ; an act which was followed by all the consequences of a defeat. The Etruscans, at the height of their power, aimed at nothing short of the entire subjugation of Rome ; but during the campaign of M. Fabius, the honour of the Roman name was restored, though not without great losses, for his colleague Cn. Manhus, and his brother Q. Fabius, were among the slain. The Aequians and Volscians were at the same time harassing and annoying the Latins ; and the troops, whom Rome was obliged to send to their relief, diminished the army engaged against the Veientines so much, that it would have been completely overpowered, had not K. Fabius, in B.C. 479, quickly come to its assistance. The Fabian emigrants gained repeated victories over the enemy, but their success rendered them less cautious than they ought to have been ; and on one occasion the Etruscans, who lay in ambush, fell upon them, and massacred them all, although the consul, T. Menenius, was not far distant, and might have saved them. This happened in B.C. 477 ; but the particular circumstances under which the Fabii fell, were described in different ways in the poetical traditions : 17 thus much, however, seems clear, that the Fabii were sacrificed by the neglect of the consul Menenius, who himself was attacked by the Etruscans immediately after, and defeated. Shortly after, the Etruscans ravaged the country, and ranged as far as the Janiculum, from which fortress the Romans were obliged to withdraw their garrison. Rome itself was be- 7 iv.ii. SO; Dionys.ix.19; Ovid. Fast. ii. 195, &c."], [147, "THE FABII. 127 sieged, but was saved by the arrival of C. Horatius from his Volscian campaign. For a while the Etruscans were satisfied with laying waste the country about Rome, which was suffering from want of provisions, for the city was crowded with fugitives from all parts of the country, and no supplies could be carried into it. The consuls, A. Virginius and Sp. Servilius (b.c. 476), at length ventured to cross the Tiber, to try to recover the Jani culum by storm ; but they were repulsed, and would have been driven into the river, had not the brave Virginius attacked the enemy in the rear. The Etruscans fled during the night, and a truce was concluded with them for a short period ; and when, in the year following, the consul Valerius had defeated the Veien tines close by the gates of Veii, peace was concluded for a period of forty years. During the truce with the Etruscans, two of the tribunes impeached T. Menenius for having neglected to save the Fabii on the Cremera. He was fined, and although the punishment was anything but severe, he is said to have shut himself up in his house, and to have died of grief. Henceforth tribunician im peachments occur almost every year. Thus in B.C. 475, C. Servilius was charged with having recklessly sacrificed the fives of citizens in the attack on the Janiculum, but was acquitted ; and in B.C. 473, the tribune Genucius summoned the consuls of the preceding year, because they had refused to carry into effect the agrarian law of Sp. Cassius ; but in order to get rid of this determinate friend of the plebs, the patricians caused his assas sination in his own house. The plebeians fled in dismay, and prepared to defend themselves by force; but as the other tri bunes remained in cowardly silence at the outrage, the consuls immediately began a general levy, and they might perhaps have accomplished it, had it not been for the insult they offered to Pub lilius Volero. He had before served in the army as a centurio; and being now called to serve as a common soldier, he refused. The consuls resolved to make an example of him, and sent out the Actors with orders to seize and scourge him in the presence of"], [148, "HISTORY OF ROME. 128 the tribunes ; but Volero, who was a strong and robust man, dashed the lictors away, and escaped into a thick crowd of plebeians, who overpowered and maltreated the lictors in then attempt to disperse the people. The levy was abandoned, and the tumult subsided; but Publilius Volero had become the darling of the plebeians, and was elected one of the tribunes for the year following, B.C. 472. He scorned to impeach the consuls for the personal wrong he had suffered, but exerted his power in a manner from which the whole order of the plebeians might derive substantial advantages. He brought a proposal before the commonalty, that henceforth the tribunes should be elected in the comitia of the tribes, instead of those of the cen turies. We must observe that by this time the curiae appear to have lost the right of sanctioning a tribune elect, for if they had still had that right, they would hardly have sanctioned the election of a man like Volero. This proposal was opposed by the patricians in all possible ways, and even two of the colleagues of the tribune were prevailed upon to side with the nobles. His two other colleagues, however, stood by him, so that he could bring his proposition to the vote. The utmost efforts were made to prevent the commonalty from arriving at a decision upon the question ; and the delay thus caused rendered it impossible to come to a resolution during that year. But Publilius Volero was again elected tribune for the year following, and brought forward fresh propositions in conjunction with his colleague, C. Laetorius. The first was, that the plebeian aediles also should be elected in the assembly of the tribes ; the second, that on the proposal of a tribune, the assembly of the tribes should be entitled to deliberate and pass resolutions (plebiscita) on all matters affecting the welfare of the whole nation, for hitherto their deliberations had been confined to matters relating to then own order. By this measure it was intended that the tribes should occupy the place of the centuries, which had lost the power granted to them by king Servius Tullius, and were con vened only to adopt or reject measures which had been passed by"], [149, "PUBLILIUS VOLERO. 129 the curiae. A resolution of the plebs on these subjects was indeed no more than a resolution passed at any public meeting in England, and was not binding as law, but might easily become law, expressing as it did the opinion of the whole body of plebeians, who were certainly not inferior in number to the patricians. Amid the excitement caused by these proposals, the senate had appointed App. Claudius Regillensis to the consulship, expecting that with the haughty stubbornness of his family, he would be able to prevent the plebs passing the resolutions ; but the centimes gave him a colleague of a gentler disposition, in the person of T. Quinctius. At length, when C. Laetorius, a bolder and more vehement person than Volero, tried to put the matter to the vote, a fearful scene took place. The patricians assembled in great numbers, and with hosts of their clients about the forum endeavoured to disturb the proceedings of the plebeians. The messengers of the tribunes called upon them to withdraw, and tried to compel the refractory, but they were hooted and scorned ; and App. Claudius sent his lictors to seize Laetorius, who at the same time despatched some of his men to arrest the consul. The plebeians, rushing forth to defend their tribune, put the patricians to flight. The plebeians, exhorted to moderation by T. Quinctius, followed the fugitives, and occupied the Capitol with armed men. The senate, becoming convinced that force could do nothing, praised Quinctius for his conduct ; and the proposals of Publilius Volero and C. Laetorius were carried and sanctioned as law by the senate, which saw no other way of getting out of its difficulties. The carrying of these resolutions {lex PiMilia) was of incal culable advantage to the plebeians ; for, in the first place, there now was a law which had been originated by a tribune and the assembly of the plebs, a thing which had never been heard of before, but might serve as a precedent for others ; and in the second, it seemed to the plebeians the right of electing their own magistrates, and to pass plebiscita, or resolutions, upon all ques- g 3"], [150, "130 HISTORY OF ROME. tions of public interest : such resolutions being the declared will of the plebs, necessarily exercised a great influence, until after a time they acquired the force of laws binding upon the whole nation. Life and motion were thus awakened in the con stitution, and the whole republic was benefited. But App. Claudius, who had been chosen by his own order to defy the ple beians, and had then been deserted by them, burnt with indigna tion. He was called upon to levy an army against the Aequians and Volscians, who must have been a real scourge to the Roman allies. The soldiers were enlisted, but were determined that he should not gain victories by them ; while his mind was wholly set upon devising means of driving the soldiers to despair. When the troops met the Volscians, they heard a report that the consul intended to betray them to the enemy ; and as it was readily believed, they fled back to their camp, whither they were followed by the Volscians. Appius convoked the soldiers of the infantry to assemble without their arms ; but suspecting that, with the assistance of the equites and the allies, he intended to massacre them, they refused to lay aside their arms. This com pelled Appius to desist from his scheme. The suspicion of another plot to betray his troops to the Volscians induced them to desert their standards : they fled in a tumultuous manner till they reached the Roman territory. Thus they had been driven to an act of high treason against the republic. Appius followed the soldiers, and held a court-martial over them : the centurions who had deserted then- standards, and every tenth soldier, were beheaded. When the year of his office had come to its close, the tribunes impeached him capitally before the commonalty. He assailed the tribunes with scorn and abuse : his accusers postponed the day of trial, that he might have an opportunity of withdrawing into exile ; but in the night before the day on which the trial was to come on, App. Claudius died. It is said that he made away with himself; but if so, his family kept it secret, that his body might not be deprived of an honourable burial. Repeated"], [151, "WARS AGAINST THE VOLSCIANS AND AEQUIANS. 131 attempts were made about the same time to carry into effect the agrarian law of Cassius, but in vain : it is said that the indig nation of the plebeians rose at last to such a pitch, that they refused taking part in the election of the one consul ; and that, consequently, the consuls of the year B.C. 468 were elected by the patricians and then clients. This accoimt probably means that the plebeians refused to sanction the consul who had been elected by the curiae, and that the patricians were satisfied with seeing him confirmed by the centuries, at which they themselves and their clients only took part ; for the refusal to take part in the election of the other consul would have been childish, and could not have been otherwise than most agreeable to the patricians. A successful campaign against the Volscians, and the taking of Antium, for a time soothed the animosity of the two parties. The consul, Tib. Aemilius, repeatedly recommended the execu tion of the Cassian law ; and it would seem that at length it was, at least to some extent, carried into effect, or that a compromise was made with the plebeians, for henceforth we hear no more complaints about it for some years. During the period of these internal commotions, wars had been carried on against the Volscians and Aequians. Antium had been taken, but did not remain long in the possession of the Romans, for it was lost again in B.C. '459. In the third campaign, B.C. 465, two consular armies marched out against the Aequians, who had pitched their camp on Mount Algidus. While the Romans and Aequians were encamped on those woody lulls, in face of each other, separate bodies of the latter made predatory excursions into the plain, and even penetrated into the vicinity of Rome. In the year following, the town of Ecetra also declared war against Rome, which had made all the preparations required for the occasion : its walls were strongly garrisoned, and the gates well guarded ; but the consuls in the field could do nothing, and were in the greatest danger. Thousands of country people had taken refuge with their cattle within the walls of the city; it was in the heat of summer; the scantiness of food."], [152, "132 HISTORY OF ROME. together with the crowded state of the population, brought about epidemic diseases, which attacked both men and beasts ; and in B.C. 463 a real pestilence began its ravages. Thousands were carried off by it, and every house in the city suffered more or less. During this distress, the allies called for protection ; and the Volscians, uniting with the Aequians, pitched their camp at a distance of no more than three miles from the Esquiline gate. But the enemy made no attempt to take the city, perhaps only from fear of the contagion. They soon broke up their camp, and ransacked every corner of Latium, where they could find or expect booty. A weak army of the Latins and Hernicans at length risked a battle, but they were defeated with great slaughter. The consequences of this, as of other military reverses, are not mentioned by the Roman historians, who, in the very next year, represent Rome as again victorious ; but it is evident that the spreading of the plague rendered it desirable for all parties to abstain from war, the cessation from which was in all probability owing more to the ravages of the pestilence than to any victory of the Romans. For two years we hear no more of a war with the Volscians. The Aequians had concluded peace with Rome ; but their com mander, Gracchus Cloelius, nevertheless led his troops again to Mount Algidus. In b.c 458, the consul L. Minucius was defeated in those mountains by the Aequians, who then besieged him in his camp. His colleague was engaged against the Sabines, who continually made inroads into the Roman territory; but Minucius was rescued by succour from Rome. This plain fact seems to be the substance of the legend of L. Quinctius Cincin natus, for it is impossible to consider the accounts about Cincin natus in any other light than those of a poetical tale. The senate resolved, so runs the story, to appoint a dictator to ex tricate the republic from the threatening danger ; and no man was thought more capable of doing it, and of rescuing Minucius from his unfortunate position, than L. Quinctius Cincinnatus. The messengers of the senate, who brought him the dictatorship,"], [153, "WARS AGAINST THE VOLSCIANS AND AEQUIANS. 133 found him and his wife Bacilia engaged in rustic pursuits on his little estate on the other side of the Tiber. When he had put on his toga to receive the message of the senate, they saluted him as dictator and conducted him to Rome. He immediately ordered that every one capable of bearing arms should be en listed. AU obeyed, and in three days he marched with a nume rous army to Mount Algidus, which he reached at midnight. The Roman camp was still surrounded by the enemy. Cin cinnatus made his soldiers form a circle round the Aequians ; and having given a signal to Minucius that succour had come, the Romans burst forth from their camp. The fight lasted till day break, when the Aequians, to their utter dismay, perceived that they were surrounded. They implored the Roman dictator that he would not destroy them. Cincinnatus ordered Gracchus Cloelius and Iris lieutenants to be put in chains : the rest were obliged to lay down their arms before then- conqueror, and were disgraced by being compelled to pass under the yoke. The town of Corbio and the camp, with all that it contained, fell into the hands of the victors . Cincinnatus returned to Rome in triumph, and was rewarded with a golden crown. Minucius had no share either in the booty or the triumph. Cincinnatus laid down his dictatorship, with which he had been invested oidy sixteen days, and returned to his farm. The danger of Minucius, and liis delivery by Cincinnatus, were the subject of a beautiful poem, the substance of which is contained in the ordinary accounts, of which the above is only an outline.13 The Aequians were thus defeated ; but the war was not yet at an end : it continued with varying success, until the battle near Corbio, in B.C. 446, weakened the Aequians so much, that they were for a time unable again to take up arms against Rome. The plague by which Rome was visited during this period must have made fearful havoc among the people, and many of the patrician families must have been completely swept away. This 18 Dionysius has reduced the story to something which looks like real history, but is still very far from it."], [154, "134 HISTORY OF ROME. calamity was followed as usual by a considerable degree of de moralisation. The calamity itself was increased by great reverses in war ; and by numerous acts of oppression and injustice which the magistrates committed against the plebeians, and which led to new agitations on the part of the tribunes. In B.C. 462, while the legions were in the field, the tribune C. Terentillus Arsa brought before the commonalty a proposal, the object of which was to place the two estates as nearly as possible on a footing of equality. The consuls hitherto had exercised their authority not according to any written rule, but acted according to hereditary usage and their own discretion, and had frequently been guilty of acts of flagrant injustice. With the view of restraining the power of the consuls, Terentillus proposed that five men should be ap pointed to frame a code of laws for all classes of Roman citizens.19 This plan of his shocked many prejudices, and called forth the most passionate resistance of the ruling party. The bill was passed by the tribes, but rejected by the senate and the curiae. The next year the bill, perhaps with more extensive demands than at first, was brought forward again by the tribune A. Vir ginius. The patricians had recourse to their usual tricks : they disturbed and annoyed the proceedings of the commonalty. Then leader was Kaeso Quinctius, the son of L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, a proud young man, and full of contempt for the plebeians, whom he maltreated and insulted more than any other of his brother patricians. The tribunes, however, held together as one man ; and the plebeians were ready to support them at all hazards. They brought a capital charge agaiust K. Quinctius, for having violated the sacred person of a tribune. The patricians implored forgive ness for their champion; and it would perhaps have been granted, had not an outrage come to light which he had committed some time before against an aged and sick man, who had died in con sequence of the ill treatment he had received at the hands of the 19 Zonaras, vii. 28 ; Liv. iii. 9 ; rius (jus Papirianum) long before : Dionys. x. 50.

The friends of the deceased man had never been able to get the case investigated by the consuls. This unexpected piece of news em-aged the assembly to such a degree, that the people would at once have cut down the offender if the tribunes had not interfered. K. Quinctius escaped into Etruria ; and his friends had to pay the sureties which they had given for him. Some of the patricians were intimidated by these occurrences, and were inclined to give way ; but others continued their vehe ment opposition, while in secret they endeavoured to win the favour of the plebs by acts of kindness and flattery : such unusual conduct, however, of the patricians created suspicion ; and a report was spread that K. Quinctius was at the head of a conspiracy to murder all the leading men of the plebeians. This threw the people into a state of alann and uneasiness. One night they were awakened from then- sleep by a war shout from the Capitol. A band of 4000 exiles and run-away slaves, under the guidance of the Sabine Appius Herdonius, had, in the night, taken pos session of the Capitol ; and there was sufficient reason for believ ing that this was part of the plot said to have been formed by K. Quinctius. The consuls manned the walls and gates of the city, in case of any attack from without ; and all persons bound to serve in the army were called upon to take up arms : but the plebeians refused taking the military oath, which woidd have compelled them to yield a blind obedience to the commands of the consuls, until P. Valerius, one of the consuls, interfered, so lemnly promising that the voting of the tribes should be no further disturbed, and pledging himself that the bill of Teren tillus, if it were passed by the commonalty, should be sanctioned and made law. Hereupon the soldiers took their oath, and the Capitol was taken by storm. P. Valerius himself, and a great many others, fell during the assault ; but the exiles were over powered, and those who fell into the hands of their conquerors were put to the sword. K. Quinctius was believed to have been"], [156, "136 HISTORY OF ROME. among them, and to have been killed : this opinion is supported by an expression of Livy,20 who says, that he was irrecoverably lost to his friends and the republic. After the danger was removed, the tribunes called upon App. Claudius to redeem the pledge of his late colleague P. Valerius. But he declared that he could not act by himself, and caused the haughty L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, the same who, two years later, delivered Minucius from the Aequians, to be raised to the consulship by the senate and curiae. The most outrageous plans were now formed, not only to prevent the commonalty from passing the bill of Terentillus, but even to reduce them to that state of dependence in which they had been previous to the seces sion to the Sacred Mount. But even the very hardiest among the patricians now felt that they must abandon such schemes, and they prevailed upon the plebs to let the bill he dormant for a year. The determination of the plebeians, however, was manifest from the fact of then re-electing the tribunes of B.C. 461 for five successive years. During the sort of truce now established between the two orders many of the leading plebeians were secretly assas sinated;21 but such acts of violence rendered the plebeians only the more stout and resolute in their demands. In B.C. 457 the number of tribunes was raised from five to ten, two being taken from each of the classes,22 probably because the former number was found insufficient to afford the protection which was needed when outrages of every kind were of such frequent occurrence. The increase of the tribunician power became manifest the very year after ; for the tribune Icilius, and his colleagues, compelled the consuls to bring a resolution of the plebs before the senate, 20 III. 25. his veto, are forced to say, that the increase in the number of the tribunes was a concession only to the patricians, who must have found it easier to gain over one out of ten, than one out of five. 21 Dion Cass.

The object of this bill, which was passed, was, that the Aventine should be assigned to the plebeians. A part of that hill had been assigned to them as early as the time of king Ancus Marcius ; but from the law of Icilius we must conclude that there still were parts of the Aven tine which were public land, and had not yet been assigned. These parts were occupied by patricians, who had built houses there which they let to plebeians. The patricians were indemnified for those houses ; and the ground, with the buildings upon it, was distributed for dwelling places among the plebeians. Hence forth the plebeians are in the exclusive possession of the strong suburb on the Aventine. In B.C. 454, another great step was gained, by a law carried by the consuls, Sp. Tarpeius and A. Aternius, which limited the fines to be inflicted upon a plebeian; the maximum being two sheep and thirty beeves.23 The bill of Terentillus Arsa appears to have been forgotten for a number of years ; but it was taken up again in B.C. 454 ; and the patricians now consented that the laws of the republic should be revised, but at the same time reserved to themselves the right of framing the new code of laws. The first step was, to send three senators to Athens, to acquire a knowledge of the con stitution of that city, as well as of the laws and institutions of other states. The account of this embassy to Greece has been doubted by modem writers, on account of the wide difference between that legislation which was the result of this embassy, and the institutions of Athens and other Greek states. But we should remember that they did not go out with a view to adopt the laws of a foreign country : their object unquestionably was no other than to acquire a knowledge of the working of the laws, and of the principles on which they were based ; and surely any legistator, to whatever country he belonged, might derive whole some and instructive information from the constitutions of the \u00bb Dionys. x. 50, ludicrously says, two oxen and thirty sheep.

MAELIUS WARS AGAINST THE ETRUSCANS, AND THE TAKING OF VEIL After the return of the ambassadors from Greece, some dis putes arose about the composition of the board to be entrusted with the new legislation; the plebeians demanding that their order should be represented by five in the board of the ten (decemviri). But after some time they gave way on this point, and allowed the decemvirs to be taken exclusively from the patri cians. It is a principle which we find adopted in all the states of antiquity, that when a person or a commission is appointed to frame a new code of laws, or to remodel a constitution, he or it was for the time invested with supreme power, and all other authorities were suspended. The same rule was now observed at Rome: the offices of the consuls, of thepraefect of the city, and of the aediles and quaestors were suspended until the decemvirs, who entered upon their task on the ides of May, B.C. 451, and from whose sentence no appeal was left,1 should have completed then- work. From the accounts we have received, it would appear that the tribuneship of the plebs was likewise done away with ; but as, among the laws which the decemvirs pledged themselves to maintain, especial mention is made of the Icilian law respecting the Aventine, we may presume that the tribunes continued to exercise then- usual functions, probably with this exception, that during the period of the decemvirate they were not allowed to 1 Liv. iii. 32 : placet creari decemviros sine provocations"], [160, "140 HISTORY OF ROME. bring any new bills before the plebeian assembly. It would, m fact, have been a most inconsiderate and foolish forbearance on the part of the plebeians, to give up the only safeguard they had against patrician aggrandisement, and this at a time when ten patricians were invested with the supreme power. The object of the new legislation was to establish a unity between the two estates, which had hitherto existed independently of each other, and to embody in the new code such of the earlier laws and customs as would not disturb the intended unity. As, however, all the ten places in the decemvirate were occupied by patricians, it may easily be imagined, that but little was done to improve the condition of the plebeians ; that on the contrary, the oligarchy did all it could to estabhsh its power more firmly. We are told, however, that the decemvirs acted in perfect har mony among themselves, and were just towards the people ; nay, that they managed the affairs of the republic so well during the year of then office, that all classes of citizens were satisfied with then administration. They are said to have availed themselves of the assistance of Hermodorus of Ephesus,2 in the drawing up of their new code of laws, which embraced ancient Roman and Italian customs, laws promulgated by the kings, and others, which were either entirely new, or derived from Greece proper and the Greek states in southern Italy. The peace of the republic was not disturbed by any foreign enemy, and when the year came to its close, the decemvirs had completed then code of laws ; which laws, after they had received the sanction of the senate, the centuries, and curiae, w-ere engraved upon ten tables of brass, and set up in the comitium, that everybody might, be able to read them. These laws henceforth continued to be the basis of all civil and criminal legislature among the Romans, down to the time of the emperors. Some persons however were of opinion that the new code, though in itself very excellent, was not complete, and that the addition of two more tables would make it as complete : Diogen. Laert. ix. 2; Cic. Tuscul. v. 36; Plin. Ilist. Nat. xxxiv. 5."], [161, "FIRST DECEMVIRATE. 141 as cotdd be desired. It was accordingly resolved, that for the next year also decemvirs should be appointed. The cunning Appius Claudius, one of the first decemvirs, who by a feigned moderation and mildness had contrived to insinuate himself into the favour of the plebs, presided at the election of the new decemvirs, and did not blush to accept votes for himself. He, in conjunction with other leading patricians, exerted his utmost influence to get elected such men as were the most notorious and avowed enemies of the plebeians. Deception and intrigues marked the begimiing of this decemvirate; and when Appius Claudius had gained his end, he threw aside the mask. Two tables were soon added to the ten of the previous year ;3 and after this was done, the decemvirs began to act as real despots, turning all then- hatred and malice against the plebeians, who, deceived by the affected moderation of the first decemvirs, had allowed the office of their tribunes to be suspended for the period of the second decemvirate.4 From the manner in which the decemvirs acted, one might have supposed that they had con spired together never to give up that absolute power with which they had been invested only for a certain object and a limited period ; for no assemblies were convened, either to sanction the two tables, or to elect new magistrates for the year following. The year thus came to its close ; and as the decemvirs did not show the least inclination to withdraw from office, the patricians themselves began to be as much alarmed as the plebeians. In the meantime the Sabines and Aequians renewed their hostili ties, and ravaged Latium and the Roman territory. The senate was obhged to decree a levy of taxes, and the decemvirs carried it into effect. The armies went out under then- command ; but Appius Claudius, and one of his associates, remained behind at Rome. One army was defeated by the Sabines near Eretum, and the other on Mount Algidus by the Aequians, who seized upon the camp of the Romans, and compelled them to take Diod. xii. 26. states that the two after, and then by the consuls Valerius new tables were not added till the year and Horatius. \u2022\" Liv. iii. 37."], [162, "142 HISTORY OF ROME. refuge at Tusculum. The city of Rome, at whose gates the enemy was expected every moment to appear, was put into a state of defence, while reinforcements were sent out to strengthen the armies of the decemvirs. During tins deplorable state of affairs, things happened in the army and at Rome which brought about the end of the tyranny of the decemvirs. In the army engaged against the Sabines there was a distinguished plebeian, who had fought with honour in many wars, and was known to be an undaunted opponent of the decemvirs. He had even ventured to hold out a threat of another secession of the plebs, and of the re-establishment of the tribuneship. In order to get rid of so pertinacious an enemy, his superiors sent him from the camp, accompanied by a number of other soldiers, to view- the country, and choose a place for a camp. But his companions had secret orders to assassinate him ; and when they came to a lonely spot they fell upon liim. He was murdered amid a number of the lined assassins, whom he slew in defending himself. When his body was found, it was manifest what had occurred; for no one could believe that he had been killed by the Sabines. This murder raised the indignation of the soldiers against the decemvirs still more ; but the measure of their crimes was not yet full. About the same time that this occurred in the camp, App. Claudius at Rome cast his lustful eyes on Virginia, a lovely and modest maiden, the daughter of the centurion Virginius, who was at the time with the army. App. Claudius had her carried off by one of his servile clients, and pubhcly declared that she was one of his slaves, refusing to listen to the evidence of her betrothed Icilius, or any other witness. When after a mock investigation the tyrant was on the point of taking possession of her, Virginius, who had in the mean time come to Rome to protect his child, begged permission to take leave of her and speak a few words to her in private. The request was granted, and the exasperated father, wishing to see his child die before his eyes rather than five dishonoured, snatched a knife from a butcher's"], [163, "SECOND DECEMVIRATE. 143 stall and plunged it into her breast. With the bloody knife in his hand, and protected by a large crowd of people, he hastened from the forum to the gate, and thence to the army, to rouse the soldiers against the tyrants. The friends of Virginius assembled again in the forum, and over the body of the innocent victim raised the call for freedom. The Actors whom App. Claudius sent among them were overpowered and then fasces broken ; and the decemvir, seeing himself deserted and despised by all, took to flight. His colleague, Sp. Appius, convened the senate; but no resolution was come to, the only object of the patricians being to gain time. As soon as the soldiers in the camp were informed by Vn-ginius of what had occurred at Rome, they quitted the camp, marched towards the city, and took possession of the Aventine, where they renounced the government of the decemvirs. The senate sent envoys to the insurgents, but no answer was given, except that the soldiers would not treat with any other deputies than L. Valerius and M. Horatius, two patricians who, throughout the tyranny of the decemvirs, had acted in a kindly spirit towards the people. In the meantime the army which had been sent against the Aequians also arrived on the Aventine, and when all the men were thus assembled, preparations were made for quitting Borne ; but at length Valerius and Horatius were deputed to the Aventine. The people, however, refused to treat with them, unless the decemvirs were compelled by the senate to resign then- power. It being evident that the patricians were unwilling to sacrifice the decemvirs, M. Duilius, who had been tribune, told the people that by negotiations the disputes would never come to an end ; that, in order to gain their object, they must show a firm resolution to quit Rome, and seek a home elsewhere. Hereupon, the soldiers and all the other plebeians, men, women, and children, who had flocked to them from the city and its neighbourhood, proceeded to the Sacred Mount, where they took up a strong position. A tacit truce, however, prevailed; and it is said that no act of hostility was committed on either side. Valerius and Horatius"], [164, "144 HISTORY OF ROME. were again despatched as ambassadors to the seceders, but with full power to treat with them on any terms they might think proper. They were received in the camp with the greatest joy. Icilius spoke for the plebeians, and demanded the restoration of the tribuneship, the right of appeal against any magistrate, and an amnesty for those who had urged the people and the army to the insurrection : his last demand was that the decemvirs should be delivered up and suffer death at the stake. The ambassadors willingly granted the first points, but they thought the punish ment of the decemvirs too severe ; and as they promised the people that they should have the right to impeach every one of them separately, the plebeians gave way, and trusted to the honesty of the envoys. When the report of these transactions was brought to Rome, all further opposition on the part of the patricians ceased, and the senate issued an ordinance demanding of the decemvirs to lay down their power, in order that consuls might again be elected. The new tribunes were to be chosen under the presidency of the chief pontiff. The command being obeyed by the decemvirs, the seceders returned to Borne, and elected then- new tribunes. The men appointed to the consulship were L. Valerius and M. Horatius, the stout champions of the people's liberty5. Let us now see the result of the decemviral legislation in regard to the constitution. There cannot be any doubt that the laws of the twelve tables6 contained an arrangement by which the whole body of Roman citizens, the patricians and their clients, as well as the plebeians, henceforth became members of the local tribes, in which hitherto the plebeians alone had been contained. As proofs of this fact, we may mention that App. Claudius, in 5 The account we have here given is the one adopted by most writers ; but Cicero (Be Re Pull. ii. 37, and in the fragments of the Corneliana), gives a different account of this revolu tion; for according to him the seceders first established themselves on the Sacred Mount, and thence proceeded to the Aventine. fi Some fragments of the laws of the twelve tables have come down to us, and are collectedin Dirksen, Uebersicht der bisherigen Versuche zur Kritik und Herstellung der Fragmente der zwolf Tafeln, Leipzig, 1824, 8vo."], [165, "LAWS OF THE TWELVE TRIBES. 145 the very year of the abolition of the decemvirate, is represented as appealing to the assembly of the tribes ;7 in B.C. 433, the censors punished Mam. Aemilius by striking his name off the fist of his tribe;8 and in B.C. 392, the patricians are described as imploring then fellow-tribesmen to vote against the projected settlement at Veii.9 Many more instances belonging to a later time might be mentioned, in which the patricians are described as members of the local tribes.10 The assembly of the tribes, therefore, now became a great national assembly for legislative purposes, but the measures passed by it still required the sanction of the curiae : it had also the election of all minor magistrates, as the aediles, quaestors, and tribunes, and was at the same time the high court of appeal. The assembly of the centuries, on the other hand, retained the election of the high magistrates, the decision upon peace and war, and the privilege of acting as a court of justice in certain cases. The advantages, however, which the plebeians derived from this new arrangement were very insig nificant ; and in the civil part of the new legislature many of the severe and exclusive laws and customs of former times were sanctioned, as, for example, the severe law of debt, and the one declaring marriages between a patrician and a plebeian illegal.11 The highest magistracy remained, as before, inaccessible to the plebeians ; nor was there any law to entitle them to a share in the conquered lands, which became the property of the state. The study of the laws of the twelve tables, so far as they have come down to us, is extremely instructive in regard to the manners and the state of feeling among the Romans of those times. A 'father, for instance, was permitted to sell his son thrice : other laws, however, show great wisdom and sound wise begins to disappear after this time. 11 These, and many other laws of a similar kind, were probably contained in the last two tables, which Cicero (De Re Pull. ii. 37) calls unjust, while he praises the other ten tables for their justice and fairness. 7 Liv. iii. 56. 8 Liv. iv. 24. 9 Liv. v. 30. 10 The three ancient Rom ulian tribes, the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, had now become practically useless, and fell into oblivion.

Then- interfering so much with the affairs of private fife, is a feature which the Roman law-s have in common with those of all other ancient states ; for the ancients thought it the duty of a state to take care that all the members of the com munity should become good citizens in every respect. The men who had deserved the greatest honour during the late troubles, and who had been rewarded with the consulship, did not disappoint the hopes of the plebeians. For the purpose of securing the rights of the plebeians, they revived the old laws respecting the inviolability of the tribunes \u2014 that no magistrate should ever be appointed from whose sentence an appeal was not left open, and that any person acting contrary to this shoidd be outlawed. As the assembly of the tribes now contained both the patricians and plebeians, the consuls got a new law passed by the centuries, ordaining that any measure passed by the assembly of the tribes should have the same force as one passed by the centuries ;12 so that, if such a measure received the sanction of the curiae, it became law for the whole nation, just as one pro posed by the consuls and passed by the centuries. The consuls, L. Valerius and M. Horatius, further enacted that the ordinances of the senate shoidd henceforth be deposited in the archives of the temple of Ceres, and be kept there by the plebeian aediles. The tribune, M. Duilius, also carried a plebiscitum, that any one who should cause the plebeians to be without their tribunes, or should appoint a magistrate without the right of appeal from his sentence, should be scourged and put to death, or, according to others, be burnt at the stake.13 The freedom of the plebeians appearing now to be firmly established, the tribunes summoned the late decemvirs one by one before the court of the plebeians. App. Claudius was thrown into prison, and died, probably by his own hand, before the day of his trial; his colleague, Sp. Appius, perished in the same 12 Dionys. xi. 45.

AU who had been accomplices of the decemvirs dreaded a similar fate, but the tribune Duilius would not allow any further im peachments for crimes committed during the rule of the decem virs. This moderation allayed the fears of the patricians; but as they began to feel secure, they also began to feel exasperated at having been frightened, and they took the first opportunity of showing a mean spirit of revenge. When the internal affairs of the republic were settled, Valerius led an army against the Aequians and Volscians, who were en camped on Mount Algidus, and after a glorious fight the enemy's camp fell into his hands. The report of this victory filled the Romans with joy, and gave to the army engaged under Horatius against the Sabines confidence and corn-age. The Sabines were routed, and their camp was abandoned to the Romans. That day put an end to the wars of the Sabines, of which henceforth we hear no more for a period of 150 years. Both consuls had deserved a triumph, but the senate refused to grant it, and treated the victorious consuls as men who had betrayed the interests of their own order to the plebeians. But the tribune Icilius brought the matter before the assembly, and the consuls celebrated their triumph without an ordinance of the senate, on the mere resolution of the people,1* a thing which had never been done before. The confidence which the people had in their tribunes and consuls made them desire to have the same persons re-elected for the next year ; but the wisdom and moderation both of the tribunes and consuls opposed this scheme : new officers were elected; and among the tribunes of B.C. 448 there were even two patricians ; some of the others also were devoted to the cause of the patricians. From this we see that the patricians, who now 14 After the decemviral legislation, and as contradistinguished from the we may apply the term people to all senate. the Romans, as contained in the tribes, H 2"], [168, "148 HISTORY OF ROME. were members of the tribes, naturally wanted to be represented in the tribuneship. For some time the more haughty and vehement among the patricians annoyed the plebeians in a variety of ways, but a perfect equality of the two orders became more and more dis tinctly the goal towards which all efforts of the tribunes were directed. In B.C. 445, the tribune C. Canuleius brought forward a bill demanding the establishment of the eonnubium between the two estates; and his nine colleagues proposed another, enacting that henceforth one of the consuls should always be a plebeian. The discussion of these bills called forth the bitterest exasperation on both sides : the patricians attempted to prevent their being passed, by causing a levy to be made against the Veientines, Aequians, and Volscians ; but C. Canuleius, with the utmost determination, refused to allow the levy to be made before the plebs had voted on the bills which had been brought before them : the patricians at length gave way, and allowed the bill respecting the eonnubium to be passed, hoping that the plebeians woidd thus be satisfied, and give up the one respecting the divi sion of the consulship, or at least defer the debates upon it till after the war. In order to understand why the patricians gave way, with comparatively little resistance, to the bill of Canuleius, we must remember, that although the eonnubium did not exist between the two orders, marriages nevertheless were frequently contracted ; and as the children sprung from such marriages always followed the baser side, we may presume that they be came the bitterest enemies of the patricians : the latter also must have been aware that through then exclusive spirit then families became daily more reduced in numbers, while those of the ple beians were ever on the increase, and threatened to overwhelm them in the end by their numerical superiority. The bill respect ing the division of the consulship was modified in such a manner that, in future, military tribunes, with consular power (tribuni militares conmdari potestate), should be elected indisciiminately from both orders. It was, however, left to the option of the"], [169, "ROGATIONS OF C. CANULEIUS. 149 senate to determine whether, in any given year, consuls or con sular tribunes shoidd be appointed. The dignity of a consular tribune being inferior to that of a consul, as he was not elected under the same solemn auspices, the patricians in this maimer contrived still to retain the exclusive possession of the consul ship. The consular tribunes accordingly were elected for the year B.C. 444, but as might be expected, all of them were patri cians ; and the plebeians were satisfied with having acquired the right to a share in the new office, without insisting upon exercis ing it. After the lapse of three months, however, the consular tribunes were obliged to lay down their office, on account of some flaw in the election, and consuls were appointed in their stead.15 As the consular tribuneship was thus thrown open to the plebeians, and it became evident that the consulship could not be withheld from them much longer, the patricians, in B.C. 443, deprived the consulship of a branch of its power, which they expressly reserved for themselves, under the title of the censorship. The duties of the two censors, who were at first taken only from amoug those who had been consuls, were to conduct the census, to register the citizens according to then classes and tribes, and to administer the property and revenue of the re public. Then- office was apparently of not much consequence ; but as they had it in their power to determine the rank of every citizen, to fix his status in society, and to value his taxable pro perty at their owti discretion, the office could not fail to become a very powerful one in the hands of energetic persons : in the end it became almost a despotic power, which was looked upon with hatred, though everybody saw its necessity. As the census was held every five years, the first censors were in- 15 It is a curious fact, that the were less than six, and in a few cases number of the consular tribunes does eight ; the two censors being included not appear to have been fixed : at first among them.

Aemilius, reduced the duration of the office to eighteen months, so that in every lustrum there were three years and a half during which time there were no censors. Having thus secured to themselves one important branch of the con sular power, the patricians might be the less concerned about the plebeians taking part in the consulship ; besides, they knew that in most cases they could manage the elections in such a manner as to exclude the plebeian candidates. But whatever schemes the patricians might resort to, in order to maintain then exclusive rights, the distinction between the two orders was gradually beginning to vanish : the personal or family relations between the members of the two estates also tended to soften down the disputes which arose between them ; and for a time peace prevailed at Rome. New commotions arose in B.C. 440 in consequence of a famine, which was raging at Rome so furiously, that many poor citizens sought relief in self destruction. The government appointed L. Minucius praefect of the corn-market (praefectus aunonae), but his endeavours to buy com abroad were unsuccessful ; and amid the general distress the government was put to shame by the generous exertions of a private citizen, the wealthy plebeian Sp. Maelius, who purchased corn at his own expense, and supplied it at a moderate price to the sufferers, while those who had no means at all received their supplies gratis. His kindness and generosity so won him the hearts of the people, both rich and poor, that the patricians felt alarmed at his popularity ; and fearing lest he should harbour ambitious and dangerous schemes, as there was no lack of suspicious reports of secret meetings and treasonable plots, they appointed, in B.C. 439, L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, now at the age of eighty, dictator : his magister equitum was C. Servilius Ahala. The dictator set up his tribunal in the forum, and all the people flocked thither, curious to know the cause of such unusual pro ceedings. Sp. Maelius came among the rest, and Servilius Ahala forthwith summoned him before the dictator. Seeing what he"], [171, "SP. MAELIUS. 151 had to expect, Maelius snatched away a butcher's knife to defend himself, and ran into the crowd, which received and protected him. Servilius Ahala, accompanied by a band of patrician youths, pursued and slew him ; the people being intimi dated, and afraid to resist the coimnand of the dictator. The charges, which were brought against Sp. Maelius only by vague report, were never proved : he fell a victim to party animosity, in broad daylight, and in the midst of the forum. His house was pulled down ; and the supplies of corn, which are said to have been found in it, were sold by L. Minucius at one as per modius. Cicero, and other writers of a later age, hold up Ahala as a model of heroic virtue ; but his contemporaries judged otherwise : he was accused of murder before the people, and escaped condem nation only by voluntary exile.16 Had the plebeians still been what they were some years before, a revolution would inevitably have broken out ; but all that the commonalty now did was to insist upon the election of consular tribunes, instead of consids, for the year following ; to which the patricians agreed the more readily, as they were able to insure the election of patricians only. The plebeians, notwithstanding, steadily proceeded towards the goal they had in view, and in the period which now followed they acquired several minor advantages, one after another. The Aequians and Volscians had been defeated a second time since the deeeinvirate in B.C. 446 ; and now, after the internal commotions we have just mentioned, the second war against Veii broke out. It was occasioned, like the first, by the revolt of Fidenae, in B.C. 438. This town had been subdued by the Romans in early times, and had received Roman colonists to keep it in submission. Frequent but useless attempts had been made from time to time by the Fidenatans to get rid of the Roman settlers ; at length, being strengthened by an alliance with Veii and the Faliscans, they revolted, and expelled the colonists. Three Roman ambassadors were sent to Fidenae, but they were put to death by the command of Lar Tolumnius of Veii. The Fidenates 16 Valer. Maxim, v. 3, 2."], [172, "152 HISTORY OF ROME. immediately made war upon the Romans, and advanced as far as the Colline Gate; but the dictator, A. Servilius Priscus, ia B.C. 435, reconquered Fidenae. The leaders of the revolt were put to the sword, and new colonists were sent to Fidenae, who, how ever, after the defeat of the Romans before Veii, in B.C. 426, were all massacred. Diodorus,17 with great probability, assigns the murder of the Roman ambassadors to this year ; for had it taken place as early as B.C. 438, the Romans would surely not have treated the place as leniently as they are said to have done. Veii had concluded a truce after the reconquest of Fidenae, but the fresh outrage committed in the latter place, in B.C. 426, was the cause of war being declared against Veii. The command was intrusted to the dictator Mam. Aemilius, whose master of the horse slew Lar Tolumnius with his own hand, and dedicated his spoils in the temple of Jupiter Feretrius. Fidenae was pro bably retaken in the same year and destroyed : its surviving inhabitants were sold as slaves ; and the place itself became a deserted village. The victory of Mam. Aemffius over Veii could not yet be followed up to a decisive issue ; for the Romans were, at the moment, glad to conclude a truce in order to be able to direct their forces against the Aequians, with whom and the Volscians war had again broken out in B.C. 431. It was conducted by the dictator A. Postumius Tubertus, of whom a fearful story is related. According to some accounts, he ordered his own son to be put to death, because he had ventured, contrary to the command of his father, to quit his post, and fight a glorious battle. As the Romans defeated their enemies in two great battles, near Lanu vium and Tusculum, it is not improbable that they may have compelled them to recognise the sovereignty of Rome. For some years these Aurunean tribes kept the peace, until in B.C. 423, the Volscians again rose and were soon after joined by the Aequians. The consul, C. Sempronius Atratinus, conducted the war so languidly and carelessly, that his army was very nearly \u00bb xii. 80."], [173, "153 WAR WITH VEII. annihilated : at length, in B.C. 418, the enemy was defeated on Mount Algidus by the dictator A. Servilius Priscus. Lavici was taken, and received a Roman colony. In B.C. 407, an unsuccess ful war was earned on against the Volscians ; but Auxur was taken.18 In the same year the truce with Veii came to its close ; and as it was more necessary than ever that the soldiers should be will ing to fight the battle of the republic, the senate, without any demand on the part of the plebs or its tribunes, issued a decree, that henceforth the soldiers should receive pay from the pubbe trea sury ; 19 for hitherto they had been obliged to provide themselves with all that was necessary at then- own expense. Never had an offer been so joyfully accepted by the people, notwithstanding the suspicions of the tribunes, w-ho in vain cautioned them against the deceitful present. But the measure was one commanded by neces sity, to put an end to the repeated refusals of the plebeians to enlist in the armies ; for without a willing army it was impossible for Rome to establish her permanent supremacy over her neigh bours, or to make conquests at a distance. War was now declared against Veii, that powerful and wealthy city which had always been to Rome a cause of fear. A Roman army began to lay siege to it in B.C. 405. At first the besieging army always re turned home during the winter ; but when the war had already lasted for several years without any result, the Romans resolved to build huts for the winter (kibernacula), which should enable them to continue the siege uninterruptedly both winter and summer. The war was nevertheless protracted for nine years, until in the tenth, B.c. 396, Veii was taken by the dictator M. Furius Camulus, the greatest general of his age. Veii, throughout this war, received very little support from the other Etruscan towns ; the cause of which may have been either then- jealousy, or 18 The confusion in Livy's accounts of these wars is very great : legendary features are mixed up with history, and events are frequently misplaced.

Camillus, on being raised to the dictatorship, collected all the forces that he could muster, and first led them against the allies of the Veientines : he defeated the Capenatans and Faliscans in the neighbourhood of Nepete, and then besieged Veii more closely than ever. So far the account of the war sounds credible enough ; but the history of the fall of Veii, in the tenth year, is nothing but a beautiful poetical lay, in which Veii acts the same part as Troy does in the legends of the Trojan war. This lay is connected with several others (we may call them the lays of Camillus) : they extend from the first appearance of Camillus before Veii to his last victory over the Gauls. Then- substance is preserved most completely in Plutarch's life of Camillus. The fall of Veii, so the story runs, had been announced by various prodigies, the most remarkable among which was the rising of the water of the Alban lake without any visible cause, and that to such a height, that it deluged all the neighbouring country. An embassy was sent to Delphi, to consult the oracle about this extraordinary spectacle. In the meantime an Etruscan soothsayer had been ensnared by a Roman centurion, and carried to Rome, where he confessed that the Veientine books of fate announced, that Veii could not be taken so long as the Alban lake overflowed the country, and that Rome 'should perish if its waters reached the sea. Soon after this the ambassadors returned from Delphi, and then answer was to the same effect. Hereupon the Romans began making a tunnel to prevent the overflow of the water, and to conduct it through the fields in ditches. The work was carried on with great vigour ; and when its completion was near at hand, the Veientines were informed of it. Ambassadors now came from Veii, imploring the Romans to forbear, but in vain ; and on leaving the senate house they declared, that the same oracles which predicted the fall of Veii also foretold, that, soon after, Rome herself should be taken by the Gauls. A portion of"], [175, "CAPTURE OF VEII. 155 the Roman army, engaged in the siege of Veii, was in the mean time actively employed in digging a subterraneous passage, which led to the citadel of Veii, and was to issue in the temple of Juno.20 As the day approached on which Veii was to fall, the senate decreed that the booty taken should be distributed among all those Romans who wished to partake of it and woidd proceed to the camp. Hosts of people, old and young, now flocked from Rome to the devoted city. When the water of the Alban lake was led into the fields, and when all the preparations for an assault were made, Camillus, having promised rich rewards to the gods, and leading some cohorts himself, entered the sub terraneous passage : at the same time an assault was made upon the city. The king of Veii happened to be offering a sacri fice in the temple of Juno ; and the priest declared, that whoever should bring the goddess her share of the victim should conquer. These words were heard by Romans under ground; and, on the instant, they burst forth and offered the sacrifice : this being doue, they rushed through the city to open the gates to their comrades. Thus Veii fell into the hands of the Romans. The amount of spoil surpassed even the expectation of the conquerors. The whole was given up to the army, except the captives, who were sold on account of the republic. The statue of Juno is said to have followed the conquerors to Rome of her own accord; and a temple was erected to her on the Aventine. Elated by his victory, Camillus celebrated a most splendid triumph ; but his unexampled and pompous display excited the anger of the gods, and the time was not far distant, when he had to atone for it by exile, and Rome by her destruction by the Gauls. He had vowed the tenth of the spoil to the Delphic god, which was sent in the shape of a golden bow-1 eight talents in weight. 20 The story about this passage is wholly incredible. It may have arisen out of the account of the tunnel of the Alban lake, which the legend connects with the taking of Veii, and of which remnants are to be seen at this day, although it is doubtful whether its construction actually belongs to the time which the legend assigns to it."], [176, "156 HISTORY OF ROME. After the fall of Veii, the Capenatans obtained a peace ; but the war against the Faliscans being still continued, Camillus com- pelled them to quit a strong position which they had occupied in order to protect their country, and drove them back into their city of Falerii. A school-master is said to have led the sons of the most distinguished citizens of Falerii into the Roman camp, to deliver them up to the enemy ; but Camillus was noble-minded enough to send them back, and to order the traitor to be flogged. A peace was then concluded with the Faliscans, on condition of their giving to the Roman soldiers their pay for a whole year. It was probably the reduction of Falerii that led to a war with another Etruscan town, Vulsinii, which was decided in B.C. 391, in a great battle, after which a peace was concluded for twenty years. When Veii and its territory had fallen into the hands of the Romans, the patricians, as usual, endeavoured to keep the newly conquered lands for themselves; but the tribunes de manded that the land, together with the buildings on it, should be distributed among all the Roman citizens mffiscriminately. The senate, and even some of the tribunes, opposed the plan ;. but at length, in B.C. 393, the senate, apparently of its own accord, ordained the distribution of the Veientine territory, in lots of seven jugera, among all the plebeians.21 Some lands taken from the Aequians had been distributed the year before, and the patricians had hoped thereby to satisfy the wishes of the plebeians, that they might keep the lands of Veii for them selves ; but they had miscalculated, and in the end they found it more prudent to give up what they could not retain, than to allow it to be wrenched from them. Camillus, the conqueror of Veii, had never since his triumph enjoyed any favour with the people ; his triumph had displayed his unmeasured pride ; and as he had not mentioned the vow he had made in the war, to dedicate the tenth of the spoil to the Delphic God, many persons, when at length he made it 21 Liv. v. 30 ; compare Diod. xiv. 102."], [177, "CAMILLUS EXILED. 157 known, had already spent what they had acquired, and had therefore to stint themselves of what they wanted to make good his vow. He was, moreover, foremost among those patri cians who opposed the proposition that the plebeians should have a share in the distribution of the Veientine territory. The consequence of all this was, that in B.C. 391, the tribune L. Apuleius charged him with having secreted some costly articles from the spoils taken at Veii. The accusation appears to have been well founded ; and in order to escape condemna tion, he went into exile to Ardea, praying, as he went out of the gates, that Rome might soon have bitter cause to regret him."], [178, "158 CHAPTER IX. TAKING OP ROME BY THE GAULS, AND THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, DOWN TO THE LEGISLATION OF C LICINIUS STOLO AND L. SEXT1US. The time was now approaching when the prophecy of the Etruscan soothsayer was to be fiilfilled. There can be little doubt that Rome owed her victories over the Etruscan towns to the immigration of the Gauls or Celts, who at the time were press ing hard upon the Etruscans, and had already made themselves masters of the country to the north of the river Po. Tradition represents the Gauls as having been tempted, by the wine and fruit growing on the southern side of the Alps, to cross those mountains ; and that an Etruscan, Aruns of Clusium, had invited them, with a view of taking vengeance on a young Lucumo who had dishonoured his wife, and against whose outrage he could not get any redress. This story is obviously a mere fable : the cause of the Gallic migration to the south must have lain much deeper : it was either national distress which compelled them to seek food, and a new home, in a foreign land ; or they were pushed forward by other nations.1 Their huge bodies, wild figures, and long and shaggy hah, gave a ghastliness to their appearance ; their undaunted courage, and love of destruction, spread fear and terror all around ; and the Etruscan armies had already been frequently beaten by them. One branch of the Gauls, the Senones, under their chief, Brennus, probably assisted by other tribes, marched towards Clusium, in B.C. 391. The Clusines, though they 1 A tradition, related in Livy, states that the Gauls had crossed the Alps as early as the time of Tarquinius Priscus."], [179, "THE GAULS. 159 had no claims to the friendship of the Eomans, and knew them only as a powerful nation which had recently conquered Veii, sent envoys to call upon them for aid. The senate did not comply with then request, but sent the three sons of M. Eabius Ambustus as ambassadors to the Gauls, to demand of them in the name of the Eoman people to withdraw, or else to prepare for war with Eome also ; for Borne felt herself invincible, and imagined that the terror of her name alone would be sufficient to send the barbarians back to then homes. The Gauls an swered, that then- own country was too small to maintain them ; and that they would do no harm to Clusium, if its inhabitants would share then- territory with them. As this was refused, a battle eusued between the Gauls and Clusines ; and the Koman ambassadors, contrary to the law of nations, fought foremost in the ranks of the latter. One of the Eabii slew a Gallic chief, and was recognised by the Gauls as he was collecting the spoils. Hereupon the Gauls at once stopped the fight, and, indignant at the unlawful conduct of the Eoman ambassadors, woidd have forthwith marched against Eome, had not the more moderate among them prevailed upon the rest to send envoys to Eome to demand the surrender of the Eabii. The Eoman senate saw the justice of the demand, but was too proud to yield to it. The matter was referred to the assembly of the people, who not only did not punish the offenders, but appointed them consular tribunes for the next year. When the envoys brought back their report, the Gauls with an army of 70,000 men straightway set out for Eome. Blinded by reliance on then own strength, the Eomans made no great preparations to meet the necessity of the case. With a badly organised army the consular tribunes marched out, and, to their surprise, met the enemy at the distance of eleven miles from the city, on the banks of the little stream Allia, which flows from the Crustumine hills towards the Tiber. The Eomans, on seeing the immense host of barbarians, cast away then- arms and took to flight. On the banks of the Tiber they were overtaken,"], [180, "160 HISTORY OF ROME. and perished either by the sword or in the river : a few only escaped to Eome and Veii. This unfortunate day on the Allia (dies Alliensis), which was only the forerunner of a far greater calamity, was never forgotten : it was the eighteenth of July, B.C. 390.2 On the evening of the same day,3 the Gauls appeared before the ColJine gate, in the field of Mars ; but they were soon scattered over the country, abandoning themselves to plunder, drunkenness, and all the atrocities of an unruly horde of bar barians ; and thus the attack upon Borne itself was delayed for some time, during which the Capitol was garrisoned with the men best able to bear arms, and was supplied with provisions. As it was impossible to defend the city, most of the citizens, who could escape, took refuge in neighbouring towns. The objects of religious worship were partly buried, partly carried to Caere ; and the city was left to the barbarians. Eighty priests, and aged patricians of high rank, sat down in the forum on their curule chairs, in then- festal robes, and, devoting themselves to the infernal gods, awaited death. As the Gauls saw that the walls were deserted, they burst into the city : they found it all desolate and death-like, and marched tow-ards the forum. There they saw the venerable aged men, whose aspect terrified the savages; for they doubted whether what they beheld were real mortals, or the gods assembled to defend the city. One of the barbarians went up to the priest, M. Papirius, and stroked his beard, to satisfy his mind as to whether he actually were a human being. The priest indignantly struck him on the head with his ivory sceptre, and this was a signal for the Gauls to massacre all the eighty. The plundering and conflagration lasted for several days, until the whole city was reduced to a heap of ruins, with the exception of a few houses on the Palatine, which the Gallic chiefs used as then own habitations. 2 See however Liv. vi. 1 ; Gellius, (Camil. 19) state that the Gauls did v. 17 ; Macrob. Saturn, i. 16. not arrive at Rome till three days after 3 Polybius (ii. 18) and Plutarch the battle on the Allia."], [181, "ROME SACKED BY THE GAULS. 161 The Capitol alone continued to hold out, being perseveringly defended by a band of about one thousand men. Several attempts were made to take it by storm, but the desperate energy of the Bomans repulsed the assailants. The Gauls then resolved to wait till the provisions of the garrison should be exhausted, and thus to compel the besieged to surrender by hunger. The latter derived their drinking water from a well in the Tarpeian rock, which remains to this day a memorial of the siege of the Capitol by the Gauls. The ferocious devastations of the barbarians, however, became their own punishment ; for they themselves began to suffer from famine, and contagious diseases. They were obliged to spread over Latiurn, for the purpose of collecting pro visions ; and a band of them appear to have gone as far south as Apulia : some even entered the service of Dionysius of Syra cuse.* Camillus, who lived in exile at Ardea, collected the Ardeatans and fugitive Eomans, and with them repulsed the plundering Gauls. The Etruscans at this time took advantage of the miserable condition of Borne, and began to plunder the Veientine territory ; but M. Caedicius led the Bomans assembled at Veii into the field, routed the enemy, and recovered the captives and plunder. The tidings of these successful enter prises were conveyed to Borne by a daring youth named Pontius Cominius, who swam across the Tiber and climbed up the Capitol. Soon after, the Gauls discovered the way by which he had got to the top of the Capitol ; and in the dead of the night they attempted to imitate his example. One barbarian, unobserved by the sen tinels and dogs, had already reached the top, when the alarm was given by the cries of the geese which were kept in the Capitol in honour of Juno. M. Manhus, whose house stood on the Capitol,5 was awakened by the noise : he rushed out of his house, and thrust down the Gaul, who, in his fall, involved that of the others who were clambering after him. Manhus was rewarded by the garrison with gifts suitable to the state of famine from which 4 Diod. xiv. 117 ; Justin, xx. 5. 5 Hence he iB called Capitolinus, and not from his defence of the Capitol."], [182, "162 HISTORY OF ROME. they were suffering so severely : they then resolved to offer to the besiegers a sum of money if they would withdraw. As Brennus saw his own ranks greatly reduced by distress and diseases, he agreed to accept one thousand pounds-weight of gold, and to quit Borne and its territory. But the gods, it seems, coidd not allow Eome to fall so low as to purchase her freedom with gold. The Eomans assembled at Veii having, in the meantime, recalled Camillus from exile, appointed him dictator. He forthwith proceeded with his army to Veii, where he found twenty thousand Eomans. Being thus reinforced he marched towards Eome, where he arrived just at the moment when the gold wras weighed out to the Gallic king. Camillus reached the forum before the gold was delivered up, and cancelled the treaty, which had been concluded without his consent. While Brennus was remonstrating with him on this breach of faith, the Boman legions arrived, and a battle ensued in which the bar barians were driven out of the city. A second battle on the road to Gabii, whither the Eomans pursued the enemy, completed the delivery of Eome ; for all the Gauls fell, not a single man escaping to cany away the tidings of the defeat. Brennus him self was taken prisoner and put to death, and Camillus returned to Borne in triumph. The time during which the barbarians are said to have been in the possession of the city, is variously stated at six, seven, or eight months. This is the story of the sacking of Eome by the Gauls, and of her final delivery. It is impossible to say how much of it is true, and what may be the additions and embellishments added to it by poetical tradition, and by the family pride of the Camilli and Manlii. The true account of Bome's delivery is probably con tained in the plain statement of Polybius,6 that the Gauls gave up Borne as an act of grace, because in their absence the Vene tians had invaded the country of the Gauls ; and that they returned home with their booty without any harm or loss. Diodorus does not say a word of the appointment of Camillus to \u00ab ii. 18 and 22."], [183, "ROME AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE GAULS. 163 the dictatorship, much less of his having liberated Eome by arms. The differences in the accounts of the departure of the Gauls, the contradictions and impossibilities, are such as may easily be pardoned in poetry, but are insupportable in an account claiming to be history. The greatest discrepancies also prevail in regard to the year in which Borne was taken by the Gauls : some say, in round numbers, it was three hundred and sixty or three hundred and sixty-five years after the building of the city, that is, B.C. 394, or 398 ; while others place the event in b.c 390, or 3S8. After the departure of the Gauls, Bome and the surrounding country must have been a real wilderness : many of the small towns in her vicinity must have been swept away. Thousands of persons must have fallen by the sword ; and many of those who escaped the sword must have been carried away as slaves by the barbarians. When the fugitive Eomans returned to the city, they found only a heap of rubbish : even the walls which king Servius built had been pulled dow-n. While things were in this state, several of the neighbouring towns were ready to seize the opportunity of casting off the yoke of Bome. All this, when they were called upon to rebuild the city, filled the people with dismay : they vehemently desired to quit the place alto gether, and to remove to Veii, which was undestroyed, and con tained much better dwelling-houses than Bome had ever pos sessed, and in the neighbourhood of which a number of plebeians were already settled. But a nobler spirit prevailed : the better part of the Eomans felt that it would be a cowardly and pusil lanimous act to abandon then ancient home, with which the dearest associations and recollections were connected, where the ancient gods and protectors of the Eomans dwelled, and where all the power had been acquired which Bome possessed over the neighbouring countries and tribes. The selfishness of the patri cians, whose possessions lay on the left bank of the Tiber, may likewise have exercised its influence in the decision of the course to be adopted ; but, however this may be, a lucky omen is said"], [184, "164 HISTORY OF ROME. to have silenced all doubts : for as, after an energetic speech of Camillus, the senate was engaged in discussing the matter, a centurion, who with his men passed by the senate-house, was heard to say, \" Let us plant the banner here, for here it is best to stay.\" Upon these words, the senators rushed out of the house, and declared that they accepted the omen. The people who crowded around them agreed with them, and it was resolved to rebuild the city. As speed was necessary, the state gave bricks7 gratis, and allowed the citizens to take stones from any quarries they pleased, on condition that the rebuilding of their houses should be completed in one year. Everybody was allowed to build how and where he pleased ; and in the hurry, the people forgot the directions of the ancient streets, from whence it happened that the great sewers, which had before run under the public roads, afterwards ran across the streets and under private houses. It may easily be conceived that the beauty and comfort of the new houses were matters of secondary consideration. The irregularity in the streets of Borne, once produced, could not be remedied afterwards ; and the streets, down to the great fire in the reign of Nero, remained narrow and crooked. Many Eomans, who had taken to flight during the Gallic invasion, wanted to remain where they had found a new home, in order to escape the necessity of build ing a house in the destroyed city ; but the senate commanded them to return before a stated day, under pain of the severest penalties. Borne was thus rebuilt within the space of one year. All who had afforded her succours, during the time of misfortune, were rewarded -with honours. The inhabitants of Caere and Massilia received the Boman franchise ; and the Eoman matrons, the pri vilege of having orations in then- praise spoken at their funerals. During this period of recovery, Camillus was the soul of the 1 It is by no means improbable this time Veii no longer appears as a that these bricks were taken from splendid city, but only as an insignifi houses at Veii, and that in b.c. 388 cant place.

The Latins and Hernicans renounced the yoke of then alliance with Borne, though some of the Latin towns preferred to remain faithful. The Volscians, joined by some of the Latin towns, were the first to come forward as open enemies of fallen Borne, and the Etruscans soon followed then- example. Camillus was appointed dictator a third time, and enlisted all the Eomans capable of bearing arms, both old and young : he formed them into three armies, with one of which he set out against the Volscians, whom he defeated and routed with great slaughter. From the Volscians he proceeded against the Ae quians who were besieging Bolae : they too were defeated, and their camp taken. The Eoman army which was stationed near Veii, and intended to operate against the Etruscans, was not strong enough to relieve Sutrium ; but the speedy arrival of the dictator saved the place ; and the Etruscans, who already looked upon themselves as conquerors, were cut to pieces. He then marched to Nepete, which was already surrendered to the Etrus cans ; but their garrison was unable to maintain itself in the town, and was driven out of it. The place was taken by storm, and they, by whose advice it had been surrendered to the enemy, were put to death. Both Sutrium and Nepete received Eoman colonists, as a protection against further attacks of the Etruscans. Camillus on his return to Borne celebrated a triple triumph. In B.C. 388, some Etruscan towns belonging to Tarquinii were taken ; and two years later, the Antiatans, being reinforced by a number of volunteers from Latin towns, fought an obstinate battle against Camillus near Satricum, which then belonged to the Volscians, and was reduced by force : Antium, however, held out until B.C. 385, when the dictator, A. Cornelius Cossus, gained a complete victory over the Volscians in the Pomptine district. A colony of 2000 citizens was now sent to Satricum. Out of this war arose another against Velitrae, which had thrown"], [186, "166 HISTORY OF ROME. off the Roman yoke ; and as the Romans engaged against Velitrae found that it was supported by the Praenestines, who had before ravaged the territory of some Latin towns which had remained faithful to Rome, war was also declared in b.c. 382 against Praeneste. The Praenestines in their turn, assisted by Vehtrae, conquered Satricum, and treated the Roman colonists with great cruelty. Hereupon Camillus, though he was suffering from ill health, accepted a place among the consular tribunes, (B.C. 381,) and marched out with an army against the allied enemies. One part of the Roman forces was put to flight ; but Camillus checked the fugitives, and led them against the enemy, who was compelled to retreat. Whether he gained a real victory, and took the enemy's camp, 8 is very uncertain ; at any rate the Praenestines were not much weakened, for in the very next year they ravaged the Roman territory, and advanced as far as the Colline gate. T. Quinctius Cincinnatus was then appointed dictator, and im mediately raised an army, before which the enemy retreated until they reached the Allia, where they offered battle. The Romans, however, gained the day, and put them to flight. Quinctius pursued them, and in nine days he took nine towns, eight of winch belonged to Praeneste : on the tenth day; Praeneste itself fell into the hands of the Romans. On the twentieth d<iy after his appointment to the dictatorship, Quinctius celebrated his triumph.9 The war against Antium was brought to a close in B.C. 376: Satricum was recovered ; and the An tiatans were cut to pieces at Tusculum. After this, Rome was for a time prevented from further foreign enterprises by the disputes occasioned by the Licinian rogations. The period from the decemvirate, down to the destruction of Rome by the Gauls, had been one of increasing prosperity for the plebeians : many families had received assignments of land in the 5 Liv. vi. 24. liant victory, was the oldest among the 9 An inscription on a golden -wreath, inscriptions at Rome of which the pre which Quinctius dedicated in the cise age was known.

Veientine territory and elsewhere ; the booty taken in the wars, if carefully husbanded, must have yielded considerable advantages to many ; and the pay which the soldiers received took a heavy burden from them. Dming the whole of that period of about half a century, we hear no complaints of any harsh application of the law of debt. But the invasion of the Gauls, accompanied as it was with the destruction of Borne and the devastation of the country all around, put an end to the thriving prosperity of the Eomans. The losses sustained through the barbarians, the rebuilding of the city, the purchase of new cattle and agricultural implements, and in addition to all this, the necessity of a high rate of taxation, led to a general state of debt among those whose means were not above mediocrity. In order to raise the reduced population, the inhabitants of four neighbouring districts received the full Boman franchise, and were formed into four new tribes, so that henceforth the number of tribes was 25.10 The wealthy Eomans, chiefly patricians, again began to act the revolting part of usurers, and again endeavoured to deprive the plebeians of the rights which had been secured to them by solemn treaties. Many a poor plebeian now again eked out his wretched existence in the dungeon of his cruel creditor, and hundreds of others had nothing but the prospect of a similar fate before them. M. Manlius, the deliverer of the Capitol, whose ambition was wounded by the neglect of his fellow-patricians, and by the repeated appointments of Camnlus to the highest dignities, opened for himself a new road to distinction. He took pity upon the poor and helpless debtors ; and one day, as he saw one of his old and brave fellow- soldiers carried away in fetters by an usurer, Manlius generously paid the debt on the spot, and restored the man to his family. The people who saw the man, and heard his sad tale, felt that his case was only one out of a hundred similar ones, and were roused to indignation at the hard-heartedness of the rich. Manlius at the same time declared in public, that so long as he possessed a single pound of brass, 10 Liv. vi. 5."], [188, "168 HISTORY OF ROME. he would not allow a Eoman citizen to be carried into slavery for debt ; and he kept his word faithfully ; for upwards of 400 citizens were rescued by him from imprisonment, by lending them money without interest. He thus gained the honourable appel lation of the \" father of the people ;\" and plebeians of all classes were frequently observed to visit his house on the Capitoline. The irritation, which his popularity produced, was increased by a charge which he made against the patricians; for he said that they had embezzled some of the gold levied to cover the ransom of the city from the Gauls, and he demanded that the sum should be refunded for the purpose of a general liquidation of debts. In B.C. 385, A. Cornelius Cossus, who was raised to the dictatorship to conduct the war against the Volscians, ordered Manlius to be thrown into prison, for attempting to create sedition among the people, and for slandering the patri cians. Many of the plebeians put on mourning, as for then most faithful friend and patron ; they thronged around liis prison ; and some even muttered threats that they would release him by force. The senate then restored liim to liberty, either because they began to be alarmed, or because no evidence could be brought against him. When he was again among his friends, their language naturally became fiercer and more menacing than before ; and though it may have been an unfounded charge that he aimed at kingly power, yet Manlius had now become an extremely dangerous citizen. Two tribunes, probably with no other object than to induce him to quit Borne, impeached him before the centuries, charging him with high treason. His own friends forsook him ; but when he reminded the people of the battles he had fought, and of what the republic owed to him, they felt that they could not condemn him. As this, however, was not the way to remove the danger and restore peace, the same charge was then brought against him before the curiae. The patrician court condemned him to death. Whether he had acted as an open rebel before, or whether the sentence of condemnation drove him into rebellion, is uncertain, but he was now at war with the"], [189, "M.

A traitor, who pretended to communicate to him some secret information, led him to a lonely spot on the edge of the Tarpeian rock, and pushed him down, in B.C. 38411. An ordinance was forthwith passed, that in future no patrician should be allowed to reside on the Capitoline ; the house of Manlius was razed to the ground ; and the gens of the Manlii resolved that none of its members should ever again bear the praenomen Marcus. But the people mourned over him ; and a pestilence and famine, which followed soon after, were regarded as a punish ment sent by the gods to avenge the deliverer of their temples. In order to appease the people, the senate, in B.C. 383, resolved to assign to the plebeians the Pomptine district, which the tribunes had demanded four years before ; but with the exception of a few, all the new settlers were soon after cut to pieces by the enemies of Borne : the distress among the poor also increased from day to day. The number of free citizens was now rapidly diminishing, and Borne would have become a miserable oligarchy, had not her decline been arrested by two bold tribunes, who changed the fate of then country, and with it that of the world. 11 This is evidently the true account. (Dion Cass.Fragm. xxxi.ed.Reimarus; Zonar. vii. 24). Livy's story, which is incorrect and contradictory, seems to have been made up to excuse the Romans, who were ashamed of this das tardly piece of treachery committed against the greatest man of the age.

SEXTIUS, WITH THEIR LEGISLATION \u2014 NEW CCRULE OFFICES, AND PARTICIPATION OF THE PLEBEIANS IN THE HIGHEST MAGIS- TRACIES WARS WITH THE HERNICANS, ETRUSCANS, AND GADLS. A general state of debt and poverty, such as existed at Eome after its capture by the Gauls, usually leads to revolutions, in which the state and its constitution perish ; but at Eome things turned out differently : the moderation and perseverance of the men who undertook to remedy the evil, as well as of those who were suffering under it, not only prevented such a calamity, but enabled the two reformers, C. Licinius Stolo and L. Sextius, to lay the foundation of Eome's regeneration and real greatness. They were elected tribunes for the year B . c . 3 7 6, and set about their task with a view to improve the physical condition of the plebeians, and to give them that political influence which might in future secure them against the arbitrary and domineering spirit of the patricians, and thus prevent then falling back into the miserable condition in which patrician avarice and love of dominion had placed them. There always has been and always will be a class of persons who, being themselves incapable of a generous and disinterested action, are ever ready to trace the measures of great men to some vulgar or base motive ; and the love of scandal is never at a loss to invent such motives. This has been the case with the legislation of C. Licinius; but here, unfortunately, the slanderous tale of the circumstance that urged him on to his legislation has become fh-mly rooted in history. C. Licinius was married to Fabia, the younger daughter of the patrician M. Fabius Ambus-"], [191, "LEGISLATION OF C. LICINIUS. 171 tus : her elder sister was married to Ser. Sulpicius, who was con sular tribune in the same year in which Licinius was tribune of the plebs. The younger Fabia, it is said, was one day on a visit at her sister's, and was frightened by the noise of the lictors who accompanied Sidpicius as he returned home from the forum. The elder Fabia, accustomed to such things, laughed at her sister's fear, and remarked, that such occurrences would not be startling to her, if she were not married to a plebeian. Stimu lated by vanity, the younger Fabia now entreated her father and husband not to rest until her husband too shoidd enjoy the same honours as Sulpicius. And this wretched piece of female vanity is said to have driven Licinius to his legislation.1 But the absurdity of the tale is too obvious to deserve the least confidence ; for the younger Fabia was assuredly acquainted with such scenes, as her own father had been consular tribune in B.C. 381, and her husband, though a plebeian, was not excluded froni that office : but what is more than all is, that the things which Fabia coveted are not by any means those which Licinius aimed at in his legislation; for his object was to abolish the consular tribuneship, and to throw the consulship open to the plebeians. C. Licinius found a faithful and sympathising friend in his colleague, L. Sextius. Hitherto the tribunes had endeavoured to protect then order by stopping the levies of troops, and by other means which then office suggested ; but they had seldom been able to gain any great and permanent advantages, or effectually and thoroughly to re move the causes of the distress of the plebeians : Licinius and Sextius saw the evil, and resolved to apply a radical cure. They proposed three laws : first, that the amount of interest which debtors had paid up to that time should be deducted from the principal, and that the remainder should be paid off by three yearly instalments ; secondly, that no one should be allowed to possess more than five hundred jugera of the public land, or keep 1 Liv. vi. 34 ; Zonar. vii. 24. I 2"], [192, "172 HISTORY OF ROME. upon it more than one hundred large and five hundred small cattle, and that any one acting contrary to this law shoidd be compelled to pay a heavy fine ; thirdly, that henceforth consuls should be elected instead of considar tribunes, and that one of the consuls should always be a plebeian. The first of these laws was in reality a violation of justice, but one which in extreme cases has frequently been resorted to, not only in ancient but also in modern times. The second was an agrarian law, that is, a law which concerned the public land, without in the least inter fering with private property;2 and it was intended by it that the land above five hundred jugera which a person possessed should be taken from him and distributed among the poor plebeians. The third law had become necessary, because it was evident that the plebeians could never reckon upon being represented in the highest magistracy, unless the patricians were compelled to yield by a positive law; for although the plebeians were ebgible to the consular tribuneship, yet the patricians in most cases had con trived to exclude them; and where this could not be done the senate had frequently ordained the appointment of consuls, instead of consular tribunes, whereby the plebeians were effectu ally excluded and silenced. The alarm which these bills created among the patricians may easily be imagined : the only means they knew of averting the danger was one they had often tried before : they gained over all the eight other tribunes, who were induced to oppose the rogations of then two colleagues, and prevent the bills being put to the vote in the assembly of the tribes. Licinius and Sextius, however, made use also of then right of intercession, and, pre venting the election of consular tribunes for the year following, allowed the tribes only to elect their aediles and tribunes. In this manner the straggle was carried on for five years, from 2 Some German scholars deny this: vate property; but this opinion has they believe that the law was not an been most completely refuted by G. agrarian, but a sumptuary law, and that Long in the Classical Museum, vol. ii. it was intended to set a limit to pri- p. 307, &c, and vol. iii. p. 78, &c."], [193, "LEGISLATION OF C. LICINIUS. 173 B.C. 376 to 371, while Licinius and Sextius were re-elected to the tribuneship year after year.3 Rome was in a state of perfect anarchy, and it was a great piece of good fortune that no foreign foe took the field against Rome during that period. In B.C. 371 the tribunes at length allowed the election of consular tribunes, because the Veliternians were laying waste the Roman territory, and had attacked Tusculum, which called upon Rome for aid. The levy of an army, however, was a matter of some difficulty; but Tus culum was delivered, and Velitrae itself besieged by the Romans, though with little success. Licinius and Sextius still continued to be re-elected year after year ; and the opposition of then colleagues gradually ceased, so that in B.C. 369 only five of them set themselves against the rogations. As Licinius now found that his cause was gaining ground, he brought forward a fourth bill, that instead of the two men, who had hitherto been entrusted with the keeping of the Sibylline books, ten should be appointed; and that half of them should be plebeians. This measure was probably devised to meet the objections which the patricians were in the habit of making against plebeians being raised to the consulship, viz., that the plebeians had not the same auguries as the patricians, and had no knowledge to interpret the will of the gods. The new law of Licinius was intended to procure that very knowledge for the plebeians, which had before enabled the patricians to prevent or stop the proceedings of the popular assemblies. The five tribunes who still opposed the rogations insisted on deferring all discussions upon them, imtil the soldiers engaged in the siege of Velitrae shoidd have returned home. When the army returned, the tribunes, who were then all ani mated by the same spirit, resolved to bring the passing of the bills to a decision. The patricians had recourse to the last extremity: they appointed M. Furius Camillus, the aged conqueror of the Gauls, to the dictatorship, B.C. 368. When the tribes 3 Liv. vi. 35 ; Lydus, de Magutrat. anarchy lasted only four years. Eu i. 36. Others, however, state that the trop. ii. 1. ; Vopiscus, Tacit, i."], [194, "174 HISTORY OF ROME. were already engaged in voting, Camillus ordered them to quit the forum, and even threatened to use force ; but the tribunes opposed him with quiet determination. As Camillus saw that Iris threats oidy exasperated the plebeians, and as the tribunes threatened to get him fined in the sum of 500,000 ases, if he continued to act as dictator and disturb the proceedings of the plebeians, he abdicated; and P. Manlius was appointed in his stead to appease the ferment. In order to show his fair spirit towards the commonalty, he chose the plebeian, C. Licinius Calvus, a relation of the lawgiver, for his master of the horse. In the meantime the people had grown lukewarm in the support of their noble champions, and were not unwilling, as it appears, to sacrifice all permanent advantages, if they coidd but obtain momentary relief; but at the close of his ninth tribuneship, C. Licinius con sented to be re-elected, for the tenth time, only on condition of the people promising him to pass all his rogations. This determi nation frightened the patricians in the highest degree : they exerted all then- powers to thwart the tribunes ; and foremost among them was App. Claudius Crassus. Licinius and Se'xtius, however, were elected tribunes for the tenth time; the bill respect ing the keeping of the Sibylline books was passed, and the ple beians again allowed consular tribunes to be appointed, for the year B.C. 367. In the meantime a report reached Rome that a band of Gauls had returned and invaded the Roman territory. M. Furius Camillus was appointed dictator a fifth time, and defeated the Gauls in the Alban district. Many thousands were slain, and the rest dispersed, and Camillus returned to Rome in triumph. After this, the contest about the Licinian rogations became fiercer than ever : the struggles were immense, but the patricians were com pelled to yield : the bills were passed in due form, and sworn to by both estates. L. Sextius himself was elected the first plebeian consid, B.C. 366; but as the cmiae still refused to sanction the election, the confla gration which had scarcely been extinguished, burst forth again :"], [195, "PRAETORSHIP AND CURULE AEDILES. 175 terrible threats were held out by the plebeians, and things nearly came to a secession.* The mediation of the dictator at length prevailed upon the patricians to yield. The concession, how ever, was not made without their endeavouring to limit it as much as possible ; the principal part of the consular jurisdic tion was taken away from the consuls, and vested in a new magistrate called the praetor, who was to be elected from among the patricians exclusively. In this manner the patricians endea voured to retain for themselves the knowledge of the law, and the right of interpreting it. At the same time two patrician aediles (aediles curides) were appointed5 along with the plebeian aediles, with whom they were to share the criminal jurisdiction in annual rotation. The aediles further had the superintendence of the police, the temples, and the great festivals, for the celebration of which they received funds from the public treasury, untd about the time of the first Punic war, when it became customary for the aediles to defray the expenses out of their own purse. Camillus, who in the end had acted the part of a mediator between the two orders, vowed a temple to Concord, to express his gratitude for the happy issue of the contest. Peace was now restored, and the plebeians had acquired the right of being elected to the consulship : its power had been greatly cm-tailed by the institution of the censorship and prae torship, which were reserved for the patricians; but the latter were nevertheless greatly annoyed at having been obliged to share the consular dignity with the plebeians. At first, they contrived to keep the plebeian consul in inactivity; and on one occasion they openly rejoiced at the misfortune of a plebeian consul in the field. Afterwards, repeated and most desperate efforts were 4 According to Ovid, Fast. i. 643, &.C., matters really did come to a seces sion, and the plebeians took up arms and gathered together.

In B.C. 358 the tribune C. Poetelius, on the instigation of the patricians, proposed a law de ambitu, that is, a law to prevent persons employing illegal means for the purpose of being elected to a magistracy, which is expressly stated to have been devised to check the ambition of the plebeians. Many years had yet to pass before the patricians saw the necessity of giving up then pretensions, and before a hearty concord and good feeling became established between the two orders. As, however, the right of the plebeians to the highest magistracy was once established, the patricians, with all their intrigues and reckless violence, could not prevent their acquiring one after another those dignities, which as yet the patricians had reserved for themselves. As early as B.c. 356 the plebeian C. Marcius Kutilus was raised to the dictatorship; in B.C. 351 we find the same person as the first plebeian censor; and in B.C. 337 Q. Publilius Philo was the first plebeian praetor. Lastly, the Ogulnian law, in B.C. 300, threw the priestly dignities of augnr and pontiff open to the plebeians. In this manner the ancient dis tinction between patricians and plebeians gradually disappeared; and Rome, internally united and strengthened, prepared herself for her great calling of being the ruler of the world. The carrying into effect the agrarian law of Licinius must have met with the same stubborn unwillingness on the part of those who possessed more land than the law allowed. It is a sad fact that in B.C. 357, C. Licinius, the lawgiver himself, is re corded to have been the first who was sentenced to pay a fine of 10,000 ases, for occupying 1000 jugera of the public domain; 500 being in his own name, and 500 in that of his son, whom he had emancipated for the sake of appearances. But what he did was unquestionably not an uncommon thing with others ;6 and his case 6 Appian. Bell. Civ. i. 8, in fin."], [197, "THE LAW OF DEBT. 177 is especially mentioned only because it was the most glaring, the giver of the law being the first to violate-it. It must have been a matter of very great difficulty to carry into effect the law relating to debts, for many a poor debtor un- doubtedly was unable to pay off his debt by the three instalments prescribed by law. Such persons were obliged to borrow again, in order to be able to comply with the command of the law ; and as at that time money could not be got except at a very high rate of interest, the usurers again began then speculations, whence in a short time the misery of the poor became as great as it had ever been before ; for the severe law of debt still continued in force, and the relief which Licinius had afforded the poor was only momentary. In order to stop the ruinous proceedings of the usurers, the tribunes M. Duilius and L. Maenius, in B.C. 357, carried a law, under great opposition from the patricians, which established the uncial rate of interest (foenus unciarium), that is, ten per cent, for the civil year of twelve months, and a heavy fine upon any one who shoidd violate the law. In B.C. 352 other measures were adopted for the benefit of poor debtors : five commissioners (quinqueviri mensarii) were appointed for a gene- ral liquidation of debts; and the commissioners were to advance money, from the public treasury, to those who were unable to pay then debts but could give security to the state. Those who could give no security could not be helped at all, but remained in the same miserable condition as before. In B.C. 347 the rate of the uncial interest was reduced one-half, (semiunciarium foenus) ; that is, the rate of interest henceforth was 5 per cent., and a term of three years was granted for paying off the princi- pal ; one-fourth was to be paid immediately, and the remainder by three equal instalments. But all these regulations were of use only to those who had some property, and no remedy could be found for those who were quite impoverished. It is not im- possible that the mysterious insurrection of the Eoman army at Capua, in B.C. 342, may have arisen from the irremediable dis- tress of a large class of Romans. i 3"], [198, "178 HISTORY OF ROME. In B.C. 365, after the building of the temple of Concord was completed, Camillus, then at the age of eighty, died of the plague, which broke out at Rome and raged for several years. In order to appease the gods, to whose wrath the calamity was ascribed, the Romans had recourse to several superstitious rites and ceremonies : lectisternia, or repasts for the gods, were pre pared ; and scenic plays were performed, such as had been customary in Etruria long before, but had never yet been exhi bited at Eome. But the disease did not give way; and in addition to it, the Tiber overflowed its banks, and deluged the lower parts of the city. There was a report, that a pestilence had once been averted in Etruria by a nail being driven into the wall of a temple ; and forthwith L. Manhus was appointed dictator in B.C. 363, to perform this ceremony in the Capitoline temple. But after the ceremony was over, the dictator, as though he had been appointed for the purpose of a war, began to levy an army, declaring that war must be made against the Hemicans. AU the tribunes rose against this arbitrary mode of acting, and Manhus was obliged to lay down his office. In the year following he was impeached by the tribune, M. Pomponius, before the people, on account of the severity and cruelty with which he had attempted to carry on the levy. Manhus, in general, was known as a man of a most haughty and domineering disposition,7 which he showed not only towards strangers, but to his nearest relatives. When his son, who was at the time in the country, heard of the charges brought against his father, and learned that one of them referred to the cruelty with which he himself had been treated, he hastened to Borne ; and, with a dagger concealed under his garment, he proceeded early in the morning to the house of the tribune, and demanded a private interview with him. On being admitted, he threatened to murder Pomponius on the spot, unless he promised on his oath to drop the accusation against Manhus. The intimidated and 7 Hence his surname of Imperiosus."], [199, "WARS WITH THE ETRUSCANS AND HERNICANS. 179 defenceless tribune promised to do as he was bid. The people, instead of being exasperated at the young man's conduct, admired his filial affection so much, that they elected him one of the mili tary tribunes or lieutenants.3 In the same year, it is related, an earthquake occurred, which produced a large and deep chasm in the middle of the forum. The people endeavoured to fill it up with earth, but in vain; and the soothsayers declared that it could not be filled up, unless Eome threw into it the most precious thing she possessed. A young warrior of the name of M. Curtius, in full armour, mounted his war-horse, and praying to the infernal gods, leaped into the chasm, declaring that Eome had nothing more precious than warlike virtue. The chasm closed over him ; and in its place a lake arose, which from that occurrence was believed to have derived its name of the Curtian lake (lacus Curtius).0 For some time after the passing of the Licinian laws, the Eomans abstained from making war upon any of their neigh- bours, for the purpose of not giving to a plebeian consul an opportunity of distinguishing himself. When in B.C. 366 the war against the Hernicans was decreed, and it fell to the lot of the plebeian consul, L. Genucius, to undertake the command in it, every one was anxiously looking forward to see how he might succeed. Unfortunately, he was drawn into a snare by the enemy : his legions were dispersed, and he himself was surrounded and killed. When the tidings of this misfortune were brought to Eome, the patricians, instead of lamenting the public calamity, rejoiced at the failure of the plebeian consul. So much for their patriotism! In order to prevent a plebeian baring again the command in war, App. Claudius was appointed dictator ; and the same means were resorted to in each of the three sub sequent years. App. Claudius, after having raised reinforce- 8 Up to this time the generals them- the assembly of the centuries. selves had appointed their lieutenants 9 For a different legend see Liv. or military tribunes, but in this year 12, &c. ; Plut.

A battle was fought, in which many fell on both sides; but the Eomans at length succeeded in driving the Hemieans back to their camp ; and on the next day the enemies were routed, leaving their camp and the wounded in the hands of the Eomans. But the latter also had lost the fourth part of their army. In the year following, the Hernican town of Ferentinum was taken; and as Tibur had shut its gates against the Eomans as they passed by, war was declared against it. About the same time, the Gauls made another inroad, and pitched their camp at a short distance from Eome, on the banks of the Anio. T. Quinetius Pennus was called to the dictatorship, to conduct the war against them. This war is celebrated for the poetical story of the single eombat of the brave T. Manlius with the Gallic giant. While the hostile armies were encamped opposite each other, a Gaul of gigantic stature challenged the bravest of the Eomans to fight with him ; and T. Manlius, the same who had intimidated the tribune Pomponius the year before, came forward. He nimbly avoided the stroke of his adversary's sword, stepped behind his shield, and pierced him with his sword through the side and belly. The monster fell, and his body covered a large space of ground. Manlius took the gold chain (torques) of the Gaid, and put it around his own neck, whence he received the surname of Tor quatus. After this glorious victory of young Manlius, the Gauls broke up their camp, marched to Tibur, and thence to Campania. Tibur assisted the Gauls or did homage to them, and as war had been declared against it, the consul C. Poetelius, in B.C. 360, led an army against the Tiburtines. The Gauls now returned from Campania to assist their friends, and ravaged the territories of some towns which were allied with Eome. A dictator was a\u00b0-ain appointed, and a battle was fought near the Colline gate. The Gauls were put to flight, and were received by the consul Poetelius, who drove them, together with the Tiburtines, into the town of Tibur, and thus gained a triumph over both. In the meantime"], [201, "181 WARS WITH THE GAULS AND ETRUSCANS. the Hernicans had been conquered by the other consul, M. Pabius. In B.C. 359 the Tiburtines made an attempt to take Eome by surprise at night, but as soon as the watchful Eomans made then appearance outside the gates the enemy took to flight. About this time the Etruscans of Tarquinii commenced ravaging the territory of Eome, and as they refused to make reparation, war was declared against them in b.c 358: the consul, C. Pabius, received the command in it, while his col league, C. Plautius, took the field against the Hernicans. In order to increase the number of her citizens, Eome added two new tribes to the twenty-five already existing. She was now engaged against two formidable enemies ; and a third, the Gauls, were daily expected to renew then- hostilities. Eome, however, was at the same time strengthened by the renewal of the ancient alliance with Latium. The Gauls soon made their appearance in the Praenestine territory and about Pedum. C. Sulpicius was raised to the dictatorship ; and having selected the best men from the consular armies, he led his troops against the Gauls. He, being a great general, seeing that the enemy lost daily in strength and numbers, resolved to wear them out, and for that purpose established himself in a fortified camp. The Eoman soldiers, on the other hand, burnt with a desire to be led out to battle ; but when at length he was forced to give way to their clamour, his prudence became manifest, for the legions were driven back to their camp, and were saved only by despair and a stratagem, which made the Gauls flee into the woods, whither they were eagerly pursued by the Eomans. C. Sulpicius was honoured with a triumph ; and the gold he took as booty was walled up in the Capitoline temple. Por several years after this victory we hear no more of Gallic invasions. The consul C. Plautius had, in the meantime, con quered the Hernicans ; but then- final reduction was not brought about till B.C. 306. C. Pabius had been less successful against the Tarquinians, for they not only defeated his army, but slaughtered 307 Eoman soldiers, who had been taken prisoners."], [202, "182 HISTORY OF ROME. The Paliscans assisted the Tarquinians, and refused to restore those Eomans who, during their flight, had taken refuge at Falerii. In B.c. 357 the consul Cn. Manhus undertook the com- mand against the Tarquinians and Faliscans, while his colleague led an army against the Privernatans, who had ravaged the Eoman territory, for which he allowed his men to plunder and lay waste then- country in return. The Privernatans ventured upon a battle, but were driven back into their town, which immedi- ately surrendered. Cn. Manhus accomplished nothing of any con- sequence : he committed, however, the ii-regularity of assembling his troops in the camp, near Sutrium, and, treating them as an assembly of the tribes, made them pass a law, enacting that any one who manumitted a slave shoidd pay to the treasury the twentieth part of his value. This law was, without hesitation, sanctioned by the curies, because it brought money into the public purse, and also because it was a check upon manumissions, which must have been frequent at the time. But the tribunes, though they did not object to the law, looked upon it as a dangerous precedent, and foresaw that if it were allowed to pass, the consuls would in future be enabled to get any measure passed by the soldiers, who were bound to them by their military oath. They therefore proposed and carried a law, forbidding, under penalty of death, the transacting of business with the people in any other but the proper place. M. Fabius Ambustus, the succes- sor of Cn. Manhus, was put to flight on his first encounter with the Etruscans ; for they frightened the Eomans by assuming the appearance of furies, carrying torches and snakes in their hands ; but when the Eomans discovered the delusion, they attacked the enemy with double vehemence : the Etruscans were put to flight; and then- camp and immense booty fell into the hands of the Eomans. This defeat is said to have roused all the Etruscans, who, under the guidance of the Tarquinians and Faliscans, advanced as far as the salt-works (Salinas), near the mouth of the Tiber. C. Marcius Eutilus, a plebeian, was now raised to the dictatorship ; and the more obstinately the"], [203, "WARS WITH THE GAULS AND ETRUSCANS. 183 patricians refused to provide him with the means necessary for carrying on the war, the more readily was he supplied with everything by the people. As soon as he was able, he took the field, and by skilful man\u0153uvres cut to pieces several detach ments of the Etruscans, whom he found engaged in laying waste the country. At length he took the enemy's camp and 8000 prisoners: the rest were killed, or had escaped by flight. In the year following, the internal feuds about the consulship rendered foreign enterprises impossible ; but in B.C. 354, the Eomans took fearful vengeance for the murder of then prisoners by the Tarquimans, for out of the immense numbers of Etruscan cap tives, 358 of the most distinguished were selected and sent to Eome, and all the rest were put to the sword. The people of Eome ordered the 358 to be scourged, and to be beheaded in the forum. In the same year Tibur was forced to surrender to the Eomans. These brilliant achievements of the Eoman arms, or, what is more probable, the fear of the Gallic hordes that ranged through Italy, induced the Samnites to seek an alliance with Eome. It was willingly granted them by the senate. It was discovered, in the meantime, that the inhabitants of Caere had joined the Tarquinians in then ravages of the Eoman territory, and war was therefore declared against them in B.C. 353. T. Manlius was to conduct the war against them as dictator ; but Caere, feeling that it was unable to cope with Eome, sent ambassadors to sue for pardon. The senate referred the matter to the people ; and the latter, it is said, gratefully remembering the services done by Caere during the Gallic calamity, granted peace and pardon to the Caerites, with whom a truce was con cluded for 100 years: but we know from another source,1\" that Caere purchased peace at the hard price of half its territory. The Eomans now directed their arms against the Faliscans ; as, however, the latter did not make their appearance in the field, 10 Dion Cass. Fragm. 142."], [204, "184 HISTORY OF ROME. the army returned to Eome. Immediately after, it was reported that the twelve Etruscan tribes had conspired against Eome, and under the influence of the alarm thus created C. Julius Julus was appointed dictator ; but it soon came out that the report was a fabrication, and that the dictator's object was only to try to get two patricians elected to the consulship. When this end was gained, the two consuls, of B.C. 351, marched out against the Tarquinians and Faliscans. The Etruscans did not come forward ; and the Eomans were satisfied with ravaging their territories. Both parties now grew tired of this state of warfare ; and when the Tarquinians sued for a truce, it was willingly granted by the senate for a period of forty years. In B.C. 350 an immense host of Gauls again appeared in the neighbourhood of Eome, and pitched their camp in Latium. As L. Cornelius Scipio, one of the consuls of the year, was ill, Iris colleague, M. Popillius Laenas, undertook the command against them, and encamped on an eminence opposite the camp of the Gauls. The latter attempted to storm the bill, but were repulsed. Popillius Laenas himself was wounded, and for a time the issue of the contest was doubtful ; but the consul rallied his troops, and led them on to a fresh attack: he succeeded in scattering the thick hosts, and compelled them to take refuge in the Alban mountains. There they formed a new encampment, leaving the other as a prey to the Eomans, who did not pursue them any further. The Gauls maintained themselves in the mountains during the ensuing winter, making predatory excursions into Latium : it was thus reserved for L. Furius Canhllus, in his consulship B.c. 349, to bring the war to a close. He collected all the forces of Eome and her allies, and having put the city itself into a proper state of defence, marched out against the enemy, who seem to have descended from the mountains into the Pomptme district. When the hostile armies met, one of the Gauls, according to the cus tom of his nation, challenged any Eoman to single combat.\" 11 The account of this single com- Gallic giant, is no more than a poetical bat, like that of Manlius with the story."], [205, "185 WAR AGAINST THE VOLSCIANS. M. Valerius, a young military tribune, with the permission of the consul, accepted the challenge ; but when he attacked the barba rian, a raven, which had settled upon the helmet of the Eoman, at each onset flew into the face of the Gaul, assailing him with his beak and wings. The barbarian, unable to see, was slain by Valerius, who received the surname of Corvus (that is, the Eaven). When the conqueror was collecting the spoil of his enemy, the Gauls tried to prevent it, and thence a fight arose which ended in a general battle. The Eomans were victorious ; and the Gauls, it is said, fled through the country of the Volscians to the Vulturous, and thence into Apulia. The account of then flight is very doubtful ; but it is certain, that from that time the Gauls never again entered Latium, and that Camillus, whatever his victory may have been, was the conqueror of the Gauls, and the deliverer of Eome. For a long time to come the Eomans had rest from the Gallic wars, which had been a real school of training for them, and from which they went forth as perfect warriors, pre pared to encounter any enemy that might venture to check then progress. About this time the coast of Latium was infested by a Greek fleet, which frequently landed to plunder the country. Who these Greeks were, and whence they came, is a perfect mystery.12 It is, however, not improbable that the appearance of these pirates occasioned the renewal of the ancient treaty with Carthage, which took place in B.C. 348. 13 As Carthage was then mistress of the sea, she had it in her power to protect the Eomans, who at that time had no ships except for commercial purposes. Satricum had been occupied by a Volscian colony from An tium, but the Latins destroyed the place ; and the Antiatans in B.C. 346 were reported to have excited the Latins to revolt against 12 Livy thinks that they came from the treaty preserved in Polyhius (iii. the Sicilian tyrants ; but at that time 24), who does not mention the time they had no fleets, and could not have at which it was concluded; for the ventured out on the sea, which was treaty of b.c. 306, is expressly called under the dominion of Carthage. by Livy (ix. 43), the third. 13 Liv. vii. 27.

The booty was given to the soldiers ; and the prisoners were sold on account of the republic. The alliance with Latiiun became weaker and weaker, in consequence of the commanding tone which Eome assumed; and several occur rences in the late wars with the Gauls and Volscians betrayed the state of feeling among the Latins. In short, it became more and more evident that the alliance between Eome and Latium coidd not last much longer, and that one of them must be compelled to obey the other."], [207, "187 CHAPTEE XL THE FIR3T WAR AGAINST THE SAMNITES. THE SUBJUGATION OF LATIUM. -THE PUBLILIAN LAWS. The wars in which Eome was involved, during the period we are now entering upon, were far more important than any of the earlier ones : their enemies themselves were more powerful ; and the wars had to be carried on in distant countries. The Samnites, with whom Eome now came in contact, were a populous and wealthy nation, inhabiting a large extent of country : Lucania and Campania had been colonised by them, but had by this time become estranged from their mother country. The Samnites, however, were still the most powerfid and warlike nation in Italy, and far superior to Eome and her allies, both in the num ber of their population, and in the extent of territory which they occupied. Then state was a confederation of four cantons, and then- union made the nation strong. The history of their wars with Eome, of their unshaken perseverance, of then- sufferings and final destruction, is greatly falsified by the vanity of the Eomans, whose anxiety to gloss over any reverse they suffered, often renders it almost impossible to restore the real history, and exhibit the events in then- natural connection. The peace and alliance which the Samnites had concluded with Eome lasted little more than ten years, after which period the course of the war which then broke out is related as fol lows : \u2014 The Samnites had made war upon the Sidicinians ; and the latter, despairing of then- own power, sought the assistance of the Campanians. But the Campanians, the most luxurious and effeminate among the people of Italy, were defeated by the"], [208, "188 HISTORY OF ROME. Samnites in the first battle, and retreated to Capua. The Sam nites, deferring the war against the Sidicinians, followed the Campanians, and pitched their camp on the heights of Tifata, which overlooked Capua. Erom these hills they ravaged the plains below, and in a battle, which at last the Campanians ventured upon, drove them back into their city. The Samnites, satisfied with their booty, now seem to have returned ; and the Campa nians, who had lost the flower of their youth, applied to Eome for aid. The Eomans, it is said, at first scrupled to afford the Campanians any assistance, on accoimt of then own alliance with the Samnites ; but when the Campanians threw themselves and their country into the arms of the Eomans, and offered as subjects to acknowledge then sovereignty, they then thought it right to support then subjects rather than their allies. This account, which we read in Livy,1 is evidently a fabrication ; for it is obvious, from the subsequent history, that Capua was not in the relation of a subject state to Eome, but merely allied ; and Livy's account was devised only for the purpose of disguising the faithlessness of the Eomans towards their Samnite allies. The Samnites, on being informed by Eoman ambassadors of the new alliance with Capua, and being requested to abstain from hostilities towards the latter, declared the conduct of the Eomans a breach of peace, and forthwith ordered their army to invade Campania. In B.C. 343 two consular armies took the field against the Samnites : the one, under M. Valerius Corvus, went to Campania ; the other, under his colleague A. Cornelius Cossus, to Sam nium. The former was a man of the most amiable disposition ; he enjoyed the admiration and confidence of his soldiers ; he sur passed every one by his skill and strength in athletic exercises ; and in the camp he amused himself familiarly with the soldiers, without taking offence at then coarse jokes or losing his dignity.2 On his arrival in Campania, he pitched his camp on Mount 1 VII. 30, &c. in Niebuhr's Hist, of Rome, vol. iii. 2 See the beautiful culogium onhim p. 124, &c."], [209, "FIRST SAMNITE WAR. 189 Gaurus, which was then clad with vines, but is at present barren and naked. The position was unfavourable, but it is not impos sible that the consul may have been driven to it. The battle which was there fought is one of the most important in the his tory of the world, for it decided the contest between the Eomans and Samnites for the sovereignty of Italy. The Eomans had adopted such parts of the Samnite armour, as they thought superior to their own ; but in their unfavourable position they had no choice between victory and annihilation, and the issue was decided by then despair and perseverance. They renewed then attacks incessantly, and with their utmost exertions : thou sands of Samnites had already fallen, but no decisive impression was yet made upon them, and both armies seemed to be resolved to be conquered by nothing but death. The day was already far advanced, when a desperate attack of the Eomans decided the issue of the battle. The Samnites fled in disorder until they reached then- camp, which, however, they abandoned in the fol lowing night. The Samnite soldiers are reported to have said after the battle, that the eyes of the Eomans seemed to them to be on fire, and their features to utter madness ; and that their terrible aspect had compelled them to take to flight. Valerius was saluted by the Campanians as their deliverer ; but another contest yet awaited him before the land was freed from the enemy. His colleague, in the meantime, had led his army through the dangerous mountain-passes of the Apennines in the direction of Beneventum. At first no enemy was to be seen ; but suddenly a whole Samnite army appeared on the heights of the mountains, above the Eomans, hastening down to attack them. Escape seemed impossible ; but the intrepid P. Decius Mus, with a band of soldiers, quickly occupied a height which the Samnites had to pass, and by the most determinate resistance succeeded in enabling his fellow-soldiers to retrace their steps; he could not himself join the consul till the following night, when he and his band fought then way through the surrounding Sam nites with incredible boldness. Decius and his brave comrades"], [210, "190 HISTORY OF ROME. were received in triumph by the consul, and the army which owed its preservation to them. On the next morning the Eo mans attacked the scattered hosts of the Samnites; and 30,000, who had thrown themselves into then- camp, are said to have been cut to pieces. Hereupon the two Eoman armies united in the neighbourhood of Suessula, for there the Samnite army which had been defeated at Mount Gaurus had re-assembled, and having received numerous reinforcements had again com menced ravaging the plains of Campania. The Campanians again entreated Valerius to protect them ; and he at once pitched a small camp, containing only the best of his troops, near that of the enemy; but he acted with great caution. The Samnites were anxious to attack him immediately, but their commanders pre vented it : they soon began to be in want of provisions, and, in order to satisfy their hunger, were dispersed over the country in search of food. This was the moment Valerius had been wait ing for : he made himself master of the feebly-defended camp of the Samnites, while a part of his troops prevented the scattered bands of Samnites from uniting. His success was complete : the Samnites fled in consternation, or laid down then- arms ; and 40,000 shields and 170 standards are said to have been taken by the Eomans.3 Both consuls on their return to Borne were honoured with a triumph over the Samnites, the most formidable enemy that Bonie had yet come in contact with. The fruits of the victories became manifest in the fact, that the Faliscans sought an alliance with Borne, and that even distant Carthage sent ambassadors to congratulate the Eomans, honouring then- valour with a golden crown of twenty-five pounds in weight. The Campanians of Suessa also sent envoys to Borne, requesting her to send a 3 Exaggerations like this frequently occur in the history of members of the Valerian gens, whence it is not impro- bable that they may have been the fabrications of the unscrupulous histo- rian, Valerius of Antium.

In the same year the Latins made war against the Pelignians, who were in alliance with the Samnites. In the year following, B.C. 342, the supreme command of the army of Borne and her allies seems to have been in the hands of the Latins, for Borne was paralysed by an insurrection of the army at Capita ; but though we do not hear of any military achievement, all the advantages gained in the preceding year remained unimpaired. The revolution of the Boman garrison at Capua seems to be a mysterious occurrence : if we look, however, at the legislative measures which were passed at Eome immedi ately after, in the same year, we must conclude that the cause of the insurrection lay in the deplorable condition of a large num ber of poor Eomans, who were involved in debt without any hope or prospect of being relieved. The affluence and luxury of wealthy Capua, thus the story runs, awakened in those Boman legions which formed the garrison of Campania the horrible scheme of murdering, or subduing the inhabitants, and then founding a new state. When the consul C. Martius Butihis, in B.C. 342, undertook the command of the legions in Campania, the scheme had ripened into a complete conspiracy. The consul did all in his power to prevent any outbreak; but when the soldiers became aware of his contrivances, they assembled and marched towards Borne, and having forced the aged T. Quinctius to become then- leader they continued then march, and pitched their camp about eight miles from the city of Eome. In the meantime M. Valerius Corvus had been appointed dictator, and was on his way with an army to meet the insurgents. When the armies were arrayed against each other, the insurgents began to be desirous of peace, and to repent of then crime. Valerius offered them peace ; and the rebels, on the advice of their leader, trusted to Valerius, who then returned to Borne, and caused the senate and people to grant a general amnesty to the insurgents. It was"], [212, "192 HISTORY OF ROME. further enacted, that no soldier should be struck off from the muster-roll without his own consent, and that no one who had served as a tribune of the soldiers should afterwards be appointed a captain (ordinum ductor). The object of the first law seems to have been to prevent debtors, while serving in the anny, from being arrested by their creditors. The story of this insurrection, as sketched above from Livy, is most singular. The rebels, it is said, intended to make them selves masters of Capua ; yet that town is entirely lost sight of in the sequel of the narrative ; and the rebels, in the end, are satisfied with some paltry concessions, as if ashamed of their own designs. But the fact is, that the whole insurrection, in the form in which it has been handed down, has no definite object at all. We know, however, that some very important laws resulted from it ; and these laws furnish us with a key to the understand ing of the real objects of the rebels. Aurelius Victor4 and Ap pian5 say that a large number of people were weighed down by debts ; that the soldiers, being afraid of returning to Borne, and of being seized there by then creditors, tried to take pos session of Capua ; and that Valerius appeased the insurgents by a general cancelling of debts. It is further said, that the tribune Genucius carried a law which forbade the loau of money on interest,6 though this law does not appear to have long remained in force. Another important law, of the same year, enacted that no one should be allowed to be re-elected to the same magis tracy till after an interval of ten years, and that no one should be invested with two eurule offices at a time ; for hitherto it had frequently happened, that an influential patrician had obtained the consulship in two or more successive years, and a consul had not unfrequently held the office of praetor along with the consul ship. Lastly, it was proposed that it should be lawful to elect both consuls from among the plebeians ;7 but whether this bill 4 De Yir. Illustr. 29. 5 Samnit., 1, &c.

Erom all that has been said, there can be no doubt that the insurrection arose at Eome itself; that the poor emigrated, took up arms, and were joined by the sol diers stationed in Campania. When it became evident that force could do nothing, a reconciliation was proposed on the terms con tained in the above-mentioned laws. The alleged design upon Capua seems to be nothing but a false and malicious charge of the patricians, who, in this case, as in that of the Liciman law, traced the salutary regulations of the year b.c 342 to the basest motives. When tranquillity was restored, the Eomans, in b.c 341, con cluded a peace and alliance with the Samnites, on condition of the latter contributing the amount of one year's pay for the Boman soldiers, and fm-nishing them with a supply of corn for three months. The Samnites at the same time were allowed to carry on war against the Sidicinians ; for Borne was on the eve of a great struggle with Latium, whose fidelity had been greatly wavering from even the first year of the war with the Samnites. The Boman legions being withdrawn from Campania, that country saw no safety for itself except in an alliance with Latium. The alliance of the latter country with Borne having now reached a point at which it could not continue, a hard contest ensued, as to whether Borne should be a Latin town, or rule as sovereign over the whole of Latium. P. Decius and T. Manlius were elected consuls for b.c 340, and had to conduct the war against the Latins. The Latins wished to avoid hostilities by an amicable arrangement on fair terms : they sent ambassadors to Eome, declaiing that they were willing to concede that the Boman name should prevail instead of the Latin ; but, with a view to establish a real union between the two nations, they demanded that half the senate should consist of Lathis, and that one of the consuls should always be chosen from among the Latins. This demand was no less offensive to the Eoman people than to the senate and K"], [214, "194 HISTORY OF ROME. the nobles, although no one, looking at the matter with impar tiality, can blame the Latins ; for, allied as they now were with the Campanians, Sidicinians, and Volscians, they were scarcely inferior to Eome and her alties, the Hernicans and Samnites. The Eomans expressed their indignation at the presumptuous proposal of the Latins in the strongest terms ; and the consul, T. Maruius, declared, that if Eome yielded, he would come armed into the senate-house, and cut down the first Latin he saw there. As L. Annius, the spokesman of the Latins, hurried down the steps of the senate-house, he feU from the top to the bottom, and died on the spot ; and the other envoys, so long as they remained within the territory of Eome, were scarcely safe against the violence of the people. War was forthwith declared against the Latins. Two consular armies were destined for the war ; and L. Papi- rius Crassus, as dictator, received the command of the civic legions, and a reserve consisting of the aged in the city. The consuls, with their armies, hastened into Samnium ; and the Latins, instead of attacking Borne, made Campania the scene of the war. The Eomans, united with the Hernicans and Samnites, marched against Capua, and met the army of the Latins encamped near Mount Vesuvius. When the hostile armies were stationed opposite each other, the Boman generals, probably from fear of treachery, since many of the Latin soldiers were well acquainted with the Eomans, who had formerly fought side by side with them, issued a proclamation forbidding every one, under penalty of death, from engaging in single combat at the outposts. The son of the consul, Manlius, who commanded a detachment of the cavalry, being sent out to reconnoitre, met a Tusculan officer, who insidted and provoked him. Young Manlius, unable to control his anger, sought with his enemy, and the arrogant Tusculan fell by his lance. Manlius, intoxicated with joy at his victory, brought the spoils before his father ; but the latter, without mercy, pun ished the violation of military discipline, by ordering his son to be put to death. The comrades of young Manlius burned his corpse with the mournful spoils, and lamented his death, while"], [215, "SUBJUGATION OF LATIUM. 195 his father's heart remained unmoved ; but as long as he lived, all avoided his presence, and cursed the unfatherly man. In the meantime both consuls are said to have had a vision, in which a superhuman being announced to them that the general of one of the belligerent parties, and the whole of the army of the other had become forfeited to the infernal gods and mother Earth. Both agreed, that the one whose army should first begin to waver should devote himself, and the hostile army, to the gods. When on the side where Decius commanded, the lines fell back, Decius fulfilled his vow : he repeated a solemn prayer after the pontiff, and then rushed among the Latins, raging like the spirit of de struction, until he fell pierced by their lances. The Latins then gave way, though still unconquered. The Eomans, on the other hand, were emboldened by the patriotic death of then consid ; and Manlius, after having reinforced himself by the reserve, began the decisive battle in which the Latins were overpowered. Scarcely the fourth part of then army is reported to have escaped : then- camp fell into the hands of the Eomans ; and the number of prisoners, chiefly Campanians, was very great. The Campanians surrendered their city, soon after the battle, upon tolerable terms ; and the Latins, being thus deserted by then allies, could not rally till in their flight they reached the town of Vescia. Numisius, the Latin commander, imploring his countrymen not to give up the war, succeeded in calling forth a general rise of the nation : with a disorderly army he offered a second battle in the neighbourhood of Minturnae. But the vic tory of the Eomans there was so complete, that the whole Latin confederacy broke up, and the towns surrendered one after ano ther. The Latin domain land was distributed among the Boman people, but the plebeians seem to have received but stingy por tions8. The Campanian equites, 1600 in number, who had remained faithful to Borne, received the Boman franchise without the suffrage ; and Capua was obliged to pay to each of them 8 Liv. viii. 12. K 2"], [216, "196 HISTORY OF ROME. an annual pension of 450 denarii, a remarkable proof of the wealth of that city. The Campanian nobles were thus bought over by the Eomans. It is not known what the Samnites gained by these victories ; but it is quite incredible that they should have acted the part of mere spectators during the struggles.9 The town of Antium, against which the dictator, L. Papirius, had conducted a war on the defensive, still continued to hold out ; and this encouraged the Latin towns which had not yet surren dered, as well as others, to make a last and desperate attempt to maintain or recover their independence. An army of Latins, and Volscians, assembled near Pedum in B.C. 339. The consul, Pub lilius Philo, beat the insurgents ; but Pedum was not taken. The Latins, however, at length gave up the hope of conquering Eome in great battles, and each town confined itself to defending its own walls as well as it could, till in B.C. 338 the subjugation of Latium was completed by the consuls, C. Maenius and L. Furius Camillus. The Latins laid down their arms, and Eoman garrisons occupied then towns. The Eoman senate, in order not again to drive the Latins into despair and rebellion, adopted a system of moderation and prudence. The Latin nation was divided : some were raised to the rank of Boman citizens, and thus became alienated from their former friends ; while the most powerful among the Latin towns were weakened and humbled. Thus Aricia, Lanuvium, Nomentum, and Pedum, received the Boman franchise with the suffrage ; and the two new tribes, which were formed soon after, contained probably the most favoured districts of Latium. Capua, Cumae, Suessula, Fundi, and For miae, received the Eoman franchise without the suffrage. The Antiatans were deprived of their ships ; and the beaks of the ships which were destroyed were carried to Eome, where they were walled in as an ornament of the hustings, (suggestion,) from which the orators addressed the people in the assembly10.

The walls of Velitrae were pulled down, its noble families were sent into exile, and its territory was distributed among the Eomans. Tibur and Praeneste lost parts of their territories. The Latin diets were forbidden ; and the right of contracting legal marriages, and of holding landed property, was limited for each Latin to his own particular town; that is, in the language of the Eomans, the connubium and com mercium among the Latin towns were abolished. The two estates of the Eoman republic were now fast advanc- ing towards that state of equality which could alone be the basis of Bome's real greatness, and which was opposed only by that faction among the patricians who lamented over the lost privileges of their order, and were incapable of thinking of any- thing but themselves. Q. Pubhlius Philo, who was dictator in B.c. 339, proposed and carried three laws, which, if they had been proposed by a tribune, would have created the most violent disturbances. The first of these laws enacted, that the curiae should confirm the results of legislative measures brought before the centuries, previous to the commencement of the voting upon them : in other words, the veto of the curiae on any law passed by the centuries was abolished. The second law is reported to us in the same terms as the Valerian law of the year B.C. 449, and the Hortensian of B.C. 287, namely, that the decrees of the plebs (plebiscita) should be binding as laws upon all Boman citizens. Its object undoubtedly was to abolish the sanction of the senate and curiae, which had hitherto been required. The third law ordained that one of the censors should always be a plebeian. AU these laws were passed in due form, though probably not without violent opposition ; and as, two years later, the praetorship was likewise thrown open to the plebeians, internal discord was banished from the republic, and we may date from this time the golden age of Eoman virtue and Eoman greatness. The senate henceforth represents the aristocracy as opposed to the people, who consist of patricians and plebeians indiscriminately. The last vestiges of plebeian inferiority were"], [218, "198 HISTORY OF ROME. removed in B.C. 326, when a law was carried that no plebeian (for plebeians alone were affected by the severe law of debt) should become a nexus, that is, pledge his personal liberty for debt,\" which was further confirmed by the Ogulnian law in b.c. 300. 11 Liv. viii. 23."], [219, "199 CHAPTEE XII. THE SECOND AND THIRD SAMNITE WARS, AND THE WARS AGAINST THE GAULS, ETRUSCANS, AND OTHER ITALIAN NATIONS. INTERNAL HISTORY OF THIS PERIOD. Notwithstanding her peace and affiance with the Samnites, Bome showed her unfair disposition towards them as early as b.c. 340, for in that year she concluded a treaty with Alexander of Epii-us, who had come over to Italy to assist the Tarentines, and had made war against the Samnites. In B.C. 336, a Eoman embassy was sent to the Gauls, and concluded a peace with them,1 the object of which again was no other than to be safe on that side in case of a war with Samnium. Two years later Cales was occupied by a Latin colony of 2500 men, who must be regarded as a garrison on the frontier against Samnium. Fundi and Privemum revolted against Bome in B.C. 330 ; but both towns were reduced, and a heavy punishment was inflicted on them : the surviving inhabitants of Privemum, however, received the Eoman franchise, to prevent their joining the Samnites in a war which Bome knew could not be far distant. In B.C. 329, a Boman colony or garrison was sent to Anxur, and in the year following another to Fregellae, which had formerly been a Volscian town, but had been conquered and destroyed by the Samnites, so that its site and territory had become then- property. All these steps of the Boman senate clearly indicated the existence of a hostile feeling against the Samnites ; but it was more particularly the establishment of the colony at Fregellae which was felt to be the sore point, and the Samnites not only requested the Eomans to do away with it, but threatened to destroy it. 1 Polyb. ii. 19 ; comp. Liv. viii. 17,20."], [220, "200 HISTORY OF ROME. The Samnites had for a long time been in alliance with the Greek towns of Palaepolis and Neapolis, which were only a few miles distant from each other, and formed one state.2 In B.C. 327, a Boman embassy demanded of the Neapolitans atonement for some acts of violence they had committed in the Campanian and Falernian districts, where many Boman plebeians were settled. But, being urged on by Tarentum and Nola not to yield to Eome, but to trust to the Samnites, the Neapohtans dismissed the Eoman envoys and refused to make any reparations at all. A Eoman army under the consul L. Cornelius thereupon marched into Campania, to watch the Samnites and the wavering conduct of Capua, while another army under his colleague, Q. Pubblius Philo, appeared before Palaepolis and Neapolis, and blockaded them both. But provisions were brought into the besieged towns from the sea ; and 6000 Samnites and Nolanians had thrown themselves into the towns, and strengthened then- garrisons. The two armies remained in then- positions during the winter; but in the spring of B.C. 326, the Eomans demanded of the Samnites to withdraw from the place and give up Fregellae. When the Samnites refused, the Eomans declared war against them, and immediately after strengthened themselves by con cluding a treaty and affiance with the Apulians and Lucanians.3 The Samnites made no attempt to relieve Palaepolis, no succours came from Tarentum, and the Samnite garrison by their pride offended those whom they were to protect. Some Pakepolitans, being tired of the war, formed a conspiracy, and opened the gates to the Eomans, while the Samnites had previously been induced to quit the town by false pretences. Palaepolis was destroyed ; but Neapolis, which likewise threw open its gates, concluded a treaty with Eome on favourable terms. The Samnites were indemnified for this loss by the Luca nians renouncing the affiance with Eome, and submitting to the 2 At a later time the name of Neapolis (Naples) seems to have become common for both towns. 3 Liv. viii. 25."], [221, "SECOND SAMNITE WAR. 201 Samnites.4 It cannot be doubted that the Lucanians and Tarentines took part in the war of the Samnites against Eome, although it is not expressly mentioned. Strabo5 speaks of the Samnites having ravaged the coast of Latium; and assuming this statement to be true, we must suppose that they used Tarentine vessels for the purpose. The consul, D. Junius Brutus, marched with his army into Apulia, but met with a desperate resistance on the part of the Vestinians, over whom he gained a dearly-bought victory. He took possession of some towns by storm. As the other consul, L. Fuilus Camillus, was ill, the command of the army which was to enter Samnium was undertaken by the dictator L. Pa- pirius Cursor, who chose Q. Fabius, afterwards honourably suriiamed Maxitnus, as his master of the horse. Some mistake in the auspices obliging the dictator to return to Bome, Q. Fabius, who supplied his place during his absence, received strict orders not to enter into any engagement with the enemy. But the growing boldness of the latter induced Fabius to fight a battle near Imbrinium. He gained a brilliant victory, and the Samnites are said to have lost 20,000 men on that day. The dictator, on hearing of this, immediately hastened back to the army, and would have employed all the severity of the military law against the offender, had he not been protected by the soldiers, who threatened a revolt, if Fabius should be pun- ished. Fabius escaped to Bome, and it was only by the united entreaties of the senate and people that Papirius could be pre- vailed on to pardon him. The dictator, who thus yielded against his own will, was looked upon by all parties as a tyrant, and re gained the goodwill of the soldiers only by promising them all the booty they should make. He then gained a great victory, and his army indulged in plunder far and wide. The Samnites ancient story of Zopyrus. It was invented with a view to disgrace the enemies of Rome. 4 What Livy mentions as the origin of this change of mind of the Luca nians, is a childish story, and nothing but one of the many imitations of the 5 V. p. 232. k3"], [222, "202 HISTORY OF ROME. now sued for a truce, which was granted for one year, on con dition of then- clothing the whole of the dictator's army, and giving the soldiers pay for one year. The Samnites are charged by the Eoman historians with having broken this truce ; but the accusation is wholly un founded.6 The Eoman army in Apulia was in the greatest danger, as one part of the Apuliaus had joined the Samnites, who, after the expiration of the truce, seem to have made an in cursion into the very heart of Latium, which created a panic at Eome. Some of the Latin towns joined the enemy, and Bome was on the brink of destruction. But the Tusculan commander abandoned the Samnites, and went over to the Eomans, for which act he was forthwith honoured with the consulship for B.C. 322'. His example was followed by other Latin towns, and Bome was thus delivered from tbi most imminent danger. A great battle is said to have been fought by the dictator, A. Cor nelius Cossus, in which the Samnites were defeated, though not without the greatest efforts of the Eomans. In the meantime Q. Fabius, one of the consuls of B.C. 322, carried on the war with the same success in Apulia : he conquered Luceria, and a large number of Samnite and Apulian villages; and the Samnites who had occupied Fregellae, were obliged to retreat. After these reverses the Samnites, being seized with a desire of peace, resolved to seek it at any cost. The Eoman senate demanded that they should recognise the sovereignty of the Eoman people. This they had not anticipated, and unhesitatingly refused to submit on such terms. The Eomans, on the other hand, vowed not to lay down their arms until the Samnites should accept any terms that might be dictated to them. It would seem that these negotiations were carried on during a truce of one year. When then results were brought to Samnium, rage and hatred gained the upper hand over all other feelings; but the cursing of the enemy was mingled with broken- 0 See Niebuhr, vol. iii. p. 196, &c. 7 Plin. Hist. Nat. viii. 43."], [223, "SECOND SAMNITE WAR. 203 heartedness. The Samnites, however, resolved to exert every power to maintain then independence, and forthwith laid siege to Luceria : they were on the point of compelling the place to surrender, when, in the spring of b.c 321, the consuls, T. Vetu rius and Sp. Postumius, assembled their troops hi the neighbour hood of Calatia, in Campania, from whence they intended to march through the mountain-passes into Samnium. Apulia was left to itself, as Bome wished to concentrate all her forces against Sanmium. The march through the dangerous passes had been arranged as carelessly and thoughtlessly as possible, and when the long column arrived in the narrow valley of Caudium, (farculae Caud'mae,) s the Eomans perceived that they were sur rounded by swarms of enemies. A fearful battle ensued, in which the Eomans were completely defeated and obliged to capitulate9. About half the Eoman troops were cut to pieces in the battle, and the survivors, being surrounded, were entirely in the hands of the Samnites. The noble-hearted C. Pontius, the general of the Samnites, proposed to the inclosed Eomans \u2014 he might have massacred them, or kept them as prisoners, and marched against Eome \u2014 the following terms of peace : \u2014 That the ancient equal affiance between Bome and Samnium should be restored; that all places which belonged to the Samnites before the war should be given up to them ; and that the Eomans should withdraw the colonies which had been established hi them. The terms were accepted ; and the consuls swore to the peace in the name of the republic : 600 equites were given to the Samnites as hostages, and the Eomans obtained a free departure ; but they had to pass under the yoke, which was, in Italy, the ordinary mode of dis gracing a defeated army. When the remnants of the army, full of shame, had returned through Campania to Eome, all business, private as well as public, was suspended, and all the population 8 The modern village of Forchia di Arpaia, not far from Benevento. 9 Livy's account (ix. 5) is disfigured, as he endeavours to conceal the great- ness of the loss of the Romans ; but the genuine account is preserved in Appian, and traces of it occur in many other writers."], [224, "204 HISTORY OF ROME. put on mourning. The soldiers went away in secret to their homes; and the consuls, after having appointed a dictator for the purpose of presiding at the assembly, were regarded as disho noured men, and not allowed to discharge any of the functions of then office. It was evident that the carelessness of the consuls had been the cause of the disaster; but as, according to Polybius, Bome was always most formidable after a great misfortune, the senate resolved to sacrifice the 600 hostages, or even more, rather than ratify the peace of Caudium : it was accordingly decreed, that all who had sworn to the peace should be delivered up to the Samnites as persons who had deceived them. This breach of faith towards the Samnites is a disgrace to the Boman name, and wholly unworthy of the people who had consecrated a temple of Faith on the Capitol. The consuls and their companions in mis fortune were led before C. Pontius, who, as well as the Samnite people, refused to receive them, and the 600 hostages were either given back or ransomed. Luceria had been taken by the Samnites either during the affair at Caudium, or soon after; but in B.C. 320 and the fol lowing year, the consul, L. Papirius Cursor, gained advantages over the Samnites, as is attested by his triumph. He is said to have recovered Luceria, where 7000 Samnites capitulated, toge ther with the 600 hostages who were kept there in custody, and where likewise the standards and arms which had been lost at Caudium were recovered. But it is more than probable that this account is a mere invention of Eoman vanity, to show that the defeat of Caudium did not long remain unavenged. Satricum, which was occupied by a Samnite garrison, was treacherously delivered up into the hands of the Eomans, and appears to have been destroyed soon after. The years B.C. 318 and 317 passed away under a truce, during which, however, the Eomans extended their sway in Apulia : the towns of Teanum and Canusium sub mitted to them and gave hostages. In the two following years the war was conducted by the dictators, L. Aemihus and Q."], [225, "SECOND SAMNITE WAR. 205 Fabius Maximus ; and the attack which the former made upon Saticula, in the neighbourhood of Capua, was to the Samnites the signal for re-commencing the war. They took the towns of Pistica and Sora, and tried to relieve Saticula ; but they were defeated by the Eomans in a bloody battle, and Saticula surren dered. The Eomans now ravaged the enemy's country, and entered Apulia, which henceforth became the scene of the war. The Samnites now determined to make a desperate effort to bring the war to a close. The hostile armies met at Lautuke : the Eomans were commanded by the dictator, Q. Fabius, the consular army being probably still engaged at Luceria. Fabius was defeated, and his army took to flight. This defeat induced a number of towns subject to Bome to revolt : but the particu lars of these occurrences are unknown, as Livy here again passes over a series of reverses, the overcoming of which would have spread more lustre around the Boman name, than this petty and vain concealment. We are oidy told that C. Fabius came to the assistance of the dictator with the civic legions, and that both united gained a great victory10. Whether it was as brilliant as is described, may be left undecided; since, at any rate, as the battle of Lautuke had not broken down the Eomans, the Samnites appear to have lost ah hope of ever conquering then enemy in battle; and this feehng may have greatly contributed towards determining the course of events, for henceforth fortune seems to have withdrawn its favour from the Samnites, whose strength gradually sank and decayed under the sufferings of the war. From the indefinite accounts we have, it would appear that they were defeated, in B.C. 314, in several engagements. Capua revolted against Bome ; but the insurrection was soon quelled by an armed force. The Ausonians also betrayed hostile feelings towards Bome; but by the treachery of some noble Ausonians, Boman soldiers in disguise were enabled to enter the towns of Minturnae, Vescia, and Ausona, and these opened the 10 Liv. ix. 22, &c."], [226, "206 HISTORY OF ROME. gates to others. The inhabitants were thus overpowered, many were massacred, and the survivors were sold as slaves. This frightful example of cruelty showed the subjects of Bome what they had to expect if they did not remain faithful. In the same year the consuls are said to have gained a great victory near Cau dium, and to have put the Samnites to flight. The year b.c. 313 is not marked by any battle ; but the Eomans made lasting conquests, which had a decided influence upon the course of events. The citadel of FregeUae, the only part of that town which was not destroyed, was now in the hands of the Samnites ; but it was taken by the Eomans : the Volscian town of Atina and Calatia, in Campania, were likewise conquered. Nola, a wealthy and populous city, surrendered to the Eomans. Apulia was protected by the Eomans, and remained faithful; and Campania was secured against the Samnites by the establishment of colonies at Suessa Aurunca, Saticula, and in the Pontian islands. In b.c. 312 the consid, Valerius, gained victories over the Samnites, reconquered Sora, and led in chains to Bome 225 of its inhabitants, who were put to death. The success of the Eomans was now so great, that if they had been able to direct then undivided forces against the Samnites, the latter would in a short time have been compelled to submit, and to accept any terms which the Eomans might dictate ; but the Etruscans, who had long been threatening Bome, obliged her to keep a part of her forces in readiness, to act against them. When, in B.c. 311, the war with Etruria broke out, Bome still continued to act on the offensive against Samnium. As she wished to be no longer defenceless at sea, decemvirs were appointed to restore and equip the small fleet which she then possessed. We shall defer giving an account of the Etruscan war, until we come to the end of that against the Samnites. The town of Cluvia had been taken by the latter, who put the Eoman garrison to the sword ; but it was re-conquered by the consul C. Junius, who then proceeded against Bovianum, a very wealthy town, which likewise fell into the hands of the Eomans. This conquest,"], [227, "SECOND SAMNITE WAR. 207 however, in the midst of the enemy's country, was not lasting. In the north of Samnium the Eomans were surprised by an army of Etruscans, and were nearly destroyed ; but the veterans, who had been trained in a long war, soon rallied, and made a desperate attack upon the enemy : they gained a complete victory, and large herds of cattle fell into then hands as booty. In Apulia, too, the Boman arms were successful ; but that country was again attacked by the Samnites in B.c. 310, while the Eomans were engaged against the united forces of Etruria. C. Marcius, the consul, afterward took Affifae, and many other places ; though soon after, the Samnites gained a great victory over him, and so completely cut him off from Eome, that not even a messenger could carry the tidings of his defeat to the city. In these perilous circumstances, L. Papirius Cursor was appointed dicta tor, and with a reserve army hastened to the assistance of the distressed legions in Samnium : for a time he merely observed the movements of the enemy ; but in the battle which at length ensued, the Samnites were beaten, and obliged to abandon then camp to the victors. The dictator's triumph was magnificent, on account of the splendid arms and shields he had taken from the enemy. In B.C. 308, Q. Fabius Maximus conducted the war against Samnium, and conquered the important town of Nuceria. He had also to fight against the Marsians and Pelignians, who declared for the Samnites. The TJmbrians now also declared war against Bome ; but Fabius speedily reduced them to sub mission, and was thus enabled to continue his operations against her other enemies. As the Hernicans and the Aequians at this time began to show a hostile feeling towards Eome, the Samnites conceived fresh hopes ; but the reduction of Etruria, with which the Samnites had long wished to form an affiance against the common enemy, was near at hand, and Bome's power was irre sistible. In B.C. 307, Fabius, as pro-consul, took Affifae, and granted to the Samnites a free departure, but sold their allies as skves ; and some Hernicans, who were found in the place, were assigned to custody among the Eoman allies, as persons guilty of"], [228, "208 HISTORY OF ROME. high treason. After Fabius had withdrawn, the Samnites appeared with fresh strength and a numerous army ; and Calatia and Sora, with their Boman garrisons, fell into then hands. They also conquered Arpinum and Cesennia. In the same year the consid L. Volumnius is said to have been victorious in Apulia. When the senate instituted an investigation into the case of the Hernicans found at Affifae, nearly all the Hernican towns declared war against Eome; and in B.C. 306, C. Marcius was sent against them, while the other consul, P. Cornelius, took the field against the Samnites. When it was found that P. Cornelius was cut off from all communication with Bome, the alarm was so great, that all men capable of bearing arms were called up, and formed into four new legions. But Cornelius maintained him self in the heart of the enemy's country so successfully, that his colleague was enabled to bring the war against the Hernicans to a close, and then to join him. C. Marcius had had easy work with the Hernicans, for they were as quick in then despondence as they had been in declaring war against Bome : he drove them from their strong positions, and compelled them to purchase a truce for thirty days. Soon after Cornelius was joined by his colleague, the Samnites were put to flight in all directions, and 30,000 of them are said to have been slain. The news of the sudden despair of the Hernicans had induced the Samnites to order a fresh levy to be made throughout the country ; but the reinforcements did not arrive till after the battle, when it was too late. The Eomans then ventured upon another attack, and routed the enemy without much exertion. The Samnites, having now lost all hopes of success, sued for a truce, which was granted them on condition of their furnish ing the whole Eoman army with a supply of corn for three months, and with one year's pay and clothing. They had hoped to obtain a tolerable peace, but in vain ; probably because that even now they would not make up then- minds to submit to the humihating demand of Eome to recognise her sovereignty. When hostilities were re-commenced, the Eomans ravaged Samnium in"], [229, "WARS WITH THE HERNICANS AND AEQUIANS. 209 a fearful manner, in order to compel the people to seek peace on any terms ; but when a great part of Samnium was reduced to a wilderness, the Samnites took revenge by an inroad into Cam pania, laying waste also the Stelktian and Falernian districts. The consuls of the year B.C. 305 are said to have driven them out of Campania, and afterwards to have defeated them in a great battle near Bovianum, which was taken by storm. Sora, Arpinum, and Cesennia, also were re-conquered by the Eomans. The Samnites were now completely crushed. A truce was con cluded for the purpose of carrying on negotiations for peace, though the Eoman army under P. Sulpicius, in B.C. 304, remained in Samnium. In this peace the Samnites acknowledged the majesty of Eome11, and were obliged to give up then- supre macy of Lucania, as well as then- affiance with the Marsians, Pe lignians, Marrucinians, and Frentanians. Eome now obtained the right to interfere in all the external relations of her conquered enemy. This peace must have been intolerable to the Samnites ; but they were so much weakened and reduced, that rest and peace were the only means from which they could hope recovery. Bome, too, needed relaxation, after a war which had lasted for about twenty years ; and the settlement of her internal disorders required peace. The fate of the Hernicans, after their subjugation in B.C. 306, was, on the whole, the same as that of the Latin towns after the reduction of Latium. Three Hernican towns, which had not joined in the revolt, retained then own laws and mutual connu bium and commercium. During the Samnite war, numbers of Aequians had served as mercenaries in the armies of the Samnites ; and after the reduc tion of the Hernicans, in B.C. 304, the whole nation of the Aequians openly took up arms for the Samnites. Two consular armies marched against them ; but the Aequians dispersed, de spairing of the event of a battle, and the contingent of each town 11 Livy, ix. 45, says that the ancient hut this is an absurdity. See Dionys. alliance with Samnium was restored, Excerpt. deLegat. p. 2331. ed.Reiske."], [230, "210 HISTORY OF ROME. returned home to defend its own walls. The Aequian towns, forty-one in number, were now attacked and conquered one after another in fifty days, and most of them were destroyed. This speedy conquest induced the Marsians, Marrucinians, Pelig nians, and Frentanians, to conclude a treaty with Bome. The country of the Aequians was made secure by several strong colonies, who afterwards drove the people to hopeless revolts. During those struggles the Aequians are said to have been nearly annihilated ; but this cannot have been the case, since the Tribus Aniensis and Terentina, which were formed in B.C. 299, con sisted of Aequians. About the same time Bome concluded a peace with Tarentum, in which it was stipulated, that no Boman ship should sail beyond the Lacinian promontory12. The long peace which Etruria observed towards Bome, during the early part of the second Samnite war, must undoubtedly be ascribed to its internal weakness, and to its fear of the Gauls. This fortunate circumstance had enabled Bome for a time to direct her whole forces against the south and east, and to keep up a bulwark between herself and the Gauls. But as the Gauls, in the course of time, lost their warlike character in the mild climate of Italy, and as they were not averse to a peace which secured to them the undisturbed enjoyment of a rich and fertile country, the Etruscans, after the defeat of the Eomans near Lautuke in B.C. 315, seem to have conceived the plan of reco vering their old dominions as far as the banks of the Tiber. They began the war, however, much too late, although the Sam nites had undoubtedly urged them on long before. All the united forces of the Etruscans advanced towards Sutrium in B.c. 311 ; but the army of the consul, Q. Aemilius, relieved the fortress ; and some time after the hostile armies had met, a battle was begun. Both parties fought with equal perseverance : the Eomans were inferior in numbers, but the battle ended without either of the belligerents being in a condition to claim the vic- 12 Appian, 8amm.it. p. 56, ed. Schweigh."], [231, "ETRUSCAN WAR. 211 tory. In the year following, the consul, Q. Fabius, commanded the Eoman army, and went to relieve Sutrium, which was again besieged by the Etruscans. The latter hastened to attack him ; but he had taken so favourable a position upon an eminence, that when the enemy had ascended half way, the Eomans hurled them down, and cut off then retreat to the camp, which, together with its rich booty, became the prey of the Eomans, who are said to have slain or taken prisoners many thousand Etruscans. Sutrium was now relieved, and Q. Fabius penetrated further into Etruria. A fresh Etruscan army, reinforced by Umbrians, assembled in the neighbourhood of Perusia, where Fabius again gained a complete victory : the three principal towns, Perusia, Cortona, and Arretium, begged for peace, and a truce for 30 years was granted to them. After this glorious campaign, in which the Etruscans had made the most desperate efforts, and in which they lost an enor mous number of men, the great Fabius celebrated a most bril liant triumph. In B.C. 308 the Etruscans do not appear to have sent an army into the field, but Tarquinii obtained a truce for 40 years13 ; and after the taking of some other places by the Eomans, the other Etruscans also concluded a truce for one year. Soon after this, the Umbrians threatened Eome with a war; and Q,. Fabius, who was stationed in Samnium, was ordered to lead his troops against them. But they submitted to him without a battle, and with unexampled cowardice. After the expiration of the truce with the Etruscans, we hear nothing of any fresh hostilities between them and Eome, for a period of six years ; the truce, therefore, must have been prolonged, or renewed every year. In the interval between the second and third Samnite wars, when Bome was not engaged against any other enemies, a swarm of Gauls, who had crossed the Alps, were induced by their countrymen who had already settled in Italy, to proceed 13 Diodor. xx. 44."], [232, "212 HISTORY OF ROME. into Etruria ; and the Etruscans prevailed upon them, in B.C. 299, to march into the Eoman territory. The Eomans were still afraid of meeting the Gauls in the open field ; they there fore allowed then territory to be laid waste ; and after a short stay, the Gauls, laden with booty, returned across the Apen nines.14 The Eomans took vengeance for the conduct of the Etruscans in this affair, by ravaging the open country and vil lages of Etruria. The third Samnite war broke out in B.C. 298. The Samnites had only been waiting for a favourable opportunity of throwing off the unbearable yoke of Eome : for the same reason, the Etruscans abstained from war until Eome should be engaged with other enemies. The Samnites had supported the Umbrian town of Nequinum in the war of the Umbrians against Bome ; and as the Boman senate, probably from fear of the Gauls, did not take immediate vengeance for this breach of peace, the Sam nites became emboldened to venture upon further undertakings, and tried to recover the sovereignty of Lucania. That country was accordingly invaded by the Samnites, who at the same time endeavoured to gain over other nations by treaties ; but in vain : the Picentians instead of joining the Samnites, accepted a treaty which was offered to them by the Eomans. After the Samnites had conquered the Lucanians in several battles, the Lucanian nobles placed themselves under the protection of Bome, and promised to obey her commands. A Boman embassy was then sent to Samnium to demand the evacuation of Lucania. This irritated the Samnites so much that they immediately re solved upon war, and bade the Eoman envoys quit the country. The consul, Cn. Fulvius, led an army to the assistance of the Lucanians ; and in a great battle, near Bovianum, he gained a victory over the Samnites, who were far superior to him in numbers, and conquered the towns of Bovianum and Aufidena. In the same year in which Cn. Fulvius thus distinguished 14 Polyb. ii. 19."], [233, "213 THIRD SAMNITE WAR. himself in Lucania, his colleague L. Cornelius Scipio fought a hard battle near Volaterrae, in which the Etruscan camp and all its stores were taken. The conquerors afterwards confined them selves to ravaging the open country, and destroying a number of villages and country towns. In B.C. 297 there seems to have been a truce with Etruria, and Bome was enabled to direct all her forces against the Samnites. The two consuls, Q. Fabius, the ablest general of the time, and his friend, P. Decius Mus, accordingly led their armies into Samnium ; the former into the country of the Pentrians, and the latter towards Maleventum. Q. Fabius was met by the whole army of the enemy, and a battle ensued, in which neither party gained any decisive ad vantages, until the Samnites, being deceived by the consul's reserve, which they took to be the army of Decius, failed in corn-age, and were defeated with the loss of upwards of 4700 of their men. Decius, who had in the meantime found the revolted Apulians encamped near Maleventum, gained an easy victory over them ; and both consuls now traversed Samnium for five unhappy months, during which the country was ravaged in the most fearful manner. In the year following the two consuls had their command prolonged ; they remained in the enemy's country making several conquests, and Fabius succeeded in gaining over the whole of Lucania to the interests of Eome. App. Claudius, on the other hand, conducted the war in Etruria ; for it was well known at Eome that the Samnites had formed the plan of send ing an army to that country. This army now actually marched out, under the command of Geffius Egnatius. The Etruscans further strengthened themselves by forming an affiance with the Umbrians, and by engaging Gallic mercenaries in then service. App. Claudius was scarcely able to resist the ever-increasing forces of the enemy, and his situation was highly alarming, until he was joined by his colleague L. Volumnius. The imited Eomans now offered battle, which turned out so favourably to Eome, that Volumnius was enabled to return to Samnium, leav ing only a small army in Etruria to act on the defensive."], [234, "214 HISTORY OF ROME. In the absence of L. Volumnius, the Samnites had invaded Campania : many of the inhabitants of the open country were carried away into slavery, and an immense quantity of booty was taken. Volumnius, who hastily returned from Etruria, found the Samnites on the Vulturnus, and immediately attacked them. The Eomans stormed their camp, and pressed upon them on all sides. The defeat of the Samnites, who had been taken by surprise, was very severe. The news of this victory, which saved Bome from the fear of a revolt of her subjects, was re- ceived with joy and gratitude. At the same time the Gauls were expected, and, under these threatening circumstances, O. Fabius and P. Decius were again raised to the consulship for b.c 295. Various prodigies frightened the Eomans, and two days were devoted to prayers and sacrifices to propitiate the gods. The preparations which Bome made surpassed everything she had done before. Volumnius was still stationed against the Sam- nites, while all the other forces were directed against the Etrus- cans, Gauls, Umbrians, and the Samnites under Geffius Egnatius. Fabius, on entering Etruria, joined the army of App. Claudius, and restored among the latter a better military discipline, whereby the soldiers themselves were animated with fresh courage and confidence. When all the Boman troops were ready, they were led to join those who, under L. Scipio, had maintained then position in the face of the enemy. He had been cut off from all communication with Eome ; and one legion, which had been stationed near Camerinum, had been completely annihilated, without the consuls being aware of it, until the Gauls advanced, exhibiting the heads of the slain on then- lances. Notwithstanding, the consuls succeeded in joining Scipio. What saved Eome, was the want of unity among her enemies, each of whom had his camp apart. At length a great and general battle was fought near Sentinum, in Umbria, whither the Eomans had advanced with great caution. The battle was fought on a hot summer's day, and the Gallic horsemen and war-chariots made great havoc among the wavering legions : the flight became"], [235, "THIRD SAMNITE WAR. 215 general, and a complete defeat of the Eomans seemed unavoid able, when Decius, imitating the example of his father in the battle of Mount Vesuvius, ordered himself and the enemy to be devoted by the pontiff M. Livius to the gods of Death. He then rushed among the enemies and fell, and from that moment the fortune of the day turned. The Gauls, being pressed together in one thick mass, were cut down without moving from the spot, and the Samnites fled to then camp. The Eomans pursued the fugitives with great vigour and vehemence, and the battle was changed into a revengeful massacre. Geffius Egnatius fell, and the Samnite camp was taken : 25,000 Gauls and Samnites are said to have been slain, and 8000 to have been made prisoners ; but the Eomans too had lost 8200 men, and were unable to follow up their victory. Five thousand Samnites effected their retreat through a hostile country, and reached their homes, after the loss of 1000 in the country of the Pelignians. Q,. Fabius led back his army across the Apennines into Etru ria, where Cn. Fulvius had ravaged the territories of Perusia and Clusium, and beaten the Etruscans who attempted to pro tect those towns. Q. Fabius now defeated them a second time, near Perusia, in a bloody battle, and took many prisoners : on his return to Bome he celebrated a magnificent triumph over the Gauls, Samnites, Umbrians, and Etruscans. The Samnites, who had not joined in the northern coalition, had, in the meantime, crossed the Liris towards Formiae, and invaded the valley of the Vulturnus ; and when Volumnius and App. Claudius, after the battle of Sentinum, hastened against them, the country was in such a state that it scarcely afforded the necessary means of sub sistence for the Samnites: a battle was then fought, in which an enormous number of Samnites are said to have fallen. But that then loss in this battle cannot have been very great, is evident from the fact, that in the very next year they were able to send three armies into the field, one of which was destined to enter Etruria. The consuls of the year B.C. 294, L. Postumius and M. Atffius"], [236, "216 HISTORY OF ROME. Eegulus, marched, according to some accounts, into Samnium, and fought a battle near Luceria, in which many were slain on both sides ; and afterwards one or both of the consular armies marched into Etruria.15 Both consuls gained triumphs over the Samnites and Etruscans, and many of the principal Etruscan towns concluded separate truces with Bome for 40 years. In the year following, the war against Samnium was conducted with brilliant success by L. Papirius and Sp. Carvilius. The Sam nites now combined the terrors of religion with the compulsory power of their government, for the purpose of raising all the forces that then- country contained : they were resolved to make a last and desperate effort against then enemy, and having enlisted all the men capable of bearing arms, and bound them by the most solemn and fearful oaths, they invaded Campania. But the Eomans, who marched into the unprotected Samnium, compeDed the Samnites to return.16 L. Papirius encamped opposite the Samnites, near Aquilonia, Sp. Carvilius blockaded Commium, and both had agreed to make then- attack on the same day. When the day came a Samnite detachment was sent off, and the Eomans began the battle against the reduced army : it was less obstinate than might have been anticipated ; the Samnites, be lieving themselves overwhelmed, fled to then camp, without being able to maintain it, and the scattered troops assembled again at Bovianum. L. Scipio, by a piece of great boldness, made himself master of Aquilonia, and Commium was taken by storm. The towns were given up to the soldiers for plunder, and then set on fire. The greatness of this victory is evident from its results, though the number of men whom the Samnites are said to have lost is quite incredible.17 The Samnites indeed contmued to fight against the two consuls, but could not unite then- forces, and con- 15 Livy mentions two other accounts 16 Zonaras, viii. ], whose account of this campaign, but both seem to be seems more credible than that of Livy, less entitled to credit than the one x. 38, &c. given in our text. l7 Liv. x. 42."], [237, "THIRD SAMNITE WAR. 217 sequently could not gain any decisive advantage. The Fahscans had, in the meantime, broken the peace with Eome, in conse quence of which Sp. Carvilius was obliged to lead his army into Etruria : his colleague remained in Samnium till the winter, when both returned to Bome in triumph. The booty which was carried to Bome was very great ; and Carvilius had the brass of the Samnite armour worked into a statue of Jupiter on the Capitol, which was of so gigantic a size, that it was visible from the temple of the Alban mount. No sooner had the Boman armies withdrawn from Samnium than the Samnites again invaded Campania ; and Papirius after his triumph was obliged to hasten with his army into the Falernian district. But soon after, his successor, Q. Fabius Gurges, under took the command of the army. The Samnites were led by then great and noble general, C. Pontius, who now, an old man, still possessed the same energy and skill as in the days of his youth. Q. Fabius attacked a detachment of the enemy, believing it to be then whole army endeavouring to retreat, but he suffered a disgraceful defeat, and his army would have been annihilated had the Samnites acted less cautiously. This defeat excited at Eome the greatest indignation against Fabius : it was doubly felt, because the city had been suffering under an epidemic disease for the last two years, and a war with Etruria was expected every moment to break out. The senate decreed that the tribunes should propose to the people to deprive Fabius of his power as a general. He was accordingly summoned before the people ; but the prayers and entreaties of his aged father, Q. Fabius Maximus, who had so often led the Eomans to victory, procured the people's pardon for him, and the aged Fabius himself entered the army as legate of his son. Soon after this a battle was fought, which decided the contest between Samnium and Eome. The Samnites under C. Pontius fought with despair, for they well knew that this effort was the last, and they would have conquered had not the Eomans been commanded by the aged but invincible Fabius. The place of the battle is unknown, but L"], [238, "218 HISTORY OF ROME. it is said that the Pentrians, who formed one of the four Samnite cantons, fought in it alone against the Eomans. The latter were on the point of being overpowered, when Q. Fabius came up with the reserve to his son's assistance, and decided the day. Twenty thousand Samnites are said to have been slain, and 4000 to have been made prisoners, among whom was the brave C. Pontius. The war was in reality terminated, although the submission of Samnium was yet delayed for nearly two years. After this victory, the command of Q. Fabius Gurges was prolonged for the year b.c. 291, in order that he might as pro consul continue the operations against the Pentrians, while a consular army under L. Postumius, a haughty and overbearing man, was to bring the war with Samnium to a close. Postumius demanded of Fabius to give up his army, but the latter led his men back in order to avoid coming into collision with a person who acted like a tyrant or a madman. In the triumph of Fabius, in B.C. 291, C. Pontius was led in chains, and was afterwards be headed: this execution of a great general, who twenty-seven years before, after the peace of Caudium, had taken the greatest care of the sick and wounded Eomans, and had magnanimously pro vided the defeated army with all the necessary supplies for their return to Bome, is the foulest and blackest deed ever committed by the Eomans, and an eternal disgrace to their name. L. Postumius soon reduced Cominium, which Fabius had been besieging ; and among other towns he conquered Venusia in Apulia, where a colony of 20,000 men was established : Tarentum was thus completely separated from Samnium and Lucania. The Samnites, after their great defeat, did not venture upon another battle in the field, and hence we hear only of con quests of separate towns; though according to some authorities,18 the consuls P. Cornelius Eufinus and M'. Curius Dentatus, in b.c 290, defeated the Samnites in dreadful battles. Hereupon the Samnites are said to have sued for peace ; and Livy,19 as on a former occasion, absurdly states that the ancient affiance with 53 Eutrop.,ii. 5. rj Epitome, 11."], [239, "219 APP. CLAUDIUS, THE BLIND. Samnium was renewed ; but the peace undoubtedly determined still more strictly than before the dependence of Samnium. In the same year the Sabines, who had for a long time been neutral in the wars of Bome, revolted, but were conquered by Postumius. Immense tracts of land were acquired for the Boman people, and a very large number of Sabines were made prisoners. The other Sabines received the Caerite franchise. As Bome had now conquered her enemies, and was ruling far and wide over Central Italy, the peace she enjoyed affords us an opportunity of casting a glance at the condition of the people and the internal affairs of Eome. On the whole it may be said, that, owing to the vast military undertakings in which the Eomans were constantly engaged, the internal peace and harmony of the republic were not much dis turbed. Now and then the patricians still endeavoured by in trigues to recover the ascendancy over the plebs, and party spirit still burst out occasionally ; but it is evident that the power of the patricians was broken, and had, comparatively speaking, be come harmless. One of the most eventful years in the internal history of Bome was that of the censorship of App. Claudius the Blind, B.C. 312. He seems to have had many enemies in the senate, and in revenge he excluded them from the list of sena tors, admitting the sons of freedmen in their stead. He further divided all the low people among all the tribes.20 But his list of senators was set aside in the year following by the tribunes, who were unanimous in favour of the former senate. His col league C. Blautius, a man of weak character, who had allowed himself to be overruled by Appius, laid down his office in order to screen his own honour ; and Appius remained sole censor, in defiance of law and custom, according to which he too ought to have kid down his office. This conduct of App. Claudius has commonly been censured as insolence, and as an insult offered to 20 But in b.c. 304, the censor, Q. the four city tribes. Liv. ix. 46 ; Val. Fabius Maximus, removed the whole Max., II. 2, 9 ; Aurel. Viet., Be Vir. class of low people from the country Illustr. 34. tribes, and threw them together into L2"], [240, "220 HISTORY OF ROME. the senate, or as a means by which he intended to create a strong party for himself; but if we remember that the war. against the Samnites had been carried on for a series of years, during which the Eomans had sustained some very severe losses, it is not impossible that the object of Appius was in reality not so bad as it may appear at first sight, and that he intended to in crease the number of men required for the armies, since freedmen, as such, were not allowed to serve in the legions. But much as Appius favoured the common people, he still hated the plebeians ; for the latter counted among them many wealthy and illustrious families, who thought themselves equal to the patrician nobility ; and a rivalry of this kind was sm-e to make an obstinate patrician like Appius hate them most cordially. But the name of Appius Claudius is immortalised by the great and useful works which he designed and completed. In order to facilitate the commimica tion with the subject countries in the south, and to enable Bome to maintain her possession of them,he made the road from Eome to Capua, which was called after him the Appian road (via Appia), and is justly called \" the queen of roads.\"21 It was constructed of large polygon blocks, so accurately fitted together, that the spaces between the stones could scarcely be perceived. Con siderable portions of it exist to this day in perfect preservation, and justify the high admiration with which the ancients speak of it. Another great work was the aqueduct {aqua Appia), the oldest at Bome, which supplied a want that had long been felt. It conducted the water from wells on the left of the Praenestine road, a distance of about eight miles, to the city. With the ex ception of a short distance near the Porta Capena, the aqueduct ran under ground, in order that the supply of water might not be out off by an enemy in time of war. The censorship of Appius is further remarkable for a legend which accounts for his blind ness. The Potitian and Pinarian gentes had hitherto performed the sacred rites connected with the worship of Hercules : Appius 21 Statius, Silv. ii. 2, 12. At a later time it was continued from Capua to Brundusium."], [241, "CN. FLAVIUS. 221 is said to have induced them to instruct public slaves in these ceremonies ; in consequence of which the whole Potitia gens, which then contained twelve families became extinct in a very short time, and Appius himself had to pay for Iris sin with the loss of his sight. \u2022 In the censorship of App. Claudius, Cn. Flavius, a scribe, and son of a freedman, had been raised to the curule aedileship, by the influence of that class of people whom Appius had distributed among all the tribes. Cn. Flavius, however, had been obliged, previous to his election, to renounce his profession, which at Eome was thought dishonourable to a citizen. Until that time, the pontiffs alone had been in possession of the knowledge of the days on which assemblies of the people could be held, and justice administered ; that is, which days were fasti and which nefasti, either entirely or in part ; and every one had been obliged to apply to the pontiffs for information upon these matters, as often as he was in want of it. To avoid such unnecessary trouble, and at the same time check the arbitrary power of the pontiffs, who often abused it for party purposes, Cn. Flavius drew up a calendar, in which all dies fasti and nefasti were marked, and this calendar he exhibited in the forum on a tablet covered with gypsum. AU the people had reason to be grateful for this great conve- nience. Another benefit he conferred upon the people, was that he made a collection of the formulae of legal actions (legis actiones), which hitherto had been handed down by tradition, and of which the patricians had always endeavoured to preserve a knowledge to themselves exclusively. In this work he undoubtedly enume rated all the different actions of every kind. Flavius is said to have made this collection on the advice of App. Claudius,22 while others went so far as to ascribe the work to Appius himself. These services which Flavius rendered to the people made him extremely popular, and the aedileship was the reward he received for it: \u2014 the greatest triumph which the class to which he belonged could have desired. The nobility evinced the deepest grief at 22 Plin. Hut. Nat. xxxiii. 6."], [242, "222 HISTORY OF ROME. seeing the sons of those, who had once been the enemies of the republic, raised to such honours. The year of the censorship of O. Fabius and P. Decius, B.C. 304, when the low people whom Appius had distributed among all the tribes were thrown into the four city tribes, is considered by some 23 to form an epoch in the history of the Eoman consti tution. The comitia of the centuries had gradually lost much of their importance, in proportion as that of the assembhes of the tribes increased ; at length a combination of the centuries and tribes was devised to meet the altered exigencies of the time, the centuries being engrafted on the tribes ; each of the latter voted as two centuries, one of the seniors and the other of the juniors.24 But it is by no means certain that this arrangement was made in the year B.c. 304 ; on the contrary, there is evidence that it existed as early as B.C. 396, when, in speaking of the election of the consular tribunes, who were chosen by the centuries, Livy25 mentions the praerogativa, that is, the tribe chosen by lot to give its vote first. The assembly, however, in which the centuries were thus combined with the tribes, was quite distinct from the comitia of the tribes, which continued to be held as before. The last great point, which completed the equality of the ple beians with the patricians, was gained by the Ogulnkn law. Hitherto the colleges of augurs and pontiffs had consisted of four priests each, all of whom were patricians : the tribunes Q,. and Cn. Ogulnius in b.c. 300 carried a law, by which the number of augurs was increased to nine, and that of the pontiffs to eight (the chief pontiff, who is not included in this number, beino- the ninth), and which ordained that four of the pontiffs and five of the augurs should always be plebeians. This law was of great importance, inasmuch as it abolished the exclusive right of the patricians to interpret the auspices, and then superintendence of all religious and ecclesiastical matters.26 23 For example, by Niebuhr, vol. iii., p. 320, &c. 24 Cic, Philip.

Ten ambassadors accordingly were sent to Epidaurus, and the god, in the form of a gigantic serpent, went of his own accord to the Boman ship, and was conveyed to Bome, where he disap peared in the island of the Tiber, on which a temple was erected to him. We have already remarked that attempts still continued to be made occasionally, by haughty and obstinate patricians, such as App. Claudius and Sp. Postumius, to upset the Licinian law re specting the division of the consulship ; but infringements of the agrarian law of Licinius must have been of far more frequent occurrence, as we may infer from the fact, that the haughty Sp. Postumius employed 2000 men on his possession of the public land. Several instances also are recorded, in which the trans gressors were punished with heavy fines. After the reduction of Latium, we hear no more of assignments of land : the establish ment of numerous colonies, from which poor citizens derived benefit, if they joined the settlers, answered the same purpose. Assignments are again spoken of after the conquest of the country of the Sabines, in B.C. 290, when each citizen received a lot of seven jugera ; for M'. Curius refused to give more to the dis contented people, although there still remained a great quantity of public land which was not distributed : he himself took a farm, in the Sabine district, which was not larger than that of any other citizen, and on which he was afterwards found roasting his turnips, when the Samnite ambassadors came to offer him then gold. The assignments in the Sabine country were made at a time when the people were in urgent want of some improvement in their domestic affairs, but it came in reality too late. The long- continued wars, which Bome had been carrying on, had ex hausted the very marrow of the nation, and destroyed its pros-"], [244, "224 HISTORY OF ROME. perity : many thousands, whose lands had been laid waste, and who had been obliged to ransom then- friends from slavery, had fallen into extreme poverty ; and many families must have been bereaved of their fathers and supporters, or at least were deprived of then support during the incessant campaigns : the calamities arising from war were completed by scarcity and epidemics. This state of things produced disorders, to relieve which some tribunes even thought it necessary to propose a general cancel ling of debts. Matters indeed went so far, that the commonalty were induced to secede and encamp on the Janiculum, in B.C. s/.S87. At length Q,. Hortensius was appointed dictator, to put down the insurrection by conciliatory means. One of these means was the celebrated Hortensian law, which gave to the decrees of the plebs the power of a law binding on the whole nation.27 The point in which this law differed from the Pubhlian, is probably the fact, that Hortensius abolished the veto of the senate upon those legislative measures which had been passed by the plebeian assembly. The secession of the plebs, which gave rise to this law, is the last that occurs in Boman history. During the period we have just been speaking of, the Eomans must have made considerable progress in the fine arts. C. Fabius, surnamed Pictor, made a painting in the temple of Salus, pro bably representing one of the battles with the Samnites, which is praised for the great correctness of its drawing, and for the gracefulness of its colouring. The excellent bronze figure of the Capitohne she-wolf with the two babes, which still exists, is probably the same as the one mentioned by Livy, 2S which was dedicated by the aediles Cn. and Q. Ogulnius. This figure of the she-wolf, and the sarcophagus of Scipio Barbatus, which belongs to about the same time, give us a high idea of the character of the works of art which were produced in Eome at 27 Plin.

WARS WITH THE GAULS, ETRUSCANS, LUCANIANS, AND BRUTTIANS \u2014 THE FOURTH SAMNITE AND THE TARKNTINE WARS PYRRHUS SUBJUGATION OF ALL ITALY, AND THE RELATIONS OF THE ITALIANS TO ROME. Aftee the third Samnite war, Eome enjoyed a short interval of peace with her foreign neighbours ; though her internal tran quillity was disturbed by the last secession of the plebs in B.C. 287, which led to the laws of O. Hortensius. But a new enemy was rising in the south of Italy, who, although not yet venturing on open war with Bome, was watching for an opportunity, and contriving to stir up others against Bome, in order thereby to facilitate his own victory in the end. Things however turned out differently, and Bome went forth from the struggle the sove reign of Italy. In the tenth year after the battle of Sentinum, B.C. 285, the Gauls, incited by the Tarentines and the Volsinians1, entered Etruria, and laid siege to Arretium. The Eomans sent out an army to relieve the place ; but then legions were defeated, and the praetor, L. Caecilius, was slain. He was succeeded by M'. Curius, who sent ambassadors to the Gauls, for the purpose of negotiating a ransom for the prisoners ; but the barbarians, con trary to the laws of natiops, put the ambassadors to death. This outrage provoked the anger and indignation of the Eomans, who forthwith sent a fresh army into the country of the Senones, and this time they were victorious : the Senones were completely defeated ; the Eomans took possession of their country, destroyed ' Zonar.viii.2; comp.

They were joined by the few remnants of the Senones, and by the Etruscans, who seized that moment as a favourable opportunity for recovering their independence. This formidable army marched against Eome. The Eomans met the enemy near Lake Vadimo, and gained a decisive victory, for most of the Etruscans were cut to pieces, and few of the Boians escaped. The latter however did not yet despair, and having armed all who were capable of bearing arms, they returned to Etruria.3 The scene of the war was now transferred to the neighbourhood of Populonia, B.C. 282, and the Eomans would have been annihilated, had it not been for the watchfulness of the consul, Q.. Aemilius Papus, who fought alone against the enemy, while his colleague, C. Fabricius, was engaged against the revolted nations of southern Italy. Aemilius gained a victory, after which the Boians sued for peace, which was willingly granted to them by the Eomans, as their troops were wanted in other quarters. The submission of the Gauls was soon after followed by that of the Etruscans, though the towns of Volsinii and Vulci continued then hostilities for some years longer, and peace was not com pletely restored in Etruria till b.c 280, after Pyrrhus had con quered the Eomans near Heraclea. This circumstance induced Bome to grant to the Etruscans a peace on the most favourable terms. Henceforth Etruria remained faithful to Eome for nearly two centuries, during which its prosperity appears to have greatly increased. 2 Polyb. it 19; Appian, OaU. p. outbreak of the war, and that their 83, ed.

Meanwhile the Lucanians, who were still in a state of inde pendence, had been prevailed upon to make war against Thurii ; and as this town could not hope to be supported by any of the other Greek towns in southern Italy, it applied to Eome for pro tection. The Eomans were not slow in obeying the call, which afforded them an opportunity of extending then dominion. But it was not an easy matter to relieve Thmii ; and in addition to this difficulty, which arose from the situation of the place, the southern Italians, who again conceived a hope of destroying the power of Eome, formed a league, which is said to have been planned by Tarentum, and in which the Etruscans, Umbrians, and Gauls were expected to join. The Eomans, on hearing of the negotiations which were carried on among these nations, used all possible precautions to prevent their own allies from joining the enemy. But the Samnites, who hoped to recover then independ ence, entered into the coalition. In B.c. 282, when the Lucanians in conjunction with the Bruttians were besieging Thurii, the consul C. Fabricius under took, with an inferior army, the relief of the place ; but when he was on the point of fighting a pitched battle, his soldiers began to despair at seeing the far superior numbers of the enemy. Then courage, however, was roused by a supernatural occurrence ; for a youth of gigantic size was seen carrying a scaling ladder to the ramparts of the enemy's camp and mounting it. He was believed to be the god Mars, who had come to the assistance of his desponding Eomans. This occurrence discouraged the besiegers as much as it rejoiced the Eomans, who were now sure of victory ; and the result of the battle was the relief of Thurii, which evinced its gratitude to its deliverers by erecting a statue of C. Fabricius.4 Statilius, the commander of the enemy's forces, was taken prisoner, together with a great number of his troops, and a still greater number lay on the field of battle. Besides this great victory, Fabricius gained many others over the confederates and the Samnites ; he took many towns, and the booty he made 4 Pliny, Hist.

Thurii received a Boman garrison, but as soon as the Boman army had withdrawn from Lucania, the town was cut off from communication with Bome except by sea. In the treaty with Tarentum it had been stipulated that Bome should not send any armed vessels beyond the Laciuian promontory, but the necessity of assisting Thurii outweighed every other consideration, and ten ships, under the duumvir L. Valerius, appeared in that part of the sea. The Eomans so little heeded the treaty with Tarentum, that their squadron steered towards its harbour without any apprehension. But the people of Tarentum, who happened to be assembled in the theatre, which, as in all Greek towns, over looked the sea, were so enraged at the sight of the Boman ships, that the multitude rushed to their own galleys, and attacked the Boman squadron, which being unprepared for resist ance took to flight. Only five of the Eoman ships escaped ; four were sunk, and one was taken ; the captains and marines were murdered, and the rowers carried off as slaves. Hereupon the Tarentines immediately sent a force against Thurii, which, being now entirely deprived of the support of Eome, was obliged to throw its gates open to the enemy. The Eoman garrison was dismissed, but the most distinguished citizens were exiled, and the town was plundered.5 This happened in the year B.C. 282. The Eoman senate, desirous if possible to avoid a war in southern Italy so long as peace was not restored in Etruria, sent an embassy to Tarentum with as moderate demands as the dig nity of the republic would allow. The Tarentines were requested to restore the prisoners to freedom, to indemnify Thurii for the losses it had sustained, and to surrender the instigators of the crime. When the Eoman ambassadors were introduced into the 5 Appian, Samnit. p. 57, ed. Schweigh. ; comp. Strab. vi. p. 263."], [250, "230 HISTORY OF ROME. popular assembly, they were received with shouts of laughter and with insult, and were at length driven away without receiving any answer. Q,. Postumius, then spokesman, on leaving the assembly, was insulted in the grossest and most indecent manner by a person who soiled his garment. Postumius turned back and showed his garment to the people, and as then laughter continued, he said, \" Laugh on as long as you can, you will have time enough to cry.\" As the populace became infuriated by this threat, he added, \" And that you may become still more em-aged, I tell you that this garment will be washed in torrents of your blood.\" Hereupon the ambassadors returned to Eome, where the conduct of the Tarentines excited the greatest indignation ; but under the circumstances it was difficult to decide upon the mode of acting. Long deliberations took place in the senate, but in B.C. 281 the consul L. Aemilius Barbula marched with an army to Tarentum to repeat the terms of peace, having at the same time orders to prosecute the war with energy if the Taren tines should reject the proposed terms. By this time the Messapians had joined the Tarentines in the league against Bome. When the consid arrived on the frontier of the Tarentirie territory, he offered peace on the terms which had been proposed by the ambassadors ; but it was to no purpose ; and as he did not take immediate vengeance, the Tarentines fan cied that he despaired of the event of a battle, and that now the moment had come for crushing for ever the power which threatened to destroy the independence of the Italian nations. The expectation of a general coalition against Bome, however, was not realised, and the Tarentines themselves now could not avoid taking part in the war with an army which they had to hire. They turned their eyes to Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, the ablest general of the time ; and an embassy was accordingly sent to him. Pyrrhus was not one of the ordinary leaders of merce naries at that time : his object in accepting the proposal of the Tarentines probably was to found for himself a kingdom in Italy. However, before he arrived with his auxiliary force, the Taren-"], [251, "WAR WITH TARENTUM AND PYRRHUS. 231 tines were thoroughly beaten, and several of their fortified places fell into the hands of the Eomans. Soon after Milo, one of Pyrrhus's generals, arrived at Tarentum with 3000 Epirots, who occupied the citadel, and afterwards, in conjunction with the Tarentines, attacked the Boman army on its retreat from Lucania ; but though the Eomans were in a most dangerous position, nothing of any consequence was achieved by their enemies. When Pyrrhus crossed over to Italy in B.C. 281,6 he was thirty-seven years old. He had received an excellent education, and among the sovereigns of the time he was the only one that was really worthy of the kingly dignity. He possessed the art of winning the affections of all who approached him, and had not only the good luck of finding sincere friends, such as Cineas, but the wisdom to retain them and listen to their counsels. He was greater in battles than in the management of campaigns ; he had confidence in his genius and Iris art ; and his object always was to gain an advantage rather than to follow it up scrupulously or keep it when gained. He arrived in Italy with an insufficient army, consisting of 20,000 foot, 3000 horse, 20 elephants, and a number of slingers and bowmen. He expected, however, to be joined by a large army of the Italian confederates ; and it was further believed that the war with Etruria would divide the forces of Eome, and cause her subject towns to revolt. The Eomans sent eight legions into the field. L. Aemilius Barbuk carried on the war against the Samnites as pro-consul, while P. Laevinus, one of the consuls of the year B.C. 280, marched against Tarentum and Pyrrhus, and his colleague Tib. Corunca nius concluded the war in Etruria. What Bome had to dread, even more than the numbers of her enemies, was the great gene ralship of Pyrrhus, and his Macedonian tactics, which were as yet unknown to the Eomans. On his arrival at Tarentum Pyrrhus had assumed dictatorial power, which was absolutely 6 Polyb. ii. 19 ; Liv. Epit. xii.; viii. 6) places the landing of Pyrrhus Gellius, xvii. 21 ; Pliny (Hist. Nat. one year earlier."], [252, "232 HISTORY OF ROME. necessary to compel the luxurious and idle Tarentines to take an active part in the war : the popular assemblies were suspended, the theatres closed, and all persons capable of bearing arms were trained in mffitary exercises. The Eoman consul P. Laevinus led his army into Lucania, re- solving not to wait for an attack of the king and his allies. He was at first successful, and prevented the Lucanians from uniting then forces with those of the king ; nay, he felt strong enough to send the Campanian legion, under Decius Jubeffius, to Ehe- gium, the oidy Greek town in Italy that espoused the cause of Bome. Pyrrhus, who wished to defer a decisive battle till he was joined by his allies, wrote to the consul, and demanded to be accepted as arbitrator between the Eomans and the Tarentines. Laevinus answered, that the king himself must first make amends for having invaded Italy, and that war must decide between them. The hostile armies met on the banks of the Liris, a small river between Pandosia and Heraclea, and the consid was compelled, by the fear of scarcity among his troops, to force the battle. The Eomans fought like lions : seven times did both armies advance and retreat alternately, but the Thessalian cavalry of Pyrrhus and his elephants, the formidable aspect of which broke the courage of the Eomans, decided the day ; the Eomans took to flight, and no one would perhaps have escaped had not a wounded elephant in his fury turned against his own men and stopped their pirrsuit. Pyrrhus took the enemy's camp without resistance : he had gained indeed a most complete victory. On the following day he visited the field of battle, and seeing the bodies of the Eomans, all of whom had fallen with then faces towards the enemy, he exclaimed, \" With such soldiers the world would be mine ; and it would belong to the Eomans if I were then- commander.\" But the best part of his own army had fallen, and to those who congratulated him on his victory, he re plied, \" One more such victory and I should be obliged to return to Epirus without a single soldier.\" He proposed to the Boman captives that they should serve in his army, but all refused : and"], [253, "233 WAR WITH PYRRHUS. he ordered the bodies of the dead to be burned and buried like those of his own soldiers. Of the Eomans 7000 are said to have fallen, and only 4000 of their enemies. Pyrrhus gave his allies a part of the spoils, and dedicated another part to Zeus at Tarentum, with the inscription, The men till then unconquer'd, best Olympian father ! Have I in battle conquer'd ; and they, too, eonquer'd me. ' The immediate consequence of this victory was that the Italians, and Boman subjects, the Apuliaiis, Locrians, and a num ber of separate towns, openly joined Pyrrhus. Decius Jubellius, the commander of the Campanian legion at Ehegium, charged the inhabitants of the place with intending to desert the cause of Eome ; and Ehegium was treated in consequence like a hostile town taken in war : the men were put to the sword, and the women and children made slaves. Jubellius and his men, from that moment, ceased to regard themselves as Eomans, and uniting with the Mamertines, who had taken possession of Messana a few years before in the same way, established themselves as an independent state, and took no part in the war against Pyrrhus until it touched then* own territory. Pyrrhus, who disliked long-protracted wars, and was anxious to accomplish as much as possible by persuasion, sent his eloquent friend and minister, Cineas, to Eome with proposals of peace, while he himself in the meantime collected the forces of his Italian allies. Cineas, on his arrival at Eome, offered peace with Pyrrhus and the Tarentines, on condition that Eome should recognise the independence of all the Greek towns in Italy, and that the Samnites, Apulians, and Lucanians, should receive back all that the Eomans had taken from them. After Cineas had delivered his proposals, and while the Eomans were hesitating as to what course to pursue, the aged App. Claudius the Blind, in an energetic speech, frustrated the plans of the cunning Greek, who was obliged to quit the city forthwith. What he had seen at Bome filled him with amaze- 7 Orosius, iv. 1 ."], [254, "234 HISTORY OF ROME. ment, for the city, he said, was one temple, and the senate an assembly of kings. New legions were formed to reinforce the army of Laevinus : all who were capable of bearing arms voluntarily offered to serve their country, and preparations were made for the defence of the city. Laevinus, who had retreated with the remains of his army to Capua, being there joined by fresh reinforcements, thwarted the attempts of Pyrrhus, who having also advanced thus far, accompanied by his Italian allies, tried to make himself master of Capua. Some parts of Campania, however, were laid waste by the enemy, whose progress was checked only by petty skir mishes. Taking Fregellae by storm, Pyrrhus thence proceeded to Anagnia and Praeneste, both of which places fell into his hands, together with the Acropolis of the latter, from which he could see the city of Bome itself at a distance. His outposts ad vanced even further. But here a stop was put to the king's progress, for at that moment peace was concluded with the Etrus cans, on whom Pyrrhus had reckoned ; the army of Coruncanius had returned to Bome ; and Laevinus had contrived to cut off the communication between the different parts of the hostile army. Pyrrhus, having lost all hope of compelling Bome to accept the peace he had before proposed in vain, retreated ; a step for which it is difficult to give a satisfactory account, for he might at least have maintained himself in the places which he had taken. In Cam pania he found himself opposed by Laevinus, who had now a far more numerous army at his command than he possessed on the Liris, and offered battle. But Pyrrhus did not think it advisable to accept it, and proceeded to Tarentum, where he took up his winter quarters. His troops there indulged in the enjoyment of the rich booty they had made, while the army of Laevinus was led into Samnium, and spent the winter in a country where all the means of subsistence had to be wrung from the hands of then enemies. Before a new campaign was opened, the Eomans sent three ambassadors, C. Fabricius, Q. Aemffius Papus, aud P. Dolabelk,"], [255, "235 WAR WITH PYRRHUS. to negotiate with the king for the liberation of his prisoners ; and Pyrrhus, who was desirous to conclude the war in an honour able manner, received them kindly on the frontier of the Taren tine territory. The proposal of the Eomans to exchange the prisoners, or to accept a ransom, was rejected ; but the king allowed all the prisoners, together with the three ambassadors, to go to Eome for the purpose of celebrating the festival of the Saturnalia, adding, that if the senate would accept his terms, they might remain at Eome and be free ; but they had to pledge their word to return, if by a certain day the senate should not have agreed to his terms. The prisoners, during their stay at Eome, exerted all their powers to induce then fellow-citizens to make peace with Pyrrhus, but in vain : they were obliged to return into captivity ; and the senate declared, that any one who should be untrue to his word, and attempt to remain, should be put to death. AU without a single exception therefore returned to Pyrrhus. The king opened the campaign of the year B.C. 279, by laying siege to several places in Apulia. The two consids, P. Sulpi cius and P. Decius Mus, hastened with then forces to relieve those places, and met the enemy in the neighbourhood of Asculum. For some time the armies faced each other without any inclination to engage in a battle, but when it commenced the Eomans made almost incredible efforts and fought during the whole day. The losses on both sides were very gTeat, and Pyrrhus himself was wounded ; at length, however, he gained a victory, notwithstanding the self-sacrifice of Decius, who is said to have imitated the example of his father and grandfather.8 Six thousand Eomans lay on the field of battle, and the king lost 3505 men; but the victory was useless; and Pyrrhus, not ven turing to attack the Boman camp, withdrew to Tarentum : it had now become evident to him that he could place no rehance on his Italian allies, and he spent the remainder of the year in in activity. His conduct may to some extent have been the conse- 8 Cic.

The Carthaginian admiral then tried to act as a mediator of peace with Pyrrhus, but likewise to no purpose, for the latter, it seems, had already formed the plan of crossing over into Sicily. The kingdom of Pyrrhus was, in the meantime, visited by the ravaging hordes of the Gauls, and the Eomans severely felt the pressure of the war with Pyrrhus. When both parties therefore were not much inclined to continue it, an event occurred which afforded to both a most desirable oppor tunity for putting an end to their hostilities. In B.C. 278, the consuls, C. Fabricius and Q. Aemilius Papus, undertook the command in the war. A traitor offered to them, at the beginning of the campaign, to poison Pyrrhus ; but the Eomans honestly denounced the scoundrel : Pyrrhus was so deeply moved by this honourable conduct, that he sent his friend Cineas to lead back all the Boman prisoners that were in his possession, provicling them with clothing, and honouring them with rich presents : Cineas was further commissioned to try to obtain a peace on tolerable and decent terms for the king and Iris Italian allies. The Eomans still refused to listen to any proposals of peace, until the king should have quitted Italy ; but a truce appears to have been concluded,10 which enabled Pyrrhus to carry out his plan of crossing over into Sicily. Milo was left in the command of the garrison at Tarentum ; and the king's son, Alexander, was left behind as governor of Locri. Towards the end of the summer, in b.c 278, two years and four months after his arrival in Italy, Pyrrhus crossed over to Sicily in 60 galleys, which were furnished him by the Syracusans. The Carthaginians were then in possession of Sicily, with the exception of Syracuse, which was suffering not only from the 9 Liv. Epit. xiii. ; Polyb. iii. 25. 10 Appian, Samnit. p. 69, ed. Schweigh."], [257, "PYRRHUS RETURNS TO ITALY. 237 Carthaginians, but from the tyrants who, after the death of Agathocles, disputed the sovereignty of the city one with another, sword in hand. Pyrrhus's object was to drive the Carthaginians from the island, and to establish himself in it ; and he might have gained his end, had he not been misled by his Sicilian ad visers, and had not the faithlessness of the Sicilian Greeks thwarted his undertakings. After a stay of three years in the island he returned to Italy, laden with immense booty, of which, however, the greater part was lost in a storm, before he reached the coast of Italy. The Eoman prisoners whom Pyrrhus had sent back before em barking for Sicily were treated by their countrymen as infamous, and every one of them had to perform the most arduous duties in the camp, untd he should recover his honour by bringing the spoils of two enemies. During the absence of Pyrrhus, the Eomans reduced to submission and punished then- revolted sub jects : thus, in B.c. 278, C. Fabricius gained victories over the Lucanians, Bruttians, Tarentines, and Samnites ; and he was honoured with a triumph. In the year following, the consuls P. Bufinus and C. Junius Bubulcus carried on the war in Sam nium, taking several of the towns which still held out, and spreading devastation wherever they appeared. The Samnites had carried their women, children, and property, into inaccessible mountain districts, and the Eomans, who endeavoured to gain possession of them, suffered severe losses. Hereupon Bufinus marched into Lucania, and laid siege to Croton, whither the portion of the citizens favourable to Eome had invited him. The town was soon after taken by treachery ; and the general, Nicomachus, escaped to Tarentum after having sustained a severe loss. Locri also went over to the Eomans. In B.C. 276, the consul Q. Fabius triumphed over the Samnites, Lucanians, and Bruttians ; and the distressed Italians implored Pyrrhus to come to then assistance. Pyrrhus was glad thus to obtain a pretext for leaving Sicdy ; but in the straits he was met by a Carthaginian fleet, which sank seventy of his ships, and only"], [258, "238 HISTORY OF ROME. twelve escaped to the coast of Italy between Ehegium and Locri. After his landing, he suffered another great loss from the Mamertines, who were waiting for him in the narrow mountain passes with a large army. Locri, however, was compelled to surrender to him, and was severely chastised. From Locri he went with an army of 20,000 foot and 3000 horse to Tarentum, but these troops were chiefly fickle Greeks, for his brave Epirots had fallen in the battles he had fought. The Eomans however were seized with the same consternation and alarm, when they heard of his return, as they had been at the time when he arrived from Epirus. In B.c. 275, two consular armies marched into the field : one was led by M'. Curius Dentatus into Samnium, the other by L. Cor nelius Lentidus into Lucania. Pyrrhus, who was strengthened by all the Tarentines capable of bearing arms, advanced against Curius Dentatus ; he was also joined by a Samnite army, which however was weak and desponding. He contrived to keep Lentulus at a distance from his colleague, in order that he might first fight against the latter alone. Curius Dentatus occupied a strong and fortified position near Beneventmn, but was not inclined to venture upon a battle, until he should be joined by his colleague. Pyrrhus and his generals, on the other hand, were impatient of delay. During the night, a part 'of the king's troops tried by a round-about way to reach the top of the hill above the Boman camp ; but matters had been badly calculated, and it was already broad day -right when they descended from the heights. Curius resolved to meet the hostile troops, who were in disorder, and fatigued by the night march. His plans were well founded, for soon after the contest had begun, the king's troops fled, and numbers of them were slain. Curius, now emboldened, began the battle against the main force of the enemy in the plain. Pyrrhus was completely defeated : his camp was taken ; two ele phants were killed, and four were taken alive, which afterwards adorned the consul's triumph. Pyrrhus himself reached Taren tum with only a few horsemen : as his allies in Lucania were"], [259, "PYRRHUS RETURNS TO EPIRUS. 239 equally unfortunate, he endeavoured to obtain succours from the kings of Macedonia and Syria ; but his expectations were not realised, and he was obliged to abandon Italy. Milo with the garrison at Tarentum remained behind. A report, that the reinforcements which Pyrrhus had solicited were on their way to Italy, enabled him to keep his fleet ready to take his troop s back to Epirus. The army which he led back consisted of only 8000 foot and 500 horse ; and the want of money to pay them drove him into new adventures in Greece, until he was killed at Argos in a battle against Antigonus, in B.C. 273. He was one of the greatest generals of antiquity, but he neglected the welfare of his own kingdom, and hurried from one giddy adventure into another until he perished. After the departure of Pyrrhus, the Eomans for a time abstained from prosecuting the war against his allies ; for they wanted rest, being exhausted by then preceding exertions. Meantime the Tarentines, tired of then Epirot garrison, conspired against Milo; but as then plan failed, their leaders made then- escape and con cluded peace with the Eomans. In B.C. 272, the Eomans at length resolved to put an end to the war in southern Italy. The consuls, L. Papirius Cursor and Sp. Carvilius, accomplished this object : the Samnites, Lucanians, and Bruttians did homage to the majesty of Bome ; for the death of Pyrrhus appears to have destroyed all their hopes. The Tarentines now secretly applied to the Carthaginian commanders in Sicily for assistance ; and while Papirius was encamped before the town, a Carthaginian fleet appeared at the entrance of its harbour. Milo, to whom the Carthaginians and Eomans were no less hostile than the Tarentines themselves, nevertheless prevailed upon the latter to choose him to negotiate a peace with C. Fabricius. But he acted only for himself, and betrayed the Tarentines, for when all the points were announced to be settled, the people of Tarentum learned with amazement that the Eomans were in possession of the citadel, while Milo, under their protection, departed for Epirus with his treasures. Tarentum was now obliged to surrender ;"], [260, "240 HISTORY OF ROME. but the Eomans treated the town with more mildness than it deserved : they seem to have feared lest the Tarentines shoidd call in the aid of the Carthaginians, who, in then envy and jealousy of Bome, would have been glad of an opportunity of directing their arms against her. Tarentum remained free, but its walls were broken down, and its ships and arms taken away. The triumph after this war brought to Bome many luxu ries, and from this time we must date a great change in the manners and mode of riving among the Eomans. Livius Andro nicus, the earliest Boman dramatist, whose first play was per formed about thirty years later, was one of the prisoners that were carried from Tarentum to Bome. The fall of Tarentum was soon followed by that of Ehegium, which was still in the hands of the Campanian legion. It was blockaded by the consul Genu cius in B.C. 271, who at the same time contrived to separate the Mamertines from them by a treaty. After a long siege the town was taken by storm : the greater number of the Campanians fell by the sword, and all the deserters that were found among them were immediately put to death. The surviving Campa nians, 300 in number, were sent to Eome in chains, and there they were scourged and beheaded. The remaining citizens of Ehegium had their town, and then- property as far as it was pos sible, restored to them. In B.C. 268, the last Samnite war blazed forth from the ashes. The Samnites had been obliged to send hostages to Eome : Lol lius, one of them, had escaped to the mountains of his native country, and there gathered round himself a band of robbers and others, who had no choice between a wretched rife and death. Two consular armies took the field against the rebels, who had scarcely heard of the approach of the enemy before they gave up then senseless enterprise. The leaders of the insurrection were beheaded, and the other prisoners were sold. In the same year the Picentians revolted against Eome, but were soon con quered, and their whole country, with its capital of Asculum, was reduced to submission. In B.C. 266, the Sallentines were"], [261, "ROME MISTRESS OF ITALY. 241 likewise subdued, and Brundusium fell into the hands of the Eomans. These conquests, which where secured by a number of colonies, completed the subjugation of Italy. But before peace was restored throughout the peninsula, Bome had to make one more effort. The Etruscan town of Volsinii was under the protection of Eome. The slaves and freedmen of that place had raised themselves to an equality with their lords, on whom they pro bably wreaked then; vengeance in a very cruel manner. Q. Fabius Gurges was sent out with an army to the assistance of the aris tocracy, and conquered the enemy in the field, but lost his life in an unsuccessful attempt to storm the town, which was now closely besieged. But it was not taken till the year following : its defenders fell into the hands of the Eomans, and were put to death as rebellious slaves, or delivered up to their former masters. Volsinii was razed to the ground, and the surviving Volsinians were transplanted to another but unfortified place. After struggles which had lasted for nearly five centuries, Eome thus succeeded in making herself mistress of the penin sula of Italy. We might believe that the dominion of Italy, compact and separated as it is from other countries, woidd have satisfied the Eomans ; and that, as a people, they might perhaps have remained happier and purer within the natural boundaries of the peninsula ; but they were called to greater things, even to determine the fate of the world. The possession of Italy required to be secured from without ; and the threatening position of Carthage, which strove to extend its dominion over south-western Europe, and had already manifested a desire to interfere, from Sicily, with the affairs of Italy, could hardly permit the Eomans to look on quietly : hence the Eoman senate can scarcely be blamed for taking the first favourable opportunity of waging a war with Carthage, which could, after all, be only delayed, not avoided. All the nations of Italy, from the straits in the south to the river Macra in the north, now obeyed the commands of Eome. The country north of Etruria and Umbria was inhabited by u"], [262, "242 HISTORY OF ROME. Ligurian and Celtic tribes, which were yet free and unsubdued. In what manner the affairs of the conquered people were re gulated is not known in every case, but we have good reason to believe, that in general it was done in a prudent and mode rate manner; for during the whole of the first Tunic war, which immediately followed the subjugation of Italy, we do not hear of any movement of a single Italian town or nation against Bome ; and previous to the arrival of Hannibal, the country was more prosperous and flourishing than ever after. Since all Italy now formed, so to speak, one state, the different parts of which enjoyed different rights and privileges, according to the different ways in which they had come to recognise the sovereignty of Bome, we shall here subjoin a brief account of the various rela tions in which the Italians stood to Bome. From within, Bome secured her possessions and conquests by the establishment of numerous colonies in the countries of her conquered enemies ; for it was the policy of the Eomans, who never rose to the idea of an Italian nationality, but ever retained that of a sovereign city, to endeavour to reduce then subjects to a con dition in which they should be prevented, as much as possible, from revolt, and be required to serve then sovereign wherever it was needed. Then freedom and then territory were generally taken from them; and where these were not taken away, they were left to the conquered as the gifts of the Eomans : their national feelings were destroyed, in order to render them the fitter instru ments for their rulers. The maxim expressed by Virgil,11 \" Parcere subjectis ac debellare superbos,\" was followed by the Eomans from the earliest times : with the appearance of fair ness and disinterestedness they treated their subjects ; and those oppressed by others, in a manner which was sure to make them their faithful allies; while those who ventured to offer resistance, and to maintain or recover their independence, were visited with almost inhuman cruelty. The towns which possessed the Eoman franchise were called 11 Am. vi. 854."], [263, "ROME'S ALLIES AND SUBJECTS. 243 municipia, and then- citizens municipes. All towns of this kind, however, were divided into three classes : the first comprised those which had the Eoman franchise (civitas), but whose citizens had neither the right to vote in the assemblies at Bome, nor to hold any magistracy there ; such towns were Fundi, Formiae, Cumae, Acerrae, Lanuvium and Tusculum. Municipia of the second class were those which were completely incorporated with the Boman state, as was the case with Anagnia, Caere, andArick: these had no separate administration of then own internal affairs, whereas those of the first class retained their own constitutions and magistrates. The third class of municipia were those whose inhabitants might go to Eome and there exercise all the rights of Eoman citizens, and yet retain at home then own adminis tration, as was the case with Tibur, Praeneste, Pisa, and many other towns. The colonies (coloniae) stood to Eome in the relation of chil dren to a parent, and formed a kind of miniature copies of the city of Eome itself. A Eoman colony differed from a colony, in the modern sense of the word, by the fact, that the former was estab lished in a town or city which had been already inhabited, before its occupation by the Eomans, and was never founded without a decree of the senate; whereas a modern colony usually settles in a yet uninhabited district. The colonists, who were sent into such a town as a garrison, usually received the third part of its territory as then- full property, the remainder being left to the original inhabitants of the place, who became the subject people, while the colonists formed the ruling body. The ordinary number of colonists sent to one particular place was 300, and each received two jugera of land ; but this regulation was often modified, according to circumstances. We must distinguish between two kinds of colonies, viz. Eoman colonies (coloniae civium Roma norum) and Latin colonies (coloniae Latinae). The settlers might be the same in both, but the political rights of the two kinds of colonies were different. A person going out with a Eoman m 2"], [264, "244 HISTORY OF ROME. colony retained the same rights which, as a citizen, he would have had at Eome : it seems also that a person could join a Eoman colony only by his free consent, and that he could not be compelled to it. The rights enjoyed by a Latin colony were the same as those possessed by a Latinus, and altogether of an artificial kind, inasmuch as they were rights devised and granted by the Eoman senate. A Latin colony might consist of Boman citizens, Latins, Hernicans, or any other allied nation ; but those Boman citizens who joined in it (they could not be compelled to do so) lost then- full franchise as Eomans, which, however, they might easily recover. Another class of towns were the prefectures (praefecturae), or towns which were by no means reduced to perfect political dependence : they continued to form distinct political commu nities, to which Eome sent annual prefects (praefecti) to administer justice to the Eomans residing in them. Such a town, however, might, be a municipium or a colony ; it was only on account of the prefect that it differed from other Italian towns ; and its inhabitants might be in the enjoyment of the full Eoman franchise. The Latins in Latium, and the different Latin colonies, are often designated by the expression women Latinum : these must be dis tinguished from the allies or socii. Both together are mentioned by the name socii rumen Latinum, that is, socii et women Latinum. By a singular mistake, some writers have changed this into the senseless socii nominis Latini, forgetting the ordinary practice of the Eomans to omit the copulative et, as in the case of populus Romanus Quirites. The socii, or allies, were either foederati, that is, people whose rights were secured by treaties with Eome, and by mutual oaths ; or liberi, that is, people to whom, after their subjugation, the Eoman senate had granted their full independ ence or autonomy, and whose rights, in consequence, had no other security than the goodwill of the Eomans. The inhabitants of places taken by the sword, or of towns which had been com-"], [265, "ROME'S ALLIES AND SUBJECTS. 245 pelled to surrender at discretion, were dedititii : they no longer formed distinct political bodies; they had no freedom nor com mercium; they were a kind of serfs of the Eoman people ; they had lost then- own landed property, and were not allowed to acquire any elsewhere, so that they gradually decayed and crumbled away."], [266, "246 HISTORY OF ROME. CHABTEE XIV. CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE REPUBLIC MILITARY AFFAIRS RELIGION ARTS AND LITERATURE MANNERS AND STATE OF MORALITY. The constitution of the Boman republic, which had at first been an oppressive aristocracy, and had gradually become a mild and temperate form of democracy, had by this time reached its highest perfection; and on the whole, it may be said, that this state of perfection continued down to the end of the Punic wars, when Polybius,1 himself a great statesman, saw its working, and ad mired it. The manner in which the constitution had been developed, and brought to that point by many commotions, struggles, and secessions of the commonalty, and by the most strenuous exertions of then tribunes, has been related in the preceding part of this history -. it only remains here to make a few general observations upon its character and working. The Eoman constitution was not a written document, such as has been drawn up in modem times in several continental states ; but like the English constitution, it was gradually and practically developed out of slender elements. Some parts of it, indeed, were settled by written laws and compacts between the two orders ; but others consisted in traditionary forms and customs, which were hallowed by time, and revered by the Eomans as sanctioned by the practice of then- forefathers (more majorum). Hence we cannot expect that everything should have been accurately de fined ; and hence, owing to the loss of so many ancient authors and public documents, we are unable to describe every point with 1 Polyb. iv. 11."], [267, "THE CONSTITUTION OF ROME. 247 that precision which we could desire. The political power was so widely and wonderfully distributed among the several bodies of which the republic consisted, viz., the senate, the magistrates, and the remaining body of the citizens, that there could be no fear either of anarchy or military despotism ; for each of these three powers was at once a check upon and a support of the others, and it was the interest of each to win and preserve the goodwill of the others ; the great plans of the republic could not be carried out otherwise than by the harmonious co-opera tion of all parties. The consuls carried into effect the decrees of the senate, convoked the people to the assembly, levied the troops, determined the contingents which the allies had to furnish for the armies, and punished the offences committed by the sol diers during the time of their service. The sums necessary for mili tary purposeswere voted by the senate, and when this was done, the consuls demanded that the quaestors or public treasurers should take the money from the treasury. The senate had the adminis tration of the finances, or of the revenue and expenditure of the state, and controlled the accounts of the censors and quaestors. The senate further was the high court of justice, which tried all crimes committed against the state, settled the disputes among the allies, and sent ambassadors to, and received ambassadors from, foreign powers. The number of ambassadors sent by the senate was usually three, or ten : they formed, as it were, a select committee of the senate, empowered to negotiate with a foreign power ; but such negotiations, before they became valid, required to be sanctioned or ratified by the senate and people. The political rights of the people have already been stated, in the account of their gradual growth and development. The people conferred the executive power upon the magistrates, and punished or rewarded them, according to the manner in which they had used the power delegated to them. Declarations of peace and war, and treaties, were not valid until they were sanctioned by the people. A Eoman citizen could not be condemned to death except by the people; but before the tribes had voted on his case, he"], [268, "248 HISTORY OF ROME. might, if he apprehended his condemnation, withdraw into volun tary exile. This was a wise custom, inasmuch as it enabled the people to retract any rash or unjust verdict; and there are several instances of persons who thus escaped, and were afterwards triumphantly recalled from their exile. After the equalisation of the orders of the patricians and plebeians, the assembly of the curiae and tribes still continued to be held, but only for set purposes, such as the election of certain officers, and to sanction certain measures ; otherwise they were little more than mere forms : the assembly of the centuries, in their comiection with the tribes, was now the most important assembly. The powers of these three bodies, of which the Eoman republic consisted, were very nicely balanced, and then efficiency arose from then- co-operation. A consul, for example, required a de cree of the senate before he could levy an army ; and his treaties with foreign nations were powerless unless they obtained the sanction of the senate and people : after the close of a campaign also he might be taken to account by the people, for he was a responsible officer. The senate, on the other hand, could not carry on the administration of the republic without the good will and co-operation of the people, or the tribunes who were the organs of the people, and cotdd prevent any resolution of the senate by then- intercession. The people, lastly, were benefited by acting in concord with the senate : as the farming of the tolls, public lands, mines, and the contracts for public buildings, pro ceeded from the senate, and as the chief magistrates had power over the life and death of the citizens in the field, the people had every inducement to act in concord with the senate and magis trates so long as neither of them overstept the bounds of their authority. While the powers of the republic were thus equally distributed and balanced, Bome was happy and flourishing ; but when one power began to predominate and overrule the others, the equipoise was lost, and the whole fabric fell into decay. Although a consul united in his person the highest civil and military power, yet he was not allowed to exercise the latter"], [269, "ADMINISTRATION OF THE REPUBLIC. 249 within the city, or in its territory, at the distance of one mile all around. Unlimited military power was possessed only by a dic tator, who was appointed in times of great danger ; but those abuses, which in former tunes dictators had made of then power, are no longer mentioned in the period we are here speaking of. The most important office, and the one in which the vital prin ciple of the republic was most energetically manifested, was that of the tribunes of the people ; for they had the right to interfere in everything, either stopping proceedings that were going on, or affording their protection to the injured and oppressed. But they had no judicial power. The administration of justice, which had passed from the hands of the consuls into those of the prae tors, had been greatly facilitated, as we have seen, by the jus Flavian/an. The judges, appointed by the praetor to decide upon a given case, were taken from among the senators. The administration of the finances was, as we remarked above, in the hands of the senate. The public revenue consisted in the tribute of the Eoman citizens and the Italian allies, in the rent paid for the use of the domain land, which was let to farm like the tolls, in the port and import duties, in the produce of the mines, salt-works, and of the booty, all or part of which was sold for the benefit of the state. The accounts of the public treasury were kept by the quaestors (guaestores), whose number was in creased in B.C. 275 to eight, on account of the increased business arising out of the conquests which Eome had made at the time. The quaestors, hke other public functionaries, were assisted by clerks (notarii or scribae), who were mostly freedmen, and who formed a distinct class of persons : owing to their position, they had no claims to any of the higher offices, though Cn. Flavius, one of them, succeeded in obtaining the aedileship. The police of Bome was at first in the hands of the plebeian aediles, and afterwards, with more extensive powers, in those of the curule aediles, who had at the same time the superintendence of the temples and other public buildings ; but in times of scarcity a praefect of the corn-market (praefectus amonae) was appointed, m 3"], [270, "250 HISTORY OF ROME. who had to take care that a sufficient supply of food was imported, and that it was sold at a fixed price, so as to prevent the cost from being beyond the means of the poor. No magistrate had such extensive power over the public and private life of Boman citi zens as the censors. Then- main business from the first had been to draw up the lists of the senators, equites, and the remaining body of citizens, and to ascertain and register the amount of then property. But as a man's property is in a great measure dependent upon Iris conduct, the censors soon also became the superintendents of the moral conduct of the citizens ; and then influence acquired an extraordinary extent, for it was in their power to determine a person's status in society. They could punish by then censorial mark of censure (nota censoria) any violation of a citizen's duty towards the state, his fellow-citizens, or his own position, dishonourable occupations, the squandering of property, the violation of things devoted to religious purposes, the neglect of agricultm-e, and a great many other offences. But however great the influence of the censors might be, they could neither deprive a citizen of his franchise, nor confer it upon a person not possessing it : all they were empowered to do, was to degrade a citizen, that is, to remove him from his tribe into a less honourable one (tribu inovere), to make him an aerarian, or enter his name in the tables of the Caerites. Such a punishment however was not permanent, for the censors of the next lustrum might always restore a citizen to his former position, if they thought his conduct entitled him to it. With regard to the constitution of the army, its regulation, according to the centuries instituted by king Servius Tulrius, con tinued for a considerable time after the establishment of the commonwealth ; but the perpetual wars which followed one ano ther in rapid succession, and which made the Eomans acquainted with other nations, led them to introduce various changes into then own system. In the earlier times, the wars had frequently lasted only a few days or weeks, during which the loss of human rife cannot have been very great, the hostile armies being generally"], [271, "THE ARMY AND ARMOUR. 251 satisfied with ravaging the fields of their enemies, and with car rying away as much booty as they could. But after the siege of Veii, the campaigns had become longer and more serious ; and no sooner had the Eomans gone forth triumphantly, and with fresh vigour, from the wars with the Gauls, than they had to fight against the Samnites, Latins, Etruscans, Pyrrhus, and the inha bitants of southern Italy, with whom they did not struggle for the possession of a few fields, but for the sovereignty of Italy. Whether the soldiers received any pay as early as the time of the kings, is very doubtful: all the writers agree in stating that pay for the soldiers was not introduced till the war against Veii, which we must also take to be the beginning of the art of besieging a town. The ordinary means of taking a place, if it could not be otherwise compelled to surrender, was to undermine its walls ; for the aries or battering-ram, by which the walls were shattered to pieces, w-as an invention of later times, and as yet unknown to the Eomans. At the time of the Gallic war, the ancient armour of brass was exchanged by Camillus for hon armour, a polished hon helmet being a better preservative against the mighty swords of the barbarians. The increased value of brass may likewise have contributed to the introduction of hon for military purposes. Camillus is also said to have surrounded the shields of the sol diers with iron rims. The original shields of the Eomans (clypei) were, like those of the ancient Greeks, of brass ; but after the Veientine war, a different kind of shield (scutum) was introduced, which consisted of a wooden frame covered with the hide of an ox. At the same time, the ancient weapon of the front lines was exchanged for a peculiar kind of spear (pilum), seven feet long, by which a blow might be warded off, and which might also be used as a weapon to attack the enemy. The Eoman sword was short, resembling a large knife, but many a battle was decided by it. A legion, according to Livy's account, consisted, at the time of the Latin war, of five divisions or battalions, which are called"], [272, "252 HISTORY OF ROME. hastati, principes, triarii, rorarii, and accensi. The rorarii were slingers, or a sort of light-armed infantry, like the later velites ; and the accensi were a reserve which followed the legion. The regular number of men contained in a legion was 4,500, in addi tion to which there always were 300 horsemen belonging to it. Four legions were generally levied every year, and the allies had, to send a contingent of double the amount. In many cases however, the Eomans were compelled, by circumstances to exceed the ordinary number ; as in the war against the Yolsckns in B.C. 405, when Eome alone is said to have sent ten legions into the field. The military laws, respecting the subordination of the soldiers and officers to then commander, were extremely severe, as is attested by numerous examples ; but when the soldiers rested in their camp, it was not uncommon for then- commander to amuse himself with his men by gymnastic exercises and games of various kinds. The greatest reward of a general, after a successful campaign, was to be allowed to enter the city in a triumphal procession : the other rewards were usually, in them selves, simple and trifling, and were given to common soldiers no less than to their commanders ; but they were always signifi cant, and incited those who were honoured with them to great deeds in the service of the republic. A perfect system of tactics was unknown to the Eomans till the time of Pyrrhus, who was not only an able general himself but a writer on tactics, and who made them acquainted with the Mace donian system, and the use of elephants in war. It is commoidy believed that the Eomans had no navy till the time of the first Punic war; but this opinion is contradicted, partly by then treaties with Carthage, and partly by the appointment of admirals (duumviri navales), who were elected every year from B.C. 443. The ships were probably furnished by the maritime towns subject to Eome. A regular fleet, however, of vessels, with five benches of rowers, was not kept up by the Eomans until their war with Carthage. The religion of the Eomans, which was so wonderfully inter-"], [273, "RELIGION AND MODE OF LIVING. 253 woven with all the affairs of their private and public life, both in war and in peace, had been considerably modified by the intro duction of Greek divinities and modes of worship, which were engrafted upon the ancient Italian religion. It was in vain that the aediles opposed the adoption of foreign rites ; for in times of great distress, the people, under the guidance of the Sibylline books, would make recourse to them ; hoping to obtain, through the mediation of foreign gods, that which then own divinities seemed unwilling to grant. It was under such circumstances that the image of Aesculapius was fetched from Epidaurus. The worship of this god brought to Bome a number of Greek physicians, who undertook to cure the sick by incubatio,t\\iat is, by spending the nights in the god's temple, and by other religious ceremonies. The ancient worship of the gods of the country, being thus more and more pushed into the back-ground, fell into oblivion, so that in many instances it became a matter of mere antiquarian curiosity, and was as obscure and ivniiiteffigible to the Eomans themselves as it is to us. The auspices still continued to maintain their ancient dignity and authority, for public undertakings were never entered upon without consulting the auspices. Isolated instances of disregard for them, however, occur long before the Punic wars ; and it is evident that as early as that time many persons regarded them as mere forms, or used them hypocritically, as a means for unjust and selfish purposes. The letter of the religious laws began at Eome, at a very early time, to prevail over then spirit, until, in the days of Cicero, men had lost all religious feeling, and treated religious matters either with perfect indifference or ridicule. Intellectual culture is a delicate plant, which cannot well grow and develope its quiet beauties amid the troubles of destructive wars ; hence its progress was slow among the people of Eome. Commerce, at this time, must have been carried on to a very great extent with the Etruscans, and southern Italians, with whom mercantile intercourse was kept up even in war, during those months in which there was a cessation of hostilities ; Boman"], [274, "254 HISTORY OF ROME. merchant-ships also visited Sicily, and even Carthage, where they were allowed to trade by treaties. But from Sardinia, and from Libya, they were excluded by the jealousy of Carthage. The main source of wealth among the Eomans, and then- most ho- nourable occupation, was agriculture : the greatest generals and statesmen, after they had held the helm of the republic and gained victories and triumphs, did not scruple to return to the plough, and live in rural retirement, disdaining the pomp and splendour which hi other times and countries would have been inseparable from then- high position. Eustic pursuits produced and nourished the highest virtues that characterise the best of the Eomans ; and the greatest praise that a censor could bestow upon a man was, that he was a good husbandman and father. Then- mode of living still continued to be extremely simple : then ordinary food consisted of a kind of porridge made of flour, and fruit of the fields. Bread was made at home by the women. In the time of the Samnite wars, wine was thought so precious, that even the libations to the gods consisted of mere drops of wine ; and one Mecenius was not censured for having killed his wife, because she had drunk wine without his knowing it. The ma jority of people dwelt in huts, or small cottages, and slept on beds of straw ; and the streets were not yet paved ; but clean- liness was enjoined by religion in all the states of antiquity. Public buildings, however, began to be distinguished by then grandeur and splendour ; and after the second Samnite war, pri- vate houses were better built than they had been before ; so that, on the whole, the city must have assumed at that time a stately appearance. Down to the time of Pyrrhus, houses were covered with wooden shingles, for which, after that time, rain tiles (imbrices) were substituted. But, notwithstanding this general simplicity in then mode of living, symptoms of extravagance, and the love of luxuries, began to show themselves here and there at an early period. Thus, P. Cornelius Bufinus, in B.C. 275, was ejected by the censors from the senate, because he possessed silver vessek to the amount"], [275, "INLFUENCE OF LUXURIES. 255 of ten pounds ; and a law against bribery had been found neces sary as early as B.C. 358. How easily the rustic simplicity of the Eomans degenerated into baseness and brutality, is evident from the conduct of the Campanian legion at Ehegium ; and from the fact that, in B.C. 332, a number of Eoman ladies of rank were convicted of having poisoned then- husbands. The conquest of the wealthy city of Tarentum, and the splendid booty which was there taken, increased the taste for luxuries of every kind, and for the ornaments of rife. It is a remarkable fact in Eoman history, that an acquaintance with the luxuries and refinement of the Greeks seldom benefited the Eomans, as it might have done; and numerous cases are on record which show that the Eomans, like barbarians, could not exercise any control over then enjoy ment of novel luxuries, and only debased themselves by them through intemperance and a want of moderation. The first silver coins were issued at Bome in B.C. 269, probably on account of the extended intercourse with foreign nations. Down to the year B.C. 300, the Eomans had allowed then beards to grow freely, but in that year Greek barbers are said to have come from SicDy, and to have introduced the custom of shaving. In later times, wealthy Eomans used to keep slaves for the purpose of shaving then masters ; while the majority of people went to the public shops of the barbers, which were great places of resort hi the morning, when numbers of idle loungers assembled there and talked over the news of the day. Literary and scientific pursuits were still foreign to the Eomans ; for the objects of then education were, on the whole, no other than to train the young men in a manner that would make them good citizens, and render them fit to serve then country in war and peace. The young nobles received the instruction which was thought necessary for these purposes, from Etruscan teachers. The arts, as we have already remarked, were cultivated to a con siderable degree, but more by Etruscans and Greeks residing at Eome than by the Eomans themselves, for artists were not held"], [276, "256 HISTORY OF ROME. in any high esteem, and the arts never flourish where they are not honoured. Painting alone seems to have formed an excep tion, as Fabius Pictor, a distinguished painter, received his sur name from his art. The numerous gold and silver vessels, which were dedicated in the temples, show the increasing wealth of the republic. After the subjugation of Latium, we hear of several equestrian statues which were erected at Eome ; and the amount of works of art, which were carried to the sovereign city from the conquered towns of Etruria and southern Italy, may be inferred from the statement, that after the taking of Volsinii, 2000 statues were carried to Bome. The first sun-dial was set up at Eome, in B.c. 293, by L. Papirius Cursor. The ignorance or want of skill of the Eomans in music is manifest from the following anec dote. The Etruscan flute-players had enjoyed the privilege of taking then meals in the temple of Jupiter ; and when the senate took this privilege from them they emigrated to Tibur. As there was now nobody at Eome that could play the flute at sacri fices, the senate summoned them to return, but they refused. The Tiburtines thereupon were induced to make the Etruscan flute players drunk, and having succeeded in this, they carried them in then- sleep to Eome, where then ancient privilege was restored to them. It has already been observed, that in B.C. 364, Etrus can dancers and actors (ludiones, Jiistriones) were invited from Etruria to avert a plague, from which Eome was then suffering. Such hired actors never enjoyed any estimation at Eome, and were excluded from the civic franchise ; but free-bom youths had then own amusements, in reciting comic and frivolous songs ac companied by dramatic gesticrdation. The time for the develop ment of literature was only just beginning to dawn, and the Eomans of that time were more ambitious to accomplish great military feats, and to display bold and manly courage, than to spend then time in the refined amusements of the Greeks, who in then sight were a degenerate race. Eome had long been connected with Carthage by treaties ; and"], [277, "257 FIRST CONNECTIONS WITH THE EAST. her relations with foreign powers were increased in B.C. 273, when Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, sent an embassy to Bome, and concluded friendship and affiance with the conquerors of Italy. In the year following, the city of Apollonia, on the Ionian gulf, likewise sent an embassy to Bome, but its object is not known. Bome therefore was no longer a stranger to the eastern part of the world."], [278, "258 HISTORY OF ROME. CHAPTEE XV. THE FIRST PUNIC WAR. \u2014 SICILY THE FIRST ROMAN PROVINCE. \u2014 INTERNAL HISTORY DURING THE PERIOD OF THE FIRST PUNIC WAR. After the conquest of Italy, it was impossible for the Eomans to remain peaceful neighbours of the Carthaginians, who were in the possession of all the fan island of Sicily, with the exception of the small kingdom of Hiero, and the north-eastern district, which was ruled over by the Mamertines of Messana. The mutual jealousy between the two republics had become too mani fest during the war of the Eomans against Tarentum. An op portunity for giving vent to this feeling occurred soon after the taking of Ehegium. The Campanians, who had been masters of that town, had been allied with the Mamertines, who were like wise Italians, and who, after serving as mercenaries in Sicily, had taken possession of Messana in the same base and cruel manner as that by which the Campanians had made themselves masters of Ehegium. The fall of the latter town deprived the Mamer tines of their only friends and supporters. In conjunction with them the Mamertines had spared neither the possessions of the Carthaginians in Sicily, nor the Greek towns, and had conquered the north-eastern corner of the island. King Hiero of Syracuse now longed to punish them for the outrages they had committed for many years : with an army, which he had formed of his own subjects, he took from them some towns they had sub jugated ; and in the neighbourhood of Messana he gained a decisive victory over them, in which then- commander was taken prisoner. The Mamertines were so much weakened by this defeat, that they were on the point of imploring the mercy of"], [279, "259 HIERO AND THE MAMERTINES. their conqueror, when they were saved by the interference of a Carthaginian commander, who was cruising off the coast of Messana ; for the Carthaginians foresaw that a connection be tween the Mamertines and Hiero might draw the Eomans into the island, and thus involve them in a struggle with Eome for the possession of Sicily, the complete conquest of which, they fancied, might now be easily accomplished. But the Mamertines were divided among themselves ; for the proffered protection of Carthage created fear and suspicion in the minds of many of them, who would have preferred an affiance with some Italian power. As Hiero was ready to make another attack upon them, no time was to be lost ; and while one part of the Mamertines accepted the protection of Carthage, the other applied for assist ance to Eome. It was now scarcely six years since Eome had inflicted the most severe punishment on her own subjects, who had been guilty of the same crime as the Mamertines ; and she ought to have rejected the offered affiance with the latter with scorn and indignation ; but ambition, and the love of dominion, prevailed over every other feeling. The majority of the senators, indeed, obeyed the laws of conscience and honour, and rejected the proposal ; but the consuls, eager for war, brought the matter before the assembly of the people, who, in then- jealousy of Carthage, and in the hope of a speedy termination of the war, and of rich booty, allowed themselves to be prevailed upon to agree to the affiance with the Mamertines, and to promise them then assistance.1 This decree, which was passed in B.C. 264, is a greater disgrace to Eome than even the murder of C. Pontius : it shows that the constitution was aheady inclining too much to the democratical side, though the republic itself did not suffer any material injury from this state of things for a long time to come. As in the meantime Hiero had been pressing hard upon the Mamertines, the Carthaginian party had admitted a Carthaginian garrison mto the acropolis, and Hiero had thus been obliged to 1 Polyb. i. 12."], [280, "260 HISTORY OF ROME. give up all further undertakings against the place. He was at length prevailed upon by the Carthaginians to make peace with Messana ; and as the Eomans had promised then assistance against Hiero, they had now lost every pretext that could justify their interference on behalf of the Mamertines. For some time the Eomans seem to have been hesitating as to what course they should pursue : at length they resolved on war against the Cartha ginians ; and a legate of the consul Appius Claudius appeared at Ehegium with an army, and a number of triremes which had been furnished by the Greek towns of Italy, for the Eoman fleet had been completely neglected. The legate, however, was pre vented from crossing over into Sicily by a Carthaginian fleet, which was stationed in the straits ; he therefore sailed in a boat to Messana, to proclaim to the Mamertines that the Eomans would deliver them from the yoke of the Carthaginians. Soon after his return, he succeeded, during a favourable wind, in reaching the coast of Sicily with his fleet without any difficulty. Hanno, the commander of the Carthaginian garrison at Messana, was treach erously compelled to surrender the citadel to the Eomans. Another Carthaginian general had in the meantime brought an army to Sicily, and was approaching Messana with a fleet. He called upon the Eomans, in the 'name of Carthage, to evacuate Messana and Sicily before a certain day; and as the Eomans refused, the Carthaginians, in conjunction with Hiero, began to blockade Messana in separate camps. In the night the consul, Appius Claudius himself, landed with fresh legions in Sicily, and drew up his army near that of Hiero, who, being beaten before the Carthaginians could send him any assistance, then retreated to Syracuse. The consul next made an attack upon the camp of 'the Carthaginians, who had considerably weakened then forces by putting to death all the Italian mercenaries serving in then army, who, being emigrants from the countries which had re cently been subdued by Eome, might have been of great service to the Carthaginians. But the latter feared treachery : the consequence was, that they were defeated by the Eomans ; where-"], [281, "HIERO'S TREATY WITH ROME. 261 upon they withdrew among their subject-towns of the island, to spend the winter there, while the Eomans followed up then victory over Hiero, and encamped under the walls of Syracuse. But nothing decisive was accomplished, for they soon retreated to Messana, and the Syracusans, who had aheady suffered so much from the Carthaginians, were not inclined to continue the war against the Eomans. In B.c. 263, the consuls, M'. Otacilius and M'. Valerius, landed with then armies in Sicily, without any obstacle, and Centoripa, Agyrium, and Halaesa surrendered to them : sixty-seven towns are said to have submitted to Eome.2 When the consuls approached Syracuse, Hiero complied with the wishes of his people, and offered peace, which the consuls gladly accepted, for their armies were aheady suffering from want of provisions. The king restored all the Eoman prisoners to free dom, paid down a contribution of 200 talents, and became the ally of Bome.3 He faithfully kept his engagements with Eome ; and without taking any active part hi the war against Carthage, he supported the Eomans with money, arms, and provisions. The peace with Hiero may be regarded as the real beginning of the first Bunic war, though most writers date it from the passage of Claudius's legate into Sicily, in B.C. 264. At the beginning of the war, Carthage might reasonably hope for a fortunate issue of the contest, for she possessed a considera ble navy, large and fertile dominions, a treasury well stocked by the tribute of her subjects, whereby she was enabled to engage the service of large numbers of mercenaries, and a long expe rience in maritime undertakings. Bome, on the other hand, had few resources, no navy, and no numerous armies, since, as yet, no great reliance could be placed on her allies ; but the armies she had at her command consisted of citizens ready to fight for then country to the last : she had corn-age, perseverance, and firmness. Her constitution was, at that time, in its full bloom, while that of Carthage was aheady in its decline. Carthage was unable to 2 Diodor. Eclog. xxiii. 5. 3 Oros. iv. 7; Polyb. i. 16, speaks of only 100 talents."], [282, "262 HISTORY OF ROME. raise armies of citizens : she was obliged to form them of foreign mercenaries, who might be formidable in war for a time, when commanded by a great and experienced general, but might at the same time be very dangerous to the safety of the republic, and were ever ready to rebel. So long as the republic was able to pay them well, and to keep the enemy away from Africa, the defeats affected her but little, and Carthage was safe ; but when the Eomans attacked her in her own immediate neighbourhood, and when she could place no reliance upon her hired protectors, who looked for nothing but pay and booty, the fall of the African republic was unavoidable. After the peace with Hiero, the Eomans penetrated into the western parts of Sicily. Segesta received them, and concluded a favourable treaty with them ; and many other towns followed its example. The Carthaginians did not make their appear ance in the field ; and after so brilliant a campaign of the con suls, any one might have thought that the conquest of Sicily would be a matter of small difficulty, and that peace was not far off: as to the idea of driving the Carthaginians from the island altogether, and of making themselves masters of it, it did not occur to the Eomans till after the taking of Agrigentum. This town was defended by Hannibal the son of Gisco, and in B.C. 262 it was besieged by the Eomans for seven months. The Eomans exerted themselves with the greatest perseverance, and under very unfavourable circumstances, but at length they compelled the town to surrender. The large Carthaginian garrison, which had been stationed within the extensive walls of the city, was allowed to escape, and the rest of the population followed them, with the exception of the aged and the sick. The Eomans then took possession of the place, and indulged in aU the horrors which usually accompany such a conquest :4 25,000 persons are said to have been sold into slavery, and the city was plundered and ransacked by the soldiers, who were eager to indemnify them selves for the hardships they had endured during the long siege. 4 Polyb. i. 17, &c; Diodor. Eclog. xxiii. &c. ; Zonar. viii. 10."], [283, "THE FIRST ROMAN FLEET. 263 Agrigentum was afterwards rebuilt by the Eomans, and exists to this day, under the name of Girgenti, attesting its former great ness by its magnificent ruins. After the loss of Agrigentum, Hanno, who had been sent out to its relief, was called back and heavily fined. While the Eomans were making progress in the interior of the island, the Cartha ginians, who, during the first period of the war had no able gene rals, had to struggle with then own mercenaries, who were clamorous for pay. A numerous band of Gauls were got rid of by a treacherous and cruel stratagem, in order to prevent then going over to the enemy. In the meantime the Carthaginian fleet, which ruled over the sea, ravaged the coasts of Italy, which could not be protected in any part ; and many of the towns on the coast of Sicily were induced by fear again to place themselves under the dominion of Carthage. This turn of the war con vinced the Eomans that no decisive advantages could be gained without a fleet, and that victories in Africa alone could bring the war to a close. The senate, therefore, determined to build a fleet, and attack the enemy on his own element. The woody chain of the Apennines furnished the timber, and a Carthaginian quin quereme, which had been thrown on the coast of Bmttium, and had fallen into the hands of the Eomans, served as the model after which they built then first ships of war. One hundred and thirty ships5 were now built, within sixty days after the trees had been felled. Each quinquereme had 300 rowers and 200 marines. As the Eomans had no practised rowers or sailors, the men were trained for then- work on scaffoldings on land, and afterwards, for a short time, in the ships themselves, while they ky at anchor. All this was done in the greatest hurry, as the condition of Sicily did not allow of any delay. The vessels thus hastily constructed were, of course, not very durable ; they were awkward and unwieldy in comparison with those of Carthage. But the Eomans deserve our admiration on this occasion, not 5 According to Polybius (i. 20) this fleet consisted of 120 ships, 100 quinque- rcmes and 20 triremes."], [284, "264 HISTORY OF ROME. only for the almost incredible rapidity with which they over came all difficulties and provided themselves with a fleet, but also on account of the boldness with which they at once ventured upon that dangerous element, the sea. Meantime a Carthaginian general, Hamilcar, had commenced acting on the offensive, and blockaded Segesta. The Eoman legate, C. Caecirius, had been beaten by him, in an attempt to relieve the town. As the consuls, Cn. Cornelius Scipio and C. Duilius, B.c. 260, were still engaged in superintending the preparations for the fleet, the praetor was, for the time, entrusted with the command in Sicily. Cn. Cornelius, however, with a part of the fleet, sailed to Messana as soon as possible ; but he was credulous and stupid enough to allow himself to be persuaded to go and take possession of the Liparian islands : a Carthaginian commander lay in ambush, and on his appearance the Eomans were seized with a panic ; they fled to the shore, the consul was taken prisoner, and the whole squadron fell into the hands of the enemy. The Carthaginians, who had ridiculed the maritime undertaking of the Eomans, now fancied that they could destroy the whole of the enemy's fleet before it reached Sicily ; but their calculation was wrong. After the defeat of his colleague, C. Duilius undertook the command. He was well aware that the ridicule of the enemy was not undeserved ; and he devised a means by which he hoped to make his awkward ships available, by depriving the enemy of the advantage of man\u0153uvring, and changing as it were the sea-fight into a land-fight. He provided every Eoman ship with a boarding bridge, which held two or three men abreast : these bridges were thrown upon the hostile ships by means of a simple mechanism, and took hold of them with grappling-irons. Being prepared in this manner, C. Duilius went boldly out to meet the enemy, whose fleet was ravaging the coast of Mylae. The Carthaginians hastened to battle as to a certain victory, and neglected even the most necessary precautions. Thirty of then- ships, which were first attacked by the boarding"], [285, "CORSICA AND SARDINIA. 265 bridges, were taken ; and the others, as soon as they came near enough, experienced the same fate. The Carthaginians at last became hopeless, and took to flight. Fourteen Carthaginian ships were destroyed, 3000 men killed and 7000 made prisoners, while the Eomans do not seem to have lost a single ship. The immediate result of this victory was, that the siege of Segesta was raised. C. Duilius was rewarded for his naval victory, the first that Eome had ever gained, not only with a triumph, but with distinctions winch lasted during his whole lifetime ; for he was allowed to be accompanied home in the evening from banquets with torch-right and music, and a column (columna rostratd) adorned with the beaks of the captured ships, was erected, with an inscription recording the details of his victory.6 In the following campaign, B.c. 259, the Eomans no longer thought it necessary to direct their whole force against Sicily, but while the consul C. Aquiffius undertook the war in that island with only one considar army, his colleague, L. Cornelius Scipio, sailed out with the fleet, to make an attack upon Sardinia and Corsica. The whole of the former island was subject to Carthage, and of the latter at least the coast. Aleria in Corsica was taken by the Eomans, and a Carthaginian fleet, under the command of Hannibal, was destroyed ; whereupon Hannibal was put to death by his own men, with whom he had escaped to the shore, but he was honourably buried by the Eomans. Scipio now landed in many parts of the island, and carried away a large number of prisoners. In the neighbourhood of Olbia, however, a numerous Carthaginian army made its appearance, and induced the consid to retreat. Carthage suffered much from this piratical expedition of the Eomans ; but the turn which the war had taken in Sicily, through the diminution in the Eoman forces, was even more injurious to 6 Some fragments of this inscription to an accurate restoration made at a are still extant ; but whether the mar- later time when the original monu ble slabs which contain them, and ment was destroyed, is a matter of have come down to our time, are the dispute among the learned. original ones, or whether they belong N"], [286, "266 HISTORY OF ROME. the Eomans ; for the Carthaginian Hamilcar took several towns, and killed about 4000 Eomans, and his operations for fortifying what he possessed, as well as for recovering what was lost, were so much to the purpose, that the consul Aquilrius was compelled to confine himself to acting on the defensive. At the same time Eome was threatened by a conspiracy within her own walls, for 4000 Samnites, who had been enlisted for the service of the fleet, were quartered at Bome. There they found many of their own countrymen in slavery, and then sympathies established a bond of union between them : the slaves of other nations also, with all in fact who were thirsting for vengeance, were readily admitted into the conspiracy. Three thousand slaves are said to have thus joined them. Then- intention was to set fire to the city, and rouse the whole slave population to rebellion. But the plot was communicated to the senate by the commander of the Samnites, and the conspiracy was suppressed. The Boman ascendancy in Sicily was also restored, in B.C. 258, by the consul A. Atirius Calatinus. Myttistratum had been besieged by the Eomans for seven months, and the Carthaginian garrison had borne it ; but the inhabitants were dying of hunger, and suffering the most intense misery. The Carthaginians quitted the place, leaving the unfortunate inhabitants to settle their affairs with the Eomans as well as they could. But the latter had no mercy : the town was taken by storm ; nearly all its inhabitants were massacred, and the few survivors had to spend the remainder of then- days in slavery. From Myttistratum the Eomans marched to Camarina; but on their way thither through the mountains, they fell into a danger similar to that into which the Eomans ran, in their first war against the Samnites, and were saved by a similar act of heroism. A tribune of the soldiers, M.

The tribune himself was after wards found bleeding among the corpses of his companions ; but his rife was restored to him. Camarina and Gela were then taken and destroyed, and then- inhabitants put to the sword, or sold as slaves. Enna also surrendered, and the consul appeared before the Carthaginian camp, near Panormus ; but the enemy did not venture to quit it. In the eighth year of the war, b.c 257, nearly one-half of Sicily was still in the hands of the Carthaginians, and the Eomans had only recovered what they had lost. A naval victory, which C. Atilius gained off Tyndaris, gave them fresh hope of bringing to a close the war, in which they were only wasting then strength. Their exertions were immense, and, in B.C. 256, a fleet of 330 Boman quinqueremes, each manned with 300 marines, sailed out under the consuls, L. Manlius and M. Atilius Eegulus, with the intention of crossing over to Africa. The Carthaginians met them with 350 quinqueremes, which carried 150,000 men: it was the greatest naval action that the ancient world had yet seen. The two fleets met each other off Ecnomus. The Carthaginians were commanded by Hamilcar, who had hitherto been the ablest of then generals, and by Hanno. The battle which ensued was decisive and destructive : more than thirty ships of the Carthaginians were sunk, and sixty-four were taken with then crews, while the Eomans lost only twenty four.8 As the consuls were repairing then damaged vessels, in order to sail for Africa, Hanno appeared before them, suing for peace ; but his suit was fruitless. The Boman soldiers left the Sicilian coast with sad forebodings ; but Eegulus, a presumptuous and fool-hardy man, suppressed their murmurs by threats of the severest punishment. Hamilcar and Hanno divided the remain ing part of their fleet, to cruise, and avail themselves of any opportunities that might occur ; but Hanno afterwards altered Iris plan, and made for Carthage. The Eomans landed in Africa, 8 Polyb. i. 26, &c. N 2"], [288, "268 HISTORY OF ROME. in the neighbourhood of the town of Clupea, which, on their approach, was abandoned by its inhabitants, and which the Eomans then occupied as their head-quarters. From this place they made ravaging excursions over the country, which was cultivated like a garden, and covered with splendid villas. The Carthaginians coidd not venture to meet the enemy in the field, as their main army was still in Sicily. The Eomans carried away, as booty, everything they thought worth removing; and a count less multitude of prisoners, and herds of captured cattle were driven to Clupea. At the close of the year, the consul, L. Manlius, returned to Eome, with a portion of the fleet and 27,000 prisoners ; a measure which can scarcely be accounted for, since the senate cannot have been so short-sighted as to think that the army of Eegulus alone would be sufficient to accomplish the reduction of Carthage. Whether Eegulus was obliged to remain in Africa, or whether, as Polybius says,9 it was his own wish to remain there, and bring the war to a close, in order that his successors might not reap the glory of subduing Carthage, is a doubtful question, for our authorities contradict one another ; at any rate, we may here add the remark, that Eegulus is one of the characters who are much overrated in history. He had indeed the Boman virtues of his age ; but he was by no means a great general ; and he enter tained a presumptuous confidence in his own good fortune, for which he had afterwards to atone, to the injury of his country no less than of himself. Early in B.C. 255, Eegulus opened the new campaign, by laying siege to the town of Adis. In the meantime, the Cartha ginians had brought over a part of then- Sicilian army ; but neither then commanders nor their soldiers had any courage, nor did they yet understand the nature of a Eoman war : they therefore withdrew to the mountains, although in the plains their cavalry and elephants might have been used with great effect against the Eomans. Their attempts to relieve Adis, from 9 I. 31."], [289, "269 THE WAR IN AFRICA. their position in the mountains, were useless ; and their infantry was beaten and dispersed. A fearful number of then men are said to have fallen in the battle, and the Carthaginians retreated within the walls of their city. Tunis was taken by Eegulus, and seventy-four other places submitted to him. The Numidians also threw off the dominion of Carthage, and completed the devastation of the country. In this campaign Eegulus is said to have encountered a gigantic serpent on the river Bagradas, which measured 120 feet in length, and attacked and devoured the soldiers. The monster, it is said, could not be overcome until the whole Boman army attacked it.10 Carthage was crowded to excess by the numbers of country people who had taken refuge in the city, and that mass of people began to suffer from famine and diseases. Under these distressing circumstances, the Car thaginians sent an embassy to the Eoman camp, to negotiate for peace. Eegulus now might have concluded the war, and Bome might have been indemnified for the great losses she had aheady sustained ; but Eegulus fancied he held the fate of Carthage in his hands, and he wished to decide it, for fear of its being left to his successor to do so. He therefore demanded of Carthage to give up Sicily and Sardinia, to restore all the Eoman prisoners without ransom, to give a ransom for those who were in the hands of the Eomans, to pay an annual tribute, to recognise the supremacy of Eome, to renounce the right of carrying on any war without the sanction of Eome, to surrender all ships of war with the exception of one, and to support Eome in her military undertakings if she thought fit to ask for such support. To these insolent and exorbitant demands the Carthaginian envoys made no answer, for Carthage was yet too strong to submit to such humiliating terms ; but it would probably have fallen never theless, had it not been saved by the valour and skill of one man, and that man a foreigner, Xanthippus of Sparta. Xanthippus was engaged in the service of the Carthaginian 10 This tale, though it was related cription which Naevius had given of by Livy, is a mere fable, and was pro- the first Punic war. bably derived from the poetical des-"], [290, "270 HISTORY OF ROME. army, though he was probably not a common mercenary : he must have distinguished himself before, and acquired fame in the wars which had been carried on in Greece, or it would be difficult to understand how he could have gained the unlimited confidence of the Carthaginian people, who at this critical moment listened to his advice, and entrusted to him the supreme com mand of then- forces. He pointed out to them that the ignorance and inability of their generals alone was the cause of then mis fortunes. He caused all men capable of bearing arms to be enlisted, and mercenaries to be taken into the service of Car thage from all quarters, and when he had trained the new army outside the city, it became so obvious that the troops were animated by a better spirit through his influence, that fresh hopes of success arose in the minds of the people.11 He taught them the use of elephants in war, with which they seem hitherto to have been unacquainted, and had one hundred of them trained for this campaign. With an army of 14,000 foot and 4000 horse he went out to meet Eegulus, who commanded an army of up wards of 30,000 foot. The Eomans at first despised the bold presumption of the Greek, but the confidence and firmness with which he approached soon began to make them uneasy. A well organized battle was fought, in which the elephants and cavalry decided the victory for the Carthaginians : the whole Boman army was dispersed or annihilated, and Eegulus himself was taken prisoner with 500 men : 30,000 are said to have been killed in the battle ; 2000 only escaped to Clupea. After this victory, Xanthippus had the wisdom to withdraw from the envy and jealousy of the foreign city ; and, honoured with rich presents, he returned to his own country. Ser. Fulvius and M. Aemirius, the consuls of the year, now sailed out with the whole of the Eoman fleet, consisting of at least 300 ships, to Africa, in order to rescue the garrison of Clu pea. The latter had defended themselves most gallantly against the utmost efforts of the Carthaginians, to clear then country 11 Polyb. i. 32."], [291, "THE ROMANS QUIT AFRICA. 271 of the remnant of the hostile army. The Eoman fleet was met by that of Carthage near Cape Hermaeum, and the former won a brilliant victory : 104 Carthaginian ships are said to have been destroyed, and 30 to have been taken with their crews; about 30,000 men perished, while the loss of the Eomans is stated to have been trifling.12 After this victory the consrds sailed to Clupea. Here the Carthaginians are said to have been beaten again, whereby the Eomans were enabled to take on board the garrison, which was aheady suffering from famine. The Eomans then quitted Africa, and sailed along the southern coast of Sicily towards Syracuse. It was about the beginning of July, and the Eoman fleet, which had disregarded the caution of experienced pdots, was overtaken by a storm : one part of the ships were thrown upon the harbourless coast, while the others were swallowed up by the waters. The number of vessels thus lost varies in our authorities between 340 and 220. 13 The whole coast, from Camarina to Pachynus, was covered with wrecks and corpses. Hiero on this occasion acted the part of a true friend to the Eomans, for he provided with food and clothing those who had escaped : the remnants of the fleet assembled at Messana. This great disaster of the Eomans raised the courage of the Carthaginians. They had in the meantime subdued their faith less subjects in Africa; and having learned from Xanthippus a system of tactics which the Eomans were unable to withstand, they sent strong reinforcements to Sicily, one-half of which was still in then possession, and made new conquests. The Eomans in Sicily confined themselves to acting on the defensive in the mountains. As soon as the news of the fearful destruction of the fleet reached Bome, the senate, far from desponding, forthwith decreed the building of a new fleet. Two hundred and twenty ships were completed within the short space of three months, and, in B.C. 254, were conducted to Sicily by the consuls Cn. Cornelius Scipio and A. Atilius Calatinus, with a large number 12 Polyb. i. 36 ; Diodor. Excerpt, xxiii. 14 ; Oros. iv. 9 ; Eutrop. ii. 22. 13 Diodor. /. c. ; Oros. iv. 9."], [292, "272 HISTORY OF ROME. of troops. Panormus was now blockaded, while the Carthaginian general did not dare to leave his quarters near Lilybaeum, and the place was soon taken. After this important conquest, many of the towns, such as Tyndaris and Soloeis, which had hitherto been faithful to Carthage, surrendered to the Eomans ; but the ships which carried the booty to Eome fell into the hands of the Carthaginians. As, however, the conquest of Sicily proceeded but slowly, the consuls of B.C. 252, Cn. Servilius Caepio and C. Sempronius Blaesus, were tempted once more to sail with then whole fleet of 260 ships to Africa. The Carthaginians offered no resistance, and the Eomans laid waste the coast of the Lesser Syrtis ; but they soon discovered the dangers of those gulfs, and it was not without the utmost exertions, and a sacrifice of part of their booty, that they escaped from the Syrtes. They steered towards Panormus, and thence endeavoured to cut across to the coast of Italy. But when they arrived in sight of Cape Palinurus, they were surprised by a fearful storm, in which 150 ships were wrecked, and the booty they had brought from Africa was swallowed up by the waves. This second disaster of the Eomans at sea broke down their courage on that element : the senate resolved that the fleet should not be restored again, and that only sixty ships should be kept for the protection of the Italian coasts, and of the transports which had to be sent to Sicily. But though the Eomans had renounced the sea, they were still able in the same year to conquer Lipara and Thermae, on the north coast of Sicily ; and the Carthaginians were confined to the western corner of the island. In the year following, the Eomans were arrayed against the Carthaginians in the territories of Selinus and Lilybaeum, but not being able to overcome their fear of the elephants, and remembering the fate of Eegulus, they did not venture upon a decisive battle. This backwardness of then enemies induced the Carthaginian general, who had come over with a large army and 130 elephants, to offer battle. The pro-consul, L. Caecirius Metellus, who was encamped, in B.C. 250, in the neighbourhood of Panormus, on the approach of the"], [293, "THE EMBASSY OF REGULUS. 273 enemy retreated close up to the walls of that town, where he had his fortified camp. He managed the battle with great skill, and the Carthaginians were completely defeated : many fell on the field of battle; and others, who endeavoured by swimming to reach the Carthaginian fleet, which was following the movements of the army, perished in the waves. The triumph of Metellus was adorned with a great number of Carthaginian officers of rank, and 104 elephants, which were afterwards killed in the Circus, This was the third great battle that had been fought during the war ; and though the struggle yet lasted for many a year, still it was and remained the last ; for, during the remaining period, we scarcely hear of anything else than sieges, which were conducted in a slow and tedious manner. Sicily, however, which, timing the whole of this war was obliged to keep the armies and fleets of both belligerent parties, and was ravaged by both, was prepared for becoming that wilderness, which was completed in the Hannibalian war, from which it has not recovered to this day. After their defeat at Panormus, the Carthaginians evacuated Selinus, whose inhabitants they carried to then great fortress of Lilybaeum, which, together with Drepana, was now the only place of importance they continued to possess in Sicily. Their late defeat, and the progress of the Eomans in the island, induced the Carthaginians to send an embassy to Bome with proposals of peace, or at least of an exchange of prisoners. Eegulus, who had now been then- prisoner for nearly five years, went with the ambassadors, under a promise that he would return into captivity if he could not prevail upon his countrymen to accede to the wishes of Carthage. He was permitted to be present at the discussion in the senate, and he there objected to the peace no less vehemently than to the exchange of the prisoners : he preferred his honour and his oath to all the enticements of his friends to remain behind ; and in order to remove all temptations, he pretended that a slow poison had been administered to him, which would soon end his days. He then withdrew from the n 3"], [294, "274 HISTORY OF ROME. embraces of his friends, and returned to Carthage, where he is said to have been put to death with the most cruel tortures. This stoiy of the embassy of Eegulus, which has become more cele brated than any other, through poets and orators, is quite devoid of historical foundation. Polybius, the most ancient and trust worthy among the writers on those times, knows nothing of it ; and it is in all probability a mere fiction, devised partly to honour the unfortunate man, partly to raise a hatred against the Carthaginians, or to justify the cruel treatment which some Carthaginian prisoners, who were given over to the family of Eegulus, experienced at the hands of his friends.14 The captivity of Eegulus camiot be doubted, but he had deserved his fate by his overbearing conduct, and his hard-heartedness, with which he had treated the humbled enemy in the days of his glory. His return to Carthage, even supposing it to be an historical fact, was no more than his duty ; and if he had reason to fear, it was only his own fault. Eome rejected the proposed peace, because she had resolved not to lay down her arms until all Sicily should be subdued. Hence the consids of B.C. 250, C. Atilius and L. Manlius Vulso, went to Sicily with four legions and a large number of allied troops. Then success at Panormus had so much raised the comage of the Eomans, that the senate ordered a new fleet of 200 ships to be built without delay. The consuls, with then army, laid siege to Lilybaeum, which was fortified by every means of which the art of fortification was then capable. It was sur rounded by the Eomans from sea to sea with a strong line of for tifications, and the Boman fleet, which cruised before its harbour, guarded the entrance to it : they afterwards endeavoured even to block it up by sinking a number of ships, in order to cut off all communication between the fortress and Carthage. The faithless mercenaries, to whom the defence was entrusted, would have sold 14 Zonar. viii. 15 ; Diodor. Fragm. 598, &c, Lectures on Rom. Hist. lib. xxiv. p. 566, ed.

The latter in the meantime conducted the siege with considerable success ; but a bold Carthaginian admiral, of the name of Hanni bal, kept up the communication between Carthage and Lilybaeum by making his way through the Eoman fleet, and, to the great consternation of the Eomans, he succeeded in introducing rein forcements into the place, amid the joyous shouts of the distressed inhabitants. This success emboldened the besieged to make a sally, but it failed, notwithstanding their great exertions. How ever, what men could not accomplish, was soon after achieved by a storm, which blew in the direction of the Eoman camp. As the camp was full of combustible materials, the besieged, during the storm, threw fire into it, which caused a conflagration, con suming all the engines, towers, and galleries of the Eomans. After this loss the Eomans confined themselves to blockading the town, in order to compel it by hunger to surrender, for the besieged were suffering from scarcity, in consequence of which epidemic diseases broke out among them. Then- fleet was still stationed near the entrance of the harbour, while that of Carthage was in the harbour of Drepana. The Eomans still made very great efforts, and in B.C. 249, the consul, P. Claudius Pulcher, led a supplementary army to Sicily. His presumption and fool-hardiness cost the republic the rives of thousands, about whom he, a true Claudian, was little concerned. On his arrival near the harbour of Drepana, he endeavoured early in the morning, and contrary to the auspices which he despised, to enter the harbour and take the enemy by surprise ; but the Carthaginian admiral, Adherbal, had been very watchful, and as the enemy's fleet was entering, he led his ships into the sea in a long hne on the opposite side of the entrance. Claudius soon discovered that he was thwarted, and ordered his ships to retreat, but it was too late \u25a0 and the Carthaginians, making use of the"], [296, "276 HISTORY OF ROME. confusion and hurry, cut off the retreat of the Eomans. Ninety three ships of the latter were destroyed or taken, and only 30 escaped with the consul.15 This victory of the Carthaginians was a very easy one, and then loss was quite insignificant. They now recovered their ascendancy in Sicily, while at Eome the most vehement indignation burst forth against the presumptuous con sul. The senate ordered him to appoint a dictator, and then to lay down his dignity and give an account of his conduct. Clau dius, who scorned the command of the senate, had the insolence to appoint M. Glycias, the son of a freedman, to the dictatorship. The Eomans could not endure this insult : they deprived the un worthy man of his honour ; and in his place A. Atilius Calatinus was made dictator. Claudius himself was charged with high treason against the people ; but whether he was punished, or escaped on account of a thunder-storm, which, according to some, broke out during the assembly, and thus stopped the proceedings, is uncertain. He does not, however, appear to have long sur vived his disgrace ; and it is probable that he made away with himself. During this period of the war, the Eoman generals were below mediocrity, while those of the Carthaginians, even before the ap pearance of the great Hamilcar on the scene of action, far surpassed then opponents, who now had only the advantage of better soldiers than the mercenaries of the enemy. The Carthaginians followed up then victory at Drepana with great energy. Hannibal took the Eoman provision-ships from the harbour of Panormus, and sent them to Lilybaeum ; while Carthalo destroyed the greater part of the remaining Eoman fleet, and then made predatory excursions on the coasts of Italy and Sicily. In the same year another great disaster happened to the Eomans. The consul, C. Junius, the colleague of Claudius, had arrived with sixty ships near Messana, and there joined the remainder of the Boman fleet. As the army at Lilybaeum was greatly suffering from want, he assembled, partly at Messana, and partly at Syracuse, a large convoy of 800 10 Polyb. i. 51 ; Eutrop. ii. 26 ; comp. Diodor. Excerpt, xxiv. 1."], [297, "277 LOSSES OF THE ROMANS AT SEA. transports to provide for the wants of the army. A detachment of this convoy was sent out in advance, under the protection of a part of the fleet, while the consul remained behind at Syracuse. Carthalo, the Carthaginian admiral, pursuing these, destroyed a large number of the transports, and seventeen ships of war. He then withdrew into the river Halycus to wait for the other detachment, which was commanded by the consul himself, who, when the Carthaginians came out of the river to meet him, fled towards the coast of Camarina. A storm was threatening, and the Carthaginians got into a safe place, while C. Junius, neglect ing the approaching danger, prepared his own destmetion. He lost all Iris ships of war, with the exception of two, and all his transports were dashed to pieces. The greater part of the crews, however, were saved, and with these he joined the land army, endeavouring to cover his loss with the conquest of Eryx, the only one that Eome made in that year. He had, like Claudius, despised the warning of the auspices, and was likewise accused before the people, but he withdrew from condemnation by going into voluntary exile. The successive misfortunes which the Eomans had now suf fered induced them a second time to renounce all maritime war fare, and to confine themselves to a few ships. The Carthaginians being now the sole masters of the sea, Carthalo, in B.C. 248, landed in various parts of the coast of Italy, and avenged the sufferings of Africa by ravaging the country.16 But as all these advantages could not restore the exhausted resources of Carthage, an attempt was made to borrow a large sum of money of king Ptolemy Phikdelphus of Egypt, who however refused to comply with the request of Carthage, for he wished to remain neutral.17 In these difficult circumstances, the great Hamilcar, surnamed Barca, that is, Lightning, undertook the supreme command of the Carthaginian forces. He must then have been about the age of thirty : he began his operations with an unparalleled boldness, for he was a true military genius, and worthy to be the father of 16 Zonar. viii. 16; Oros. iv. 10. \"Appian,iSJ(*uZ. p. 92,ed.Schweigh."], [298, "278 HISTORY OF ROME. Hannibal. He first tamed the rebellious mercenaries by severe discipline, and then sailed out to plunder the coasts of Bruttium and Locri. On his return in B.C. 247, he landed at Panormus, while the consuls, L. Caecilius Metellus and N. Fabius Buteo, were continuing the siege of Lilybaeum and Drepana with sepa rate armies. Hamilcar took his position on mount Hercte (the modem Monte Pelegrino), where he maintained himself as in a fortress for a period of three years, making occasional ravaging excursions upon the coast of Italy as far as Cumae in Campania. No great battle was sought during those three years, although the hostile armies were often arrayed against each other, and con stantly in great activity ; but Hamilcar completely paralysed the Eomans, and never lost an opportunity of injuring them. His object was to wear Eome out, and gradually to form an army so well disciplined, that Bome should not be able to resist it in the field. After the third year he seems to have abandoned his ori ginal plan, for he left Hercte and took possession of the town of Eryx. In this town, which was situated on a mountain, and from which the communication with the sea was much more difficult than from Hercte, he was blockaded by the Eomans. The mer cenaries who had served under him were filled with so great a degree of admiration of him, that no one ventured to undertake anything against him. We cannot enter here into a detailed account of the petty but bloody engagements which took place during this period ; but we shall relate an anecdote which shows the great and amiable character of Hamilcar. In B.C. 243, the consul, C. Fundanius, fought a battle against him. Hamilcar was defeated through the faidt of his officers, and many of his men were slain. He sent to the conqueror to ask for a truce during which he might bury his dead. Fimdanius haughtily replied, that he ought to be concerned about the living rather than about the dead. A short time afterwards another battle was fought, in which many of the Eomans fell. When Hamil car was asked to allow the dead to be buried, he willingly con sented to do so, saying that he carried on war only against the"], [299, "END OF THE FIRST PUNIC WAR. 279 living.18 Tlris answer, which was no doubt the sincere expres sion of Iris feelings, must have put the Boman to the blush. The Eomans had by this time become convinced that the war could not be brought to a close without some extraordinary ex ertions, and in B.C. 242, it was decreed for the third time to build a fleet. As, however, the republic did not possess the means required for it, loans were contracted with wealthy citizens for budding and equipping a fleet of 200, or, according to others, 300 ships. The money thus advanced was to be repaid if the war should turn out favourably. The command of this fleet was undertaken by the consul, C. Lutatius Catulus, and the praetor, O. Valerius Falto. The Eoman ships were now much better than they had been at first : the maritime towns of Italy also were now in a condition to furnish better sailors than they had done before ; and it seems that the Eomans had no longer any occasion to make use of boarding bridges. The Cartha ginian fleet, on the other hand, had been neglected from want of means, whence the great exertions which Carthage made at last were not sufficient. Lutatius Catulus first made an attack upon Drepana, which was nearly taken, but he received a severe wound which prevented his continuing his operations. A Carthaginian convoy of provisions and reinforcements was sent to Lilybaeum, Drepana, and Eryx, and this fleet arrived at the Aegatian islands. The Carthaginians wanted to take Hamilcar and the best of his soldiers on board, before venturing upon an open sea-fight. The Eomans, who were cruising along the coast, would have lost everything if they had allowed the enemy to carry out his plan ; they therefore resolved upon attacking the Carthaginians, who accepted the battle. But, owing to then ships being heavily laden with corn, and to the bad condition of then- fleet which con- sisted in part of old ships and had been got up in too great a hurry, the Eomans gained an easy but complete victory : 63 Carthaginian ships were taken, 120 were sunk, and the rest dispersed ; 14,000 men were killed, and 32,000 taken prisoners. 18 Diodor. Fragm. Vatic, p. 60, ed. Dindorf."], [300, "280 HISTORY OF ROME. This victory, which decided the issue of the war, was gained on the 10th of March, B.C. 241. Another victory was gained soon after at Eryx, which fell into the hands of the Eomans. The Carthaginians now, being totally unable to equip a new fleet, sued for peace ; and the negotiations were conducted by Hamilcar, who submitted to the humiliating terms only from necessity, as surely not despairing that a day would come in which he might take vengeance on his now victorious enemy. The conditions on which peace was concluded were as follows \u25a0 The Carthaginians were to evacuate Sicily, and all the islands between Sicily and Italy ; to abstain from war with Hiero and his allies ; to restore all Boman prisoners without ransom ; and to pay 200 Euboean talents by twenty yearly instalments. The last point was altered by the Boman people, before whom the peace was brought to be sanctioned, to the effect that Carthage should pay 1000 talents more, and that the number of yearly instahnents should be reduced to ten.19 This peace terminated the first Bunic war in the twenty-fourth year after its commencement. It had been conducted with the most immense exertions by both parties, and the losses which the two states had sustained were prodigious. Eome had lost 700 ships of war, and Carthage 500 ; from which we may infer the number of men that were killed or led into slavery : a much larger number still must have perished in the battles, and by hunger and epidemics. Eome might derive new strength from her allies, and she was yet full of that vital principle herself which was ever capable of fresh renovation ; hence she felt her losses and misfortunes less than Carthage, who had aheady fallen from her ancient greatness, and was obliged to entrust her safety to foreign mercenaries. The dominion which Eome had acquired over Sicily and the Mediterranean paved the way for new conquests ; and it soon became manifest that the national hatred between the two republics, which had only been nourished and increased by the long and bloody war, and the overweening 10 Polyb. i. 62, 63 ; comp. iii. 27; Zonar. viii. 17 ; Oros. iv. 11."], [301, "SICILY THE FIRST PROVINCE. 281 assumption of Eome could not allow the peace to last much longer than was necessary for both parties to gather strength for a new struggle. As Sicily was a distinct country by itself, the Eomans resolved to give it a constitution different from that adopted in the case of the conquered nations in Italy . they made Sicily a Boman province (provincia 20), that is, a country out of Italy which had lost its sovereignty, and was under the administration of a Boman governor, who was sent thither every year with the title of praetor, or pro-consul, and had supreme civil as well as military power, (potestas and imperiuni). The governor was assisted in his administration by quaestors, and a train of other officials. The Boman state was in reality the owner of the land contained in a province ; or, at least, the provincials were not the owners of the soil according to the Eoman law, and they were allowed to con tinue in the possession of it only on condition of their paying to Eome a certain amount of taxes, namely, the tenth of wine, oil, olives, and other products of the soil. This tax was let in farm by the censors at Eome, either to Eomans or wealthy Sicilians. Some portions of a province, however, might remain the property of the provincials, who had then to pay a land-tax, from which all land in Italy was exempt. The provincials generally did not serve in the Eoman armies, (for they were usually deprived of then arms :) whenever they did serve, it was only as auxiliaries, and never as allies of Eome. It must, however, be observed, that not all the towns of Sicily were reduced to this condition, for the kingdom of Hiero, the towns of Messana, Tauromenium, and Netum, became civitates foederatae, and retained their territories as independent states. Panormus, Segesta, Centoripa, and others, became liberae civi- tates, that is, they had not to pay any taxes (decimae) to Eome. 20 The etymology of the word pro- vincia is very uncertain ; the ancients derived it from pro and vincere in the sense of \" to push forward,\" or \" to drive before one \" ; Niebuhr connects it with proventus, according to which it would mean \" a country paying a tax to the ruling state\" ; another more probable origin of the word seems to be to regard it as a contraction of pro videntia, so that it would be \" a couu try entrusted to the care of some one.\""], [302, "282 HISTORY OF ROME. A country which had once become a Eoman province gradually fell into decay ; for a number of wealthy strangers or Boman speculators usually settled in it, and purchased the lands at reduced prices. Hence the number of landowners in Sicily was fearfully small in the time of Cicero ; and those few, who had accumulated all the land, had it cultivated by hordes of slaves, while the free inhabitants were reduced to abject poverty. Such a state of things accounts for the direful servile wars, which in later times broke out in Sicily. With the exception of the transitory revolt in Samnium, all the Italians had been perfectly quiet during the long period of the flrst Punic war, a fact which was mainly the consequence of the wise moderation with which Bome treated her Italian subjects ; though then weak state, and the fear of the Carthaginians, who surely wordd not have been very lenient riders, may likewise have contributed to keep the Italians quiet. During this period we hear little of constitutional changes, because there was little room for any. In B.C. 253, Tib. Coruncanius was the first plebeian who obtained the office of pontifex maximus, and he at once proved to be a more distinguished person than any that had held the office before.21 After the increase of the number of quaestors, which had taken place shortly before the outbreak of the war, the election of new members of the senate was no longer left to the discretion of the censors, for as vacancies occurred, they were filled up with those who had been quaestors ; and as the quaestors were elected by the people, the senate may be said at this time to have consisted of wealthy persons nominated by the people, for none but wealthy persons could hope to obtain any of the higher magistracies ; wealth having now acquired the influence which formerly belonged to birth only. Down to the beginning of the first Punic war, the Eoman republic had every year paid the sum of 500 minae to defray the expenses of the public festivals and games,22 but from that time forward the aediles were obliged to 21 Liv.

This change, therefore, was one of the highest importance, and exercised no small influ ence upon the future condition of the republic. In B.C. 243, a second praetor was appointed, probably on account of the neces sity of keeping a reserve army in Italy, to prevent the enemy from landing on the coasts, which were no longer protected by a fleet. In B.C. 264, Eome saw the first gladiatorial exhibition ; it was presented by D. Junius Brutus at the exequies of his father. How much those games, which afterwards became one of the principal amusements of the Eomans, contributed to debase and brutarise their national taste and character, it will require no explanation to conceive."], [304, "284 CHAPTEE XVI. DISTRESS OF CARTHAGE, AND ITS LOSS OF SARDINIA WARS AGAINST THE ILLYRIANS, LIGURIANS, AND GAULS THE CARTHAGINIANS IN SPAIN\u2014 THE SAGUNTINE WAR. The peace with Carthage had scarcely been concluded when the inhabitants of Falerii rose against Eome (b.c 241); but this senseless revolt of a single town against the city that had just acquired the dominion of Sicily, and had humbled the power of Carthage, was put down within six days, and a large number of Fariscans had to pay for their fool-hardiness with then- lives. Eome, however, was in a state of great exhaustion ; for though she had not seen the enemy in her own territory, still the expen diture of such immense sums of money, with the loss of no less than 700 ships, was felt very severely. She therefore required time to recover her strength, and it was probably not without satisfaction that she witnessed the new disasters which befel Carthage immediately after the peace. It has aheady been remarked that the armies of Carthage consisted mainly of mercenaries : when the troops returned to Africa, after the evacuation of Sicily, Carthage was unable to pay the arrears due to these clamorous hordes, which consisted of persons from all parts of the ancient world. The insurgents were stirred up and encouraged by the Italian deserters, who dreaded nothing more than to be delivered up to the Eomans. One of these deserters, Spendius, a Campanian, made himself particularly conspicuous, and was one of the leaders of the insur gents. This intestine war was carried on with the greatest cruelty and brutality on both sides, and Carthage was brought to"], [305, "CARTHAGE AND HER MERCENARIES. 285 the brink of destruction, for at times its whole dominion was confined within its walls and fortifications, all the surrounding country being in the hands of the rebels. The Carthaginian sub jects in Africa, and even the Punic towns of Utica and Hippo, likewise revolted, for they were unable to bear the heavy burdens that were imposed upon them. Utica went so far as to offer to place itself under the protection of Eome ; but the Eomans were generous and honourable enough to refuse this protectorate \u2014 a conduct forming a strange contrast to the faithlessness with which they acted towards Carthage a short time after. This internal or African war, which lasted for three years and four months,1 was brought to a close by the great Hamilcar Barca, who was aided in suppressing and destroying the rebels, partly by their own acts of barbarous cruelty, and partly by the gene rous conduct of the Eomans, who declined having any dealings with them, and protected the provisions which were conveyed to Carthage. During this war in Africa, the Carthaginian mercenaries in Sardinia likewise revolted, and massacred the Carthaginian colo nists in the island. The natives of Sardinia, however, rose against the mercenaries, and drove them from the island. These men threw themselves into the arms of the Eomans, who eagerly seized the opportunity of making a new conquest, and in B.c. 238 took possession of Sardinia. The natives, perhaps stirred up by the Carthaginians, opposed the Eomans, and con tinued their hostilities for many years, with one short interruption in b.c 235, during which the temple of Janus at Eome was closed. When, after the close of the African war, the Carthaginians attempted to chastise the rebellious mercenaries of Sardinia, they were treated by the Eomans as if they were attempting to com mit acts of hostility towards Eome, and, being not yet prepared to renew the struggle with her, were obliged to yield : Carthage lost the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, in both of which islands 1 Polyb. i. 88 ; comp. Liv. xxi. 2. erroneously states that it lasted four Diodorus (xxv. 1, Eclog. p. 510) years and four months."], [306, "286 HISTORY OF ROME. however the natives manfully continued to defend their liberty, and further was obliged to pay to Eome a contribution of 1200 talents. This perfidious conduct of Eome, who thus took advan tage of the unfortunate condition of a rival republic, was contrary to all law and conscience, aud such as to warrant the conclusion, that the generosity displayed during the African war must have arisen from some selfish motives. Eome's treachery excited the highest indignation at Carthage, and great efforts were made to recover strength for a new contest with her. Hamilcar was the soul of the undertaking : he devoted all his energies to the raising of his country, and successfully endeavoured to render it fit one day again to take the field against its unprincipled and treacherous oppressors. In the year in which the Eomans took possession of Sardinia and Corsica, they had to carry on a war against the Ligurians and Boians, which continued for several years along with that against the natives of Sardinia and Corsica : that against the Ligurians continued for several years longer still. For nearly half a century the Cisalpine Gauls had been quiet, either because they were not disturbed by any fresh immigration from the north, or because they rested satisfied in the belief that the Eomans had forgotten them. But their tranquillity was disturbed in B.C. 232, by the carrjing into effect the agrarian law of the tribune C. Flaminius, in despite of the most vehement opposition of the aristocratical party. His law - enacted, that the lands which had been taken from the Gauls in the last war with them, and had come into the hands of the Eomans as a wilder ness, should be distributed among the Eoman citizens ; and a number of Eomans accordingly settled in those districts. This circumstance is said to have made the Gauls uneasy, and thev commenced negotiations with then- Transalpine kinsmen, among whom great movements were going on at the time ; but several - This law was a plebiscitum, which instance of the kind that occurs in acquired the force of law without a Eoman history. \u2014 Cic.

The negotiations with the Transalpine Gauls, however, created very great apprehensions at Eome. In B.C. 229, while Bome was still engaged in the war against the Ligurians, she became involved in another with the Illy rians inhabiting the countries which at present form the south of Dalmatia and the north of Albania, and which were then governed by a princess of the name of Teuta. Her husband and predecessor, Agron, had extended his dominion over a part of Epirus, over Corcyra, Epidamnus, ApoUonia, and Pharus, and his subjects had become formidable as pirates in the Adriatic and Ionian seas. After his death his widow, Teuta, had undertaken the government, in the name of her son Pinneus, who was not of age. The Illyrian pirates had plundered, among others, vessels belonging to Italian merchants, and had carried off the men as captives. The Eoman senate sent ambassadors to niyricum, to demand reparation. Queen Teuta answered, she would take care that in future no public injury should be done to the Eoman people by her subjects ; but that she could not prevent then carrying on piracy, which was a national custom of the Illyrians, and from which they derived their means of living. The noble aud bold answer of one of the ambassadors, that it was the custom of Bome to punish in the name of the republic any private wrong, and to give succour to those who were injured, and that the bad custom of the Illyrians must be done away with, exasperated the queen so much, that, after the departure of the ambassadors, she despatched assassins who slew them. As soon as this violation of the law of nations became known at Eome, war was declared against the Illyrians : the consuls of B.C. 229 were sent out with an army, and a fleet of 200 ships, and landed on the Illyrian coast. The enemy, though attacked in his own country, made but little resistance ; many towns were taken, and several Illyrian tribes were reduced to submission. The Greek towns, which had been under the dominion of the Hlyrians, placed themselves under the protec-"], [308, "288 HISTORY OF ROME. tion of Eome ; and even Demetrius of Pharus, an Illyrian noble, who had the command of the Illyrian garrison at Corcyra and Pharus, treacherously went over to the Eomans. In the year following, Teuta sent an embassy to Eome, and concluded a peace, in which the Eomans took from her a part of her domi nions, imposed a tribute upon her, and compelled her to promise to put an end to the piracy of her subjects. The Illyrians were further commanded not to keep more than two unarmed vessels. Demetrius was rewarded by the Eomans for his treachery with some districts of land, and the possession of Pharus ; but as he did not think his services sufficiently acknowledged, he again began, in conjunction with other Illyrians, to carry on piratical practices, and in the course of his expeditions proceeded as far as the Cyckdes, whereby he afterwards caused the outbreak of a second Illyrian war. In this manner the Eomans became the real benefactors of the islands and maritime towns of Greece, which had suffered greatly fi-om the Illyrian pirates. Up to this time the Eomans never seem to have entertained the thought of crossing the Adriatic, or extending then dominion over the countries to the east of it ; but different ideas seem now to have possessed then minds. It is surprising to observe how anxious they were to court the friendship of the Greeks, and it would seem that they felt a pride in being noticed by them, for embassies were sent to Athens and to Corinth. The former city honoured the Eomans with its friendship, and the right of isopolity, and allowed them to become initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries, while Corinth conferred upon them the right of taking part in the Isthmian games.3 The time was now approaching when the Boians, who thought themselves injured by the settlement of the Eomans in then immediate vicinity, were enabled to take active measures to pre vent then further advancing into then territory. They had formed affiances with the Tauriscans and the Insubrians, in the country about Milan, and were joined by many other Celtic 3 Polyb. ii. 12 ; Zonar. viii. 19."], [309, "ITALY INVADED BY THE GAULS. 289 tribes, which are known to us under the name of Gaesatae.4 Hosts of these Gaesatae came across the Alps in B.C. 226, and invaded Italy ; and the intelligence of their arrival filled the Eomans with very great alarm. The most extraordinary pre parations were made to meet these enemies, for the fears and apprehensions of Eome were even greater than afterwards when Hannibal descended from the Alps. A general levy was made throughout Italy, and every one was ready to take up arms, as all looked with horror upon the invasion of these northern bar barians. An army was raised which amounted to 300,000 men, and according to others even to 800,000. There was a prophecy current at Bome that the city should be taken by the Gauls and Greeks; and when the books of fate were consulted, the Eomans were enjoined to bury alive in the forum boarium two Gauls and two Greeks : 5 by this sacrifice they hoped to satisfy Fate, and to avert the impending calamity. The consul L. Aemilius Papus was sent with an army to Ariminum, his colleague C. Atilius being still engaged in Sardinia, and a corps of reserve was stationed in Etruria. The Gauls unconcerned about the army at Ariminum marched into Etruria, ravaged the country, and advanced as far as Clusium, a distance of only three days' journey from Eome. Here they learned that the Eoman army, which had to protect Etruria, was following then traces. The Gauls immediately turned round to meet the enemy ; but in the night following, they left then cavalry behind and marched in a different direc tion. The next morning the Eomans, who fancied that the bar barians had taken to flight, pursued the cavalry ; but the Gallic infantry, which had been lying in ambush, now rushed forward and offered battle. The Eomans lost a large number of men, and took refuge on an eminence where they were besieged by the enemy. The blockade however was conducted very carelessly, as the Gauls thought they were sure of then prey. But after 4 Probably from the Celtic gaesum, cenaries : 5ta to fiicrdoij o-rpa.Tt\\mv. a spear or javelin, though Polybius s Plut. Marcell. 3; Oios. iv. 13.

Aemffius had heard of the enemy's invasion of Etruria, and of then proceedings there, he hastened tothe assistance of his countrymen. He succeeded in rescuing the Eoman army from its perilous position, and the Gaids withdrew along the sea-coast, in order to carry then- booty into a safe place. Aemffius followed them, but did not venture to attack them. In the meantime the other consul, C. Atilius, had landed at Pisa with his army from Sardinia, and when he learned that the Gauls were not far off, and that they were pursued by his colleague, he at once attacked them. A most destructive battle was fought : the Gauls, being pressed between two armies, lost the greater part of then infantry, and the cavalry took to flight : about 40,000 Gaids are said to have fallen in the battle, and 10,000 were taken prisoners. The year after this battle, B.C. 224, the two consuls took the field against the Gauls, and compelled the Boians to submit to Eome. In that year the Eoman legions for the first time crossed the river Po, and carried on the war against the Insubrians, who being supported by the Transalpine Gaids defended themselves very gallantly in their unprotected country. But in B.C. 223, the consul C. Flaminius gained a great victory over them. He fought the battle against the will of the senate ; for the consuls of that year, some said, had not been elected hi due form, and while he was arrayed against the enemy, a letter from the senate arrived in the camp, summoning him and his colleague to come back to Bome ; but Flaminius left the letter unopened until the battle was fought, and when afterwards he read its contents, he still refused to return. The agrarian law, which he had carried in his tribuneship, was a point which the senatorial party had never forgiven him ; and he may have had reason to dread then machinations and intrigues. When at length he complied with the command of the senate, both he and his colleague were obliged to lay down then office. The war against the Gauls and Insubrians was brought to its close in the year after by the brave consul, M. Claudius Marcellus, who slew Viridomarus, the leader of the Gauls, with his own hand, hi the battle of"], [311, "SECOND ILLYRIAN WAR. 291 Clastidium. After this defeat the Gauls sued for peace, which was granted them on condition of their acknowledging the sove reignty of Eome. By this peace the Eomans became masters of the whole plain of Lombardy, which they called Gaffia Cisal pina, and afterwards Gaffia Togata ; and in order to secure then new acquisitions, they established the colonies of Cremona and Placentia : it is not improbable that Mutina was founded and fortified about the same time. In the year B.c. 219, the faithless conduct of Demetrius of Pharus gave rise to the second Illyrian war. He had ceased to fear the Eomans, because he thought them sufficiently engaged with the Gauls ; and he not only renewed the piratical practices of the niyrians as far as the Aegean sea, but even attempted to make himself master of those towns which were under the pro tection of Bome. The Eomans, therefore, sent the consul, L. Aemffius Paulus, with an army to Ulyricum. He took Pharus without any difficulty, and subdued the whole of Ulyricum, after which he returned to Eome in triumph. Demetrius took refuge at the court of Philip of Macedonia, with whom he spent the remainder of his life, and used his influence to stir him up against the Eomans, whereby he prepared the way for future events. While the Eomans were thus engaged in wars with the Sar dinians, Corsicans, Ligurians, Gauls, and Illyrians, the Cartha ginians had been making the most strenuous efforts to recover then strength, and to establish in some other quarter the power they had lost in Sicriy and Sardinia. Hamilcar Barca was the man who conceived and carried into effect the wise plan of raising a Carthaginian empire in Spain ; for Spain was a country which, in the course of a little time, might, by wise management, become so united with Carthage, as to enable her to obtain national armies, one of the main things of which she was in want ; and, besides this, it offered advantages which would never have been derived from Sicily or Sardinia. Up to this time the Car thaginians had possessed only a small portion of the Spanish o 2"], [312, "292 HISTORY OF ROME. coast, but Hamilcar's plan now was to subdue the Spaniards, and then, by winning then- affection, to change them gradually into a Punic nation. With this object in view he treated them kindly, and put no obstacles in the way of marriages between Carthagi nian men and Spanish women. He had come to Spain, B.C. 238, immediately after the close of the African war ; and he conducted the administration of the country with extraordinary wisdom, opening new resources for Carthage by introducing a regular working of the silver mines in Spain. On his death in B.C. 229, he left the command to Hasdrubal, his son-in-law. The latter followed the same system as his predecessor, and founded the town of New Carthage (Carthagena). The Eomans were at this time apprehending the invasion of the Gauls ; and in order to secure themselves against any aggression on the part of the Car thaginians, they concluded, in B.C. 228, a treaty with Hasdrubal, in which they recognised the right of Carthage to rule over or make conquests in all Spain beyond the river Poems (Ebro), but stipulated that she shoidd not cross that river. 6 Hasdrubal had the command in Spain for a period of eight years : he was assassi nated in B.C. 221, when he was succeeded by Hannibal, the son of Hamilcar Barca, who, when a boy of nine years, had sworn eternal enmity to the Eomans, and was now about twenty-six years old. Hannibal was one of the greatest generals, not only of anti quity but of all ages; and no less great as a statesman in times of peace, than at the head of his armies. The character which Livy has drawn of him is unfair: the charge of inhumanity or cruelty is expressly contradicted by Polybius, and of his alleged faithless ness not a single instance is known. He was a man of cultivated mind, and during his leisure hours, intelligent and learned Greeks were his favourite companions. He also seems like his father 6 Polyb. ii. 13, iii. 27.

Immediately after he had undertaken the administration of Spain, he made war against the Olcades, and afterwards upon the Vaccaeans and Carpetanians, by whose subjugation the Cartha ginians became masters of Spain as far as the river Iberus, with the exception of the town of Saguntum. His next operations were directed against that town, by interfering in its disputes with its neighbours. The Saguntines, who were well aware of his object, applied to Eome for assistance ; and while the senate was resolving to send ambassadors to Spain for the purpose of looking into the affairs of Saguntum, which was certainly allied with Eome, Hannibal had commenced the siege of the place, B.c. 219. 7 The ambassadors were now forthwith sent to Spain, to call upon Hannibal to abstain from hostilities towards Saguntum, or, if they should be unable to effect this, to cross over into Africa and demand of the Carthaginian government the sur render of Hannibal. When the ambassadors arrived in Spain, Hannibal continued the siege without listening to them, and they accordingly went to Carthage. But there they met with no better success. The Saguntines in the meantime defended themselves with truly heroic valour, and it was not till the eighth month after the commencement of the siege that the town was taken by assault. It was razed to the ground.3 Hannibal, with immense booty, withdrew to New Carthage, and made the necessary pre parations for his invasion of Italy. Another embassy was sent to Carthage, but it was received in 7 Livy (xxi. 6) places the beginning Saguntum ; and ruins of the Roman of the siege in b.c 218, inconsequence Saguntum are still visible near the of which he is obliged to assign to this town of Murviedro, which in fact year events which must have occupied derives its name from those ruins at least eighteen months.

The Carthaginians were divided by political parties, and could not come to any reso- lution ; they were neither willing to admit that they had violated any treaty, nor to surrender Hannibal : one of the ambassadors, Q. Fabius, then made a fold of his toga, as if he was carrying something in it, and said, \" Here we bring you peace and war; choose whichever you please.\" The leader of the Carthaginian senate replied, \" Give us whichever you think proper.\" Fabius then unfolded his toga and said, \" Well, then, I offer you war ;\" and the Punic senators answered, \" We accept it, and shall carry it on in the same spirit in which we accept it.\" The Eoman ambassadors hereupon quitted Carthage forthwith : on then way home they endeavoured to gain over the Spaniards and Gauls, but their proposals were scorned and rejected. Thus the second Punic war was decreed, to which the Sagun tine war forms only a prelude. Down to the time when Hannibal began the siege of Saguntum the Eomans had acted the part of mere spectators, but the storm which had been gathering in the distant horizon was now on the point of unloading itself upon the fair plains of Italy."], [315, "295 CHAFTEE XVII. THE SECOND PUNIC, OR THE HANNIBALIAN WAR \u2014 CONDITION OF ROME AND ITALY AFTER THE WAR. The taking of Saguntum was indeed the occasion, but by no means the cause of the second Punic war ; for this must be sought in the deep exasperation of the Carthaginians against Eome, which had been fostered by Hamilcar, Hannibal, and the patriotic party at Carthage. The aristocratic party was, indeed, willing to sacrifice Hannibal for the purpose of maintaining peace with Bome ; but the popular feeling, and the influence of what Livy calls the Barcine faction, were too strong, and overruled the opposition. Eome, on the other hand, would have been glad if the outbreak of the war could have been delayed for some time, for the Gauls were as yet scarcely reduced to submission, and the Illyrian war, which was brought about in B.C. 219 by the conduct of Demetrius of Pharus, could not incline Eome to engage in a fresh contest with Carthage. But it seems to have been these very circumstances which made Hannibal all the more anxious not to defer carrying into effect Iris plans. The principal scenes of this war, which Livy calls the most memorable that was ever carried on, and which lasted for seven teen years, from B.C. 218 to B.C. 201, were Italy, Spain, Sicily, and at last Africa. The war itself, in order to be properly un derstood, must be divided into five periods \u2014 1.

Hannibal's last years in Italy down to its evacuation, from B.C. 207 to B.C. 202. And, lastly, 5. The conclusion of the war in Africa, down to the peace in B.C. 201. \u2014 The war in Spain began simultaneously with that in Italy, but was decided in favour of Eome in B.C. 210 by the taking of New Carthage, though the war continued down to B.C. 206. The Sicilian war, from B.C. 215 to B.C. 210, forms only an episode to the great and bloody drama. The Macedonian war, which arose out of that against Hannibal, in B.C. 214, was carried on along with that against Hannibal, but an account of it will be given in a separate chapter. After the war had been decreed, Hannibal assembled his troops in the neighbourhood of New Carthage. The soldiers were attached to him in the highest degree, for his appearance reminded the veterans of his father Hamilcar. He acted with extraordinary caution, for while he enlisted great numbers of Spaniards to accompany him in his expedition, he sent others to Africa, where they had to serve as garrisons, and might be kept as a kind of hostages for the fidelity of then countrymen. After intrusting the command in Spain to his brother Hasdrubal, he crossed the Iberus, in the beginning of the summer * of the year B.C. 218, with an army of 90,000 foot, 12,000 horse, and 37 elephants. The Spanish tribes which were under the protec tion of Bome offered little resistance, and he crossed the Pyrenees, not far from the sea, where the mountains slope down towards the coast, a portion of his army being lest in Hither-Spain under the command of Hanno. When he approached the passes of the Pyrenees a mutiny broke out among his soldiers, and several thousands, refusing to go any further, returned home. In order to show that he would not compel the reluctant, Hannibal allowed all those who were unwilling to accompany him to go 1 Polyb. v. 1."], [317, "HANNIBAL CROSSES THE ALPS. 297 back. The remaining army, which he now led towards the river Ehone, consisted of 50,000 foot and 9000 horse. He had before sent envoys to the Gauls, to ask for a free passage through their country ; and on their return they brought presents, and the assurance that he woidd not meet with any resistance between the Pyrenees and the Ehone. When the Eomans learned that it was Hannibal's intention to cross the Alps, they resolved to send the consul P. Cornelius Scipio with an army and fleet to Gaul, and his colleague Tib. Sempronius Longus with another to Sicily. Had Scipio arrived with his fleet before Hannibal had left Spain, he might perhaps have stopped his progress ; but the Eomans, who underrated the importance of then- enemy, were slow and awkward, and their army consisted for the most part of inexperienced recruits. As it was, Hannibal had made himself master of Spain as far as the Pyrenees, before the Eoman fleet under Scipio set sail, and when the latter arrived at Massiha he sent his horsemen up the river, and found that Hannibal was aheady on the eastern bank of the Ehone. Scipio then returned to his ships, without making any further attempt to stop the enemy's progress. The Carthaginians had crossed the river in the neighbourhood of Eoquemaure at Pont St. Esprit, and not without a powerful opposition of the Gauls, who dreaded the starving host of invaders, who were obliged to take all they could get in order to maintain themselves. Han nibal avoided coming into contact with the Eomans, and marched up the river. Near the point where the Isere empties itself into the Ehone he formed an affiance with the chieftain of the Allo broges, and proceeded through their territory as far as Vienne. From thence he turned towards Chambery, and followed the course of the Isere to its source, untd he arrived at the foot of the Little St. Bernard. When Hannibal reached this point he had aheady lost a con siderable number of his men, but the remaining part of the army must have been still sufficiently large to require all the provisions which the Alpine tribes, through whose territory he o3"], [318, "298 HISTORY OF ROME. marched, had kid by for the winter. Hence those tribes reso lutely opposed the progress of the Carthaginians. In addition to these difficulties, Hannibal had to struggle with the severity of the season, with snow and frost, with want of provisions, and the consequent despondency of the soldiers, who, accustomed as they were to a milder climate, now suffered greatly from cold and hunger. In many parts, also, it was necessary to clear the road from snow before the army could proceed. But notwith standing all these difficulties Hannibal crossed the Alps in fifteen days, and through the valley of the Aosta he descended from the Little St. Bernard into the plain of Turin, where no one had expected him.2 When Hannibal arrived in the valley of the Aosta, five months after his departure from New Carthage, he had lost nearly all his elephants, and his army was reduced to 20,000 foot and 6000 horse, still an astonishing number, if we consider the difficulties which he must have had to encounter. The want of decision and energy with which the Eomans acted during the time that Han nibal was advancing, can be accounted for only on the supposition that they believed it impossible for him to accomplish Iris gigantic undertaking, and that if he should reach the southern side of the Alps, his army would be in a condition that would require but little effort on the part of the Eomans completely to annihilate it. Hence Scipio, who ought to have awaited Hannibal's arrival at the foot of the Alps, had lingered at Massiria. He sent his brother, Cn. Cornelius Scipio, with the greater part of Iris army to Spain, and then went to Pisa. He did not reach the river Po until Hannibal descended from the Alps, and to the amazement of all had overcome all the immense difficulties which nature and circumstances had placed in his way. The Cisalpine Gauls, who 2 We have here followed the route as made out by General Melville, as to the correctness of which there can be no doubt.

Scipio, after having crossed the Po, encamped on the river Ticinus (Tesino), in the neighbourhood of Pavia. There a battle ensued, in which the Eomans were beaten by Hannibal's Spanish and Numidian cavalry. In this engagement Scipio himself received a dangerous wound, and his life is said to have been saved by the gallant spirit of his youthful son, Pubrius, afterwards called Scipio the Great, or Africanus. The Eomans now at once perceived that they had been labouring under a delusion, and had miscalculated the strength of then- enemy. They called back Tib. Sempronius, who had been engaged in laying waste the coast of Africa. Scipio retreated across the Po, and encamped in the neighbourhood of Placentia, waiting for the arrival of Sempronius, who was sailing with his army towards Ariminum. Hannibal likewise crossed the Po below Placentia, and pitched his camp on the eastern bank of the Trebia, with a view of cutting off the retreat of the Bomans. In the meantime Sempronius, who had landed at Ariminum, arrived, and reinforced the army of Scipio, who was still suffering from his wound, and was unable to undertake the command of the army. It was perhaps for this reason that Scipio dissuaded his colleague from venturing upon a battle, although Sempronius wished it, and thought it a disgrace to remain idle. Hannibal, though from different motives, was equally anxious to strike a blow, for he was sure of victory, and wanted to get rid of the enemy in these districts, in order that he might be able to take up his winter quarters, to give his soldiers the rest of which they were so much in want, and to organize the Gauls. Sempronius, on the other hand, who had no experience of the enemy, fancied he should have an easy victory. The two armies encamped on the opposite banks of the river Trebia, which is very broad, but shallow, and divided into a number of small streams : the banks were covered with shrubs, in which a detachment of Hannibal's troops lay in ambush"], [320, "300 HISTORY OF ROME. Hannibal irritated the Eomans, and enticed them to cross the river : they allowed themselves to be ensnared, and Sempronius led his men through the cold and icy river. There was at the time a sprinkling of snow, which the wind blew into the faces of the Eomans. When, therefore, they arrived on the opposite bank, the soldiers were almost frozen. Hannibal, who had contrived to keep his men in excellent condition for fighting, now advanced to meet the enemy. The Eomans, although they were aheady defeated by the severity of the elements, and of the season, fought most bravely ; but they were beaten : then- left wing escaped to Placentia, whither they were followed by all who survived the day ; for the weather became so tempestuous, that the Cartha ginians did not think it advisable to pursue the enemy. The army at Placentia having thus escaped, the consids at first tried to deceive the Boman senate about the extent of the loss they had sustained, but the truth became known but too soon ; for even before Hannibal took up his winter quarters, his army spread over both banks of the Po. The Eomans, however, true to then- genius, did not despond ; and with confidence in the pro tection of the immortal gods, they exerted all then- powers to preserve and secure possessions which it was easy to lose, but difficult to recover when once lost. New armies accordingly were raised ; and Sardinia and Sicily, Tarentum and other towns, were strongly garrisoned, in order to keep them in submission. In the spring of B.c. 217, the consul, C. Flaminius, went with his army to Ariminum, where he was joined by a portion of the soldiers who had served under Scipio the year before. Flaminius, who may have been rash and inconsiderate, is yet greatly misrepre sented in history. He was hated by the aristocratic party, be cause in his tribuneship he had carried the agrarian law, enacting that the ager Gafficus Picenus should be distributed among the people, and because he had subsequently supported another law which affected the pockets of the insatiable aristocrats.3 Hanni- 3 The law here alluded to was car- B.c. 218 : it enacted, that no senator ried by the tribune, Q. Claudius, in should be permitted to have a sea-ship"], [321, "301 BATTLE OF LAKE TRASIMENUS. bal, unconcerned about the army at Ariminum, which, in fact, did not arrive there until he had set out on his march,4 went from Lucca through the marshes on the right bank of the river Arno into Etruria. On this difficult and dangerous march, which lasted for three days and three nights, Hannibal rode on the only elephant that was yet surviving. His army had indeed been increased by the Gauls, but he lost a great number of men and horses ; and he himself lost the use of one eye completely while passing through those marshes, which in spring must have given to the country the appearance of a sea. He seems to have chosen that road, because no one expected him there. After his arrival at Faesulae, he proceeded straightway to Eome. C. Fla minius, who had in the meantime been informed of the enemy's movements, broke up from Ariminum, and hastened to protect the road to Eome, before Hannibal had made himself master of it. But the latter had advanced as far as Clusium, and reached the rocky shores of lake Trasimenus, where Flaminius arrived soon after him. Hannibal had taken up his position on the heights ; and as the Eomans pressed forward on the narrow path between the hills and the lake, Hannibal fell upon them. The day was foggy, and the Eomans being unable to see, and being attacked on three sides at once, were in a most frightful position. The excitement during the battle is said to have been so great, that an earthquake, which took place at the time, was not per- ceived by the combatants.5 Fifteen thousand Eomans perished on the spot, many of whom were driven into the lake and drowned ; the rest escaped to an Etruscan village. Flaminius of more than 300 amphorae, which was thought sufficient to carry to Rome the produce of their distant estates ; for, to enter upon mercantile specula tions, which the nobles at this time appear to have largely engaged in, was thought dishonourable to a man of senatorial rank. But the opposition of the nobles to the law of Claudius was of the most vehement kind. \u2014 Cicero, in Verr. v. 18. neglected the celebration of the Feriae Latinae, previous to going to Arimi num ; but the charge is hypocritical and ludicrous, for surely Hannibal would not have waited till the Feriae were over; and in fact Flaminius, as it was, arrived too late at Ariminum. Livy (xxii. 3) mentions some other charges which are equally absurd. 5 Plin. Hist. Nat. ii. 86; Liv. xxii. 5. 4 Flaminius is charged with having"], [322, "302 HISTORY OF ROME. himself was among the slain. Hannibal, whose object it was to create for himself a power in Italy, before he could humble Eome to the dust, distributed the Eoman prisoners among his army to be guarded, while he allowed the Italian allies of Eome to return to their homes without ransom. Here, as elsewhere, it was his maxim not to wage war against the Italians, but to make them believe that he was fighting against Eome on then behalf. Immediately after the battle of lake Trasimenus, Hannibal heard that the consul Cn. Servilius, who was stationed at Ariminum to protect the province of Gaul, had sent a detachment to assist C. Flaminius : as soon as this detachment fell in with the Car thaginians, most of the men were cut to pieces, and the remainder fell into the hands of Hannibal alive. When the news of this memorable defeat reached Bome, and the praetor announced to the assembly of the people that they had suffered a great loss, the consternation was immense ; and in these distressing circumstances it was resolved to appoint a dictator. As the consid Cn. Servilius was absent, the people \u2014 a thing which had never been done before \u2014 elected Q.. Fabius Maximus to the office, and M. Minucius was appointed his magister equitum. Fabius has a great name in history, and in some respects it is well deserved, for he was a calm, cautious, and persevering general, and his recovery of Tarentum was a great military achievement ; but his personal character does not merit the praise that is commonly bestowed upon him, for his subse quent opposition to the great Scipio, who was still quite a young man when Fabius had reached the height of his fame, arose from mere personal jealousy and envy : Fabius could not contemplate without grief the rising greatness of Scipio ; and it is clear that he would have rather seen Hannibal victorious than seen liim conquered by Scipio. M. Minucius was a general of the very opposite kind, for he was bold, ambitious, and hasty. A new army was formed, partly of those who had survived the day on lake Trasimenus, and partly by fresh levies ; and the want of soldiers was so great, that even prisoners were enlisted."], [323, "HANNIBAL IN THE EAST OF ITALY. 303 After the battle of Trasimenus, Hamiibal was expected to march straightway to Eome; but he went towards Spoletum, from the conquest of which Eoman colony he hoped to derive great advantages. But that town held out, and remained faithful to Eome ; and as he had a great aversion to protracted sieges, he broke up and marched into Picenum, which abounded in pro visions for his army. There he took up his summer quarters, which are as necessary in Italy as winter quarters are in northern countries. The question which must here present itself to every reader, is, why did not Hannibal march against Eome, and endeavour to take it at a time when the -greatest consternation was prevailing in the city ? The answer to this question must be sought for hi the circumstances of the case. Bome was then a strong fortress and coidd not be easily taken, and to blockade it would have required a very large army. But what was pro bably of greater weight with him, was the condition of his own army : his soldiers were suffering from a cutaneous disease, in consequence of their stay in the unhealthy country of Cisalpine Gaul, and of then subsequent passage through the marshes of Etruria. The unhealthy atmosphere of the vicinity of Eome, during the summer months, might have destroyed Iris whole army. In addition to this, it must be remembered that his hope of success was mainly based upon a coalition of the Italians against Eome ; but though from the moment of his arrival in Italy he had treated the Italians with great generosity, still he had not yet been able to rouse or unite them against Eome. These were sufficient reasons to deter a general like Hannibal from the attempt to take Eome by force ; and he accordingly led his army southward, along the coast of the Adriatic. His march from Picenum to Apulia was a series of calamities for those districts; for, as the walls of most of the towns had been destroyed by recent earthquakes, Hannibal meeting with little resistance, obliged the people to furnish his army with the necessary provisions ; and while the soldiers ravaged the country, the dictator Fabius followed them at a short distance, harassing"], [324, "304 HISTORY OF ROME. the enemy, and always pitching his camp on lofty hills, so that Hannibal compared the enemy's army to a cloud hovering on the mountains.6 Hannibal's object was to gain the Via Latina and the town of Casinum, and then to see what effect his position would produce on the Italians. But by some mistake Hannibal's general led the army to Casffinum instead of Casinum ; and by this unlucky accident Fabius got ahead of the enemy, and cut off his retreat between Casffinum and mount Callicula. When Hannibal discovered the mistake, he saved his army by a strata gem : he fastened bundles of brushwood to the horns of 2000 oxen, and having set fire to the wood he drove them towards the Eomans. When the animals in the darkness of night advanced, the Eomans were frightened by the singular spectacle, and quitted their favourable position, which was immediately occupied by Hannibal, who then returned through Samnium to the frontiers of Apulia aud the Frentanians. Here he was again met by Fabius, who ventured upon petty skirmishes in which the Eomans gained some advantages, which led them to the belief that if an effort were made, it would be an easy matter to chase the enemy from Italy, and that his being still in the country was owing only to the excessive caution of the dictator. Hence, as some advantages had been gained by Minucius, a law was passed at Bome enacting that the magister equitum should have equal power with the dictator, and the command of one-half of the army.7 On this occasion Fabius showed a real greatness of mind, for he not only brooked the insult, preferring to be feared by a prudent enemy to being praised by a foolish people, but even saved the rash Minucius, who allowed lrimself to be drawn into an engagement with the Cartha ginians, from utter destruction. This act of generosity induced Minucius to resign Iris power, and Iris deliverer now terminated the campaign of the year in as favourable a manner as the cir cumstances would allow. He was henceforth distinguished by 6 Liv. xxii. 30. 1 Liv. xxii. 25; Polyb. iii. 103; Plut. Fab. 9."], [325, "305 BATTLE OF CANNAE. the honourable surname of the Slack (Cunctator) , and of him Ennius sang : \u2014 Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.8 Soon after these occurrences, Fabius laid down his dictatorship, and the consuls who now resumed then command followed his plan of operation, but without being able to effect anything decisive. Hannibal spent the winter in Apulia, where he was in rather distressed circumstances, for the produce of the fields had been carried into the fortified towns before his arrival, and he had great difficulty in providing food for his army. His position was all the more precarious, because up to this time he had not been joined by one of the Italian nations. These circumstances, together with the advantages which his enemies had gained in Spain and Italy, raised great hopes in the minds of the Eomans ; but a fearful day was yet awaiting them, a day which would have been certain ruin to any other republic. The consuls of the year B.C. 216 were L. Aemilius Paulus, a patrician who cherished a profound hatred of the people, and C. Terentius Varro, who is said to have been a butcher's son, and to have risen by his dema gogic artifices.9 These consuls, who were expected to put an end to the war with one blow, led into the field an army of 80,000 foot and upwards of 6000 horse. With these forces they entered Apulia, and pitched their camp on the banks of the river Aufidus, not far from the little town of Cannae, where they kept their stores. Hannibal had no more elephants, but his cavalry was excellent. Cannae was taken by him under the very eyes of the Eomans, who were timid and not inclined to venture upon a decisive battle, though the consul Varro was anxious to strike the blow. After a long delay, which it is difficult to ac count for, the fatal battle was fought, on the second of August.10 8 Cicero, Be Off. i. 24 ; Sil.

It is said that Hannibal had taken up such a position, that a high wind, which usually rose at noon-tide, blew the dust into the faces of the Eomans, and that on the day before the battle he had ordered the fields to be ploughed in order to increase the dust. The Eomans advanced against the retreating centre of the Gauls, but were outflanked on both sides by the Africans, and though tired were obliged to maintain the fight against the latter. The Eoman cavalry was unable to cope with the Spaniards, and being surrounded on all sides, the Eomans were pressed together and cut to pieces. Forty-five thousand dead covered the field of battle, among whom were the consul Aemilius Paulus, eighty senators, and a number of persons who had been invested with the highest offices of the republic. The surviving Eomans capitulated, and surrendered on condition that Hannibal should commence nego tiations with Eome for their ransom. Varro escaped with a few horsemen to Venusia, and another small detachment threw itself into Canusium ; but Hannibal, unconcerned about the latter, marched towards Capua. The consternation and paralysis which the news of this total defeat of so numerous an army produced at Eome is indescrib able ; but the Eomans did not sink under it : when Varro returned, the senate went out to meet and thank him for not having despaired of the republic ; and when Hannibal sent the Eoman prisoners home to be ransomed, the senate, stirred up by the vigorous speech of the stem T. Manlius Torquatus, bade them return. The Carthaginian envoys who came with proposals of peace were not admitted into the city, and a truly Eoman severity was shown towards the unfortunate men who had survived the fearful day of Cannae, for they were treated as dishonoured per sons and sent to serve in the distant province of Sicily to wipe off their disgrace. Hereupon the Eomans endeavour-ed to pro pitiate the gods by sacrifices, and the historian Fabius Pictor was sent as ambassador to Delphi, to learn from the oracle of Apollo what woidd be the end of all these misfortunes. It deserves to be mentioned, that among the sacrifices offered up at that time"], [327, "CAPUA REVOLTS TO HANNIBAL. 307 there were two pahs of human beings, a male and a female Gaul, and a male and a female Greek.11 Maharbal, the commander of the Carthaginian cavalry, had advised Hannibal, immediately after the battle of Cannae, to march against Eome ; but Hannibal steadily kept to his original plan of destroying Bome through the Italians, as whose deliverer he wanted to appear. This drew upon him the reproach, that he knew better how to win a victory than how to make use of it. His plan however now seemed to be near its realisation, for a number of the Italian cities and towns, immediately after the fatal battle, abandoned the cause of Bome, and joined the Carthagini ans. This was the case more especially in southern Italy, where the people still remembered then* ancient liberty, and felt the weight of the Eoman yoke ; but even in middle Italy many towns went over to Hannibal, so that Eome was confined almost to the same extent of country which it had possessed previous to the conquest of Samnium. Hannibal was thus joined by Atella, Colatia, the Hirpinians, the Samnites with the exception of the Pentrians, the Bruttians, Lucanians, Surrentum, nearly all the Greek towns on the coasts, and all the Gauls in the north of Italy ; but as he was obliged to maintain his army at the expense of his Italian allies, he was unable permanently to attach them to himself. He had commenced negotiations with Capua, even before the battle of Cannae. This town was, next to Bome, the most important city in Italy ; but wealth and luxuries had rendered its citizens unwarrike and effeminate. They stood to Eome in the favourable relation of isoporites, and the great families of Capua were connected by intermarriage with those of Bome ; but in spite of all this Capua now turned against Eome, probably in the vain hope of becoming the mistress of Italy, if Eome should perish. This hope was fostered by Hannibal, and when, after the battle of Cannae, he appeared in Campania, everything was prepared for the revolt. The only circumstance that made 11 Liv. xxii. 57."], [328, "308 HISTORY OF ROME. Capua hesitate for a moment, was the fact that 300 of the noblest Campanians were engaged in Sicily in the service of Eome, and were regarded as a sort of hostages for the fidelity of Capua. But this scruple was got over : Capua ungratefully deserted Eome, and concluded a favourable treaty with Hannibal. It retained its independence, and was allowed to select from among the Eoman captives 300 of the noblest, as a compensation for the 300 Campanians in Sicily. Capua further committed the outrage of putting to death all the Eomans that were staying within its walls. In his march through Campania, Hannibal, who had as yet no port town to keep up a communication with Carthage, attempted to make himself master of Cumae, Naples, and Nola ; but he was unsuccessful, and at the last of these places he even sustained a severe loss. He entered Capua, and took up his winter quarters there. He had now reached the highest point of his glory. It is said that his stay in the effeminate city of Capua corrupted Iris army, and destroyed its discipline. It may be that the luxurious life at Capua rendered his men disinclined further to endure the hardships which they had hitherto borne cheerfully; but it must at the same time be taken into considera tion, that it was impossible for him to recruit his army from Spain, Africa, or Gaul ; that he had lost the best of his men in the battles he had fought ; and that he had no other means of com pleting his regiments, except by enlisting Italian recruits. These circumstances alone are perhaps sufficient to account for the fact, that after the battle of Cannae the Carthaginian army appears in a very different light from what it had been before. The senate at Carthage, where Hannibal's victories had silenced all opposition, had decreed to send him reinforcements immediately after the battle of Cannae ; but the decree was carried into effect with great sluggishness. Some reinforcements, however, must have reached him before he took up his winter quarters at Capua.12 Eome made the most incredible exertions to restore her armies. 12 Liv. xxiii. 18."], [329, "309 HANNIBAL NEAR ROME. The management of the war was entrusted to the dictator M. Junius ; and besides 8000 slaves who were purchased by the state on credit of their masters, and formed into two regiments, even gladiators were enlisted to serve in then usual arms. While these efforts were made, Eome was suffering from an extreme scarcity of provisions. It is therefore a very remarkable fact, that Hannibal, supported as he now was by many Italians, while Eome was in the greatest distress, from this time forward appears less and less able to cope with the Eomans, and that the latter acquired new strength every day. In B.C. 215, Hannibal made two unsuccessful attempts upon the fortified camp of the praetor, M. Claudius Marceilus, at Nola, and sustained considerable losses whereas the Eomans, in the same year, began to restore their authority in Campania. The Campanians behaved as cowards, and allowed themselves to be shut up like sheep in a fold. A Carthaginian detachment under Hanno, which tried to relieve them, was beaten by Tib. Sempronius Gracchus in the neighbour hood of Beneventum ; and Hannibal, seeing himself thwarted, appears for a time to have lost his former energy ; for though he had now received reinforcements from Carthage, still he allowed the Eomans to blockade Capua without making any attempt to save the place. He lingered in Apulia and Lucania, making some petty conquests, and left Capua to its fate. At length, however, he appeared in its neighbourhood, and as he found the Eomans unwilling to accept a battle, he marched along the Via Latina towards Bome, and crossed the river Liris near Fregellae. As he proceeded further, the city of Bome was thrown into a state of the greatest alarm ; but he did not find a favour- able reception anywhere. Q. Fulvius, who was conducting the blockade of Capua, was called back to protect Eome. This was just what Hannibal wished ; but the Carthaginian officer who had been left behind to introduce provisions into Capua, or to relieve it if he could, was quite unfit for his post, and did not succeed. Hannibal, in the meantime, had pitched his camp in the immediate neighbourhood of Eome, near the Colrine gate ;"], [330, "310 HISTORY OF ROME. but when Fulvius arrived and offered battle, Hannibal declined it, and, satisfying himself with ravaging the country, returned to Campania, and thence to Ehegium. Capua still continued to be blockaded by another Eoman army. Hiero of Syracuse, the faithful ally of Eome, died in B.C. 216, and was succeeded by his grandson Hieronymus, who, thinking that after the battle of Cannae Eome would be unable to raise her head again, began to treat the Eomans with contempt, and to negotiate with Hannibal. The latter made all possible con- cessions, on condition of Hieronymus renouncing the friendship of Eome. But the tyrannical rule of Hieronymus exasperated his subjects, and after a reign of thirteen months he was mur- dered. Two Carthaginians of Syracusan origin, Hippocrates and Epicydes, now usurped the government of Syracuse, and them the Eomans immediately tried to win over to then interest ; but as the usurpers openly declared themselves against Eome, an army was sent under M. Claudius Marcellus to Sicily, B.C. 214. Marcellus laid siege to Syracuse and afterwards blockaded it, but it was not taken till B.C. 212, when Marcellus made himself master of the place by treachery. The siege of Syracuse is re- markable on account of the engines which Archimedes is said to have used in its defence. It is related that he destroyed the works of the Eomans by means of burning-glasses, but this seems to be an invention; and all that can be said with certainty is, that by his superior skill in mechanics he constantly thwarted the attempts of the battering-rams, and destroyed the mihtary engines of the Eomans. After taking the town, Marcellus, indeed, did not allow the soldiers to plunder or destroy it, but he treated its inhabitants with barbarous cruelty : those who were not sold as slaves were driven out into the open fields, where they died of hunger ; and many gave themselves out as slaves that they might escape starvation.13 Another example of similar cruelty was exhibited in B.C. 211, in the reconquest of Capua, though in this case the Eomans had 13 Diodor. Excerpt. Vat. p. 68, ed. Dindorf ; comp. Excerp t. Vales, p. 569."], [331, "THE WAR IN SPAIN. 311 had greater provocation than in Sicily. Capua was not indeed destroyed, but the Eomans raged against its inhabitants with all imaginable fury. Before the gates were thrown open to the Eomans, the most distinguished persons had made away with themselves, in order not to fall into the hands of the enemy, and others killed then wives and children. When the gates were opened, the Eoman soldiers acted like infuriated demons : all the nobles were put in chains, the mass of the people were driven from then- houses, the senators were put to the sword, and no one was allowed to remain in the town except slaves and freed men. The whole territory of Capua was made domain land of the Boman republic.14 In B.C. 212, Hannibal, after a long siege, gained possession of Tarentum, but it was retaken in B.C. 209 by Q. Fabius Maximus, the place being treacherously delivered up into his hands by the persons whom Hannibal had intrusted with the command of its garrison. The subjugation of Sicily had been completed the year before by the consul M. Valerius Laevinus ; and most of the Greek towns of Italy, being intimidated by the example of Syracuse and Capua, now abandoned the cause of Hannibal, whose situation became more and more difficult, and whose power was reduced from day to day. His only hope now was his brother Hasdrubal. At the very beginning of this war, B.C. 218, the Eomans had sent Cn. Cornelius Scipio to Spain, to conduct the war against the Carthaginians under Hasdrubal. He had soon after been joined by his brother Publius. The two Scipios remained in Spain for a number of years, ever harassing the Carthaginians and keeping Hasdrubal engaged ; so that after the battle of Cannae, when he was expected to march into Italy and co-operate with his brother, he was prevented by the Scipios, who gained considerable advantages over the Carthaginians, and conquered them near Ibera, in B.C. 216, and near Lffiberis, in B.c. 215. About the same time Syphax, king of the Masasyrians in the west of 14 Liv. xxviii. 46."], [332, "312 HISTORY OF ROME. Numidia, formed a connection with the Scipios, and a Eoman fleet sailed to Africa. Syphax attacked Carthage, but was defeated by Masinissa, king of Numidia, who was then allied with Carthage. But in B.C. 212 the Scipios experienced the inconstancy of for tune, for both were skiu within thirty days of each other, and their armies were nearly annihilated. The remains of the army were saved only by the heroic conduct of L. Marcius, who, with the most desperate efforts, prevented the enemy from reaping all the fruits of his victory. The Eomans, by these defeats, lost all then possessions south-east of the Iberus, and Hasdrubal now made serious preparations for invading Italy. At Eome, the consterna tion was so great that no one was found willing to undertake the command in Spain, until at length, in B.C. 211, P. Cornelius Scipio, the son of P. Scipio who had been killed in Spain, came forward and offered to go. As he was then only 24 years old, and was still in mourning for his father, many objected to his age, as weh as to the ominous circumstances of his being in mourn ing. But as he was extremely popular, the people gave him the command with the title of proconsul, and provided him with all that was necessary for Iris bold undertaking. This young man, who was to be the conqueror of Hannibal, is next to him the greatest hero in this war. He is said to have distinguished himself as early as the battle on the Ticinus ; and throughout his career he showed a talent as a general which was surpassed by none save Hannibal. He was especially famous for his great piety, and while at Eome he went every morning to the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol and prayed : whether this religious feeling was genuine or merely assumed no one can say, but it made him immensely popular with the superstitious multitude. As a citizen he was proud and haughty, and in matters where his per sonal feelings were concerned he even despised the laws of Iris country, thus setting an evil example. On his arrival in Spain, in B.C. 211, he found the army which he had to discipline in a state of complete disorganis ation. The great control he exercised over himself, the"], [333, "SCIPIO IN SPAIN. 313 belief in his familiar intercourse with the gods, and the suc cess with which he commenced his operations, soon inspired his soldiers with such confidence, that no enemy seemed in vincible. He was soon the avenger of his father : according to some accounts, he had not been in Spain more than seven days before he took the strongly-fortified and populous town of New Carthage ; 15 and C. Laerius, his friend and companion, was despatched to carry the news of this happy event to Eome. The taking of this important place was an irreparable loss to the Carthaginians, who seem to have taken little trouble to relieve it, perhaps because Hasdrubal's attention was wholly directed towards Italy, after the conquest of which he may have thought that it woidd be an easy matter to recover what might be lost in Spain. Scipio, after the conquest of New Carthage, traversed the southern part of the country, and took many of the allied towns of the Carthaginians, among which Astapa deserves to be particularly mentioned. It was besieged by Marcius, and as its citizens foresaw that, owing to then staunch fidelity to Carthage, they would be treated in a cruel manner if their town should be taken, they fought with desperate bravery : after nearly all had fallen, the last fifty survivors, according to an oath they had taken, murdered all the women and children, burnt all the treasures they possessed, and at last made away with themselves.16 In B.C. 209, Hasdrubal assembled a large army near Baecula, which was joined by many Iberians under his brother Mago, and by Numidians under Masinissa. The whole hostile forces consisted of 75,000 men and 36 elephants, and Scipio hesitated as to whether he should attack so formidable a power, for his own forces amounted to scarcely one-third of that of the enemy. Want of provisions at length obliged him to offer battle, and he gained the victory ; but he could not prevent Masi nissa going to Gades ; nor did Hasdrubal think it unsafe to 15 It is however more than probable xxvi. 41, &c., xxvii. 7. that he did not take that town till the 16 Liv. xxviii. 22 ; Appian. year after, i.e. b.c. 210. See Liv. pan. 33. P"], [334, "314 HISTORY OF ROME. set out for Italy in B.C. 208. Hasdrubal had previously formed connections with the Gauls, so that in marching through then country and across the Alps he met with no resistance. He reached the southern foot of the Alps in B.C. 207, having com pleted his march, it is said, in two months. Hannibal was unpre pared for the sudden arrival of his brother, though he had been long looking forward to it. Hasdrubal kid siege to Placentia, but was unsuccessful, and lost a great deal of time. Another unfortunate circumstance was, that the letters he sent to his brother Hannibal fell into the hands of the Eomans, who thus became acquainted with his whole plan of operation. The consul Livius Salinator afterwards encamped against him in the neighbourhood of Sena,on the river Metaurus in Umbria, where he was soon after joined by his colleague C. Claudius Nero, who had untd then been opera ting against Hannibal. When Hasdrubal became aware of Nero's arrival, he attempted to retreat during the night across the Metaurus, but being deserted by his guides and unable to find a ford, he was attacked by the Eomans while wandering along the river's bank. In the ensuing battle his whole army was routed and cut to pieces. A Eoman cut off the head of Hasdrubal, and afterwards flung it into the camp of Hannibal, who, on seeing it and the captive Carthaginians, at once perceived that the fate of Carthage as well as of himself was sealed. The Carthaginian hon henceforth confined himself to the territory of the Bruttians, who remained faithful to him. He maintained himself on the defensive ; and being convinced that he should not be able to re main much longer in Italy, he erected a monument in the temple of Juno Lacinia (on mount Lacinium, on the eastern coast of Bruttium), with an inscription giving an account of his Italian campaign. It was afterwards seen by Polybius, who made use of it for his account of the Hannibarian war.17 After the departure of Hasdrubal from Spain, the Carthaginians still had two armies in that province, but it soon became evident that Hasdrubal had been the soul of all theirundertakings, and that * Polyb. iii. 33."], [335, "FALL OF ASDRUBAL. 315 Hasdrubal, the son of Gisco, and Mago were not able to supply his place. They indeed continued the war against the Eomans, but Scipio succeeded, in a succession of battles, in graduaily repeffing them, and after then defeat at Baecula they took refuge at Gades. The Spaniards became aware that they were given up by the Carthaginians, and that they were only made use of by them for the purpose of extorting money and the means of riving. Hence they began to refuse obedience, and endeavoured to drive them from the Peninsula. Gades even shut its gates against Mago, and concluded a treaty with Bome. Hasdrubal sailed to Africa ; and Mago, who likewise embarked, led the remainder of his troops to the Balearian islands. From thence he afterwards crossed over to Liguria, with a view to establish himself there and attack the Eomans in Etruria, which then began to show symptoms of a rebellious spirit ;18 but his hopes were disap pointed. The Eomans were now masters of Spain. Scipio remained there upwards of three years : he was now engaged in chas tising the towns which had been faithless to Eome. During this period an occurrence took place which is particularly remarkable, because it is the first perceptible symptom of a discontent which was gradually rising among the Italian allies of Eome. They were obliged to furnish a contingent to the Boman armies far surpassing that of the Eomans themselves in numbers, and they appear to have begun to feel that they ought to be placed on an equality with the citizens of Eome. An insurrection broke out among the allies who served in Scipio's army : they chose an Umbrian and a Latin for then leaders, and gave them the title and ensigns of Eoman consuls. The affair was of a very serious nature, but the deep cunning of Scipio deceived them. He promised them their pay, and invited them to come to New Carthage ; and in order to inspire them with confidence, he ordered the Boman garrison to quit the town before the muti neers entered. But while the latter were assembling in the 18 Liv. xxx. 19. p 2"], [336, "316 HISTORY OF ROME. market-place, the garrison returned and compelled the rebels to submit to the will of Scipio, who put thirty-five of the most guilty to death. The chastisement of some Spanish chiefs was the last act of Scipio in Spain. But before returning to Bome he crossed over to Africa, B.C. 206, whither he was invited by Syphax, who had sometimes been at war with Carthage, and sometimes her ally, but was now in a sort of neutral position. When Scipio arrived in Africa he con- cluded a treaty with him, which was the first step towards the realisation of Scipio's great plan. He had from the first been persuaded that the war with Carthage must be brought to a close in Africa itself. He was still proconsul, and now went to Eome to offer himself as a candidate for the consulship, though he had not yet attained the legitimate age. But owing to the extraordinary popularity he enjoyed, the people, notwithstanding the jealous opposition of Fabius and his party,19 unanimously elected him consul for the year B.C. 205, together with P. Licinius Crassus. But after he was made consul, and Sicily was assigned to him as his province, with the permission to cross over to Africa if he should think it desirable for the good of the republic, the same jealous party of Fabius, supported by the senate, refused him the means, without which he could not carry his plans into effect : the people, on the other hand, not only of Bome, but of all Italy, flocked to his standard, and formed an army of volunteers ; and the towns of Etruria and Umbria distinguished themselves above all others by then enthusiasm for the young hero. A large fleet, and an army of 7000 volunteers, were thus soon assembled and followed Scipio to Sicily. Hannibal was still tarrying in Brut- tium, but in this confinement he resembled a lion surrounded by hounds, and whoever attacked him paid dearly for it. From Sicily, Scipio made an attack on Locri, which was taken ; but the avarice of one of his lieutenants, Q. Pleminius, gave rise to a charge against Scipio, that he neglected the discipline of his army, that he lived in luxury at Syracuse, that he assumed Greek man- 19 Liv. xxviii. 40, &c."], [337, "SCIPIO LANDS IN AFRICA. 317 ners, and spent his time in reading Greek authors. Commissioners were accordingly sent by the senate to examine the state of tilings in Sicily ; but everything was found in the best order, and all sus picions were removed. The taking of Locri was the only event of any consequence in the year of Scipio's consulship : it seems that he was chiefly engaged in making preparations for crossing over to Africa, which he did in the year following, b.c. 204, his friend and legate, C. Laerius, having proceeded thither before him. Scipio landed in the neighbourhood of Utica, with an army of 17,000 foot and several thousand horse.20 It is surprising to find Carthage, which a few years later appears in possession of a fleet of 500 ships, not making any attempt either to meet the fleet of Scipio or to pre vent his landing. This may be accounted for, either by the un warrike spirit of the Carthaginians, who did not think of any danger until they saw it before then own eyes, 'or by supposing that there must have been disputes or treachery in the senate which rendered speedy measures of defence impracticable. Syphax being induced by his love of Sophonisba, the daughter of Has drubal, to disregard his alliance with Scipio, had again joined the Carthaginians with his army. Masinissa, king of Numidia, on the other hand,, who had also been in love with Sophonisba, but was deprived of her by Syphax, secretly promised Scipio Iris support, for he was at the time in affiance with Carthage. After his landing in Africa, Scipio was met by three armies, one under Hasdrubal which had been hurriedly assembled, another under the command of Syphax, and a third under that of Masi nissa. \u25a0 Scipio, therefore, was obliged to maintain himself on the defensive ; but Masinissa led the Carthaginians out to an under taking which he had treacherously preconcerted with Scipio,21 who lay in ambush waiting for the enemy, and fell upon them as soon as they appeared. Masinissa then went over to the Eomans. 20 The place where he landed and tuliana. Caesar, Bell.

The greatest confusion prevailed among the Carthaginians, and a great number of them fell by the sword. After this, Syphax and Hasdrubal took the field against Scipio. Then tents were made of straw and branches, which in the hot climate of Africa soon became as dry as touch-wood. The Eomans contrived to set them on fire, and amid the conflagration which now ensued, the Carthaginians allowed themselves to be butchered like sheep. Syphax, as a true barbarian, now abandoned the cause of his allies, and withdrew to his kingdom, where he was attacked by Masinissa and C. Laelius. He was defeated aud taken prisoner, and a great part of his kingdom was given to Masinissa, who now married Sophonisba. But as Scipio demanded her surrender, because he mistrusted her, Masinissa prevented her faffing into the hands of the Boman by poisoning her. Scipio had, in the meantime, made an attempt to blockade Utica, but without success. Carthage had by this time arrived at the conviction, that, with out the return of Hannibal, all her hopes were vain. In B.C. 202, having received the command to quit Italy, he unhesitatingly obeyed the summons of his country, and landed at Adnrmetum. He went to meet Scipio on the river Bagradas, and having lost all hope of success, he had an interview with the great Eoman, at which he recommended the peace for which negotiations had already commenced. The two heroes saw each other for the first time with silent admiration. Hannibal was more than ever convinced that peace was the only means of saving Carthage ; and Scipio too had not been unwilling to grant it, for he had reason to fear lest a successor should be sent from Eome to reap the fruits of his labours. The conditions which he had proposed were hard indeed, but yet mild in comparison with those which Carthage was afterwards compelled to accept. A truce had been concluded, during which ambassadors were sent to Bome to obtain the sanction of the senate to the terms of the peace. But when the Carthaginians found that the forces of Hannibal were still considerable, they were vexed at the steps they had taken, and"], [339, "BATTLE OF ZAMA. 319 began to insult the Eomans in every possible way, being resolved once more to try then fortune. The folly of the Carthaginian people thus broke off all negotiations, for as they had then general Hannibal among them they fancied themselves invincible. He, although he severely censured then childish belief, was obliged to give way to their enthusiasm. The war was now decided by the fatal battle of Zama, in B.C. 202. Hannibal's army consisted of 50,000 men and 80 elephants; that of Scipio of 24,000 men, whom he drew up in columns, leaving large intervals between them for the elephants to escape, which spaces were then to be filled up by the cavalry so as to prevent the return of the elephants. The plan succeeded admirably. The Carthaginians fought like lions, but Scipio's skill and presence of mind decided the victory. The greater part of the Carthaginian army was cut to pieces, and the remainder dispersed. Hannibal himself escaped with a few companions to Adrumetum, and thence to Carthage, where the senate, unable to continue the war, had aheady commenced fresh negotiations for peace. It was fortunate for Carthage that Scipio himself was anxious to bring the war to a close. Han nibal too advised his countrymen to submit to necessity. But the terms which Scipio now offered were much harder than those which he had proposed at first. Carthage was to retain its territory in Africa and its own constitution, but to deliver up all Eoman deserters and captives without ransom, to surrender its whole fleet with the exception often triremes, and all elephants, none of which were henceforth to be trained for purposes of war : Carthage, further, was not allowed to can-y on any war without the sanction of Eome ; it was obliged to indemnify Masinissa for all the losses he had sustained, and to recognise him as king of Numidia ; it had to pay to Eome 10,000 Euboean talents by instalments in fifty years, that is 200 annually. It was further commanded to give a large number of hostages, and to provide the Eoman army in Africa with all that was necessary for its maintenance, untfl the peace should be ratified at Eome by the senate and people. Some of the Carthaginian nobles opposed"], [340, "320 HISTORY OF ROME. these terms, and Hannibal in just indignation seized one of them and dragged him down from the tribune. This exasperated the whole party, and Hannibal escaped only by declaring that owing to his long absence from Carthage he was unacquainted with the manners and customs of his country. The peace was not ratified at Bome till the year B.C. 201; for the consul Cn. Cornelius Len tulus, the successor of Scipio, hoped to prolong the war, that he himself might have the glory of bringing it to a close. Scipio then returned with his army to Sicily, and thence to Bome, where he celebrated a magnificent triumph adorned by Syphax, who ended his days at Alba. Italy had suffered enormously during the sixteen years that Hannibal and his army had been staying in the country ; for the bloody battles which had been fought, the ravaging marches of the hostrie troops, and the conquest and destruction of flourishing towns, had kid waste the country far and wide, while the levies of troops, both by the Eomans and then- enemies, had almost depopulated whole districts of Italy. But still the Boman republic at the close of the war was far more powerful than she had been at the beginning. The Boman dominion in Italy was soon restored, and the people in the southern part of it were chastised for their faithlessness. Several colonies were established in southern Italy ; perhaps, however, as much for the purpose of providing for impoverished Eomans, as for that of securing the possession of the country. Scipio's veterans were rewarded with assignments of land in Lucania and Apulia. The Gauls in the north of Italy were likewise reduced to obedience by the praetor L. Furius, in B.C. 200, and were kept in check by reinforcements sent to the Eoman colonies in those districts. But the internal distress of Bome, as well as of the other Italian towns, must have formed a strong contrast with this outward prosperity : the prices of all provisions and commodities had risen to an enormous height ; and if, in addition, we consider the heavy claims that had been made upon the people, the middle classes must have been in a state of complete exhaustion. This state of things produced"], [341, "CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR. 321 that wide gulf between the wealthy and the poor, of which we shall see the lamentable results about half a century later. To wards the end of the war, the republic had been under the neces sity of raising a public loan, and the money was to be paid back to the creditors by three instalments ;22 but the Macedonian war involved Eome in fresh difficulties, and she was obliged to pay her debts in lands. At the close of the Hannibalian war, the Eoman dominion extended over Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and a great part of Spain ; even Carthage and Numidia existed only in a state of de pendence on Eome. The annihilation of the Carthaginian fleet had made theEomans masters of the sea. They were henceforth obliged to keep a navy for the purpose of maintaining the communication with their possessions out of Italy, and to convey troops, am munition, and provisions to and fro ; but the navy was never looked upon as a tiring of first importance by the Eomans : the service in the fleet was at all times considered less honourable than that in the army ; and the commerce which had been carried on by the Carthaginians, in all parts of the Mediterranean, was not kept up by the Eomans. Eome seems, by this time, to have become conscious of her vocation to be the mistress of the world ; for her great object henceforth was to conquer foreign countries, and to derive from them all the advantages she could. The simplicity and frugality of the good old times were fast dis appearing, and, in then train, the virtues and noble sentiments of former times ; for the gold that was carried to Eome from Sicriy, Spain, and Carthage, exercised a sad influence both upon the public and domestic life of the Eomans, and engendered in the baser natures among them a desire for war, merely for the sake of plunder and rapine. But, notwithstanding ah this, Eome was now at the height of her political power and greatness, and remained there for a long time before the evils the seeds of which had been sown became visible ; for the mighty council of the senate consisted of men 22 Liv. xxix. 16. p 3"], [342, "322 HISTORY OF ROME. trained in the hardships of war, who clung to the principles of the constitution with a tenacity which kept its spirit alive from generation to generation, in a manner to which our own country, England, affords us the most striking parallel. The highest offices of state, which were now no longer confined to a body of privileged patricians, were accessible to all men who had distinguished themselves in war, or could show a long line of illustrious ancestors. We have aheady noticed, that an evil principle had been introduced, inasmuch as wealth also had become one of the great recommendations to the high magistracies. In those families, whose houses had a right to be adorned with the images of then ancestors, a warlike spirit was kept alive, and their members seized upon every opportunity of gaining military distinctions. Hence war followed upon war, and conquest upon conquest. The people themselves, on the other hand, often took up arms with great reluctance ; for these victories and conquests contributed more to increase the lustre of the noble families and the senate, than to add to the happiness and prosperity of the thousands who had to shed their blood in the wars. Another circumstance which compelled Eome to engage in war upon war was her dependence upon her allies in Italy, for whom it was necessary to keep up a succession of wars. Eome, further, like every other military republic, was the natural enemy of those among her neighbours who did not willingly bow to her ; and who was there that could resist the force of arms wielded by such experienced hands, which did not rest until then enemy lay prostrate ? Who that could resist a system of policy, which, without regard to right and justice, employed every means that could be devised, cunning, fraud, flattery, and violence, for the purpose of ensnaring its victims ? The Hannibalkn war had made the Eoman name known far and wide, so that foreign princes became anxious to form connec tions or affiances with Eome. Hostile collisions, however, were sure to follow. And Eome, with all her martial spirit, could not have become the mistress of the world, had it not been for the"], [343, "RELATIONS TO FOREIGN NATIONS. 323 nature and condition of the states themselves, which came in con tact with Eome, either as friends or as foes. It is a truth well established both by ancient and modern history, that states whose institutions have become obsolete, or are in opposition to the spirit of the age, or have lost their moral vigour and energy, gradually decay in themselves, or are overthrown by such external powers as are in full bloom or development. The states which had grown out of the vast monarchy of Alexander the Great, Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt, as well as Greece itself, were in this predicament, and after once coming in contact with all absorbing Eome were unable for any length of time to resist the power of her arms. Ptolemaeus Philadelphus had concluded an affiance with Eome as early as B.C. 273 :23 in B.C. 201, the Eoman senate was ap pointed guardian of young Ptolemaeus Epiphanes, in order to put an end to the disturbances and confusion in the kingdom of Egypt, which were fostered and nourished by the vices of its rulers. Macedonia, which was hostile towards Egypt, had lost the vigour and energy by which it had risen ; and Syria, which was now governed by Antiochus III. or the Great, was fast hastening towards the fate of all eastern monarchies ; so that, notwithstanding its affiance with Macedonia, it was unable to resist the policy and the arms of Bome as soon as they began to be directed towards it. The Greek republics were pressed down by the Macedonian kings, who aimed at the supremacy in Greece ; and they were further weakened by internal dissensions and convulsions, no less than by the inroads of the Gallic hordes. Most of the Greeks were devoid of republican virtues, though proud of those of then- ances tors, and the majority sought comfort and recreation by plunging into the enjoyment of sensual pleasures. The Achaeans, who had gained some insight into the evil consequences of the internal divisions of Greece, had formed a league, by which they hoped to restore order and peace among themselves ; but they were opposed by another league, formed by the Aetolians, who were 23 Liv. Epit. 14; Eutrop. ii. 15."], [344, "324 HISTORY OF ROME. more distinguished for then warlike and predatory spirit than for then love of peace and order. Both leagues had one object in common, the defence of Greece against the encroachments of Macedonia ; but the difference of then nationalities soon produced jealousy and enmity, which enabled the Eomans to make use of the Aetolians against the Achaeans, who in then turn entered into an affiance with Macedonia. The kingdom of Bergamus, in Asia Minor, was then governed by Attalus I., who was an ally of Eome at the time when Eome and Macedonia were at war with each other. This state of affairs in the east rendered it possible for Bome to call forth wars in those countries whenever it suited her inter ests. The republic of Bhodes, whose navy, commerce, arts, and intellectual culture were in the most flourishing condition, was likewise allied with Eome, and of great service to her in her wars with the eastern powers."], [345, "325 CHAPTEE XVIII. WARS AGAINST PHILIP OF MACEDONIA. C FLAM1NINUS PROCLAIMS THE INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE. WARS AGAINST ANTIOCHUS, THE AETOLIANS, GALATIANS, AND THE \"GAULS IN THE NORTH OF ITALY. DEATH OF HANNIBAL AND SCIPIO. There can be no doubt that Demetrius of Pharus, who at the beginning of the Hannibarian war had taken refuge at the court of Philip of Macedonia, had roused the king's apprehension of the growing power of Eome ; and it was unquestionably this apprehension which led the Macedonian to enter into an affiance with the Aetolians; for the Eomans, as we have seen, had aheady gained a firm footing on the eastern coast of the Adriatic after the subjugation of the Hlyrians. In the spring of the year after the battle of Cannae, when Eome's power seemed to be com pletely broken, Philip concluded a treaty with Hannibal, in which the latter agreed to give up to the king all the possessions of the Eomans east of the Adriatic. But as the Macedonian am bassadors, with the document of the treaty, were passing through Apulia on then way to Hannibal at Capua, they fell into the hands of the Eomans, who instead of being discouraged by the additional power thus acquired by then conqueror, displayed a tndy heroic spirit, and sent the praetor M. Valerius Laevinus with a fleet of 50 sail to Tarentum, whence he crossed over to Ulyricum. The first Macedonian war, which was thus commenced in B.c. 215, lasted till B.C. 205; but it was slovenly conducted by the Eomans as well as by Philip, the latter not exerting all the powers he had at his command, and the former being obliged to direct their main force against Carthage. In the beginning of this war, the Eomans took Oricum, and"], [346, "326 HISTORY OF ROME. Apollonia also fell into their hands, Philip who besieged it being put to flight.1 After this, the king made some progress in Uly ricum, and conquered Atintania and the Ardyaeans, but was still unable to afford any assistance to Hannibal in Italy : by his mis trust, cruelty, and arbitrary proceedings, he also lost the confidence of his airies, who, in consequence, were easily prevailed upon to join the Eomans. When, therefore, in B.C. 211, Capua had been recovered by the Eomans, the Aetolians deserted the cause of Philip, and entered into an affiance with Eome, in which it was stipulated, that all the places that might be conquered by their united forces should be treated in such a manner, that the towns and the soil should belong to the Aetolians, and the inhabitants with all their moveable property to the Eomans. It was through the mediation of the Aetolians that the Eomans also entered into connections with king Attalus I. of Pergamus, and other princes and states. Greece was sprit into parties, but the con duct of the Aetolians drew so much odium on themselves as well as on the Eomans, that Philip again began to be looked upon by the Greeks as their natural protector. He went from LUyricum to the assistance of the Achaeans, who were hard pressed by the Spartan Machanidas. The Eomans in the meantime con trived to foster discord among the Greeks, with the view of avail ing themselves of favourable opportunities as they might occur for establishing their influence in Greece ; but their attempt to gain a footing in Peloponnesus failed, Philip maintaining himself so successfully against the Aetolians, that, unsup ported as they were by the Eomans, they were obliged to sue for peace. It was granted to them in B.C. 207, on rather humili ating terms. After this a Eoman army of 10,000 men, and a fleet of 35 sail, landed at Dyn-hachium ; but the Epirots were tired of the vexatious war, and brought about a peace between the Eomans and Philip in B.C. 205. The Eomans gave up Atin tania, and allowed Philip to establish himself in Epirus. But neither party had any honest intention in the conclusion 1 Liv. sxiv. 40."], [347, "WARS WITH MACEDONIA. 327 of this peace. The Eomans, in particular, were only waiting for an opportiurity of recovering that which they had given up in the peace ; while Philip, on the other hand, notwithstanding the peace, secretly supported the Carthaginians in then war with Eome, both with money and with troops : hence, in the battle of Zama, many Macedonians who served in the Carthaginian army were taken prisoners by the Eomans. Philip, about the same time, formed an alliance with king Antiochus of Syria, the object of which was to rob Egypt of her possessions on the coasts of Thrace and Asia. This led to a war with the Ehodians and Attalus, whose interest it was to protect the possessions of Egypt ; but Philip and Antiochus gained their end. The former conquered the wliole of the Thracian coast, so that his power and influence now extended from Thrace to the island of Crete. Athens was at that time in a state of decay, and its inhabitants were impoverished, but it was allied with Bome. Some Acarna nians had impiously presumed to violate the mysteries of De meter at Eleusis, and being discovered were put to death by the exasperated multitude. This induced the Acamanians, and Philip then ally, to march against Athens and take vengeance for the outrage. A body of Macedonians ravaged the territory of Athens, and kid siege to the city. The distressed Athenians implored the protection of Bome, which thus obtained a welcome pretext for renewing the war with Philip. The senate, and the ambitious nobles at Bome, desired nothing so much as the renewal of hostilities ; the people, who were suffering severely from the consequences of the Hannibarian war, rejected the scheme of a fresh military undertaking. The ruling party, however, gained then object notwithstanding, and the second war against Macedonia was decided upon in B.C. 200; for an em bassy which had been sent to Philip to request him to abstain from hostilities towards Athens had no effect, and the Boman people were made to believe that Philip, if he were not checked, might become a second Hannibal. This war, which lasted till B.C. 197, broke the power of Macedonia, and laid the foundation of the Bomau"], [348, "328 HISTORY OF ROME. dominion in the east. As it had been determined to attack the enemy in his own country, the consul P. Sulpicius Galba, B.C. 200, led his army across the Adriatic ; and having spent the winter at Apollonia, he opened his campaign in the spring of the year following. Philip, who was at the time in Asia, hastened back to Europe, defeated the Athenians, and marched into Thessaly, where he maintained himself against the Athamanians, Dardanians, and Aetolians, who had again joined the Eomans and had invaded Thessaly. The Eomans gained little or no ad- vantage. Towards the end of the year Sulpicius Galba was succeeded by Viffius Tappulus, but he too was unable to make any progress. In B.C. 198, however, matters began to assume a different aspect, for T. Quinctius Flamininus, who was then consul, and had received the Macedonian war as his province, hastened at the beginning of the year into Greece. He was then scarcely thirty-three years old, but he was a skilful and vigorous commander, and a statesman who understood the art of deceiving all parties. The Macedonian fortresses on the frontier were strongly fortified, and then main camp was near Antigoneia, a position which to attack was most perilous to the enemy. Flami ninus saw that everything was hopeless in that district, and was on the point of marching away, when an Epirot chief of the name of Charopus sent him a guide, who led a corps of 4000 Eomans round a dangerous mouutain-pass into the rear of the Mace donians. As soon as they arrived at the point of then destina tion, a signal was given, and the Macedonians were at once attacked both in the front and in the rear. Philip, perceiving that his retreat woidd soon be cut off, quitted his post, and marched with his army across the mountains into Thessaly, which was invaded by the Aetolians. Flamininus in the meantime penetrated further into Epirus, where all the towns threw then gates open to him. He then proceeded to Phocis, made himself master of Ektea, and took up his winter quarters. King Attalus, the Ehodians, and the Boman fleet, were in the Aegean sea. The Achaeans had been in affiance with Philip, and"], [349, "BATTLE OF CYNOSCEPHALAE. 329 if at this moment he had consented to give up Corinth to them, they would not have abandoned his cause ; but as it was, they now deserted him, and joined the Eomans, even before the taking of Elatea, although they hated the Eomans no less than the Aetolians, on account of the miseries which Laevinus had in flicted on the Greeks in the first war against Macedonia. Fla mininus appeared also before the gates of Thebes, and compelled the Boeotians to enter into an affiance with Bome. Thus strengthened, the Eomans gained possession of the whole of southern Thessaly, which now became the scene of the war. About the month of June, B.C. 197, the Eomans and Mace donians met each other in the neighbourhood of Scotussa, a dis trict which, from a line of small hills, had obtained the name of Cynoscephake (Dogs'-heads). After some delay and hesitation on both sides, a battle ensued, in which the Macedonian pha lanx was crushed by the more pliable legions of the Eomans. The Aetorian cavariy, however, decided the contest:2 8000 Macedonians fell on the field of battle, and 5000 were taken prisoners. Philip, who had now lost all confidence in the success of his military operations, fled to Larissa, and thence to Tempe, where he began to negotiate for peace. Flamininus, who feared lest his laurels should be snatched from him by a successor, and perceived the ill-feeling towards the Eomans which prevailed among the Aetolians, hastened to conclude a peace on the follow ing terms : Philip was to restore all the Greek towns to inde pendence, and to withdraw his garrisons from them ; he was to deliver up his fleet, with the exception of five ships ; he was not to be allowed to keep more than 500 heavy-armed soldiers; he was to pay 1000 talents, 500 at once, and 500 by ten annual instal ments; and, lastly, he was to give hostages, among whom his own son Demetrius. The object of Flamininus, in concluding this peace, was not to destroy Macedonia, but to establish in Greece a state of things in which the powers of the several states should be evenly 2 Polyb. xviii. 5."], [350, "330 HISTORY OF ROME. balanced. The Aetolians, on the other hand, wished that Mace donia should be completely crushed ; and they insisted the more strongly upon the necessity of it, because they knew that the victory over the Macedonians had been maiidy owing to them selves. The unfortunate consequences resulting to the Aetolians from this feeling became but too soon manifest. The object of Eome in the war against Philip was now gained, for the Macedonians were driven out of Greece, their power was broken, and they were re duced to a state from which Eome had nothing to fear. Various expectations had been entertained as to the manner in which Bome would make use of her victory in regard to Greece ; but whatever may have been the motives of her policy, Flamininus, at least, seems to have acted from a sincere love and admiration of the Greeks. At the Isthmian games, in B.C. 196, he pro claimed the freedom and independence of all the Greek cities and islands which had been under the dominion of Macedonia : the multitude, intoxicated 'with joy, saluted him as the restorer of then freedom; and their shouts of delight and applause were so loud and so often repeated, that it was evident, that among all the blessings of human life the people valued none higher than then freedom. When the festive games were over, immense crowds gathered round then liberator, ribbons and flowers were showered upon him on all sides, and the pressure was so great that even his life was in danger. Flamininus and his army remained in Peloponnesus for some years, partly for the purpose of observing the movements of the Aetolians and of Antiochus, and partly for the purpose of regu lating, in conjunction with ten Eoman commissioners, the affairs of Greece. Corinth was restored to the Achaeans, but the Eomans kept possession of the fortresses of Acrocorinthus, Chalcis, and Demetrias, until matters with Antiochus should be settled. Thessaly became an independent republic : the Orestians, inha biting a part of Macedonia, from which they had revolted, re ceived a republican constitution.

Some symptoms of the evil policy of Eome, however, appeared in the fact, that Eumenes, the son of Attalus, was left in the possession of Aegina, and also received the towns of Oreum and Eretria : it was a part of the same selfish and dishonest policy which, in B.C. 195, after war had been decreed against Nabis the cruel tyrant of Sparta, and after Flamininus had compelled him to surrender Argos, led the Eomans to conclude a peace with him, in which he was left in the possession of his dominions, in order that the Achaeans might always have an enemy in then immediate neighbourhood. Greece thus could not enjoy any long and refreshing peace. It cannot be denied, for the subsequent history proves it incon testably, that Bome fostered dissensions among the Greeks, in order to have opportunities of acting as arbitrator among them : a Boman party also was gradually formed in many parts of Greece, which was busily engaged to further the schemes of Eome, the influence of which soon became visible throughout the country. In addition to this, the Eomans knew but too well that there was no reason for fearing too great an unanimity of the Greeks, or any hearty or permanent co-operation of the different states. In the summer of B.C. 194, Flamininus, having completed his regulations in Greece, returned to Eome in triumph. Antiochus had formed an affiance with Philip as early as B.C. 202, in consequence of which he had made himself master of the possessions of Egypt in western Asia. He afterwards in vaded Asia Minor, and at the time when Flamininus proclaimed the independence of Greece, it was demanded by the Eomans that Antiochus too should restore freedom to all the Greek cities in Asia; but he replied that the Eomans had no right to interfere in the affairs of Asia. After having spent the winter at Ephesus, he advanced in B.C. 196 as far as the Hellespont, and took posses sion of the Thracian Chersonesus, which he claimed on the ground of its having been conquered by one of his ancestors. He there fortified the deserted town of Lysimachia, an act"], [352, "332 HISTORY OF ROME. which still more provoked the jealousy of the Eomans. They declared to him, several times, that every attempt on his part to make conquests in Europe would be looked upon as an act of hostility towards Eome. While these things were going on in the east, Hannibal had been obliged to quit his country in B.C. 196,3 partly in con sequence of the intrigues of Bome, and partly through the hostility of the party opposed to him and his family, which he had exaspe rated by the abolition of a number of abuses in the administration of his country. He had introduced a series of salutary reforms, by which he had hoped to restore Carthage to strength and vigour ; but his plans were thwarted, and he now took refuge in the kingdom of Antiochus, whom he hoped to inspire with courage to cany on the war against Eome with vigour and energy, and for that purpose to enter into an alliance with Egypt and Mace donia. It was fortunate for Eome that Antiochus was not able to appreciate the advice which the great Carthaginian gave him, and was even led to suspect his honesty. These circumstances, and the fact that the Eomans were at that time engaged in Spain and against the Boians and Insubrians in the north of Italy, delayed the outbreak of the war for some years. In B.C. 193, the Aetolians, dissatisfied in the highest degree with the results of the war of the Eomans against Philip, and being disappointed in then hope of the rewards which they thought they had a right to expect,4 invited Antiochus to come over into Greece. They thought that with the assistance of a king whose empire extended from the Hellespont to the frontiers of India, no power would be able to resist them. Antiochus himself was a haughty and presumptuous man, who by no means deserves the surname of the Great with which history has honoured him ; and his empire, though immense in extent, was as weak as that of the Persians had been of old. The Greek colonies in xVsk also had become effeminate and unwarlike. 3 Corn. Nep. Hannib. 7. Livy, xxxiii. 45, places the flight of Hannibal one year later. 4 Polyb. xviii. 28."], [353, "WAR WITH ANTIOCHUS. 333 In the same year, B.C. 192, in which Antiochus, on the invita tion of the Aetolians, crossed over into Europe, and but a short time before his arrival in Greece, the Eomans, under C. Flami ninus, in conjunction with the Achaeans, and for their protection, carried on a war against Nabis of Sparta, who was defeated : the district of the Eleuthcrokcones was detached from Lace daemon; and Nabis was to pay 400 talents by instalments of 50 talents in the course of eight years, and to restore Argos to the Achaeans. The feeling of the Greeks towards the Eomans was, in many parts of the country, very hostile, although the Boman garrisons were now withdrawn from the three fortresses of Acro corinthus, Chalcis, and Demetrias : all Greece was, in fact, divided into two parties, the one being against, and the other in favour of Eome ; nay, there was scarcely one province in Greece in which the people were honestly attached to Eome, and all would, perhaps, have openly declared against her, had it not been repugnant to their feelings to make common cause with the Aetolians. Under such circumstances Antiochus landed at Demetrias in Thessaly with a small army, for he had been too impatient to wait for the arrival of his forces from the interior of Asia. From Demetrias he proceeded to Euboea, where he took possession of the fortified towns. In Boeotia, where the feeling against Bome was strongest, his arrival was hailed with the greatest enthusiasm. But both Antiochus and the Aetolians soon found themselves disappointed in their expectations ; for the Aetolians had hoped that the king would land in Greece with an overwhelming army, and the king had anticipated to be sup ported by the Aetolians with greater forces than they had at then command : the hope also of a general rise of the Greeks, which the Aetolians had held out to Antiochus, was not realised, although the king penetrated into Thessaly and Acamania. In B.C. 191, the consid M. Acilius Glabrio advanced into Thessaly; and, having united his forces with those of Philip, he proceeded southward. Antiochus and the Aetolians retreated to Ther mopylae. The Aetolians occupied the heights ; and no sooner"], [354, "334 HISTORY OF ROME. were they chased from then position by the legate M. Porcius Cato, than the whole army of Antiochus took to fright. The king made for Chalcis, where he had spent the preceding winter in sensual pleasures. But he soon quitted that place also, and returned to Asia Minor, where he gave orders for a general levy throughout his vast empire. In consequence of the failure at Thermopylae, the Aetolians were obliged to sue for peace, which was willingly granted them by the Eomans, because they were anxious to secure themselves in their rear, that they might be able to prosecute the war against Antiochus in Asia without being disturbed by the hostilities of the Aetolians. Philip was accordingly ordered to abstain from hostilities against them, in order that he too might have no pretext for extending Iris influence or dominion in Greece. He, therefore, returned to Macedonia ; and not taking any part in the war against Antiochus, he made some conquests in Athamania and in the country of the Dolopians. Antiochus thought himself perfectly safe in Asia, and it was only on the suggestion of Hannibal that he kept possession of the Thracian Chersonesus. A Eoman fleet, about half of which was furnished by the Bhodians, was cruising in the meantime in the Aegean. Hannibal was intrusted with the command of a Phoenician fleet, but was unable to join that of Antiochus, which was commanded by Polyxenidas. The Eomans, who were further assisted by king Eumenes of Pergamus, gained a victory over the fleet of Antiochus, and destroyed nearly the whole of it. Antiochus, who was thrown into the utmost consternation by this defeat, gave up the Chersonesus, and the fortresses of Lysimachia, Sestos, and Abydos, with all the ammunition and provisions which they contained, and retreated to Sardes, where he spent the winter. The Eoman consuls of the year B.C. 190 were L. Cornelius Scipio and C. Laehus. The former, a brother of the conqueror of Hannibal, though having as yet given little proof of any extraordinary talent, obtained the command against Antiochus through the influence of his brother, who, in order to make up"], [355, "BATTLE OF MAGNESIA. 335 for the deficiency of Lucius, accompanied him to Asia in the subordinate capacity of legate. The Scipios arrived in Asia with an army of about 20,000 men, while that of Antiochus consisted of 70,000 : no sooner had they landed, than they were met by the ambassadors of the king to sue for peace ; but as the haughty Syrian refused to accept the terms proposed by Scipio, the matter was left to the decision of a battle, which was fought in the neighbourhood of Magnesia, at the foot of Mount Sipylus. The motley host of Antiochus, notwithstanding his elephants and the Macedonian phalanx, was unable to resist the Eoman legions ; and the latter gained a decisive victory. They were commanded by L. Scipio alone, either because his brother was ill, or because he would not take part in the contest, and Lucius thus gained for himself the honourable surname of Asiaticus. Antiochus fled to Syria, and sent ambassadors to the Eoman consul to sue for peace, which was granted to him on the following terms, which, however, were not ratified at Eome till the year B.C. 188 : Anti ochus was to give up to Eome all his dominions in Asia Minor west of Mount Taurus ; to abstain from interfering with the affairs of the Eoman allies in Europe ; to give up all his ships of war and keep no more than ten merchant vessels ; to keep no elephants; to raise no mercenaries in any of the countries allied with Eome; to pay down 2500 talents at once, and afterwards 12,000 more by instalments of 1000 a year ; to deliver up Hannibal, Thoas, and other enemies of Bome who had taken refuge in his dominions ; and lastly to give his younger son Antiochus as a hostage to the Eomans. All conditions were complied with; but Hannibal escaped, and continued for some years longer to be Eome's formidable enemy. When the king had consented to these terms, L. Scipio took his winter quarters at Magnesia, on the Maeander. The power of the Syrian empire was thus broken for ever : it was weakened, not only by the loss of the countries which it had been obliged to give up to Bome, but by the relation of dependence into which it entered with Bome ; for just as Carthage"], [356, "336 HISTORY OF ROME. had an ever-watchful and treacherous neighbour in Masinissa, so Antiochus was under the vigilant eye of Eumenes of Pergamus and the Ehodians, both of whom were ever ready to further the ambitious ends of Eome. Eumenes was rewarded, for the services he had rendered to Eome, with the Thracian Chersonesus, Phrygia, Mysia, Lydia, Lycaonia, and the towns of Ephesus, Tralles, and Terinessus : a few of the Greek cities on the coast of Asia Minor were honoured with immunities, and an increase of then territories; and the Ehodians received Lycia and Caria as far as the river Maeander.5 As yet the Eomans would rather give away kingdoms than rule over them : they were satisfied with the feeling that they were the conquerors, and that they had fought (for such was then vaunting pretence) for the independence of then- airies, and of the Greeks. In B.C. 189, the year after the conclusion of the peace, the consid Cn. Manlius Vulso succeeded Scipio in Asia, while his colleague, M. Fulvius, went into Aetoria, for in the western parts of the empire peace was pretty well restored. The Aetolians endeavoured to make amends for their conduct ; but it was in vain that they reminded Eome of the services which they had done to her in former times, for it was not till they had sent three different embassies that peace was granted them, at the time when M. Fulvius was besieging Ambracia. The Eomans were then prevailed upon by the mediation of the Ehodians, and especially by the eloquence of the Athenian Leon. The terms of the peace were as follows : the Aetolians recognised the majesty of the Eoman people; they were to regard the enemies of Eome as their own ; they were not to allow an army of any enemy of the Eoman allies to pass through their country; and they were to pay down at once 200 talents, and 300 more by instalments of 50 every year. While M. Fulvius was thus engaged in Aetoria, his colleague, Manlius Vulso, anxious to do something from which he might derive fame and wealth for himself, made a campaign against the Galatians in Phrygia, where those Gallic tribes had been settled J Liv. xxxviii. 38, &c. ; Polyb. Excerpt, de Leg. xxiv."], [357, "337 WARS AGAINST THE LIGURIANS. for nearly a century, a part of which country bore the name of Galatia, or Gallo-Graecia. During the period of then- settlement in Asia, these Gauls had amassed immense wealth, and had almost become Hellenized, though they still remained very warlike. In affiance with Antiochus, they had attacked Eumenes ; and even after the peace of Eome with Antiochus, they continued then hostilities. The war which Manlius Vulso carried on against them inflicted great sufferings upon the inhabitants of Asia Minor. After a severe defeat which the Gaktkns sustained near Mount Olympus, in Mysia, they were chased by then- conquerors as far as the river Halys. They then sued for peace, which they obtained, on condition of then- abstaining from their predatory excursions, and keeping quiet within then own territory. From this time forward the Gaktkns rived in perfect submission to Eome. Arkrathes, king of Cappadocia, who likewise dreaded an attack of the Eomans, sent the sum of 200 talents along with his request for peace, thus purchasing a peace which he could not otherwise have obtained at so cheap a price. While the Eomans had thus been extending then power in the east with gigantic strides, the peace had been disturbed in the north of Italy by the Ligurians, Insubrians, and Boians, who had been stirred up by a Carthaginian of the name of Hamilcar. The war against them began as early as B.C. 200, and lasted for many years ; but its history is very obscure. Many a small but bloody battle was fought ; for the Ligurian tribes, although poor, defended themselves with such determination, that the Eomans had no choice, but were obliged either to extirpate them or expel them from their mountains. The Eomans gained many a victory, and many a triumph was celebrated ; but it was not till b.c 181 that the consuls, P. Cornelius Cethegus and M. Baebius Tam philus, who marched against the Ligurians with an army of 50,000 men, compelled them to submit to Bome, when a portion of them, the Apuanian Ligurians, with then wives and children, were transplanted to Samnium. In the course of this war the colonies of Placentia and Cremona were entirely destroyed, and I!"], [358, "338 HISTORY OF ROME. the towns which had been inhabited by the Boians experienced a similar fate, so that in after times scarcely then sites were known. The whole people of the Boians seem to have been extirpated, and their country was henceforth occupied by the colonies of Bononia, Modena, Parma, Lucca, and others. After the brilliant campaign of P. Scipio in Spain, the departure of Mago, and the surrender of Gades in B.C. 205, the dominion of Eome seemed to be finally established in Spain. The Eomans kept a standing army there, which usually consisted of two legions, for the purpose of securing the submission of the Spaniards, attempts to shake off the Boman dominion being repeatedly made from time to time. Indibilis, a chief of the Hergeses, and one of the most powerful men in Spain, who had before been in affiance with the Eomans, revolted in B.C. 205, immediately after the departure of Scipio ; but the insurgent was defeated in a pitched battle, and peace was restored for a time. Afterwards, when the Eomans were engaged against the Ligurians and Macedonians, that is, after B.C. 197, the state of affairs in Spain again became unsettled, until order was again restored by the consid M. Porcius Cato, in B.C. 195, who won the hearts and confidence of the Spaniards by the justice with which he acted towards them : what he gained by his humanity and justice he also seemed by his deep cunning. Most of the Spanish towns were strongly fortified, and Cato is said to have sent circulars to the magistrates of a large number of towns, with orders not to open them before a certain day fixed upon by him. Each circular contained the command to raze to the ground the walls of the town to which it had been addressed, and threatened the disobedient with the severest punishments. As there was no time for the towns to communicate with each other, and as each believed itself to be the only one that had received the command, all obeyed, and when they learned the truth it was too late, for the work of destruction was done.6 Henceforth the Spaniards continued to rive in peace, until they were provoked by the 6 Liv. xxxiv. 17 ; Appian, BcReb. Hisp. 41."], [359, "339 DEATH OF HANNIBAL. faithlessness, cruelty, and avarice of then Eoman governors. In B.C. 181 a great war again broke out, in which the Spaniards were joined by the Celtiberians ; but though the Eomans gained several victories, still the Spaniards were never completely reduced, till in B.c. 179, Tib. Sempronius Gracchus, the father of the two great tribunes, concluded treaties of peace with several of the Spanish tribes, the terms of which were so honourable and fair, that the people, with the greatest willingness, kid down their arms. With that kindness and humanity which form so striking a feature in the character of the family of the Gracchi, he gave settlements and homes to the poor among the Spaniards, and conferred such substantial benefits upon them, that for many years his name was remembered among them with the highest gratitude. The establishment of a Eoman colony at Aquileia, in Istria, provoked the Istrians to a desperate resistance. They dreaded the loss of then independence, and a war with them broke out in B.c. 178 ; however, it did not last much longer than one year, for after three of then towns were destroyed, and their king had fallen, they submitted to Eome, in B.C. 177. About the same time Sardinia and Corsica revolted, and showed a desperate determination not to yield ; but the Sardinians were subdued by Tib. Sempronius Gracchus, and the immense number of pri soners that were sold as slaves is said to have given rise to the proverbial expression Sardi venales. After the peace with Antiochus, Hannibal had escaped to Prusias, king of Bithynia, a cunning and greedy but cowardly prince, who was then at war with Eumenes, and whom Hannibal endeavoured to stir up to energetic measures. The Eomans well knew that, so long as Hannibal was alive, it was in vain to hope for peace in the east ; when, therefore, his influence became known at Eome, ambassadors were sent into Asia, and among them C. Flamininus, to demand of Prusias his surrender. The timid king indeed refused to deliver him up, but told the ambassadors where they might seize him. When the Eomans a2"], [360, "340 HISTORY OF ROME. had surrounded his house, and he saw that escape was impossible, he took poison, which he had carried about him for some time, for he foresaw what would be his fate. Thus died one of the greatest men of all ages, B.C. 183.7 His conqueror, P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus, died about the same time. He was accused, in B.C. 187, by M. Porcius Cato, who hated the whole family of the Scipios because they were fond of Greek manners and the Greek mode of living, of having embezzled part of the money which had been paid by king Antiochus ; and he was called upon before the senate to answer the charge, and state why he had not rendered an account of the money that had been taken in the war against the Syrian king. The day on which he was called upon to do this was the anni versary of the battle of Zama : Scipio summoned the people to the Capitol, to offer thanks to Jupiter, and said that the day was ill suited for litigation. The multitude joyfully accompanied him, and his accusers afterwards did not renew their attacks. But Scipio soon after left Bome, and died in his villa at Liternum, perhaps in the same year in which Hannibal died.s The people for many generations believed that his spirit had soared up to the abodes of the gods, and that a serpent of supernatural size guarded the access to his tomb, which was shaded by a myrtle. His brother Lucius was involved in the same charge which had been brought against Publius. Lucius had been willing to defend himself by producing his account-books ; but Publius snatched them from his hands, declaring that it was improper to annoy a man for a trifling sum who had conferred such benefits on the state. Notwithstanding Lucius was condemned, and his property confiscated. He bore his misfortune with truly Boman greatness and resignation. His innocence was afterwards esta blished, and prosperity seemed once more to dawn upon him ; 7 The year of his death however is 8 Some place Scipio's death in B.C. uncertain, for some of the ancients 185, others in B.C. 187, and others placed it one or two years later.

SCIPIO. 341 but he did not rive to enjoy it long, for he died in B.C. 185. Two of the greatest Eomans thus disappeared from the stage of history about the same time : the influence they had exercised upon then age was great for evil as well as for good, although the former did not show its fruits immediately. It is now time to cast a glance at the state of morality among the Eomans, and at their progress in arts and literature."], [362, "342 CHAPTEB XIX. MORALITY AND MANNERS OF THE ROMANS. THE ARTS AND LITERATURE. It is a general belief, both among ancient and modern writers, that after the victories over Macedonia and Antiochus, the love of luxuries, and all the rices that accompany avarice and rapacity, broke in upon the Eomans with irresistible force. The fact that at this time these vices began to manifest themselves in all their hideousness, is indeed true enough ; but those victories were not the cause of the evil ; they only afforded a favourable opportunity for developing that of which the causes lay much deeper. One of the main causes was the general demoralisation which had been brought about by the almost uninterrupted, cruel, and destructive wars. The poor had become utterly impoverished : a middle class scarcely existed at all, and the wealthy had amassed enormous riches, the spoUs of conquered nations. We may form a notion of the treasures conveyed to Bome from the fact, that B. Cornelius Scipio could speak of the sum of 36,000^., which he was charged with having appropriated to himself, as a trifle.1 The enormous wealth which some of the Eomans had acquired suddenly, and without much labour and toil, produced the same effects among them that money generally produces with per sons who unexpectedly become rich, without being previously accustomed to the uses of money. The enjoyments, accordingly, which the Eomans now sought, and in which they attempted to imitate their Greek neighbours, were of a coarse and vulgar kind : the ancient simplicity and frugality in then mode of 1 Liv. xxxviii. 55; Gellius, iv. 18, vii. 19 ; Diodor. Fragm. Vatic, p. 78, ed. Dindorf."], [363, "STATE OF MORALITY AT ROME. 343 living were abandoned, and they gave themselves up to disgust ing gluttony and debauchery. A slave, who was a good cook, now fetched a higher price in the market than any other slave.2 Splendid buildings began to be erected, and luxuries of every description found then way into Bome, supplanting the rustic simplicity of former times. As early as B.C. 215, the tribune C. Oppius had found it necessary to restrain the extravagant luxuries of the Eoman women of rank, by an enactment forbidding any woman to have more than half an ounce of gold, to wear any gay-coloured dress, to ride either at Eome or in any other town and its immediate vicinity in a carriage drawn by two horses, except on great religious occasions.3 Twenty years later, in B.C. 195, the women became very clamorous about this law, and demanded its repeal : it was in vain that Cato, then consul, in a speech addressed to the people, endeavoured to convince them of the salutary nature of the law ; its abolition was at once effected by the exertions of the women. A general licentious ness and moral depravity, especially among females, became still more manifest about nine years later, when it was discovered that the orgies of Bacchus had been introduced into Bome from southern Italy, and were celebrated at night with the grossest violations of all decorum and morality. A strict inquiry was made into the matter : the guilty were punished, and a decree of the senate, under the severest penalties, forbade the solemnisation of these orgies, both at Bome and in all Italy.4 Another example of the morality of these times was exhibited, in B.C. 192, by the consul L. Quinctius Flamininus, the brother of the conqueror of Macedonia. While he was encamped in Cisalpine Gaul, he had with him a Carthaginian youth, to whom he had become attached in a most unnatural manner, and who often lamented that he had never seen a gladiatorial exhibition. Flamininus soon found an 2 Liv. xxxix. 6. 3 Liv. xxxiv. 1, ing the decree of the senate was dis covered in 1640 at Bari, in southern Italy, and is at present preserved in the imperial museum of Vienna. 4 Liv. xxxix. 18; Valer.

Flamininus asked his contemptible favourite, whether he would like to see a Gaul dying, and scarcely had the youth answered in the affirmative, when Flamininus struck the Boian's head with his sword. When the unfortunate man staggered out of the tent to implore the mercy of others, Flamininus ran him through with his sword. No notice was taken of the occurrence, until the year B.C. 184, when Cato, in his censorship, most un sparingly attacked Flamininus for his bmtal conduct on this and other occasions, and ejected him from the senate. It must not, however, be supposed that such moral depravity was as yet very general ; for the cases which we have noticed are rather symptoms of that which was quietly developing itself, than types of the general character of the age, since even fifty years later Polybius saw so much that was excellent in the character of the Eomans that he placed them far above his own countrymen. Nevertheless, embezzlement of the public money, extortions in the provinces, and acts of wanton violence, now began to be of common occur rence. Cato was at this time a singular phenomenon : he was a true representative of the good old times. It was then customary for Eomans of rank and education to derive then- manners and literary tastes from the Greeks ; but Cato formed an exception to this rule, for he despised the Greeks as a corrupt and effeminate race, and it was not till he had far advanced in years that he made himself acquainted with their language and literature. He displayed the greatest activity in all departments of life, both public and private ; and there is scarcely one in which he was not great. But all his exertions to stop the current of coiTuption, and to restore the times of which he himself was a living example, were useless, as all isolated attempts under similar circumstances necessarily are. It has been supposed that Iris conduct was in a great measure mere affectation, but there is"], [365, "STATE OF LITERATURE. 345 no evidence for such an opinion : he was an ancient Eoman in the fullest sense of the word, bent upon seeing the sovereignty of his country established everywhere ; and his somewhat rough and uncouth manners formed a strange contrast with the foreign customs adopted by his contemporaries. With regard to religion, superstition of a very gross kind con tinued to form one of the principal features in the character of the Eomans, though it was at one time more prominent than at others. Even human sacrifices were not entirely abolished. The auguries and auspices, a welcome leading-string for the people in the hands of the high magistrates of the republic, continued to be observed as before, and exercised the greatest influence upon all public affairs ; but the ancient piety and the reverence for the gods gradually disappeared, and the sacrifices and festivals, which had formerly been celebrated in honour of the gods with rustic simplicity, now served more as amusements and shows for the multitude, which became the more pompous as the people became more and more accustomed to splendour and magnificence. The higher and educated class began to show symptoms of scepticism, and a disbelief in the efficacy of the religious rites ; and from this time we not unfrequently meet with instances of an open dis regard of the ordinances of religion. The Greek worship had gradually become established at Eome as in the rest of Italy, and the ancient gods of the land were forgotten, or identified with those recently imported. There is good reason for believing that the Eomans, and Italians generally, were acquainted with the arts and literature of the Greeks, long before any conquests had been made beyond the Adriatic. This is evident from the works of art that have been and are still discovered in Umbria and Etruria, and from the remains of theatres, such as that of Tusculum, which was probably built long before the second Punic war, and which presupposes the performance of dramas either of Greek or Italian growth. But the first symptoms of the dawn of a Latin literature did not appear until the close of the first Punic war. The first produc- 0.3"], [366, "346 HISTORY OF ROME. tions were almost servile translations, or imitations of Greek models. A national literature, such as might be considered the spontaneous and peculiar growth of the Boman mind, was never developed at Eome ; the elements, indeed, existed, but they were not permitted to grow by reason of the predominant influence which Greek literature acquired among the Eomans. The ancient Eoman poetry, of which only a faint echo has reached our times, and its old-fashioned Satumian metre, fell into oblivion from the time that Q. Ennius (born in B.C. 239) introduced the Greek hexameter into Latium. The influence exerted by the example of Ennius was supported by the strong predilection which all the illustrious Eomans, as for example the Scipios, had for everything Greek, and which the patriotic spirit of a Cato, who looked upon this foreign influence as dangerous both to pubh'c and private virtue, was unable to check in its rapid increase. A new channel was thus opened for poetry among the Eomans, and the ancient one was abandoned and forgotten. The earliest Latin poet that we meet with is Livius Andronicus. He is said to have been a native of Tarentum, who was carried to Eome as a slave, but was afterwards emancipated. He made an abridgment of the Homeric Odyssey in the Satumian metre, and composed tragedies, which, like the Atellanae or ancient national comedies of the Italians, were performed on scaffoldings in the Circus. These dramas, however, were imitations of Greek models, the first of which was produced at Eome in B.C. 240. 5 Cn. Naevius, who served in the first Punic war, and seems to have been a poet of great talent, wrote comedies and tragedies of a similar kind, as well as, in the ancient metre, a poem on the first Punic war.6 He died in B.C. 203, in exile at Utica, because he had offended some Eoman nobles, especially the family of the Metelli.7 Q. Ennius, who was bom at Budiae, near Tarentum, in B.C. 239, wrote tragedies and comedies, and in hexameter verse a work called Annales, in which he related the events of Eoman * Cicero, Brut. 18, Be Senect. 14; 6 Gellius, I. c, v. 12. Gelliu6, xvii. 21. 7 Cicero, Brut. 15."], [367, "STATE OF LITERATURE. 347 history from the earliest times, but more particularly the war against Hannibal, which for this reason occupied the greater part of the poem. He was a Boman citizen, and rived on terms of intimacy with the most distinguished men of his time. M. Accius Plautus, born at Sarsinae in Umbra in B.C. 227, gained the greatest eminence as a comic poet and actor : his twenty plays, still extant, are free imitations of the Greek comic writers ; they abound in wit, his characters are drawn in a masterly manner, and the plot is always managed with the greatest skill and cleverness. Plautus has often been undervalued, but a sound and unbiassed critical examination has shown, and ever will show, that he was one of the few real poetical geniuses of whom Bome can boast. M. Pacuvius, a nephew of Ennius, was born at Tarentum, in B.C. 221 : he likewise distinguished himself in dramatic poetry, in which he took Aeschylus and Sophocles for his models. Terentius, who was born in B.C. 195, and whose most active period accordingly belongs to a somewhat later time than that of which we are now speaking, was a worthy suc cessor of Plautus. He is said to have been a Carthaginian slave, but to have been restored to freedom by his Boman master. It is certain that he became the intimate friend of P. Cornelius Scipio the younger, and of C. Laelius, and that he produced a number of comedies, which though inferior to those of Plautus in wit and originality, are refined and tasteful imitations of the works of Menander and other Greek poets. If to these names we add those of other poets whose productions may have been of less merit, but are now lost, such as Caecilius Statius, Afra nius, L. Attius, and L. Pomponius, it must be owned that during the period after the first Punic war, poetry, and more especially the drama, was at Eome thriving most luxuriantly, while in Greece real poetry was dying fast away. But these splendid beginnings did not lead to any great results, for the Eomans, generally speaking, remained mere imitators of the Greeks ; and then ordinary pursuits of war led them to admire more the gladiatorial games of the Circus, than the sublime conceptions of"], [368, "348 HISTORY OF ROME. the dramatic muse, whence tragedy never acquired any popularity among the Eomans. The earliest Latin prose writers were chroniclers or annalists, who related the history of then country, from year to year, with little regard to any internal connection among the events, and probably with still less attention to beauty of style in then nar rations. The first we meet with is Q. Fabius Pictor, a Eoman senator, who distinguished himself, in B.C. 225, in the war against the Gaids, and was sent as ambassador to Delphi in the second Punic war. He is frequently censured by Polybius for Iris par tiality towards his native country. Many of his successors, such as L. Cincius Alimentus, Numerius Fabius Pictor, Albums, Cn. Aufidius, wrote then- annals in the Greek language, probably with the view of rendering them intelligible to the Greeks, and proving to them that the history of Eome was not unworthy of their atten tion. The first who raised the art of writing history to some thing like the dignity which it ought to occupy, was the indefa tigable M. Cato, who wrote a work entitled \"Origines,\" containing a history of Eome and Italy, in which he gave an account of the origin of the various cities of Italy. It carried the history down to the year b.c. 150. This work, with those of the earlier chroniclers, unfortunately is lost ; and all that has come down to us of them consists of a few isolated fragments. The cultivation of public oratory is inseparably connected with a free government : it was therefore practised at Eome from very early times ; but the science of the art did not keep pace with its practical application to the purposes of public rife, since it was to Greek rhetoricians that the Eomans applied for the principles of the art. These Greek rhetoricians were very popular at Eome notwithstanding then being regarded by the government, and by a few men of the old school, as persons who corrupted the virtues of the stern Eomans. The same class of foreigners also gave the Eomans a taste for philosophical speculation ; and when, in b.c 155, the Athenians sent an embassy to Eome, consisting of the three philosophers, Carneades, Diogenes, and Critokus, then"], [369, "ARTS AND SCIENCES. 349 influence became so great with the young Eoman nobles, that Cato carried a decree ordering them forthwith to quit the city. But then removal could not prevent the study of philosophy ; and the doctrines of the Stoics gradually acquired a considerable influence among the best men of the republic, while those of the Epicureans foimd zealous advocates among persons of rank and wealth. Legal knowledge and skill form one of the characteristics of the Eomans, from the earliest down to the latest times. Jurispru dence was cultivated by all their statesmen, in connection with then offices in the state, the duties of which they could not have discharged without an accurate knowledge of legal and constitu tional affairs ; and every Eoman youth of education learned the laws of the twelve tables, the groundwork of the whole Eoman law, by heart. The medical art seems to have been originally confined to surgery, and the practices of the priests of Aesculapius; but in B.c. 219, the Greek physician, Archagathus, came to Eome and there established the first medical shop (medicina), with baths and wards, to which the sick resorted for the purchase of then medicines.8 The shops of the physicians, like those of the barbers, were the common resort for loungers of every description, who there assembled and talked over the news of the day. Astronomy had been studied chiefly for superstitious purposes, but the most remarkable phenomena in the heavens seem to have been recorded from early times. The most ancient account of an eclipse of the moon being predicted with accuracy occurs in the year B.C. 168, just before the battle of Pydna. It was foretold by C. Sulpicius Gallus, a man very familiar with Greek learning and literature, who announced it in order that the soldiers might not be frightened by its occurrence. The love of works of art had by this time greatly increased among the Eomans ; but Bome, nevertheless, cannot boast of having ever produced an artist that could be mentioned along with any of the great masters in Greece, except, perhaps, in the f Plin. Hist. Nat. xxix. 6."], [370, "350 HISTORY OF ROME. department of architecture. As Eoman painters of some cele brity, we may mention Fabius Pictor, and the poet Pacuvius. The fondness for the arts among the Eomans was chiefly displayed in then carrying to Bome and to then villas whatever they could collect in the conquered countries, which they deprived, not only of then freedom, but also of their ornaments. When we trace these robberies, in which the most splendid productions of Grecian art were dragged to Eome from Sicily, Greece, and Asia Minor, and then remember the barbarous conduct of some of the Eoman conquerors, who, far from having any sense or appreciation of the precious treasures they were amassing, treated them in a manner worthy only of barbarians, and mistook a tasteless pomp and gorgeous display for taste and refinement, we may indeed won der at the overwhelming power of Eome, before which every other human power was obliged to bow ; but we cannot help lamenting the fate of the nations that had to bear the yoke of such rulers, and we can console ourselves only by the thought, that without Eome's intervention, still fewer remnants of ancient art would have reached our time, and that this was the chosen way of Providence, through which a better state of things was gradu ally prepared. The Eomans never were a commercial nation, but as then population and dominion, and, along with them, then wants and luxuries, also increased, the number of merchants, and the extent of their transactions, must have increased in proportion. In the earliest times all commerce and trade had been left to the clients, slaves, and foreigners, as such occupations were thought degrading to a Boman citizen : but about the time of the second Punic war and afterwards, persons even of the highest rank, more especially the equites, did not scruple to engage in extensive commercial enterprises. The equites were, for the most part, wealthy capi talists ; and these persons carried on usury in the provinces, where then profits were much larger than at Bome, because the rate of interest in the former was not regulated by any law : in like manner they purchased corn in distant countries and carried it to"], [371, "COMMERCE AND AGRICULTURE. 351 Eome, where they sold it often at a very high price. Even Cato, who was otherwise a zealous upholder of the ancient Eoman manners is said to have carried on a lucrative trade in well-trained slaves. But, notwithstanding all this, trade, and more especially all retail trade, continued to be looked upon as unworthy of a Boman, and remained, on the whole, in the hands of the lower classes, especially foreigners and slaves. Agriculture, which had been the foundation of Bome's great ness, remained for a long time the only honourable occupation of free-born Eomans, but by-and-by they were taught by their foreign conquests that it was easier to enrich themselves by the plunder of war than by toil and labour in the field. Hence the ancient pursuits were gradually abandoned to slaves, who now cultivated the extensive estates of then masters, and rendered it impossible for the small landowners, who had been a most useful and respectable body of men, to compete with them. This change in the mode of rife was also one of the principal causes of the decline and corruption of the ancient manners, which ever since the time of the first Punic war had become more and more depraved. The many laws that were enacted after that war, for the purpose of enforcing a better moral conduct, are a sufficient proof that corruption was spreading, even if there were no other evidence. The manners of the people, indeed, became, in some measure, polished and refined by their intercourse with the Greeks, but that refinement was a mere outward tinsel, since in spirit the Eomans became more barbarous, greedy, and cruel, by the succession of prosperous wars. At home the same spirit was fostered by the frequent gladiatorial exlribitions, which after being introduced in B.C. 264 rapidly increased in popularity, and became an ordinary amusement at the burial of wealthy persons, even of women. Such funeral games were usually combined with feasting the people, a distribution of meat or corn being made among them.9 The new refinement manifested itself chiefly in the effeminacy of private life, in the indulgence in Greek and \u2022 Liv. xli. 28."], [372, "352 HISTORY OF ROME. Asiatic luxuries, in costliness of dresses, in the number and quality of slaves, in precious furniture and the luxuries of the table, all which the Eomans indulged in as much as barbarians usually do when once they become acquainted with the manners of civilised life. On the other hand, avarice and prodigality, and cruelty towards conquered nations and slaves, increased no less among private persons than in the government ; and yet Livy says10 that all this was scarcely the first symptom of the future corruption. lu xxxix. 6."], [373, "353 CHAPTEE XX. WARS AGAINST PERSEUS OF MACEDONIA AND GENTHIUS, KING OF ILLYRICUM. AEMrLIUS PAULUS IN GREECE AND EPIRCS ROME'S CONDUCT TOWARDS EGYPT AND RHODES, AND HER RELATION TO OTHER STATES. \u2014 EVENTS DOWN TO THE BREAKING OUT OF THE THIRD PUNIC WAR. In the meantime things had been going on in Greece which again brought Eome and Macedonia into hostile collision. As long as the Eomans were engaged against Antiochus, and in want of assistance, they treated Philip of Macedonia with appa rent liberality, though in fact they never trusted him ; and he, on the other hand, being well aware of the nature of Eoman policy, made great exertions to revive and increase the power of Iris kingdom. He was the more active in this respect, as he did not derive from the Syrian war those advantages which he had expected. In Thessaly and Athamania he made some conquests ; and he increased his anny beyond what was permitted him by the terms of his peace with Eome. The Eomans at first connived at these proceedings, but at the same time contrived in secret to prepare the way for his destruction. The Greek cities in Thrace, of which also Philip had made himself master, and the timid Eumenes of Pergamus, sent embassies to Eome to complain of the king's conduct. Their appearance was very welcome to the Eomans, and commissioners were forthwith sent out to inquire into the proceedings of Philip. They treated him in a very humi liating manner, and ordered him to evacuate all the places beyond the ancient boundaries of his kingdom.1 Philip, exasperated at this command, told the Eomans, that as justice could not be 1 Liv. xxix. 23, &c. ; Polyb. xxiii. 4."], [374, "354 HISTORY OF ROME. obtained from them he should be obliged to seek it by other means. The Boman senate now openly and gladly listened to any charges that were brought against the king, whom they regarded as an obstinate horse that must be compelled by severer means than the bit. But in order to avert the danger which threatened to burst upon him before he was sufficiently prepared, Philip sent to Eome his younger son, Demetrius, a noble youth of very cap- tivating manners, to effect a peaceable settlement of the disputes. Demetrius gained his end, but the Eomans treacherously availed themselves of his presence to create jealousy, envy, and hostility, between him and his elder brother Perseus, who was the son of Philip by a concubine. Perseus, a man of an angry and mis- trustful disposition, was, by the distinctions and favours shown to his brother, easily roused to bring calumnious accusations against him before his father. The latter was reluctantly pre- vailed upon to get rid of Demetrius, who was accordingly poi- soned at Heraclea. Three years after, in B.C. 179, the deceived Philip, weighed down by his grief, died, about 60 years old; and his kingdom, stronger and more powerful than it had been for a long time, passed into the hands of Perseus. The Eoman senate recognised him as king, and renewed with him the treaty which had been concluded with his father. But Perseus hated the Eomans as cordially as his father did. In talent he was much inferior to him : his besetting sin was avarice, and it was the love of money that ultimately brought about his ruin. This vice at first did not appear in his character, for he was even liberal and generous, and thereby succeeded in forming connections against the common enemy in Ulyricum, Thrace, Syria, Bithynia, Epirus, and Thessaly. He moreover negotiated with Carthage, and intended to carry out a plan of his father's, to induce the Bastamae, a barbarous nation on the banks of the Danube, to invade Italy. Some of these connections were cemented by marriages, for Perseus himself married a daughter of Antiochus Epiphanes, and Prusias of Bithynia married a sister of Berseus. The Greeks also began to look upon him as the man"], [375, "355 WAR WITH PERSEUS. who was able to restore the Macedonian empire ; and they were ready to assist him, if he would endeavour to drive the Eomans from the countries east of the Adriatic, though as yet few ventured openly to declare for him, because then cities were closely watched by Eoman emissaries, and, because inmany places, such as Bhodes, the Eoman party was more powerful than their adversaries. As Perseus was not allowed to keep a fleet, he made preparations for abandoning his maritime towns, and devoted all his attention to the increase of his finances, the strengthening of his land forces, and the filling of his arsenals with ammunition. If, with all his resources, Perseus had known how to keep the friends he had gained, and if he had been able to part with the money which he had promised as subsidies to his allies, he might have succeeded for a long time in resisting the power of Eome. But this he could not, and his fall was the consequence. Eumenes had, in the meantime, become alarmed by the grow ing power of Macedonia; and in B.C. 172 he went to Eome to direct the attention of the senate to the cause of his apprehension, while a Ehodian embassy endeavoured to represent Eumenes him self as aiming at the supremacy of all Asia. On his returning from Eome an attack was made on Iris rife in the neighbourhood of Delphi. As he was passing on a narrow foot-path along a precipice, some hidden persons rolled huge blocks of stone upon him from above. He was thrown down the precipice, and picked up almost lifeless, but he recovered, and returned to Asia by way of Corinth.2 Perseus was suspected of having been the instigator of the attempt, but on being called upon to deliver up certain persons who enjoyed his especial favour and were believed to be concerned in the affair, he not only asserted his innocence but refused to surrender his friends. These circumstances accelerated the outbreak of the war with Eome, which Perseus himself de clared in B.C. 171. The Eomans were taken by surprise, from not being sufficiently prepared; but still the opportunity of over throwing Macedonia, and of putting the countries east of the 2 Liv. xlii. 15 ; Appian, Be Reb. Maced. p. 521, ed. Schweigh."], [376, "356 HISTORY OF ROME. Adriatic on an entirely different footing, was highly welcome to them. The consul, B. Lichrius Crassus, met Perseus and his army in Thessaly. The king showed great resolution, and refused the absolute submission which the consul demanded ; for he relied upon the Greeks, nearly all of whom supported him, and were full of confidence in his success. Then- insolence towards the Eomans, in which they indidged on every occasion, was severely punished, for many of the Greek maritime towns were destroyed, and then- inhabitants sold as slaves. Eome's anticipations of this war, however, were not realised ; for instead of being able to put an end to it, as they had confidently hoped, by a single cam paign, they foimd it protracted, and Perseus even gained some advantages over them : he might, in fact, have crushed them if he had been more active and circumspect. Eumenes seems to have despaired of the success of the Eomans, for he entered into negotiations with Macedonia. The Bastarnae had aheady set out on then- expedition against Italy. Under these circumstances the Eomans found it necessary to take more energetic measures, for the people began to be impatient of the protracted war. In B.C. 168, the aged L. Aemffius Paidus was raised to the consul ship, and he, along with the praetor Cn. Octavius, set out without delay for his province of Macedonia. On the 22d of June the decisive battle was fought, near Pydna, which at once put an end to the kingdom of Macedonia. The contest was decided in a single bom- : the infantry was cut to pieces, and the cavalry dispersed. The defeated king, having lost all confidence, fled to the island of Samothrace, to seek an asylum in its inviolable sanctuary ; but being overtaken by the praetor, Cn. Octavius, he surrendered. The unhappy king and his son afterwards adorned the triumph of Aemffius Paulus. Perseus died at Alba, where he was kept as a state prisoner ; and his son is said to have earned his bread by practising the art of turning. L. Aemirius Paulus made a most cruel use of his victory. Macedonia was plundered, and ten Eoman commissioners were sent into the country to settle its"], [377, "AEMILIUS PAULUS IN GREECE. 357 affairs. It was declared free under the protectorate of Eome ; but the terms were so hard, that this mock freedom ground down the people more effectually than slavery. The country was cut up into four districts, and the inhabitants of one were not allowed to marry into another, or to acquire property there ; the gold and silver mines which had been worked vigorously ever since the time of Philip, were abandoned ; and the people were prohibited from felling timber to build ships ; so that the country gradually sank into a state of poverty and helplessness. Half the tribute which had hitherto been paid to the kings was hence forth paid to Eome. Genthius, of LTyricum, had provoked the Eomans even before the outbreak of the war with Perseus, by the piracy which his subjects carried on in the Adriatic ; but his affiance with Mace donia decided the outbreak of the third Illyrian war, especially as he had thrown into chains two Eoman ambassadors whom he had taken prisoners in that part of Ulyricum which was subject to Eome. The praetor, L. Anicius, undertook the command against him, and within thirty days the war was brought to a close. The country was cut up into three cantons, and governed in a similar manner with Macedonia. The cruelty of M. Aemffius Paulus, who is usually described as one of the noblest characters in Eoman history, became mani fest immediately after his victory over Perseus. From Mace donia he marched southward to settle the affairs of Greece. Everywhere the party which espoused the cause of Eome received military reinforcements to crush then opponents. The Achaean league was required to pass a decree, that all who had supported Perseus should be put to death. The Achaeans reasonably demanded that the Eomans should name the offenders; but this was refused, and the Eomans insisted upon then demand : at length they condescended to make out a list of upwards of 1000 of the most illustrious Achaeans, who were to quit then country and to proceed to Italy, where their cause was to be tried. One of these unfortunate men was Polybius the historian, who,"], [378, "358 HISTORY OF ROME. however, by his talent and knowledge gained the friendship of the most distinguished Eomans, and was thus placed in more favourable circumstances than his countrymen. On their arrival in Italy, they were not tried, as they had hoped, but were dis tributed among the towns of Etmria, and kept there as hostages for a period of sixteen years ; and when in the seventeenth they were allowed to return to then country, then number had melted down to 300 \u2014 a proof of the manner in which they had been treated by those who had promised to deal with them according to the principles of justice and equity. Before L. Aemilius Paulus returned to Italy, he crowned all he had done hitherto by punishing Epirus for what Italy had suffered from Pyrrhus more than a centnry before. Some of the Epirots had indeed ventured to take up arms against the Eomans ; but after the defeat of Perseus they remained perfectly submissive, and did not anticipate that the Eomans would take vengeance upon them. Aemilius Paulus, however, in passing through their country on his return to Italy, took up his quarters among the Molossians, who were commanded, under penalty of death, to deliver up all then gold and silver. When this was done, and the defenceless people now fancied themselves in perfect safety, the soldiers on a sudden fell upon them. No less than 15,000 Epirots were massacred or sold into slavery, and seventy towns were de stroyed. Such was the conduct of a man who is often cited as an example of mildness and humanity ! It would have been cruel enough, in the course of a destructive war ; but perpetrated, as it was, among a peaceful and unsuspecting people, it was a piece of unpardonable brutality.3 The conquest of Macedonia, the immense wealth which had been brought to Eome, and the annual tribute which the conquered had to pay, filled not only the public treasury, but the pockets of those who were at the head of affairs ; and it is from this time that we must date the fatal gulf which was forming at Eome between enormous wealth and absolute poverty. The well- 3 Liv. xlv. 27\u201434."], [379, "ROME'S RELATIONS TO THE EAST. 359 stocked treasury henceforth rendered it unnecessary to levy the poll-tax or tributum on Eoman citizens.4 The haughty and domineering spirit of Bome now no longer scrupled to display itself on every occasion; and it became more and more manifest, that it was her plan to subjugate all nations who were yet in the enjoyment of apparent freedom, or whom she had reason to fear. The first sign of it occurred in the time of the war against Perseus. Antiochus Epiphanes, in the belief that Bome being engaged elsewhere would not be able to defend her allies, had invaded Egypt, which was under the protectorate of Bome. The guardians of young Ptolemy VI. (Philometer) had claimed for then ward Phoenicia and Coelesyria, and Antiochus occupied Pelusium with a strong garrison. But as Ptolemy became re conciled to his brother Physcon, whom the Alexandrians had raised to the throne, and who refused to give up Cyprus and Pelusium to the Syrian, Antiochus in b.c 168 again entered Egypt. The two brothers now applied for and obtained the as sistance of Bome ; and a Boman embassy, which was forthwith despatched to Egypt, met Antiochus not far from Alexandria. Popillius Laenas, one of- them, required of the king to quit Egypt; and as Antiochus gave an evasive answer, the ambassador drew a circle round him, demanding a positive reply, and com pelled him to leave the country. Words of a Eoman, who spoke as if the world belonged to him, thus accomplished what otherwise could have been effected only by force of arms. The same haughty contempt was shown towards all those who had openly or secretly espoused the cause of Perseus. The first against whom the Eomans intended to direct then arms were the Ehodians, who for the last 140 years had been allied with Eome. When the Ehodians saw that it was impossible to escape from the vengeance of Bome, they sent ambassadors, whom the haughty senate even refused to listen to. Those Ehodians who had secretly supported Perseus made away with themselves or took to flight. At length, however, the Ehodians were pardoned ; 4 Plin. xxxiii. 17 ; comp. Liv. xlv. 40 ; Veil. Pat. i. 9."], [380, "360 HISTORY OF ROME. but they had to submit to the hardest conditions : they were deprived of the honour of being Eoman allies ; they were required to give up their possessions in Lycia and Caria, to cease levying on vessels that passed through then- sea, the toll from which they had derived most of their wealth, and to recognise the supremacy of Bome. Eumenes of Pergamus intended himself to go to Eome and pay his homage to the senate ; but he was forbidden to travel, because he was suspected of having been secretly allied with Perseus. Other rulers recognised the supremacy of Eome with out any crifficulty : such as Brusks of Bithynia, who degraded himself even so far as to call himself the freedman of Eome, and to kiss the threshold of the Eoman curia; Masinissa, who governed his kingdom in the name of Eome ; Seleucus Nicator of Syria, Ariarathes of Cappadocia, and the two kings of Egypt. In the last of these countries, Philometer and the contemptible Physcon had again become involved in disputes ; and as Physcon, contrary to all fairness, had obtained the favour of Eome, the kingdom was in B.C. 162 divided between them ; but the division was so arranged by the Eoman senate as to keep alive the seeds of discord, whereby the two brothers necessarily weakened each other. In like manner means were devised of breaking the power of Syria ; for the heir to the throne, Demetrius, was kept at Eome, where he rived as a hostage ; and Antiochus V. (Eupator) though only nine years old, was declared king in B.C. 164, in order that the senate might be able to act as his guardian, and thus govern the weakened kingdom according to the interests of Eome. After this, Eoman ambassadors caused the Syrian fleet to be destroyed, and the elephants trained for war to be mutilated or killed, so that the kingdom of Syria became perfectly harmless. AU these princes, moreover, were strictly watched by Eoman emis saries, so that nothing could be done or attempted without the knowledge of Eome, which had thus thrown its net over them. The senate by these means obtained information about all the states which, sooner or later, were to be subjugated by its overwhelming"], [381, "FOREIGN RELATIONS. 361 power. There were only two powers, Carthage and the Achaean confederacy, which seemed to be an obstacle in the way of Eoman policy, but then destruction had long been in contemplation aud was secretly prepared. The period between the victory over Macedonia and the third Punic war (b.c 149) is very barren, and presents scarcely any event of general interest. All we know is, that the Eomans at that time began to attack the Gaids in the Alps, that they gra dually made themselves masters of the coast of Liguria as far as Spain, that they subdued the Dalmatians, and made them selves complete masters of Corsica. In Spain the war still con tinued, and was conducted with great vigour against the Celti berians. The Eomans there acquired one tract of land after another, as there was no national bond among the tribes of Spain. All of themwould have wilLinglyrecognised the supremacy of Eome, had she been inclined to make peace on tolerable terms ; but what she wanted was absolute submission, and her conduct was such that no one could trust her. In this manner war broke out afresh each time that a new commander arrived in Spain ; and before that country had a really great man capable of avenging the wrong it was suffering, two tragic scenes occurred in Africa and Greece : Carthage was destroyed, and Greece lost its freedom. B"], [382, "362 CHAPTEE XXI. THE THIRD PUNIC WAR, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF CARTHAGE. \u2014 FINAL SUBJU- GATION OF MACEDONIA AND ACHAIA, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF CORINTH. The peace which had been concluded with Carthage in B.C. 201 lasted for a period of upwards of fifty years, during which the Carthaginians did not give the Eomans a single cause of com plaint ; but the relation subsisting between the two republics and Masinissa proved to be a fruitful source of annoyance to Carthage ; and the injustice of the Eomans, who were to act as mediators, in the end drove the Carthaginians to despair : then last and fatal struggle was the result of it. Masinissa, in the neighbouring country of Numidia, not only acted as a watchful spy over what was going on at Carthage, but it would seem that he was secretly authorised to harass and annoy his neighbours in any way without fear of being taken to account by the Eomans. In B.c 182 he took possession of the rich district of Emporia, about the Lesser Syrtis, which Syphax had given up to Carthage. The Carthaginians, not being permitted to carry on war without the sanction of Eome, brought complaints against him before the Eoman senate. After many deliberations, ambassadors were indeed sent to Africa to investigate the matter, but with secret instructions to favour Masinissa, and strictly to watch the move ments of the Carthaginians, who were finally obliged in B.C. 174 not oidy to give up that tract of country, with many flomlslring towns, but to pay to Masinissa the sum of 500 talents. Cato, who had been one of the ambassadors, and whose ambition had not been sufficiently flattered by the people of Carthage, looked with envy and hatred upon the African republic, which was still"], [383, "CARTHAGE AND MASINISSA. 363 great and prosperous ; and in his mind the resolution was soon ripened to exert all his powers to bring about the destruction of a state, which, though outwardly flourishing, was yet in a con dition of inward decay, and would perhaps have soon perished of its own disease.1 That republic, in which the democratical party appears to have gained the upper hand, was distracted by internal discord ; and although the number of real patriots must have been very great, yet many citizens seem to have been in the pay of Eome or of Masinissa, and these were zealously engaged in furthering the objects of the enemy. The patriots at length carried a decree, by which forty senators were sent into exile as traitors to then country. The exiles fled to Masinissa, with whom they found a cordial welcome, as they had supported his cause. At last, about B.C. 152, the Carthaginians, tired of their forbear ance, and of then fruitless solicitation of Eome's mediation, took up arms to defend their own rights against the Numidian aggressor. Masinissa was at this time more powerful than the Carthaginians, whose armies still consisted of mercenaries. Though upwards of ninety years old, he led his own forces into the field ; and having to fight against an unskilful Carthaginian general, he completely defeated his enemies, and compelled them, in an humiliating peace, to receive back their exiles. All this was done in the presence of Boman ambassadors, who merely acted the part of idle spectators. But the time had now come for Eome to carry out her long cherished plan ; for her suspicion, that it was Masinissa's inten tion to make himself master of Carthage, may not have been without some foundation. Cato, in the Eoman senate, incessantly urged the necessity of destroying the rival republic, which once had sent a Hannibal into Italy; and he concluded all the speeches he delivered at this time with these words : \" ceteram censeo Carthaginem esse delendam.\" P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica was wiser than Cato, and opposed his plan, because he justly thought that so long as Eome had to be on her guard against a rival 1 Appian. Pun. 69. K 2"], [384, "364 HISTORY OF ROME. republic, his fellow citizens would be under a useful restraint, and be prevented from abandoning themselves to frivolous and reckless passions and haughty insolence. He was convinced that it would be a misfortune for Eome to be deprived of a neighbour who could inspire her with fear ; and he well knew that it was in the stmggles with that mighty rival that Eome had acquired her greatness and strength. It might also be that he was influenced by a feeling of humanity for the unfortunate Carthaginians ; but however this may have been, Cato's opinion prevailed, being more in accordance with the spirit and policy of Eome. The Boman ambassadors, on their return from Africa, gave a most glowing account of the prosperity of the Carthaginians, who had long been making preparations for the conflict with Masinissa, which they foresaw was inevitable. The senate took the Carthaginians to account for their conduct towards Masinissa ; and, desponding aud broken-hearted, they sent envoys to Eome, where they were ambiguously requested to make reparation to Eome, but were at the same time assured that nothing should be done against them. But, notwithstanding this assurance, and under the pretext that the Carthaginians had broken the peace of their own accord, the consuls M'. Manirius and L. Marcius Censoiinus, in B.C. 149, assembled an army of 8000 foot and 4000 horse in Sicily. There other Carthaginian ambassadors were expected, and when they appeared the consuls declared, that as Carthage was divided into parties, Bome must have some security : they accordingly demanded that 300 members of the most distinguished families should be delivered up as hostages. The demand was complied with, and when the submission of Carthage was secured in this manner, the consuls led over then forces in a large fleet, and landed at Utica, which, from despair, had even before this thrown itself into the arms of Bome. There again Carthaginian ambassa dors appeared before the consuls, who now declared themselves to be ready to treat with them on any point that had not been settled before ; but the ambassadors were at the same time told, that, as a further security for their keeping peace, Carthage must"], [385, "THIRD PUNIC WAR. 365 deliver up all her arms and military engines. This command, hard as it was, was yet obeyed; and the Carthaginians now naturally thought that Eome would be perfectly satisfied. Eoman commissioners were sent into the city, who carried away 2000 catapults and 200,000 suits of armour. But when after this the consuls further demanded that the city of Carthage should be razed to the ground, and that its inhabitants should build for themselves another town at a distance of several miles from the sea-coast, the exasperation of the Carthaginians rose to such a pitch, that all the gates of the city were instantly shut, and all the Eomans and Italians that happened to be within the walls were put to death. Despair gave the people courage, and all resolved to fight to the last rather than jield to so treacherous and infamous an enemy : the senators declared that they would perish with Carthage. The people, being seized with an almost frantic madness, con trived in every possible way to supply the means of defence in the place of the arms of which they had been so treacherously deprived; and every one, without difference of rank, age, or sex, endeavoured to do his best in defending and protecting the devoted city. There still were 70,000 inhabitants who made the most desperate efforts, and were worthy of a better fate. The Eomans had not anticipated so determined a resistance to then last demand : they had imagined that the city\" might be taken without any difficulty. But they were mistaken : their consuls were not skilful commanders, and several assaults upon the strong and lofty walls of the city were energetically repulsed. The Carthaginians themselves made several sallies, and on one occasion the Eomans were saved only by the prudence and reso lution of P. Cornelius Scipio, the son of Aemilius Paulus, who served in the army as a tribune of the soldiers. Hasdrubal, a Carthaginian general who rived in exile, and with an army of fellow-exries conducted the war, independently of Carthage, against Masinissa, was now recalled and intrusted with the command of the Carthaginian forces outside the city, where Phameas com-"], [386, "366 HISTORY OF ROME. manded the right cavalry. Both of them performed very brilliant feats against the Eomans during then foraging excursions into the interior of the country; but Phameas afterwards turned traitor, and went over to the enemy. The consul of the year B.C. 148, L. Calpurnius Piso, and the praetor L. Mancinus, were no more successful than their predecessors ; and this circumstance increased the confidence and enthusiasm of the besieged, who still kept up their communication with the sea. Masinissa, in the meantime, withdrew his forces, as he began to fear the Eomans ; but in the same year he died, leaving his kingdom to his son Micipsa. Scipio, who had been appointed executor of his will, now increased the Boman army by the Numidian cavalry. In this memorable year Cato also died, at the age of 85 ; and in Macedonia a pretender arose, under the name of Philip, who claimed the throne, found many followers, and defeated the Boman generals, while shortly after the Achaeans also rose in arms against Bome. All these events contributed to increase the hope of the Car thaginians that they might yet be successful ; but the Eomans also became aware that then want of success was owing only to the laziness and inability of then commanders. They accordingly raised P. Cornelius Scipio, the son of Aemilius Paulus, to the consulship for the year B.C. 147, though he had not yet attained the legitimate consular age, and they assigned to him Africa as his province. He was afterwards, like the conqueror of Hannibal, honoured by the surname of Africanus. He is usually praised as one of the greatest Eomans, and he fully deserves the praise bestowed upon him as far as his generalship is concerned ; but his greatness is, nevertheless, over-estimated, for it is evident that he was but too well aware of Iris eminence, and that he made a show of his great qualities. He was the affectionate friend of Laelius, the pupil and admirer of Polybius, and the patron of Terence and Panaetius ; but he never showed that lofty greatness of soul which we admire in the elder Scipio. As a politician, he was consistent throughout his life, and an unflinching conserva-"], [387, "367 P. CORNELIUS SCIPIO. tive in the strictest sense of the word : he was bent on upholding the state of things such as it existed in his days, even though he might clearly see that it was based on injustice, and must lead to ruin. After his arrival in Africa, his first object was to restore discipline among the troops, and to cut off the supplies which had till then been introduced into Carthage from the sea. He then compelled Hasdrubal to retreat, and made himself master of Megara, a suburb of Carthage: on his attempting to stop up the mouth of the harbour-, the Carthaginians set about digging a new entrance, and secretly built a fleet of 500 sad. The appearance of this fleet produced the greatest consternation among the Eomans, and had the Carthaginians possessed sufficient resolution to attack the enemy's fleet, they might have destroyed it completely. On one occasion, a band of Carthaginians, who had devoted themselves to death, made a sally from the city and set the Eoman engines and towers on fire ; but the Eomans soon restored what was destroyed, and carried on the siege with fresh vigour until the approaching winter put an end to then operations. Scipio employed this interval in taking the town of Nepheris, from whence Carthage had until then derived many of its pro visions. The command of the army was continued to him for the year B.c 146, and in the spring of that year he renewed his attacks upon the city. The inhabitants had by this time been reduced to a most frightful state of famine, during which Hasdrubal, who had assumed the supreme power, introduced a sort of reign of terror. At length the Eomans succeeded by night in taking possession of the harbour Cothon, and in scaring the last of the three walls by which Carthage, which was situated on a peninsula, was protected on the land side. The enemy now was within the city, and the struggle which ensued is one of the most heart-rending that a person can think of. From the market place three streets, lined with houses of six stories each, led to the citadel of Bozra or Byrsa, whither Hasdrubal had with drawn. The contest was earned on in all the streets and houses"], [388, "368 HISTORY OF ROME. for six days, and the houses were conquered one by one, by breaking through the walls from room to room and from house to house. The struggle at the same time went on upon the flat roofs of the houses as well as in the streets, and the cries and moanings of the wounded and dying, mixed with the shouts of the combatants, rendered the scene one of extreme horror. The famine in the city was so great, that the riving satisfied their himger with the dead bodies of then fellow-citizens. With the most unparalleled exertions the Eomans at length reached Byrsa, the highest point of which was occupied by a temple of Aescula pius. Scipio then. ordered the three streets to be set on fire, and in a short time the whole city was in a blaze. On the seventh day some Carthaginians came from the citadel to Scipio, entreating him to spare the rives of the citizens. This request was granted; but he refused to pardon 900 Eoman deserters who had taken refuge in the citadel. Immediately 50,000 men and women, carry ing olive branches in their hands, came forward, and were sold as slaves by the conqueror. Hasdrubal, with the Eoman deserters, then took possession of the temple of Aesculapius, but here his courage failed him : he fled to the conqueror, and implored his mercy; while the deserters set fire to the temple, and perished in the flames. Hasdrubal's wife, braver than her husband, and indignant at his cowardly conduct, threw herself with her children into the flames. The destruction of Carthage was now complete : the scenes of terror and despair which Scipio had witnessed are said to have drawn tears into his eyes, and stirred up in his mind gloomy forebodings of the fate which awaited his own native city.2 The Eoman senate passed a decree, that every building of Carthage should be razed to the ground : the territory of Utica was increased by the annexation of a part of the Carthaginian 2 He repeated to his friend Polybius, who was present, the following two lines from the Iliad (iv. 164) : \u2014 \"Ea-sl-erai 5V uv 7tot' a\\u\\ri \"I\\tos tph Kal ripiauos teal \\abs 4ufx^K'tw ripfa/xoio."], [389, "DESTRUCTION OF CARTHAGE. 369 dominion ; and the republic of Carthage became a Eoman pro vince under the name of Africa, which like other provinces was governed by a Eoman proconsul or praetor. Scipio celebrated a magnificent triumph on his return to Bome. A state had thus perished in which Eome lost what could never be restored to her \u2014 a noble rival. Instead of the commercial fleets which had hitherto visited all parts of the Mediterranean, there were now no ships except transports, which carried to Eome provisions and slaves, or wild beasts to amuse and brutarise the populace, and pirate boats, which increased in proportion with the conquests of Eome. The site of ancient Carthage was cursed ; and afterwards, when the noble C. Sempronius Gracchus founded a colony there, he established it, at some distance from the site of the old city, under the name of Junonia ; but the new town soon assumed the name of Carthage, and prospered so well, that towards the end of the second century of our era it became the seat of a Christian bishop. About the middle of the fifth century it became the capital of the kingdom of the Vandals ; and in a.d. 698 it was taken and destroyed by the Arabs. At present the site of ancient Carthage is discernible only by heaps of ruins. The insurrection in Macedonia, to which we referred above, had by this time been quelled. The inhabitants of that country too soon discovered that the freedom which Eome had given them was worse than slavery ; and it was owing to this feel ing that they allowed themselves to be duped by a person of the name of Andriscus, a Thracian by birth, and a runaway gladiator, who, in B.C. 149, came forward in Thrace and gave himself out to be a son of the late king Perseus, calling him self Philip. The discontented people of Macedonia, aster a short resistance, submitted to him in the hope that he would deliver them from the yoke of Eome. He entered into connections with Carthage, defeated the praetor P. Juventius Thalna, who was sent against him, and invaded Thessaly. The whole affair became more serious than could have been expected; but in b.c. 148 Q. Caecirius Metellus was sent against him as praetor, and e3"], [390, "370 HISTORY OF ROME. aster several skirmishes a decisive battle was fought in the neigh bourhood of Pydna, in which the impostor was completely defeated. Andriscus fled to Thrace, but being delivered up to the Eomans by a Thracian chief, he adorned the triumph of Metellus, who, from his Macedonian victory, obtained the surname of Macedonicus. In B.C. 143 another pretender arose in Macedonia, who likewise declared himself to be a son of Perseus,3 but he was defeated by the quaestor L. Tremeffius. After these insurrections Macedonia lost its nominal freedom, and was constituted a Eoman province. The time had now come when Greece too was to be deprived of the last shadow of its freedom. On the advice of Cato and Scipio, the three hundred survivors of the Achaean hostages had been allowed, in B.C. 151, to return to their country. Some of them were old men, but all of them were burning with an impla cable hatred of the Eomans. Had the Achaeans made common cause with Andriscus, they might have entertained a reasonable hope of being able to resist the enemy ; but that opportunity was neglected, and now they were led to believe by their sense less leaders, Critokus and Diaeus, that, single-handed as they were, they might expel the Eomans from then- country. The long peace which they enjoyed had been spent in idleness and in the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, so that they were altogether unprepared for the evil days which now broke in upon them ; and yet they were fool-hardy enough to venture upon a contest with a power before which none had hitherto been able to stand. The Eomans, who had long formed their plans, were waiting only for a favourable opportunity to carry them into effect. This was offered in the struggle between the Achaean confederacy and Sparta, which wanted to make itself independent of the league. When Sparta was attacked by the Achaeans, it appealed to the Eomans, who, being at the time engaged in the subjugation of Carthage, acted with great caution ; but as soon as they per- 3 Some call him Alexander, and Liv., Epit. 53; Eutrop. iv. 15 ; Zonar. others the second Pseudo-Philip ; see ix. 28 ; Varro, Be Re Rust. ii. 4."], [391, "371 WAR WITH THE ACHAEANS. ceived that the fall of Carthage was inevitable, they spoke in a different tone, and under the pretext of a desire to prevent further disturbances within the confederacy arising from the dif- ferent elements of which it was composed, they demanded that those places which had not been united with the confederacy at the close of the war with Perseus should be separated from it. Those places were Sparta, Corinth, Argos, Heraclea near Mount Oeta, and Orchomenos in Arcadia. When this demand was announced to the assembly of the Achaeans at Corinth, the Eoman ambassadors were attacked, insulted, and driven out of the theatre. The demand was indeed a glaring injustice, but the Achaeans ought to have yielded to a positive necessity. The Eomans, who were as yet engaged against Carthage, brooked the insolence, and only demanded reparation for it. Several em- bassies passed between Achaia and Eome, but as the em-aged and mad party of Diaeus and Critokus wished for war, the Eoman ambassadors sent by Q. Caecffius Metellus were again insulted, and war was at once declared against Eome and Sparta. Metellus accordingly, after having reduced Macedonia, entered Greece in B.C. 147. Critokus had advanced northward as far as Thessaly, probably in the hope of being able to form con nections with the Pseudo-Philip ; but the pretender was defeated before the Achaeans reached Thermopylae. When Critokus heard of the approach of Metellus, he retreated into Locris, where he was overtaken by the Eomans, and his army was dis persed like chaff. Critokus himself was never heard of after : he probably perished in the marshes on the sea-coast. All Greece was in the greatest consternation. In the meantime a Eoman fleet landed on the western coast of Peloponnesus, and ravaged the country in a barbarous manner ; and as Metellus advanced southward, the inhabitants of Thebes quitted their city and fled into the mountains. But the Boman general used his victory with great moderation, for in his heart he pitied the Greeks, and would willingly have spared them, if then own insolent conduct had permitted him. When he reached"], [392, "372 HISTORY OF ROME. Megara, L. Mummius, who had been elected consid for the year b.c 146, hastened to undertake the command against the Achaeans. Mummius had no sympathies with the Greeks : he was a man without education, and all he desired was laurels for himself, and treasures for Eome. Diaeus was now commander of the Achaeans: having enlisted all- the slave population, to the amount of 12,000, capable of bearing arms, he assembled his army in the neighbourhood of Corinth, fancying that he should be able to defend the isthmus. AU proposals of peace had been treated by him with the utmost contempt and recklessness. But in the valley of Leucopetra the Achaeans were so completely de feated, that it was impossible for them to face the enemy agam. The army in its flight by Corinth alarmed the inhabitants so much, that they also took refuge in the neighbouring hills. Diaeus himself fled to Megalopolis, where he killed his wife, and burnt himself with his whole house. On the third day after the battle, Mummius entered Corinth, which was filled with the most splendid works of Grecian art. The Eomans indulged in unre strained plunder, and then reduced the town to a heap of ashes. The remaining part of the male population was put to the sword, while the females and children were sold as slaves. Thebes and Chalcis experienced the same fate. All the costly treasures which had been accumulated at Corinth and had not been de- stroyed by the conquerors were shipped for Eome ; and the rudeness and ignorance of Mummius are strikingly illustrated by his telling the sailors, that, if any of the works of art should be lost or damaged during the voyage, they would have to restore them at then- own expense. The good days of Greece were now passed for ever ; and though afterwards some of the Eoman emperors treated the country with kindness and reverence for its past greatness, still it never recovered its ancient splendour. Those Greeks who had taken no part in the war were restored to nominal freedom, but all national ties between them were destroyed ; the territory of Corinth became Eoman domain land ; and all Greece was formed"], [393, "DESTRUCTION OF CORINTH. 373 into a Eoman province under the name of Achaia. Polybius on this occasion had to perform the sad duty of acting the part of a mediator between the conquerors and his unfortunate country men, for whom he contrived to obtain several favours, and whom he tried to accustom to the new order of things. Mummius was honoured with a triumph and the surname of Achaicus. The fall of Carthage took place in July, that of Corinth occurred in September, b.c 146."], [394, "374 CHAPTEE XXII. THE WARS IN SPAIN. VIRIATHUS. NUMANTLA. INSURRECTION OF THE SLAVES IN SICILY. THE KINGDOM OF PERGAMUS. Eome had found it comparatively easy to conquer two of the wealthiest republics of antiquity; but that it was not so easy to subdue nations flourishing by agriculture and animated by a strong love of their country and freedom, was a lesson which she learned in the protracted war against the tribes of Spain, who main tained then independence as then most precious good with the greatest energy and resolution against then oppressors. Eome's unjust proceedings became every day more glaring and intolerable. In B.C. 179, Tib. Sempronius Gracchus, by his kindliness and fairness, had made the Celtiberians the friends of Bome, but he had forbidden them to build any more towns in their country. Some years after, when the inhabitants of Segeda had obliged the citizens of some smaller Celtiberian towns to relinquish then homes and settle at Segeda, and when for this reason they wished to enlarge the extent of then own city, the Eoman senate, refer ring to then treaty with Gracchus, interfered. The Segedans refused to obey : they also declined to send any reinforcements to the Eoman armies, and to pay their usual tribute. A fresh war accordingly broke out in B.C. 153. The consuls, M. Fulvius Nobilior, and in the year following M. Claudius Marcellus, fought against the Celtiberians with varying success. Marcellus was a noble-minded man, and in his heart he respected the people who were struggling for nothing but then independence. He therefore endeavoured to obtain a peace for them on fast terms ; but the haughty senate at Eoine refused to treat with them except"], [395, "375 VIRIATHUS. on condition of then absolute submission. Marcellus then con trived to gain then confidence, and instead of using force, pre vailed upon them by persuasion to conclude a peace with Eome on terms which in then circumstances were quite reasonable. But after his departure from Spain, L. Licinius Lucullus, and still more the praetor Ser. Sulpicius Galba, after having suffered a severe defeat, called forth by his avarice and cruelty a general insurrection in Lusitania ; for although after some resistance the Lusitanians south of the river Tagus voluntarily submitted and assembled without then arms, Galba ordered them all to be massacred. Among the few who escaped on that fearful day was Viriathus, destined one day to become the avenger of the wrong that was done to his country. Cato brought an accusation against Galba for this act of wanton cruelty, and the man would have been condemned to death had he not implored the mercy of the Eoman people. Viriathus, a Lusitanian, is said to have been at first a shepherd, then a robber, and in the end he became a general, who, even ac cording to the judgment of his enemies, showed in the field of battle not only the greatest courage, but the most eminent talent and skill. He rallied around him as many of his countrymen as he could, and with them he waged war against the Eomans for a period of eight years.1 Being himself accustomed to a free rife in the mountains, being robust, hardened, adroit, always cheerful, and dreading no danger, he was beloved by his country men ; he knew how to manage them, and to keep alive in them the desire to defend their freedom. It would be of great interest to relate with what skill he wore out the Eoman armies, how he was present everywhere with his light cavalry, and how he dispersed his enemies and then conquered them one by one; but we must con fine ourselves to the principal events. Q. Fabius Maximus Aemi- 1 Appian, Hispan. 60, ccc. ; Livy, murdered in b.c 140, these writers Epit. 52; and Floras ii. 17, state that include the time that he fought among he carried on the war for fourteen the Lusitanians against Lucullus and years ; but as he did not commence Galba, that is, they begin their calcu hostilities till B.C. 148, aud as he was lation in B.C. 153."], [396, "376 HISTORY OF ROME. rianus and Q. Fabius Maximus Servirianus both experienced his valour, prudence, and skill. Servirianus, in B.C. 141, concluded a peace with him, in which Viriathus was recognised as the friend and ally of Eome, and in which the Lusitanians were lest in the possession of their country. The war thus seemed to be con cluded, but the Eomans could not get over the feeling that they had treated Viriathus too much as their equal ; and the very next year, b.c 140, the consul Q. Servilius Caepio faithlessly violated the peace and renewed the war. While Decimus Junius Brutus was engaged in another part of Spain, Viriathus was again in duced to enter into fresh negotiations for a treaty ; but Caepio secretly lined some Lusitanian assassins, who entered the tent of then leader, aud, finding him asleep, cut his throat, and then returned to the Eoman camp to receive then blood-money. After the murder of Viriathus, the Lusitanians were no longer able to hold out against their enemies : they had lost their head, and were without confidence in themselves. In B.C. 138, the consul D. Junius Brutus subdued the whole of Lusitania; and in the peace which he concluded with the conquered people, he assigned to those who had served under Viriathus the town and district of Valentia, on the south-eastern coast of Spain, where, owing to the extreme mildness of the climate, they entirely lost their warlike spirit. Brutus was the first Eoman that crossed the river Minius (Minho) and entered the territory of the Galkeci, whence he derived the surname of Gallaicus : he cele brated his triumph in B.C. 132. A more determined resistance was offered to the Eomans by the city of Numantia, in the country of the Arevaci. This city, the ornament of Spain, has gained the admiration of all ages for the heroic manner in which its citizens asserted to the last then liberty. It was situated on an eminence, surrounded by rocks and forests, on the bank of the river Durius (Douro), and ditches and mounds protected the approach from the plain 2. 2 Ruins of the ancient town are still visible in the neighbourhood of Soria, on the right bank of the river Douro."], [397, "DESTRUCTION OF NUMANTIA. 377 The war against Numantia began in B.C. 143, and was carried on successively by Caecilius Metellus, and Q. Pompeius, who as pro praetor had been unfortunate against Viriathus. He laid siege to Numantia, but in B.C. 140 his position became so desperate that he was obliged to conclude a peace with the Numantines, which, however, from fear of the senate, he afterwards denied, where upon the war was resumed afresh. In b.c 137 the consul C. Hostilius Mancinus also fought without success : he was driven from his camp, and his army was placed in so perilous a situa tion that he was obliged to submit to a very humiliating peace, which, however, he could not have obtained but for the mediation of young Tib. Sempronius Gracchus, who was then serving in the army as quaestor, and in whom the Numantines had confidence from their recollection of the noble conduct of his father. The Eomans obtained safe departure on condition that Numantia should remain free and independent, and be treated as a friend of Bome. When this peace was laid before the- senate to receive its sanction, the senate with one accord declared it invalid, and decreed that Maneinus should be delivered up to the enemy, in order to annul the peace legally. But the Numantines acted in a nobler spirit than the Eomans : they refused to accept the person of the consul, as the breach of public confidence could not be atoned for by the sacrifice of the consul. Gracchus escaped sharing the fate of Mancinus only through his great popularity with the people of Eome : it is not improbable that the shameful and unjust conduct of the Eoman aristocracy on this occasion made a deep impression upon his noble mind, and roused his holy indignation. After this again a few years passed away without the Eomans gaining any great advantages, and it now became evident that the war could not be brought to a close unless Eome made greater exertions and placed her armies under the command of the ablest man she possessed. Scipio Africanus, the destroyer of Carthage, was accordingly again elected to the consulship for the year b.c 134, and forthwith went to Numantia to crush also that"], [398, "378 HISTORY OF ROME. noble people. The first thing he did was to render the army, which had become desponding and disorganised, fit for active ser vice. He received reinforcements from Jugurtha, the grandson of Masinissa, and set about forming a fourfold line of fortifications round the city, in order to effect by hunger what had been in vain attempted by the sword. All endeavours of the Numan tines to break through these fortifications failed. On one occa sion however, some Numantines succeeded in forcing their way to the neighbouring town of Lutia. Then valour excited universal admiration, and all Lutia offered them assistance. Scipio, who had followed the Numantines, then committed an outrage which would be pardoned only in a savage, for he ordered the hands of 400 citizens of Lutia to be cut off, because they were ready to support Numantia 3. The besieged were suffering from frightful famine, having for a time been feeding on the corpses of then fellow-citizens, and Scipio now called upon them to surrender at discretion. The Numantines begged for a truce of three days, that they might consider what course to take. The request was granted, and the time was spent by the most distinguished of the Numantines in destroying their wives and children. The slaughter was so great, that when on the third day the gates were thrown open, only a small number, whose features hardly resem bled those of human beings, came out and surrendered to the enemy. The city of Numantia was destroyed in B.C. 133, and its territory distributed among the neighbouring tribes. The districts conquered by D. Brutus and Scipio received the consti tution of a Eoman province, and Spain being exhausted by pro tracted and bloody wars remained for a time quiet ; but about the year b.c 100, new insurrections broke out, and in B.C. 98, the consul T. Didius had again to fight against the Celtiberians : it was under him that Sertorius first became acquainted with Spain and the Spaniards 4. During this period of incessant foreign warfare, Italy out- 3 Appian, Hispan. 94. 4 Plutarch, Sertor. 3 ; Gellius, ii. 27."], [399, "379 SERVILE WAR IN SICILY. wardly was in the enjoyment of perfect peace, and increasing in wealth and population. But Scipio, who, notwithstanding his high conservative principles, saw that things could not go on much longer as they were, ordered in his censorship, B.C. 143, after the general purification, that public prayers should be offered up, not as had been done until then, for the increase of the republic, but for its preservation. A scourge, however, came upon the Eomans from a quarter from which they had least ex pected it. By the conquests which Eome had made in Africa, Macedonia, Greece, and Spain, the number of slaves in all parts of the empire had increased to an enormous amount, and they were sold in the markets for a mere trifle. The free population of Sicfly had been extremely reduced in the wars with Carthage, of which it had been the scene, and afterwards by famine and plagues ; and the large tracts of domain land in the occupation of wealthy Eomans, or Sicilians, served for the most part as pasture land, on which whole bands of slaves tended the flocks of then masters. These slaves were treated with harshness and cruelty, and one of them, Eunus, a Syrian, acquired great influence among his fellow-slaves by bis religious enthusiasm and other artifices. He associated himself with Cleon, a Cilician, and at Enna gave the signal for a general insurrection of the slaves, in B.C. 134. It soon spread over the whole of the island, and in a short time about 70,000 slaves had rallied round these two leaders. Eunus even assumed the diadem, and called himself King Antiochus. Humanity when insulted, and when its most sacred rights are trampled on, always, sooner or later, takes most terrible vengeance on its oppressors ; and such was the case in Sicily, which in all parts exhibited the most frightful scenes of horror and murderous fury : all free men who could not make their escape were massacred, and several Eoman armies were defeated by the infuriated hordes. But as the undertakings of the separate leaders were generally without a regular plan, and as they did not know how to make the best use of their victo ries, the consul, P. Eupffius, in B.C. 132, took Tauromenium,"], [400, "380 HISTORY OF ROME. and compelled the slaves to retreat towards Enna, where he defeated them. Upwards of 20,000 of them were put to the sword, and many were nailed on crosses along the high roads in order to terrify those who were yet in arms. The life of Eunus, who fell into the hands of the conquerors, was spared, but he died in a prison at Morgantia. About this time, in b.c 133, Attalus Philometor, king of Pergamus, died, and with him the dynasty of the Pergamenian princes became extinct. Although the last of them was one of the worst specimens of eastern despots, and took the greatest delight in preparing poison and dispatching his nearest relatives, still his kingdom enjoyed a high degree of prosperity through the industry of his subjects, who were among the foremost at that time in the cultivation of the arts, sciences, and learning. In his will, Attalus bequeathed his kingdom and all his treasures to the Eoman people. They had long been in the habit of looking upon his kingdom as their property, and the will by which it was made over to them had probably been drawn up by the imbecile king in compliance with the command of the Eomans, a fact which is clearly alluded to by the ancients themselves.5 The wealth which now poured in upon Eome marks more distinctly than even the conquest of Macedonia the beginning of that degenerate con dition in which we find the Eomans in the history of the last century of the republic,6 for now all the luxuries and with them all the vices of the east invaded Italy like an epidemic disease. Soon after the death of Attalus, Aristonicus, a natural son of Eumenes, the father of Attalus, came forward, refusing to recognise the will of Attalus, and claiming the kingdom as his lawful inheritance. He found many supporters among the people of Pergamus, and placed himself at the head of a general insur rection of the Lydians and Ionians. The war which now ensued lasted longer than any one could have anticipated, for the consul P. Licinius Crassus, who was sent against the insurgents in 5 See Horat. Carm. ii. 18, 5; Sal- 6 Plin. Hist. Nat. xxxiii. 11. lust, Fragm. p. 189, ed. Bipont."], [401, "THE KINGDOM OF PERGAMUS. 381 B.c.131 with a very strong army, was more anxious to enrich him self than to subdue the enemy. After the expiration of his consulship he fell into the hands of the enemy and was killed ; but his successor, M. Perpema, succeeded in bringing the war to a close. Aristonicus was taken prisoner at Stratonicea, and car ried to Eome in triumph, where he was strangled in a prison. Perperna died immediately after his victory, and the conquest of Asia was completed in B.C. 129 by his successor, M'. Aquirius. Mithridates V., king of Pontus, who had assisted the Eomans in the war against Aristonicus, now received Phrygia as a reward, and the remainder of the kingdom of Pergamus became a Boman province under the name of Asia. This conquest in the east, inde pendent of the vices and luxuries with which it made the Eomans acquainted, also contained the seeds of new wars which they afterwards had to wage against the king of Pontus. Within the last 120 years, Eome, by her successive and victorious wars, had established her dominion in nearly all the countries on the Mediterranean : Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the minor islands round the coast of Italy, were acquired in the first two Punic wars ; and the whole territory of Carthage was the prize gained in the third and last struggle with her Punic rival. Macedonia and Ulyricum, together with Thessaly and Epirus, and Greece (em bracing Peloponnesus and Greece proper) had likewise become Eoman provinces. Spain after the departure of the Carthaginians also fell under the dominion of Eome, although the brave and patriotic Celtiberians, the Lusitanians and other tribes boldly continued to maintain then- independence against the tyrannical oppression of Eome, and were not entirely reduced even after the destruction of Numantia, though the country was constituted a Eoman province. The most recent acquisition of Eome was the province of Asia. Her dominion in the north of Italy was now more firmly established than ever, as the warlike tribes on the banks of the Po, after many a useless struggle, were obliged to submit ; and the Eomans even ventured to attack the Gauls in the Alps."], [402, "382 CHAPTEE XXIII. INTERNAL CONDITION OF ROME, AND HER RELATION TO FOREIGN NATIONS. The constitution of the Eoman republic, which had attained its perfect development previous to the outbreak of the second Punic war, had for a time been secured in its healthful working by the virtue and patriotism of the citizens, by then reverence for law, and by then- observing the sanctity of then oath. But when, afterwards, these virtues disappeared, when the acquisition of wealth became the sole and absorbing object of then exertions, when faith was violated, and religion neglected and despised, the constitution, although not a particle of it had been changed, was found wholly inadequate to its purposes, and instead of a blessing, became the source of great misfortunes ; for it is not the mere form of a constitution that makes a nation happy, it is the spirit and character of the nation itself. Eome was in the singular position of a state with a constitution framed and intended for a single city, which city yet had aimed at, and gradually acquired the dominion of the world, without the rest of the world being allowed to share either in the good or the evil of her constitu tion, but standing to the city in the relation of a subject to his sovereign. The Eoman senate, a body of men of the greatest firmness, prudence, and cunning, were ever increasing then power and influence, and foreign nations and kings had to obey then commands; while on the other hand the people, now no longer the ancient plebeian commonalty, strove more and more to obtain and enjoy the advantages acquired in long and bloody wars. The larger the body of Eoman citizens became, the more then influence increased upon all public matters. But there was among them a"], [403, "383 CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE. class which threatened sooner or later to become most dangerous to the safety of the state : these were the poor, and freedmen, with then children; for although the class of freedmen was limited to the four city tribes, yet it was at all times easy to bribe them and to use them as tools for the worst purposes. The poor had sunk into the most abject poverty; and Polybius : showed his clear insight into political matters, when he predicted, that the consti tution of Bome would be destroyed by her own people. The tribuneship had entirely changed its original character, for shortly after the time at which we have now arrived, the tribunes be came, by virtue of their office, members of the senate, accord ing to a law of C. Atinius, which, however, does not seem to have remained long in force. They acted in many cases like real despots ; and there are instances in which they threw both the consuls into prison, because, at a levy of troops, they refused to comply with then wishes. At another time a censor was ordered to be thrown from the Tarpeian rock, and was saved only by the interference of other tribunes. These and other wild acts of the tribunes are not unfrequent during this period. It seems to have been about the year b.c 167 that an attempt was made to devise some check upon the power of the tribunes; for it was enacted by the Aelian and Fufian law that the assemblies convoked by the tribunes (concilia), should, like the comitia, be liable to be dissolved by signs in the heavens, such as thunder and lightning. As the observation and interpretation of these signs belonged to the augurs, they thus obtained a veto upon the transactions of the tribunes, just as the tribunes had a veto on those of the govern ment. It is only to be regretted that the Eomans here, for a good purpose, made use of a means in which they themselves had ceased to have any faith. The enlisting of soldiers at this period was often a source of vehement contention, and the consuls at levies often committed acts of injustice and favomitism. This led to a law, passed in B.C. 152, which enacted that henceforth the i vi. 56."], [404, "384 HISTORY OF ROME. soldiers should be drawn by lot,2 and that every tribune should have the right of exempting ten of the men thus drawn from being drafted for the legions. The distinction between patricians and plebeians had long ceased to be of any political importance ; and while the number of patrician families were decreasing at a rapid rate, that of illustrious plebeians was constantly increasing ; but in its place another distinction had gradually been formed between what were called the illustres or optimates, that is, the nobles, and the common or obscure people (obscuri), without, however, there being the slightest legal inequality between them; for the law did not recognise the distinction at all, it being founded upon nothing but a certain feeling and custom. How much the number of patricians must have been reduced, and how little the people at this time heeded the distinction between patricians and plebeians, may be inferred from the fact, that in B.C. 131, both the censors were plebeians, without there having been any contest or dispute about it. The class ot persons who had gradually stept into the place of the old patrician aristocracy consisted mainly of wealthy and distinguished plebeian families, whose title to the high offices, originally founded upon personal merit and ability, had by custom and practice become hereditary in their families. They, therefore, now formed a new aristocracy, and in their turn they were as exclusive and as oppressive to the people as the patricians had been to the plebeians. Their great rallying point was the senate, in which, ever since the time of the Hannibalian war, the number of plebeians had far exceeded that of the patricians. Persons aspiring to the great honours of the republic, and belong ing to families of which no member had as yet filled any of the great offices of the state, were termed novi homines, or upstarts, in contradistinction to those whose ancestors had been invested with these offices ; and owing to the jealous exclusiveness of the illustrious fanrilies, a novus homo rarely succeeded in raising him self to the consulship. Beside\\ihe free population in Bome and 1 Appian, Hispan. 49."], [405, "LEGAL ENACTMENTS. 385 Italy, there now were large numbers of slaves, who were employed in those works which had formerly been performed by free men : the consequence of this was the idleness of the citizens, then- neglect of agriculture, and their indulgence in vice and debauchery; while a large class of free men were deprived of the means of gaining their subsistence. The constitution having reached its complete development, the legislative enactments had, for a long time past, been chiefly of a disciplinarian character : these laws, which were repeatedly enacted and enforced, were intended to check the growing love of luxuries in the dress and mode of living of the Eomans.3 Thus the Orchian law, in B.C. 181, limited the number of persons who were allowed to meet at repasts ; 4 and the Fannian law, in b.c 161, limited the expenditure to be incurred at banquets- This latter law was afterwards reinforced, and more strictly defined, by the Didian and Licinian laws.4 But these and many other laws which interfered with the practices of private life could not stop the current in its rapid progress. In order to prevent the high offices of the republic from faffing into the hands of young and inexperienced persons, some restrictive regulations seem to have existed as early as the time of the Hannibarian war;6 but in B.C. 180, the tribune L. Viilius carried a law\" defining the lowest age at which a person should be eligible to the several magistracies : this law enacted that a candidate for the quaestorship should be at least thirty-oiie years old; for the aedileship, thirty-seven ; for the praetorship, forty ; and for the consulship, forty-three.8 It had also been found necessary to suppress the practice of bribing judges with presents ; and we find that as early as B.C. 204, the tribune M. Cincius Alimentus carried a law 9 forbidding to give presents to judges. The increase of the population in the city, and of the increased 3 Leges sumptuariae. 7 Liv. xxv. 2. 4 Macrob.

The juris diction within the city had been exercised by the praetor and popular courts : in B.C. 242, a second praetor was appointed, either to administer justice to the many strangers settled at Bome,10 or, as some believe, to command the reserve army in Italy when the consuls were engaged abroad. The jurisdiction of these praetors, however, extended only to civil cases and minor offences ; those which affected the well-being of the state, and all criminal cases, being tried by the people, who elected for this purpose quaestores parricidii. After the publication of the Flavian table, the patricians had devised several new legal formulae, which they again kept secret, until, in B.C. 202, the jurist Sex. Aerius Catus made them known to the people, and thus offered them every facility of acquiring legal knowledge. But as the laws became more and more numerous and complicated, the litigant parties began to employ patrons or advocates to plead then causes. This custom became very general after the year B.C. 253, when the illustrious Tib. Coruncanius was the first plebeian pontifex maximus. At the time at which we have now arrived, legal disputes were indeed so frequent, that the praetor alone could not get through the business, and accordingly assistants were given him under the title of centumviri, three of whom were chosen from each of the thirty-five tribes, so that then whole body amounted to 105. Out of this body the praetor nominated for each particular case the judices who formed, at least after the time of the Gracchi, a sort of jury. The great power which the Boman governorspossessed in the pro vinces, and the temptations they found there to enrich themselves at the expense of the provincials, led, in B.C. 149, to a law bemg carried by the tribune L. Calpurnius Piso,11 for the appointment of a commission, before which the provincials might bring an action against any governor who had been guilty of extortion during his administration. Laws with the same or similar objects, ln Praetor peregrinus. \" Lex Calpurnia de pecuniis repetundis."], [407, "ADMINISTRATION OF THE REPUBLIC. 387 such as to prevent bribery at elections,12 high treason against the republic,13 and peculation,14 were afterwards repeatedly enacted, but generally with little effect ; for the love of money and power deadened every other feeling, and the judges, generally speaking were not much better than those whose acts of injustice they were called upon to punish. The provinces, with the exception of those in which Greek was spoken, were gradually Eomanised by the armies which were kept there, and by the introduction of the Latin language. The duties of a city police were performed as before, by the plebeian and curale aediles ; and the censors, in many cases, were very active, not only to preserve the ancient mode of rife, but to embellish the city with various useful and ornamental works. Thus in B.C. 174, the censors ordered the streets of Eome to be paved, and the roads outside the city to be covered with gravel : aqueducts, bridges, temples, and other public build ings were constructed to add to the splendour of the sovereign city ; but it is a remarkable fact, that in order to check the grow ing love of pleasure and idle amusements, P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, when in B.C. 184 the censors had commenced building a theatre for the performance of dramatic compositions, caused all the building materials that had been brought together to be sold by public auction, and a decree of the senate forbade the erection of any building in which the people should witness the plays in a sitting attitude, either within the city, or at a distance of less than 1000 paces from it.15 As the number of slaves rendered the city rather unsafe at night, watchmen were appointed, whose duties began at sun-set, and who stood under the super intendence of a commission called the quinqueviri. This office had been instituted soon after the war with Pyrrhus. The more Eome had come into contact with foreign powers, and the more complicated were her relations with them, the more 15 Liv.

Max. ii. 4, sec. 2. 12 Leges de ambitu. 13 Be majestate. 14 Be peculatu. a 2"], [408, "388 HISTORY OF ROME. she had an opportunity of developing her dangerous policy, the only objects of which were her own aggrandisement and the destruction of other states. The Eoman ambassadors who were sent to Africa, Greece, and Asia, were the most dangerous enemies of those countries, though they often went under the pretext of establishing peace and friendship. They contrived to find out the weak points of a state, and the means of overthrow ing it; to scatter the seeds of confusion and discord, and of future wars, which might be commenced as soon as the interests of Eome should make them desirable. The stronger among the foreign states and princes were disarmed and disabled by all the intrigues that cunning and fraud could devise, while the weaker were made friends of, and often allowed the enjoyment of apparent freedom until it suited the purpose of Eome to subdue them : all her allies were closely watched, and burdens were imposed upon them as heavy as if they had been subjects. Nations and kings who were unable to inspire Eome with fear were often treated haughtily and despotically, in order to provoke then resentment, and thus to obtain a specious pretext for attacking and subduing them. That vaunted disinterestedness and generosity which the Eomans sometimes showed tow-ards others was, therefore, nothing else than the dictate of a subtle and cunning policy, which never scrupled to make small or momentary sacrifices for the purpose of afterwards gaining greater advantages. In this manner Bome gradually threw the net of her policy over all nations, often without then being aware of it until it was too late. It would be erroneous to believe that Eome was hurried on to the dominion of the world by a sort of fatality of which she herself was unconscious : all her steps and movements were well matured and calculated before-hand ; one victory led her to another ; and the more cautiously she acted, the better she suc ceeded. Her work was facilitated by the circumstance that the powers against which she fought were in a state of weakness and decay. The many and important conquests which Eome had made"], [409, "389 FINANCIAL AFFAIRS. beyond the boundaries of Italy naturally increased the revenues of the republic. Before these new resources had been opened to her, the almost uninterrupted succession of wars had often drained the public treasury, and compelled the republic to have recourse to public loans of money to meet the unavoidable expenditure ; but such momentary embarrassments and difficulties had no evil effects upon the state, which was not, like Carthage, dependent solely upon a well-stocked treasury, but upon the vigour, energy, and virtue of its citizens. On two occasions, about the end of the first and in the course of the second Punic war, the state had been under the necessity of artificially raising the ordinary value of its coinage in order to be able to pay its debts,16 of covering its expenses by the voluntary contributions of the citizens, and of renewing the salt monopoly ; but even these things did not affect the financial administration of the senate ; and the entire social life of the Eomans was characterised by a love of strict order and honesty. The generals, on the whole, conscientiously delivered up to the treasury the booty which they had acquired in foreign countries, though isolated in stances of peculation are now and then mentioned. It was not till after the conquest of Macedonia that the republic became really wealthy, in consequence of which the poll-tax was taken off from the Eoman citizens. Besides the occasional large sums which were carried to Eome after victories and conquests, the state derived a regular revenue from the tribute of its allies and the provinces, whose inhabitants were burdened with a heavy property tax, and with many ordinary as well as extraordinary payments and services to the governors and then often numerous retinue ; from the tithes17 and rents of the public domain in Italy and the provinces, where many wealthy persons held their estates as tenants of the Eoman republic; from tolls,18 and from the rent of salt-works, mines, and pasture lands. The twentieth part of the value of slaves when manumitted also formed an important 16 Plin. Hist. Nat. xxxiii. 13. \" Becumae. 1 Portoria."], [410, "390 HISTORY OF ROME. source of revenue, as the manumission of slaves was a matter of very frequent occurrence. Bome's navy, notwithstanding her wars with Carthage and Antiochus, never rose to a flourishing condition, for the service of the navy was thought degrading to a citizen, and the marines were taken only from the lower classes or from the maritime towns of Italy. It was her allies, and especially the Ehodians, who provided Eome with fleets when they were wanted, for the fleets of Syria, Macedonia, Ulyricum and Carthage were destroyed. In her land-forces, in the art of besieging, and the engines and instruments necessary for it, she had, on the other hand, by this time reached a very high degree of perfection, as the Eomans always adopted from their enemies that which appeared to them useful or likely to improve their own system. Eome had now outwardly attained the highest degree of prosperity, and nothing seemed able to check her in her victorious progress towards the supremacy of the world ; but aheady a fatal disease was secretly working her ruin ; it had eaten deeply into the flesh of the state : this was the cancer of poverty, on the one hand, and avarice, extravagance, cruelty, treachery, and licentiousness, on the other. The time for applying suitable remedies had been allowed to pass away, and the noble-minded men, who now came forward to put their hands to the wheel, fell victims to then own schemes, or were crushed under the influence of vice and tyranny."], [411, "391 CHAPTEE XXIV. TIBERIUS AND CAIUS SEMPRONIUS GRACCHUS, THEIR LEGISLATION AND DESTRUCTION. We have hitherto accompanied the Eomans in their victorious career abroad, and seen how by the success of then arms, sup ported by a firm and cunning policy, they subdued the nations round the Mediterranean, and reached a power before which every other that ventured to compete with them was crumbled into dust ; but henceforward our attention will be mainly en gaged by the violent internal shocks and convulsions which the republic had to suffer in consequence of the state of things described in the preceding chapter. From these internal con vulsions there arose a series of the most dreadful of all wars, those of citizens against citizens, which destroyed the vital energies of the state, leading finally to the overthrow of the republican government, and the establishmeut of a monarchy under which the empire eked out its miserable existence for a period of about 500 years. For a long time no portion of the domain-land of the republic had been distributed among the citizens ; and as, during the incessant wars, many of the small landed proprietors had been obliged to neglect then farms, and finally to sell them to their wealthier neighbours, the former had more and more sunk into the depths of poverty, while the wealth of the latter had been increasing at an enormous rate. The state of things seems to have been worst felt in Etruria. During the long internal peace which Eome had enjoyed, the power of the senate gradually became so firmly established and so vast, that the assemblies of the people, in many respects,"], [412, "392 HISTORY OF ROME. were little more than a tool in the hands of the aristocracy or the optimates. The elections of the high magistrates were anything but free, since the illustrious families were in the exclusive pos session of the most important and lucrative offices. These opti mates, as they were called, accumulated their wealth in the provinces, and at home amused and corrupted the people by the distributions of money or food, by games, spectacles, and bribes. In purchasing the estates of the small landed proprietors, to whom the republic originally owed her greatness, they had acquired immense tracts of land which were cultivated by bands of slaves, while a large class of reduced free men, without a home or bread, were wandering about in the country with their wives and child ren, not having a foot of land which they could claim as then own, though they were told that they were the lords of the earth I1 At Eome itself tilings were not better : a numerous populace had gradually been formed, which, without property or industry, threatened sooner or later to become most dangerous to the safety of the state, as they might be used, by any one who chose to buy them, for the worst purposes. Many undoubtedly saw the abyss at the verge of which the republic had arrived, but no one had the corn-age to interfere. At length there arose two illustrious plebeians, who were resolved to ameliorate the condition of the lower classes and thereby to save the republic from ruin. These were the two brothers Tiberius and Caius Sempronius Gracchus, sons of that Tib. Gracchus who had distinguished himself in Spain by his justice and humanity, and of Cornelia, the daughter of the elder Scipio, a woman renowned above all others in Eoman history for her intellect, her affection, her greatness of soul and the refinement of her manners. Sempronia, the sister of the two Gracchi, was married to the younger Scipio, the destroyer of Carthage. Then birth alone entitled them to look forward to the greatest honours which the republic could bestow upon her citizens ; and the education which they had received principally at the hands of their excellent mother gave them another claim ; 1 Pint. Tib. Gracch. 9,"], [413, "TIB. SEMPRONIUS GRACCHUS. 393 but the circumstances of the time in which they rived pointed out to them the part they had to act in the history of then- country. Tib. Sempronius Gracchus was nine years older than his brother Caius : his mind had been trained by Cornelia, and im proved by his intercourse with Greek philosophers and the wise Laelius ; lastly, like most other Eoman nobles he had leamt much in the practical school of the camp, for he had served in the last war against Carthage, and in that against the Numantines he had saved the rives of 20,000 Eoman citizens by a treaty which the Spaniards were prevailed upon by him to conclude. It is said that on his march to Spain, as he passed through the fertile country of Etruria, his just indignation was roused by the sight of numberless slaves in chains, who cidtivated the extensive estates of the wealthy aristocrats, while thousands of free citizens were pining in poverty. His pure and noble sold was seized with a deep-felt sympathy for suffering humanity, which led him, after his return from Spain, to try the only remedy that seemed yet practicable. Seventy years before this period, Q. Laelius is said to have perceived the evil, and to have thought of attempting a cure, but he gave up the idea in despair. The Licinian agrarian law had limited the domain-land to be occupied by one person to 500 jugera, and had ordained that all who were thus tenants of the republic should pay a small annual rent ; but how little this law was observed even in the life time of the law-giver and by himself, we have aheady had occa sion to remark : as the law itself still existed, having never been repealed, the discontinuance of its observance was an abuse which any one had a right to denounce and to remove. Tiberius Gracchus determined to renew the Licinian law. All those who possessed more of the public land than the law permitted were concerned in the matter; they were the aristocracy, and they resolved to make a most determined opposition to any scheme which might drive them from then possessions. The object of Gracchus was, by taking away the surplus from the present occu pants and distributing it among the poor, to afford the latter the s 3"], [414, "394 HISTORY OF ROME. means of riving, and change them from an idle populace into industrious husbandmen. He did not allow himself to be inti midated by the threats of his opponents : his humanity, affability, and kindness, his straightforward and upright conduct, and his generous interference with the Numantines, had secured him the greatest popularity at Bome ; and when he presented himself as a candidate for the tribuneship, he was elected without any difficulty, for the year B.C. 133. His plans were well known, and many of the most distin guished men of the time, such as Appius Claudius his father-in law, and P. Mucius Scaevola the great jurist, although they knew that they themselves would be losers by his scheme, were generous enough to support him with all then influence. En couraged by these and other friends, he brought forward a bill enforcing the Licinian law, with these modifications : that any man who had two sons might have 250 jugera beyond his own 500, for each of them ; that the distribution of the surplus and unassigned public land in equal portions among the poor should be con ducted by a permanent college of three men (triumviri); and that the lots assigned to each should not be transferable by purchase or sale. The abstract legality of this measure no one can dispute, for the state was the real owner of all public land, and those who occupied it were in reality nothing but tenants-at-wiil of the state. But the abuse and violation of the Licinian law had so long been connived at, that practically persons had got into the habit of looking upon then- possession of public land as if it had been then- real property; and accordingly many had kid out large sums of money upon such land, or had erected buildings upon it, while others had bond fide purchased tracts and paid the full price of its value, for no one seems to have thought that the state would ever reclaim it as its property. Now with regard to buildings, his law contained a clause that they should be valued, and that those who had erected them should receive their value in money from the public treasury. Had there been a similar clause to indemnify those who had purchased public land for its"], [415, "TIB. SEMPRONIUS GRACCHUS. 395 real value, all reasonable demands would have been satisfied, though it would not by any means have allayed the opposition ; but unfortunately this point was neglected. The senatorial or aristocratic party offered the most desperate opposition to the bill, and had recourse to the most disgraceful means to defeat Gracchus : he was called a demagogue, a rioter, and a mutineer; and a sort of conspiracy, headed by P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica and Q. Pompeius, was entered into against him. His opponents succeeded in gaining over to their side one of his colleagues, M. Octavius, who was prevailed upon to put his veto on the bill. As Octavius would have been a loser by it, Gracchus offered to make good the loss out of his own means if Octavius would give up his opposition. This offer was refused, and Gracchus now implored and entreated him, but intimated at the same time, that if Octavius persisted he should be obliged to proceed to extremities, and propose to the people to deprive him of his office of tribune. When Octavius still persevered, Gracchus put his deposition to the vote, and the office was taken from him. This act of Gracchus has often been censured very severely, because it was unprecedented in the history of Eome ; but the necessity of the case compelled Gracchus to act as he did ; and after all, the citizens of a republic surely have the right to deprive a man of his office if he does not discharge his duties to their satisfaction. However, the antagonists of Gracchus had now got a handle against him, and they branded the deposition of Octavius as a violation of the constitution. After this the agrarian law was carried without opposition, and a permanent triumrirate was appointed, consisting of the two Gracchi and Appius Claudius. The people were enthusiastic in their attachment to and admiration of Gracchus, but in the senate he was insulted in the most unbridled manner, and the aristocracy now set all then- engines at work to thwart and ob struct him in carrying the law into effect. About this time messengers arrived in Eome with the will of Attalus, who had just died, and had left his treasures and kingdom to the Eoman people. Gracchus availed himself of this opportunity to bring"], [416, "396 HISTORY OF ROME. in a bill,2 that the money which had been bequeathed to the people should be distributed among those who received assignments of land, in order to enable them to purchase cattle, and the implements necessary for husbandly ; or, according to others, that the money should be distributed among those for whom no land could be pro vided. He is further said to have proposed, or at least to have con templated proposing, several other measures designed to limit the power of the senate, to secure the right of appeal from the senate to the people, and to shorten the time that citizens should be obliged to serve in the army. But his opponents gradually succeeded, by calumnies and mis representations, in making the fickle populace look upon their benefactor with suspicion and mistrust ; and even the absurd report that he was aiming at kingly power found credence among them. Gracchus began to see that if he were not protected by his sacred character as tribune, his rife would be in the greatest danger ; and he accordingly offered himself as a candidate for the tribuneship for the year following. It was unfortunate for him that the election took place at the time when the country-people were occupied with the harvest, and could not come to Bome, so that the most respectable part of the electors were unable to attend. The first two tribes had already voted in his favour, when the opposition party stepped in, and declared the proceedings to be illegal. A want of firmness in the tribune who presided at the election, and the ensuing disputes, occupied the rest of the day, and the business was to be resumed on the following morn ing. Gracchus, who knew that the optimates were planning ks destruction, went about with his child, imploring the protection of the people ; and a large crowd conducted him home, watching about his house all night. In the morning he himself was doubt ful whether he should go to the assembly or not ; but his friends urged him not to despair. The people were assembled in the open space, or area, in front of the Capitol, wlrile the senate was holding its meeting in the neighbouring temple of Fides, from whence the proceedings of the assembly could be observed. As ' Livy, Epit. 58, says that he only promised to bring forward this bill."], [417, "MURDER OF TIB. GRACCHUS. 397 the business was going on, Gracchus was informed by a friend, that, the consuls refusing to use force against the people, the senators themselves were preparing to come to the assembly and kill him. The people, on hearing that his rife was in danger, made preparation to repel force by force. P. Scipio Nasica, a wealthy and vehement aristocrat, seized this moment, and called upon the senators to follow him and save the republic. The senators, led by Nasica, and armed with sticks, clubs, and the legs of the benches on which they had been sitting, rushed among the people, and knocked down or killed all who opposed them. Gracchus himself was skin in the tumult, and his body, along with those of 300 others, was thrown into the Tiber. Many of his friends were afterwards sent into exile, or put to death, by the infuriated optimates, in most instances without any judicial verdict. The sacred head of the popular party had thus fallen in the noblest contest in which a statesman could be engaged, in a contest for the protection of the poor and the oppressed ; but the agrarian law was still in force, and the triuinvirs continued then operations, M. Fulvius Flaccus being appointed in the place of Tib. Gracchus. Scipio Nasica went to Pergamus, in order to escape from the fury and indignation of the people, and never saw his country again. The spirit of the murdered Tiberius survived in the college of the tribunes, who through him had become aware of the greatness of then power, but the less noble-minded among them were driven to excesses, and ambitious efforts, which could lead to no good. In b.c 132, Scipio, the destroyer of Carthage and Numantia, returned from Spain : he approved of the murder of his brother in-law, and placed himself at the head of the senatorial party,3 3 Even when he was in Spain and had proval of it in the Homeric line, received intelligence of the murder of (Odyss. i. 47) Tib.

Gracchus, and a man of great ability, but turbulent and unprincipled, being tri bune, brought forward a rogation that the people should have the right to re-elect the same person to the tribuneship as often as they pleased ; but Scipio successfully opposed the scheme. After the death of Appius Claudius, Carbo had been appointed bis successor in the triumvirate. One day, in B.C. 129, Scipio vigorously opposed the proceedings of the triumvirs, and in the evening went home to prepare for a fresh attack upon them the next day ; but in the morning he was found dead in his bed, and it is not improbable that there was some foundation for the report that he had been murdered by Carbo. Many persons were suspected, but the senate did not dare to investigate the matter \u2014 a proof of the frightful state of things. However, the popular party gained fresh strength every day, for Carbo carried a law, that henceforth the people should vote upon legislative measures by means of tablets;4 and C. Atinius Labeo, who had been ejected from the senate by the censor Metellus, carried a plebis citum, that the tribunes should have the right to convene the senate and vote in it.5 The question whether the Eoman franchise should not be granted to the Italian allies had been mooted even in the time of Tib. Gracchus ; but instead of promoting this plan, which would have brought incalculable blessings on Eome, the tribune M. Junius Pennus, in B.C. 126, carried a law by which all the aliens resident at Eome were ordered to quit the city.6 Caius Gracchus opposed him, but in vain. This act created the greatest exaspe ration in Italy ; and when, in the year following, M. Fulvius Fkccus, a man of honest intentions but of impetuous temper, who was then consul, proposed that all the Italians who desired it should receive the Eoman franchise, which proposal was rejected, several Italian towns seem to have risen, to demand with arms in hand what Eome so obstinately refused.

In order to prevent any further attempts, the senate had recourse to an expedient which is not uncommon in republics : the leaders of the popular party were sent away from the city ; C. Gracchus, in B.c. 126, being sent to Sardinia as quaestor to the consul L. Orestes; and Flaccus into Gaul, to support the Massirians against the Salluvii, a Celtic people on the banks of the Ehone, who had invaded the territory of Massiria. Flaccus succeeded in defeating them, and this formed the beginning of the Eoman dominion in southern Gaid. The war there was continued for several years against the Ailobroges and Arverni : in B.C. 122 the procon sul C. Sextius Calvinus founded the town of Aquae Sextiae (Aix) ; and in the year following, Q. Fabius Maximus made the southern part of Gaul a Boman province, whence, to this day, that part of France bears the name of Provence. In order to secure the Eoman dominion in Gaul, the consul Q. Marcius, in B.C. 118, founded the colony of Narbo Marcius, the modem Narbonne. But to return to the affairs of Eome itself : the optimates by the removal of the popular leaders gained only a short respite, and the delay of a movement whose progress was unavoidable. C. Gracchus, like his brother, had been trained for public life ; but he possessed more talent and skill as a politician and an orator: although more vehement than Tiberius, he had the same noble and disinterested patriotism, and his impressive eloquence gained for him the greatest popularity. But the murder of his brother having destroyed all his hopes, and to some extent paralyzed bis energy, he would willingly have kept aloof from all participation in public affairs, had he not been urged on by the spirit of his brother, on the one hand, who is said to have appeared to him in his dreams, and on the other by the shameful conduct of the optimates, which even the meekest of men could not have borne. They con trived means to keep him in Sardinia as long as possible ; but after the lapse of two years he suddenly appeared inBome, B.C. 124, without having asked leave of Orestes. He defended his conduct,"], [420, "400 HISTORY OF ROME. and was acquitted ; but his opponents neglected no opportunity of annoying him with calumnies and charges which had not a shadow of truth, and only placed his innocence in a more conspicuous light. Notwithstanding the opposition of the whole body of optimates he was elected tribune for the year B.C. 123. His first measures were directed against the murderers and enemies of his brother; and he accordingly proposed that a person once deprived by the people of one office should not be eligible to another ; but this bill he afterwards withdrew at the request of his mother. His second rogation was, that any one who had put to death or sent into exile a Eoman citizen, without a formal trial, should be liable to a public prosecution. Aster these prelinrinary measures, he renewed the agrarian law of his brother, the carry ing of which into effect had been obstructed in every possible way. After this he proposed a comprehensive series of laws, some of which were carried, and all of which were intended to raise the lower classes, remove abuses, and limit the power of the senate. One of them ordained that the soldiers, independently of then pay, should also be equipped by the state ; and that no one should lie obliged to serve in the army before the completion of Iris seven teenth year: another enacted that public granaries should be estab lished, from which the poor at certain times were to receive corn at a very low price.7 A third was devised to establish the prac tice that the order hi which the centuries were to vote in the comitia should be determined by lot.8 A fourth forbade the putting to death a Eoman citizen, except by the command of the people themselves. These enactments secured to C. Gracchus the highest possible degree of popularity, and he was re-elected tribune for B.C. 122, without any difficulty. He entered upon the second part of his legislative activity9 7 This law remained in force till proposed. about b.c. 74, when it was supplanted 9 We here assign certain measures bv another similar lex frumentaria. to his second tribuneship, but it must Cicero, Brut. 62, Be Off. ii. 21. be observed that our authorities do 8 It is more than doubtful whether not distinguish the time at which the this law was ever carried or even several laws were brought forward."], [421, "C. SEMPRONIUS GRACCHUS. 401 with a reform of certain courts of justice,10 in which all cases of mal-admiiristration were tried, and which had hitherto been com posed of senators exclusively. Justice had been administered there with the most barefaced partiality, and the judges had allowed themselves to be bribed to an incredible extent. This evil was felt most severely by the provincials, when they had oc casion to complain of Eoman governors who had been guilty of extortion or oppression; for the judges in such cases were men of the same class, and often in the same predicament, as the accused: at any rate they had the same interests; and the spoils of the pro vinces filled the pockets not only of the governors, but also of the judges. The right possessed by the provincials of bringing an action of extortion against a governor was in fact a greater mis fortune for them than if they had possessed no such right at all. C. Gracchus endeavoured to put a stop to this abuse by enacting, that henceforth the courts which investigated such cases should be composed of equites,11 or the wealthy capitalists, who formed a sort of middle class between the aristocracy and the people, and who seemed to be a desirable equipoise to the senators. By this law he gained over to his plans the wealthiest and most respectable citizens, and gave a serious blow to the power of the senate. The equites henceforth seem to have supplied, at least to some extent, the popular courts also, for aster this time the latter are mentioned very rarely. This judicial law of C. Gracchus, which remained in force down to the legislation of Sulla, shows more clearly than anything else that he was not a demagogue, a name by which he has so frequently been designated. Another law, which likewise did away with a great abuse, enacted that every year, previous to the election of the consuls, the senate should determine the pro vinces which were to be assigned to them. By far the most important attempt of C. Gracchus, though unfortunately an unsuccessful one, was to confer the Eoman fran- 10 The judicia publica. 5), the judicia were composed of 300 \" Appian, Be Bell.

His object was thereby to introduce a better element into the Eoman population, and thus to produce a regeneration of the republic ; and what he intended to do was no more than what the allies themselves had aheady and justly demanded, but what Eome restised to grant, until, at a somewhat later time, she was compelled by one of the most dangerous and destructive wars she was ever engaged in. We cannot here follow up all the measures which C. Gracchus actually brought forward, or intended to bring forward : suffice it to say, that his comprehensive mind overlooked no branch of the admi nistration in which useful and salutary reforms could be intro duced ; and at the time that he was engaged in these important kbours, he superintended in person, and with the greatest strict ness, the making or repairing of roads, bridges, and other public works ; he also conducted the distribution of public land, and founded several colonies in Italy in which the Latins and Italians were allowed to take part. While C. Gracchus was thus quietly proceeding with his great work, the senate had recourse to a peculiar but disgraceful kind of stratagem. M. Livius Drusus, a man distinguished for his wealth and eloquence, and a colleague of Gracchus in the tribune ship, was prevailed upon to try to outbid him in the proposal of popular measures, and thereby to undermine his popularity. The plan succeeded ; for the popidace then, as at other times, were not concerned about motives, and followed the man who offered them the greater momentary advantages. Livius Drusus abolished the tithes upon the lands distributed among the poor, and proposed to found twelve colonies, each consisting of 3000 Eoman citizens. It seems to have been about this time that Gracchus set out to found a colony near the site of the ancient Carthage. He returned to Eome after an absence of only seventy days, about the time that the consuls for the next year were to be elected. L. Opimius, 12 Plut. C. Gracch. 5 ; Veil.

When the latter offered himself a third time as a candidate for the tribuneship, he found himself deceived in his expectations : the people did not elect him. But he still remained one of the triumvirs. Being now divested of his sacred character of tribune, the senatorial party showed then* intentions more and more unre servedly. On one occasion, when Opimius had assembled the people with a view to abolish the laws of Gracchus, a tumult arose, and the senate issued a proclamation investing the consuls with dictatorial power. The confusion soon became general, and Grac chus, with his friend Fulvius Flaccus, escaped to the Aven tine, where Flaccus had hastily assembled as many armed friends and slaves as he could, to defend himself and his party against the attacks of then opponents. Flaccus sent his son to the senate to negotiate for a truce, but the young man was thrown into prison and afterwards murdered. Thesenatorialpartythenmade the attack, and Flaccus was skin. Gracchus, who did all he could to avoid civil bloodshed, took to fright, and escaped to the sacred grove of the Furies, on the other side of the Tiber, but being overtaken by his pursuers, he desired a faithful slave who accompanied him to take away his life. A proclamation having been made promising that if any one would bring the head of Flaccus, or Gracchus, he should receive its weight in gold, one Septimuleius cut off the head of the latter, and having increased its weight by pouring molten lead into it, brought it to Opimius to receive the reward. The number of the slain in this affray is said to have amounted to 3000, the bodies of whom, together with those of the popular leaders, were ordered by Opimius to be thrown into the Tiber. All the other friends of Gracchus who fell into the hands of then enemies were thrown into prison and there strangled ; and when the optimates were satiated with blood, they committed the blas phemous mockery of dedicating a temple to Concord. Some of"], [424, "404 HISTORY OF ROME. those who belonged to the party of Gracchus became renegades : among them we find C. Papirius Carbo, who, when raised to the consulship, in B.C. 120, defended Opimius against the tri bune Q. Decius, who brought an action against him for having put to death Boman citizens without a trial. Carbo became the favourite of the aristocracy, but he found a formidable opponent in L. Licinius Crassus, whose sister Licinia had been married to C. Gracchus, and who drove Carbo to despair and suicide. This was the first important blow which the victorious party received ; but Crassus himself afterwards changed, and became one of then champions. The blessings which the Gracchi had so ardently desired to con fer upon then country were not realised : the agrarian law was not observed; and the wealthy ojitimates continued, as before, to purchase the lands of their poorer neighbours, or to drive them from then farms ; while the equites, being greatly intimidated by the outrages of the aristocracy, showed at first little inde pendence, and were found in the end to be as accessible to bribery and corruption as the senators had been.

FOREIGN WARS DURING THE PERIOD OP THE GRACCHI. \u2014 THE JUGURTIIINE WAR. C. MARIUS AND L. CORNELIUS SULLA. We have aheady mentioned the conquests which the Eomans, during this period, made in Gaul : we must here add that the Balearian islands were subdued by Q. Metellus, in b.c 123 j1 and the Dalmatians, who henceforth appear as subjects of Eome, by his brother L. Metellus, in B.C. 117. 2 But a far more import ant war was that against the usurper Jugurtha, king of Numidia, of which we have a masterly account by Sallust. It derives its importance, not so much from the great efforts which were made on both sides, as from the circumstance that it shows the moral degradation into which the Eomans had sunk ; for here we clearly see that no crime and no treachery either in war or in peace was thought disgraceful if it yielded only gain and profit, and how at Eome everything could be accomplished by money. The cor ruption of the senate as well as of the people, and of the com manders as well as of the soldiers, was displayed openly and without shame. Micipsa, the son of Masinissa, had been king of all Numidia ; that is, the country between Morocco and Triporis. Before his death, in B.C. 118, he gave his kingdom to his two sons, Hiemp sal and Adherbal, and to his adopted son Jugurtha ; and the three princes were to govern then kingdom as colleagues. Jugurtha, as a highly talented and captivating youth, had attracted Micipsa's attention at an early age ; but when the king discovered that the youth far excelled his own sons, he was prompted by a feeling of jealousy and fear to send him with an 1 Liv.

Epit. 62."], [426, "406 HISTORY OF ROME. army to Spain, to assist Scipio in his war against the Numan tines, with the hope that the young man would never return to Numidia. In Spain, Jugurtha gained the friendship of Scipio, and when he went back to Africa, Scipio gave him a recommenda tory letter to Micipsa, who not only became reconciled to him, but in his will placed him on an equality with his own sons. Jugurtha had become acquainted with the venality of the Eomans, some of whom are even said to have stimulated him to bring about a revolution and place himself alone on the throne of Numidia. The three princes could not possibly continue to rule together in peace and concord. Hiempsal, who was proud and ferocious, provoked Jugurtha, who took revenge by causing him to be mur dered, in B.C. 117. Jugurtha also made an attempt upon the rise of Adherbal, but the latter escaped, and hastened to Eome to implore the protection of the senate. The Eomans at first were inclined to investigate the matter, but the ten commissioners, among whom L. Opimius was the most conspicuous, were so overwhelmed with the golden bribes of Jugurtha that they de cided every thing according to his wishes. The kingdom was now divided between the two princes, and in such a manner that the best part was assigned to Jugurtha ; but this did not satisfy him : new quarrels arose, and Adherbal was besieged in his capital of Cirta, and killed, in B.C. 112. It was in vain that Eo man ambassadors again took him to account, for he bribed or deceived them in the most audacious manner. The tribune, C. Memmius, now showed his noble indignation at these disgraceful proceedings in Numidia, and by revealing the scandalous conduct of the Eoman ambassadors compelled the senate to decree war against Jugurtha in B.C. 111. The consul, L. Calpurnius Bestia, and his legate, M. Aemilius Scaurus, who had previously been one of the ambassadors, accordingly led an army into Africa. The war was for a time conducted honestly, but the Eomans, seeing that they might derive greater advantages by negotiations than by arms, concluded a peace with the enemy, and he nomi nally submitted to them. The whole transaction was a mere farce,"], [427, "THE JUGURTHINE WAR. 407 for the Eoman commanders were induced by bribes to let Jugurtha violate the terms of the peace in any way he pleased. When these things became known at Eome, they excited the greatest exasperation among those in whom the sense of honour had not yet become extinct. The bold and eloquent tribune, C. Memmius, again exposed the whole revolting system, and Jugurtha was summoned to Eome to account for his conduct. He came, but even now he might have escaped punishment, had he not had the audacity to murder Massiva, a grandson of Masi nissa, who was staying at Bome. Immediately after, he quitted Eome with these words, \" Oh, the venal city ! it will perish as soon as it can find a purchaser.\"3 Future ages saw the truth of this prediction, for in a.d. 193, Didius Jurianus literally pur chased the sovereignty of the Eoman empire. The senate now annulled aU transactions with Jugurtha, and sent the consul, Sp. Postumius Albinus, in B.C. 110, with an army to Africa. He conducted the war in a careless and slovenly manner ; and when the time for the consular election arrived, he went to Bome to attend the comitia, leaving the command of the army in the hands of his brother Aulus, who allowed himself to be imposed upon by the cunning Numidian in such a manner that he was surrounded by the enemy, lost his camp, and was compelled to submit to a most humiliating peace. The senate, however, refused to ratify it. At this time of misfortune and internal discord between the senate and people, Q. Caecirius Metellus, who was made consul for the year B.C. 109, undertook the command against Jugurtha. He conducted the war for two years in a manner which deserves the highest praise; for he was above the vices of his age, incorruptible, disinterested, and great as a statesman no less than as a general. His virtues, however, were obscured by bis over whelming aristocratic pride, and his contempt of the people. This trait in his character brought great misery on his country, 3 Urbern venalem, et mature perituram, si emptorem invenerit. Sallust, Jug. 35."], [428, "408 HISTORY OF ROME. for without it C. Marius would probably not have been irritated and provoked by him to that degree in which he was. When Metellus went to Africa he took with him C. Marius as his legate. He was a man of humble origin, but of a strong, most energetic, and ambitious mind : he was unable to brook the insolence of the optimates, who set all then energies at work to keep him down. He was a native of Arpinum, and had about him all the rustic severity of the early Eomans : despising the education and accomprislimentswhich in his time were the distinguishing features of Eomans of rank, he was unsurpassed, or rather unequalled, as a commander and a tactician. In his early life he is said to have been a common labourer, and then served as a common soldier in the army. But his extraordinary talents did not remain unnoticed ; for without any family connection or influence he rose from one office to another, and acquired considerable property. He was very superstitious, and the prophecies of a Syrian woman, of the name of Martha, had excited in him the strongest conviction that he was destined by fate to occupy the highest honours in the republic. But the nobles hated the ambitious upstart, who even in his tribuneship, B.C. 119, had exerted himself to check then power and influence. In the camp of Metellus he signal ised himself above all others ; and in B.C. 108, he resolved upon offering himself as a candidate for the consulship. Metellus not only opposed the scheme, but ridiculed his ambition in a most provoking manner. This conduct was more than Marius could bear ; he never forgot it afterwards ; and without asking for leave of absence, he went to Eome and sued for the consulship. He was received by the people with great enthusiasm : as a real demagogue he flattered them on every occasion, and was delighted in appearing among the populace as one of then- equals. By these means he gained the consulship for B.C. 107, with the com mission to bring the war against Jugurtha to a close. Metellus fancied that it was aheady terminated, and with great reluctance surrendered the command to Marius. But Jugurtha strengthened himself again by entering into an"], [429, "409 JUGURTHA TAKEN PRISONER. affiance with Bocchus, Iris father-in-law, king of Mauritania. Marius, in forming his army, set the old custom at naught, and enlisted large numbers of the poorer classes who had never before served in the legions : the nobles did not object to this inno vation, because it relieved them from the necessity of serving in the army ; but they were blind to its consequences, for they do not seem to have perceived how dangerous arms might become in the hands of such people, who greedy after booty did not think of serving their country, but attached themselves to the general who could reward then services most liberally. Marius was eminently successful against Jugurtha, yet it was not till his second campaign, in b.c 106, that the war came to a close. L. Cornelius Sulla, who had accompanied him as his quaestor to Africa, had nothing in common with him except his ambition : he belonged to a patrician family, and was a talented, refined, and accomplished man of the world. Marius had reduced Jugur tha so far, that his only hope now was in Bocchus ; but Sulla, by his cunning, gained over the Mauritanian king to the Eoman cause, and induced him to join in a plan of delivering Jugurtha into the hands of hisenemies. The scheme succeeded,and Jugurtha, in chains, was surrendered to Sulla, who directly brought him to the camp of Marius. He was afterwards carried to Eome in triumph, and starved to death in a prison. The war against Jugurtha was thus brought to its close by Sulla, whose fame still further stimulated the jealousy and hatred with which Marius regarded not only him, but the whole party of the optimates. During this period Eome had been at war for several years with the Scordisci, a Thracian people, whom they fought against with varying success, until, in B.C. 112, M. Livius Drusus drove them back into then own country, and forbade them to cross the river Danube. But conjointly with the Tribaffi they afterwards again invaded Macedonia, whence they were finally expelled in B.C. 107 by the proconsul M. Minucius. T"], [430, "410 CHAPTEE XXVI. WAR AGAINST THE CIMBRI AND TEUTONI. SECOND SERVILE WAR IN SICILY. DISTURBANCES AT ROME BY THE TRIBUNE L. APPULEICS SATURNINCS. \u2014 ACQUISITION OF CYRENE. Nothing could have happened more fortunately for Eome than the termination of the Jugurthine war at this time, for the republic required the talent and skill of Marius in a war com pared with which that against Jugurtha had been little and insig nificant, for swarms of barbarians were threatening to invade Italy from the north. About b.c 113 the Cimbri, probably a Celtic tribe, had been driven from then homes in the south-east of Europe by the Sarmatians, who were pressing westward. They appeared first in Noricum, in the north-east of the Adriatic, and on the banks of the Danube. Noricum was inhabited by Celts who stood under the protection of Bome, and it seems to have been there that they were joined by the Teutoni, who were undoubtedly Germans ; but the latter were detained in the east of Europe, and some years elapsed before they appeared in the western parts with the Cimbri. The Eomans sent an army under the consul Cn. Papirius Carbo to protect the passes of the Alps. The Cimbri had promised not to commit any hostilities against the friends of Eome ; but they were, nevertheless, treacherously attacked by the consul in the neighbourhood of Noreia. His conduct received its merited punishment, for he was completely defeated. The Cimbri, however, who seem to have sought alone on that occasion, did not follow up their victory by invading Italy, but turned towardsHelvetia, where they were joined by the Tigmini and Ambrones. They then threw themselves upon Gaul like an immense horde of nomades, theirwomen and children being carried"], [431, "411 THE CIMBRI AND TEUTONI. in a large number of wagons. The Belgae alone were brave and powerful enough to resist them. From thence the barba rians again turned southward, towards the Eoman province of Gaul, where they were met, in B.C. 109, by the consul M. Junius Silanus. The Cimbri sent an embassy to his camp and thence to Eome, praying that the Eomans would assign them a country to rive in, and promising to assist them whenever it might be required. As their petition was rejected, they attacked Silanus and defeated him. The consul L. Cassius Longinus, in B.C. 107, was equally unfortunate in the neighbourhood of the lake of Geneva, for he lost his army and his rife. Defeat thus followed after defeat, and the Eomans were unable to protect the Gauls, most of whose towns were taken and destroyed by the invaders. In B.C. 105, the proconsul Q. Servilius Caepio undertook the command of an army in Gaid. He ordered the town of Tolosa, which was very rich and had gone over to the Cimbri, to be plundered, and made immense booty. Another army, under the consul Cn. Manlius Maximus, occupied the country on the left of the river Ehone : he was unable to unite his forces with those of Caepio, who, from jealousy, and a desire not to share his laurels with the consul, kept his camp at a distance. At length however, when the legate M. Aurelius Scaurus had been taken and killed by the chief Boiorix, Caepio approached the Ehone. A battle was then fought in which Eome suffered a severer defeat than any she had yet sustained in this war. The two con sular armies were completely annihilated : 80,000 soldiers and 40,000 camp followers are said to have been slain. Caepio him self, to whose conduct the calamity was justly ascribed, escaped with ten men across the Ehone. The Eoman people deprived him of his imperium, and many years afterwards condemned him to death and confiscated his property. The Cimbri de stroyed all the booty they took, and hung the captive Eomans on trees ; but as then oidy object was to establish themselves somewhere they did not follow up then victory. All Italy, however, trembled as in the days of Hannibal, for it t 2"], [432, "412 HISTORY OF ROME. was expected that this formidable host would forthwith come down upon Italy. No one ventured to offer himself for the consulship, and C. Marius again was the only man to whom the whole republic looked with confidence: even his political opponents, seeing that the very existence of the republic was at stake, supported his elevation ; and though he had not yet returned from Numidia, he was in his absence raised to the con sulship for the year b.c 104. The same dignity was conferred upon him in the three following years. In the meantime, for tunately for Italy, the Cimbri after then victory did not cross the Alps, but went to Spain, which they traversed for a few years, committing as great ravages as the Vandals did at a much later time. The Celtiberians however successfully resisted them in then towns. In B.C. 102 the Cimbri returned to Gaul, where, in the meantime, the Teutoni also had arrived, and both seem now to have resolved upon invading Italy. Marius, after being raised to the consulship, devoted nearly all his time to making preparations for the war. He created and trained an entirely new army, which, for the most part, consisted of the populace, and the veterans whom he had brought back from Africa. When the Cimbri returned to Gaul he was aheady there with his new army, and had exercised ks men on the very ground on which they were to meet the enemy. He accustomed his men to the greatest hardships, and many perished under them, but the survivors were excellent sol diers. The Cimbri marched towards Noricum to invade Italy from that quarter, and the consul Q. Lutatius Catulus was sent in the direction of Trent to meet them. The Teutoni remained in Gaul, Marius, we know not why, retreating before them, and they passing by his camp jeered and mocked the Eomans. But when they arrived on the river Argenteus, they found that Marius had aheady reached its banks by a different road. He pitched his camp, perhaps intentionally, in such a manner that the soldiers could not go out to provide themselves with water except under arms. The skirmishes to which this circumstance"], [433, "DEFEAT OF THE CIMBRI AND TEUTONI. 413 gave rise led to a decisive battle in the neighbourhood of Aquae Sextiae (Aix), which lasted for two days. The skill and foresight of Marius, and the hot summer days which the barba rians were unable to endure, caused then complete defeat on the second day. They retreated to then wagons, but could not maintain then ground, and the whole nation was literally annihilated, for the survivors made away with themselves. Their king was taken prisoner. Just as Marius was offering up a sacrifice to testify his gratitude to the gods for this victory, mes sengers arrived from Eome to inform him that he had been elected consul for the fifth time, for B.C. 101. Half the danger was now removed, but just at this time the Cimbri were descending from the Eaetian Alps into the valley of the Adige. They poured in upon the country like a torrent, and Lutatius Catulus being unable to resist them was obliged to retreat even beyond the Po, and leave the towns north of the river to their fate. The Cimbri for a time spread over the plains of Lombardy, ravaging the country in a frightful manner. Marius, who had heard of the perilous position of his late col league, hastened from Gaul to Italy, and joined his army to that of Catulus. In a place called the Campi Eaudii, either near Verona or Verceike, he drew up his forces in battle array. The front lines of the Cimbri are said to have been bound together with chains so as to form an impregnable wall, whfle Marius placed his lines in such a position that the sun and the wind were against the barbarians. The great battle was fought on the 30th of July, B.C. 101 : the fate of the Cimbri was the same as that of the Teutoni ; 14,000 are said to have fallen on the field of battle, and 60,000 to have been taken prisoners, who were afterwards sold as slaves. A small band of the Cimbri and Teutoni, the only survivors of the barbarians, had taken up their abode on the Meuse, in the neighbourhood of Namur, where half a century later they were found by Julius Caesar1. Marius celebrated his victories in a most magnificent triumph. ' Caesar, Be Bell. Gall. ii. 29."], [434, "414 HISTORY OF ROME.

The height on which he now stood made him giddy and overbearing, and it would have been better for ks fame as well as for his country if he had died on the day of ks triumph. At the time when Marius was engaged in Gaul against the Teutoni, a second servile war broke out in Sicily. Some symp toms of the danger arising from too large a slave population had been manifested before in Campania; but in b.c 102 the avarice of the praetor, P. Licinius Nerva, brought the matter to a crisis in Sicily. He manumitted all the slaves in the island who were natives of a Eoman province, but compelled those who were born in other countries to remain in their wretched condition. The latter, therefore, attempted to break their chains by force. The frightful and destructive war which now broke out lasted for nearly four years, from b.c 102 to B.C. 99. Two praetorian armies under L. Lucullus and P. Servilius Casca were succes sively defeated by the slaves, among whom Tryphon and after wards Athenion were proclaimed kings. In B.C. 101, the consul M'. Aquilius was sent to Sicily to quell the insurrection. He fought with great success, and continued his command during the following year also, but was unable to bring the war to a close until b.c 99, when Satyms, the last leader of the slaves, had fallen. Marius, who, on account of ks recent great victories, was called the third founder of Eome, now went beyond the bounds of both law and sacred customs. His irritable temperament was constantly provoked by the aristocracy, which is the only thing that can be said in his excuse. Even after the battle against the Cimbri, he of his own authority gave the Eoman franchise to 1000 of the inhabitants of Camerinum in Umbria, to reward them for then- bravery, declaring that in the din of war the laws could not be heard. On his return to Eome the popular party had gained considerable strength. In b.c 104 the tribune"], [435, "415 L. APPULEIUS SATURNINUS. L. Cassius Longinus had carried several laws with a view of curtailing the power of the senate ; and in the same year Cn. Domitius enacted that all vacancies in the priestly colleges should be filled up by the lesser half of the people, that is, by seventeen out of the thirty-five tribes, whereas before this time each prkstly college had itself filled up the vacancies that occurred in it. It is in general a peculiar sign of these times that whoever aspired to the great offices of the republic began his career by courting the favour of the multitude, and after he had gamed his object he joined the party of the optimates. Marius, in order to strengthen himself in his sixth consulship, formed connexions with two most turbulent and unprincipled demagogues, the tribune L. Appideius Saturninus and the praetor C. Servilius Glaucia. Saturninus belonged to a noble plebeian fantily, but was one of the worst knaves that Eome ever pro duced, and comparable only to such bemgs as Catiline and Eobespierre. For misconduct he had been deprived of the quaestura Ostiensis, an office connected with the providing of corn for the Eoman granaries. Notwithstanding the justice of his deposition, he afterwards contrived to gain the tribuneship, and in B.C. 101 he offered Mmself agak as a candidate for that office, in order to have an opportunity, with the assistance of his friend Marius, of takmg vengeance on the senate. A person of the name of A. Nomus was his competitor, but Saturninus so much incited the people against km, that the man was murdered in the forum by the populace in broad daylight. After having got the tribuneskp by violence, he entered upon an extensive system of legislation, beginnmg with an agrarian law, which he carried by main force, and wkch enacted that the lands recently conquered in Gaul and other countries should be divided among the people, and that each veteran of Marius should receive one thousand jugera m Africa. He further demanded that the senate should pledge itself by an oath to tks law, even before it had been passed by the assembly, and that any senator refusing to take the oath should be excluded from the senate and pay a fine"], [436, "416 HISTORY OF ROME. of twenty talents. Metellus Numidicus was the only senator who had courage enough to refuse, and he went into voluntary exile. A second law decreed the foundation of a certain number of colonies, in each of wkch Marius was to have the right of naming tkee mdividuals who were to have the Eoman franckse : a third had for its object to win the populace by the distribution of corn. These and several other legislative measures were brought for ward by Saturninus, and the year passed away amid the greatest atrocities. When the time for the elections drew near, he endea voured to obtam for kmself the tribuneship a third time, and for ks associate Servilius Glaucia the consulskp. C. Memmius, who came forward as a competitor of Glaucia, was murdered at the instigation of Saturninus. Tks and many other excesses of ks party at length mduced Marius to renounce ks connexion with Saturrrinus, and to resolve to protect the republic against then mad and furious proceedings. The consequence was that neither Saturmnus nor Glaucia was elected ; but the disturbances were so great that the senate called upon Marius to save the republic, which he honestly did. He forthwith called the citizens to arms, and Saturmnus and Ms associates were besieged on the Capitolke bill where they had taken refuge. The want of water after some time compelled them to surrender at discretion. Saturmnus, Glaucia, and all their accomplices, were put to death by the com mand of Marius. This act of justice reconciled the minds of all to Marius, who was further generous enough to allow Metellus to be recalled from exile. He then retired to the station of a private person, and went to Asia. The year b.c. 100 is further remark able as the one m wkch C. Julius Caesar was bom, on the 12th of July. After these disturbances there followed a period of recovery, though not of peace ; for the sources of the disease were not removed, as every one must have seen, though the great mass of the people lived on heedlessly and carelessly. The two ques tions which had now become of the utmost importance, and"], [437, "THE JUDICIA PUBLICA. 417 wkch could not be evaded, were those relating to the courts of justice, in wkch cases of a public character were tried \u2014 and to the franckse or emancipation of the Italian allies. With regard to the former, it has been aheady observed that the equites, who now formed those courts, were become as corrupt as the senators had been before. The pubricani, or farmers of the public revenues in the provmces, generally belonged to the class of the eqmtes, and they and then agents extorted from the pro- vincials the most exorbitant sums, which they did with the greater impumty, as all the actions brought against them for extortion were decided by their own colleagues at Eome, and, as a matter of course, always in then own favour. Moreover there had sprung up, among the equites, a jealousy and a bitter hatred of the senate and of the governors of provinces, some of whom, such as Q. Mucius Scaevola and P. Eutirius, were honest enough to protect the provincials against the avarice of the pubricani, who acted like privileged robbers. All attempts of the provin- cials to have justice done to them were of no avail. At length the eloquent and talented tribune, M. Livius Drusus, in B.C. 91 devised a plan of remedykg the evil by a law wkch ordained that 300 equites should be chosen into the senate, and that out of the body of 600, half of whom were senators and half equites, the judices or jury for each case should be taken. But this measure was as offensive to the senate as to the eqmtes ; for the former thought it degrading that they should thus be put on an equality with the equites \u2014 and the latter, in addition to being deprived of a privilege of wkch they had before possessed the exclusive enjoyment, had reason to fear an investigation into then scandalous proceedings. Drusus thus gained no thanks for ks trouble. He contemplated, and perhaps even carried, several other measures, in one of wkch he demanded the franchise for the Italians ; but before ks tribuneskp came to its close, he was assassinated in ks own house, and the senate repealed all ks laws. Every one at Eome saw the necessity of emancipating the Italians, and at times the Eomans were willing to make the con- t3"], [438, "418 HISTORY OF ROME. cession ; but as soon as private interests and feelings were consulted, they again skunk back. The refusal of the senate, and more especially the murder of Livius Drusus, was a signal for the Italians to demand by force of arms what they could not obtain in a constitutional way. Before proceeding to give an account of the war to wkch these circumstances gave rise, let us cast a glance at the foreign rela tions of Bome at this time. Notwithstanding her internal shocks and convulsions, the policy of Eome in reference to foreign countries continued to be the same as before : Eoman ambassa dors were watchful everywhere, especially in Asia, where they interfered in the disputes between nations and kings. Thus Sulla, who was sent, in B.C. 92, to receive an embassy of Arsaces, king of the Partkans (it was the first transaction in wkch Eome had been engaged with the Partkans), restored Ariobarzanes who had been expelled from his kingdom of Cappadocia, and (hove his opponent Gordks from the country. In B.C. 96, Ptolemaeus Apion, the last king of Cyrenaica in Africa, died, and, probably not without some insinuations of the Eomans themselves, be queathed ks flourishing kingdom to the senate and people of Eome. The senate, however, was liberal enough to allow the Cyrenaeans, at least for a time, the enjoyment of freedom and independence."], [439, "419 CHAPTEE XXVII. THE SOCIAL OR MARSIC WAR. The time wkch now broke m upon Italy brought greater sufferings upon the country than any of the previous wars, that of even Hannibal scarcely excepted. Eome herself had fully deserved the calamities with which she was visited, by refusing in proper time to grant what was fairly demanded and could not justly be withheld. In early times she had followed the system of gradually extending the franckse as a reward for neighbouring places wkch had rendered her good service, and m tks manner the thirty-five local tribes had been made up. But that system ceased about the end of the first Punic war : had it been followed up, matters would never have come to the point at wkch we now find them ; and Eome and Italy would have been spared a war in wkch the flower of their population perished. Many Italians formerly resided at Eome, and, though not legally, yet gradually and silently had been allowed to rive and act as Eoman citizens. All at once, m B.C. 95, just at the time when the Italians demanded to be emancipated, the consul L. Licimus Crassus, and the pontifex maximus, Q. Mucius Scaevola, carried a law ordering all those who had usurped the privileges of Eoman citizens to cease exercising them, and to conduct them selves as citizens of the commimities to which they respectively belonged \u2014 that is, as aliens resident at Eome.1 The feelings wkch this law excited may easily be imagmed. Tkee years later, Livius Drusus undertook the dangerous part of a mediator 1 Ascon. in Cornel, p. 67, ed. Orelli ; Cicero, Be Off. iii. 1 1, pro Balb. 21, 24."], [440, "420 HISTORY OF ROME. between Eome and the Italians : the enthusiasm of the latter for him was so great, that they swore an oath of allegiance to km, in wkch they pledged themselves to obey him uncondition ally, and promised to induce others to do the same.2 His greatest opponent was the consul, L. Marcius Phirippus, who, by con stantly irritating km, drove him to extremes. The assassination of Drusus, which we mentioned above, threw the Italians into a state of the greatest excitement : all then hopes were blighted, and there was no one left to whom they could look up with con fidence. The ill-will against them was very general at Eome, where they were looked upon as rebels ; but the better part of the population, mcluding the senate, saw the necessity of concession, and may be said to have taken up the views of Livius Drusus : the equites on the contrary, from their hatred of the senate, did not scruple to make common cause with the rabble, who thought it a disgrace that the Italians should be placed on an equahty with themselves ; and instead of trying to avert the storm, they tkew themselves right m its way. They made use of the tribune, Q,. Varius, who, m spite of the intercession of ks colleagues, carried a law by main force, (for the populace appeared in the forum in arms,) by wkch a commission was appointed to inquire who had had any commumcation with the airies touckng their emanci pation. This enactment occasioned a great many kw-smts ; and several distingmshed senators were condemned. But the Italians had, in the meantime, made their preparations, and were aheady in arms. This war, usually called the Social or Marsic war, broke out m B.C. 90, and lasted till b.c 88. The Italian nations, wkch had gradually formed themselves into a confederacy, determined either to gain the franchise, or to raze Eome to the ground and establish a republic embrackg the whole penmsula, were the Picem, Vestinians, Marrucinians, Marsians, Perignians, Samnites, Frentamans, Hirpimans, Lucanians, and Apurians. The Latins, the Lathi colonies tkoughout Italy, the Etruscans, Umbrians, and Campamans, fortunately for Eome, did 2 Diodor. Excerpt. Vat, p. 128, ed. Dindorf."], [441, "THE SOCIAL WAR. 421 not join the confederacy, and remained qmet. The deputies of the revolted nations held a meeting at Asculum, wkther the praetor Servilius Caepio and his legate Fonteius went to remon strate with them, and to persuade them to disperse and keep the peace ; but both the praetor and his legate were murdered in the theatre at Asculum; and the exasperation of the people rose to such a pitch, that ail the Eomans who happened to be in the place were put to death. The insurrection spread more and more, though it was not everywhere accompanied by the same atrocities as at Asculum. The confederates declared that all Italy should form one republic, with Corfimum for its capital under the name of Itarica, and that Eome should be destroyed. The new republic was to have a senate of 500 members, two annual consuls, and twelve praetors. The kst consuls were Silo Popaedius, a Marsian, one of the principal instigators of the war, and C. Papius MutUus, a Samnite, who, like all ks countrymen, cherished a most implacable hatred of the Eomans. The commanders on both sides were equally great ; so also were the exertions wkch they made, and the passions by which they were animated. The Eoman consuls of the year b.c 90, L. Julius Caesar and P. Eutirius Lupus, who took the field against the Italians, were unfortunate, and the advantage was decidedly on the part of the allies. Eutirius Lupus fell in a battle against the Marsians, but the legates Sulla and Marius were more successful, and the latter put the Marsians to flight. The only tkng wkch saved Bome was in fact the Latin colonies remaimng faithful to her ; and in order to secure the continuance of then attachment, the Eomans granted the franckse to all the Latks by the celebrated Julian law, wkch was proposed and carried by the consul, L. Julius Caesar. Tks law applied to all Latium and to all the .Latin colomes both within and without Italy ; but it had no reference, as some have supposed, to any of the other Italian allies. Tks prudent concession greatly increased the Eoman armies, wkch in point of number seem now to have surpassed the forces of the allies. These colonies, scattered as they were"], [442, "422 HISTORY OF ROME. all over Italy and forming strong garrisons, tore the enemy's territories asunder, and obliged the Italians to leave troops beknd them in all parts, whereby their strength was broken. In order to comprehend the operations of tks war, it is neces sary to divide Italy into three great sections, each of wkch was the scene of a distinct war. The first, or southern part, extended as far as the river Liris in Campania ; the second or middle portion extended from the river Liris to the frontiers of Picenum; and the northern consisted of Picenum itself. The consul Cn. Pompeius Strabo, B.C. 89, was the first Eoman who gained any decisive advantages : he defeated the Marsians and Vestinians, and met an army of the confederates, 70,000 in number, in a great battle at Asculum, where he completely overcame them. The town was taken by the sword and destroyed, and the fate of its inhabitants was dreadful. Pompeius Strabo then advanced south ward, and some of the allies submitted to km. The Eoman army in the south was commanded by L. Julius Caesar and was opposed to that of C. Papius Mutilus, who, after the conquest of several towns, transferred the war into Campama, where it became con centrated about Acerrae. But there the Eomans gained no great vantages. The army in middle Italy, under the command of Marius and Sulla, who subdued some tribes and took Stabiae, was opposed by that of Popaedius Silo, who fell in the battle of Teanum, in the third year of the war, B.C. 88. The Italians appear to have been but loosely united among each other, and one nation after another concluded a separate peace for itself with Eome, either because they could not agree among them selves, or because they were jealous of one another. Thus the Vestinians and Pelignians submitted to Pompeius, and the Mar sians also sued for peace, so that in the end only the Samnites and some Lucanians remained in arms. The Umbrians and Etruscans, who had began to stir, were easily pacified, and forthwith received the Eoman franckse. The Samnites, how ever, continued the war with the same vigour and perseverance as in former times, and refused to listen to any proposal of"], [443, "THE FRANCHISE OF THE ITALIANS. 423 peace : they remained in arms, and afterwards, in the civil war between Sulla and Marius, they joked the latter. The danger ous enmity between these two powerful rivals, and the hostile proceedings of Mitkidates in the east, made the Eomans anxious to bring the war to a close ; they accordingly promised the franckse to all those who laid down their arms. The war was thus concluded. The accounts of it wkch have come down to us are very meagre and unsatisfactory ; but we may judge of its character from the result, for Velleius Paterculus tells us that in it Italy lost no less than 300,000 of her sons, and many once flourishing towns were changed mto heaps of ruins. In the second year of the war, B.C. 89, M. Plautius Silvanus and C. Papirius Carbo had carried a law grantmg the franckse to the citizens of all confederate towns in Italy, who being at the time domiciled in Italy shoidd send in their names to the praetor within sixty days ; and m the same year Pompeius Strabo carried another law, which conferred the Latin franckse upon all the inhabitants of the coimtry between the Alps and the Po. The Transpadani thus stept into the relation in wkch ktherto the Latins had been held, and persons who were mvested -with a magistracy m any of their towns thereby acquired the privileges of Eoman citizens. The great question now was, in what manner the new citizens should be incorporated with the Eoman state ? Were they to be distributed among the tkrty-five existing tribes ? or were they to be formed into new and separate tribes ? The former plan was proposed, but rejected, because it woidd have been unfair towards the old tribes, whose members would have been surpassed in numbers by the new citizens, and who would accordingly have been outvoted by them on every occasion. The new citizens, therefore, were formed into new tribes, the number of wkch is uncertain ; some say ten, and others eight, and some kstorians conjecture that their number was fifteen ; so that the total number of tribes now would have amounted to fifty. The new tribes were not allowed to vote in the assembly till the thirty-five old ones had given their votes, so that in reality the influence of the new citizens was not very great."], [444, "424 CHAPTEE XXVIII. THE FIRST WAR AGAINST MITHRIDATES. \u2014 CIVIL WAR BETWEEN MARIUS AND SULLA. \u2014 SULLA'S DICTATORSHIP, LEGISLATION, AND ABDICATION. \u2014 SECOND WAR AGAINST MITHRIDATES. Mithridates VI., surnamed Eupator, whose father had ren- dered the Eomans considerable assistance in their war against the pretender Aristonicus, was now kkg of Pontus, in the north- east of Asia Minor. He was a man of great mind, and one of the ablest generals of antiquity. When he was yet very young the Eomans deprived him of Pkygia, wkch, it was said, they had given to ks father as a reward for his services, but wkch in reality he had purchased at Eome with ks own money. The young kng at the time made \u25a0 no remonstrance, but quietly strengthened kmself, and extended ks kmgdom as far as he could without coming into contact with the Eomans. The latter did not interfere with his proceedings, because they were engaged in Italy with then own allies ; but they, nevertheless, kept a sharp eye upon all ks domgs. About the end of the Social war, the last member of the royal family of Cappadocia died, and Mithridates gave the kingdom to Ariarathes, one of his own kinsmen -. hereupon the Eomans stirred up Nicomedes, kng of Bithynia, to attack Mithridates ; but Nicomedes was defeated, and Mithridates placed the brother of the defeated kng on the tkone of Bithynia. The Eomans now openly interfered, and spoke to Mitkidates m a tone as if he had committed an unjustifiable offence. They forthwith raised tkee armies in Asia Minor, which were formed of the effeminate and unwarlike inhabi tants of that country. They were unable to cope with the well- disciplined troops of the kmg, and were defeated. Mithridates"], [445, "FIRST MITHRIDATIC WAR. 425 now advanced westward, meeting with scarcely any resistance; for the kng being one who had kmself received a Greek educa tion was everywhere welcomed by the Greeks as then deliverer from the oppressive yoke of the Eomans. On one day no less than 80,000 Eomans and Italians, who were riving in the various towns of Asia Minor, are said to have been put to death by the command of Mitkidates ; immediately after wkch his general Archelaus, in b.c 8p, led a large army mto Macedoka and Greece, where most of the important towns, and among them Thebes and Athens, tkew then gates open to him with the same readiness that the Asiatic Greeks had received Mitkidates himself. The massacre of the Eomans called for vengeance ; and as by the invasion of Greece Italy itself was threatened, the senate determined to give the command in the impending war to L. Cornelius Sulla, who had greatly distinguished himself in the Social war by his prudence as well as ks courage, and who had gamed the favour of the people by splendid games and donations. C. Marius, the deliverer of Italy, and once the idol of the people, was now a man of seventy, and seemed to be forgotten. But ks ambition, ks hatred of the aristocratic party, and ks jealousy of Sulla were as strong as ever ; and being anxious himself to gain laurels in so great a war as that against Mitkidates, he re solved to try whether he could not deprive Sulla of the command wkch had been intrusted to km. With tks view he entered into a connection with the bold and cunmng tribune, P. Sulpicius, who surrounded by a body of 3000 gladiators, whom he used to call ks anti-senate, carried a law by wkch the new citizens and the libertiiii were distributed among the thirty-five old tribes.1 By the overwhelming influence wkch they thus obtamed in the comitia, and by violence, another law was passed, appointing C. Marius commander in the war agamst Mithridates.2 Tks was an act of glaring injustice, wkch naturally exasperated Sulla in 1 Liv. Epit. 77 ; Appian, Be Bell. \u00b0 Livy and Appian, I. c. ; Veil.

While these things happened at Eome, Sulla was stationed with an army at Nola, in Campama, against the Samnites, who were still holding out, and with whom he was anxious to bring the war to a close previous to ks setting out for Greece. When he was apprised of the proceedings of Marius and Sulpicius, he at once inarched with six of ks legions against Eome, where no one was prepared to meet him, for nobody had expected that he would act m so resolute a manner. When he appeared, the gates were immediately closed against him ; but both the gates and the walls had been allowed to decay, as the possibility of an enemy appearing before them had not been thought of since the days of Hankbal, and accordingly Sulla, without much difficulty, entered the city with two legions. He and ks soldiers were received with showers of stones and other missiles, which were tkown down upon them from the roofs of the houses. But he succeeded in putting ks enemies to flight, and marching down to the forum made a very generous use of ks victory ; for after the Marian party was driven out of the city, oky Marius and his son, with P. Sulpicius and nine other ring leaders of then party, were outlawed, the rest of the people bemg spared. Marius fled kst to Ostia, and thence along the sea-coast to Mmturnae, where he was found concealed k the marshes, and then tkown into prison. No one, however, had the courage to put km to death, and the magistrates of Minturnae, therefore, sent a public slave into the prison to kill him; but as the bar barian approached the hoary warrior ks courage failed km, and the Minturnians, moved by compassion, put Marius on board a boat and transported km to Africa, where for a time he remained quiet, anxiously watching the course of events at Bome. Sulla was so far from takng any further vengeance during the short time he spent at Eome, that he even allowed L. Cornelius China, a partisan of Marius, to be elected to the consulskp for the year B.C. 87, along with his own friend, Cn. Octavius. It may be that Sulla was deceived in the character and sentiments of China, but it is also possible that he permitted his appoint-"], [447, "SULLA IN GREECE. 427 ment with the view of sowing the seeds of new discord, of wkch he hoped to receive the benefit after his return from the Mithridatic war. In B.C. 87, soon after the new consids had entered upon their office, Sulla, as proconsk, went with his army to Greece ; while Q. Pompeius Eufus, who had been Sulla's colleague in the consulship, received Italy as Iris province, with orders to conduct the war against the Sammtes, to counteract China, and co-operate with Cn. Octavius. Cn. Pompeius, the father of Pompey the Great, who was at tks time commanding an army in Apulia against the Samnites, now received orders from the senate to give up ks army to Q. Pompeius Eufus ; but instead of doing tks, he secretly incited his troops against him, so that while Q. Pompeius was admikstering the military oath to the soldiers he was mur dered by them. Cn. Pompeius, as if he had been mnocent, assumed the appearance of investigating the matter, but of course soon forgot all about it, and retained the command against the Sammtes, who through the absence of Sulla gained some breathing-time. On Sulla's arrival in Greece, Boeotia submitted to km as easily as it had before submitted to the Bontian general : he then entered Attica, sending a part of ks army to lay siege to the city of Athens, while he with the main body of ks troops began to blockade Piraeus, witkn the walls of which Archelaus retreated on the approach of Sulla. The besieged defended themselves with great skill and resolution, and the Eomans could make no impression upon them; but in the spring of the year B.C. 86, Sulla used all means which he had at ks command. Athens was blockaded and all provisions cut off, so that the famine in the city reached a fearful height. Athens was at length taken by assault ; and soon after tks Archelaus, despairing of success, escaped from Piraeus, leaving the place to its own fate. The famished Athenians were pardoned for their ancestors' sake, for Sulla was a great admirer of Greek art and literature ; but then city was plundered, and many of the most precious treasures were sent to Eome : among them was the library of Apeffico, which"], [448, "428 HISTORY OF ROME. is said to have contained the only complete copy of Aristotle's works. After the greater part of Pnaeus had been destroyed by fire, Sulla set out in purskt of Archelaus, who had in the mean time collected the scattered forces of Mitkidates in the north of Greece. In the neighbourhood of Chaeronea, in Boeotia, Archelaus was completely defeated m B.C. 85 : he then fled to Chalcis in Euboea, wkther Sulla, who had no fleet, was unable to follow him. When Mithridates was informed of ks reverses in Greece, he sent strong reinforcements, and Archelaus thus strengthened returned to Boeotia to wipe off the disgrace of ks former defeat. In the neighbourhood of Orchomenos the hostile armies again met, and a second battle was fought, in wkch Sulla's undaunted personal courage alone decided the victory. To prevent the enemy again escaping to Chalcis, Sulla attempted to cut off ks retreat, but Archelaus nevertheless succeeded in crossmg the Euripus. Mitkidates, who had himself to sustain hard struggles with the Eomans in Asia, began to lose confidence, and ordered Archelaus to negotiate for peace and to conclude it on any terms he could. Sulla accepted the proposals the more willingly, as durkg ks absence tkngs had taken place at Eome which rendered it most desirable for km to bring the war to a close. The negotiations, however, were protracted for a long time, during wkch Sulla undertook a successful expedition against some barbarians in Tkace who had infested the Eoman province of Macedonia ; and peace was not finally concluded and signed by Mithridates till b.c 84, when Sulla had an kterview with the kng at Dardanus in Troas. Mithridates surrendered ks whole fleet, restored all the Eoman prisoners and deserters, withdrew his garrisons from all places in Greece, paid all the expenses of the war, and was confined to his own kngdom of Pontus. Thus Mitkidates, after having made most enormous exertions, was reduced to the posi tion wkch he had occupied before the outbreak of the war. Owing to the internal disturbances at Eome, or more probably to the dishonesty of the senate, the peace with Sulla was never formally sanctioned."], [449, "CINNA AND MARIUS. 429 In B.C. 87, immediately after entering upon ks consulship, Cinna had come forward as the head of the Marian party at Eome, and carried a law that the persons outlawed by Sulla should be recalled. In order to win the favour of the new citizens, he promised them to can-y into effect the law of Sulpicius, accord ing to which they and the ribertim were to be distributed among the 35 old tribes. Great numbers of the new citizens accordingly flocked to Bome to support ks measures ; but ks colleague Cn. Octavius came forward against km, and a fierce struggle arose witkn the city, in wkch Cmna was defeated and driven out of its walls. The senate then issued a proclamation that Cinna had forfeited ks consular digmty. A Boman army was at the time still stationed m the neighbourhood of Nola to check the Samnites, and tkther Cinna now repaired. The soldiers who had oky the year before been led by Sulla against Bome, and were then made aware that the fate of the republic rested k reality k then hands, took up ks cause, and requested km to take the consular ensigns and lead them to Eome. Marius and his fellow-exiles, who were recalled, landed in the meantime in Etruria, and began to collect an army, in wkch every one was enlisted that was ready to fight for Marius, freemen as well as citizens ; even slaves were promised then freedom if they wokd jok ks standard. The aged captain, after ks return from exile, had the sympathy of the greater part of the people on ks side, and numbers took up arms for him. Foremost among them were Paphius Carbo, who joined the army of China, and Q. Ser torius, who commanded an army by kmself. Sertorius was the best and noblest of all the men engaged in tks struggle : he joined the Marian party oky on account of ks abhorrence of the ruling faction, for he had no share in the tyrannical senti ments of ks party. The city was defended by Cn. Octavius and Cn. Pompeius, who had been called away from Apulia, but as they were attacked by tkee armies at once there was little hope of then success. Cn.

Many of the Latin towns were taken and destroyed by the army under Cinna, and Eome being surrounded on all sides began to suffer from famine. The senate at last was obliged to nego- . tiate, and to submit to all the terms that Marks prescribed. Cinna was accordkgly re-kstated in ks conskar dignity, and the gates were tkown open on the understandkg that no blood shokd be shed; but no sooner had the rebels entered the city than famished and unhappy Eome became the scene of the most frightful out rages, of plunder, murder, and violence of every kind. All were cut down whom Marius marked as his victims, and no mercy was shown. All of the Sullakan party who were unable to escape were put to death, or made away with themselves in order not to fall into the hands of their enemies, and many also fell by the hands of the kfuriated multitude and slaves, who mas sacred indiscriminately. Among the illustrious victims in whose blood Marius quenched ks tlrirst for five days, we may mention the consk Cn. Octavius, the orator M. Antonius, C. Julius Caesar, and Q. Lutatius Catulus, one of the most estimable men of ks age : the flamen Diaris, L. Cornelius Merka, who had been made consk in China's place, bled himself to death in the vestibule of the Capitoline temple. The butchery was carried to so enor mous an extent by a band of liberated slaves whom Marius kept for the purpose of despatching ks enemies, that even Cinna cokd bear it no longer, and on the advice of Sertorius ordered all of them to be put to death. After these scenes of terror, Marius caused kmself to be made consk for the seventh, and Cinna for the second time. Marius always believed that he was destmed by fate to be mvested with the conskskp seven times, for when yet a child, an eagle's nest with seven young ones had fallen from a tree mto ks lap, and some soothsayer had told him that the seven young eagles were 3 Some state that he was killed by a flash of lightning."], [451, "SULLA'S RETURN TO ITALY. 431 a sign that he wokd be consk seven times. But a few days after he had entered on his seventh consulskp he died, on the 13th of January, B.C. 86. He was succeeded by L. Valerius Flaccus, who was forthwith commissioned to undertake the com mand of the war against Mitkidates. The war agakst the Sam mtes had been concluded the year before by Q. Metellus, for at the time when Cinna was marckng towards Bome, the senate ordered Metellus to conclude peace with them on whatever terms he cokd. Peace therefore was restored on condition that the Samnites shokd receive the Boman franckse. AU Italy now was in the hands of Cinna. L. Valerius Flaccus, after Iris elevation to the conskskp, proceeded to Asia to take the command against Mithridates out of the hands of Sulla; but as he was unpopkar among his own soldiers, on account of his cruelty and avarice, many of ks men deserted to Sulla, and he himself was murdered at Nicomedia by his own legate C. Flavius Fimbria, who now placed kmself at the head of his army and traversed Asia. Fimbria defeated several of the generals of Mithridates, and among them the kng's own son, and then took possession of Pergamus. Ilium, wkch had declared in favour of Sulla, was next taken and destroyed, and he maintained himself m its neighbourhood until the arrivk of Sulla in Asia, who concluded peace with the -king of Pontus, in B.C. 84. When his own affairs were settled with Mithridates, Sulla set out agakst Fimbria, who was encamped near Thyatira. He sur rounded ks enemy's camp, and gamed over ks whole army, where upon Fimbria in despair put an end to ks own existence. When the field was thus cleared of enemies, Sulla set about regkatkg the affairs of Asia. The cities in which the Eomans had been mur dered by the command of Mitkidates, he pumshed most severely: they were compelled to pay down at once 20,000 talents, the raiskg of wkch tkew them completely into the mercriess hands of the insatiable Eoman capitalists and usurers, who sucked the very blood out of the country, in wkch proceedkgs they were assisted by the Eoman soldiers. Asia was so much crushed by"], [452, "432 HISTORY OF ROME. tks blow, that nearly a whole century elapsed before it reco vered from it. But Sulla wanted money, and was little concerned about the means of getting it. It must however be owned that during ks war in Greece and Asia he had shown a greatness of character of wkch few men were capable in those times, for he qketly discharged ks duties towards the republic before he thought of taking vengeance on ks personal enemies, who in ks absence destroyed ks house, killed ks friends, and drove ks family into exile. His duties towards the republic now being discharged, he prepared for ks return to Italy. His army con sisted of no more than 30,000 men, while that of ks enemies amounted to almost seven tkies that number, and contaked soldiers of such excellence as the Sammtes. But Sulla had con fidence m kmself and ks good fortune, and with that he ventured upon ks bold undertakmg. At the begkkng of the year B.C. 83, he returned tkough Thessaly and Macedonia to Dyrrhackum, and thence to Brun dusiuni and Campaka. The consks of tks year were L. Cor nelius Scipio and C. Julius Norbanus. Cinna, who was k vested the year before with ks fourth conskskp, had been murdered by ks own soldiers at Arirknum, where he was as sembling an army for the purpose of attacking Sulla in Greece ; and Carbo, his colleague, remained sole consul during the remakder of the year. The leaders of the Marian party now were Carbo, Norbanus, and C. Marius the younger, who had all the vices of ks father without any of ks redeerkng virtues. Had these men known how to act, Sulla cokd not possibly have suc ceeded ; but they were not fit to be the leaders of a great party. Sertorius, the oky man of great ability, soon after went to Spam, to commence a fresh war there under ks own auspices and con ducted it on ks own responsibility. The new citizens had by tks time become disgusted with the conduct of then rkers, who with the titles of republican magistrates acted like tyrants and despots. These circumstances facilitated the progress of Sulla ; all the regiments composed of new citizens, whom he promised not to"], [453, "433 SULLA AT ROME. deprive of their newly acquired privileges, went over to him. He found Norbanus encamped in the neighbourhood of Capua, and defeated km. He then turned against Scipio, whose whole army deserted to him, and Scipio himself at last also declared in his favour. While Sulla was thus gaikng a firm footing m southern Italy, many of ks supporters took up arms k other parts of the country, among whom were Metellus Pius, Cn. Pompey in Pice num, and M. Lucullus ; and ks party was victorious everywhere. At Bome the Capitorine temple, tkough the carelessness of the keepers, became a prey to the flames. In B.C. 82, the second year of the war, C. Marius the younger was consk with Papirius Carbo, who had the command in the north of Italy against Metellus, Pompey, and Lucullus, while Marius was stationed with ks army on the frontier of Latium. In the vickity of Sacriportus, Marius was attacked by Sulla and beaten, and many of ks troops deserted to the conqueror, while Marius kmself escaped to Praeneste, a large and strongly forti fied town. Sulla followed km and blockaded the place, but soon left the management of the siege to Lucretius Ofeila, and went to take possession of Eome, wkch was yet k the hands of the Marian party. Under the gkdance of the praetor, L. Jukus Damasippus, the democrats at Eome had kstituted a cruel mas sacre among those who were favourable to Sulla, or were believed to be so ; and at the time of the battle of Sacriportus, Damasippus killed k the Curia Hostilia the great jurist and ckef pontiff Mucks Scaevola, with C. Carbo, the brother of the consk, and many other distingkshed senators. The perpetrators of these hor rors now fled, and Sulla entered the city. The consk Carbo, who had an army k Etruria, m vak endeavoured to relieve Praeneste: another attempt was made by the Samkte general Pontius Tele sinus, but as he was unable to effect anythkg, he turned towards Eome, wkch he hoped to take by surprise. Sulla was k formed k time of ks movements, and a battle was fought on the 1st of November at the very walls of Eome, near the Coffine gate. The Sammtes fought with the courage of despair, but v"], [454, "434 HISTORY OF ROME. after a whole day's struggle they were defeated so completely that Pontius Telesinus made away with himself. In him Marius lost ks last hope : he attempted to escape from Praeneste by a subterraneous passage, but being discovered he kiled kmself; and Carbo, being left alone, abandoned ks army and fled to Sicily. Sulla now saw Italy cleared of all ks enemies, and only a few towns continued to offer him any resistance. The manner k which Sulla made use of ks victory filled Eome and Italy with horrors more appalling than any they had yet witnessed. In the battle of the Coffine gate 8000 Sanmites had been taken prisoners, all of whom were massacred by ks command in the circus. After the death of Marius, Praeneste was obliged to surrender at discretion to Lucretius Ofella, and all persons who were found in the place, with the exception of the Eoman citizens, were put to the sword. The Etruscan towns wkch had supported Carbo surrendered one after another, and most of them were razed to the ground. But the bloodshed at Eome, where Sulla acted as a perfect tyrant, was still more ftightftd. He devised a new and unprecedented means of gettkg rid of ks enemies : he set on foot a proscription ; that is, he drew up a list of all those whom he wished to be put to death, and set it up in public. Any one had a right to kill those whose names were in the List, not oky with impukty, but rewards were offered for their heads. Then estates were confiscated and sold; and in order to secure kmself agakst their sons, Sulla got a law passed by wkch the descendants of the proscribed were for ever to be excluded from all the offices of the republic. Tks cruel law remained in force down to the time of C. Julius Caesar. It is said that no less than 1600 equites were among the proscribed who lost their rives. A spirit of revenge and avarice drove the inhuman victors from one crime to another, till Q. Catkus found it necessary to ask Sulla whether he meant to spare any human being at all, and to rerknd him, that if he went on m the same way, there wokd be k the end no one left to rale over. Catiline was one of the monsters who m those days obtamed notoriety"], [455, "SULLA DICTATOR. 435 for murder and assassination, and thus acquired a taste for the crimes wkch he afterwards committed when he planned the de struction of ks own country. Eome had not seen a dictator for the last 120 years, but the interrex L. Vkerius Flaccus now carried a decree by which all the past acts of Sulla were sanctioned, and Sulla himself was appointed dictator with unlimited power for an indefinite period, that he might reform the constitution and the law. Invested with such powers he began, in B.C. 81, his course of legislation, having previously made some alterations of minor importance. First of all he was anxious to show ks gratitude to those to whom he owed the position he now occupied. Twenty-three legions accordingly had colomes assigned to them in Italy ; that is, these legions were dismissed from service, and each legion was constituted as the body of citizens of a certain town, the whole territory of wkch was given up to and parcelled out among the legionaries ; if the territory was not found sufficient, por tions of the adjacent districts were taken and added to it. The places thus made over to the soldiers as a reward for past services were called military colomes : they consisted for the greater part of the estates of the proscribed of those towns wkch had sup ported the opponents of Sulla, and of such districts as in former times wokd have become public domain. It was by means of these military colomes that Sulla placed ks power on a solid foundation, to wkch he cokd trust under all circumstances. He next cokerred the Eoman franckse on a body of 10,000 eman cipated slaves, who received from km the name of the Cornerii, and were distributed among the 35 old tribes. The vacancies wkch had occurred in the senate were, notwithstanding his high aristocratic principles, filled up not with members of the nobility, but with eqmtes, and even with vkgar centurions ; but all were ready tools k the hands of the dictator. His legislation must be divided into two branches, according as it had reference either to the constitution of the republic, or to the criminal law. In respect of the former, Sulk, like many u2"], [456, "436 HISTORY OF ROME. other men both in ancient and modern times, had the weakness to believe that by restorkg old and antiquated forms of the con stitution he cokd kso revive its spirit. In tks belief he began by curtailing the power of the tribunes : he deprived them of the right of proposing legislative measures in the assemblies, and of holding any other magistracy after the expiration of then office. The judicial and legislative power of the comitia tributa was thus likewise abolished, and they retamed notkng but the election of the nrinor magistrates. In short, the tribukcian power was reduced to what it had been previous to the Publilian law ; that is, the tribunes became a mere protective magistracy, and the work of ages was undone. There can be no doubt that the tribunes k the course of time had acquired and usurped a power wkch was detrimental to the safety of the republic, and it was most desirable that they shokd be confined witkn certam limits ; but Sulla's reform was framed in an improper spirit, and ran counter to all the feerings of the age. The con sequence was, that ks regkation did not last : it was repealed in b.c 70, by Cn. Pompey. A second great change, ktroduced by Sulla, was, the restoring power to the senators to appokt from among their own body the courts in wkch cases of a public nature were tried. Tks restoration of a much coveted right ought to have induced the senators to show that k then hands justice fared better than in those of any other body of men ; but we have express testimony, that, during the nke or ten years k wkch they formed those courts, justice was more venal, and bribery was carried on to a far greater extent, than it had ever been before. The senators in fact acted as if it had been then deliberate mtention to undermine then own power, till k B.C. 70, L. Aurelius Cotta divided the courts equally between the sena tors and eqktes. Sulla further kcreased the number of praetors to eight, that of the quaestors to twenty, and that of the two colleges of the augurs and pontiffs to fifteen each, restoring to these colleges at the same time the right of filling up vacancies by cooptatio ; that is, he gave to each college the right of filling"], [457, "437 SULLA'S REFORMS. up any vacancy that might occur. These, and some measures regkatkg the administration of the provinces, were the ckef reforms by wkch he endeavoured to restore the good old times of Eome ; but ks labours were foolish and useless. The oligarchy wkch he established was raised on the corpses of the democratical party, and was made for an entirely new class of citizens whom he himself had created, after having extirpated the old ones by murder and proscription. The new constitution was not rooted in the kstitutions of the country ; it was not their natural and spontaneous offsprkg ; obsolete forms had been artificially re vived ; it was a mere phantom without a sok. But whatever we may thkk of ks constitutional reforms, ks civil and crirknk legislation was excellent. He must have pos sessed a deep insight into human affairs, or have had most able advisers ; for the crimkal law, wkch had ktherto been greatly neglected, received at ks hand a solid foundation, upon wkch all subsequent enactments in tks department were based. The Comelii, ks emancipated slaves, formed his body-guard, and freedmen in general were ks favourites and the most influ ential persons in ks retinue ; so that it was a courageous act of Cicero, who was then only twenty-seven years old, to defend Boscius of Ameria, and attack Ckysogonus one of Sulla's creatures, for persons like Ckysogonus might rob and murder with impukty, and no one cokd be safe agakst them. Such was the case in Eome as well as in other parts of Italy. After having made all the arrangements he thought necessary, Sulla, in B.C. 79, to the surprise of every one, laid down ks dictatorskp, and retired into the condition of a private person at Buteori, pro bably for the purpose of spending the remakder of ks blood staked life m peace and luxury. Tks step was not by any means a bold one, for in case of any emergency he had the senate, and, above all, ks military colonies to fall back upon, and ks opponents were crushed kto the dust. Before retiring, he offered to render an account of ks proceedings ; but tks was a mere farce, for who wokd have dared to demand it ? and how could"], [458, "438 HISTORY OF ROME. he have answered for the murder of the 8000 Samkte captives, of 46 conskars, praetorians, and aediles, of 200 senators, of 1600 eqktes, and of 150,000 citizens, and for ks having driven numbers of industrious and peaceable country-people into poverty and wretchedness merely to acquire the means of satisfykg ks reckess and greedy veterans? He did not long survive his retirement, for he died at Puteoli, in B.C. 78, at the age of sixty, of a disgusting disease called phthiriasis, probably the result of ks debaucheries. He had latterly been engaged in writing the memoirs of ks own life in Greek, and had just fikshed the twenty-second book when ks career was cut off. His body was conveyed to Bome m a solemn procession, and the whole senate, the eqktes, and all the colleges of priests, accompaked it to the Campus Martius, where it was burnt. These honours were not paid to him from any feeling of esteem or affection on the part of the people, but because they dreaded the armed soldiers who under the command of Pompey accompaked the body. Italy had been plunged mto the deepest misery, but after the dispersion of the democratic leaders it was not the scene of any fresh war ; and during the few years of Sulla's dictatorskp it recovered a little from the severe blows wkch had been k flicted on it. The remnants of the Marian party fled to Sicily, Africa, and Spam, where new armies were collected and the war was still continued. In B.C. 82, Cn. Pompey was sent to Sicriy, where tkough hired assassins he got Carbo murdered, and thus peace was restored in the island. In the year following he went over to Africa, where he defeated and slew the proscribed Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, and king Hiarbas who supported Ahenobarbus. Although Pompey at the time was oky an eques, and no more than twenty-four years old, stk on ks return to Eome he was honoured with a triumph, and Sulla further re warded his services by the surname of the Great. The war with Sertorius in Spain was of far greater importance ; but we shall reserve our account of it till a somewhat later period. In Asia a second war with Mithridates had broken out. Soon"], [459, "SECOND MITHRIDATIC WAR. 439 after the departure of Sulla, Mithridates began to feel that he had yielded too readily, and had made greater concessions than he ought to have done. As, moreover, the Eoman senate had never signed the peace concluded between him and Sulla, and as he had never been able to obtak its formk sanction, he refused to give up to Ariobarzanes the whole of Cappadocia as he had promised to do, keepkg a part of it for himself. His generk, Archelaus, who perceived the change in ks master's rknd, de serted k b.c 83 to the Eomans, and prevailed upon L. Murena, who had the command of the Boman forces in Asia, at once to attack the kkg, and not to wait till he shokd commence hostili ties. Murena accordingly marched into Cappadocia, and plundered the wealthy temple of Comana. Tks aggression led to an open war, and a battle was sought in the vickity of Sinope in wkch Murena was defeated. As Mitkidates showed kmself willing to renew the peace with the Eomans, they readily consented, and Mithridates remained in the possession of a part of Cappadocia : he kso engaged himself to a daughter of Ariobarzanes. The peace with Bome was concluded and ratified, in B.C. 81, by A. Gabkius, whom Sulla had sent over to Asia for the purpose."], [460, "440 CHAPTEE XXIX. THE ATTEMPT OF AEMILIUS LEPIDUS TO RESCIND THE ACTS OF SULLA. \u2014 CN. POMPEV THE GREAT. WAR OF SERTORIUS IN SPAIN. SPARTACUS. POMPEY'S CONSULSHIP. THE PIRATES. Sulla, by ks tyranmcal power, had smothered the fire wkch tkeatened the republic with destruction; but it was not ex tingkshed, and fuel for a new conflagration was not wantkg. The new order of tkngs wkch he had created cokd not long survive its author, for all social relations at Eome and in Italy had been upset, and the old agricktural popkation of those places in wkch military colomes were established, had been either ejected or reduced to beggary : in many kstances they had become the tenants of then new lords, who, k then reckessness and licentiousness, soon squandered then property, and were ready agak to lend their arms to any one who might choose to pay them. It wokd have been very easy to form an army of reduced husbandmen and military desperadoes, who wokd have been readily joined by the hungry popkace of Eome, and the great number of exried citizens who were oky wktkg for some one to place himself at then head ; hut the person who attempted the counter-revolution had neither the tkent nor the character for such an undertakng. In the year of Sulla's death, B.C. 78, the conskskp was m the hands of M. Aemffius Lepidus, and Q. Lutatius Catkus, two men of very opposite characters and kcrinations. The former, though he had once belonged to the party of Sulla, and had emiched himself by it, was now become an implacable enemy of that party, and resolved to undo the work of Sulla : Lutatius Catkus, on the other hand, was a staunch and faitkk supporter"], [461, "441 M. AEMILIUS LEPIDUS. of the edifice raised by Sulla. Lepidus made preparations to get the acts of Sulla resckded, the exiles recalled, and their con fiscated estates restored to them ; but in order to prevent any outbreak of hostilities between the two consks, the senate made them promise on then oath not to take up arms against each other. For a time tks precaution had the desired effect ; but when Lepidus had gone into his province of Cisalpke Gaul, he thought himself no longer bound by ks oath, and collected an army, wkch was joked by large numbers of Etruscans whose homes had been destroyed by Sulla, or who had been driven from then estates by the veterans of the dictator. Lepidus led ks troops to the very gates of Eome ; but was repksed by Catulus : he then fled to Sardika, where he died the follow ing year, B.C. 77. M. Junius Brutus attempted to support Lepidus in Gak, but was defeated by Pompey and put to death ; and the troops of Lepidus, who maintained themselves for a time under Perpema, afterwards went with him to Spain, and joined the army of Sertorks. In the meantime Eome itself was tkown into a state of the greatest excitement, for the attempt of Lepidus had stirred up the tribunes, who for a number of years set all their engines at work to recover the power wkch the reforms of Sulla had taken from them. In B.C. 76, the tribune Cn. Sicinks brought forward a rogation, demanding the restoration of the tribunician power ; and the year following the consk C. Aurerius Cotta carried a law, by wkch the tribunes were allowed, after the expiration of their office, to be kvested with other magistracies. In B.c. 74, another attempt was made to repek all the laws of Skla; and in tks manner tkngs went on until Cn. Pompey in his conskship, B.C. 70, carried a law by which the power of the tribunes was restored exactly to what it had been before the dictatorskp of Sulla.1 In the same year the praetor L. Aurerius Cotta, supported by Pompey, abolished Sulla's law respecting the 1 Liv. Epit. 97; Veil. Pat. ii. 30; Pseudo-Aseon. in Civ. Biv. pp. 103, 147 ; Plut. Pomp. 22. u3"], [462, "442 HISTORY OF ROME. formation of the courts of justice ; and it was enacted that henceforth those courts shokd be composed of senators, eqktes, and the tribuk aerarii.2 These laws were carried without much opposition, but especially the latter, because the admiks tration of justice had been so grossly violated that even the friends of Sulla did not venture to oppose the new measure. Pompey, who had all along been a strong supporter of Sulla, thus over threw, or helped to overtkow, the very pillars of the power of the aristocracy ; but he wished for popkarity, and what he did was neither more nor less than what kl other men did for the purpose of gainkg their selfish ends and rising to honours, for, as we have aheady observed, men of all parties began their career by corn-ting the favour of the people, whose cause they afterwards abandoned as soon as then objects were at tained. The fate of Eome for many years past had been inseparably connected with that of individuals who set themselves up as party leaders, and sacrificed everytkng and everybody, as occasion offered, to then own love of domikon, their avarice, and ambition. Such henceforth contmued to be the case, and instead of a kstory of Eome we now have, strictly speaking, oky the history of individuals : the republic itself, from which all virtues and all sense of true patriotism, as well as the feeling of reverence for the gods, had disappeared, now became an arena on which the principal men were struggling for power and influence. Pompey, who in the time of Sulla had been most wonderfully favoured by fortune, was now riskg with extraordinary rapkity in popkar favour. He possessed considerable talent, and was animated by an insatiable ambition. There are times in which he acted with true generosity and greatness ; but at others he was mean and cowardly : in ks advocacy of popkar rights he was not honest, ks own aggrandisement being always upper most among ks motives, and he never was a sincere or trust worthy friend. Along with km were springing up many men ' Ascon. in Pison. p 16, in Cornel, p. 67 ; Schol. Bob. p. 229."], [463, "CN. POMPEY. 443 distinguished as generals and statesmen, some of whom were far superior to him in talent and character, and all of whom were striving to reach the same gok. Among them was L. Licikus Lucullus, a man of excessive wealth, who enjoys the unfortunate reputation of having made ks countrymen acquainted with Asiatic luxuries, in which he himself indkged very freely. His gardens and bkldkgs were objects of generk admiration ; even parts of the sea were changed by him into dry land or fish-ponds, whence Pompey in derision called him the Eoman Xerxes. He was distkgkshed as a general ; and he seems to have had a humane feering for the provincials. Another person, who likewise became proverbial for Iris wealth, was M. Licikus Crassus, whose treasures gave him more influence than either ks talent or energy. But by far the greatest of all Pompey's contemporaries was C. Julius Caesar, born in B.C. 100, and educated at Bhodes. He was equally distinguished by ks good fortune, ks perseverance, and energy, and by the wonderful comprehensiveness of his mind ; for he was no less great as an orator, a scholar, and an author, than as a statesman and a commander of armies. He was a gekus, in the true sense of the word, and a man of an amiable disposi tion ; ambitious as any of ks contemporaries, but free from envy and jekousy. M. Porcius Cato was a man of a very differ ent knd ; he had the strongest possible aversion to every kind of tyranny ; his virtues were those of an ancient Eoman republi can of the best times, and hence he was not fit for the age he lived in : when m the end he saw that it was hopeless to try to save the republic, he perished by ks own hand in a manner which has secured to him the admiration of all ages. M. Tulrius Cicero was six years older than Caesar : he was bom at Arpinum. The position he occupied at Eome, and the influence he exercised upon political affairs, he owed to his virtues, and to ks eloquence, in wkch he surpassed all around km. He possessed a great mind, enriched with the most varied acquirements, and was animated by a genkne love of ks country and its institutions ; but he was not without vakty : he was naturally of a timid and wavering"], [464, "444 HISTORY OF ROME. character, whence he had not always resolution enough opeky to declare k favour of the party or men to whom he was attached in ks heart. He has often been judged of far more severely than he deserves, merely because all the circumstances amid which he lived are not sufficiently taken kto consideration. All these and a great many more talented and distingkshed men, who grew up amid the storms of the republic, render the age in wkch they rived one of the most illustrious m the annks of the human race. They were each more or less opposed to one another, but Pompey above all possessed the art of con verting to ks own use a portion of the glory of each, by ks cunning and mtrigues, or by ks boastkg and violence ; and on many occasions he displayed a pitiable degree of vakty and mean ness even towards those who were skcerely attached to him. In the year B.C. 82, when Sulla entered Eome and celebrated ks bloody triumph, the praetor Q. Sertorks had been commissioned by ks party to go with ks army to Spam and there to endea vour to maintain then interests. He was joined by the remnants of the Marian party, and was afterwards supported with great enthusiasm by the Lusitakans and Celtiberians. He was a native of Nursia, k the country of the Sabmes, a district cele brated for the preservation of its primitive virtues and simplicity, and being a man of humble origin, he owed ks reputation and distmctions to none but kmself. He had the good of ks country really at heart, and had joined the Marian party merely because he detested the injustice and intrigkng machinations of the aristocrats. We have aheady seen that where justice required it he did not scruple to attack the proceedings of the leading men of ks own party, and it was k tks spirit that he saved Eome from the murderous hands of the freedmen of Marius. In Spain he acted on principles of kindness and humakty, by which he won the affection of the Spaniards, till he was driven to cruelty by their own treachery and fickeness. In order to secure their attachment to him he afforded them relief wherever he cokd, and attended to their just complaints ; he treated them as much"], [465, "445 A. SERTORIUS. as possible as Eomans, while previous governors had treated them as contemptible provincials. His great object was to blend Spaniards and Eomans together as one people, and the plan on wkch he proceeded was well calckated for the purpose, and might have produced the best reskts, if the Spakards had acted with miakmity and fidelity. In his first military undertakngs in Spam, Sertorius was un successfk; for an army which he sent out under Julius Sarinator to act agakst a Sullakan corps east of the Pyrenees, wkch was commanded by C. Ankus, was defeated by treachery : hence ks own position became so iinfavourable that he was unable to maintam himself in Lusitaka, and in B.C. 81 he crossed over into Africa. He remained there for some time, and took part in a war between two claimants to the crown of Mauritaka. On that occasion he collected great booty, and gained great reputation as a military commander. He was just on the pomt of withdrawing from public life to spend the remainder of ks days in the Canary Islands, when he was invited by the Lusitakans to come back and undertake the command of their armies ; for m ks absence they had been plundered and persecuted by Eomans of the Sk lanian party, and ks brilliant exploits in Mauritaka had filled the Spakards with fresh confidence. Sertorius after some hesi tation accepted the mvitation, and on ks arrivk k Spain both Spaniards and Eomans declared for km wherever he appeared. The Celtiberians also took up arms for km, and numbers of the proscribed Eomans flocked to his standard from all parts. His arms were successfk everywhere, and the manner k wkch he conducted the war is a proof of ks great military skill and prudence, as well as of his undaunted courage. His intention was to establish a new Eoman repubhc k Spain, for which purpose he formed a senate of 300 members, consisting partly of proscribed Eomans, and partly of illustrious Spakards ; he appointed republican magistrates also, in imitation of those of Eome ; and at Osca (Huesca) he established a great school in which the sons of distinguished Spaksh families were educated,"], [466, "446 HISTORY OF ROME. being dressed k the Eoman fashion, and kstructed k the Latk and Greek languages. These boys became at the same time a sort of security to him for the fidelity of the Spakards. The enthusiasm of the Spaniards was immense, and according to a custom of the country thousands of them crowded around him vowkg to rive and die with him. Wherever he went he was accompaked by a wkte fawn, which was looked upon by the Spaniards with a superstitious reverence, and believed to have been sent to him by the gods as a mark of their favour: this circumstance also greatly enhanced their confidence in km. The feeling of attachment and admiration wkch ks personal qualities had called forth was thus' heightened by a kind of religious veneration. In B.C. 79, Q-. Caecilius Metellus Pius, as proconsk, undertook the conduct of the war against Sertorius, but he and all his lieu tenants were defeated ; whereupon Metellus, not daring to attack ks enemy in the open field, tried to wear him out. In B.C. 77, M. Perperna, the legate of Lepidus, joined Sertorius with ks army, hoping kmself to act a prominent part in the war, but Iris men compelled lkn to submit to Sertorius. As Metellus was unable to make any impression upon the enemy, Cn. Pompey came with a fresh army to ks assistance, but he too was beaten, in B.c 76, in the battle of Lauro ; after wkch severk engagements took place, without anytkng decisive being gained by either party, though the Eomans were generally worsted. Pompey petitioned the senate to send re-inforcements, and when they came, in B.C. 74, he and Metellus laid siege to several fortified towns, but again without any success. In tks year the third war against Mithridates broke out, in consequence of an affiance concluded between Ser torius and the Pontian kkg, according to wkch the latter was to attack the Eomans in the east, whde Sertorius, supported by the fleet of Mitkidates and by the pirates, contemplated makkg a descent upon Italy. But disunion among the Spaniards, and the rebellious spirit of some, brought about a change k the state of affairs, by wkch Eome was saved. The conduct of the"], [467, "SPARTACUS. 447 Spakards made Sertorius suspicious, and led km to acts of cruelty, one of wkch in particular is of such a nature that it cannot be excused ; he ordered, one day, all the young Spakards at Osca to be put to death. Tks act kienated from km a great many Spakards, and made the Eomans k ks retinue kso become disaffected. Perperna, who had not been able to carry out his ambitious schemes in Spain, now wreaked Iris vengeance on Serto rius by forming a plot against ks life, k B.C. 72. In order to carry ks crimink plan into effect, he mvited Sertorius to a banquet at Osca, and while the guests were at table, he kmself and some other conspirators fell upon him and murdered km. Numbers of faithful Spaniards, who had sworn not to survive km, killed themselves at the burial of then- great commander. Perperna, who now thought he had gained ks object, placed him self at the head of the army of Sertorius ; but in the kst en counter with Pompey ks whole army was cut to pieces, and he kmself fell into the hands of his enemy and was put to death. In order to save kmself, Perperna had delivered up to Pompey a number of letters, m wkch some distinguished Eomans in vited Sertorius to come to Italy ; but Pompey, too generous to reward such treachery, tlirew the letters kto the fo-e without makng any use of them. Peace was thus restored in Spain, and the last remnants of the Marian party were now completely annihilated. But before the war k Spain was brought to a close, another had broken out m Italy, wkch tkeatened to become even more formidable, and was certakly far more destructive to the pros perity of Italy, for it was earned on by revolted gladiators and slaves. Among the slaves scattered all over Italy, there were many thousands who had once rived in luxury, and had enjoyed a better education than their present masters ; many had even distingkshed themselves in the wars against the Eomans. Such men must have been filled with rage and indignation at then wretched and revolting condition. The ablest among them were trained by then- masters in certain establishments called ludi"], [468, "448 HISTORY OF ROME. gladiator'd, or gladiator-schools, to amuse the Eoman popkace at the public games with then cruel and bloody contests in the circus. In b.c 73, about seventy such gladiators, headed by Spartacus, a Tkacian, broke forth from a gladiator-school at Capua. Then leader was a very able man, and well fitted for the daring enterprise he ventured upon. They first took up their position on mount Aetna, whence they made predatory ex cursions for the purpose of providing themselves with arms and ammuktion. When they felt strong enough, they gave the signal for a generk insurrection of the gladiators and slaves, to whom liberty was held out as a reward ; and in a short time Spar tacus had an army of no less than 10,000 slaves, all of whom were provided with arms. Spartacus had two sub-commanders of ks forces, Crixus and Oenomaus, both Gaks, who had like wise been slaves, and now took fearfk vengeance upon that free popkation, wkch had kept them in bondage. The free inhabi tants of Italy had been so greatly reduced in numbers in the time of Sulla, that no effectual resistance cokd be made agakst the slaves : all parts of southern Italy that were visited by them, were ravaged and laid waste without mercy, and many once flouriskng towns were changed into heaps of ashes. The consuls of the year B.C. 72 were completely unsuccessful, and the slaves gained victory upon victory. Spartacus advanced as far north as the foot of the Alps, probably with the view of settling in Gak, and defeated C. Cassius who had the command in Cisal pine Gak ; but ks hordes compelled him to go back, because they wanted to sack and plunder Eome. At this moment, B.C. 71, the praetor, M. Licikus Crassus, received the command agakst Spartacus, who was marching southward with the inten tion of rousing the slaves in Sicily. Crassus overtook Spartacus near Petiria in Lucaka. A battle was fought there, in wkch the slaves, indeed, raged like lions in despair ; but when their leader had fallen, they lost all hopes. The victory of Crassus was owing more to the division of the slaves into tkee armies, than to the skill of the Eoman general. The bodies or the limbs"], [469, "POMPEY'S CONSULSHIP. 449 of the slain were impaled along the kgh roads in southern Italy, to strike terror mto then fellow-bondsmen, and only 5000 of the slaves are skd to have escaped to the north of Itky. There they fell in with Pompey, who was just returning from Spain, and who completely cut them to pieces. The south of Italy kter tks war was in a most deplorable condition, for the free popka tion was almost extirpated : many towns, such as Nola, Thurii, Grumentum, and many others, were entirely destroyed, and the country was cut up into a number of deserted districts; which for a long time after served oky as pasture lands. The south of Italy never recovered from these fearftd devastations. At the time when Pompey returned from Spain he was only thirty-five years old, and had not yet been invested with any curule office. But he enjoyed the highest possible popkarity, wkch was the frait of ks reputation as a general; for he had distkguished himself m the Social war, and in the war agknst the Marian party in Sicily and Africa ; he had brought to a close the great war against Sertorius; and on his way home he had completed the victory over the slaves, thus snatckng away a portion of the laurels wkch were in reality due to his rival Crassus. He now sued for the conskship, which he received for the year B.C. 70 along with Crassus. The jealousy and rivahy existing between these two men made the Eomans tremble lest they should take up arms against each other ; but, towards the end of then conskskp, they were prevailed upon by the senate to make a reconciliation, wkch was never after disturbed. Pompey from the time he entered on his conskskp did everythkg he cokd to secure to himself the favour of the people : it was with this object in view that he restored the power of the tribunes, and assisted L. Aurerius Cotta in ks regkations concerkng the courts of justice. By these acts, however, he naturally drew upon himself the displeasure of the party to which he belonged.3 But party interests were not listened to when they came in 3 Pseudo-Ascon. in Cic.

Pompey also caused a census to be kstituted, wkch had been neglected for the last sixteen years ; and he not oky caused himself to be en rolled as a simple eques, but paraded himself as such, leading ks horse in the procession like every other eques. He further de lighted the people with magkficent games, wkch lasted from the 15th till the 29th of August. His colleague, Crassus, by ks immense wealth, endeavoured to outbid him for public favour by distributing large quantities of com among the people, and feasting them at ten thousand tables in public. After the expiration of ks conskskp Pompey did not undertake the administration of any province, but remained for two years at Bome in a private station, living in princely splendour, and enjoying the fame wkch he had acquired. An opportunity for further gratifying ks ambition was offered to km in the war agakst the phases. For some time past all parts of the Mediterranean had been kfested by swarms of phases, who carried on then robberies with the greater impukty because Bome had no powerfk navy, and because the rkers of Syria and Egypt were kept in inactivity by mutual jealousy. The number of pirates thus increased to an alarming extent, and there was no part of the sea or its coasts from Syria to the pkars of Hercules thatwas safe against them. Their principal strongholds were in Cilicia and Isauria, but they were joined also by Syrians, Cyprians, Cretans, Pamphyrians, and by Greeks from the maritime towns of Asia Minor and Greece. They possessed fortresses and large warehouses, in wkch they deposited then- plunder ; and they are said to have had upwards of a thousand vessels manned with experienced sailors and bold marines. Not only merchant vessels and transports were attacked by them, but they frequently landed on the coasts of Italy, and in the very neighbourhood of Eome, where towns and villas were plundered, and men, cattle, and goods of every description carried off, so that Eome itself was tkeatened with famine. On one occasion the pirates burnt the"], [471, "WAR AGAINST THE PIRATES. 451 Eoman skps in the port of Ostia, and for some time ranged about in Latium dividing the booty among themselves with per fect impunity. In the neighbourhood of Misenum on the Appian road they carried off the daughter of M. Antokus, the son of the orator and father of the triumvir. Such a state of things re quired energetic measures. The Eomans began to act against them as early as the year B.C. 78; and P. Servilius who re ceived the command continued ks operations for several years. He subdued the Isaurians (hence called Servilius Isauricus), and took some of the towns wkch were in the possession of the pirates. In B.C. 73, the above-mentioned M. Antokus, a man notorious for his avarice and cruelty, succeeded Servilius. He carried on the war more especially agakst Crete, either from a desire to enrich himself there, or because the Cretans had really taken part in the proceedings of the pirates ; but he was unsuc cessfk, and died the year after. In B.C. 70, the praetor L. Metellus was fortunate agakst them, in and about Sicily ; and two years later, undertook a second war against Crete, which after a long and severe struggle he subdued k B.C. 67, whence he was honoured with the surname of Creticus. All these efforts produced little or no effect upon the phases, and before Metellus had conducted the Cretan war to a close, the tribune, A. Gabikus, in B.C. 67, brought forward a rogation that Pompey4 shokd be invested for tkee years with the supreme command over all parts and coasts of the Mediterranean, to a distance of 400 stadia from the sea, and with power to take as many officers, legions, skps, and as much money as he ikght tknk proper.

Tks period is the most glorious in the whole life of Pompey. His pmdence, skill, and qkckness of action, are deserving of the kghest praise. He had a large number of legates commanding under km, and stationed in all parts of the sea. He began his preparations towards the end of the winter, entered upon his operations m the begkkng of spring, and about the middle of summer the whole Mediterranean was cleared. During the first forty days of ks campaign he swept the pirates before him from the pkars of Herckes and the coast of Spain as far as Italy, and drove them from ail then recesses. He then made a short stay at Eome, and k forty-kne more days, as if he had drawn a net around them, he drove the pirates from Itky and Sicily into the Cirician sea, where he de feated them. Many of the pirates were taken prisoners or killed, the rest surrendered. He demolished then skps, and then landed k Ciricia, where he destroyed then strongholds. The whole campaign was fikshed in about three months. The submission of the pirates was owkg, k a great measure, to the humane manner in wkch Pompey treated them ; for they had, probably, been driven to then- mode of life by poverty and the impossibility of gakkg then living in any other way. Pompey sent them as colonists into ikand towns of Asia Minor and Greece, where they had the means of living in a creditable manner and wokd be properly watched. The Cirician town of Soli received from the conqueror the name of Pompeioporis. 'While he was thus engaged in the south of Asia Minor, the Cretans, who were hard pressed and cruelly treated by Metellus, sent a message to Pompey, offering to surrender to him if he wokd come over, that they might not fall into the hands of Metellus. But Pompey had no time to spare; and Metellus, in spite of the com-"], [473, "453 POMPEY IN ASIA. mand of Pompey to withdraw from the island, completed its subjugation, for wkch he afterwards celebrated a triumph. After the conclusion of thewar against the pirates, Pompey did not return to Eome, but remained in Asia, probably with a view to obtak the command against Mitkidates also, for he cokd rely upon the zeal of his partisans at Eome : he spent ks time in Asia in making various regidations k the towns wkch he had conquered."], [474, "454 CHAPTEE XXX. THE THIRD WAR AGAINST MITHRIDATES. WAR AGAINST THE TIIRACIANS. At the period when Pompey gamed ks glorious victory over the phases, the republic had for some time been involved k a fresh war against Mitkidates of Pontus, wkch arose out of that agakst Sertorius in Spain, and lasted altogether for nearly ten years. In B.C. 74, Sertorius sent two proscribed Eomans to Mithridates to form an alliance with km, and stir him up against Eome. The kng was to assist Sertorius with ks fleet, and in case of then combked efforts succeedkg, he was to have the sovereignty of all Asia. In the same year Nicomedes, kkg of Bithyma, died, and bequeathed ks kkgdom to the Boman people. Mitkidates, encouraged by the offer of Sertorius, not oky refused to recogkse tks bequest, but resolved to wage war against the Eomans with all the powers he possessed. Besides ks kkgdom of Pontus, he rked over a part of Cappadocia ; and a number of princes, east and north of the Black Sea, as far as the river Dkester, were k affiance with him, or stood to him k the relation of vassks. He himself had enormous treasures, and a well-disciplined army of 156,000 men; and cokd rely upon the co-operation of the phases as well as of Sertorius. He began the war by mvadkg Bithyma, whereupon the Eoman senate sent the consk, M. Aurerius Cotta, with an army into Asia. In the neighbourhood of Chalcedon the hostile armies met, and the Eomans were defeated. Cotta took refuge witkn the walls of the town, and Mitkidates soon after burnt the Eoman fleet in its harbour. The kkg then took Heraclea, and began to besiege the wekthy and popkous town of Cyzicus,"], [475, "455 THIRD MITHRIDATIC WAR. wkch he intended to make ks starting point for the conquest of all Asia Mkor. But the khabitants of Cyzicus remamed faitivfk to Eome, and, though unassisted, defended themselves bravely and resolutely, repelling every attack of the enemy. While the siege was going on, L. Lickius Lucullus, the colleague of Cotta, arrived in Asia with a fresh army ; and Mitkidates, who had been lkgering too long before Cyzicus, soon discovered that Lucullus had cut him off from all supplies of provisions. After having sustained some severe losses in the engagements with ks adversary, the kng retreated, and hastened to Nicomedia and thence to Skope. Lucullus pursued ks enemy, who almost seems to have lost ks senses, for he did not know how to maktak himself anywhere. At Skope, however, he agak as sembled ks troops ; and k an engagement of ks cavalry with the Eomans, in the neighbourhood of Cabira, he gamed some advantages : but all was of no avari, for soon kterwards he fled to Comana, and thence to his son-m-law Tigranes, king of Armeka. Tigranes for some time refused to give him any support, but in the end consented to do so. Lucullus, k the meantime, entered Pontus, where the towns, though they defended themselves gallantly, were compelled to surrender one after another, because the armies wkch ought to have protected them were dispersed : 60,000 of the kng's subjects are said to have been killed in this campaign. After havmg accomplished the conquest of Pontus, Lucullus spent some time k regkating the affairs of the newly-acquired coun tries, and in the meanwhile sent Appius Claudius to Tigranes to persuade km to deliver up ks father-in-law to the Eomans -. when tks was refused, Lucullus at length, in B.C. 69, crossed the rivers Eupkates and Tigris, and besieged Mithridates and Tigranes m Tigranocerta. The host of Asiatic soldiers there assembled were dispersed like chaff, and the city, with its immense treasures, fell into the hands of the Eomans. Tigranes, m order not to be recogksed, tkew away ks diadem, and took to flight ; and the defeated kkgs then endeavoured to gak the support of"], [476, "456 HISTORY OF ROME. Pkaates, kng of the Partkans. Tigranes, however, made another stand agakst the Eomans at Artaxata, where he was agak defeated ; and Lucullus then took possession of Nisibis, a town of Mesopotamia, where he spent the winter of B.C. 68 and 67. While he was staying there, an insurrection broke out among his troops, which had been stirred up by P. Clodius, ks own brother-k-law, who aheady showed strong symptoms of the detestable career he afterwards pursued. The rebellion broke out ffi-st among the veterans of Valerius Flaccus (Valeriani), who had been serving in Asia for many years, and now demanded to be sent home. Lucullus, it is true, succeeded in queffing the mutky ; but it k spired ks enemies with fresh hopes, while to some extent it paralysed ks own energy. Mitkidates suc- ceeded k completely cuttmg to pieces an army of 7000 men under the command of the legate, C. Triarius, and agam recovered a part of ks kkgdom of Pontus. Lucullus followed him, and ks men at first obeyed ks commands ; but as he approached the kkg they again refused obedience, and it was oky with the utmost criffickty that he persuaded them to serve to the end of the present campaign. Just at tks time, B.C. 67, the consk M'. Aquirius Glabrio was appointed to succeed Lucullus in the command against Mitkidates ; for the enemies of Lucullus at Eome, and especially the friends of Pompey, had set on foot a report that Lucullus was protracting the war for the purpose of enrickng kmself, and ks late misfortunes gave ks enemies a welcome pretext for re caffing him. When Glabrio arrived in Bithyma he remaked perfectly idle, but he issued a proclamation that the army of Lu cullus should be disbanded, and tkeatened to puksh those that shokd continue to serve under km. The army of Lucullus accord ingly dispersed ; some of the poorer soldiers alone clung to then commander, who had the mortification of seeing Mithridates again take possession of Pontus and Cappadocia, for Glabrio made no efforts whatever to prevent it. All tks was the work of the friends of Pompey, who wanted km to reap the frkts of his"], [477, "POMPEY IN THE EAST. 457 predecessor's labours. The eqktes perhaps had some reason to be dissatisfied with Lucullus, for though he accumkated immense wekth in Asia, still he seems, on many occasions, to have pro tected the provkcials against the greedy extortions of the farmers of the public revenue. But on ks return to Eome he was, nevertheless, very honourably received, and rewarded with a triumph. He brought with him immense riches, and afterwards lived in the enjoyment of the luxuries with wkch he had become so familiar k Asia. In B.C. 66, while Pompey was yet k the south of Asia Mkor, and Glabrio, in Bithynia, was allowkg Mithridates to act as he pleased, the tribune C. Makrius brought forward a kil, that in addition to the seas and countries over which Pompey had the supreme command, he shokd be invested with unlimited power also in Bithyma, Pontus, and Armeka, for the purpose of con ductkg the war agknst Mitkidates. Tks measure was opposed by Q. Catkus, and by the orator Q. Hortensius ; but the tribunes and the people were resolved to carry then- plan, and kfluential men, like C. Julius Caesar, supported it. Cicero, who was then praetor, recommended the scheme in a splendid speech, the kst he ever addressed to the assembled people ; and the bffi was carried. Cicero and Caesar supported Pompey on tks occasion, because both were anxious to gak the favour of the people by attachkg themselves to the man who at that time was their idol ; for both must have seen that the measure was unconstitu tional, and replete with danger. The Eomans however had no reason to regret the step they took ; though if Pompey had been a man like Sulla, tkngs wokd have turned out very differently. When Pompey undertook the war against Mitki dates his position was far less surrounded by diffickties than that of Lucullus had been, for he received strong rerirforcements, and Mithridates was worn out by ks many vicissitudes. Pompey set out from Cilicia, and had an interview with Lucullus in Gkatia ; but the ill feelkg between them was too strong to lead to any good, and the meetkg ended in bickerings and disputes. x"], [478, "458 HISTORY OF ROME. Pompey then concluded an affiance with the kng of the Par tkans ; and one kght he fought a battle with Mithridates on the banks of the Eupkates, in wkch the kkg was defeated and put to flight. Before purskng him, Pompey founded the town of Nicoporis. Mithridates fled kto Colcks, as Tigranes reksed to give him any further assistance. Pompey, on the invitation of Tigranes, then entered Armeka, and the kng humbly surrendered himself to the conqueror, who deprived km of all ks possessions with the exception of the kngdom of Armeka, made him pay 6000 talents, and raised ks son, the younger Tigranes, to the tkone of Sophene. Pompey spent the enskng winter on the river Cyrnus (Kur) where the Albakans made an unsuccessfk attack upon him. In the spring he advanced into the country about Mount Caucasus, and sought against the Albakans and Iberians, after wkch he entered Colcks ; but the diffickties he had to contend with among the warlike tribes of those countries induced km to pursue Mithridates no farther. He concluded peace with the Albakans and Iberians, and returned tkough Armeka to Syria, leavkg Mitkidates to ks own fate. The latter, in the mean time, made great efforts, and formed very bold plans for attack ing the Eomans, for he still had large treasures at ks command, and hoped to rouse the Scytkans, with whom he contemplated invading Italy from the north. But ks own soldiers dreaded so gigantic an undertakng, and were resolved not to enter upon it : headed by the kng's own son Phamaces, they broke out into open rebellion at Panticapaeum in the Crimea. The kng, well knowing that ks rife was not safe, took poison, but as tks had no effect, he prevailed upon a slave to put an end to his life, in B.C. 63. His unnatural son Phamaces sent the corpse to Pompey, who was then still lingering in Asia, and who, having shown it to ks soldiers, ordered it to be buried with royal splendour. Pompey, on ks arrival in Syria, immediately deposed king Antiochus XIII. , who had been raised to the throne by Lu-"], [479, "THRACIAN WAR. 459 cullus, and constituted Syria, with Phoenicia, a Eoman pro vince. Jerusalem was at tks time distracted by a civil war between the two brothers Hyrcanus and Aristobkus : Pompey, aster ks return from an expedition kto Arabia, supported the former, and took the sacred city after a siege of tkee months, k B.C. 63. He did not interfere with the religious practices of the Jews, but deprived the reigning family of its kngly titles, and appointed Hyrcanus high-priest : Aristobkus was sent to Eome as a prisoner, and Judaea became tributary to the republic. When tks was accomplished Pompey, before returkng to Eome, spent a considerable time in Asia, regkatkg the affairs of the country. Phamaces, the treacherous son of Mithridates, received the kkgdom of Bosporus, wkch he retained untfl the arrival of J. Caesar in those districts, in B.C. 47 ; Deiotarus, tetrarch of Galatia, received Lesser Armeka; many other persons received kmgdoms and principalities at the hands of Pompey ; and Tigranes and Ariobarzanes were allowed to remain kngs respectively of Cappadocia and Armenia Proper: Syria and Ciricia became Boman provinces. Pompey did not leave Asia tk the spring of B.C. 62, when he embarked at Ephesus ; but ks progress tkough Greece was so slow, that he did not arrive in Italy untd the end of the same year. At the time when the Eoman arms were engaged against Sertorius, and even for some years before, the province of Macedoka was endangered by the kvasion of some barbarous tribes from Tkace, who ravaged the country in a most cruel manner. The war against them was undertaken m B.C. 77, by the proconsk Appius Claudius, who defeated them in several battles ; but he died in the course of ks campaign, before the war was brought to a close. He was succeeded by C. Scribo- kus Curio, in B.C. 75, who conquered the Dardakans, and penetrated as far as the river Danube ; but the war was not brought to an end till B.C. 72, when the consk M.

The Eoman arms were thus victorious everywhere : withk a few years Spain was subdued, an insurrection of the slaves was quelled, the pirates were swept from the sea, the kngdom of Mithridates was destroyed, and the province of Macedoka was not oky secured, but the Boman dominion in that quarter was extended far beyond it."], [481, "461 CHAPTEE XXXI. THE CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE. POMPEY AFTER HIS RETURN FROM ASIA. With all these glorious ackevements abroad, the condition of the people of Eome and Italy was not improved : the popkation of Eome sank more and more into an abyss of mork depravity and profligacy, and the city was in fact little better than a den of robbers and vagabonds, k whom all the nobler feelkgs of human nature were extinct, and virtue and justice were laughed at and scorned. One of the most strikmg examples of the violation of every law of justice and humakty was exhibited by the propraetor, C. Verres, during ks administration of Sicfly, from B.C. 73 to B.C. 71 : though he plundered the island in the most unscrupkous manner, and k defiance of all laws, human and divine, carried away the finest works of art from temples, as well as from the houses of private persons, he escaped the pukshment he so ricky deserved ; for all the exertions and eloquence of Cicero were of no avail, the judges knowkg too well that the condem nation of Verres wokd be a condemnation of their own conduct. He found an advocate in Q. Hortensius, and the nobles and many magistrates kd then utmost to obtain ks acquittal. Verres km self, who had no faith k ks own case, withdrew from Eome, but was afterwards permitted to return. Boundless desires and wants strengthened the love of robbery and plunder ; and glut tony, extravagance, and profligacy of every knd reached a height wkch to us appears to approach real madness. The optimates set the example, and the popkace followed it with an audacity and impudence wkch cokd arise oky from their knowing that the laws were utterly powerless. The good men, whose number"], [482, "462 HISTORY OF ROME. was very small, had everytkng to fear, while the bad ones had everything to hope. Eome was in a state of extreme dissolu tion, and the republic was a mere name. There is, perhaps, no example k the kstory of man of such consummate wickedness as that of C. Sergius Catilka, who acted more like an kcarnate evil demon than a human bekg. He was descended from a noble family, and had become accustomed to murder and bloodshed in the days of Sulla, to whose party he belonged. It cannot be deked that he was an extraordkary man, and that he possessed all the qualities wkch might adorn a great man k such times as those in wkch he lived, for ks courage was unparalleled, and he possessed a gigantic strength both of body and rknd. The accounts which we have of ks crimes may, kdeed, be\" exaggerated k some points, but in the main they are unquestionably correct, though it is diffickt to see what was the object of the enormous wrongs he planned, unless it were to set kmself up as a tyrant on the ruins of Eome, and on the heaps of the corpses of ks fellow-citizens. In the course of his dissolute life he had squandered all ks pro perty, and he now saw no help for kmself except in a revolution : many other nobles, who were in the same or similar chcumstances, were also gained over by km, for he is said to have possessed such a fascinatkg power over those who came k contact with him that no one could resist km. Some of the nobles, such as M. Licikus Crassus, in their feuds against one another may have supported ks schemes, skee they looked upon him as a welcome kstrument for the attainment of their selfish ends. He was accordingly joined by profligates of all classes and parties, as well as by the dregs of the popkace, who longed for the revival of the pro scriptions of the time of Sulla. Catkne began ks ffiabolical macknations in b.c 66, three years before the conskskp of Cicero, whom he hated more than any other man. He had been propraetor of the provkce of Africa, and on ks return he ktended offering himself as a can didate for the conskskp, but being accused of extortion in his"], [483, "463 CATILINE. province he was obliged to give up his plan. He is said on tks occasion to have been defended by Cicero.1 In order to take vengeance on those who thwarted him, he, in conjunction with some young nobles, formed a conspiracy for the purpose of murdering the consuls of B.C. 65, and many of the senators ; but the scheme was frustrated by Catiline himself, who, impatient of delay, gave the signk before his associates were quite prepared for the perpetration of the crime. In B.C. 64, Catkne agkn came forward as a candidate for the conskskp ; and, in conjunction with C. Antokus, he made the greatest efforts to defeat Cicero who likewise stood for the conskskp. The optimates at first treated Cicero, as an upstart, with great contempt ; but then fear of Catiline's success at length kduced them to support Cicero, who enjoyed great popkarity with the people, and now bore down all opposition. Catirine's mkd now thought of nothing but revenge and murder, and he was determined to carry out ks former de sign on a much larger scale ; for the city of Eome was to be reduced to a heap of ashes, and all the leading men of the time were to be kked in one general massacre. Some of ks noble associates provided him with money for the purpose of causing at the same time an ksurrection k Picenum and Etruria. The plan was aheady matured for execution, when Fkvia, who had been kformed of the plot by her friend Curius, one of the conspirators, reported it to the consk Cicero, who from the first had kept a watckul eye upon the proceedkgs of Catiline, and now resolved to take the most energetic measures to sup press the conspiracy. His colleague C. Antonius was suspected, and not without good reason, of being an accomplice of Catiline ; so k order to keep him k good humour and out of the way of the conspirators, he gave up to km the lucrative province of Macedonia, of wkch he was to take charge at the expiration of ks conskskp. On the 8th of November, Cicero addressed so impres sive a speech to the senate, that Catiline, who was present, quitted 1 Ascon. ad Cic. Orat. in Tog. Cand. p. 85 ; comp.

The next day Cicero delivered another speech on the same subject to the people : the senate then de clared Catirine a public enemy, and ordered Cicero to provide for the safety of the city, commandkg at the same time that an army shokd be raised. An event occurred in the meantime wkch put Cicero in possession of the most unexceptionable evidence of the conspiracy and its accomplices. Some Allobrogian ambassadors came to Eome, who brought with them letters from Catkne to ks comrades in the city ; for on their way through Etruria he had attempted to gain them over to ks scheme. The ambassa dors, however, secretly reveked the whole affair to Cicero. When they left Eome they were again charged with letters to Catirine ; but k the kght between the 2nd and 3rd of December, as they qktted Eome, they were apprehended, for the sake of appearance, near the Mkvian bridge, and all the letters thus fell into the hands of Cicero, who immediately laid the whole matter before the people. The Ailobrogians were rewarded for the disclosures they had made, and Cicero ordered those conspirators who were at Eome, and whose crime was established by their correspon dence, to be tkown into prison. Among them were the praetor Lentkus, Cethegus, Statirius, and Caeparius. On the 5th of December Cicero delivered ks fourth Catilkarian speech in the senate, respecting the punishment to be inflicted on those of the conspirators who had been arrested. He himself proposed that, as then- crime was proved, they shokd be put to death; and Cato supported him in this view. As all the senators, with the exception of J. Caesar, were of the same opikon, the conspira tors were strangled in prison on that same day. Tks summary proceeffing, though perfectly just and in accordance with the prkciples of Eoman law, afterwards became to Cicero the cause of great trouble and suffering. The conspiracy, however, was not yet suppressed ; for Catkne, who had in vain attempted to escape into Gak, assembled an army in Etruria : the war against him was ordered to be con ducted by C. Antokus, but as he was k or unwilling to fight"], [485, "465 POMPEY RETURNS TO ITALY. against ks former associate, ks legate, M. Petreks, under took the management of the war. In the beginnkg of b.c 62, Catirine was compelled to engage in battle near Pistoria, in the north of Etruria. Catirine and ks men fought like lions ; all fell sword k hand, and none took to flight ; 3000 conspirators were slam k the engagement, and among them their leader. The conspiracy itself was thus crushed ; but there were numbers of persons, both at Eome and k Itky, who although not actuk accomplices of Catirine yet in then hearts favoured him, and had hoped to derive advantages from ks revolution : it was this class of men who caused the subsequent disturbances, and some years later drove Cicero into exile. Cicero trky deserved the gratitude of ks country, skce it was owing to ks exertions and vigilance kone that the republic was saved from a miserable destruction; and we cannot wonder that in after ke he spoke of the occurrences of his conskskp with pride and satisfaction. The senators skuted km as the father of his country, and declared him worthy of a civic crown. But the happkess he thus enjoyed did not last long; for a few days after he had laid down ks conskship the tribunes Metellus Nepos, and Bestia, in conjunction with J. Caesar who was then praetor, declared that Pompey must return from Asia to restore the constitution, which had been violated by Cicero havkg put to death Boman citizens without a formal trial. Tks proposk created great disturbances ; and had not Cato, who was one of the tribunes, opposed ks colleagues with all ks might and ks usual firmness, matters wokd aheady have come to a sad crisis.2 Pompey did not land in Italy till the end of the year B.C. 62 ; on his arrival at Brundusium he ksbanded ks army, in order to impress upon the people the notion that, notwithstandmg ks extraordkary ackevements, he stk honoured republican liberty. In the beginkng of B.C. 61 he arrived at Eome, without any armed force, and was received by the people with the greatest joy and enthusiasm. He celebrated ks victories with a more splenkd - Plut.

Vast sums of money were deposited k the public treasury ; every solker who had served in ks legions received a present of about 45^. ; and Pompey devoted a part of ks booty to the buildkg of a temple of Minerva, with an kscription recording ks victories.3 But notwithstanding ks affectation of republican sentiments, and his generosity, he was unable to kduce the senate to sanction the arrangements wkch he had made k Asia : Cato, Q.

CLODICS. \u2014 CICERO'S EXILE AND RESTORATION. \u2014 PTOLEMY AULETES. CLODIUS AND MILO. C. Julius Caesar had distkgkshed himself by ks ktrepkity and prudence even when a young man during the dictatorskp of Sulla, for he defied the dictator's command while every one else trembled, and it was maiky owing to ks prudence that ks name was not put on the proscription list. Pompey, who had not pene tration enough to comprehend so vast a mind as that of Caesar, received ks acts of friendskp and attachment as a homage done to ks own merits, wkle Caesar oky endeavoured to raise himself k popkar favour by ks connekon with Pompey. Caesar's unbounded liberality towards the people, plunged him into debts and diffickties, but tks was the means by wkch he gradually succeeded k eclipsing Pompey in popkarity. There existed a relationship between the families of Caesar and Marius, for Julia, a sister of Caesar's father, had been married to the elder Marius for whom Caesar always felt a strong attachment. When Julia died, k B.C. 67, Caesar delivered the funeral oration ; and two years later, B.C. 65, he restored one kght the statues of Marius and the representations of ks victories k the Capitol, all these marks of honour having been destroyed or removed by Sulla. Then restoration filled the senate with alarm, but delighted the people, who, with the greatest applause and enthusiasm, hailed the re-appearance of the well-known features of their former leader. From tks time Caesar became the avowed head of the remnants of the Marian party. In B.C. 62 he was invested with"], [488, "468 HISTORY OF ROME. the praetorship ; and after the expiration of ks office he went into ks province of Spain, where he suppressed an insurrection among the Lusitanians, and subdued some districts wkch had not yet recogksed the supremacy of Eome. The sums of money which he collected in Spam were so enormous, that he not oky had enough to pay ks debts, wkch are said to have amounted to one million sterlkg, but he had a large sum left to continue ks extravagances. About the middle of the year B.C. 60 he returned to Eome, and obtaked the conskship for the year following, together with M. Calpurnius Bibkus, an honest but narrow minded and obstinate man. The provinces which were assigned to the consks were of a kkd from wkch neither fame nor profit could be expected : tks exasperated Caesar, and as Pompey like wise was kspleased with the senate Caesar easily gained him over to ks side, and at the same time established a reconciliation between him and Crassus, whose money had often assisted Caesar in carrying out ks demagogic schemes. The ukon of these tkee men is commoky called the kst triumvirate : they now agreed among themselves that no political measures shokd be taken wkch might be ffispleaskg to any one of them.1 Caesar endeavoured to draw Cicero also into the coalition, but Cicero dreaded their ambitious schemes, and was k fact more anxious for the safety of the republic than for ks own personal influence. These tkee men now were all powerfk : they held the fate of the republic in their hands, they acted just as they pleased, and each of them hastened with equal zek towards the accomplishment of what he considered the consummation of ks desires. Crassus wanted to be at the head of the world for the sole purpose of increasing his wealth ; Pompey hoped to get ks arrangements in Asia sanctioned, and to heighten ks glory ; but Caesar saw tkough then designs, and ckculated beforehand what was gomg to happen, well knowing that in the end he shokd rise above both of them. Under such circumstances Caesar entered upon ks conskship 1 Sueton. Caes. 19."], [489, "CAESAR'S CONSULSHIP. 469 in b.c 59. He began Iris proceedings by carrying a series of laws kl of wkch tended to raise him in the people's esteem, while they offended the senate and ks colleague Bibkus. In order to ren der the senate more amenable to public opikon, he enacted that thenceforward regkar records of the transactions in the senate and the assembly shokd be kept and published.2 By a second regulation he secured the good will of the whole body of equites. by releasing the farmers of the public revenue from one-third of the sums they owed to the public treasury, for k their eagerness to obtain the contracts they had offered larger sums than they found it possible to pay. A far more important measure however was his agrarian law. Tks was a mokfication of a bk which had been brought forward in B.C. 63 by the. tribune Servilius Bulks, but had been defeated by Cicero. The provisions of tks law were as follows. A commission of 20 conskars was appointed to kstribute the domain land in Campania, and the district called Stellatis, to such poor citizens as had at least tkee ckldren : the lots thus assigned were not transferable by sale for the next twenty years. As there was not land enough to satisfy all who preferred their claims, it was further enacted that other districts shokd be purchased out of the booty which Pompey had brought from Asia : a colony kso was established at Capua. Not less than 20,000 citizens are said to have received allotments of land by tks agrarian law. Bibulus, Cicero, and the whole senate opposed the measure, but then- exertions were useless : Bibkus altogether withdrew from public life, and shut himself up k ks house for the rest of the year. Caesar was thus, in fact, sole consk, and might act as he pleased.3 In order to ukte himself still more closely with Pompey, Caesar at length got the senate to sanction Pompey's arrangements in Asia :4 he kso gave km ks own daughter Jkia in marriage, though she was betrothed to another man. With the view of securing the permanence of ks 2 These records, resembling our 44; Liv. Epit. 103; Appian, Bell. newspapers, were called acta diurna; Civ. ii. 10. Suet. Caes. 20. 4 Appian, Bell.

Ckpurkus Piso, who was, tkough the influence of Caesar, elected consk for the year followkg along with A. Gabikus. Having thus ksured the favour of Pompey, the people, and the eqktes, he now found it easy to obtam the provkce he liked, and also to secure a long contkuance of k? power. This latter pokt he accomplished by a violation of the constitution. Hitherto a province had never been assigned to any man for a period longer than one year ; but Caesar got the tribune Q. Vatkius to carry a law by wkch the provinces of Cisalpme Gak and niyrieurn were given to him for five years : the senate afterwards added the provkce of Transalpine Gak, because it was evident that a bill wokd be proposed to the people for that purpose, if the senate did not grant that province also. Having thus obtained what he wanted, and havkg established ks influence at Eome. by consuls of ks own choice, Caesar prepared for setting out with ks legions to Gak. Q. Cicero, the brother of the orator, was appokted to accompany km as one of ks legates ; but the orator kmself refused to go with km, and thereby offended Caesar, who remained with ks army k the neighbourhood of Eome until the end of April B.C. 58, to support Clodius. P. Clodius was the son of Appius Claudius, who had been consk in B.C. 79 ; he belonged accordkgly to the haughty patri cian family of the Claudri. At that time there was none, with the exception of Catirine, who surpassed km in profligacy, and k the perpetration of crimes of every knd. He was married to a sister of Lucullus, in whose camp at Nisibis he had acted the part of a mutineer. In B.C. 61, while the vestals and matrons were celebrating the festivk of the Bona Dea, in the house of the Pontifex Maximus (J. Caesar), Clodius, in the disguise of a woman, sneaked kto the house to have a secret meetkg with the wife of Caesar. His violation of the sanctity of religion was discovered, and the criminal was brought to trial. Cicero, between whom and Clokus there had been untfl then no en mity, was called upon to undertake ks defence, and to show"], [491, "P. CLODIUS. 471 that at the time the crime was committed Clodius was not at Eome. Cicero not only refused to comply with the request, but bemg overcome by an honest indignation, bore witness against him, and made so severe an attack upon km, that ks condemnation wokd have been unavoidable had he not pur- chased ks acqkttal. Tks was a bold proceeding on the part of Cicero, for wkch he had to do severe penance : Clokus never forgave him, and meditated revenge. In order to be able to obtain the tribuneskp, Clodius caused himself to be adopted into a plebeian family. His object was thus gained, and he was elected tribune for the year B.C. 58. He contrived to obtam the support of the consks, by promising to obtain for Calpur- nks Piso the province of Macedoka, and for Gabkius that of Syria. For tks price the unprincipled consks sold and betrayed the welfare of the republic, and the happkess of one of the few good men whom Eome possessed. By the gratktous distribu- tion of large quantities of com among the popkace of Eome, and by restoring the corporations of trades wkch had been suppressed by the senate k B.C. 68, he secured the favour of the mktitude : this done, he brought forward and carried a law, that whoso- ever had put to death a Eoman citizen, without a formal trik, shokd be outlawed. Cicero's name was not mentioned k the law, but every one knew that the blow was aimed at him. Pompey withdrew mto the country; Crassus bore a grudge agakst Cicero, who had mentioned km in connexion with the Catirinarian conspiracy ; the consks, and Caesar, who was still at the very gates of Eome with ks army, supported Clodius : Cicero, therefore, was abandoned by those who had the power and influ- ence to save km. He felt that he should be irrecoverably lost if he remained at Eome : without waiting for ks trial, therefore, he quitted the city and his country, lamented by the best citizens. Toward the end of March he went to Thessalokca in Macedoka, where he was kndly received by the praetor Plancks. After the departure of Cicero, Clokus procured ks formk condemna tion : he outlawed not oky Cicero, but every one that should"], [492, "472 HISTORY OF ROME. afford him protection ; he demolished ks house on the Palatine, destroyed two of ks vffias, and caused all ks remaimng property to be sold by public auction. After tks Clodius proposed several other laws, some of wkch were carried, and all of wkch tended, more or less, to brkg utter rkn upon the republic. He had once fallen into the hands of pirates, and Ptolemy, kkg of Cyprus and brother of the kng of Egypt, had decrined to ran som him. Clodius now took revenge, by carrying a law that the kkg shokd be deposed, on the plea that he was a bad rker; and k order at the same time to get rid of a troublesome oppo nent at Eome, he caused Cato to be appointed to go to Cyprus, to take possession of the island and constitute it a Eoman provkce. Ptolemy escaped the unjust deposition by takkg poison immediately before the arrival of Cato. Cyprus, however, became a Eoman province ; and Cato, on ks return to Eome, brought with him the sum of 7000 talents, wkch he honestly delivered up to the treasury. In tks manner the year of Clokus' tribuneship came to its close ; but no sooner had he laid down his office, than public opikon turned in favour of Cicero. Petitions to recall him were sent in from all parts, and several of the tribunes brought for ward bks to the same effect, but all were thwarted by the k trigues of Clodius. At length the consk P. Cornelius Lentkus, on the suggestion of his colleague Q. Caecirius Metellus, carried a law on the 4th of August, B.C. 57, by wkch Cicero was formally recalled from Iris exile. Exactly one month later he arrived at Eome, where ks return resembled a magnificent triumph : tks afforded him some consolation for ks sufferings. Pompey now was frienky towards Cicero, but only because he was at variance with Clokus ; and Cicero immediately after his return showed ks gratitude by supporting a bill proposed by the consks, that Pompey shokd be invested with the superintendence of all the importations of grain, with proconskar power k all the pro vinces for five years, and with the command of fifteen legions.^ 5 Dion. Cass. xxxix. 9 ; Appian, Bell Civ. ii. 18 ; Plut. Pomp. 49."], [493, "INSURRECTION IN EGYPT. 473 While these tkngs were gomg on at Eome, an ksurrection broke out at Alexandria in Egypt, k consequence probably of the loss of the fair island of Cyprus ; and the wretched kng Ptolemy Auletes, who had hitherto maktaked kmself at Alex andria with the aid of the Eomans, was obliged to take to flight. He arrived at Eome in B.C. 57, and by kstributkg large bribes among the leading men he endeavoured to get himself restored. P. Cornelius Lentulus, in ks conskskp, prevailed upon the senate to commission him to re-instate Ptolemy in his kkg dom ; but Cato, who thought such an undertakkg dangerous, caused the senate to issue a decree that Ptolemy should not be restored at all. Cicero and Pompey took part m these dis cussions, and supported Lentkus, but k vain. Afterwards, A. Gabikus, in ks proconskskp of Syria, m B.C. 55, was induced by the kkg, for the enormous bribe of 10,000 talents, to restore him in defiance of the decree of the senate. In adk tion to tks, Gabkius earned on k Syria a system of barefaced extortion, and the eques C. Babirius was ks associate in these disgracefk proceedings. On then- return to Eome, an action for extortion was brought agakst both of them, and Cicero was prevaried upon by Pompey to undertake then- defence. Pompey and Crassus exerted all their powers also to save Gabikus, but to no purpose, for he was exiled, and ks property was confis cated and publicly sold. The kternk condition of Eome, in the mean time, became worse and worse. In B.C. 56, Pompey and Crassus, by the desire of Caesar, tried to gak the conskskp a second time. All good citizens opposed the scheme, but violence carried the day. L. Domitius, who was one of the candidates who had publicly declared that he would propose to deprive Caesar of ks legions and province, was mtimkated by armed soldiers, and ks servant was cut down before ks eyes, to show km what he himself had to expect if he shokd persevere in ks skt. Pompey and Crassus were accordingly made consuls for B.C. 55. In com pliance with another desire of Caesar, they hired the tribune,"], [494, "474 HISTORY OF ROME. C. Trebokus, who by force and violence carried a law, by which Caesar's admikstration of Gak was prolonged for five years from the date of the law ; Crassus at the same time received Syria and the adjacent countries, and Pompey all Spain as ks provkce, each likewise for the period of five years. Cato, who ventured to oppose tks unconstitutional measure, was tkown into prison. Pompey also made some enactments concernkg the courts of jus tice, and bribery at elections, though it still contkued to be an understood thing that no one cokd obtam any of the offices without expenkng large sums to bribe the electors. The law, therefore, was a mere farce ; or, at least, was oky ktended to prevent a certkn grossness and openness of the crime, wkch itself cokd not be prevented. The kstory of the feuds between Clodius and Milo forms another very kstructive instance of the frightfk state of society in those days. If we reflect that what is related of those two must have been the case with hundreds of others whose position was less conspicuous, the msecurity of both person and property at that time must have been as great as k the most barbarous periods of the middle ages. Annius Milo and P. Clodius were bitter enemies, and each being in constant dread of the other, they never went out without being accompanied by bands of armed slaves, between whom bloody scenes were matters of ordkary occur rence. Shortly before the end of the year B.C. 53, the two parties met on the Appian road, and a scuffle ensued, k which Clokus, who was then a cankdate for the praetorship, bekg mortally wounded, died. Milo was charged with having murdered him ; and the friends and partisans of each threw Eome into such a state of confusion, that for many months it was impossible to hold the conskar elections : Eome was in a conktion of anarchy until Pompey was made sole consk, an appomtment wkch had never taken place before m the kstory of Eome. Milo, who was at the time a candidate for the conskship, was brought to trik about tkee months after the affray, and was defended by Cicero. Pom pey, who was unfavourable to Milo, had taken such extraordkary"], [495, "MILO AND CLODIUS. 475 measures for the trial, the whole forum bemg surrounded by armed soldiers, that Cicero, for the first time in ks rife, lost ks self-possession. He was so ktkridated that he was unable to plead for Milo, who was accordkgly condemned, but went kto exile at Marseilles.6 The year after this, b.c 51, Cicero, though very reluctantly, undertook the admikstration of the provkce of Cilicia, wkch was then tkeatened by the Partkans. 6 The oration for Milo still extant sa3>ing : \" If you had delivered this was written by Cicero afterwards.

CAESAR'S CAMPAIGNS IN GAUL. \u2014 THE AFFAIRS OF ITALY. \u2014 UNFORTUNATE WAR OF CRASSUS AGAINST THE PARTHIANS. EVENTS WHICH LED TO THE CIVIL WAR BETWEEN POMPEY AND CAESAR. The campaigns of Caesar in Gaul, from B.C. 58 to B.C. 50, are among the most memorable in the history of man ; and the more so because we possess a very accurate account of them by the great general himself, with a supplementary part wkch is pro bably the work of ks friend A. Hirtius. As tks work is k the hands of all, we shall confine ourselves to a brief outline of the principal events and a few general observations. Caesar, in ks general conduct, showed a mind wkch controlled all events, even the most untoward : he saw tkough everytkng, acted with the utmost caution and decision, and attached to himself the hearts of all ks solkers in such a manner that with him and for km they did everytkng and glaky ventured on the boldest undertakngs. But far different was his conduct towards the barbarians : k regard to them Caesar was no better than all other Eomans, with the exceptions oky of the Gracck and Sertorius; for the rives of thousands of barbarians were sacrificed without a scruple, and no means, however bad and immoral, were neglected if they kd but contribute to establish Eome's dominion and Caesar's greatness : he who among ks fellow-citizens was mild and forgiving acted in Gak with an almost unparalleled cruelty. But whatever were the sufferkgs wkch he inflicted upon Gak and the neighbouring countries, one circumstance may, perhaps, be looked upon as a compensation ; namely, tkough Caesar's campaigns those countries were drawn into the current of Eoman civilisation."], [497, "CAESAR IN GAUL. 477 At the time when Caesar arrived in Gak that country was in a state of great excitement ; for the Helvetii, a Gallic tribe dwell kg between the north of the Lake of Geneva, the river Elrine, and Mount Jura, had been kduced by Orgetorix,the most wealthy and powerfk man among them, to qkt then country and seek new homes k western or southern Gak. It may be that they were kduced to this extraordkary movement by the fact, that they were pressed m the north or east by the advancement of the German tribes, some of whom had already crossed the Ekne. Although their leader Orgetorix ked, the deluded people were deterrkned to carry out then plan ; and after having burnt all then- towns and vkages they marched into the country of the Sequani. Tkee of their clans had aheady crossed the river Arar (Saone), and the fourth called the Tigurik, was still on the eastern side of the river, when Caesar, who apprehended great danger to the Eoman province of Gak, arrived with ks legions and attacked the Tigurik, who were taken by surprise and entirely cut to pieces. He then pursued the other three clans, and fought a battle with them near the town of Bibracte (Autun), in wkch the Helvetii after a severe conflict were defeated with great slaughter, and the survivors took to flight. Being again overtaken by Caesar they were obliged to capitkate, and were compelled to return to their own devastated country. When the Helvetii left their native land, their number, comprising women and children, is said to have amounted to 368,000 : of these oky 110,000 survived to return to then- own country. Gak was at tks time occupied by a great number of tribes : party feeling extended even to towns and fanriries, which were rent asunder by political ksputes. The form of government among most of the tribes was of a republican nature ; but the greatest power was k the hands of the Druids, the priests, and the nobles, while the people were greatly oppressed, and were little better than the serfs of the nobles. One among the Gallic tribes kways held a sort of supremacy over the rest, resembling that wkch was once possessed by the Lacedaemokans in Greece."], [498, "478 HISTORY OF ROME. In former times tks supremacy belonged to the Arverk, but afterwards the Aedk rose by their side claiming the same dis tinction. They succeeded, and after the war of the Eomans against the Allobrogians in B.C. 121, the Aedk were honoured with the title of friends and allies of the Eoman people. As the power of the Arverk decrined, that of the Sequak rose ; and during the ksputes of the latter with the Aedk, they invited the Germans to come to Gak and assist them against their rivals. Tks seems to have happened about the year B.C. 72. Accord ingly Ariovistus, the King of the Suevi, crossed the Ekne with an army of 150,000 men, and again and again defeated the Aedk. But he kso compelled the Sequak to give up to km one-third of then territory : with this he rewarded ks men, and finally settled k the country. Other swarms of Germans followed ks example, and took up their abode in Gak. As Ariovistus had been honoured by the senate in Caesar's own conskskp with the title of king and friend, Caesar had no right to make war upon km ; but at the request of the Aedk, Caesar with ks army pene trated into the country of the Sequak and took possession of the town of Vesontio (Besancon) on the river Dubis (Doubs), and some days later he sought a decisive battle, in which the Suevi were completely defeated, and Ariovistus with a few survivors fled across the Ekne, wkther Caesar was wise enough not to follow him. These two great and glorious battles, wkch were fought by Caesar in his first campaign, raised his fame k all parts of Gak, and the more so because the Suevi had been heretofore believed to be invincible. In the second year of Caesar's administration of Gak, B.C. 57, all the Belgian tribes inhabitkg the countries between the Seine, the Moselle, and the Ekne, formed a cokederacy and rose in arms against the Eomans : they were alarmed by the success of the Eomans, and it wokd almost seem as if after Caesar's victory over Ariovistus somethkg had happened wkch caused tks general apprehension. The army of Belgians amounted to 300,000 men : the Eemi kone, into whose country Caesar"], [499, "CAESAR IN GAUL. 479 marched first, did not join their countrymen, but formed an affiance with the Eomans. Caesar contrived to separate the formidable army of the enemy, and was thus enabled to defeat the dk'erent tribes one after another. The brave Nervii held out longest, and brought Caesar's army into great peril ; but k the end they also were completely defeated in so bloody a battle that out of 60,000 oky 500 survived. At the same time Caesar received intelligence that ks legate M. Crassus had subdued the Veneti, TJneffi, and several other tribes in the north-west of Gak. The happy issue of tks brilliant campaign, by wkch the Eomans became masters of the greater part of northern Gak, was celebrated at Eome with public thanksgivings for kteen days. While Caesar was in ks wkter quarters, and in the early part of the spring of B.C. 56, while he was in Italy, the maritime tribes in the north-west of Gak, some of whom had submitted the year before, formed a powerful cokederacy agakst him. Caesar kmself undertook the war against the Veneti, while ks legates were sent into other parts. The Veneti were defeated, and treated most cruelly by the conqueror, for the purpose of striking terror into the other tribes. In the latter part of the summer, Caesar marched into the country of the Morik and Menapri, as they were still in arms, and ravaged then fields and villages in a frightfk manner. His legates in the meantime subdued the other revolted tribes ; and Crassus, not without great difficulty, conquered the greater part of Aqktaka. Gak was so much weakened by the exertions of the last two years, that for the present the people cokd not think of ventur ing upon a fresh war against the Eomans ; but Caesar was anxious to gak new victories, and to keep Iris legions in activity, k order that the people at Bome might not forget him. An opportunity soon offered. The Usipetes and Tencteri, two German tribes wkch had been kiven out of their own country by the Suevi, had crossed the Ehine not far from its mouth, and intended to settle in Gak. This, however, Caesar deterrkned to prevent, and marched against them, upon wkch the Germans"], [500, "480 HISTORY OF ROME. began to negotiate with km. Wkle the negotiations were going on, a body of German cavalry defeated one of Caesar's Gallic cavalry. The next day all the German ckefs came into Caesar's camp to apologise for what had happened. But Caesar, kstead of listening to them, detained them, and led out ks army to attack the Germans, who bekg deprived of then leaders made but feeble resistance and were nearly all cut to pieces by the Eoman cavalry. The remainder fled across the river kto Ger- many. This piece of treachery, wkch Caesar kmself relates without any scruple whatever, is one of the fokest acts of his life : when it became known at Eome, honest Cato proposed to the senate that Caesar shokd be delivered up to the barbarians to atone for his guilt.1 After this victory Caesar went up the Ekne. On the invitation of the Ubii to assist them agakst the Suevi : he built a wooden bridge somewhere k the neighbourhood of Neuwied, and marched across the Ekne into Germany. The oky object of tks invasion seems to have been to strike terror into the Germans, for after havkg ravaged the territory of the Sigambri for eighteen days he returned to Gak and broke down the bridge. Although the greater part of the summer was aheady gone, Caesar resolved to make an expedition kto Britak, wkch had been long known by that name, but was believed to be inaccessible. It seems to have had a charm for Caesar to invade an island wkch no foreign enemy had yet set ks foot upon, for he cokd not expect any great booty, and the districts from wkch the ancients derived their tk were in the far west of the island. He took with km oky two legions, with wkch he sailed from the port of Itius (probably Wktsand, between Calais and Bokogne), and after a severe struggle with the natives effected a lankng somewhere near the South Foreland. Some of the British tribes sent offers of submission to Caesar, but when they heard that a great part of the Eoman fleet had been destroyed they took up arms agak. As they were defeated, they agak offered to submit. The season bekg aheady far 1 Plut. Cat. Min. SI, Caes. 22; Appian, Be Reb. Gall. 18."], [501, "CAESAR IN GAUL. 481 advanced, Caesar accepted then subrkssion, oky demanding double the number of hostages they had given before, and returned to Gak just before the day of the eqknox. Although no conquests had been made k tks campaign, stffi ks victory over the Germans, and ks mvasion of Britak, seem to have created such wonder and admiration at Eome, that the senate decreed public thanksgivmgs for twenty days, notwithstanding the opposition of Cato. The campaign of the year B.C. 54 was opened with a war against the Treviri, and some of the Belgian tribes, wkch had shown a disposition to revolt. When peace was restored among them, Caesar determined to make a second expedition into Britain. With an army of five legions he sailed from the port of Itius, and landed at the same place as before. The Britons gave the supreme command to a chief, Cassivelaunus, whose territories lay north of the river Tamesis (Thames), and fought bravely against the mvader, but were defeated in several engagements. Caesar then crossed the Thames at the oky place where it was fordable, probably at Co way Stakes, near Oatlands, took the capital of Cassivelaunus, and conquered a great part of the present coun ties of Essex and Middlesex. Cassivelaunus was obliged to sue for peace ; and Caesar, having received hostages and settled the annual tribute which Britain was to pay to Eome, returned to Gak towards the end of the summer. He left no troops or garrisons in Britain, and accordingly the obekence and submis sion of the Britons was at an end as soon as he had quitted the island. During the enskng winter Caesar was obliged to place his army k different parts of Gaul in consequence of the great scarcity of provisions, and ks forces being thus divided, the Gaks thought it a favourable opportukty for recovering their independence. The detachment under ks legate Sabinus was destroyed by the Eburones almost to a man, and the camp of Q,. Cicero wokd have experienced the same fate had not Caesar come to its assistance. Y"], [502, "482 HISTORY OF ROME. The partial success of the Eburones encouraged severk other Gallic tribes to enter kto a confederacy in B.C. 53, and attempt to recover then independence. But Caesar kcreased ks forces and easily succeeded in subduing the insurgents. As the Treviri had been supported by the Germans, he agkn crossed the Ekne at a point somewhat kgher up the river than the kst time. The TJbii submitted to km, and he advanced into the country of the Suevi. But the latter retreated into their forests and fastnesses, and Caesar, unable to pursue them, again re-crossed the Ekne, having gained by this second invasion just as little as by the kst. On his return, finding Ambiorix, the ckef of the Eburones, still in arms, he made the strongest efforts to subdue him : the country of the Eburones was laid waste in a frightful manner, and the troops of Ambiorix were repeatedly defeated, but he kmself always escaped faffing into the hands of the Eomans. The Sigambri also crossed the Bhine, and nearly took possession of Cicero's camp. Some of the rkgleaders of these insurrections fell into the hands of Caesar : this kcensed all the tribes of Gak, and their hatred of the Boman yoke became so intense, that the whole of central Gak conspired agakst it, and all the fruits of Caesar's victories seemed to be lost. The insurrection broke out among the Carnutes, but it spread with such rapidity that in a veiy short time nearly the whole of Gaul was agak in arms. Even the Aedk, who had ktherto acted as the friends of Eome, after a while joined the rebels. At then head was Vercingetorix, a noble Arvernian, a man worthy of ks post, and by far the ablest general whom Caesar had yet encountered in Gak. Under such circumstances Caesar entered on ks seventh cam paign k b.c 52, even before the end of the wmter. After having provided for the safety of the Eoman province, he marched into the country of the Arverk (Auvergne). Caesar's genius in that year displayed itself more strikingly than ever : he acted with the utmost prudence, and yet with a qkekness wkch astokshed Iris enemies. In a short time he conquered the most important towns"], [503, "483 CAESAR IN GAUL. of the Gaks ; andVercingetorix, in order to impede his progress, prevailed on the Gaks to lay waste their country. Avaricum (Bourges), the ckef town of the Bituriges, being spared, was accordkgly laid siege to by Caesar, who, after a most gallant resistance of the inhabitants, took the place, and ordered the whole popkation, men, women, and children, to be butchered indiscriminately. Caesar now divided ks army into two parts, and with six legions laid siege to Gergovia ; but having received a severe repulse in an attempt to storm the town, and being informed of the revolt of the Aedui, he raised the siege, and, not without great danger, contrived to join the other part of ks army, which was commanded by Labienus. The insurrection of the Aedk filled the Gaks with fresh courage, and led Caesar, who began to fear for the skety of the province, to march south ward kto the country of the Sequak, where he was followed by swarms of Gaks who attacked him on ks road. Vercingetorix now retreated to Alesia (Arise in Burgundy), whither he was pur sued by the Eomans. He took refuge k the town, wkch was con sidered impregnable, and resolved to wait for succours from his countrymen. Caesar laid siege to Alesia, but soon found himself surrounded by a numerous army of Gaks. His gemus, however, prevented Vercingetorix from breakng tkough the Eoman lines, and routed the Gallic army, and Alesia was ktimately compelled by famine to surrender. Vercingetorix, who wished to save the lives of ks people, desired himself, who was the cause of the war, to be delivered up to Caesar. On that occasion Caesar agak acted with unpardonable cruelty ; for instead of treating ks humbled enemy with generosity, he ordered him to be kept in chains until ks triumph, and afterwards put him to death. The fall of Alesia being followed by the submission of the Aedui and Arverk, Caesar resolved to pass the wkter at Bibracte in the country of the Aedk. The fate of Gak was now determined, though some tribes still remamed m arms, and formed fresh plans against the Eomans. Caesar spent the summer of B.C. 51 in re duckg those tribes. The Belgians also began to stir, but it was y2"], [504, "484 HISTORY OF ROME. too late, for Gak was too much exhausted, and was unable to offer any efficient resistance to the Boman arms. After having effected the pacification of Gaul, and made the necessary negotiations in the newly conquered countries, he went, k the spring of B.C. 50, to Cisalpine Gaul, leaving ks army k the districts beyond the Alps. Gak was at that time a rich country, and Caesar had amassed kimense treasures ; ks soldiers were attached to him with their whole hearts ; and in Bome and Itky ks ackevements had raised the greatest admiration of his talent and valour. Tkee hundred tribes are said to have been subdued by him ; and the supremacy of Bome was recogksed by the Helvetii, the Gaks, and Belgians. During these years of active engagement k Gak, Caesar, who had a watchfk eye upon every tkng that was going on k Bome, kept Iris friends there k such incessant activity to promote the interests of his cause and party, that ks enemies began to be alarmed. We have aheady seen in what manner L. Domitius was led to desist from his skt for the consk ship of b.c 55. In the spring of B.C. 56, when Pompey, kthe capacity of superintendent of the supplies of corn, was sent by the senate to Sardika, Caesar contrived to meet Pompey and Crassus at Luca, in the north of Etruria, because there had been some k- feeling between Pompey and Crassus. Caesar not oky brought about a reconciliation, but, to thwart Domitius, got them to offer themselves as cankdates for the conskskp of B.C. 55, and to promise him to make the regkations for the provinces which were noticed above, and wkch were effected by the laws of the tribune Trebokus. Pompey at the same time tried to with draw the attention of the people from the schemes of the tkee confederates, by bulking and inauguratkg a stone theatre, the first that was ever erected at Eome,2 and by public games and festivities of every description. Julia, the daughter of Caesar, who was married to Pompey, was during her lifetime a strong bond of ukon between the two, and any outbreak of hostilities wokd 2 Dion Cass. xxxix. 38 Plut. Pomp. 52."], [505, "485 DEFEAT OF CRASSUS. perhaps have been prevented by her influence ; but in B.C. 54 she died in child-bed, and her infant survived her oky a few days. Tks event rent the tie between Caesar and Pompey completely asunder, and jealousy on the part of Pompey manifested itself but too soon afterwards. Crassus, shortly before the expiration of ks conskskp, in B.C. 55, went to ks provkce of Syria ; and with the hope of sati ating ks avarice with the treasures of Asia, he prepared for war against the Partkans. He plundered wherever he went, and from the temple of Jerusalem alone took 2000 talents. After havkg spent the winter k Syria, he crossed the Eupkates, m B.C. 54, and entered Mesopotamia. As he had no knowledge of the country, and was obliged to trust to gkdes, he allowed himself and his army to be led by a crafty Arabian ckef of the name of Abgarus kto one of the sandy plaks of Mesopotamia. He there found kmself in a most dangerous position and was attacked by the Partkans. Havkg sustained considerable loss, he withdrew to Carrhae, but there agak he was surrounded by the enemy. During an interview with the Parthian commander, into wkch he suffered himself to be cajoled, he was on the point of bekg taken prisoner when, m ks attempt to escape, he fell by an unknown hand, and ks son, who displayed the utmost gal lantry on that occasion, was cut down almost before ks father's eyes. Tks sad catastrophe took place k B.C. 53 : the whole Boman army was nearly ankhilated, for 20,000 are said to have lost their rives in that expedition, and 10,000, with the Boman camp, fell into the hands of the Parthian conquerors. Their king Orodes, to whom the head of Crassus was afterwards brought, caused it to be filled with melted gold, saying, \" Sate thyself now with that metal of wkch in rife thou wert so greedy.\" Only a small portion of the Boman army, under C. Cassius Lon ginus, escaped to Syria ; but the Parthian war was not brought to a close till B.C. 51, when Bibkus was proconsk of Syria. By the death of Crassus, the triumvirate was changed into a duumvirate ; but as the friendskp wkch had existed between"], [506, "486 HISTORY OF ROME. Pompey and Caesar began to cool immediately after the death of Julia, many a one must have foreseen that, sooner or later, matters wokd come to a crisis between the two. Pompey spent most of ks time at Eome, and carried on the administration of his provkce of Spain tkough ks legates, whereby he kd not risk his military reputation, while at the same time he kept up an army ready to obey ks commands. The princely manner in wkch he rived, with ks obvious endeavours to place kmself as kctator at the head of the republic, filled many of the intelligent citizens with fear and jekousy : Cato publicly denounced his unconstitutional powers and ambitious schemes. The optimates, as a body, however, clung to km, believing km to be the oky safeguard against Caesar. The conskar elections, in b.c 53, were delayed for a long time by the riots of Clokus and his opponents ; and in the end, as every one feared lest Pompey shokd become dictator, Cato himself recommended that he shokd be made sole consk, in order to restore peace and order in the republic. Towards the end of February, b.c 52, Pompey entered upon his third conskskp without a colleague, and remained sole consk for five months, after wkch he chose Q. Metellus Scipio, his father-k-law, for ks colleague, probably for no other reason than to allay apprehensions and make the people believe that he was anxious to uphold the republican constitution. The aristo cracy agkn began therefore to consider Pompey as their leader, and to look forward with greater apprehensions than ever to the expiration of Caesar's proconskskp of Gak. But Pompey, who was not yet prepared opeky to break with ks rival, got a law passed by wkch Caesar was to be allowed to become a candidate for the conskskp without coming to Bome in person. Tkngs, however, assumed more and more a defikte aspect. In b.c 51, the consk, M. Clauffius Marcellus, a violent aristocrat, proposed to send a successor to Caesar m Gak, and to deprive him of the privilege wkch Pompey had secured for him. Mar cellus, in fact, lost no opportukty of mskting Caesar. The senatorial party seemed, for the year B.C. 50, the election of"], [507, "PROCEEDINGS AT ROME. 487 L. Aemilius Paulus, and C. Claudius Marcellus, to the conskship, and of C. Curio to the tribuneskp : all these were believed to be the most devoted partisans of Pompey and the senate, and it was hoped that with then aid Pompey would adopt some ener getic measure against Caesar. But the latter contrived, by enormous bribes, to gain over to ks side the consul Aemilius Pakus, and the bold and eloquent tribune C. Curio ; and with an unsparing hand he distributed large sums of money among the leading men at Bome. What alarmed the aristocracy most was the fear lest Caesar shokd be elected consk while he was absent at the head of his legions : in order to prevent tks, the consk, C. Marceilus, proposed in the senate that Caesar should be compelled to lay down his command before the end of the year, B.C. 50. But tks was unreasonable, as ks command ought to last till the end of B.C. 49, and Caesar's life wokd not have been safe if he had ventured to come to Bome as a private person : Curio, however, kterposed ks veto, and rendered the proposal of Marcellus powerless. In the spring of B.C. 50, Caesar came to Cisalpine Gak, where he was received in all the towns with the greatest applause and enthusiasm. He then returned across the Alps to muster all the troops he had at ks command; but at the request of the senate he gave up two legions, wkch were said to be wanted for the Parthian war, though he well knew that it was only to weaken ks power, and that they wokd probably be employed against himself. Having placed his eight remaining legions in winter quarters in Transalpke Gak, he himself returned to the north of Italy with a very small part of ks forces, intending to spend the winter at Eavenna, not far from the frontier of his province of Cisalpine Gak. Though he knew the hostrie intentions of the aristocracy, he addressed a letter to the senate, expressing his readkess to disband his army if Pompey wokd do the same ; but it was with the greatest diffickty that the senate allowed even the letter to be read; and on the motion of Scipio, Pompey's father-in-law, a decree was passed peremp-"], [508, "488 HISTORY OF ROME. torily commankng Caesar by a certain day to ksband ks army, and declaring km a public enemy if he shokd refuse to obey. Two tribunes, M. Antokus and Q. Cassius, opposed the decree, but in vain ; and as it was evident that Pompey was now resolved to crush Caesar if he cokd, they fled m ffisgkse to Caesar, and called upon him to protect the inviolable persons of the tribunes. This was the decisive moment. The senate ordered the magis trates at Eome to provide for the safety of the republic ; they then entrusted to Pompey the whole management of the war, desired km to levy troops, and placed large sums of money at ks disposal. Pompey all kong had no apprehensions ; he thought it impossible that Caesar shokd ever march against km ; he trusted to his great fame, and fancied that at ks ffi-st call all Italy would flock around km. Every precaution, therefore, was neglected ; and the oky military force which Pompey had in Italy were the two legions wkch Caesar had sent from Gak. Pompey and the aristocracy had further indkged in the idle belief that Caesar's troops were worn out by their long fatigues, and were ready to desert their leader on the fo-st opportukty. But the senatorial party had so much miscalckated the sympatkes of the Italians, that it was found very diffickt to raise an army, and the soldiers that were enlisted were resolved to pass over to Caesar as soon as possible. Every tkng was thus in a state of the greatest cokusion, when the tidings came that Caesar was approaching. Bompey himself being qkte bewildered, was ad vised by Cicero to negotiate with Caesar, but the folly and presumption of the senatorial party wokd not hear of any such tkng, and the storm wkch had long been gatherkg burst forth with irresistible fury."], [509, "489 CHAPTEE XXXIV. CIVIL WAR BETWEEN CAESAR AND POMPEY. BATTLE OF PHARSALUS AND POMPEY'S FLIGHT AND DEATH. THE ALEXANDRINE WAR. \u2014 WAR AGAINST PIIARNACES AND CAESAR'S RETURN TO ITALY. When Caesar was kformed of the last decree of the senate, and when the tribunes arrived at Eavenna to implore ks protec tion, he assembled Iris soldiers and called upon them to remain faithful to him : as they declared themselves ready to follow him wkthersoever he might lead them, he marched towards the little river Eubicon, wkch formed the boundary between his pro vkce of Cisalpke Gak and Itky, and wkch, without the per mission of the senate, no generk was allowed to cross with an army. When he arrived on its banks, he hesitated for a time whether he shokd sacrifice kmself, or commit the kegal act : he then called out, \" The ke is cast,\" and crossed the river with oky one legion. His other troops were still k Trans alpine Gak, but had received orders to follow km. He had indeed reason to hasten, as it was necessary for him to prevent ks enemies from completing the preparations they were makng. But ks popkarity was so great that the towns of Ariminum, Pisanum, Ancona, Iguvium, and Auximum, opened then gates to him as soon as he appeared, and ks progress was like a triumph. At Bome every one was in the utmost consternation, and Pompey was at a loss what to do, for he had confidently expected that all Caesar's troops wokd desert their leader and flock to ks standard, and with his few and unsoldierly recraits he was unable to maintain kmself in Eome. He therefore quitted the city in the evekng, without even takng with km the money from the public treasury, and at ks bidding the consks, y 3"], [510, "490 HISTORY OF ROME. senators, and other men of rank and distinction followed km. He fost went to Capua, and thence to Brundusium, from whence he intended to proceed to Greece. Tks disgracefk flight produced the greatest cokusion and despondency among those who cokd not leave the city, for on the one hand they were de nounced as partisans of Caesar and tkeatened with all possible punishments by Pompey, while, on the other hand, they antici pated notkng short of the horrors of the times of Marius and Sulla if Caesar shokd enter the city. Caesar k the meau time contkued ks march towards Corfikum. Tks town was occu pied by a strong garrison under the command of L. Domitius, who had been appointed to succeed Caesar in the adniikstration of Gak. Here again the popkarity of Caesar's cause soon became manifest, for the soldiers deserted Domitius, and went over to Caesar ; and as Pompey did not send any succours, Domi tius bekg unable to mamtam himself, was obliged to surrender at discretion. The moderation and clemency wkch Caesar showed here as well as in other places won for him the hearts of all Itky, and Iris popkarity increased while that of Pompey dimikshed the further he removed from Eome. Pompey reached Brundusium before the arrivk of Caesar, who pursued ks enemy thither, leaving Bome for the present. On the 17th of March Pompey fled from Brundusium to Dyr rhackum, without Caesar bekg able to prevent or follow km, for he had no skps. Cicero, who had accompaked Pompey as far as Brundusium, and who endeavoured to persuade him to nego tiate with ks enemy, remaked m Itky, and was requested by Caesar to keep qket. After the departure of Pompey, all Italy joked Caesar. He now proceeded to Eome, with the mtention of attackkg Afrakus and Petreius, the legates of Pompey in Spam, who had a powerftd army at their command, and might easily transfer the war into Itky. On ks arrival in Eome, he behaved with great mildness, but in every other respect he acted like a sovereign. When he wanted to take the money from the public treasury for his own purposes, the tribune L. Metellus"], [511, "CAESAR IN SPAIN. 491 opposed him ; but Caesar tkeatened to put lrim to death, broke open the treasury, and took what he wanted. After a short stay at Eome, he hastened to the north of Italy, in order to march tkough Gak kto Spam ; wkle some of his friends were left in charge of Bome and Italy ; and others were kspatched to Sicily, Sarknia, Africa, and Ulyricum, to oppose the Pompeians in those parts. When Caesar arrived at Massiria, which was attached to the mterest of Pompey, the citizens of the place refused to admit him ; but he at once laid siege to the town ; and not being able to take it immediately, he left his legates C. Trebokus and D. Brutus, with a part of his army, to continue the siege, and proceeded to Spain. On the approach of Caesar, Afrakus and Petreks united then forces, five legions, in the neighbourhood of Ilerda (Lerida in Catalonia), on the right bank of the river Sicoris (Segre), whilst M. Terentius Varro protected the western part of Spain with two legions. Caesar, who had to contend with great difficulties, suffered severk reverses ; but in the end he reduced his enemies so much that they were compelled to surrender, nearly all their troops having passed over to Caesar. Afrakus and Petreks were ksmissed uknjured, a part of their army was disbanded, and the rest joined the army of the conqueror. After this victory, there was no army in Spam capable of offering any further resistance, and when Caesar arrived at Corduba (Cordova), Varro likewise surrendered. The whole of the Spaksh campaign lasted not longer than forty days, witkn wkch short period all Spain was reduced, and Caesar returned to Gak. Massiria had not yet surrendered, and was still besieged; but soon after Caesar's appearance before its gates, it was compelled to yield ; and Caesar again showed great generosity towards tks city, wkch had been one of the most ancient allies of Eome. During Caesar's Spanish campaign, C. Curio, who had gone to Sicily, took possession of that island, Cato, the praetor, havkg quitted it. Curio then crossed over into Africa, wkch was k the hands of the Pompeian party. There he met with a most determined opposition ; and in a"], [512, "492 HISTORY OF ROME. battle agakst Juba, kng of Numidia, who supported P. Atks Varus, a Pompeian commander, he was defeated and killed. C. Antokus, who had gone to Hlyricum, was as unfortunate as Curio, for ks army was defeated and he himself taken prisoner ; but Q. Valerius, who had been sent kto Sardika, took possession of that island without any opposition. These reverses m Africa and Blyricum, however, were more than counterbkanced by Caesar's own victory in Spain. At the time when Caesar was yet engaged at Massiria, he received mteffigence from Eome that he had been nonrinated dictator by the praetor M. Lepidus. Tks appoktment wkch was illegk, because no praetor had a right to norknate a dictator, had probably been preconcerted between Caesar and Lepidus, as Caesar wished to return to Eome in some kgh officik character. He now hastened to Bome to enter upon ks new office ; but after the conskar elections, and when he himself together with P. Servilius had been appokted consk, he laid down ks kc tatorskp, having held it oky eleven days. This happened in December, B.C. 49. During ks short dictatorskp, Caesar passed several laws wkch were reasonable and skutary. One of them was ckckated to relieve debtors, and at the same time to protect the rights of creditors ; another reversed the sentences passed upon several persons who had been condemned by some laws of Pompey's last conskskp, and severk exiles were accordingly recalled ; the descendants of those who had been proscribed by Sulla were restored to then rights as citizens ; and the khabitants of the country between the Po and the Alps received the Eoman franckse as a reward for then- faithful sup port of Caesar's cause. As the Cisalpine Gaks now acquired the right of wearmg the dress of Eoman citizens (the toga), then country was henceforth called Galria togata. In the mean time ks army returned from Spain, and as soon as new legions were formed, Caesar set out in December, B.C. 49, from Eome for Brundusium, to pursue Pompey. The latter had not been idle during the time that Caesar was engaged in"], [513, "POMPEY IN GREECE. 493 Spam and Itky : he had assembled troops m Greece, and had collected money from all parts, from Asia, Syria, and Egypt, as well as from Greece and Macedoka : and he had a large fleet, which was under the command of M. Bibkus, who had been Caesar's colleague in the conskskp. In the begriming of January, b.c 48, Caesar sailed with seven legions to Epirus, and without meeting any resistance landed near the Ceraunian moimtains. As he had not skps enough to carry over ks troops at once, he had to send the vessels back to fetch the remainder ; but part of them were intercepted on then return by M. Bibkus, who put to death every one on board those wkch fell into ks hands. A portion of Caesar's army was therefore obliged for the present to remain at Brundusium, so that, k point of numbers, ks forces were far inferior to those of Pompey ; but he had confidence in kmself, and knew that he could rely on his men, and he began at once to act on the offensive. He took the towns of Oricum and Apolloka without much difficulty, and then hastened towards Dyrrhachium, where ah Pompey's stores were deposited. But Pompey, who had spent the winter at Thessalokca, and had been ikormed of Caesar's movements, by quick marches reached Dyrrhachium before km. Caesar was greatly in want of the troops detained at Brundusium ; and his impatience became so great, that one stormy kght, it is said, he alone embarked in a boat, and attempted to get across the Adriatic, to see what was the cause of the delay. At last, M. Antony succeeded in eluding the watchfkness of Bibkus, and safely brought over the remainder of Caesar's army. Caesar now proceeded to besiege Pompey at Dyrrhackum ; but as the latter got ks supplies from the sea he was not much affected by it, he showed moreover such great resolution during the siege, that on one occasion Caesar's army was brought into imminent danger. Caesar's solkers began to be desponkng, and he kmself was on the point of giving up all hope of success. The scantiness of provisions, with the epidemic diseases wkch"], [514, "494 HISTORY OF ROME. broke out among ks soldiers, at length kduced him to give up the siege of Dyrrhackum. Had Pompey known how to follow up ks advantages, he might now have brought the struggle to a conclusion. His friends advised him to return to Italy, or to exhaust and destroy his enemy by protracting the war in Epirus, where he might remain in constant commukcation with the sea. But Caesar, unconquered by his reverses, ventured on a step wkch in boldness surpasses every tkng that he had yet done. He marched from Dyrrhachium in the direction towards Thessaly ; a quarter in which he could reckon upon no one, and every inch of ground had to be conquered. Pompey, inflated with ks success and seeing his enemy retreating, now fancied he cokd decide the war by a single blow : he followed Caesar, who pitched ks camp in the neighbourhood of Pharsaks, or Phar salia. When Pompey came up, he with the more sensible of ks friends, was of opikon that they ought to act with great caution, and endeavour to wear out Caesar ; but most of his officers, flushed with then recent victory, insisted upon giving battle immediately. Tks was the very tkng which Caesar desired. Pompey's army was still more than double the number of Caesar's, but the soldiers of the latter were well trained and well ksciplined veterans, whereas those of Pompey were for the most part mexperienced young men. The decisive battle was fought on the knth of August, B.C. 48, in the plain of Pharsaks : Pompey's army was completely defeated ; and soon after ks camp, with all its luxuries, comforts, and treasures, kso fell into the hands of the conqueror. During the battle Caesar had given orders to spare the lives of Eoman citizens as much as possible, and in consequence of this humane command whole regiments passed over to him. The battle of Pharsaks at once decided the fate of Pompey and the republic. Pompey lost all ks corn-age and his senses to boot : he fled from the battle-field to Lesbos, and thence to Cyprus and Egypt, where he had reason to hope he might find"], [515, "495 BATTLE OF PHARSALUS. a favourable reception, smce the father of Ptolemy Dionysus, the present kkg, had been restored to his throne by the ikluence of Pompey. Ptolemy was still very young, and entirely under the control of ks guardians. His father had given directions in ks will that he shokd reign in common with ks sister, Cleopatra ; but she had been obliged to qkt Egypt, and was now attempt ing to effect her return by armed force from Syria. At the time when Pompey approached the Egyptian coast, Ptolemy and ks guardians were encamped in the neighbourhood of mount Casks against Cleopatra. In their camp was a Eoman of the name of Septimks, who had been left beknd in Egypt by A. Gabikus, at the time when he restored the king to his tkone. Tks man now advised the yoimg kng to put Pompey to death, in order to secure the savour of Caesar. Ptolemy gave ks consent ; and Septimks, who went out m a boat to receive Pompey, murdered him on the 28th of September, witkn sight of the kng, and of his army, which was kawn up on the coast. His body, wkch was thrown on the coast, was lest unburiecl. Cornelia, the wife of Pompey, and Sextus ks younger son, who were yet on board the skp, beheld the perpetration of the crime, and took to flight. Three days after tks event, Caesar, accompanied by a small force, arrived in Egypt, wkther he had pursued ks enemy with all possible speed. The Egyptians surrendered to km Pompey's head and rkg, and Caesar is said to have been moved to tears by the sight : ks generous sok was probably affected by the recollection of ks former connekon with Pompey, and by the consideration of the frailty of all human greatness. The body was buried on the coast by one of Pompey's veterans and some freedmen, and a small monument was erected over ks grave. Soon after his arrival in Egypt, Caesar became mvolved in a war (commonly called the Alexandrine war), wkch detained him several months. Cleopatra, by her fascinations, had succeeded in winning the conqueror's heart. Thinkng it necessary that he"], [516, "496 HISTORY OF ROME. shokd interfere with the affairs of Alexandria on her behalf, he demanded the carrying kto effect the will of the late kkg, and that Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy Dionysus shokd reign k common. This demand bekg opposed by the guardians of the young kkg, a war broke out m the city of Alexandria, in which Caesar for some time was exposed to great danger on account of the small number of troops which he had with him. He was besieged in the palace by the populace, and it was oky at the peril of his life that he escaped, by swimming to a skp wkch was lying at anchor in the neighbourhood. His purple robe was hung up by the Egyptians k a temple as a trophy. During tks tumkt the young kng was drowned in the Nde, and ks army dispersed. Caesar in the meantime having received his rekforce ments compelled Alexandria to surrender, and restored Cleo patra to the tkone. He was so completely ensnared by the queen's fascinations and coquetry, that he stayed with her for kne months, though it is stated that he was prevented by contrary winds from saffing away from Alexandria. At length Caesar resolved to tear himself away from the luxuries of the Alexandrine court : having received intelligence that Cn. Domitius Calvinus, one of ks legates, had been defeated by Phamaces, the son of Mitkidates, who was endeavoming to recover the countries wkch his father had once rked over, he broke up from Alexandria m the sprkg of B.C. 47, and marched tkough Syria kto Pontus. This campaign did not detam km long, for on ks arrival in Pontus he immekately attacked the enemy in the neighbourhood of Zela, and the Asiatics were utterly defeated in a moment. It was concerning tks victory over Phamaces, that Caesar sent to Bome the celebrated Laconic report, \" I came, saw, and conquered.\"1 On ks march through Pk-ygia he pardoned Deiotarus, tetrarch of Gkatia, a partisan of Pompey, and he afforded protection to various cities agakst the oppression they were subjected to by the farmers of 1 Veni, vidi, vici; Sueton.

CAESAR'S CON DUCT AS A RULER HIS DEATH. When the news of the battle of Pharskus reached Eome the enthusiasm was so great that immediately several laws were passed to testify to Caesar the gratitude and admiration of the Eoman people, and the powers which the senate conferred upon him made him in reality the sovereign of the republic. He was nomkated kctator a second trine in ks absence, and that for a whole year. He received tks intelligence and entered upon his kctatorskp in September, b.c 48, when he made M, Antony his master of the horse, who forthwith went to Italy for the pur pose of maintaining order there. Caesar was further appointed consk for the next five years, though he did not avail kmself of this honour, and was invested with the power of tribune of the people for life. He had kso cokerred upon him the right of presiding at all the elections of magistrates, except the tribunes. As he was absent from Eome, no magistrates were elected for the year B.C. 47, except the tribunes. The senate and people thus rivalled each other in showing their servility towards Caesar, and in conferring upon him the most extravagant distinctions ; but it may be urged in their excuse, that their admiration was raised to the highest pitch by the unexpected and unexampled mildness wkch he showed towards ks conquered enemies. The long period between the battle of Pharsaks and Caesar's return to Bome had been actively employed by the friends and partisans of Pompey in collecting their scattered forces. After"], [519, "PROCEEDINGS AT ROME. 499 the battle, Cato went to Cyrene, where he gathered around km all the Eomans he cokd, whom he led kong the north coast of Libya kto the provkce of Africa, where he joked the other leaders of the Pompeian party, Q. Metellus Scipio, Pompey's father-in-law, and Afrakus and Petreks. Cato undertook the command of Utica. The Pompeians were allied with Juba, kng of Numidia : they had a large army at then command, and were qkte prepared to meet their enemy. But Bocchus, kkg of Mauritaka, with a number of Boman adventurers who were resid mg in ks kingdom, and were formed into a regkar army by one P. Sittius, declared k favour of Caesar, wkch greatly facili tated ks proceedmgs when he arrived m Africa. On Caesar's return to Bome, in September, B.C. 47, he found tkngs in the greatest confusion. Disturbances had broken out there, in consequence of disputes between M. Antony and P. Cornelius Dolabella, the son-in-law of Cicero, a person who bade fair to become a second Clodius or Catirine. Antony was a man of talent and energy, but passionate and audacious in the kghest degree. Dolabella had contracted enormous debts, and in order to obtak the means of gettkg out of ks diffickties he contrived to become tribune for B.c 48. He now brought forward two monstrous rogations, one of wkch was intended to cancel all debts, the other to reduce all house-rent. Antony had at first supported Dolabella, but when he was informed that there existed a secret understandkg between ks own wife and Dolabella, he turned against km. Some of Dolabella's colleagues likewise opposed ks rogations, and bloody scenes took place at Eome between the two parties which had been thus formed ; but when the rogations were put to the vote Dolabella was defeated. The quarrels and riots, notwithstankng, continued untri the ar rival of Caesar, who restored peace and order. He was greatly kssatisfied with Dolabella's conduct, but did not think it prudent to take km to account. All he cokd do was to remove km from Eome, by taking him with him soon after to Africa. A mutiny had also broken out in one of the legions stationed at Capua,"], [520, "500 HISTORY OF ROME. wkch affair might have become very serious, had not Caesar suc ceeded m quelring the insurrection. After the settlement of these tkngs, he caused kmself to be nominated kctator for another year, and made M. Aemilius Lepidus ks master of the horse. The property of Pompey and of some of ks friends was confiscated and publicly sold. In order to have an opportukty of rewarding the services of his own friends, Caesar increased the number of praetors to sixteen, that of the quaestors to forty, that of the aediles to six : he also enlarged the colleges of priests. Finally, a great number of ks friends and partisans were introduced kto the senate. Having caused kmself and Lepidus to be elected consks for the year following, he made preparations for ks African campaign. The whole of ks stay at Eome, on tks occasion, embraces no more than the short period of two or tkee months. At the beginning of the year B.C. 46, Caesar arrived k Africa, and forthwith began the war agakst the Pompeian party. They were k affiance, as we have aheady observed, with kng Juba, and then army was far more numerous than that wkch Caesar cokd oppose to them ; but he was not a man to be alarmed by ksparity of numbers. At fost he was m considerable dif ficulties, but when his reinforcements arrived he was enabled to carry on the war with great vigour, until it was decided, in the begkkng of April, by the battle of Thapsus, in wkch the Pompeian party was completely defeated. Juba was obliged to quit ks kkgdom, and he and Petreks afterwards kked each other. Cato, who had the command of Utica, findkg himself unable to maintkn the place, prevailed upon the mhabitants to surrender to Caesar ; but before the gates were tkown open, he put an end to his own life, to save himself the pkn of surviv ing the fall of the republic. He died the death of a hero and a philosopher. Although the state of tkngs he longed for had passed away and was irrecoverable, still he deserves our admira tion ; for among all the Pompeians there was not a man so skcere and honest as Cato. After the surrender of Utica, all the"], [521, "501 CAESAR'S TRIUMPH. other towns of Africa likewise opened then gates. Scipio took to flight, and after having had a hard struggle at sea with the fleet of the enemy was at last drowned. All the champions of the Pompeian party had now perished, partly k battles and partly by then own hands. The two sons of Pompey, Cneius and Sextus, had alone escaped from Africa kto Spain, where some time after they stirred up a fresh war. Numidia was made a Boman province, and Crispus Sallustius, one of Caesar's par tisans, was entrusted with its admikstration. He there amassed enormous riches, in the enjoyment of wkch he spent the latter years of ks life, riving retried from public rife, and devotkg ks time to the composition of kstorical works, two of wkch we stk admire as most masterly compositions. Caesar, who was now sole master of the whole Boman world, returned to Bome by the latter end of Jky. As he approached the city, the greatest apprehensions prevailed lest, notwith standing ks former clemency, he might imitate the examples of Marius and Sulla. But these fears were perfectly groundless, for revenge and cruelty formed no part of Caesar's character : with a magnanimity rarely to be met with k conquerors, and least of all in civil wars, he not oky proclaimed a general am nesty, but declared that he shokd make no difference between Pompeians and Caesarians, for ks object now was to allay all animosities, and to secure the lives and property of the citi zens. Before he arrived at Bome, the senate, after receiving mteffigence of Caesar's African victory, hastened to decree a public thanksgivkg of forty days ; to coker upon km the dic tatorskp for ten years, and the censorskp, under the new title of praefectura morum, for tkee years ; and to erect a statue to him in the Capitol. Havkg now overcome allks enemies, he avaded kmself of the general peace wkch was prevailing to celebrate ks four triumphs, one over Gak, the second over Egypt, the third over Pontus, and the fourth over Juba. In order not to hurt their feelings, those Eomans whom he had conquered in the civil wars were not mentioned as the subject of his triumphs. These"], [522, "502 HISTORY OF ROME. triumphs were followed by largesses of corn and money to the people and the soldiers, by public banquets and all kinds of en tertainments, amid wkch the thoughtless multitude easily forgot the loss of liberty : all they cared for was to be well fed and amused. Caesar's next care was directed towards the improvement of the law. By some severe enactments agakst indkgence in luxuries, he endeavoured to restrain the reckess extravagance wkch pervaded all classes of society. As he kmself knew too well the consequences to which a prolonged admikstration of a province might lead, he carried a law ordaikng that no praetor shokd have the admkistration of a province longer than one year, and no consul longer than two. But the most important of all his regulations was the reformation of the Eoman calendar, for tks was a benefit not only to his own country, but to the whole of the civilised world. He undertook tks task in ks cha racter of pontifex maximus, and was assisted in it by the Greek mathematician Sosigenes of Alexandria, and by M. Flavius. The management of the calendar had always been in the hands of the pontiffs, who were accustomed to lengthen or shorten the year as they pleased for political purposes, and the cokusion had then become so great, that the Eoman year was tkee months in advance of the real time. Caesar added irinety days to the year B.C. 46, which was thus made to consist of 445 days; he provided at the same time against the repetition of such cokusion, and made regkations that in future the duration of the year shokd be strictly adapted to the course of the sun. While Caesar was engaged in these peacefk and usefk occu pations he received intelligence of a formidable insurrection wkch had broken out in Spain. Pompey's sons, Cneius and Sextus, who had escaped from Africa, had collected in Spain the remnants of the Pompeian army. They were joked by others, and soon the whole of southern Spain was in arms, though there was little agreement among the several towns as to how the war shokd be carried on. It was the last struggle of the Pompeian"], [523, "503 THE SONS OF POMPEY. party, but it was the most obstinate and desperate of all : they fought like lions, for they well knew that they must either con quer or die. Caesar's good fortune, however, did not forsake him. Towards the end of B.C. 46, he set out for Spain, and, with his usual qkekness, arrived in the neighbourhood of Cor duba k twenty-seven days after leaving Eome. His enemies had taken up a very favourable position, and were able to offer a stronger opposition than he cokd have anticipated ; but the war was brought to a close k the bloody battle of Munda, on the 17th of March, B.C. 45. He entirely defeated his enemies, but not without the greatest efforts and dangers ; for ks troops were aheady retreating, and Caesar kmself is said to have been so desponkng that he thought of makng away with himself. But he rallied, threw himself in the way of his fugitive soldiers, and thus stayed their fright. He destroyed the several detachments of the hostrie army one by one, in the act of then dispersion, for they were resolved not to accept his pardon. Cneius fled with the rest to Carteia, where he embarked. But in entering the ship he got entangled k a rope, and one of ks compakons, who endeavoured to cut the rope tkough, wounded him in the foot. Cneius returned to the shore to have his wound cured before sailing away, but he was overtaken and cut down. His brother Sextus escaped into the country of the Celtiberians, where he led a sort of robber's rife, till after the death of Caesar when he came forward again. Notwithstanding the decisive victory of Munda, Caesar was detained in Spain for several months, partly by the pursuit of the severk detachments of ks enemies, and partly by the regulations wkch he had to make in the province after its pacifi cation. He was thus unable to return to Eome before October. When he arrived in the city, he celebrated ks victory over the Pompeians in Spain, although it was a victory over Eoman citizens, for he now was no longer scrupkous about such matters, but many of the Eomans must have felt the difference between tks and ks former triumphs. The senators, however, received the conqueror with the most abject flattery and servility, and all"], [524, "504 HISTORY OF ROME. seemed to vie with one another in paykg him every species of adkation and homage. Even before ks arrival k the city, a public thanksgiving of kty days had been decreed in ks honour; and after ks triumph, distkctions were literally showered upon him : he received the privilege of wearing the triumphal robe on all public occasions, with the title of \" father of ks country ;\" the month of Quintilis, in wkch he was born, was called after km, Julius (Jky) ; ks statues were placed in all the temples, and he himself was ranked with the gods. Of a more substantial form were the decrees by wkch the powers he had gradually acquired were legally sanctioned and secured to him for life ; for he received the title of imperator for life, was appokted consk for the next ten years, and both dictator and praefectus morum for life : he obtaked the powers of a tribune, ks person was declared sacred and kviolable, and the whole senate promised by an oath to watch over his safety. Half the magistracies were now in his gift, and for the other hah0 he recommended the can didates : the tribunes alone contmued to be elected by the people. Caesar was, in fact, the acknowledged sovereign of the Eoman world; but he was withal in the sad predicament of a tyrant; he was an usurper of the supreme power in a republic : he had ac cordingly to maintak not oky his ascendancy, which anyone might have disputed with km, but to establish his right to govern, and his qualification for it. The state of Italy and the provinces was such, that he could not possibly introduce any materik improve ment, of which he seems to have been well aware kmself, for among all ks regkations and reforms there is no attempt to remedy the evils of the constitution : he seems at least to have been convinced, that he must k-st place ks sovereign power on a sure basis, before he cokd venture upon any great constitutional reform. But what he actually did was, on the whole, for the good of the state ; and there certaiky was no man living who had more good will, energy, and ability, to benefit the state than Caesar. His usurpation, moreover, differs from that of other usurpers in this, that the republic was in reality gone long"], [525, "CAESAR'S ADMINISTRATION. 505 before he set himself up as a rker : he did not upset the republic, but found it aheady a WTeck, of wkch he endeavoured to save as much as possible. The time wkch intervened between Caesar's victory over the sons of Pompey and ks assassmation was too short to allow him to exkbit all ks powers and quarifications ; but from the little he effected, we may form some idea of what he wokd have accomplished if his life had been spared. He still continued as before to pursue his mercifk course, and no proscriptions or executions were resorted to. He formed vast plans of improve ment m wkch he might occupy kmself, for he had been accustomed for many years to the most restless activity, and cokd not have existed without it. He mtended to frame a complete code of laws, to established public libraries, to dram the Pomptine marshes, to ekarge the harbour of Ostia, to cut a canal tkough the Isthmus of Corkth, and to execute a variety of other under takkgs, wkch wokd have been of the kghest utility. It was unfortunate that, k order to reward ks veterans, he shokd have imitated the example of Sulla, and established military colonies in Gak, Italy, and Africa, in consequence of which the children of the Sullakan coloksts were in many kstances driven from their homes ; Corinth and Carthage were likewise to be newly coloksed. But Caesar's mak object was to increase and secure the Eoman dominion in the east, and to take vengeance for the legions of Crassus wkch lay buried there, for wkch purpose he planned an expedition agakst the Partkans. He further contemplated waging war agakst the Tkacians and Scytkans on the Danube. Amidst preparations for these comprehensive schemes, he entered on ks kth consulskp in B.C. 44, M. Antony bekg ks colleague, and M. Lepidus ks master of the horse. Caesar had for some time past been maturing a plan for preserving the sove reignty in ks own family; and as he had no legitimate children, he fixed upon ks great-nephew, M. Octavius (afterwards the emperor Augustus), to be ks successor, whom he accordingly adopted as ks son. He was further anxious to add to ks own regal z"], [526, "506 HISTORY OF ROME. power the title of kng, as an outward legalisation of his power j and a plan was accordingly formed with M. Antony, who was to offer him the diadem, during the celebration of the Lupercalia, on the 15th of February. When the day came, Antony's proposal was not received so favourably as had been anticipated, where fore Caesar for the present declined the honour, hoping for another more favourable opportunity, for how strongly he was bent upon having the regk title became evident soon after. Antony havkg caused a statue of Caesar to be crowned, two tribunes ordered the crown to be taken away, which gave such offence to the dictator, that he was on the point of having them put to death, and it was oky with diffickty that he was prevailed upon to be satisfied with their being sent kto exile. Such occurrences as these showed that there were some men at Eome who still cherished a repub lican feeling, and were prepared to resist any formal abolition of the republic to the last. It is however to be regretted that Caesar's scheme was not carried into effect : the Eoman people wokd have been saved mfikte misery; the monarchy would have become an hereditary and not an elective one ; and it cokd never have fallen into the hands of an ksolent and rapacious soldiery, who in the end went so far as to sell the imperial throne to the kghest bidder. In the mean time a conspiracy had been formed against the life of Caesar from the very begimring of the year B.C. 44. It was headed by C. Cassius Longinus and M. Brutus, and upwards of sixty persons were privy to it. Brutus was a nephew of Cato, from whom he had imbibed ks republican sentiments : he had received an excellent education, and possessed very great talent, which gained for him the esteem and friendskp of both Cicero and Caesar. In the battle of Pharsaks, Brutus fought in the ranks of Pompey, but immediately after ks victory Caesar pardoned km, had since placed the greatest confidence in km, and continued to distingksh him on every occasion. But with Brutus a sincere love of freedom outweighed every other consi deration, and he seems to have really believed that by the death"], [527, "MURDER OF CAESAR. 507 of Caesar a service would be done to a good cause, and the republic cokd even be revived. The other conspirators were mostly actuated by mere personal hatred and akmosity ; and republican liberty with them was only a name under the cover of which they hoped to take revenge for wounded pride and disappointment. A strlkng example of tks class among the conspirators was Cassius. He too had belonged to the Pompeian party, and had been pardoned by Caesar. He had been a candidate for the praetorskp for the year B.C. 44, and hoped to obtain the city praetorskp ; but when Caesar gave that office to Brutus, Cassius became indignant agakst Brutus as well as Caesar, and resolved to take vengeance : it was Cassius that contrived to gkn over Brutus to join the conspirators. Caesar was cautioned in time, and advised to take a body-guard, but he magnanimously declined it, saying that he would rather not rive at all, than be for ever in fear of losing ks rife. M. Antony was likewise pro posed to be assassinated, and much misery wokd have been pre vented if he too had been sacrkced, but Brutus thought that the death of Caesar wokd be sufficient, and Antony was accordingly spared. The republicans, for thus the conspirators styled themselves, were resolved to take the first opportukty of despatckng Caesar ; and as it usually happens under such circumstances, they were so bent upon destroying the object of their antipathy that they did not consider what was to take its place, so that the execution of then design was immediately followed by the utmost cokusion and perplexity. Some of the troops that were to serve in the Partkan war had aheady been sent to Brundusium, but when the Sibylline books were conskted it was found that the Partkans cokd be conquered only by a kng. A meeting of the senate was therefore announced for the 15th of March, at wkch a proposal was to be made to appoint Caesar kng out of Italy. That day was fixed upon by the conspirators as a most favourable opportukty for carrying out their design. The meetmg of the senate took place in the curia of Pompey. Caesar had been z2"], [528, "508 HISTORY OF ROME. advised to be on ks guard on the 15th; and on the very morning of that day ks wife, who had been frightened by a dream, en treated km to remain at home. But he disregarded all warkngs, and went to the curia, where the conspirators were waitmg fol ks arrivk. On ks way tkther some one handed him a letter, in which the plot was reveked, but Caesar did not stop to read it. When he arrived in the senate, one Tiffius Ckiber made ks way up to him, feigkng to approach him as a suppliant, and took hold of ks toga. At that moment Casca gave him the kst stroke with ks sword; and he was followed by others who wounded him m the face, the side, the loins, and neck. Caesar, who had sprung from ks seat, at first defended himself with the utmost determkation, but when Brutus also struck him, he wrapped ks toga about himself and sank dowm k ks blood. His body was covered with twenty-tkee wounds. At the time of his death Caesar was oky in his fifty-sixth year. The senators dispersed m dismay, without ristekng to the call of Brutus to pronounce judgment upon the deed at once. The conspirators left the body lying k the senate-house, and with the bloody swords in then hands hastened out kto the streets to proclaim ' he death of the tyrant and the restoration of liberty. The death of Caesar was an irreparable loss not only to the Eoman people but to the whole of the civilised world, for the republic was utterly lost, and no earthly power cokd restore it. Caesar's death involved the state k fresh struggles, and civil wars for many a year, until m the end it fell agak \u2014 and this was the best that under the circumstances cokd have hap pened to it \u2014 under the supremacy of Augustus, who had neither the talent, nor the will, nor the power, to carry out all the beneficial plans wkch ks great-uncle had laid out. It has been trky said, that the murder of Caesar was the most senseless act the Eomans ever committed. Had it been possible at all to restore the republic, it wokd unavoidably have fallen into the hands of a most profligate aristocracy, who wokd have sought nothing but their ow-n aggrandisement, who wokd have demo-"], [529, "MURDER OF CAESAR. 509 rarised the people still more, and wokd have established their own greatness upon the mins of their country. It is oky necessary to recoriect the latter years of the republic, the depravity anil corruption of the ruling class, the scenes of violence and blood shed which constantly occurred in the streets of Eome, to render it evident to every one that peace and security could not be restored, except by the strong hand of a sovereign; and the Eoman world wokd have been indeed fortunate if it had sub mitted to the mild and beneficent sway of Caesar."], [530, "510 CHAPTEE XXXVI. STATE OF ROME AFTER THE MURDER OF CAESAR. \u2014 OCTAVIANUS AND HIS RELATION TO ANTONY. THE WAR OF MUTINA. TRIUMVIRATE OF OCTAVI ANUS, ANTONY, AND LEPIDUS, WITH THEIR PROSCRIPTIONS. DEATH OF CICERO. The murder of Caesar tkew the city of Eome into the greatest confusion and consternation. The conspirators met with no sympathy either k the senate or among the people : the latter had before expressed themselves strongly against Caesar, espe cially after the exile of the two tribunes who had taken away the kadem from Caesar's statue ; but all then- grievances were now forgotten, and the awfk deed inspired them with hatred of the murderers. When therefore the latter, accompaked by a band of gladiators, passed tkough the streets, proclaiming that they had killed a kng and a tyrant, and calling upon all to kd them m restoring the republican constitution, they clearly saw that public opikon was against them, and withdrew to the Capitol. Cicero was one of the few who at once declared kmself m favour of the murderers : most of the senators and Antony went home, to shut themselves up in then houses and make preparations for defending themselves in case they shokd be attacked. In the kght, from the 15th to the 16th of March, the conspirators remained in the Capitol, while Antony went to Caesar's house and took possession of all the money and papers of the deceased. The fear and confusion of the widow allowed him to act as he pleased ; and he, who had already resolved to take the place and follow in the footsteps of Caesar, had thus an immense advantage"], [531, "511 STATE OF ROME AFTER CAESAR'S DEATH. over the murderers, which was further increased by ks appro priatkg to himself kso the contents of the public treasury. The next day Brutus came down from the Capitol, and addressed the people. The conspirators had hired a number of persons, who k the name of the people called out for peace and reconciliation, that is, for impunity to the conspirators. A few responded to the call, but the mktitude remained dumb ; and the murderers had now the positive certainty that their cause was not a popkar one. They had reason to fear on every hand ; for, in the night, M. Lepidus, who had been stationed with an army near the city, entered the gates, either with a view of avenging the murder of Caesar, and supportmg Antony, or of placing himself at the head of the state. The conspirators began therefore to negotiate with Antony and Lepidus about the restoration of peace, and the means of averting the impending danger. Antony sent them an evasive answer, and referred them to the senate. On the 17th a meeting of the senate was held k the temple of Tellus, but the murderers did not appear. Antony, with the greatest apparent moderation, had most cunkngly contrived to ffiscover the weak points of the friends of the murderers, and seekg that they themselves were not agreed as to the course to be pursued, and that an attack from without wokd defeat them altogether, he hastened with Lepidus to the forum, where they mtimated to the people that no one's rife was safe. Many therefore im mediately called upon them to avenge the murder of the dictator ; but a far greater number demanded the maintenance of peace, havkg been bribed by the murderers, and promised by them that they shokd receive all that Caesar had bequeathed to them k ks will. Antony's plan thus failing, he returned to the senate, where a decree was soon after made, that no judicik investigation shokd be instituted against the murderers ; yet that all the acts and regkations of Caesar shokd remak in force and be valid, that the wishes and regkations contained in his will shokd be adhered to, and that ks body shokd be buried at the public expense. This decree was the result of the exertions"], [532, "512 HISTORY OF ROME. of Caesar's friends, who were backed by the veterans and a large portion of the popkace. Wkle these tkngs were going on k the senate, Brutus and Cassius assembled the people on the Capitol, and made the most extravagant promises to win the solkers ; but all that they cokd gain, who claimed to be the liberators of their country, was tole ration, for there was no one that praised their action as an heroic deed. On the evekng of the 17th the murderers came down from the Capitol -. Antony and Lepidus pretended to be perfectly reconciled, and even invited Brutus and Cassius to then houses. All disputes seemed at an end, and on the following day the murderers once more appeared m the senate. Although the regkations of Caesar, accortring to wkch M. Brutus was to have Macedoka and Cassius Syria as ks provkce, had been sanctioned, yet the senate now decreed to them Crete and Cyrene as then- provkces. But when the body of Caesar was to be buried, and was earned, as was usual under such circumstances, to the forum, that the funeral oration might be delivered over it, Antony, who undertook to perform this last office to the illustrious dead, resolved to exert all ks powers to stir up the people against ks murderers. His speech produced a powerful effect ; and after he had dwelt upon the greatness, virtues, and valour of the de ceased, he lifted up the toga, exhibited to the people the blood stained garment, and pointed to the wounds by wkch then friend had been murdered. The sight filled the mktitude with such a degree of rage and fury, that the body, instead of bekg carried to the Campus Martks where it was to have been buried, was burnt k the forum itself; and some persons present, who though perfectly innocent wrere suspected of havkg been associ ates of the murderers, were literally torn to pieces in the forum. The people then kspersed k all directions, and demolished or burnt the houses of the conspirators. Brutus and Cassius were obliged to fly from Eome, and all their friends likewise made then escape. Decimus Brutus, one of the murderers, went to Cisalpine Gak, wkch had been assigned to him by Caesar as ks"], [533, "513 ANTONY'S PROCEEDINGS. province, and there made the troops take the oath of allegiance to him. When the storm had been raging long enough, Antony resumed his mask and restored peace, but peace was not the tkng wkch he wanted. Being in possession of Caesar's papers, he conducted himself like a despot, pretending that all he did was in accordance with the desires of Caesar, as expressed in his written documents. He contrived to secure the good will of the veterans, forbade Caesar's murderers to return to the city, and in conjunction with Lepidus made a new division of the provinces, different from that which had been made by Caesar himself. He induced the people to give Macedoka to kmself, and Syria to Dolabella, ks friend and colleague in the consulskp. Soon after tks he agak made the people sanction a different arrangement, contrary to the will of the senate, according to wkch he kmself obtained Cis alpine Gak, ks brother, C. Antonius, Macedoka, and Dolabella Syria. With regard to Lepidus, who had received Transalpine Gaul from Caesar, no alteration was made. Tks kstribution was the signal for a fresh civil war, for Cisalpme Gaul cokd not be takeh possession of without expelling D. Brutus from it by force of arms. In tks manner Antony for some months acted in the most arbitrary and insolent manner, as if he had already been the real sovereign of the Eoman world. He was dreaded by all, and no one had a greater aversion to him than Cicero, who had resolved to leave Bome, and accompany ks son-in-law, Dolabella, as legate into ks provkce of Syria, but was prevailed upon by ks friends to return to Eome. The day after ks return, the 1st of September, Antony came opeky forward with ks schemes in the senate, intending to compel every one to declare ks opinions unreservedly, and show to what party he belonged. Cicero did not attend on that day, at wkch Antony was so much enraged, that he tkeatened to have ks house demolished. The day following another meeting of the senate took place, and Cicero now, with all the force of ks eloquence, attacked and laid open the shamefk proceedings of Antony, who, not expecting z 3"], [534, "514 HISTORY OF ROME. such an assakt, was not present at the meeting. The speech wkch Cicero delivered that day is still extant : it forms the fost of a series called the Philippics. In the meantime a formidable rival of Antony came to Eome. M. Octavius, whom Caesar had adopted m ks will, and whom he had made heir of tkee-fom-ths of ks private pro perty, was the son of C. Octavius by Atia, a daughter of Caesar's sister Julia. Some months before ks death Caesar had sent him to Apolloka, from whence he intended to take him with him on ks expedition against the Partkans. When M. Octavius received the kteffigence of the murder of ks great-uncle, he resolved, contrary to the advice of his more cautious friends, to go to Italy, though he was then scarcely kneteen years old. Tks step, under the circumstances, was one of extreme boldness, as he cokd not foresee what wokd be ks fate in the distracted state of the republic. He even decrined the assistance of the troops who were stationed k Ulyricum, and who offered to accompany him and avenge ks great-uncle's death. About two months after the murder of Caesar, he arrived at Bome as a private person, accompaked oky by a few friends. On ks arrivk at Brundu sium he was skirted by the troops as Caesar, for bekg the adopted son of the late dictator, ks name was now C. Julius Caesar Octavianus. When he came to Bome he demanded nothing but the property wkch ks uncle had left him. Tks was rather awkward for Antony, who was m possession of the whole of Caesar's property, and had aheady made use of it k paykg his own enormous debts, and in gratifying ks dissipated habits. He therefore attempted by every means to dissuade and deter Octavianus from acceptmg the inheritance. Octavianus was k a very perplekng situation, for he cokd not possibly jok the party of the murderers of his uncle ; and Antony who pretended to be the avenger of Caesar and the champion of ks party, was the greatest obstacle in ks way. The extraordinary tact and prudence wkch Octavianus displayed in these circumstances, and the dexterity with wkch he contrived to deceive and blind the first"], [535, "OCTAVIANUS. 515 men of the age, show that he must have possessed uncommon mental powers : he was, however, supported and encouraged by the advice of ks friend M. Vipsakus Agrippa. The enmity between Octavianus and Antony soon rose to such a pitch, that reports were spread of attempts havkg been made by each of them to destroy the other. Octavianus, wkle demanding ks kherit ance, promised the people that every tkng shokd be given to them wkch ks uncle had destined for them in ks will. His prudent conduct gamed for him the favour of the senate, as well as of the people ; and Cicero also began to look upon him with confidence as the only man capable of bringing about a better state of tkngs. All Antony's efforts after tks to keep possession of the treasures of Caesar were of no avail, and he was obliged to give up the portion wkch he had not yet spent. Octavianus had before km two enemies, D. Brutus in Cis kpine Gak, aud Antony : the question was, whom shokd he attack first ? Antony was brkgmg troops kto Italy for the purpose of undertaking the war agakst D. Brutus, who was in possession of that province, which Antony had chosen for himself ; at the same time Octavianus was mcreaskg and strengthemng ks own party, and likewise collecting an army in Campaka. Two of the legions that came over from Macedoka for Antony soon after then arrival went over to Octavianus : in order to prevent the others from following their example, Antony hastened with them to the north of Italy. Cicero had become a strong supporter of Octavianus, and in ks Philippics continued to attack Antony. In the end he succeeded k induckg the senate to support even D. Brutus ; for k the month of December he proposed k ks third Philippic to give an army to Octavianus that he might conduct the war against Antony, who was declared a public enemy. On the first of January, B.C. 43, Cicero repeated the proposk ; and the senate now cokerred upon Octavianus the title and ensigns of praetor, and sent him, along with A. Hirtius and C. Vibius Pansa, the two consks of the year, both of them friends of the late dictator, to the north of Italy, to relieve"], [536, "516 HISTORY OF ROME. D. Brutus, who had tkown kmself kto Mutina (Modena) and was besieged by Antony. Several engagements took place with vary ing success. Pansa took up his position at Bonoka (Bologna) ; and as he advanced to join ks colleague and Octavianus, he was attacked by Antony in the village of Forum Galloram, in a defile, when being dangerously wounded he retreated to ks camp, up to wkch Antony pursued him ; but on the next day when Antony returned in order not to be cut off from ks main army about Mutina, he was surprised in the same deke by Hirtks, and suffered so severe a defeat, that he was scarcely able to reach ks camp. Soon after Hirtius attacked him in ks camp, while at the same time D. Brutus made a sally from the town. Hirtius had aheady scked the fortifications, when he was killed by an unknown hand. Antony was so much reduced in this engagement, wkch took place towards the end of April, that he took to flight. The consul Pansa having in the mean time ked at Bonoka, there was a report, perhaps not without some foundation, that Octavianus had caused the death of the two consuls ; for it was said that he had poisoned the wound of Pansa, and that Hirtks had fallen by an assassin whom Octavianus had hired for the purpose. However tks may be, he now undertook the command of the army without waiting for the orders of the senate. But the aristocratic party at Eome were determked to prevent km from acquiring any further power, and soon after assigned the command of the conskar armies to D. Brutus, with orders to prosecute the war agakst Antony. Antony had become quite bewildered by ks defeat : he resolved to qkt Italy, and fled across the Alps into the province of M. Lepidus, who afforded him protection, and whose army saluted km as imperator. As Lepidus had a large force at ks command, Antony soon found kmself k a condition to contmue the war with greater vigour than before. When the decree of the senate, giving the command of the conskar armies to D. Brutus, arrived, Octavianus concealed ks exasperation, and submitted to what he must have considered a very great kdigkty, that one of Caesar's"], [537, "517 THE TRIUMVIRATE. murderers shokd be entrusted with the command of two con skar armies. Afterwards, on ks return to Eome with ks army, he demanded the conskskp for the year following. The aristocracy refused to comply with ks request ; but he carried his pokt by the tiireats of ks veterans, who ksisted on the office for then leader. Q. Pedius, one of ks relatives, was elected ks colleague, and the two entered upon then conskskp in the month of August, B.C. 43. After the legacies of the late dictator had been distributed among the people, Q. Pedius got a law passed by wkch all the murderers of Caesar were declared outlaws, and Octavianus was appokted to carry tks law kto effect. All the accomplices of Brutus and Cassius, who until then felt perfectly secure, now took to flight ; but they were dogged and hunted like wild beasts. Octavianus marched with an army to the north of Italy ; but he had scarcely entered Etruria when the senate, on the proposal of Pedius, repealed the decree of out lawry wkch had been pronounced against Antony and Lepidus, who were at tks very moment descendkg from the Alps kto Itky with an army of seventeen legions. D. Brutus, abandoned and betrayed by his lieutenants, took to flight, and was murdered at Aquileia by the command of Antony. In the neighbourhood of Bonoka, in a small island of the river Bhenus, a cokerence was brought about by Lepidus between Octavianus and Antony, and negotiations were at once entered into. Octavianus dreaded the influence of ks opponents in the city : they even threatened to ally themselves with Brutus and Cassius, who had by this time collected large armies ; but ks fear and cunkng suggested to km the means of thwarting their designs. Towards the end of November, Octavianus, Antony, and Lepidus, entered kto an affiance known under the name of the triumvirate. They assumed the title of triumviri rei publicae comtituendae, and agreed to hold tks office for five years. Hereupon they distributed, on then own authority, the provmces among themselves : Octavianus received Africa, Sicdy, and Sardika; Antony, Gak ; and Lepidus, Spam. Lepidus was at the same time to be invested with the"], [538, "518 HISTORY OF ROME. consulskp, while Octavianus and Antony were to carry on the war agknst Brutus and Cassius. The favour of the rapacious soldiery was obtained by the promise that lands shokd be dis tributed among them. The government of the whole of the Eoman world was thus usurped by the triumvirs. Their kst care was to rid them selves of their opponents: each, \u25a0 therefore, drew up a list of those whom he wished to be proscribed, and whose property was to be confiscated ; each also entered k ks list the names of those persons whom either of the others wished to be proscribed. Antony thus put down the name of L. Caesar, ks own uncle ; Lepidus, that of ks own brother, Paulus ; and Octavianus, to please Antony, is said to have entered the name of Cicero, who up to tks time had acted towards him as a friend. The pro scription in the time of Sulla had been the reskt of an infuri ated party spirit, for Sulla had been provoked in the kghest degree, and he sacrificed ks enemies without any scruple because he really hated them, plunder bekg oky a secondary object ; but with the triumvirs the proscription was dictated by a cold-blooded revenge, and plunder seems, after all, to have been one of the main objects, for many a person who had given no offence to any one was put on the List merely because he was wekthy. When all tks was arranged the triumvirs returned to Eome, wkther dread and horror preceded them. They entered the city without meeting with any resistance. The consk, Q. Pekus, died k the night previous to then arrival. When all quarters of the city and all the public places were occupied by the soldiers, the triumvirs got a tribune to propose to the people to sanction the arrangements they had made, and no sooner was the sanction obtaked, than the lists of the proscribed were distributed among the commanders of the forces stationed m the city. The most mer ciless murder and butchery now commenced in all quarters. A proclamation was issued at the same time, threatening with death any one who shokd concek or protect a proscribed person, and"], [539, "PROSCRIPTIONS. 519 offering freedom as a reward to slaves who shokd kill their pro scribed masters ; nay, the relatives of the murdered were for bidden to show grief at the death of those who were dear to them. Sons betrayed their fathers, and slaves their masters ; but, in some instances, wives, slaves, and freedmen gave the noblest proofs of attachment and fidelity : of a son magnak mously protecting ks father, or sacrkckg himself for km, un fortunately no kstance occurred.1 The acts of horror and mhuman cruelty perpetrated at that time, to wkch revenge, avarice, and malice drove the brutal murderers as they traversed the city k all directions, surpass even the horrors committed in France during the revolution k the days of Bobespierre, Danton, and Marat. The murderers were, for the most part, centurions and tribunes of the soldiers : they usually cut off the heads of then victims, m order to be able to prove their deeds and receive the promised rewards. Two thousand eqktes, and tkee hundred senators were massacred during these days : those who had an opportukty of escapkg fled to Brutus and Cassius, or to Sicily, where they joined Sext. Pompeius, who had aheady made himself master of the island. One of the many victims of the triumvirs was Cicero. When the lists of the proscribed were made public he was resiffing at ks villa, near Tusckum. He was at first undecided what to do, but ks brother Qkntus prevailed upon him to try to escape. He accorffingly went to Astura, where he took a boat and sailed to Caieta, near wkch place he had a villa, m the bay of Naples. Here being unwell he was persuaded to allow himself to be carried k a lectica through a plantation to the sea-coast, k the hope of eludkg ks pursuers, who were known to be close at hand ; but k the plantation he was overtaken by Antony's emissaries. His slaves were ready to fight for then master, but he forbade it ; and as he put forward ks head from the lectica, Popilrius Laenas, whom Cicero is said to have once defended in a court of justice, cut off ks head and right hand, as Antony had desired.

When Antony received the head and hand of Cicero, he was kmost beside himself for joy : he ordered. the head to be put up in the rostra, where Cicero's voice had so often stirred the mul titude, and gave a large sum of money to ks murderers. Antony's wife, Fkvia, had previously ordered the head of her husband's enemy to be brought kto her dressmg-room, that she might feast her eyes on the dead features, and she is said to have pricked his tongue with needles. Cicero's brother, Qkntus, was also murdered ; but ks son Marcus escaped to Greece.

WAR AGAINST BRUTUS AND CASSIUS \u2014WAR OF PERUSIA. \u2014 TREATIES OF BRUNDUSIUM AND M1SENUM. WAR AGAINST SEXTUS POMPEIUS. Immediately after these scenes of horror, Octavianus resolved to attack Sext. Pompeius in Sicily, who had it in ks power to cut off aU supplies of food wkch were destined for Eome ; but a victory gained by Pompeius over Salvidienus Eufus, just as the latter was crosskg over to the island, and that in the very sight of Octavianus, put for the present an end to the undertaking -. and soon after Octavianus and Antony sailed over to Greece, to carry on the war agknst Brutus and Cassius, who had in the meantime established themselves in the east and collected a numerous army.

After the establishment of the tri umvirate he made serious preparations for war. Cassius, in the mean time, fought bravely and successfully against Dolabella k Syria, who was m the end put to death at Laodicea."], [542, "522 HISTORY OF ROME. The two ckefs of the republican party were thus completely masters of all the countries east of the Adriatic. In the begk kng of the year b.c 42, they met at Sardes, m Lydia, where they resolved to ukte their forces agakst then common enemy, but for the sake of kcreasing then means they staid m Asia much longer than they ought to have done. Then most advantageous plan wokd have been to hasten westward, m order to prevent their enemies lankng on the coast of Epirus ; but tks was neglected, and Macedoka and LTyricum were not protected by any troops at all. Under these circumstances Antony and Octavi anus entered Greece, and made themselves masters of the country, before Brutus and Cassius qktted Asia. Just before Brutus crossed the Hellespont to proceed to Macedoka, he sat one kght meditatmg m ks tent, when on a sudden a gigantic figure ap peared before km, and seemed to approach him. Brutus asked him who he was, and what he wanted, whereupon the phantom replied : \" Brutus, I am thy evil spirit : thou wilt see me agak at Pkrippi.\" Brutus answered, \"I will see thee;\" and the vision disappeared. Dark forebodings, in ks own heart, respectkg the issue of the war, seem to have conjured up before ks eyes tks skgkar phantom. The republican army, consisting of 80,000 foot and 20,000 horse, marched tkough Tkace towards Macedoka. Antony and Octavianus had aheady penetrated into that provkce, and had taken up their winter quarters at Ampkpolis. The repub licans pitched their camp on kgh ground in the neighbourhood of the town of Pkrippi. Their fleet, wkch ought to have been near at hand, was in the western seas. Antony advanced agakst them with mneteen legions and 13,000 horse. Brutus and Cas sius had a great advantage in their position, and m the faithfk attachment of then- solkers, for a great many illustrious Eomans and persons of rank who had been proscribed were serving under them, and were resolved to fight to the last. Brutus was cautious, and wanted to defer coming to a decisive engagement, but his army was impatient, and demanded to be led on to battle."], [543, "BATTLES OF PHILIPPE 523 Octavianus was not present, bekg kept away by ilkess, or, as some say, by cowardice ; but ks army, wkch was probably commanded by Agrippa, faced that of Brutus. Cassius, whose army was opposed to that of Antony, was completely beaten ; and, believing that every thkg was lost, he sent a messenger to inquire in what condition the army of Brutus was. The messenger did not come back. Brutus, who was victorious, in the mean time sent reinforcements to Cassius, who, tknkng that they were ks enemies following up their victory, now felt more convinced than ever that all was lost, and requested one of ks servants to take away ks life. When Brutus was informed of tks fatal mistake, he was greatly disheartened; but the victory was not yet decided, and matters still stood almost as they were before the battle. Had Brutus known that on the very day of Cassius' defeat, the republican fleet under the command of Statius Murcus and Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus in the Iokan sea had defeated and burnt the hostile fleet and destroyed two legions, he wokd, accordkg to ks origmal plan, have acted on the defensive ; and by orderkg ks fleet to jok him, he might have compelled the triumvirs to retreat. But he knew notkng of tks, and was obliged to yield to ks soldiers, who demanded another battle. Tks was fought about twenty days after the first. The republican army showed the same valour and ardour as before, but they were nevertheless defeated and routed. Brutus now lost all hopes, and put an end to the war by makng away with himself. As ks servant refused to take away ks life, he tkew kmself upon his own sword. Thus fell the last of the republicans worthy of the name. Many others, whose feerings did not perikt them to survive the fall of the republic, followed his example ; and others fled to Sex. Pompeius, k Sicily. The remakder of the army, wkch was commanded by Messka Cor vinus, surrendered to the triumvirs. Octavianus after tks vic tory showed a cruel and unfeeling disposition in many kstances, whereas Antony, whose better nature seems to have gained the upper hand on that occasion, displayed more generosity"], [544, "524 HISTORY OF ROME. than cokd have been anticipated. There can be no doubt that tks victory was maiky owkig to the valour and boldness of Antony, though Octavianus afterwards claimed the principal merit for himself. After the battles of Pkrippi, wkch were fought in the autumn of the year B.C. 42, Octavianus and Antony made a new division of the provkces, in wkch Lepidus obtained Africa. Antony now proceeded to ks eastern provinces k Asia, while Octavianus returned to Italy, to satisfy ks greedy and rapacious veterans, by distributkg among them the lands wkch he had promised to them, and wkch he cokd get oky by the most arbitrary pro ceedings and by violence. Every one in Italy was seized with alarm lest Octavianus should repeat the horrors of the precedmg year. These apprehensions were secretly fostered and kcreased by Fkvia the wife of Antony, who contrived to spread abroad various reports about the ktentions of Octavianus even before he arrived at Bome, for he was defamed for a time by iffiiess at Brundusium. She made use, in these intrigues, of her husband's brother, L. Antokus. Her oky motive, apparently, was to compel Antony to return to Italy, for she was passionately fond of him, and probably knew or apprehended that he wokd come under the influence of Cleopatra. The distribution of lands among the veterans k Italy, and the establishment of military colonies over all parts of the country, with the disturbances wkch followed m then tram, prevented Octavianus from venturing to undertake any tkng against Sex. Pompeius. The country people, who were expelled from then homes by the rude soldiers, flocked to Eome, and bewailed m private as well as in public then undeserved misfortunes. Then distress met with sympathy in the city, but it was in vam that Octavianus was applied to on every hand to prevent the outrages wkch were committed k all quarters. The impudence and audacity of the veterans in creased every day, and Octavianus kmself was obliged to endure then msolence : he did not dare to pumsh the outrages they committed against their own officers. In addition to all tks"], [545, "WAR OF PERUSIA. 525 Eome was in great distress from scarcity, as the fleet of Sex. Pompeius cut off the supplies of provisions from Sicdy. Tks state of tkngs offered a very favourable opportunity for Fulvia, and L. Antokus, who was consk m b.c 41, to come forward as the protectors of the suffering and the oppressed. They created a commotion, the objects of wkch were to humble the rival of Antony, and to compel Antony himself to return to Italy. Other persons, kso, who had no such impure motives, but were actuated by a genkne feelkg of humakty, joked them, or arose independently k other parts of the country. L. Antokus at first established himself at Praeneste, but afterwards went with Fkvia to Perusia k Etruria, where they were joked by numbers of Antony's veterans, fugitive country-people, and others. Under these diffickt circumstances Octavianus acted with great skill and prudence. Towards the end of the year b.c 41, he marched to Perusia, and blockaded the town with tkee armies. The place soon began to suffer from a severe famine, and severk attempts to break tkough the besieging armies failed. L. An tokus was at length obliged to capitkate. Octavianus havkg granted km pardon, Antokus now acted as a traitor to ks own party. Fkvia was set free on condition of her qktting Itky. The lives of the citizens of Perusia were spared, but all the senators were put to death; and from 300 to 400 noble Perusians were sent as captives to Eome, where they were butchered like cattle on the 15th of March, b.c 40, at the altar of J. Caesar. The town of Perusia was plundered, and changed into a heap of ashes. Thus ended an undertakkg wkch had been begun by two unprincipled persons, whose watchword was protection to the oppressed, but who by their conduct brought greater misery upon a harmless popkation than that wkch they pretended to remedy. Fkvia went to Greece ; and when Antony, who spent his time in Egypt in sensual pleasures and the luxuries of the Alexandrian court, heard of the affair, he blamed the authors of it, though probably for no other reason than because the undertakng had failed. Tib. Claudius Nero,"], [546, "526 HISTORY OF ROME. the husband of Livia, (afterwards the wife of Octavianus,) had been kduced by a generous and humane feeling to come forward in Campaka as the champion of those who were reduced to beg gary by the veterans of Octavianus ; but when the triumvir had conquered the party of Fkvia at Perusia, Tib. Claudius Nero despairing of success fled to Sicily, where he joined Sext. Pom peius, and afterwards went to Antony. After the battles of Pkrippi, Antony went to Asia, where he levied enormous contributions, in order to enable himself to sulk ks promises towards ks soldiers. Asia suffered most severely, Brutus havkg also shortly before levied large sums. The mad and senseless extravagance of Antony became manifest on his arrival at Ephesus, wkch city he entered in the disgkse of Bacchus, surrounded by Bacchantes, Satyrs, Fauns, and the like, and where he indkged k the wildest and most senseless debaucheries. On ks arrival in Ciricia, he summoned Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, to appear before km, because she had in various ways supported Cassius. She obeyed the call without hesitation, for she well knew that the voluptuous Boman wokd not be able to resist her charms. She sailed up the river Cydnus to Tarsus in a vessel adorned in the most splendid manner, and she herself appeared as Venus. Her object was easdy gained, and Antony was completely ensnared. After she had remained with km some time in Asia, Antony accompanied her to Alexandria, where he forgot every tiring in dalliance with her. He abandoned kmself entirely to sensual pleasures and debaucheries, and lost the few remnants of goodness and virtue he yet possessed. In B.C. 40, he was roused by the progress of the Partkans, who were gkded by the counsels of a faitkess Boman, Labienus, formerly one of Caesar's generals, and afterwards a supporter of Pompey. The news that the Partkans had attacked Syria and the neighbouring countries induced Antony to go forth with an army, and undertake the war against them. On ks arrival in Phoenicia, he received the most pressing letters from ks wife, who desired km to hasten to her assistance in Italy. Having"], [547, "TREATY OF BRUNDUSIUM. 527 resolved to comply with her request, he entmsted his army to the brave P. Ventidius, who fought successfully agakst Labienus and the Partkans and recovered Syria. When Antony arrived in Greece, Octavianus had aheady brought the Pemsian war to a close. At Athens Antony met ks wife Fkvia, who soon after died at Sicyon, whereupon he continued ks voyage to Italy, intending to land at Brundusium with a large fleet. While sailing across the Iokan sea, he met with Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, the republican admirk, who was carrying on piracy, and plundering the Italian coasts for the purpose of obtairring the necessary provisions for the legions he still had on board. He now joined Antony, and sailed with him to Brundusium. When he approached, Octavianus shut the gates of the city upon him, and Antony forthwith called on Sex. Pompeius for assistance. The latter without delay sent skps and cavalry to the coast of Italy, and Octavianus found himself attacked on all sides, for Sardika kso was m the hands of the Pompeian party. As Fkvia, who had been the main cause of the war, was now dead, Octavianus was prevailed upon by ks friends to endeavour to become reconciled to Antony, who had aheady commenced besieging Brundusium. Maecenas, as the friend of Octavianus, with Asmius Polrio and L. Cocceius on the part of Antony, brought about the desired reconciliation. To gratify the two hostile armies, a general amnesty was proclaimed ; and a treaty was concluded, according to wkch Antony was to have all the provinces east of the Adriatic as far as the river Euplirates, and Octavianus all the western provinces, Africa alone being left to Lepidus. Italy was to belong to the tkee triumvirs in common. It was further agreed that Sex. Pompeius, whom Antony shamefully betrayed on that occasion, shokd be regarded as a common enemy, and that the war against the Partkans shokd be contkued. Tks new affiance between Octavianus and Antony, called the foedus Brundusinum, was cemented by the latter marrying the noble and virtuous Octavia, a sister of Octavianus and widow of C. Marcellus, whose happi ness was thus sacrificed to the poritical purposes of the rkers."], [548, "528 HISTORY OF ROME. After tks Antony remaked for a time at Eome. Pompeius having resumed ks piratical proceedings, harassed the coasts of Itky ; and by cutting off all supplies created so great a scarcity at Eome, that the populace compelled the triumvirs to enter into negotiations with km. In the neighbourhood of Cape Misenum, not far from Puteori, the triumvirs met Pompeius in B.C. 39. He received them in ks admiral's skp, and afterwards landed and partook of an entertainment with them. Menodorus, one of Pompeks's generals, advised ks master to put to death the triumvirs while they were on board ks skp, but Pompeius was too honest to enter into so treacherous a design. In the peace wkch was then concluded, Pompeius obtained the proconskskp of Sicily, Sardika, Corsica, and Achaia. After the conclusion of tks peace, Pompeius sailed back to Sicdy, and Octavianus and Antony returned to Eome. Wherever these two appeared, they were received by the people with enthusiastic joy, and all saluted them as the deliverers of then- country from famine and destruc tion. Soon after Antony went with Octavia to Athens, where for a time he rived as a private person, and spent the enskng winter m the enjoyment of all kkds of pleasure. In the begin ning of B.C. 38, however, he began makmg preparations for the Partkan war, k wkch ks lieutenants had, in the mean time, been very successful. But the peace wkch had thus been established was not of very long duration. Pompeius had reason to complain of Antony, who did not withdraw ks troops from Peloponnesus ; and Octa vianus, on the other hand, begriming to regret the concessions wkch had been made to Pompeius, was anxious to obtain a pretext for renewing the war. Tks was soon found in the circumstance that Pompeius still allowed some of ks vessels to carry on piracy in the Mediterranean. War was forthwith declared. Octavianus solicited the assistance of the two other triunivirs, but neither of them at first supported km : they were probably glad to see km involved in a struggle in wkch he was likely to be defeated. The fleet of Octavianus suffered greatly from storms and the"], [549, "529 WAR WITH SEXT.

Antony, on being called upon a second time to assist his colleague, sailed in the beginning of B.C. 37, with a fleet of 300 skps, to Tarentum ; but on Iris arrival, Octavianus, who had in the meantime changed ks mind, declined the assistance. Had it not been for the mediation of Octavia, the conduct of Octavi anus wokd at once have produced a rupture between the two triumvirs, but she succeeded k kducmg them to compromise the matter. They became reconciled, and Octavianus promised to send 20,000 men as auxiliaries for Antony in the Partkan war, while Antony sent 120 skps to Tarentum. It was further agreed that they should contkue in their office of triumvirs for five years longer. Hereupon Antony hastened to Syria, and Octavia remaked in Itky with her brother. The treacherous Menodorus now agak went back to ks former master with seven skps, without its being perceived by Calvisius, the admiral of Octavi anus, who was deprived of ks command k consequence. Octa vianus now appointed Agrippa supreme commander of the fleet, B.c. 36, and Sicriy was attacked on ah sides. It was agreed that on the 1st of Jky Octavianus shokd sad from Puteoli, Lepidus from Africa, and Antony's fleet from Tarentum ; but on the third a storm arose which compelled the fleets to return, and Lepidus alone succeeded k landkg at Lilybaeum. Pompeius had all along shown great carelessness, and he contmued in ks inactivity even now, amusing kmself with offering sacrifices to Neptune, whose son he pretended to be. Menodorus agak went over to Octavianus, and in a sea-fight wkch took place off Mylae against Agrippa, Pompeius lost thirty skps, and was unable to prevent Octavianus \u2022 from landing at Tauromenium. But the land army of the latter was hard pressed by the enemy. One rainy kght, late in the autumn, when Octavianus had lost his road, and was bivouackng at kght with ks men, a thundering noise was heard from the neighbouring Aetna, and the riskg A A"], [550, "530 HISTORY OF ROME. flames ffiumined all the country around. Tks phenomenon spread consternation among all who witnessed it. After many petty skirmishes, Agrippa at length engaged m a decisive battle, in wkch he made a very successful use of the Greek boarkng engines. Pompeius was completely defeated, and on receiving intelligence that ks land forces had surrendered, he fled with seventeen skps from Messana to Asia. Lepidus had exerted kmself very little in tks struggle, but after the departure of Pompeius he claimed the island of Sicily for himself. Octavianus, exasperated at such presumption, and knowing that Lepidus wokd not meet with much support anywhere, not even among his own soldiers, boldly entered ks camp at once, and without much diffiekty persuaded the soldiers to surrender, by promis ing them great rewards. Lepidus, who had no strength or energy of character, put on the attire of a private person, and went to Octavianus, who sent km to Eome, where he contmued in ks office of pontifex maximus until his death, wkch took place in b.c 12. Octavianus did not pursue Pompeius, but he was detaked in Sicily by the clamour of his soldiers, who demanded on the spot the rewards wkch had been promised them. When then desires were satisfied he retiu-ned to Eome, where he celebrated a triumph on the 13th of November, B.C. 36. As the city was now plentiftky provided with supplies, ks victory was hailed by all parties. The people were delighted at ks success, and the senate cokerred various distinctions on him wkch he declked with affected modesty. Pompeius, on ks arrivk in Asia, was hospitably received by Antony's legate, Furkus ; but he soon lost the confidence of ks host, and matters came to a rupture. Antony had at first been uncertak what to do with Pompeius, but when he heard of the breach between him and Furkus, he sent ks general, Titius, with a fleet of 120 skps against him. Pompeius took to flight, but was overtaken by ks pursuers, and being abandoned by ks troops, he was obliged to surrender at discretion. He was put"], [551, "DEATH OF SEXT.

By the overtkow of Pompeius, and the removal of Lepidus, Octavianus had acqkred sufficient strength to venture upon a contest with ks last rival as soon as he might tknk proper, and it was not long before a fah opportukty presented itself.

The triumvirate had now become a duumvirate, and while Octavianus had strengthened ks power by the accession of the army of Lepidus and ks province of Africa, Antony, k B.C. 36, undertook ks long contemplated campaign agakst the Partkans. He had sixteen legions, and was allied with Artavasdes, Mng of Armenia. He advanced as far as Media, and took several im portant towns, but ks plan of operations was ill-devised, for he left several legions behkd, and the Partkan kng Pkaates, who attacked them, not oky got possession of all then provisions and ammuktion, but completely annihilated the legions themselves. Tks and various other mifavourable circumstances compelled Antony to retreat, and it was not without the greatest kf fickty that he reached Armeka. His fate very nearly became the same as that of Crassus, for one-fourth of ks army was destroyed, and the greater part of ks baggage was lost. He returned to Alexandria, where he completely abandoned himself to sensuk pleasures with ks mistress, Cleopatra, to whom he gave Coele-Syria, Judaea, and Cyprus. His conduct henceforth was of the most contemptible knd, and Cleopatra was ks evil gekus. The losses he had sustained agknst the Partkans were however not forgotten ; they filled him with shame ; and as Artavasdes had drawn upon kmself the suspicion of treachery, Antony, k B.C. 34, kvaded Armeka, and made Artavasdes ks prisoner. Havkg given the conquered country to Cleopatra,"], [553, "OCTAVIANUS AND ANTONY. 533 Antony, on ks return to Alexandria, celebrated a splendid triumph, to the great annoyance of ah those Eomans who felt for the honour of their country. This irregular and unconstitutional conduct, the arbitrary manner m wkch he gave kngdoms to his concubine, and the flagrant way in which he abandoned kmself to all the licentiousness of an eastern court, were in the kghest degree offensive to the Eomans. Until now, the noble Octavia, though she had been treated by her husband in the most un worthy manner, had contrived to preserve peace between him and Octavianus, but tkngs came to a crisis just at the time when he kvaded Armenia. Octavia had gone to Greece with reinforcements, money, and clotlring for ks army; but he sent her a letter requesting her not to follow km, and soon after opeky divorced her. Tks act, wkch seems to have been brought about by the cunning contrivances of Octavianus km self, rent asunder the tie which had ktherto kept the triumvirs together. Octavianus had not neglected to direct the attention of the Eoman people to the conduct and follies of Antony at Alexandria, and the people of Eome now looked upon Octavianus and ks sister as the injured and kskted party ; but when the critical moment came, Octavianus was still prudent enough not to declare war agakst Antony kmself, whom he represented only as the ikatuated slave of Cleopatra, but against the queen of Egypt. His cause had thus a better appearance, as ks arms were ostensibly directed agakst those who had led Antony to act in this ksulting and provokng manner. During the time that Antony was engaged in the east, and revelling m the luxuries of ks Alexandrian court, Octavianus made some usefk attempts to remedy the cokusion and demo ralisation of the people of Italy, and he pretended to wait oky for the return of ks colleague from the east to retire kto private life, as after the restoration of peace the republic kd not require ks services any longer. This affectation of true republican sentiments gained its end, for Octavianus was elected pontifex maximus, kthough Lepidus, who was invested with that office,"], [554, "534 HISTORY OF ROME. was yet alive : it was also decreed that he should inhabit a public mansion, that ks person shokd be mviolable, and that in the senate he shokd sit by the side of the tribunes. In order to appear not to harbour any hostile feerings towards Antony, he always spoke of km in a kkd and benevolent manner, so that if any rupture shokd occur, no one wokd ascribe the fakt to Octavianus. With a view of obtaining the means of satisfying ks troops, who were still clamorous for then rewards, he resolved to wage war against some tribes m the north-east of the Adri atic, of wkch country the Eomans had never yet become com plete masters. When Octavianus reached the country of the Japydes, he met with a strong resistance, but by perseverance he obliged their capital, Metkum, to surrender, m B.C. 35. He then advanced kto Pannoka, the capitk of wkch, Segesta, after a siege of thirty days, sued for peace. Octavianus left ks legate Fufius Gerknus beknd with a garrison to keep the conquered nations m submission, and returned to Eome. Octavia bekg about tks time repudiated by Antony, Octa vianus neglected notkng that was calculated to bring promkently before the people the inskt wkch had been offered to ks family. He had formed the plan of invadkg Britain, but was prevented by the intelligence that the countries he had just subdued had revolted. His generals, indeed, succeeded k restorkg peace ; but Octavianus himself proceeded to Dalmatia, where Agrippa had the command. Several towns were taken, and neither ke nor property was spared. Octavianus penetrated as far as Setovia, where he received a wound in ks knee. After ks recovery he left the command to Statirius Taurus, and returned to Bome to enter ks second conskship, for B.C. 33. Taurus, in the meantime, completed the subjugation of the Dalmatians ; and out of the spoils Octavianus ordered a portico to be built, which he called Octavia, in honour to ks sister. During the years B.C. 33 and 32, Octavianus remained at Eome, and had plenty of opportukties of pokting out to the people the unworthy and despicable conduct of Antony, and of"], [555, "BATTLE OF ACTIUM. 535 convincing them that they had everytkng to fear from km, and that all the exertions they might be required to make, wokd be solely for their own good. War was at last declared in the end of B.c. 32, and m the year following, when Octavianus was kvested with ks third conskship, Eome was k a state of great excitement and karm, all classes being called upon to make the most extra ordinary exertions. In the sprmg of B.C. 31, the fleet of Octa vianus, under the able command of Agrippa, spread over the whole of the Adriatic, while Octavianus himself and ks legions landed m Epirus. He had had to struggle with many diflickties in Itky, m makng the people submit to the heavy demands he made upon them ; and if Antony had availed kmself of these circumstances, and had attacked ks enemy in Italy, the war might have terminated in a very different way. But Antony was slow, and his adversary gamed time to overcome ks diffi culties. Antony assembled ks fleet at Ephesus, and, accom paked by the ambitious Cleopatra, sailed from Asia to Samos and Athens ; thence he proceeded to Corcyra where all ks forces were assembled. His land army encamped near Actium, a pro montory of Acarnaka ; while Agrippa, at the entrance of the Ambracian gulf, took possession of the town of Toryne, and then made some successfk excursions upon the Greek coast. During these operations the summer passed away. Antony's friends advised him to decide the war by a land fight ; for though he had twice as many skps as Octavianus, yet they were very large and awkward, and not adapted successfully to operate agakst the right and swift boats of the enemy. But Cleopatra desired Antony to brkg the war to a close by an engagement at sea, and her will was obeyed. The memorable battle of Actium, on the 2nd of September, B.C. 31, decided the fate of the Eoman world at once and for ever. Its issue was at kst doubtfk, but when Cleopatra perceived that victory was not certam on her side, she took to kght, and sixty Egyptian skps followed her. As soon as Antony became aware of tks, he hastened after her in a qkck sailing boat, either from despair, or with the intention"], [556, "536 HISTORY OF ROME. of bringing her back, for the battle was not yet lost by any means. When he overtook the fugitive he was at first very inkgnant, but her power over km was so great that he soon became reconciled. He was received kto her skp and fled with her to Alexandria. The Egyptian fleet continued the fight for a few hours longer, but was finally destroyed by Agrippa. Antony's land army, consisting of seventeen legions, resolutely waited for seven days, hopkg that the triumvir wokd come back ; but when the commander, Canidius, was informed that Antony did not intend to return, and when he had received orders to retreat, he surrendered to Octavianus. The danger wkch had tk-eatened to bring Eome under the dominion of a licentious eastern queen was now removed ; the ambition of Octavianus was satisfied, and the generosity wkch he showed towards the vanquished met with general admiration. In commemoration of tks victory he founded, near Actium, the town of Nicopolis. Soon after he slowly proceeded tkough Greece and a part of western Asia, and then spent the winter in the island of Samos. His success had kcreased the confidence of ks army ; but ks veterans, in Italy, again began to show symptoms of discontent, and demanded the fkfilment of the promises wkch had been made them. He deternrined to remedy the evil k person, and hastened to Brundusium. On his arrival there he was received by a great number of Boman senators and eqktes, and by crowds of people who had flocked tkther from all parts. He availed himself of the generk enthusiasm, and persuaded the people to enable him to satisfy the demands of the veterans, to whom he now assigned lands in various parts of the empire. Without going to Eome he soon after sailed to Corinth, Ehodes, and Syria, and thence to Egypt. Antony had endeavoured to deceive Cleopatra in regard to ks own real position ; so that when Octavianus arrived at the mouth of the Nile, the queen, who dreaded a protracted war wkch might render her enemy impla cable, sent letters to lriin with proposks of peace, hoping to wk him over as she had won ks great-uncle, Caesar. But Octavianus"], [557, "DEATH OF ANTONY. 537 refused entering into any negotiations, and demanded uncondi tional surrender. In the spring of B.C. 30, he appeared before Pelusium, which admitted the invader without resistance. His army under the command of Aelius Gallus also took possession of Paraetonium, so that he cokd attack Alexandria both from the east and the west. The Egyptian fleet surrendered without a blow, and the cavalry also passed over to Octavianus. Antony now withdrew kto the city of Alexandria, and finding himself abandoned by all, and being falsely informed of the death of Cleopatra, resolved to die. He perished miserably, by tkow ing kmself upon ks own sword. The queen concealed herself with all her treasures in her palace, still hoping to win the con queror by her charms ; but when she discovered that he would spare her life only that she might adorn his triumph, she made away with herself by putting a viper to her breast. Octavianus was now sole master of a colossal empire. As the fink victory had been gamed on the second of Sextilis, the name of that month was afterwards changed into Augustus (August), and festivals were kstituted to commemorate the auspicious event, every year, at the begriming of August. The race of the Ptolemies had now become extinct, and Egypt received the constitution of a Eoman provkce, wkch, however, was governed in a peculiar manner, and enjoyed several privileges, as it was the prkcipal country from wkch Italy received its supplies of corn. The governor bore the title of Praefectus Augustalis, and was always a person of equestrian rank. The first who was intrusted with its admimstration was the poet Aelius Gallus, who had distingkshed himself m the war against Sext. Pompeius, and m the takkg of the important town of Paraetokum. After havkg regkated the affairs of this wealthy and popkous new provkce, Octavianus returned to Samos; and from thence he proceeded, in the spring of B.C. 29, to Eome, where the temple of Janus was closed as a sign that peace was restored throughout the empire. Octavianus celebrated a threefold triumph over a a3"], [558, "538 HISTORY OF ROME. Pannoma and Dalmatia, Antony and Egypt, and the people were higky pleased with the rejoickgs that were prepared for them. The veterans kso received ample rewards for their services, and whole legions obtaked settlements on the frontiers of the empire. Octavianus himself was honoured by the senate with various distinctions and privileges, and received the title of imperator for rife. The kstory of the Boman republic was now come to its fink close ; its fall was the unavoidable consequence of its internal decay and corruption, wkch, witkn the last century, had spread with immense rapikty over all parts of the socik and political macknery, and destroyed all the vital principles upon wkch kone a republic can stand with safety. In the kstory of Bome the attentive observer cannot help being im pressed with the truth, that the fate of a nation maiky depends upon the moral condition of its people ; and that the descend ants have often to pay a heavy penalty for the neglect or transgres sions of then- fathers. The peace wkch Eome now enjoyed might have been a blesskg to her fourteen years earlier, and much strife, misery, and bloodshed might have been spared ; but at that time the conviction that the republic was gone had not yet become generk, for there still were persons who, in their delu sion, thought it possible to revive the good old days. Eome indeed required adktionk and fearful lessons before she cokd be brought to see that peace and happiness cokd not exist kong with the phantom of a commonwekth from wkch the soul had departed, and that those blessings cokd be bestowed oky by the strong hand of a skgle rker. Tks feering was now become qkte general ; and men like Horace, who had fought m the ranks of Brutus, haded with joy the happy termination of all civil feuds, and the victories of Octavianus over all ks enemies. Every honest Eoman, like every unprejudiced student of kstory, must have come to the conclusion that the victory over Antony, and the establishment of the monarchy under Octavianus, was the greatest boon that Providence cokd have bestowed upon the Eoman world."], [559, "539 CHAPTEE XXXIX. EXTENT OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, ITS CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION. \u2014 THE LANGUAGE, LITERATURE, AND ARTS DURING THE LATTER PERIOD OF THE REPUBLIC. \u2014 CHARACTER AND MORALS OF THE PEOPLE DURING THE SAME PERIOD. Before we proceed to describe the graduk establishment of the monarchy under Octavianus, let us cast a glance at the extent of the empire, its constitution and admikstration, at the state of literature and the arts, as well as at the condition of the people during the last century of the republic. Eome, at tks time, was the mistress of a colossal empire, and all the countries over wkch she exercised her sway, with the exception of Itky, were constituted as dependencies or provinces. She ruled over all the islands of the Mediterranean, over Egypt, Cyrene, Africa (the territory of ancient Carthage), Numidia, Mauritania, Spam, with the exception of the northern districts of that peknska, all Gak as far as the Ekne, Blyricum, Pannoka, Dahnatia, Moesia, Macedoka, Tkace, all Greece, and kmost the whole of the immense extent of country k Asia between Mount Caucasus, the Caspian Sea, the Partkan empire, the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, and on the west the Mediterranean. In some of these countries the Eoman dominion was, indeed, not yet firmly established; but the time was not far distant when they were to lose even the last shadow of kdependence. But Eome's ambition was not satisfied with tks, for the nations borderkg upon her empire, such as the Britons, Germans, Partkans, were not left in peace, and one after another was compelled, in the course of time, to acknowledge the supremacy of Bome. The constitution of the republic had received its first great"], [560, "540 HISTORY OF ROME. shock in the noble attempt made by the Gracchi to remedy the evils which had been brought about by the usurpation of the rich, and by certain unavoidable circumstances. The senate and the optimates at that time gamed the victory, but their blood-stained power was not to be of long duration ; for they acted with a perfect contempt of all law and justice, and the citizens felt then oppres sive rke no less than the allies and the provinces. Then influence was crushed by ambitious demagogues who started up one after another m the civil wars. Sulla again, after ks victory over the popkar party, formed the cklksh plan of restoring the good old times, by undokg the work of time, and by reviving the ancient forms of the constitution ; but ks system was a body without a soul, for the senate had long ceased to be that venerable assembly wkch once filled those who witnessed its meetkgs with awe and reverence. Its power, wkch had been abused k the most flagrant manner, was broken by the influence of the eqktes, a class of men who continued to rise in importance from the time of the Gracck. Tks class not oky acquired judicial power, wkch they abused as grossly as the senators had done before, but being wealthy capitalists, and engaged k the farming of the public revenues, they had it in then- power to support any am bitious demagogue, and thus to keep the senate m a sort of dependence. The consequence was that titles and honours were the oky distinctions of the senate, while ah the substantial power was k the hands of the equites ; and so kgh did the latter rise in public estimation, that in B.C. 67, the tribune, L. Boscius Otho, carried a law by wkch the fourteen rows of seats m the theatres, immediately in front of the orchestra, were assigned to the eqktes exclusively.1 But the insolence of the eqktes on the one hand, and the system of bribery by wkch the other powers in the republic were kept in subjection, was as detrimental to the state as it was disgracefk to themselves. The senate was 1 Ascon. in Cornel, p. 78, ed. Orelli ; vilege was granted to tribunes of the Liv. Epit. 99 ; Veil.

Such senators were little better than common hire rings ; the question of the good of the state never entered their minds, and they rejected or adopted measures as they were bid by their patrons, or oky with a view to the greater pecukary advan tages wkch they themselves might derive from them. The con skskp was likewise degraded by being given to persons who were ready to do whatever the leaders of their party desired. The degradation of tks magistracy, however, began more partickarly in the time of Caesar.2 Where, in former times, all had been active and zekous to promote the public good, every one was now bent upon personal aggrandisement, without any regard to the commonwealth. The fearfk anarchy into wkch Eome was plunged after the time of Sulla showed itself more partickarly in the assemblies of the people, for there the place of the free-born Eoman citizens was occupied by an idle and hungry popkace, wkch had no desire for anytkng kgher than bread and amusements, and was ever ready to attach itself to those who had the richest rewards to offer. At the elections of magistrates, bribery was carried on in the most open and unscrupkous manner ; and the dregs of the city, which fed upon bribery, decided upon the most important affairs of the state, such as the election of magistrates, the enact ment of laws, and upon peace and war. The comitia often were of the most riotous and tumultuous knd, for the hostile factions not unfrequently attacked each other with arms ; and the fomm was the scene of civil bloodshed, bands of armed slaves and gladiators occupymg it and decking, by the dagger or the sword, what ought to have been settled by free and rational discussion. The tribunes, who had been the representatives of the people and the guardians of their rights,-ever smce the time of the Gracchi, either themselves came forward as the leaders of factions, or sold themselves as supporters to those who chose to buy them by bribes. 2 Sueton. Caes. 72, 76."], [562, "542 HISTORY OF ROME. The admikstration of the provinces, and of justice, kept pace k pokt of corruption with the politick and moral dege neracy of the people. The general immorality and licentiousness of the age rendered a change in the admkistration of justice necessary. As early as the year B.C. 149, the tribune L. Calpur mus Piso carried a measure by wkch the Eoman people transferred their judicial power, for certain classes of crimes, to commissioners, who were appointed annually, and who, under the presidency of the praetor, tried the accused, and inflicted pun ishment on the guilty in the name of the Eoman people.3 But as the praetors, like other magistrates, were gkded in then edicts rather by their own interest and a love of money than by a proper sense of justice, the tribune C. Cornelius, m B.C. 67, carried a law by wkch the praetors were obliged to pronounce sentence accordkg to the ekcts or principles of law which they had once established ;4 for on entering upon ks office, every praetor had to announce or lay down such an edictum ; front wkch time such edicts acquired permanent authority in all legk matters, and were commented upon and explained by the most distingkshed jurists. Although Eoman citizens had not to pay any taxes to the re public, and though the amount of domam land was constantly dimikshkg by the establishment of colomes and by its dis tribution among the veterans, still the wealth of the republic, during the latter period of its existence, was immense, for enormous sums flowed from the provinces kto the public treasury. The provkce of Asia, m the time of Sulla, pkd annually about one million sterring, wkch subsequently was increased even to upwards of two millions ; and one Spaksh mine yielded an annual produce of upwards of half a million : from these facts we may form some estimate of the revenue derived from such rich s These are the quaestiones per- quently added by Sulla, Pompey, and petuae, or standing criminal courts for Caesar. certain crimes, such as high treason, * Ascon. in Cornel, p. 58, ed.

The regkar tribute, paid by the provinces, was let out in farm by the censors to the kghest bidder : the persons who under took the farming, whether they were mdividuals or compakes (societates), first paid or gave security to the treasury for the sums stipkated, and then sent their agents (publicani)mto theprovkces to collect the taxes, under the protection, and if necessary with the assistance of the military forces stationed in theprovkces. These pubricani became proverbik in the provinces for then- avarice, cruelty, and oppression ; for then- object, as well as that of their employers, was to make as large a profit out of the country as pos sible, and they called in without mercy the assistance of the sol diery wherever the exhausted provkcials cokd not, or wokd not, comply with their exorbitant demands. The wekth of the subject countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe, was thus systematically collected and carried to Eome, where it enriched the public treasury no less than the farmers of the revenue. But notwith standing all tks, the republic never possessed a regular and rightly orgaksed system of finance, which might have created a permanent and inexhaustible treasure. The greater part of these revenues was spent upon the maktenance of the poor, the fleets, the armies, the officiks employed in the provinces, the donations wkch were given to the popkace in the shape of com, meat, and public amusements, and the rewards given to the veterans. The wars of the triumvirs in the end so much drained the treasury, that Octavianus found it necessary to impose a heavy war-tax to repleksh it, every freedman, possessing a certain amount of property, being obliged to give up to the state one eighth of it.5 During the latter years of the republic, little or no care seems to have been taken about keeping peace and order in the city : the regkations made with a view to preserve public safety and decency were violated every day without fear or scruple ; and crimes of every description were committed in public and in broad 5 Dion.

Eegkar guards to preserve peace and order in the city during the night never existed untri Octavianus insti tuted the nocturnorum vigilum cohortes. The censorskp stk existed ; but after the Social war, when all the Italians acquired the Eoman citizenskp, it became utterly impossible for the censors to control the conduct of the people ; hence murder, poisoning, forged wills, robbery, perjury, and the like, became erimes of every-day occurrence. The superintendence of the public granaries, of the com market, and of the distribution of gram among the people was in the hands of the two aediles cereales, who had been kstituted by J. Caesar, in B.C. 45.6 The functions of a city police stk continued to be performed, though in an inefficient manner, by the four other aediles. In the composition of the Eoman armies two considerable changes had taken place. C. Marius set the kst example of enlisting persons of the lowest classes, and even slaves and freedmen. By tks means the wealthier classes were afterwards enabled to remain at Eome, and to indkge in the pleasures and amusements of the city, while the battles of the republic were fought by the greedy popkace, who had no other object in view than to acquire the means of revelling in luxuries and debauch eries. Warlike virtue and patriotism had disappeared more and more ever since the beginning of the civil wars : the solkers, in the rich provinces in which they were often stationed for a num ber of years, became demoralized and effeminate, and it required the most extraordkary efforts and tact to keep them in rkritary suborffination.

The art of war received great improvements at the hands of such men as C. Marks, L. Sulla, Cn. Pompey, and, above all, J. Caesar. The armies in the time of Caesar no longer consisted of Eomans and allies (socii) : we read only of Eomans and auxiliaries, the latter of whom were armed accord mg to the customs of the countries from which they were drawn. The provinces were governed as before by praetors and pro consuls; and it was these dependencies, especially when favoured by nature, wkch were most exposed to robbery, plunder, and extortion by the Eoman governors and their soldiery. It is attested by Cicero, that the arrival of a governor, even k a peacefk province, was little different from the entrance of a victorious army kto the country of a vanqkshed enemy. Even men who were of good repute for then humanity, after they had been in a province for some years, returned to Eome with almost incredible sums of money. What the governors left undone, was completed by usurers and the farmers of the public revenue; and Asia, wkch was repeatedly drained to the utmost, wokd have been utterly rained, had it not been a country endowed by nature with almost inexhaustible resources. Verres is a fair specimen of what most governors of provinces were during the latter period of the republic. The provincials had, indeed, the right to prosecute their oppressors ; but the judges were either the accomplices of the ckprits, or had an interest in keeping things as they were : even the most barefaced robbers on a large scale found orators and lawyers who were ready to defend them, and judges who had no scruple in acquitting them.

Agrickture, once the pride and glory of the Eomans, had become completely neglected in Italy ; and the immense estates (latifundia) possessed by the wealthy Eomans were used for the most part as pastures, on wkch large flocks were kept by gangs of slaves, while in other parts the late wars had reduced whole districts to barren wildernesses. The consequence was that Italy, one of the most fertile countries k Europe, wkch might have supported the most numerous popkation, was dependent for its supplies of corn upon Sicily, the territory of ancient Carthage, Sardika, and Egypt. The final blow to Italian agrickture seems to have been given by the establishment of the military colonies, whereby many farms were taken from the kdustrious peasants and given to reckess soldiers, who had neither the industry nor inclination, nor the knowledge, reqksite for agricktural purskts. Eome's dependence upon other countries for its supplies of food frequently produced great distress in the city, especially at the time when the Mediterranean was kfested by the phases, and kterwards when Sex. Pompeius exercised ks sway over the sea. That hazard at sea was also detrimental to commerce m general, though the Eomans themselves were never very active as mer chants. They received their articles of luxury chiefly from Mar seilles, Alexandria k Egypt, and the ports of Syria ; in wkch ports the Egyptian and Syrian merchants, who fetched their merchanffise from India, Persia, and Arabia, disposed of it to the Eomans. But Eoman merchants also kept vessels of their own with wkch they visited foreign markets, where they purchased gold, slaves, corn, and other commodities ; and many of them carried on a considerable commerce with Gak, wkch they visited either by sea or by the roads leading across the Alps. The Latin language was at tks time understood, if not spoken, in all parts of Italy, in the south of Gak, in a great part of Spam, and in the western islands of the Mediterranean ; in all which"], [567, "547 LATIN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE. countries Latk was ktimately to become the language of the people. In the provinces east of the Adriatic, on the other hand, no attempt was ever made to supplant the language spoken by the provincials. A perfect Eomaksation, therefore, took place oky in the northern and western parts of the empire ; that is, in countries whose civilisation, at the time of then conquest, was below that of the Eomans. There cannot, however, be any doubt that in all the Eoman provinces, even where the Latk language was not introduced, persons of rank and education acquired a competent knowledge of it tkough the influence of the Eoman armies, officers, adventurers, and other Italians who settled among the provincials. In Italy, again, there were few persons of any pretensions who were not thorougky acquakted with the Greek language. Eome itself swarmed with learned Greeks, who gave instruction in then- native tongue, in rhetoric and philosophy ; and those Eomans who had sufficient means used to send their sons to the kgh places of learkng k Greece, where they cktivated then nrinds and taste under the gkdance of the ablest teachers. Tks intellectuk connection with Greece excited in the minds of the Eomans the greatest zeal and ambition to emkate the Greeks in carrying to perfection their own language : poets, kstorians, and, above all, the orators, exerted themselves to elevate the lan guage and literature of then- country to a pokt where they might be worthy rivals of those of Greece. The influence of tks intel lectuk activity was however more or less confined to Eome and the larger towns ; the language spoken m the country districts and distant parts of Italy, (lingua rustica, or rusticitas,) showed a marked difference from the language spoken at Eome (urba nitas), where the taste of the better classes was daily cktivated by the public orators and the society of those who had received a riberk and perfect education. The golden age of Eoman literature extends from the death of Sulla to that of Augustus : it was during that period of about knety years that Eome produced her greatest minds in every branch of literature, in poetry as well as in prose. Books had been"], [568, "548 HISTORY OF ROME. collected by Eoman nobles long before tks time, such as Aemi lius Pakus, who brought many books with km from Mace doka ; and libraries existed in most of the palaces and vkas of the great : but the first public library was established at Eome by Asikus Polrio (born in B.C. 74, died in a.d. 4), who was km self distingkshed as a poet and orator ;3 and ks example was followed by Caesar and Octavianus.9 The demand for books produced booksellers, who exposed their books for sale on stalls, and caused copies to be made of the works they had on sale ; but wealthy authors used to keep slaves for the sole purpose of makng copies of their works, wkch they sent to their friends. Such slaves were called literati, or librarii. But whatever were the efforts of the Eomans, their literature, from the days of Livius Androkcus, had been and remaked, on the whole, merely an imitation of that of Greece ; and the Greeks, who had been subdued by the arms of Eome, gained and main tained the ascendancy over their conquerors by the spirit of then arts and then- literature. The flourishing period, more over, of Eoman riterature, was of short duration, as is kways the case when a riterature is not built upon a trky national basis : such an artificial creation may at k-st grow luxuriantly in its new soil, like a plant in a hothouse, but afterwards it becomes either crippled or shortlived. The latter was the case with Eoman literature, whose fan- growth was checked by the vices and follies no less than by the misfortunes of the times wkch followed the reign of Augustus ; for literature, in all countries, seems to tkive best in times of great excitement, whether it arises from political or religious commotions or from great military undertakmgs. The regkar and sublime tragedy after the Greek model never became popkar among the Eomans, who cannot boast of one great tragic poet. Men like Eoscius and Aesopus, in the age of Cicero, might, for a time, fascinate the people with then wonderfk powers as actors m comedy and tragedy, and wekthy Eomans might spend the most exorbitant sums upon the erection of s Plin.

The authors of mimes, therefore, were the oky dramatic composers that met with any favour, of whom m the time of J. Caesar we find two who acquired a great reputation, Dechnus Laberius and P. Syras. P. Lucretius Cams, who ffied in b.c 52, at the age of forty-four, was a trky great poet ; he wrote a great didactic poem, in six books, on the Nature of Tkngs, wkch is still extant ; it is oky to be regretted that he employed ks muse k the advocacy of the miserable system of the Epicurean philosophy. Lyric poetry was cktivated with great success ; and though the poets were, to a great extent, mere imitators of the lyric poets of Greece, yet their pro ductions were in no wise unworthy of then models. We here need mention oky the names of the heroes of lyric poetry whose works have come down to us : C. Valerius Catullus, of Verona, (born in B.C. 85, died about B.C. 45); Horace, of Venusia, (bom in B.C. 63, died B.C. 8) ; Tibklus, and Propertius. In epic, idyllic, and didactic poetry, none surpassed Virgil (born k B.C. 70, at Andes, near Mantua, ked k B.C. 19) ; and Ovid, of Sulmo (born in B.C. 43, died k a.d. 17). Political oratory, wkch had naturally been cktivated at Bome from early times, but had commenced a period of rapid development in the age of the Gracck, reached its kghest perfection under the influence of such men as Q. Hortensius, Cicero, J. Caesar, Cato, and others; but its flouriskng period terminated abruptly with the fall of the republic, for public oratory is the child of political liberty, and cannot ekst without it. Even Cicero, in the later years of ks life, complkned of the decline of the art m wkch he himself had outshone all ks contemporaries. In the year B.C. 99, 10 In B.C. 58, M. Aemilius Scaurus but it did not remain standing more built a most magnificent wooden than one month. The first stone theatre, which contained 80,000 spec- theatre was that of Cn.

Plotius had opened the kst school for teackng Latin oratory, and had met with great applause ; but two years later, the censors expressed then- strong disapprovk of it, for they declared tks school of Latin rhetoricians to be injurious to the young, and contrary to the customs of their forefathers.11 Speckative philosophy had never been a favourite purskt among the Eomans, and it is amuskg to see how Cicero, who was the kst to attempt to make ks countrymen acquakted with the reskts of Greek speckation, apologises for venturing to introduce these abstruse disqksitions among ks countrymen ; though ks lucubrations were by no means of a transcendentk kind, but had k view those more practick ends wkch have a direct bearing upon the affairs of the state and human rife in general. We may, indeed, admit that Cicero was not a philosopher, in the kghest sense of the word ; but he has the undisputed merit of havkg popkarised among the Eomans, and in their own language, the reskts of the practick parts of Greek philosophy. The kgher classes had adopted a sort of Epicurean system, because it kd not oppose then- luxurious and licentious mode of life ; while the better and nobler mkds sought and found comfort k the purer and loftier doctrines of the Stoics, wkch, at the same time, were a kkd of compensation for the religious wants of the age ; the religion of ancient Eome havkg become a subject of ridicke with the more enlightened class of Eomans. M. Terentius Varro, a contemporary of Cicero, was a man of most extensive kformation, but the greater part of ks numerous and vkuable works have perished. Historical stukes were pur sued with great vigour, and the kstorians of tks period rose far above those of former times. We still possess some most ex cellent kstorical works wkch were written at that time ; such as a few of the Lives of Cornelius Nepos, the History of the Jugur tkne war and the Catilkarian conspiracy by Sallust, the Com mentaries of J. Caesar and A. Hirtius, and a considerable portion of the voluminous History of Eome, by Livy. Each of these 11 Genius, xv. 11."], [571, "LITERATURE AND THE ARTS. 551 historians has ks peculiar charms and beauties : each of them looked at kstory from a different pomt of view, and wrote accord ingly in a different spirit. The works of many others, such as Q. Claudius Quadrigarius, Valerius of Antium, Licikus Macer, T. Pompokus Atticus, Q. Aelius Tubero, Asikus Poffio, Varro, Cato, L. Lucceius, the Memoirs of Sulla, and the Commentaries of the philosopher P. Volumkus who wrote the kstory of the war against Brutus, have been lost in the course of time, and are known oky tkough the quotations of others. Although Bome herself never produced any great artists, yet there arose in Italy such a love of works of art, especially after the war of Sulla agakst Mitkidates, that it almost amounted to a mania among the wealthy Eomans, and, in many instances, led to the most disgracefk robberies ; for the governors of provinces, in the most unscrupkous manner, appropriated to themselves the ornaments of temples and public buildings, no less than those of private houses. We need oky remember the conduct of Verres m Sicily, who was assuredly not the oky man who acted in that rapacious manner, to form an opikon of the extent to wkch the robbery of works of art was carried. But not oky were statues, pamtings, vases, and other moveable articles of ornament taken and carried to Itky ; means were devised even for cutting away murk pkntkgs and removing them : nor were these works of art used to adorn oky the public places and buildings of the city ; many more were carried to the private dweffings of the great, and to their villas in the country, wkch were lavisky stocked with these plundered treasures. In those villas they were generally kept kdden from public view, for the exclusive enjoyment of the wealthy ; and tks practice was carried to such an extent, that, on one occasion, Agrippa de livered a speech, in wkch he proposed publicly to sell all the statues and pkntings wkch were kdden in the villas of the great.12 This love of works of art also created a considerable traffic in them at Bome ; and picture-dealers and statue-dekers 12 Plin. xxxv. 9."], [572, "552 HISTORY OF ROME. were persons of some consequence among the Boman amateurs.13 Eminent artists, moreover, went to Eome m great numbers; though not so much with a view to get orders for new and ori gkal creations, as to make copies of the most renowned works of the earlier Greek masters. But the ennobring influence of literature and the arts produced very little effect upon the moral and social condition of the ma jority of the Eomans : wealth, and the love of luxuries and sen sual pleasures, were opponents too powerfk to be subdued by such gentle means; and the course of demoralisation cokd not be checked either by the censorskp or by legk enactments. The licentiousness of the populace, the avarice of the great, the generk effeminacy, combined with the most heartless cruelty, reached an almost mcrekble height. The Eoman nobles erected pkaces and villas, with wkch even our royal palaces, in point of grandeur and magmficence, can scarcely bear any comparison : mountaks were levelled, lakes were dug, and portions of the sea changed into dry land, merely to gratify the wkms and fancies of the wekthy ; and the anecdotes of the extravagance of some sur pass almost all belief. The furniture and ornaments of then dwellkgs consisted of the finest metals, and of the most costly species of wood, yet these materials were themselves of little value in comparison with the labour and skill that were lavished upon the workmanship. At their repasts the most exqksite kshes were brought together from all parts of the world ; and, k order not to be restraked in then- extravagant enjoyment of them, they had recourse to the disgustkg practice of takkg emetics, both before and after their debauches. The licentiousness and immo rality among women wTas almost greater than among men, and the natural consequence was, that men preferred living m concu bkage to enterkg the state of legal matrimony. Thus the number of free citizens constantly decreased, while that of freedmen increased with extraordinary rapidity. Tks state of tkngs, wkch lasted till about the reign of Vespasian, became 13 Cic. ad Fam. vii. 23 ; Horat. Sat. ii. 3, 64."], [573, "CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE. 553 so generk, that it was found necessary to make enactments against celibacy, and to coker rights and privileges upon those who were fathers of a certak number of children born in legal wedlock. Tks corrupt state of domestic life naturally exercised its influence upon the education of the young : they were neglected by their parents, and left to the care of Greek slaves (paedagogi or custodes), who taught them the Greek language, and Greek manners, then mother tongue bekg little cared for. The whole of the education of children went in the wrong direction, for the national feelings of the Eomans were thus, m early life, mokded into a corrupt foreign form. The better classes, of course, formed the exception, causing their children to be instructed m kstory, poetry, rhetoric, and philoso phy ; and what cokd not be acquired at home was afterwards sought in the great schools wkch were established k various parts of the eastern world. The spirit of ancient Eome had thus completely disappeared from all the relations of life ; the moral strength of the people was broken ; the freedom of their fathers was gone. Eome had become unable to govern herself, and wanted the powerfk hand of an absolute raler : like an exhausted mother she had lost the power of producing trky great and good men. She was kcapable of enjoykg political freedom, wkch prospers oky when it is supported by the manly virtues and the moral character of a nation. Thousands must have looked with disgust upon the perpetual struggles wkch had of late torn the republic to pieces, and must have felt that a tranquil enjoyment of rife, which was with many the kghest object of existence, was incompatible with the continuance of the republic. Tks class of persons must have hailed with delight the cessation of civil strife, and looked upon the sovereignty of Octavianus as the greatest boon that cokd have been obtained from Heaven. B B"], [574, "554 CHAPTEE XL. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MONARCHY UNDER AUGUSTUS. During the whole period of Eoman kstory which now follows, the fate of the empire is so kseparably connected with that of its individuk rulers, that its annks henceforth consist of little more than the biograpkes of the successive sovereigns. The reign of Octavianus, however, has a peculiar mterest from the circum stance that it forms the transition from the republican to the monarckcal form of government, and it is tks graduk transition wkch we have to contemplate before we proceed with the narra tive of the external events of his reign. The battle of Actium had put an end to a long series of bloody and destructive civil wars ; and Octavianus, having no longer to combat any adversary, now found it possible to restore the blessings of peace and order. During ks long reign of forty four years, from B.C. 30 till a.d. 14, republican freedom was gradually forgotten ; the generation wkch had taken part in the late struggles soon died away ; and those who retamed a recol lection of the horrid bloodshed that had staked the latter years of the republic cokd not wish to see those times restored : with very few exceptions, all seemed led to the conclusion that a mild monarchy is a happier state than a republic in a conktion of dissolution and anarchy. In B.C. 29, when Octavianus re turned to Eome from Samos, he was overwhelmed by the adka tion and servility of the senate and people. Some of his friends advised him to lay down ks pow-ers and retire to a private station ; but he followed the wiser counsel of Maecenas, who per suaded him not to abandon the republic agak to the forlorn"], [575, "ESTABLISHMENT OF MONARCHY. 555 condition from wkch it had oky just emerged. As it was evident that he was desirous of making the people forget their former misery, as well as ks own acts of cruelty, both the senate and the people received with enthusiastic joy the announcement that he consented to remain at the head of the republic. Being ankous however to avoid every appearance of a wish to obtain regk power, he refused to accept the title of dictator wkch was offered him, and was satisfied with the novel title of Augus tus,1 wkch was conferred upon him at the beginnkg of B.C. 27, on the proposal of L. Munatius Plancus. Along with tks he accepted for ten years the title of Lmperator,\" wkch cokerred upon km the military command of all the Eoman armies, and afterwards allowed it to be renewed each time for five or ten years, with an affected reluctance, by which he endeavoured to impress upon the senate and people that he himself was most anxious to preserve the republican constitution ; for ks great plan was to acquire sovereign power without aboriskng any of the republican forms, which accordingly were carefully retained. By tks means he gradually concentrated in his own person all the different powers wkch, under the republic, had belonged to the different magistrates. Thus, in B.C. 23, he was mvested with the tribukeian power for life, whereby ks person became for ever sacred and inviolable, like that of a tribune of the people. By virtue of tks power he cokd annk any decree of the senate, and interfere m all the acts of other magistrates, while any one might appeal to km from any of the courts of justice ; it, lastly, gave km the right to convoke the senate, and put to the vote any subject he might think proper. In like manner he 1 The name Augustus is probably connected with the word augur, and signifies the sacred or venerable, whence the Greek writers express it by 5e/8a<TTo'j.

The full name of Octavianus now was C. Julius Caesar Octavianus Augus tus. From the time of Hadrian the presumptive successor of an emperor was distinguished by the title Caesar. - The title Imperator (Emperor) was used by him as a praenomen. and afterwards remained so with all the Roman monarchs. B B 2"], [576, "556 HISTORY OF ROME. obtained the power of a censor, and the proconskar power in all the provinces of the empire. In B.C. 12, when Lepidus ked, Augustus succeeded km in the office of pontifex maximus, and thereby obtained the superintendence of all religious and ecclesi astical matters, which enabled him to exercise an almost unlimited influence over all the priestly colleges. All these powers, ukted as they were in his person, constituted him the real sovereign of the empire ; but he took great care not to show opeky that tks was really the case; and for tks reason he did not keep the titles of those digkties for kmself exclusively, but nomkally left the conskskp and other magistracies to others, so that the republic with all its forms apparently continued as before, while in fact the office of consul, and others, were mere names or titles by wkch the friends and partisans of the emperor were rewarded. The same caution with which Augustus exercised the various powers thus conferred upon km was manifest also in ks private life, for he did not distingksh himself in any way from the rest of the citizens, but rived with the simplicity of a private person ; towards ks friends he behaved with the same cordiality and familiarity as before, and in ks leisure hours he took part in their games and amusements, and even laughed at their rakeries. A court, k our sense of the word, did not exist at all ; and the whole appearance of Augustus was that of a private citizen. The senate had been disgraced by the introduction of unworthy members in the time of Caesar, and still more by the triumvirs but as soon as Augustus had obtained the censorial power, he induced many to withdraw and excluded others, and limited the number of senators to 600.3 The ordinary meetings of the senate had ktherto taken place tkice every month, but Augustus re duced them to two in every month, with the exception of Septem ber and October, during wkch the senate had vacation. The relation between the emperor and the senate was at first qkte undefined, and Augustus attended the meetkgs only under the republican title of princeps senatiis, by virtue of wkch he had the - Dion Cass. liv. 13, lv. 3 ; Tacit. Ann. iv. 23."], [577, "ESTABLISHMENT OF MONARCHY. 557 right of introducing any subject for discussion. In b.c 24, he was formally exempted from all laws, a regkation which remained k force under his successors, while their edicts were as bkding as laws or decrees of the senate had been before. During the latter period of his reign, Augustus rarely attended the meetings of the senate, but formed for kmself a kkd of state-council or com mittee, consisting of 20 senators, with whom he deliberated upon all subjects wkch were to be brought before the senate; and what ever he proposed appears to have been passed forthwith, with out any discussion.'' The senate had formerly been the supreme court of justice m cases of crimes agknst the majesty of the republic ; as the state had now become identked with the person of the emperor, Augustus left to the senate the decision of all cases m wkch the majesty of ks person was violated, since it would have been odious for km to assume jurisdiction in such instances. Augustus had no ministers in our sense of the word ; but in all matters of importance, wkch he did not wish to be discussed in public, he availed himself of the advice of ks friends, the most eminent among whom were M. Vipsanius Agrippa, C. Cilkus Maecenas, M. Valerius Messala, and Askius Polrio, all men of great ability in some department or other. Maecenas was a Boman eques, descended from an illustrious Etruscan family : he loved ease and comfort, and was fond of kdkging k the refined luxuries of rife ; but the influence he exercised on Augustus was very beneficik, for he succeeded in restrainkg the emperor's natural incrination to cowardice and cruelty ; and at the same time that he was himself a promoter and supporter of everytkng that contributed to embellish and adorn social rife, he also inspired Augustus with a similar desire. It may be said in general that Maecenas did more than any one else to ren der the age of Augustus brilliant and illustrious, especially by ks patronage of literature and the arts, for wkch ks name has become proverbial. We need not here kscuss the question 4 Dion Cass. liv. 13 ; Sueton. Aug. 35."], [578, "558 HISTORY OF ROME. whether his support of poetry and the arts was given from pure motives, or whether it was to satisfy his personal vanity ; it is enough for us to know that he actually did nurture and cherish such men of genius as Horace. At the time when Maecenas was intrusted with the administration of the city, he discharged his duties with great prudence and discretion. Agrippa was equally indispensable and useful to Augustus : he was a man of very great talent and had a strong attachment to republican institu tions, but finding it useless to struggle against the current of the tide, he took an active and prominent part in the estabbshment of the monarchy, which through him acquired strength, stability, and dignity. It has been said, and with justice, that of all the men who rose to eminence during the civil wars, Agrippa was the only one whose elevation was a real blessing to the state. To him the city of Rome was mainly indebted for its architectural improvements and embellishments, which enabled Augustus, who himself erected a vast number of splendid buildings, to say, towards the end of his reign, that he had changed Rome from a city of huts into one of marble palaces 5. The great splendour of the city gave it a general appearance of happiness and prosperity, and increased among the people then- love and admiration of their ruler. It was undoubtedly not a little owing to the influence of such men as these that Augustus was honoured by the senate and people with the appellation of father of his country1'. The people were not in any way deprived of the forms of re pubbcan freedom : Augustus even restored to the comitia the right of electing those magistrates whose appointment had been transferred to Caesar ; but the whole was merely a form, for it was always a matter of course that the people should not elect any one who was not recommended by Augustus ; and he was 5 Agrippa, among many other edi- sices, built the Pantheon in the Cam- pus Martius, which still exists in an excellent state of preservation, and bears the inscription M.

It was dedicated to the gods connected with the Julian gens, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, J. Caesar, and others, and is now used as a church under the name of Santa Maria Ro tonda. 6 Sueton.

The legislative power of the assemblies died away very gradually : several laws are mentioned wkch were passed k the reign of Augustus in the old republican manner ; but in the time of ks successor, Tiberius, we hear no more of them. The worskp of the gods, wkch had lately been greatly neglected, was taken especial care of by Augustus ; and in many kstances he went far beyond upholdkg that wkch still existed, revivkg old and forgotten superstitions and forms of worskp. Whether this arose from ks own superstitious feelkgs, or whether it was de vised to make the people believe that he was endeavouring to restore the good old times, is a matter of uncertknty. But what seems to have engaged ks attention more than any thing else was the restoration of peace and safety m the city, where it was not uncommon for assassins to roam about with their dag gers in broad daylight 8, without any one bekg bold enough to check them. Augustus extirpated these banditti, by sktable police regulations, with great resolution and fo-mness. He divided the whole extent of the city, mclucring the suburbs, into fourteen regions, each with a separate local magistrate ; and each region was subdivided into vici, the affairs of each of wkch were managed by an officer called vici magister. Tks wise arrange ment rendered it possible also to introduce an efficient city police, the vigiles or cohortes urbanae, who had to watch over the safety of the city, and to assist in cases of fire, riots, and the like. The whole admikstration of the city, and the superintend ence of all its local officers as well as the vigries, was given to a new magistrate created by Augustus under the title of praefeetus urbi. Bome, wkch had before been almost like a den of rob bers, now became a safe place, and the people had reason to be gratefk to the emperor for it. In like manner he divided the whole of Italy, from the foot of the Alps to the straits of Sicily, into a number of regions, each of wkch was probably headed by some magistrate for the purpose of jurisdiction. 7 Vel .

For ks person k safety, Augustus established a body-guard of ten praetorian cohorts, each consisting of 800 or 1000 men both cavalry and infantry ; the whole of tks body of troops was com manded by the praefectus praetorio, an officer who, m the course of time, became second in importance only to the emperor him self.9 Each of these soldiers, or praetoriani, received double the pay of the ordinary soldiers in a legion. But in order to avoid the appearance of military despotism, Augustus kept oky tkee of these cohorts m the city, while the rest were scattered over the towns of Italy, until Tiberius, pretendkg that they were ne cessary for the safety of Bome, drew them all to the city, where they were kept k a fortified camp called castra praetoria. The whole of the military forces, over which Augustus had the supreme command, amounted to about 450,000 ; and the prin cipal parts of ks navy were stationed in the ports of Misenum and Bavenna. In order to keep peace in the countries wkch had been subdued by force, it became necessary to keep standkg armies in them, especially in the distant provinces of Spain, on the Ekne, the Danube, and Eupkates ; and the stanffing camps (castra stativa) in wkch the troops were stationed, were, in many cases, in the course of time, changed into towns. In B.C. 27, Augustus made an arrangement with the senate, by wkch the provinces were divided between him and the senate. Those wkch were assigned to the senate (provinciae senatoriae or populi) were governed by persons appointed by the senate every year, but without the imperium, skce Augustus kmself had the proconskar imperium k all the provinces ; they therefore had neither the power of levying armies nor of carrying on a war, and were commoky designated proconsuls, though they might never have been invested with the conskskp. The provinces wkch were given to the emperor (provinciae Caesareae), were governed by persons whom Augustus himself chose to appomt ; and the term of then office also depended upon ks discretion. They 9 Sueton. Aug. 46, 49; Ta.at.Ann. iv. 5 ; Dion Cass. Iii. 24."], [581, "THE PROVINCES, ETC. 561 bore the title legati Caesaris, or Augusti, to which pro praetore was sometimes added. In tks division of the provinces, Augustus took care that those wkch required a military force for then protection were reserved for him, while the more peacefk pro vinces, hi wkch there was no occasion for keeping armies, were left to the senate. This arrangement, on the whole, remained in force down to the time of Constantine, though it wokd seem that sometimes the emperor made an exchange of one province for another with the senate. The government of Augustus ex ercised a most beneficial influence upon the provinces, and hence forth then fate was kcomparably better than it had been under the republic, for the governors now received salaries from the state, and a very strict superintendence was kept over them. Accordingly some of the provinces, especially those in wkch no armies were stationed, now entered upon a period of increasing prosperity. Egypt, which was one of the greatest consequence to Eome, on account of its being one of the principal places from which she drew her supplies of corn, was governed m a peculiar manner. The emperor usually appointed a Eoman eques, who was kvested with almost regal power ; and all other eqktes, as well as senators, were forbidden to visit Egypt, perhaps to prevent the inhabitants of the country from being excited to revolt, wkch would have produced very serious conse quences both for Eome and Italy. These arrangements regarding the provinces were necessarily followed by a change k the admikstration of the finances, wkch had ktherto belonged to the senate alone. The civil wars had exhausted the public treasury, and the assignment of the public lands in Italy to the veterans had deprived the state of a con siderable portion of its revenues. The division of the provinces was now made on these terms : \u2014 the income derived from the provinces of the senate went into the public treasury (aera rium), and out of it the senate had to pay the current expenses ; but the revenue derived from the Caesarean provinces went into the treasury of the emperor (fiscus, not to be cokounded with the emperor's private purse), and out of it the armies were paid. b b 3"], [582, "562 HISTORY OF ROME. AU the domain land k the provkces, whether they belonged to the senate or the emperor, was regarded as the property of the emperor, who derived the income from it, and might dispose of it at ks pleasure. But besides these, there were several other sources from wkch a considerable revenue flowed kto the fiscus ; such as the tax levied on legacies and kheritances (vicesima liere ditatum), the excise duties on all goods exposed for sale (centesirna rerum venalium), the tax levied on persons livkg m celibacy (uxorium), and others. At a later time the aerarium was com pletely swallowed up by the fiscus, and the latter then became the oky public treasury, so that the whole of the finances of the empire was under the control of the emperors. The improvement of morality, and the kcrease of the free popkation, likewise engaged the attention of Augustus, who made great efforts to introduce a better feering among the people. In b.c 17, a law was passed to prevent adktery, by wkch heavy penkties were inflicted, not oky on the seducer, but also upon the conkvkg party. Another law, mtended to mtroduce a better regkation of marriage (de maritandis ordinibus), was passed the year after ; and in B.C. 9, there followed the celebrated lex Pa.pia Poppaea, a knd of amendment of, and supplement to, the preceding one : it derived its name from Papius Mutilus and Poppaeus Secundus, who were consks m that year. Tks law not oky regkated and encouraged matrimony, and endeavoured to get rid of concubinage, but even conferred certain privileges on those who were fathers of at least tkee children (jus trium liberorum); though in later times these privileges were sometimes granted as a personal favour to persons who had no right to claim them. All these and many more regkations were un questionably well meant, but they did not produce much im provement, for the evils against wkch they were directed can oky be eradicated gradually. Augustus also made very useftd provisions for preventing famme in the city : he promoted com merce and industry, made public roads, and executed several other public works of great utility. The large sums of money which were thus put into circkation gave a fresh impkse to"], [583, "REGULATIONS OF AUGUSTUS, ETC. 563 trade, by wkch Egypt and the eastern provkces were especially benefited. The reflecting part of the popkation, even if they saw tkough many of the selfish schemes of Augustus, must have acknowledged that his admkistration was productive of great blessmgs to the nation : the thoughtless popkace, on the other hand, were so much taken up with the amusements, games, and public spectacles provided for them, and were kept m such good humour by the frequent ffistributions of corn, that they entirely forgot the loss of political freedom, and willingly served him who fed and amused them so well. But notwithstandkg the great caution with wkch Augustus acted, the mildness with wkch he rked, and the care with which he kept out of sight every tkng that might suggest the idea of despotism, severk conspiracies, wkch were from time to time formed agknst ks life, reminded km that there were still some persons in whom the love of republican government was not yet become extinct. The first attempt was made in B.C. 30, by M. Lepidus, a son of the ex-triumvir : ks plot was formed before the return of Augustus from Actium, but Maecenas, who had the admi nistration of the city, acted with great calmness and prudence, and without causing any sensation, quietly arrested Lepidus, and sent him to Augustus in the east, who put him to death. In b.c 22, Fankus Caepio, A. Murena, and others, formed a similar con spiracy, but tks too was discovered, and those who had taken the lead m it were sentenced to death. The same was the fate of Egnatius Bkus, a senator, who, by the favour of the people, which he had acquired in ks aedileskp, at first defied the wishes of Augustus, and then formed a conspiracy against his life, wkch, like the former attempts, was discovered k time. Cn. Cornelius Cinna, a grandson of Pompey, who was guilty of a similar crime m a.d. 4, was pardoned on the advice of Livia, the wife of Augustus, and even raised to the conskskp. These repeated attempts, however, intimidated Augustus so much, that during the latter period of ks life he never went to a meetkg of the senate without wearing a breast-plate under his dress, to protect km against any sudden attack."], [584, "564 CHAPTEE XLI. WARS OF THE REIGN OF AUGUSTUS. \u2014 HIS FAMILY. \u2014 HIS DEATH. An empire hke that of Eome cokd not remam m the perfect enjoyment of peace, however desirous Augustus might be to preserve it, m order to make the people feel the contrast between ks reign and the latter period of the republic. Under the influence of tks desire he undertook no wars wkch he did not tknk absolutely necessary for the safety of the empire ; and the object of ks campaigns and conquests was oky to secure the frontiers, wkch were then more tkeatened than ever, and to esta blish more kmly the Boman domikon k those countries wkch had been reduced shortly before ks time. The Dacian tribes on the left bank of the lower Danube frequently crossed the river and annoyed the province of Moesia, especially in wkter, when the river was frozen : in order to prevent these inroads, Augus tus, in b.c 27, sent ks legate, M. Crassus, to the Danube. The Eomans were victorious, but then success produced no lasting effect, for the Dacians still continued to repeat their incursions ; and Eome was unsuccessfk m her attempt to gam a firm footkg north of the Danube. In the same year Augustus himself set out for Gak, ktend ing, it is said, to go to Britak ; but he turned aside, and went kto Spam. He directed ks course against the Cantabri and Astures, in the north of the penkska, it bekg ks object to sub due all Spam, and to make m that part of the world the ocean the boundary of the empire. The war agakst these warlike tribes lasted for some years, and Augustus did not return to Eome till b.c 24, when ks enemies submitted and gave hostages. Durkg tks campkgn Augustus founded severk towns in Spam,"], [585, "WARS UNDER AUGUSTUS. 565 the most important of wkch were Augusta Emerita (Merida), and Caesar Augusta (Saragossa). Two years later the Cantabri agak revolted, but were finally subdued, in B.C. 19, by Agrippa, who destroyed the flower of the nation. About the same time, B.C. 24, Aelius Gallus, the governor of Egypt, undertook an expedition into Arabia Felix, wkch how ever turned out a complete failure ; for kseases broke out among ks troops ; and bekg led by ks gkdes on round-about ways into the most dangerous parts of the wilderness, he was in the end obliged to return without having effected any tkng. The manner in which he had allowed kmself to be misgkded is clear from the fact, that he effected his return in sixty days, while he spent six months m the expedition into Arabia. This unsuc cessfk enterprise encouraged Candace, queen of the Etkopians of Meroe, to invade Egypt, in b.c 22. She ravaged the country, and conquered the Eoman garrisons of several towns ; but C. Petrokus, who had succeeded Gallus as governor of Egypt, de feated her in her own country, kter she had sustained a severe loss. Augustus, to whom she applied for mercy, did not deprive her of her kkgdom : he even relieved her from the tribute wkch Petrokus had demanded of her. Free commerce with the interior of Africa was secured by a victory wkch L. Cornelius Balbus, the governor of the province of Africa, gamed over the Gara mantes, for wkch he was honoured, k B.C. 19, with a triumph. In the mean time an event occurred in the east wkch seems to have filled with joy the heart of every Boman. Soon after Augustus' return from Spam, Tiridates, kng of Barthia, was driven from ks kkgdom by Pkaates. The exiled kng took refuge at Eome, but Pkaates kso sent an embassy to demand the surrender of Tiridates. Augustus refused to comply with tks request, but consented to restore a son of Pkaates, who had before fallen kto his hands, on condition of Phraates giving back to the Eomans the standards wkch had been taken by the Partkans m the unfortunate campaigns of Crassus and M. Antony. Tks demand was complied with, in B.C. 20, because Phraates"], [586, "566 HISTORY OF ROME. was afraid of encountering the Boman arms, Tiberius being at the time engaged in restoring Tigranes to ks kingdom of Arme nia. Augustus was at this time in Samos, where he spent the winter, as he had done the year before ; and when the standards arrived, ks vakty was so much gratified, that he struck medals to commemorate the event, and afterwards caused the standards to be hung m the temple of Mars Ultor which he built at Eome. Another very flattering circumstance happened while he was staykg at Samos : there arrived ambassadors from the Scytkans, and from an Indian kng, Pandion, with presents, to solicit the friendskp of Augustus, wkch the Indians seem to have endea voured to obtam even before, while Augustus was yet k Spam.1 When the emperor left Samos, an Indian gymnosopkst accom panied km to Athens, and there burnt himself alive. As Augustus was returning to Eome, he met Virgri, who was on a journey to Asia ; but being taken ill, Virgri returned with the emperor from Athens to Brundusium, where he died in October, B.C. 19. Many parts of the Alps were still inhabited by free and independent tribes, and so long as they were not subdued Italy cokd not be safe. In b.c 25, while Augustus was yet engaged in Spam, a war against the Alpine tribes was commenced by an army under Terentius Varro, who began ks operations by a cam paign against the Salassi k the Graian Alps. They were sub dued with great loss, the Eoman general having sold 36,000 men into slavery; and for the protection of Italy, the town of Augusta Praetoria (Aosta) was founded. It seems that tks defeat stirred up all the nations, north of the Alps, on the upper Ekne and the Danube. The commotions in Gak were suppressed by Agrippa : but M. Lollius, a greedy legate on the Ekne, provoked the Germans khabitkg the eastern bank of the river: k consequence of wkch rile Sigambri, Usipetes, and Tencteri, crossed the Ekne, and defeated the Eomans k b.c 16, probably in the neighbourhood of the modern town of Xanten. Augustus, who entertaked the greatest apprehensions m regard to these 1 Oros. vi. 21."], [587, "WARS UNDER AUGUSTUS. 567 commotions, went kmself to Gak, and remained there until B.C. 13, for the purpose of regkating the affairs of the country, and of making the necessaiy preparations for securing the western banks of the Ekne. On ks return to Bome, he intrusted the protection of those countries to Drusus, the son of ks wife Livia by her first husband. Up to tks time Drusus and ks brother Tiberius had been engaged in a war k Noricum, Eaetia, and Vmdericia, and had subdued all the Alpine tribes, even those riving in the most secluded valleys, so completely, that hence forth we hear of no further attempt on their part to shake off the Eoman yoke.2 During that war the Eomans founded Augusta Vindericomm (Augsburg) in the south of Germany. When Drusus proceeded to the Ekne, Agrippa contkued the operations in Pannonia ; for the emperor's plan was to secure all the country between the Alps and the Danube, and when Agrippa died, in b.c 12, Tiberius continued the war in Pannonia, and afterwards against the revolted Dalmatians, and ravaged the country of the Scordiscans in a frightfk manner. No sooner had Drusus undertaken the command on the lower Ekne, than he began to form the plan of subdkng Germany, probably more with a view to crush that nation, than with the intention of gaikng a permanent footkg in a country wkch pro mised little booty, and was almost impassable to Eoman armies on account of its immense forests and marshes. Drusus accordkgly allied himself with the Batavi and Frisians, and having by means of a canal (fossa Brusi) joked the Ekne and Yssel, he sailed into the aestuary Flevus (Zuidersee), and thus arrived in the Northern or German Ocean. After takkg possession of some islands, and the town of Burchana (Borcum), at the mouth of the Ems, he was obliged, by the approach of winter, to return. In the spring of B.C. 11, he opened ks campaign by crossing the Ekne, and penetrated into the country of the Ukpetes, whom he subdued. He then attacked the Sigambri, and advanced 2 Pliny, Hist. Nat. iii. 24, who quotes an inscription naming all the tribes that were subdued in this war."], [588, "568 HISTORY OF ROME. into the country of the Chemsci as far as the river Weser, but there the approach of winter again obliged lrim to retrace ks steps. As he was proceekng towards the Ekne he had to fight a severe battle, in wkch he came kto great danger. However, that he might not be obliged to give up the conquered country ktogether, he founded the fortress of Aliso, near the sources of the Lippe, and leaving behind lrim a strong garrison returned to the Ekne. In the year following, the war was contkued against the Sigambri and Bructeri with varying success. The Chatti then also rose against the Eomans ; but, m b.c 9, Dmsus marched into their territory, and having subdued them, ad vanced tkough the country of the Cherusci, even as far as the river Elbe, the left bank of wkch was mhabited by the Longo bardi (Lombards) ; but he did not cross the river. Want of provisions compelled km to retreat : on ks way back, he fell from ks horse, and having injured himself very severely, ked thirty days after, not far from the banks of the Ekne. His brother Tiberius, on hearing of the accident, hastened to his assistance : he found him still alive, but Drusus expired soon after ; and Tiberius then led ks brother's army back to Gak, and accompaked ks corpse to Eome. Tiberius was now appokted to the command of the forces of Drusus ; and, k B.C. 8, he crossed the Ekne to continue the operations of ks brother. But the Germans, with the exception of the Sigambri, sent ambassadors to sue for peace. The emperor refused to negotiate with them on any other terms than then absolute submission. Many Germans, with then ckefs, then came to the Eoman camp, where they were treacherously arrested, and distributed as hostages among the towns of centrk Gak. The Sigambri now rose in perfect fury agakst their faitkess enemies, but Tiberius gamed a decisive victory over them, and transplanted 40,000 Sigambri and Suevi to the left bank of the Ekne. Notwithstanding these achievements, the Eomans were as yet unable to make Germany a tributary province.3 3 Veil. Pat. ii. 97 ; Tacit.

In b.c 6, Tiberius, indignant at the conduct of his wife Julia, and the distinctions conferred upon her sons by Agrippa, withdrew to Ehodes ; and the command of the legions on the lower Ekne was undertaken by Domitius Ahenobarbus, the grandfather of the emperor Nero, a bold but at the same time a very prudent man. He retained the command for severk years, and penetrated even beyond the river Elbe, into the country of the Semnones, to wkch no Eoman had yet advanced. But Augustus forbade his successors ever agak to cross the Elbe, in order not to stir up the tribes that dwelt beyond it. Domitius was succeeded by M. Vkicius. In a.d. 2, Tiberius, after a stay of upwards of seven years, returned from Ehodes to Eome ; he was adopted by Augustus k a.d. 4, and in the year following again undertook the command of the legions on the Ekne. He began ks campaign by the reduction of the Bructeri between the rivers Lippe and Ems, and renewed his connections with the Cherusci, wkle his variant and prudent legate, Sentius Satur nkus, attacked the Chatti from the upper Ekne. As Tiberius was advancing as far as the Elbe, a Eoman fleet sailed from the mouth of the Ekne through the German Ocean to the mouth of the Elbe ; it then sailed up the river, and joined the army of Tiberius. The Eomans now defeated the Germans m a hard-fought battle, and the country between the Bkne and the Weser was then constituted a Eoman province. Stationary camps and settlements were accordmgly established m the country, which, in regard to civilisation, were beneficial to the barbarians, between whom and the Eomans a friendly intercourse was now opened. Many of the Germans entered the Boman armies, and some of their chiefs were honoured, not oky with the Eoman franckse, but with the rank of equites. As peace was now restored in that part of the country, Tiberius, in a.d. 6, deternrined to direct ks forces against"], [590, "570 HISTORY OF ROME. Maroboduus, king of the Mareomanm.

Tiberius now formed a plan of attackng km on two sides ; ks legate, Sentius Saturmnus, marched through the country of the Chatti towards Bohemia, while Tiberius kmself set out with ks legions from Ulyricum. When the two armies had approached each other witkn the distance of oky a few days' marches, Tibe rius was informed of a revolt of the Pannokans and Dalmatians, wkch suddenly compelled him to give up the contemplated war against Maroboduus, lest, as he had reason to fear, the insur gents shokd mvade Italy. He accordingly concluded peace with Maroboduus,4 and hastened to Parmoka, where two persons of the name of Bato were at the head of tks formidable msur rection, who had already commenced ravaging Macedoka. In a.d. 7, Tiberius was joined by an army under Germakcus, but the Eomans were at first unable to subdue the rebels : in the year following the Pannokans and Dalmatians were obliged, by famine and pestilence, to sue for peace. Soon after, however, the war broke out afresh : the Eomans now made desperate efforts, and conducted their operations with tkee armies. The fall of the fortress of Anderion at length obliged the rebels, forsaken by their leaders, to submit to Eome, in a.d. 9.

Quintirius Varus, who had till then been governor of Syria, where he had satisfied ks avarice with a rapacity worthy of a Verres, received the command of the legions stationed in Germany. There ks haughtkess and avarice drew upon lrim the hatred of all, and the aversion was increased by ks rude attempts to introduce the language and customs of the Eomans among the barbarians. A conspiracy accordingly was formed against him, wkch was headed by Armikus, a young Cheruscan ckef, who had received a Eoman education, and had been raised to the rank of an eques, but had at the same time imbibed a strong hatred and contempt of the Eomans. He commanded at the time a detachment of Cherusci in the army of Varus, and having caused an ksurrection of the Germans k a distant part of the country he prevailed upon Varus to set out agakst the rebels. As the preconcerted msurrection broke out m several places at once, Varus scattered ks forces, and was in the end obliged to retreat.

The year after tks defeat, Tiberius again undertook the com mand against the Germans, in which he was accompaked by Germakcus, the promising son of Iris brother Drusus.

In this manner the reign of Augustus came to its close. He had been successful tkoughout in the establishment of ks power, which, towards the end of his rife, was as safe as if he had been born on the tkone ; and with the exception of the German war, all his military undertakkgs, whether conducted by himself or ks lieutenants, had been crowned with success.

But she succeeded nevertheless in preserving the attach ment of Augustus to the end of his rife ; and while she connived at ks foibles, she exercised over him an almost unlimited power, especially during ks latter years. M. Marcellus, the son of Augustus' sister Octavia, by C. Claudius Marcellus, was a young man of the highest promise, who enjoyed the esteem not oky of his own relatives but of the whole Boman people. His favour with Augustus was so great that he adopted km, and gave km ks daughter Julia in marriage ; and the generk belief at Eome was that Marcellus wokd succeed Augustus. These marks of favour irritated Agrippa, the friend of Augustus, to such a degree that he withdrew from Eome ; nor kd he return, till a premature death had cut short the career of Marcellus, k B.C. 23, k the age of twenty. The death of Marcellus, which was believed, though perhaps without reason, to have been accelerated by Livia, tkew the whole of the Eoman world into the deepest grief. His widow, Julia, was now obliged to marry Agrippa, whom Augus tus seems then to have fixed upon as ks successor. Julia became by him the mother of Caius Caesar (born B.C. 20) and Lucius Caesar (born B.C. 17), who were both adopted by Augustus, and at an early age raised to the kghest honours and distinctions. When Agrippa died, in B.C. 12, Livia's son Tiberius was forced, agakst his will, to abandon ks wife Vipsaka Agiippka, and to marry Julia, who had aheady become notorious for her dissolute conduct, though her father seems to have been unaware of it. But Tiberius, being dissatisfied no less with the wife forced upon him than with the distinctions heaped upon her sons, Caius and Lucius Caesar, withdrew in B.C. 6 to Ehodes, where, under the pretence of literary pursuits, he spent upwards of seven years k retirement, and where he probably formed those habits of dark reserve and mistrust which characterise his later years.

It was suspected at Eome that the death of both had been occasioned by Livia, in order to secure the succession to her son Tiberius, who now returned to Eome : tkough her influence he was adopted by Augustus, and obtamed the tribunician power for ten years. Tiberius himself was at the same time obliged to adopt Drusus Germanicus, the son of ks late brother, Drusus Nero.

There it was solemky burnt in the Campus Martius, and his ashes were deposited in the mausoleum wkch he himself had built as a burial-place for the members of ks family. Augustus has pronounced judgment upon kmself k the question he put to ks friends on ks death-bed, for an accom plished actor undoubtedly he was, and a great part he played. Public opikon k ks own time praised him as a wise statesman and a mild ruler, and with justice, for the empire under him enjoyed a period of great peace and prosperity, and many of the wounds inflicted on it during the civd wars were heked : although wars were carried on upon the frontiers, the body of the empire had never enjoyed so long and uknterrapted a time of peace. But if we turn away from the effects and kquire into the motives of ks actions, ks conduct appears k a different light. Previous to ks victory at Actium he had been cruel, faitkess to ks friends, selfish, and m many mstances cowardly : after that event, it seems that ks own fears compelled km to strive to deserve the affection of ks people ; and supported by ks friends, he learned to appear good, even when he was dif ferently kcrined. But, admitting that none of ks good actions"], [596, "576 HISTORY OF ROME. sprang from a noble sok, and that ks whole life was a series of hypocrisies, still it cannot be deked that the character wkch he was obliged to assume in order to gain his end was the source of mcalckable good both to Eome and the world. He was temperate even to abstinence, and averse to pomp and personal display : if he did not always exercise a proper con trol over ks own passions, he yet did all that he cokd to improve the moral conktion of the Eomans. He has the un ksputed merit of havkg introduced a better order and a more perfect orgaksation into the unwieldy mass of the empire. His reign derives additional lustre from a comparison with the cruelties, vices, and imbecilities of those who succeeded him \u2022 and it will ever remak one of the most remarkable periods in the kstory of man ; for it is the age in which was first formed and consolidated that system of government and admikstration wkch has detemrined the character of European civilisation."], [597, "577 CHAPTER XLII. THE EMPEROR TIBERIUS. HIS WARS.\u2014 SEJANCS AND HIS INFLUENCE.\u2014 TYRANNY OF TIBERIUS, AND HIS DEATH. When Augustus died, Tiberius was fifty-six years old. In his early youth his education had been conducted with great care, though there was no prospect of ks ever becoming the successor of Augustus, until the death of C. and L. Caesar, the sons of Agrippa and Julia. During the whole period from the time that he arrived at the age of manhood down to the death of Augustus, he showed great activity and talent, whether at the head of an army or in the council, whereby he attracted considerable attention. He had, however, a strong inclination to vice, though by ks great power of dissimkation he suc ceeded m keeping it concealed. This circumstance made him extremely reserved and mistrustftd to everybody, wkch disposi tion increased with his years. The withdrawal of Tiberius to Ehodes so much offended Augustus, that he afterwards refused km permission to return, and even allowed persons to speak of him with disrespect, without resenting it ; but Livia nevertheless prevailed upon her husband to allow km to come to Eome, as soon as C. and L. Caesar were dead. During the period wkch then followed, Tiberius carried on great and important wars in Germany, Pannoka, and Dalmatia. Augustus in ks will ap pointed him heir of two-thirds of ks property ; and though no formk steps had been taken to secure the succession to Tiberius, yet all secret preparations to that effect havkg been made by Livia, the praetorian cohorts were at once prevailed upon to take then oath of allegiance to him. Even before Tiberius went to c c"], [598, "578 HISTORY OF ROME. Bome, he gave orders to murder Agrippa Postumus, who was living in exile, and who, being the oky surviving son of Agrippa and Jkia, might have put forth some claim to succeed his grand father. There can be httle doubt that Livia instigated Tiberius to tks murder. When Tiberius arrived at Eome from Nola, he gave a true specimen of ks character ; for he who knew no fear on the field of battle was always in dread of some secret enemy, and was afraid to say or do tkngs at Eome by wkch he might com promise kmself. His great object was to take formk possession of the sovereignly ; and yet, bekg afraid of the senate, he de clined accepting the imperium when it was offered to him : he thus obliged the senate to entreat him to accept for the public good that which formed in reality the highest object of ks ambi tion. The reign of Tiberius, from a.d. 14 to a.d. 37, if we except the German war, is less remarkable for lkritary exploits than for the tyrankeal mode in wkch he governed, and for the political changes which he introduced. We shall kst give an outline of the wars which were carried on m ks reign. In the very year in which he obtaked the imperik kgmty, formidable insurrections broke out among the legions in Panno ka and on the Ekne. In the former country the soldiers had reason to complak, because they had been kept in their camps longer than they were required by law. Tiberius was obliged to yield to their demand : then service was lightened, and the ad vantages wkch they were to have at the expiration of then period of service, were secured to them ; but the leaders of the insurgents were put to death. Among the legions on the Ekne, Tiberius was very unpopkar ; and as soon as they were ikormed of the death of Augustus, theyr called upon their commander, Germanicus, to undertake the government of the empire. Ger makcus was the adopted son of Tiberius, and possessed the love and admiration of his troops, but he nobly and generously refused the offer ; and having quieted the soldiers, he led them from Castra Vetera (Xanten) against the Marsians in Westphalia."], [599, "WARS UNDER TIBERIUS. 579 In the year following he penetrated into the country of the Chatti, and saved Segestes, the father-in-law of Armikus, who had always been a friend of the Eomans, and was now besieged by Armikus. Thusnelda, the wife of the latter, was taken prisoner on that occasion, and afterwards carried to Eome. Ar mikus now exerted all his energy to rouse his people and the neighbouring tribes to a vigorous resistance against their common enemies. Germakcus, dreading to march tkough this most diffi cult country, sailed with a fleet from the mouth of the Ekne to that of the Ems, and thence advanced into the interior of the country ; while ks legate, A. Caecma, set out from Castra Vetera by land, to join the forces of Germanicus. When the Eomans arrived k the place where Varus and his legions had been de feated, Germanicus buried the remains of ks countrymen, wkch were still covering the ground, and then returned to the coast. During ks voyage along the Frisian coast to the mouth of the Ekne, ks fleet suffered severely from storms ; and A. Caecina, who on ks return to Castra Vetera was pursued by the Germans, likewise sustained considerable loss. But Germakcus was not discouraged : in a.d. 16 he crossed the Ekne and advanced as far as the Weser, where, at a place called Idistavisus, he defeated Armikus, and soon after gamed a second and brilliant victory. After having erected a trophy on the field of battle, the Eomans returned to the Ekne \u2014 Germakcus by sea, and the legions by land. Tks return agak was not effected without great loss of skps and men. These victories of Germakcus and his great popkarity amongst ks soldiers excited the fear and suspicions of Tiberius, who was at all times unwilling to give to ks generals an opportunity of kstinguishkg themselves at the head of then- armies. Tiberius therefore resolved to leave the Germans to then internal quarrels, and recalled Germakcus, who in a.d. 17 celebrated a triumph over the Cherusci, Chatti, and Angrivarri, during wkch solemnity it became evident that Germakcus was the darling, not oky of the army, but of the Eoman people. Tiberius therefore sent km c c 2"], [600, "580 HISTORY OF ROME. to the east, where Partka and Armeka were in commotion k consequence of the detk-onement of Vonones, kng of the Par tkans, by Artabanus. At the same time Tiberius sent out Cn. Piso, a personal enemy of Germakcus, as governor of Syria, with secret instructions, it was supposed, to thwart Germanicus. Plancina, Piso's wife, assisted her husband, and annoyed Agrip pina, the wife of Germakcus, who accompaked km k all ks campaigns, wherever she had an opportunity. Germanicus, though well aware of all tks, devoted himself most earnestly to the objects of ks mission : he placed the crown of Armenia on the head of Zeno, made Cappadocia a Eoman province, and left Q. Servaeus beknd in the command of an army in Commagene. Afterwards he satisfied ks noble curiosity and love of knowledge by a visit to the wondrous country of Egypt : he sailed up the Nrie from Canopus to Syene ; but tks excursion gave great offence to Tiberius, since no Eoman of rank was allowed to visit Egypt without the emperor's permission. On ks return to Syria, Germanicus foimd everytkng neglected, and the enmity between him and Piso opeky declared. Soon after, Germakcus was taken ill, and died in the neighbourhood of Antioch, a.d. 19, probably of poison wkch had been adikkstered to km by Piso and his wife. His death was the cause of great grief to every one, except Tiberius, who alone showed no symptom of it. Piso was afterwards accused of the murder of Germanicus, but the investigation was stopped by the sudden death of Piso, wkch was perhaps caused by the command of Tiberius \u2022. he may have dreaded the disclosures wkch might he made ; but the suspicion of Piso's guilt remained unshaken. In a.d. 19, Drusus, the oky son of Tiberius, by Vipsaka, com manded an army on the Danube, which was intended to humble the Marcomankan kng, Maroboduus. Catualda, a young prince of the neighbouring tribe of the Gothones, probably k concert with the Eomans, attacked Maroboduus k his capital k Bohemia, and made himself master of it. Maroboduus now took refuse with the Eomans, and Tiberius permitted him to spend the remainder"], [601, "CONDUCT OF TIBERIUS. 581 of ks life at Eavenna in Itky. The Eomans left Bohemia in the hands of Catualda, who however was soon after expelled from his kingdom, and was ordered by the Eomans to take up his abode at Forum Julium (Frejus) in the south of Gak. About the same time insurrections broke out in Gak, in consequence of the heavy taxes which the people had to pay. In the country of the Treviri, the rebels were headed by Julius Floras, and in that of the Aedk by Julius Sacrovir ; but the legate, C. Sirius, easily subdued the msurgents in a.d. 21, and took possession of Au gustodunum, which had been the prmcipal seat of the war. The peace of the province of Africa was disturbed by the Numidian Tacfarinas, but it was soon restored by C. Junks Blaesus, a nephew of Sejanus, who in a.d. 22 gained a victory over Tac farinas. In a.d. 28 the Frisians, being hriqktously oppressed by the Eomans, revolted, and recovered their independence, the legate L. Aprokus being unable to subdue them. With these exceptions the reign of Tiberius was not disturbed by foreign enemies, and its kstory is almost confined to the emperor's proceedings at home. He well knew that, during the long reign of ks predecessor, the people had gradually lost their interest k political matters, and he cokd therefore without any risk venture to transfer the functions wkch had till then belonged to the assembly of the people, to the senate, wkch at the same time became the kghest criminal court in all offences committed agknst the state. The senate in its abject servility sanctioned everything which the emperor wished ; and the readier it was to carry out ks caprices and arbitrary measures, the further he went in abusing ks power, and the more boldly and opeky he began to carry out ks tyrannical designs. Hitherto the crime of high- treason (crimen majestatis) had been regarded as a crime against the people or the republic ; but Tiberius declared guilty of it every one who either in actkg, or speaking, or writing, should offend the majesty of his person. Tkngs of a similar knd had occurred m the reign of Augustus, but under Tiberius the whole proceed kgs were reduced to a perfect system, the regulations of which"], [602, "582 HISTORY OF ROME. entered into the most nrinute detail. Tks measure called forth at once a host of denouncers (delatores), who formed a sort of secret police against whom no person of virtue or wealth was safe, and who k their turn increased the emperor's timidity, and the suspi cion with wkch he looked upon every one. Many of the best and noblest citizens fell victims to these denouncers ; for the senate gradually got into the habit of condemning every one that was brought before them, and of lookmg to notkng but the emperor's pleasure. During the kst six years of ks reign, thkgs went on pretty eveky, for he felt constrained to assume a certain modera tion in ks conduct : he took great pains with his appearance when he came into public, treated great men with distkction, and kept a strict economy m the finances of the empire ; but after the death of Germakcus, of whom he had been afraid, he gradu ally began to give the reins to ks evil passions. He had no friend whatever, for he knew no one whom he cokd trust ; and the only being for whom he had any regard was ks mother Livia, of whom he stood in awe down to her death, in a.d. 29, though a real affection between them had ceased to exist many years before. One man, however, M. Aelius Sejanus, discovered the means of gaikng ks sovereign's confidence : ks character was very like that of his master. He was appomted prefect of the prae torian guards, and was a man of great tkent and activity ; but ks powers were employed for evil purposes, and he cokd be as servile as he was naturally proud and ambitious. He maintaked himself in ks influential position from a.d. 20 to a.d. 31. He alone knew how to convince the emperor that he cokd follow ks own kclinations with more impukty than he thought for, and he was thus a most convenient adviser for Tiberius. During the period of his kfluence, he was the mstrument of the em peror's despotism in a series of revoltmg crimes and cruelties; nor did Tiberius, who was otherwise extremely jealous, ever attempt to curtari ks powers : they were rendered more for midable to every one by the military force he had at ks com-"], [603, "M. AELIUS SE.IANUS. 583 mand. In order to have ks soldiery ever ready at hand, he pre vailed upon Tiberius, k a.d. 23, to assemble all the praetorian cohorts k the neighbourhood of Eome, where they were stationed in the castra praetoria, wkch formed a knd of citadel of the city. Tks measure was of the most direfk consequences to the future destiny of the empire, as the soldiers gradually learnt that in reality they had all the power in their own hands. A plan was formed by Sejanus to get rid of all the relatives of ks master, and by tks means to secure the succession to himself. In order to gain ks end with perfect safety, he persuaded the emperor, who knew of no enjoyment except that of sensuk lust, to withdraw, m a.d. 26, from Bome to Capua, thence to Nola, and finally to the island of Capreae (Capri), in the bay of Naples, the access to wkch was guarded by a military force. There the tyrant unseen and undisturbed abandoned himself to the most disgusting sensual pleasures, and sometimes amused kmself with iklicting the most cruel tortures upon those whom the senate had condemned. The period at wkch Tiberius withdrew to Capreae, is the beginkng of the most frightfk portion of his reign, for Sejanus now raled at Eome as if he had been the monarch of the empire, and forthwith set about carrying ks plan into effect. Drusus Caesar, the oky son of Tiberius by his kst wife Vipsaka, was the presumptive heir : m cunning and dissrinkation he was not hiferior to ks father ; but as he had distingkshed kmself in the war in Germany, Tiberius showed him marks of great favour. In a.d. 23, Sejanus, who had entered into an adkterous inter course with Livia the wife of Drusus, got rid of km by poison, in order that he might marry Livia. Tiberius, who was ignorant of the cause of his son's death, bore it with that cool equanimity wkch k most cases is a proof of the total absence of natural affection and feeling. Sejanus, unconcerned about everything else, prosecuted ks plan with unremitting zeal ; and the persons agakst whom ks deadly weapons were next directed were those of the family of Germakcus, Agrippka and her tkee sons. In"], [604, "584 HISTORY OF ROME. a.d. 29, Sejanus caused Agrippina and two of her sons, Nero and Drusus, to be exiled : Nero was soon got rid of ; while Agrippina and Drusus, a.d. 33, were killed by starvation. Caius (afterwards the emperor Caligka), the youngest of her sons, alone escaped ; and by his cumring flatteries he even in duced Tiberius to admit him into Capreae. All the friends of the family of Germakcus were put to death by the command of Sejanus, and many made away with themselves that they might not fall into ks hands. The death of Livia, the aged mother of Tiberius, in a.d. 29, at length freed Sejanus from everytkng by which he had hitherto been restrained, and he now acted as if he had been the real sovereign. But ks mcreaskg arrogance at last roused the fear and suspicion of Tiberius ; and when Antonia, the aged mother of Germakcus, opened ks eyes to the conduct of ks favourite, he addressed a letter to the senate, in which he accused Sejanus of kgh treason. When the letter was read, all were filled with delight at the fall of the monster. Macro arrested Sejanus, and the senate, ever ready to obey, condemned him to death. When he was executed, the popkace dragged his body kto the Tiber : all his friends and relatives were put to death under the most cruel tortures, and then property was confiscated. Apicata, the former wife of Sejanus, then revealed Iris murder of the emperor's son Drusus. Macro, a man who had all the vices of Sejanus without any of ks redeeming qualities, and had distinguished kmself k apprehending km and in takng vengeance on ks family, was soon after appomted praefectus praetorio. Macro's rale was as tyrankcal as that of his predecessor, and no citizen was safe : he exercised the same influence over Tiberius, and was as faitkess to km as ks pre decessor had been. The emperor liimself became more mistrustful, misanthropic, and cruel than before. Caius Caesar formed now with Macro a connection of the basest kkd, the object of it being to get rid of Tiberius, who had latterly withdrawn from Capreae to a villa near Misenum, wkch had once belonged to Lucullus. His debauches and perpetual fears had exhausted"], [605, "DEATH OF TIBERIUS. 585 him, and tkown km kto a state of lethargy, from which nobody thought that he would recover, and Caius was forthwith pro claimed emperor. But Tiberius came to life again, and as it was thought that he wokd take terrible vengeance for the hasty proclamation of a new sovereign, Macro, m order to save himself and Caius, caused his aged master to be suffocated with beds and pillows, in March, a.d. 37, when he had reached the age of 78. The news of his death was received at Bome with the greatest joy, and many called out \" Down with ks body to the Tiber.\" In estimating the character of Tiberius, we must distingksh between two periods ; for during his reign he scarcely ever ksplayed any of the great qualities for which he had been dis tino-uished during the earlier part of ks life. After ks accession he became worse and worse, and in ks old age his conduct was perfectly contemptible and disgusting. c c 3"], [606, "586 CHAPTEE XLIII. C CALIGULA. \u2014 CLAUDIUS. Caius Caesar,1 the son of the noble-minded Germakcus and Agrippka, raised the greatest hopes in the breast of every Eoman, for ah expected that he wokd resemble ks father k character, as he did in the lineaments of ks countenance ; and ks accession was hailed by the people with enthusiastic joy. The solkers proclaimed km, and the senate readily conferred the sovereign power upon km, without heeding the will of Tiberius, who had made his own grandson the co-heir of Caius. Caius was now oky 25 years old, and Tiberius, with whom he had ingratiated himself by ks flattery and cunkng servility, had cokerred upon km the kghest distinctions. For some time the enthusiasm of the people appeared to be justified, for ks first actions showed great moderation and even generosity : he recalled many persons from exile, refused to listen to the dela tores, abolished the tax levied on goods exposed for ske, allowed the administration of justice to take its fair course, and even restored the comitia, of wkch the people had been deprived by Tiberius. He further amused the people with splenkd games, though by ks extravagant liberality and ks donations to the people he exhausted the w-ell-stocked treasury which ks pre decessor had left beknd. He performed the duties of an affec tionate relative in solemky burying the remains of his mother and brother who had died in exile, but he forgave with too much indifference all those who had been mstrumental in bringmg about their fall. 1 He is commonly called Caligula, a nick-name wThich he received as a boy in the camp of his father, and which is derived from caligae, a sort of boots worn by the soldiers."], [607, "C. CALIGULA. 587 Tks happy state of tkngs had scarcely lasted eight months, when he was seized with an illness, probably the consequence of his irregkar mode of rivkg, for he seems to have always been, in fact, of a savage and voluptuous disposition, wkch, however, he carefully conceked. In bodily health he recovered, but his mental powers seem to have been destroyed, and from that moment he was an altered man. His actions henceforth were those of a complete madman : he yielded to all the secret and savage passions of ks sok, without any control bekg exercised over them either by himself or others. He immekately ordered Tiberius, the grandson of ks predecessor, to be put to death, alleging that he had wished him not to recover from Iris illness ; and ks own friends, who had vowed their rives for his recovery, were compelled to carry then vows into effect by makng away with themselves. He commanded also ks grandmother Antoka, Macro the prefect of the praetorian guards, and Macro's wife Enka Naevia, to put an end to their rives. His thirst for blood mcreasing with the number of ks victims, murder with km became a matter of pleasure and amusement. But this was not ks only vice : ks cruelty was equalled by ks voluptuousness and obscekty. He had fost rived m an incestuous mtercourse with his sister Drusilla, and when she died, a.d. 38, he wandered about Italy bewailing her loss Like an ksane person, and paying divine honours to her. Afterwards he married Lollia, a woman of immense wealth, whom he soon abandoned ; and in her place he took Caesonia for ks wife, who contrived to retain her influence over him. But ks licentiousness and prokgacy were so great, that no Eoman lady was safe against his attacks. He at length went so far k ks madness, as to declare kmself a god ; and he wokd often appear k the streets of Eome in the disgkse of Bacchus, Apollo, Venus, or Diana, and command the people to worskp him. The wektkest Eomans were appomted ks priests, a digkty for wkch they had to pay large sums of money. He even conferred the conskskp upon ks favourite horse Incitatus."], [608, "588 HISTORY OF ROME. The sums of money wkch he squandered surpass almost all belief : one specimen may suffice to show the senseless mamier m wkch he spent it. He ordered a bridge to be constructed between Baiae and Buteori, a distance of upwards of tkee miles, for no other purpose but that he might be able to boast of having walked over the sea as over dry land ; because some astrologer had once declared that there was as little chance of Carigka's succeeding to the tkone, as there was of his walking across the bay. The regular revenues of the empire not being sufficient to afford him the means for his wild schemes, he sold ks own estates by public auction, imposed unheard-of taxes, and had recourse to robbery and every kind of extortion ; k short, there were no means however base and degrading wkch he did not employ for the purpose of getting money. When Eome and Italy were exhausted, being obliged to seek other resources, he marched in a.d. 39, with a large army across the Alps kto Gak, under the pretext of a war against the Germans, but m reality with a view to extort money from the Gaks, the wealthiest of whom were put to death that he might obtain possession of their pro perty. When he came to the Ekne, he ordered some of the Ger mans who served in his body-guard to cross the river and kde themselves : he then caused messengers to bring him informa tion that the enemy was there. When this was done, he suddeky sprang up from ks meal, and with a detachment of ks guards hurried across the liver, cut down some trees, and in the even ing returned with the Germans whom he had found in their kding place, and whom he treated as prisoners of war. In a.d. 40, he set out on an expedition into Britain, and marched to the coast. He then sailed out kto the sea a short distance, and afterwards ordered ks soldiers to collect shells on the beach, wkch he called the spoils of the ocean. After having committed in Gak the most horrible cruelties, he returned to Eome, where ks absurd self-dekcation must have convmced every one of ks makiess. Actors, glaffiators, and prostitutes, were now his favourite companions."], [609, "MURDER OF CALIGULA. 589 A conspiracy had been formed against this monster as early as a.d. 39, by Lentkus Gaetkicus and M. Lepidus, but it was discovered and the two leaders were put to death : at the same time his two sisters, Jkia and Agrippka, were sent into ekle as guilty of adultery, and as privy to the conspiracy. Another plot was subsequently formed against km by some officers of the praetorkn cohorts, a body of troops which, until then, had kept Eome under the most terrific military despotism, and wkch had always been most liberally treated by Caligka. Tks new conspi racy was headed by Cassius Chaerea, Cornelius Sabinus, and others ; and four months after the emperor's return from Gak, on the 24th January, a.d. 41, he was murdered in ks own palace while he was attending the rehearsk of some actors who were to per form in the theatre. His wife Caesoka, and his daughters, were likewise murdered ; and the corpse of the emperor, wkch was oky half burned, was secretly buried by ks friends. Some of ks murderers seem to have been actuated by a repub lican spirit, and this awoke among the senators the fantastic idea of restoring the republic. The matter was gravely and warmly discussed ; but insurmountable difficulties presented themselves, and the senators soon became aware that m reality the praetorian cohorts had all the power in their own hands -. the latter on their part insisted upon being governed by a monarch. During the tumult in wkch Caligka was murdered, Tib. Claudius Drusus Nero, the son of Drusus and Antoka, and the brother of Ger makcus, concealed kmself in the palace from fear of being seized upon by the conspirators ; but being discovered there by the praetorians, they dragged km forth from ks concealment, proclaimed him emperor, took then oath of allegiance to him, and on the following day he was recognised by the senate and people. Claudius was born on the 1st of August, B.C. 10, and had now arrived at the age of 51. He was of a sicky con stitution from ks childhood, and ks own mother is said to have called him a portentum hominis. His mind seems to have been really defective, for all his actions showed a remarkable want of"], [610, "590 HISTORY OF ROME. tact and judgment ; and in consequence of tks natural defect he was ill-treated by ks whole family, who were in fact ashamed of him. Claudius felt tks contempt keeky, and sought comfort and recreation in literary purskts, in wkch he displayed great industry and diligence. His cowardice, and the great timidity wkch overcame him whenever he attempted to do any tkng in public, were the reskts of the Ml-treatment he had experienced k ks early years. It cannot, indeed, be deked that during his reign he committed many acts of cruelty, but they were the consequence of weakness and imbecility rather than of wicked ness or malice, and he certaiky does not deserve the name of a tyrant. Up to the time of ks accession Clauffius had never taken any part in public affairs, though he had several times been invested with the conskskp. On his accession he gave a donation of nearly one hundred pounds to each soldier of the praetorian cohorts, wkch was the ffi-st example of what afterwards became a regkar custom on the accession of a new emperor. His k-st act was the proclamation of an amnesty for all who had attempted to restore the republic ; and oky a few of the murderers of Caligka were put to death. His next measures show the same kkd and amiable disposition, and are a proof that if he had been left alone, or had been guided by honest advisers, ks government wokd have afforded little ground for complaint. But ks naturk timkity being abused and increased by those by whom he was surrounded, led him kto a series of cruel actions, for wkch he is branded k history as a tyrant. He was very unhappy k his marriages. His kst wife, Plautia Urgkakila, by whom he had two chil dren, Drusus and Claudia, was suspected of having made an attempt upon his life, k consequence of wkch she was divorced. He then married Aelia Petka, who was likewise dismissed soon after. At the time of ks accession he was married to ks third wife, the profligate Valeria Messarina. Having been kways shut up witkn the walls of the palace, he had no friends except ks wives and ks freedmen ; and being of an affectionate disposi-"], [611, "591 CLAUDIUS. tion, and feeling the want of unfolding the heart to some one, this gave the persons with whom he rived m daily ktercourse an un limited influence over him. Messarina, and the freedmen Narcissus, Pallas, Calristus, and others, thus persuaded km to put to death many of the most distmgkshed persons of the time ; and the number of then- victims was mcreased, in a.d. 42, on the discovery of a conspiracy wkch had been formed by Ankus Vikcianus, and Camiilus Scribokanus, the governor of Dakiatia. In a.d. 48, Messarina went so far in her profligacy as publicly to solemkse her marriage with C. Sirius, a handsome young Eoman eques. Tks was more than Claudius cokd brook, and he accord kgly ordered her to be put to death. Tkough the ktrigues of ks freedmen he was now induced to marry ks kece Agrippka, a daughter of Germakcus ; a choice worse, if possible, than any of the former ones. Agrippina and Pallas prevailed upon him to set aside ks own son Britannicus by Messarina, and to adopt Nero, Agrippma's son by Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, in order to insure to Nero the succession to the sovereignty. The philosopher Lucius Annaeus Seneca, who had been exiled, was now recalled to educate Nero, and to prepare him for his kgh station. In order to secure the praetorian cohorts, Agrippina caused then prefect, who was favourably disposed towards the ckldren of Messarina, to be removed, and got Burrus Afrakus appointed in his stead. Burrus, who was iktiated m her plans, and was a man of great tkent, undertook, with Seneca, the trainkg of young Nero. At length, when Claudius saw tkough these intrigues and opeky expressed ks dissatisfaction, Agrippina hastened to secure the succession to her son by the murder of her husband. Locusta, a woman well skilled in preparing poisons, was hired by her to prepare a poisoned ffish of muskooms, of wkch the emperor was very fond ; but as it produced oky vomiting, the physician Xenophon, under the pretext of attempting to ease the vomiting, put a quill dipped in poison down the tk-oat of Claudius, wkch caused ks death on the 13th of October, a.d. 54."], [612, "592 HISTORY OF ROME. The government of Claudius, m so far as he was not under the influence of his wives and freedmen, was mild and popkar, and he made several useftd legislative enactments. Besides his literary occupations, he was extremely fond of building ; and several arcktecturk plans, wkch had been devised by ks prede cessors but abandoned as impracticable, were carried out by him. He thus constructed the celebrated Claudian aqueduct (aqua Claudia), formed a new fort with a lighthouse at Ostia, and con ducted the waters of lake Fucinus, by means of a tunnel, into the river Liris. With regard to ks literary productions, we have great reason to regret the loss of these works, though none of them may have had much merit as literary compositions ; but he wrote in so honest and straight-forward a spirit that he was cen sured for it by his own relatives. He composed a kstory of ks own time, memoirs of ks rife, and wrote k the Greek language the kstories of Carthage and of Etruria. During ks reign several wars were carried on hi Britain, Ger many, Syria, and Mauritania, The disputes respecting the suc cession in Partka and Armeka after the death of Artabanus, being artificially fed by the Eomans, led to the Parthian wars, wkch broke out in a.d. 50, and were carried on under Claukus and Nero, the Partkans endeavouring, by all means, to make themselves masters of Armeka. In Germany the war was con tinued from the begmkng of Claudius' reign against the Chauci and Marsians, who were severally defeated by the Eoman legates. After the death of Armikus quarrels also broke out among the Cheruscans and other tribes, of w-kch the Eomans made the most advantageous use, and in which the noblest German families perished. As Itaricus, a son of Armikus' brother Flavius, the oky person of the kkgly family still surviving, rived at Eome, the Cheruscans, in a.d. 47 applied to Claudius for a kng, and he generously sent them Itaricus, reminding him of ks duties towards his own country and people. Itaricus gained con siderable popkarity, but a discontented faction compelled him to take to flight : he was restored by the kd of the Longobardi,"], [613, "WARS UNDER CLAUDIUS. 593 but still the state of the Cheruscans was violently shaken by these commotions. In the same year Domitius Corbido was successful in the north-west of Germany : he subdued the Frisians, and was on the point of makmg an kvasion into the interior of the country, when Claudius ordered him to withdraw ks garrisons from the eastern banks of the Ekne. Corbko accordingly con fined himself to the defence of the left bank, and employed ks soldiers m cutting a canal to connect the Meuse and the Ekne in the neighbourhood of Diisseldorf. In a.d. 50 the capital of the Ubii, in wkch Agrippina had been born, was raised by Claukus to the rank of a colony, under the name of Colonia Agrippka (Cologne) : it remained henceforth the ckef town in lower Germany, and Castra Vetera sank mto insignificance. In a.d. 42 the Mauritakans, .who had revolted the year before, were subdued by the legate Cn. Hosidius, and their countiy was constituted a Eoman province, bekg divided into two parts, the one called Tingitana and the other Caesariensis, each bekg governed by a Eoman eques. No Eoman army had entered Britain smce the days of Julius Caesar, but a noble Britain of the name of Bericus, who had been expelled by ks countrymen, prevailed upon Claudius to undertake the conquest of the island; and accordkgly, in a.d. 43, a Eoman army, under the command of A. Plautius Silvanus, invaded Britain. Claudius kmself followed soon after, but not bekg of a warlike disposition, and having obtained an opportunity of celebrating a triumph, he returned. His legate, however, defeated the Britons on the river Thames, and took then town of Camalodunum. The war contmued for kne years, during wkch Vespasian (afterwards emperor), who commanded one legion and was accompaked by his son Titus, made such progress, that he is said to have fought thirty battles, taken possession of the Isle of Wight, subdued seve ral tribes, and occupied twenty towns. Caractacus, a ckef of the tribe of the Silures, and the valiant defender of British liberty, made the greatest efforts to repel the enemy; but he was overcome by the superior skill of the Eomans : his wife and daughters fell mto"], [614, "594 HISTORY OF ROME. the hands of the conquerors, and his brothers surrendered. He then sought the protection of Cartismandua, queen of the Bri gantes, but she betrayed him, and delivered him up to the Eomans, in a.d. 51. The British ckef and ks family were carried to Bome and exkbited there m sort of triumph ; but Caractacus showed so noble and intrepid a conduct, that Claudius was kduced to pardon him and ks friends. The south-eastern part of Britain was now constituted a Boman province. In the beginkng of ks reign Claudius restored Agrippa to ks grandfather's kkgdom of Judaea and Samaria ; but after Agrippa's death, m a.d. 44, the admmistration of the country was again entrusted to Boman governors, whose acts of oppres sion drove the people to repeated insurrections, wkch at last ended k the destruction of Jeraskem."], [615, "595 CHAPTEE XLTV. NERO. SERV. SULPICIUS GALBA. SALVIUS OTHO. \u2014 A. VITELLIUS. After the murder of Claudius, Agrippina, for a while, kept ks death a secret ; but all at once the gates of the palace were tkown open, and her son Nero was presented by Burrus to the praetorian guards as their master. On being carried to the praetorian camp, and promismg the soldiers rich donations, Nero was proclkmed emperor. The senate confirmed the decision, and the people quietly submitted. Nero was born at Antium, on the 15th December, a.d. 37, and was now oky seventeen years old : he was naturally not devoid of talent and taste, but he had been brought up at a voluptuous court, and k the midst of mtrigues, by ks mother, a woman full of malice and am bition ; he had been trained by Seneca and Burrus, two men ankous to obtam the favour of the court and to accumkate wekth ; and he found kmself, on ks accession, surrounded by a servile people, flattered by the senate and a host of friends who were ready to applaud every folly and every crime, or at least to excuse any thing he might choose to do. Under such circum stances the beginkng of ks reign was not worse than might have been anticipated ; and if ks mcrination to debauchery and his vakty had been checked at a proper time, ks reign might have been happier. The first five years of it, in fact, formed so striking a contrast with the remaikng period, that m later times the quinquennium of Nero was looked upon as one of the most prosperous periods of the empire. During that time Nero reduced the taxes of the provinces, counteracted the love of luxuries, and raised the authority of the senate, while Seneca and"], [616, "596 HISTORY OF ROME. Burrus endeavoured to suppress any dangerous outbreak of ks passions ; but ks ambitious and domineering mother wished to govern, and in some instances actually did so, in her son's name; and as Burrus and Seneca opposed her designs, it became manifest that the struggle must end in the destruction either of Agrippina or her opponents. The jealousy between Agrippina and her son soon broke out into an open quarrel, and she tkeatened to sup port the claims of Britankcus the son of Claudius, and to raise him to the tkone. Nero's fears now drove km to commit a crime wkch at once revealed ks real character : he ordered Britankcus, a boy of scarcely fourteen years old, to be poisoned at an entertainment, at wkch Agrippina herself, and Nero's wife Octavia, the virtuous daughter of Claudius and Messarina, were present. His associates, ks amours with Acte a freedwoman, his lascivious and dissolute habits, and ks excessive fondness for theatrical amusements, henceforth corrupted him more and more. He had never loved ks wife Octavia, and ks aversion to her increased from the moment he became acquainted with the beautifk but dissolute Poppaea Sabina, the wife of ks friend Sal vius Otho, who connived at her conduct, and was easily got out of the way by being made governor of Lusitania k Spam, a.d. 58. Nero's passion for tks woman was probably the cause of ks murdering his mother, for Poppaea Sabina wanted to many him, and as Agrippina was an insurmountable obstacle to this scheme, she prevailed upon him to get rid of her. A plan for tks purpose was devised by Anicetus, the commander of the fleet at Arksenum . Agrippina, under pretence of a reconciliation with Nero, was invited to come to Baiae, and when she arrived she was put on board a boat, which was constructed in such a manner as to fall to pieces at a certain distance from the coast. But Agrippina saved herself by swimming, and went to her villa on the Lucrine lake, where she was assasskated by Nero's command, and with the approbation of Burrus and Seneca. The base and servile senate even degraded itself by congratidating the matricide on the accomplishment of ks feat. Nero was soon after seized"], [617, "CONDUCT OF NERO. 597 with bitter remorse, but he drowned all his better feelings by fresh riots and the most extravagant debauchery, and the flatteries of the senate helped lrim to forget his crime. One of ks favourite occupations-was chariot driving ; but his ambition was to get credit as a musician, an actor, and a poet. After the death of Burrus, probably by poison, and the with ffiawk of Seneca in a.d. 62, Nero began to feel more at liberty : he banished his wife Octavia to the island of Pandataria, where she was soon after murdered, and then married the adulteress Poppaea Sabina. Tigellinus, a most licentious and unprincipled person, being appointed prefect of the praetorian cohorts, as the successor of Burrus, contrived to gam the full confidence of the despot. In a.d. 64, a dreadfk conflagration broke out at Eome, wkch lasted for six days, and in wkch by far the greater part of the city and its monuments became a prey of the flames : it was believed that this destruction was the work of Nero, who wanted to see a vivid representation of the burning of Troy. Tks belief may have originated m a piece of scandal, without any foundation : the emperor, however, tkew all the odium upon the yet obscure sect of the Ckistians, agakst whom he instituted a cruel persecution. Soon after the conflagration he set about re-building the city on an improved plan, and with wider and more regkar streets. The means for carrying out this undertakkg were obtained by oppression, extortion, and robbery. His own palace, called the golden house, was built on a scale of magnitude, and with a splendour, wkch surpass all belief. The idle popkace were kept in good humour by being fed and amused with the spoils of the provinces, wkch were plundered to such an extent that the empire w^as brought to the verge of dissolution. In a.d. 65, Nero's tyranny led to the organisation of a formi dable conspiracy agakst him, wkch was headed by L. Calpurkus Piso ; but it was discovered and betrayed by a freedman, Mili chus, and the discovery was followed by a number of executions. Piso, the poet Lucan, and many others, were put to death ; and"], [618, "598 HISTORY OF ROME. Seneca, who was suspected of being an accomplice, had the favour of being allowed to die by opekng his vems. After this followed the death of Poppaea Sabina : she was with child, and in a fit of brutal passion Nero kcked her, the consequence of wkch was fatk. He now wanted to marry Antonia, a daughter of Clauffius, but as she declined the honour she was put to death; and he then married Statiria Messarina, with whom he had before kept up an adkterous ktercourse, and whose husband he had killed. Virtue, in whatever form she appeared, was an object of the tyrant's fear and hatred, to wkch many of the noblest and most respected per sons fell a sacrifice. In a.d. 66, Tiridates, kkg of Armeka, came to Eome to receive ks crown from the hands of Nero ; and the year after tks solemnity, Nero went to Greece to take part as a cithara player m the great games at Olympia and on the Isthmus. At the Isthmian games he proclaimed the freedom of Greece; but the country had to pay dearly for tks visit of the sovereign, for towns and temples were plundered, and the price of pro visions rose to an enormous height. A singer, whose voice was louder than that of the emperor, was put to death. The aged general Corbulo, one of the few that still deserved the name of a Boman, was summoned in an affectionate letter to come to Greece : he arrived, but when he was informed that Nero had given orders to kill km, he anticipated the tyrant by makkg away with kmself. It wokd be disgusting and tedious to go tkough the long catalogue of Nero's crimes and follies, and we must refer those who wish to become acquknted with all the detari, to Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dion Cassius. In the autumn of a.d. 67, Nero was recalled from Greece by his freedman Helms, whom he had entrusted with the admik stration of the city k ks absence. On ks entermg Bome in triumph he exhibited no less than 1808 crowns, with wkch the flattery of the Greeks had honoured him. Not many months after ks return, in a.d. 68, an msurrection headed by Julius Vindex broke out in Gak, m consequence of the grievous oppres sion to wkch that country had been subjected. Vindex, who"], [619, "DEATH OF NERO. 599 soon had a large army at his command, offered the sovereignty to Servius Galba, who was governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, and was very popkar with the soldiers. As Gkba learnt at the same time that Nero had sent orders to put km to death, he harangued the soldiers agakst the tyrant, and was proclaimed emperor, though he assumed oky the title of legate of the Eqman senate and people. Nero was at Naples when he received the news of the commotion k Gak, but he gave kmself httle concern about it ; when, however, he returned to Eome and was informed of the proclamation of Galba, he was tkown mto a violent fit of passion : the senate declared Galba a pub he enemy. Vergikus Eufus, governor of Upper Germany, being unfavourable to Galba's elevation, marched with an army kto Gak, and bekg supported by a great part of that country laid siege to Vesontio (Besancon). Vkdex came to its relief, and the two generks had an mterview, at wkch an amicable arrangement seems to have been made ; but by some misunder standmg Vindex was killed, whereupon the soldiers proclaimed Vergikus Eufus emperor, but he steadily refused to accept the digkty. Owing to these circumstances Gkba began to lose all hopes, when he received from Bome the unexpected news that the praetorians recognised km as their raler. Nero's ruin was accelerated by a famine wkch was ragmg at Bome, and by the exertions wkch Nero was makkg to raise the means for attackkg his enemies. Nympkdius Sabmus, who with Tigeffinus was the commander of the praetorian cohorts, availed kmself of a report that Nero was gokg to take refuge m Egypt to mduce the praetorians to proclaim Galba. Nero was soon deserted by every body : k the kght he fled from Eome to the house of Phaon, one of ks freedmen, where he spent a whole day in fear and terror ; and when ks pursuers found km, he, with the help of ks secretary Epapkoditus, gave himself a mortk wound, of which he expired on the 9th of June a.d. 68, at the age of 31. With km became extinct the house of the Claudii, wkch had ktherto claimed a sort of right to the imperial digkty, though the"], [620, "600 HISTORY OF ROME. hereditary character of the monarchy had never been legally established. The subsequent rkers and heirs to the throne retaked the titles of Augustus and Caesar ; but the praetorian guards henceforth assumed the right of electing then- sovereign, and the sanction of the senate became a mere ceremony. The legions in the distant provmces also began to feel that they might exercise the same prerogative, and frequently rksed men to the tk-one k opposition to those proclaimed by the praetorian guards. Armeka had fallen mto the hands of the Partkans in the beginning of Nero's reign, and m a.d. 54 Domitius Corbko had been sent there to conduct the war. Tks able generk com pelled the Parthian Vologeses to withdraw from the country; and Tiridates, the brother of Vologeses, who bad been made kkg of Armeka, was expelled in a.d. 58. Two years later Corbko took the towns of Artaxata and Tigranocerta, whereby he became complete master of Armeka, and Nero now cokerred the kngly digkty upon Tigranes ; whereupon Corbko withdrew to Syria, leaving beknd km some troops to protect the new kkg. But in a.d. 62 the affairs of Armeka were agak troubled : the Partkans invaded the country, with the intention of recovering the tkone for Tiridates. Corbko's successor, L. Caesenkus Pae tus, being unable to maintain ks ground was obliged to evacuate Armeka, and Tiridates again ascended the tkone, but under the promise that he himself would go to Bome to obtain the sanction of Nero. Tks took place m a.d. 66. In the early part of Nero's reign, affairs were tolerably quiet on the Eheksh frontier : various usefk works were executed there to prevent the river overflowing its banks, and L. Vetus formed the grand design of uniting by a canal the Saone and Moselle, which wokd at once have opened an unbroken Ike of water commukcation between the Mediterranean and the German Ocean, but ks plan was frustrated by the jekousy of Aelius Gracilis. In Britain, the oppressive yoke of the Eomans and their rapacity called forth an alarming msurrection m a.d. 61."], [621, "601 SER. SULPICIUS GALBA. wlke the governor Suetokus Paurinus was absent on an expe ktion to the island of Mona, for the purpose of destroying that principal seat of the British religion, the people, under their heroic queen Boadicea, took up arms : one Eoman legion was wholly destroyed, and the most important colonies were taken and reduced to ashes. Paurinus speedily returned and defeated the insurgents in a great battle in wkch about 80,000 Britons are said to have fallen. Boadicea put an end to her own life ; but the Eomans were either unable to bring the war to a close, or Petrokus Turpirianus, the successor of Paurinus, preferred a peaceful administration to the labours and toils of war. At the time when Nero was enjoying ks triumphs in Greece the whole nation of the Jews rose in arms against their Eoman oppressors, and the proconsk, Cestius Gallus, with his army, was put to kght ; whereupon Nero appointed Vespasian, who had aheady distingkshed himself in Britain, to conduct the Jewish war with tkee legions ; and made Licikus Mucianus governor of the pro vince of Syria, in a.d. 67. The extkction of the race of the Claudii was followed by dis putes about the succession and by civil wars, since there w-as no one who had any legal claim to the tkone. Servius Skpicius Galba, on bekg informed of ks proclamation and recognition by the senate, came to Bome accompanied by Salvius Otho, the governor of Lusitaka. Galba was descended from an ancient noble family, and had been invested with the highest digkties \u2022 he had been governor of Aquitaka, Africa, Upper Germany, and latterly of Hispania Tarraconensis, of which he had con ducted the admikstration for a period of eight years. He had been a distinguished general and a man of unblemished character ; but he was now at the advanced age of 73, and had come under the influence of his unworthy freedmen. The praetorians had been gamed over to his interest by the promise of rich donatives; but ks avarice, which prompted him to give them with a kg gardly hand, and ks severity in restoring and maintaikng ksciprine among the soldiers, made him extremely unpopkar. D d"], [622, "602 HISTORY OF ROME. The arbitrary manner moreover in wkch he acted under the influence of Iris tkee favourite freedmen, T. Vikus, Cornelius Laco, and Icelus, showed that ks reign wokd not be much better than that of Nero. The legions m Germany and Africa having opeky declared their dissatisfaction with km, he forthwith commanded their generals to be put to death, and appointed A. Vitellius, a noble but vkgar and vicious man, to undertake the command of the legions on the Ekne. There can be no doubt, that by ks unpopular measures Galba had the rek intention of restoring order and discipline, and of domg good service to the empire; but he was bhnd to the real cause of ks unpopkarity -. attributing it to ks old age, and to ks having no heir, he adopted Piso Licikanus, a noble young Eoman, who was to be ks coadjutor and successor. But by tks act he oky increased ks unpopularity ; for when he presented ks adopted son to the senate, and to the praetorians, he neglected to give the latter the donative customary on such occasions. Salvius Otho, the effeminate and contemptible husband of Pop paea Sabina, having hoped to be adopted himself, in ks disap pointment formed a conspiracy with the praetorians, over whom he exercised almost unbounded influence. Tks conspiracy broke out six days after the adoption of Licikanus. Galba, not knowing for some time what to do, at last resolved to meet the rebels ; but as he was crossing the forum he was cut down by some horsemen who had been waiting for km. An attack was also made upon the rife of Licikanus, but the faithfk and courageous centurion, Sempronius Drusus, warded off the deaky blows. Licikanus then took refuge in the temple of Vesta, from wkch, however, he was dragged forth and murdered, and many of Galba's friends shared ks fate. Galba reigned from June a.d. 68 to January a.d. 69. Skvius Otho, who had been proclaimed by the praetorians, was now saluted emperor by the servile senate ; and tkough the blood-stained streets of the city he proceeded to the Capitol to offer up the customary sacrifice. The praetorians, who now"], [623, "SALVIUS OTHO AND A. VITELLIUS. 603 had an emperor of then own choice, assumed even the exercise of the supreme power, for they appokted then- own comman der, and gave the office of praefect of the city to Flavius Sabinus, the brother of Vespasian. Otho was at this time scarcely able to prevent them from makkg a general massacre among the senators, who were suspected of being dissatisfied with their choice. It seems, however, that soon after, he had so far recovered ks power, that he was enabled to distribute rewards and pukshments as he thought fit ; and some of the criminals who had distingkshed themselves in the reign of Nero and had escaped pukshment, such as Tigelrinus, were put to death. In the meantime the legions of the Ekne, wkch were dissatisfied with Galba's ride, proclaimed on the second of January, a.d. 69, then own commander, A. Vitellius, emperor ; and it was in vain that Otho endeavoured by negotiations to prevent the outbreak of a civil war. A dreadfk struggle now ensued between Otho and Vitellius. The latter sent ks legates, A. Caecina and Fabius Valens, with an army across the Alps, with wkch they occupied the country between the Alps and the river Po. Otho sent his army under the command of his brother Titianus against the enemy : he was victorious in several engagements, but lost the decisive battle near Bedriacum, between Verona and Cremona. Otho was advised by ks friends not to despair, but to await the arrivk of the legions from Moesia ; but it was all in vain, for a few days after the battle, on the 16th of April, a.d. 69, he made away with kmself at Brixelhim, adviskg ks friends to become reconciled to Vitellius. Otho's army now surrendered to Vitellius, a man who was perhaps not of bad disposition, but one of brutal manners and an almost beastly voracity. With his legions, wkch on their march indkged in the wildest excesses, Vitellius now came to Eome, where he was recogksed by the senate and people. He had spent all ks life in base vkgarity, and was devoid of mental energy and resolution, squandering ks own property no less than that of others upon the soldiers, who were made to believe D d 2"], [624, "604 HISTORY OF ROME. that what they received was oky then due. He conkved at every thing they did, and was wholly unconcerned about the affairs of the empire. His contemptible conduct soon excited general indignation, and the legions of Syria, Judaea, Moesia, and Pannonia, declared against km. Vespasian, who was con ducting the war against the revolted Jews with great success, was urged by Mucianus the governor of Syria, and by Titus, to assume the sovereignty ; and during ks stay at Alexankia he was proclaimed emperor by Tiberius Alexander, the governor of Egypt. He forthwith prepared for war against Vitellius, leaving his son Titus to conduct the siege of Jerusalem. Antonius Primus, the commander of the legions on the Danube, and a staunch supporter of Vespasian, without waiting for the new sovereign's commands marched with ks army mto Italy. In the neighbourhood of Bedriacum he met the army of Vitellius, who himself remained at Eome, unable to make up ks mind what course to pursue. Antokus Primus, though ks forces were far inferior in number to those of ks enemy, gained a decisive victory, and the town of Cremona was plundered and reduced to ashes. He then slowly advanced towards Eome, and all the towns on ks way surrendered : Vitellius was abandoned by all except the praetorians and the populace of Eome. Flavius Sabkus, Vespasian's brother, was compelled to take refuge in the Capitol. When the hostile army arrived, a frightfk massacre took place m the city : the Vitellians stormed the Capitol and murdered Sabinus, and the Capitolke temple was destroyed by fire. But the praetorian camp being taken by Antokus Primus, Vitellius was dragged fortri from ks palace and mur- dered in a brutal manner, on the 20th of December, a.d. 69, after a reign of scarcely eight months. All tks happened at Eome, in the absence of Vespasian, who still continued his stay at Alexandria : the affairs of Eome were regkated by Mucianus and Vespasian's son Domitian."], [625, "605 CHAPTEE XLV. T. FLAVIUS VESPASIANUS. \u2014 TITUS. \u2014 T. FLAVIUS DOM1TIANUS. Vespasian, who now ascended the tkone as the first of the Flavian family, was the true restorer of the state ; and, with all ks faults, he was the very person that Eome re quired. He was a man of humble origin, active, industrious, and simple in ks habits : he was kso an able general, and had risen without any one being able to charge km with extortion or rapacity in the provkces where he had been employed, a circumstance wkch is the more remarkable as he is skd to have been fond of money. He enjoyed the esteem of all the soldiers. He did not arrive at Eome until the end of the summer a.d. 70, when he found the praetorians subdued by the influence of Mucianus. Domitian, who m the mean time exercised the imperial power in ks father's name, had committed several acts of tyranny and cruelty in taking vengeance on his personal enemies, and had given proofs of what Eome might expect from him shokd he ever come to the tkone. Although Vespasian had been chosen by the armies, he yet like his pre decessors received the imperium from the senate. He at once set about restoring disciprine, excluded unworthy persons from the senate, deprived severk eqktes of their rank, and raised the most illustrious men from the provkces, as weU as from Italy, to the places wkch had thus become vacant. By tks measure Eome virtually ceased to be the exclusive mistress of the world, inasmuch as distingkshed provincials also obtaked a share in the government. He further watched over the proper administration of justice, suppressed the odious class of denouncers, stopped the triks for high-treason agakst the person of the sovereign,"], [626, "606 HISTORY OF ROME. and, above all, put an end to the profligacy of the kgher classes. His economy k the management of the finances often ap proached to parsimony, but the state at that period required large sums for its maktenance, and for the preservation of its security on the frontiers ; at the same time, however, he was riberk whenever the public good required it. In order to mcrease the revenues, he restored several countries to then former condition of provinces, wkch had been declared free by Nero, and kso restored or increased tolls and taxes. He must have spent enormous sums upon the rebuildmg of the Capitolke temple, the construction of the gigantic ampktheatre, or Colosseum, which even m its rains excites the wonder and admiration of the beholder, and the building of the Temple of Peace and the public library. He was the kst who appointed public teachers of rhetoric, with an annual salary of 100 sesterces. In private rife he was very condescending, fond of wit and cheer ful company, and ks example, together with severk enact ments wkch he made agakst the disgusting habits of the wekthy Eomans, produced a great change in then mode of of riving : what he was deficient in were the feelings of a gen tleman, and of a person of education : he himself aspired to no intellectual distinction, and had a skgkar dislike to all per sons who were any tkng beyrond what may be called practical men. Hence arose ks aversion to pklosophers, more espe cially to the Stoics, who, with their republican sentiments and unreserved expression of opikon, seemed to him little better than revolutionists. It was k consequence of tks feeling that Helvidius Priscus, the son-in-law of the noble Paetus Tkasea, who from the kst had indkged in vehement mvectives agakst the emperor, was put to death in a.d. 74, though contrary to the will of Vespasian : k the same year all Stoic and Cyme plkosophers were expelled from Eome. The first year of Vespasian's reign is remarkable for the capture of Jerusalem, by his son Titus. It was defended by a triple wall, and by a host of 600,000 men; but owing to the"], [627, "607 WARS UNDER VESPASIAN. party spirit prevkring in the city, it fell mto the hands of the Eomans on the 2nd of September, a.d. 70 : upwards of a million of Jews are said to have perished ; and then- city was destroyed. The Jews being forbidden to re-build it, lost their independence for ever : they were scattered over the whole of the Eoman empire, and every one of them had to pay an annuk tax of two drachmae. Out of the money thus raised, the Capi toline temple was restored : the arch wliich wras erected at Bome, to commemorate the victory of Titus over the Jews, still exists, and bears witness to that memorable event. Before Vespasian's arrival at Eome, a formidable insurrec tion, headed by Claudius Civilis, broke out in the country of the Batavi between the rivers Meuse and Wak. The Batavi were joined by German tribes, and then- example was fol lowed by the Lmgones and Trevrii, under then- leaders Clas sicus and Julius Tutor. They even compelled a Eoman legion in Gak to declare itself m favour of the independence of Gak. The period of anarchy at Eome had been well chosen by the insurgents ; but the accession of Vespasian, and the energetic measures wkch he took, deprived them of tks advantage. Peti lius Cerialis was sent against the rebels, and after several engage ments, in which he fought bravely, he kst subdued the Treviri, and then compelled Civilis, after a two-fold defeat, to sue for peace. The Batavi now submitted to Eome, and henceforth were obliged to pay their tribute as before. In the year following, a.d. 71, Cerialis obtained the adminis tration of Britak : he was accompaked there by Cn. Julius Agricola, the son-k-law of the historian Tacitus, who had, as legate, the command of one legion. Disturbances had taken place among the Brigantes, but they were soon subdued. In a.d. 77, Agricola himself obtained the admikstration of Britain, which he retkned until a.d. 85. During that period he not only conquered all England, but the south of Scotland as far as the Firth of Clyde and the Frith of Forth. He carried ks victories even into the Highlands of Scotland, though without"], [628, "608 HISTORY OF ROME. permanently subjecting the country to Bome. His administration of Britain was less disturbed by insurrection than that of ks predecessors; for by the prudence, fairness, and justice of ks measures, he not only conciliated the Britons, but rendered the Eoman dominion endurable by them. There can be no doubt that the reign of Vespasian was thorougky beneficial to the Eoman world ; and though he committed some acts wkch can scarcely be excused, still ks conduct on the whole was as good as can be expected from a great man in the time in which he rived. He had been first married to Flavia Domitilla, by whom he had tkee children, Titus, Domitian, and Domitilla : she died before the accession of her husband, who from that time lived in a marriage of conscience with Caenis, a woman of low birth, but of good character. Towards the end of ks reign a conspiracy was formed against ks life by A. Caecina and Eprius Marcellus, but it was dis covered, and the principals of it were put to death. Soon after, Vespasian was taken ill at ks villa near Catiriae, in the country of the Sabines, where he used to spend the summer season, and on the 23rd of June, a.d. 79, he died at the age of seventy. Immediately after ks accession, Vespasian had conferred the title of Caesar upon ks son Titus, whom he destined to become ks successor. During the latter period of ks life, the government had been in reality in the hands of Titus ; and the manner m wkch he had conducted himself created consider able apprehensions, turning the public opikon much agakst km for the many acts of cruelty wkch he committed. But<after ks accession a change took place in ks character : its prevail ing features, during ks short reign, were kindness and benevo lence ; and these features, wkch are always most kgkvjprized in a ruler, secured km the attachment of the peoplewo such a degree, that he was called \"the love and delight oi mankind, (amor et deliciae generis humani).\" This attachment was mcreased in proportion as the people had reason to dread ks brother Domitian. The reign of Titus, though short, offered km"], [629, "TITUS. 609 ample opportukty for showing ks kkdly disposition. In the month of August, a.d. 79, there occurred a fearfk eruption of Mount Vesuvius, accompaked by a violent earthquake, during which three towns situated on the Bay of Naples were des troyed, Herckaneuni and Stabiae being buried under the ashes wkch were tkown out by the volcano, and Pompeii under streams of burning lava. To relieve the unfortunate people who had escaped from the catastrophe and lost their homes, Titus is said to have given away almost all ks property. Portions of these towns have been disentombed in modem times, and are, to us, the most precious repositories of ancient art and life : they give us a clearer ksight into the construction of ancient houses and towns than any other remams of antiqkty. In the year followkg an immense fire broke out at Bome, which raged for tkee days, and in wkch the best parts of the city, mcluding the Campus Martius and the Capitorine temple, were destroyed ; and no sooner had tks ckamity passed away, than a vehement pestilence began to rage, wkch carried off numbers of people both at Bome and in Italy. In a.d. 81 Titus celebrated the kauguration of the Colosseum, wkch had been begun by ks father, and of the magkficent Thermae wkch he kmself had built, with most splendid games and amusements. After these solemkties he went to the country of the Sabkes ; and on the 13th of September, a.d. 81, he died k the same villa in which ks father had breathed ks last. Common report said that ks death had been caused by ks brother Domitian ; and all the people mourned as over the death of a father. As far as foreign coun tries are concerned, the reign of Titus was perfectly qket ; and, with the exception of the above-mentioned calamities, Eome enjoyed peace and comfort. Agricola was m the mean time pur sukg ks victorious career in Britak, where he penetrated as far as the river Tay, and fortified the frontiers between the Clyde and Forth. Titus was succeeded by ks brother Domitian, who was as ukike him as possible : he is said to have made several attempts d d 3"], [630, "610 HISTORY OF ROME. to kill, not oky ks brother, but even ks father. His character had become manifest during the short period between ks father's proclamation and ks arrivk in Italy ; even at that time he rived k a sort of eastern harem, k wkch he gratified his lusts. His father, who knew ks disposition, kept km away from public affairs as much as possible ; and tks example was followed by Titus, who, however, always showed him great confidence and forbear ance. During the reign of ks two predecessors, Domitian occupied himself with poetical and other literary compositions ; but ks nature was not ennobled by these purskts. He was pro claimed emperor by the soldiers on the day of ks brother's death ; and during the kst years of ks reign tkngs went on pretty well, for he showed a sort of mixture of vice and virtue : he kept a strict superintendence over the provinces, and made some useful legal enactments. He forbade, for example, the castration of male children, and restricted the excessive cktiva tion of the vine, whereby the growth of corn had been neglected. He also took an active part m the admikstration of justice ; but in his later years he turned tks very practice into an kstru ment of tyranny, for assisted by a host of denouncers he made justice an mstrument of the most brutal cruelty and tyranny that ever ffisgraced a sovereign's tkone. The cause of tks change in ks conduct, independent of his natural bias for every tkng bad, appears to have been ks boundless ambition, wounded pride, jealousy of others, and a fear and cowardice wkch were awakened and roused by the failure of ks undertakngs and the busy zeal of denouncers. In order to gain the favour of the soldiers he raised their pay, while the favour of the popkace was gained by games and donations ; but to obtam the means neces sary for these tkngs he had recourse to confiscations, and wealthy persons were denounced as guilty of kgh treason for no other purpose than that the emperor might become possessed of then property. In a.d. 84, Domitian undertook an expedition agakst the Chatti, wkch seems to have been crowned with some success,"], [631, "611 DOMITIAN. since he constructed the frontier wall between the free Germans and those subject to Eome. Upon tks he celebrated a triumph, and assumed the name of Germakcus, which appears on some of his coins. In the same year, Agricola, at the foot of the Gram pians (Mons Grampius) gained a glorious victory over the Cale donians, who were commanded by their chief Gkgaeus : he also sent out an exploring expedition to exarkne the yet unknown coasts of Scotland ; but when he was upon the point of subdkng the whole country, he was recalled by Domitian, whose jealousy cokd not bear to see his success. Agricola returned to Eome, and spent the remaining eight years of his life in retirement, in order not to attract the tyrant's attention. In a.d. 86, the warlike nation of the Dacians, under their kng Decebalus, crossed over to the southern bank of the Danube, and defeated Ap. Sabinus, the legate of Moesia. Domitian himself took the field against the enemy, but he left the real management of the war to bis legates, while he reposing within a neighbour ing town in Moesia, ascribed all the victories to himself, and the reverses to ks generals. On the whole the Eomans were unsuccessful agknst their enemy. The Quadi and Marcomank, who were bound by treaties to support the Eomans, having refused to do so, Domitian in a.d. 90, marched against them; but he was defeated by them also, and the consequence was that he was obliged to conclude a humiliating peace with Decebalus. Still on ks return to Eome he did not blush to celebrate a tri umph over the Dacians, and to assume the surname of Dacicus. In the following year, L. Antonius, the commander of two legions k Upper Germany, rose against Domitian : the insurrection might have been fatk had not the storm been averted by a sudden overflow of the Bkne, wkch prevented the German auxi liaries whom Antokus expected from joinkg km, and left the rebel an easy conquest to L.

By the vain attempts wkch he made to deceive others Domi tian cokd not deceive himself, and ks mortification at being defeated by the Dacians made km still more ferocious and"], [632, "612 HISTORY OF ROME. rapacious than he had been before : he ordered himself to be called Lord and God (Bominus et Beus), and caused himself to be worskpped with divine honours. The senate, m its abject ser vility, condemned the noblest and wortkest persons to death : thus Aralenus Eusticus was killed because m one of ks works he had praised Paetus Thrasea and Herennius Senecio for havkg mentioned with approbation the conduct of Helvidius Priscus. All philosophers, and among them the noble Epictetus, were expelled from Eome ; and the Ckistians, whose number was then considerable at Eome, and who counted some persons of high distkction among them, were likewise persecuted and murdered in great numbers. The time was so fearful, that no man ventured to express ks real thoughts, having kways to dread some secret denouncer. But the tyrant's own cruelty and excesses brought about ks ruin. He had resolved to put to death ks wife Domitia, and some of the officers of ks court ; but they received secret ikormation of ks intention, and formed a plot against him. A freedman was gained over by the conspirators, who was to gain access to ks bedroom, and there to present a letter to km. The plan succeeded, and while Domitian was reading the letter, the freedman plunged a dagger into ks belly. A violent scuffle ensued, until the other conspirators entered.

COCCEIUS NERVA. \u2014 M. ULPIUS TRAJANUS. P. AELIUS HADRIANUS. Hitherto the emperors had always been Eomans, or at least natives of Italy, but after the time of Domitian we frequently find foreigners, as Spakards, Illyrians, Pannokans, and even Orientks and Africans clothed with the imperial purple. After such terri fic times as those of Caligka, Nero, and Domitian, the Eoman world must have yearned for better days, and its longing was not in vak, for there now followed a series of five rulers, whose reigns form the happiest period in the kstory of the Eoman empire. M. Cocceius Nerva, a venerable senator of the age of 64, was proclaimed emperor by the people and soldiers immediately after the murder of Domitian. He was a native of the town of Narnia k Umbria, and enjoyed the respect of all classes. The praetorian guards acqkesced m his proclamation, though he was not a man after then taste. Nerva, who for tks reason was obliged to be very cautious, pukshed oky a few of those who had made them selves notorious under ks predecessor. He stopped the trials for kgh treason, recalled many persons from exile, and diminished the oppressive taxes. But the praetorians, under then com mander Casperius Aerianus, began to mutiny, and k defiance of the emperor they not oky put the murderers of Domitian to death, but compelled him publicly to express ks approvk of their execution. Nerva felt the humiliation keenly, and k order to strengthen his power, he adopted M. Ulpius Trajan, a man of unblemished character, and a distinguished general, who was then commanding the legions k Lower Germany. Oky three"], [634, "614 HISTORY OF ROME. months after tks adoption, Nerva himself died of a fever on the 27th of January, a.d. 98. The object of ks short reign was to combine two most opposite things, political freedom and the sovereign power of the monarch. His care was also krected towards raising the populace from the degradation m wkch they were riving, for which purpose he purchased and distributed lands among the poor. Trajan was the first Eoman emperor who was not a native of Itky, having been bom in the Spanish town of Itarica, on the Guadalqkvir, not far from Seville. After ks adoption, he quietly entered upon ks new digkty at Cologne, and then set out for Eome. As he entered the city on foot, in a.d. 99, with a small retinue, he was received with enthusiastic applause, for ks noble figure, ks kindliness, and condescension, at once gained him the affection of the people. The very k-st year of his reign was marked by noble acts : after taking possession of the sovereign power, he pumshed the principal denouncers, and banished many of them to the barren islands round Italy. The most turbkent among the praetorians were likewise taken to account. By these and similar measures, he strengthened and secured ks power. The same year is also marked by an institution wkch may be regarded as the kst effort towards a public system of education at Bome, inasmuch as he made a foundation upon which freebom, but poor boys and girls, were to be educated. Trajan, k all his actions, appears as one of the noblest and ablest rkers that Eome ever possessed : although he was not free from weaknesses, still he deserves the name of best, more than any of his predecessors ; and for more than two centuries after, the senate used to hold out, to the newly-elected emperors, Trajan as a model of goodness. He possessed and practised all the virtues which adorn a rker, a general, and a man : he was great in his designs, and persevering k their execution, skilfk in the art of war, sari in the admikstration of justice, simple and unassuming in his manners, affable to every citizen, and a faithful friend : he was equally anxious for the welfare of the pro-"], [635, "NERVA.\u2014 TRAJAN. 615 vinces as for that of Itky ; economical in ks private rife, but liberal and generous in all matters calckated for public use or ornament. A man with such virtues may fairly claim our indkgence for certain weaknesses which are censured in him by Eoman historians. Eome, Italy, and the provkces, were under km adorned with magkficent buddings, bridges, roads, and usefk institutions, such as the Ulpian library at Eome (Biblio fheca Ulpia). The senate was allowed to conduct its delibera tions with perfect freedom, the people again assembled in their comitia, and the magistrates were unshacked m the discharge of then- duties. Trajan kmself submitted to the laws like every other citizen, but at the same time he understood the art of governing a nation better than any of ks predecessors. He was married to Plotina, a woman of kgh character, but he had no children by her. She, and ks own sister Marcka, are among the most estimable women in Boman kstory : the great im provement wkch, from that time forward, is perceptible in the conduct of Boman ladies of rank, was undoubtedly the reskt of then- example and of the mfluence they exercised. Trajan, who before his accession had distingkshed kmself as a general, now directed ks attention principally to war and great arcktectural works. His first war was that against the Dacians, for he deeply felt the disgrace of paying them the tribute with wkch Domitian had purchased their peace. Trajan accordingly refused to pay it ; and at the end of a.d. 100 he marched with an army of 60,000 men into the country of the Dacians, who were still governed by their warlike prkce Decebkus. Trajan took Iris capital of Zarmizegethusa, and after having defeated the kng in several battles, compelled km to sue for peace, wkch was granted to him k A.D. 102, on condition of ks giving up a part of his territory. The emperor then returned to Bome, and obtkned from the senate the surname of Dacicus. But in a.d. 104 the Dacians again rose against the Eomans : to facilitate ks campaign against them, Trajan caused a stone bridge to be constructed across the Danube, m the neighbourhood of the"], [636, "616 HISTORY OF ROME. modern town of Arnetz, in Hungary ; and in the following year he marched into Dacia. Decebalus was so hard pressed by the invader and ks able legates, Lucius Quietus, and Hadrian, that in despair he made away with kmself ; whereupon Dacia (the modem countries of Moldavia, Wallacka, and Transylvaka) was constituted a Eoman provkce, and received severk Boman colomes, which secured the domikon and spread the manners and civilisation of Eome among the barbarians. Trajan now cele brated a second triumph over Dacia, and caused a column to be made recording his victory, and representing in relief ks exploits m Dacia. This column, about 150 feet kgh, the celebrated Columna Trajana, was erected m a.d. 114, in the forum built by Trajan, and is still one of the most remarkable monuments of Eome. In the year k which Dacia was made a Eoman province, Cor nelius Palma, the legate of Syria, subdued the whole of Arabia Petraea. There now followed a few years during wkch the empire enjoyed a profound peace, until in a.d. 114 the Partkans again began to threaten the eastern frontier. Chosroes, their kkg, expelled Exodares king of Armenia from his domikon, and raised his own brother Parthamasiris to the tkone. When the emperor arrived in Armeka he received the homage of the people, and made Armeka a Eoman province. Abgarus, kng of Osrhoene, submitted to him ; and after the capture of the town of Nisibis, the whole of Mesopotamia recognised the supremacy of Eome. Trajan spent the following winter at Antioch: during his stay there that city and the whole of Syria were shaken by a severe earthquake. In the next sprkg he crossed the Tigris, subdued Assyria, and thence proceeded to Seleucia, and Ctesiphon, the capital of the Partkans, who seem to have been prevented by internal feuds from offering a resolute resistance to the invader. After the conquest of Parthia, Trajan sailed with a fleet down the Tigris into the ocean, (the Persian Gulf,) but an insurrection of the conquered nations obliged lrim to return. His legates, however, succeeded m represskg the revolt, and destroyed"], [637, "TRAJAN. 617 the towns of Nisibis, Edessa, and Seleucia. Trajan raised Par thamaspates to the throne of Parthia. In the spring of a.d. 117, he entered the southern part of Arabia, and while he was besieging the town of Hatra he was taken ill: intrustmg the conduct of the war to Hadrian, who had accompaked km on ks eastern expedition, he hastened to return to Eome ; but on his way tkther he died at Selinus,-in Cilicia, on the 9th of August, a.d. 117. His remains were afterwards carried to Bome m a golden urn, and deposited m his own forum under the column recording ks Dacian victories. Trajan seems to have made no provision for determining the succession : there were indeed reports that he had mtended to make Neratius Priscus ks successor, or that in his illness he had adopted Hadrian ; but the latter report seems to have been the work of Plotina, who, by a well-meant forgery, wished to make the world believe that her husband had adopted him. For tks reason she concealed for a few days the death of Trajan, whereby she gained time to communicate with Hadrian, who was then with ks army at Antioch, and to publish the false document of her husband's will with some appearance of probability. Hadrian accordkgly entered upon the government, on the 11th of August, a.d. 117, at Antioch, where he was proclaimed em peror ; and the Eoman senate, to wkch he addressed a letter, readily recognised km. Hadrian was descended from a family of Hadria, in Picenum : ks father was married to an aunt of Trajan, who himself was appokted one of ks guardians on ks father's death. Tkough Plotina's influence, who was very partial to km, he married Jkia Sabina, a grand-daughter of Trajan's sister Marcina, from wkch time he daily rose in the emperor's favour. On his accession the Eoman empire was k a perilous conk tion: the Partkans, who had just been conquered by Trajan, revolted, and were successftd in several engagements ; Moesia was harassed by an invasion of the Sarmatae and Eoxolani, and other provinces kso were in a state of insurrection. Hadrian"], [638, "618 HISTORY OF ROME. now showed his wisdom by giving up the recent conquests k the east, wkch it wokd have been impossible or at least extremely diffickt to maktak. He accordingly renounced all the con quests east of the Eupkates, restored Assyria and Mesopotamia to the Partkans, and recogksed Chosroes as then kng ; Par thamaspates was kdemnked by a small neighbouring principality, and Armenia restored to the rank of an kdependent kngdom. Having thus settled the affairs of the east, Hadrian, in a.d. 118, returned to Eome, from whence he shortly after set out with his army for Moesia. Here again ks object was not conquest, but merely to secure the Eoman possessions ; and he accordingly concluded a peace with the Eoxolak, for wkch he had probably to pay a heavy sum. As he was proceedkg against the Sarmatae, he received intelligence of a conspiracy wkch had been formed by ks personal enemies, Nigrkus, Lucius Qketus, Pahna, Celsus, and other persons of high rank. After the dis covery of the plot, the four leaders were put to death by com mand of the emperor himself, according to the general opkion, though he was most anxious to deny the fact. The belief that he had ordered their execution roused public feeling against him, and, apprehending an outbreak at Bome, he left the command of the armies in Pannonia and Dacia in the hands of Marcius Turbo, one of ks generks, who had just suppressed a rebellion in Mauri taka, and returned to Italy, where he endeavoured to obliterate the prevailing suspicion by liberal donations, games, and gladia torial exhibitions. One act, wkch was sure to wm km the favour of the people, was his canceffing an enormous sum of money due to the state as taxes, namely, all the arrears of the last fifteen years. He further courted the favour of the senate, and promised never to punish a senator without its sanction : at the same time he found it advisable to remove ks former friends from then- office of prefects of the praetorians. He divided Italy into four regions, for the purpose of better jurisdiction, a conskar bekg placed at the head of each region ; the offices of the palace, the army, and in the admkistration of"], [639, "HADRIAN. 619 the state, were regkated according to a new system, which, on the whole, remained unchanged untd the time of Constantine the Great. The war against the Sarmatae was in the mean time continued by ks legates, and seems to have lasted for several years. In a.d. 119 he began ks memorable journey tkough all the pro vinces of ks empire, many of wkch he traversed on foot. It was undertaken from a desire to promote the happiness of ks subjects by personal inspection of the manner in wkch the admikstration was carried on, and to remedy evils wherever they occurred ; though there can be no doubt that bis own curiosity, and a singu lar restlessness of his nrind, also had a share in determining km to enter upon the undertakng. These travels occupied the greater part of his reign. He first visited Gaul and Germany, whence he proceeded, in a.d. 121, to Britain. There he secured the northern part of England against the invasions of the Scots, by a wall of 80,000 paces in length, extending from the mouth of the Tyne to the Solway. Bemains of tks wall are known to tks day, under the name of the Picts' wall. On his return to Gak he adorned the town of Nemausus (Nismes) with splendid bklkngs, and then went to Spain, where he spent the winter. In a.d. 122, he returned to Bome, but soon after set out for Achaia, and the provinces of the east. At Athens he appears to have remained for tkee years : it was his favourite place, and he honoured it above all other cities m the empire. After a visit to Sicriy, he again returned to Eome. In a.d. 129, he visited Africa, and thence proceeded to the east : he again made a long stay at Athens, to see the completion of the numerous and mag mficent buildings wkch had been commenced during ks former visit. During ks progress m Asia, he examined with great strictness into the conduct of the governors of the provinces, and did all he cokd to conciliate the princes of the neighbouring kkgdoms. From Asia he proceeded tkough Syria mto Egypt, where he restored the tomb of Pompey with great splendour. During ks stay in Egypt, ks favourite, Antinous, a Bithykan"], [640, "620 HISTORY OF ROME. youth, for whom he entertained an unnatural affection, was drowned in the Nile : his death was to Hadrian the cause of deep and lasting grief. From Egypt he returned to Eome, where, in a.d. 131, he promkgated a collection of laws under the title Edictum Perpetuum, wkch had been drawn up by the jurist Salvius Jurianus. Not long after the emperor's return to Eome a formidable insurrection broke out among the Jews riving in Syria. A colony of the name of Aeria Capitolina had been established on the site of Jerusalem, and pagan worship had been introduced there ; and Hadrian, moreover, had issued an edict forbidding the Jews the rite of circumcision. These tkngs were more than the Jews cokd bear, and, under their leader, Barcochab, they rose in arms with the most desperate fury. The war lasted for several years, and in it 580,000 Jews are said to have perished. It was not brought to a close until Julius Severus came over from Britain, and finally succeeded in paralysing or ankklating the Jews, who were henceforth forbidden to live at Jerusalem, or in its immediate vickity. Numbers of them were sold into slavery, and the great scattering of the nation dates from tks time. After the Jewish war, another tkeatened to break out in the east with the Albanians ; but Hadrian averted the danger by senkng rich presents to the Albanians, and toPharasmanes,kng of the Iberians, who had stirred up the Albanians, and whose feelings by tks means became so changed that he even paid a visit to Hadrian at Eome. After his return from ks travels until his death, Haffiian spent his time partly at Eome and partly at Tibur, where he built a magnificent villa on so grand a scale that even its rains occupy the space of a considerable town. The many fatigues and hardskps he had undergone had so impaired ks health, that in a.d. 135 he was seized with a dangerous illness, wkch proved to be dropsy, and tks led him to tknk of a successor. Havkg kmself no children, he adopted L. Ceiokus Commodus, under the name of L. Aelius Verus, a noble and handsome youth,"], [641, "621 HADRIAN. but of an effeminate character : the young man, however, did not prove to be of that assistance to the emperor wkch had been expected ; and bekg of a weakly disposition, he died on the first day of the year a.d. 138. Hadrian now adopted Arrius Anto knus (afterwards the emperor Antoknus Pius) and presented him to the senators, assembled around his bed, as ks successor : at the same time he obliged Antoknus to adopt the son of Aelius Verus, L. Commodus Verus, and M. Ankus Veras (after wards the emperor M. Aurerius). These arrangements, however, did not restore peace to ks mind. Some of ks most worthy friends, who had opposed the adoption of L. Aelius Verus, were put to death ; and ks illness made km daily more suspicious and cruel : many persons of rank were executed ; and many more wokd have fallen victims, had it not been for the precautions taken by Antoknus. At last, when Hadrian found that ks illness was incurable, he requested a slave to run him tkough with a sword: tks, however, was prevented by Antoknus. Severk more attempts were made at skcide, but with no success. At length he was removed to Baiae, where he hoped to find at least some relief, but he soon after died on the 10th of Jky, a.d. 138, at the age of sixty-three. He was buried k the villa of Cicero, near Puteoli. The senate, indignant at the many acts of cruelty wkch Hadrian had committed durmg the last tkee years of his life, wished to annk his enactments, and refused km the custo mary divine honours ; but Antoknus prevailed upon them to be lenient towards km, on the ground that, during his illness, he had not been in the full possession of ks mind ; and from tks act of firik kmdness towards ks adopted father, Antoknus derived the surname of Pius. The reign of Hadrian formed, on the whole, one of the most peaceful and happy periods of the Eoman empire. His policy was not to extend the boundaries of the empire, but to secure the old provinces, and promote then welfare by a fair and just admiks tration. But as his presents and kndness to the barbarians might have been insufficient to ward off their attacks, he always"], [642, "622 HISTORY OF ROME. kept ks armies k most excellent condition. He was the kst Boman emperor that seems to have understood ks rek position as monarch of the Boman empire, wkch, under him, became more consolidated than it had ever been before. He formed for kmself a conned (consistorium principis) with a regular organi sation, wkch gradually deprived the senate of its jurisdiction. Its president henceforth was always a jurist, who may, therefore, be looked upon as a minister of justice. Jurisprudence made great progress m ks reign, and the Edictum perpetuum, wkch he pronmlgated, forms an era in the kstory of Boman law. Hadrian was a patron and practical lover of the arts and riterature ; he was very ambitious of praise, and was anxious to make as many friends as possible ; but he had the weakness to believe that he excelled them all, and in every tkng, wkch often rendered him troublesome and unbearable."], [643, "623 CHAPTEE XLVII. ANTONINUS PIUS. \u2014 M. AURELIUS. \u2014 L. COMMODUS ANTONINUS. Antoninus Pius was descended from a family of Nemausus, in Gak, but he himself was bom at Lanuvium, on the 19th of September, a.d. 86. His adoption by Hadrian was owing solely to ks virtue and merits ; for he had ffistingkshed kmself in the administration of Asia by surpassing wisdom and mild ness, and he had shown the same qualities m ks management of one of the four regions of Itky. During the long reign of tks prince, from a.d. 138 to a.d. 161, who, of all the emperors, was the most virtuous, and one of the noblest beings that ever lived, the empire enjoyed such peace as had never before fallen to its share : owing to the almost total suspension of wars, crimes, and violence, the kstory of his reign is nearly a blank. All the thoughts and energies of tks wise and amiable raler were directed towards one object, \u2014 the happiness of ks people. The denouncers disappeared entirely, and confiscations are scarcely heard of : ks simple habits, Iris courtesy to every one, the patient attention with which he listened to every tkng that was brought before km, and ks impartiality k the admikstration of justice, secured to km the love and admiration of the provincials no less than of the Eomans. Good governors were allowed to remak in their provinces for many years, and the farmers of the public revenue were compelled to abandon then extortions. Whenever there happened a calamity m any part of the empire, Antoknus afforded relief to the sufferers with most unsparing liberality: such was the case when Asia and Ehodes were devastated by an earthquake, and in a.d. 153, when Narbonne, Antioch, and Carthage were partially destroyed by conflagrations."], [644, "624 HISTORY OF ROME. In ks foreign policy Antoknus strictly adhered to the principles of ks predecessor, for no attempt was made to mcrease the extent of the empire ; but, at the same time, all rebellions witkn and aggressions from without were promptly crushed, either by persuasion or by mere armed demonstrations. Hence the move ments of the Germans, Dacians, and Mauritanians, Greeks, and Egyptians, produced no effects : the oky commotion that was of any consequence occurred in Britain, wkch was repeatedly k vaded by the Brigantes ; but there the legate Lollius Urbicus, in a.d. 141, defeated the enemy, and formed a rampart of turf somewhat beyond the line where Agricola had constructed ks wall, to stop the inroads of the Caledonians. The renown of the wisdom and virtues of Antoninus spread tkoughout the world, and embassies came to km from the most distant parts of the east to seek ks alliance and friendship : the Partkans abandoned an attempt upon Armeka merely in consequence of ks remon strances; the Scytkans submitted their disputes to ks arbitration; and the barbarians from the Lpper Danube received a kkg from ks hands. He devoted equal care to the physical and intellectual improve ment of his people : the interests of education and literature were promoted in all parts of the empire by the honours and distinctions conferred upon rhetoricians and philosophers, who were appomted every where without any reference to sect or school, and received annual salaries of 600 sesterces. In a.d. 141, he founded an institution for the education of poor orphan girls, whom he styled puellae alimentariae Faustinianae, in honour of ks wife Faustina, who had died in that year. In private life Antoninus was equally distingkshed : he rived as a private citizen, accessible to all, like a father to ks children: he even passed over the irregularities of ks wife, which, to a certak extent, must have been known to him, and after her death loaded her memory with honours. The peace of his reign, his own fervent piety and scrupulous observance of religious rites, gained for him, among ks contemporaries, the"], [645, "ANTONINUS PIUS.\u2014 M. AURELIUS. 625 reputation of a second Numa. The first Apology of the Ckistian religion, addressed to km by Justin the Martyr, procured pro tection and toleration for the Ckistians, who then eksted m large numbers, both at Bome and in the provinces. After ks accession, Antoninus never appeared at the head of his armies : he refused also to travel through the provinces, that they might not be burthened with the expense of maktaking ks court. He was fond of the pleasures of a coimtry life, and ks excur sions were limited to his villas in Campaka. He died on the 7th of March, a.d. 161, in ks villa at Lorium, at the age of 75. The long peace of ks reign, though beneficial in many respects, greatly increased the indolence and effeminacy of the Eomans : the legions kso, stationed in their camps, and spending then- time in idleness, lost their warlike spirit, without which the empire cokd not be safe for any length of time. By Iris wife Faustina he had two daughters and two sons : one of the daughters, Faustina, was married, m a.d. 145, to M. Aurerius, and ks two sons appear to have died long before then- father ; so that, accord mg to the established order, Antoknus was succeeded by his adopted son, M. Aurerius. M. Aurerius Antoknus, commoky called the Philosopher, was bom at Bome, in a.d. 121. He had shown, from his ckldhood, an extreme love of truth, and tkrst for knowledge : ks edu cation had been conducted with the greatest care by the cele brated rhetoricians, Herodes Atticus and Cornelius Fronto, and by the stoic philosophers, Junius Busticus and Apoilokus. During- the reign of Antoknus he had been the constant COm panion and adviser of that noble-minded man, and the most per fect harmony existed between them until the death of Antoknus. In March, a.d. 161, he undertook the government of the empire, and at once admitted ks adopted brother, Ceiokus Corn modus, or, as he is commonly called, L. Verus, who was eight years younger than himself, to a full participation in the sovereign power. Tks arrangement, a pure act of grace on the part of M. Aurerius, was intended to be of advantage, not oky to the e E"], [646, "626 HISTORY OF ROME. monarch himself, but to the whole empire ; for M. Aurerius was of a weakly constitution, and took more delight in philosopkcal and literary purskts than m war ; wkle L. Verus was young, active, and skilled in all maky exercises, though he was adfficted to debauchery and voluptuous propensities, wkch he had hitherto carefully conceked. Storms had long been gathering on two parts of the Eoman frontier, in the east and in the north. The former broke out first : the Parthian kng, Vologeses III., who had been restrained by the remonstrances of Antoknus Pius, now began a series of ravaging inroads kto the Eoman provinces, and cut to pieces one whole legion at Elegia. L. Verus, after having been betrothed to Lucilla the daughter of ks colleague, accordingly proceeded, in a.d. 162, with an army to Syria. On ks arrivk at Antioch, he determined to remain there, and to leave the command of his armies to ks generks. While he was plungkg himself into luxu ries and voluptuousness, Avidius Cassius compelled the Partkans to retreat, invaded Mesopotamia, destroyed Seleucia, with the royal palace at Ctesiphon, and penetrated as far as Babylon : ano ther general at the same tkie made kmself master of Armeka, and restored the legitimate kng, Soaemus, to ks tkone. Volo geses was compelled to conclude a humiliating peace, and to give up Mesopotamia to ks conquerors. After the conclusion of tks war, in a.d. 166, L. Verus, accompanied by a host of actors, returned to Eome, and celebrated a triumph, wkch was soon followed by the outbreak of a fearful pestilence, during wkch the celebrated physician, Claudius Gkenus, who had come to Eome from Pergamus, practised ks art with great skll. The movements wkch were going on m the north were stk more dangerous, for they extended from the sources of the Danube to the Illyrian border. Numbers of barbarous tribes, including the Marcomank, Alam, Jazyges, Quadi, Sarmatae, and many others, were in commotion, and both emperors set out agakst the foe. The contest which now began was continued, with varying success, during the whole reign of M. Aurerius,"], [647, "M. AURELIUS. 627 whose head quarters were generally in Pannoka. The bar barians, overawed by the power displayed by the emperors, submitted, and sued for peace, wkch enabled the emperors, in a.d. 169, to return to Eome ; but when they reached Altinum, k the country of the Veneti, L. Verus was seized with apoplexy and died. The only good that can be said of km is, that he did not thwart the wise plans of ks colleague. Towards the end of the same year, M. Aurerius agak set out for Germany, and pro secuted the war against the Marcomank with great vigour and extraordinary efforts. On one occasion a fierce battle was fought on the frozen Danube ; but the most important victory was that gained by the emperor over the Quadi, in a.d. 174 : the Eomans were rescued from a most perilous situation by a sudden storm ; and tks signal success of their arms, wkch was at the time attributed to the interposition of Heaven, seems to have struck terror into the barbarians, who now sought and obtaked peace on condition of their withdrawing from the Danube. The em peror was prevented from followkg up this victory by the news of an insurrection in Syria, wkch tkeatened to become very dangerous. The emperor's wife, Faustina, began to be karmed about her husband's decrimng health, and feared lest the govern ment shokd fall kto the hands of another family, skce her own son, Commodus, who was born in a.d. 161, was yet too young to succeed. She accordingly desired Avidius Cassius, the governor of Syria, to be prepared for eveiytkng, and offered him her hand and the tkone if he wokd aid her m her schemes. While these negotiations were going on, a report reached Syria that M. Aurerius had died, and Avidius Cassius forthwith caused himself to be proclaimed emperor. The falseness of the report soon became known ; but Cassius, thridcing ks offence beyond forgiveness, resolved to mamtak his power, and in a very short time made himself master of all Asia on tks side Mount Taurus. While M. Aurerius was makng preparations against the usurper, Cassius was assassmated by a centurion of ks own army. M. Aurerius, however, set out for the east, to restore E E 2"], [648, "628 HISTORY OF ROME. peace and tranquillity; and his conduct, after his arrival there as well as before, cannot but excite the kghest admiration of every friend of humanity : not one man was put to death with the em peror's consent ; few were pukshed at all ; and the papers of Cassius were burnt without being read, m order that no further disclosures might be made. During tks expedition, Faustina, who accompaked her husband, died in Ciricia, perhaps by her own act, that she might escape the pukshment she deserved. Having paid a visit to Egypt and Athens, M. Aurelius re turned to Eome, in a.d. 176, after an absence of eight years, and celebrated a triumph. He gave to every citizen a donation of eight gold pieces, made ks son Commodus ks colleague in the sovereignty, and celebrated the nuptials between him and Crispma. No sooner were these solemnities over, than a fresh insurrection of the Marcomanni once more called M. Aurerius away from Eome. In the month of August, a.d. 177, he accordingly marched with Commodus from Eome, wkch he was never to see again. His campaigns were very successfk : the Marcomanni, Hermunduri, Quadi, and Sarmatae, were routed one after another, and everytkng seemed to indicate that they wokd soon be finally crashed. But the shattered constitution of M. Aurelius now gave way, and he died at Vindobona (Vienna) or Shmium, on the 17th of March, a.d. 180, at the age of fifty kne; not without a suspicion that ks son Commodus had accele rated Iris death. The most striking features in the character of M. Aurelius were ks devotedness to the study of philosophy, and the affec tionate familiarity wkch he kept up with those who had in structed km in ks early life. No monarch was ever more widely or more deeply beloved than he ; and it was thought impious for any man not to have in his house some picture or statue of the emperor. His whole rife was an unbroken practical demonstra tion of the doctrines of the philosophy wkch he had embraced. He was severe and conscientious towards himself, and gentle and mercifk towards every one else. We still possess his Meditations,"], [649, "COMMODUS. 629 a work which would do honour to any man in any age, and in wkch he is pourtrayed with all ks amiable, affectionate, and benevolent sentiments. Although he personally had an aversion to war, yet he firmly and manfully undertook the command of ks armies whenever the safety of the empire required it. The veneration wkch the people entertained for him was so great, that, after his death, it was believed that he had been some good gekus sent from heaven to bless manknd, and that he had now returned to ks real home. There is only one tkng for wkch he seems to deserve censure, and that is, he sanctioned, in a.d. 177, a cruel persecution of the Ckistians in Gak: tks conduct is the more surprising, as it was contrary both to his own prin ciples of toleration and to the example set him by his predecessor. It must be supposed that he was guided by evil advisers, for many of the philosophers of his age entertained the bitterest in tolerance agakst the new religion. His unworthy son, M. Commodus Antoninus, then not yet twenty years old, succeeded ks father as a matter of course. His education had been supermtended with the utmost care and vigilance, and conducted by the ablest and most distinguished men of the time ; but all their teachkg, and the example set him by ks father, were lost upon him ; and those who knew km well discovered, at an early age, that he was addicted to base pleasures and sensuality. It was a weakness in Aurelius that he did not adopt some one of ks generals, and make him his successor. Immekately after the death of ks father, Commodus hastened to make peace with the Marcomamri and Quadi, in order to be able to return to Eome, and mdkge in the pleasures of the capital without restraint. The love and veneration entertained by every one for his father were transferred to him like an kheritance, and at ks first appearance m the city, as emperor, he was greeted with the most enthusiastic acclamations. For a while the hopes of men were not disappointed i the oky thkg they might have complained of was ks lavish distribution of money among the popkace and soldiers. But a change in ks conduct was"], [650, "630 HISTORY OF ROME. produced in a.d. 182, by a conspiracy formed against kmbyks own sister, Lucilla, who seems to have been jealous of the rank and influence of her brother's wife, Crispina. Her scheme, wkch was frustrated by the rashness of the assassm who aimed the deaky blow, all at once awakened the slumbering ferocity of Commodus, and the whole of ks remaikng life is an uknterrupted series of sangknary and disgusting excesses. Every pretext was seized for indkging in the most savage cruelty : false accusations, vague suspicions, much wealth, kgh birth, great learkng, or any promi nent virtue, were sufficient to point out and doom ks victims. Nearly all the friends of ks father, and others who had risen to eminence under km, were put to death. The cruel and detested Perenks was made commander of the praetorians, and to him were left all the cares of the government, while the tyrant aban doned himself to the most shameless and brutal debaucheries. His wife Crispka was convicted of adultery and exiled; and Marcia, a woman who was well disposed towards the Christians, became ks concubine. During the time that he was weltering in vice, he displayed a most contemptible vanity and love of popkar applause, wkch he sought to gratify k the most extra ordinary manner. He often danced, sang, played the charioteer and buffoon, ffisgksed kmself as a pedlar or horse-dealer, and officiated as a priest m the foreign superstitions that were then in vogue at Bome ; but ks greatest ambition was to display ks skill in the handling of martik weapons -. he fought as a gladiator in the circus more than 700 times, and slew many thousands of wild beasts and human beings, for wkch he demanded to be worskpped as a second Herckes. In a.d. 186 the legions stationed m Britain were roused by the tyrannical severity with wkch Perenks treated the soldiers, and an embassy of 1500 soldiers was despatched to Eome to demand ks deposition and punishment. Commodus was obliged to yield, but he gave the command of the praetorians to a Phrygian freed man, Cleander, who was even more cruel and avaricious than ks predecessor, but who enjoyed the especik favour of Commodus."], [651, "COMMODUS. 631 Shortly after tks, while all Italy was suffering from plague and famke, the city popkace, durmg the Circensian games in a.d. 189, rose against Cleander, literally tore km to pieces, and destroyed ks whole family. During these scenes Commodus gratked ks lusts in a harem, wkch is said to have contained 300 concubmes, and butchered the best of the senators as if they had been wild beasts. But, as in all similar cases, he was woriring ks own downfall. Having determmed to put to death the consks who were to enter on their office on the fo-st of Ja nuary a.d. 193, he was intending to enter the senate-house with a band of gladiators. His mistress, Marcia, to whom he com mukcated ks plan, cautioned km agakst its danger, and was warmly supported by Laetus, the prefect of the praetorians, and by Eclectus, an imperik chamberlain. Commodus treated their advice with scorn and indignation, and withdrew to ks apartment, where, as usual, he drew up a list of the persons who were to be killed the next day. This list was by accident carried by one of his dwarfs to Marcia, who, seemg her own name and those of her two supporters at the head of it, at ouce communicated the ffiscovery to them. No time was to be lost : it was resolved to poison him that evekng ; but as the poison operated slowly, a celebrated atkete, Narcissus, was hired, who strangled the tyrant in the kght of the 31st of December, a.d. 192. When ks death, wkch was at first cautiously attributed to apoplexy, became known, it diffused a general joy tkoughout Bome, except among the praetorians, upon whom he had always lavished the most liberal donations. The senate cursed the tyrant, and ordered that ks body, like that of a vile malefactor, shokd be dragged tkough the streets with hon hooks and cast into the Tiber ; but Pertinax, who had been proclaimed ks successor, was humane enough not to allow it, and the body was interred in the mausoleum of Hadrian. Commodus, throughout ks reign, had not troubled kmself in the least about the affairs of the empire, but its mtegrity was nevertheless maintained by the valour of ks legates.

The Frisians, beyond the Ekne, were conquered m a.d. 191.

CONCLUDING REMARKS. CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE. LITERATURE AND THE ARTS DURING THE FIRST TWO CENTURIES OF THE EMPIRE. Feom this time forward the praetorian guards, whose presump tion and arrogance had risen to the kghest pitch during the reign of Commodus, exercised a most frightful military despotism, and the legions in the provinces followed then- example. As it fre quently happened that the different bodies of troops did not agree among themselves, or acted independently of one another in the proclamation of an emperor, we find examples of two, tkee, or four emperors bekg proclaimed at once, who had to fight for the sovereignty until oky one of them survived. The praeto rians carried then savage and disgraceftd conduct so far that, in a.d. 193, they Literally sold the sovereignty to Didius Salvius Jkian, for the payment of 30 sesterces to every one of them, which he agreed to give, thus realising the prophecy of Jugurtha. Great men, such as Diocletian and Constantine, endeavoured to prevent the downfall of the empire by dividing it into the eastern and the western empire ; but it was of no avail ; and in a.d. 476, the Germans, under Odoacer, after the detkonement of Eomkus Augustkus, established their domikon in Itky. From the reign of Commodus there is notkng but an irregular succession of emperors, who, with few exceptions, are distingkshed oky for tyranny and baseness, or impotence and weakness ; notkng but a perpetual repetition of civil wars and murders which are wearying and disgusting to the mind. Civil order, military discipline, patri otism, national spirit, and all great and noble feerings disappear from the Eoman world ; emperors are proclaimed and murdered, both at Eome and in the provinces, at the mere caprice of the e e 3"], [654, "634 HISTORY OF ROME. solffiers. A kstory presenting such spectacles at every step contains little or nothing to elevate or ennoble the heart and mind of man, and ought certaiky not to be chosen as a subject for youthful minds to dwell upon. Those who wish to obtain full and satisfactory information upon the history of the decline and fall of the Eoman empire may find it in the masterly work of Gibbon. It had been the system of Augustus to preserve rather than to ekarge the extent of the empire : ks attempts to conquer Arabia and Etkopia probably arose from a desire to facilitate and increase the commerce of the Eomans with the far distant east ; but the climate did not allow them to establish themselves permanently in those countries. His arms were more successfk in the north of Spain, where he extended Iris domikon to the Atlantic Ocean ; and in the country south of the Danube, where the Eomans became masters of Vindericia, Eaetia, Noricum, Pannonia, and Moesia. The wars against the Germans were undertaken with a view to protect Gak rather than to make any conquests beyond the Ekne, which river, on the whole, remained the frontier between the Germans and Eomans. The conquest of Britak had com menced under Claudius, and was carried farthest by Agricola. In the reign of Trajan the empire acquired its greatest extent ; for, on the north of the Danube, he conquered Dacia, and in the east, Armeka, Mesopotamia, Assyria : part also of x\\rabia became subject to Eome ; and the Eoman fleet was stationed in the Bed Sea, for the purpose of sailing to India. But ks successor, Hadrian, gave up all these conquests with the exception of Dacia, and again made the Eupkates the eastern boundary. The aggressions k the north and east, however, still continued ; and the Mauritakans, or Moors, began to invade Spam as early as the time of M. Aurerius. The monarchy had been virtually established by Augustus, though he was more concerned about the substance than the show of power ; but ks successors, who were not under the neces-"], [655, "GENERAL REMARKS. 635 sity of proceedmg with the same caution, were not satisfied with the substance of monarckcal power, they kso assumed its outward form and appearance. The authority of the senate sank k pro portion as that of the emperor, and the despotism of the solkers mcreased; and after the time of Hadrian, when the sovereign settled the most important affairs of the state with ks privy councd, the republican publicity of all transactions concernmg the state ceased. The tyranny of some of the emperors rose to an incredible pitch, for they were not bound by any laws, and were kways sure of the support of the popkace and soldiers, provided they fed, paid, and amused them liberally. Tks led, in the end, to the dissolution of aU civil government, and the establishment of that unbridled military despotism which finally ruined the empire. The praetorians were, mdeed, the support of the purple clad despots ; but at the same time they looked upon them as their own creatures, and felt, therefore, no scruples m murdering them, or selling their dignity. The succession to the empire was not regkated by any law ; the idea of an hereditary monarchy kd not take root among the Eomans until a much later time. The oky way k which the question about the succession was settled was for the actual emperor, by adoption, to point out the man by whom he wished to be succeeded ; and if the latter was approved of by the soldiers, the recognition by the senate, wkch was a mere formality, followed as a matter of course. The senate itself scarcely ever ventured to raise a person to the imperial digkty who had not been previously proclaimed by the soldiers. Laws (leges) passed by the people m their assembly entirely disappear after the reign of Augustus: the laws mentioned after that time are ordinances of the senate (senatusconsulta), formed on the proposal or by the order of the emperor. Added to these were the imperial ordkances or constitutions (constitu tiones principis, rescripta, decreta, mandata, edicta), wkch at first were not bindkg as general laws, but came to be so in the course of time. The edicts of the praetors lost their former importance, skce those magistrates were obliged to submit to the opinions"], [656, "636 HISTORY OF ROME. of the jurists, who gradually became great authorities. Hadrian ordered the principal praetorian edicts to be collected into one body (Edictum perpetuum), and the Eoman law thus became reduced to a regkar system. The emperor himself formed the highest court of appeal ; and, for the purpose of deciding upon cases of appek, or any other extraordinary cases that might be brought before him, he was assisted by a special councri, wkch must be kstingkshed from his state conned : such at least was the case with Hadrian. Offences against the state or the person of the emperor were tried by the senate, which, even in the early period of the empire, had degraded itself mto a mere tool in the hand of the rker. Civil cases continued to be tried at Bome by the praetors and the prefects of the city, assisted by a number of judges. Augustus, who was well awrare that the safety of the monarchy depended, in a great measure, upon the safety of the capital, had made some excellent police regkations. A prefect of the corn market (praefectus annonae) superintended the stores and corn trade : public buildings, works of art, streets, aqueducts, and the cleansing of the bed of the river, were likewise placed under special inspectors. The superintendence of the public games was transferred from the aediles to the praetors, and the sums required for then- celebration were furnished from the public treasury. But these and many other usefk regkations cokd not be productive of much permanent good, for the demoralisa tion went on kcreasing every day, and many of the emperors publicly defied every law of decency. Italian agriculture, wkch had received its death-blow during the latter period of the republic, was completely crushed by the establishment of numerous villas, wkch, with their parks and pleasure grounds, baths, ponds, and groves, often equalled large towns in extent ; and most of the remaking districts were changed mto pasture land. Mamifactures and industry cokd not thrive at Eome from the want of an active and industrious middle class ; the Eomans being either enormously wekthy, or riving in"], [657, "637 CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE. abject poverty. In the reign of tyrants, the populace were never under the necessity of working, or gaikng their rivkg by honest labour ; for the means of subsistence, as oil, bread, wke, and meat, were lavishly distributed among them by the ralers, either from the public treasury or from their private purse. Some times such donations were a remedy for momentary suffering, but they contributed, more than anythkg else, to tkow the people mto that state of indifference and idleness wkch brought them to the lowest stage of degradation ; and no emperor seems to have been able to conceive the idea of betterkg the condition of the people by compelling them to be active and mdustrious. Such a popkace was just as strong a support of despotism as the praetorian guards, and despots cokd not be expected to im prove its condition. AB trades and manufactures m the city were generally in the hands of freedmen and foreigners ; but the wealthy Eomans had usually such hosts of slaves, of every description, that all then wants cokd be satisfied at home without their being obliged to have recourse to the ordinary tradesmen of the city. The gross brutality and totk absence of every feeling of humakty k the popkation of Eome shows itself most strikngly in then- passionate fondness for the bloody scenes of the circus : the sight of murder, and of men in the agokes of death, was to them a source of pleasure and delight ; and their cries for bread were often mixed with cries for murder ous games. Even Titus was obliged to yield to the clamour of the people, and to give gladiatorial games for several days, in wkch thousands of unfortunate gladiators were compelled to destroy one another. In like manner Trajan, after his Dacian victory, had to amuse the populace with games wkch lasted 103 days, and wkch, in the number of glaffiators and wild beasts that appeared in the circus, surpassed every similar exkbition seen at Eome. All imaginable instruments and artifices of sensuality, voluptuousness, and debauchery, were carried from the east to Italy ; and the city of Eome, which"], [658, "638 HISTORY OF ROME. became a place of resort for persons of all nations, was at the same time a pool of corruption for all. It is revolting to read of the shameless crimes and profligacies in the days of a Caligka, Nero, and Domitian ; and we shokd turn away from the history of Eome m disgust and despair, were it not that, now and then, a noble bekg passes across the horizon to show that virtue had not altogether forsaken the empire. The commerce of the Eomans had increased m proportion as their wants were nmltiplied. All the countries from the Atlantic Ocean to the Eupkates were open to Boman mer chants, whose traffic was facilitated by the numerous military roads which had been made m all parts of the empire : Myos hormus, Dioscurias (Sebastopolis), Alexandria, Massiria, Gades, Byzantium, Antioch, Palmyra, Seleucia, and the islands of Naxos, Delos, Cos, and Ehodes, were for a long time the great marts whence the Eomans imported their luxuries, slaves, and other commodities. The saying of the Greeks, that the language of men is like their lives, is confirmed also by the kstory of Eome. The cor ruption of the Latin language was a necessary consequence of the ktered form of government, and of the languor and indolence into which the nation sank. The cktivation of their mother tongue had begun to be neglected in the early part of the empire, and Greek became the language of all faskonable circles, where the education of children was conducted by Greek tutors and governesses. The vast number of slaves and foreigners who came to Eome from all parts contributed not a little towards this corruption ; the old and powerful simplicity of the language dis appeared, and the desire to speak and write in a strikng and piquant manner produced that hollow pomp and tinkring of words wkch we meet with as early as the time of Nero. In the reign of Augustus, Eoman riterature had reached its highest perfection, but its decline began even before ks death ; for the establishment of the monarchy put an end to all free"], [659, "LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE. 639 public oratory, and eloquence was henceforth cktivated oky in funeral orations, or encomiums, and in the rhetorical schools. With the accession of Tiberius the flouriskng period of riterature came to its close : the corruption of taste began ; and the oppres sion of the rker on the one hand, and the moral depravity of the people on the other, crushed all free development of intellectual life, wkch the establishment of libraries, and schools, and the appomtment of salaried teachers, were unable to restore. But while intellectual activity sank at Eome, it became extended in the provinces, which thus began to participate k the riterature of the capital ; for booksellers are mentioned at Lyons in Gak, and they undoubtedly existed m all the great towns of the west. A depravation of taste, both in regard to purity of diction and to the manner of handling a subject, may be seen in the poems of Lucan, Vkerius Flaccus, Silks Itaricus, and Papikus Statius, whose epics are bombastic and learned, but devoid of the genuine spirit of poetry. The character of the age afforded ample mate rik for bitter satire, and produced a Persius, Juvenal, Petrokus, and Martik, whose works however, in point of taste and refine ment, are greatly inferior to the satires of Horace. The \u00c6sopic fable was successfully cktivated in verse by Phaedrus, in the reign of Tiberius. After the time of Commodus we scarcely meet with a poet deserving of the name. Latk prose likewise degenerated after the reign of Augustus : the philosopher Seneca, the mstructor of Nero, exercised an injurious influence upon it by the rhetorical and affected man ner of ks style, wkch was counteracted, though in vain, by the great rhetorician Quintilian. In the time of Hadrian and the Antonines, there sprang up a singkar fondness for old fashioned and rare words and expressions, as we see in the works of Apkeius and Fronto. Historical writing laboured under still greater disadvantages ; for at that time men were obliged to be as cautious in what they said of their contem poraries, and even of men of a by-gone age, as in any modern"], [660, "640 HISTORY OF ROME. state where the censorship exercises its despotism. Thus the emperor Claudius was compelled to suppress ks kstory of the civil wars because he had treated the subject in too honest a manner ; and Arkenus Eusticus and Herennius Senecio were put to death because they praised men whom they thought de serving of commendation but whom Domitian hated. Notwith standing all tks, there arose some kstorians of eminence, both in regard to their style and to the method of treating their subjects. Among these we must mention Velleius Paterckus (a contem porary and flatterer of Tiberius), Suetonius, and, above all, the great Tacitus, a man who stands pre-eminent and koue in the corrupt age in wkch he lived. After the time of Commodus, kstorical composition sank to the very lowest state ; and the oky historian of any note, during the remaining period of the empire, was Ammianus Marceffiiius, about a.d. 360. Augustus had given a great impkse to the arts, especially to arcktecture, by which he and Iris friends adorned Eome, but his successor entirely neglected it. Nero was fond of the arts, but his bad taste prevented him from doing much good. Vespasian established a picture-gallery in the Temple of Peace ; and many an artist must have found employment m the Arch of Titus and the Colosseum. The reign of Hadrian was the last flouriskng period of the arts, though the productions of that age are more distinguished for fiksh and neatness than for simplicity and sublimity. The most important monuments executed at that period were the column of Trajan, the Thermae, the Odeum, the arches of Trajan at Ancona and Beneventum, the Olympieum at Athens, the magnificent villa of Hadrian near Tibur, and the numerous statues of Antinous and the emperors. While Bome was thus fast sinking in every respect, the Ckis tian religion was quietly rising and spreading itself, and by the blessings it was destked to confer upon mankkd was makkg more than an ample compensation for the faffing greatness of Bome. The number of Christians had aheady become considerable"], [661, "CHRISTIANITY. 641 in the western as well as the eastern parts of the empire ; and all the terrors of persecution, and all the opposition of pagan philo sophy, were unable to stop its slow but steady progress ; for it contained all that was calckated to afford peace and comfort, and to inspire a certam hope of better tkngs, for which oppressed and suffering humanity was longing."], [662, ""], [663, "643 CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE.
