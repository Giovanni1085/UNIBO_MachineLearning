As this is the first time that any of the Pious Use Accounts have been published, it may be proper to make a few brief remarks respecting that august body, the Pious Use Trustees, for tbe purpose of shewing who they are, and by what means these accounts have been obtained for publication. Be it known then to all whom it may concern, that there are Fifteen Pious Use Trustees \u2014 6elf elected, all Tories, who hold in trust a vast amount of property, bequeathed for repairing the Highways, maintaining the Free Grammar School, and clothing the Poor. The annual income arising from this property is not less than from \u00a33000. to \u00a34000. The Ratepayers of Leeds were naturally desirous of knowing in what manner this large income \"was expended, as the property was left solely for their benefit. Accordingly the Trustees were requested to pub lish their accounts annually; but instead of complying with so reasonable a request, they have continued for a number of years to throw obstacles in the way of every person who attempted to accomplish so desirable an object, until at length the patience of every one was exhausted, and the Surveyors of Highways for the Township of Leeds determined to bring the matter to an issue, by convening a public meeting for Jhe special purpose of adopting measures to have the property placed in other hands. The meeting was held on the Fourth of March, 1841, and the following is a copy of one of the Resolutions that was proposed and carried almost unanimously: \u2014 Moved by Mr. Whitehead, Seconded by Dr. Smiles; That the whole of the Property commonly known as Pious Use Property, was bequeathed to the Inhabitants of Leeds, for Pious and Charitable Purposes, and for keeping in Repair the Highways in and about Leeds. That the Trustees being self-elected, ought to give an account of their stewardship, and publish their accounts annually : and that their refusal to do so, when respectfully requested, proves them to be unworthy of the confidence of the Inhabitants of Leeds, That the whole property on the North-side of Upperhead-Row was bequeathed by Thomas Waid, in 1530, solely for the purpose of Repairing the Highways, and ought to be held in Trust by the Churchwardens for the time being, according to the will of the Donor. That the income from this property alone is very considerable, and yet only an insignificant sum is given occasionally towards the Repairs of the Highways. That a considerable portion of Pious Use Property has been lost or \" unhappily sunk,\" and that this fact is publicly announced once a year in St. John's Church, on St. John's Day. That therefore it is of the utmost importance to the Ratepayers of Leeds, that the Pious Use property be immediately placed in the hands of Trustees \"who will appropriate the income arising therefrom, according to the will of the Donors, and publish their Accounts Annually. These bold and energetic proceedings alarmed the Trustees, \u2014 their Solicitor addressed a letter to the Chairman of the Meeting, in which it was stated, that a \" Decree of Court'1'' re quired the registry of the accounts in a book kept in the parish chest; and that the accounts were duly registered as the Decree directs, up to Whitsuntide, 1839. An application was then made to the Authorities forthwith, for permission to examine and publish these accounts, \u2014 the request was complied with, and the following are Copies of the ivhole of the Accounts contain ed in the Parish Chest, and in addition to these there arc added the accounts for the year ending Whitsuntide, 1840, which have been supplied subsequently. The accounts arc kept under three heads, \u2014 the Highway Estate,\u2014 the Free School Estate, and the Poor Estate. It will be observed, that the Poor Estate Accounts contain the names of the Tenants, and their respective rentals ; but this is wholly omitted in the Highway and Free School Estates, 'and in lieu thereof, there is merely a statement of the total amount of rents entered as \" Whitsuntide Rents'* and \" Martinmas Rents,\" consequently, the public are still kept in entire ignorance as to the respective rentals of the tenants, belonging to the two largest estates, that bring in an an income of nearly \u00a33000. a year. The analysis of the Highway Estate Accounts shews an income of \u00a313351 . 6s. 5d. during the fourteen years ending Whitsuntide, 1840 ; but of this sum, only \u00a3'2047. Is. 3d. has been ex pended in Repairing the Highways, although the whole income has been left solely for this purpose. No doubt the Ratepayers will be told that about \u00a37000, has been expended in making improve ments in the Town; aud the remainder laid out in improving the Estates, and keeping them in"], [7, "IV Repair. But what are the facts? Why, the accounts shew lhat not less than \u00a32132. 19s. fid. has been expended in making and improving a Road through the Calls, wliich has materially improved a valuable F.state, (amongst others,) belonging to one of the Pious Use Trustees. \u2014 There has also been \u00a32774. 15s. expended on Wade-Lane. \u00a3450. paid to the Leeds and Selby Railway Company, for widening Marsh Lane. \u00a3158. 1 8_ to the Treasurer of the Central Market, for widening Duncan-Street ; and a number of other items of a similar kind, amountiug altogether to about \u00a37000. Now every one must he well aware that the ex pences of these improvements sli-uld have been defrayed by the owners of property in the imme diate neighbourhood. We find new roads made, and bridges built, at a heavy cost, by the owners of property in other parts of the town, without taxing the rate-payers, or spending a single shilling out of the Highway Fund. Besides, we have a Board of Improvement Commissioners, who levy a rate of three pence in the pound annually for the special purpose of making such improvements as arc deemed essential to the comfort and convenience of the inhabitants. The Pious Use Trustees know full well that they ought to expend the whole of the annual income arising from the Highway Estates, solely in repairing the highways, and that all the money which has been otherwise expended has been misappropriated. It was as just and reasonable to spend a portion of the property belonging to the Poor, in repairing a road leading to the residence of one of the Pious Use Trustees, (which was the case in 183*2,) as it is to expend money left for repairing tbe Highways, on an improvement hobby in some particular locality. With regard to the improved value of the Estates little can be said, in consequence of the accounts containing only one rent-roll instead of three, which belongs to the Poor Estate, and shews that the whole of the property was let to nine tenants, who paid a rental of \u00a3224 Ss. lOd. for the year ending June, 1830, and only \u00a3222 10s. lOd. for the same property in the year ending June, 1840 ! If a portion of the income has been expended in improving the value of the Estates, then the whole of the property ought to be let at the most improved yearly value, which is not the case, if Mr. Councillor Howard and Mr. Councillor Garland are to be believed. Mr. Howard stated at a Meeting of the Town Council, held February 1 1th, 1839, that he knew one tenant who had been ruined by the rebuilding of premises he occupied in Upperhead-Row, belonging to the Highway Estate; and Mr. Garland stated in a letter, dated March 25th, 1841, published in the Leeds Times, that he and his late Father had rebuilt premises in Call-Lane and Crown-Street, belonging to the Free School Estate, and thereby improved their value, so as to be enabled to let them at an increased yearly rental of \u00a388. 8_ by which he sustained a loss of \u00a310. annually. But the public are still kept in the dark on this subject, because the Pious Use Trustees have not given the names of the tenant3 and their respective rentals for the two largest Estates ; their reasons for withholding such infor mation are best known to themselves; hut if the trust is properly administered, they have no occasion to fear publicity.
