The seven sleepers can hardly have found more to astonish them when they made their way back to Ephesus after that long afternoon's nap, than I find in the Oxford of to-day. Indeed, it is strange to think what an old fogey a man may become in the lapse of a single decade. We who took our degrees in the seventies are to the undergraduate of to-day as the ghosts of some long-forgotten past; and the young ones let us know it, too. I shall never forget how one dear fellow came down from college to consult me about a tutorship, and when our business was over and we fell to talking of Oxford men and Oxford ways, how gently he put aside my timidly-ventured suggestions with the polite rebuke, \"Ah ! but, my dear sir, the under graduate of the nineteenth century hardly looks at the matter from that point of view.\" And yet, gentle reader, I assure you that when I spoke of myself as having graduated in the seventies (of the present century) I was telling you the absolute truth, nor was I one of those unhappy wights who grow old at the plough, and get through responsions just as their eldest"], [19, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. tJ born is preparing to matriculate, in which \u2022case, perhaps, my young friend's assump tion might have had something to justify it. Yes, it is a new Oxford in which I find myself this lovely summer's day ; and yet, just as a face which we have not seen for years may seem strange and unfamiliar in the first hour of meeting, and yet grow to its old form and nearness as the hours slip by in half-unconscious linking of the broken chain of memory ; so in Oxford, as we wander down its winding streets in the golden afternoon, the old overpowers the new. The old-world corner by Peckwater Gate is still unchanged, with the crumbling masonry of Oriel on the one side, the low gables of Corpus on the other, and the great tower of Merton rising up behind them in its majestic massiveness like some stout giant keeping ward over the portals of an enchanted city. Still the old .familiar chestnut casts its shade over the narrow pavement of Merton Street, and the wall-flowers nod as merrily as of yore along the battlemented crest of the long wall that shuts in Magdalen Park. The deep tracery of St. Mary's spire and the -dark shadows of its sculptured saints and"], [20, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 4 kings have still the mystic power to carry us on fancy's wings into a time that is very far away ; and still as we stand on the dome of the Radcliffe, the centre and 6_u.(pa\\6<; of the city, the mighty piles of masonry reared by the men of old rise up around us into the clearer air and dwarf the pigmy buildings of yesterday and to-day, till the veil of the present is lifted and the mists of the years divide and we stand for one ecstatic moment face to face with our own glorified ideal of the historic past. Then, as the sun sinks low in the west, I wander into my old college, and pass under the ivy-mantled walls and through the vaulted archways into the quadrangle beneath the chapel tower. There, at least, time has wrought no changes. The grey mullions of my old rooms on the ground floor have not crumbled even by a single flake since that last night before I \" went down.\" The oak is sported fast and the stairway is very still, but as I peer in at the smoky pane and see, as through some dim haze of memory, the old oak rafters in the ceiling, and the black oak bookcase against the wall, I seem to look once more into the faces that were gathered round me then. Once more the hearty chorus"], [21, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 5 rings out upon the night, and the merry laugh goes round, and the kindly words that ere evening closed wished me God-speed whisper in my ears. The place seems strangely silent now that all the life and stir has gone out of it, and yet its silence is not the silence of desolation. I remember that once, in my undergraduate days, a stranger spending a night with me in college, wondered that men should dare to speak above their breath before the awful majesty of these time-blackened stones. The speech made little impression at the time, but it comes back to me now that I myself \u2014 like Duns Scotus poring nightly over his still unfinished task amid the chained tomes of the low panelled library yonder\u2014 am part and parcel of the ghostly past that in the flush of the sun shine no less than in the still moonlight radiance, haunts the grey walls of the oldest quadrangle in Oxford. Is it merely the sleep and silence of the long vacation ? or is it that, as a man lives on through middle-age, working in his own little sphere, his own commonplace work of every day, \u2014 some deeper harmonies of the sum of things, some mist-like vision of the myriad links that bind his own work to"], [22, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 6 the great work of the world, arise and touch him ? Certain it is that I can feel to-day as I never felt in my undergraduate days, the serene sense of unruffled calm and deeply-rooted peace, and massive con fidence and strength which breathes from these venerable walls, and thrills my own soul like a benediction. I pass on into the fellows' quadrangle, with its trim grass plots of unviolated green. I see the late roses climbing and clustering lovingly round the arch of the oriels. I hear the thrushes singing their sweetest in the cool glades of the fellows' garden beyond. It is the ideal home of a scholar recluse. I remember when I hoped it might be mine. I remember, as if I were reading the story of some other life, the vision that used to float before my mind of quiet student years within these walls, far from the stir and stress of the great world, far from the drudgery of commonplace tasks, a life without wealth and without want, given up to one great object, the reconciling of the philosophy of the time with the faith that has been the faith of the ages. I can afford to smile at the sweet vision to-day, though the sur-"], [23, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 7 render of it then went nigh to break my heart, for I know now that it was well for me to descend into the arena of life and learn its lessons for myself. They have taught me, those lessons of life, that the creed which dreamt itself complete was but the chrysalis stage of a larger faith and a wider hope, and that the truest philosophy will unveil its deepest truths to him alone who strives to live them in a life of larger helpfulness. And so my dream of reconciling faith and philosophy is gone, but deep down in my heart I know that the reconciliation itself is complete, and that whether I or any man can put it into words, it will work itself out in the fuller life and larger thought of the ages that are to be. The shades of twilight are falling as I pass through the porch once more, and the porter greets me by name. Our old waterman, leaning against the rail, pricks up his ears at the sound, and comes forward to welcome me with genial talk of the doings of the eight, \"which it ain't done so well this time sir, as it did the year when you was stroke.\" So after all I am not quite forgotten, and though the old"], [24, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 8 place knows me no more, my name and remembrance have not quite vanished from the minds of men.

We had packed away in her stern many pleasant creature comforts, not forgetting all the necessary afternoon tea equipments should we be tempted to picnic on the bank now and then, with the Tomahawk's nose well rammed in among the reeds and rushes, and our spirit-stove hissing and bubbling among the buttercups and daisies.

Yet was this regret but as a speck upon the sun of our content. We were all in what was happily described by one of the party as \" great spirits,\" revelling in the delights of anticipation, unconscious as yet of what contretemps might befall, fancying that the sunshine of that exquisite morning would last eternally \u2014 that is, until our river-holiday should be at an end. \" After that the deluge; \" in a word, it might rain just as much as it pleased. Yet even in the midst of our \" great spirits \" another regret was added to that one about the Japanese umbrella. Oxford was looking so very beautiful we were loath to leave her ! We had had such a pleasant time of it wandering about her old-world streets ; such a comfortable time of it, too, at our pleasant hostelrie, the Mitre \u2014 a comfort not blighted in its eleventh hour, as such comfort too often is, by enormous charges handed in for the same.

The hour of embarkation drew on apace. Salter' s men ran about with baskets and packages. The spirit-stove was the one object upon which general attention was focussed. Would it \"work well\" or would it not, was the question of the hour ? The Oxford tradesman from whom it had been procured had promised and vowed many things in its name. We were prepared to hope for the best. The cakes, so carefully packed in a basket all by themselves (and also an Oxford product), were what the immortal \"Bailey\" of Todger's notoriety would have described as \" rather a spicy sort.\" The tins of condensed milk were no doubt pleasanter to manage in their unopened state than they would be later on, when they might show a disposition to upset, and slowly and deliberately emptv their contents upon surrounding objects."], [29, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 13 These troubles were, however, still en I' air. A word about the crew. Place aux dames, so we will mention first \" the confident and inexperienced Cox.\" Nothing can equal this lady's in- experience, except her confidence. Her good intentions outweigh both. With her, right means right, and left means left. If \" Stroke \" bids her beware a bed of reeds that are whispering to each other on the right, she at once crosses sharply to the left bank. If \" Bow,\" a cautious and wary person, draws her attention to a sunken tree on the left, she dashes abruptly into the right bank, and is only prevented from bringing the boat's nose up among the dock-leaves by the united and passionate entreaties of her two companions. This style of steering has its disadvantages, more especially when small craft are numerous, and to rush violently out of the course of one boat is to run incontinently into the way of another. It is also calcu- lated to call forth strong expressions of opinion from the crews of opposition crafts \u2014 sometimes even highly objectionable language. It is, therefore, only fair to the \" Confi-"], [30, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 14 \u25a0dent and Inexperienced One\" to say that her style of steering toned down consider ably under the steady flow of abuse kept up by her companions \u2014 that, in fact, she became rather \"heady\" on the subject, pluming and preening herself upon her excellence as a cox, in consequence of which attitude upon her part she ultimately came to grief \u2014 as will be presently seen \u2014 through offering friendly and well-meant advice to the Old Blue. Next comes \" Stroke,\" poetical, enthu- siastic, and an excellent oarsman, but not in the least protected by the fact of having captained his College boat at the 'Varsity, from much nautical advice being bestowed upon him by the Cox. \" Bow\" completes the list for the present, the Old Blue not joining until a later stage of the expedition. \" Bow\" is a somewhat silent person. He has at length given a sort of modified promise to contribute to the literary per- fection of this book \u2014 a matter of much congratulation to the rest of us, since his ideas, though apt to be tinged with melan choly, are often sound. (This en passant.) He possesses a map of the river Thames, which he consults upon all possible and impossible occasions. We are convinced"], [31, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 15 that he would be highly indignant with the country if it did not agree with the map. \"Bow\" has one aspiration \u2014 one darling ambition. He wants to get his nose burnt a brilliant carmine. To this end he wears a small, dainty white silk boating-cap, set very much on the back of his head. When we ask him how he is, he replies he is \" going on nicely,\" by which he means his nose is \" doing beautifully.\" By the time the sunset light glanced levelly across our path that evening, the bridge was rough and raspy-looking, and the tip a lively red ; but, alas ! no further progress was made on that or any other day, for the steady, brilliant sun shine failed us. No day that came after was as fair and grand, as absolutely perfect as that first day of all ! . . . We are ready to start \u2014 each in his or her place. Then some small forgotten thing causes delay. Stroke and Bow land hurriedly. The confident but inexperienced Cox is left sole occupant of the boat. In respectful attend ance is an ancient mariner in the service of Salter and Co. Cox feels that a little improving conversation would wile away the lagging moments agreeably."], [32, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 16 \" What is the price of that?\" she says, pointing to a dingy-looking steam tug that is defiling the pure sunlight by a trail of dim-coloured smoke. The implied compliment that the river and all that floats upon its bosom is the sole property of Messrs. Salter and Co. does not soften the ancient one in the least. \" Yon's an old ferry steam launch what used to ply,\" he says, grumpily. \" I daresay. What is the price of it ? \" 'Taint got no price. No one wants to buy that\" with a withering glance at the placid Cox. \" Don't they ? \" surprisedly. \" You see, I thought it might be handy to tow us along \u2014 when the gentlemen were tired of rowing, I mean.\" Then comes a pause, during which the ancient one takes off his furry cap and looks into the lining of it, as if he expected therein to find some solution of the lady in the boat having gone mad suddenly. She begins again ; tacks as it were on to another track. \" Is there anywhere we could buy a \u2014 a donkey ? He would be very useful, you know, to pull the boat along.\""], [33, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 17 \" Not as I knows on, marm. I don't know nothing about no donkey.\" \" But couldn't we tether him at nigfhts quite comfortably, or even keep him in the stern when we didn't want him? If his legs were tied securely together he couldn't do much harm, could he ?\" To this the mariner vouchsafes no answer, only stares wildly in the direction in which \" Stroke \" may be expected to reappear, scratching his head meanwhile, and now and then casting a furtive glance at the lunatic in the boat. He evidently feels that his position is a trving one, but looks forward confidently to help arriving presently. It does. The mariner heaves a sigh of relief, pockets his pour boire in silence, and stands gravely contemplating the boat and its occupants. \" What have you been saying to that unfortunate man ? \" says Stroke, gravely regarding the Cox, who is gathering up the ribbons and preparing to pull vigorously bans: into the middle of the stream. He is acquainted with her ways, and feels that the ancient mariner has been having a bad time of it. \" Oh, 1 was just asking the price of c"], [34, "THE CRUISE OF TIIE TOMAHAWK. 18 that,\" replies the Cox, in a casual manner, pointing to the dilapidated steam launch that is now labouring to get round like a disabled old horse at a corner. Then, to prevent further comment, Cox takes the law, as well as the rudder ropes, into her own hands. Forward ,- are you ready? Go!!\" And away glides the Tomahawk over the sun-bright river, each oar as it dips making new sparkles and ripples of light. The fair town of Oxford seems to watch our departure from the serene background of the cloudless blue, against which her lovely towers and steeples look all grandly beau tiful. There is the eight- pinnacled tower of Merton \u2014 mother of the colleges \u2014 and the sister tower of Magdalen, each so beauti ful one cannot choose which to love the best, while the dome of Tom Tower looms in dignified grandeur beyond. \" Isn't this simply perfection,\" says Cox, delightedly, as the rowers pause for a moment and rest on their oars. \" Stroke\" \u2014 always a poetical soul \u2014 gazes rapturously at river and sky, while \" Bow,\" thoughtfully feeling the bridge of his nose, murmurs that it is \"A i \" \u2014 a laconic"], [35, "Merton Coli fgf"], [36, ""], [37, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 21 form of rapture that suits his turn of mind to a T. On, again, and we pass the new \"Varsity boat-house and the barges \u2014 that of Magda len, quite a Cleopatra-like craft, all magenta and gold, that looks as if it ought to be followed by a procession of swans, when it sees fit majestically to \" walk the waters.\" On, on \u2014 over the beautiful mirror, cut ting its surface into shivers of light as each oar dips and feathers. Little birds, happily fluttering and full of faint, sweet chirrupings \u2014 (for the time of out-spoken clamorous song is past) \u2014 flit from bush to bush along the bank, and a red-brown water-rat swims in leisurely fashion across stream, his brown-whiskered nose just above the bright flood, his path way showing ripples as pretty and sparkling as those made by cur own oars. Why should he not enjoy the beauteous summer day along with the rest of us ? I am glad there is no dog to chase him ; glad to see him reach the bank in safety, and creep along under the dock-leaves \u2014 a slim, wet, shining, bright-eyed creature\u2014 towards the door of his hole.

We glide on so smoothly \u2014 we are so content with ourselves and the world (Bow's nose is doing admirably, and he keeps an ecstatic silence), that the sight of Iffley lock is not altogether a welcome one. It is the first lock that the con fident and inexperienced Cox has ever gone through in her life ; but she would die rather than own to any sinking of the heart as the sluices are open and the boat shudders and trembles down to a lower level. \" You have never been through a lock before, have you?\" says Stroke, sympa thizing!)'. She makes an ineffable gesture of the hand, as who should say that locks, with their ups and downs, rushings out and flowings in, have been familiar to her from childhood's earliest hour. The old mill at Iffley looks picturesque with its sentinel-tree keeping watch beside it, and the foam and fall of the lasher sparkles in the sun.

He evidently fears that the sail will cast a shadow, and thus hinder the process of \" colouring \" over which he so tenderly watches. Cox and Stroke exchange a furtive grin. A moment or two more and the sail is up \u2014 the Tomaliaivk lends herself willingly to the new guidance, and we are speeding genially on towards Nuneham, to the soft, rippling laughter of the parted water at our prow. \" Can anything be pleasanter ? \" we say, each to the other ; and \" Bow \" is so pleased with the behaviour of the boat that he forgets the possible interruption of his darling process, and ejaculates \"Jolly!\" a verdict both his companions say \" Amen \" to with effusion. We can, at all events, always look back with unmixed satisfaction to our visit to Nuneham. It would be impossible for any one to see that lovely nook of the world to better advantage than we did. We felt this as our white sail dropped, and \" Bow\""], [42, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 26 paddled us up to the landing-stage. Every possible beauty of light and shade, of sun shine and flickering shadow, lay before us ; and to make all things perfect and \" put in \" just that bit of colour artists love, a bright, beautiful peacock sat sunning him self on the comb of the thatched roof. Glasses of new milk, in addition to some of our Oxford cake, made a pleasant lunch, partaken of in a remarkably primitive and assuredly not weather-tight garden-house. We admired everything, and bought a photograph or two. Here, it may be mentioned that we always bought \" a photograph or two,\" and invariably lost them \u2014 one of the Nuneham pictures being, eventually, the sole survivor of the lot. This might be felt to be a depressing fact, but that every boating-party appears to do the same ; and, therefore, it may be safely concluded to be the \" correct thing.\" Lunch concluded, we mount upwards through the charming woods \u2014 ferns below, a wealth of gentry stirring branches over head, with just here and there the very faintest touch of autumn yellow or red.

There is a swirl, a struggle, a scrunch \u2014 the oar blade is wrenched and cracked, and the poor Tomahawk, like a winged bird, can only just manage tn flutter into Stevens' yard on the island to have the mischief repaired. \" Take about twenty minutes to put a band on it, sir,\" says the courteous water man who takes us in charge ; and the Confident but Inexperienced One suggests that we should wander oft into the town in quest of tea. There never was such a woman in this world !

While the tea is brewing, we loiter up into the market-place, and admire the fine belfry arch of St. Nicholas' Church, and heave a sigh over the old Grammar School buildings, now, alas ! deserted, and the market-cross which Waller's mendestroyed, when Ruthen, \" dozed in his understanding with the long-continued custom of im moderate drinking,\" as Clarendon unfeel ingly puts it, evacuated the town in May, 1644, without striking a blow in its defence.

But we must conduct our reminis cences warily, for the Confident and In experienced One is an ardent Royalist, and even her teetotal sympathies will hardly avail to screen us from her wrath if we dare to hint any scandal about the gallant followers of her \" martyr king.\" In the narrow passage between the island and the Oxfordshire shore we run"], [52, "36 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. an excellent chance of bringing our trip to an untimely end. Just as we are making ready to start a noisy little steam tug comes puffing and blowing through the bridge, belching forth volumes of sooty smoke, and dragging at its tail a line of grimy coal barges, that sway from side to side like drunken revellers staggering home after a debauch. There is no time to re treat ; we can only lie close under the willow by the bank and hope for the best. The tug steams by, and the first barge passes on, and then a great, hulking, un wieldy collier comes lurching over the stream, broadside on, right for the spot to which we cling. One touch of her on our flank and our dainty craft will be cracked like a nutshell. She is ominously near us now \u2014 now only a foot parts her gunwale from ours; but at the last moment, some broad-handed Portunus of the river doubt less administering the necessary shove, she lurches over on the other tack, and we are left safe, though breathless, to make our way through the perilous strait. Below Abingdon the river broadens out into wide reaches set with willows and beds of reed. The scenery is tame and monotonous, and yet to us, fresh from the"], [53, "IHE CRUISE OF IHE TOMAHAWK. 37 waters of the Stratford Avon, whose banks are set so close that in many places two boats can hardly pass with oars extended, the very breadth and volume of the stream is not without its charm. We make good time along these open tracts, and presently glide into the sharp bend of the Culham cut, a narrow channel framed in high banks of richest and most luxuriant green, and spanned here and there by a rustic bridge. A tall poplar or two lifts its tapering head against the blue, and a stolid rustic in smock frock raises his line as we pass \u2014 altogether just such a scene of quiet sun shine, and still water, and rectangular nature as a Dutch or Belgian painter would love to set on canvas with minute and almost painful faithfulness of detail. As we emerge from the shelter of the Canal banks below Culham lock, and strike the broad river again, we realize that a breeze has sprung up. It is not a very strong breeze, and it is not a very good breeze, for it is blowing pretty straight from the Oxfordshire bank, but tor all that it is a breeze, and we determine to make the most of it. Unfortunately, it is, at least, equally determined to make the most of us, and we have no sooner hoisted sail"], [54, "38 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. than we find ourselves whirled away broad side on into the willows of the Berkshire shore, to the intense though politely sup pressed joy of the master of a trim-looking sailing craft, who has come with us through the lock, and to the equally intense but loudly expressed disgust of a fisherman whose fishing we most unintentionally spoil, and who, being unable to vent his dis pleasure on us, relieves his feelings by hurling very choice anathemas at his dog. The said dog is evidently of a humorous turn, for I distinctly catch in the loud barks wherewith he greets us a ring of amuse ment such as my acquaintance with \" folk lore \" (that, I believe, is now the correct term for what one used to call \" nursery rhymes \") has led me to expect from the canine race in the presence of \"such sport \" as this. And rare sport I have no doubt it is \u2014 for the lookers-on. By this time we are in the thick of the willows, which here grow all unpollarded and un shorn. The poor Cox has had to give up steering as a bad job, and cover her face with her hands to save it from the stinging buffets of the boughs, the while her hat and veil are anywhere or nowhere; Bow is vainly striving to hold off the snags with his"], [55, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 39 boat-hook, and Stroke \u2014 one of the worst sailors in her Majesty's dominions \u2014 is making futile efforts to lower the sail and unship the mast. At last the top strikes against a bough sturdier than the rest, slides along it till it jams into a solid fork, and there remains fixed, while the drift of the wind carries the boat away under it, and makes her lean in most perilous sort. How we escaped an upset I don't know to this day, but just as all was lost something \u2014 probably the bough \u2014 went with a crash, and with a mighty heave the mast was raised just enough to clear the thwart and tumble ignominiously, sail and all, half into the boat and half into the water. Ruefully we gathered in the dripping sail, and rue fully we thrust out our oars and paddled on, hoping to escape from the witnesses of our discomfiture \u2014 but to no purpose. The trim sailing craft kept in sight of us for the next three or four miles, and every time she passed us, or we passed her, we fancied there was on her master's face the same look of gentle amusement, mixed with pleased surprise, to find that the three lunatics and their Tomahawk had not yet come by a watery grave. That is the worst of river travelling. You can never"], [56, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 40 shake off an undesirable consort. Day after day vou will find yourself coming across the same boats and the same people, for you are all moving in the same direc tion, on the same narrow line. I think it took us at least three days to shake off our sailing craft, and even then we hardly ever hoisted sail without expecting to see her heave in sight round the corner, and to catch a whispered comment on our audacity in again courting destruction after so unlooked-for and totally unmerited an escape. So after all we settle down to another long spell of rowing, which brings us through another canal cut to Clifton lock, and so on to Clifton Han.pden, with its tiny church perched high on a wood embowered cliff, and a tempting, willow shaded greensward stretching between the lip of the wood and the margin of the silver stream. \"Just the place to try our first experi ment with that spirit stove,\" is the general verdict ; the Tomahawk's nose is run in among the king-cups, the hamper is landed and unpacked, and its various dainties are spread out on the white cloth, while Bow \u2014 being the practical man of the"], [57, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 41 party \u2014 busies himself with getting the stove into working order. But, alas ! when all's done we find that the water has been forgotten, and the purity of the Thames liquid not being above suspicion, Stroke sets off to scull up to the Barley Mow and procure a supply. It is ticklish work bringing it down in the open boiler of the stove, for jug or other receptacle we have none, and the landing of the precious fluid is an anxious moment. But all's well that ends well, and soon the water is bubbling merrily among the hawkweed and the clover, and the cheery cup goes round, and with appetites sharpened with hard work and the long day in the open air, we fall upon the excellent cake with which our thoughtful housekeeper has insisted on providing us. Just as we sit down, or rather recumb, a distant band strikes up and furnishes the music for our feast, and our first picnic in the open air comes off as a triumphant success. Then as the river is wide and the lee ward bank willowless, and Day's lock only two miles off \u2014 above all, as our friend in the sailing craft is well ahead, and not likely to double back on us \u2014 we hoist sail again, this time with better success, and"], [58, "42 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. huddling together in the stern float slowly and dreamily down in the hush of the golden eventide, drinking in the peace and the rest and the quiet beauty of the scene with an eager delight that only comes in its fulness on the first day of holiday after a long spell of hard and anxious work.

Then the scene changes. Trim villas fringe the northern bank, and well kept greenswards echo the cry of the tennis players, and from the quaint-tim bered boat-houses as we pass, craft of all kinds shoot out into the stream, bright with girlish ribbons and scarves, and all the fantastic hues in which the boating man and woman love to disport themselves.

Then on along the field path and through the ancient dykes that still guard the ford as they guarded it in the days of old for the Britons of Cair Dauri against our English fathers, we make for the belt of trees which the tower of the Abbey Church marks out as the site of the village or town of Dorchester. Many a fierce struggle, doubtless, of Briton against Briton and Roman against Briton and Briton against West Saxon and West Saxon against Mercian has been fought out on the line of this great earthen rampart which the inroads of the plough are slowly wearing away \u2014 IWofievoov aporpoov e*ro9 et? ero-i."], [60, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 44 But to-day the scene from the dyke hills is one of singular peace and rest.

It was hence that Bishop Agilbert journeyed with Wilfred to support the claims of Rome at the momentous synod of Whitby. Hence, in a later time, Bishop Eadnoth passed to rescue the relics of the martyred Alphege, or to meet his own death in the English tanks in the great overthrow of Assandun. Hence, last of all, Remigius, the monk of Fecamp, named by the Conqueror to succeed the last of the English Bishops of Dorchester, translerred the seat of his episcopal rule to Lincoln Minster, and left the old cathedral church to become, in the following century, an Abbey of the Black Augustinians. The Abbey Church itself presents a strange blending of architecture of every period and every style, from the 11th century nave of Bishop Eadnoth III., with its Norman superstructure, to the 14th century aisle and chapels and the Tudor"], [65, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 49 porch, the work of successive generations of Augustinian canons.

It is a true organism \u2014 it has lived and grown to what it is.

Stroke. As the crew of the Tomahawk are not in the best of training, the second day's work has been projected so as not to give a very long spell, and we therefore do not feel that an early start is incumbent upon us. The lions of Dorchester too have taken some little time to inspect, so that by the time we set out for Day's lock the day is getting well advanced. But though it is nearly noon the weather is far fiom being bright or warm, consequently on our way to the river through the gardens and allotments of the Dorchester folk the ques tion most earnestly debated is whether or not it is going to rain. Now Bow in the days of his youth has somewhere or other got hold of the tag of weather wisdom \u2014 \" Rain at seven, sine at eleven ; Rain at nine, never get fine ; \""], [69, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 53 and on the strength of this miserably in adequate piece of information, he is always ready to give a forecast to anyone weak minded enough to consult him on the subject. This aphorism, of course, comes to the front directly the subject is broached, and though he is at once confronted bv the obvious objection that as it has rained neither at seven nor at nine his wisdom is utterly out of place, he obstinately sticks to his confident opinion that the day will prove fair, and supports this opinion by adding various unconvincing glosses to his original text. On our arrival at Day's lock this momentous question is of course referred to the lock-keeper, who being a native of those parts ought certainly to know what the local weather is going to be, but he, after the manner of oracles, returns an answer so ambiguous that each party can justifiably claim the award, and the matter is in no way advanced. The Tomahawk lies all ready at the landing stage, so we stow away what baggage we have in our hands and shove off, but before we have got well clear of the first meadow, Stroke's eye is caught by a figure performing strange antics upon"], [70, "54 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. the bridge just below the lock. We easy, therefore, to see what is the matter, and soon discover that this pantomime is directed at us, and our attention is thereby drawn to the lock-keeper's boy pursuing us along the bank with a hand-bag and a big bundle of wraps, the loose ends of which much incommode his steps as he runs, and make it look very improbable that he would have succeeded in catching us if his father had not at the same time cut capers on the bridge to attract our attention. We there fore draw under the high bank and wait ; the boy soon comes up all breathless, and drops his load from above on to the devoted heads of the crew, the hand-bag staving in Bow's hat, which luckily is on the bottom of the boat and not in its usual place.

Then our journey is enlivened by an informal race with a double sculling boat also going down stream ; but the Tomahawk, after a short struggle, gets her nose well in front and triumphantly keeps it there, after which her opponent gradually tails off and is soon lost to sight amid the sudden turns made by the river at Shillingford. So we come to Shillingford bridge, just below w*hich we take an easy to enjoy one of the most picturesque sights that greeted us all that day. Just at Shillingford bridge the hills on the Berkshire side come close down to the water and are thinly clad with trees, while in the foreground, in strong contrast to the long monotonous contours of the wood-covered downs, stands a prettily built hotel of many gables, past which the road over the bridge goes winding up the shaded slope. This land-"], [72, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 56 scape, sufficiently pretty of itself, we happen to see when further enlivened and heightened in effect by the presence of a large pack of foxhounds out for a consti tutional, in company with their red-coated attendants, who as they slowly wind down the slope lend a colour and animation to the scene which makes us long for brush and pencil to render the memory of it a less fleeting thing. Soon, too soon, they pass out of sight and leave animal nature represented only by a rustic sitting whist ling on a gate, so we take to our oars again, and paddling gently down stream, after another three-quarters of a mile reach Benson lock. Here we find ourselves among a regular flotilla of pleasure boats waiting to go through the lock down stream. It seems to be the lock-keeper's main object in life to collect as many boats as possible and put them all through together, no matter at what cost of time to his customers ; and we, although by no means among the first comers, are obliged to wait for the arrival of boats nearly half-a-mile astern of us. However, we manage to find some amuse ment in the fuss made by some of our neighbours, two boat loads of whom have"], [73, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 57 to be discharged while their crafts are taken through in the charge of the lock man. After a good deal of colliding, none of us having room enough to man\u0153uvre with comfort, we all get safely out at the lower end, just opposite the weir, a mass of wild, tumbling, foaming water, grand even now, though the river is low, and which in flood time must be a truly magnificent sight. Clear of this, we find that there is a puff of favourable wind, and resolve to try a sail ; so, spreading our canvas, we extend ourselves upon the cushions, and smoke the pipe of peace. Now, one of the most mortifying circumstances con nected with our cruise is the persistent way in which the wind will keep dead ahead, no matter how the course of the river mav turn and twist ; and to this general rule there are very few exceptions, the only notable one being towards the end of our holiday, when, under the charge of the Old Blue, the Tomahawk succeeded in sailing up stream (so there could be no doubt of the fact) from Bray Church to the top of Cliefden reach.

Their ill-luck, however, in this respect is constant, so much so that after rowing up a long reach in the teeth of the wind, in order to have a ripping sail down, they generally find, after turning at the top end, that the wind has gone round also, and is still dead ahead ! Moreover, the Toma hawk being rigged only with a plain lug sail, and having no keel, can make no attempt at beating up against a contrary wrind, even in those reaches where the river is wide enough to allow of her trying to do so, her lee-way when close hauled being greater than her way. However, on this particular occasion the wind soon becomes so light that, considering the current, it does not much matter whether the sail is up or down.

After Cleeve lock we paddle gently past the wooded islets and foaming weirs that at every stroke of the oars open out new* pictures of exquisite beauty, and reaching Streatley are charmed by the sight of a perfect flotilla of house boats. It is the prettiest of notions that each boat should carry out one leading idea as to colour and arrangement, and all are so graceful and so charming it is difficult to give a preference. One, in and about which the flowers are all crimson and white, has a monster crimson parasol fixed at top, a sort of magnified lamp shade with deep crimson fringe, and its cupola of crumpled silk formed in divisions like an orange.

As we lie off the lawn waiting for the waterman to bring them out, two lazy-looking youths in boating blazers saunter across the turf, pipe in mouth and newspaper in hand, and tumble heavily into a double sculling boat moored off the landing steps. Presently one of them is heard to suggest that the other fellows had better look sharp or they won't get to Windsor to-night, and the pair give a glance out of the corner of their eyes at our Cox to see whether she is duly impressed.

Whether it was the malice prepense of the water man who put them on, or our inexperience in using them, or the crowded state of the locks, or the wrath of Father Thames at sight of an alien craft on his waters, or the bad management of lock-keepers, lock builders, and the Thames Conservancy generally \u2014 those timbers always managed, however carefully we watched them, to dodge in between the fend offs, and score a"], [94, "78 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK touch off the poor Tomahawk' s dainty sides.

By the time we have passed Rennet's Mouth the threatened gale has sprung up stiffly, and all down the next reach our poor Cox is buffeted and numbed by the sharp head wind, hug the Oxfordshire shore and the lee of the willows as she will, and her steering powers are most severely tried. In the next reach things mend a little, and as we draw near to Sonning the wooded hills of Holme Park afford a welcome shelter, and dispose us to look with kindly eyes on the trim flower beds of the lock and the sweet picture of the island-studded pool.

A show of hands"], [95, "IHE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 79 results in favour of a combination of the two meals, and Stroke sets off to forage for bread and butter and a jug of water wherewith to boil the kettle. It is astonish- ing how difficult it is, in a strange village, to find the whereabouts of the shops. The inhabitants of Sonning are apparently all dead or all asleep, or peradventure at dinner, and Stroke wanders helplessly up and down, and is on the point of returning provisionless to the expectant crew, when in a back street he stumbles on a couple of shop windows. One is apparently a grocer's, the other a baker's, and of course he chooses the wrong one ; the baker has nothing but monstrous cottage loaves, and stoutly declines to sell less than a pound of his very unsavoury looking butter; however, an excessive loaf is better than no bread, and the worst butter is better than none, especially as the enemy at last so far relents as to part with half a pound of the same, and Stroke is soon laden with the heavy trophies of his successful search. Then comes the question of the jug, but here the baker remains as hard as his own last week's loaves. There are several handy looking pitchers hanging round the shop, but in vain does Stroke plead with"], [96, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 80 his most persuasive air that if he were allowed to carry off one of them in ex change for current coin of the realm it never would be missed.

How ever, as they must be a good mile ahead by this time it is hardly probable that we shall have the chance of ascertaining whether they manage in the end to verify their expectations. Between Sonning and Shiplake the wind is bitterly cold, and the water rough and lumpy. The stunted willows that grow thick or. the islands dotted in mid-stream shiver and moan beneath the blast, and the river scene is so bleak and eerie that every moment we expect some gnome or satyr to spring from their dark depths, and Cox declares to this day that she distinctly saw her beloved Undine's,"], [100, "84 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK.

But when we draw7 near to Shiplake lock even the cold is forgotten in the beauty of the wooded island at the opening of the lock reach, and as we look back upon the stately chestnut, which seems to spring right out of the river depths in all its glory of glowing green and burnished gold, it is hard to believe that we are not feasting our eyes on the ideal creation ot some great painter's brush. And, indeed, we are now entering on the very home and haunt of our river artists, and as we slip down the river from Shiplake to Henley almost every turn and bend of the stream calls up reminiscences of old Academy days, and the sweet canvases of a Leader or a Murray. As we paddle out of Shiplake lock a steam launch is puffing slowly in, with the usual crowd of small craft hanging on to her skirts, and from one of these we are surprised to find ourselves vigorously hailed.

And here, too, just under the railway bridge, drifting\" from side to side in most erratic fashion, are our old friends the \" Sugarers,\" who have evidently not yet settled down in earnest to that job of getting to Windsor by nightfall.

Here and there a tangled back-water all aglow with lilies tempts us to explore its beauties, and under sunnier skies we might have yielded to the temptation, but in spite of our thick guernseys this loitering in \"a nipping and an eager air\" is beginning to chill us to the bone, and getting to work again we pull on vigorously to within a quarter-of-a-mile of Marsh lock, when we discover to our disgust that the lock is even fuller than usual, and that there is no hope of getting in for twenty minutes at least. All we can do is to make the best of a bad job, and drift down as much under the lee of the Berkshire shore as possible. Even then we are ten minutes too soon, and in those ten minutes the Sugarers are upon us, and in company with a string of barges, a steam launch, and a goodly gathering of small boats, we enter the lock together."], [103, "THE CRUISE OF IHE TOMAHAWK. 87 The sensation of the small potatoes in a sack when the said -sack is vigorously shaken must bear a very close resemblance to those which we experience during the next ten minutes. The whole surface of the lock is covered with craft of all sorts and sizes, and as the water begins to go down, the swirl sends us bumping, thumping, banging against one another and against the sides of the lock, jams our nose into the stonework in spite of all Bow's efforts to keep it off, sweeps our stern out against the bow of a helpless canoe in utter dis regard of Stroke's convulsive clutch on the lock-chain, lurches the rowlocks of the Sugarers' bow-side over our stroke-side gunwale, and threatens to pitch us both together against the stern of the steam launch, which every now and then, like some big fish among a shoal of minnows, gives an angry swish with its screw and sends us spinning back again to the tail end of the lock. In one of these convulsive chassees Bow* of the Sugarers' boat, a man of infinite presence of mind, contrives to clutch a stout rope that is trailing over the stern of the launch, while his comrades, being evidently right good fellows at bottom, in spite of their little foibles, offer"], [104, "THE CRUISE OF TIIE TOMAHAWK. 88 to take us in tow* in turn, an honour which we politely decline. We have reason to congratulate ourselves on our refusal, for in another moment the lower gates are thrown open, and with a scream and a snort, and a furious lashing of the water, the steam launch makes her way out of the lock, and rushes off at full speed towards Henley, dragging the double-sculling boat after her. All the way down Henley Reach we see her tossed and flung from side to side like a shuttlecock by the wash of the screw \u2014 now her bows are lifted clean out of the water, now they are almost buried in the surging waves ; first one gun wale and then the other leans ominously near the surface of the stream.

Then after a short stretch along willow clad islands lined with gaily-painted house boats and trim garden plots gay with many-tinted flowers, we plunge right into the bustle and stir of the river-capital. After our three days' life on the river it is like coming suddenly face to face with civilization again from some unfrequented land.

As we leave the river the last sight that meets our eyes is the steam launch with the Sugarers' boat still fast to her stern lying peacefully at rest against the quay. There is apparently not a soul in charge of either craft, and though we are not destined to know the sequel, yet, as it is now getting on for six o'clock, and Windsor Bridge is still over twenty-one miles away,. we think we are not wrong in guessing that, unlike the old woman with the pig,. the Sugarers do \"not get home to-night.\" Stroke."], [107, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 91 RIVER VOICES. \" heard a voice of water low- In rippling tones the strain repeat, ' Thou art weary, stay thy feet.

The fourth morning of our trip breaks grey and gusty, the greyness soon passing into a monotonous downpour of rain, which makes the outlook from our breakfast table at the Red Lion appear anything but in viting, and Bow's gloomy prognostications seem more suited to the occasion than the Cox's equally confident assertions that it is a beautiful summer morning, and \" if we would only have a little patience we should see.\" Stroke is the first to go out and recon noitre, but soon returns, damp and limp, and delivers himself of his verdict \u2014 \" I"], [110, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 94 chuck at this ! \" while extended at full length in the easiest unoccupied chair, from which, it is clear, that the united efforts of tne rest of the crew will be quite unable to move him. Then Bow makes a sally on the opposite side of the house, but soon returns equally disgusted with the prospects, and an overwhelming majority of two to one passes a resolution declaring \"that Cox's flattering opinion of the weather is not in accordance with observed facts, and does not command the confidence of the meeting.\" Our rooms at Cookham are already engaged, so it is determined to push on thither at once by rail ; the Toma hawk is put in charge of a waterman ; Stroke and Bow exchange flannels for the garments of civilization, and in this wise, feeling ourselves particularly small, we sneak into Cookham. The first two or three days of our stay there were just as stormy and unseasonable as the day of our arrival, so the Tomahawk remained at Henley rather longer than had been intended. During this time, though, we make a point of wearing our flannels and talking big, whenever anyone is by, of our previous feats of watermanship, the face of our land-"], [111, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 95 lord begins to say, as plainly as a face can speak, \" I don't believe those people in the front parlour have got a boat at all, or if they started with one they have had to pawn it on the way down ; \" so it is decided (nem. con.) that somehow or other the Tomahawk must be fetched. The weather is quite too uncertain for Cox to face the risk, so a character, hitherto unknown to the gentle reader, appears under the sobriquet of \" The Indian Chief,\" and is induced to take the third place in the crew. Bow and Stroke take an early train on the following morning, pick up the Chief at Maidenhead, and the three proceed to Henley in com pany. The distance from Henley to Cook ham is but twelve miles, so there is no need of an immediate start. The Cookham tobacco having been proved by actual ex periment to be of most undesirable quality, we take a leisurely dander round Henley town, lay in a liberal stock of that most important article of riverside consumption, and when at length nothing better remains to be done, we betake ourselves lo the waterside and shove off for our journey down stream. The whole crew can now be rated A. B. So \" The bow-sprit got mixed with the"], [112, "96 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. rudder sometimes,\" or, at least, so it would appear, for at the start the I. C. is pulling a powerful oar at stroke, while Stroke is rowing bow, and Bow is making the most of his opportunities as an understudy of the Confident but Inexperienced Cox ; and with this arrangement we row7 over the famous regatta course. The time is carefully kept, but, not to excite envious feelings in the bosoms of the L.C, T.R.C., 6.U.B.C., C.U.B.C., etc., etc., shall now7 be kept \u2014 dark. Having performed this remarkable feat to our complete satisfaction, we easy shortly below Temple Island, and resolve to try a sail. It is voted unanimously that sailing is the \"perfection of motion,\" and the vote has just been carried when we reach the bend at the bottom of the reach \u25a0 \u2014 perhaps 300 yards below the place where we had hoisted our canvas \u2014 and then, of course, the mocking breeze goes dead ahead, and we are ignominiously blown straight into the reeds on the Buck's bank. \" Haul her down ! \" cries Stroke. Bow gets out the sculls and leisurely pulls her down to the lock. Below lock we stay some time, hang ing on to a stump by the boat-hook and watching the water, much swollen by the"], [113, "THE CRUISE OF TIIE TOMAHAWK. 97 late rains, tumbling, and foaming, and rushing over the weirs, and between the islands, stirring the reeds and making the overhanging willows glisten in the sun beams with its spray, until Bow begins to get impatient, and vows \"that confounded boat-hook will pull his arms out of their sockets\" if Stroke does not quickly finish that \"Pome\" of his, and let us out of this. Besides, what can there be to write a pome about in a lot of muddy water tumbling about between two muddy banks ? So we let go, and if Stroke docs light upon an inspiration at Hambledon lock he finds other words to express what he saw. Then to our oars again, Stroke and Bow return ing to their accustomed seats, while the Indian Chief guides our way past Magpie Island, a great mass of beautiful verdure right in mid-stream, and so to Medmenham Abbey, that house of most unsavoury and unsanctified memory, with the motto \" Fay ce que voudras \" inscribed over its door. After a short discussion we decide not to land, and push on past the beautiful locks at Hurley and Temple into the fine stretch of water, enlivened by large houses (con spicuous among which is Bisham Abbey) and fair gardens, at the bottom of which H"], [114, "98 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. stands Marlow. We find this reach much affected by lady punters, most of whom are steering an erratic course up and down and straight across the stream, their course at any given moment having but the faintest connection with their ultimate destination, so that Bow, who has now again taken the rudder-lines, is sometimes hard put to to choose his course, a punt, which a moment before had been ap parently safe under the Bucks bank, suddenly shooting forth from that harm less position right before the Tomahawk's nose; indeed, several times ere Marlow is reached the steady stroke of the pair has been interrupted by a sudden shout of \"Hold her!\" and a collision narrowly __/ escaped. Bow has no confidence whatever in his own swimming powers, and does not at all like the idea of being suddenly called upon to plunge into the foaming tide to the rescue of some distressed damsel \" who would more likely have to pull me out, don't you know ! ' and is much relieved when at Marlow lock Stroke relieves him of the responsibility, and he is allowed for the rest of the journey to occupy his accustomed position. Thence, without any"], [115, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 99 adventure, we pull down the lovely Quarry Wood reach, and so to Cookham, where we have the satisfaction of feeling ourselves immensely raised in the estimation of our worthy and genial landlord, who has been informing Cox that we are not at all likely to return before sunset, w7hereas, in fact, we reach our quarters in time for a very late lunch ; and his role of prophet being thus discredited he is henceforth at all times willing to allow that there is more in the crew7 of the Tomahawk than \" anyone would have supposed to begin with.\" Bow Days at Cookham speed by pleasantly enough. The weather is variable, but cannot be described as cruel, since here and there we get a perfectly royal day, when the river that flows beneath our lawn is so beautiful with shade and shine \u2014 so beautiful by day, so perfect by night \u2014 when the moon silvers its ripples, and the trees upon its banks show black against the purple sky, that we are never tired of watching it. It seems we have so far omitted to state"], [116, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 100 that all along we had looked forward to making Cookham our headquarters, and had arranged our sojourn at the pretty Ferry Hotel there by correspondence with the landlord of the same. Nor did we ever regret this selection of a pied-a-terre. Nothing could exceed the kindness, con sideration, and courtesy of \" mine host \" of the Ferry and his charming young wife during our three weeks' sojourn at that comfortable hostelry. Never was the rush of\" comings and goings,\" inseparable from a river-side hotel, permitted to make our comfort and well-being a forgotten thing. The service was good and attentive, the meals nicely served, and every assistance given to us in the many expeditions we undertook to various parts of the river and country. When we had friends to tea \u2014 in other words when personages hitherto un known in this narrative of ours \u2014 but hence forward to be recognized by the gentle (or otherwise) reader under the titles of our Queen and Princess, came to visit us, we were granted the use of a delightful sitting-room with big bay window fronting the river, and delicate cakes of curious kind were furnished as viands for \" the Fair.\""], [117, "TIIE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 101 On these festive occasions our party was further augmented by a certain \" Warrior Bold,\" who lets on to be \"no end of a hare \" with an oar, but in whose skill we felt but the shakiest confidence, a family legend existing that he once steered his barque \u2014 not \" to Erin's Isle,\" but into a mud-bank, where he had to sojourn the greater part of a night. In vain he sar castically pointed out that he couldn't land us on a mud-bank, because there \" weren't no mud-banks anywhere around ; \" con fidence was lacking, and everyone smiled sardonically at every opinion given utter ance to by the Fire-eater (who also proved to be a cake-eater and jam-consumer of no inconsiderable skill).

Suddenly somebody remem- bered that Marlow Regatta was going on, and that there was to be a procession of lanterns on the river. Then someone else whispered the magic word \" fireworks,\" and that settled it. We must go \u2014 but how ? Marlow is four miles up the river, and though Stroke and Bow protested that they were as \" fresh as paint \" and as \" fit as figs,\" Cox would not hear of their adding another eight miles to the work of the day. Stroke suggested a certain pony and trap, w*hose merits had already been tested in sundry inland expeditions ; Bow, who is great on Bradshaws and time tables, hinted at a special excursion train put on lor the occasion ; visions of possible steam launches calling at the Ferry Hotel rose belore the mind's eye of Cox, when our difficulties were suddenly resolved by the appearance of a dens ex machina, in the shape of a very undersized, very unkempt, and generally very dilapidated-looking Irishman, who, w*ith a piteous tale of the difficulty of getting work, besought us to give him a \" job in the towing line.\" How stupid of us not to think of it before 1 It was the very thing we wanted, and a few minutes more saw a bargain struck,"], [124, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 108 t our Irishman sent to meet us on the tow path, the crew bundled into the Tomahawk with a good supply of overcoats and rugs, and ourselves paddling up through the bridge to take up the towing line. The way that Irishman went to work would have done your heart good to see. First he took oft his coat and, folding it carefully into a ball, chucked it to Bow to be stowed away in the boat. Then he slowly turned up his shirt sleeves to the elbow, and spat in his hands, and tightened his bootlaces, and pulled his cap well down over his ears. Then from the middle of his body he slowly unwound coil after coil of an enormous tow-line, growing smaller and smaller in the process, till at last we began to wonder whether, when the last coil was unwound, there would be any Irishman left to hitch it to. However, the coil came to an end at last in abroad belt, which he slipped nimbly over his shoulders, the other end of the line, deftly caught by Bow, was made fast to the mast, and with a skip and a jump, expressive doubtless of his joy at having secured a \" job,\" our man of draught set off upon his journey. We shall not soon forget the beauty of that evening. It was close on sunset when"], [125, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 109 we started, and by the time we had passed the tall poplars and the railway bridge at Bourne End, the sun w7as sinking over the Chilterns in a splendour of crimson and gold. Against the flush of the western horizon the clear cut outlines of the trees stood out with almost startling distinctness, and, above, the sky was one sea of mellow light, with here and there a pink-flecked island of cloud afloat upon its surface. But below, in the valley, the light was fading fast. The distant woodlands had melted into a tender haze of blue, and the tall elms in the nearer pastures were deepening to deepest indigo against the saffron sky. Beyond them the grey spire of the church rose from a haze of lilac vapour like some weird wraith of the mist. The feathery osiers on the bank still kept a glimmer of green, but the high banks and their crown of waving grasses had faded into a blurred mass of greys and browns, and the only light below to answer to the light above was where on the mighty sweep of the flood the surface of silvery pearl was broken by myraid gleams of opal and agate and amethyst, as the racing eddies caught and broke into a thousand changing hues the waning light of the west."], [126, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 110 Then, as we swept on under the curve of the Quarry woods, the darkness deepened, the sunset glow faded away to the palest primrose flush low in the west, and the southern sky took an intenser azure behind the dark outlines of the trees, and all the valley faded from our sight and left us alone on the deep violet stream, on which only here and there the blue light of Damascened steel would flash from the sky above : \u2014 alone, with only the soft whirr of the bat's wings, and the soft swirl of the waters about our bow*s, and the ghost-like vision of some belated swan glimmering faint against the black back ground of a bed of reeds. At the tail of the mill race we run ashore, take our tow-line and our Irishman on board, and plunge into the darkness of the lock, to emerge on the upper side into a vision of fairyland. All the river from the lock to the sus pension bridge, and far above it, is alive with many coloured lanterns of every size and shape and hue. Lines of lanterns pick out the timbers of the bridge which spans the mill race. Strings of lanterns mark the main lines of every house along the river front. Lanterns of every variety of"], [127, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 111 \u25a0quaint design hang from impromptu scaf foldings on wave-lapped lawn and quay, their tremulous reflections crossing and interlacing with one another, and weaving over the whole face of the stream a gold meshed web of ever-shifting rays. Across this mazy net- work of light and shade shoot -countless boats of every size and build. For a moment their dark shadows mar, as they pass, the golden lines of the river, but in a moment more the ruffled surface breaks again into a brighter glory of ruby and sapphire and emerald, as the ripple in their wake catches and reflects the gleam \u25a0of the lanterns that from mast and spar and line dangle and quiver and dance in the soft night breeze. From beyond the bridge come the sweet strains of a band, softened and mellowed by the watery dis tance. Snatches of song, and fragments of banjo melodies breakout from time to time on boat or bank. From above comes the murmur of a great throng, and from below the deeper murmur of the weir, and each sound as it passes is caught up and etherealized and liquefied by the low voice of the river, till it mingles and blends with the rest in one soft harmony of content. We make our way slowly up to the"], [128, "112 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. lawn of the Anglers' Inn, above the weir,. and there dismiss our Irishman with the wherewithal to refresh his inner man, and with strict orders to meet us again at the same spot at ten o'clock. By this time we have realized that knocking about the river at night without a light may be a somewhat dangerous process,^and one of the party accordingly undertakes an expedi tion up the quaint High Street and returns with a good supply of lanterns and spars and twine with which we proceed to rig the good ship Tomahawk as she has assuredly never been rigged before ; and with lanterns aglow and a sharp look-out kept in the bows proceed to paddle up stream to wheie a dense throng of house boats and craft of all kinds is gathered round the steamer which bears the band. We hover on the outskirts of the throng as it moves slowly down the stream; we run in among the spectators on the Bucks bank ; we watch the crowds gathered on the Berkshire shore ; we pause under the Suspension Bridge to listen to the chatter and the laughter of the passing troops of sightseers. Everywhere there is the same light-hearted fun, the same child-like enjoyment of the beauty of the scene, the same good-"], [129, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 113 humoured acceptance of the little jars and collisions that are inevitable when a great crowd of men and boats is gathered to- gether.

Stroke, who started from Cookham plain \" sir,\" had become \"your lordship\" by the time he rejoined us, and would doubtless have risen to \" your Royal Highness \" had the sum been three shillings instead of two, and the time half-an-hour later. However, our Irishman was not too far gone to be able to tow, and, hoping that the exercise would tend to sober him, we slipped down through the lock, and started him again on the tow path below the mill race.

He would start off at a violent run"], [131, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 115 that tautened the tow rope with a sudden jerk and banged the Tomahawk' s lanterns against one another till they quivered again. Then he would slacken his pace gradually till the rope dipped half its length in the river, and we were apparently left to drift down the stream. Then, just as we were getting out the oars to put in shore and ascertain whether he had gone to sleep in a ditch, he would be seized with a fresh spasm of energy and go off once more at a pace that wrjuld nearly drive the Toma hawk's nose into the bank, and by upsetting us all into the pitch-black river under the darkness of the Quarry woods go near to bring this veracious chronicle to a moist and unpleasant termination. We had never realized before how dangerous might be a night voyage on an unknown river with a swift stream and only the faintest glimmer of light, and one of us, at least, was heartily glad when we emerged from the shadow of the woodland into the moonlit reach by the Spade Oak Ferry. From that point our voyage was smooth and easy enough.

As the last thing of which we were conscious before falling asleep was the sound of the brogue raised in energetic protest against the refusal of the \" boots\" to fetch any more beer, I am inclined to think that that question was prompted rather by a polite consideration for our prejudices than by any overmastering thirst for so innocuous a beverage.

He is not the least like a gondolier, nor does his labouring craft remind us of the City of the Bridge of Sighs.

The jalousie de metier is at its height. The boat answers to the light touch of the new hand as perfectly as a tender mouthed horse to the bridle ; it seems as though the ropes are hardly touched ; the stalwart figure in the stern never moves or stirs, and yet the Tomahawk glides on her way, keeping to an inch the right track, never in the way of other craft, never \" under the willows,\" or aimlessly running her nose in among the reeds, as is, alas ! sometimes the case, when Cox has the ropes about her w*aist, and is driven to the ignominious necessity of agitatedly declar ing she \" really cannot imagine what is the matter with the rudder ; it won't pay the smallest attention even to the strongest hint ! \""], [138, "122 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK.

For a time we are inclined to regard the child as a martyr; but \"Tommy\" soon lets us know7 that he is a willing enough slave of the galley, and we are informed that he is \"past drowning,\" in fact, a completely amphibious anni-meal, as much at home \" on sea as on land.\" We find also that this \" midshipmite \" is not without natural protectors, or at all events one anxious relative, for on a moonless night we were amused to hear a loud-voiced old woman soundly rating a party of pleasure-seekers"], [140, "124 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. for wanting to be ferried over \" at such an hour,\" and keeping \" the child\" out on the dark river \" till midnight ; \" an exaggeration that appeared to us quite allowable, though she needn't have added, with a fresh spurt of indignation, \" I suppose you'd like to see him drownded ? \" an accusation by which they appeared to be too much cowed to find any reply. Together with its interesting characters Cookham also had (for us) its mystery. We get into a way of saying to each other at odd moments, not \" Who is Sylvia ?\" but \" Who is Jerry ? \" Who indeed ? We never knew \u2014 crave as we might for knowledge. The way in which the existence of such a person as \" Jerry \" was made known to us was sudden, indeed somewhat \" too like the lightning, etc.,\" for, one quiet evening, all grey cloud above and steel coloured water below, a sleepy, restful night, full of the gentle swirl of the river and of branches stirred by a tender breeze, a sudden flare of fireworks, a sudden rush and boom of rockets tore the silence to shreds, and brought us all rushing out down the lawn. We heard a voice from far over the bridge say in a deep and sepulchral tone, ' That's Jerry, that is ! \" and a guttural"], [141, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 125 laugh in reply, as if \"Jerry\" was a jest familiar in their mouths as household words. We went home pondering on Jerry. A few nights later on, in fact just before we struck camp and set out on the march home, another violent outburst of illumina- tions and rockets turned all the sleeping river red and gold. Again we rushed out into the glare and glitter, again we heard the deep sepulchral voice far away by the bridge, yet clearly heard by reason of the clearness of the night, \"Jerry's at it again, so he is ! \" . . . For the future when we see fireworks, we shall always say, \"Jerry's at it again, you see ! \" but we shall never, never know who Jerry was. All pleasant things (as well as all dis agreeable things) come to an end, and now \u2014 alack the day ! \u2014 our riverside life is drawing to a close. Our Queen and Princess have been to see us for the last time. We have been to see them for the last time. The Warrior Bold has bid us farewell and shed a silent (and invisible) tear \u2014 in fact a \"soldier's tear\" \u2014 on the occasion. We are all decidedly low. We have had such a real good time, it has"], [142, "126 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. been such a \" good joy \" altogether! Of course, it would have been still better had we not forgotten to bring the Japanese umbrella, and Cox regrets having run the nose of the Tomahawk so often into the bank \u2014 needlessly \u2014 no one wanting to land. Bow also regrets the premature termina tion of his hopes as regards the \" colour ing \" of a certain feature of his interesting countenance ; yet these are but spots upon the sun. We have had a happy, merry time of it \u2014 passed through all the land that lies \" on either side the silver streak,\" through fair woods and gentle mead, by town and hamlet, past God's landmarks, spire or tower. We have watched the dawn of morning, the glory of noon, the sweet calm and restfulness of eventide, the holy quiet of the star-gemmed night \u2014 and now with energies braced and invigorated, with spent nerve-power restored to elasticity, with brains cleared of cobwebs\u2014 -back to work and workaday life ! As Stroke has told us \u2014 \" After labour rest is sweet ; Sweet is labour after rest.\" And we have learnt, and learnt well, the beauty of the dual truth. There is some-"], [143, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 127 thing sad in our last row on the kingly Thames. The loose-strife nodding gently in the wind seems to be bidding us fare- well. The lock-man takes the guise of a friend (though he has bullied us so about the registration plate on the Tomahawk) \u2022 the little drowned forget-me-nots at the edge of the water seem to be watching us with wet eyes. We are rather a silent party, and Cox steers more spasmodically than even her usual \" form,\" feeling decidedly \" low\" and too generally limp to give her mind to anything seriously. At night the Banshees begin to wail around the Ferry Hotel (doubtless keening over the near departure of the crew of the Tomahawk) \u25a0 the wind rises to a gale towards midnight, lashing the water into miniature waves, swirling through Lhe branches of the trees hard by, until they sound like a far-off sea. The sprays of the ivy and jasmine scratch at our windows as though they wanted to seek sanctuary from the storm. It is a terrible night, and in the morning we find that the magnificent Gloire-de-Dijon rose-tree, that has been the pride of the Ferry for many a long year, clothing the gable of the hotel in a garment of blossom summer afte.r summer, is torn ruthlessly from its hold-"], [144, "128 THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. ings, and its grand centre stem snapped in* two. Our landlord and his wife stand looking disconsolately at the ruin thus made by \"rude Boreas\"; and various members of their household stand at re spectful distances, sympathizing with them. It is all sad. They are sad. We are sad. The roses \u2014 poor draggled, beautiful things, with their pale saffron heads drooping and broken \u2014 are saddest of all ! By eleven o'clock Bow has departed northward, looking as if he felt the shabby and jolty little omnibus, that takes him to the station, a poor exchange indeed for the light and taut Tomahawk, and the freedom and beauty of river-life. . . . Stroke and Cox go on their diverging way later in the day. They, too, are conveyed to the station by the jolty omnibus, and are watched away by the courteous \" host of the inn ; \" they hope regretfully. They feel sentimental towards the countless white geese that sprinkle Cookham Common as thick as plums in Christmas pudding, and give forth deep sighs as they see their pony and trap being got ready for some body else. But worst of all \u2014 oh, sad and cruel sight I \u2014 there at the railway station they see the"], [145, "THE CRUISE OF THE TOMAHAWK. 129 Tomahawk bound and chained upon a truck, covered with unsightly tarpaulin and looking thoroughly abashed, and as much out of place as a \" fish on a gravel walk.\" \" Oh, look at the boat ! \" cries Cox, standing at the extreme edge of the plat form, and feeling ready to bring the case instanter before the Society for the Preven tion of Cruelty to Animals. \"How sad it must feel \u2014 with no bright river to sit upon, and none of us in it ! \" Stroke acquiesces, but suggests the cheery reflection that we shall find the Tomahawk safe and sound w7hen we reach home, sitting upon the silver Avon that flows through Shakspere-land, a river that, though not such a grand stream as old Father Thames, is still very lovely in its way, which is certainly consoling. There are not many \" outings \" in life which one can look back upon with pleasure altogether unalloyed ; but we feel that the cruise of the Tomahawk \u2014 our holiday upon the river \u2014 is one of them.
