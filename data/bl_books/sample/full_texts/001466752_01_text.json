Under the impartial and judi cious administration of your Grace we hope to fee extinguissied those baleful animosities, which men of a certain description have industrioufly fomented by various violations of law and equity ; men led by views of private advantage, regardless of public ruin. The sense of ancient hereditary greatness and no bleness of soul, the exalted sentiments of genuine political freedom, habitually implanted in your fa mily and connexions, afforded the justest ground for public joy in the expectation of such a masculine and comprehensive system, as might, by a liberal and upright policy, consolidate the entire popula tion of the British Ilands into a mass impregnable to all foreign force. This expectation has found the utmost encouragement which circumstances, and the sliortness of time since your accession to power, could admit.

The abridgments, which have hitherto appeared on this subject, are almost all hastily and ignorantly written, the best of them unsatisfactory, deficient in matter, and in some parts erroneous ; nor were Hume and others of our best historians acquainted with those successful investigations which have been made con cerning the ancient inhabitants of these islands, in vestigations long neglected, and reserved for the ju dicious, acute, and laborious Pinkerton : nor, ex cept by some writers, as Lyttleton, who have chosen particular periods of history for their subjects, have attention and judgment been sufficiently employed in the comparison of authorities, for the detection of error, and the establishment of truth. My de sign in the following work is to compress within a space comparatively narrow, without obscurity or confusion, all the authentic matter of British records, which can be thought deserving of a place in the memory, or subservient to the solid purposes of his torical knowledge. The expediency of such com pendious compilations encreases with the growing multiplicity of Books. By the multitude of these are frequently men, who wisli for information, dis tracted or deterred, or are confounded by the pro lixity of their details. The great Edward Gibbon, whom I consider as the chief of modern historians, has observed, in his admirable account of the De cline and Fall of the Roman Empire, that \" a minute accumulation of circumstances must destroy the light and effect of those general pictures which compose the use and ornament of a remote history.\" Since for"], [27, "\u20222 BRITISH ILANDS. for the clearness of historical information some Chap.

They are generally of an undulating surface, in some parts abrupt with mountains, and almost every where copiously supplied with springs and streams of wa- ter. Situate in the Atlantic, they differ much in the constitution of the air from continental coun- tries between the fame parallels. Their portion of the atmosphere, replete with vapours exhaled from the ocean, presents oft a clouded and gloomy sky. Moisture predominates ; fogs and rains are frequent ; the latter seldom heavy. The weather is variable, and the seasons so irregular, that com- fortably warm days are not unfrequently experienced in winter, and cold in summer. Generally in Sep- tember and October the temperature is mild and the sky serene. The spring is accompanied with sharp winds from the north and east. Often agitated with tempests, and never otherwise than in a state of ven- tilation, the air, though very moist, is far from in salubrious. Throughout the year the temperature is uncommonly mild, the earth is clothed with almost perpetual verdure, free from those heats which em brown the continent, and those long continued B -2 snows j"], [28, "+ Chap T. Sketch of Britain. HISTORY OF THE snows, under which its northern regions are buried in winter. These ilands extend through a tract of ocean in length almost eleven degrees of latitude, or seven hundred and sixty English miles ; and in breadth twelve degrees of longitude, or five hun dred and eleven miles. The aggregate of their areas amounts to near eighty millions of English acres, or fifty millions of Irish measure. In Britain, far the greatest, commences the au- thentic history of these ilands. Hardly twenty English miles, is the breadth- of Dover strait, the narrowest part of the Englissi channel which sepa- rates this region from France. Britain has been dis- tinguissied by the epithet of great from the French province of Brctagne, cognominal with it formerly. Its form, in which can hardly be seen a resemblance to any geometrical figure, has been compared to a triangle terminating in three promontories, the Kentissi Foreland, the Land's End, and Dungsoy Head. Broadest in the south, it narrows to the north with great irregularity, variously indented, especially on the western side, by numerous inlets. Of these a few from their magnitude are more par ticularly exposed to notice, as the Severn sea or Bris tol channel, the Wassi, the friths of Solway, Forth, Clyde, and Murray, and the long narrow inlet of logh Fine. The last, penetrating fifty miles into the mainland, with a breadth of three or four miles, and a depth of above sixty fathoms, is, though un frequented, the most capacious of those noble har bours in which the iland in general abounds, but chiefly the northern part of its western coast. This"], [29, "BRITISH ILANDS. 5 Chap. I ItsContu.r, This coast of Britain, so scooped into inlets by the attrition of the boisterous main, is almost throughout . i bigh, rocky, and, for the greater part, mountainous. The eastern, on the contrary, is generally low and flat, especially between the county of Kent and Scarborough in Yorkssiire : but some parts also are more or less rocky, particularly from Scarborough northward to the counties beyond the river Tweed. The greater part of the northern coast, fromthe bay of Thurso westward, is a ssielving flat, or inclined plain, through which the rivers descend in almost rectilineal channels to the sea. The southern coast is partly elevated and rocky like the western, partly level and low like the eastern. The land rises variously to the interior parts from the ssiores around ; more or less abruptly from the west ; more or less gently from the east. The main spine of the iland runs from about Ruggby in Warwickssiire, toward the north and north-west, by the Peak of Derby and Craven in the west of Yorkssiire, into Scotland, where it is inter rupted by the vast chasm of Glenmore, a chasm which extends in a strait line, quite across the land, from the sound of Mull to the frith of Murray, and almost insulates the most northern part of Britain. This extraordinary chasm, extending only from a mile to a quarter of a mile in breadth, contains the three fine lakes of Ness, Oigh, and Loghie, which fill its breadth, and so much of its length as to leave only twenty-two miles of land. In the isthmus, only twenty miles broad, which separates the friths of Clyde and Forth, the main spine, in its lowest part, hardly"], [30, "st Chap. T. >~_-Y\u2014 / Mountains HISTORY OF THE hardly rises a hundred and sixty feet above the ocean's level. In its western parts, where the irregularly jagged shores correspond with the rugged face of the country, the mountains of this iland form extensive ranges, and with their bases and ramifications occupy three considerable portions of its surface, In that promi nent division which bears the name of Wales a wide spreading chain, high and rocky, of a sable hue and gloomy aspect, runs from south to north, augment ing toward the north and north-west in width, aspe. rity, and elevation. The masses or groups, which tower above the rest of this formidable range, are chiefly Plinlimmon, Kader-Idris, and Snowdon, con spicuous in rude sublimity. The last named is the highest, rising with its double head to the elevation of near twelve hundred yards above the level of the sea, and mantled with snow eight months in the year, One of the roots of this colossal eminence terminates in the Irissi channel in a frightful precipice called Penmaen Mawr, fourteen hundred feet in perpendi. cular altitude, along the face of which a road is cut at a considerable height above the sea. In the bleak and elevated tract called the Peak of Derby commences a chain, much longer and more continuous than that of Wales, stretching to the North, and named by Camden, from its similarity to the famous Italian ridge, the Britisl. Appenine. In this the chief mountains are Pendle, Pennygent, Ingleborough, and Wharnside. The.last is esteemed the highest, which rises about eight hundred and twenty yards above the ocean; but Cross-fell in Cum- berland,"], [31, "BRITISH ILANDS. 7 Chap. I. berland, which stands separate from the main ridge, is perhaps a hundred yards higher still. Inferior to these, more northern, is the chain of Cheviot, which runs from the south-west, and is connected on the north-east with another chain which tends irregularly westward through the Scottissi province of Galloway. Hence to the Grampian mountains extends a wide expanse of level country, stretching from sea to sea, diversified with some hills, and formerly denomi nated Strathmore, or the great valley, a name now confined to a small portion of this tract. On the north of the friths of Clyde and Forth rises the lofty Granzbain or Grampian chain, which ex tends north-eastward from logh Lomond to Stone haven, forming a stupendous and almost impassable barrier across the iland. Here are several summits above a thousand yards in elevation, but the highest are those of Benmore and Benlawres, the former thirteen hundred, the latter thirteen hundred and thirty-five yards above the sea. In this chain com mences_-the alpine region distinguissied by the name of the Scottissi Highlands, far the most extensive, savage, and dreary of the mountainous tracts in Britain, composed mostly of blue rocks and dussiy mountains piled together in wild and surprising disorder, the interstices of which are impassable with bogs, the sides jagged, embrowned with heath, and furrowed with innumerable torrents tumbling from the crags into low chasms or glens, of which some are so narrow, deep, and dismal, as never to be vi sited by the direct rays of the fun. In this region are the most lofty mountains of the British ilands, crowned"], [32, "( Chap. I. Chalk\", Marshes, HISTORY OF THE crowned with perpetual snow. Fourteen hundred and fifty yards is the altitude of Ben-Nevis, which stands on the southern side of Glenmore at its western extremity, and is reputed the highest of all. Con sidered in a general view, the eminences of the Scot tissi Highlands rise abruptly from the western ssiore, and run toward the north-east in ridges of great length, diminissiing and expanding as they approach the eastern coast, so as to leave between them and the sea of Britain large spaces of low land, especially in that tract which extends along the sea from Aberdeen to Inverness. But between Caithness and Sunderland one of these ridges advances quite to the deep, and forms a high promontory terminating in a precipice, called the Old of Caithness, along the face of which runs a road more frightful still than that of Pen maen Mawr. Many ridges of hills, and gentle swellings of the ground, in the south-east of Britain are composed of chalk, which displays a peculiar kind of landscape of an impoverissied nature, as it lies immediately under a shallow soil, without the grandeur of a rocky scene, or the chearful luxuriance of a sylvan, The stratums of this substance appear to be almost all confined to the eastward of a line drawn from Dorchester in Dorsetssiire north-eastward byDunstable in the county of Bedford to that of Norfolk. In the south-eastern parts are also some low, flat, marssiy, generally very fertile, but insalubrious tracts. Such is Romney marssi of fifty thousand acres on the southern coast of Kent : such are several parts of the coast of Essex : and such is eminently the great level of the Fens, called"], [33, "BRITISH ILANDS. & tailed Bedford Level, which borders the Wash, and Chap. I. extends into Lincoln and other counties, in a length v-'\"'~\"-' of above fifty and a breadth of above thirty miles. Similar to the marssies in softness and moisture, but different in other circumstances, are those bogs of dark, fibrous, miry matter, which are found in the northern parts, particularly Scotland, where, as in the north of Ireland, they are termed mosses. These are subject to a peculiar kind of accident. Augmented through ages by gradual accessions of water, and by the alternate putrefaction and reproduction of the coarse vegetables on the surface, the mass of thick fluid substance swells at length to such a magnitude, that it can no longer be sustained by the matted crust of interwoven roots of plants, with which it is co vered, so that the bog bursts where its inclination is greatest, and pours a deluge of black mud over the adjacent fields. A remarkable instance was the burst ing of Solway-moss, a bog of sixteen hundred acres, in the county of Cumberland, in the year 1771, by which five hundred acres of good land were over- flowed. The elevations of Britain are sufficiently great to Rivers and furnissi from its moist atmosphere fountains for a multitude of rivers, and its inequalities form beds for many lakes in the west and north.

Those of Scotland, whose waters, tinged by the bogs, have generally the pellucid hue of brown crystal, are commonly of so fierce a current, and so obstructed with rocks, that only three, the Clyde, Forth, and Tay, admit navigation. The greatest of the British rivers is the Thames, which glides near two hundred miles, with a deep, majestic, and placid stream, eastward to the sea of Britain. Of a some what longer course is the Severn, which winds, with a rapid and extremely crooked flood, to the Severn sea. TheFlumber is a great estuary or common re ceptacle of many rivers, of which the principal is the Trent, a stream above a hundred and fifty miles long, remarkable for its inundations of the low grounds in its course. Of the Scottissi rivers one only of considerable magnitude, the Clyde, runs westward to the ocean; and the greatest is the Tay, which flows eastward from a lake of the fame appellation. Of the lakes in South Britain, none of which is large, some in Westmoreland and Cumberland are admirably beautiful, as are also many in Scotland, by which the former are far surpassed in extent and depth of water. The greatest and most majestically beautiful is logh Lomond, twenty-four miles long, eight broad, from twenty to a hundred and twenty fathoms deep, interspersed with thirty charmingly wooded ilands, and confined on all sides except the south by stupendous mountains.

I. chasm of Glenmore, between the northern and southern Highlands, are singular objects, nearly strait as artifical canals, closely confined on both sides by mountains, and possessed of this uncommon qua lity, that they are scarcely ever known to be frozen even in the severest winters. This may be caused partly by some internal warmth in the earth and by their prodigious depth, partly by the extraordinary softness of the air in a situation so exposed to marine exhalations. Logh Ness is the greatest of these, twenty-two miles long, one broad, and a hundred fathoms deep. As Great Britain extends through eight degrees Tempera- r i \u2022 1 r .... n ture. or latitude, some variation in its temperature muit arise from that of its climate, but a far greater is occasioned by the diversity of elevations and expo sures of the land. Thus we find that in the low and level tracts, which lie on the southern side of Mur ray frith, beyond the fifty-seventh degree of latitude, the harvest often commences before the end of July, which is earlier than in some of the most southern, but more elevated parts, about the latitude of fifty one : and by comparing places, which differ greatly in elevation, still stronger instances might be adduced. The eastern and inland parts of South Britain, which extend from Wales toward the British sea, differ least in temperature from the neighbouring continent, hotter in summer than the rest of the iland, and colder in the winter than the most nor thern low lands. This difference arises from the great breadth of the land in the south, and its posi- tion"], [36, "n Chap. I. General Face. HISTORY OF THE tion with respect to the neighbouring countries, which render it more similar to a continental region. Exposed to the moist westerly winds, which blow during the greater portion of the year, the western parts of the iland are more humid, and of a more equable temperature, than the eastern : and their inhabitants are less annoyed by the ssiarp winds from the east, which in the spring are detrimental to the nascent fruits, especially in the north. The differ ence in cold and moisture between the two opposite sides is most conspicuous in the northern extremity beyond the friths of Clyde and Forth, where the clouds, wafted by winds from the ocean, are inter. cepted by the mountains, and exhausted before they can reach the eastern coast. Hence oft, while for weeks together the Highlands are darkened with fogs and deluged with rain, the Lowlands on their eastern side enjoy the sunssiine and a clear ssiy. In these alpine tracts the spring is bleak and keen ; the summer ssiort with little warmth ; the autumn from the beginning of August deluged with rain ; the winter long, dark, and tempestuous, during which the inhabitants are secluded from all intercourse with their neighbours in the Lowlands, and often also among themselves, by deep beds of snow, impassable torrents, pathless mountains, and impracticable morasses. Great Britain, with its diversified elevations and expanses, presents collectively to our view an extreme ly varied face, but in general a scenery of uncom mon beauty: As the rude elevated tracts abound in those vast and sublime objects which create astonissi- ment,"], [37, "BRITISH ILANDS. 13 ment, and affect the soul with a kind of awful de- Chap.

In such perhaps no region excels the southern parts of this iland, where the country appears like one vast garden, and the fields display a verdure of the most vivid hue. Farther toward the north, as in the Scot tissi Lowlands, the prospects are less rich ; the land bare of trees and less improved by culture : but the country there is beautiful too : the plains are clothed in perennial green ; and the scene is heightened by a more or less distant view of mountains, romantic lakes, or those majestic rivers which are the glory of North Britain. The length of this great iland, in a direct line from Area. south to north, is five hundred and seventy Englissi miles. Its breadth, in the widest part, from east to west, is above three hundred and fifty ; but in some other places it is relatively -narrow.

That the invention of the monks, who fabricated annals of ancient Britissi acts, was destitute of Grecian art and fancy, is hardly to be regretted, since the coarseness of their forgeries facilitated their rejection, by which the ground was left open for the investigation of truth.

The earliest people of Europe appear to have been Celts, a race described as of low stature, brown complexion, dark and curling hair. These came under a twofold denomination, distinguissied by dif- ference of dialect, the Gaels and Cumraigs; the former inhabiting more southern parts, as France ; the latter more northern, as Germany. By Gaels from France was south Britain first colonized ; Scot- land by Cumraigs ftom Jutland. Their emigrations were performed in boats framed of wicker and co- vered with hides of cattle, such as are still used by many savage tribes, as those of Greenland, who in them accomplissi far longer voyages. Inscrutable are the dates of these adventures. They may perhaps have had place ten centuries, or sooner, before the chris- tian era, and were probably executed in successive embarkations in a long continued period. Passing from the German ssiores, the Cumraigs, or Cumri, were the second colonizers of South-Britain, driving westward gradually the Gaels, or Gailic tribes, who were finally expelled, and took refuge in Ireland. The names orginally given to the mountains and great rivers of a country, by its primitive inhabitants, are generally retained through all succeeding ages.

Among those at least of South Britain the superstition of the druids prevailed, probably introduced from the East by the Ph\u0153nicians. Of the druidic system, of which pre- tended accounts are given by some writers of more learning and vanity than judgement or love of truth, very little is actually known, and that little can be collected only from Greek and Roman authors. It was doubtless a system of profound mystery. Its priests, designated by the name of druids, were for- bidden by the inviolable rules of their institution to divulge to the laity any of their tiogmas, or to com- mit to writing any part of their doctrines, which were composed in verses merely oral, and treasured in the mind by a tedious course of study. Whether or not, however, these priests themselves were acquainted with the use of letters, seems a question not decided. That the Greek alphabet was known to the druids on the continent seems not improbable, as is asserted in a text in the commentaries of C\u00e6sar ; yet that text is suspected to be spurious, the interpolation of Julius Celsus. Their places of worship were lonely groves, awful to the vulgar by gloomy shades and religious consecration. For the oak tree they enjoined extra- ordinary reverence. Over the laity, consigned to in- tellectual darkness, they exercised a formidable sway by the power of excommunication and other modes of punishment. On their altars they offered bloody sacrifices, and among the victims were frequently men, commonly such as were condemned for sup posed or real crimes. Among ihem was said to be maintained a kind of hierarchy, terminating in an Vol.. I. C archdruiJ,"], [42, "IS Chap. II. Goth, the next luha, bliants. Britain known to some anci- Cs.s.l. HISTORY OF THE archdruid, the president of all. To the vulgar they communicated some instructions of a moral nature; and, to inspire them with courage in battle, are said to have given them, in the doctrine of the metemp sychosis, some faint idea of the soul's immortality. In the colonizing of the European continent and British ilands the Celts were succeeded by the vast race of the Goths, the fame with the ancient Scy thians, distinguissied by large limbs and stature, fair complexions, blue or grey eyes, and red or flaxen hair. From Persia, through the western regions ot Tartary, the regions about the Euxine and Caspian seas, are traced the migrations of the formidable Gothic tribes north-westward inro Europe, where in their progress they drove the Celts before them to the coasts of the Atlantic. In these the chief distinction of name and language, with which a historian of Britain is con cerned, is that of Scandinavians and Belgians, of whom the former over ran the countries about the Baltic, the latter the less northern of Germany and France. From the former are chiefly descended the present Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and Lowland Scottissi people ; from the latter the Englissi, Dutch, Flemings, and great part of the modern Germans. So early as three centuries before the birth of Christ are conjectured to have commenced the emigrations of the Belgians from the Netherlands into South- Britain, and of the Scandinavians from Norway into Scotland. Some centuries before Christ the Ph\u0153nicians, the first and greatest navigators of antiquity, appear to have discovered the British ilands, and to have establissied"], [43, "BRITISH ILANDS. 19 Chap. II. Roman in. vafion by Julius Cx lar. establissied a trade in the tin of Cornwall. This, beside the positive assertion of Strabo, is on other grounds extremely probable. Under the name of Caffiterides, the Ilands of Tin, a name afterwards confined to the small iles of Scilly, their fame, but their fame only, reached the Greeks, through the medium of the Ph\u0153nicians, at least near five cen turies before the christian era, as we find in Hero dotus. This name was Greek, and doubtless a translation of a Ph\u0153nician term, according to the custom of Gr\u00e6cian writers, who admitted not into their compositions the harssier words of other lan guages. Above a century later we find the Bretanic ilands mentioned by Aristotle, with the appellation of Albion given to Britain, and that of lerne to Ire land. The ile of Albion was in later times called Britannia by the Romans. Whence these names are derived is only matter of conjecture. Of Britain, however, the Romans knew scarcely more than its name, before its invasion by Julius C\u00e6sar, which is dated sifty-five years before our Savi our's birth. From the pen of this illustrious poli tician and eloquent writer we have the first authentic account of the tribes who possessed this iland. Over all the southern parts had the Belgians spread their settlements, and to these were the transactions of C\u00e6 sar here confined. The more ancient inhabitants were less advanced in the arts of life, unacquainted most ly with agriculture, clothed with skins, and depend ing for subsistence on pasturage. His motive for this enterprise was doubtless ambition. He aspired to the fame of adding to the empire of the Romans Ca a region"], [44, "HISTORY OF THE 20 Chap.II. a region hitherto unknown, a kind of new world ; for such was Britain at that time considered. Find ing leisure from the more momentous affairs of the neighbouring continent, France, whose inhabitants he had in great part subdued, he sailed with an army from a port supposed to have been Calais, and arrived, after a voyage of nine hours, at the coast about Dover, at ten o'clock in the morning, on the twenty-sixth of August. To prevent an invasion the Britons had sent ambassadors into France with pro mises of obedience ; but, as C\u00e6sar had resolved to visit their country, and to receive the submission of the chiefs in person at the head of his troops, they opposed his design. Finding the lofty cliffs, which border the ssiore in that part of Britain, covered with a hostile army, he proceeded eight miles far ther to a low and level coast, supposed to have been that where now stands the town of Deal. The Bri tissi troops, who had shifted their ground to attend his motions, advanced intrepidly into the water to engage the Pvomans in close combat, and prevent their landing. The latter, intimidated by the un usual circumstances of their situation, hesitated to debark, till the Britons were obliged to recede some space, assailed in flank by missiles from the slings and engines of long gallies, which approached the ssiore as nearly as they had depth of water to bear them. Even then the landing was not accomplissied with out great difficulty and a fierce contest, in which the Romans by superior arms and discipline at length prevailed. C\u00e6sar"], [45, "BRITISH ILANDS. 21 C\u00e6sar returned with his army to the continent, Chap. II. after a delay of little more than three weeks in Bri- tain, where his fleet had been damaged by a tem pest, and where he had overthrown the natives in some actions of apparently little moment. In the next summer he sailed with a far greater force, five legions with cavalry and auxiliars, probably not less than fifty thousand men, in a sleet of above eight hundred vessels. Intimidated by the greatness of his armament, the Britons made no opposition to his landing, which was effected at the fame place as in the preceding year. Another tempest, by which his fleet was ssiattered, delayed his military operations. He advanced into the country, incessantly ssiirmissi ing, sometimes engaged in serious combat, and pass ed two rivers, the former of which was probably the Stour. The stream reached the chin in the fording of the latter, which, though called Tamefis by C\u00e6sar, appears from reasons given in the second volume of the Arch\u00e6ologia, to have been the Med way. This commander, whose progress seems never to have extended to the modern Thames, finally abandoned this iland in the end of September, car rying to the continent, as trophies of his victory, a number of hostages, given by chiefs who had sub mitted and promised to pay tribute. From these two expeditions of C\u00e6sar, which him- State of ... ,\u25a0 . *\u2022 Britain. self has recorded, in a manner not quite satisfactory, in the fourth and fifth books of his Commentaries on the Gallic war, and which appear to have been attended with hardly more important consequences than voyages of discovery, we learn some particu- lars"], [46, "\"2 Chap.IL HISTORY OF THE lars concerning the state of Britain. Its Belgic in habitants were agricultural, divided into many com munities or petty nations, which mostly retained the names of those tribes on the continent whence they severally derived their origin. In these presided chieftains, their leaders in the wars which were fre quent among themselves, styled kings by C\u00e6sar, though their territories were so small that in Kent alone were found not less than sour. A confederacy formed against the Roman invader, and conducted by Cassivellaunus, a chief appointed to the supreme command by general election, was dissolved by mu tual jealousy, which principally contributed to C\u00e6 sar's success. Burthened with defensive armour, and obliged to observe strict order in their motions, the Roman infantry were harassed by the rapid and de sultory onsets of the Britons, while their cavalry were overmatched by the war-chariots, which, though mostly fallen into disuse at that time on the conti nent, were still retained in Britain. Driving furi ously their chariots on the hostile troops, and throw ing their darts, the combatants leaped to the ground, and fought with the advantage of infantry against horsemen ; while the charioteers, withdrawing to a convenient distance, kept the carriages ready for their reception and retreat, if they ssiould happen to be overpowered. They thus united the firmness of infantry with the lightness and velocity of horse men ; and such was their dexterity by continued practice, that they could suddenly stop their horses at full speed, in a descent or at a precipice, could turn them ssiort, dismount, and recover their seats with"], [47, "BRITISH ILANDS. 23 with quickness and facility. Beside the chariots, Crap. II. such in appearance as those of the Trojan war de- \u2014 \"* \" scribed by Homer, British cavalry are also mention ed by C\u00e6sar. Wi'h respect to customs we are in formed by this writer that the Britons used woad for the forming of blue stains on their bodies, by which their aspect was rendered more horrible in sight ; that they wore the hair long, and ssiaved all the beard except the upper lip ; and that each ten or twelve men, mostly brothers with brothers and fa thers with sons, had their wives in common. Whe ther or not C\u00e6sar was misinformed or mistaken in this may be matter of some doubt. During a space of ninety-seven years Britain re- invasion mained in a state of independence, unmolested by _iu\u00bb\"nnoU* the Romans, from its abandonment by Julius C\u00e6- Don\"\"1- far, who doubtless regarded not its conquest as a primary object, to the forty-third year of the chris- tian \u00e6ra. Of British transactions in this period we scarcely know any thing. Doubtless the Belgians, while they warred among themselves, extended their settlements to the west and north, perhaps to the confines of Wales and Cumberland. A paramount power appears to have been possessed by a prince named Cunobeline, of whose coinage money is still extant in silver, gold, and copper, of not less than forty different stamps. From the letters on these coins and other circumstances a friendly intercourse is inferred of the Britons with the Romans, and a consequent encrease of civilization among the for mer. At length, in the reign of the emperor Clau dius, the conquest of Britain, which from a variety of"], [48, "54 Chap. II. Dtse-t of Caractacus 52. HISTORY OF THE of causes had been neglected, was resolved by the Roman court ; and Aulus Plautius was sent with an army of probably fifty thousand men, as it consisted of four entire legions with cavalry and auxiliars. This general made such a progress in the conquest of the southern parts, that Claudius came in person two years afterward, in the year 45 after the birth of Christ, to receive the submissions of British princes. In two years more we find Plautius recalled, and Ostorius Scapula appointed to the command in the year 50, when the Roman arms appear to have been rather stationary, or even retrograde, than progres sive. Their superiority was soon restored, the Bri tons defeated in several actions, and the troops led at length against the Silures, the people of South Wales, who had hitherto remained inflexible by force or by clemency. The Silures were Cumraig Celts, ancestors of the modern Welch. At their head was placed Ca ractacus, the most celebrated of the Britissi com manders, who had with various fortune, during nine years, opposed the Roman power. Determined on an obstinate defense, but inferior in numbers, dis cipline, and arms, he marched into the country of the Ordovices, the northern Welch, where he drew to his standard all who dared to fight for liberty, and chose for the place of battle a situation every way advantageous to his own troops, and unfavourable both to the approach and retreat of an enemy. Steep mountains, at whose foot flowed a river with fords of uncertain depth, were fortified, wherever the ground was of less difficult access, with a rampart of"], [49, "BRITISH ILANDS. 25 of great stones. This place, described by Tacitus Chap. II. in the twelfth book of his Annals, is supposed to v-^v^^' have been at the confluence of the rivers Clune and Temd in Shropssiiat re, . the hill of Caer Caradoc. Undaunted by the formidable position of the Britissi army, the Romans advanced and forded the river. When they arrived at the rampart, the disadvantage was on their side so long as the contest was main tained with missiles : but, when, having formed a military shell, a continuous fence against darts with their shields raised over their heads in contact, they had demolifl.ed the rude pile of stones, and came to close combat, the Britons, unprotected by either breastplates or helmets, were unable to sustain the ssiock, and retreated to the highest ridges. But the Romans forced their way up the heights, and with great flaughcer completed the victory. The wife, daughter, and brothers of Caractacus were taken. Himself took refuge with Cartismandua, queen of the Brigantes, a people inhabiting Yorkssiire and other parts to the north. But, as the unfortunate seldom find friends, he was surrendered in chains by this female to the Romans. Supported by a firm unconquerable spirit, when he was brought in tri umph to Rome, he addressed Claudius in a speech at once modest and magnanimous, concluding with words to this effect. \" If the Romans aspire to uni versal dominion, is an unresisting submission of all men to slavery a necessary consequence ? If I had instantly surrendered without a struggle, neither my fortune nor your glory would have been conspicu ous ; and my punissiment would have been followed by"], [50, "HISTORY OF THE 26 Chap. II. Attack of Anglesea. 01 by the oblivion of my name. But now, from a dif ferent situation of affairs, if you ssiall have deter mined on the preservation of my life, I shall be on record an everlasting monument of your clemency.\" So much had the Roman manners become softened at this period, that a full pardon was granted to Ca ractacus and his family ; but of. his future fortune we are not informed. Worn by anxiety, Ostorius died soon after, in ceffantly harassed by a desultory warfare of the Bri tons, particularly the Silures, who fought with des peration and often with success. Cartismandua was driven from her throne by a revolt of her subjects, who were enraged at her conduct, as ssie had banissi ed her husband, and married her armour-bearer. The Roman arms appear to have made no progress till the appointment of Suetonius Paulinus to the government in the reign of Nero. This comman der made great exertions ; and in his third year, the sixty-first of the Christian \u00e6ra, resolved on the in vasion of Mona, the modern Anglesea, a receptacle of British fugitives, and the principal scat of drui dic worssiip. Anglesea is an iland, twenty five miles long, eighteen broad, containing above two hundred thousand Englissi acres, and parted from the main land of Wales by the strait of Menai, which is so narrow as to be called a river, in some places deep, but in others so ssiallow as to be fordable at low water. Its surface is generally level, more elevated on the northeastern than on the opposite side. It has a remarkably fertile foil, and contains vast beds of"], [51, "iil Chap.

The infantry of Paulinus crossed the strait in flat bottomed boats, the cavalry partly by swimming their horses, partly by fording. Extended along the shore was beheld the British host in close array ; wo men running through the ranks in wild disorder, with the frantic rage of furies, in funereal habits, with dissievelled hair, and flaming torches in their hands ; and druids around, with hands raised to wards Heaven, uttering horrid imprecations. Asto nissied by so strange a sight, the Romans stood stupidly motionless, marks, as it were, for the ja velins of the foe ; till, roused by the exhortations of the general and others, who reprobated the dis grace of terror inspired by bands of frantic females and fanatic priests, they russied to the charge, bore down all opposition, and involved the Britons in their own fires which had been kindled for druidic rites. While Paulinus was employed in erecting fortifications to secure his conquest, and in demo lifliing the sacred groves polluted by human sacri fices, a tremendous insurrection had taken place in the southeastern parts of Britain, by the intelligence of which he was precipitately recalled to that quarter. Prasutagus, king of the Icenians, a people dwell ing about the modern Huntingdon and Norfolk, had bequeathed his wealth, amassed in a long reign, to his two daughters and the Roman emperor joint ly, hoping by this act of obsequious attention to se cure the future safety of his family and kingdom. The event was widely different. The country and palace"], [52, "28 Chap. II. HISTORY OF THE palace were plundered, as if conquered by force ; the relatives of the departed king reduced to slavery ; his daughters violated ; and Boadicea, his widow, ignominiously scourged. Enraged, and fearing treat ment still more cruel, the Icenians flew to arms. To their standards flocked the neighbouring tribes, provoked by various acts of Roman tyranny. A colony had been planted by Ostorius, ten years be fore, at Camulodunum, probably where now stands either Colchester or Maiden in Essex. Old soldiers, rewarded for past service by the privilege of colo nists, treated the neighbouring natives with oppres sion and insult, dispossessing them of their lands, and calling them captives. In this they were fa voured by the soldiers of the legions, similar in mode of life, and hoping to enjoy the fame licence. A temple also erected, according to the customary adu lation of the Romans, in honour of the deceased Claudius, worssiipped as a deity, was regarded as a citadel of eternal servitude, the priests of which, under the pretences of religious expenditure, ex hausted the country. The tumultuary bands of the Britons, acting as if apprehensive of punissiment in the end, and re solved on previous vengeance, burned Camulodu num, cut to pieces a legion which opposed them, delivered London to the flames, which even then had become a town of commercial wealth, and gave the fame fate to Verulamium where Saint Albans is now situate, destroying with sword and fire whatever was hostile in the progress of their victory. The number of Romans and friends of Rome, slaugh- tered"], [53, "BRITISH ILANDS. 29 Chap.II. tered by these insurgents, is stated at not less than seventy thousand. Caius Decianus, lieutenant governor of the Roman province in Britain, the ex ercise of whose avarice had caused this revolt, saved himself from danger, as is mostly the manner of such men, by flight into France. But Paulinus, who had hasted from Anglesea to London, and had thence retired, resolved at length, with near ten thousand effective men, to stop the enemy's career. He chose for the combat a ground quite advantage ous, closed at his back by a wood, where he was secure from ambuscades, and could be attacked in no other quarter than the front. In the British army, led by Boadicea, a female commander, a thing not unprecedented in those times in Britain, a total im providence and want of good conduct appears to have had place. When they had advanced with vain confidence and discharged their missiles, in a field where they could derive no advantage from their superiority of number, they were put to irre trievable rout by the impetuous and close charge of the Romans. Their flight was impeded by a line of carts and waggons in the rear, on which they had placed their wives to be spectators of their expected victory. The carnage was enormous, promiscuous of men and women, and even the carcases of slaugh tered cattle were added to swell the heaps of slain. Tacitus informs us that according to some accounts near eighty thousand fell on this occasion, while only four hundred were killed of the Roman army, and its number of wounded was not much greater. Boa dicea, who had, with determined spirit, declared, that"], [54, "HISTORY OF THE 30 Chap. II. Roman proceedings til\u2014 78. that ssie would find in this battle either victory or death, ended her days by poison. Notwithstanding this victory, a famine which en sued, and the devastations of sword and fire com mitted by the Romans, many Britons still continued in arms with fierce determination in the cause of li berty. Paulinus was after some time recalled, whose rigorous conduct had augmented the obstinacy of resistance, and Petronius Turpilianus sent in his place, in whose mild administration the province ta citly subsided into a tranquil state. Peace with the Britons still continued under his successor Trebellius Maximus, but a spirit of mutiny infected the Ro man troops. Civil wars afterward between compe titors for the imperial throne withheld the attention of the Romans from Britain, until Vespasian, hav ing become the undisputed emperor, resolved to pro secute the conquest, and sent in the year 70 Petilius Cerealis to command in this iland. The most nu merous nation of South-Britain was the object of this leader's warfare, the Brigantes, among whom Venusius bore away, the discarded husoand of Car tismandua, who had chased that queen from the throne, the betrayer of Caractacus. The contest was fierce and obstinate : the battles were frequent and bloody : but in the course of five years great part of the country was overrun. Julius Frontinus a man of great abilities, who succeeded Cerealis in the year 75, subdued the Silures, surmounting at once the asperity of the land and the fierceness of the people.

He immediately attacked in their strong holds in their mountains, and subdued with signal slaughter, the Ordovices, who had put to the sword a body of Roman horse. The people of An glesea submitted without a blow, terrified at the in vasion of their iland by the swimming and fording of his cavalry, without boats or vessels of any kind. To secure the obedience of the conquered Britons in the south, he adopted the most effectual means of rendering them contented with Roman government, abolissiing all those abuses of, power and oppressive measures, which had caused peace to be dreaded not less than war. In the second summer he led his army northward, as far as Scotland, where he first spread a terrible alarm by his incursions, and then suspended the war, by which means many people in that quarter, hitherto independent, feeling the dif ference between a state of quiet and hostile devasta tion, submitted to his government. In the follow ing winter he was employed in the establissiing of institutions for introducing among the Britons the Roman habit, manners, arts, and literature, which might soften their ferocity and render them more peaceful subjects. In the few years of his govern ment he found his institutions attended with success. From their progress in literature he preferred the genius of the Britons to that of the Gauls, the in habitants of France. So early were given specimens of"], [56, "HISTORY OF THE 32 Chap.

His war Having, in his third year, ravaged the country cliedo-1\" as far as the frith of Tay, and afterwards drawn a mang3 chain of fortifications across the land between the friths of Clyde and Forth, to secure his conquests to the south of that isthmus, Agricola directed the force of his arms against the Caledonians. These were the descendants of Scandinavian Goths, who had commenced their emigrations, from Norway to North-Britain, about three centuries before Christ, and had possessed themselves of the country to the north of logh Lomond and the river Tay. The tribes of Scotland to the south of those limits appear to have been at that time Cumraig Celts, confined between the Caledonians of the north and the Bel gic Britons of the southern parts. The appearance on their coasts of Agricola's fleet, by whose circum navigation the insularity of Britain was practically demonstrated to the Romans, raised to its height the resolution of the Caledonians for desperate battle, as all safety was precluded of retreat by sea. Without waiting to be attacked, they stormed with fury, but without success, the Roman garrisons, and surprised in the night one of the three columns into which Agricola had divided his army.

A speech re- 84\" corded by Tacitus, as if spoken by Galgacus, their leading chief, to animate these troops, is a specimen perhaps unequalled in its kind. They stood em- battled, in number above thirty thousand, with their first line on the low ground, the rest in gradation on the acclivity, their chariots and cavalry in the plain between them and the Romans. Agricola advanced with a line of eight thousand auxiliar infantry, flank- ed with three thousand horse disposed in both wings, while the legions stood in array before the rampart of the camp, ready, if required, to give assistance. In fighting with missiles, with which commenced the combat, the Caledonians displayed address, eluding the enemy's darts, and pouring thick vollies of their own. But when they came to a close encounter, they were overpowed by the superiority of the Ro- man arms, great shields with pointed bosses, and manageable swords formed for stabbing as well as hewing, against which the little targets, and huge pointless swords of these Britains, were of small ef- fect.

Those Caledonians, who had been posted on the heights, descended with the design of wheeling, and selling on the rear of those troops who were over* powering their foremost line ; but in this they were prevented by the foresight of the Roman general, who had reserved for such emergencies a body of horse, and who, turning their own stratagem against themselves, assailed them from behind. The rout became universal. The Caledonians were pursued with dreadful slaughter to the woods, where they began to rally. They cut to pieces1 the foremost: pursuers, and would have renewed the battle with danger to the Romans, if Agricola had not taken wise precautions. They finally dispersed, and, fierce in misfortune, set sire to their houses, and, leaving the country a desert behind them, retired to a dis tance.

That the progress of ls\"\"~v ' the Roman arms, from the southern coasts of Britain to the Grampian chain, was not accomplissied in less than forty-one years, seems not a little strange, and chiefly ascribable to the misconduct of commanders, when we consider the vast inferiority of the Bri tons in arms and tactics, and their weakness in disu nion, since, as we are informed by Roman histo rians, the little states fought singly in succession unassisted, and thus in succession fell. Of the Ro man affairs in this iland, after the defeat of Galga cus, our information is unconnected, obscure, and scanty. In a period of near forty years after this event, nothing certain is recorded ; but we have reason to believe the Caledonians to have gained ad vantages, and the Roman government, at least in the northern parts, to have been much molested, if not ssiaken. Tranquility was re-established by the em peror Hadrian, famous for his journeys to the seve ral provinces of his vast empire. By this monarch, in his visit to this iland, was built a vast rampart, \u2022 or wall, supposed to have been of earth, in the year i a i, across the land, from Solway frith to the eastuary of the river Tyne, for the security of South-Britain from the incursions of the unconquered clans, to whom he seems to have thus silently relinquissied the northern parts. To the despicable opinion entertained by the Romans of these less fertile tracts is attributed this abandonment by Gibbon, who fays that \" the masters of the fairest and most wealthy climates of the globe turned with contempt from gloomy hills as- D 2 sailed"], [60, "36 HISTORY OF THE Chap. II. sailed by the winter tempest, from lakes concealed in a blue mist, and from cold and lonely heaths, over which the deer of the forest were chased by a troop of naked barbarians.\" To prevent more effectually the predatory inroads of these northerns, which appear to have been re- newed, and perhaps also on other accounts, the Roman dominion was extended northward, in the reign of Antoninus Pius, by Lollius Urbicus, his ge- neral, who, after a war, in which the enemy was re- peatedly discomfited, built a rampart along the line of Agricola's forts, between the Forth and Clyde friths, about the year 14\u00a9. This leader is supposed to have carried still further northward the frontier of the empire. A Roman province named Vefpa- siana, extending to logh Ness, or the chasm of Glen- more, is said to have subsisted by Richard of Ciren- cester, a writer of the fourteenth century, who had the opportunity of consulting records no longer ex- tant. The fact could not be admitted on so dubious an authority if it were not in part confirmed, beside other circumstances, by Roman camps and roads, found in the ssiires of Stirling and Angus, and perhaps farther toward the north. This province however had a very ssiort duration, not more than thirty years at the most, overrun by the Caledonians about the year 170. These ferocious tribes forced also their way through the rampart constructed by Lollius Urbicus, called the wall of Antoninus, into the lands of the M\u00e6at\u00e6. Uncertain conjectures only are made con cerning the derivation of this term, by which were signified the people who dwelled between the walls of"], [61, "BRITISH ILANDS. 37 ol Antoninus and Hadrian.

In a war of competition for the impe rial throne, Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain, one of the competitors, transported his army into France, where, defeated in the battle of Lyons, in the year 197, he lost his life. Septimius Severus, who, finally victor, had become sole master of the Roman empire, sent Virius Lupus, in the following year, with an army into Britain, to drive out of the province those bands of ravagers, who, in its de fenseless condition, had made deep and destructive inroads. Finding his force inadequate to this pur pose, Lupus had recourse to negociation, and by a great sum of money prevailed on the northerns to release a few captives, and to retire within their own limits. Such a mode of acting served to invite fressi invasions ; and these were so alarmingly re peated, that the emperor at length determined to lead an army in person against the enemy. Among the motives of Severus for taking per- Expedition 0 \"of Severus, sonally the command in so distant an expedition was 208-211. the desire of withdrawing his two sons from the enervating luxury of Rome. Passing the two' great Roman ramparts, he penetrated, in the course of two campaigns, to the northern extremity of the iland without a battle. Utterly unable to cope with a force of such magnitude, the Caledonians con- fined"], [62, "38 HISTORY OF THE Chap, il fined their operations to a system of harassing and v \"* desultory warfare, incessantly hovering on the flanks and rear, and- laying ambuscades for detached par- ties. Great were the hardssiips, and slow the pro- gress of the Roman troops, from the nature of the ground, inclement seasons, and mode of warfare, obliged, as they advanced, to drain impassible bogs, to form causeways in tracts otherwise impracticable, to erect bridges over deep and rapid streams, to climb rugged mountains, and to cut their way through forests. At length reduced to extremity by the in- flexible perscverence of a prince, whom, at the age of sixty-three, and afflicted with a gout, no distresses could deter from the steady pursuit of his object, the Caledonians made submissions, and, on the fur rendry of their arms, and a large portion of their territory, obtained a peace in the year 209. The loss to Severus of men in this expedition, which was doubtless very great from fatigue and sickness, has been stated by Dio, an inaccurate historian, at fifty thousand. From operations attended with such toil and destruction no lasting benefit arose. The Cale donians, who had privately reserved the greater part of their arms, resumed their independence, and re commenced hostilities, when the emperor's troops were withdrawn to the south. Measures to secure the fruits of his success appear to have been neglect ed. Exasperated, he gave command, that the le gions, appointed for a new expedition, ssiould, in stead of subduing, exterminate these northerns. The design was prevented by the death of Severus, which happened in York in the February of 211. After"], [63, "30 Chap II Usurpation of C_r_u sius. 287-296 BRITISH ILANDS.

This man, who was of the Menapian race, and of mean extraction, had risen to eminence by nautical ssiill and military prowess. To his con duct was entrusted a formidable fleet, stationed at Gessoriacum, the modern Boulogne, in the reign of the associated emperors Diocletian and Maximian, to protect the coasts of the Roman provinces against the piratic squadrons of the Franks, a people of Ger many. \" His integrity,\" fays Gibbon, \" corresponded not with his abilities. When the German pirates sailed from their own harbours, he connived at their passage, but he diligently intercepted their return, and appropriated to his own use an ample ssiare of the spoil which they had acquired. The wealth of Carausius was, on this occasion, very justly consi dered as an evidence of his guilt ; and Maximian had already given orders for his death. But the crafty Menapian foresaw and prevented the severity of the emperor. By his liberality he had attached to his fortunes the fleet which he commanded, and secured the Barbarians in his interest. From the port of Boulogne he sailed to Britain, persuaded the legion and the auxiliars, which guarded that iland, to embrace his party ; and, boldly assuming, with the imperial purple, the title of Augustus, de fied the justice and the arms of his injured sove reign. Carausius still preserved the possession of Bou logne and the adjacent country. His fleets rode triumphant"], [64, "HISTORY OF THE 40 Chap.

Under his command Britain, destined in a future age to obtain the em pire of the sea, already assumed its natural and re spectable station of a maritime power.\" Not resting, however, on a solid foundation, the cordial attach ment and strength of the natives, but on the extra neous aid of revolted troops and German pirates, this power was unstable and of ssiort duration. Not furnissied with efficient force to reduce this daring usurper, the associated princes, after two years of naval hostility, temporized with him by a treaty of peace ; but at length his downfall was de termined, and the execution committed to Constan tius Chlorus, the adopted son of Maximian. Hav ing captured Boulogne, with a part of the hostile fleet in the harbour, Constantius spent three years in preparations for a descent on Britain. His suc cess was facilitated by the death of Carausius, mur dered by his prime minister Allectus, who, imitat ing his master's treason, usurped, with inferior abili ties, his dangerous post. A great armament under the command of Aselepiodatus, launching from the Seine, escaped in a fog the fleet of Allectus, sta tioned near the ile of Wight, came safely to land in the western parts of Britain, and convinced its inha bitants, fays Gibbon, \" that a superiority of naval strength will not always protect their country from a foreign invasion.\" Aselepiodatus, burning his ships, as if determined on death or victory, advanced im- mediately"], [65, "BRITISH ILANDS. 41 mediately against Allectus. The latter who had Chap. IL taken post near London to oppose the army at Bou- * -* logne ready to embark under the personal orders of Constantius, hasted westward, on the news of inva sion on that side, with such precipitation, that with few and harassed troops he met the enemy, and fell in a defeat. Constantius, landing in Kent with his forces, found Britain recovered by a single victory, after a separation of ten years from the Roman em pire, seven under Carausius, and three under Al- lectus. In 296, the year of Britain's recovery, we find PJcts.Scot*, the earliest mention of the Picts, in the panegyrics cots. of Eumenius, in an oration pronounced on the vic- tory of Constantius. The Picts are shewn by Pin- kerton to have been the same with the Caledonians. The latter name is supposed to have come from Kelydhon, a Cumraig term signifying woodlands. When the Romans, who seem to have at first learned this appellation from the Cumraig Britons, at length became acquainted with the national name of Pihtar or Piks, by which this people distinguissied them- selves, they latinized it into Picti, an ambiguous term, as it signified also painted. The latter signifi- cation had no place, however, here, as the staining of the ssiin was not more a custom with the Picts than with the Belgic Britons. That the country to the borders of the present England had been seized by the Picts appears probable, since, beside other circumstances, we find no mention of the M\u00e6at\u00e6 after the peace of Caracalla in 211. The denomi- nation"], [66, "HISTORY OF THE 42 Chap. II nation Britons, under which were at first compre hended all the natives of this great iland, was in course of time exclusively appropriated to the pro vincials under the Roman government, in contra distinction to the Picts and other enemies, who made predatory incursions on the Roman province. The first notice of the Scoti or Scots occurs in the year 360, in the history given by Ammianus Marcel linus. The terms Scoti and Scyiha appear to be only different modifications of one original word signifying Scyths or Scythians, the former latinized immediately from the Gothic, the latter mediately from the Greek. The Scots of the Roman writers were pre datory troops from Ireland, who crossed the channel to North-Britain in their wicker boats to associate with the Picts in their incursions into the Roman province. By Ammianus are also mentioned the Attacotti, as making hostile inroads on the province in 364. The signification of this name is supposed to be Hither-Scots, Irish who had fixed their abode in North-Britain. These are shewn by Pinkerton to have been the Dalriads or Dalreudini, who had settled in Argyle and the neighbouring territories about the year 258. A division of the Picts is also noticed into Dicaledon\u00e6 and Vecturiones, the for mer dwelling on the northern, the latter on the southern side of the Grampian chain.

Of transactions in Britain we have no infor mation from the departure of Constantine till the year 342, when the emperor Constans, his son, vi sited this iland to chastise the northern invaders of the province. Of the occurrences which had place in this expedition we are ignorant, as the sirst part is lost of the valuable history written by Ammianus, in which these, with other matters of importance were recorded.

That South-Britain had at this time attained a considerably improved state of agri culture appears from the quantities of corn drawn hence by Julian, surnamed the apostate, who direct ed the affairs of Roman government in the west. Six hundred large barks, employed in this business, made several voyages for the supply of the towns and garrisons on the Rhine.

While the Saxons from their fleets ravaged the coasts, the Picts, Attacots, and Scots poured into the interior parts with terrible devastation. Two Roman gene rals were slain ; and though two others were sent in succession with troops, the province still continued exposed to depredation, till a more efficient force under a general of prime abilities, arrived from the continent in 367. When Theodosius, the new governor, landed in Kent, the enemy had penetrated so far as London, and had collected prodigious booty, with a multi tude of captives. Having obliged them to fly and leave all behind by the vigour and ssiill of his ope rations, he distributed among the soldiers a small part of the spoil, and restored the rest to the rightful owners. Relieving London from impending ruin, recalling deserters to their standards by an act of amnesty, and restoring the long neglected discipline of the troops, he pursued the barbarians to the north ; and, in two campaigns, in which, from the nature of the war, scattered and desultory, no op portunity occurred of a great engagement, he drove them beyond the friths to the extreme parts of the iland. Making the long neglected rampart of An toninus the boundary of the empire on that side, he formed the country between the walls, the south of Scotland from the friths of Clyde and Forth, into a province named Valentia from the emperor Valens, who was then reigning jointly with Valentinian.

Their historians inform us that their government; was at first a limit ed monarchy. Of this we have no reason to enter tain a doubt ; but, when their history becomes au thentic, we find it a commonwealth, in which aris tocracy and democracy were blended. Their mili tary institutions, and their system of politics, deep and refined, were calculated beyond those of any other people for the extension of power and territory. When in a long course of time they had become masters of all Italy, except the region next the Alps, called Gallia Cisalpina, they commenced a war with the mighty state of Carthage by an invasion of Si cily, two hundred and sixty-three years before the christian \u00e6ra. Carthage, a Ph\u0153nician colony, seat ed near the place of the modern Tunis, had, by nautical adventure and commercial wealth, risen into a state of primary magnitude, possessed of extensive and fertile territories on the African continent, and a formidable navy which commanded the Mediterra nean. Where men merely mercantile have prepon derant influence, the councils of a state are ill di rected. Carthage was a republic, whose form of government bore a general resemblance to that of Rome, but actuated by a different spirit, distracted by the factions of an unbalanced democracy, and resting its power on forces extrinsic and precarious, armed navies, and mercenary troops enlisted from foreign nations.

When, by the ruin of Carthage, the Romans were freed from all apprehensions of danger from a rival state, a most alarming corruption of manners, as if for a speedy punissiment of public injustice, contaminated all ranks, and rendered Rome a sink of avarice, luxury, and every species of pollution. Notwithstanding such degeneracy, their conquests still continued, as no state remained in the west able to oppose their arms, and as those which still sub- sisted were always ready to furnissi, through servile fear, auxiliar forces for the crussiing of any people against whom the Roman arms were directed. The miseries, brought on foreign nations by the Romans, recoiled on themselves. No genuine freedom, no stability of government remained. All power cen- tered in a few ; and whatever chief, or combination of chiefs, could hire the most formidable mobs, or obtain a command of the greatest military force, was for a time the real sovereign of the commonwealth. The flames of intestine war frequently raged with desolating fury. The inhabitants of whole cities were massacred at once, and Rome oft beheld her streets bestrewed with the carcases of her own citi zens.

Civil wars were renewed with enormous bloodssied, and massacres extensive and atrocious, un til Octavius, afterwards styled C\u00e6sar Augustus, the nephew and adopted son of the great Julius, became uncontrolled lord of the Roman dominions, twenty eight years before the Christian \u00e6ra. From that period the Roman government conti- nued a despotic monarchy, and to Augustus succeed- ed a most infamous race of tyrants. Some emperors afterwards of superior talents from time to time ap- peared, who by great exertions deferred to a more distant day the inevitable ruin, which from general depravity awaited the empire. The benefits of such reigns were not more than temporary. Mental debasement, becoming greater and more extensive, enervated the troops, whose insolence rose as their vigour declined. Deposing and creating emperors at pleasure, they once even proceeded to set for- mally the throne to public auction. Extending from the Danube and Clyde to mount Atlas, and from the Euphrates to the Atlantic ocean, the Roman empire presented a frontier of prodigious length to the hostilities of warlike nations, not otherwise de- fensible than by numerous and effective armies. In its decline, which commenced toward the close of the second century after the birth of Christ, it was repeatedly invaded, and several parts of it ravaged, by various tribes of the Gothic race, who inhabited vast countries to the north of the Danube.

After the death of the emperor Theodosius in 395, a son of the great general who had repelled the Picts, the empire was ssiaken to its center by the Goths. Rome itself was thrice besieged, was ransomed, and, at length in 410, taken and plundered. France and other countries in the west were forever dismem bered from the Roman dominion ; and even Italy, which had been the seat of empire, became at first in fact, and afterwards also in name, a Gothic king dom.

Meanwhile in these contests Britain was aban- doned by the troops, and forever dismembered from the Roman empire about the year 409. Destitute of protection, and invaded by predatory troops of Sax- ons, Picts, and Scots, the South-Britons resumed the martial spirit of their ancestors which had been so long suppressed under a foreign yoke, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the discovery of their own strength. But, as the whole fabric of their civil and military government was dissolved, no regular or effective plan of defense was establissied, and the weakness of their disunion invited reiterated incur- sions of their foes.

Between the friths of Clyde and Forth, where Antoninus and Theodosius erected their barriers, are found the ruins of a pretenture, called in mo dern language Graham's dyke, which appears to have been a rampart of earth, with a foundation of stone twelve feet thick, thirty-seven Englisti miles in length, strengthened by eighteen square castles, and haying on its southern side a military way, and on its northern a ditch forty feet wide and thirteen deep.

It was a wall of stone and lime, sixty-eight miles in length, twelve feet high exclusively of the parapet, and eight feet thick, strengthened with eighty-one square castles at nearly equal intervals, mostly sixty-six feet broad each, and with eighteen greater fortresses or stations disposed in like manner, having a great ditch on the northern side, and military ways all along from station to sta tion. This vast piece of masonry, commonly called now the Picts' wall, is so thoroughly ruined that its vestiges"], [77, "BRITISH ILANDS. 53 Vestiges are not easily found, though in the eigh- Chap. teenth century several parts were standing from the height of two to nine feet. Among the numerous other monuments of Ro man antiquity in this iland are the vestiges of their encampments, and their military roads. The latter were great causeways of extraordinary thickness and solidity, made for the convenient marching of the troops. These roads are in Britain in many places almost defaced, in others almost entire. The four principal bear the names of the Fosse, Ikening-street, Watling-street, and Herman-street. The position of the first is best ascertained, which is paved with flints, Roman bricks, and great flagstones. It runs north-westward from Seaton in Devonssiire, through Bath and Lincoln, to Saltfleet on the coast of Lin colnssiire, a length of near two hundred and forty Englissi miles. Many monuments are extant very different from Dubious the Roman, rude, apparently more ancient, but of menu. doubtful origin. Of this kind are circular ranges of upright stones, imagined by some to have been Celtic works for druidic rites, by others Gothic, for at once religious and civil purposes, public sacrifices and national assemblies. The most famous of these is the stupendous monument of Stonehenge, which stonehenge stands on the Wiltssiire downs, six miles northward of Salissiury, on the north-eastern slope of a gently ascending hill, near the summit, and in such a posi tion, that the whole pile is visible from every ap proach, and strikes the spectator at a distance with a most whimsical appearance. It consists of four ranges of"], [78, "HISTORY OF THE 54 Chap III Barrows, of upright stones ; the two outer concentric circles, the two inner concentric ovals. The most outward range, a hundred and eight feet in diameter, was, in its perfect slate, composed of thirty enormous stones, three feet thick, six broad, above twenty in height, and placed at the distance of four feet one from another. On the tops of these were placed thirty others, from seven to almost twelve feet in length each, serving as architraves or imposts to the uprights, and secured by tenons and mortices. Some stones of the outer oval are twenty-two feet high and seven broad. Those of the inner oval are like Egyp tian obelissis. The whole number in the entire pile is computed at a hundred and forty, of which only ninety-two were remaining in 1778. The whole is environed with a circular double bank and ditch near thirty feet broad, at the distance of thirty-five yards from the outer circle around. 1 have given a more particular account of this wonderful monu ment, in the third volume of Terraquea, from Stuke ley's Stonehenge and other authorities. Of Belgic erection are supposed also to have been many of the barrows, found in various parts of Bri tain, nicely formed mounds of earth, which have been heaped on the graves of distinguissied personages, and in which by digging are discovered sometimes urns with assies of the dead, sometimes stone coffins with bones, sometimes entire ssiesetons.

Near Abury in Wiltssiire, sixteen miles c\"*p northward of Stonehenge, stands perhaps the greatest \\^^^, barrow in Britain, called Silbury-hill, a hundred and seventy feet in perpendicular height, five hundred in diameter at bottom, and a hundred and five at top, where were found in 1723 a human ssieleton bedded in chalk, the bic of a horse's bridle, deer's horns, and an iron knife with a bone handle. The affairs of Britain, for a Ions: time after its state of \u00b0 Britain af dereliction by the Romans, are almost unknown, ter the Ro and, which i^ much worse, are fabulously represent- \"o\u2122^, ed. From an accurate and comprehensive examina- tion of all which could be collected on the subject, Gibbon has given us the following account, the only one consistent with truth or probability, in which, however, some secondary circumstances are founded only on analogy and conjecture. ** The indepen dent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the autho rity of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns. Zozimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accu rately observes that the letters of Honorius were addressed to the cities of Britain. Under the protec tion of the Romans ninety-two considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, thirty-three cities were distin guished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance. Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy ; and the powers of municipal government were dis- tributed"], [80, "HISTORY OF THE 56 Chap III tributed among the annual magistrates, a select se nate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the Roman constitution. The management of a common revenue, the exercises of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics ; and when they asserted their inde pendence, the youth of the city, and of the adja cent districts, would naturally arrange themselves under the standard cf the magistrates. But the de sire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens of political society, is a perpetual and in exhaustible source of discord ; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of British freedom was exempt from tumult and faction. The pre-emi nence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens ; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were be come the subjects of their own servants, would some times regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.\" \" The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators ; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the. \"proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the ssielter of these rising republics. The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousnese ; but the hereditary lords of am ple possessions, who were not oppressed by the neigh bourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war. The gardens and villas, which"], [81, "BRITISH ILANDS. 57 Chai- HI which exhibited some faint imitation os Italian ele gance, would soon be converted into strong castles, , the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent coun try. The produce of the land was applied to pur chase arms and horses ; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers ; and the chieftain might assume, within his own do main, the powers of a civil magistrate. Several of these Britissi chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings ; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate their hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the C\u00e6sars. Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors. If the princes of Britain relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole iland must have been gradually divided by the distinction of two national parties; again broken into a thousand subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment. The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in ob scure and intestine quarrels ; and the personal merit, which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals, might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants who infested Britain after the dis solution of the Roman government.\" \" The Britissi church might be composed of thirty or forty bissiops, with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy ; and the want of riches (for they seem"], [82, "53 Chap III Christian religion established, HISTORY OF THE seem to have been poor) would compel them to de serve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour. The interest, as well as the temper of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country : those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses ; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a rational assembly. In such councils where the princes and magistrates fat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated ; differences recon ciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise regulations often concerted, and sometimes executed : and there is reason to believe that, in moments of ex treme danger, a Pendragon, or dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons. These pasto ral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition ; and the Britissi clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the Pelagian heresy, which they abhorred, as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.\" Whether druidism, the religion of the Celtic, had gained adrrission among the Belgic Britons, or what were the particular pagan rites of the latter, we are not informed. Probably they were such as we find to have prevailed in other nations of the Gothic race, who worssiipped among other deities, the God of war, and occasionally immolated human victims. When or by whom was the Gospel first preached in Britain we are equally ignorant. Probably here, as elsewhere, its gradual propagation silently accom- panied"], [83, "BRITISH ILANDS. 59 Chap, III Roman di vision of Britain. panied the extension of the Roman government. It had been embraced by great numbers previously to the beginning of the fourth century, when, under the protection of Constantine the great, Christianity acquired a firm establissiment. In a council of thirty three bissiops, held at Aries in France in 314, three Britissi are recorded. The profession of Christian faith became universal in South-Britain, after the edict of Theodosius, toward the conclusion of the fourth century, by which all pagan worssiip was for bidden. The early church was agitated by furious disputes on metaphysical questions, particularly those of the Arian and Pelagian heresies. With the lat ter, as Pelagius was a native of Britain, the clergy of this iland were more immediately concerned. Of the general spirit of his doctrines we may form some conception from a principal tenet, \" that the sin of Adam affected not his posterity, and that children at their birth are as pure and innocent as Adam him self was before his transgression.\" Whether the arrangements of ecclesiastical go vernment in South Britain were regulated by the political division, made of the country by the Ro mans, is not known. The Roman territories in this iland formed for a century and a half on.y one province, afterwards two, and finally five. Britannia prima extended from the Britissi channel to the Thames and Severn.

By Ptolemy the geographer, who wrote in the second century, they are placed on the isthmus of the Cimbric peninsula, in the modern Sleswig, perhaps Holstein. They are mentioned by Ammi- anus as infesting, in 364, by their piracy, the pro- vincial Britons. They also infested France ; and in both countries were appointed by the Roman go- vernment officers styled counts of the Saxon shore, to whom was peculiarly consigned the office of defen- sive arrangements against predatory fleets. \" If the fact,\" fays Gibbon, \" were not established by the most unquestionable evidence, we should appear to abuse the credulity of our readers by the description of the veflels in which the Saxon pirates ventured to sport in the waves of the German ocean, the Bri- tiih channel, and the bay of Biscay. The keel of their large flat-bottomed boats was framed of light timber, but the sides and upper works consisted only of wicker, with a covering of strong hides. The daring spirit of the pirates braved the perils both of the"], [85, "BRITISH ILANDS. 61 Chap III the sea and of the ssiore. Their skill was confirmed by the habits of enterprise ; and they rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest, which concealed their design, and dispersed the fleets of the enemy. The Saxon boats drew so little water that they could easily proceed fourscore or a hundred miles up the great rivers : their weight was so inconsiderable that they were transported on waggons from one river to another ; and the pirates, who had entered the mouth of the Seine, or of the P.hine, might descend, with the rapid stream of the Rhone, into the Mediterra nean.\" How a people, to whom is assigned so small a territory, ssiould furnissi great armaments, and, some centuries afterwards, numerous armies on the conti nent, may be best understood from the fame great historian. \" The solution of this difficulty is easily derived from the similar manners, and loose consti tution, of the tribes of Germany, which were blend ed with each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendssiip. The situation of the native Saxons disposed them to embrace the hazardous professions of fissiermen and pirates : and the success of their first adventures would naturally excite the emulation of their bravest countrymen, who were impatient of the gloomy solitude of their woods and mountains. Every tide might float down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes, filled with hardy and intrepid associates, who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect of the ocean, and to taste the wealth and luxury of un known worlds. It ssiould seem probable, however, that the most numerous auxiliars of the Saxons were furnissied"], [86, "62 HISTORY OF THE Chap, III V__TV-> furnissied by the nations who dwelt along the ssiores of the Baltic. They possessed arms and ships, the art of navigation, and the habits of naval war ; but the difficulty of issuing through the northern columns of Hercules, which, during several months of the year, are obstructed with ice, confined their ssiill and courage within the limits cf a spacious lake. The rumour of the successful armaments, which sailed from the mouth of the Elbe, would soon provoke them to cross the narrow isthmus of Sleswig, and to launch their vessels on the great sea. The various troops of pirates and adventurers, who fought under the seme standard, were insensibly united in a perma nent society, at first of rapine, and afterwards of government. A military confederation was gradu ally molded into a national body by the gentle opera tion of marriage and consanguinity ; and the adjacent tribes, who solicited the alliance, accepted the name and laws of the Saxons.\" Their government appears to have been an irregular \" democracy, tempered and controlled by the occasional ascendant of birth or valour, of eloquence or superstition,\" such as we find to have been generally prevalent among the ancient Goths from the inestimable treatise of Taci tus on the manners of the Germans, and from what may be regarded as an admirable comment on this, a treatise on the same subject in the ninth chapter of Gibbon.

Concerning"], [87, "G$ Chap, III V_-\"V~\\_/ Saxon Invasion 449-455 BRITISH ILANDS. Concerning the conquests and settlements of the Saxons in Britain much fable is recorded since the ages of monkissi fiction, unwarily adopted by some late historians, but justly rejected by all those who have investigated the subject with proper attention. The declamatory and jejune work of Gildas, a work of the sixth century, on the destruction of Britain, betrays the grossest ignorance. That of Nennius in the ninth, his history of the Britons, is originally fabulous, and interpolated with fictitious matter by Samuel. Wittichind in the tenth, a Saxon monk of Germany, forged a circumstantial account of an embassy, said to have been sent by the South-Britons to the Saxons, imploring on the most abject condi tions their aid against the Picts and Scots. As my design is to give my readers all the authentic infor mation which may be worthy of their regard, con densed into as narrow a space as perspicuity will per mit, I shall take little notice of such fables. The historical matter, meager and dim, of this dark pe riod, is chiefly found in the chronicle and ecclesiasti cal history of Beda, who wrote about the year 730, and in the Saxon chronicle, which was written origi nally in the Belgic dialect of the Gothic, and seems to have been begun in Northumberland in the ele venth century, and to have been continued by differ ent hands to the twelfth. In the confused and distracted state of Britissi affairs, when disunion and internal discord prevented the adoption of effectual measures against the re peated incursions of predatory foes, Vortigern, a prince"], [88, "0. Chap Hi HISTORY OF THE prince who had gained an ascendancy among the Southern Britons, is said to have suggested the ad- vice of entering into an alliance with the Saxons, or the employing of them as auxiliars against the Picts and Scots. For a counsel followed by disastrous events Vortigern has been severely censured : but the misfortunes of the South-Britons were the con- sequences of their own distractions ; and, when they were assailed by different enemies, this prince, as is well observed by Gibbon, could only balance the various perils to which they were exposed. His policy may therefore \" deserve either praise or ex- cuse, if he preferred the alliance of those barbarians, whose naval power rendered them the most danger- ous enemies, and the most serviceable allies.\" Two brothers, named Hengist and Horse, who seem to have been expelled from their country by a hostile faction, and were piratically ranging along the eastern coast of Britain with three great vessels, ac- cepted the offers of the Britissi prince, and, collecting as many as they could of their compatriots, marched with their followers in conjunction with his troops- The northern invaders, who had advanced as far as Stamford inLincolnssiire, were defeated and expelled with the assistance of these auxiliars, to whom was assigned, as their place of headquarters, the fertile tract of Thanet, an iland seven miles long and four broad, parted from the main land of Kent by the divided stream of the river Stour. The success of these two chiefs drew after them numbers of their adventurous countrymen, of whom five thousand are said to have arrived a' once to join their standard. At"], [89, "BRITISH ILANDS. 65 At the head of encreasing bands of fierce and de- Chap. termined adventurers, the two brothers chose rather I1L to acquire a permanent possession of territory and dominion, than to remain in the precarious pay of a divided people. To facilitate the execution of their design, by distracting the attention and dividing the forces of the South-Britons, while themselves made the attack on the south-eastern quarter, they formed a league with the Picts, and engaged them to renew their inroads from the north. To so miserable a state were a people reduced, who, by native efforts and a timely union, might have defied the attempts of every enemy. In arms and valour the South- Britons were far from deficient ; and, roused by their extreme danger, they made desperate opposition, but still without complete concert, and consequently without complete success. Of the many battles, which were fought with various fortune, in one at Ailessord in 453 Horse was slain. In another, two years after, at Crayford, Hengist, the surviving chief of the new colony, was so decisively victorious, that, regarding his power as establissied fully in the south-eastern angle of Britain, he assumed the title of king in 455. Thus in six years, from the arrival of Hengist in 449, was founded the kingdom of Kent, the first of that system which was called the Saxon Heptarchy.

Thus we find in the thirty-sixth chapter of Gibbon that Riothamus, one of the Britissi princes, led an army of twelve thousand men to France to the assistance of the Ro man emperor Anthemius against the Visigoths. But the country ceased not to be infested by hostile ar maments ; and, before the death of Hengist, which is said to have happened in 488, a new colony was established. A Saxon army, under a chief named Aella, landing in the south in 477, founded the kingdom of South-Saxons or Sussex. In 495 ar rived another armament under Cerdie, who met such opposition, that his power seems not fixed till 519, when he styled himself king of Wessex, or West- Saxons, whose territory included Hamssiire, and ex tended westward. In proportion as the invaders advanced farther to the west, they appeared to have encountered a more formidable resistance, probably from an increase of union and energy among the na tives, roused by the augmented magnitude of dan ger. The most successful commander of the Britons was Aurelius Ambrosius, of a noble Roman family, who retarded the progress of the enemy by many victories He flourissied about the years 480 and 490, but how much longer is not certainly known. He is supposed, but merely by unsupported conjec ture, to have been the same with Natanleod, who fell in battle, with five thousand of his followers, by the West-Saxons in 508. On much more pro bable grounds he is believed by some to have been the fame with prince Arthur, the renowned hero of Welch"], [91, "BRITISH ILANDS. 67 Welch romance. The name of Arthur, which is Chap. not found in Gildas, Beda, or the genuine writings under the name of Nennius, appears to have been a fiction of later times. Perhaps among the causes of a fiercer opposition in the west than elsewhere to the progress of the new colonists was the difference of language and manners in the contending parties; With the Sax ons, who were Belgian Goths, the Belgic Britons might more easily coalesce than the Cumraig Celts, a race radically distinct, and totally dissimilar. Dis comfited in a great battle at mount Badon near Bath in 520, the West-Saxons were stopped in their pro gress on that side for many years ; but, receiving re inforcements from the continent, they gained a vic tory at Cerdicssord in 527, and conquered the ile of Wight in 530.

Its coasts on the south and west are bold and precipitous, particularly the latter, where the cliffs have a sublime and terrific appearance, many of them overhanging the sea in the height of nearly seven hundred feet.

The iland is well watered, and is divided longitudinally by a ridge of hills, which run from east to west, and af ford excellent pasturage for ssieep. Its length is hardly twenty-three Englissi miles, its breadth twelve, and its area at least eighty thousand acres. Its soil is so prolific, that its produce in one good year is reputed sufficient for the support of its inhabitants during seven. While the colonists of Weslex contended for do minion in the south, armaments arrived on the east ern coasts at several times, under various leaders, of whcise names and actions very few are recorded. The predominant people in these expeditions, whose name also predominated afterwards in South-Britain, were the Angles. Among the nations of ancient Germany, in the neighbourhood of the Baltic, the Angli are noticed by Tacitus ; and a district between Flensourg and Sleswig, in the Cimbric peninsula, the modern Denmark, still bears the appellation of Anglen. In 547 an army of Angles debarked at Flamborough head in the present Yorkssiire, under the conduct of Ida, who in a ssiort time assumed the title of king, and founded in that part the kingdom of Bernicia, which extended over the south-eastern Picts, either by conquest or voluntary submission, so far northward as the frith of Forth. With this was united, in the reign of Ethelfrid, grandson of Ida, the kingdom of Deira, situate northward of the Humber, found ed by a leader named Aella in 559. Bernicia, thus augmented, received the name of Northumbria, long preponderant"], [93, "ERITISH ILANDS. 6'J preponderant in power among the states of Britain. Chap. By other adventurers, of whose transactions we are ignorant, were three other kingdoms formed in the eastern and middle parts. That of the East-Angles, whose first king, Uffa, commenced his reign in 575, comprehended Norfolk and the neighbouring parts. That of the East-Saxons, or Essex, extended over the modern county of that name and some territories westward. That of iViercia, founded by Creda about the year 582, occupied the central parts of the coun try eastward of the Severn. Thus was at length completed the Saxon Heptarchy, or system of seven small kingdoms in South-Britain, Wessex, Sussex, Kent, Essex, Mercia, East-Angles, and Northum- bria or Northumberland. Above a hundred and thirty years had elapsed from state of the arrival of Hengist to the establissiment of the Britain. Heptarchy. As the disunion and discord of the natives had permitted the settlement of the hostile colonists, so the fame causes, operating among the latter, had retarded their progress. The Belgic Bri tons appear to have coalesced with their conquerors; the Cumraig to have partly retained their possessions in the west, partly to have emigrated to France, where, in lower Bretagne, are found at this day a people resembling the Welch in persons and lan guage. The assumption at this time of the name Bretagne, the fame with Britain in the French lan guage, by a province on the continent, made the distinctive epithet of Great necessary for the iland. The Cumraig Celts, called Britons exclusively by early writers, sometimes Wal/i or Welch, continued to"], [94, "\"0 Chap III History of the Heptar chy. 582-827 HISTORY OF THE to hoid all the western coasts of South-Britain, from , the British channel to the frith of Soiway, divided under a number of discordant chiefs, but nominally forming the four principal communities or little king- doms of Cornwall, South-Wales, North- Wales, and Cumbria, in each of which presided a lord paramount or prince with precarious authoricy. The last of these Welch kingdoms comprehended Cumberland and Westmoreland with a small part of Lancassiire. Thus we find in South-Britain at once eleven petty kingdoms, seven of the Saxon, rather Anglo-Saxon, four of the Welch denomination. Hereditary suc- cession in the masculine series, in the line of primo. geniture, was the rule in all, but a rule often violat- ed from the general turbulence of affairs. The mo- narchal power was narrowly, but irregularly, limit- ed ; in the states of the Heptarchy by the nobles and wittenagemots or assemblies of the principal sub- jects ; in the Welch principalities by the nobles and their followers in a manner still more tumultuary. The manners of all were barbarous. Of the people a great part were slaves, a chief article of commerce, as the Negroes of the present time. To this wretch- ed state, had doubtless a great proportion of the Belgic Britons been by conquest reduced, and others by the various chances of wars, crimes, and debts, the last not unfrequently contracted by gaming. The records of Britissi transactions in the obscure period of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy are so per plexed and barren, that the great Milton has pro nounced the affairs of that system not more worthy of a particular narrative than the ssiirmissies of kites or"], [95, ".1 CtfAP III BRITISH ILANDS. or crows. The petty kingdoms were convulsed by internal diffentions, and frequently engaged in wars one against another. Alliances were formed for the prevention or achieving of conquests ; and the pre ponderance of power fluctuated chiefly between Nor thurnbria, Weffex, and Mercia. The attention of the Anglo-Saxons was thus diverted fiom the Welch principalities, whose weakness, from disunion and internal disorder, exposed them to invasion ; yet were the latter occasionally attacked, and their terri torial possessions more narrowly abridged. Thus in 613, as Beda informs us, in a war made on the Welch by Ethelfred, king of Northumbria, Broc mail the prince of Powis, or Mid-Wales, was de seated near Chester, that town with the adjacent country conquered, and the great monastery of Ban gor, containing two thousand one hundred monks, demolissied. Twelve hundred and fifty of these monks, who had attended in a body the Welch troops to the field to pray for their success, were made the first object of attack by the Northumbrian monarch, and twelve hundred of them slain The most ferocious and restless warrior of those times was Penda, king of Mercia, whose reign commenced in 626. Among the many deeds of this monarch was his alliance with Cadwallon, the most powerful of the Welch princes, for an invasion of Northum bria, whose king, Edwin, he defeated and flew, in a battle near Hatfield, in 6^. Cadwallon, again invading this kingdom, and killing two princes who had assumed its divided government, was himself discomfited and slain at Benfield in Northumberland, in"], [96, "HISTORY OF THE 72 Chap HI Introduc tion of Christian :ty 596-664, in 635, by Oswald, one of the royal family, who restored the Northumbrian kingdom to its former consequence. But in a war against Penda, Oswald fell in a defeat of his army in 642, at a place called Maserfilth ; and though Penda was afterwards obliged to retreat, Northumbria became again divided into two kingdoms. At length, in 655, this furious disturber lost his life in a battle at the river Broad- Arc in Yorkssiire, defeated by Oswi, who renovated the Northumbrian power, and reduced even Mercia for some time to a state of dependence. About this time the christian religion had been embraced by a great part of the Anglo-Saxons. Its introduction had been facilitated by the marriage of Ethelbert, king of Kent, in 570, with a daugh ter of Cherebert king of France, named Bertha, who, being a christian, was indulged in the exer cise of her religion in a small church outside the walls of Canterbury. Missioners, under the con duct of a monk named Austin or Augustin, were sent by Saint Gregory the pope in 596, who were permitted to reside in Canterbury, and to preach their doctrines without restriction. As they were directed to assimilate the ceremonies of christian worssiip as nearly as possible to those of the hea then, and to use as churches the heathen temples to which the people had been accustomed, their mission was so successful, that the king and most of his sub jects were in a ssiort time converted. The latter, after the death of Ethelbert, and the succession of his son Eadbald, in 616, apostatized to their former pagan rites ; but again, on their new king's con- version,"], [97, "IS Chap III BRITISH ILANDS. version, returned to the profession of Christianity. After the defeat and death of Edwin- by Penda in 633, the Northumbrians and East-Angles, among whom the Gospel had been propagated with appa rent success, apostatized in like manner ; but they were, on the accession of king Oswald, reconverted by missioners from Scotland. Aidan, the principal of these, was constituted bistiop of Lindisfarn, an iland two miles distant from the coast of Northum berland, two miles and a quarter long, and a mile and a half broad, in the southern part of which are still remaining the ruins of a monastery. The people of Kent and Weffex, instructed in re ligion by Roman teachers, differed in some practices, particularly the time of celebrating Easter, from those of the Northumbrian and Mercian territories, whose churches had been instituted by preachers from Scotland. By the former was the above men tioned festival observed on the first sunday after the fourteenth and before the twenty-second day of the first moon after the vernal equinox ; by the latter on the first sunday after the thirteenth and before the twenty-first day of the same. To accomodate the difference a council was held at Whitby in 664, summoned by Oswi, the Northumbrian monarch. When, in the debate, Saint Peter was by one of the parties asserted, and by the other acknowledged, to be door-keeper of Heaven, and to have enjoined the celebration of Easter in the Roman manner, Ofwi declared his resolution of obedience to the pre cepts of a person vested with such an office, who might, if offended, refuse him admittance into the mansion"], [98, "74 HISTORY OF THE Ckap. mansion of the blessed. This argument, demonstra- tive of the gross ignorance then reigning, prevailed in the council, and gave the advocates of the Ro- man ritual a complete victory. Posterior Among the many corruptions of Christianity was transacti- \u00b0 ' r J ons. a doctrine which prevailed from the latter part of 664-800. the seventh century, that the assumption of the monkissi habit expunged all former sins. Hencer numbers retired into monasteries, where, even several kings of the Heptarchy ended their days. About the. fame time the four smaller kingdoms sell into a state of permanent weakness, and remained in a fluctating dependence on those of Northumbria, Weffex, and Mercia. By the defeat and death of Egfrid, the Northumbrian monarch, in 685, by the Picts, his kingdom, hitherto the greatest of the Heptarchy, was reduced within much narrower limits ; as the victors made a permanent conquest of all the eastern parts from the frith of Forth to the Tweed. On an- other side Weffex was augmented by the talents of Ina, its king, who overthrew the Welch, and about the year 698 reduced to subjection Somersetssiire and Cornwall. The attention of Ina was drawn to another quarter by the hostile attempts of Ceolred, king of Mercia, who contended for pre-eminence. This war was terminated by a battle in 715, at a place called Wodnesoeorth, in which neither of the parties was victorious, and both were debilitated. A surprising tranquility, a universal calm, took place throughout Britain in sometime after, and still con- tinued in 731, where the valuable history of Beda fc-oncludes. As the attention of this writer was ab- sorbed"], [99, "~.$ Chap III BRITISH ILANDS. sotbed by affairs of the church, the information which he has incidentally given of a political nature is very small, but correct and perfectly authentic, such as we cannot collect from other historians of those times. To the extraordinary calm described by Beda, ap parently caused by the weakness of the Northumbrian kingdom, the indolence of the Mercian monarch, and the religious turn of Ina, who at length retired to a monastery, convulsions succeeded like those which had existed before. A conspicuous part in these was acted by Offa, king of Mercia, who, lead ing a successful insurrection against his predecessor, ascended the throne in 755, and soon threatened with subjection the other states of the Heptarchy. He seized part of Northumbria, conquered Kent, re duced Weffex within narrower limits, and, in con junction with the forces of the last, dispossessed the Welch of some considerable territories. To this monarch is ascribed, for the security of his acquisi tions on the side of Wales, the formation of a vast rampart, called Offa's Dyke, which consisting of a high bank between two trenches, here and there strengthened by small artificial mounts, is traced above eighty miles, from the river Wye near the Se vern sea, along the counties of Hereford and Rad nor, and through that of Montgomery, to the Clwy dian hills beyond the source of the river Dee. Offa depended not on military conduct alone for the en largement of his kingdom. He invited to his court Ethelred, king of the East-Angles, to whom he had promised his daughter Althrida in marriage ; mur- dered"], [100, "6 Chap, HI Tetnitn; tion ds the Heptarchy. SOQ-8 HISTORY OF THE dered him on his arrival ; and annexed his territo- ries to those of Mercia. He died in 792, having survived this deed only two years. To atone for this and other crimes he made such large donations to the church, that he was considered as absolved from his sins, as may be observed in the history of Eng land written in the twelfth century by William of Malmsbury, a clerical author, eminently esteemed for strict regard to truth. Such criminal acts and modes of expiation are not less illustrative of na tional barbarism than of Offa's character. Brihtric, king of Weffex, to secure himself by alliance, had married Eadburga, daughter of Offa. This princess, in administering poison to a nobleman whom ssie hated, accidentally poisoned her husoand also. On the throne thus vacated, in the year 800, Egbert, a prince of the genuine blood royal, was placed by the nobility. This prince had taken refuge in France from the jealousy of his predecessor, and had in the court and army of Charlemagne, the greatest monarch in Europe, acquired highly useful accom plissiments, which enabled him to attain the sove reignty of South-Britain. Having spent many years in establissiing the internal strength of his kingdom, and in reducing the Welch on the southern side of the Severn sea from the condition of tributaries to that of subjects, he was assailed in 823 by the whole force of Mercia, whose domestic distractions had long withheld the effective exertions of its power against its neighbours, but whose troops were now led by Bernulf who had usurped its government. At Wilton in Wiltshire the Mercians were defeated with"], [101, "BRITISH ILANDS. 77 Chap. Ill with so terrible a slaughter, that the river Willey was said to have been reddened with their blood and choaked with their carcases. Kent and Essex almost immediately submitted to a detachment of Egbert's troops, and the East-Angles revolting put themselves under his protection. In attempts to reconquer the last both Bernulf, and his successor, Ludecan, were slain ; and Wiglaf, the last king of Mercia, took refuge in a monastery from the arms of Egbert. When Mercia was conquered with all its dependen cies, the king of Weffex advanced into Northum bria, whose chief nobility, sensible of the total in utility of resistance, received him at Dore in York ssiire as their sovereign. Thus, after a four years' warfare, by a vigorous and well-directed exertion of the previously consolidated strength of his little king dom, Egbert beheld himself in 827 undisputed mo narch of all which had composed the Heptarchy, of nearly the same territories of which consists the pre sent England. To render the change less violent and offensive, he replaced Wiglaf on the Mercian throne, under conditions of tribute and obedience ; and like wise indulged the Northumbrians and East-Angles in titular monarchs of their own election.

Of the corrupt name Hebrides, given them in later times, the cause is discovered by Pinkerton to have been a typographical error in an edition of Solinus, printed at Paris in 1503, whence the erroneous appellation was copied by Boethius, and from him by others. Their number is conceived to exceed three hundred, but, with the omission of those which are quite incon siderable, it may be reduced to between thirty and forty.

They are generally rough v-^-lw, with hills and rocks, and in some are seen high and craggy mountains, on which Atlantic storms burst with tremendous fury, chiefly in autumn, when the earth is deluged with torrents of rain. In some the ssiowers are incommodiously frequent during seven or eight months at least ; while in others, consisting of low land, over which the clouds are wafted un broken, less rain falls generally in summer than the inhabitants think requisite. The air in all is very temperate and moist. Snow seldom lies many hours in the low iles, and the cattle remain unhoused throughout the year. The winds, where the land is high, are unfavourable to husoandry ; but in some low parts the harvest is neither late nor precarious. The soil, not barren in general, is in some places highly prolific. Manures are in abundance, as lime stone, marl, and ssiellydand. The ssieep bear fleeces of extraordinary softness and elasticity, of a silky consistence. The precious down from the breast of the eider duck is found on the rocks ; and the sea teems with fissi, which might be made an object of gainful industry. The principal of the Hebudes are Arran, Ila, Jura, and a long chain of insular tracts denominated collectively the Long Iland. Arran, in length twenty-four, in its greatest breadth Arran fourteen miles, bears in a distant view an aspect of most savage sterility, consisting of high mountains, which run in transverse ridges, their sides sloping toward the sea, their summits appearing broken, ser rated, or spiring.

Jura is divided longitu- dinally by a chain of mountains, four of which, naked and distinct, appear conspicuous above the rest. Two of these, and another mountain, are named Paps from their exact mamillary form. That of the Paps, which is the second in magnitude, is found to have an elevation of eight hundred and fifty"], [105, "84 Chap IV Mull, Skie. BRITISH ILANDS. fifty yards : but this is far overtopped by the highest called Ben-an-oir, which is composed of huge naked stones piled one on another to a stupendous altitude. The rude eminences, which render the face of this iland so rugged in a distant view, occupy no great portion of its surface, which generally consists of naturally good, but as yet neglected land. Mull, parted from Argylessiire by a channel only two or three miles broad in some places, extends both in length and breadth near thirty miles ; but is so deeply pierced by two great inlets on the western side, beside some smaller, that scarcely any spot within its limits is distant four miles from fait wa ter. Its face is rugged, especially in the interior parts, with rocks and mountains, one of which, named Benmore, rises to great altitude. Its soil is in general neither favoured by nature, nor improved by hussiandry. The most improvable tracts lie in the south-west and north-east. Skie, severed from the main land by a channel less broad than a mile in its narrowest part, has a most irregular ssiape, indented by numerous insets, which, in some places, advancing from opposite sides, leave scarcely two miles breadth of land be- tween them. The country, more especially in the interior parts, abounds in bogs, rocks, and moun- tains. The last form two ranges of great height, between which are large tracts of level and improva- ble, but as yet unimproved, land.

Its harbours are so numerous that hardly any spot in its surface is five miles distant from the convenience of a port. Long Iland, situate westward of Skie, is in its most extensive signisica'ion a chain of ilands, ex tending from south to north a hundred and forty Englissi miles, including about sixteen miles of wa ter. The whole is supposed to have been formerly one continuous iland, and to have been broken by storms and earthquakes into many. Far the greatest of these, and that to which the title of Long iland particularly belongs at present, is Lewes,, consisting of two peninsulas, the northern of which is Lewes properly so called, the southern being denominated Harris. They both together extend about fifty miles in length, and in some places twenty in breadth. The next in magnitude are North-Uist, South-Uist, and Barra. The western coast of the whole chain is low, flat, and extremely fertile, consisting mostly of ssielly-send. Within these flats toward the east is a range of ssiallow fressi- water lakes, into which the sea flows at high spring tides. The eastern coast is mountainous and rocky. The grand chain of rocks on this side is broken into irregular chasms, in some of which the sea passes through to the west, separating the ilands by narrow channels. Through others it enters beyond the mountains into the in terior country, where it widens in such manner as to form capacious harbours. Iona, Stassa, and Hirta, though of diminutive size, are of high celebrity. Of the first I shall have elsewhere ssiortly occasion to speak. Staffa, situate to"], [107, "BRITISH ILANDS. 83 to the west of Mull, is an insular spot, only one Chap. mile long and half a mile broad, remarkable for con. yj^. fisting wholly of a stack of those basaltic pillars which abound in the neighbouring ilands. These pillars are here surprisingly magnificent, especially where they form a stupendous and beautiful cavern, called Fingall's cave, three hundred and seventy feet long and a hundred and seventeen feet high. Hirta, called also Saint-Kilda, the most western of the He- budes, three miles long and two broad, rises from the ocean steep and immensely high, with five dis- tinct and bare summits, the most elevated of which called Conagra, is accounted the Teneriff of the Britissi ilands, its elevation above the deep being eighteen hundred yards. Here from the brink of an immense precipice, against which mountainous bil- lows exert their force, may be contempleted, with full advantage, a boundless ocean in all its wildness of grandeur. The scene is diversified by flocks of sea fowl so prodigious, that the vast rocks in the ocean around this iland, covered by their multitudes, appear like mountains clad with snow, from the middle of Febru- ary to the middle of November ; but during the rest of the year not one of these birds is to be seen. To Pinkerton I refer the reader for proofs of the Hisli,'T \u00abf , ' the Picts. only probable history of these ilands, and of North- Britain, in early ages. The Hebudes appear to have been first inhabited by Cumraig Celts, and af terwards colonized, perhaps three centuries before the christian era, by the Gothic nation of Picts from the south of Norway. From their Hebudian sct dements these Gothic tribes invaded the main G 2 land"], [108, "84 HISTORY OF THE Chap IV land os North-Britain, and gradually colonized the regions to the north of the Tay and Lomond lakes, where they became known to the Romans, in the latter part of the first christian century, under the name of Caledonians, and in the fourth under their proper appellation -of Pihtar, latinized into Picti. Their government, at first an irregular democracy, became in the Hebudes, by a course of events na tural or usual in barbarous nations, an irregularly limited monarchy, probably about thirty years after our Saviour's birth. This monarchy was extended, by what means we know not, after a long lapse of time, over the Picts on the main land : perhaps by voluntary consent over the northern Picts, the Dicaledones of Pvoman writers, about the end of the third century, and thence by conquest over the southern, the Vecturiones, between the beginning and middle of the fifth. We find in 565 a king, styled Brudi the second, reigning over all the Picts, as in a monarchy sometime establissied. The scat of empire was then in the main land, into which the royal family had perhaps long before transplanted itself from the Hebudes. 'she succession in this monarchy was elective, but confined to the royal race, and regulated by descent in the female line. By strength, wisdom, and valour, would the choice of electors be attracted ; but when merits were equal, the son of a female of the royal generation was preferred to the son of a male ; a practice at this day prevalent in some barbarous nations ; as of the purity of blood less doubt can be entertained in the former than the latter case.

These appear to have been the Attacotti of Roman writers, first mentioned in the fourth century, probably called Atlacols or Hither- Scots by the Britons to distinguissi them from the Scots of Ireland. About the year 477 the Picts, who had made conquests in South-Britain, in conse quence of their league with the Jutes of Hengist, appear to have quarrelled with the Dalriads, perhaps from claims made by the latter to a part of these ac quisitions, and to have expelled them to Ireland. These colonists returned with reinforcements under Loam and Fergus in 503, and were permitted tore settle, as the attention of the Picts was engaged in the south. In 739 the Dalriads were conquered, and an end put to their monarchy, which had been elec tive, but confined to the royal race in the male line, by the Picts, led by their king, Ungust the first : but, under the protection of the Pictissi monarchs, they increased in numbers, probably by new emigra tions of Irissi, and extended their habitations from Argyle through all those territories which are posses sed at present by the Scottissi Highlanders, their pos terity.

By preachers un- known, but chiefly by Saint Ninian in 412, such ef- fects were produced that Christianity was established early in the fifth century among the southern Picts. The northern were mostly converted in the latter part of the sixth, together with their king Brudi the second, by Saint Columba, an Irissiman, to whom this monarch made a donation of the little Hebudian iland of lona, above two miles in length, less than one in breadth, parted from the south- western extremity of Mull by a sound hardly a mile in width. Here Columba founded a famous monas- tery, which furnissied North-Britain with churchmen, mostly Irissi, during some succeeding centuries. Many chapels were successively erected ; a library in which were deposited the archives of the Pictissi kingdom ; and sepulchres of ancient kings, North- Britissi, Irissi, and Norwegian, who chose this holy spot for their place of interment. lona bears also the names of Hui and Hy, but chiefly I-Coluim-kill, or the iie of Columba's church. As the Picts were instructed in Christianity by miffioners from Ireland, Where the Pope's authority was unknown, they dif- fered, like the Welch, from the professors of the Romissi faith in the celebration of Easter and other practices. But by the indefatigable exertions of the Roman pontiffs, who employed every instrument within their reach, the clergy were gradually influ- enced to adopt the Roman Easter in the eighth cen- tury : yet other differences remained to prevent a complete"], [111, ".7 Chap IV.

Ungust the first, who conquered the Dalriads, was the twenty-eighth monarch in a line of Pictissi kings, which commences with Drust the first, whose reign began about the year 414, and who is supposed to have been the first monarch of all the Picts. But the fame Ungust was the sixty-fourth in a line com mencing about the year 28 in the person of Cruthen, supposed to have been king of the Hebudian Picts only. Previously to Drust the regal catalogue is not strictly historical, but is considered as genuine on very probable grounds. The seventy-sixth in the entire list is Brudi the seventh, whose reign of one year only ended in 843, and who is commonly styled the last king of the Picts, as in the corrupted history of Scotland no people under this appellation are acknowledged as existing beyond that period. Kenneth, the son of Alpin, the immediate successor of Brudi, is accounted the first monarch of the Picts and Dalriads united, as the line of nominal kings or chieftains, who had presided over the latter since their conquest, vanissies at this time from history. Of North-Britissi affairs under this line of mo narchs very little of an authentic nature is known during a long course of time. About the year 1040, Macbeth, having murdered his relative, Duncan, the reigning monarch, usurped the crown : but, by the aid of an English army, led by Seward, earl of Northumberland, the usurper was defeated and slain by Macduff, earl of Fife, in 1057, and Mal- colm"], [112, "HISTORY OF THE 88 Chap IV KS-Y^J Stratclyde, 409-972, Galloway Ciimbria, colm the third, a son of Duncan, establissied on the throne. The Welch kingdom of Stratclyde appears to have subsisted in North-Britain from the dereliction of this iland by the Romans in the beginning of the fifth century, its territory, mostly flat and fer tile, extended along the river Clyde, in length about eighty and in breadth thirty miles, comprehending the present ssiires of Dumbarton and Renfrew, with great part of Lanerk. Its capital, originally a Ro man fortress, on a rock at the confluence of the Leven and Clyde, where stands the modern Dumbar ton, was named Theodosia, afterwards Alcluith. For the existence of this little kingdom during more than five hundred years we can chiefly account from the distractions and mutual jealousies of the Picts and Northumbrians. It was often, however, har ralsed, and seems to have been reduced under tri bute, particularly about the year 726, and at length completely conquered, and incorporated with his other dominions in 972, by the Pictissi monarch, Kenneth the fourth : yet the Welch of this territory continued long afterward a distinct people. To a much later time was the duration of the little king dom of Galloway, founded perhaps in the sixth century or sooner, whose princes were long inde pendent, and continued to subsist even in the twelfth century as feudatory lords : yet previously to the conquest of Stratclyde the Pictissi monarchy had acquired a territorial addition of considerable mag nitude in South-Britain.

Chang, of name to Scotland some degree of subjection to the Pictissi monarchs, was in 945 annexed formally to their dominions by Malcolm the first, to whom Edmund, king of England, having conquered the country, and cruelly blinded the two sons of Dunmail, its king, trans ferred whatever claim he might have to the Cum brian territories, on condition of homage, and of his defending the north of England from hostile in roads. Cumbria, whose final conquest, with that of Strat clyde near thirty years after, reduced the territorial command of the Welch within the limits of the present Wales, was during more than a hundred years a kind of appanage to the Pictissi monarchy ; as the intended successor of each reigning monarch was constituted prince, cr, according to the style then in use, king, of this country. In the obscure and doubtful accounts of transactions in North-Bri tain, intestine wars for the regal succession, and bat tles againlt invaders of the Danish denomination, scarcely any thing worth notice is ascertained till the time of Malcolm the third, about the middle of the eleventh century ; but previously to that epocha the country and its inhabitants had changed their name. To the Irish and their Dalriadan colony had belong ed the appellation of Scots, an appellation no longer given to the Dalriads after their conquest by the Picts. In the beginning of the eleventh century the Picts began to be denominated Scots, and North-Britain Scotland instead of Pictland.

Of the transactions of the people in habiting this part of the iland I shall only take no tice occasionally, in the intercourse of their princes with England, until I shall have arrived at a conve nient period, where I shall stop to take a retrospect, and to give a separate narrative of the events of Scot land. Long previously to the change of denomination from Pictland to Scotland had on most of South- Britain been impressed the new name of England, the land of the Angles, whose name from eminence of renown had so prevailed over those of the Saxons, Jutes, and Belgic Britons, that all these, united un der the dominion of Egbert, passed under the gene ral appellation of Angles or English. Egbert, the first monarch of all England, who had acquired the command of the Heptarchy by conquest, and sooth ed all the conquered people by a ssiadow of indepen dence, by nominal princes of their own choice, found himself establissied firmly on the throne by a dread of his abilities, by his popularity, and by the respect of the Englissi for the splendour of his race ; since all the royal families of the Heptarchy, except his own, that of Weffex, had become extinct. Possessed of such power, this prince seems to have formed a plan for the uniting of all South-Britain into one kingdom. As the commencement of such a scheme, he began the conquest of Wales, and, overrunning the northern region as far as Snowden, had"], [115, "BRITISH ILANDS. 91 had a flattering prospect of success, when he was re- Chap. called for the defense of his own dominions against the invasions of the Danes. In ages long anterior to the birth of Christ, as I Account have already observed, the regions about the Baltic Danes. had been peopled by Scandinavian Goths, who early adopted habits of maritime adventure. Armaments of Scandinavians, in the decline of Roman power, infested the coasts of European countries with pre datory visits : but after their conquest, in conjunc tion with the Saxons, of the south-eastern parts of Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries, which for some time served as a drain for their superfluous num bers, or for the individuals of their tribes most prone to adventure or emigration, we hear little more of their barbarous exploits till the latter part of the eighth century, when we again find Britain, Ireland, and France alarmed by their naval expeditions and inroads. From the violences committed by the Franks or French under Chariemagne, who in the course of his extensive conquests, from the year 768 to 814, put all pagans to the sword who refused to receive the rite of Christian baptism, the most obstinate and adventurous of the Saxons, a numerous and fierce people inhabiting the northern parts of modern Ger many, took refuge among the Scandinavians, whom they incited to renew the piratical warfare of their predecessors.

Implacably detesting the professors of the christian faith, particularly the clergy, on ac, count of the bloody persecutions of Charlemagne, they were besides inspired by the tenets of their pa gan superstition with a thirst of slaughter and a con tempt of death. The great object of their worship was Wodin, the imaginary God of war, into whose paradise admission could be obtained not otherwise than by hardy deeds of bloodshed. To die by other means than the stroke of warlike weapons was ac. counted so disgraceful, that warriors, in danger of departure by disease, procured a violent death by the hands of their friends. To assail two enemies at once, to receive with firmness the attack of three, to retire only one step from four, and to retreat from no fewer than five, was the martial rule, or point of honour, with a Danissi champion.

Destitute of all property in land, these royal pirates were styled sea kings. Others from various causes adventured in like manner, and easily collected followers. So glorious was accounted an occupation the most calamitous to mankind, that the riches acquired by the piracy of a father, were com monly buried at is death, for the purpose of neces sitating his sons to brave, after his example, the ele ments and war for the acquisition of new property. Much on this subject is given us in Turner's history of the Anglo-Saxons, in which an exter-sive reading, more than an acute judgement, is displayed by the author. By degeneracy had the Englissi become unable to cope in equal numbers with these new foes, or to ex- > ert with efficiency their national force. As a cor rupt Christianity had so debilitated the Belgic Britons as to render their conquest more easy to the Jutes, the Saxons, and Angles ; so a Christianity much more corrupt had, with proportionate effect, ope rated on these amalgamated nations.

The idola trous adoration of Saints and relics had seemingly almost superseded the worship due only to the Su preme being : by the belief of miracles incessantly performed on occasions of little or no importance men were prevented from the investigation and ad vantageous use of natural causes : for crimes the most atrocious the offended Deity was considered as appeased, and the remorse of conscience healed, not by repentance or amendment, nor by any kind of reparation to persons injured ; but merely by bene factions to the church, servile submission to the monks, pennances, and irrational modes of devo tion : all virtues of the active kind, promotive of social good, were discouraged, and merit ascribed chiefly to monastic observances : and a great part of the public, as well as private wealth, which might have been applied to the erection of fortresses, the equipping of naval armaments, the maintenance of troops, and the rewards of useful merit, was igno rantly wasted in pilgrimages to Rome, donations to the Papal see, the building of monasteries, and the support of useless multitudes of both sexes who de dicated their lives to the indolence of the cloister. The Danes are first noticed in the year 530 by Jornandes the Gothic historian, and in 560 by Pro copius the Greek. They were then a small nation; but, augmented in the eighth century by the refugee Saxons, they spread far and widely the terror of their name."], [119, "9A Chap, IV BRITISH ILANDS. name. Their first appearance in England was in the time of the Heptarchy in the year 787, when a small band, debarking in Weffex, apparently with a view of exploring the country, killed one of the king's officers, who had come to them to demand an ac count of their denomination and object of their voyage. This band escaped without loss, and with little or no booty ; but in six years afterwards a stronger armament appeared on the coast of Nor thumberland, where, beside other acts of devasta tion, the famous monastery of Lindesfarne was plun dered. In the following year, 794, the fame quarter was alarmed by another squadron, and the monas tery of Weremouth pillaged ; but the elements were unfavourable. The fleet was ssiattered by a tempest, many of the pirates were drowned, and the rest, overpowered by numbers, were defeated, many of them captured and consigned to death. We hear nothing more of Danissi descents on the Englissi coasts till the reign of Egbert, when, in 832, a for midable squadron plundered unopposed the ile of Sheppey, a fertile tract, seven miles long and three broad, parted from the mainland of Kent by the east and west Swale, the two emuent channels of the river Medway. In the si^sequent year a body of probably between two and three thousand, landing from thirty-five vessels at Charmouth in Dorsctssiire, engaged an Englissi arm^led by their monarch, and, after great havoc on both sides with doubtful success, effected a retreat. In 835 a greater body, invading Cornwall, persuaded the Welch of that peninsula to revolt ;"], [120, "HISTORY OF THE 96 Chap, revolt; but at Hengsdown-hill their combined forces ,_ lYs _, were discomfited by Egbert with signal slaughter. Reig,, of To the English, threatened by a foe so formidable, Ethdwolf. the death of Egbert in 836 was a great misfortune. 836-857. HJs son and successorj Ethel wolf, far inferior in abili- ties, began his reign with a division of his kingdom, transferring the old Heptarchic provinces of Essex, Kent, and Sussex, to Athelstan, his eldest son, to whom he gave also the title of king. The desolating visits of the Danes became frequent, and filled with alarm all parts of England. Ascending the rivers in their fleets of light vessels, which commonly carried sixty or seventy warriors each, they suddenly spread havoc ; and, generally before an efficient force could be as- sembled to oppose them, reimbarked wi.h the spoil and soon made their appearance in some other part of the country. Many battles, mostly skirmishes, were fought with variety of success. Where the in- vaders were defeated, a temporary or partial benefit only thence accrued. In 851 the evil encreased to such magnitude, as to threaten the total devastation, or conquest of England. An army, debarking in the Thames from tfcee hundred and fifty vessels, . burned the cities of Canterbury and London, whence they continued their defeating progress into Surrey. Here at Oktly they were met by the forces of Wessex, led by the king and his second son Ethelbald, whom the vehemence of the preslLig danger had aroused fo 851. extraordinary exertion. In a battle supposed more bloody than had ever before been fought in Gre.it Britain the Danes were defeated : yet, though two other of their parties had in the fame year been re- pulsed,"], [121, "BRITISH ILANDS. 07 pulsed, the invaders retained possession of Thanet, Chap. where, like Hengist, they fixed their first settlement 1V' on the Britissi coasts. That Ethelwolf, amid the dangers and distressful poverty of his people, made a whole year's pilgri- mage to Rome, and benefactions to the Papal See, is characteristic of this prince, and of the superstition then prevalent. On his return in S55, he found troops in array to exclude him from the throne, headed by his second son Ethelbald, who, on the decease of Athelstan, the eldest, had claimed the mo- narchy. To prevent civil war in a time of such danger from abroad, a partition was made by mu- tual agreement. To the son was consigned the king- dom of Weffex ; to the father the eastern parts of England, then accounted less considerable, and more exposed to Danissi depredation. In the same year a national assembly, or great council composed of the chief clergy and nobles, convened at Winchester by Ethelwolf, conferred on the church the tenth of all the lands belonging to the crown, and exempted ec- clesiastical property from every kind of tax or na- tional demand. This monarchhad with equal faci- lity procured the fame grant ror the clergy in the kingdom of Weffex ; and his subjects may have re garded such an act of religion as a mode of obtain ing miraculous interference against Danissi invasion.

The reign of Ethelbert, to whom a better character has been given, was also ssiort. He died in 866, and was succeeded by his brother next in age, Ethered, whose government was, without remission, unquiet and calamitous. The Danes, who had still continued to infest the coasts with predatory descents, in one of which they had pillaged Win chester, made now a grand invasion under leaders more illustrious, with a deliberately determined view of wreaking vengeance on the Englissi for the death of Rag-iar Lodbrog, a most celebrated plunderer, who is said to have been shipwrecked on the Northumbrian coast, captured by Ella, prince of that country, and inhumanly put to death in a dungeon by the stings of serpents.

Thence invading Northumbria, they seized the city of York ; repulsed the forces led to dislodge them ; and slew the two leaders, Osoert and Ella, princes who had been engaged against each other in civil war for the government of that pro vince, and had suspended their feud to unite against the common enemy. Ella is said to have been taken alive, and doomed to expire in torments in revenge for"], [123, "09 Chap IV BRITISH ILANDS. for the death of Ragnar. Eager for havoc, and em boldened by success, the Danes advanced into the cen ter of Britain, and took possession of Nottingham, whence, invested by a great body of troops, they retired, under a sort of capitulation to Northumbria. In Lincolnssiire one of their armies was discomfited, and three of their kings slain, by earl Algar ; but, by the union of their forces, and the disobedient ar dour of his own troops, this heroic and skilful com mander fell soon after in battle with most of his fol lowers. Removing from York in 870 to Thetford in the country of the East-Angles, the invaders were assailed by that people, who had found in submission only a ssiort relief The East- Angles were routed, and Edmund, their king or viceroy, was captured, scourged, and beheaded. Penetrating to the middle of the Englissi territories in the South, the Danes establissied their head-quarters at Reading, whence king Ethered in vain attempted to dislodge them by the forces of Weffex, as the Mercians, foolishly aiming at independence, refused to assist him. He engaged them in five battles, in one year, with various for tune. In one of these, at Aston in Berkshire, a di vision of his army, under his brother Alfred, was surrounded by the Danes, and in danger of being cut to pieces : yet Ethered refused to march for its rescue, till the mass was finissied where he happened then to be an auditor. The victory was gained chiefly by the conduct of Alfred, and the merit of it ascribed wholly to this absurd piety. Mortally wounded in another engagement, in the same year, 871, Ethered was succeedecLby Alfred amid circum stances most distressful. H 2 CHAP."], [124, "HISTORY OF THE 100 Cm? V Education of Alfred.

From the reading of English he aspired , J* to the study of the Latin and Greek languages, in which he knew that he should find writings more suited to his heroic spirit and elegance of tade j but could then make little progress, as he could not, till after his accession to the throne, procure instruc tors. From the delightful pursuits of literature he withdrew with reluctance, to give assistance to Ethe red against the Danes, generously sacrificing to the public exigency whatever resentment he might have felt toward his brother, who had withheld from him a property bequeathed to him by his father. With like reluctance, on the decease of Ethered, he as cended the throne to the exclusion of the infant children of his brother, in obedience to his father's will, the ardent call of his people, and the imperi ous necessity of the cafe, when the ablest commander was required against a most formidable foe.

His abilities were put to a most severe, and for some time unpromising trial. In the first month of his reign he was discomfited at Wilton ; but the Danes, intimidated by their mighty loss in this and other desperate battles, of which not less than eight were fought in this year, agreed by treaty to evacuate Weffex. By Burthred, subordinate king of Mercia, in whose territory Lon don, their next post, was situate, they were per- suaded"], [126, "102 HISTORY OF THE Chap, suaded by the force of presents to retire thence also. . \u25a0 But, finding no object in the country of the East- Angles, which they had wasted, they returned into 874. Mercia in 874, where, taking their station at Repton in Derbyssiire, they made a desolating conquest. Burthred, the last king in this province, brother-in law to Alfred, fled to Rome, and took refuge in a 875. monastery. Augmented by large re-inforcements from Scandinavia, the Danes divided into two bodies at Repton, one of which under Haldane marched northward into Northumbria ; the other, under Gu- thrum, Oscitil, and Amund, south-eastward to Cam bridge, where they wintered. 876. Guthrum and his associates, dislodging suddenly from Cambridge in 876, made a rapid invasion of Weffex, and penetrating to its southern ssiores, seized Wareham in Dorset by surprise. Straitened in these quarters by the arrangements of the king, they sti pulated to retire from his province, and confirmed the stipulation by an oath on holy relics, which Al fred is said to have administered merely from a hope that these unbelievers, in case of its violation, would be miraculously punissied. Whatever may have been the real opinion of this wise prince, the Danes, re gardless of their treaty, discomfited by a sudden on set the troops of Weffex, and, moving rapidly to the S77. west, surprised Exeter. Here they were fiercely in- vested on land with all the force which Alfred could collect ; and were blockaded by a squadron chiefly manned with Frisian pirates hired by this monarch. Discouraged by the loss of a hundred and twenty of their vessels, wrecked in a tempest on the rocks of Swanwick,"], [127, "BRITISH ILANDS. 103 Chap V 878 His retire- ment 87S-880, Swanwick, on the southern coast, and by the defeat of another armament in an engagement with the blockading fleet, they by another capitulation retired from Weffex into Mercia. But, augmented by a newly arrived army of their compatriots, they again violated their treaty, and, re-entering Weffex, took post at Chippenham in Wiltshire in 878. In utter des pondence the subjects of Alfred could no longer be roused by his most ardent exhortations. Some fled to Wales or to transmarine regions ; some to devious wilds ; and the rest endeavoured, by the most abject submission, to mitigate the fury of the ferocious con querors. The king is suspected to have caused by some misconduct, in this early part of his reign, the desertion of his subjects from him ; but we are not sufficiently furnissied with facts to form in this case a decided opinion. Destitute of troops, Alfred, submitting to neces sity, dismissed his attendants, and, disguising his per son in the garb of a peasant, took refuge for a time in the cottage of a neat-herd. Here, intent on higher objects, plans for the rescue of his afflicted people, he attended not to the toasting of some cakes, which his hostess, ignorant of his rank, had one day committed to his care ; and, having suffered them to be burned, he received an apparently just repri mand for the neglect of that which was so hospita bly soared with him. He is said to have afterwards, in his prosperity, persuaded this herdsman, named Denulf, to cultivate letters, and to have promoted him in the church till he became bissiop of Win chester. As the first step in the train of his maturely weighed"], [128, "HISTORY OF THE 104 Chap V weighed projects, Alfred assembled a few of his t bravest nobles, and raised a fortress in a lonely spot, devious and inscrutable to the enemy, environed by woods of alder, and an extensive bog, which had been formed by the overflowing and stagnant waters of the rivers Thone and Parett in Somersetshire. This well-chosen spot, containing about two acres of solid ground, he called Aetheling-ey, which signified the ile of nobles or princes, a name now contracted into Athelney. Hence he made well-timed and rapid ex- cursions for the annoyance of the foe, and the encouragement and maintenance of his followers, slaughtering detached parties and subsisting on their prey. An opportunity, which he patiently awaited, at length occurred, of again calling his people to arms for decisive battle. Oddune, earl of Devon- ssiire, reduced by the failure of provisions, in the castle of Kinwith in that county, where he was be- sieged, to the dreadful alternative of a furrendry or a desperate sally, executed the latter with such judg- ment and fortune, that he routed with great slaugh- ter the besieging Danes by surprise in the night, slew Ubbo or Hubba, their leader, and captured their famous Reafcn, a standard in which was inwoven a raven's figure, regarded by the Danes as magical, and in its casual motions oracular. Elated by the news of this event, a symptom of reviving spirit among his subjects, Alfred resolved, by personally exploring the enemy's quarters, to ascertain whether the state of affairs was ripe as yet for his re-appear. ing at the head cf an army. Assuming"], [129, "BRITISH ILANDS. 105 Chap \u00a5 His renew al of War 880, Assuming the disguise of a harper, he had the boldness to enter the Danissi camp, and the address to give such pleasure by his music and affected drol lery, that he was entertained several days, and intro duced to Guthrum the chief commander. Satisfied of his enemy's unguarded state, he by emissaries in every direction summoned his nobles and their fol lowers to Brixton near Selwood forest. These ha ving experienced still deeper affliction in peace from the brutal tyranny of their conquerors, than they had before from the violence of hostility, assembled with alacrity on the appointed day, and with ssiouts of joy recognized their heroic monarch, whom they had long considered as dead. Leading them to Ed dington, where the Danes were encamped, without loss of a moment, he made a well directed and fu rious attack. Unprepared, and astonished at the sud den sight of an Englissi army, with Alfred at its head, the Danes were with appalling havoc put to rout. Besieged in a fortified camp, where they had taken refuge, they surrendered at discretion from want of provisions. Alfred, obeying the dictates of wisdom and humanity, instead of consigning them to butchery for the gratification of revenge, admitted Guthrum and his followers to the state of allies or feudal subjects, on their consenting to become chris tians ; to occupy, as settlers, the desolated lands of the Northumbrians and East-Angles ; and to co operate with the Englissi in preventing the ravages of other Scandinavians.

All, who were judged fit for military service, were enrolled, armed, and regularly employed in duties which they performed in constant rotation ; each in his turn cultivating the land, guarding a fortress, and standing ready to re? pair in arms to an appointed place on a signal of alarm. While the land was so garrisoned as to pre- sent in every quarter a powerful defense to an inva- ding enemy, a fleet of a hundred and twenty stout ships, manned with able seamen, Englissi and Frisi- ans, well equipped and furnissied with engines of war, was stationed on the coasts to intercept the ap- proach or the retreat of hostile armaments, and in the latter case to punissi for their depredation. To conciliate the Danissi colonists, those who had settled in the territories of the Northumbrians and East- Angles were governed by their own princes, and they"], [131, "10? Chap, * V. His last war with the Danes, 893--S97 BRITISH ILANDS. they were every where placed by the laws on an exact equality with the Englissi ; in exemplification of which we may observe that the fines prescribed for murder were the same without distinction of Dane from Englissiman. The arrangements of Alfred, the most efficacious which the debilitated condition of his realm admit- ted, were after some fruitless attempts of smaller squadrons, put to a severe and decisive trial by a great armament of Danes in 893. From the terri- tories of France, exhausted by his rapine, Hastings returned to the Englissi coast with a fleet of three hundred and thirty vessels, which probably carried above twenty thousand combatants, The greater part of these, landing on the southern coast of Kent, seized the fort of Appuldore ; while Hastings, di- recting his course to the Medway with eighty ships, took post at Milton in the northern side of the fame county. Alfred, hastening to the scene of action, slaughtered the straggling parties of the foe ; and taking a position in the central parts of Kent, between the two Danissi armies, he watched their motions and straitened their quarters. After ssiir- missies almost incessant, between parties attempting to plunder, and parties protecting the country, in which most of the year 894 was consumed, the two Danissi armies moved suddenly from their encamp- ments, with intention to cross the Thames into Es sex. Intercepted by the king at Farnham, the troops from Appuldore were defeated, with the loss of their plunder and many lives. The remnant escaped to the ile of Mersea in Essex, a low tract five miles in length,"], [132, "HISTORY OF THE 108 Chap. V. length, parted from the main land by the effluent channels of the river Colne, Hence they soon after effected a junction with Hastings, who retired to Bamflete in the fame county. From the execution of his plans against this post Alfred was called suddenly, by a new alarm, to another part of his dominions. As Guthrum was dead, and others of their leaders attached to the Englissi monarch, the Danes of the Northumbrian and East-Anglian territories, yielding to the impulse of a renovated spirit of plunder, when opportunity seemed given, collected a fleet, and, sailing to the southern coast, invested suddenly the city of Exeter. Instantly Alfred made a rapid march to this quarter, surprised the besiegers, routed and drove them to their ships. But in his absence the Danes at Bamflete, leaving their wives, children, and booty, in their fortified camp under a strong guard, poured into the interior country with rueful devastation. Of this was taken a wise advantage by the garrison left by the king in London. Marching with great secrecy, these troops made an unexpected and successful assault on the Danissi camp, where they secured much plunder and many prisoners, among whom were the wife and two sons of Hastings, Always disposed to draw from his victories utility without revenge, Alfred restored to this commander these dear pledges in the vain hope of prevailing on him to depart from England. The banded robbers, unable to bear the ssiame of retiring without mag nificent spoil, and still hoping to make a conquest, continued to alarm the country for above two years, effecting"], [133, "BRITISH ILANDS. 109 Chap V His civil regulation.. 897--901 effecting a retreat by furious efforts from place to place. Thus, besieged at Boddington in the county of Glocester, till many died by famine, they by a desperate sally, forced their way, with great loss, through the Englissi, and by a rapid march, regain ed their pott in Essex. Hastings, who had been above thirty years incessantly engaged in predatory war, and appears to have been one of the ablest commanders recorded in history, is said to have at length withdrawn himself to France, and to have spent the rest of his life in privacy, in a territory given him by the French monarch. The small rem nant of the hostile Danes in England betook them selves to the sea under Sigefert a Northumbrian, who had constructed vessels of extraordinary height, length, and swiftness. These were soon surpassed in force and celerity, and totally defeated, by ships of Alfred's contrivance, who hanged the crews of twenty barks, condemned at Winchester as the com mon enemies of mankind. The Northumbrian and East-Anglian Danes, who, after their overthrow at Exeter, had been foiled in attempts elsewhere, re newed their submissions ; and the few, who refused to become peaceable subjects, were obliged to aban don the Englissi territories. After his final prevalence against the Danes in 897, Alfred, unmolested during the remaining sour years of his reign, had leisure, with full force, to renew his application to the institutions of civil govern ment, and the general improvement of his people. These institutions, already in part establissied by ancient custom, he new modeled, extended, and confirmed"], [134, "HISTORY OF THE 110 Chap V confirmed by provisions for their strict and steady execution. Subserviently to the regular administra tion of justice he divided and subdivided his king dom, according to a survey previously made, and registered in the book of Winchester. His division of it into ssiires was not widely different from that which now subsists. The ssiires were divided into trithings or thirds, or into parts of other denomina tions. Of this partition some vestiges are still dis coverable, as in the leths of Kent, the rapes of Sus sex, and the corrupt appellation of ridings in York ssiire. The trithings or immediate parts of a ssiire, were subdivided into hundreds, and each hundred into ten tithings, or decennaries, each of which con tained about the number of ten families. To be punissied as a vagabond every man was liable, who was not regularly registered in some ti thing ; and for this privilege residence and a good character were absolutely requisite, as the men com posing this little community were collectively respon sible for the conduct of each member. Over each decennary, called also a freebourg, as consisting of none others than freemen, since to staves was allowed no political existence, presided one of its members, elected by the rest, termed tithingman, borssiolder, or headbourg, who convened them occasionally, and acted according to their determination. If a crimi nal escaped from justice, and remained unapprehen ded thirty-one days, his tithing was fined, unless twelve men, consisting of the borssiolder and two of the most respectable members of this and of each of three neighbouring freeboutes, should make oath that"], [135, "BRITISH ILANDS. 111 that none in his tithing had been an accomplice Chap. with the culprit ; that they had not connived at his ,__ ' escape ; and that they had used, and would use, their utmost exertions for his apprehension. Appeals, and matters of concern between different freebourgs, were discussed in the next superior court, that of the hundred, which commonly assembled once in a month, and because its members appeared under arms, which were put to mutual contact, was called a wapontac. Here the votes of all were collected, and the result reported, by the hundredary, the elected president. Hence lay appeals to the trithing court, composed in like manner of the hundreds within the trithing; and thence to the Shir ege mot, the conven tion of the county. In this presided the alderman^ or earl, an officer at once military and civil, who seems to have been appointed by the king. He was assisted by the bissiop, a civil officer termed stirege ri'eve or ssieriff, and twelve assessors skilled in the laws, denominated lahmen or lawmen, sworn to act impartially, who collected the suffrages of the assem bly, and pronounced the decision. This, like our present courts of assize, was- held twice in the year, in spring and autumn. To diminissi the perplexing number of appeals, His encou which were ultimately carried to the king himself in 0f litera council, great exertions were made for the removal ture' of ignorance and corruption in judges. For this and the general melioration of manners all possible en couragement was given to the cultivation of litera ture. Of the monasteries ruined by Danissi ferocity many were re-built, re-peopled with monks, and fur- nissied"], [136, "HISTORY OF THE 112 Chap, nissied with books. Beside these, which were in- V' tended for schools of public instruction, seminaries, supplied with the best professors procurable from abroad, were instituted on a more extensive plan, particularly at Oxford, the foundation of whose uni- versify seems justly ascribable to this monarch. To the support of professors and scholars in his various literary establissiments Alfred appropriated the eighth of his whole revenue. Not only encouragement, but even some degree of compulsion, was employed for the dissemination of letters. A penalty is said to have been enacted against every freeholder, possessed of two hides, or about two hundred acres, of land, who sent not his sons to some school. Wonderful was the success collectively resulting from a variety of arrangements. In the beginning of his reign Al- fred had to lament that to the north of the Thames very sew, and to the south not one, was found capa- ble of interpreting the- latin service of the church: but at the end he had to boast, that all the episcopal sees in his kingdom were filled by prelates of great learning, and every pulpit furnissied with a good preacher. By proper instruction and the terrors of law the manners were in general entirely changed. To express the excellence of order, to which the na- tion from a perturbid state had been reclaimed, some early historians have hyperbolically asserted, that money, or golden ornaments, of whatsoever value, left in the public roads or the open fields, remained untouched till found by the owners. Among the men of learning invited from all parts to his court by this prince to assist him in his studies and"], [137, "British ilands. us and schemes of reformation, was Asser, a monk of Chap. Saint Davids in Wales, who wrote a narrative of Alfred's life, simple and interesting, whence we chiefly derive our knowledge of this period in Eng lish history. Of application to letters the king him self gave the brightest example. Every moment of leisure^ even amid the horrors of war, was dedicated to this. In peace he commonly divided the day and night into three equal portions, measured, as is prac ticed at this time still in China, by burning tapers of equal lengths, when clocks and dials were un known. One part was appropriated to sleep and re fressiment, another to business, a third to study and devotion. His mental acquirements were fully pro portioned to his labour. He became, after his esta blissiment on the throne, well acquainted with Latin and Greek, the former of which he is said to have spoken fluently as Englissi. He excelled in oratory, philosophy, history, mathematics, music, architec ture, and was in merit of composition the prince of Englissi poets. He wrote a number of books for the information of his subjects, some of which were ori* ginal, and some translated from the La.in. His efforts were extended to the promotion of all Hisen.nu useful arts, particularly those of navigation and com- \u201e_ ys merce, in which his conceptions Were so surprisingly mcr'c' *c\" luminous, amid the predominant gloom of barba rism, that he employed the ablest navigators to make long voyages of discovery.

If the particulars of other voyages also had been preserved, we ssiould have some curious information concerning even In dia, with whose inhabitants this monarch attempted to open an intercourse. Sighelm, an Englissi priest, sent as his envoy to the christians of Saint Thomas in that country, returned with a cargo of spices and jewels. What was the course of Sighelm, who might have gone by Egypt and the Red Sea, we are left to conjecture ; but that the author of the Saxon chro nicle and William of Malmsoury, writers of the twelfth century, were as incapable of inventing such a story, as of conceiving the designs of Alfred, has been justly observed. London, which, like many other towns, he bad rebuilt from Danissi destruction, this prince made the seat of government, and the center of commerce. His projects appear to have been vast and splendid, such as would have raised his kingdom to an extraordinary pitch of glory ; but to their prosecution a stop was put forever by his death in the fifty-third year of his age, and thir tieth of his reign, the first of the tenth century, in the full vigour of all his faculties.

Conformable to this was- the me morable sentiment recorded in his will that forever to remain as free as their own thoughts was agreeably to strictness of justice the right of the Englist). Of Alfred's three sons the eldest, Edmund, died before him without offspring ; the third, Ethehvard, addicted his life to literature ; the second succeeded him in the throne, styled by historians Edward the elder, as he was the first king of England who bore the name of Edward. With the life of the great Alfred the nascent light of England faded and be came extinct. Domestic strife enabled the Danes to renew their inroads, and to throw the country again into confusion. Claiming the crown in right of Ethelbert, his father, who had been an elder brother of Alfred, a prince named Ethelwald assembled his partizans at Winburn in Dorsetssiire ; but, on the king's approach with forces far superior, fled into Normandy. Thence returning, and engaging the Northumbrian Danes in his interest, he withdrew again beyond sea, and was nearly three years employ ed in collecting for invasion an army of adventurers. Landing with those, and assisted not only by the Northumbrian and East-Anglian Danes, but also by the Five-burghers, in the year 904, he committed great ravages in Mercia. Retiring, when Edward advanced against him with his assembled forces, he was pursued by the latter, who retaliated his depre dations on the East-Anglian Danes. The troops of Ethelwald, assailing the Kentissi men, who, when the"], [141, "UT Chap V BRITISH ILANDS. the king retired, had remained, contrary to orders, at Bury in Suffolk, gained a victory, but lost their commander, who sell in the engagement. Thus freed, by Ethelwald's death, from all danger of a competitor, Edward yet remained still embar rassed by the consequences of this competition, en gaged almost incessantly during the rest of his reign in hostilities, mostly successful, against the Danes both foreign and domestic. In 911, when an arma ment was sent to attack them from the sea, the Nor thumbrians, imagining the king's principal force employed on that element, made an irruption into the interior parts of England, which they expected to find defenseless, and collected great spoil : but, intercepted in their return at Tetenhall in Stafford ssiire, they were defeated with great slaughter, and the loss of all their booty. The military genius of his father, inherited by Edward, without his lite rary or legislative talents, enabled him not only to maintain a constant superiority over the Danes, per petually attempting invasions from abroad, or insur rections at home, but also to reduce the Welch to submission, and to overawe Scotland. In his various operations he was powerfully seconded by his sister Ethelfleda, queen of the Mercians, who, animated by the martial spirit of the incomparable Alfred, which had descended to her as hereditary, conducted armies with such courage and address as would have stamped on a man the character of a great general. On the death of this heroine in the year 920, Mer cia, taken under Edward's immediate government, ceased to be regarded as a separate kingdom. This prince"], [142, "HISTORY OF THE 118 Chap V Reign of At.hel.lan 923-941 prince himself, remarkable, beside his many victo. ries, for the numerous fortresses raised for the pro. section of his towns, and dominions in general, died in 925, leaving the succession to his son Athelstan, concerning whose legitimacy a question still subsists, as doubtful as it is unimportant. A story is recorded concerning a nobleman named Alfred, who is said to have conspired against Athel stan, to have declared his innocence on oath in the presence of the Pope, and to have died immediately after of convulsions, which was regarded as an in dubitable proof of his guilt. As his confiscated estate, conferred on the monks of Malmsoury, was dedicated to the church, no inquiry would be made en the question of criminality. To attach the Nor thumbrian Danes to his interest, Athelstan conceded the title of king, with Edgitha, his sister, in mar riage, to Sithric, their chief lord : but fortune was unfavourable. On the death of Sithric, which hap pened in a year, his two sons by a former wife re nounced Christianity and the Englissi alliance. Ex pelled by an Englissi army, the one, called Godfrid, took refuge in Scotland, the other, named Anlaff, in Ireland. The former unprotected by the Scottish monarch, betook himself to piracy, and died some years after in that occupation. But the latter, col lecting as great a number as possible of adventurers, formed a confederacy with some Welch princes and Constantine king of Scotland. The last was incensed against Athelstan, who had invaded his dominions in 934, and forced him to make humiliating sub missions, on account of his having declined to de- liver"], [143, "110 CllAP, V Battle of Brunan- burgh 938 BRITISH ILANDS. liver Godfrid, as a prisoner, into the hands of the Englissi. The confederates, invading England with united forces, in 938, were stopped in their career of devastation by the approach of an Englissi army at a place then called Brunanburgh, of which the situation is not known, but seems to have been on the southern side of the Humber, as the invasion is said to have been effected from a fleet in that estuary, and the march of the invaders directed southward. To explore the condition of the English troops, Anlaff, in imitation of the great Alfred, entered their camp in the disguise of a harper, was intro duced into Athelstan's tent, and was rewarded at his departure with a piece of money. From absurd ideas of pride he buried this money in the earth, as unworthy of his possession, so soon as he thought himself beyond the reach of observation. This act confirmed the suspicion of a soldier, who had for merly served under him, and now watched his mo tions. The soldier, unwilling to betray either his former or his present master, deferred the commu nication of this intelligence to the Englissi monarch until Anlaff was beyond the danger of pursuit. On the following night the Englissi camp was assailed, and the attack immediately pointed to the quarters of Athelstan. Aware of this event, the king had removed to another part of the encampment ; but the place was occupied by a bissiop, who, according to the custom of the times, had taken arms, had then arrived with his troops, and who thus fell a victim to the plan of assault led by Anlaff. With this alarm, not unexpected, commenced a most ob- stinate"], [144, "130 ClIAP V Death and character c,f Athel stan. 9-.1 P. tign of Jj.dir.und. 911-946 HISTORY OF THE stinate and bloody combat, distinguissied by the name of the great battle, which lasted throughout the whole succeeding day, and ended in a total defeat of the confederates, of whom the greater part were slain, with five of their princes and twelve chieftains. An. laff and Constantine effected their escape, not with out difficulty, to their ships. The power of Athel. stan was confirmed, and his reputation so raised, that his alliance was courted by continental potentates; but he died in 941, too soon for the establissiment of national prosperity. He is reputed by some the first monarch of England, as the chief kingdoms of the Heptarchy had survived, though in a subordinate rank, the conquests of Egbert ; and the Danes had divided with Alfred the dominion of the country. Athelstan appears not only to have possessed high military talents, but also some sparks of intelligence extraordinary in that age of barbarism. By one of his laws, a merchant or mariner, who made three long voyages with a ssiip and cargo of his own, was thereby entitled to admission into the class of Thanes, a class which appears to have comprehended the gentry and all the nobility, with exception of those who were of royal blood. He also establissied mints in all the commercial towns to enable the merchants to convert with facility their bullion into current coin. To Athelstan, who died unmarried, succeeded Ids brother Edmund, a youth of eighteen, who was quickly called into action by the revolt of the Northumbrian Danes and turbulence of the Five burghers. The latter he removed from the towns of"], [145, "BRITISH ILANDS. 121 of a central situation to places where their disaflec- Ckir. tion might be less dangerous. The former he re- ,_ * duced after the decease of Anlaff, who had a second time returned from Ireland into Northumbria, on the news of Athelstan's death, and who had excited a war, of which the success is differently related, but who soon after died. In the following year he reduced the Welch kingdom of Cumbria, and con ferred it on the king of Scotland, as has been al ready related in the fourth chapter. The manner of this young monarch's death, in the seventh year of his reign, is a striking proof of a most disordered state of society, a melancholy deterioration from the eflablissiments of the great Alfred. Engaged in the celebration of a festival, at what place we cannot decisively fay, Edmund observed a notorious robber, named Leolf, entering the hall, seating himself at the table with his attendants, and resisting the efforts of an officer who attempted to remove him. The king in a rage russiing imprudently on Leolf, and dragging him by the hair to the ground, received a wound from the villain's dagger, in consequence ' of which he immediately breathed his last. This is the commonly received account. That he fell in the tumult of the feast is evident ; but by what hand seems doubtful. In the reign of Edred, the brother of Edmund, Reijrnof who succeeded in preference to the infant sons of ',, \" the latter, such measures were adopted in ecclesiasti cal affairs as completed the debasement of society and weakness of the kingdom. This monarch, hav ing twice reduced the Northumbrians, who had re- newed"], [146, "HISTORY OF THE 122 Chap V Punflan newed their depredations under a leader named Eric, having placed garrisons among them, having divested their country of the name of kingdom, and having appointed an Englissi governor over them with the title of ear), in 952, might seem to have secured the internal peace of his people by the exercise of mar tial and political talents : but, with a mental debi lity hardly compatible with such, he resigned him self to superstition and the guidance of Dunstan, a monk of the most pestilent principles and profligate ambition. Dunstan was born in 925. Possessed of uncom mon industry and talents, he made such a profici ency in arts and literature that he was accused of magic, and on that account expelled from the court of Edmund, into which he had been introduced. His temper was impetuous, his ambition ardent. Finding himself insurmountably barred, by the gross ignorance of the age, from the acquirement of ho nours by honest means, the culture of science, he seems to have gradually contracted a confirmed habit of misanthropy, and to have resolved on the pur suit of his object through the medium of popular superstition. Though captivated by the charms of a beautiful young female, whom he eagerly wished to espouse, he became a monk of extreme austerity, renouncing all the comforts of human life for the attainment of its dignities. He chose for his place of solitary abode a hole in the earth, like a grave, five feet long, two and a half broad, scarcely deep enough to allow him to stand upright under its door or lid, in which was a small aperture for the admis- sion"], [147, "BRITISH ILANDS. 123 sion of air. Lying miracles the most absurd were Chap. not neglected, of which one instance may suffice. He was said to have seized, with red hot pincers, the nose of the Devil, who had come to his cell in human shape, and to have caused him to bellow from pain in a tremendous manner. Such were the effects of the plan adopted by this monk, that, as Hume has observed, \" it insured to Dunstan a reputation, which no real piety, much less virtue, could, even in the most enlightened period, have ever been able to procure him with the people.\" He was again called to court in the reign of Edmund ; became abbot of Glaston bury, and afterwards treasurer and confessor toEdred, over whom he exercised an uncontrolled influence, and whose treasures, on his death, he appropriated to his own use. By his authority was imported a new order of monks, whose establissiment excited the most violent commotions, and effected an im portant change in the ecclesiastical state of England. The monks of this country had hitherto been a iptroduc kind of secular priests, like the present canons or Benedic prebendaries, not bound by the rigid rules of an order, nor interdicted from an application of their talents to objects of public utility, nor enthralled by vows of implicit obedience to their superiors, nor prohibited from marriage, into the state of which they were allowed to enter even without quitting the convent. But, from a strange propensity in man kind, where the light of genuine literature is want ing, to run into religious extremes at once repug nant to nature and reason, a new species of monks had arisen, founded by Benedict, an Italian, in the sixth century, who regarded the violation of nature's laws"], [148, "12+ Chap Y Reign of Edwin. &5J-959 HISTORY OF THE laws the surest mode of pleasing its author, secluded themselves totally from the world, renounced all claim to freedom of acting or even of thinking, and held as highly meritorious a total abstinence from that commerce with the fair sex without which the human species must cease to have existence. Sen sible that a clergy indulged in marriage, and thereby connected with the body politic, could never be brought into that absolute slavery to their superiors which was competent with their wissi of rendering themselves the despotic lord6 of the church, the popes gave every encouragement to this new order of devotees, as the commencement of a plan to re duce all ecclesiastics under the rule of celibacy. This bold stroke of policy, well fitted for the purpose of papal despotism, but adverse to the strongest propen sities of human nature, was at length completely successful, but not till after a struggle of near three centuries. For the advancement of such projects in England no instrument could be found by the sove reign pontiffs more convenient than Dunstan. This furious bigot, actuated by ambitious views, and the dictates of a temper arrogant and impetuous, abused the royal authority, the public treasure, and the miserably misplaced veneration of the multitude, to the establishment of Benedictine convents and the distress of the secular clergy. As the latter defended their rights with vigour, the commotion was violent. The progress of the former was in some degree re tarded by the death of Edred in 955.

This prince, Chap. named Edwy, more properly Edwin, son of the mur- t /!__, dered Edmund, was not more than sixteen years of age when he acceded to the throne on the decease of his uncle, whose children, being infants, were ex cluded in those times of turbulence. Beautiful in person, of an amiable disposition, and of promising virtue, he was, notwithstanding, odious to Dunstan, who was conscious of having abused the late king's imbecility to the total impoverissiment of the crown, and who also may have dreaded a discernment and vigour of mind in the young monarch incompatible with his designs of ecclesiastical domination. As if determined to bring instantly the affair to decision between himself and his sovereign, this audacious monk, in the very day of the coronation, made a violent attack. Disliking the riot of intemperance, to which the Englissi were addicted, or allured by connubial affection, the king without a prudent re gard to prevailing manners and ideas, retired after dinner to his queen's apartment, leaving his nobles and prelates drinking in the great hall. Elgiva the queen, his relative within the degrees prescribed by the canons, was not by the monks allowed to be his wise. Dunstan, accompanied by Cynesius, a bissiop, forced his way into the apartment where Edwin was sitting with Elgiva and her mother ; outraged the ladies with approbrious language ; and violently dragged the monarch back into the hall. Enraged by such brutality, the king called Dun stan to account for his abuse of the public treasure, drove him into exile, and, expelling the new monks, restored"], [150, "HISTORY OF THE 126 Chap V \\^S~Y^J Reign of Edgar. 959-975 restored the rightful owners to their monasteries. But the partizans of the ambitious churchman, zea lously active, and by the fatal engine of superstition powerful, formed a conspiracy, which quite over matched all the force collected by the youthful mo narch. Odo, archbissiop of Canterbury, a fero cious bigot, who was of Danissi race and had him self been a soldier, forced the palace with a body of armed men, seized Elgiva, against whom he had pro nounced a sentence of divorce, branded her face with a hot iron to destroy her enchanting beauty, and banissied her into Ireland. Unfortunate in her per sonal charms and conjugal attachment, this princess, when nature had healed the sears of her visage, returned to England ; but was intercepted at Glo cester by her inhuman foes, who, from affected mo tives of blasphemed religion, cut the tendons of her legs, and left her to expire in agony. With a he roic spirit Edwin determined rather to perissi than to yield himself the abject slave of demonial hypocrites. He was excommunicated, and dispossessed of all his dominions except Weffex by the victorious faction, who placed Edgar his brother, a boy of thirteen, at their head, and proclaimed him king.

By his monkissi historians he is represented as a mighty conqueror, statesman, and even saint. But facts are totally wanting to sup port the first part of this character, and are copi ously furnissied to overthrow the last. As a proof of his power and magnificence, he is said to have been rowed in his barge on the river Dee by eight tribu tary princes of Wales, North-Britain, and the iles, denominated kings, who had been summoned toge ther to pay him homage. I consider the story, if not unfounded, at least exaggerated or misrepresent ed ; and, if true, a proof of pusillanimous arro gance and vanity. Doubtless, during his reign, his kingdom enjoyed an uncommon tranquility, whence he has obtained in history the epithet of the peace able ; a glorious title, if this peace had arisen from his formidable arrangements for defensive war, and his abstinence from aggression. But the real cause appears to have been a favourable concurrence of circumstances ; a situation of affairs abroad unapt for attempts on the Englissi territories ; and such a consolidation of strength at home by the arms of pre ceding monarchs, that its fame had deterred invasion in the distracted reign of Edwin. The wars of Edgar were waged against the de fenseless clergy of the secular species, for the eject ing of whom from their monasteries he united his whole power with the Benedictines. In a general synod, convened for this purpose in 969, he deli- vered"], [152, "leg HISTORY OF THE Chap, vered a forcible speech, probably composed by Dua_ v- slan, in which he opprobriously censured the seculars, and exhorted to vigorous efforts the Commissioners appointed to act against them, uttering, among many others, the following sentence _ \" Let us join sword to sword that these lepers may be cast out, that the sanctuary may be purged, and that men may minis* ter in the temple who can say to their parents, I knoio you not ; to their brethren, you are strangers to me.\" As Dunstan, who had been appointed archbissiop of Canterbury, after the death of Odo, was at the head of these commissioners, the persecution of the mar- ried clergy was not neglected. The king and th_3 primate so well understood one another that the for- mer gave loose reins to his passions, and the latter enjoined mock penances. Thus, when Edgar, forcing with armed men his way into a convent, car- ried thence a nun of noble birth, and violated her person, his penance was to build a monastery at the expense of his people, to persecute the married cler- gy, and to abstain for seven years from the wearing of his crown. The last article, the most specious, was in fact the farthest from, being a punissiment. If lie had been obliged to wear this cumbrous orna ment, not absolutely requisite for the pomp of roy alty, the penance would have been real. The history of Edgar's reign is in great part the history of his amours. In a visit at Andover he c!e i&anded the company of a nobleman's daughter dur* iflig the night. To save the lady's honour her mo ther substituted a female attendant. Darkness fa voured the deceit ; and the king was so pleased with hi."], [153, "V29 Chap, V BRITISH ILANDS. > his partner, that, without resenting the trick, he re tained her as his mistress until the occurrence of a more powerful object. This object was Elfrida, daughter and heiress of Olgar, earl of Devonssiire, whose sopereminent beauty was celebrated through out England. Edgar was enflamed by the report, and resolved, since her fortune was so great, to make honourable proposals, if her person should be found not inferior to her fame. Athelwold, his favourite nobleman, commissioned, under another pretence, to see Elfrida, diverted the king's intention by a false account, and afterwards by his interest obtained the lady for himself. Informed privately of the fraud, Edgar determined to have ocular proof by a visit to Athelwold's mansion. Contrary to her hus band's ardent request, Elfrida displayed her beauty to the greatest advantage, and the king was sired at once with love and resentment. He assassinated Athelwold and raised his widow to the throne. What Edgar might have been, if he had come to the crown at a maturer age, and free from monkissi thraldom, we are left to conjecture. From the ma- terials extant his character is dubious. In some acts we recognise a liberal policy ; but we know not whe- ther these were the offspring of his own reflexions or of Dunstan's, who, though he had taken a foul road to eminence, was a man of superior intellect. Commerce was protected, and foreigners, by kind treatment, were encouraged to visit and settle in England.

On the death of this unfor tunate prince all were again united under Edgar the peaceable, in whose reign we might suppose, from its partial records, the strength of the Englissi mo narchy, as well as the union of its parts, finally con solidated. But the appearance was fallacious : the government of monks is a system of debility : the resources cf the state were absorbed by the useless : the public mind was unnerved by superstition : and the safety of England was thus left to depend on the weakness of its neighbours, or their moderation, the latter of which is unknown in the policy of nations or societies of adventurers. That for the crimes or follies of a man his offspring often suffers is a re mark forced on us by the experience of history, the consideration of which ought not be without a ssiare of influence on our conduct. This was exemplified in the sons of Edgar, his successors, who were both unfortunate. The succession of the elder son Edward, appointed heir by his father, was disputed by Elfrida, who wished to raise to the throne her own son Ethelred, and by many nobles, who wished to free their coun try from the thraldom of the monks, to whose di rection Edward was resigned. But Dunstan, ever bold, prompt, and decisive, lost no time in assem bling his partizans, and fixing the crown on his fa vourite prince. Yet the opposers of Benedictine bondage attempted to restore the secular clergy, and the kingdom was violently agitated by the contest.

Thus at a synod, held in the old monastery of Winchester, when the majo rity appeared averse to his system, a determinatiun was prevented by a loud voice in his favour from a crucifix in the wall, and his own vehement excla mation that \" the affair was now decided by the di vine sentence.'' As the matter was still contested, a miracle more tremendous was contrived. A council was convened at Calne in Wiltshire, where to the ar guments of the nobles Dunstan replied ; \" 1 confess that 1 am unwilling to be overcome. I commit the cause of the church to the decision of Christ.\" In stantly the floor gave way, and, while the beam which supported the seat of Dunstan remained unmoved, the nobles were precipitated, many of them killed, many grievously wounded. Against a system of outrageous fraud, violent measures, including the king's assassination, were adopted by the party of Elfrida. In a hunt near Corse castle in Dorsetssiire, the residence of this queen, Edward rode alone, without suspicion, to the entrance, to pay his compliments, and to re quest a refressiing draught.

From a concurrence of circumstances, imper- fectly or but partially known, England had remain ed a long time unmolested by Danissi depredation. Early in the tenth century, Harald Harfragre, a Norwegian prince, had rendered himself master of all Norway, subduing or expelling the independent chiefs who had divided its government. A union of the country under one monarch was -favourable, to internal tranquility, which Harald endeavoured to protect by discouraging piratical enterprises. Wars were waged between this new monarchy and Den- mark, which appears also to have become united un- der one sovereign. An extensive province in the north of France had become a Scandinavian settle- ment, and served as a drain for emigrations from the countries around the Baltic. But the unmolested state of England seems chiefly aseribable to the idea entertained of its internal strength by foreigners, an idea excited by the victorious arms of Alfred, and confirmed by the successes of posterior monarchs, particularly Athelstan. To prove this unreal, since the foundations, on which it rested, were decayed, experiment only was wanting ; and, whether by chance or from information, experiments at length were made. In"], [160, "HISTORY OF THE 136 Chap VI ,980, 991 992, In -the year 980, seven or eight hundred Danes, arriving in an armament of seven ships, plundered Southampton and the ile of Thanet, and in the next, year committed ravages in Cornwall and Devonshire. When by this and other small expeditions the naked ness of the country was known, a greater force de barked at Ipswich and Suffolk in 991, and, marching south-westward to Maiden in Essex, defeated and flew Brithnoth, duke of that province. By the advice of Siric, the successor of Dunstan in the see of Can terbury, gold, instead of arms, was opposed to the invaders, whose departure, was purchased by the sum of ten thousand pounds ; a sum small in appearance, but great in reality, when we consider the comparative rates of money in those days and these. The levy. ing of this ransome is considered in old annals as the origin of the direct imposition of taxes in England, where an impost became regularly establissied under the denomination of Danegelt or Dane-money. Aroused by the well-grounded apprehension of invasions more formidable still, which would be en. ticed by such a bait, some nobles exerted themselves to procure the convention of a national council, in which was decreed the equipment of a powerful fleet for the destruction of hostile armaments. The com mand of this was given, in conjunction with another duke and two bissiops, to Alfric, duke of Mercia, who had been banished England, and by the interest of his friends restored; and who, disaffected to the court, where his enemies had influence, resolved to prevent such a re-establissiment of tranquility, or consolidation of the regal power, as might leave him independent"], [161, "BRITISH ILANDS. 137 Chap VI independent of the caprices of the monarch. When, therefore, a plan was formed to surround and des troy a Danissi fleet which had arrived on the eastern coast, Alfric sent private intelligence, and afterwards deserted with his particular squadron, to the enemy. The fleets, however, from East-Anglia and London attempted to put the plan in execution, met the re treating Danes, captured one of their vessels and the ships of Alfric ; but the traitor himself escaped. The king, who had now attained the age of twenty four, displayed his weakness, injustice, and cruelty. Algar, the son of Alfric, was deprived of sight for the crime of his father, who, notwitstanding a pro vocation calculated to render his disaffection indeli ble, was after some interval again restored to the Mercian government and the command of an Englissi army. Alfric was not the only recreant in this period of political imbecility. When to oppose a predatory armament, which had ascended the Humber, a body was assembled of Englissi troops, their three leaders, men of Danissi ancestry, left the victory to the in vaders by fl\\ing at the moment when the battle com menced. When the sovereign was weak and may be supposed to have been governed by worthless fa vourites, the court and nation rent by cabals, no effective or steady system of government, no reward expected for merit nor protection in loyalty, many seem to have chosen to depend for safety rather on a connexion with the foreign foe, and the continuance of a debility in the court, than on the performance of services for their king and country. Invited by so"], [162, "13S Chap VI Pvtore ft ous invi Gods. 991 HISTORY OF THE so defenseless a condition of the Englissi, two mo narchs embarked in person as leaders of a predatory armament ; Swein, king of Denmark, who, in the violent convulsions, to which the Scandinavian re gions were subject, had suffered exile, and been de nied admittance into England as a refugee; and Olaf, king of Norway, who, after a life of piratical adventure, had been raised to the throne, as a de scendant of Harald Harsragre, on the expulsion of a monarch styled Haco the bad. In the year 994 these monarchs entered the Thames, with a combined fleet of only ninety-four ssiips, which probably carried little more than nine thousand men, since we find from the Northern An- tiquities of Mallet, that in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the crews of Norwegian vessels exceeded not a hundred or a hundred and twenty each. Such was their contempt of the Englissi power, that with so small an army they laid siege to London, the me. tropolis. Frustrated in that attempt by the unassisted valour of the citizens, they endeavoured to compen- sate the disappointment by ravages in Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Hampssiire. Their further progress was prevented by a sum of sixteen thousand pounds, which they consented to accept as the price of their departure, On the receiving of hostages for his safety, Olaf made a visit to the court of Ethelred, and there underwent the ceremony of confirmation according to the rites of the christian church, to which he had been converted, in one of his piratical voyages, by a hermit in the iles of Scilly. The"], [163, "BRITISH ILANDS. 139 ClIA \\ : 995 Massacre of the Dane.. 1002, The predatory squadrons returned in 995 to the Baltic regions ; and Olaf, who, notwithstanding his habits of piracy, appears to have been actuated by a generous and heroic spirit, adhered faithfully to his promise never again to molest England. But in 997 the fleet of Denmark recommenced its ravages, which were con inued in this and the two following years. The desolating effects of this new invasion were extensively felt around the several rivers which were successively ascended by this armament ; the Severn, the Thamar, the Frome, the Thames, and the Medway. Armies and fleets were repeatedly col lected to repel or chastise the marauders ; but by the misconduct of commanders, from disaffection or incapacity, they were so delayed in their operations as to prove totally ineffective, or so discouraged or dis organized as to be driven into flight when they came to battle. Abortive equipments served only by their expense to aggravate the public misery. Yet when the Danes had returned home voluntarily to dispose of the spoil, with which they were encumbered, Ethelred, as if to display his talents as a warrior, employed his forces in a bloody devastation of the defenseless tracts of Cumbria and the lie of Man. By a war between Swein and Olaf, and an expedi tion to France, the arms of the Scandinavians were for a ssiort time diverted from England ; but in the year 1001 they repeated their visit, and received twenty-four thousand pounds, the third ransome of this country. In the following year Ethelred put in execution two projects which can hardly be considered as consistent parts"], [164, "MO Chap VI HISTORY OF THE parts of the fame plan. Having lost his first wise, he took the beautiful Emma for his second, a princess of Danissi blood, sister of Richard duke of Norman dy. Such a connexion with the sovereign of a Scan dinavian state might tend to conciliate the Danish depredators, or to fortify him against their violence. But all idea of conciliation must have been aban doned, and instead thereof the utmost exasperation expected, in the adoption of another project, the massacre of all the Danes inhabiting England. Ac cording to private orders from the king, received in every city on the preceding day, the Englissi rose at once against the intermingled Scandinavians, on Sun day, the thirteenth of November, the festival of St. Brice, and made a horrible butchery, without dis tinction of rank, sex, or age. Not even those were spared who were connected with the natives by the most endearing ties. Thus Gunhilda, the sister of Swein, who had married an Englissi earl, and vo luntarily adopted England for her country, was af ter the agonizing sight of her husoand and children butchered before her face, barbarously put to death, prophetically denouncing, in a paroxism of grief and resentment, the vengeance of her compatriots on the guilty nation. That the numerous people of Danish descent, whose ancestors had settled a century before in the Northumbrian, East-Anglian, and other ter ritories, were involved in this massacre, is totally improbable ; nor are we enabled from the obscure annals of those times to ascertain what description of Danes or what number, were the objects of this atrocious plan ; nor can we discover the motives of its"], [165, "HI Chap, \\1 invasions by Swein 1003 BRITISH ILANDS. its projectors, except the cruelty of cowards, who are apt to wreak their vengeance on the unarmed, while from the armed they ssirink with terror. To Scandinavians of recent settlement the plan of mas sacre seems to have been confined, who to serve the Englissi monarchs as mercenary troops, or on other accounts, had come to England, where they had confidentially fixed their abodes. Though a terrible tempest must now have been ex pected from Denmark, the vengeance of Swein for the murdered Gunhilda, and of his subjects for their countrymen, no effective provision for defense ap pears to have been made by Ethelred, who, from his being always unprepared, has been styled by his torians the unready. Swein in 1003, with an army thirsting for revenge and plunder, landing in the south-west of England, seized Exeter, betrayed to him by its Norman governor, and marked his pro gress through Devonssiire into Wilts with blood and conflagration. The traitor Alfric, already mention ed, to whose command the Englissi army had in this miserable reign been entrusted, feigned sickness, and declined the contest, at the instant when the two opposite hosts were advancing to a mutual charge ; by which his troops were so discouraged that they fled in disorder. In the following year devastation was brought into the eastern parts, where the city of Norwich fell, and where a brave, but unsupported, resistance was made by Ulfketul, duke of East-An glia. A horrible famine, the consequence of such warfare, obliged the Danes to retire from England : but they soon returned, and in 1006, by the ter- rors"], [166, "HISTORY OF THE 142 Chap VI rors of execution, extorted a fressi sine of thirty, Of according to other accounts, thirty-six, thousand pounds. The Englissi monarch appeared at length as if aroused into exertion. In 1008 his subjects were assessed for the furnissiing of ships and armour in proportion to their lands. From the proprietors of every three hundred and ten hides was demanded a ship for the royal navy, and from those of every eight hides a helmet and breastplate for a soldier of cavalry. Seven hundred and eighty-five armed ves sels, and above thirty thousand horsemen, are sup posed to have been thus ob ained. This, with the addition of infantry, the greatest force which England had then ever seen, was by the continued prevalence of diffidence and treachery rendered ineffective. To Alfric, who had died, Aedric Streon had succeeded in the dukedom of Ivsercia, in 1007, a man of low birth, an eloquent and plausible knave, a prime fa vourite of the king, who had even raised him to be the husband of his sister. This villain, who seems to have planned the ruin of his master, had been his chief instigator, under the massi of zealous loyalty, in the massacre of the Danes, particularly the mur der of Gunhilda and her family : and now his ma chinations frustrated the means provided for defense against the avengers of this bloodssied. At his in citement his brother Brihtric made a charge of trea son against Wulfnoth, a nobleman of Sussex ; who, sensible that his escape from the plots of men so powerful and malevolent was not otherwise possible than by flight, deserted to the enemy with twenty strips."], [167, "BRITISH ILANDS.

The magnitude of this and other sums, extorted Value of by the terror of the Danissi arms in the disgraceful thi_ period. reign of Ethelred, is very surprising, when we con sider what a pound was in this period, and what the price of money. A pound in money was at that time a real pound of silver ; and this pound, ac cording to the accurate statement of Doctor Henry, from the best original authorities, in his History of Britain, was less than a pound of what is called Troy weight by three quarters of an ounce of the latter. A pound then was equal in weight of silver to two pounds, sixteen shillings, and three pence of our present money. But, when we are informed, that the fine for the murder of a king was only two hundred and thirty pounds ; the fortunes of the great Alfred's three daughters only one hundred pounds each ; the purchase of an acre of the best land six teen pennies, or four shillings of our present coin ; the price of a good horse thirty-five of the same, of a ssieep only one, and of a man, as a stave, one pound of silver, we perceive a great scarcity and high value of the precious metals in that age. On a va riety of grounds we conclude that any quantity of silver had as much efficacy then as twenty times the fame"], [168, "1U HISTORY OF THE Chap, same quantity now ; and that the pecuniary pound of N L that period, since it contained almost three times the quantity of metal which our modern nominal pound contains, would purchase nearly as much as sixty pounds of our present money. The comparative cheapness of land, a good acre of which could be purchased for four ssieep, is a proof of thin popu lation, from which, with a scanty commerce, the difficuhy was augmented in the levying of any sum. From a combination of circumstances, every sum of a thousand pounds is supposed to have been levied with as much difficulty, and to have had as much in fluence in public affairs, as a hundred thousand at present. By this rule the last national ransome of forty-eight thousand pounds may be reckoned equi valent to near five millions of our present money ; and the five ransomes together of at least a hundred and twenty-eight thousand, paid in twenty years, to near thirteen millions. state of the By these general exactions, beside others which country. v/cre partial, and ravages more destructive still, the English were reduced to a most abject state of debi lity, which, together with their mutual diffidence and disunion, rendered their country an easy prey to the Danissi monarch, who was now resolved on its total conquest.

To oppose Canute, who returned to England in the following year, and, landing on the southern coast, overran the counties of Dorset, Wilts, and Somer set, large bodies of troops were assembled under the command of Aedric and prince Edmund, of whom the former by his treachery frustrated the whole plan of operation. On the discovery of a plot form ed against his life by Aedric, the prince fled, and the troops disoanded ; after which the traitor closed his deception for that time by deserting to the enemy with forty ships. , While the Danes were advancing toward the north-east, Edmund attempted with two successive armies to stop their progress. Of these the former dispersed in a panic, when the troops found that the citizens of London, remaining at home for the defense of their own habitation, had declined to join them. The latter, though much more potent, reinforced by these citizens, was also dissi pated without fighting, discouraged by the conduct of Ethelred, who, suspecting treachery, fled to London, unmoved by the most earnest entreaties of his son. Having in vain attempted to raise a third army in the northern parts, where Uhtred, earl of Northumberland, was constrained to submit to Ca nute, Edmund was obliged to take refuge in London, where he sound his father at the point of death.

His rei<m was ssiort, but replete with vigorous action. With forces inferior, but animated by his vehement exhortations and daring example, he fiercely opposed Canute, who was crowned at Southampton, and ad vanced against London with an army composed of Englissi and Danissi troops. A campaign ensued, perhaps never exceeded in the violence and obstinacy of exertion. Thrice in the one year was London besieged in vain by Canute, and five desperate bat tles fought with variety of success. In the second of these, at Scearstan in Glocesterssiire, Aedric exposed on a spear the head of Osmer, a man resembling Edmund in countenance, and called aloud to the troops of that monarch- that their king was slain; which diffused such panic, that all the efforts of their leader were unable to prevent their flight : but in his endeavours to rally he so far succeeded that Canute declined to renew the engagement, and retreated to wards London in the night.

In the fifth general battle, which was sought at Affandun in the north of Essex, when Canute was on the point of suffering a defeat, Aedric suddenly fled with all the troops under his command, .and gave thereby to the Danes a decided victory, with a lamentable slaughter of the Englissi, of whom almost all the estimable nobility fell. With invincible spirit and indefatigable activity Edmund assembled a new army in Glocesterssiire, prepared the sixth time to contend for the crown of his ancestors in a general engagement. But the adherents on both sides, deeply touched with the afflictions of so fierce a con test, prevailed on the contending princes to conclude an agreement for a division of England between them, in which they were to reign mutually independent, Canute in the north, Edmund in the south. The latter was soon after assassinated, in what manner precisely is not certainly known, but most probably by the contrivance of Aedric with Canute's appro bation. Master of England by force of arms, on the re moval of his only competitor, Canute yet chose to have his accession to the throne sanctioned by legal form. By the suborned deposition of some nobles an agreement was declared to have been made be tween Canute and Edmund, that, in case of the an tecedent death of the latter the former ssiould be his successor, or the guardian of his sons. Affecting to be fully convinced, the witena-gemot, or national assembly of nobles and ecclesiastics, at London in the year 1017, pronounced the Danissi monarch their legitimate sovereign. To prevent all opposi- tion"], [174, "HISTORY OF THE 150 Chap VI 1019 tion to the establissiment of his authority he at first rewarded with extensive governments those English chiefs who had assisted his elevation : but, when he found his throne once firmly fixed, he secured him self against the power and infidelity of those by their death or banissiment. Among the slain was Aedric, who, having reminded Canute of his great services, particularly the assassination of Edmund, was im mediately executed as the murderer of his king ; and his body was thrown into the Thames. The early part of this prince's reign was marked not only with blood, but with cruel rapacity. In 1018, for the rewarding of his followers, he extorted from London ten thousand five hundred pounds, from the rest of England seventy-two thousand ; sums enormous in that age in an impoverissied country. But when he thought the Englissi fully subdued, he took the best measures for their conciliation. With a display of confidence in the fidelity of his new subjects, he sent home the most of his Danissi forces, retaining only forty ships ; he restored the English laws in a national assembly : he abolissied all politi cal distinctions between Danes and English, to both of whom he administered justice with strictness and impartiality : and he married Emma, the widow of Ethelred, who, on the death of that king, had fled with her two sons to Normandy. The English w'ere pleased by their queen's restoration ; and the Norman duke, her brother, was conciliated by this alliance. Secure in the possession of England, Canute spent the winter of 1019 in Denmark.

In three years after, by the arms of the Danes and Englissi, and his intrigues with the Norwegians, he rendered himself master of Norway, driving thence its monarch, Olaus or Olaf, a prince unwarlike, but from his beneficence and piety denominated Saint Olave. Master at once of England, Denmark, and Norway, Canute is said, from his extraordinary suc cess and extensive dominion, whence he has obtain ed in history the title of great, to have been addressed by his flatterers as a superior being whom even the elements must obey ; to have, in confutation or derision of their flattery, placed him self in his chair of state, on the margin of the sea, at the rising of the tide ; to have, as monarch of the ocean, commanded the waves not to approach his robes ; and finally, when the flood had risen around him, to have called the attention of his courtiers to the insignificance of all human power. Impressed with just humility, and with repentance for violent acts committed in the beginning of his reign, this monarch became remarkably devout ; but, misled by the prevailing superstition, through the cloud of whose absurdity his unlettered intellect was unable to penetrate, he displayed chiefly his de votion in expending great sums, procured from the industry of his people, in the endowment of religi ous houses and in donations to ecclesiastics and to idle"], [176, "HISTORY OF THE 152 Chap VI 1031 1035 Reign of Harold Harefoot. 1035, jo3y, idle beggars. Of this complexion was his pilgri- mage to Pvome about the year 1031, in which he lavished more money than any preceding monarch ; but procured for his subjects an exemption from those imposts to which they had been liable in their journies to Italy as pilgrims or traders. Not how- ever exclusively relying on superstitious practices for the attainment cf divine forgiveness, he issued strict orders to all in authority under him to permit no injury to any pet ion whatsoever through their sear of himself or of any powerful man. The last poli- tical act recorded of him was his compromise with Malcolm, king of Scotland, who had refused to pay the tax of Danegelt for Cumberland, or to per- form homage for that province, as a feudal tenure under the Englissi monarchy. Intimidated by the march of a great Englissi army to his borders, Mal- colm agreed to put his grandson and heir, Duncan, immediately in possession of Cumberland, who ssiould perform the required homage, and that the same should be a duty to the future kings of Scotland. Canute expired in the November of 1035, about forty years of age, leaving three sons, bwein, Harold, and Hardicanute. The first, who had some years governed Norway, was, about the time of his father's decease, expelled by Magnus, the son of Saint Olave, and soon after died. To Hardicanute, the son of Emma, the succession ssiould have devolved by the settlement of marriage made with his mother ; but Harold, son of a former wife, surnamed Harefoot from his swiftness, taking au vantage of his brother's absence in Denmark, seized"], [177, "BRITISH ILANDS. 153 Chap VI Reign of Hardi Ca nute. 1039. 1011. seized the royal treasure, and laid claim to the crown. The party of Harold was espoused by the Danes ; of Hardicanute by earl Godwin and the English. To prevent a civil war an agreement was made to divide the kingdom. London and the coun ties on the north of the Thames were assigned to the former : all to the south of that stream to the latter. Emma fixed her court at Winchester, and brought from Normandy her two sons by Ethelred. Against these princes the jealousy of Harold was enfhmed by the archbissiop's conduct, who refused to give him the regal benediction, conceiving the children of Emma to have a superior right. With circumstances variously told, the elder of them, named Alfred, was treacherously intercepted by earl Godwin, who murdered almost all his retinue, said to be six hun dred in number, inhumanly deprived him of his eyes, and confined him in the monastery of Ely, where he soon after died. Emma and prince Ed ward effected their escape, the former to the earl of Flanders, the latter to the duke of Normandy. Harold became master of the whole kingdom, but expired in two years after, about the end of 1039. On intelligence of Harold's death, Hardicanute, who had arrived in Flanders from Denmark to assem ble an armament for the assertion of his right, failed immediately to England, where, without opposition, he was vested with the royalty. He soon gave a specimen of a ferocious heart by commanding the body of his predecessor to be taken from the grave, beheaded, and thrown into the Thames.

The rigour of taxation for the payment of Danissi forces caused a tumult at Worcester, in which two taxgatherers were slain. The town was destroyed ; but the inhabitants, whom the king had ordered to be exterminated, escaped by connivance to the iland of Bevery in the Severn, whence they afterwards returned, and rebuilt their city. The reign of Hardicanute was as ssiort as un popular. The strength of his constitution, whence he obtained the title of Hardy, was overpowered by his habitual intemperance ; and, after some pre monitory attacks on his health, he at length expired in the midst of a carousal at Lambeth, in 1041. Edward, the surviving son of Ethelred by Emma, who had, with his mother been generously recalled to England by his uterine brother, Hardicanute, was, on the decease of that monarch, elected king by the Englissi, chiefly by the power and influence of earl Godwin, who stipulated that Edward, as a pledge of his forgiveness of his brother's murder, ssiould marry Editha, the daughter of that earl. The Danes were in this revolution insulted, but with little bloodssied, as they made no opposition to this restoration of the old. Englissi line of monarchs. A blow severely felt by many of this race was a general resumption, by"], [179, "British ilands. 155 by which they were chiefly affected, of the grants Chap. made by the late monarchs from the royal patri- /[ mony. Beside this mode of replenissiing the royal coffers, Eaward seized the treasures of his mother, whom he confined in a monastery at Winchester, under the pretence of her having ssiewed little affec tion to him and his brother in comparison of Hardi canute. His want of complaisance to the fair sex was displayed in a still more extraordinary manner in his behaviour to Editha, his wise, who, though remarkably beautiful, amiable in manners, and high ly accomplistied even in literature, is said to have been permitted to remain a virgin all her life. This is by some attributed to his hatred of her father, but to an inviolable vow of chastity on a religious ac count by monkissi historians, who have highly ex tolled his superstitious devotion, and given him the title of faint and confessor. By the death of Hardicanute the kingdoms of His quarrel Denmark and England became finally disunited. The former was seized by Magnus, king of Norway, 105 1. who laid claim to England also, and made prepara- tions to enforce it ; but, finding that formidable fleets and armies were prepared to oppose him by earl Godwin and other chiefs, he wisely determined not to risk his domestic safety by a foreign enter prise. Inheriting the mental debility of Ethelred, but not his vices, Edward might not have been in condition to avert the designs of Magnus, if he had not come to the throne in a more fortunate situation of affairs than his father, when men of spirit and national attachment were his counsellors, when piracy had"], [180, "HISTORY OF THE 156 Chap VI had ceased among the Scandinavians, and when fac tion engaged the attention of their princes at home. Freed from the danger of invasion from the Baltic, England was yet, through the weakness of its mo narch, exposed to the evils of internal convulsion. Through the predilection of Edward for the inhabi tants of Normandy, among whom he had been edu cated, great numbers of that nation resorted to his kingdom, where, though the civil and military em ployments were mostly left in the hands of natives, the chief dignities of the church were conferred on Normans, whose manners, dress, and even language, became so fassiionable, that lawyers composed their legal writings in French. Jealous of these foreigners, who filled the court and influenced the government, many of the English declared their discontent, par ticularly Godwin, who found at length an occasion of open hostility. Eustace, count of Boulogne, husoand to a sister of Edward, had, in his return to France, from a visit made to the Englissi monarch, a sanguinary quarrel with the inhabitants of Dover, occasioned by an attempt of one of his attendants to force an entrance into a house assigned for his lodging. Both the as sailant and the master of the house were killed in the beginning of the fray, which quickly became gene ral between the count's retinue and the populace. The former fled, after the slaughter of about twenty on each side, without reckoning the wounded. En raged by the misinformation of the count, Edward commanded Godwin, within whose province Dover lay, to punissi the people of that town. The earl protested"], [181, "BRITISH ILANDS. 157 protested against a sentence of punissiment without Chap. previous trial, and assembled a numerous army on , 'j the borders of Wales, for the immediate purpose of repressing incursions from that quarter, but lat terly to crussi the Norman faction. Terrified by the news of warlike preparation, and the demand of Godwin to have Eustace and his followers delivered into his hands, the king, who was at Glocester, summ'oned to his assistance the great nobility, parti cularly Leofric, earl of Mercia, and Siward, earl of Northumberland. Godwin, who had neglected the opportunity of BaniiWn. overpowering the king by a rapid progress, found 10-. himself obliged, by the array of an opposite army, to agree to Leofric's proposal, that he ssiould submit the matter in dispute between him and his sovereign to the decision of a witena-gemot summoned to meet in London. Afterwards apprehensive of danger from the preponderance of his enemies in this assembly, he declined to attend it, in consequence of which a sentence of banissiment was pronounced against him self and his sons. Even the beautiful and innocent queen was by her ungallant husoand stripped of her effects and imprisoned in a monastery. The family of Godwin, all whose properties were confiscated, seemed at once precipitated into total ruin from an eminence little inferior to that of the sovereign. In the Netherlands, where he had taken refuge Hisreftor* with three of his sons, Godwin, who had formed tlon' alliances abroad, and had carried much treasure from England, prepared an armament to assert his rights.

Edward, perceiving that the F nglissi nobles would not support him in a civil war on this occa sion, condescended to an agreement with the exiled family. The Normans fled the kingdom in conster nation. Godwin and all his adherents were fully reinstated on his delivery of hostages for his fidelity to the king. This nobleman, who, though of ob scure or uncertain ancestry, had risen to a pitch of power incompatible with the condition of a subject, expired in the following year, 1053, in consequence of a sickness, with which he was suddenly seized as he fat at table with the king. By the banissiment of the Normans the princi pal subject of unpopularity was removed from Ed ward, who had in some respects rendered himself popular, particularly by the abolition of the odious tax of Danegelt about the year 1051. Godwin was succeeded in his vast possessions, and in the power ful office of steward of the household, by his eldest son Harold, his superior in mildness, courage, and address. The preponderant influence of this young nobleman was but feebly checked by that of Leofric, earl of Mercia, whose son, Algar, was appointed successor to Harold in the government of Essex and East-Anglia. Algar was twice banissied by powerful intrigues in 1055 and 1058; but effected his resto ration by invading the west of England with Danish forces collected in Ireland, joined by those of Gryf fyth, prince of Wales.

While the coasts of Wales were ravaged by a fleet under the immediate command of Harold, troops lightly armed for the purpose, under his bro ther Tostig, traversed the country in all directions with such slaughter and devastation, that the Welch, to free themselves from intolerable calamities, sent Gryffyth's head to Harold, and submitted to the government of two noblemen appointed by Edward. To restrain the incursions of this people in future a law was enacted, which condemned to the loss of his right hand every Welchman who ssiould be found, with a missile weapon, beyond Offa's dyke. Harold was freed from rivalry in power by the deaths of Leofric, Algar, and Siward. The last expired in the manner of his Danissi ancestors, equipped with defensive and offensive arms, and la menting that he ssiould have survived so many battles to perist like a cow. Tostig, Harold's brother, who was constituted successor of Siward in the earldom of Northumberland, so enraged the inhabitants by his cruelties, assassinations of their nobles, and gall ing exactions, that they expelled him by a general insurrection in 1065, seized his treasures, and elected Morcar, the son of Algar, in his place.

In two years after this the countries now called Sa voy and Dauphine were reduced into a Roman pro vince, or Provincia, whence is derived the modern appellation of Provence, a country soon after included within the Roman jurisdiction. The renowned Ju lius C\u00e6sar, having, fifty-seven years before the chris tian a_ra, been appointed to the command of this province, made in eight years a complete conquest of all the warlike, but disunited, tribes of France from the Rhine to the ocean. He found this exten sive region inhabited by three distinct races of men, different in origin, language, customs, and laws, the Celts, the Belgians, and the Aquitanians, each composed of several small nations. During four centuries and a half the yoke of Ro man government oppressed and civilized the people of Gallia or France, who, in course of time became so Romanized, that the greater part of them forgot their vernacular dialects, and adopted the Latin lan guage. The separation of this country from the empire of Rome we may date from the year 407 of the christian \u00e6ra, when armies of Goths, under va rious denominations, crossed the Rhine into the Gallic territories, without afterwards retreating from the invaded country. Among the tribes who ra vaged and settled in that part of Europe the Franks were ultimately the predominant nation. This peo ple;, from whom the country received its present name, appears to have originated from a voluntary union of many tribes, who denominated themselves Franks, a term denoting freemen. The founder of the"], [187, "BRITISH ILANDS. 163 Chap VII the French monarchy was Clovis, who succeeded in the year 481, at the age of fifteen, to the command of a Frankissi tribe denominated Salians, dwelling in the territories of Tournay and Arras, unable to furnissi an army of more than five thousand men. At the age of nineteen he commenced his military career, and, in the course of his exploits other Prankish tribes crowded to his standard, he found himself master of almost the whole of ancient Gaul before his death, which happened in 511. His four sons, among whom his territories were divided, com pleted the conquest of modern France before the end of the year 532. The dominion was afterwards united under one monarch, but the posterity of Clovis became so de generate as to obtain in history the title of lazy kings . rendering themselves mere cyphers of state, while the administration of the realm devolved on the mayor of the palace who was steward of the house hold. This office became hereditary ; and Pepin the ssiort, the last who held it, mounting the throne by an almost blameless usurpation, added to the power the title of king in 751. Thus to the first line of monarchs, bearing thenames of long haired and Me rovingian, succeeded the second, denominated the Carlovingian race. After the death of Charlemagne, or Charles the great, the second of this line, in 814, the reader of the French history is apt to turn in dis gust from the dark and perplexed annals of the suc ceeding reigns, disti acted by the inroads of Norman pirates, domestic diisentions, and feudal anarchy. The heads of a noxious aristocracy, the holders of M 2 great"], [188, "1C4 Chap. VII. Settlement of Nor- mandy, HISTORY OF THE great fiefs, grew into a power totally incompatible with public tranquility : the royal demesnes and au thority were almost annihilated, and the constitution was rent between the extremes of despotism and anarchy ; despotism in the fiefs and anarchy in the state. To remedy these intolerable disorders, the no bles and clergy, at the decease of Lewis the fifth, the last king of the Carlovingian dynatty, elected Hugh Capet, the possessor of the most powerful fief, who, ascending the throne in 987, gave commencement to the third line of monarchs, that of the Capets, who retained the crown eight hundred years, till the great revolution which commenced in 1787. In the Merovingian dynasty the succession had been hereditary ; in the Carlovingian it was under stood to be elective, but the choice was confined to the family of Charlemagne, and the succession pro ceeded nearly as if hereditary. In the dynasty of the Capets hereditary right was fully established in the line of primogeniture ; but females by tacit custom, not by Salique or Salian laws, as has by some been supposed, were excluded from the throne. The nobility long retained their despotism in the fiefs, and the king had little more preponderance among them than what arose from the superior force of his patrimonial estates. The establissiment of a Scandinavian colony in France, and its subsequent connexion with England, were attended with conse quences of great importance to both kingdoms, more especially the latter. The forced conversion of the Saxons to Christi anity by Charlemagne, effected by the horrors of devastation"], [189, "BRITISH ILANDS. 165 Chap VII. devastation and slaughter, had caused an emigration of the fiercest pagans from the German territories to the more northern countries about the Baltic, and an excitement there of an atrocious spirit of pirati cal adventure, which proved a plague to his succes sors. Their fleets had begun to infest the French coasts even before the death of this renowned con queror, who wept from a foresight of the miseries destined for posterity. The reputation, however, of Charlemagne contributed with other causes long after his decease to protect the country in a considerable degree : but the weakness occasioned by intestine quarrels at length encouraged the Scandinavians or Northmen, denominated Normans by the French, to carry havock and conflagration far into the in. terior parts, even to the capital, of which in 845 they gained possession, and for the ranfome of which they received a great sum. Among the greatest and last of the Normans who infested France was a leader named Rolfr by Scandi navian writers, by the French Rollo, concerning whose origin and early transactions we find accounts widely different. From the Scandinavian writings of Snorre Sturleson he appears to have been a Nor wegian, banissied by Harald Harfragre, who inter dicted piracy. Determined to draw, if possible, ad vantage from misfortune, Rollo collected a body of adventurers, and made an attempt on England, whence, repulsed by the arrangements of the great Alfred, he proceeded to France. So dreadful were his reiterated ravages in that kingdom, and so weak was its administration, that its monarch, Charles the simple,"], [190, "165 Chap, VII Decline of piracy, HISTORY OF THE simple, in 911, proposed, as the only expedient for relief, to entice the Northmen into a treaty of peace and alliance by the cession to them of extensive ter ritories. To the Norman pirates was assigned the great province of Neustria, which assumed from its new masters the name of Normandy ; and, for a closer consolidation of the alliance, Gisla, the king's daughter, was given in marriage to their leader, with additional territories as her dowry. As the owner of a fief under the French monarchy, Rollo was re quired by feudal custom to pay homage to the king, and in an humble posture at his majesty's feet to ac knowledge his obligations. He positively refused ; but with difficulty assented to the vicarious perfor mance of the humiliating ceremony by one of his officers. Indignant at his appointment to such a task, the officer, under pretence of raising the king's foot to his mouth to kiss it, overturned him amid a mul titude of spectators, to the great, but unresented, mortification of the court. Much more advantage ously than in predatory warfare, Rollo, who lived till the year 931, displayed his extraordinary talents in the arts of peace. By his wise and steadily sup ported arrangements Neustria revived from its state of desolation, and its colony of Scandinavian free booters gradually subsided into a civilized people, adopting the religion, language, and manners of the French, with whom they were intermixed. This Norman settlement in France contributed, by the preclusion of a principal channel, to the decay of Scandinavian piracy. To the downfal of this pest several causes operated, as the prevalence of a commercial"], [191, "BRITISH ILANDS. 167 commercial spirit, the propagation of christian doc- Chap. trines, and an encreasing sense of the advantage re- suiting from the arts of peace. Since even to cor- sairs some traffic was necessary for the disposal of their plunder, by the same persons were oft exer- cised the piratical and commercial occupations. As the dangers of an infested navigation enhanced the profits on merchandize, men were excited by hopes of gain to brave every peril, and to arm for despe- rate encounter with the robbers of the sea. Asso- ciated with arms and valour, the profession of a mer- chant rose into honourable estimation. That of a pirate sank in proportion, insomuch that the bards of the Scandinavians began to brand it with infamy. Actuated by generous feelings, a new species of navi- gators arose, Knight-errants of the deep, whose ob ject was to seek the pirates on that element, and ex- terminate the race. After the end of the tenth cen tury we find little mention of piratical adventure in discriminately practiced. The conquest of England by the Northmen under Canute removed the last: great object of Scandinavian rapacity : and the firm establissiment of legal governments in the different countries effected at length its total suppression. One of the most firmly establissied governments claims of was that of Normandy, where reigned, contempo- man duke rary with Edward the confessor, William, son of \\\"^ Robert, the fifth duke from Rollo. William was illegitimate, born of Harlotta, a daughter of Full bert, who was an officer of the duke's houssiold, or, as others have recorded, a tanner in Falaise. Des tined, as the only son of Robert, to be his successor in"], [192, "108 Chap. VII. v-^V^^ HISTORY OF THE in the dukedom, he was vested with that dignity at the age of eight by his father, who in 1033 entered on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, under an apprehen sion, which was afterwards realized, that he soould not live to return. Advantage was taken of the weakness attending a minority by nobles who aimed at independence, competitors who claimed the ducal throne, and the king of France, Henry the first, who wissied to bring Normandy into subjection. The wisdom and integrity of the young duke's guardians upheld, by great exertions, the tottering state, till himself in mature years, displayed such abilities in council and in arms, as effectually re-establissied the ducal power, and tranquility of the people. The necessity of this early exercise of his talents laid the foundation of his future greatness, and his experi. ence of the salutary effects resulting from a rigorous administration of justice, after the reduction of a turbulent nobility, confirmed into a settled habit the natural severity of his temper. Conscious of his great endowments, and fired with the ambition of a more exalted rank among poten tates, William turned his view to the monarchy of England, where Edward, a childless prirfce, attached to him by consanguinity, and gratitude for the kind ness experienced in the Norman court, might be in duced to adopt and appoint him his successor. Em ma, the mother of Edward, was aunt to the father of William, who, however, bore no relation by blood to the Saxon line of Englissi monarchs. In the time of Godwin's banishment, the duke made a visit to the court of England, where he found a most respectful"], [193, "BRITISH ILANDS. 169 respectful and cordial reception ; but whatever ar- Chap. VII rangements were concerted between him and the king to favour the attainment of his object, the latter some time afterwards resolved on the appointment of another heir, influenced perhaps by the well known attachment of the Englissi to the royal blood of the Saxon line, and their aversion to the Normans. On the death of Edmund Ironside, his two infant sons, Edwin and Edgar, had been sent away by Ca nute to Denmark, as some fay, as others, to Sweden, with the design of their assassination. To Sweden, however, they were conveyed, perhaps by the hu manity of their conductor; and, by the humairty of the Swedissi monarch, they were thence trans mitted to the court of Solomon, king of Hungary, where they were preserved and educated. The elder died childless, but Edward was married to Agatha, daughter of the emperor of Germany, Henry the second, and sister to Solomon's queen, and had by her a son and two daughters. In 1057 he arrived in England with his family, invited by the king, for the purpose of his inheriting the crown as rightful heir. His death, in about a month after his arrival, and the tender age and slender capacity of his son Edgar, surnamed Atheling, a term denoting royal blood, left the succession still open to the hopes of the Norman duke. The important point remained undecided till the decease of king Edward the confessor, in the Janu- !066. ary of 1066, when William's great competitor, Ha rold, son of Godwin, immediately assembling the council, seized the crown, and was, on the day suc- ceeding"], [194, "HISTORY OF THE 170 Cha? VII ceeding that of the late monarch's departure, anoint. ed king, with the loud approbation of the citizens of London, and the at least tacit consent of the nation in general. This nobleman, brother to Edward's queen, and son to a niece of Canute the great, had, after his father's death, drawn to himself the whole of the exorbitant power possessed by the several branches of his family, and had determinately fixed his views on the attainment of the heirless diadem. He had so conducted public affairs as to make the reign of a very weak prince most happy to his sub. jects ; and seems to have been altogether worthy of the crown by the superior brightness of his political and military talents, his inflexible courage, genero sity, and humanity, beside a dignified gracefulness and popularity of manners, a flow of eloquence, and a great strength of body. Harold asserted that the crown had been bequeath ed to him by Edward : William declared a like be quest in his own favour : no proof was produced on either side : but that Harold had once taken a solemn oath to assist William in his design of ascending the Englissi throne was regarded by the latter as a deci sive argument in his favour. From the reciprocal contradiction of records this transaction is involved in impenetrable obscurity. Harold had been driven by a tempest on the coast of France, in the territory of Guy, count of Ponthieu ; but we are unable de cisively to discover whether he had sailed on a party of pleasure ; or with a commission from the king to inform the duke of the appointment of the latter to the inheritance of the Englissi crown ; or en busi- ness"], [195, "BRITISH ILANDS. 171 ness of his own, to procure the release of a brother Chap. and a nephew, who, in the pacification between the VI1 king and Godwin, had been given as hostages to the former, and by him sent for secure custody to the Norman court. Harold was ungenerously imprisoned by Guy in the expectation of an exorbitant ran som; but was released at the duke's requisition, who brought him to his court, promised him his daugh ter in marriage, with other great advantages, on con dition of his assistance, and received from him an oath to that purpose, on an altar, under which had been secretly conveyed by the duke some relics of the most revered martyrs, to render the obligation more awfully sacred. Harold, when he seized the crown, denied the obligation of an oath imposed by force, annulled by a later request of Edward, and adverse to the rights of the Englissi nation, v/ho had chosen him their monarch. Both parties prepared to decide by the sword ; but the new king of Eng land was assailed by other competitors, whose at tempts, though defeated, were the chief cause of his ruin. Tostig, Harold's brother, who had been expelled Norwegian from Northumberland, as is related in the preceding chapter, had retired to the court of Baldwin, earl of Flanders, to whose daughter he had been mar ried. Actuated by a spirit of the most fell resent ment against his brother, this exiled nobleman, allied by affinity to the Norman duke, who was also married to a daughter of earl Baldwin, strained every nerve to stimulate and assist the ambition of William. Himself, as the precursor of the Norman, having"], [196, "HISTORY OF THE 172 Chap. VII * . ' having collected an armament of sixty sail, laid Wight under contribution, harassed by depredation the southern coast of England as far as Sandwich, and, entering the Humber, committed spoil on its ssiores ; but on the approach of an army, by which he was repulsed, he fled thence to Scotland with twelve soips. Determined on revenge, by whatso ever means attainable, he some time after joined the forces of Haralld Hardrada, king of Norway, who, with a fleet of from three to five hundred fail, was proceeding, unconnected with the Norman candi date, to attempt the conquest of England for him self. Tostig and the Norwegian monarch entered the Humber, and advanced to the city of York, where, on the twentieth of September, after a most bloody contest, they totally defeated an Englissi ar my, hastily assembled, under the brothers Edwin and Morcar, the former earl of Mercia, the latter of Northumberland. The victorious troops were stop ped in their career on the twenty-fifth, at Stamford bridge, by the arrival of king Harold, who had or dered his fleet and army from the southern coast against these invaders. Detailed accounts, some of them accompanied with extraordinary and doubtful circumstances, are given of the battle fought on this occasion, which on the whole amount appears to have been one of the most obstinate and bloody re corded in the annals of any people. Tostig and Haralld Hardrada were slain, with almost their whole army. Their fleet also fell into the hands of the Englissi; but king Harold generously permitted a few ships to return home with prince Olaf, son of the"], [197, "BRITISH ILANDS. 173 Chap. VII. Invasion of the Nor- man dufee. lOtJd. the deceased Haralld, who afterwards reigned in Norway. This expedition of Harold, though attended with success completely decisive on that side, left his king- dom quite open on another to an invasion from Nor- mandy, which had place in three days after the great victory at Stamford. William had made every pos- sible exertion for the attainment of his object. Af- ter a hopeless embassy to Harold, requiring the soj- rendry of the crown, he had, by submitting the jus- tice of his cause to the Pope's arbitration, an arbi- tration declined or neglected by his opponent, acqui- red what in those dark ages was of no small conse- quence, the sanction of the sovereign pontiff; who, ready to seize every opportunity of augmenting his political power, and hoping to acquire a more abso- lute dominion over the church of England, pronoun- ced the Englissi monarch a perjured usurper, excom- municated with him all his adherents, encouraged volunteers of all nations to assist the duke, and sent him a consecrated banner, with a ring containing one of Saint Peter's hairs. He had by extraordi- nary address not only engaged in his party several owners of great fiefs in France, whose interests ap- peared incompatible with his further exaltation ; but had also prevailed on the nobles of his own dutchy to adopt his cause with ardour ; though they had at first been, with good reason, quite unwilling to raise exorbitant sums for an enterprize which might pro- bably be pernicious to the state, and to perform, contrary to their feudal rights, military service in a foreign country. His unremitting and strenuous ef- forts"], [198, "HISTORY OF THE 174 Chap, VII forts were powerfully seconded by his high reputa tion as a general and statesman, by which men eager for misitary adventure, at that time numerous and destitute of any other great object, were induced to flock with confidence to his standard. The empe ror of Germany, Henry the fourth, so far espoused his cause, as to engage for the defense of Normandy, if it ssiould, in his absence in England, be attacked by any potentate. But all the abilities of William, exerted to the ut most, would in all probability have ultimately failed, if he had not been favoured by a concurrence of circumstances, which cannot be accounted other than extraordinary. Beside the general state of Europe convenient to his views, the king of France, Philip the first, who must have been otherwise indu ced by the manifest interest of his crown to prevent the duke's aggrandizement, happened to be a minor, influenced by the earl of Flanders, regent of the kingdom, so closely allied, by his daughter, to William. Conan, duke of Brittany, who had, with a fierce determination of preventing his enterprize, declared war against him, died in the critical mo ment, and was succeeded by Hoel, a fast friend of the Norman, who formed with him a firm alliance and sent, to assist him in his English expedition, five thousand of his best soldiers, under his son, Alan Fergant. If William, whose preparations were com pleted in the end of August, had been able to indulge his ardour for entering immediately on the execu tion of his plan, he must have been intercepted by the fleet of Harold, superior in force, stationed at Wight"], [199, "BRITISH ILANDS. 175 Chap VII. Wight to oppose him : and if, contrary to probabi lity, he had gained the advantage in the naval com bat, he would afterwards have found a formidable army embattled on the ssiore to resist his landing ; while the whole force of England was commanded by Harold ; the king of Scotland was his friend ; and the Welch were obedient to the governors whom he had assigned them. But by adverse winds his ar mament was prevented for a month from sailing, till the critical time, when the Englissi forces, drawn to the north against the king of Norway, of whose expedition he was ignorant, had left both sea and land quite open to his enterprize ; while the troops of Harold, though victorious, were diminissied and ssiattered by a desperate conflict, and were obliged to undergo the fatigues of a long march before they could engage the invading host. Perhaps in all his tory we could not find another instance of a state being so formidably assailed by two separate powers, not acting in concert, within so ssiort a space of time. With an army of sixty thousand, of whom a great proportion, some say fifty thousand, were cavalry, and a fleet variously stated, but probably composed of about a thousand ships, William sailed, on the twenty-seventh of September, from Saint- Vallery at the mouth of the river Somme, and landed safely on the following day at Pevensey in Sussex. He is reported, on very dubious authority, to have, on his going on ssiore, accidentally fallen to the ground, and to have interpreted the fall into a good omen, as he thereby seemed to take possession of the land. Sq"], [200, "175 HISTORY OF THE Chap. So far successful in his daring enterprize, he acted y '\u25a0 with deliberate circumspection, erecting fortifications at Pevenfy and Hastings, to secure his fleet, and per- haps a retreat, if fortune ssiould prove adverse. With a magnanimity not often exemplified, he or dered some spies, who had been sent by Harold, and were detected in his camp, to be courteously treated and dismissed in safety, after being conducted through the army, that they might be convinced of its formi. dable strength. As if he had not come to fight against the nation, but to maintain a personal quar\u00bb rel with Harold, he sent a monk with a challenge to that monarch to decide their difference by single combat. Brave to temerity as an officer, but ac quainted with the prodigious personal strength and dexterity of his challenger, Harold had the prudence to decline the offer. If he had acted with equal pru dence in other points, he might probably have esta- blished himself immoveably on the throne, with the disgrace or total ruin of his Norman rival. Informed at York of the Norman debarcation, Harold lost no time in marching to the south ; but from an ill-timed parsimony, perhaps occasioned by an unwillingness to impose new taxes, he so offended his troops, by withholding from them the spoils of the Norwegian camp, that his army, diminissied by slaughter, became still further diminissied by deser tion. By manning his fleet with the design, as if he were sure of victory, to intercept the duke's retreat, he made another diminution of his force on land his only bulwark then against the foe.

But, perhaps too highly elat ed by his recent victory, perhaps apprehensive of dangerous intrigues with the Englissi clergy in case of delay, he advanced with precipitation to a deci sive battle, the immediate object of his adversary's wishes, the spirit of whose army would have evapo rated, and strength decayed, in a train of protract ed and tedious operations. Leaving London in six days after his arrival, without waiting for the troops who were hastening to join him from the several counties, he marched rapidly to Hastings, the station of the Normans, perhaps with a hope which he soon found vain, of surprising his rival. On the thir teenth of October in the evening, the Norman and Englissi armies faced each other near Hastings, and, preparing for a general engagement, they both passed the night under arms, but in different ways, which marked the superior manners of the Normans. These applied their leisure time to acts of devotion ; the Englissi to feasting, drinking, and clamorous mirth. The army of William was far more numerous than that of Harold. It was also far superior in tac tics and in arms.

The English, furnissied with great pointless swords, not otherwise uniformly arm ed, but mostly bearing the ponderous battle-axe, seem to have had only one advantage, that of their position, which, if they had observed a steady disci pline, might have counterbalanced all the superiority of the foe. Deficient in cavalry, and unfit to meet his rival in the plain, Harold wisely resolved to act on the defensive in the approaching battle, and chose for his post a rising ground, so ssiirted with wood as to enable him to prevent an attack on his rear or flanks. Ordering his horsemen to dismount, he formed his whole army, on the level in which the rising ground ended above, in one phalanx of infan try, uniform and dense, covered throughout with their shields in mutual contact. The royal standard stood displayed on the spot where Battle-abbey was afterwards built, and himself with his two brothers took his station near it. William, whom obvious interest prompted to quick decision, having received the sacrament, harangued his men, and hung about his neck the relics on which Harold had sworn, advanced to the attack with his army formed in three lines, the first, composed of archers with long and cross bows, the second of heavy-armed foot, the third of cavalry, the main strength of his host. The song of Roland, a hero of French romance, is said"], [203, "BRITISH ILANDS. 179 Chap VII. said to have resounded from the French auxiliars of the Normans, till the fight commenced with the cry of \" God be our help \" on the side of William, \" the Holy cross \" on the side of Harold. To the galling ssiowers of arrows the Englissi, un provided with such instruments of war, could only oppose with patience the defense of their shields ; but the nearer approach of the foe on the acclivity was repelled with darts, lances, and great stones preci pitated from wooden scaffolds. Commanding his cavalry to advance in five divisions, flanked with in fantry, William charged the phalanx with the whose force of his army ; but was so far from breaking the ranks of the Englissi, that, after a desperate en counter, hand to hand, his left wing, composed of the troops from Brittany and other auxiliars, was driven to flight ; and as a rumor was at the fame time propagated that himself w,is killed, the rest of his army was on the point of following their example. Aroused to extreme energy by the magnitude of his danger, he russied among the flying troops without his helmet, threatening, imploring, exhorting, and reminding them that, blockaded by Harold's fleet, they could by no ether means than victory escape the doom of death or bondage. Having succeeded in his efforts to rally the fugitives, he perceived a great advantage from rhis partial discomfiture ; as some thousands of Englissi', impelled by their ardour to pursue a flying enemy, had abandoned their ad vantageous post, and were thus exposed to be sur rounded aud put to slaughter. The N 2"], [204, "HISTORY OF THE 180 Chap VII The charge was renewed with the fame vigour as at first on the remaining Englissi, who still main tained their post and order of the phalanx, but without success, till a body of cavalry, by the duke's command, enticed, by a feigned flight, great num bers from their ranks into a delusive pursuit to the plain, where they met their destruction. The main body, however, continued to present an impene trable front to the efforts of the Normans, who though they again put in execution the fame strata gem with a further havoc of the deluded English, found the battle, which had raged from nine o'clock in the morning, still undecided near the close of day. The phalanx appeared still firm and infran gible, though much diminissied in number, and se verely annoyed by ssiowers of arrows, which, by the duke's order, were ssiot aloft in such a manner as to descend like hail on the heads of the Englissi, whose footmen appear to have not been furnissied with hel mets. By an arrow, ssiot in a different manner which pierced through the eye into the brain, Harold fell dead, who had all the day performed great deeds of valour. Struck with consternation on this calamity, the Englissi at length gave way, and fled through the openings of the woods. As the Normans pursued them beyond the woods, through broken ground, where had once stood a camp, disadvantageous to cavalry, a part of the fugitives rallied, and renewed the combat with such slaughter, that the duke was earnestly advised to retreat.

In this most memorable contest, fifteen thousand, among whom were many nobles, are stated to have fallen on the side of the Normans ; but the loss of the Englissi, which must have been greater, is quite un known. The battle of Hastings, and the duke's prepara- TaPest,7 \u00b0l tions for his descent on England, with previous transactions between him and Harold, are represented in a curious monument, still preserved in the town of Bayeux in Normandy, in the cathedral. This, called the Tapestry of Bayeux, consists of one piece of linen, two hundred and twelve feet in length, almost two in breadth, in which the figures of men, horses, and other objects, without symmetry or just proportion, not unlike those which are seen on China ware, are worked in the manner of samplers in worst ed. Tradition ascribes the performance to Matilda, the consort, perhaps grand daughter of William. An engraved copy of it is given by the Academy of inscriptions, and in the Anglo-Norman antiquities of Ducarel. To William the victory of Hastings might have state of proved as detrimental as that of Stamford-bridge had already proved to Harold, if Harold had survived his defeat, or an able successor had been ready to ascend the vacant throne ; since, ssiattered by the conflict, enfeebled by a sickness which quickly suc ceeded, destitute of magazines, and prevented by a blockading fleet from receiving supplies from the continent, the Norman army might have been over- powered"], [206, "1S\u00a3 Chap VII Progress of William. 1066 HISTORY OF THE powered by a superior force which could soon have been assembled, or consumed by the miseries of toil and famine. But the brothers of Harold, Gurth and Leofwine, had both fallen with him in the fatal field. No heir with plausible pretensions remained but Edgar Atheling, a youth neither by years nor capacity qualified, at such a crisis, for the regal function. Yet him alone, without the necessary ap pointment of a protector during his minority, were the nobles inclined to elect, influenced by most un seasonable jealousy toward men of their own order. Disgusted by this conduct, the two most potent earls Edwin and Morcar, who had aspired to the crown, brothers of Harold's queen, retired into Northum berland, with design to act according to events. Thus unhappily distracted, without a leader, and without a plan, the nation lay open to the attempts of a most enterprising potentate, who would neglect no occasion or means of success. Sensible of his critical situation, and the necessity of dispatch and vigorous proceedings, William ad. vanced as soon as possible to Romney, whose inha bitants he severely punissied for their cruel treatment of some Normans, who, by mistake or violent winds, had been brought into their harbour. Thence he marched to the attack of Dover, a post, from its strength and position, sit for keeping open a commu . nication with the continent, and dangerous if left behind in the hands of his enemies.

On his approach to the capital, where a numerous army had assembled, but without a directing head, a sally made by a large body of troops was repulsed by his vanguard of about five hundred cavalry, and all the buildings on the southern side of the Thames, forming the borough of Southwark, were involved in conflagration. As the city was defended on that side by the river, he directed his march westward to Wallingford, where he crossed the stream, and thence turned eastward, along its northern bank, to the great object of at- tack. Meanwhile the prelates and other dignified clergy, wiiiiam'i chiefly French or Normans, introduced by Edward _ r \" the confessor, men of influence by their superior 1066> learning, had declared in favour of William's title, which had been so strenuoufly sanctioned by the Pope. Well calculated to add strength to their ar guments in his favour was the conduct of the duke, who operated at once by terror and conciliation ; the rigours of sword and fire to those who resisted ; con descension and kindness to those who submitted. Of the latter an instance had been given at Dover, where the owners of some houses, fired by his soldiers, had been compensated for their losses.

After the strictest precautions, by fortresses and garrisons, for his security against any disaffection of the citizens, he was crowned in Westminster-abbey, on the christmas-day of 1066, by Aldred, archbi. ssiop of York, who previously administered the usual oath of coronation, and demanded aloud from the Englissi nobility whether they accepted William as their king, while the fame question was proposed to the Norman nobles by Goisfred, bissiop of Cou. tance. As these questions were answered in the as. firmative with joyful shouts, which were repeated, with perhaps augmented vociferation, at the placing of the new monarch on the throne, the Norman sol . diers, who had been stationed as guards on the out side, imagined from such tumultuous exclamation that attempts were made by the Englissi on the life of William.

Even William is said to have been terrified by the hideous uproar, which was not without great diffi culty quieted, and which, from such a symptom of national animosity, was regarded as ominous of an unhappy reign. Diffident perhaps, till his fortresses should have been completed, of his safety in London, whose in habitants this incident was not fitted to conciliate, William removed his court to Barkham in Essex, where the rest of the English nobles, even Edwin and Morcar, made their submissions, were graciously received, and confirmed in their estates and digni ties. By the treasures of Harold, of which he gain ed possession, by gifts from wealthy persons in all parts of England, who courted his favour, and by the confiscated estates of those who had fought against him at Hastings, he was enabled to make such lar gesses to his troops as contented them for the pre sent, without any great displeasure to his new sub jects.

From his im partial conduct in other respects, in the commence ment of his reign, the Englissi were soothed with the flattering hope, that from this new change in the regal succession little or no detriment would arise to their political system. But subsequent events furnifl an example, one of the most momentous and awful recorded"], [212, "HISTORY OF THE 188 Chap, VIII Revolts, 1067 recorded in history, of the dismal consequences at tendant on the misconduct of a nation in surrender ing itself into the absolute power of a foreign leader at the head of a foreign army of expectant adven turers. The lands as yet confiscated no further sa tisfied the followers of William, than as they were regarded as an earnest of the extensive confiscations, with which they had hoped to be enriched, when they first embarked in the arduous enterprise. While thus the estates of the defenseless natives were viewed as their destined prey by foreign troops, masters of the country, only restrained by the authority of their chief, who himself had displayed to their imaginations the spoils of England as the incentives of adventure, the state of Englissi property must be considered as altogether precarious. So early after his coronation as the March of 1067, William made a visit to his continental dominions, bringing with him all the chief of the Englissi nobles, under the specious pretext of giving them an honour able participation in the pleasures of his court, but in reality for the purpose of securing their persons from being leaders of malcontents in his absence. We are unable to discover at this time with certain ty whether the motive of this premature voyage was the vanity of displaying in France the pomp of a court aggrandized by the acquirement of a kingdom, or a concealed design of leaving an opportunity for his Norman troops to irritate the Englissi into unsuc cessful revolts, which might furnissi an excuse for more ample forfeitures, and a deeper establissiment of his power. While the Englissi nobles in the court of"], [213, "BRITISH ILANDS. 189 Chap, VIII 1063 of William were, in mutual emulation, exhibiting for the gratification of their new sovereign, a splen dour of equipage and riches, which excited surprise and envy in his continental visiters, his officers in England were by insults and oppression, even lawless expulsion from their lands, driving the natives to insurrection, unprotected by the two chief governors, left in charge of the administration, Odo, his uterine brother, bisoop of Bayeux, and William Fitzosoern, the chief justiciary. The inhabitants of Kent, who had been the fore most in submission, were the foremost in revolt, ma king an unsucessful attack on Dover, in conjunction with Eustace, count of Boulogne, who had quar relled with William. On the banks of the Severn Edric, styled the forester, opposed in arms, as sisted by two Welch princes, the violence of some Normans in his neighbourhood. Coxo, an Englissi earl, was assassinated by his vassals for refusing to be the leader of their insurrection. A temporary quiet was soon restored by the vigorous measures of the king, who hasted back to England in the beginning of December. Under a ssiow of impartiality, he re stored to their lands those who had been lawlessly and unresistingly expelled : but, at the fame time, to heighten the efficacy of his government by an augmentation of revenue, he renewed the tax of Danegelt, oppressive, and to the nation odious in its name. Of the spirit of discontent, universally dif fused, alarming symptoms soon again appeared in the west, where, instigated by Githa, the mother of Harold, and abetted by the neighbouring people of Devonsoire"], [214, "tQO Chap. VIII Insurrec- tions. 1068 HISTORY OF THE Devonssiire and Cornwall, the citizens of Exeter, ssiut their gates against the Normans. By the ener getic operations of the king, who marched with ce lerity to the scene of commotion, the revolters were terrified into an unconditional surrendry, while Githa escaped with her treasure to Flanders. As the habitual severity of William, perhaps ne ver moved by compassion, yielded sometimes on fit occasions to policy, the western revolters were par doned ; but from the general treatment of his new subjects, they were almost every where prone to in surrection, if leaders could be found. To conciliate in the commencement of his reign, the potent bro thers, the earls Edwin and Morcar, he had promi sed his daughter in marriage to the former : but, when his power was once establissied, he gave an absolute refusal, either from original determination, or posterior change of judgement. Provoked at once by national and private injuries, the brothers formed a league with Blethyn, prince of North- Wales, and with the kings Malcolm and Swein, the former of Scotland, the latter of Denmark, to en gage their assistance in a revolt of the Northumbri ans. Their plan seems ill concerted, since William who well knew the great advantage of celerity in such a case, arrived by rapid marches, with a great force at York, before the malcontents had received assistance from abroad, or were in any condition to oppose him. '1 he two earls, on their submisliofi, were seemingly pardoned, and permitted for the pre sent to retain their estates : but the lands of their numerous dependants were confiscated, and confer- red"], [215, "J91 Chap. VIII. V-^W 1069, BRITISH ILANDS. red on foreigners, who, being planted throughout the country, and possessed of the military strength, left these great noblemen destitute of power. Malcolm, though constrained, on the frustration of this plan, to make peace with William, and to perform homage for Cumberland, received with kindness great numbers of Englissi exiles, who fled from the present, or the dread of impending vio lence. Among these was Edgar Atheling and his two sisters, accompanied by Cospatric, a Northum brian nobleman, the adviser of this flight. With a hope that the exiles, with aids from abroad, would co-operate in the attack, the sons of the late King Harold, who had taken refuge in Ireland with Der mot, prince of Leinfter, collecting an armament of sixty ships, in the year 1069, made a descent on the coast of Devonssiire. They were defeated, and dri ven to their fleet, by Brian of Brittany : but a for midable insurrection took place in the north, where the garrison of Durham, consisting of seven hun dred, with Comyn, the governor, was put to the sword. The exiles returned from Scotland, while a Danissi army, debarking from three hundred ships, joined the people of York in an assault on the cita del. In the confusion of a general conflagration, caused by the firing of some houses by the Normans, the assailants were victorious ; and, in the fury of resentment for the destruction of the town, they slaughtered the whole of the hostile troops, to the number of three thousand, with the exception of Mallet, their commander. The flame of insurrec tion spread rapidly into other quarters. In East- Anglia"], [216, "102 (.M AP. VIII HISTORY OF THE Anglia Hereward, a courageous nobleman, headed the insurgents, and took post in the ile of Ely. In ' several parts of the west the people rose in arms. Exeter, whose citizens, from the king's former le- nity, adhered to their allegiance, was besieged by one army ; while another under Edric the forester, as- sisted by Welch troops, invested Shrewsoury. Amid these alarms the king acted at once with deliberate circumspection and strenuous activity. Di- recting his main force to the quarter of greatest peril, and encouraging his followers with the pros- pect of numerous confiscations, he led a formidable army in speedy marches to the north. Employing every expedient of policy as well as force, he, by emissaries, prevailed on Osoerae, the Danissi com- mander, brother to the king of Denmark, to return home with his forces, in consideration of a great sum of money, and of liberty to plunder at discre- tion the eastern coast. Deserted by the Danes, and unsupported by the promised aid of the tardy Scots, the Northumbrian leaders, unable to oppose their monarch, submitted or fled. Their example was followed elsewhere, except by Hereward, who main- tained two years his post in Ely. The leaders, who submitted, were apparently forgiven, and even re ceived for a time into seeming savour, particularly Waltheof, the brave defender of York against the king's army on this occasion, who was even admitted to the honour of being married to Judith, a niece of his sovereign Assailed in 1071 with irresistible force by the king, whose troops advanced in flat-bottomed boats, and by a causeway two miles in length con.

Hereward alone, forcing his way through the enemy, betook himself to the sea, and maintained on that element hostilities against the Normans, till William, from admiration of his he roism, or from other motives, pardoned and restored him to his estate. In his temporary indulgence of some chieftains Cruel cyc- \u2022 n r- Itiw of va the king must have been actuated by policy, or es- v_rnm_-t. teem only of individuals. To the nation he acted, when once completely master, with atrocious cruelty, systematic and unrelenting, calculated for the total extirpation of the gentry, and the depression of the rest to a most abject state of subjection or servitude. To debilitate the Northumbrians from future insur- rections, he laid waste their country, to the extent of sixty miles, between the Humber and the Tees, reducing the houses to ashes, destroying the instru- ments of husoandry, driving away the cattle, and destroying what provisions could not be carried away. Of the wretched inhabitants some fled to Scotland, and others, -to the number of about a hundred thou- sand, perissied from cold and famine. Mutilated into objects hideous to the sight and miserable, by the extrusion of the eyes, and the amputation of the right foot or of the hands, many prisoners, taken at Ely and elsewhere, at different times of insurrec tion, were dispersed through the country to strike terror into the people. By a confiscation, in a few vears universally ex- tended, the whole class of English gentry, including v. l. I. 0 the"], [218, "HISTORY OF THE 194 Chap VIII I the nobles, were ejected from their lands, reduced to the lowest pitch of poverty, and barred from emerging out of that despicable condition, since to exclude all Englishmen from every post of honour, civil, military, and religious, was an established maxim, not only during the reign of this tyrannical conqueror, but also in those of his three next suc cessors. By the Normans and other adventurers, allured from the continent by the spoil of their pro perties, men often of mean birth and education, they were treated not only with wanton cruelty, but with every species of most foul indignity and wanton insult. \" Ladies of the highest rank and greatest beauty, having lost their fathers, brothers, and pro tectors, and being violated by armed ruffians, called upon death to come to their relief,\" fays Ordericus Vitalis a Norman historian. Beside the universal de basement of the gentry, many of whom were blinded, or otherwise so mutilated as to be objects of scorn, says the ancient author of the Elistoria Elyenfis, \" to record what was perpetrated on the lower classes, not only by William himself, but also by his followers, I consider as useless, since we know the description to be difficult, and, on account of the enormous and savage cruelty, perhaps not credible.\" Such was the rueful humiliation of the natives that the name of Englishman became a term of con temptuous reproach. Their language, abandoned to the populace, as a vulgar dialect, was superseded by the French tongue in all fashionable societies, in the pleadings and writings of law in the high courts, in the promulgation of statutes, and the instructions of"], [219, "BRITISH HANDS. 195 os the schools. Where neither policy nor provoca- Chap. tion was a motive, their sufferings were so disre- VIiI garded, as to be sacrificed without scruple to plans of amusement unconnected with any view to interest or utility. Thus William, though already possessed of many extensive tracts which were retained, under the names of forests and chases, in a desert state for the sole purpose of hunting, converted into a wil derness, denominated the New forest in Hampshire, for this barbarous pastime, one of the most populous parts of England, convenient to his residence at Winchester, destroying all the houses, even churches and convents, through an extent of thirty miles, without the least Compensation to the miserable in habitants, who were mercilessly expelled with the loss of all their property. For the protection of the game in all his forests most rigorous laws were en acted, condemning to the deprivation of his eyes the killer of a boar, or deer, or hare ; at a time when the murder of a man could be redeemed by a moderate sine. From this inhuman system of government, the DepopuU facts of which are indisputably authenticated by ear ly and contemporary records, English and Norman, the country sustained a diminution of inhabitants, by death from wounds or hardships, by emigration, and by abduction into foreign servitude. Beside the exiles who took refuge in the Scottish, Irish, and other neighbouring regions, numbers of bold youths sought military service in distant realms. The chief place, to which these adventurers resorted, appears to have been Constantinople, where, under the name O 2 Varangians,"], [220, "HISTORY OF THE 196 Chap VIII Extinction of the Kng, lisli nobi lity. Varangians, they formed the faithfut guards of the Greek emperor, Alexius Comnenus, and his proxi mate successors, as may be seen in Gibbon's history, particularly the fifty-fifth chapter. Of the captive? carried abroad the great receptacle was Scotland, whose monarch, Malcolm, entering England in 1070, much too late for assisting the Northumbrian revol ters, plundered the northern counties without resist ance, perhaps under the connivance of William, and led into slavery so great a multitude, that almost every Scottish village, and even house, is hyperbo lically said to have been on this occasion furnished with slaves. Previously to the formation of the New Forest, which had place about the year 1081, events had occurred which involved the final extinction of the Englissimobles, except Edgar Atheling. This prince, after a second flight to Scotland, on the suppression of the great Northumbrian revolt, again submitted to William in 1072, and was permitted to live in peace, from a contempt of his unwarlike genius, and perhaps from a design to gratify king Malcolm, who had espoused his sister Margaret, and made peace with William. Edwin and Morcar, who had refused to give their aid to this revolt, an aid which might have turned the balance against the king, and had thence expected favour, finding themselves involved notwithstanding in the general disgrace and danger of English nobles, had afterward, in 1071, fled for refuge or resistance, the former toward Scotland, the latter to Hereward in Ely.

By Roger, earl of Hereford, Ralph de Guader, earl of Norfolk and other malcontent nobles, a plot was formed, from causes not clearly known, for the dethronement of William by an insurrection of the English, aided by an army from Denmark. Waltheof, one of the company, who, though highly favoured by his new sovereign, may have been deeply affected by the cruel treatment of his compatriots, was engaged in the design, but, on reflection repented ; perhaps re- garding"], [222, "HISTORY OF THE 198 Chap VIII 0' garding the scheme as impracticable; perhaps ap prehending that the state of affairs would still be worse under Norman lords unrestrained by vigorous exertions of monarchal power. By the advice of Lanfranc, archbishop of Canter bury, to whom he had made confession, he embarked for France, and revealed all to the king. But he is said to have previously informed, as his most faithful confidant, his wife Judith, and she to have sent pri vate intelligence to William, her uncle, with aggra vating circumstances against her husband, whom she wissied to destroy, as she had placed her affections on another. Alarmed at the defection of Waltheof, the conspirators had recourse to a premature insur rection, as the sole expedient. They were totally overthrown by the royal forces before the arrival of the Danisl. armament, which returned home without success ; and before the accelerated arrival of the king himself. The lower classes were hanged, or mutilated ; and Waltheof, though by his repentance the conspiracy had been defeated, was condemned to death with the confiscation of his property : but his widow fell into disgrace, disappointment, and, if guilty, remorse without relief. The earl of Here ford was consigned to prison, whence he was never released ; but might probably, after a ffiort confine ment, have been pardoned, if he had not contemp tuously thrown into the fire some rich garments, a present from the king's own wardrobe, sent him as a mark of returning favour.

BRITISH I LANDS. William, who, opposed both by the duke of that province and by the king of France, was obliged, after some fruitless operations, to grant him a peace. Before the extinction of the Englissi nobility Wil- liam had also found means to deprive of their dig- nities the ecclesiastics of that nation. His instru- ments for this purpose were three legates,' the first commissioned into the British Hands by the Pope, whose authority over the church of England was much augmented by the Norman conquest, and who was willing to make the first exertions of that autho- rity for the new king's gratification, Stigand, arch- bishop of Canterbury, had been denied the honour of being, the officiating prelate at William's corona- tion, under the pretence of an irregular obtainment of his pall from a usurper, pope Benedict the ninth ; yet had afterwards, on account of his great con- nexions and influence, been cajoled with fallacious honours by the conqueror, till his ruin could be safely effected. In a council at Winchester, in 1070, he was, on three charges absolutely frivolous, de- graded by the legates ; and was condemned to im- prisonment, during the rest of his life, by the king, who confiscated all his property.

Lanfranc, a Milanese monk, the new archbishop of Canterbury, gained a suit against the prelate of York, in 1072, in a great council, whose determi nation established the primacy of all England in the former see. Hitherto the civil and ecclesiastical ju risdiction had been conjointly exercised by the earls and bissiops in the county courts : but, in the latter part of this monarch's reign, a separation was esta blished of the spiritual courts from the temporal ; a separation attended in succeeding times with impor tant consequences, dangerous encroachments of the papal or the regal power. But, though by some of his concessions and arrangements a foundation was undesignedly laid for much disquiet and even peril to his successors, this monarch resisted with a determined spirit every open attempt of the supreme pontiff to invade his authority. Hildebrand, who, under the name of Gregory the seventh, succeeded in 1 073 to the papal throne, surpassing all his predecessors in violence and impudence of pretension, attempted to deprive all temporal sovereigns of the right of eccle siastical investiture, the nominating of bissiops and other dignitaries ; to separate completely the spi ritual from the civil power ; to appropriate to him self and his successors the whole authority of the christian church, legislative and judicial ; and finally to reduce all princes of that religion under his tem poral government, by obliging them to hold their kingdoms as fiefs of the Roman fee. Agreeably to this"], [225, "BRITISH ILANDS. 201 Ci..p Vill. this plan, he summoned the new monarch of Eng land to perform homage, and to take an oath of fealty to him for his kingdom, and punctually to re mit what he affected to consider as an establissied tribute. By the tribute the Pope meant Peter's pence, ori ginally a donation from Ossa, king of Mercia, who, toward the end of the eighth century, among other vain modes of expiating his crimes, imposed a tribute of a penny on every house possessed of thirty pence a year, for the support of an Englissi college in Rome, and other charitable institutions, under the management of his Holiness. This eleemosynary gift, stated at only three hundred and sixty-five man. cusses yearly, each little exceeding in weight of silver seven shillings of the eighteenth century, was after wards, by being made general throughout England, considerably augmented, and became by prescription an established tax. Net as a tribute, but in the fense of its original designation, the king complied with the demand of this money : but all claims of tem poral submission he peremptorily rejected ; and, in spite of all the pontifical menaces, he was unremit tingly inflexible in the enforcement of the rules en acted by himself for the ecclesiastical government of his kingdom. By these was interdicted the acknow ledgement in England of any Pope, as duly elected, without his previous command ; the departure of any churchman from his realm without his leave; the enaction of any canons, the publication of any bulls or letters from Rome, or the excommunica tion of any of his nobles, without his permission.

Nor could he be persuaded to permit his prelates to attend a general council in Italy, though repeatedly summoned by the imperious pontiff. But what the superior clergy felt as the greatest grievance was the subjecting of their lands to the burthens of military service, as if held by feudal tenure. To secure his conquest of England, where a feudal aristocracy of an irregular kind had already sub sisted, William establissied an extensive and strictly regular system of feudal government, conferring on his officers the confiscated lands under accurately stated conditions of payments and duties. The great object of the institution was military service. Each owner of an estate was bound to furnissi, in propor tion to its value, at the summons of his sovereign, a number of effective soldiers, properly equipped, and to maintain them at his own expense during the time of their employment. Each owner of a fief, held thus immediately from the crown, divided his lands, with a reservation of some as his own de mesnes, among inferior officers, knights, or vassals, who were bound by tKe fame obligations to him as he to the sovereign. The lands of the bissiops and abbots, which had hitherto been free from all tem poral charges, were rendered by the Norman con queror subject to the same feudal services, and pe nalties in case of failure, as those of laymen. This regulation gave so violent offense to the Englissi cler gy, who had been accustomed to undue exemptions, and an undue influence in the state, that their cla mour may have partly irritated the king to the ex pulsion of natives from ecclesiastical dignities.

A survey completed by the great Alfred, long pre served at Winchester, served probably as a model for this great work of William, accomplissied in the six last years of his life by commissioners, who re gistered all particulars from the verdicts of juries in the several hundreds ; the extent of the lands in each district, the present and former proprietors, the tenures, the value, the proportion of meadow, pas ture, and arable ground, the tenants, the slaves, and even cattle. In each county the mass of its parti culars was digested ; and from these digests was com piled the great Doomsday book, the registry of all the surveyed counties, except Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk, the original returns of which constitute what is called the lesser Doomsday book. This celebrated record, still extant in the exchequer, the chief ho nour of William's reign, the most venerable monu ment possessed by Great Britain, is said to have re ceived its name from its decisive authority in the de termining of disputes, regarded as not less conclusive than the final doom at the day of judgment.

The king, on the discovery of this long concealed plan, alarmed at the intended exportation of so vast a treasure, ex torted, under his connivance, from the vitals of his unhappy subjects, arrested Odo with his own hand, at the point of embarkation in the ile of Wight, not as a bishop, but as earl of Kent ; and, seizing his money, committed him to prison, whence, notwith standing the papal menaces, he would not release him till the end of his reign.

Beside the Saxon chronicle, already mentioned, in several histories of early date are the transactions re- gistered of \"William the conqueror and his proxi- mate successors. That which was written by Flo- rence, a monk of Worcester, ended with his own life in 1 1 19, but was continued fifty years farther by another monk of the fame monastery. For candour, arrangement, chastity of style, and freedom from those legendary tales with which the writings of those dark ages are mostly polluted, the history of his own times by Eadmerus, a monk of Canterbury, from 1066 to 1 122, is in high estimation. In pu- rity of language and attention to truth, William of Malmssiury bears the highest character, librarian of the Abbey known by that name, who digested the general transactions of England in seven books, from the year 449 to 1 143, the time of his decease. The same are found less ably compiled, from the earliest accounts to 1154, by Henry, archdeacon of Hunt- ingdon, in eight books.

The writings of these and others have been examined and compared by more modern compilers of early English history, but by none with more attention and discernment than by lord Lyttleton in the introduction to his history of Henry the second. By Matilda, his queen, who died four years be ' fore him, William the first,, beside five daughters, had four sons, of whom three survived him, Robert, William, and Henry : the other, named Richard, a youth of great hopes, had expired in a distemper contracted from the foul air of the New forest, where he hunted ; or, as others report, from wounds re- ceived in that place from a stag. To his eldest son Robert, who had rebelled against him, the expiring king left the dukedom of Normandy, which pro- bably, as the Norman barons were attached to that prince, could not be with-held from him : but to William, the next in seniority, he bequeathed the kingdom of England, by a testament in form of a letter to Lanfranc the primate. A succession founded on such a bequest, if confirmed by the national as- sembly, was not illegal, according to the customs then prevalent among both Normans and English. To secure the national consent prince William hasted from Normandy to England, where he arrived be- fore the news of his father's death ; seized the prin- cipal fortresses on the southern coast, and the royal treasure at Winchester, by the influence of which, and of the primate, to whom he is said to have made the most solemn engagements to govern with justice and mercy, he so prevailed as to be crowned at"], [235, "BRITISH ILANDS. 211 at Westminster, in the September of 1087, in an Chap. assembly of the chief barons and prelates, and to be acknowledged as their sovereign by all the other vassals of the crown, in their oaths of allegiance before the end of that year. The royal treasure seized at Winchester, beside R\u00b0yal re_ 1 , , venue of jewels, gold, plate, and other articles, consisted of EngUnj. sixty thousand pounds of coined silver, which may be estimated as, in efficacy, equal to at least a mil lion at the present time. To what the royal revenue then amounted is unknown. The accounts trans mitted by some writers are too extravagant to be ad missible. In the general confiscation of Englissi lands the conqueror had reserved, as the immediate pro perty of the crown, not less than fourteen hundred and twenty-two manors in different parts of the king dom, which paid him rents in money or in the pro duce of the soil. These, with the feudal services and taxes, and profits arising from various casualties, constituted a more efficient force than seems to have been then possessed by any other monarch in Europe. Among the casualties were escheats, fines, guardian ssiips of minor nobles, and reliefs. By the last were meant large sums, amounting at least to a fourth of the annual income, paid by heirs on obtaining pos session of their estates, which were thus relieved from the hands of the sovereign, into whose custody they fell at the death of each possessor. Notwithstanding the influence of his treasure, a c.nspi- racy, which he spared not in the application, and the oaths of allegiance recently sworn, a conspiracy, almost general, was formed by the barons for the dethrone- P 2 ment"], [236, "HISTORY OF THE 212 Chap IX ment of the new monarch, and the elevauon of h.. brother Robert into his place. Nobles, posiessed of estates at once in Normandy and England, feared, from the disruption of the two governments, danger to their properties in case of war between the two princes. This apprehension was enforced with all his might by Odo, who, though restored to liberty by the late king's order, and to his earldom by the present, was highly discontented since he was not intrusted with power. The facility of Robert's tem per, whom they might hope to govern, rendered him an object of choice to the great barons rather than William, who was actuated by a vigorous, im perious, and determined spirit. Deserted by most of the Normans, when the con spirators had commenced hostilities in many places, in concert with Robert, who prepared to come from Normandy with a formidable force, William threw himself on the affections of the Englissi, who had been from the first more inclined to his interest, as he had resided a longer time among them. Allured by his promises of good laws, gentle treatment, and a liberty of hunting, by a relaxation of the barbar ous forest laws of his father, thirty thousand English were soon collected under his banner. Acting with vigour and celerity, he soon reduced the fortresses of Rochester and Pevenscy ; punissied with exile and confiscation the conspirators who fell into his hands ; and attempted, not without some considerable suc cess, to detach by private negociation, the most powerful members from the confederacy. While Robert loitered on the coast of Normandy with the main"], [237, "BRITISH ILANDS. 213 main body of his troops, intimidated from invasion Chap. by the loss of an armament which he had sent to ]X assist the revolters, and which was destroyed in the ' *~~^ channel by the Englissi fleet ; while also several ba rons, dreading, beside other consequences, the esta blishment of a mutual attachment, prejudicial to Norman interest, between the king and the English, * were deserting their confederates ; William so effica ciously exerted his force as to drive all the rest of the conspirators into banishment or submission, and to fix himself firmly on the throne. The disorders of Normandy, permitted by the lax Attempts administration of the indolent and facile Robert, en- 1^' couraged the king to attempt the wresting of that 'oao. dutchy from his brother, who had attempted to wrest 109G from him his kingdom. Having by intrigues with Norman barons obtained possession of, several for- tresses in the dutchy, and having, by the force of money, engaged the king of France, who ought to have protected the duke, his vassal, to stand neuter, he appeared on the ground, leading an army in per son, in 1090. By the earnest intercession of the Norman lords on both sides, closely connected by interest and alliances, an accommodation was effected between the brothers, on these terms, guarantied on oath by twelve of the most powerful barons in each party ; that William ssiould retain the places of which he had possession ; that he ssiould assist his brother in the recovery of Maine which had revolted ; that the confiscated estates in England ssiould be restored to those Norman nobles who had confederated with Robert ; and that, on the demise of either of the two"], [238, "HISTORY OF THE 214 Chap IX two brothers without issue, the survivor should in herit all his dominions. An apparent reconciliation was the consequence of this treaty. Robert, accompanying his brother into Fngland, commanded an army in an indecisive expe dition against the Scots in 1092 ; but soon returned to Normandy, where he found that William still continued his intrigues. In 1094 an open rupture ensued ; and William, by the force of arms and money, was renewing his attempt of conquest, when he was recalled from Normandy to his own kingdom, where an incursion, soon repelled, had been made by the Welch, and a conspiracy had been formed for depriving him of the crown, and conferring it on Stephen, count of Aumale, nephew of William the first by a sister. By the rapidity of his motions the conspirators were disconcerted, and fell mostly into his hands. Very few were punissied by death or mutilation, but all by forfeitures, and some by im prisonment ; particularly Robert de Mowbray, earl of Northumberland, the principal plotter, who was liberated only by death in thirty-four years after. Fortune in 1096 gave this monarch full possession of the Norman dutchy. Seized with the enthusiasm then prevalent of engaging in a crusade to the Holy Land, a subject which I shall in another place have occasion more particularly to mention, Robert, to support the expense of his expedition, morto-ao-ed all his territories to the king for the loan of ten thou sand marks ; a sum perhaps not much exceeding a hundred thousand pounds at present in actual value. From this great extension, however, of his territo- rial"], [239, "BRITISH ILANDS. 215 rial dominion, no real augmentation of power ac- Chap. crued to William, as his continental barons were lx mutinous, and were supported in their opposition to his authority by their immediate neighbour, the king of France. The character of William, commonly called Ru- character fas from the red colour of his hair, had been seen the second. in full force after the complete establiffiment of his power. He was magnanimous to the highest pitch, courageous, ardent, indefatigably active in pleasure as in business, but never sacrificing the latter to the former : so imperious as to bear no contradiction, when he had power to enforce obedience ; yet such a dissembler, so pliant, soothing, and artful on oc casion, as generally to gain his ends more by ad dress than by force, notwithstanding that in person he was disagreeable, and ungraceful in elocution : munificent, not without distinction of merit, but to a profusion which required the supply of a most cruel rapacity : addicted to amorous pursuits, yet at tached to no one woman, even as a mistress, and never engaging in a matrimonial connexion : petu lant in his wit, profane in his conversation, and so little studious to conceal his vices as to encourage a general profligacy of manners by his example. Of the anecdotes recorded, as instances of his mag- nanimity, promptness for action, and determined spi rit, two have been furnissied from his transactions with Helie, count of La Fleche in the French province of Maine. This lord, his competitor for the govern ment of that province, being taken prisoner in a ssiir mish, and brought before him, said with noble cou- rage,"], [240, "218 Chap IX His mal adminillra tiun HISTORY OF THE rage, \" an accident has made me your captive ; but, if I could recover my liberty, I know what I should do.\" The king instantly dismissed him in full free dom, saying, \" begone : I give you leave to do your utmost ; and I swear to you that if you overcome me hereafter-, I will assi no return from you for having set you free \" Previously to this capture, in 1099, -receiving intelligence, while he was hunting in the New forest, that Mans, the capital of Maine, had been seized by Helie, and its citadel besieged, Wil liam had immediately turned from his sport ; gal lopped to Dartmouth ; embarked amid the terrors of a tempest, telling the sailors in reply to their remon strances, that \" he had never heard of a king be ing drowned;\" landed next morning at Barfleur; marched rapidly to Mans ; relieved the citadel, and chased Helie into his own territories, where he was afterwards taken prisoner, and thus released. Of his Tapacity, the consequence of profusion, the bitter effects were felt-by the unfortunate people, as also of the licentiousness, encouraged by his example and connivance, in the nobles and soldiery. His promise of kind treatment to the Englissi was totally forgotten or neglected. By arbitrary constructions of the feudal laws enormous sums were, under va rious pretences, extorted from the immediate vassals of the crown, which by them were levied from the sub-vassals in such manner, that the load of oppres sion descended with accumulated and almost intole rable weight on the lowest classes. As all these exac tions proved inadequate to the demands, recourse was had to every other practicable expedient ; to the sale"], [241, "BRITISH ILANDS. 217 Chap. IX. Disputes with An (elm. sale of whatever could be rendered venal, even of ecclesiastical dignities and justice itself; and ulti mately to confiscations, the worst resource of prodi gal tyrapny. Bissiopricks, once vacant, were long retained in that state, and their revenues appro priated to the monarch's use. The clergV, so for midable to princes of the Saxon line, submitted, how reluctantly soever, to the extortions of Wil liam ; and, either through necessity, or a design to render his government more odious, they sold most of the plate and rich ornaments of the churches to raise the demanded sum, when the Norman dutchy was mortgaged by Robert. The great instrument in a system o'f oppression, which in a few years more must have ruined the king or kingdom, was Ralph Flambard, a Norman, who, notwithstanding his ignorance of literature, and open contempt of reli gion, had been raised from the'dregs of the people to the fee of- Durham, and the highest place in the administration, on account ofTiis agreeable wit, his sycophantic arts, his acuteness in law, and a fertility of invention in the raising of money with a remorse less apathy to the miseries of the people, and a daring contempt of the resentments excited in the nobles. The unfortunate subjects were not only exposed to the calamities of arbitrary government, but also to those of anarchy, since by the licentiousness of the young nobles, which emanated from the court, the army was infected, and its disorders were not re strained.

HISTORY OF THE tion to the tyranny which he exercised over all orders except the military, the support of his government. All aid, which malcontents might receive from Scot land, was precluded by the weakness into which that kingdom fell on the death of Malcolm the third, which I shall have occasion to relate hereafter. The inclination of the Normans to revolt was checked by their fear of the Englissi, who might find in a civil war an opportunity of driving them from the country. The clergy were disarmed by a schism in the Roman church between Urban the second and Clement, each of whom, while they both at once claimed the popedom, was afraid of disobliging the king of England, who was so politic as to keep them both in suspense by delaying to declare for either. But he was forced at length from his neutrality by the obstinacy of Anfelm, whom he had raised from the Norman abbacy of Bee to the see of Canter bury, when that see had remained near five years vacant after the decease of Lanfranc in 1089. Anfelm, who was at first so obstinate in refusing the archiepiscopal dignity, that his hand was opened by force for the reception of the pastoral staff, was afterwards more obstinate still in his adherence to Urban, whom he had, when abbot, acknowledged as pope. Regarding the sovereign pontiff as vested with a dominion over all temporal powers, himself as one of his Viceroys, and the pall as the ensign of his office, he petitioned the king for leave to repair to Rome, that he might receive this robe from Ur ban.

But the pri mate inflexibly persevered, notwithstanding that the lords temporal and spiritual, who were convened at his request at Rockingham in 1095, and by whose advice he professed an intention of being directed, severely censured the disloyalty of his petition. By a secret agreement between Urban and the king, the former was acknowledged by proclamation through out England as the rightful pope, and into the hands of the latter was consigned the pall, that he might dispose of it according to his pleasure. But Wil liam, who had hoped by this treaty to procure the deposition of Anfelm, found himself deceived, and was obliged to surrender the pall to that obstinate prelate. After a seeming reconciliation fressi dis putes arose. Ansel in again pertinaciously petitioned for leave to go to Rome, and at length departed without leave, in 1097, in the garb of a pilgrim. All his effects and revenues were immediately seized for the use of the king, who, notwithstanding the papal menaces, refused to restore them. The threat ened sentence of excommunication was delayed, first at the request of Anfelm himself, and still further afterwards by the private intercession of William's ambassador. Urban, who was rendered thus com pliant by his unwillingness to create any dissentions which might obstruct his plans of a crusade, died in 1099, before the expiration of the time allowed for the repentance of William, who thus was extricated from the danger.

To Normandy al ready in his\" possession he was preparing to add two other French provinces, Guinne and Poictcu, which their duke had offered to mortgage for so much money as would enable him to lead an army in a crusade. While to escort the treasure to France, and to secure to himself the government of the sti pulated territories, his officers were assembling a fleet and a large body of troops, he took his usual diversion of hunting in the New forest, where he was found dead, on the second of August in the evening, in the year 1100, with an arrow deeply infixed in his breast, the shaft of which was broken, as if by his own struggles to draw it from the wound. How this wound had been given cannot be ascertained. The prevalent opinion at that time was that he had fallen accidentally on an arrow in his own hand. The arrow might have been designedly aimed from private revenge by some person unknown. The story which has gained credit in latter times is, that it was ssiot by Sir Walter Tyrrel, a French knight, at a deer, and accidentally struck the king. Tyrrel, from apprehension of being accused, went abroad in a crusade ; but he solemnly declared on oath, many years after, in France, when he had no cause of hope or fear on that account, that he had not seen the king that day in the forest, nor had been in the fame part of it with him.

JL O Henry, his youngest son, nothing more had been bequeathed than a sum of money, and the lands of his mother Matilda in England, by Wil liam the conqueror, who yet had foretold, that in course of time this young prince would surpass both his brothers in power and opulence. His money, without his consent, was seized by Robert, for the pay of troops against William Rufus : but, on the reconciliation of those two brothers, a third part of Normandy was consigned to him as a compensation. Precluded from the possession of his English estates by Rufus, and imprisoned six months, through jealousy, by Robert, and deprived of his Norman territories, he repossessed himself, on the attainment of his liberty, of a part of the latter by force of arms. After a temporary reconciliation with Ro bert, whom he assisted in the suppression of some conspirators,"], [247, "22S Chap. X. BRITISH ILANDS. conspirators, he was deprived of all by the joint forces of his brothers, and reduced to wander, as an exile, through several provinces of France, ex posed, with only five attendants, to such penury and hardssiips as taught him the virtues of patience and fortitude. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Dumfront, one of the strongest cities of Normandy, revolting from the tyranny of their immediate lord, Robert de Belesme, and the passive injustice of duke Robert, put themselves under the protection of Henry, who, by their assistance, opposed successfully both his bro thers. When Robert engaged in a crusade, William admitted Henry to a final reconciliation, by which he permitted him to retain what he had acquired, and to accompany him into England in his return. Engaged in hunting, in a different part of the New forest, at the fame time, with Rufus, Hen ry, on intelligence of his death, hasted instantly to Winchester ; seized the royal treasure in spite of the resistance of its keeper, on whom he drew his sword, with menaces of death ; posted thence to London, after his brother's interment ; was chosen king by a great council, or assembly of nobles and prelates ; and was crowned on the following Sunday, the fifth of August, in Westminster-abbey. To attach the nation to his government he adopted measures of the most conciliatory nature. He granted to his subjects a charter of rights, for the restoration of Edward the confessor's laws, with such alterations as had been made in them by William the conqueror with consent of his parliament ; and for the annul ling of all evil customs and illegal exactions, lately prevalent, some of which, with their specified reme- dies,"], [248, "22* Chap. X. Invasion by Robert. 1101. IIISTORY OF THE dies, were particularly stated in the written instrur ment. To the citizens of London he confirmed, with additional favours, the charter given them by his father, who had been remarkably solicitous to fix them in his interest. Beside \"the abolition of ille- gal burthens, and the forgiveness of debts due to the crown, he punissied all the instruments of his prede- cessor's extortion, particularly Flambard, the justi- ciary of England, whom he committed to prison. He recalled Anfelm, the primate, and placed him.at the head of the ministry, a< great favourite with the nation, as having been an object of hostility to the tyrannic William. He married Matilda, daughter of the deceased king of Scotland, Malcolm the third, by the sister of Edgar Atheling. To this match, so endearing to the Englissi, by which the crown was restored to the royal blood of the Saxon sine, an obstacle was apprehended, as Matilda had worn the veil of a nun in England, where ssie had taken refuge from the troubles of Scotland conse- quent to her father's death. The obstacle was re- moved by the sentence of an assembly of barons and prelates at Lambeth, where Anfelm presided, to whom the princes, proved that ssie had merely as sumed the garb, without the vows, according to the custom of Englissi ladies, as the only protection of female chastity from the brutal violence of the Nor mans. Duke Robert, the rightful heir of England, both by primogeniture and his treaty with Rufus, had delayed so long in Apulia, in his return from the crusade, in which he had acquired the highest repu- tation"], [249, "2'2a Chap X BRITISH ILANDS. tation by his valour and generosity, that he lost the opportunity of entering into the possession of this kingdom, which he otherwise might have accom- plished without opposition. Arriving in France about a month after William's decease, he obtained unop- posed immediate possession of the Norman dutchy, and made vigorous preparations to inforce his claim to the Englissi crown with the troops of Normandy, aided by most of the Normans in England, who re- volted from Henry, probably through the influence of those great barons, who, having estates in both countries, may have wilhed a perpetual union of the kingdom and dutchy. As the greater part of the navy, stationed in the channel to prevent his inva- sion, deserted to his party, he landed without inter- ruption at Portsmouth in the July of not. From the attachment of the English in general, of some Normans, and of all the clergy through Anfelm, who had even denounced excommunication against all his opponents, Henry had raised a large body of troops, with which he instantly marched against his brother. Dreading the consequences of a decisive action, the two princes, when their armies had some days faced each other without a battle, agreed, through the mediation of the primate and others, to a treaty of peace, the principal terms of which were; that Robert ssiould relinquissi his claim on the Englissi crown, and 'ssiould be paid, in compensation, an an nual pension of three thousand marks, exceeding thirty thousand pounds at present in value : that of the two princes the survivor ssiould inherit the do minions of both : that the adherents of both ssiould Vol. I.

Though Henry, according to the letter of the treaty, restored the revolted barons, he soon found means, by legal prosecutions, under other pretences, to punissi them by banissiment and the confiscation of their lands. Enraged at the ruin of his friends in England, Robert made an imprudent visit, in 1103, to his brother's court, and severely remonstrated ; but found cause to suspect such danger to his person, that to procure a safe return he resigned his pension to the English queen. While Henry was establissiing his power on the firmest foundations, the duke, im mersed in riot or in sloth, was losing the respect and affection of the Normans by so criminal a neglect of his duty as a governor, that all was in confusion in his territories, innocence without protection, rapine and other violences committed without restraint. Despairing of security from their duke, many of the barons of Normandy, and the main body of the ecclesiastics, requested the interference of the king of England, who in consequence visited their coun try in 1104, reprimanded his brother for maladmi nistration, gained possession of the county of Evreux, and laid a plan for the conquest of all the dutchy, which he attempted in the following year with a con siderable army, but with only partial success. Having assured his adherents of his determination to support them, he a third time entered Normandy, at the end of July, in 1 106, and laid siege to Tinche- bray,"], [251, "BRITISH ILANDS. 227 Chap X Edpar Athcling. bray, where Robert, having assembled all his forces, gave him battle at the end of September, but, after a bloody and long doubtful contest, was defeated and captured with ten thousand of his men. The unfortunate duke, whose history proves, as Littleton has observed, \" that neither the most heroic valour, nor the best heart, can save from ruin a prince, who pardons every thing, and refuses nothing,\" died in the castle of Cardiff in Glamorganssiire, after an im prisonment of almost twenty-eight years. Accord ing to the most probable accounts, in the words of the fame judicious historian, \" Henry made his con finement as easy to him as possible, furnishing him with an elegant table, and buffoons to divert him ; pleasures which he had some years preferred to all the duties of sovereign power.\" In the battle of Tinchebray was also captured Edgar Atheling, the next heir to the Englissi crown in right of the Saxon line. This prince, already mentioned, as postponed on account of minority, as taking refuge in the Scottissi dominions, and as re admitted to the protection of William the conqueror, had afterwards, in 1086, gone abroad in a pilgri mage ; had, on his return thence, after the con queror's death, been invested with an honourable fief in the Norman dutchy by duke Robert ; had, on his deprivation of this fief by the influence of William Rufus, in IC90, again retired into Scot land; had, on his mediation of a peace between that kingdom and hngland, been admitted to the protection of William; had, in 1097, with an ;irmy intrusted to his command by that monarch, placed O 2 on 1"], [252, "HISTORY OF THE 228 Chap X Character of Henry. on the Scottissi throne Edgar, the son of his sister Margaret by Malcolm the third ; and had afterwards led twenty thousand Scots to the East, in a crusade, in the course of which he lost his whole army. After his return from this expedition, leaving the Englissi court, he joined duke Robert, on what account we know not, and thus became a prisoner to Henry, who pardoned him as the uncle of his queen, and as one from whom he apprehended no danger. He died in peaceful retirement, at what age is not known, contemned by the Englissi for his want of spirit, but fortunate in seeing his nephew seated on the Scottish, and his niece on the English throne, whose posterity have reigned over the Britissi Hands to this day. The wisdom and vigour of Henry's government, of which the salutary effects had been manifested in England, had attracted to his interest all the lovers of order in the Norman dutchy, disgusted by the anarchy permitted by Robert. Endowed by nature with estimable gifts, educated some years in the school of adversity, and tinctured with literature, a most rare accomplissiment of princes in that age, this monarch was qualified to render his usurpation a measure very fortunate for the kingdom. His per sonal configuration was agreeable ; a middle stature ; a handsome ssiape ; a robust frame ; brown and bussiy hair ; a pleasing countenance ; eyes clear, serene, and penetrating. He was possessed of a strong intellect ; a sound judgment ; a firm and cou rageous heart ; a vigour, activity, and steadiness of mind ; a cool temper ; a knowledge of men, of bu siness, and of war. He acquired the surname of Beauclerc,"], [253, "BRITISH ILANDS. 229 Beauclerc, or fine scholar, from his acquaintance Chap. with letters, in which he remained free from the X wretched superstition and pedantry of the times, and seems to have been chiefly conversant in history, the best subject of study to princes, to whom its exam ples are the most important and least offensive les sons of instruction. He had a persuasive eloquence, a dignity of demeanour combined with an encourag ing affability, a facetious humour tempered with dis cretion. He was parsimonious from provident con siderations, sensible how expedient was money for national defense and his own support on the throne. He was remarkably sober, but so incontinent that the number of his illegitimate children, recorded by historians, amounted to thirteen. His greatest fault, the vice of the times, appears Hi? admi to have been, notwithstanding his literature, such ni an attachment to the barbarous amusement of hunt ings, as to cause a continued enforcement of the in human forest laws of his father and brother. His taxes also were severely oppressive, as he was atten tive to the advantage of a well-replenissied treasury. In general his administration was eminently laudible. By the ruin of some barons, possessed of undue power, whose estates were confiscated in consequence of their conspiracy in favour of duke Robert, he was enabled to exert the royal authority with suf ficient force for the protection of every rank of his subjects in their persons and property. From these confiscations he was furnissied with the means of raising to stations of high trust and influence, as a counterpoise to the old nobility, men of inferior birth,"], [254, "HO HISTORY OF THE Chap, birth, but superior talents and industry. His char i_,X'_ ter and administration, though not strictly in unison each with the other, gave strength and consistency to the Anglo-Norman system of government, a sys- tem compounded of Anglo-Saxon customs and the feudal institutions of the Normans, roughly ssietched by William the first, but defaced by the tyranny of himself and his immediate successor. By a steady enforcement of law, severe and salutary, such order was preserved, that to the end of his reign, from the invasion of Robert, a space of above thirty-three years, no revolt or even commotion had place in England, a kingdom containing many haughty ba- rons, whose turbulence displayed the most melan choly effects in the succeeding reign. His contest Notwithstanding the wisdom, spirit, and vigilance fclm.An\" \u00b0f monarch, he was unable to maintain com- 1101. plctely his ground, in a contest with his primate, \u25a0j 107. against the encroachments of the Roman see. An- felm, on his recall by Henry, in the commencement of his reign, had positively refused to perform ho mage for the temporalities of the fee of Canterbury, as this was forbidden by a canon lately decreed by a council at Rome ; and the king, to gain time till his government ssiould have been firmly establissied, had prevailed on him to agree that both ssiould send envoys to the Pope for his final determination. The pontiff\" decided in the primate's favour, and repro bated investitures of ecclesiastics by laymen, in a letter to Henry, in which were contained some ex traordinary assertions, specimens of deplorable ab surdity, as, for instance, this ; \" that for a son to be- get"], [255, "BRITISH HANDS. 231 Chap X get his father, or for a man to create his God, was monstrous ; and that priests were declared fathers and gods by divine revelation recorded in scripture.\" Af ter another fruitless embassy to Rome, and ineffec tual menaces to Anfelm, persuasion was tried, and that prelate, in compliance with the request of the king and great council, undertook an embassy to Rome in person, in 1103, to endeavour to obtain permission from the pope for the Englissi monarch \" to enjoy the prerogatives of his predecessors.\" Though Henry sent another envoy to co-operate with Anfelm for this purpose both by eloquence and money, he failed in his suit, insomuch that excom- munication was decreed against all prelates, who had received, or ssiould receive investiture from the hands of the king, until, on satisfaction made, they ssiould have been absolved by their primate. The revenues of Anfelm were seized by Henry, on the receipt of a letter sent by him from Lyons, in which he declared his inflexible resolution of acting in con- formity to this decree. Intimidated by the excom- munication of his favourite minister, and by the menace of the fame sentence against himself, Henry, after an interview with his primate in Normandy, in the July of 1105, restored to him his revenues, and procured a suspension of all matters in dispute until the result ssiould be known of an embassy which they agreed to send jointly to the pope. The result of this embassy, in which probably the influence of treasure was not neglected, was a final compromise in 1 107, whereby the king relinquished the prero gative of episcopal investiture by the ring and cro- sier ;"], [256, "HISTORY OF THE 232 Chap, sier ; while, on the other hand, the sovereign pontiff X\" conceded, that consecration should not be withheld from any man, elected to any prelacy, on account x of his performance of homage to the Englissi mo- narch. orberee- Anfelm, whose return to England, after a long Sac-\"1 absence, had place in 1106, and exit from the world tion9- in 11 00, had been inveterately hostile to the mar- 1 1 OQ 1130. riage of the clergy, against which he had procured the enaxionof rigorous canons. Yet the pope in no6 had permitted him to dispense with that canon which prohibited the ordination and promotion of the sons of priests, \" because,\" said his holiness, \" the execution of it would be very inconvenient in England, where the best and greatest part of the clergy are of that description.\" As clerical matri mony still continued to be practiced, new decrees were made against it, in 1126, by the first national council in England whose president was a legate of the pope. But this decree met such contempt, on account of a ridiculous incident, that it was not en forced. The presiding legate, a cardinal, John de Crema, after a furious declamation made by him in the council against the horrible impurity of mar riage in ecclesiastics, and in praise of immaculate chastity, was, in the night of the fame day, found in bed with a harlot, in so public a manner, that through shame he stole privately out of the kingdom. By councils convened, in 1127 and II29> by William Corboyl, archbissiop of Canterbury, bearing the commission of legate, very cruel penalties were en acted against both married priests and their wives : but"], [257, "235 Chap, X Henry's transactions m France 1111 1119 X* BRITISH ILANDS. but the king, to whom the execution was committed, suffered the law to remain uninforced, in considera tion of money paid him by the objects of persecu tion. By a schism of nine years' duration in the Ro man church, which commenced at the decease of pope Honorius the second in 1 1 30, between Inno cent the second and his unsuccessful opponent, Ana cletus, the church of England, governed by her own prelates, enjoyed an uncommon tranquility. Except some ssiirmisses with the incursive Welch, the only wars of Henry, after the invasion of Eng land by his brother Robert, were in Fiance, oc casioned by disputes naturally arising from the contiguity of his feudal possessions with those of others in that kingdom, and by coalitions formed against him in favour of VvTiliam, the only son of duke Robert, furnamed Clito and Longsword, the former of which bore among the Normans the fame signification as Atheling among the Englissi, denot ing the blood royal. This young prince had, at the age of six, fallen into the hands of Henry his uncle, soon after the battle of Tinchebray, fatal to his father's liberty, and had been committed to the custody of a nobleman of great honour, Helie de Saint-Saen, married to an illegitimate sister of the boy. Afterwards dreading danger from the friends of William, who was direct heir of England in the Norman line, the king attempted to place him else where; but Helie, alarmed, fled abroad with the prince, and endeavoured to interest foreign courts in his favour. Fulk, earl of Anjou, and Lewis le Gross, king of France, espoused his cause, in con- sequence"], [258, "354 HISTORY OF THE Chap, sequence of which Henry spent two years in Nor v_3'_^ mandy, engaged in negociations, and in a war of slight ssiirmissies, for the protection of his dominions on the continent. Fulk, who had contracted one of his daughters to William Clito, was detached from his alliance by a proposal of the Englissi monarch to give in marriage his own son, William, the heir of all his dominions, to another daughter of the earl. Lewis, thus deserted, was obliged to sign a peace advantageous to Henry, who in 1 1 1 3 returned to England. After five years of tranquility, subsequent to this pacification, enjoyed by king Henry, his whole atten- tion was engaged in Normandy, in 1118, by the news of a renovated confederacy, by which both his military and political talents were brought se ll 18. verely to trial. William Clito, who, on his deser- tion by Eulk, had been carried to the court of Bald win, earl of Flanders, had now, on his approach to maturity, manifested very strong indications of spirit and ability. Pity for his misfortune, and the esteem of his merit, operated with various interests to the forming of an extensive league in his favour, in which were comprehended Baldwin, king Lewis, almost all the barons of France, even Fulk himself, who perhaps mistrusted the sincerity of the Englissi monarch in the promise of his son's marriage. Most of the Norman nobles, wissiing to have the son of Robert for their duke, conspired with the externs against Henry, who was environed with treason, and was even in great danger of being assassinated. By an army from England, hired forces from Britany, and"], [259, "233 Chap X BRITISH ILANDS. and intrigues which his treasure enabled him to ma nage, he found means to baffle, and at last to de feat and to dissolve the coalition. The operations of this war, defensive on the side of the Englissi monarch, were too desultory, com- plicated, and singly unimportant, for a statement here. An atrocious instance of the cruelties prac- ticed under lax governments of the feudal kind, which considerably affected the character of Henry, ought perhaps not to be omitted. On the demand of Eustace, lord of Breteuil, married to a natural daughter of Henry, to be put into possession of an important castle, which had formerly belonged to his ancestors, but was now held as a part of the ducal demesne, the king promised that he ssiould ob- tain it at the end of the war, and, for security of performance, gave into his hands, as a hostage, a young son of the governor of the fortress, taking in return the two daughters of Eustace, his own grand- children, as hostages for their father's fidelity dur- ing the war. The villain, who had previously de- termined on revolt, gave proof of a savage mind, by blinding the boy, whom he returned in that dis- mal state to his father. As the only mode of grati- fying his resentment, the king delivered the two young ladies to the injured governor, who, in reta- liation, deprived them of their eyes and ends of their noses. With a Roman fortitude, however illauda ble, to which British history furnissies no parallel, Henry, without the least intimation of displeasure for this inhuman treatment of his innocent grand daughters, endeavoured to console the governor's grief,"], [260, "25ct Chap, X 1118 111!. HISTORY OF THE grief, and to reward his loyalty, with presents and honours. Filled with furious resentment, Juliana, the king's daughter, mother of the unfortunate la dies, invited her father to a parley, at the castle of Breteuil, with intention to kill him with an arrow which ssie discharged at him from a cross bow, but missed her aim ; and no other punishment than a momentary affront was inflicted on her by Henry, who had her fully in his power. By degrees the defensive schemes and politics of the Englissi monarch operated to his advantage. Bald win, the most inveterate and active of his confede rate enemies, died of a wound received in an en gagement near Eu. Fulk, the next most formidable, he detached from the coalition, in the following year, by solemnizing the promised marriage of his only legitimate son, William, with the daughter of that earl. Pussiing the operations of war with a vigour which threatened the speedy reduction of all the Norman barons, he was assailed by an army con ducted by king Lewis, who was accompanied by William Clito. In the plain of Brenville near the castle of Noyon in the territory called Vexin, a battle was fought, in which William Clito by a fu rious charge broke the first line of the Englissi ca valry, but was repulsed by the second led by Henry in person, whose life was preserved by the admirable temper of his helmet. By two blows of a sword, from a knight named Crispin, this piece of armour, without being penetrated, was so bent as to cut his head and to cause an effusion of blood. Crispin him self, beaten to the ground by a stroke from Henry, or"], [261, "BRITISH ILANDS. 237 or one of his barons, was taken prisoner. The for- Chap. tune of this battle, in which horsemen only were engaged, was decided in favour of the Englissi by the advance of their infantry, the encounter of whose pikes and battleaxes the French cavalry declined. The contest was chiefly remarkable for the strength of the defensive armour then in use. Out of nine hundred horsemen on both sides, furiously engaged, only three were slain. But many of the principal nobility of France were captured, and Lewis him self was in very great danger of the fame fate. By the mediation of pope Calixtus the second, who, in a visit to France, was gained to the Englissi party by the presents and eloquence of the king, a peace was concluded in 1120, in which the interests of Wil liam Clito were totally neglected. Refusing to pay 1120. homage in person for Normandy to Lewis, Henry agreed that his son William ssiould be vested with that dutchy, and ssiould perform the ceremony in the usual manner. The pleasure arising to the king of England from Death of , n , ,. n r 1 - 1 \u2022 1 prince Wil the establishment ot his power and reputation on the Ham. continent was miserably overbalanced by domestic 1120. affliction. Returning to his kingdom, at the end of the November of 1 1 20, from the port of Bar fleur, he assigned one of the finest vessels of his navy, called the White ssiip, for the conveyance of Wil liam, his only legitimate son, a prince of great hopes, in the eighteenth year of his age. This vessel, to the crew of which the prince had given a quantity of wine, was the last in leaving the har bour; and, through the drunkenness of the mari- ners,"], [262, "228 Chap, X Mifcellane, nu\u00ab frans actiolis. 1121 1 1 28 HISTORY OF THE ners, and their eagerness to overtake the rest with crowded fails, was suffered to strike against a rock, supposed to be the Catte-raze, and was in conse quence filled soon with water, and sunk. Having escaped into the long boat, William could have safely reached the land ; but, affected by the cries of his natural sister, the countess of Perche, he ordered the mariners to row back to the ship to her relief, when so great a number leaped into the boat that it went immediately to the bottom. Of three hundred per sons embarked in the ssiip, among whom were above a hundred and forty sons of prime nobility, one only escaped, a butcher of Rouen, named Bertoud, who, keeping his head above water by clinging to the top of the mast, was, by the strength of his constitution and woollen garments, enabled to survive till the following day, when some fissiermen relieved him. After three days of anxious expectation, when no one of his courtiers would be the messenger of such news, Henry, informed by a boy instructed for the purpose, was deserted by his former fortitude and fell into a swoon ; nor was he able for some time to recover his usual composure of mind and application to business, nor ever, some fay, his former cheer fulness. Domestic affliction Was not the only bad conse quence of prince William's death. Destitute of a male heir, Henry foresaw that the expectations of his subjects, especially the Normans, would be di rected to William Ciito as his successor. Since his queen, Matilda, had died two years before, he mar ried, in the January of n'21, the beautiful Adelais, daughter"], [263, "233 Chap, X 1123 1124 1125 1127, BRITISH ILANDS. daughter of Godfrey, earl of Louvain. This mar riage, proving unfruitful, prevented not the evils apprehended. The Norman barons conspired in fa vour of his rival, in conjunction with Fulk of An jou, whose connexion with him had been dissolved by the loss of prince William. Notwithstanding a most guarded secresy, the plot was discovered by the Eng lissi monarch, who, passing to the continent in i 1 23, attacked them before their preparations were com plete, seized some of their castles, and, in the March of the following year, had the pleasure of finding that they were totally defeated, and their principals captured, by Tancarville, his chamberlain, near Bourg-Teronde. On the reduction of the Norman barons, Fulk, who had a second time contracted one of his daughters to William Clito, dissolved a second time the contract, and made peace with Henry. This monarch found means afterwards to bind effectually Fulk to his interest. He had contracted Matilda, his only legitimate daughter, at the age of eight, in the year n 09, to Henry the fifth, empe ror of Germany, who in 1 1 25 left her a widow without issue. Bringing her to England in it 26, he prevailed on the nobles and prelates of that king dom to swear fealty to her, as his successor, in case of his dying without a legitimate son ; and, in the following year, gave her in marriage to Geossry Plan tagenet, Fulk's eldest son, and heir of all his estates, which were immediately resigned to him by Fulk, who had agreed to the proposal of being made suc cessor to the kingdom of Jerusalem by marrying the daughter of Baldwin its king. The brave William Clito,"], [264, "Si0 HISTORY OF THE Chap. Clito, from a fear of whom king Henry, his uncle, , x- _ concluded this match with Geoffry Plantagenet, had, after the late pacification, been still protected by king Lewis, who married him to a sister of his queen, and vested him with the earldom of Flanders, on the assassination of its earl, Charles the good, by some of his subjects. By executing vengeance on the murderers of his predecessor, William raised against himself the formidable enmity of a faction in favour of a competitor, Theodorick, landgrave of Alsace. At the citadel of Alois, William, after a 1128. battle in which he was victorious, received a wound in the hand from the pike of a common soldier, which proved mortal in five days. On his death bed this magnanimous prince submitted to the hu miliation of writing to Henry, imploring his for giveness, and recommending to his mercy those no bles who had adhered to the son of Robert in oppo sition to the king.

This nobleman was a grandson of William the first by Adela, his fourth daughter ; and was married to a lady of the Saxon blood royal, Matilda, the daughter and heiress of the late earl of Boulogne,"], [267, "BRITISH ILANDS. 243 Chap XI < \u2014 , \u2014 > Boulogne, by Mary of Scotland, a younger sister of the first queen of Henry the first. That he had long entertained a design of aspiring to the throne seems probable from his conduct when he first swore alle giance to the dowager empress Matilda, as his future sovereign. In the performance of that ceremony he insisted, through affectation of zeal for that princess, on having the precedence of Robert earl of Glo cester, the eldest of king Henry's natural sons ; and, on account of Robert's illegitimacy, obtained it by the judgment of the great council, by which he in effect establissied his rank as first prince of the royal blood. As his debt of gratitude to Henry was pro digious, by whose kindness he had been raised to the possession of the vast estates and revenues which he enjoyed ; and as he had thrice, in the sight of the nation, most solemnly sworn to maintain the right of the empress Matilda to the inheritance of her fa ther's dominions ; his guilt was atrocious in wrest ing from that princess and her son, to whom he had also sworn fealty as the successor of Matilda, the sceptre which her father had so earnestly laboured to place securely in her hand. Whatever could be contrived by prudence to in sure the succession to the empress, his daughter, had been performed by Henry ; but all was frustrated by unlucky circumstances, of which earl Stephen with active treachery took advantage, aided by his bro ther Henry, bissiop of Winchester, who also owed all his wealth and dignity to the kindness of the late king. Instantly, on intelligence of this monarch's decease, while in Arijou the empress and her hus- R 2 band,"], [268, "HISTORY OF THE 244 Chap XI band, in Normandy Robert of Gloeester, her natu ral brother and most faithful friend, were employed in affairs of importance, Stephen hasted from Bou logne to London, where the intrigues of his brother operated with success. He was saluted king by the acclamations of the lower citizens, to whom he had rendered himself popular ; and on the twenty-second of December, in the year 1135, was crowne'd with out opposition, as the two men of greatest power in England had been engaged in his favour ; Roger, bishop of Salisoury, chief justiciary and actual re gent of the kingdom ; and William Corboyl, arch bissiop of Canterbury, conscientious but. weak ; the former by being granted, with a secret design of pos terior revocation, whatever he demanded ; the latter by the flagrant perjury of Hugh Bigod, earl of Nor folk, who was suborned to swear, that Henry had in his last moments absolved his subjects from their oaths of allegiance to the empress Matilda and her son. Whatever opposition might have been made was silenced by the power of a faction, strengthened by the royal treasure seized by the usurper in the castle of Winchester, which, beside a vast quantity of jewels and plate, amounted to a hundred thou sand pounds, equivalent to much above a million and a half at present. This he obtained by the perfidious ingratitude of bishop Roger, its trustee, whom the late king had exalted from a Norman curacy to the rank of a prelate and the chief civil power in his realm. i Having converted the treasures of the deceased monarch to the disinheritance of his daughter, a dis- inheritance"], [269, "BRITISH ILANDS. 245 Chap XI 1136 inheritance more easily effected on account of the novelty, perhaps repugnance, of the idea to both Normans and Englissi of a female sovereign, Stephen proceeded to establish his usurpation by the granting of two successive charters, the first at London, the se cond at Oxford, for the correction of oppressive practices, and the extension of privileges, particu larly of the clergy, to whom he made concessions which tended to subvert the monarchal power : but he inserted a salvo of his royal dignity, which might, on occasion, invalidate the whole ; while the clergy in return, in their oath of allegiance, promised him obedience only so long as he should preserve the li berty of the church and the vigour of discipline, by the last words of which was actually meant an almost absolute dominion of their own body over the rest of the nation. By the interest of these ecclesiastics, and such promises of his obedience to the holy see as might be construed into an acknowledgement of temporal subjection, he obtained a bull to ratify his title from pope Innocent the second, who, with in gratitude to the deceased Henry, pronounced the marriage illegal of that monarch with the mother of the empress, on account of her having worn a religious veil, though that marriage had been autho rized by the solemn adjudication of the Englissi hier archy and barons. Normandy, as on former occa sions, and from the fame cause, the desire of union in those who possessed estates in both countries, fol lowed the example of England in recognizing the title of the new monarch, whose usurpation now seemed"], [270, "HISTORY OF THE 246 Chap XI Stephen's character. seemed firmly establissied : but he had widely devi ated from the strait path of honour, and involved himself in the mazes of crooked measures, a per plexing labyrinth, out of which, though he lost not the crown, he found not the means of extrication ; and thus brought perpetual unhappinefs on himself, and unutterable woes on the people of England. While Stephen was making, for the attai.rment of his ends, humiliating concessions with suspicious facility, he was secretly determined on their total revocation when opportunity ssiould occur, already perjured in respect of his engagements in favour of Matilda's succession, and thus having surmounted the barriers of perfidy, the scruples of conscience or terrors of religion. To promise largely with no intention of performance was a quickly discoverable characteristic of this prince, who, if he had not aimed at the crown, might have supported with a fair, and perhaps even splendid reputation the rank to which he had been raised by his royal bene factor ; since, beside his corporal endowments of gracefulness and strength, he was possessed of ge nerosity, clemency, affability, the amiable domestic virtues of connubial and parental tenderness, a free dom from the dismal superstition of the times, a vigorous activity, and a courage in battle the most intrepid imaginable. But he wanted wisdom and its concomitant, honesty : hence he aspired to a usurp ed throne, and gained a difficult situation to which his abilities were inadequate. Destitute of the no bler endowments of the mind, a directing light of the understanding, he employed his good qualities in"], [271, "BRITISH HANDS. 247 Chap XI Difcon. tents. 1137 in a weak or pernicious manner. His courage was exerted without generalship ; his generosity without prudence ; his affability without a manner suffici ently dignified ; his activity without steadiness ; and his parental affection with a vicious indulgence. To be enabled not only to dissolve his engage ments, but even to exercise an arbitrary power over his subjects, he immediately, when he had gained the regal scepter, brought into England a foreign army of licentious mercenaries, soldiers of fortune, who, to the general annoyance, without attachment to any cause or country, were ready to follow for pay and plunder the ensigns of any chief. Some Englissi of similar manners he joined to these bands, who were chiefly natives of Brabant, Flanders, and Brittany ; and on their leader, to the mortification of his barons, he placed his confidence, William of Ipres, an illegitimate cousin-german of Charles the good, earl of Flanders, whose murder he had abet ted in the hope of succeeding to his place, but had been expelled for his crime by William Clito. With a strange inconsistency, Stephen, while he so dis trusted his nobles as to employ foreign troops to keep them in subjection, permitted them to build castles, and thus to render themselves formidable to him, under a notion of defense against his enemies. The growing discontents were watchfully observed, and secretly fomented, by Robert, earl of Glocester, who from the necessity of affairs had submitted to the usurper, but had taken the oath of allegiance under this reserve, \" that he ssiould be no longer bound by it than the engagements made to him by the"], [272, "HISTORY OF THE 248 Chap XI fcnnilh war. 1138 the king ssiould be maintained.\" Afterwards in Normandy, into which both he and his new sove reign had passed from England in the spring of 1 137, he escaped a plot for the seizure of his person, he renewed a hollow reconciliation with Stephen, who who gave him his oath, with as little sincerity on one side as confidence on the other, that he would never again entertain such a design against him. At the end of that year the usurper was recalled into England by the alarms of a Scottish invasion, which he might reasonably suppose abetted secretly by seve ral of his barons. David, king of Scotland, uncle to the empress Matilda, had, in the life of her father, in consi deration of his fiefs in England, sworn future alle giance to her, as an English baron ; and had, on the usurpation of Stephen, invaded the north of England in support of her claim, in 1136; but, disappointed in his expectations of being joined by English nobles, and opposed by Stephen with a su perior army, he had agreed to a peace, by which his son Henry, prince of Scotland, obtained the earldom of Huntingdon, together with Carlisle, un der homage to the English crown. Doubtless in cited by private intelligence, David assembled a nu merous army, at the end of the succeeding year, to seize Northumberland for prince Henry, on an ill-founded claim of inheritance ; but, when most of the Englissi barons appeared against him in arms at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, he consented to a truce till the arrival of Stephen from Normandy. On the re jection of his demand by that monarch, war was declared,"], [273, "BRITISH ILANDS. 219 declared, the invasion was made, and the country was Chap. ravaged, as far as the Tyne, with a cruelty not fur- passed. The villages, farmhouses, and churches were plundered and consumed with fire : men feeble with age or sickness were massacred in their beds, priests at the altar, and infants were tost for sport into the air, and received as they fell, on the points of spears : women in the state of pregnancy or childbed were butchered with circumstances too horrible for narra tion: and the widows and virgins, tied together with cords, and stripped naked, were driven into slavery in crowds; and, when they were fainting with an guissi and fatigue, were goaded forward by the lances of the barbarians. That acts of so atrocious a na ture, such as were at other times practiced by the Scots in their incursions, mould have been perpe trated by troops led by David, a prince of uncom mon mildness and humanity, in a province which he wras endeavouring to annex to his dominions, might seem a paradox, if we wer? not informed that these troops were irregular far beyond his power of re straint, particularly the chief actors in these horrible scenes, who hardly owned him as their monarch, the inhabitants of Galloway, which at that time comprehended the south-western parts of Scotland between the Clyde and the English borders. When Stephen, who had been detained in the Revolts in south by some local oppositions, particularly in the \"san \" siege of Bedford-castle, marched at length with su perior force against the Scots, David made a quick retreat, and was pursued into his own dominions with devastation by the English, who were however soon"], [274, "2 _0 Chap, XI Battle of the Stan dard. 1138 HISTORY OF THE soon led back to their own country by their king, perhaps from the dread of a conspiracy in his camp. His design of a second invasion of Scotland was pre vented by disquietudes among his Englissi subjects, which role to the alarming magnitude of open revolts. Robert, earl of Glocester, judging the state of affairs ripe for the execution of his plan, sent from Normandy to Stephen a renunciation of his fealty, and produced a decree of the pope, how obtained is not known, enjoining him \" to observe the oath which he had taken in the presence of his father,\" his oath to Matilda ; which decree contained a virtual absolu tion of the barons both of Normandy and England from their engagements to the usurper. This was quickly followed by the defection of several towns and fortresses, as Bristol, Dover, Leeds, Hereford, and Shrewssiury ; which gave such employment to the arms of Stephen, that king David found an opportunity of a more formidable invasion of the English territories than before. The design was of the Scottissi monarch, while he ssiould conquer or depopulate the north of England, to make a diver sion on that side, which might enable the friends of Matilda to act elsewhere with success, and at length to form a junction with his forces to the overwhelm ing of Stephen. Such might have been the event, if the hideous devastations of his barbarous troops had not converted many friends of the empress into her enemies, and forced the northern Englissi into desperate measures of defense. The ferocious Gallowegians of David's army had wasted the west of Yorkssiire, had cut to pieces at Clithero a body of Englissi forces, and had rejoined their"], [275, "25! Chap XI BRITISH ILANDS. their monarch, who had with his other troops been employed in sieges, and who now found himself at the head of above twenty-six thousand men, includ ing Englissi cavalry, friends of Matilda, when the northern barons of England, with little aid from their monarch, were assembling an army at York, to protect the country from total ruin. Prodigiously inferior in number of men, these barons, encou raged and assisted by the aged archbissiop of York, taking post at Cuton-moor, near North Alerton, made use of every imaginable device to inspire one another and their soldiers with desperate resolution ; mutually pledging themselves by a solemn oath that they would either conquer or die together, bringing with them to the field all the parissi priests of the archbishop's diocese, dressed in their holy vestments, with crucifixes in their hands ; erecting of a peculiar kind, a mast of a ssiip on a wheel car riage, with a silver pix on the top containing a con secrated wafer, and under the pix three banners de dicated to Saint Peter with two other saints ; and haranguing the soldiers from the foot of the mast in words best calculated to excite revenge, a confidence in the protection of Heaven, and a conviction that inevitable ruin must be the consequence of defeat. In the August of 1 138, on the twenty-second day, the English having sent the horses of their cavalry to some distance behind, and having formed their whole force in one compact phalanx of infantry, with archers intermixed, awaited the onset of the Scots, which was commenced by the Gallowegians with horrendous yells, and so fierce impetuosity, that they"], [276, "HISTORY OF THE 252 Chap, XI they forced the Englissi pikemen in the front to re coil ; but they were quickly repulsed by the men at arms, against whose iron armour their lances were broken. To the succour of these, galled by the Englissi archers, and unable, with swords and lea theren bucklers, to maintain their ground against superior arms, Henry, prince of Scotland, advanced with the second line, composed, in great part, of Englissi and lowland Scots, cavalry and infantry ; and charged with such fury, that in one place he forced his way through the phalanx, and pursued the guard appointed for the horses of the dismounted cavalry. In the decisive moment, when victory seemed ready to declare against the Englissi, a sol dier, whose name is not recorded, raised a head to the view of his comrades, declaring with snouts that it was the head of the Scottissi monarch. Closing their ranks, and charging with redoubled ardour, they routed the Gallowegians ; drove to flight, at one onset, the third line, consisting of Lothian and Highland infantry ; and were prevented only by the want of horsemen from killing or capturing David himself, as his body of reserve, or fourth line, in which he was posted, fled without sighting. Prince Henry, returning from his ill-timed pursuit, found the battle decided, and with difficulty escaped to Carlisle, where his father had arrived two days be fore him. The Scottissi infantry were so dispersed and slaughtered in their return homeward, that more than half of their army appears to have been lost by this discomfiture ; while of the Englissi very few were slain, and among these was only one gentle man of distinction. As"], [277, "BRITISH HANDS. 253 As the Englissi monarch, though successful in the Chap. south, where he had reduced some important for- ' tresses, unwisely neglected to pursue the advantage , of this great victory, David, finding the means of quarts collecting another army, was soon again in condi- clergy. tionof acting offensively on the borders ; and, in the 113a. April of the following year, by the mediation of his niece, the queen of Stephen, he concluded an ad vantageous peace, by which, beside the fiefs pos sessed before by him in England, prince Henry ob tained the earldom of Northumberland. Not less than to David might this treaty have proved favour able to Stephen, who was thereby enabled to crussi the feeble remains of the empress Matilda's party in England : but, by a quarrel with the church, he added such a force to that party as drove him almost to the brink of destruction. Roger, bissiop of Salissiury, had so availed him self of his own situation, and that of a usurper de pending on his aid, as to have engrossed to himself and his immediate relatives the prime places of power and emolument in the kingdom ; and, as if he meant to secure by arms a surreptitious authority, had built some castles with a strength and magnifi cence beyond the common standard. Distrusting a man by whose perfidy himself had acquired a crown, or coveting his treasure in financial exigency, or de termined from the beginning to cancel those con cessions which he had unwillingly made for the at tainment of his unrighteous ends, Stephen secretly formed the dangerous resolution of seizing the castles of this prelate and his family. At Oxford, at the time"], [278, "HISTORY OF THE 254 Chap, XI time of session of a great council there assembled, on occasion of a riot, perhaps contrived by the ene mies of Roger, between the retinues of his nephews and of some noblemen, this prelate was arrested, with his natural son the lord chancellor, and his ne phew, the bissiop of Lincoln. By exposing the Vfto former to the garrison of the castle at the Devises, where the bissiop of Ely, another nephew, had taken refuge, and by threatening to starve the bissiop to death and to hang the chancellor on a gibbet, the furrendry of that fortress, one of the strongest in Europe, was obtained by the king and his foreign mercenaries, who in like manner gained possession of the two castles which belonged to the bishop of Lincoln, and of the three which remained to bissiop Roger. The treasures of this prelate were seized and confiscated, amounting in the castle of Devises, beside the sums elsewhere found, to forty thousand marks, equal in value to between four and five hun dred thousand pounds at present. He died soon after, frantic from grief, a melancholy victim of inordinate ambition, pursued through perjury and the basest in gratitude, an ingratitude punissied by the very man to promote whose usurpation he had become cri minal. Before he was reduced to such despair as to cause this degree of frenzy, an unconstitutional attempt had been made, in opposition to this unconstitutional act of the king, for the compensation and satisfac tion of Roger and his relatives. So flagrant an out rage committed against men of dignity so high in church and slate, without any proof, or form of law,"], [279, "BRITISH ILANDS. 255 Chap. XI. 1139 law, might cause a just alarm to all persons for their safety, and might properly have been made a sub ject of complaint in the great council of the nation, or what we may call even then the parliament. In stead of this, as perhaps the church was deemed the only power capable of repressing the arbitrary vio lence of the king, a synod was convened, on the thirtieth of August, at Winchester, by Henry, bi ssiop of that see, the brother of Stephen, who, as legate of the pope, cited that monarch to appear and to account for his conduct. By a profuse liberality, a princely magnificence, an intrepid courage, an un common acuteness, address, and dexterity, this pre late had animated and directed the faction to which his brother owed his crown ; had been afterwards im prudently neglected by Stephen ; and had at length, on experience of that prince's incapacity, resolved to put himself at the head of that party, which he might reasonably expect to have ultimately the pre dominance. To interdict and hinder the proceedings of this assembly, which tended to the subversion of civil go vernment, would have been full as easy and safe to the king as the acts of illegal violence which had given occasion to the meeting : but, unsteady in re solution, or erroneous in judgment, he virtually ac knowledged the jurisdiction of the court by sending noblemen to plead his cause before it. By canons, which himself had sanctioned as the laws of the realm, his conduct was highly criminal ; and little of a plausible colour was pleaded in his excuse, ex cept what was advanced by the archbissiop of Rouen, \" that"], [280, "o5S HISTORY OF THE Chap. \u00ab that ecclesiastics had not a right to the possession __^__, of castles by the rules of the church ; and that, if they had been allowed such a privilege, they ought, in a time of danger, to surrender them for the public safety into the king's hands.\" As Stephen could have no reliance on either the justice of his cause or the favour of the synod, he put an end to its debates by an appeal to the pope, and thus further debased the majesty of his crown. civil war. Though by this appeal, and by violent menaces 1 13!'- to intimidate the prelates, the king escaped a sentence of excommunication, he soon found himself deeply endangered by the general disaffection excited against him. Encouraged by intelligence of this disaffec- tion, the empress Matilda ventured at length to ap- pear in England at the head of her adherents. As a large armament could not easily elude the fleet of Stephen, ssie came with so small a force as only a hundred and forty knights ; and, in consequence of a previous intrigue, was, immediately on her land- ing, on the thirtieth of September, in 1139, re- ceived into Arundel castle by Adelais, the widow of Henry the first, who acted thus from affection to the memory of that monarch, though ssie now was the wife of a second hussiand, the earl of Sussex. The castle was quickly besieged by Stephen ; but that prince was persuaded by bishop Henry, his brother, who still pretended attachment to his cause, to per mit Matilda to join her natural brother, Robert, earl of Glocester, who had accompanied her from France, and had departed with twelve knights to Bristol to raise commotions in the west. According to this advice,"], [281, "BRITISH ILANDS. 257 advice, given under the fallacious idea, that the Chap. sister and brother could be more easily subdued while X1j they were together than while they were separate, Stephen gave hostages and his oath to the empress, and sent her under the care of his brother and the earl of Meulant, with a body of his own troops, who conducted her in safety to Bristol. This very strange fact, the conveyance thus of an enemy and competitor for the crown, who might otherwise have been captured, to the very place where that enemy would be most of all formidable, might be rejected as fabulous, if it were not attested beyond a doubt ; and seems not otherwise accountable than from insi dious counsel on one side, and on the other a ro mantic spirit of chivalry, which, amid all the bar barism of the times, paid to the fair sex a most lau- dable respect. Robert of Glocester, a man of great abilities, Miserable and inflexible integrity, recorded as the most virtu- E'g1\u00b0ld> ous of all who were engaged in the factions of that ni.0 period, exerted himself with so much vigour, that, soon afcer the arrival of Matilda at Bristol, he saw her mistress of great part of England, though desti- tute of money and foreign aid, while Stephen em- ployed against her the treasures which he had seized from the prelates. The war was extended into all parts of the kingdom with such devastation and cir- cumstances of cruelty, that the year eleven hundred and forty is accounted the most calamitous ever ex perienced by the Englissi nation.

The farm-houses and villages were deserted : com merce was totally suspended : the merchants were re duced to emigration or beggary ; and such multitudes perissied by famine and other causes, that England seems to have lost above a third of its population. Notwithstanding this deplorable havoc, no other mi litary operations were performed than ssiirmissies and sieges of castles ; but in the following year actions of greater magnitude had place, which might seem to bring the contest nearer to decision. The castle of Lincoln, which had been with-held Battle by Stephen from William de Raumara, earl of Lin- coln, was taken by artifice by this baron and his half-brother, Ranulph, earl of Chester, to whom, as they were his partizans, the king, though griev- ously offended, confirmed the possession, with new marks of his favour, as proofs of complete forgive- ness : but, informed by the citizens of Lincoln, that the two earls, confident of his friendship, were un- provided for defense, he suddenly invested the castle, amid the solemnities of Christmas week, without re- gard to the religious cessation of arms usually ob- served at that season. Ranulph, by some means ef- fecting his escape, declared for the empress, and joined his troops to those of Robert of Glocester, who marched with alacrity to relieve the castle, as his daughter, the wife of Ranulph, was there be sieged.

The army of the west, though inferior in number of effective men, and fa tigued by a long march, advanced intrepidly to the combat through a dangerous ford, without repose or refressiment, marssialled in like manner in three di visions, beside a body of Welch, stationed at some distance on the flank, separate from the line of battle. Robert and the king commanded, each in the center, the opposite hosts. A wing of the former, composed entirely of knights and barons who had been deprived of their lands and honours by Ste phen, began the combat with desperate fury, throw ing their lances to the ground, and closing instantly with their swords, which so astonissied their oppo nents that they were immediately routed. The fo reign mercenaries in the other wing of the royal army drove the Welch from the field ; but, in the disorder occasioned by this conflict, they were charg ed by the opposite wing commanded by Ranulph, and totally defeated.

With a so lemn excommunication of all the king's adherents the proceedings terminated of this unprecedented and singular assembly, which disposed of the king dom by the sole authority of the Englissi ecclesiastics and of the pope's legate. Matilda was at length ad mitted, a little before midsummer, into London, and would soon have been acknowledged throughout all England, if ssie had not confirmed old enemies, and created new, by her imperious conduct and impetu ous passions, to the restraint of which, in even the slightest degree, ssie would suffer no advice. Such enmity was excited, that, while ssie was preparing, in full confidence, for her coronation, ssie was assailed by a sudden tempest, which drove her forever from even the prospect of the throne. Another Matilda, the queen of Stephen, cqusin german to the empress, but of an opposite character, amiable and gentle, had, on the submission of almost all the rest of England, still retained possession of Kent, into which William of Ipres, with most of the foreign mercenaries, had retired after the defeat at Lincoln. This princess requested the liberation of her husoand, on the hard condition, for which ample security was offered, of his resignation of the crown, and of his retiring, for the remaining part of his life, into a convent, or to the Holy Land. On the disdainful rejection of this modest proposal by"], [287, "BRITISH HANDS. 263 by the empress, who seems to have acted on the vin- Chap. dictive plan of imprisoning him till death, the queen , AA. saw the necessity of acting with vigour. While to the citizens of London, exasperated by the tyrannic insolence and exactions of the empress, she repre sented, by secret agents, the facility of seizing the person of that arrogant female, and of thereby pro curing the king's liberty, ssie ssiewed them how for midable ssie might be as their foe, by commanding her troops to advance and to ravage their lands. To free themselves at once from the ruinous taxation of a hated party, and the ravages of a favourite, the citizens conspired to seize the empress, who, in formed of the plot, effected her escape, not without much danger, to Oxford. When the tide of public affection was observed to siege of change in favour of Stephen, whose sufferings .er'\"c had excited the pity of the people, as he had been iui. ignominioufly put in irons, bissiop Henry, who was also personally disgusted, resolved to espouse again the party of his brother.

When, on the eve of Holy-cross, the fourteenth of September, ac cording to the custom then observed in the Latin church, bishop Henry had proclaimed, after sunset, a suspension of arms, a plan was arranged by earl Robert for her escape. With the utmost secrecy and expedition ssie fled at the dawn toward Glocester by Ludgerssiall and the Devizes, accompanied by David, the Scottissi king ; and was followed more slowly by Robert himself with the rearguard of her army. Notwithstanding the religious truce the pursuit was hot, and Robert was overtaken at Stockbridge on the river Test, where he made so brave a stand as to enable his sister to escape to Glocester ; but him self remained a prisoner with the enemy. This nobleman, from respect to his exalted cha racter, was treated with gentleness in confinement ; and, when neither by the most splendid offers, nor severe menaces, he could be drawn from his adhe rence to the empress, an agreement was concluded for the liberation of both him and the king by an exchange of the one for the other singly, a subject for a sovereign, a singular fact. For the reinstate ment of Stephen, who, after an imprisonment of nine months, was liberated about the first of No vember, bissiop Henry convened at Westminster, on the"], [289, "25i Chap, XL 11 12 Siege of Oxford cas tle. 1142, BRITISH ILANDS. the seventh of the following month, a legatine synod, in which, when he had read a letter from the pope in condemnation of the king's captivity, and had made a speech in defense of his own actions, he pro nounced, in the name-of God and of the sovereign pontiff, a command, which was unanimously obeyed, that king Stephen ssiould be acknowledged, and the adherents of the empress, whom he styled only coun tess of Anjou, ssiould be excommunicated. While by the\" inclemency of winter, the religious truce commonly then observed from the beginning of Lent till the end of Easter-week, and a subsequent sick ness of the king, the operations of war were sus pended, the empress dispatched earl P.obert to France for the purpose of persuading Geoffry, her hussiand, to come to her aid in England. This prince, who had, in Stephen's reverse of fortune, extended his dominion over the greater part of Normandy, seems to have been prevented from complying with this urgent request by his knowledge of his wife's im perious temper, to whom he might not choose to become a subject, and who probably would not admit him to a ssiare of sovereign power. He consented only to send his eldest son, Henry Plantagenet, a boy in his ninth year, with the earl, who was obliged to hasten his return to England by alarming news from that quarter. Stephen, having regained his health, had recom menced the war with the utmost activity, had re duced Wareham in Dorsctssiire, and other fortresses in his way thence to Oxford, before which he ap peared on the twenty-fifth of September. That city, standing"], [290, "*66 Chap XI HISTORY OF THE standing on the northern bank of the Thames, is da scribed as at that time surrounded with waters un fordable; and had, on account of its situation, and the extraordinary strength of its castle, been chosen for the residence of the empress. On the king's ar rival at the stream, the garrison sallying from the town, annoyed his army, from the opposite side, with soowers of arrows, and his ears with oppro brious language. Enraged, he plunged his horse into the water, at the head of his cavalry, and gain ed the opposite bank by swimming. The garrison, astonissied, fled at the first charge. The assailants, entering the city with them, killed or captured all who escaped not into the castle. The king strained every nerve for the conquest of this fortress, where his rival was enclosed, and could not be diverted from this primary object by the progress of earl Ro bert, who had reduced Wareham castle and the ile of Portland. This nobleman at length resolved on the desperate attempt of assaulting Stephen's army within the fortifications of the tov/n ; but, when he had assembled all his force for that purpose at Ciren cester, he was joyfully astonissied by the \"news of the safe arrival of the empress at Wallingford. In what manner ssie effected this extraordinary escape is un known, though a romantic story is recorded, that ssie and three knights, clothed in white robes, passed unobserved over the snow which covered the ground. To attempt a flight, by any possible means, from im pending captivity, after a siege of three months, com ported well with the spirit of this female, who, with excessive pride, possessed a masculine courage ; but to"], [291, "BRITISH ILANDS. 2.57 to an intrigue neve: divulged, with some in Ste- Chap, phen's army, her safety onthis occasion seems chiefly \\ys^^ aseribable. The reduction of this fortress, which immediately Mi.celi_.re surrendered, was, notwithstanding Matilda's escape, \"^JJ,* of importance to Stephen, who seemed to have ob- 1142. tained so decided a superiority, as to insure to him ll^ in a ssiort time the dominion of all England. But his progress was slow ; and, on the first of July in the following year, 1 143, he was surprised and rout ed, by earl P.obert, at Wilton, with the loss of all his plate and baggage, and a narrow escape of him self from death or captivity. His fortune so de- n43, dined, that Matilda, in this very strangely fluctuat ing war, soon saw herself mistress of half the king- dom. So languid, however, had become the ope rations of mutual hostility, while both parties were exhausted, the partizans of neither cordially attach ed, and famine with pestilence wasting the country, that we find a thousand men at arms considered as a great army by historians of that time. After a se- 1146. ries of unimportant actions, the conquest of Faring don castle, in the spring of 1146, by Stephen, was of such consequence as to turn the tide again in his favour. Many of the opposite party deserted to him, among whom was the powerful earl of Chester, and a younger son of earl Robert, who made war with such acrimony as not to spare even his father's lands in his ravages. Robert alone remained unalterably firm in the sinking cause of the empress, neither moved by the prospects of advantage to himself, nor by resentment at the ruinous perversenefs of her temper."], [292, "2o8 Chap.

When a fever deprived her of that admi rable man in the November of that year, her danger became so imminent, that ssie retired, in less than four months after, to Normandy, of the whole of which Geoffry, her hulband, had gained possession, and into which her son, prince Henry, had been sent before. The authority of Stephen was now in a train of being universally acknowledged in Eng land, when opposition was encreased and protracted by his imprudence. Instead of complying with the request of the earl of Chester to assist him in repress ing the incursions of the Welch, he seized the per son of that baron in a great council at Northampton, on an unwarranted suspicion of disloyalty, and by the terror of death, in a dungeon where he was loaded with irons, compelled him to resign the castle of Lincoln. Ele obtained by a like violence all the castles of the earl of Hertford, and made the fame attempt on the earl of Pembroke, who escaped. Converted into obstinate enemies against a king in whom no confidence could be placed, these power ful barons continued the war in favour of the em press, from no other motive than hostility to her rival. The enemies of the king were much encouraged by the hope of gaining the church to favour their party. The great advantage of the legatine com mission held by his brother Henry, who thereby go verned the clergy of England, had been lost in the year 1143, by the death of pope Innocent the se cond, as its renewal was refused by the succeeding pontiffs. In a council of bissiops convoked at Rheims, in"], [293, "BRITISH ILANDS. 269 in 1 147, pope Eugenius the third pronounced Wil- Chap. Ham, arch bissiop of York, deposed from that see, ,__ [^ for no other reason than that he had been elected in consequence of his being recommended to the chapter by king Stephen. By a mandate from his Holiness the chapter proceeded to a new election, without con sulting the king. The person chosen by the majo rity was rejected by the sovereign pontiff; and ano ther, recommended by a faction in the chapter, was by him confirmed and consecrated. Such were the encroachments made on the Englissi church and mo narchy in a weak and disturbed reign ! Theobald, archbissiop of Canterbury, who had, in defiance of the king's orders, attended the council of Rheims, was so intimidated by his menaces, as to absent him self some time from England : but, enraged by the seizure of his temporalities, and by severe exactions from his tenants, he returned, and laid all parts of the kingdom, where Stephen was acknowledged, under an interdict. As this ecclesiastical sentence, of which I shall have occasion to speak more parti cularly hereafter, was then quite new to the Englissi, it caused much terror ; and Stephen, who commonly began a dispute with spirit, and ended it with mean ness, yielded to the prelate, who was conducted to his see with triumphal pomp ; a fatal precedent, which incurably wounded the royal authority. This prelate and the pope are supposed to have invasion of concurred with those Englissi barons, who were in Henry. arms against their king, to encourage the re-appear- 1149. ance of prince Henry in England, who had now arrived at the age of sixteen, and to whom the em- press,"], [294, "evo Cm ap XI Kis second \u25a0o'.aiion. 1 153. HISTORY OF THE press, his mother, conscious of the hatred of the Englissi to her person, had resigned her pretensions to the throne. He arrived in England with a chosen body of troops in 1149, and proceeded through the western counties to Carlisle, where David, king of Scotland, conferred on him the honour of knight hood, on the twenty-second of May, an honour then regarded as necessary for princes, as soon as they were capable of bearing arms. Having con firmed to David, free of homage to the Englissi crown, the dominion of the three most northern counties of England, which that monarch had seized after his escape from Winchester, he advanced to Lancaster in conjunction with the Scottissi army ; but was disappointed, from unknown causes, by the Englissi barons, who had promised to join him there with their forces. As David, in consequence of this failure, declined to act offensively, the prince re turned to France in the beginning of the following year, without having been allowed an opportunity of performing any splendid action, but leaving such impressions of his merit and capacity as tended pow erfully to strengthen his interest in England. He had resolved to revisit this kingdom soon, but was long detained on the continent by wars with the French monarch, Lewis the seventh, by the death of his father, Geoffry, in the September of 1151, and by his marriage with Eleanor, heiress of Gnienne and Poictou. In the year 1152 Stephen attempted to procure the coronation of his son Eustace, as his successor, a measure at that time unprecedented : but the bishops, commanded by the pope not to raise to the"], [295, "m Chap XI BRITISH ILANDS. the throne the son of a perjured usurper, could not by the most violent menaces be forced into compli ance with the royal will : and the king was obliged to yield again to the primate by threats of an inter dict and excommunication. Having at length conclu ded a truce with Lewis, prince Henry, who was now duke of Normandy, and possessed of other extensive dominions in France, resolved to put himself at the head of his partizans in England, who were danger ously pressed by Stephen's arms ; but, from fear of another war on the continent, he brought with him only three thousand infantry and a hundred and forty knights. Landing with these, on the sixth of Ja nuary, in 1153, he quickly revived the spirits of his Englissi adherents by the vigour of his opera tions. He reduced Malmfbury, baffling the king's army, who attempted to raise the siege ; relieved the important castle of Wallingford ; and, on the second approach of Stephen, he advanced with great ala crity, though inferior in number, to give him battle. When the two armies, encamped at the interval of only a quarter of a mile, were preparing to engage, the earl of Arundel, after doubtless a private com munication with most of them, represented to the assembled barons in Stephen's camp the horrid cala mities sustained by the kingdom from this protracted contest, and the probability of their much longer continuance, unless the Englissi in both armies would combine to force the two rival princes to an agree ment, whereby Stephen ssiould possess the crown for life, and Henry ssiould be appointed his successor, with such a present share of power as might secure his"], [296, "K2 HISTORY OF THE Chap, his succession. These sentiments, joyfully approved XL by the barons, the gentry, and Englissi soldiers, were communicated to the king, who, confounded by a demand which he was unable to resist, con- sented to an armistice and conference with the duke, while prince Eustace was speechless with rage, and the foreign mercenaries stood in astonissiment and suspense, fearing, if they ssiould interpose, a junction of the Englissi in both armies against them. The duke, with the utmost reluctance, when the Englissi in his army had caught the fame spirit, agreed to a conference with the king, which was held by them standing on opposite sides of the Thames, where the stream is very narrow, without any auditors. What- ever was their conversation, the truce soon expired, and hostilities were renewed ; but these were lan- guid, as the barons continued to negociate. The duke, by gracious acts, particularly by restoring to the proprietors the plunder collected by his troops, gained friends continually. Prince Eustace, a youth of great military prowess, but dissolute and intract- able, who had collected a separate array with a fierce determination to prevent an adjustment, died in Au- gust of a fever and frenzy, caused by mental agita- tion and the heat of the weather. By this, and the death of some others, the chief obstacles were re- moved, and an accommodation was made, chiefly by the mediation of bissiop Henry, in an assembly at Winchester, at the end of November, and soon aster confirmed by a mure general parliament at Oxford. In"], [297, "BRITISH ILANDS. 273 In the charter, or public notification of this agree- Chap. ment, on the earl of Arundel's plan, the duke was declared the successor of the king by a kind of adop- Death f tion, and the latter promised to act by the advice of Stephen. 1154 the former, while himself would exercise royal jus tice throughout all the realm.

Hen ry, having gently, yet strongly, remonstrated, was recalled to France a little before the Easter of 1 154, where his arrangements had, in his absence, baffled the efforts of Lewis, and where he soon concluded an advantageous peace with that monarch. A war, which in all probability would have terminated with the ruin of Stephen, was prevented by his death, occasioned by the piles and iliac passion, on the twenty-fifth of October in the fame year ; an event entirely unexpected, as he was only in his fiftieth year, robust, and not addicted to intemperance. His queen had expired before him, and he left only two legitimate children, a son named William, and a daughter Mary. Vol. I. T CHAP."], [298, "HISTORY OF THE 274 Chap XII.

JlTENRY the second was the first of a long and illustrious line of Englissi monarchs bearing the sur name of Plantagenet, a surname said to have been derived from a sprig of heath or broom, commonly worn on the crest of the helmet by Geoffry his fa ther. Born at Mans, in the March of i 133, Henry had been invested with the Norman dutchy in 1 150 ; had inherited by his father's demise, in the succeed ing year, the earldoms of Anjou, 7'ouraine, and Maine; and had, in 1152, by his marriage with Eleanor, obtained possession of Poictou, Guienne, and Gascony ; so that his feudal dominion in the west of France extended from the British channel to the Py renees. This lady, the heiress of these provinces, had been married, in 1137, to Lewis the seventh, the French monarch, and had afterwards accom panied him in a crusade to the East, where he had been so weak as to conceive a jealousy against her without any discoverable grounds. A mutual dis- like"], [299, "BRITISH ILANDS. 27.' like ensued, which terminated at length in a divorce, Chap. and a consequent restitution to her of her territorial , 1I-_, dowry, six weeks before her marriage with Henry, 1136. who was too wise to be deterred by false aspersions on her character ; and who, beside the gratification of his ambition, may have been enamoured of her person, notwithstanding her being eleven years older, as ssie had a considerable ssiare of beauty, still more of vivacity, with a majestic deportment. Engaged in the siege of a revolted castle in Normandy, when the news arrived of Stephen's death, Henry perse vered until its reduction, was afterwards delayed by foul weather, and arrived not before the seventh of December in England, where, by the public affec tion, the dread of his power, and the vigilant fide lity of primate Theobald, his enemies had been pre vented from attempting to raise commotions. He was rectived by the nation as its deliverer, and his journey was a continued triumphal procession from Winchester to London, where, on the nineteenth of the fame month, he was crowned without any other capitulation than the usual oath of r.nglissi kings. Eager to remove the causes of national misery, The first and resolved to rest the stability of his government re;gri. on the most solid supports, the laws of his kingdom 1155. and the affection of his people, he proceeded with- out delay to the execution of the most important measures, not without the previous approbation of his parliament.

Their general, William of Ipres, who had been loaded with wealth, and honoured with the earldom of Kent and other dignities, was so affected by this great reverse of his fortune, that he became a monk in a monastery in Flanders, where he expired in seven years after. All the castles erected in the reign of Stephen were demolissied, except a few which were judged useful for national defense. The estates and fortresses, which had, in the reign of Stephen, been alienated from the royal demesne, to the debilitating impoverishment of the monarchy, were next, ex cept those which had been granted to the church, resumed from the possessors, without distinction be tween the adherents and opponents of the late usur per. The demand of furrendry, though with great reluctance and some delay, was obeyed without op position, except by the earl of Albermarle in York ssiire, and Roger de Mortimer and the earl of Here ford on the borders of Wales, who confederated for resistance. But the first submitted on the king's ap proach with a formidable army, and the third by the persuasion of Gilbert Foliot, bissiop of Hereford, his relative. Mortimer persevered, till his three for tresses, vigorously assailed at once, were forced to surrender. In the siege of one of these at Bridge north the life of Henry was preserved in an extraor dinary manner. Hubert de Saint-Clare, standing by his side, observed an arrow aimed at his breast, and could"], [301, "BRITISH ILANDS. 277 could save him only by stepping before him, and re- Chap. ceiving it in his own. He expired recommending his only daughter to his sovereign, who educated her affectionately, and gave her in marriage to William de Longueville, a nobleman of high distinction, on con- dition of his taking the name of Saint-Clare. As these were fully pardoned, and deprived of Hischarac- nothing more than what had been required by de- cree of parliament, king Henry displayed, in a high degree, in the commencement of his reign, the royal virtues of firmness and clemency, on the union of which the honour and prosperity of a government are chiefly supported. In the endowments of his mind nature had been happily seconded by educa- tion, as his father, though not of ssiining talents, was a man of a very sound understanding, cautious, more a statesman than a warrior ; and as his maternal uncle, Robert, earl of Glocester, the brightest ex- ample of magnanimity and virtuous conduct, the cultivator and patron of literature, most rare in no- bles of that age, had, in the four years spent under his care at Bristol, infused into him sentiments of the most salutary kind, which, on account of his being removed from the poisonous flattery of a court, were impressed much more deeply. A fondness of let- ters he retained ever after to his great advantage, as, from his knowledge of history, he could readily apply the events of times past, as well as his own experience, to the regulation of his conduct. He had also early practice to forward the attainment of political knowledge, raised, as duke of Normandy, to the exercise of dominion, at the age of seven- teen."], [302, "HISTORY OF THE 278 Chap XII His a.imi, nislration. teen. In the words of Hume, \" his character, in private as well as public life, is almost without a blemissi ; and he seems to have possessed every ac complissiment both of body and mind which makes a man either estimable or amiable. He loved peace, but possessed both bravery and conduct in war ; was provident without timidity ; severe in the execution of justice without rigour ; and temperate without austerity.\" He bore in a general survey of his cha racter a striking resemblance to his maternal grand father, Henry the first. He was inferior to that monarch in command of temper, but superior in degree of clemency and generosity ; less free from faults, but possessed of greater virtues, especially an active benevolence to all mankind, and a cordial love of his people. As that prince also, he was of a middle stature, agile, robust, of a pleasing coun tenance and demeanour. In the administration of his government he fol lowed the system of the same great ancestor in ex tending the effective protection of the law equally to all ranks, and carried it much farther in the ex tinguissiing of faction, and the abolissiing of distinc tion between the Normans and Englissi. While he eminently rewarded the zeal of those who had been the most faithful supports of his party, he behaved in such manner to the former opponents of his mo ther and himself, even the most violent, as to con vince them that, by their consent to his succession, they had obtained his complete forgiveness, and might, by their future loyalty, aspire to the highest degree of his favour. From a maxim transmitted to"], [303, "BRITISH HANDS. 279 Chap, XII His in.' provement of the laws, to his successors by William the first, the Englissi had hitherto been excluded from all dignities, lest they might otherwise find at some time an opportu nity of depriving the Normans, as they had already deprived the Danish race of princes of the crown: but Elenry promoted merit without regard to differ ence of blood, actuated by a nobscr policy, sensible of his own descent by his mother from the Saxon line of kings, and knowing that many nobles and prelates then in England, considered as Norm-ms, were in like manner descended from Englissi ladies. He was indeed unfortunate in the first choice which he made of an unmixed Englissiman for promotion, the famous Becket ; but this detracted not from the merit of the system. For the strict and impartial execution of justice he made frequent visits, in the course of his reign, to the several counties, examin ing personally the conduct of judges and other offi cers. By the restoration of order and security the kingdom by swift gradation recovered from a most deplorable state of wretchedness, depravity of mo rals, and depopulation. Not only in the enforcement of the existing laws, but also in the improvement of the general system by the enaxion of new, was the attention of this prince engaged at several opportunities in his long reign. In his first outset he granted to the nation a charter of liberties, confirming the charter of Henry the first. To six a uniformity of juridical procedures throughout the kingdom, and to prevent the injus tice of local factions and of baronial power, he re vived and establissied an institution, which had before been"], [304, "HISTORY OF THE 280 Chap, XII I \u2014 , \u2014 I His mil; tary inlt.tu lions. been but occasionally or irregularly put in practice, the sending of itinerent judges every year into the several counties for the hearing of civil and criminal causes. For this purpose he divided England at one time into 'six, at another into four circuits, appoint ing justices to perambulate each. His laws had a general tendency to the protection of the lower from the oppression of the higher classes ; to the substitu tion of corporal in place of pecuniary punissiments ; and to the gradual disuse of barbarous modes of trial, inveterate by custom, the ordeals of water, fire, and judicial combat, of which I shall take occasion to make mention elsewhere more particularly. Thus in every civil suit, in which the demandant could legally prosecute his claim by a duel, the defendant was, by a law of this monarch, allowed the option of putting the affair on the trial of the grand assse. By this procedure four knights, or military tenants, of the county and vicinage were commanded to nominate, on their oaths, twelve others of the fame who might best know the truth ; and in place of any of these twelve, if necessary, others were substituted, until twelve unobjectionable men were found, who unani mously swore, from their knowledge of the fact, in favour of the one or the other party. In a jury of this species, composed of witnesses rather than judges, of which some rude vestiges are discovered in more ancient times among the Englissi, the expediency of a unanimous verdict is more evident than in its pre sent constitution. As well the military as the civil state of his king dom was improved by this monarch, particularly by the"], [305, ", BRITISH ILANDS. 281 the assize of arms and the introduction of scut 'age. Chap. By the former, a statute enacted in the year 1181, yy^j every person possessed of an estate was obliged to be provided with as many coats of mail, helmets, shields, and lances as the estate contained knights' fees : to every lay freeman, who held a property in land or chattels to the value of sixteen marks, were enjoined the fame arms ; to every lay freeman of ten marks a lance, an iron cap, and habergeon ; and to all of free condition the cap, the lance and a jacket quilted with wool or tow. These arms could not be seized for debt, nor on any account alienated. The sword and bow are omitted in this assize, as not requiring enforcement ; the former being carried by every military horseman ; the latter in general used by the infantry. Scutage, or ssiield-money, was a commu tation for military service in foreign countries, a tax assessed on knight's-fees throughout the kingdom in place of the personal attendance of the feudal tenants ' in wars abroad. By this the inferior landholders were released from the hardssiip of following their lords to distant regions, and the king was enabled to enlist mercenaries much sitter for foreign expeditions than the feudal militia, who were less adapted to , this kind of warfare than to internal defense. The foreign wars of this monarch, which render- act'o\"\"\" ed necessary the employment of mercenary troops, \u00a3\"]} Scot\" were chiefly in France ; but his transactions at home and abroad were so numerous and complicated, that an arrangement seems requisite different from that of annals, for perspecuity to the reader, in a compen dious narrative. I ssiall therefore, until the rebel- lion"], [306, "HISTORY OF THE 282 Chap XII Transact i on 5 in France. 1158. 1 169 lion of Henry's sons, an event which involved the neighbouring states at once in war, treat separately of the affairs transacted by this prince with Scotland, with France, with Wales, with Becket, and with Ireland. Of his intercourse with Scotland in this period the account may be ssiort. The three most northern of the Englissi counties, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Vvsestmoreland, which had, in the late distractions, been annexed to his dominions by king David of Scotland, were by Henry reclaimed in 1157, and resigned by the grand-son of David, Malcolm the fourth, who was utterly unable to op pose the demand. A claim was also made by the Engliffi, and conceded by the Scottissi monarch, that the latter ssiould acknowledge himself vassal to the former for the earldom of Lothian, which then com prehended all the eastern parts of Scotland between the Tweed and the frith of Forth. This demand, for his compliance with which Malcolm was vested with the earldom of Huntingdon, was founded on a grant made by Edgar, king of England, under con dition of homage, to Kenneth the third of Scotland. In France, where his dominions were so extensive and his interests implicated with the feudal claims of others, Henry was almost incessantly engaged in war or negociation. When these dominions, occupying a third of the whole French monarchy, were held by a warlike and ambitious prince, who could com mand the force of England with far less limited, and consequently far more effective sv/ay, than that of France, divided among powerful and almost inde pendent lords, could be commanded by its sovereign, the"], [307, "BRITISH ILANDS. 28? the former was naturally an object of no small jea- Chap. lousy to the latter, who might apprehend from so for- x\" midable a vassal the most dangerous encroachments, and even the subversion of his throne. But lax and inefficient for so great a purpose was the authority of the Englissi monarch over his French vassals, who were apt to consider their allegiance as more natu rally due to the sovereign, whose constant residence was in their neighbourhood, and who was acknow ledged by all to be the supreme head of the French nation. The king of France was thus enabled, though much inferior in power and revenue, to main tain his dignity against his neighbour of England, the force of whose continental territories he fre quently distracted by the fomenting of sedition. Henry, however, by his superior dexterity in the art of negociation, still more than by the vigour of his military movements, made at first considerable ad vances in the extending of his dominion and influ ence in France. Of his wars in this region, which belong rather to French than British history, most ' were too unimportant for particular mention. A disputed succession in Brittany had occasioned a Hi. a.qui civil war : the city and earldom of Nantes, rejecting Brittany. Conan, the prevailing competitor for the ducal dig- H58. nity, had elected for their earl Geoffry Plantagenet, a brother of the king of England : Geoffry had died in less than two years after his election, and Conan had seized the earldom as a part of his dutchy. This was claimed by Henry, as heir to his brother, by what right is unknown ; but to prevent the French monarch, Lewis the seventh, from interfering against him,"], [308, "HISTORY OF THE 284 Chap XII His war in Toulouse. 1159 him, he proposed a contract of marriage between his son, prince Henry, heir of his dominions, and Mar garet, the daughter of Lewis by his second wife. The proposal was eagerly accepted. Henry was en tertained at the French court ; received the princess, committed to his care for education ; and was author ized, as seneschal of France, to determine, without appeal, the dispute of succession between Conan and his rival, Eudo, who had escaped from prison, and was preparing to renew the war. Conan surrendered Nantes and its earldom to the Englissi king, who soon after gave judgement in his favour ; and, unop posed by Lewis, in his present good humour, com pleted the recovery of whatever had, in the late ci vil wars, been alienated from the demesne of the Norman dukedom. In n 66, eight years after these transactions, Conan, unable to maintain his authori ty against a rebellion of his vassals, favoured by Lewis, concluded a contract of marriage between his only child, Constantia, and prince Geoffry, the third son of Henry ; and resigned his dutchy to that monarch, as trustee for his son, until the young prince ssiould have attained maturity of years. This change of their governor v/as desirable to the inha bitants, as Henry, by the vigour of his administra tion, reduced the country to tranquility and order. Before the acquisition of this important fief the Englissi monarch had extended his dominion in an other part of France. In 1 159 he claimed, in right of Eleanor, his queen, the earldom of Toulouse, which at that time comprehended Ouercy and most of Languedoc.

He was accompanied to the continent by all his Englissi ba rons, and even by Malcolm the fourth, who furnissi ed the only instance of a king of Scotland fighting in France under an Englissi banner. The forces as sembled from his English and French territories, reinforced by confederates, were sufficient to over whelm the earl of Toulouse, unaided by his sove reign, whose neutrality, though his sister was wife to that earl, had been engaged by an artful negocia tion of Henry. Roused however at length from this impolitic acquiescence, Lewis took arms with such ardour, that he threw himself, with few forces, into the city of Toulouse, resolving to defend it to the utmost extremity. Here he might, according to the advice f the fiery Becket, have been captured by the king of England. But, from the consideration, among others, of the impolicy of an example which might be turned against himself, of a sovereign being imprisoned by his vassal, Henry with great prudence declined this opportunity, and declared that from respect for Lewis he would not besiege the city. He however exerted himself elsewhere with such vigour, that he conquered the greater part of the earldom, and gained other territories, which he retained by a treaty of peace concluded in the fol lowing year i 160. . The territory named Vexin, an important frontier of Normandy, had, when Henry received the in- vestiture"], [310, "HISTORY OF THE 286 Chap XII. 1169 vestityre of that dutchy, been ceded to the French monarch. Its' restitution was stipulated, as a matri monial dcwer, in the treaty of marriage between the son of Elenry and the daughter of Lewis, at what ever time the ceremony ssiould have been performed, with consent of the church ; and, in the ' interme diate term, it was consigned to the custody of the knights templars, as neutral ground. After the peace which terminated the war of Toulouse, Henry prevailed on two legates of the pope to celebrate the form of a marriage between prince Henry, not six years old, and the princess Margaret, still younger. He then received, according to the express condi tions of the treaty, from the knights templars, the castle of Gisors, and all the other fortresses of the Vexin. Enraged, without plausible grounds, against Henry and the knights, Lewis recommenced hosti lities, but was prevented by the activity of his op ponent from gaining any advantage. This contest was ended by a truce in 1161, when Henry turned his arms against revolters in Aquitaine, who were quickly overthrown. Subsequent revolts of Henry's vassals, his hosti lities, negociations, and personal conferences with Lewis, furnissi not any matter worth notice till a treaty of peace concluded in the January of 1169, by which, except Normandy and Touraine, the Englissi monarch agreed to resign all his French ter ritories to his sons, without, however, intending to relinquissi the administration and revenues of these until maturity of age ssiould have been attained by the princes.

JL HAVE already related, in the third and fourth chapters, that for some time after the establissiment of the Anglo-Saxon principalities in the British re gions, the Welch, or Cumraig Britons, maintained their independence in Cornwall, in North and South Wales, in Cumbria, and in Stratclyde : that the Welch of Cornwall were reduced to the state of tri butaries by Ina, king of Wessex, at the conclusion of the seventh century, and to that of subjects by Egbert in the beginning of the ninth : that Cum bria, in the year 945, was annexed to the Pictissi dominions, by an agreement between Malcolm the first of Scotland and Edmund of England : and that Stratclyde in 972 was incorporated with the Pictissi monarchy by Kenneth the fourth. In the more ex tensive tract of Wales, considered as divided into northern"], [313, "BRITISH ILANDS. 289 Chap XIll northern and southern, the Cumraig tribes remained much longer under the government of their native princes, sometimes independent, sometimes tributary to their powerful neighbours, and continue to this day a distinct people from the Englissi, retaining not only in common speech, but even in the service of the church, the Cumraig dialect, but much corrupted, of the ancient Celtic language. I have marked in my first chapter the mountainous and rugged nature of this region, bounded at first next England by the rivers Dee and Severn, reduced afterwards into nar rower, but fluctuating limits. Instead of Cambria, its former name, it began, about the end of the sixth century, to be called Wales, the country of the Walli or Wallissi people, supposed to signify Gwa lissi or Gallic. The government of the Welch was so divided and weak, that they were nearly in a state of anarchy. Their tumults were so fierce and frequent that few of their princes died otherwise than by assassination or in battle. The custom of gavelkind, the equal division of the father's estate among all the sons, legitimate and illegitimate without distinction, ex tended not only to private inheritances, but also to the toparchies, and even to the chief principalities, or, as they were styled, kingdoms. The eldest son, doubtless, of the deceased monarch had commonly a kind of titular sovereignty over the rest : but sometimes all the sons governed jointly ; and some times by a tmultuary ejection, or by force of arms, a younger son, or a distant relative, obtained the supremacy. The evil was augmented by fosterage, Vol. I. U the"], [314, "HISTORY OF THE 290 Chap, the custom of sending the children of the kings and toparchs to be nursed in the families of their princi- pal nobles or gentlemen, by which the strongest at- tachments were formed. Each fosterer endeavoured to raise his foster son to the throne ; and as the princes had commonly many sons, from their coha biting with many women, the factions were numer ous. Minors, always excluded from the succession on account of their incapacity for war, were apt, when they became adults, to attempt the enforce ment of their claims. From various causes the Welch were almost incessantly engaged in civil wars, which, though they nourissied their martial spirit, disabled them from effective defense against external foes. Of the transactions cf their princes to the year 1156 Caradoc, a monk of Lhancarvon, wrote a chronicle in Latin, which was translated by Hum phry Lhuid, and enlarged by Dr. Powell, who pub lissied it in 1584. It has since also been publissied with some alterations by Dr. Wynne. From this, and the records of Englissi writers, lord Lyttleton has compiled, with his usual perspicuity, a historical narrative of the principal affairs of Wales to the pe riod of his history of Henry the second. Warring ton's history of this part of Britain is a later work, and extends to its complete incorporation with Eng land.

BRITISH ILANDS. in the north, a kind of nominal supremacy was ac knowledged by the rest. After various convulsions, about the year 843, Rhoderic, the son of Mervyn Vrych, united all Wales under his authority by in heritances from his parents, and by his marriage with a princess, the heiress of South Wales. In 876, on the .death of this monarch, who, from the comparative magnitude of his dominion, was fur named Mawr or the great, the country became di vided, by a testimentary settlement, under his three sons, into three kingdoms, Guyneth, Deheubarth, and Mathraval or Powis ; the first comprehending the northern parts, the second the southern, and the third the eastern, extending through the counties of Salop, Montgomery, Radnor, and Hereford. To the eldest of these princes, residing at Aberffraw in Anglesey, the two younger were considered as subor dinate ; and various subdivisions were governed by others of the royal blood, as petty monarchs. Howel Dha, a grandson of Rhoderic, who suc ceeded to the southern principality in 907, became so renowned for justice and wisdom, that he obtained the sovereignty of all Wales in 940, which he re tained to his death in 948. This monarch, styled from the excellence of his administration, Dha, or the good, was the legislator of the Welch. His code of laws, political and municipal, digested by him into three books, is extant still, interlarded with feudal institutions of a much more recent date, but bearing marks of its having been in great part ori ginally borrowed from the laws or customs of the Englissi, and displaying much barbarism in those U 2 which"], [316, "HISTORY OF THE 292 Chap, which appear to be purely of Celtic derivation. On XIIL the death of that legislator, division among many princes, with fierce contention, was renewed ; and, Meredy,h though a reunion was effected in 987, under Mere 987-998. dyth, a grandson of Ho.vel, the civil distractions still continued. Debilitated by these from resistance against the Danes who ravaged his coasts, this prince engaged to pay a tribute to these pirates, a penny for every man in his dominions ; a heavy tax, when a penny then was probably equal in value to five sl-.illings now. He left at his death in 998 no other Lhewelyn. issue than a daughter, the wife of a nobleman, Lhe. 1015. weiyn ap Sitsyltht, who, after various conflicts, be- came sovereign of all Wales in 1015.

Gryssy.h. in I0y the Welch territories were once more 1037. unjtecl under one monarch, when Gryffyth, son of Lhewellyn, triumphed over all his opponents. This was one of the bravest and most able princes record- ed in Welch history. He was the only one mentioned as possessed of a navy, which was doubtless procured from foreigners to protect his coasts from Danish de- predation. He not only maintained his power against the frequent attempts of enemies domestic and ex- ternal, but made also ruinous incursions into the Englissi territories, in one of which he reduced the city of Hereford to assies. Provoked by repeated ra- vages, king Edward the confessor commissioned Ha- rold, who had made an ineffectual invasion a few years before, to chastise the Welch. This commif- sion"], [317, "BRITISH ILANDS. 293 sion he executed in 1063, as I have related in my Chap. sixth chapter, reducing the country to a tributary X111 state, in which it had sometimes been before, and placing its government in the hands of three princes nominated by himself, two of whom were uterine brothers of Gryffyth. This brave monarch would have doubtless rendered the progress of Harold more difficult, if himself had remained at the head of his troops ; but he had been so suddenly assailed that he could escape captivity no otherwise than by one of his ships, and was prevented by the Englissi fleet from returning till after the conquest of his king dom. When at length he arrived, and attempted to excite his former subjects again to arms, they put him to death, probably at the instigation of the new princes; and, as a proof of their pacific determina- tion, sent his head to Harold. As the Welch, when subdued by this leader, Posterior were left unbridled by fortresses, or by colonies of 0\"sn a Englissi planted among them, they resumed their in- 1033* dependence at his death in _io66, and replunged into civil wars, which were waged with little or no intermission, till the year 1078, when Gryffyth ap Conan and Rhees ap Tudor, uniting their arms, ren- dered themselves undisputed masters of North and South Wales, leaving the land of Powis under the divided government of two subordinate princes. In the following year, William the first of England, j079# provoked by some incursions, assembled a formidable army at Saint-David's, which struck such terror into all the Welch princes, that without resistance they submitted to pay him homage as feudal subjects. They"], [318, "_>94- Chap XIII <\u2014 v 10S7 1081 HISTORY OF THE They appear to have been bound to military service instead of tribute, and to have continued in peace among themselves and with the Englissi till the death of this monarch. But immediately on that event they relapsed into civil broils ; and soon after, con federating with some Norman lords, opponents of William the second, they committed ravages in the counties of Glo'cester and Worcester. They seem no longer to have acknowleged subjection to the Englissi monarchy ; but great encroachments were soon made on their southern territories by the Nor- mans. Defeated in a rebellion against Rhees ap Tudor, prince of South Wales, Jestyn, toparch of Glamor gan, prevailed by magnificent promises on Robert Fitzhaimon, a Norman lord, to assist him in his con test. By their united forces, in a battle near Breck nock, Rhees was vanquished and slain. He was the last Welch prince who held the entire dominion of South-Wales, which was now dismembered, and fell gradually to decay. From a quarrel, not unusual between such confederates, probably caused by breach of promise, Fitzhaimon turned his arms against Jes tyn, routed his forces, slew him, seized on his tersi tory, and made a distribution of it among his follow ers, the first colonists, according to the Welch chro nicle, settled in Wales. Encouraged by the success of this adventure, other Normans obtained grants of Welch territories from William, who was wel[ pleased with so cheap a mode of punissiing a revolt ed people, since the grantees were to attempt the conquests at their own risk and expense. Inroads were"], [319, "BRITISH ILANDS. 295 Chap, XIII were in consequence made in several quarters. By castles and colonies the adventurers endeavoured to secure their acquisitions. Among these was Roger de Montgomery, earl of Shrewsbury, from whom a part of Powis has taken the name of iVJontgomery ftire. Alarmed at encroachments which menaced their total subjugation, the princes of Wales, Gryffyth ap Conan in the north, and Cadogan ap Blethyn in the south, uniting their whole strength, fell with fory on the Norman settlers, discomfited them in two or three battles, -recovered most of their territories, de stroyed all the castles except those of Pembroke and Rydcors, and made incursions into England with barbarous devastation. William, indignant and fil led with rage, entered Wales with a powerful army. The Welch retired ; avoided a battle in the plains ; chose their posts with judgement ; and guarded strongly the defiles of their mountains, woods, and rivers. The invading troops, differently equipped from those of the successful Harold, heavily armed, consisting mostly of horsemen, unfit to act in the steep or narrow paths of the mountains, in woody vales, in oozy ground, and in a barren country, far from a supply of provisions by sea, were so severely harassed, while their horses died by the heavy rains and want of provender, that the king was obliged to return home, and to leave the prosecution of the war to the lords of the marches, the barons on the Welch borders. When these, notwithstanding their utmost exertions, were foiled ; Montgomery and many other noblemen slain ; and all their castles, ex- cept"], [320, "200 Chap XIII Tranfao tions with Kenry the first. 1 100 1135 1113 HISTORY OF THE cept that of Pembroke, destroyed ; William again invaded the country with a mighty force, and used his utmost efforts, but, from the fame causes, with not better success than before. Discord was excited by the intrigues of Henry the first among the Welch princes of the south and east, some of whom, to procure his aid in their civil con- tests, became his vassals. To assist in bridling the south, he planted in Pembrokessiire, about Tenby and Haverford-west, where their posterity remain a distinct people to this day, a colony of Flemings, industrious in agriculture, manufactures, and com- merce, and formidable in war, who had been driven by an extraordinary irruption of the sea from their homes in the reign of William the first, and had lived since dispersed in different parts of England. Provoked by incursions of the Welch, and determi- ned on their final conquest, he invaded their coun- try in 1 1 13 with the whole force of his kingdom, in three armies, led severally by himself, by the king of Scotland, Alexander the fierce, who served un- der him on this occasion, and by Gilbert de Clare, earl of Pembroke and Chepstow. The last of these leaders appears to have succeeded in the reduction of what had remained independent in South Wales ; but in the northern parts the two kings were less suc- cessful. The inhabitants all retired to the moun- tains with their cattle and provisions. The invading armies, from the nature of the ground, the ambus- cades of the foe, and the want of sufficient suste nance, were unable to penetrate to their recesses. Henry, in this difficult situation , had recourse to intrigue."], [321, "BRITISH ILANDS. 297 intrigue. By infusing into each a belief that the Ch .p. other was negociating separately for himself, he ex- lT*r._. cited jealousies between Gryffyth ap Conan, prince of North Wales, and Owen ap Cadogan, who had fled to Gryffyth from the south. By this manage ment he concluded a treaty which barely saved his honour. He was paid a sum far from adequate to the expense of his expedition ; but seems neither to have received homage, nor to have acquired any land, from this northern prince. By presents and kind treatment, however, he afterwards gained the steady friendssiip of Gryffyth ; but insurrections, with bloodssied and devastation, had place in South Wales and Powis, which induced him to make a personal vi sit a second time, at the head of an army in 1122. In \\\\22. his march through a defile he narrowly escaped a mortal wound, saved only by the excellence of his habergeon from an arrow against his breast, suspect ed to have come from an Englissi bow. A third ex pedition, which he was preparing to lead against this untamed people, was prevented by disputes with Geoffry, his daughter's husoand, and afterwards by his death. Immediately on intelligence of this event the spirit Transac of revolt was diffused much more widely.

XIH 1136 1137 rons possessed of Welch estates in that quarter. The latter were defeated with the loss of three or four thousand slain, great numbers captured, and a great er disgrace than the Norman arms had ever before received. The victors overran several districts, parti cularly all Cardiganshire, abusing as a barbarous peo ple, their victory in a horrible manner ; for, beside other atrocities, they exposed their female captives, even of the highest rank, to public violation. In j 137 died Gryffyth ap Rhees, styled in Welch his tory \" the light, honour, and prop of South-Wales ;\" and soon after him Gryffyth ap Conan, called \" the only desensc and shield of all Wales ;\" both of them princes of eminent abilities, especially the latter, who, in a reign of fifty years, in a country so liable to revolutions, had preserved his people from intes tine commotions and foreign subjection. His domi nions were divided among his sons, but the sove reignty rested in the eldest, named Owen Gwyneth. King Stephen was so occupied in supporting his usurpation against intestine foes, that he took no other measures for the repression of the Welch than the furnissiing of money to the lords marchers, the barons on the hostile borders. As these were foiled, he, by a treaty of peace, relinquissied to the princes of Wales, free of homage and tribute, all the terri tories which they had recovered ; a treaty so offen sive to the marchers, that, except the house of Clare, they all became adherents of Matilda. Nor were these princes thereby prevented from sending a large auxiliar force to the assistance of Stephen's enemies. lists aid was procured by the influence of the virtu- ous"], [323, "BRITISH ILANDS. 299 ous Robert, earl of Glocester, to whom the Welch, Chap. on account of his mother, the daughter of Rhees X[H ap Tudor, the last king of South Wales, were so at tached, that, in their wars against the Englissi and Norman settlers, they appear not to have molested the county of Glamorgan, the estate of this noble man. If, while England was distracted by the civil war between Stephen and Matilda, the Welch prin ces had all united under Owen Gwyneth, they might have expelled the foreigners from every part of their country. But, after some united efforts, dissensions arose, which, notwithstanding some vic tories by them acquired in the latter part of Ste phen's reign, so diminished their force, that the Englissi and Flemissi colonists in the south were per mitted to maintain their possessions till Henry the se cond ascended the throne, from whom they received more effectual protection. The Welch manners in this period, described by Mmner.of Giraldus Cambrensis, are collected into one point os' e view by Lyttleton. Unacquainted with manufac tures or commerce, and paying very little attention to agriculture, but subsisting on cattle, and corn im ported in exchange for cattle, they were universally addicted to arms, expert in their use, courageous and fierce, regarding death caused otherwise than by combat as a dissionour ; though not robust, yet ex tremely agile, hardy, and inured to hunger and fa tigue by incessant practice of war or hunting. They used no defensive arms, except a light ssiield or tar get, fortified with leather, sometimes with iron. Their offensive were chiefly the pike and bow. In the"], [324, "HISTORY OF THE 300 Chap, X11I. the former, used in darting as well as pussiing, the northern Welch, in the latter the southern, excelled, particularly the men of Guent or Monmouthshire, which was then a part of Wales. Their troops were all infantry, except a few nobles mounted on small horses, who also were accustomed to dismount and fight on foot. In battle the first charge of the Welch was impetuous and terrible. When this was firmly withstood, they were defeated, and could not imme diately be rallied : but they could soon again be col lected to try the fortune of another engagement, or to harrass and annoy the foe by ambuscades, ra pid marches in the night, and sudden assaults at times when they were least expected. Though the Latin language, with some ssiare of Roman literature, but in a declining state, was pre- served in their monasteries, they had lost whatever refinements had been imparted to their ancestors by the Romans, and had quite relapsed into barbarism. They also retained the christian religion in its rites, but debased by a wretched superstition into the detri- ment of society, particularly in their asylums, which extended widely round their churches for the protec- tion of criminals. Volatile and fond of change, they were apt to violate their engagements without regard to faith, oaths, or shame; were easily impel led to any enterprize however dangerous or wicked, and as easily deterred from its prosecution. Little disrepute was attached to robbery or theft, even when committed among themselves, far less when exercised on foreigners. Marriage was almost always preceded by cohabitation, as parents were accustomed to"], [325, "BRITISH ILANDS. 301 Chap XIII. to give their daughters to young men on trial, for a sum deposited, and a forfeit in case of their being sent back. Lewdness was indulged to excess, espe cially by the. chiefs, but in food and drink tempe rance was in general very strictly observed. Luxury was unknown. With exception of a few castles built by princes in imitation of the Englissi, the no bles dwelt only in huts made of wattles, and chan ged every year their place of abode for a fressi supply of pasturage or of game. Notwithstanding their poverty they were hospita ble in the extreme. Every house was open to all without exception. On the arrival of a traveller, he delivered his arms to the master of the house. The latter assied leave to wash the feet of the former. His assent signified his intention of remaining all night. Whatever was the number or quality of the guests, the master and mistress waited on them at supper, without sitting, or tasting food, until these had finissied their repast. On coarse coverlets of hemp, spread over thin mats of russies, around a fire which burned all night in the middle of the apart ment, the guests and all the family slept together, with no other covering than the garments which they wore in the day, with their feet next the fire to compensate the want of additional clothes. The Welch had the merit of being of all people in the Britissi ilands the least addicted to jealousy, while the Irish were said to be the most infected with this vice. In other respects the manners of these two nations had a close resemblance. Their only ele gance was the music of the harp, which was prac- ticed"], [326, "HISTORY OF THE 302 Chap, ticed universally in Wales. This contributed not a J^L little to the chearfulness of the people, who had much natural vivacity, and a readiness of wit, and unem- barrassed eloquence. But from this fiery tempera- ment they were furiously passionate and vindictive. As by custom every man had his genealogy recorded in his mind, with a false notion of honour 'for the revenge of injuries received by his ancestors, feuds were, perpetuated in all ranks to the great distraction and detriment of the nation. Thuriova- When Henry the second, soon after his accession, fion liy . r , . Henry the obliged the foreign mercenaries of Stephen to leave his kingdom, he permitted some, who were of Fle- missi race, to join their countrymen in Pembroke- ssiire. By this he added strength to that colony, which had with invincible courage maintained its ground against the Welch. The latter occupied by internal dissension, ceased hostilities against the En glissi ; and Henry, whose attention was elsewhere engaged, and who was sensible of the affectionate service rendered by this people to his mother, per mitted them for some time to retain the territories which they had recovered from the Anglo-Norman barons. He was at length induced to undertake the conquest of their country by a regard to the real in terest of his kingdom, and by the instigations of two Welch princes, enemies of Owen Guyneth, the king of North Wales. One of these was Madoc ap Meredyth, prince of Powis, who dreaded the en mity and power of Owen. The other was Cadwal ader, a brother of Owen, who had been expelled by this prince on account of his having killed his own"], [327, "BRITISH ILANDS. 30.. son-in-law in single combat. Advancing from Che- Chap. ssiire into Flintssiire, in 1157, with a powerful army toward Basingwerk, an Englissi fortress ruined by the Welch, Henry fell into an ambuscade in a nar row pass between two ranges of hills. When the troops of his vanguard had reached the middle of the defile, the foes in ambussi rising suddenly, with tremendous yells, from the woods which overhung the steep sides of the hills, assailed them with such ssiowers of arrows, darts, and stones, that they were compelled to retreat with terrible slaughter. To the main army, advancing in good order to the entrance of the strait, the fugitives in their terror made re port that the king was slain. This news was repeat ed in a loud exclamation by Henry de Essex, the he reditary standard bearer of England, who threw at the fame time the royal standard to the ground. Consternation and disorder seized the troops : the Welch, perceiving it, issued from the woods, and charged them with the utmost fury : the king, in the critical moment, prevented a ssiameful rout, by the (how of his person, and by his loud exhortati ons : re-animated, rallying, and recovering their or der, the Englissi stopped the career of the assailants, repelled, and drove them to take refuge in their fastnesses. In some years afterwards Henry de Essex, though seemingly not condemned in the private judgement of his master, was accused of treason for his conduct in this battle, and, being overcome in single combat by his accuser, was consigned to a mo nastery, which was the slightest punishment impose- able by the customs then subsisting. Instructed"], [328, "30+ Chap. XIII. Revolt of Rhees ap Gryffyth. 1.59 103 HISTORY OF THE Instructed by this repulse, king Henry changed his plan of operations. Leaving the tract of woody hills to the left, he marched along the ssiore of the sea, beyond Basingwerk, to the back of Owen's post, who thereupon retired to the mountains of Snowdon. The Englissi monarch, thus gaining possession of Flintssiire, secured it by fortresses, and by roads which rendered it pervious to his troops. To interrupt the progress of these works the Welch descended from the mountains and skirmished, nei ther giving an opportunity of battle in open ground, nor able to draw the Englissi into defiles. By an Englissi fleet the importation of corn was precluded, and the maratime tracts ravaged, particularly Angle sey, where a body of ravagers was unavailingly cut to pieces by a sudden and impetuous onset. Dread ing famine and other evils from a protracted resist ance, Owen at length submitted to perform homage to Henry, to relinquissi all the territories in North- Wales possessed formerly by the Englissi, to restore Cadwallader to his estates in the south, and to give two of his sons as hostages for his future fidelity. His example was soon followed by the chieftains of South-Wales, the last of whom in submitting was Rhees ap Gryffyth, This prince, dissatisfied with the estates assigned him by Henry, who seems not to have honourably performed his promise, and further irritated by an unredressed incursion on his lands by a neighbouring baron, had recourse to arms, and, while the king was occupied with the war of Toulouse, overran the county of Cardigan, and demclissied several castles"], [329, "BRITISH ILANDS. 305 Chap XIII. General insurrecti on of the Welch. 116+ 1172, 1165 castles in that of Pembroke. But he was constrain ed to raise the siege of Carmarthen, and to retire to the mountains of Brecknock, by an army of Eng lissi and Welch, who recovered the conquered lands and repaired the castles. From these mountains he infested the neighbouring parts till the year 1163, when Henry, having returned from France, led an army against him, by which he was awed into sub mission without a battle. Though Rhees was now gratified with the territo ries which had been formerly promised him, as the Cantreff Mawr, a great part of Car mar then ssiire, in which was Dynevowr , the royal seat of his ances tors, the kings of South-Wales, yet instigated by ambition, but affecting resentment at pretended injuries, he was in the following year again in arms, reconquered Cardiganssiire, except its chief castle, then called Abertivy, ravaged Pembroke ssiire, and by his exploits and eloquence prevailed on all the other Welch princes to join in the re volt, as a favourable opportunity seemed afforded by the embarrassed condition of Henry's affairs from his disputes with primate Becket and the pope. The Englissi monarch, advancing with a very numerous army assembled both from his Englissi and French dominions, by Ofwestry into Powis, found the for ces of all Wales collected at Corwen in the ssiire of Merioneth. At the river Ceireoc his vanguard was furiously assailed ; but, after a bloody conflict, he repulsed the foe, gained the pass, and encamped at the foot of Berwin, a mountain of great height.

V , 1 1166 cloud on the top and sides of this eminence, await. ing an opportunity to fight with advantage, his camp was so deluged with torrents from the heights, in consequence of heavy rains, that he was constrained to retire, and to relinquissi his enterprize. In re venge for the violated faith of the Welch princes, he caused their hostages to be deprived of sight, among whom were two sons of Owen Gwyneth and two of Rhees ap Gryffyth. Reverting to his former plan of operations, that of infesting the maritime tracts with a naval and military force, he repaired to Ches ter, where suddenly, on some private intelligence not mentioned by historians, he dismissed at once both fleet and army. This intelligence is supposed to have been that of an intended rebellion in his French dominions, when opportunity ssiould be gi ven by his detention in Wales. Opposed now only by the forces of the barons, while Henry's presence was required in France, where he was long detained, the Welch made an alarming progress in the recovery of their territories, Rhees completing the conquest of Cardiganshire in n 66, and Owen that of Flintshire in the following year. But their successes against the Englissi, whose total expulsion from Wales was threatened, were stopped in 1169 by the death of Owen, after a reign of thirty-two years, with a high reputation not less for his civil than military talents. Wars with great Hoodssied ensued among his sons, fifteen in num ber, by two wives and several concubines.

Having received a classic education, and be- ing possessed not only of uncommon abilities, but also of graceful manners and a winning address, he was early promoted to some benefices by Theobald archbissiop of Canterbury, was by him sent to Bou- logna to study the civil and canon laws, was after- wards employed as his agent at Home, and entrusted with an important and secret negociation, by which were procured prohibitory letters against the crown ing of Eustace, the son of Stephen, already noticed in my eleventh chapter. The successful management of"], [334, "HISTORY OF THE 310 Chap XIV His charao ter. of this difficult business endeared him to Henry, who, immediately on his accession, raised him to the office of king's chancellor, an office then of much higher and more extensive authority than at present. But his authority became far greater than that of his' predecessors in office by the favour of his sovereign, with whom, by unlimited confidence, he seemed al most to ssiare the throne. Beside the emolument of his place, and a number of ecclesiastical benefices to a scandalous amount, he had in his custody royal fortresses, the temporalities of vacant prelacies, and the escheats of great baronies belonging to the crown, the revenues of which he expended, as if they were all his own rents, with every appearance of a most ostentatious prodigality, while with singular address he persuaded the king that the whole of this magnifi- cence, in which the son of a private citizen surpassed even the greatest barons of his realm, was designed only as an honour to his bountiful master, whose creature he was, and upon whom his whole fortune must absolutely depend. To acquire such an ascendancy over a prince of such capacity and discernment no ordinary combi nation of qualities could have sufficed. In the words of Lyttleton, \" the person of Becket was very grace ful and his countenance pleasing : his wit was lively and facetious, his judgment acute, his eloquence flowing and sweet, his memory vast and ready on all occasions. The time which he had passed in that school of the most exquisite policy, the court of Rome, had greatly improved and refined his under standing. Nor was his capacity limited to the sphere r or"], [335, "fcRITISII II.ANDS. 311 Chap XIV of business. He made himself a perpetual compa nion to the king in most of his pseasures, and fell in with all his tastes so easily and so naturally, that in paying his court he seemed only to indulge his own inclinations. There was a certain inexpressible grace in his manners, given by nature, but helped by art, which rendered his virtues more amiable, and even his .vices agreeable.\" To ambition he seems to have sacrificed his other passions, and, even where he indulged any of them, to have made that indulgence subservient to his main design. When he was employed to negociate a marriage between prince Henry, the heir of the Englissi dominions, and the daughter of Lewis, king of France, he asto nished the French court by his prodigal magnifi cence, distributing presents to a vast amount, and supporting in a superb style not less than a thousand attendants, of whom two hundred were knights. His talents for negociation in particular were great, and for war were far from despicable. In the cam paign of king Henry in Toulouse he performed the part of an active and efficient officer. He led seven hundred knights, all of his own houssiold, each at tended by an esquire, accounted the most daring troops in the army of the Englissi monarch. He took by storm three castles deemed impregnable by his master. Beside his houssiold troops, he main tained, at his own expense, during forty days, twelve hundred knights and four thousand inferior stipendiaries : and in single combat he dismounted a knight renowned for his valour, whose horse he led away in triumph. As"], [336, "HISTORY OF THE 312 Chap XIV His promo tion to the primacy 1162. Hit\u00bb change of charac- ter, As Becket was a churchman, archdeacon of Can terbury, and holding many other benefices, his mi litary acts were violations of the canons. His disre gard of these, his general freedom from bigotry, and the boldness with which he had supported the royal prerogative against the alleged privileges of the church, led Henry into a firm persuasion that, with his personal attachment and great abilities, he would, if elevated to the primacy of England, be the fittest instrument for the execution of a favourite plan formed for the security of the regal from the en croachments of the clerical power. On the death of primate Theobald in 1 1 6 1 the king was inflexibly determined to raise Becket to his place, contrary to the earnest entreaty of IVIatilda his mother, the wissies of the nation in general, and the clergy in particu lar, who signified, as far as they dared, their dis approbation of this measure, the appointment of a courtier and a soldier, who had never taken more than deacon's orders. After a delay of more than a year, the monks of Canterbury and the suffragan bissiops, yielding to the violent menaces of their sovereign, elected his chancellor to the place of pri mate, on the third of June in 1162. That he en tered not into the orders of priesthood until the day immediately preceding that of his consecration was remarked as an uncommon circumstance by the wri ters of that age. By the education of prince Henry, the heir of the realm, committed to his charge, by the chancellor ssiip, and by the primacy, all the power of England, civil and ecclesiastical, seemed to have been placed in"], [337, "BRITISH ILANDS. 313 Chap, XIV in the hands of one person, the first Englissiman raised to any great office by any prince of the Nor man line. But a dependant power was far from sa tisfying the ambition of Becket, whose aim was to acquire the real sovereignty of England by subject ing the regal to the primatial authority. He seems to have somewhat mis-calculated, notwithstanding his extreme intimacy with him, king Henry's character, and to have expected a much less determined resist ance than he afterwards experienced ; yet, sensible of the vigour and spirit of that monarch, he took every precaution for the contest, and began by arm ing himself with the reputation of the most exalted sanctity. In no man was ever a change more sud den and great than in this prelate. He appeared wholly absorbed in religious contemplation and spi ritual duties ; incessantly engaged in the reading of scripture, in prayers, in preaching, or in ostenta tious acts of what was falsely accounted charity ; and continually bore in conversation and aspect a severe gravity. Whenever he received the commu nion in public, he ssied abundance of tears ; he sighed ; he groaned ; \" pouring forth his whole soul,\" fays a writer of his life, \" in devotion and contrition, as if he had touched the wounds of Christ.\" Under his canonical habit he wore the frock of a monk, and under that, next the ssiin, a rugged haircloth, which was so seldom changed as to be often swarmed with vermin. He dedicated the tenth of his revenue to stated alms. He fed every day a number of beggars ; attended on them, as a servant at table ; and wassied their feet on his knees. He"], [338, "31 + Chap XIV. His pro c.eduigs. 1163 HISTORY OF THE He continued to maintain a splendid household with hospitality, to strike the senses of the vulgar ; but mixed not with his guests, except a few monks, or other churchmen, with whom he dined apart. When he was visited by any of the regular clergy, he received them with such reverence, that \" he seemed to worssiip the divine presence or angels in their persons.\" But against all, who were in the least suspected of entertaining schismatical opinions, he professed an enmity with flaming zeal. Immediately on his establishment in the archiepis copal see, he resigned the office of chancellor, send ing the great seal to the king, who was then in France, with a message, that \" he could hardly suf fice to the duties of one office, much less of two.\" Yet, in manifest violation of decorum, he attempted to retain the archdeaconry of his own diocese, which he could not be compelled, without great difficulty, to resign. He attended a council at Tours, held by pope Alexander the third in 1163, where measures were concerted for new encroachments on the civil power. On his return into England he commenced his attack by laying claim lo various castles and ma nors, possessed near a century by the crown or by lay barons, but alleged by him to have once be longed to the see of Canterbury, against whose right of resumption no plea of royal grant or length of possession was admitted by the canons of the Roman church. He collated a priest to a rectory, the pa tronage of which belonged to a layman, an imme diate tenant of the crown : and when the patron, in support of his invaded right, expelled the servants of"], [339, "BRITISH ILANDS. 315 Chap XIV. Abuse of religion. of the priest, who had seized for him the church, he was excommunicated by the primate, in direct violation of a royal prerogative, that no tenant in chief, or servant of the king, ssiould be excommu nicated without his consent, because by this sentence he would be deprived of the services of the person censured. Commanded by Henry to withdraw this lawless condemnation, the prelate at first haughtily refused, but afterwards complied ; yet appears not to have in the least apologized or receded from his pretensions. The primate also protected from the justice of the civil power clergymen guilty of crimes howsoever atrocious, maintaining an immunity of the clerical order from all jurisdiction except the ecclesiastical. One of these criminals had seduced a gentleman's daughter, and, to secure his enjoyment, had mur dered her father. This exemption, affirmed by Becket, which would have enabled the church to continue safely its encroachments on the regal autho rity, had been abused to an alarming degree. Num bers of indigent and idle men had been ordained without titles. Such were apt to commit all sorts of crimes while they were protected from punissi ment by ecclesiastical privileges. The authority of their clerical superiors was totally inefficient. They \" could not be restrained by the fear of deprivation, having no benefices to lose, or of being imprisoned by the bissiops, who, in most cases, chose rather to dismiss them with impunity than to keep and feed them in their jails.\" That, in times of anarchy or disorder, when sufficient protection could not be ob- tained"], [340, "3|s, HISTORY OF THE Chap, tained from the civil power, the ministers of reli- XIV- gion ssiould, by the sanctity attached to their profes \"\"* ' sion, be enabled to shield their persons and establift- ments from violence, and even, by their interposi- tion for the safety of others, to lay some restraint on lawless force, was doubtless a desirable object. But by the liberty of the church, * term then much in use, was no longer meant the security of its rights, but the extension of its privileges, and its ultimate dominion. Another abuse proceeded from the com mutation of penances enjoined for transgressions, and the corruption of the spiritual courts, by which great sums were extorted from the innocent, and no other than pecuniary punishments inflicted on the guilty. King Henry asserted that by these means the clergy had levied more money in a year than himself had raised for the royal revenue, and yet had left wick edness unreformed, secure, and triumphant. Proceed- This monarch had immediately, on the resigna- H\u00abir\u00b0y. tIon \u00b0f the great seal by Becket, perceived his dan- iio3. gerous designs, with astonissiment, alarm, and the UOk mortification of having been ib egregiously duped in his choice of a primate. He was convinced that he must now expect, in his intended reformation, the most inflexible resistance frcm the very man on whom he had depended for the most effectual aid ; but he was also convinced, from this and the attack on his prerogative so early commenced by Becket, that to exert himself with redoubled vigour was be come necessary, since a contest had arisen whether the king or the archbiffiop of Canterbury ssiould be the actual ruler of England. In 1163, some time after"], [341, "BRITISH ILANDS. 317 Chap, XIV. after his return from France, he summoned all the bissiops to Westminster ; represented to them in strong colours the pernicious effects of clerical im munities ; and demanded their consent, that eccle siastics, convicted of any heinous crime, ssiould first be degraded, and then surrendered, for corporal pu nishment, to the secular courts ; and that one of his officers ssiould be present at every degradation of such offenders to prevent their escape from justice. To preclude their assent to a demand so evidently just, expedient, and moderate, Becket earnestly entreated that no answer ssiould be required from the prelates till the following day ; and, on refusal of this, request ed permission to confer with them apart. By his ad dress he so availed himself of this concession, that he prevailed on the bissiops, contrary to their pre vious opinion, to join with him unanimously in de claring, that no ecclesiastic ought ever to be judged or punissied by a secular court for any crime what soever ; that to inflict any other punissiment for the same offense, after degradation from orders, would be unjust ; but that of crimes committed afterwards by the persons degraded the secular judges might take cognizance. Unable by force of reason to conquer their obsti nacy in this declaration, the king reduced his argu ments to this question, \" whether they would ob serve the ancient customs and laws of his realm ?\" To which they all severally answered, by Becket's instruction, that they would observe them \" as far as they could, saving the privileges of their order and the honour of God.\" Extremely provoked at an"], [342, "3IS Chap XIV HISTORY OF THE an evasion, which carried the force of a complete refusal, Henry, declaring that he perceived \" a line of battle arrayed against him,\" left abruptly the convention. On the next morning he took from Becket the tuition of prince Henry and the custody of the castles which he had held since his chancel lorship. Though supported by a cordial confede racy of all his nobles, who urged him to vigorous measures, Henry, knowing the magnitude of the opposing force, resolved to manage his exertions with caution and art. Finding by his separate at tempts to gain individuals, that many of the bishops would have complied with his wissies, if they had not been prevented by the fear of offending the Ro man court by declining to second the efforts of Becket for the extension of its power, he tried every method, but in vain, to overcome that prelate's ob stinacy, by menaces, by entreaties, and even by con descending to flatter the man whom he now hated, in proportion to the love which he had formerly en tertained for him. Through the medium of the pope's almoner, who happened then to be in Lon don, he was more successful. Doubtless gained by the royal munificence, this minister pretended to have received instructions from his Holiness to ad vise the primate to a compliance with the king's de mand. Though Becket had declared that he would pronounce an anathema against even an angel from Heaven, who would give him such advice, he yielded to the almoner. He repaired to Henry at Oxford, and gave his promise, without exception or reserva tion, to observe the customs of the kingdom. Having"], [343, "BRITISH ILAKDS. 319 Having received the primate on this occasion with Chap. apparently great satisfaction, though doubtless not y^A. with inward confidence, Henry assembled a parlia- Conven ment at Clarendon in 1 164, in which the rights of\u00a3?\u00b0of, the crown and customs of the realm, particularly H64,_ 1164. with regard to judicial proceedings, in use in the reign of Henry the first and his predecessors, were reduced to writing by the most ancient persons ; and all the members were required to take an oath that they would observe them. Becket refused, pretend ing that this was different from his general promise, and was joined in his refusal by the other prelates. At the end of a violent debate of three days' conti nuance, the temporal barons, enraged to the utmost, declared themselves ready, in a furious manner, to execute on the bissiops whatsoever vengeance the king ssiould command. While the rest of the pre lates, depending on Henry's prudence, remained un moved by this menace, which was an instance of the barbarism of the age and of the imperfect state of the parliament, Becket alone, having gone to consult with some particular friends, pronounced, on his return, these words to the bissiops, who were sitting apart in a separate chamber, \" It is my mas ter's will that I shall perjure myself, and at present I submit, and incur a perjury, with design to repent af terwards in what manner I stall be able.\" As his promise before, so his oath now was only given for a temporizing purpose ; and by his master he per haps meant the pope, whose approbation of his plan he might naturally expect. Yet, when he had taken the oath, and when all the other prelates had by his command"], [344, "3?0 Chap XIV. Retracta. tion of Becket. 16+ HISTORY OF THE command taken the same, and had also signed and sealed the articles, he withheld his signature and sub scription ; perhaps vainly expecting to palliate thus the perjury so deliberately incurred. With him however was deposited one copy, another with the archbishop of York, and a third in the records of the kingdom. Of the articles composing the code of laws enact ed on this occasion, commonly called the Constitu tions of Clarendon, sixteen related particularly to ec clesiastical affairs. They reduced clerical persons of all denominations under a due subjection to the laws of the realm ; limited the jurisdiction of the spiritu al courts ; and guarded against appeals to the papal fee, and against the pronouncing of appeals and in terdicts without the king's consent, or, in his absence without that of his justiciary. Becket, according to his predetermined repentance, suspended himself, as a guilty person, from the sacred functions of his office, until he received the pope's absolution. He next attempted privately to leave the kingdom, in direct violation of the constitutions, in the hope of gaining by his operations on the continent, a superi ority over the king, and of thence returning in a triumphant manner. Twice driven back by contra ry winds, he relinquissied his design for the present, and even made a visit to Henry, who dissembled so far as to treat him in a mild manner. Convinced however that he must either yield the point in dispute, or contend with his utmost power, he renewed the contest with immoveable determination, openly op posed the execution of the laws to which he had sworn"], [345, "BRITISH ILANDS. 321 Chap XIV His prose union. 116+ sworn obedience, and clearly evinced to the nobility and king his design of reducing them both to sub jection.* Not less determined on the other side to maintain his prerogative, the king cited Becket to appear be- fore him, on a legal complaint of his having denied justice to a layman. On his refusal to obey the cita- tion, a parliament was convoked at Northampton, which was attended by an uncommonly great num- ber. Accused by the king of disobedience to his mandate, he made a frivolous excuse, was found guilty, and condemned to forfeiture of goods. The forfeiture was reduced to a fine of five hundred pounds ; and the bissiops, who had unanimously con- curred in the sentence with the temporal barons, bound themselves, as sureties, for its payment. Con- demned, on the following day, to the payment of another five hundred pounds, alleged by the king to have been lent, by Becket to have been bestowed, he gave some of his vassals as securities, when the prelates seemed unwilling to pledge themselves fur- ther. Required on the third day to render an ac- count of the enormous sums, with which he had been entrusted when chancellor, and which he had expended as if all had been his own, he requested time to prepare an answer, but secretly resolved to give no account. Having endeavoured, without suc- cess, to acquire, in his resistance to this demand, the support of the prelates, some of whom advised him to resign the primacy, he entered the parliament on the day when he was expected to give his answer, with a consecrated wafer and his cross in his hand, Vol. I.

As he peremptorily refused to give any account, the king and temporal barons, who had retired into another chamber, resolved to attaint him of high treason. The bissiops were per plexed, and, after some consultation, implored the king's leave to appeal to Rome against the primate. promising their endeavours to procure his deposition. To this Henry assented, through an error of judge ment, permitting them to remain apart, without joining in judgement with the temporal peers, who unanimously found Becket guilty of perjury and treason. The primate declared aloud that obedience was much more due to God and to himself than to an earthly king ; that he disclaimed the judgement of the king and all the barons of the realm ; and that he was subject to the jurisdiction of none, under God, but the pope, to whom he appealed. He then left the house amid the reproaches of the assembly, many of whom called him a perjured traitor. The account here given differs much from that of Hume and many others ; but for the proof of its ve racity I refer the reader to Lord Lyttleton, who, in his history of Henry the second, has placed the mat ter in a clear light, from a comparison of original records and letters wish the writings of early histo rians, who have made some partial misrepresentati ons. That the pecuniary prosecution was instituted against the primate merely on account of his cleri cal proceedings appears indubitable, yet, though the demand"], [347, "BRITISH ILANDS. 323 demand was enormous and impracticable, it was Chap. XIV strictly legal, conducted in legal form, and planned for the compulsion of the ambitious prelate to resign his see for the preservation of the kingdom from cle rical dominion. His earnest wissi to retain the bi ssiops on his side had unwarily led the king to consent to their appealing to the pope against Becket's au thority, when the matter in which their judgement was required, as barons of the realm, was wholly civil. Becket saw his advantage ; and as Henry ne glected or declined to seize and imprison him, he fled that night from Northampton ; and, after fifteen days of disguise and concealment in different places, he escaped in a small fissierboat from Sand wich, on the tenth of November, to Gravelines in Flanders. He pasted secretly also through the terri tories of the earl of Flanders into those of Lewis the seventh, the French monarch, who afforded his protection in the most ample manner, partly through superstition, partly from the policy of debilitating the English prince by fomenting discord between the church and crown, without reflecting that he was thereby adding strength to the clerical power, which was becoming dangerous to all the temporal mo narchs in Christendom. So warmly, however, was the cause of Becket espoused by him, that he sent his almoner to the pope to beseech his Holiness that S. he would support the archbissiop of Canterbury in all points against the tyrant of England.\" From Soissons, where, by his insinuations and ad- H\u00bb trans- a_l ions in dress, in his personal conversation with Lewis, he -ranee. fixed that monarch firmlv in an attachment to him- Y i self"], [348, "32+ Cba'. XiV. Measures taken by Henry. 1165 HISTORY OF THE self and in a hatred to the king of England, Beck et proceeded to the papal court then at Sens, where he was received with the most flattering marks of kindness. The constitutions of Clarendon were ex amined by the pope and his consistory. Six of them were tolerated as less evil than the remaining ten, all of which were totally condemned. A judgement thus held by a foreign judicature on the laws of England was an insolent violation of the indepen dence of its crown, and the abetting of it by Beck et was highly criminal. Apprehending that at tempts might be made for his deposition on the ground of his having been obtruded on his electors by compulsive means, this prelate resigned his pri macy to the pope, from whom, after some consulta tion among the cardinals, he again received the dig nity. Having thus dexterously obviated the appre hended accusation, and insured the papal protection to the legality of his appointment, he retired to the abbey of Pontigni in Burgundy, where he conform ed to the monastic institutions in garb and mode of living. Henry, who had in vain sent orders to guard the sea-ports to prevent this prelate's escape, and had afterwards, without effect, sent a splendid embassy to Lewis and the pope, to preclude from him their protection, by a representation of his rebellious con duct, at length resolved on stronger measures. He confiscated his estate and the revenues of those cler gy who had abetted his treasonable proceedings. He interdicted all correspondence with him, and all public prayers for him in churches. Otherwise the monks"], [349, "BRITISH ILANDS. 325 Chap. XIV monks would have made even addresses to the Deity incentives of sedition. As a mulct on the pope for espousing the cause of a rebellious prelate, he stop ped the payment of Peter's pence. To Henry this pontiff, Alexander the third, owed the greatest obli gations, even the obtaining and retaining of his pontificate, as this monarch had influenced and sup ported Lewis in his interest against another pope named Victor, whom the emperor of Germany would otherwise have establissied in the Roman see. Alexander professed himself fully sensible of the fa vours conferred ; but whatever gratitude he really felt was quite superseded by his regard to the interest of the popedom, which was termed by him the ho nour of God. Yet probably he might, from a fear of Henry's inimical influence in this or another schism, have gratified him in this business, if Lewis had adopted a neutral conduct. Moved by resent ment or erroneous policy, the Englissi monarch pro ceeded to an act of cruel injustice. He banissied by a general sentence all the relatives and dependants of Becket, to the number of near four hundred per sons, without distinction of sex or age ; confiscated their properties ; and compelled them to take an oath that they would go to the archbissiop whereso ever he resided ; the design of which was to distress him by their maintenance, or to strike him with con trition for their sufferings. This violent command, more violently executed by his officers than intended by himself, proved vain for his purpose, while it loaded him with odium.

Xn'_ different persons, particularly the French king. Punish- While Henry contended against the political usur here.ic\u00b0sf pation of power by the church, he was careful to 1 166. display a zeal for its doctrines. About thirty persons of both sexes, from Germany, had lived five years in England inoffensive and unmolested. Discovered at length to entertain some heretical notions, they were imprisoned, and examined, in the king's pre sence, in a synod at Oxford. Their general answer was that \" they were christians, and venerated the doctrines of the apostles.\" Their particular tenets are unknown, as we cannot rely on the accounts given us. They were, however, condemned, and deliver ed for punissiment to the secular power. As heresy had until then been unknown among the English, the mode of punissiment was a subject of consideration. They were branded in the forehead with a hot iron ; their clothes were cut so as to leave the upper part of the body naked from the waist ; they were horri bly lacerated with whips, and driven thus naked and bleeding into the open fields, where they all perissied miserably in the cold of winter, as none were per mitted to afford them the least relief, They are said to have triumphed in their condemnation, as mar tyrs expecting a glorious reward.

Preparatory to the sentence of excommunication, which he was fully determined to pronounce against Henry"], [351, "BRITISH ILANDS. 327 Chap, XIV Henry so soon as ecclesiastical forms and the pope's acquiescence would admit, he wrote letters of ad- monition and commination to that prince, in which he plainly avowed the doctrine of obedience due from kings to prelates. In the mean time he found pretences for excommunicating several friends of the king and for suspending the bishop.of Salisoury. The clergy of England, alarmed, appealed in a body to the pope, and notified this to their primate in an eloquent letter, in which his misdeeds were severely arraigned. But quite in his favour, in such a con- troversy, was the wretched superstition of the age, of which he failed not to make full advantage. In his plaintive epistles, which he sent into all quarters, he assumed as a matter conceded and indubitable, that the cause, for which he was contending, was the cause of God : he arrogated the dignity of spiri- tual father and master of the king and all the peo- ple of England : and asserted that, in the pronoun- cing of judgement against him by a secular court, Christ had been a second time crucified. At the sepulchre of Saint Dransius at Soissons, the patron of combatants, he spent a whole night in prayer, by which ceremony a champion was supposed to be rendereddnvincible. Having by this and other arti- fices raised high the public expectation, he was pro- ceeding to fulminate the terrible sentence, when he was obliged to defer it by a request from Lewis, on account of a sickness which had seized the Englissi monarch, then supposed dangerous, though it hap pily proved of ssiort duration. He however, in the most solemn manner, excommunicated many ser- vants"], [352, "HISTORY OF THE 328 Chap. XIV vants of the crown in particular, and all in the mass who ssiould enforce or observe the constitutions of Clarendon, the whole of which he condemned, though some of them had been tolerated by the pope. Henry, who was then in France, summoned a great council to Chinon in Touraine for advice how to resist the violence of Becket, who, the king said, was endeavouring \" to destroy both his body and foul.\" No other expedient could be found against the impending sentence than an appeal to the pope. Thus was this great monarch obliged to sanction by his own act that right of appeal which by his consti tutions of Clarendon he had attempted to abolish. At the fame time, however, he neglected not the exertions of the temporal power. To prevent the operation of an interdict, which, notwithstanding the appeal, might be laid on his kingdom by the primate, he commanded all the ports of England to be strictly guarded ; all persons, carrying letters for that purpose, to be seized ; and all priests, who ssiould obey such letters, to be punished by emascu lation. Notwithstanding the most vigilant precau- tions, letters were delivered by a person unknown, notifying to the Englissi bissiops the legatine power over England, with which Becket was invested, and summoning them to his presence within forty days. Such was the dread of pontifical resentment, that even those prelates, who bore the greatest hatred to Becket, and greatest attachment to their king, dared not to disobey the mandate of the former, though by that the authority of the latter was directly vio- lated."], [353, "329 BRITISH ILAKDS. Chap. XIV 1167 1163. lated. But the mandate was annulled, soon enough to prevent the voyage of the bithops, by a success ful negociation at Rome, where, by the interest of an Italian prince and other influencing causes, among which were doubtless bribes, Henry had obtained that two cardinals ssiould be sent, as legates a lalere, with full powers to hear, and to determine by a de finitive sentence, the cause of Becket with the En glish monarch and appellant prelates. The king's agents on this occasion even procured and brought to him all the letters which Becket and others had written to the pope against Henry, who thus dis covered some secret enemies. Great was the astonissiment of Becket, who would probably have been deposed from the primacy if the French monarch had not interfered with ardent zeal in his favour. The pope, intimidated, sent an order after the legates in their journey, by which their power was limited to the office of mediators. He also engaged the mother of Henry, the empress Matilda, in a mediation, which was ended by her death at Rouen in the September of 1167. As the inflexible primate could not be persuaded to yield without his reservations, the legates, who came into France in the October of the fame year, unable to accomplissi the object of their mission, returned to Rome, having previously received a renewal of the appeal of the king and clergy, by which another year was gained of protection from Becket's power. Tedious is the narrative of negociations, intrigues, aid conferences, of the contending parties. In one of these conferences in which Lewis was pre sent, Henry is said to have spoken thus ; \" Let the primate"], [354, "3 30 HISTORY OF THE Chap, primate behave to me in what manner the greatest vji!^, and holiest of his predecessors have behaved to the least of mine, and I shall be satisfied.\" The pro- tection from Becket's intended sentence was again prolonged ; but on the failure of the atempt of two nuncios, sent by the pope to mediate an agree 1169. ment in 1169, little hope remained of the spiritual thunder being much longer deferred. The strictest orders were issued throughout England, with violent menaces, to prevent the introduction, promulgation, and efficacy of hostile mandates. All of every class were also commanded to bind themselves by an oath to the observance of these orders. This was univer sally taken by the laity, but rejected by the clergy, who chose rather to be in open rebellion against their king, than to offend the sovereign pontiff. Let ters also of absolution from this oath were secretly conveyed to the laity ; but that many of them wissied to avail themselves of it we are not informed. 1370. Notwithstanding this state of affairs, Henry, who, to secure the succession to his eldest son against at- tempts of usurpation, had resolved to have the cere- mony of coronation, after the example of the French monarchs, performed on that prince while himself was yet reigning, found means to procure from the pope a letter to the archbissiop of York, commanding him to be the officiating prelate on this occasion. This artful pontiff, of whose double dealing several instances are found in this complica- ted contest, soon after granted to Becket a mandate, in which the office of crowning was declared to be his peculiar privilege, as archbishop of Canterbury, and all other prelates were strictly prohibited from attempting"], [355, "BRITISH ILANDS. 351 attempting to officiate. Notwithstanding that the Chap. \\* TV ports were most watchfully guarded, the primate succeeded so far as to transmit this mandate, with his own prohibitory letters, into England ; but those to whom they were entrusted, dared not to produce them. A. similar fate attended his letters of inter dict. The coronation was performed, without oppo sition, in the June of 1170, in the abbey of West- minster. As a time was fixed by the pope, after the termi- Hiscom- r \u25a0 . . promise nation of which Henry could no longer escape the wi,h Hen thunders of Rome, if he ssiould not, in the interim, ry have accommodated his difference with Becket, an u'\u00b0 agreement, after many ineffectual proposals, was at length concluded in the following terms; \" that, for the love of God, of the pope, and of the church of Rome, the king would permit the archbissiop of Canterbury to return in safety to his church, and to hold and enjoy it in peace, and all his possessions, as he had held them before his flight from England ; and that all who had been banissied on his account should be restored in like manner.\" The kiss of peace, which was then a Customary form in all re conciliations, remained still an obstacle. The king declared that he was prevented from giving it mere ly by a rassi oath which he had taken against it, and proposed that his son ssiould perform the ceremony in his place : but Becket, whose object was the hu miliation of his sovereign, would admit no proxy ; and the king, with the pope's absolution, at length complied. In the July of 11 70 he met in public, near Fretteval in Orleanois, this contumacious pre- late,"], [356, "HISTORY OF THE 332 Chap XIV Vie, assas- Srja.ion. 1170, late, who, totally unmoved by a most courteous con descension, complained of ill treatment, and after wards boasted in letters to the pope that the .king was considered not only as conquered but even per jured. Very probably, as Lyttleton observes, if Henry had possessed the inflexible spirit of the arch bissiop, he would have braved the utmost vengeance of Rome, to the hazard, or even loss, of all his continental dominions, rather than submit to a peace with a rebellious subject, who, .instead of submission, arrogated superiority. The vulnerable state of these dominions was doubtless the cause of the temporiz ing conduct of this great prince, who in England might have weathered all the fury of the storm. After two other conferences, and some altercation, with his sovereign, Becket concluded an exile of above six years by his arrival in England on the first of the following December. Still determined on hostility, notwithstanding his apparent pacification, he had sent before him letters, by which, under dis cretionary powers from the pope, he excommuni cated two bissiops, and suspended the archbissiop of York on account of the young king's coronation. Attended by a numerous mob with ssiouts of ap plause, but visited by few persons of distinction, and insulted by several of the king's officers, he paraded through Canterbury and London ; but received a command from the young king to retire to his church of Canterbury. There, on christmas-day, he pro nounced an anathema against most persons of Hen ry's court, and excommunicated some of his prin cipal officers by name. But on the twenty-ninth of the"], [357, "BRITISH ILANDS. 333 Chap XIV the fame month a period was put to his violent pro ceeding by the arrival of four knights, who had come with a resolution to force him to a revocation of his spiritual censures, to bring him in bonds to Henry in France, or, if these ssiould prove imprac ticable, to kill him. The excommunicated bissiops had hasted from England to implore the protection of their sovereign, who, yielding to one of those violent fits of passion to which he was unfortunately subject, exclaimed against \" the ingratitude and cowardice of his cour tiers, none of whom would revenge his injuries on a turbulent priest, who had driven him and his chil dren from the throne.\" These unguarded expres sions, uttered without object or design, and no longer retained in the mind of Henry, produced such ef fect on four knights of his household, that, com municating mutually their sentiments, and forming their plan, they privately withdrew, and, taking dif ferent roads to baffle pursuit, arrived at the same time in the neighbourhood of Canterbury. Finding that by no menaces could the archbissiop be moved to absolve the excommunicated, they attempted to drag him from the church at the time of evening service, but were prevented by his struggling and clinging to a pillar. Enraged by his resistance and opprobri ous language, one of the four, named Reginald Fitz urse, made a blow with his sword, which almost severed from the body the interposed arm of a monk, and wounded Becket in the head. By a third stroke, which he received in a praying attitude with joined hands, he was prostrated. His ssiull was afterwards cloven"], [358, "33+ Chap, XIV Proceed ings of Henry. 1171 HISTORY OF THE cloven and his brains scattered on the pavement be fore the altar. Thus fell without a groan this ex\u00ab traordinary man, actuated by a most inordinate am bition, to which he seems to have sacrificed every moral obligation and even the comforts of life. Commencing in hypocrisy, he appears to have been so heated by an unexpected force of resistance in a long protracted and vehement contest, as to have de termined, with a fierce and implacable spirit, either to gain the object of his ambition, with vengeance on his opponents, or to suffer death in the attempt ; as in the latter case he was certain of being honour ed as a martyr in that age of deplorable ignorance, and of thereby causing odium and distress to the ob jects of his malice. The assassins, not daring to re turn to the king, retired, unmolested by the popu lace, to a castle in Yorkssiire, where they remained many months. That they ssiould be delivered for penance to the apostolical see, instead of being pu nissied by the civil power, was agreeable to the pre judices of the times. They accordingly went in a voluntary manner to Rome, whence they were or dered for penance to Jerusalem. Nothing further indubitable is known concerning them, except that one of them was alive many years after in the reign of John. Henry had immediately, on discovering the ab sence of the four knights, sent to all the seaports of Normandy to prevent their passage into England ; but the order was too late. He had also sent direc tions to the young king to arrest the archbishop, but before that could be effected he was already slain. On receipt"], [359, "BRITISH ILANDS. 335 Chap, XIV. receipt of this intelligence, the king, who saw at once how enormous would be the odium excited by the murder of such a champion of the church with such circumstances, was seized with inexpressible grief. He continued three days secluded from all sustenance and comfort. On the fourth he was rous ed by pressing solicitations to take measures for his safety. A letter was immediately sent, and an em bassy prepared, for his exculpation to the pope. From the gloomy state of mind into which he was thrown, he abstained, solitary in his palace, during forty days, from all amusement, exercise, and busi ness. His ambassadors were so ill received by the pope, who had been enflamed by the enemies of Henry, particularly by king Lewis, that they almost despaired of success. Finding that a serious resolu tion was taken to pronounce, on the Thursday be fore Easter, an excommunication on the king's per son, and an interdict on all his dominions, they so far exceeded their instructions as to take an oath in the consistory, that their master had commissioned them to promise his obedience to the mandates of his Holiness in this business. When a delay of the sentence had thus been procured, three other ambas sadors, who arrived later, declined to take the fame oath. Censures were then uttered, less violent, however, than those which had been menaced ; and even these were soon suspended through the influ ence of his friends, aided very probably by large pecuniary distributions.

ROM a particular history of Ireland from the earliest accounts to the beginning of the nineteenth century, which I have publissied in the year 1805, I abridge my relation of its geography and transac tions in this more extensive work. In magnitude the second of the British stands, the third of all deno minated European, Ireland lies westward of Britain, from which it is parted by the Irish sea, called also Saint George's Channel. This tract of water va ries in breadth from forty to fourteen leagues, ex cept where it is contracted into a narrower space be tween the county of Down and the coast of North- Britain, and a still smaller, of only four leagues in breadth, betvVeen the north point of the county of Antrim and the Mull of Kyntire on the Scottissi coast. Oblong, and far more compact in its figure Vol. I. L than"], [362, "5S5 Chap XV Inlet., Contour HISTORY OF THE than Britain, but still irregular, this iland narrows from the middle with various inequalities, to the north-east and south-west ; contracting suddenly in in the former direction, and then somewhat dilating, so as to present in that quarter a kind of rounded peninsula ; in some degree gibbous on the south east ; and of a serrated form on the south-west. Ex posed all along the western side to the whole fury of the Atlantic, which swells to a tremendous height, and breaks with inconceivable violence on its ssiores, its coast is there more angled and indented than else where, and is more bordered with Hands, which ap pear to have been rent from the main land by the irruptions of that boisterous element. The chief inlets, which pierce the ssiores of Ire land, are on the west and south-west. In the words of Beaufort, in his Memoir of Ireland, \" those in dented coasts, which present innumerable promonto ries to the fury of the vast Atlantic, form in their deep recesses some of the noblest havens in the world ; havens so secure and capacious, that in seve ral of them the whole navy of Great-Britain might ride in perfect safety.\" The most commodious is the bay of Bantry, twenty-six Englissi miles in length, six in breadth, every where deep, in some places not less than forty fathoms, ssieltered with high and steep ssiores of rock, but quite safe and clear from rocks in the channel. In a vast moor, or turfbog, named the bog of Allen, which has a position not far from central, the plan of the soil, or platform of Ireland, has its greatest elevation, an elevation hardly exceeding two hundred"], [363, "BRITISH ILANDS. 339 Chap XV. Face. hundred and seventy feet, yet more than sufficient to give a declivity for the greatest rivers of the country. Through this bog, which is apparently level, runs the main spine of the iland, separating the waters of the Shannon from those which flow eastward to the Irish channel, and southward to the ssiores of Munster and the ocean. Founded on an immense rock or bed of granite, which rises from the bottom of the deep, Ireland contains no such extensive tracts of mountains as Britain ; nor any such low fenny flats as that iland ; nor has ssie any hills of chalk, nor, with exception of the ssiores, large tracts of sand ; but a soil more commonly of a gravelly nature, with a substratum of stone mostly calcareous, interspersed with argil laceous, ferrugineous, and other kinds of matter. The rock, which forms the substratum, rises very frequently naked to the view, almost continually meeting the eye of the traveller, not only on the eminences, but also in the plains. Collectively sur veyed, Ireland is not mountainous. Many parts are level, some quite flat, and many uneven with hills of no considerable magnitude. The most ex tensive level,, are about the middle of the iland, where a vast plain stretches quite across from sea to sea, from the coast of Dublin to the bay of Galway, including in its extent the bog of Allen. In gene ral the maritime parts, particularly the western, are more mountainous thar. the interior; yet the moun tains are so distributed, that we find sew places \" in which the prospect is not somewhere terminated by this species of majestic scenery, forming a back Z 2 ground.\""], [364, "s+o C'lAP XV. Bogt HISTORY OF THE ground,\" fays Beaufort, \" seldom more remote than twenty miles.\" Such in fact is their distribution, and such are the prospects which they afford over extensive plains or waving surfaces, lakes of various extent, and sine streams of water gliding through the most beautifully verdant lands, as if nature had intended this iland for a region of landscape, and a lavissi variety of charming scenes. Here are no dead unvaried flats whose dull uniformity fatigues the view ; nor are the eminences commonly other than such as serve to create a pleasing variety in the pros pect, or to add majesty to the scene. Yet numerous turfbogs, not only on the sum mits and sides of mountains, but also in the plains, tend in some degree to deform the aspect of the country, or, as it were, to darken its complexion. IVJany of these are capable of being converted into excellent ground, and, where they occupy not too great a proportion of the land, they compensate for their russet or sable hues by the abundance of fuel which they furnissi. Nor are morasses of this kind pernicious to the health of man. As Beaufort has justly observed, \" the bog waters, far from emitting putrid exhalations, like stagnant pools and marssies, are of an antiseptic and strongly astringent quality ; as appears by their preserving through ages, and even adding to, the durability of the timber, which we find universally buried beneath their surfaces ; and from their converting to a sort of leather the skins of men and animals, who have had the mis fortune of being lost, and of remaining in them for any length of time.\" Far the most extensive is the bog"], [365, "_.+ _ Chap. XV. Mountains, BRITISH ILANDS. bog of Allen, stretching hardly less than seventy miles in length. The mountains of Ireland are variously arranged ; some insulated by surrounding plain, or vallies, some extended in ranges, but molt of them collected in irregular groups, or in unconnected masses of dif- ferent magnitudes. They have a great variety of forms, and not less various acclivity. They are in ge- neral of easy ascent, affording pasturage, and even admitting culture, far above their bases, but some are also of a precipitous aspect, and some of consi- derable height, towering aloft in the form of cones, or piercing the ssiies with spiral summits. None, however, in this iland can be said to be of great alti- tude ; the highest being much inferior to the peak of Snowdon, which is itself surpassed by several others in Britain. Referring the reader to the third volume of Terraquea for more particular informa- tion, I shall here only instance, that in the counties of Mayo and Galway, where a broad projecting tract, not unlike Wales in its prominent figure and rugged face, advances, as it were, to oppose the rage of the ocean, many gloomy masses of mountains darken the aspect of the land, and render some parts almost impracticable to the traveller. Two of supereminent majesty, perhaps the highest in Ireland, Nephin and Croagh-Patrick, both in Mayo, rear their lofty heads, the former to the altitude of eight hundred and eighty yards, the latter eight hundred and eighty eight, above the level of the sea. Croagh-Patrick is a vast ridge, the summit of which appears to the eye a monstrous"], [366, "5+2 Chap XV Rivers, Lakes, HISTORY OF THE a monstrous cone, perfectly regular, and is discerni ble at the distance of sixty miles. This iland is not less diversified with lakes and rivers than with hills and mountains. Of all the British stands, which in general so abound in water, none is more copiously supplied with that element than Ireland. The earth, as the air, is replete with moisture. The lakes contribute much to beautify the face of nature, and still more the rivers, as the finest and most fertile grounds are commonly situate on their banks ; but, on account of the rocky chan nels in which they flow, few of them are navigable without interruption through any great length of course. Such impediments might be removed, and an extensive inland navigation formed to the vast emolument of the public. The Shannon, by which with the Ern a great portion of Ireland in the west is peninsulated, nearly in like manner as a similar tract in the west of Britain is by the Severn and Dee, is the greatest river of the British ilands, wind ing through a course of a hundred and eighty-six miles, and spreading into large lakes interspersed with ilands. Next in magnitude are the rivers called the three sisters, the Barrow, the Nore, and the Suir, rising from the elevated tract in which are the bog of Allen and the ridge of Sleeve-Bloom, and, alter a mutual deflexion and approach, pouring their united streams into the harbour of Waterford. Of lakes Ireland contains a considerable number, especially in the west and north. Lough Neagh ex tends to the length of eighteen Englissi miles, oc cupies an area of above ninety thousand Englissi acres,"], [367, "BRITISH ILANDS. 343 Chap XV ' i \u00bb Air, acres, and is navigable by ships of considerable bur den. This lake is almost destitute of ilands ; but lough Ern contains in its two basons, between three and four hundred. Of these basons, which are con nected by a winding channel six miles long, one ex tends to the length of ten, the other to that of thir teen miles. Lough Lane in the county of Kerry, consisting in like manner of two lakes, is the most celebrated of all. These two glassy basons, over looked by stupendous mountains ; bordered with pendent woods most delightfully variegated ; orna mented with the most romantic verdant ilands ; re sounding on all sides with water-falls and the rever berations of a most extraordinary commixture of echoes ; combine an assemblage of beauties, per haps unparalleled, at least far surpassing all power of language to express. As winds from westerly, and still more from south westerly points, predominate so much that they may be said to blow three-fourths of the year on this iland, which on all sides, except the eastern, lies quite open to the Atlantic, its atmosphere is clouded and moist in the extreme ; yet not insalubrious, as being in a perpetual state of ventilation. Nothing can be more uncertain than the weather, or irregu lar than the seasons ; but, in general, ssiowers are very frequent, especially in winter ; and the quan tity of rain, which falls in the year, is greater than in the southern parts of Britain in proportion to the area. The south-west and south winds prevail more in winter than in the other seasons ; the west in summer and autumn ; the south-east, east, north- east,"], [368, "HISTORY OF THE 344 Chap XV Tempera ture, Fertility, east, and north in spring. Storms are vastly more frequent in autumn and winter than in spring or summer, and are found to come oftener in the months of November, December, January, and February, than in the equinoxial months of March and Sep tember. As the air is more moist, so is the temperature more mild than in South-Britain, both with respect to cold and heat, especially the former. Snow of a month's duration on the plains is a rare phenome non ; and some winters are seen without either frost or snow in that situation. Yet, though the winter is, in general, surprisingly mild, so as frequently to be too warm for strenuous exercise, the cold, mo derate as it is, continues commonly seven or eight months ; fires in chambers being requisite from about the middle or end of September to the middle of May. The seasons are later than in South-Britain ; the spring and autumn more tardy in their approach, as also the winter ; the fall of the leaf being later than in England. The humid and rainy atmosphere of Ireland is well adapted to its rocky soil, which is naturally far more fertile than that of Britain, even than that of England, which of Britain is far the richest part ; but its fertility is more conspicuous in the grafs than in the corn ; the excessive moisture, so beneficial to the former, being pernicious to the latter. Thus the wheat is inferior in weight and colour to that of drier countries ; the crops are liable to be injured, and the labours to be interrupted, by unseasonable rains. Besides, how great soever may be the natu- ral"], [369, "BRITISH ILANDS. 34 ral superiority of the Irissi soil, it is in acquired fer- ChaPi tility far inferior to that of England, which has been xv improved by the successive labours of many genera tions. Ireland is still destitute of some species of birds, An\u2122als fissi, and other animals, which are found in her great sister iland. Magpies and frogs, which are now very numerous, were here unknown, until they were introduced from Britain, the latter toward the commencement of the eighteenth century. Moles, toads, and all kinds of serpents, are still unknown. If serpents cannot live in Ireland, which appears to me a very doubtful point, the cause is most probably to be found in the deficiency of heat. The greatest length of Ireland, from north-east to south-west, is three hundred and six Englissi miles ; its greatest breadth two hundred and seven, and its area which has been mostly under-rated, contains, conceived as a flat surface, about twenty millions of Englissi, or above twelve millions of Irissi acres. This Division. area, with respect to civil distinctions, is divided into four provinces, which are subdivided into thirty-two counties, and these again into two hundred and fif ty-two baronies. The province of Munster contains six counties ; Leinster twelve ; Connaught five ; and Ulster nine. The largest of all the counties is Cork, which contains almost a million and fifty thousand Irissi acres ; and the least is Louth, which has hardly a hundred and eleven thousand. To derive their origin from ancestors of ancient National renown and polissied manners has been the ambition vam y' of every people, in a state of glimmering know- ledge,"], [370, "316 Chap XV Periods of Irish histo ry. HISTORY OF THE ledge, between the darkness of barbarism and the illumination of literature. Of this puerile vanity, which endures not the light of historical research, Ireland has had its portion. The curiosity of readers, desirous to be instructed in the uninteresting fables of Irissi antiquity, may be satisfied, without more extensive examination, by the perusal of the history given by Keating, and of the Ogygia of O'Flaherty. Refutations of such fictions, and attempts of a judi cious nature to select from the rubbish of romantic story some disfigured and obscure facts, may princi pally be found in the Antiquities of Ledwich and the Strictures of Campbell. That in the ages anterior to the birth of Christ the affairs of this country are utterly unknown and inscrutable, is the result of the most laborious and accurate researches. As dark ness impenetrable rests on this period of Irissi trans actions, so hardly a few glimmering rays of light appear between the incarnation of our Saviour and the introduction of christian worssiip into this iland, toward the middle of the fifth century. Even after this happy event very little authentic matter can be collected, beyond the affairs of the church, and some actions of religious and literary men, till the invasion of the Englissi under Henry the second, when Commences a more authentic, regular, and connected chain of events. Thus the periods of time, with respect to Irish transaction, may not im properly be denominated the unknown, the fabu lous, the legendary, and the historical ; the first ending about the time of the incarnation ; the se cond near the middle of the fifth century ; the third rl"], [371, "BRITISH ILANDS. 3 17 at the Englissi invasion in 1 170 ; and the fourth ex- Chap. tending from that event to the present time. __> That the Ph\u0153nicians, the renowned navigators of Ph\u0153ni. antiquity, were not unacquainted with the coasts of cians> &c> Ireland, might from some circumstances appear pro bable without any authority of ancient writers. The fact was believed by the poet Festus Avienus, who expressly informs us, in his Ora Maritima, that he had extracted from the Ph\u0153nician Annals the ac count which he has left us of the voyage of Himilco the Carthaginian, where he mentions this iland. That the Greeks had received some obscure account of this country, probably through the medium of the Ph\u0153nicians, four or five centuries before Christ, we learn from the Argonautics under the name of Orpheus, a poet supposed cotemporary with Pisis tratus the Athenian. I have in my second chapter marked the mention of it by Aristotle, or some other ancient writer in his name, under the appella tion of lerne. More known to the Romans, it was noticed by several writers in very early periods of the christian era, chiefly by Ptolemy. Of the state of its inhabitants, except their barbarism, we are not informed by these writers. Its name has been Name, imagined of Celtic origin, Eri, Erin, Iere, or Iris, by which was believed to be denoted its western site with regard to Europe. Others consider the origi nal term as Gothic, signifying the farther ile. From this perhaps are derived the names Ouerni, Juverna, and Hibernia. The appellation of Scotia, which it retained till the end of the tenth century, is of a more recent date, and from a Gothic source. Ire- land"], [372, "318 HISTORY OF THE Chap, land is only a compound of a Gothic epithet with XV \u2022 . \u2022 y_^_* its primitive denomination. That this iland was first colonized by Celtic tribes Cits. , \u201e . , of the Gailic race seems hardly to admit a doubt, but when and whence they arrived are questions un answerable. Most probably they came from Wales and Cornwall, expelled by the Cumri. Of these primitive colonists, who were doubtless illiterate and savage, no history can be given ; nor could a narra tive of their transactions be other than disgusting by a uniform repetition of petty wars and acts of bar barian ferocity. Their first arrival may have hap pened nine or ten centuries before the christian era, and later by six or seven may have been the first in vasion made by Gothic people. Of the Celts and Goths. Goths I have treated already in my second chapter. The first colonists of Gothic or Scythian race in Ire land may have been Belgians, probably the Firbolgs of ancient Irissi tradition. They appear to have esta blissied some of their earliest settlements in the south eastern parts, the maritime tracts of the modern counties of Waterford and Wexford, where Ptole my found inhabitants distinguissied by the names of Menapii and Cauci, appellations belonging to Belgic tribes on the continent ; and where, in the baronies of Bargy and Forth, a people now dwells, distin guissied by a peculiar dialect from the rest of the modern Irissi, probably the descendants of the an- cient Belgians, with a great intermixture of Englissi colonists. As we are led by circumstances to suppose that the Belgian Goths furnissied the earliest colonies to Ire- land,"], [373, "BRITISH ILANDS. 3*_> land, after the tribes of Celtic denomination; so Chap. likewise have we good grounds to conjecture that the xv- Scandinavian Goths were the next and more fre quent colonizers of this country. Among these ap pear to have been the Tuatha-de-Danans, reported in Irissi tradition to have practiced the fancied arts of magical incantation ; arts vulgarly attributed in former ages to tribes inhabiting the regions of the Baltic. These invaders of Ireland, whose name seems translatable into Lord-Danes, a term familiar in Englissi history, are called also Danmonians, and may perhaps have been Danes, whose national ap pellation might have been some ages earlier known to the Irissi and other northerns than to the Komans. This is merely conjecture : but that Ireland, at least so early as the fourth century, was in possession of the Scots, the fame probably as the Goths or Scy thians in the original sound and import of the term, we have sufficient authority, particularly that of the poet Claudian ; whence the name of Scotia was given to this iland ; that of Scots, with a circumscribed and altered signification, to its inhabitants indiscri minately. As the celebrated Romans never sent an invading Romans. army into Ireland, thus abandoned to primeval igno rance, we have no accounts of Irissi revolutions from Roman writers, nor information, beyond their weak ness and barbarism, concerning the government and manners of the people. From Tacitus we learn that, about the eightieth year of the christian era, an Irissi chief, expelled by domestic faction, took refuge with Agricola, then warring in Britain, who was assured that,"], [374, "HISTORY OF THE 350 Chap, XV, Fables, that, for the subjugation of Ireland, one legion, which consisted of between six and seven thousand men, would, with a few auxiliary troops, be fully sufficient. Thus, though the ports of this iland were in that age, according to the fame authority, which is in this case supposed by some erroneous, more fre quented by merchants than those of Britain, which might seem to imply a less incivility of manners, yet disunion and distraction evidently prevailed. Oro sius, a writer of the fifth century, has recorded that a body of Scythians, driven from Gallicia in Spain by the Roman emperor Constantine, chose Ireland for their asylum, where they found a kindred people, the Scyths or Scots ; a testimony consonant with the results of laborious researches made elsewhere by the best of our antiquarian authors. As the notices of ancient Ireland by Roman wri ters, though mostly clear and authoritative, are of too limited a nature to give more than very scanty information ; so the accounts of the Irissi, concern ing the transactions of their country, previous to the fifth century of the christian era, though suffi ciently copious, are of so romantic or fabulous a complexion, as to afford no certain light, and to leave us to conjecture by extraneous aids. They are in great part manifest forgeries, fabricated, after the introduction of Christianity into this iland, by monks and other dreamers. Such accounts as may seem, with any colour of probability, to have a claim to be regarded as founded in fact, must have been collected from the songs of the bards, the belt vehicle for the conveyance of oral tradition. Bat the"], [375, "BRITISH ILANDS. 351 the original matter of songs, unwritten and commit- Chap. ted merely to memory, is liable, by interpolations xv and alterations, in a course of ages, to be inexpli cably disguised, or irrecoverably lost. Such I sus pect to be the case with the famous poems under the name of Ossian, concerning which an extraor dinary imposition was attempted on the public, in the latter part of the eighteenth century, by James Mac Pherson, a Scottissi writer. Of these the most genuine, collected by the ingenious Doctor Matthew Young, in the first volume of the Royal Irissi Aca demy's transactions, appears to me to have received some interpolation so lately at least as the ninth cen- tury, if not much more lately. By the writers of our historical romances we are Colonie*. told, that five successive colonies arrived in Ireland, the followers of Partholanus, those of Nemedius, the Firbolgs, the Tuatha-de-Danans, and the Mi lesians. Of the third and fourth I have already spoken : the rest I consider as totally fabulous. These colonies, however, are said to have been Scythian ; so that, since the Celts, the aboriginal inhabitants, from whom the modern Irissi derive, at least in some proportion, their blood and language, remain un noticed even by the writers of romantic story, the opinion of the learned Pinkerton seems well found ed, who asserts that the history of this country is only the history of the Goths in Ireland. The Irissi Language. tongue, perhaps, beside the Welch, the only re maining dialect of the Celtic, is in great part com posed of Gothic words, so disguised by adaptation to its peculiar form, that to discriminate what is ge- nuinely"], [376, "HISTORY OF THE 352 Chap, XV Stories. nuinely Celtic is a matter of much difficulty. Such indeed is the corruption and instability of this Ian guage, confused with a jargon of strange dialects, destitute of any determinate rules of conjugation, declension, syntax, orthography, or pronunciation, uncertain in the meaning of old terms, and flexible to the purposes of systematic writers, that conclusions drawn from it, in points of any importance in his. tory, ought not to be admitted without the strictest caution. Attempts have been made to prove a close affinity between the Irissi and Ph\u0153nician languages. If this affinity could be indisputably evinced, we could only thence infer, that the rude Celtic tribes, who colonized this iland, were a branch of that great family of nations, which has ramified into the Hebrews, Ph\u0153nicians, Chald\u00e6ans, and Arabs. It could not, as I have shewn in my History of Ireland, demonstrate that the ancient Irissi were a Ph\u0153nician colony. The romantic historians of this country have given us a list of a hundred and eighteen successive mo narchs of Ireland, from Heremon, a son of the ima ginary Milesius, to Laogaire, in whose reign Chris tianity here acquired an establissiment. These are all, with very little exception, represented as having fallen by homicide hands, each by those of his im mediate successor. Elence we mjy infer a tumul tuary state of society in the times when the authors of these accounts lived, who, by natural consequence, might have no idea of. any other. In the writings of these, and the songs of the bards, are some stories which appear to have allusions to facts, or some foundation"], [377, "BRITISH ILANDS. 353 Chap. XV. foundation in truth. Thus, in the first or second cen tury of the christian era, when we have reason to believe that bands of Scandinavians had formed set tlements in Ireland, we are told that Cairbre-Cait can of the Danmonian race usurped the chief power by the slaughter of the ancient royal family ; but, after an interval of a few years, the native princes are said to have recovered their former eminence. A domestic misfortune is related of Tuathal Teacht mar, a monarch the second in succession from Cair bre Caitcan, which entailed a punissiment on a large portion of the iland. Eochaid, king of Leinster, married to a daughter of this monarch, contrived by perfidy to gain a sister of his queen to the indulgence of his criminal passion, which occasioned by grief the death of both these ladies. Their incensed father had recourse to arms, and imposed on the country of Leinster, for the crime of its chief, a perpetual fine, called the Baromean tribute, which was ordered to be paid every second year, and to consist of a certain number of cattle, furniture, garments, and at least three thousand ounces of silver. Whether Con of the hundred battles, a monarch so styled from his numerous conflicts in civil warfare, had existence or not is a doubtful point; but Fin Mac Comhal, the hero of Ossian's poems, appears to have been a for midable chieftain of Scandinavian origin, to have married a daughter of Cormac Longbeard, the king of Ireland, i-o have commanded a bo*dy of troops called Fiona- Erion, in the latter part perhaps of the third century, and to have raised fortresses for the defense or suljection of the natives. Vol. I. A a The"], [378, "HISTORY OF THE 354 Chap. XV. The tribes in Ireland of Scandinavian descent ap. pear to have split into two factions, the Clan a Mome and the Clan a Boiskene, the former thus de nominated from a chief of that name, the latter from Boissiene, one of the ancestors of the hero Fin. This hero is supposed to have prevailed on the two factions to suspend their mutual animosities, and to unite with the aboriginals for the protection of the country against new invaders. After his de cease, the colonists, under the conduct of his son Ossiin, aided by fressi bands of adventurers from the Gothic regions, appear to have renewed their hosti lities against the old natives in the reign of Cairbre Liffeachair, son of Cormac Longbeard. In these contests the ancient Irish are supposed to have in some degree balanced the superior arms and disci pline of their enemies by their numbers, their extra ordinary swiftness, and the fastnesses of their bogs and woods. Perhaps also the disunion and distractions of the aboriginals were balanced by the factions of their opponents under various leaders from various parts of the continent. The main forces of the two parties, the Scandinavians under Oscar, son of Oshin and grandson of the great Fin, the Irissi under a prince of Leinster, are said to have at length, in the fourth century, come to a pitched battle in the plains of Ardratho, where victory declared in favour of the latter, which at that time prevented the subjugation of Ireland. Though the colonists continued masters of the seaports, the Irissi princes appear to have re gained considerable power in the interior parts, es pecially if we believe the story of one, who, in the latter"], [379, "BRITISH ILANDS. 355 latter part of the fourth century, is reported to have Chap. been so successful in the subduing of chieftains, and ,_^___^ in the reception of pledges of obedience, that he had the title conferred on him of Nial of the nine hostages.

W HAT species of paganism prevailed among the ancient Irissi is uncertain. Druidism, the religion of the Gauls and British Cumraigs, before their con quest by the Romans, is reported in our traditional histories to have had place in Ireland, which appears not improbable. Of the druidic system I have spoken in my second chapter. That letters were not un known to the Gallic druids, though their use was prohibited in subjects of religion, I have also ob served not to be improbable : but we have no ssiadow of proof that the inhabitants of Ireland were acquainted with any alphabet before the introduc tion among them of the Roman characters. The letters, in which the Irissi language is written, only seventeen in number, are evidently of Roman form, transposed into a new alphabet under the name of bethluifnion, a compound of the names of its three first characters. Other marks or symbols formerly in"], [381, "BRITISH ILANDS. S57 in use, termed Ogum or Ogham, were only affect- Chap. edly obscure, or pedantic modes of writing, formed , * *, by a corruption of the Roman letters, like the runic figures of the Scandinavians. Generally people in a state of lettered barbarism, like the modern Turks, are observed to affect a perplexed manner of writing, preferring in several cases obscurity to perspicuity. The propagation of christian rites in this iland, lMr\u00b0duc- r . . <>on of which appears from some circumstances, particularly christian two allusive expressions of Saint Jerome, to have had place at least as early as the fourth century, made a grand epocha in its history, as\u201e together with some knowledge of divine revelation, the use of letters was introduced among the Irissi. Of the time ex actly when, and of the persons by whom, the inha bitants of Ireland first received the illumination of the Gospel, we cannot find more certain informa tion than when and by whom the people of Britain, or of any other country in Errope, were first en lightened by its introduction. We find the names, most probably fictitious, of Albe, Declan, Ibar, and Kieran, mentioned as precursors of Saint Patrick, who has been supposed the great apostle of the Irissi, to have come among them in the year 432, and to have effected the great work of their conversion. The sto ries related of this apostle, whatever dates are seve rally affixed to them, are doubtless legendary tales, or theological romances, fabricated four centuries after his imaginary existence. He is mentioned in no writing of authentic date anterior to the ninth century, a period replete with forged lives of saints ; while, beside the persuasive silence of other docu- ments,"], [382, "3.55 Chap XVI. Hand of Saints. HISTORY OF THE ments, he is quite unnoticed by Beda, Cogitofus, Adamnan, and Cummian, ecclesiastical writers of the intermediate time, who could not have omitted the name of so great a miffioner, if it had ever reached their ears. The accounts transmitted to us of the acts of Saint Patrick bear all the marks of legendary fiction, and appear no better founded than those of other fabulous champions of the church, whose tutelage, as patron saints, has been severally adopted, from the custom of the times, by the chris tian nations of Europe in the dark ages. Whoever were the happy instruments in the plant ing of Christianity in Ireland, their progress appears to have been slow in the conversion of the natives. So lately as the end of the sixth century paganism subsisted, perhaps predominated, in this country. Soon after this period, however, a universal, at least a general, adoption of the christian rites took place. The change was very probably completed by the clergy of South-Britain, who took refuge in Ireland from the fury of the Anglo-Saxon pagans, the con querors of their territories. So many monasteries and seminaries of learning were here founded among a people, who, however barbarous in other respects, reverenced with pious awe the sanctity of religious establissiments, that the country about this time ac quired, and long afterwards retained, the glorious title of the Iland of Saints and Scholars. The pre eminence of Ireland in literature among the nations of Europe, in the dark or middle ages, was occa sioned not only by the safety of the asylum found by men of a contemplative turn, during the confu sions of the continent, in this sequestered ile, but also"], [383, "BRITISH ILANDS. . 359 also by the discouragement given to free inquiry and Chap. knowledge, so far as his influence extended, by the Ro- , ___, man pontiff, for the promotion of his scheme of spiri tual dominion, for which he knew ignorance to be the most powerful auxiliary. Ceremonies of pagan worssiip still remained amid the christian rites of the Irissi, particularly the religious use of fire, of which a memorial subsists in the present time, the declin ing practice of lighting bonfires on the eve preced ing the twenty-fourth of June. A perpetual fire, like that of the Roman Vesta, was continued at Kil dare, at least till the end of the twelfth century, preserved by the nuns of Saint Bridget, the succes sors of druidesses, to whom in earlier times that sa- cred charge had been committed. Though the monasteries of Ireland were sanctua- ries of learning, and of the best kinds of learning which were cultivated in Europe in these dark ages, yet literature was confined to the monasteries which are in their very nature detached from society, and had very little influence on the mass of the people, who doubtless remained immersed in bar- barism ; yet who, in their bloody intestine commo- tions, religiously respected these asylums of piety ; for the Irissi appear to have been in every period strongly affected with religious zeal. Of their govern- ment and manners in remoter ages we can only form a judgement from the state in which we find them after their adoption of Christianity, and of this we can form consistently with truth no favourable re presentation. The most ancient form of government, which can Govern be traced in Ireland, was that of an indefinite num- ment\" ber,"], [384, "360 HISTORY OF THE Chap, XVI ber, six, seven, or more, of chiefs, princes, or pro vincial kings, among whom whoever gained the supreme ascendancy arrogated for the time the title of king of Ireland, ard-riagh, or supreme monarch, receiving a kind of homage, and, where he could enforce the payment, exacting a tribute from the rest. Under each of these princes, whatever was their number, were several subordinate lords or to parchs, styled also riaghs or kings, who rendered to him in like manner fealty and tribute as he to the sovereign. So numerous were these that the princi pality of Munster alone contained eighteen. Sub ordinate again to each toparch were other chieftains, called tiarnas and canfinnies, heads of inferior clans, who obeyed or disobeyed their superiors, as they felt themselves prompted by convenience or caprice. For the support of the supreme ruler, presiding over the whole collection of dynasties, the country of Meath, consisting of the modern counties of East and West Meath, is said to have been appropriated as his peculiar domain ; but this appropriation is very doubtful, and is acknowledged to have at length en tirely lost existence. In the succession to the throne the right of election was vested in the people, but their choice was con fined to a particular family. In no regular form however ; but by force of arms, was the competi tion terminated. Hence we find that out of a line of near two hundred Irissi monarchs, named in a series in the historical writings of our authors, scarcely two in immediate succession, nor above thir ty in all, are related to have died otherwise than by violence."], [385, "BRITISH ILANDS. 361 Chap XVI Laws. violence. To obviate this evil, a custom was esta blished of electing a roidamna, a prince of the royal family, destined to assist the reigning monarch, and to succeed him at his death without further cere mony. This proved at best but a partial remedy. Sometimes the roidamna took arms against the mo narch : sometimes both fell victims to a faction more powerful. This mode of succession appears to have been universal in the system of Irissi government; successors termed thainifts or tanists being in similar manner chosen for the subordinate kintrs and to parchs. In the eighth century a new order in the disposal of the regal dignity is said to have taken place, an alternate election from two royal families of the Hy Nial race, the northern of Tyrone, and the southern, styled Clan Colman, seated in Meath. This had a natural tendency to augment still further the factions of the various tribes. An attentive and full view of the subject leads us to conclude, with Doc tor Campbell, that the \" epitome of the civil history of ancient Ireland is briefly this : divided and sub divided into a multitude of petty states, connected together by no bond of political union, cemented by no sense of common interest,\" the Irissi were inces santly distracted with intestine wars, and \" the body of the people were the abject dependants of an un certain set of barbarous chieftains, who used their wretched followers as the determined tools of their beggarly, yet bloody ambition.\" Laws in the Irissi tongue are found written in a style so obscure, even unintelligible, that thence, and from other circumstances, they are considered by some"], [386, "352 HISTORY OF THE Chap, some of great antiquity ; while others, from certain v_^\\^_, marks, regard their compilation as of so modern a date as times posterior to the Englissi invasion. The laws themselves, however, appear to have been in great part ancient, and to have been orally trans mitted, through successive generations, in a confra ternity of hereditary judges, termed brehons, who fat in the open air for the decision of causes, and whose decrees were highly respected by the people. From this respect, without which the judgements of the brehons must have been fruitless in so divided and tumultuary a state of government, and still more from other circumstances, the Irissi have been pro nounced by Lord Coke and Sir John Davis, the greatest lovers of justice. Their laws, however, though in many cases minute and equitable, were not cal culated, even with a most regular and steady execu tion, to produce a well-regulated system of society, since no crime, howsoever atrocious, was punissiable with death, but only by a fine called eric, which was adjusted by establissied rules to the nature of the offense. Some practices, inveterately sanctioned by custom among the Irissi, co-operated with the disorders of a fluctuating government to the prevention of im provement in their lands and manners. Among these was the mode of distribution, which, preclud ing all stability in the possession of land, withheld all incentives for the exertion of industry. On the death of any man, the moveable inheritance was equally divided among all his sons, without distinc tion of legitimate or illegitimate ; and, in failure of sons,"], [387, "363 BRITISH ILANDS. Chap XVI Manners, sons, among the next male heirs, to the total exclu sion of the females. When a tribe or community * lost one of its members by death or otherwise, a new distribution was made of all the lands of the district, among the families of the tribe : for no where among the Irish could the right of tenure sur- vive the possessor. From the law of gavelkind was this exception, that the mensal land, appropriated to the maintenance of the tanist, descended whole to the man elected to his place. In such a state of civil society we may well sup pose a rudeness in manners and modes of living. All ranks, even princes, dwelt in gloomy cabins, framed slightly with hurdles, and plastered with clay. About the center of the district inhabited by a clan. or sept, stood the dwelling of its chief within a for tified inclosure called a rath, into which the clan retired in emergencies of danger. These raths, en vironed sometimes with a wall, commonly wh a trench or trenches, furnissied frequently with sub terraneous chambers and f.llvports, and situated al ways on elevated grounds, were various in dimen sions, proportioned to the power and property of the toparch ; some having a diameter of only ten or fifteen yards, others an area of eighteen or twenty Englissi acres. The smaller species of these rude bulwarks, denominated raheens in modern Irish, ap pear to have been stations of smaller clans or sub divisions of a sept. We find also fortresses under the name of duns, originally seated on insulated rocks, but understood in the vulgar and promiscu- ous"], [388, "3t>_. Chip. XVI HISTORY OF THE ous use of the term as elevated forts either of rock or earth. From the multitude of raths we might naturally imagine a numerous population formerly in Ireland, if we were not apprised that such is inconsistent with a scanty agriculture, and that great numbers of raths may have been unoccupied, since the migration of septs from district to district, as of individuals from sept to sept, was not unusual. As hospitality, how ever liable to abuse, is a necessary virtue among a barbarous people, where no inns are afforded for the accommodation of travellers, the brehon laws en joined that the occupiers of a rath ssiould not be too sudden in the act of migration, lest the traveller ssiould be disappointed of his entertainment. Such provisions as the traveller might suppose his due by light of hospitality were exacted, under the title of tofhering and other denominations, by right of lega lized, but irregularly exercised authority, by the chief and his attendants, who lived at free quarter on the people. Fosterage prevailed among the Irissi, with the fame effects as among the Welch, which I have noted in my thirteenth chapter. A strong at tachment was also cemented by goffipred, which among the people of Ireland was regarded in a light of religious obligation. The acknowledged excellence of the Irish in music, whence ihe harp was chosen as the ensign of Ireland by Henry the eighth, may probably have been de rived from the Greeks, who brought into their country the ceremonies of christian worssiip. The bards and musicians, who, by efforts of art or ge- 11: US,"], [389, "BRITISH ILANDS. . 365 nius, delighted the fancies, and fired the passions, Chap. of the people, were held in veneration. They avail- ys, ed themselves of their influence to render their pro fession hereditary, and to appropriate to it large por tions of land. The food of the Irissi consisted chiefly of milk and flessi procured from their cattle, to which were added various wild herbs, as water cresses and sorrel. Wild swine, abundant in the fo rests of oak, which covered the land in great pro portion, furnissied a much esteemed aliment. From the improper use of such, or from the want of cor rectives, the leprosy was frequent. Corn, instead of being thressied, was freed by fire from the hulks and straw, was pounded and boiled, or ground with a hand-mill, and the bread baked in cakes under embers, or on an iron plate. The chief beverage was mead, on which account the preservation of bees was a particular object in the brehon laws. The dress of the ancient Irissi has been investi- 'Dllrf5 gated by Walker and Ledwich. A mantle or ssiort cloak, originally of ssiin, afterwards of cloth, com posed, for ornament, of stripes of different colours sewed together, was enlarged, in later times, into a cloak ; and a hood, attached to the mantle, was exchanged for a conical cap. A jacket, called fallin, and trowscrs descending to the feet, were worn, ex cept by the poorer sort, who seem to have been naked below. As their ssieep was mostly of the black sort, their garments were generally dark, ex cept their trowsers, which were often yellow. Of* the fame dye was the shirt, when such was worn, wide with large folds and sleeves of great size. The ftoe"], [390, "HISTORY OF THE 366 Chap, XV j. Obs. hia.

The beard was long, at least on the upper lip ; and a great bunch of hair over the forehead, called glibb or cooleen, was thrown into various forms, and tended to give a ferocity of aspect. Variations in dress and others matters were intro duced by the Danes and other foreigners, of whose transactions in Ireland, as of those of the natives, our accounts are obscure. We are furnissied with the names of thirty kings of Ireland, reigning in suc cession from Laogaire, the first christian monarch, ro Hugh Dorndighe, or Donchad Mac Domnail, in whose time the kingdom was ravaged by bands of Danissi invaders. Of the acts of these princes, or the events of that period, very little is recorded, ex cept the violent deaths, with which almost all the reigns concluded. Of Laogaire himself, who en tered on the regal function in the year 428, no fa vourable account, notwithstanding his conversion to Christianity, is given. Defeated and taken by the people of Leinster, in his invasion of their country to enforce the payment of the Baromean tribute, and re leased on his renunciation of that claim forever under a solemn oath, he violated his engagement, and fell in another battle by the swords of the Leinstrians, or, as others report, by a stroke of lightening. , Historical accounts of the Irish in the period of Danish invasions, obscure in general, seem written with respect to the transactions of these invaders with a studied obscurity, as if the writers intended to conceal"], [391, "3t>7 Chap. xvr. BRITISH ILANDS. conceal from posterity the conquests of these ra vagers. Facts contradictory one to another are fre quent in these narrations ; but, on a collective con sideration of the whole, we observe the Danissi in truders establissiing themselves in the permanent pos session of the ports and coasts, while a confused and desultory warfare is maintained between them and the Irish, between chieftains of the latter in domestic discord, and sometimes between parties of the in vaders themselves, as auxiliaries to Irissi princes, or in contest for property. Of the Danes I have given a general account in my fourth chapter. The first of their visits recorded to the coasts of Ireland was in 795. The landings of several ravaging parties are afterwards noticed ; but the great invasion was about the year 815, under Turgesius, Torgis, or Thorgils, a Norwegian adventurer, who, in the course of thirty years, laid waste the greater part of the iland. Resolving to reign over the country which he had plundered, he assumed the title of king of Ireland ; but, by some contrivance not au thentically related, he was seized and slain by Maol seaghlin, Melaghlin, or Malachy ; king of Meath; and the Irish, rising in great force, obliged the Ost men to retire from the interior of the kingdom. About the year 853, some fressi troops of Easter lings arrived in Ireland under Amlave, Sitric, and Ivar, which augmented so much the force of this people, that the conquest of the country might have probably been effected, if such had been their ob ject with united efforts ; but they appear to have been diverted by expeditions elsewhere, particularly to"], [392, "36S Chap, XVI. l.arer t rap fac- tions. +5 ! 10+ HISTORY OF THE to South-Britain. Doubtless the Danissi invaders of were at all times comparatively in small numbers; the poverty of the natives, little prac- ticed in any species of industry, affording few at- tractions to avarice, beside the furniture of religious houses. Except in Ulster, where Armagh was for years their principal post, their power seems never to have been firmly establissied, even in the time of Torgis, in the interior of this iland ; and their force, like that of the Irissi, appears to have been mostly in a state of disunion under several independent leaders. Possessed of the maritime towns, particu- larly Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, either built by themselves, or by more early emigrants from the Scandinavian regions, they gradually adopted a more settled mode of life, especially after their conversion to the christian worssiip, in the middle of the tenth, or according to others, in the ninth century, ex- changing their piratical habits for those of commer- cial navigation : but irregular wars continued still oc- casionally to subsist between the Irissi chiefs and the Danissi communities, of which the greatest was Dub- lin, whose principal magistrate was frequently styled king, sometimes king of Ireland by foreigners. The Danissi lords of Dublin were never acknow ledged as monarchs ot their country by the. Irissi. Of the kings of Ireland, from Hu^h Dorndi^he, already mentioned, called also Edan Oinaid, to Ro derick O'Connor, the last Irissi monarch of this iland, we have a lift of seventeen in succession, of whom few transactions worth our notice are record ed. Melaghlin, prince oi iv.e_.th, who formed a league"], [393, "369 BRITISH ILANDS. Chap XVI league against the Norwegian Torgis, was on the death of that invader elected sovereign ; and after some successful efforts to prevent the subjugation of his country, died by natural decease, a lot unfre quent with Irissi princes. In the reign of Flan Sionna flourissied Cormac Mac Cuillenan, at once archbi ssiop of Cashel and king of Munster, the reputed author of a famous historical composition called the Psalter of Cashel. This ecclesiastical ruler, who com menced his reign in the first year of the tenth cen tury, extravagantly praised, with little appearance of truth, by monkish writers, is reported to have lost his life in a battle against the people of Leinster and the Danes of Dublin, in an attempt to levy the Baro mean tax. In the beginning of the eleventh cen tury, Brien, king of Munster, surnamed Boiroimhe or Boro, acquired a reputation so high, and an in fluence so powerful, as to be enabled to render him self monarch of Ireland in the place of Mebghlin the second, whom he dethroned. This warlike prince, excessively praised for legislative as well as military talents, fell in a battle against the Danes and Irissi of Leinster, at Clontarf near Dublin, on the twenty-third of April, in the year 1014, the most famous battle in Irissi history before the Englissi invasion, in which the victory is commonly supposed to have been gained by the army of Brien, but seems, on examination, to have terminated in favour of his enemies, or to have been at least indecisive. The accounts of it transmitted to u? are vague, contra dictory, and in some circumstances totally impro bable. Vol. I. B b Melaghiin,"], [394, "370 HISTORY OF THE Chap. XVI Scholars Melaghlin, who, by Brien Boro's usurpation, had been reduced to his principality of Meath, resumed his place, as monarch of Ireland, on the death of that warrior ; but, after Melaghlin's decease, the fa mily of Brien acquired the ascendancy to the exclu sion of the Hy Nial race from the sovereign throne. In the reign of Moriertach, or Mortough O'Brien, a prince of this family, Ireland is said to have been in no small danger of being conquered by the Nor wegians. Magnus, king of Norway, having seized the He of Man and the Orkneys, is with probabi lity reported to have resolved on the conquest of this country, and to have arrived with a formidable army in the year 1104; but to have been circumvented and slain by the Irissi of Ulster, as he was rassily ad vancing before the main body of his forces with a small paity. After this we hear no more of attempts on this iland by the Scandinavians, whose maraud ing bands had been so terrible formerly to the Irissi under various names, as those of Duff-Galls and Fin- Galls, black and white foreigners, epithets bestowed for qualities real or imaginary, of which we can only make uncertain conjectures.

Columba, or Columb-Cill, who, founding a monas tery at Derry, and becoming the apostle of the North-Britons, establissied in ihe He of Hy, one of the Hebudes, a celebrated abbey, whence was disse minated for two centuries whatever was known of Christianity and letters in the northern parts of Bri tain. In the fame century we find Saint Canice, the patron faint of Kilkenny, who wrote the life of Co lumba, with hymns in his praise. In the seventh century, besides a number of other c.iumba sainted men, as Aidan, Cummian, Colman, Kilian, Jonas, and Adamnanus, flourissied Columbanus, a monk of Bangor in the county of Down, famous for piety and learning, who, beside some pleasing poems, wrote various works in prose in defense of the old observation of Easter, and on other subjects, and founded in the French province of Burgundy the monasteries of Luxeuil and Fontaine, after that of Bangor in Britain, which is also said to have been founded by him.

This truly great man was, however, canonized, five hundred years after, by pope Gregory the ninth. Thus are, in all ages, men of superior knowledge, benevolence, and candour, en- vied by the ungenerous, traduced by sycophants, perse- cuted by men contemptible in understanding, but formi- dable in power, and, after their deaths, revered, and followed in opinion, by the judicious and well-informed. The fame century gave birth to Sedulius Scotigena, sometimes distinguissied by the epithet of Secundus, whose writings, worthy of a more enlightened age, were unfavourable to the high superiority claimed by the pope, and quite inimical to the worssiip of images. o In the ninth century, when so many seminaries of this iland were desolated by Danish depredation, the honour of Irissi literature was maintained in foreign countries by her native students, particularly by Al binus, Clement, and Johannes Scotus Erigena.

That these men of literature, whose names are la tinized, as the accounts concerning them were ori ginally written in the Latin tongue, have left us no works on the history of their own nation, is a mat ter of great regret, since, from this neglect, our annals and records of those times are meagre and obscure to a lamentable degree. They are besides mostly written in an older style of the Irissi tongue than is generally at this day understood. The most ancient piece now extant of Irissi history bears the date of the tenth century, styled the Psalter of Cashel* as being written in verse, ascribed to the pen of Cormac Mac Cuillenan, archbishop of Cassiel and king of Munster. Next in reputation is the book of Howth, containing a ssiort chronicle of transac- tions from the year 432. The annals of Tigernagh, an ecclesiastic of Clonmacnoise, end properly at his death in 1088, but are continued under his name by other hands. The annals of Innisfallen, composed by the monks of a monastery in an iland of that name in the lake of Killarney, contain a history of affairs from 250 to 1320, translated into Englissi by a gentleman named Theophilus O'Flanagan. A condensed compilation of detached and confused chronicles is the annals of the Four Masters, writ- ten, toward the end of the seventeenth century, by four monks of Donegal, who seem not to have been acquainted with the annals of Innisfallen.

Little seems discoverable beyond what is contained in the history of Geoffry Keating, which was compiled, about the year 1626, from fables confessedly not be lieved by himself, and which is said to have been un fairly translated from the original Irissi into Englissi. Of the ecclesiastical history of Ireland we are bet ter informed. Its church long supported an inde pendence from papal jurisdiction, together with a celebrity for the culture of letters. Whether its founders had come from the neighbouring iland of Great Britain, or immediately from the remote re gions of Greece and the East, it resembled the early Greek church in rites and discipline, and remained long uncontaminated by the innovations of Rome. It maintained not, however, a uniformity of wor ssiip. Almost every diocese had a particular liturgy ; and even the several congregations were frequently sound to differ in rites, modes, and offices of public devotion. Nor, though it retained much of the early purity of the christian doctrines, was it free from superstition. For instance, the belief of a lo cal purgatory was authorized, and a cave in an iland of lough Dyerg, in the county of Donegal, in a most wild and dreary situation, chosen for the scene. The contrivance is attributed to Patrick, abbot of Armagh, who lived in the latter part of the ninth century ; and from him the appellation of Patrick's Purgatory, given to the place, is supposed to have been derived. The"], [399, "BRITISH ILANDS. 375 Char, XVI The first attempt of the Roman pontiff to subju gate the church of Ireland was in the year 1127, when Gillebert, bissiop of Limerick, an Ostinan, who had written a book in favour of the Roman ritual, received the commission of legate from his Holiness ; but seems not to have exercised any juris diction among his compatriots in virtue of that au thority. Afterwards Malachy, archbissiop of Ar magh, who died in 1148, laboured in the legatine character, with little success, for the subjection of his country to the spiritual dominion of Rome. In the year 1152, in a council of the Irissi clergy, summoned by cardinal Paparon, legate a latere of pope Eugenius the third, and convened at Kells, the supremacy of the Roman pontiff was, for the first time, solemnly recognized in Ireland. Not withstanding this recognition, the rituals of the various congregations remained without uniformity till the Englissi invasion. The claim of spiritual dominion, advanced by the high priest of Rome, more easily gained ground in Ireland by the Danissi colonists of Dublin and other cities, who, at different times, had been converted to Christianity according to the rites of the Englissi church, the fame then with those of the Roman, and who had endeavoured, even by sword and fire, to convert the Irissi christians to the Romissi com munion ; yet in all the plenitude of papal domina tion, a faint remnant of the old Irissi church long survived in the degraded remains of the Culdees, an order of monks eminently distinguissied by learning and christian piety, founded in Ireland by Saint Co- lumba,"], [400, "HISTORY OF THE 376 Chap XVI lumba, in the sixth century, and propagated into the northern parts of Britain, but having its chief esta blishment in Hy. The intolerance of Roman bi gotry expelled them from their monasteries in Bri tain ; but in Ireland seduction was employed instead .of force ; and they continued, but in a corrupted and debased condition, to retain their name, and some lands, even so late as the year 1625. The bigoted furv of the christian Danes had been ex- o * cited by the Romish clergy of England, who, from hatred to the Irissi for their difference in religious rites, had instigated Egfrid, king of Northumber land, in 684, to send an army into Ireland, by which the most rueful havoc was committed. That episcopacy was coeval with Christianity in this iland is highly probable ; but, until the arrival of the Englissi, the number of the sees, the succes sion of the bisliops, and ecclesiastical affairs in ge neral, are involved in great obscurity. According to the mode of the Greek church, the episcopates or bilhnpricks were so small in extent, and so great in number, as probably to amount to about three hun dred : but when the Roman pontiff, by means of the Danissi invaders, gained influence in this iland, and at length, by the Englissi establissiment, the ac tual supremacy of its church, a plan was gradually executed for the diminution of the number, and the augmentation ot the extent of the sees, because the fewness and encreased revenues of the prelates ren dered the clergy more respectable, and the church more manageable by the pope and his legates. This project was of difficult execution, and proceeded very"], [401, "BRITISH ILANDS. 377 very slowly; because the chiefs of septs, whose fa- Chap. milies had enjoyed the patronage of sees, frequently ' , resisted the papal authority in the abolition of this privilege by the suppression of an episcopate. Most probably in Ireland, as elsewhere, the bi ssiops were at first elected by their congregations, and afterwards, in the progress of clerical power, by exclusive corporations of the clergy, or the chap ters of cathedrals. But when, from the wealth or power annexed to them, episcopates became an ob ject of ambition, the toparchs would suffer none ex cept men of their own families to come into election; so that episcopates were held by a kind of hereditary succession, similar to that of the toparchies them selves ; that is, they were inheritances appropriated to certain families, not by lineal right, but by an apparent election, in which the electors had no free dom of choice. When the papal influence gained admiffion, and was, by the arms of the Englissi, established in this country, this abuse was by degrees, not without many obstacles, ultimately removed. Parissies in this iland appear to have had their commencement with that of the dissolution of the smaller episcopates, in the year 1 152, when in a ge neral council at Kells, under cardinal Paparon, a re gulation was made, among other canons, \" that on the death of a chorespiscopus, or village bissiop, or of bissiops who possessed small sees in Ireland, archipref byters, or rural deans, ssiould be appointed by the diocesans to succeed them, who ssiould superintend the clergy and laity in their respective districts, and that each of their sees ssiould be converted into a rural"], [402, "\u25a0\u00bb 373 Chap-. XVI HISTORY OF THE rural deanery.\" Since we find that in the thirteenth century this regulation remained unexecuted, at least to any considerable degree, the parochial division was doubtless not finally settled before a late period. To discover from what source arose the revenues of the Irissi clergy, in the early ages of the church, is not an easy matter. We have grounds to believe that, even so late as the twelfth century, no tythes were paid in Ireland ; the clergy subsisting on obla tions, which, relatively to the national poverty in those days, were very large. \" Included in obla tions,\" faysLedwich, \" were first fruits, which were paid in the early ages of Christianity. As to altarage, mortuary, and obventions, they seem to have been at length introduced into the Irissi, as well as into other churches. The whole ecclesiastical revenue, to a late period, was divided into four parts. One went to the bissiop, another to the clergy, a third to the poor, and the fourth supported the fabric of the church and other uses.\" By a course of events of difficult investigation tythes were acquired by the clergy for their maintenance, beside tracts of land appropriated to the support of religious establissi ments, under the titles of termon, corbe, herenagh, and other terms, the explanation of which 1 leave to writers whose object is more particularly the his tory of the church.

XVII '1333, tering the principality of Breffny, which consisted , of the modern county of Leitrim with some other districts, expelled its prince named Tiernan O'Ruarc. Dermod on this occasion, whether from previous attachment, or propensity to indulge unlawful pas- sion, seized the person of Dervorgha!, the wife of Tiernan, and carried her into Leinster. The Breff- znan, instead of desponding, exerted his persuasive talents with success in prevailing on O'Connor not only to reinstate him in his principality, but also to march with a formidable force into the territories of Dermod, and to force him to the restitution of Der vorghal, who is said to have lived afterwards, if not in re-union with her hussiand, at least in a condition of rank and opulence. By services of such importance O'Ruarc remained attached to the king of Connaught, by whose assist- ance he was enabled to give disturbance frequently to Dermod ; till by the death of O'Connor in the year 1156, O'Loghlyn became chief monarch of Ireland. Dermod, long the ally of the Ultonian or Ulster prince, might have found means, by the sovereign power of his patron, to complete the ruin of O'Ruarc, if his patron had not, by a formida- ble confederacy, excited against him by a horrible crime, been disabled from lending him effectual aid. O'Loghlyn, too highly elated by his new dignity, and filled with resentment against the prince of Down or Uladh, named Dunleve, who affected indepen- dence, seized his person in breach of a solemn trea ty, and with execrable inhumanity deprived him of his eyes. This act, though of a kind too frequent in"], [405, "BRITISH ILANDS. 3S_ in the annals of the Irissi to be new to the chieftains Chap. then existing, excited in each a fear of his own , ', safety. Leaguing for mutual assistance, the neigh bouring princes flew to arms ; and the contest was, after some less important actions, decided by the death of O'Loghlyn, who fell in the battle of Lut- terluin in 1 167. By the fall of the Ultonian prince the house of Roderic O'Connor was reinstated in the sovereignty, in the person of Roderic, son of Turlogh, already men tioned. Seizing the opportunity of the vacant throne, Roderic marched immediately to Dublin, where, savoured by the Ostman inhabitants, he was, with proper solemnity, inaugurated as paramount mo narch ; and, thence marching northward, received the submissions of the chiefs in that quarter. Re turning to the south, accompanied by O'Ruarc, and obliging the toparchs of Leinster to acknowledge his authority, he caused Dermod to be deposed, and an other of the same family to be chosen in his place. To complete the establissiment of his title he ad vanced into Munster ; and having modelled the go vernment of that province to what he conceived to be his interest, he convened an assembly of the princes of Ireland in Meath, where he displayed such a superiority, and commanded such respect, as promised in appearance a reign of comparative pros perity. Dermod, the partisan of the fallen O'Loghlyn, Fiigfet us consequently regarded as the enemy of Roderic, had fled in despair on the approach of that monarch, letting sire to Ferns, the place of his residence, to prevent"], [406, "HISTORY OF THE 382 Chap XVII prevent the advantage of its spoliation to his foes. Rejected by the chiefs of Leinster, and destitute of resource at home, he resolved, as Irissi princes had at several times done before, to seek assistance be yond sea. As the proximity of England, and the fame of its monarch, drew naturally his attention to that quarter, he set fail for the Severn's mouth, and arrived at Bristol with sixty attendants. The expulsion of this kinglet, ascribed by Giraldus Cam brensis to the abreption of Dervorghal, seems to have had little or no connexion with that affair ; since in those ages crimes of this kind were too com mon to excite a just abhorrence ; since the fact had been committed at least fourteen years before this event ; and since his alliance with the enemies of the O'Connor family, would, aided by the hatred of the Leinstrian toparchs, have been sufficient in itself to produce this catastrophe. Dermod, en dowed with superior stature and strength of body, and with a boisterous valour, was highly esteemed by the common people, whom he favoured, and by the clergy, to wholn he was munificent, but odious to his tributary chieftains for his pride and oppres sive government, who all instantly forsook him on the reverse of his fortune. As the introducer of successful adventurers from South-Britain into his country, he has excited the hatred of Irissi writers, who have described him as a man of a most detestable character. With considerable abatement for mani fest exaggeration, he may have risen somewhat above the ordinary standard of his turbulent compatriots in ferocity of spirit and violence of behaviour. Henry"], [407, "BRITISH ILANDS. 382 Henry had, from the first years of his reign, en- Chap. tertained thoughts of the conquest of Ireland, which, XVIL from its distracted state, lay open to the attempts of u- \u2022 _ _.\u2022 l. -r \u2022 _. j _. Viewsof any ambitious potentate ; and which, it it had been Henry oa completely subjected to any one Scandinavian mo narch, might, in the hands of a bold sea-faring people, have become a nursery of naval power dan gerous to the prosperity of England. From attempts for its subjugation the predecessors of Henry had been incapacitated by domestic weakness, or divert ed by more interesting objects. That this great prince had found leisure, with a fair pretext, for a complete conquest, might have been happy both for Britain and Ireland, since they might thus have been early united into one potent and civilized monarchy. Neither monarchs, nor the rulers of common wealths, are ever at a loss for pretences, when op portunities are given, to gratify their ambition ; but the sanction of the pope, who, in those times of mental darkness, arrogated, as the head of the chris tian church, the disposal of kingdoms, was deemed necessary for such an enterprise as the invasion of Ireland. By John of Salisoury, therefore, his chap lain, was application made by Henry to pope Adrian the third, who, beside being an Englissiman amicable to the king, was glad of an opportunity of aug menting the papal power, and of reducing com pletely the Irissi under the Roman church. A bull was immediately given, together with a ring, the token of his investiture, as rightful sovereign of the Irish, authorizing Henry to render himself master of Ireland, to eradicate irreligion and immorality from among"], [408, "SSI- Chap.

This bull, which was issued in 1 1 56, lay some years dormant. By the various and complicated businesses in which he was involved by his possessions in France and contest with Becket, the monarch's attention was engaged so deeply, that Ireland seems to have been forgotten, till, by the consequences resulting from the flight of Dermod, his interference was demanded, and the opportunity of invasion rendered easy. Received, as an unfortunate prince, with com passion and kind hospitality at Bristol, where he learned that Henry was then far distant in the south of France, Dermod repaired quickly to his court, and throwing himself at his feet, implored his assist ance, promising to hold Leinster in vassalage under the Englissi monarch and his heirs. Henry, how glad soever of the occurrence, was unable at that time, engaged in wars and negociations, to avail himself of so fair an opportunity : but, resolving to draw what advantage he could from the occurrence, he accepted the proffered fealty of the suppliant prince, and, treating him with great courtesy, dis missed him with splendid gifts, magnificent promises, and a letter of credence addressed to all his subjects, in which he declared, that he had received the king of Leinster into his grace and protection, and that whosoever ssiould assist in the reinstatement of the exiled prince might be assured of his free licence and royal favour. This letter, which Dermod pub lissied in Bristol, on his return from the continent, procured"], [409, "BRITISH ILANDS. 385 Chap XVII procured him no assistance, probably from the unfa vourable opinion there entertained respecting the state of Ireland, till, after a month's interval, he was induced, by the situation of affairs in South- Wales, to make more successful applications to some chiefs in that country. Among the persons in those parts, who, from cir- cumstances, might be supposed the most willing to engage in adventures, was Richard, earl of Chep- stow, then termed Strigul, furnamed Strongbow, son of Gilbert, earl of Pembroke, of the illustrious house of Clare, a valorous youth, of dissipated for- tune, and destitute of royal favour. To this young nobleman Dermod made earnest application ; and, on the cold reception of his first overtures, he pro- posed to give him his daughter Eva in marriage, and with her the inheritance of the kingdom of Leinster. This proposal was according to the Irissi laws a nul- lity, since no hereditary nor female succession had place in Ireland ; but he might reasonably suppose that the establiftment of the claim would much more depend on the success of the enterprise than on the customs of his country. When earl Strongbow, so titled from his feats of archery, acceded to the pro posals of the Irissi prince, on condition of Henry's particular licence for the undertaking, Dermod found other adventurers, less powerful indeed, but more prompt for the hazardous design. Nesta, a Welch princess, mother of the famous Robert, earl of Glocester, the heroic partizan of the empress Matilda, had after the termination of her amours with king Henry the first, married an Vol. I.

On the arrival of Dermod to solicit succours, the bishop of Saint-David's, the brother of Fitzstephen and Fitzgerald, prevailed on Griffith co consent that these two chiefs ssiould be allowed to indulge their wiih of embarking in the Irish expedition, as they would thereby be extricated from a war in Wales, in which they might be en gaged on opposite sides. Dermod, having received solemn promises from these two leaders of their sailing to his assistance in the ensuing spring, landed privately on the Irissi coast in the winter of i 169, and passed unobserved to a monastery which he had founded at Ferns, where he remained some time in concealment, awaiting the arrival of his transmarine allies. Very early in the spring he sent Maurice Regan, his secretary, to has ten their preparations, and to solicit further aid. With a body of Irissi adherents, and a few auxiliars from South-Wales, among whom was the son of a petty prince in that country, he seized a part of his former dominions, a tract called Hy Kensclagh, ex- tending"], [411, "BRITISH ILANDS. 387 Chap XVII, tending to Wexford along the river Slaney. Thi ther marched hastily king Roderic accompanied by O'Ruarc. Unable to cope with a force, which he had not expected to march against him before the arrival of more powerful aid, Dermod had recourse to the expedient usual in such cases. He retired with his followers into the fastnesses of woods, hop ing to baffle by the nature of his post the great supe riority of the enemy's number. In the attempts of Roderic's troops to force the post of Dermod, several ssiir missies had place, in the first of which the assailants lost a considerable num ber. In another fell the tainist of O'Ruarc and the chieftain of Wales. Frustrated in his hopes of a speedy decision in his favour, and impatient to march elsewhere for the suppression of revolts and local feuds, particularly in Meath and in North-Munster, called Thomond, in both which province, the princes reigning under his protection had been murdered, Roderic willingly listened to proposals of a treaty, which Dermod made only with temporizing views. He offered to pay a hundred ounces of gold to O'Ruarc ; to make a formal renunciation of his claim to the kingdom of Leinster, on being per mitted to retain ten cantreds, or small territories, under vassalages to the chief monarch ; and to give seven hostages for the security of his obedience. Roderic accepted these conditions, and, hastening elsewhere for objects which he thought more mo mentous, left the deposed prince to expect in silence his transmarine allies.

Wexford, with three small vessels, which carried three hundred archers, and ninety men in -armour, of whom thirty were knights. This little army was reinforced on the following day by the landing of Maurice de Prendergast with two hundred archers and ten knights. On the news of their arrival, num bers, who had abandoned the party of Dermod, re turned to his standard, and he made haste to join his allies, sending forward five hundred men under his natural son Donald, a youth of distinguissied va lour. Their first enterprise was the attack of Wex ford, situated twelve miles from the place of debar cation.

The Irissi had sel- dom other defensive armour than the glibb for a helmet, and iron gauntlets on the hands for a shield. For offensive arms each man carried common Iv a pike, two javelins, a sword, and a long knife called fikene. From the Danes they had acquired the Scy- thian"], [413, "339 Chap, XVII Of the Nor- mans.

By a single stroke of one of these, given by a Dane, in a battle at Dublin in the foU lowing year, the thigh of an Englissi knight was, together with its casing of steel armour, completely cut through. Their bows and arrows were too ssiort for effective use in battle ; but with prodigious force they threw stones, the javelin whirled by a string, and even the ponderous hatchet. The Irissi Ostmen, whose main dependance was on the axe and pike, appear to have been furnissied for war in a manner, at this time, little different from the aboriginals. The Scandinavian tribes, who, under the name of Normans, had fixed their abode in France, had been united, from their first settlement, under one potent monarchy ; and, in their wars with the great princes of the continent, had been accustomed to the evolutions of large bodies of troops acting in combined and persevering efforts. They had also adopted with some alterations, the arms which the Gothic nations, the fubverters of the Roman em pire, had learned from the Romans. Their forces consisted of men at arms and archers. The former were horsemen so cased in armour, that a knight completely caparisoned was by ordinary weapons al most invulnerable. A suit of armour was composed of several pieces of polissied steel, adapted to the several parts of the body, and so nicely jointed as to sit easy on the warrior, and to allow him a freedom of motion and exertion of strength. He carried on his left arm an oval shield : his horse was also barbed or"], [414, "HISTORY OF THE 390 Chap, or fortified with armour ; and his weapons of offense C-^-l-j were a iong lance, a dagger, and a long, double- edged, and pointed sword. The archers, fenced with quilted jackets, or coats of mail, and helmets, and armed with pikes or with battleaxes for occa sional close combat, carried the formidable bow, which, like that of the ancient Parthians, sent ar rows with such force, as often to pierce the strongest armour. The Norman mode of warfare had been learned by the conquered Englissi, who, by their ex traordinary attention to the bow, became the most celebrated archers in all Europe. c^vvtr\" l^e aPProach \u00b0f Dermod and Fitzstephen to- ford. ward their town, the garrison of Wexford, near two u'0- thousand in number, marched with intrepidity to meet their enemies in the field ; but, struck with the unexpected sight of ssiining armour, and troops ad vancing to the charge with unbroken ranks in steady silence and composure, they retired within their walls, burning the suburbs and adjacent hamlets to deprive the assailants of ssielter.

Dermod immediately, according to his original stipulation, invested Fitzstephen, con jointly with Fitzgerald, although the latter had not yet arrived, with the lordssiip of Wexford and its territory ; and on Hervy of Mountmorres, a nephew of Strongbow, he conferred two districts on the coast between the towns of Wexford and Waterford. Hence probably the Bargy and Forth baronies re ceived an accession of colonists from South-Britain. Dermod marched next against Donald Macgilla Invasion- of \u00b0 \u00b0 Ollory. Phadruig, called by the Englissi Fitzpatrick, prince 1170 of Ossory, situate about the modern county of Kil- kenny, who had not only revolted against him, but even, in a fit of matrimonial jealousy, had seized one of his sons, and torn out his eyes in so cruel a manner, that the death of the hapless youth was the immediate consequence. This act is a proof that the wickedness of Dermod was equalled at least bv some of his compatriots. In this expedition a war- fare widelv different from the storming of Wexford J o was experienced by Fitzstephen's band. Five thou- sand Offorians, strongly barricaded amid woods and morasses, repelled the reiterated assaults of the Britons, who had no other resource than stratagem and evolu- tion.

XVII Advance of Roderic. 1 i ,0 Their discomfiture was completed by the Irissi troops of Dermod, who, as if they intended to join either of the two parties which ssiould prove victorious, re mained idle spectators during the combat, but on its decision, pursued the Ossorians, and brought three hundred of their heads to the king of Leinster. This prince, when he had recognized the head of an in veterate enemy, is said to have mangled the visage with hi* teeth in a paroxysm of rage ! a ssiocking sample of manners in his time and country ! Having ravaged Ossory and some other territories of hostile chiefs, Dermod was further reinforced by the landing at Wexford of Maurice Fitzgerald, with a hundred archers and forty horsemen, of whom ten were knights. A still greater aid would have now been seasonable, as Roderic had at length found leisure from a multiplicity of business to assemble a great force at the hill of Tarah in Meath for the de struction of the Leinstrian prince. Of what mate rials the Irissi armies were composed appeared on this, as on other occasions. Dreading the defection of the northern chiefs, who secretly favoured the supremacy ot the Hy Nial family, Roderic, when he had advanced so far as Dublin, dismissed these leaders and their troops, under pretence that the ser- T.ice was too unimportant to require the inconveni ence of their longer detention. The vast superio rity, however, of his remaining forces struck Der mod with despair, abandoned by vassals who had lately sworn allegiance to his government, and ap prehending the desertion of all the rest. Fitzstephen's"], [417, "BRITISH ILANDS. 393 Chap, XVII Fitzstephen's magnanimity roused the prince from a despondence which would have proved fatal. En- S trenched near Ferns, amid morasses, precipices, and woods, the Englissi, with their associates, waited the onset of the enemy with so resolute a countenance as to cool the ardour of Roderic. Dreading their prowess, and the ruinous effects of a defeat, he had recourse to negociation. An answer of defiance he received from Fitzstephen, to whom he made the first overtures, offering, on condition of his aban donment of Dermod, not only a fase retreat for him self and all his forces, but also the defrayment of their expences in their voyage back to Wales. From Dermod, whom he then attempted to detach from his Englissi alliance, the support and hope of all his fortunes, he obtained a not more favourable reply. By the mediation of the clergy, when the armies were prepared for decision by the sword, a treaty was concluded, by which Dermod was acknowledg ed king of Leinster, under the supremacy of Ro deric, to whom his favourite son was delivered as a hostage, and to whose daughter this son was to be joined in matrimony, for the cementing of an alli ance between the two families, as soon as the com plete submission of Leinster to Dermod, and of Ire land to O'Connor, ssiould render the conjuncture fa vourable. By a secret article the prince of Leinster was bound to bring no more adventurers from Bri tain, and to send home those who had already come, when once his power ssiould be folly establissied over his province. Authorized"], [418, "HISTORY OF THE 394 Chap. xvii Reduction or Dublin. 1 170 Landing of Raymond. 1171 Authorized by treaty to reduce all parts of Lein- ster, Dermod hastened to execute vengeance on the citizens of Dublin, who had treacherously murdered his father, and had in signification of contemptuous insult, interred with his body the carcase of a dog. This even at that time the most considerable town ot Ireland, founded by Scandinavians, perhaps in the earliest ages of the christian era, we find noted by Ptolemy under the name of Eblana, probably Deb- lana in the original uncorrupted manuscript. Seated at first on swampy ground, at the southern side of the river Lilly, it was called by the Irissi Baileacliath and Aihcliath,' or the town on hurdles ; by the Danes and other Gothic people Dystin, Fjubhlin or Duvlin, which seems to signify black water. At the arrival of the Englissi in Ireland it was inhabited by Ost- men, whence a part of the modern city retained until cur times the name of Oxmantown, corrupted from Ostmantown. Under a chieftain who sometimes acknowledged, and sometimes disclaimed, a sort of allegiance to the prince of Leinster, Dublin formed a distinct state, and possessed a territory consisting principally of what is called Fingall, whose inhabi tants are distinguished by a peculiar dialect of Gothic origin, most probably Danish. On the arrival of Dermod, the citizens, with Hesculph Mac-Torcal, their chief, made overtures of submission, which, through the intercession of Fitzgerald, were ac cepted. Dermod, now aspiring to wrest the sovereign dig nity from Roderic, assisted O'Brien of Thomond to become independent of that monarch, and wrote pressingly"], [419, "BRITISH ILANDS. 395 Chap.

As the letter of Henry had only authorized his sub jects to assist in the restoration of the Leiustrian prince, a restoration now effected, Strongbow was unwilling to embark in a new enterprise, the de thronement of O'Connor, without a new and parti ticular licence from his sovereign. Repairing to France to solicit this favour, he received evasive an swers. Affecting to understand one of these as a consent, he proceeded in his preparations, and sent before him Raymond le Gross, a nephew of Fitz stephen, with ten knights and seventy archers, as the vanguard of his army. This band of adven turers, landing in the May of 1 171, at a place called Dondonolf by the old historians, near the city of Waterford, raised a rampart of earth, and drew a trench around it, as a temporary defense. Waterford, situate on the southern bank of the great navigable river Suir, was inhabited by Oil men, under the joint government of two magistrates. Alarmed at a hostile debarcation, contrary to a treaty so lately concluded, the citizens and neigh bouring peasants, forming a tumultuary force of about three thousand, rushed with disorderly preci pitation to overwhelm the invaders. Despising such a mob, the Englissi advanced from their fort to meet them on equal ground, but were obliged to retreat, and were so furiously pursued that some of the assailants entered with them within the rampart. These were instantly slaughtered by the garrison, who by a sud den sally put the confused multitude to a total rout. Many were killed, and seventy of the principal citi- zens"], [420, "395 HISTORY OF THE TriAP. zensf were captured.

While the treaty was yet unconcluded,'the time of parley expired. Some of the English gave the assault without orders, and gained possession with little resistance amid the surprise of the garrison who had expected no hostility. Hesculf, the governor, with many"], [421, "BRITISH ILANDS. 397 many of the inhabitants, escaped the general car- Chap. nage by sailing to the Hebudes. When, after this ' exploit, Meath and some other territories were in vaded by the victorious troops, O'Connor is said to have put to death his hostage, the son of Dermod. Alarmed by the progress of the English, to whom Council of *T a I _. r i ' j i Armagh. no enectual opposition was made among clans more 117J hostile one to another than to any invaders, almost all the principal clergy of Ireland assembled at Ar magh to deliberate for the public safety. After a solemn consideration they agreed, that the evil had arisen from the sins of the people, and that provi dence had brought on them the chastisement of the Englissi arms because many persons of Englissi race had been purchased for slaves by the Irissi from pi rates and merchants. Though the Englissi of earlier times had practiced this abominable commerce to a great degree, probably the number of slaves from that nation, since the trade had declined, was at this time small in Ireland ; yet the immediate libera tion, and remission to their country, of all these, which were decreed by this council, were considered as the most effectual means of averting the divine anger, and of procuring the expulsion of the Englissi adventurers. How narrow soever, from the mental darkness of the age, we may conceive the views of the clergy on this occasion to have been, the mea sure was humane and far from impolitic. It tended to the immediate annihilation of this vile traffic among the Irissi, and to excite their spirits to more vigorous exertion, restored, as they might hope, to the divine favour.

S',.o;e of D 1 HISTORY OF THE might have imagined an interposition of providence on their side, since fortune seemed now to change against the Englissi, and to threaten their destruction by a series of adversities. While Dermod, twice defeated in Breffney, which he had invaded rassily with too small a detachment, made with difficulty his escape, orders were sent from France by Henry prohibiting the exportation of any supplies from England for Strongbow, and commanding all his subjects in Ireland to return home before the ensuing feast of Easter, under the penalty of high treason. This act of jealous power, which deprived the earl of all succour from abroad, and even of the assistance of some of his former adhe rents, was quickly succeeded by the sickness and death of Dermod, which caused the defection of all his Irissi allies, except a few, among whom was a chief named Donald Kevanagh. In this forlorn state of his affairs, Dublin, which, on his depar ture for Yfaterford, he had left under the command of Milo de Cogan, was suddenly assailed by a body of Ostmen, whom Hescuiph had led from the Scottissi ilands. Unopposed in their landing, and furiously assaulting the eastern quarter, these troops had almost forced their way into the town, when they were routed by a skilful attack on their rear. This victory was tarnissied by the death of Hescuiph, exe cuted while a prisoner after the battle, and denounc ing with his last breath a more formidable attack in preparation against the Englissi. By the extraordinary exertions of Lawrence OTool, urchbissiop of Dublin, such a confederacy was"], [423, "BRITISH ILANDS. 399 Chap XVII \u2014 v \u2014 I was formed, that Roderic was enabled to invest the city of Dublin with an army stated in exaggerated accounts at thirty thousand, while its harbour was blockaded by a fleet of thirty Danissi vessels from the He of Man and the Hebudes. Beleaguered for two months, and oppressed by famine and disease, the garrison of Dublin saw their affairs approaching speedily to a crisis, when intelligence was brought by the faithful Kevanagh, that Fitzstephen was be sieged in the fortress of Carrick near Wexford, and must, unless relieved before the end of three days, fall into the hands of a cruel foe. According to the determination of a council of war, proposals were made that Strongbow ssiould hold the princi pality of Leinster in vassalage to Roderic, as sove reign of Ireland, on condition of peace. Informed that no other terms would be admitted than the total evacuation of the kingdom by the Englissi, the chiefs resolved to make a desperate sally on the following day. Six hundred men only could be spared for this enterprise, in which the van was led by Raymond, the second line by Milo, and the main body by Strongbow and Fitzgerald. The attack was pointed against the post of Koderic, where so little appre hension was entertained, that the monarch was bath ing, and was obliged to mingle half naked with his flying troops, who were diiven from their ground, at the first onset, with tenible slaughter. The other leaders of the Irissi army, actuated by no sense of a common interest, attachment to their sovereign, or friendship for each other, fled instantly with their followers,"], [424, "+00 Chap, XVII Siege of Carrick. 1171 V HISTORY OF THE followers, as soon as they perceived the rout of the Connaught forces, leaving behind them provisions enough to support the garrison during a whole year. While a dread of ignominy superior to that of death, aided by apprehensions of Irissi perfidy, led the garrison of Dublin to safety and triumph, the defenders of Carrick were by a different line of con- duct brought to destruction. This little fortress, founded by Fitzstephen on a rock, where are still seen the ruins of such a fabric, two miles above Wexford, on the eastern brink of the river Slaney, fenced naturally on all sides .by precipices and a deep stream, was furnissied only with a slender garrison : yet the assailants were in every attempt repulsed with slaughter, and at length had recourse to the most execrable means of success which imagination can conceive. They assured the commander in a parley, that Roderic, having put to the sword the whole garrison of Dublin, was in full march to make the seme execution at Carrick ; but that if Fitzstephen, whose virtues they respected, would confide in the protection of the Wexfordians, they would ship him- self and all his adherents for Wales before the venge- ful prince could arrive with his army. When the truth of those assertions was attested by two right reverend bissiops in their pontifical robes, laying their hands, while they pronounced the oah, on the cross, the host, and the adored relics of faints, Fitzstephen accepted the terms proposed, and was instantly thrown into chains, while his. followers were most inhumanly tortured and maimed, so that the"], [425, "BRITISH ILANDS. 401 Chap, XVII the greater part expired under their sufferings. The instances of perfidy in the annals of Ireland, of which this appears the most forcible, are disgraceful in the extreme to the national character in former ages, and ought to instigate the Irissi of the present age to the most inviolable regard for honour and humanity. Strongbow, in his march for the relief of Carrick, which, though too late, he immediately commenced on the rout of Roderic's forces, fell into the extre mity of danger, in an ambuscade, in a territory named Hidrone, in the modern county of Carlow. Having forced the defile, with the death of O'Ryan, the leader of the hostile band, he had the mortifica tion to hear, en his approach toward Wexford, of Fitzstephen's captivity, and of such a situation of affairs as rendered his relief at present impossible. The Wexfordians had fired their town, and had re tired with their surviving prisoners to an ilet in the harbour named Holy Hand, whence, by a message, they informed Strongbow that, if any hostility ssiould be attempted against fhem in this place of retreat, they would instantly put all their captives to death. Dreading the execution of this menace, the earl halted, and marched to Waterford. He some time after, in consequence of a message, hasted to Eng land to appease the king's anger. CHAP. Vol. I.

It is, however, only a fragment, contain ing the transactions of about three years and a half, and ending abruptly. From these, from Irissi annals, and"], [427, "BRITISH ILANDS. 403 Chap. XVIII- Irish anti quities, and other originals, Doctor Leland, a fellow of the' university of Dublin, in a history, which he wrote, of Ireland, from the Englissi invasion to the reduc tion of Limerick in 1691, has compiled this part of his work. From the examination of all authentic documents no proof can be deduced in favour of that ancient civilization of the Irissi of which some late writers have made a> boast. Except in the maritime towns founded by the Danes, almost the only structures of stone found in Ireland, previously to this period, were a kind of towers, which in shape were tall hollow pillars of stone and lime, nearly cylindrical, but narrowing upward in some small degree, pierced with some lateral holes to admit the light high above the ground, and surmounted with conical roofs of the fame materials. Of these very simple but dura- ble productions of old Irissi masonry fifty-six, from fifty to a hundred and thirty feet high, and from eight to twelve in diameter in the clear, still surviv- ed the injuries of time in the beginning of the nine- teenth century. The most elegant of all in style of architecture is one in the iland of Devenissi in* logh Ern, which internally is smooth like the barrel of a gun, eighty-four feet high to the apex of its coni- form roof, which occupies fifteen feet of that alti- tude. These round towers were belfries, built apart from the churches as in Italy. Their walls by their form and materials, long survived the structures of clay apd wattles, the churches and monasteries, to which they belonged, as also their own wooden stair cases by which they were ascended on the inside.

HISTORY OF THE The first Irissi church of stone and lime was built at Bangor, in the county of Down, by Malachy, arch bishop of Armagh, who died in 1148 ; and the first Irissi dwelling house of the seme kind of structure wa.- a palace erected at Tuam, by Roderic O'Con nor, the last Irissi monarch of Ireland. Various or naments and utensils, some framed of gold, found buried in bogs and elsewhere, may have been partly imported in remote ages by traders in exchange for peltry, the ancient merchandize of the iland, and partly the acquirements of plunder carried hither by Danissi pirates from richer countries. As monu mental proofs of ancient greatness and civilization in the Irissi they cannot fairly be admitted, since rich ornaments, procured by barter, may be found even in Lapland. Castles, of which I shall speak hereafter, in treating of revolutions in the manners of the Englissi, were introduced into Ireland by the Anglo-Normans. 1 may here observe what perhaps most of my readers already know, that the syllable Fitz, prefixed to the names of Several Anglo-Norman chiefs, is a term of Norman French, corrupted from the Latin word filius, and signifying son. Thus Fitzstephen im ports the son of Stephen ; and Henry the second was called Fitzempress on account of his mother. Among the Welch the particle Ap, derived by the idiomatic pronunciation of that people from the Latin ab, has been applied to a similar use. Among thedrissi Mac and 0 were the patronymic signs, the latter under stood as originally belonging to the principal family of the sept or clan. On"], [429, "BRITISH ILANDS. 405 On the proclamation of the royal orders, inter- Chap. dieting Uipplies to the English engaged in the Irissi J' , expedition, and commanding their return, Raymond LaBjln of had been sent by Strongbow to Henry in France with Henry- supplicatory letters, declaring that the adventurers themselves, and whatever acquisitions they ssiould make, were at the disposal of their sovereign. By the astonissiment and grief of the king at the fatal accident of Becket's death, which precluded for some time all business of secondary concern, Raymond had returned without an answer. The monarch, on his arrival in England, when he had found leisure to undertake in person the conquest of Ireland, utterly disavowed all the proceedings of Strongbow's adhe- rents. The earl waiting upon him at Newnham near Glocester, and surrendering to him all his ma- ritime fortresses, with a territory around Dublin, was, by the intercession of Hervy of Mountmorres, received into the royal favour, and permitted to re- tain in perpetuity all his other Irissi possessions under Henry and his heirs. The king's apprehensions were thus removed, who had feared the establissi ment in Ireland of a state under Strongbow inde- pendent of the Englissi crown. Accompanied by this nobleman, the monarch pro ceeded through South- Wales to Pembroke, seizing the castles of the chieftains in these parts, under pretence of their having offended his Majesty in the abetting of his subjects in the invasion of Ireland. Hav ing performed his devotion in the church of Saint- David, and having implored a blessing on his arms employed in the cause of the holy Roman fee, he set fail"], [430, "405 Chap XVIII HISTORY OF THE fail from Milford haven, and arrived at Waterford, on the feast of Saint Luke, in the October of 1 172, with a fleet of two hundred and forty ships, and an army of above four hundred knights and four thou sand inferior soldiers. The news of his preparations for the invasion of their country seems not to have caused any commo tion among the Irissi, whose chieftains may gene rally have regarded with indifference, perhaps with malignant pleasure, the approaching downfall of their nominal sovereign, unconscious of a common interest, and severally confining their hopes and fears to their local concerns. The men of Wexford, fearing the vengeance due to their atrocious perfidy, had sent emissaries to Henry, while he lay at Pembroke, be seeching him to accept of their allegiance as humble subjects, and complaining of Fitzstephen's aggres sion, whom they had taken, they said, in arms, as a traitor to his sovereign, and reserved for the judg ment of his Majesty. Commending their conduct, and assuring them that this chieftain, and the rest of his offending subjects, ssiould be tried and punissied according to their deserts, this politic monarch made way for a favourable opinion .of his government among the Irissi, while he took the most effectual means to prevent Fitzstephen's murder. On his ar rival now in Waterford, the Wexfordians waited on him, producing their prisoner, whom Henry with stem rebuke ordered again into confinement, to the joy of this rude people, ignorant and unsuspicious of statemen's finesse. No"], [431, "BRITISH ILANDS. 407 No thoughts of opposition to this great monarch Chap. seem to have been entertained by the southern chief- XVUI tains, who on the contrary came emulously forward \u201e . ._ J ' Submiffions to make their submissions, and were forcibly im- of the inst.. pressed by the grandeur, condescension, and muni- ll72 ficence of their new sovereign. Having advanced through Lismore to Cassiel and returned to Water ford, he admitted intercession in favour of Fitzste phen, who, surrendering to his Majesty the town of Wexford with its district, received the investiture of all his other possessions. While in Dublin, to which he next directed his march, he was preparing, with a magnificence of which they could have conceived no idea, to entertain the Irissi lords, at the ensuing feast of Christmas, in a temporary structure of great size, framed of hurdles for the purpose, in the south eastern suburb, he despatched Hugh de Lacy and William Fitzandelm with a body of troops against Roderic, who, strongly posted with his troops of Connaught on the banks of the Shannon, could nei ther be persuaded to submit, nor be attacked by these leaders with hopes of success. As the season of winter prevented such operations Synod of as might be requisite for the reduction of this mo narch, and of O'Nial, the powerful dynast of Ulster, who also declined submission, Henry, according to his original stipulation with the pope, turned his at tention to the church, and summoned a general as sembly of the Irissi clergy at Cassiel, where also attended those lords of Ireland who owned him as their sovereign.

HISTORY OF THE pope, not sanctioned by Gelasius, primate of Ar magh, the authority of the Englissi monarch, as so vereign of Ireland, was formally recognized, and some ordonnances were framed respecting religious astairs, of which only two are worth notice ; one which exempted the persons of the clergy from the jurisdiction of civil courts in criminal cafes, and their lands from all secular taxes : and one which enjoined a perfect conformity of all the churches of Ireland with that of England, consequently with that of Rome. The former, so contrary to the spirit of his policy in England, was procured for the purpose of attaching to his interest the Irissi clergy, whose in fluence might have been of the greatest advantage. The ostensible object of Henry's invasion, the spiritual subjection of Ireland to the see of Rome, was so fully accomplissied, that the great majority of the Irish have ever since, through all revolutions, in variably adhered to the papal jurisdiction, and are perhaps at this day the most attached to it of all people upon earth : but the real object, the civil sub jection of this iland to the Englifli crown, was very far from being obtained. When this monarch had made such regulations as opportunity allowed, he re ceived at Wexford an alarming piece of news, the earlier arrival of which had been prevented by a tempestuous winter, that two cardinals, sent by the pope to inquire into the causes of Becket's murder, were long expecting his. Majesty's arrival in Nor mandy, and summoned him to appear before them under pain of excommunication and an interdict on all his dominions. Henry, fully sensible of the danger,"], [433, "40:1 Chap, XVIII State of Ire land.

That this monarch, obliged thus prematurely to : depart from Ireland, left not behind him in this country one true subject more than he had found in it at his first arrival, is a just observation of Sir John Davis in his Treatise styled a Discovery of the Causes why Ire land was never entirely subdued until the beginning of the reign of James the First. To this interruption of Henry's plans in Ireland, to which he never after found leisure to return, is to be ascribed the conti- nuance of that miserable anarchy, by which this un fortunate iland was afflicted during the four succeed ing centuries. By his institutions left thus fatally imperfect, the inhabitants became severally subject to two very different forms of government, the British colonists to the Anglo-Norman, the ancient natives to the Irissi under a new sovereignty. The condition of the Irissi princes, who had submitted, was no otherwise altered than that they professed alle giance to the king of England instead of the king of Connaught. Their Brehon laws, their ancient customs, their modes of succession, and their mu tual wars, waged as if by independent potentates, remained as much in force after, as they had been before the Englissi invasion. The British colonists on the other hand were in the fame political situa tion with their fellow subjects in England, ' governed by Englissi laws.

The territories acquired by himself and his Englissi subjects in Ireland were formed by Henry into shires or counties, with ssierisss and other magistrates upon the Englissi model ; which counties, afterwards en larged, formed what was called the English Pale, or that division of the iland within which the Englissi law was acknowledged. But even within the Pale were many septs of Irissi governed entirely by tneir ancient laws. Among the acts of this monarch was a charter, by which he granted the city of Dublin to the citizens of Bristol, with the fame privileges as those which they enjoyed at home. By another he granted the city of Waterford to the Oilmen, with Englissi laws and the rights of Englissi subjects. For the uninterrupted administration of affairs, a statute was enacted by the king in council, empow ering the chief officers of the crown in Ireland to elect a successor to the chief governor, in case of his death, till the royal pleasure ssiould be known. Hugh de Lacy was appointed chief governor ; and to him was granted the territory of Meath, already in pos session of Englissi troops ; and to John de Courcy the whole province of Ulster, provided that he could make a conquest of that unsubmitting part of the iland. Some inconsiderable hostilities after Henry's de parture were followed by insurrections of almost all the chiefs who had so lately sworn allegiance, when this"], [435, "BRITISH ILANDS. iu this monarch, engaged in dangerous wars, withdrew c*_\u00ab, great part of his forces from Ireland. The alacrity XVHL of Strongbow, who hasted into Normandy to his assistance, gained his confidence in such a degree, that he sent him back in the office of chief governor with discretionary powers. Raymond, the great support of this baron's authority, beloved by the soldiers, retired in disgust, till his request was grant ed, Basilia, the sister of Strongbow, given to him in marriage. Among the exploits of this warrior, who restored the superiority of the Englissi, was the reduction of Limerick. Seated in the Shannon, this town seemed to defy his efforts, as the bridges were broken; but, plunging his horse into the stream, he passed with the loss of only three men, and struck such a panic by this act of desperate valour, that slaughtering the runaways without resistance, he en- tered the city in triumph. Fearing an attack of the Englissi forces, and diffident Suiimiffii\u0152 . . of O'Con- of aid from the Irissi princes, Roderic O'Connor at nor. length made submission to Henry, who by his wisdom J i\"3. and vigour had vanquissied his enemies in France and Britain. For this purpose three commissioners from Roderic waited on him at Windsor, where the treaty was concluded in 1175. Retaining all his rights as monarch of Ireland, with exception of the Englissi Pale, the Irissi prince was bound only to the payment of homage and tribute to the king of Eng- land as his liege lord.

De Courcey was endowed with a mighty strength and hardness of body ; with a spirit not less un daunted and impetuous. With a band of about five hundred he arrived, after a four days' march, at the city of Down, which he seized and fortified. Dunleve, prince of Down, and his confederates, took arms, and three battles were fought with pro digious valour by the Irissi, but with victory to the Englissi, as the ponderous axes and unarmed bodies of the former were unequal to the arrows, lances, discipline, and mail of the latter. In the third battle, however, though the most decisive, the troops of De Courcey were on the brink of total excision. Conducting three great herds of cattle, the plunder of Macmahon's territory, an Irissi toparch, the Eng lissi army was, by a sudden onset, in a dangerous de file, thrown into confusion, and suffered great loss in its retreat to a more advantageous post.

His army, consisting of two hundred and forty horsemen and three hundred archers, was joined at Roseommon by Murrough's band ; but these confederates were defeated without a battle. Driving away all their herds, secreting their provisions, and even burning their churches, an act of profanation with the Irissi altogether new, the inhabitants of the invaded country rendered it a de fart. Churches had hitherto been sanctuaries invio late, where provisions and valuable effects reposited remained untouched, guarded by religious awe, amid the violence of the most fierce contention. The Englissi, in their marches, less attentive to the sanc tity of consecrated buildings than to the necessity of sustenance, had commonly with little scruple sup plied their wants from these asylums, and in cases of opposition had committed violence beyond their first intention. To regulate the business, a synod, con vened in Dublin hy Vivian, the legate, gave leave, by an ordonnance, to the Englissi troops to furnissi themselves from the churches with necessary victuals on payment of their just value. But the forces of De Cogan, deprived of this resource, were obliged to turn homeward to escape the inglorious death of famine. The enemy, who had not dared to face them as they advanced, hung with slaughter on their rear in their retreat ; and Murrough, the offending prince, was, according to the horrid practice of the Irissi in those days, adjudged to the loss of sight.

Amid these tumultuous commotions of the na tives most of the first Englissi adventurers departed from the stage. Maurice Fitzgerald died in 1177. Hervey of Mountmorres retired into a convent. Milo de Cogan was murdered, in 1183, by Mac tire, an Irishman, whom he had regarded as his firmly attached friend, and who had invited him to his house, for this fell purpose, with the strongest professions of cordial hospitality. With him were assassinated six companions, among whom was a young warrior who had married his daughter, a son of Fitzstephen. Besieged in Cork, but relieved by Raymond, Fitzstephen himself, depressed by an ac cumulated load of sorrow, agitations, and fatigues, was deprived of his reason, and died soon after. Hugh de Lacy was murdered in 1-185, by a single assassin, while he was employed in the building of a castle in Meath. Previously to Lacy's death, prince John, the youngest son of Henry, had entered on the govern ment of this country. So early as the year 1 1 78, this prince had been by his father, in a council of barons and prelates, nominated lord of Ireland, ap parently its feudal monarch, or perpetual viceroy, in place\", as it were, of Roderic, whose rights, as a Vol. I. E e subordinate"], [442, "4IS Chap. XVIII HISTORY OF THE subordinate king, recognized in his treaty of sub mission, seem to have been overlooked. Prince John entered not into the function of this dignity until the year 1185, the eighteenth of his age, when he landed at Waterford, on the last day of March, from a fleet of sixty ssiips, with a train of Norman courtiers, Englissi expectants and grave churchmen, among whom was Giraldus, the young monarch's tutor. Flattered by the exalted rank, and awed by the numerous troops of the new chief governor, the Irissi lords, even those who had hitherto been most refractory, hasted from all parts with so lively a cheerfulness to pay their homage, that important consequences might have resulted from prudent ma nagement in this administration ; but soon changed by misconduct from the smiling aspect of courtly de ference and peaceful submission, the country through out, with hardly an exception, assumed the grim visage of devouring war. Those chieftains of Leinster, who had always ad hered to the Englissi interest, were naturally sore most to make their obeisance. The Irissi garb, the strange form of the hair, the bussiy beard, and other national characteristics, new and uncouth to the eyes of the young Normans in the prince's train, excited at first view a spirit of mirth, which either prudence or true politeness would have concealed : but when these unpolissied lords, possessed of a high idea of their own respectability of rank, advanced with per fect ease to kiss tbe prince, in the cordial mode of salutation peculiar to the Irissi, they were pushed rudely back by the attendants, while all the com- pany,"], [443, "BRITISH ILANDS. 419 Chap XVIII pany, bursting into loud laughter, plucked their beards in derision, or otherwise treated them with contumely. With vengeance in their hearts, the chiefs retiring, met others hastening to the prince's court, and related to them, perhaps in heightened colours, the indignities with which their former loy alty and present zeal had been requited. The intel ligence was rapidly diffused ; and since the firm allies of the Englissi monarch had been treated with an outrageous contempt, intolerable to the spirit of Irissi lords, proud from the imagined splendour of their lineage and monarchal sway, what was to be expect ed, said men in general, by those who had been fiercely hostile to the Englissi government ? To make resentment burn with still greater fury, the minions of the prince, rapacious as insolent, seized the lands of those Irissi who held under Englissi lords by Eng lissi tenure within the Pale, and attempted also by pretended grants and legal fraud to treat in like manner the early British colonists. The insulted lords and dispossessed tenants of Lein ster, flying to their compatriots in Connaught and elsewhere, made such representations as induced the Irissi princes to suspend their private feuds and to unite their forces against the common foe. From all sides poured the storm of war on the Englissi set tlements, while the gay courtiers, and new soldiers brought from England by prince John, ssirunk into fortified places distant from danger, leaving the field of defense to the veteran colonists.

After eight months of rueful disorder, Henry, who, em barrassed by most weighty matters, had shewn almost as much weakness in the management of Ireland as of ability in that of England, informed at length of the ruinous effects of his son's mal-administration, recalled him, and appointed John de Courcey chief governor. The dissensions of the Irissi princes, which revived after the first fury of their assault on the Englissi set tlements, left room for the new deputy to arrange his forces for defense. In Ulster a deposed prince of the O'Loghlyn family regained his command on the murder of his rival, but, falling in a battle with the Englissi, left the subject of dispute for the swords of new competitors ; while in Connaught the sons of Roderic, in rebellion against their father, forced him to take refuge in the monastery of Cong, where he died at the age of almost ninety, twelve years after, in 1198, a prince of whose character we can hardly pretend to form a judgment from the meagre accounts transmitted to us.

The main spring of this plot was Eleanor, his queen, to whose bed he had proved unfaithful, and who sought revenge for her ill-requited love. The chief defect in Henry's character was his unlawful indulgence of the amorous passion, which, though he carried it not to any great excess, was productive, as on this occasion, of unhappiness. Even the do mestic virtues of a monarch are salutary to their sub ject., since their opposites, as in this instance, cause public calamity. His first mistress was Rosamond, the most celebrated beauty in England, daughter of Walter de Clifford, a baron of Herefordssiire. His acquairtance with her seems to have commenced in 1 149, when he was only sixteen years of age, in his visit to England before his accession to the throne, and before his marriage. Two sens by her were one a bissiop, the other a military commander. She died in the Nunnery of Godsiow near Oxford, to which ssie had retired some years before. Her remains were placed near the high altar, in a tomb covered with silk, about which lamps were kept perpetually burning, by the king's order, who bestowed large revenues on the convent ; but, after his death, were removed to the chapter-house of the nunnery, by order of a prelate, who probably thus made court to queen Eleanor.

Prince Henry, the king's eldest son, had been . ; o Conspiracy. crowned monarch of England, as I have mentioned n75_ in my fourteenth chapter, at the age of sixteen, to secure his succession. He is said to have replied, at the feast on this occasion, to one who complimented him on being attended by his father, that \" the at tendance of the son of an earl on the son of a king was no great condescension ;\" an expression signifi cant of that arrogant ambition which he afterwards by evil instigation displayed. As Margaret, his con sort, daughter of the French monarch, had not, on ac count of the secrecy observed from a fear of Becket's interposition, been at this time crowned with him, the ceremony was repeated in 1173 at Winchester, that ssie ssiould have the opportunity of participating in the honour. By queen Eleanor, his mother, and several instruments employed by her, this prince, while his father was in Ireland, had been persuaded into the belief that his coronation had given him the right of actual dominion, which he ought to seize by force when it was not otherwise attainable. For the effecting of this purpose a conspiracy was formed of such power and extent as appeared to ren der it quite irresistible, composed of the kings of France and Scotland, the princes Richard and Geof- fry, brothers of prince Henry, the earls of Flanders and Boulogne, and many nobles of both France and England, subjects of the Englissi monarch, all of whom expected their several advantages.

As a first step in the execution of an odious con. 1173. {piracy, where three boys were supported by kings and numerous nobles in a scheme for the dethrone- ment of an affectionate father, young Henry de manded what he justly expected to be refused, im mediate possession of the realm of England, or of Anjou or Normandy ; and soon after fled to the French court. His two conspiring brothers made also their escape ; but queen Eleanor, in attempting the same, disguised in the apparel of a man, was arrested and imprisoned. Finding the plot so gene ral that he was doubtful whom to trust, even among those who held offices nearest to his person, king H^nry had recourse to a measure, of which he was fortunately enabled to avail himself in this extre mity of peril by money which he had saved when no danger threatened. Those mercenary troops, sol diers of fortune, commonly called Brabanters, whom he had banissied from England twenty years before, as the pest of society, he now engaged in his pay to the number of twenty thousand; and, as his cha racter for generosity to men of military merit was establissied, they served him with fidelity. Seeing him supported by such a force, many, who were well inclined to his cause, but had been wavering through fear of being involved in his ruin, were confirmed"], [451, "BRITISH ILANDS. 427 Chap XIX. confirmed in his defense ; and many, who had con spired against him, were deterred from joining the enemy. Thus enabled to augment his army by some bands of his own subjects, he took a defensive sta tion in his dukedom of Normandy, into which vast forces poured from different quarters, those of Bou logne and Flanders on the east, those of the French monarch on the south. The former, when they had reduced many for tresses, were withdrawn by the earl of Flanders, who was struck with remorse on the death of his brother, the count of Boulogne, by an arrow in the knee from a cross bow. Relieved from this pressure, Hen ry directed his efforts to the southern side, advancing with alacrity to give battle to king Lewis, who was besieging Verneuil. The latter prince availed him self of a truce fraudulently obtained, under the pre text of a conference for a pacification, not only to retreat in a disgraceful manner, but even to gain ad mittance previously into the town, and treacherously to burn a great part of it. The Brabanters next marched westward against the rebels in Brittany, whom they routed ; and, laying siege to Dol, took prisoners near a hundred of the hostile nobles. In a ssiort time after, by the mediation of the pope's leo-ates, the kings of France and England met in conference, in which the latter offered the most ample terms in favour of his sons : but as nothing less than the debilitation of his rival by the dismem berment of his continental dominions could satisfy Lewis, these offers were rejected ; while the earl of Leicester, dreading the punissiment due to his rebel- lion"], [452, "HISTORY OF THE 428 Chap XIX War in England 117 1- lion in case of his master's re-establissiment in power, caused the meeting to end abruptly by his violent behaviour, opprobriously insulting the king, and lay ing his hand on his sword as if he meant to draw it against him. After various operations in France of no interest at present in the detail, Henry was re called to England to oppose an impending danger of the most alarming magnitude. Soon after the invasion of Normandy by the French and Flemings, the civil war had commenced in Eng land with a siege laid by the royal troops to the town and castle of Leicester, as the owner, the earl of that title, was known to be in rebellion. Having gained the town, and having granted a truce to the garrison of the castle, the royal generals hasted to the north to oppose the king of Scotland, William, surnamed the lion, whose troops had entered Cumberland, and thence, repulsed in their assaults of Carlisle, had crossed to the north of Yorkssiire, repeating the atro cious cruelties of their predecessors in the times of Stephen. These barbarous bands, so ardent to slaugh ter the defenseless, fled into Scotland on the ap proach of the Englissi troops, who pursued them, burned Berwick, and wasted Lothian; but were obliged to conclude a truce with William, and to return to the south, when they received intelligence that the earl of Leicester had landed in Suffolk with an army of Flemings, and was joined by the Englissi rebels in that quarter. The Flemissi troops, in their march north westward to Leicesterssiire, were inter. cepted near Farnham, totally routed, and the earl of Leicester with his countess taken prisoner. But, at"], [453, "42i> Chap, XIX Penance at Becket's tomb 1171, BRITISH ILANDS. at the expiration of the truce, the Scots with horri ble devastation again entered England, where some rebel barons maintained hostility, and many others were expected to join in the revolt, so soon as the earl of Flanders and prince Henry ssiould have land ed in Kent with a great army, in pursuance of a plan formed for the overwhelming of king Henry, whose continental dominions were at the fame time to be assailed with prodigious force. Convinced of the absolute necessity of his presence in England at this crisis, this monarch embarked at Barfleur in July and landed, after a storm, at Southampton ; but, instead of advancing immediately against the foe, he turned aside to perform a ceremony singular and surprising, perhaps the result at once of hypo crisy to interest the imaginations of men in his fa vour, and of a severe depression of mind caused by the unnatural and ungrateful rebellion of his own children, aided by a confederacy of so dangerous a strength. A belief of numerous and prodigious miracles, such as the restoration of life to men and other ani mals, and of eyes torn from the sockets, and of am putated members, had been establissied by the report of the monks of Canterbury, countenanced from in terested motives by the pope, who had, two years after that prelate's death, constituted him a faint and martyr. To impress the public with the idea of his admission into the favour of so powerful a faint, Henry made a pilgrimage to his tomb, where he sub mitted to a severe and humiliating penance. On sight of the Cathedral of Canterbury, at the dis- tance"], [454, "HISTORY OF THE 430 Chap, XIX tance of three miles, he alighted, and walked all , that way with bare feet, which were so wounded by ssiarp stones as to mark the road in several places with blood. Having, by the bissiop of London, de- clared his innocence of Becket's murder, and his resolution to suffer penance for the inconsiderate words which had caused it ; and having, at his own command, been scourged on the naked body by all the monks and some other ecclesiastics ; he spent that day and night, without intermission, in prayer before the tomb, kneeling on the bare pavement, fasting, and clad in sackcloth ; and, at his depar- ture, he assigned a yearly revenue, exceeding six hundred pounds of our money, to defray the ex- pence of lights incessantly burning, in honour of the faint, around his tomb. These extraordinary acts of the king, and a most important victory gained by his troops at the time of their performance, tended to the complete confirmation in the public mind of the sanctity of Becket. So vast became the renown of this pretended martyr, that the number of pil- grims, who visited his tomb in one year, is said to have amounted to a hundred thousand. \" It is in- deed,\" fays Hume, \" a mortifying reflection to those who are actuated by the love of fame, so justly de- nominated the last infirmity of noble minds, that the wisest legislator and most exalted genius, that ever informed or enlightened the world, can never expect such tributes of praise, as are lavissied on the me- mory of a pretended faint, whose whole conduct was probably to the last degree odious or contemptible, and whose industry was entirely directed to the pur- suit"], [455, "BRITISH ILANDS. 431 suit of objects pernicious to mankind.

This fortress was besieged by the Scottish monarch, who, totally unapprehensive of his Englissi opponents being able suddenly to assem ble a force against him, sent his numerous irregulars in scattered bands through the country to commit their usual devastations, and of his regulars retained very few immediately about his person. A detach ment of the latter burned the neighbouring town of Warkworth, and butchered all the inhabitants without exception or distinction. Fired with resent ment, the barons of Yorkssiire and their retainers, assembling under their ssieriff, Ranulph de Glanville, formed a band of cavalry, arrived at Newcastle much fatigued, on the eleventh of July, and at day-break in the next morning commenced a march of twenty four computed miles performed in less than five hours in their heavy armour. They were still however dis tant from their object, and found themselves involved in so dense a fog as almost discouraged their further progress ; but the air suddenly cleared soon after, when they discovered Alnwick very nigh. William, in a troop of sixty or seventy knights, in the adjacent plain, was tilting for amusement, when he perceived the enemy, whose march had been hitherto concealed by"], [456, "4'5__ >'u..f. xsx Cefiation of war in -fag! ml 1174, HISTORY OF THE by the fog, and whom he at first mistook for a body of his own men. Astonissied, yet undismayed, at the sight of hostile banners, and moved by a sudden impulse of false heroism, or expecting instant aid from other bands, he furiously charged, at the head of his little troop, the wearied Englissi ; but his horse was instantly killed, and himself taken pri soner, with most of his troops, and several nobles who flew from other places to ssiare the fortune of their sovereign. The victors with their captives re turned unmolested in the fame day to Newcastle. By the severity of his penance king Henry con tracted a slight fever, and had been bled for relief. He had scarcely recovered when he was awaked in the night by the intelligence of William's capture. Leaping instantly from bed with tears of joy, he re turned thanks to God, and putting himself at the head of his troops, proceeded with vigour against his Englissi rebels, unopposed by the Scots, who had all fled homeward on the news of their monarch's disaster. He was assisted on this occasion by a body of troops under his natural son by Rosamond, Geof fry, bissiop of Lincoln, who had already made noble exertions in his cause. The king declared aloud, in the hearing of many, that, \" while the rest of his sons had proved themselves bastards by their con duct, this young man alone had demonstrated his legitimacy.\" If the intended invasion from Flanders had been put in execution before king Henry's arrival in England, the consequence would have been most probably fatal ; but now, on the failure of the plan on the side of Scotland, that design was relinquissied, as"], [457, "BRITISH ILANDS. 433 Chap XIX.

In this situation they submitted one after another, sur rendering their castles, and were treated with great lenity. Thus enabled to embark for the defense of his continental territories, Henry sailed from Ports mouth on the seventh of August, and landed at Barfleur. In pursuance of the general plan, a prodigious army, the combined forces of France and the Ne therlands, had entered Normandy, and laid siege to Rouen, its capital, on the twenty-first of July. The citizens had made an admirably brave defense, espe cially when their walls were treacherously assailed at the time of a delusive truce, in the festival of Saint Lawrence. On the arrival of Henry, whose Welch troops performed signal service in destroying the con voys of the besiegers, the confederates retreated on the twenty-fourth of August, and proposed a truce for a pacific negociation. Prince Richard alone, fierce and stubborn, refused the proposed conditions ; but, abandoned by his allies, and overpowered by his father's forces, he was compelled to submit to that monarch's mercy. A peace was concluded on the twenty-ninth of September, on terms much less advantageous to the rebellious princes than had been before offered, yet extremely moderate on the side of king Henry, who, by magnanimous exertions, aided by Providence, had triumphed over a combi nation, which appeared at first irresistible, as even the most loyal of his subjects, all of whom he had caused to swear allegiance to his eldest son, would, Vot..

The treaty was founded on mutual restitution, mu tual forgiveness, and the return of the rebellious princes to filial duty and parental protection. The king and prince Henry engaged, each to extinguish for ever his resentment against those who had acted in this war against him : but crimes, not authorized by the supposed rules of military contention, were left to the ordinary course of law ; and prisoners, with their hostages, who had compounded with the king, before the pacification, were not included in the treaty. In conclusion the king liberated with out ransom, contrary to the practice of the age, nine hundred and sixty-one captive knights ; and of those prisoners who were excepted from the benefit of the treaty, not one was punissied in person or pro perty ; \" an instance of mercy,\" says Lyttleton, \" to which no parallel can be found in the whole history of mankind !\" He thus hoped to disarm the enmity of his sons against his faithful adherents, who might in future time be subject to their power. The numerous troops of the Scottissi monarch had, on his captivity, retired to their homes, committing, both in and after their retreat, the most atrocious disorders. They massacred all whom they could seize of the Englissi, both those who had joined their standards as allies, and those who were dwellers in Scotland. The latter were numerous in the towns of the Lowlands, where they had been invited to settle for the improvement of the country by its kings, under whose especial protection they had hi- therto"], [459, "BRITISH ILANDS. 435 Chap XIX therto lived. Scotland became a scene of anarchy. The barbarous Gallowegians, the most cruel of the Scottissi ravagefs, disclaimed all authority of their king, destroyed his fortresses, and put to the sword the garrisons. Their leaders were Gilbert and Uc tred, sons of Fergus, descended from the ancient princes of Galloway. The former murdered the latter, and, notwithstanding a fierce contest main tained against him by a son of the deceased, gained possession of the whole. In such a state of distrac tion and weakness the Scots appeared utterly nnable to resist an invasion of the Englissi monarch, when he was now disengaged from all other enemies, and when the Gallowegians, imploring him to admit them as his subjects, offered to join their arms to his. In a treaty, therefore, for the feudal subjection of their country to the Englissi crown, the barons and prelates of Scotland readily concurred with their king, who might justly think the condition mode rate, when his life was completely in the power of a prince whom he had most atrociously injured, and against whom he was, as a vassal for some territories which he held in England by fealty and homage, guilty of high treason. By a convention made at the Norman town of Falaise, confirmed at York in the August of 1 175, and fully executed, the sove reignty of Scotland and of all its members was com pletely surrendered to the crown of England. King William, with all his barons, prelates, knights, and freeholders, swore fealty, and performed liege ho mage to king Henry at York, into whose hands had been delivered the fortresses of Berwick, Roxburgh, Ff2 Jedburgh,"], [460, "HISTORY OF THE 436 Chap, XIX A monkisti riot, 1176 Jedburgh, Edinburgh, and Sterling, to be held by his garrisons, which garrisons were to be maintained, at such expense as he ssiould dictate, by the Scottissi monarch. To this monarch, after the full perfor mance of his agreement, his fortresses were restored, except those of Berwick and Roxburgh, which, for reasons not recorded, were still retained, perhaps on account of the reluctance expressed by the Scottissi clergy against the stipulated subjection of their church to that of England. As the princes of Wales had, in like manner, by liege homage and fealty, already become subject to the Englissi crown, Henry was now monarch of all Britain, the first ever vested with that authority : but, by the total exhaustion of his treasury in the civil war, by the occupation of a variety of ar rangements, by his promise to go on a crusade, and chiefly by the apprehension of hostile intrigues affecting his transmarine dominions, he was pre vented from taking measures to complete the con quest of Ireland, by which he would have become king of all the Britissi ilands. In ecclesiastical affairs he acted with such address as to avoid quarrelling with the church, without relinquishing his preroga tives, yet was often obliged to temporize. Of the instances of this temporizing conduct one, which occurred in 1 1 j6, appears worth notice. Cardinal Huguzon, the pope's legate, having come into Eng land, by the king's invitation, for the pretended purpose of determining the question of primacy be tween the archbissiops of Canterbury and York, and having referred the decision to some French prelates, convened a synod, in a chapel in Westminster, on a Sunday"], [461, "BRITISH ILANDS. 437 Sunday in lent, \" to hear the mandates and precepts Chap. of the sovereign pontiff,\" What these were we ._, are not informed, as the synod was dissolved at its commencement by a scandalous tumult. The legate was no sooner seated than a struggle arose between the two archbissiops for the place of honour at his right hand. On the sight of this, the monks of Canterbury, who detested the prelate of York on account of his having adhered to the king in his contest with Becket, rufted on him with such fury, that not without difficulty was he rescued half dead by the rest of the council. Unwilling to quarrel with the prelate of Canterbury, and having promised to the legate not to punissi by the civil power any offender in holy orders, Henry, though greatly irritated, resolved, as the safest measure for his extrication from the bu- siness, to reconcile the two primates, on whom he prevailed to take an oath that they would suspend all \u00bb enmity against each other during five years. The cardinal, highly scandalized, had returned to Rome, but soothed by the gold of the offending primate, had relinquissied the design of a complaint to the pope. By Henry's moderation and firmness in the admi- Fame of nistration of his government, and the observance of justice. his treaties, the fame of his justice became so great, that two Spanissi kings, Sanchez of Navarre, and Alphonso of Castile, agreed to refer to his arbitra tion an ancient and great controversy, which had caused much bloodssied and devastation in the king doms of both. The opinion entertained of his in corruptible impartiality as a judge appears in the strongest"], [462, "4SS Chap XIX. Death of prince Henry. 1133 HISTORY OF THE strongest light when we consider that, though Al phonso was married to a daughter of Henry, the proposal of this arbitration was made by Sanchez. Advocates were sent by the two monarchs, and pledges given for their standing to the award. Hav ing heard the suit in his high court of parliament, at Westminster, in the lent of the year 1177, Henry decreed a full restitution on both sides, with the an nual payment of a sum of money to Sanchez from Alphonso. His interference was also three times with success exerted, at the request of the parties concerned, in the healing of discord in the royal family of France, where, on the decease of Lewis the seventh in 1180, his only son, Philip, at the age of fifteen, ascended the throne. The court was distracted by two factions, headed by the earl of Flanders and the king's mother, whose contest for power, while each attempted to govern in the name of a young monarch, produced a ferment in the state. After two adjustments, a civil war took place, which was terminated by the fame means of adjust ment, the interposition of the Englissi monarch in 1182. So successful in his mediations abroad by his esta blissied character of judicial integrity, this monarch was peculiarly unfortunate at Rome in the discord and disobedience of his legitimate sons. Prince Henry, commonly styled the young king, instigated by his courtiers, from their own sinister views of private emolument, had shewn in 1 1 j6, after a re cbnciliation apparently the most perfect, an uncon querable desire of living separately from his father. On"], [463, "BRITISH ILANDS. 439 On pretence of a pilgrimage to Saint James of Chap. Compostella in Spain, he went in that year from ,_^IX'_^ England to France, where he assisted his brother Richard in the reduction of the rebel barons of Aquitaine. Keeping his court at Poictiers he re-ad mitted to his intimacy many knights who were odi ous to his father on account of their former bad advice. Having intercepted a letter to king Henry from Adam de Chirkedun, an ecclesiastic, appointed his temporary chancellor by that monarch, in which great complaints were made against the wicked de signs of these men, he caused the writer to be most cruelly scourged through the streets of Poictiers, and of all the towns in his way thence to Argenton, where he was destined to imprisonment. At the re quisition of king Henry, he was delivered into the hands of persons deputed to receive him, but of his fortune afterwards we are not informed. In 1 177 a reconciliation was effected, by what means we know not, between prince Henry and his father ; and another in 1181, when the prince, hav ing demanded a present grant of the Norman dutchy or some other dominion, was so well satisfied with a magnificent pension in its place, that he spontane ously bound himself by a new oath never to ask more, and to be always governed by his father's advice. But in 11 83 he was involved in a war to tally inconsistent with this obligation. While prince Geoffry, by command of the king his father, per formed, as duke of Brittany, homage to prince Henry, as his future liege lord, this acknowledg ment of superiority was refused for Aquitaine by prince"], [464, ".40 Chap XIX HISTORY OF THE prince Richard, who proposed to hold that fief, after his father's death, independently of the Englissi crown, as an immediate vassal of the French mo narch. Irritated by this and some other subjects of dispute, prince Henry formed a league with many barons of Aquitaine, who offered to revolt to his party from Richard. Joined in this league, from motives unknown to us, by his brother Geoffry, he invaded Aquitaine with an army of Brabanters and the troops of Brittany. Such was the rancour of the partizans in this fraternal contest, that no quar ter was given on either side. To protect one son from being overwhelmed by the troops of two others king Henry levied forces with speed, and marched in person to the scene of war. A strange alternation succeeded of negociations and hostilities obscurely recorded. For this we can no otherwise account than by supposing the two confederate brothers to have had no real command over their mercenary Brabanters, \"and feudal militia of the barons in their party, who were interested in the prevention of a peace with the king. Twice, in times of pacific parley, was the life of this monarch treacherously attempted, at the castle of Limoges, by arrows from the walls ; and at other times also infractions of truce were committed in the wounding or killing of his adherents. The followers at length of young Henry, pressed by financial wants, thought a decisive battle neces sary for their disembarrassment, and prevailed on their leader to adopt their design. The dread of a defeat, and the horror of his father's murder, if that mo- narch"], [465, "BRITISH ILANDS. 441 narch ssiould fall, caused a violent agitation which ter- Chap. minated in a mortal fever. By a message he confessed , J; ' his guilt, and implored his father's presence. Fear ing the treachery of his son's attendants, the king declined to go, but sent his ring as a token of his forgiveness. Clothed in sackcloth, with a halter about his neck, the prince expired on a heap of assies, on which he had ordered himself to be placed, and was buried at Rouen. Perhaps in all history no stronger instance can be found of the evil effects of sinister counsel, since this young prince, twice in rebellion against a most affectionate father, was, be side a heroic spirit and prowess in arms, endowed with the most amiable qualities and universally be loved. Impressed with the idea of these, and for getting his errors, king Henry fainted thrice with excessive grief at the news of his death. On the loss of their prime leader, their expected Posterior future king, the revolters dispersed, submitted, and tions. seem to have been pardoned, according to the re- i'83 quest of the prince in his last moments. All dis pute concerning homage from the dutchy of Aqui taine to the Englissi crown was now at an end, since Richard, its duke, was now heir to that crown ; but another dispute arose. King Henry, from what motives we know not, since none of true policy ap pear, required that dutchy for his youngest son, John. To this requisition F.ichard returned an ab solute refusal. Geossry and John attempted by arms to force his compliance; but their forts were for midably resisted, and their father _ exposed to put an end to their quarrel. On the intelligence of an- us.. other"], [466, "HISTORY OF THE 442 Chap, XIX. 1185 1186 1136 1188 other war between Richard and Geoffry, their father passed into France, and obliged the former to resign Aquitaine to queen Eleanor, his mother, the right ful dutchefs. This lady had been liberated in the preceding year from her confinement, on the arrival in England of her daughter, the dutchefs of Saxony, whose husband, the ancestor of the present royal fa mily of Brunswick, had been expelled from his Ger man dominions by a confederacy of German princes. In the year 1186 the plan was changed. Richard was sent to Aquitaine to make war on the earl of Toulouse, and Eleanor was carried back into Eng land by her huftand, and again consigned to cus tody, where ssie was not liberated till his death. For this no cause appears, as history is very defective concerning the latter part of this monarch's reign. According to the general pronenefs to sinister am bition in the sons of Henry, an attempt was made by Geoffry to obtain from his father, by the influ ence of king Philip, the earldom of Anjou in addi tion to Brittany ; and, on the failure of negociation, a plan was laid, for seizing it by arms ; but, in the midst of his preparations, this prince died at Paris of a fever, caused, some say, by bruises received in a tournament. War was often threatened by the French monarch from other causes. In a conference between him and Henry, near Gisors, in the Ja nuary of 1 188, for the adjustment of their differ ences, both kings were persuaded, by William, arch bissiop of Tyre, solemnly to engage, that they would march to the relief of the christians in the Holy Land, who were overpowered by the Mohammedans. Returning"], [467, "BRITISH ILANDS. 443 Chap, XIX Returning to England, Henry convened, in the suc ceeding month, a great council at Gritington in , Northamptonssiire, where supplies were voted for the crusade. All, who would not personally serve in this holy war, were commanded to pay a tenth of their revenues for one year, and of all their goods, except some species, as books, clothes, and military accoutrements. On condition of the fame assess ment being paid by Scotland, an offer was made of the restoration of Roxburgh and Berwick : but the Scottissi parliament, perhaps from a sense of national poverty, returned a most positive denial to the entrea ties of their own monarch, and of the Englissi en voys commissioned to request it. If Henry, which may be matter of doubt, was sincere in his profes sions of an intended crusade, his design was pre vented by a war between him and Philip, his confe derate in the promised expedition. By a cruel treat ment of some traders, the subjects of prince Richard, by the earl of Toulouse, an invasion was caused of the territories of the latter. The French monarch, who, influenced by the justice of his cause, gave countenance at first to the hostility of Richard, af terwards interposed to prevent the earl's ruin. Un der this pretence he invaded king Henry's domi nions, and seized Berry. Recalled to France for the defense of his estates, Henry acted with such vigour, that peace was proposed by his opponent, and two conferences were held, but without an amicable conclusion, by the two monarchs.

War An agreement had many years before been made against between the kings of France and England, that Ade- Philip and f . . Richard. lais, the sister of Philip, ssiould be married to prince 1189. Richard, on the arrival of the parties at the proper age ; and, for this destination, the princess had been committed to Henry's charge, and educated in the Englissi court. Philip, after the puberty of the prince and princess, had repeatedly demanded, that either the marriage ssiould be performed, or his sister re- stored ; and, in case of refusal, had threatened war, which Henry had averted by various artifices. For the conduct of the Englissi monarch, in declining to comply with so just a demand, we cannot otherwise account than by admitting, what appears very pro- bable, that himself was enamoured of Adelais, and hoped to have an opportunity of marrying her either by the divorce or death of his queen. So early as the November 1175, the hopes of procuring a di- vorce are said to have been his motive for bringing cardinal Huguzon into his kingdom, and of acting toward him with such compliance. Though the pope then reigning refused to indulge him, he might expect more complaisance from a future pontiff. A passionate fondness of the fair sex, so apt to prevail in men of generous minds, so productive of mis chief when not confined within due bounds, so liable to be indulged to excessive weakness by men ad- vanced in years, seems to have been the chief source of error in Henry's conduct. In"], [469, "BRITISH ILANDS. 445 Chap XIX. In the winter succeeding the campaign of 1188, Richard, who had vigorously assisted his father, ear nestly requested the completion of his promised mar riage. When this was declined, on what grounds of excuse we can only conjecture, the prince engag ed king Philip to join him in soliciting not only this, but also the usual pledge of security for his succession to the throne at his father's decease, the oaths of fealty of all the subjects of the Englissi crown to him as heir apparent. In a conference of the two monarchs Henry refused, alleging that his compli ance in the present circumstances might be ascribed to compulsion. A false suspicion had, with hostile intention, been industriously infused into Richard, that instead of bequeathing, as appears to have been the real design, some part of his French dominions to prince John, his father intended to fix on the head of this young prince the crown of England. To bring this, according to his idea, to a proof, Richard in conclusion entreated that, at least, his inheritance of the kingdom of England ssiould be secured ; and, receiving an answer not quite satis factory, he immediately, with a reserve of fealty to his father, performed homage for all the French do minions of the Englissi crown to Philip, on whom he now resolved to depend for support against the imaginary machinations of his father against him. On the expiration of the truce, at the feast of Saint Hilary in 1 1 89, Henry was assailed by the united armies of his son and king Philip. By the interposition of a legate from the pope the truce was renewed, and another conference held. As the fame proposals"], [470, "4-Uj Chap XIX I. ea'h of Henry 1 l\u00bb9 HISTORY OF THE proposals were, on pretences in all appearance frivo lous, rejected by Henry, hostilities recommenced. As he had now the whole army of Richard against him, combined with that of the French king, the English monarch was overpowered before he could be reinforced by levies from England. After the conquest of Mans, Tours, and many places of less importance, by the confederates, he found himself obliged to agree to a pacification, the articles of which are not accurately recorded. He was bound to pay Philip twenty thousand marks, above two hundred thousand pounds of our present money ; to cause all his vassals to swear fealty to Richard, sav ing their faith to himself; to commit Adelais to the care of some great personage, who ssiould be bound to surrender her for disposal in marriage on the re turn of Richard or Philip from the crusade ; and to leave Mans, Tours, and two castles, in the hands of these princes as pledges for his performance of the stipulated terms. The deferring of the disposal of Adelais till the return of a leader from a very distant and most dan gerous war might seem a point of importance to Henry, who might still fondly hope that intervening accidents might yet prove favourable to the indul gence of his passion. But, such is the vanity of human prospects ! his constitution had become en feebled by the agitations of his mind, insomuch that no rational hope could be entertained of his restora tion to a firm state of health, while a still more vio lent agitation was on the point of completing the de struction of his fame. Influenced perhaps by some offers"], [471, "BRITISH ILANDS. 447 Chap XIX offers of Richard, which might seem less doubtful than the intended favours of Henry, who might not live long, prince John had taken arms, and joined the coalition against his father.

This impostor was Mohammed, born at the city of Mecca in the year 569 of the christian era. Of a contemplative habit and reflect- ing mind, he may have been disgusted with the gross idolatry of the christians of that age, as well as hea- thens ;"], [473, "BRITISH ILANDS. 449 Chai XX thens ; and may, with good intentions, have formed the sublime, but impracticable scheme, of establissi ing a mode of worssiip clear os impurity, and wor thy of being addressed .to the inconceivable author of the Universe. Whatever were his motives, he de clared himself, in the fortieth year of his age, a pro phet, the last and greatest of the apostles, commis sioned by the Almighty to eradicate superstition, and to restore the purity of religion in the simple wor ssiip of the one only God. Hence the creed of all sects of mohammedans is simply this, \" there is only one God, and Mohammed is his prophet.\" Violently opposed at Mecca, and at length con- demned to capital punissiment, Mohammed fled to Medina in 622, where he had gained many prose- lytes. From this flight of their prophet, called the Hcjira, commences the era of the mohammedans, who thence reckon their years, as christians reckon Lorn the birth of Christ. Enraged by persecution, he had recourse to arms, declaring himself au- thorized from Heaven to exterminate erroneous worssiip by the sword. From Medina, where, under the idea of a divine commission, he held absolute rule, he extended his dominion over Mecca and all Arabia. Expiring at the age of sixty-three, he left to his successors, the califs, the tassi of extending his religion over the neighbouring nations. A holy war was proclaimed for the conversion of all mankind to the new faith. At once were the mutually hostile empires of Greece and Persia invaded, with impe- tuous ardour, by the bands of the Saracens, a name of unknown etymology collectively given to the Vol. I. G g tribes"], [474, "HISTORY OF THE 450 Chap XX The Turks. tribes of the Arabian regions ; and the choice of conversion, tribute, or battle, was imperiously of- fered to the astonished inhabitants of Syria and the Persian provinces. Notwithstanding dissentions and civil wars between competitors for the califate, and \"a subsequent degeneracy of the califs themselves, success was still attendant on the arms of a people whose native spirit was sublimed by enthusiasm ; in- somuch that, in a hundred years after the Hejira, the arms and reign of the successors of Mohammed extended from India to the Atlantic ocean. In the year 637 of the christian era, in their conquest of Syria, they gained possession of Jerusalem, vene- rated, as the scene of our Saviour's passion, by all sects of christians, who resorted to it in pilgrimage. As devotional zeal is apt to be stimulated by grief and indignation, the resort became still greater after this conquest ; and, as they brought a large influx of money, the pious visitants were wisely protected by the Saracen government. But the state of affairs underwent a very unfavourable change by the rise of a new dominion in this part of Asia. Anciently Turk and Tartar appear to have been synonymous terms ; at least under the name of Turks was comprehended a great proportion of the Tartar race, a race distinct from the Moguls, Manssioors, and other denominations of men, who have been thinly scattered in the immense wilds of Tartary. In the sixth century we find a wide empire establissi ed in these wilds under a Turkissi nation of nomadic life, whose moving capital, or chief encampment, regarded mount Altai as an object of which it was never"], [475, "BRITISH ILANDS. 451 Chap.

This empire, after a period of two centuries, was dissolved, \" but the name,\" says Gibbon, \" was still famous among the Greeks and Orientals ; and the scattered fragments of the na tions, each a powerful and independent people, were scattered over the desert from China to the Oxus and the Danube.\" In the ninth century we find great numbers of Turks in the service of the calif who resided at Bagdad, composing his armies and even the guards of his person. As in the natural course of events the military slaves of a despot be come his tyrants, these troops became mutinous ; their compatriot commanders usurped the dominion of the palace and of the provinces. Califs were de posed or murdered, and others elevated to the va cant throne, at the pleasure of these foreign merce naries, who, under colour of its defenders, reigned sometime masters of the empire. These disorders were afterwards in some degree corrected by abler hands at the political helm. The Turkissi soldiery, skilfully divided, or employed in foreign warfare, suffered a less irregular course of government to be resumed. But the califs never after recovered their importance ; and the bands of Turks, who continued to emigrate to the south for military employments, adopting the mohammedan religion and stationary life of the natives, raised their leaders at length to the power and title of sovereign princes in those regions which had before owned the sway of the calif. Thus a Turk, named Sebectagi, rendered himself prince of Gasna in the east of Per sia, in the latter part of the tenth century ; and his G g 2 son"], [476, "HISTORY OF THE 452 Chap XX. Crusades, son Mamood, who succeeded in 997, extended his empire from the Caspian to the Indus. On this mo narch was first conferred the title of Sultan, a Chal d\u00e6an or Arabic term signifying absolute lord. His son and successor, Massoud, was slain in a rebellion of pastoral Turks, his subjects, in 1083 ; and in Togrul-beg, called by the Greeks Tangrolipix, the grandson of Seljuk, commenced a new dynasty, that of the Seljukians. Under this monarch and his two proximate successors, Alp Arslan and Malek Shah, the Turkissi dominion was so enlarged, that, in the feign of the last, it extended from the vicinity of China to the Syrian coast, and from southern Ara bia to the north of the Caspian. In Syria, which was conquered about the year 1076, the condition of the christians, residing at Jerusalem, or visiting it in pilgrimage, was altered greatly for the worse. Travelling was unsafe in a country unprotected by regular government ; and the Turks from barbarian ferocity, or eagerness to display the zeal of new con verts, treated with savage insolence those who con formed not to the mohammedan modes of worssiip. The indignation, excited among the christians of the West by the reports of Turkissi violence and ex tortion, was enflamed to the utmost by the vehement harangues of a famous fanatic, named Peter the her mit, who, travelling from town to town, patheti cally vociferated to assembled multitudes the meri torious necessity of rescuing by arms the sepulchre of Christ and the Holy Land from the insulting in sidels. With Peter, in the project of uniting the arms of the christians of Europe against the moham- medans"], [477, "BRITISH ILANDS. 453 Chap XX medans of Asia, concurred pope Urban the second, who, in 1095, assembled a synod of four thousand clergymen in a plain near Placentia, whence they were dismissed to preach this doctrine in their respec tive districts. To second the exhortations of the so vereign pontiff the ambassadors of the Greek em peror appeared in this council, representing the pe rilous condition of the rest of Europe, if the rem nant of his dominions ssiould fall a prey to the Turkish power. The Greek empire, whose capital, Constantinople, had been founded by Constantine the great about the year 324, was the eastern and surviving portion of the vast Roman empire, whose western provinces had been conquered by the Goths. From the dominion of the Greeks had been wrested Syria by the Saracens, Anatolia by the Turks, whose conquests were now separated by only a strait from Europe. In the November of the same year Urban convened another synod, not less respectable or nu merous, at Clermont in France ; and so great had been the effects of the means employed to rouse the public feelings, that to the harangues of the pontiff, from a lofty scaffold, the multitude of clergy and laity answered with a unanimous exclamation, as if in spired, \" it is the will of God.\" These words were adopted as the ssiout of battle ; and a red cross, em blematic of bloodssied, was marked on the breasts or ssioulders of those who engaged in the holy war, which from this cruciform badge was denominated Crusade. From a variety of motives, as religious enthusi asm, the tide of fassiion, the hopes of wealth in the rich"], [478, "HISTORY OF THE 454 Chap XX rich countries of the East, the complete remission of sins, of debts, and of punissiment for crimes, im mense multitudes took the cross in several parts of Europe; but, as the prime leaders, and most nu merous troops, were furnissied by France, all the christians of the West are to this day comprehended under the common denomination of Franks by the Turks and Arabs. The length of their proposed march was prodigious, from France to Constanti nople, and thence, through the hostile regions of Anatolia and Syria, to Jerusalem. Hosts of disor derly peasants, under Peter the hermit and other no minal commanders, took the lead in this holy war, early in the spring of 1096, all of whom perissied before their more noble associates were ready to fol low, the majority by the christians of Hungary and other countries who resisted their depredations, the rest by the Turks, who erected in the plains of Nice an enormous pyramid of their bones. In the Au gust of the fame year the main force of the cru saders commenced its march in several divisions, un der various leaders of noble rank, and arrived in nine months at Constantinople. The Greek empe ror, Alexius Comnenus, who had solicited succours, and might have been effectively benefited by a mo derate reinforcement, was filled with astonissiment and terror when he beheld such a deluge of barba rian troops pouring into his territories, whose num bers are vaguely estimated at seven hundred thou sand, of whom one hundred thousand were cavalry fteathed in armour. By exertions of policy he se parated those armies, by whose union, in case of quarrel,"], [479, "BRITISH ILANDS. 455 Chap XX quarrel, he might have been overwhelmed ; he con ciliated their chiefs, and expedited their transporta tion across the Bosphorus. With the life of Malek Shah had expired in 1 192 the unity and strength of the Seljukian Turks, dis- tracted by the civil wars of not less than five candi- dates for the vacant throne, a brother and four sons of the deceased. Notwithstanding the broken state of the Turkissi power, so favourable to the views of the crusaders, whose hosts appeared so prodigious as to\"give occasion to say that \" Europe seemed loosen- ed from its foundations and hurled against Asia,\" the opposition which they encountered was far from contemptible, while by their ignorance and indisci- pline the efficiency of their force was greatly dimi- nissied. Aided by the arts and engines of the Greeks, they reduced, in the June of 1097, t^le \"ty \u00b0s Nice, the capital of Roum or Anatolia, one of the king- doms into which the empire of Malek Shah had be- come divided. By Soliman, sultan of this kingdom, they were assailed in the following month near Dory- l\u0153um in Phrygia, and, after an obstinate battle, were victorious. \" Their encounter,\" fays Gibbon, \" was varied and balanced by the contrast of arms and discipline ; of the direct charge and the wheel- ing evolutions ; of the couched lance and the bran- dissied javelin ; of a weighty broad-fword and a crooked sabre ; of cumbrous armour and thin flow ing robes ; and of the long Tartar bow and the arbalist or cross-bow, a deadly weapon, yet unknown to the Orientals.\" In their progress, in the following year, they received intelligence that Jerusalem had been conquered"], [480, "1 i_ Chap XX. HISTORY OF THE conquered from the enfeebled Turks by the calif of Egypt, one of the three mohammedan pontiffs, who severally claimed the exclusive right of being the le gitimate successor of the prophet. To the amicable offers made by the calif of an alliance against the common enemy, and of a hospitable protection of un armed christians visiting the holy sepulchre, the cru saders answered, that \" their alliance could be obtain ed, or their hostility prevented, by no other means than a timely surrender of the Holy land and its capital into their possession.\" They at length gained Jerusalem by assault, in the July of 1099, with an army so diminissied by battle, famine, pestilence, de tachments, and desertion, that they could muster not more than twenty thousand effective infantry and fifteen hundred horse. Of this dearly earned con quest Godfrey of Buillon, the most worthy among the champions of the cross, was by the unanimous voice of the army elected monarch. With the armies of the first crusade no sovereign prince marched into Asia ; but in succeeding times we find kings and emperors conducting their troops against the mohammedans, for the support of the little kingdom of Jerusalem, and other small princi palities of christians, founded in the neighbouring parts by the first crusaders. Without the fame glory or success, these posterior expeditions were under taken, like the first, with mighty hosts, and attend ed with enormous loss of men and money. In the year 1147 the monarchs of Germany and France, Conrad the third and Lewis the seventh, crossed the Bosphorus, each at the head of seventy thou sand horse and innumerable infantry; but, not acting"], [481, "BRITISH ILANDS. 457 Chap XX. acting in concert, nor with military {kill, they were separately defeated, and by various disasters lost all except a feeble remnant of their troops. At the time of the third crusade Jerusalem had fallen into the hands of the mohammedans, and the christians were threatened with total expulsion from the Holy land. Chiefly by the discord of the Turks and Sa racens had these christians been enabled to maintain their possessions ; but Saladin, a warrior of the Cur dissi race, had, under the title of lieutenant to the calif of Bagdad, at length united the mohammedan states in their neighbourhood by rendering himself master of Egypt and the countries thence to the con fines of Anatolia. In the October of 1187, after a completely decisive battle at Tiberias, he took Jeru salem by capitulation, and soon reduced almost all the other towns of the country. The alarms, ex cited by these events in Europe, caused the third crusade, in which were engaged the emperor Fre derick Barbarossa, and the kings of France and England. The two latter, who were warned by the misfortunes of preceding adventurers to avoid the difficulties of a march on land, were long delayed in the transportation of their armies across the Me diterranean. Frederick, an able commander, in structed by the experience of forty campaigns, passed the Hellespont in 1 189 with sixty thousand cavalry and a hundred thousand foot, defeated the Turks, and effected a march through Anatolia ; but sustained vast loss by hardssiips, and was drowned in a river of Cilicia.

On the news of the fatal battle of Tiberias, the ensign of the cross had been assumed in 1 187 by Richard, the elder of the two surviving sons of Henry the second, who was however prevented by the af- fairs of France, related in the foregoing chapter, from the performance of his vow till after his acces- sion to the throne, under the name of Richard the first, on the death of his father in 11 89. He then, perhaps less actuated by the superstition of the times than the love of military renown, embarked in the cause with such earnestness and energy, as if the reco- very of the Holy land were by him regarded as the sole object of his reign. The deep contrition, which he expressed for his rebellion against his father, he proved to be real by a conduct which prudence might have dictated, if prudence had constituted an ingredient in his character. He permanently treated with hatred and contempt the favourers of his rebel- lion ; with cordial kindness and confidence the vigo- rous opposers of it, the faithful ministers of the late king, whom he continued in their places. Having issued immediate orders for the release of his mother from her confinement, and for a treatment of her suitable to her dignity and his filial respect, he sailed from France to England before the middle of Au gust, and was crowned on the third of September, when an execrable proof was given of the relaxa tion of government after the death of Henry. The Jews, who had been wisely protected by the regulations of the late reign, and who had by in- dustry"], [483, "BRITISH ILANDS. 459 dustry and ceconomy possessed themselves of most of Chap. the ready coin, were odious to the people, not only , ~; \u25a0'. on account of their religion, but also of their usury, a trade almost monopolized by them, as the absurd prejudices of christians condemned the receiving of interest for money lent, how moderate soever. With what he considered as a becoming zeal in a cham pion of the cross, Richard gave command that none of this infidel race ssiould appear at his coronation. Yet, presuming on presents of great value, voted to him by their sect, as a compliment on his accession, some of the more wealthy Jews ventured to press forward in the crowd. On discovery they were as saulted and pursued : a cry was raised that the king had ordered all the Jews to be massacred : the popu lace assailed them with fury in all parts of London, plundered, butchered, and, where resistance was made, set fire to the houses. Notwithstanding a ju dicial injury by order of the king, very few were punissied for these atrocious acts ; and a spirit of Jewissi depredation and massacre was excited in most other towns, by the example of the metropolis, in the spring of the following year. In York five hun dred of the devoted race, with their families, took refuge in the castle, where, besieged by the mob, and utterly refused mercy, they, in a paroxism of despair, put to death their own wives and children, threw the dead bodies over the walls on their inhu man persecutors, and, setting fire to the buildings, ended their lives by suicide. Among the perpetrators of these enormities, of^ccc\u00b0n\u2122\"nt which clerical writers have recorded their approha- o!fhe cru- tion> 1190."], [484, "HISTORY OF THE 460 Chap XX. tion, were men enlisted for the holy war, by which they were at once exempted from spiritual and tem poral punissiment. To raise money for the support of a mighty expedition to a region so remote, in an age when, from the low state of commerce and the total want of public credit, a treasure adequate to the whole expense was necessary to be carried with the armament, Richard made no scruple at any means within his power. He set to sale the royal manors and revenues ; all offices under the crown, even that of chief justiciary; and, under papal au thority, dispensations from the performance of their vow to all those champions of the cross who repent ed of their engagement. For the trifling sum of ten thousand marks, not much exceeding a hundred thousand pounds of our present money, he relin quissied to the Scots the fortresses of Roxburg and Berwick, and released the kingdom of Scotland from its feudal subjection to the Englissi crown, the no blest acquisition of his father's reign. He declared that he would sell even the city of London, if he could find a purchaser. By menaces or persuasion was money exacted from persons of all ranks ; as the price of impunity, where guilt was with truth or falsehood imputed ; as a loan from the rich of un impeached character. A store of ninety thousand pounds, equivalent to above a million of our money now, left in the treasury by the late king, contri buted to swell the congeries of wealth, of which the kingdom was deprived by this romantic enterprise. Conjointly in the fame crusade with Richard was Philip Augustus, king of France, engaged. In the June"], [485, "BRITISH ILANDS. 461 Chap XX. June of 1190, these two monarchs, .the only two of France and England, who have ever fought un der the fame banners, assembled their troops, the flower of their kingdoms, amounting to a hundred thousand, in the plain of Vezelay, on the borders of Burgundy. Hence marching in conjunction to Lyons, they thence took separate roads, each to meet his navy, Richard to Marseilles, Philip to Genoa. In the following September they again formed a junction, arriving with their armaments at Messina in Sicily, where they fixed their quarters till the en suing spring. Here various causes of discord oc curred between the two monarchs, which afterwards operated to the frustration of their enterprise. Tan cred, king of Naples and Sicily by usurpation, had imprisoned Joanna, sister of Richard, and widow of the late king. To appease the Englissi prince he liberated the queen dowager, and agreed to pay forty thousand ounces of gold, not less in value than two hundred thousand pounds of our money at this time; but, from fear or hatred, he endeavoured to involve him in enmity with others. Elence the citizens of Messina quarrelled with the Englissi troops : the lat ter entered the town by storm : and Richard un wisely, in token of conquest, planted his standards on the walls? without consideration of Philip's royal dignity, who was lodged within them. By the re moval of these ensigns an immediate rupture was prevented, but the offense was not forgotten ; and the dissenticn was heightened by the machinations of Tancred, who informed Richard that the French monarch had proposed a plot for the destruction of the"], [486, "HISTORY OF THE 462 Chap, the Englissi army. But that which wounded most deeply the mind of Philip was the absolute refusal of Richard to fulfil his engagement of marriage with the princess Adelais. His con- In excuse for this breach of contract Richard is Cypru\". said to have offered to produce proofs of her having 1191. been pregnant by his father. How great soever may have been Philip's resentment, he suppressed it for the present, and consented to the marriage of the Englissi monarch with Berengaria, daughter of San chez, king of Navarre. Having in appearance ac commodated all differences for the prosecution of their great object, the two monarchs at length set fail for the Syrian coast in 1191, Richard on the tenth of April, some days later than his royal asso ciate. The Englissi fleet was dispersed by a tempest, and some of its vessels were wrecked on the ssiores of Cyprus, where Isaac, a contemptible tyrant, king of the iland, plundered the ships, and imprisoned the surviving part of their crews. When to a modest demand of the restitution of persons and effects, with which the Englissi prince, hastening to his place of destination, would have been satisfied, an inso lent refusal was returned, the troops were debarked ; Isaac was twice defeated ; himself and his only child, a beautiful daughter, were captured ; and the whole iland submitted. Having appointed governors, and solemnized his marriage with Berengaria, the victo rious king proceeded on his voyage, and arrived about the eighth of June in the port of Acre. \"!syri_'.';t3 Saladin had, after. his conquest of Jerusalem, been ngi. repulsed from Tyre by a garrison reinforced from 1102 i^ * \" Europe."], [487, "403 Chap XX BRITISH ILANDS. Europe. Afterwards, by successive reinforcements, the Franks at this post had become so numerous as v to act offensively by laying siege to the maritime city of Acre or Aeon, the ancient Ptolemais. Saladin, with a formidable host, besieged the besiegers, and strained every nerve by night and by day for the re lief of the garrison. \" Never,\" says Gibbon, \" did the flame of enthusiasm burn with a fiercer and more destructive rage,\" which here \" consumed in a nar row space the forces of Europe and Asia. Nine battles, not unworthy of the name, were fought in the neighbourhood of mount Carmel, with such vi cissitude of fortune that, in one attack, the sultan forced his way into the city ; that, in one sally, the christians penetrated to the royal tent.\" The place of those who perissied was supplied by fressi num bers, who poured from the west into the christian camp, from the east into that of the mohammedans and the town. On the arrival of Philip and Richard, rivals for fame, with rival armies, ardent to surpass each other in deeds of arms, the siege, which had continued two years, was pressed with redoubled fury. Reduced to extremity the defenders of Acre at length surrendered on the twelfth of July, stipu lating to pay for their lives and liberty two hundred thousand pieces of gold called byzants, and to pro cure the restoration of two thousand christian cap tives, and of what was called the wood of the true cross, which had fallen into the hands of the moham medans at the battle of Tiberias, imagined to have been the fame on which Christ had suffered. In the words"], [488, "41.4 Chap, XX HISTORY OF THE words of Gibbon, \" some doubts in the agreement, and some delay in the execution, re-kindled the fury of the Franks, and three thousand Moslems, almost in the sultan's view, were beheaded by the command of the sanguinary Richard,\" a command obeyed with ferocious alacrity by the Englissi soldiers. On the conclusion of this memorable siege, in which three hundred thousand christians were con sumed, Philip Augustus, deserting the crusade, re turned to France, leaving behind him a body of ten thousand under the command of the duke of Bur gundy. He was \" weary of sacrificing his health and interest on a barren coast ;\" and his pride was wounded in seeing himself surpassed in renown of arms, and splendour of riches, by the king of Eng land, his inferior in dignity, who had given him such causes of displeasure. The host of crusaders had been divided by the rivalry of the two monarchs, who had espoused opposite factions, one of which insisted on the right of Guy of Lusignan, the other on that of Conrade of Montferrat, to the crown of Jerusalem. The competition was at length termi nated by the voice of the majority against Guy, to whom Richard, his protector, bestowed the king dom of Cyprus. The further proceedings of the crusading army for the recovery of Palestine,' when the chief command was relinquissied to the Englissi monarch, is best related in the sifty-ninth chapter of the admirable historian already quoted. \" A march of one hundred miles, from Acre to Ascalon, was a great and perpetual battle of eleven days. In the disofdei of his troops, Saladin re- mained"], [489, "BRITISH ILANDS. 465 pained in the field with seventeen guards, without Chap. lowering his standard, or suspending the sound of his brazen kettle-drum : he again rallied and renewed the charge ; and his preachers or heralds called aloud on the Unitarians manfully to stand up against the chris- tian idolaters. But the progress of these idolaters was irresistible : and it was only by demolissiing the walls and buildings of Ascalon, that the sultan could prevent them from occupying an important fortress \u25a0 on the borders of Egypt. During a severe winter the armies slept ; but in the spring the Franks ad- vanced within a day's march of Jerusalem, under the leading standard of the Englissi king ; and his active spirit intercepted a convoy or caravan of seven thou- sand camels. Saladin had fixed his station in the holy city ; but the city was struck with consternation and discord : he fasted ; he prayed ; he preached ; he offered to ssiare the dangers of the siege ; but his Mamalukes, who remembered the fate of their com- panions at Acre, pressed the sultan, with loyal or seditious clamours, to reserve his person and their courage for the future defense of the religion and empire. The Moslems were delivered by the sud- den, or, as they deemed, miraculous, retreat of the christians ; and the laurels of Richard were blasted by the prudence or envy of his companions. The hero, ascending a hill, and veiling his face, exclaim ed with an indignant voice, * those, who are unwil ling to rescue, are unworthy to view, the sepulchre of Christ.' After his return to Acre, on the news that Jaffa was surprised by the sultan, he sailed with some merchant vessels, and leaped foremost on the beach ; Vol. I. H h the"], [490, "HISTORY OF THE 466 Chap XX ' , ' the castle was relieved by his presence ; and sixty thousand Turks and Saracens fled before his arms. , The discovery of his weakness provoked them to re turn in the morning ; and they found him carelessly encamped before the gates, with only seventeen knights and three hundred archers. Without count ing their numbers, he sustained their charge ; and we learn from the evidence of his enemies, that the king of England, grasping his lance, rode furiously along their front, from the right to the left wing, without meeting an adversary who dared to encoun ter his career. Am I writing the history of Orlando or Amadis ?\" \" During these hostilities a languid and tedious ne gociation, between the Franks and Moslems, was start ed and continued, and broken, and again resumed, and again broken. Some acts of royal courtesy, the gift of snow and fruit, the exchange of Norway hawks and Arabian horses, softened the asperity of religious war. From the vicissitude of success, the monarchs might learn to suspect that Heaven was neuter in the quarrel ; nor, after the trial of each other, could either hope for a decisive victory. The health both of Richard and Saladin appeared to be in a declining state ; and they respectively suffered the evils of distant and domestic warfare. Plantagenet was impatient to punissi a perfidious rival who had invaded Normandy in his absence ; and the indefa tigable sultan was subdued by the cries of the people, who was the victim, and of the soldiers, who were the instruments, of his martial zeal. The final agreement was equally disapproved by the zealots of"], [491, "BRITISH ILANDS. 467 of both parties, by the Roman pontiff and the calif of Bagdad. It was stipulated that Jerusalem and the holy sepulchre ssiould be open, without tribute or vexation, to the pilgrimage of the Latin chris- tians : that, after the demolition of Ascalon, they ssiould inclusively possess the sea-coast from Jaffa to Tyre: that the count of Tripoli and the prince of Antioch ssiould be comprised in the truce ; and that, during three years and three months, all hostilities ssiould cease. The principal chiefs of the two ar- mies swore to the observance of the treaty; but the monarchs were satisfied with giving their word and their right hand; and the royal majesty was excused from an oath, which always implies some suspicion of falsehood or dissionour.\" In the accounts of the war between these two most martial princes, of whom Saladin was the superior in civilization and humanity, a surprising agreement is found between the moham- medan and christian writers, who mutually praise the virtues of their enemies. The chief of the for mer is Bohadin in his Life of Saladin; of the latter is Vinisauf in his Itinerary or Journal of king Richard Chap. , _. and others. To Richard, whose retreat from Palestine seems His chara.- partly to have been caused by the exigence of his affairs in Europe, partly by the envy or weariness of his allies urging a return, we can in history find very few equals in that species of heroism which con sists in a brutal and ferocious valour. His memory at the distance of sixty years \" was celebrated,\" fays Gibbon, \" in proverbial sayings by the grandsons of the Turks and Saracens against whom he had H h 2 fought ;"], [492, "HISTORY OF THE 468 Chap. XX. fought : his tremendous name was employed by the Syrian mothers to silence their infants ; and if a horse suddenly started from the way, his rider was v/ont to exclaim, ' dost thou think that king Richard is in thatbussi?\" To his.v ordinary appellation of Richard Plantagenet was fuperadded by the French the sur name of C\u0153ur de lion, heart of lion, from the popu lar, but erroneous, idea, that the lion is the most courageous of quadrupeds. This formidable war rior was tall, straight, handsome, and athletic, ma jestic in mein, with yellowissi hair, blue and brilliant eyes. Endowed by nature with an excellent under standing, little improved by culture, of directed by judgment, he possessed high talents for military con duct, a manly eloquence, an uncommon penetration, a facetious humour, and quickness of repartee. To a preacher, who exhorted him to part with his three favourite daughters, his pride, avarice, and voluptuousness, he replied, that he would give them to those who loved them most dearly, the first to the knights templars, the second to the benedictines, and the third to the prelates. \" Of an impetuous and vehement spirit;\" fays Hume, \" he was distin guished by all the good, as well as the bad qualities, which are incident to that character. He was open, frank, generous, and brave : he was revengeful, do- mineering, ambitious, haughty, and cruel : and was thus better calculated to dazzle men by the splen- dour of his enterprises, than either to promote their happiness, or his own grandeur, by a sound and well regulated policy.\" By the tyranny of his temper and the licentiousness of his manners his wife was a sufferer :"], [493, "BRITISH ILANDS. 469 sufferer : by his enormous rapacity, proportioned to Chap. his profusion, his subjects were most miserably op pressed : yet, from the transcendent glory of his mi litary exploits, his memory was long dear to the Englissi ; and, as his father was the first prince of the Norman line who treated these with impartial fa vour, so is himself accounted the first who loved them with sincere affection. By his contumelious pride was occasioned to this His eapti monarch a long captivity ; and, some years after, by v' y' his ferocious resentment, a premature grave. Hav- 1194. ing embarked at Acre, in the October of 1192, to return with all speed to his dominions, he was ssiip wrecked near Aquileia, and attempted to pass through Germany in the disguise of a pilgrim. Betrayed by his own imprudence, particularly by the retaining of a ring on his finger, which revealed the great su periority of his rank over that of a mean pilgrim, he was seized by Leopold, duke of Austria, who, to gratify at once his avarice and revenge, threw him into a dungeon, loaded with irons, with a design not to liberate him without a great ransom. A standard, erected by the duke, on a towe'r taken by assault in the siege of Acre, had, by the command of Richard, who considered its erection by an inferior general as presumptuous, been dragged to the ground, and con temptuously trampled under foot. By Leopold, who had thus been rendered his inveterate foe, Richard was delivered, on the promise of a great sum, into the hands of another foe not less sordid, the emperor of Germany, Henry the sixth, who produced him -as a criminal, in the July of n 93, before the diet, or"], [494, "HISTORY OF THE 470 Chap XX Assairs of England.

Conrade had been murdered\" by two desperadoes, said to have been instigated by a Syrian chief near Antioch, styled by misconcep tion the Old ?nan of the Mountain or prince of the assassins. Of any participation in this crime Richard was most probablv innocent. Having premised that, as a sovereign prince, he was accountable to no hu man tribunal, he made so able a defense in vindica tion of his character, as to interest in his favour the members of the diet. The emperor was intimidated!, and at length consented to his release on a specified ransome. The news of the king's captivity caused astonifli- ment in England, where affairs by his absence had been already much disordered. At his departure in the crusade, he had left the administration in the hands of two bissiops, Hugh of Durham and Long champ of Ely. The latter, a Frenchman of mean birth, who had risen by mean arts, actuated by the violent arrogance congenial to such a character, forced his colleague, by imprisonment, to the re signation of his castles with his authority, and, vest- ed"], [495, "BRITISH ILANDS. 471 Chap, XX Hostile act, of Philip. 1IQ2 1194, ed with the commission of pope's legate, exercised with despotic insolence all the powers of the state, ecclesiastical and civil. Relying on a long ab sence of P.ichard, he obeyed not his commands transmitted from abroad, alleging his own superior knowledge of the secret intentions of his master. Accompanied by a guard of fifteen hundred foreign soldiers, he rendered himself so formidable, that a council of five, nominated by royal commission to control his authority, dared not to ssiew their war rant. When at length by his order, Geoffry, arch bissiop of York, natural brother of the king, was dragged to prison out of a church in which he had taken refuge, such a ferment was excited by the breach of ecclesiastical privileges, that prince John was encouraged to convene a great council, and to summon Longchamp to appear before it. Appre hensive of danger, the imperious bissiop retired into the tower of London, and thence, when besieged, into France in the October of 1 191. In virtue of the formerly concealed commission, the government was administered, with the advice of his colleagues, by the Wise and virtuous Walter, archbissiop of Rouen, who found enough of employment in pro tecting the dominions of his master against foreign and domestic enemies. Provident, interested, and fraudulent, Philip Au gustus, who had on so many accounts conceived re sentment against Richard, seems to have resolved, at his departure from the crusade, to take every pos sible advantage of that monarch's absence. At Rome, in his journey homeward, he complained to the pope of"], [496, "HISTORY OF THE 472 Chap XX Liberation as Richard, 1194, of injuries from the Englissi king, and solicited abso lution for the oath which he had taken not to invade that prince's dominions until after he ssiould have returned to them from Asia. Though his petition was rejected, he persevered in his design ; but his barons, who had taken the fame oath, refused to concur with him in its violation. By intrigues he gained prince John to his interest, on which king Richard, in the hopes of securing by gratitude his fraternal affection, had conferred such vast estates, as enabled him to become his dangerous enemy. John was at first intimidated by the Englissi council, and queen Eleanor, his mother ; but, on the news of the king's imprisonment, Philip redoubled his efforts ; and, by trumpeting the calumnious charge of Conrade's murder, prevailed on his barons to join him in the invasion of Normandy ; while, in England, -John seized the castles of Windsor and Wallingford, and, repairing to London, claimed the crown, as heir to his brother Richard, whom he positively affirmed to have died in confinement.

As Flenry was somewhat awed by Chap. YY the princes of the empire, these offers, though they , j,_ :,'-. 3, retarded, prevented not finally the liberation of Richard, who arrived in England in the March of 1 1 94, after an absence of above four years and a quarter. His ransome was a hundred and fifty thou sand marks of silver, according to the standard of Cologne, perhaps equal in efficient value to more than a million and a half of our pounds at present, of which two-thirds were paid at the instant, and for security of the rest sixty-seven hostages were sent. By taxes and voluntary contributions, particularly a gift of thirty thousand marks in the plate of churches and monasteries, were two-thirds with difficulty rais ed from an exhausted country : but the remaining third was never paid : for, in the beginning of the next year, duke Leopold, mortally bruised by a fall in a tournament, conceived such remorse, that by testament he remitted the debt, and ordered the re lease of the hostages ; to the fulfilment of which his successor was compelled by the menaces of the cler gy, with the approbation of the emperor, who at that time courted the alliance of England against France. On the news of Richard's liberation Philip wrote His hostiU thus to prince John ; \" take care of yourself '-: the De- France'. vil has broken loose.\" Having caused himself to be 1194. crowned anew, as if to efface the ignominy of his 119!? imprisonment, and having reduced the fortresses in the hands of John's adherents, the Englissi monarch passed into France, with his forces, in the May of 1194. The prince, his brother, finding his ma- chinations"], [498, "HISTORY OF THE 474 Chap XX chinations against him frustrated, fell on his knees before him, and was received into favour, at the in tercession of Eleanor, to whom the king said, \" I hope I shall as easily forget his injuries as he will my pardon.\" From so mighty a warrior, so incensed against Philip, a terrible storm of war might have been expected to burst on France : but Richard, with impoverissied finances, with feudal troops un der little obedience, and little interested in the cause, was unable to gain any decisive advantage over his active and politic antagonist. The weakness indeed of the feudal system appears in the feeble operations of both these monarchs, who, though remarkable for personal vigour, and so violently animated with mutual resentment as frequently to inflict on their prisoners the cruel deprivation of sight, performed no other than unimportant acts, ssiirmissies and sieges of castles, unworthy of a place in history. Their hostilities, with intervals of truce, or pacific treaties, ill-observed, and soon broken, continued five years. In a battle between two bodies of their cavalry, the cartulary of Philip, which in that age attended every where the monarch's person, was taken by the Englissi, with valuable records, the loss of which to their history is lamented by French writers.

He was a lawyer of profligate manners, but eloquent, audacious, and plausible, who, by defending the poorer sort on all occasions, and declaiming against their oppressions, a theme doubtless of too ample matter, had become so popu lar among the lower classes, that they styled him the Saviour of the people, and some thousands were asso ciated by oath to obey his commands. Numerous outrages were committed in London by his mob of \u2022adherents, murders in the streets, and house break ings in the day. Summoned by primate Hubert, the chief justiciary, to account for his conduct before the council, he came attended with such a multitude, that the council was intimidated, and he returned in triumph. But Hubert, some time after, watching an opportunity, succeeded in an attempt to seize his person in the church of Saint Mary le Bow, into which he had retired for defense. The populace deeply regretted his death, stole his gibbet, paid the fame veneration to it as the cross, and zealously pro pagated stories of miracles performed by it : but the credit of these, unsupported by the clergy, in a ssiort time vanissied. A dreadful pestilence in Upgland, in the year Death ot 1 198,* the consequence of a famine, contributed much"], [500, "HISTORY OF THE 476 Chap XX. much to weaken the martial operations of Richard in France. The princess Adelais, so long unjustly detained, had, in one of his truces with Philip, been delivered to her brother, who gave her in mar riage to the earl of Ponthieu. In another truce, by the mediation of the pope, for the purpose of a new crusade, a negociation for a final peace was begun, when death arrested the Englissi monarch. The whole of a treasure, of which the finder was unwill ing to surrender more than a part, found on the lands of Vidomar, viscount of Limoges, was demanded, as the property of the superior lord, by Richard, who, to enforce his claim, besieged, with a body of Braban ters, the castle of Chalus. To the garrison, who offer ed to yield all except their lives, he sternly refused a capitulation, declaring his determined purpose of storming the fortress, and of hanging all found in it. Approaching to take a survey previous to the assault, he received an arrow in the left ssioulder from Bertram Gordon, or de Gourdon, an archer on the battlements. By the unssiilfulness of the surgeon the wound proved mortal. He expired in the April of 1 1 99, in the forty-second year of his age, after a reign of nine years and nine months, of which he spent little more than six months in England. He had succeeded in the assault, and had hanged all the gar rison, except the fatal bowman, whom he reserved for a more cruel punissiment. To his questidn to the prisoner, why he had sought to deprive him of life ? Bertram answered with inflexible courage ; \" you have killed my father and brother with your own hand, and you -have designed to put me to an ignominious"], [501, "BRITISH ILANDS. 477 Chap XX \u00ab ; \\ ignominious death. I am ready to suffer all the tor ments which you can inflict ; and I rejoice in pro curing by the sacrifice of my body the riddance of the world from such a monster.\" Struck with the force of his reply, and humbled by the sense of in evitably approaching death, Richard commanded the captive to be set at liberty, and a sum of money to be given him : but, in violation of these orders, Marcadee, the ruffian leader of the mercenary Flem ings, caused him to be flayed alive and hanged.

I consider the researches of Mr. Chalmer's as highly meritorious, but the subject not cleared by him from difficul ties. As I have not .room here for discussion, I shall only at present propose two or three questions, and make two or three remarks. Were the transactions of barbarous na tions so accurately registered, that no mi grations of Gothic tribes could have hap- b pened"], [506, "C ii 1 pened unrecorded in history ? Has Tacitus given us false information in explicitly af firming, that the red hair and other cha racteristics of the ancient Caledonians denot ed their descent from German ancestors ? The other characteristics he has elsewhere marked, particularly in his treatise of Ger many, grey or blue eyes, a fair complexion, and large limbs. If the ancient Caledo nians bore these characteristics, and were also Celts, why are all the people of Celtic ancestry at this day of a very different description, as the genuine Welch, and the genuine tribes of Irish and Highlanders ? In the beginning of the third chapter of his second book, Mr. Chalmers fays, \" that the Celtic and Gothic languages had a common origin ; and it is therefore absurd to talk of the Gaelic, a Celtic lan guage, being mixed with Gothic words.\" Yet in the next chapter he admits, that of two branches of the Gothic, the German and' Swedish, (the Belgic and Scandinavian) the"], [507, "[ iii ] the former has in it a large mixture of Celtic, the latter none. How will he ac count for this if the Gothic and Celtic have a common origin ? In the first chapter of the fame book he fays that \" the context of Tacitus attests, that the Britons of North and South-Britain were, in that age the fame people.\" Yet Tacitus, in his lise of Agricola, certainly describes the Silures of Wales, (doubtless a Celtic people) as totally different in personal characteristics from the Caledonians of the north. In stating these remarks I have no design to depreciate the work of Mr. Chalmers : but, without satisfaction in these matters, I cannot think his object attained, the re moval of all doubts on the subject of the early British population. I may also observe that identity of language is not always, as he thinks, a proof of identity of blood. The modern languages of Spain and France are derived from the Latin; but will any one assert that the Spaniards and French are the b descendants"], [508, "[ iv ] descendants of the Romans ? Subject many ages to the immediate government of Ro man magistrates and Roman armies, and acquainted with no other language than the Latin in the administration of justice, in schools, or in books, these nations gradually adopted that language, as their vernacular speech, to the exclusion of their ancient dialects. In like manner the use of the Erse, or Irish tongue, is declining rapidly in Ireland. Great numbers at this day, whose grand-fathers, and even fathers, could speak only Irish, are acquainted with no other than the English tongue. Mr. Chalmers has incidentally expressed an opinion, not relating to the subject of British colonization, in several places in the third chapter of his first book, that the Roman weapons, as swords, axes, heads of spears and javelins, were made of brass, even long after the commencement of the Christian era. This appears so strange to me, accustomed to fee ferrum in Classic writers"], [509, "[ v ] writers put by metonymy for military wea pons, that I am very curious to know how he can support this opinion. I have also seen the letters of Doctor Mil ner from Ireland, in which the writer, a gentleman of supreme credulity, real or pre tended, not only in sacred fables, but even in profane, has laboured to prove the exist ence of Saint Patrick, a missioner of astonish ing prowess, by whose miraculous preaching the whole population of Ireland was at once converted from the delusions of idolatry to the true papal faith. How the creed of any church can be affected by the question con cerning such an apostolic Hercules I confess myself unable to discern, though the doctor seems to have, in his own opinion, a clear view of the affair. He affirms the existence of Saint Patrick to be as certain as that of Romulus. This indeed I am not at all un willing to admit. The learned among the Romans rejected the latter as is seen in Ci cero de Legibus; and I must confess that I b a have"], [510, "[ vi ] have had the audacity to entertain strong doubts concerning the former, long before the publication of Ledwich's Antiquities, of which I have had also the unpardonable pre sumption of approving. Leai'ing the honour os maintaining the controversy against Doc tor Milner to gentlemen doubtless numerous, who are superior to me as well in the favour of the great as in learning, if any of these will dare, or deign, to encounter a champion who marshals under his banner so numerous a host of legendary names, interpolated books, and forged authorilies, I shall only at present say, that I sincerely wish for a total abolition of political distinctions between protestants and catholics in the British empire, from a consi deration of justice, and its inseparable adhe rent, sound policy; and that, though Doctor Milner's work seems far more calculated to obstruct than to accelerate the attainment of this object, yet I think that it ought not to be withheld one moment on account of the sacerdotal quixotism os any individual, which superior"], [511, "[ vii ] superior catholics, in case of liberal treat ment from the legislature, must soon learn to despise. To acknowledge my own faults may per* haps be more expedient than to make observa- tions on the writings of others. I find two trifling errors in my history of Ireland into which 1 have been led by my neglect, in seme instances, of bringing the accuracy of Leland to the proof. That these have escaped the notice of a certain northern reviewer is not at all surprising, as his object was not critical investigation, but invective. His unworthy motive is not unknown in Ireland. I am really very sorry that such motives are allowed to have influ- ence in the Edinburg review, which, notwith- standing some inconsistencies and unfair criti- cisms, appears to me the best periodical work hitherto published for directing the public judgment in politics and other subjects of national concern.

B cond,"], [524, "5 Chap XXI His charac. ter HISTORY OF THE cond, the heir of all his dominions. From Eng land, into which he had hasted, and where he had secured his establishment on the throne without op position, John speedily returned to France to oppose king Philip, who had confederated with the barons of Anjou, and some other provinces under the Eng lish monarchy, to support the right of duke Arthur to the succession. Hostilities soon terminated, as Conflanria, the mother of Arthur, a prince only twelve years old, fearing sinister designs in the French monarch, put her son into the hands of the English king, his uncle, to whom in consequence were sur rendered the revolted provinces. By an advantage ous peace with Philip, John saw himself undisputed master of all his predecessor's dominions, and might with a moderate share of prudence, have continued to hold a respectable station among the potentates of Europe : but, by his baseness of mind, he soon in volved himself in troubles, and rendered his reign one of the most disgraceful on record. From his conduct toward Richard, as related in the foregoing chapter, no favourable opinion could be formed of king John. His personal appearance, as he was tall, well shaped, and of an agreeable aspect, differed much from his mental character ; since, even if his transactions with foreign poten tates had not been disgraceful, he possessed no one quality which would have exempted him from the disgust and scorn of his own subjects. In the words of Hume, \" the character of this prince is nothing but a complication of vices, equally mean and odi ous, ruinous to himself, and destiuctiveto his peo- ple;"], [525, "BRITISH ILANDS. 3 pie ; cowardice, inactivity, folly, levity, licentious- Chap. ness, ingratitude, treachery, tyranny, and cruelty : all these qualities too evidently appear in the several incidents of his life, to give us room to suspect that the disagreeable picture has been anywise overcharged by the prejudice of the ancient historians \" Doubt less in these historians, who were churchmen, we could expect no partiality favourable to this mon arch, who had grievous quarrels with the church, and who in conversation was uncommonly profane. Of expressions of this nature the following instance is recorded, offensive by its allusion to the corpulence of the priests. Having, one day, caught a very fat stag, he exclaimed, \" how plump is this animal ! yet I dare swear he has never heard mass.\" To raise odium against him his licentious amours contributed much. An occurrence of this kind, in the begin ning of his reign, involved him in a war attended with important consequences. Isabella, daughter and heiress of Aymar Talllefer, Hls wsr. . &c. with count of Angouleme, had been married to Hugh le France Brun, count of la Marche ; but, on account of her 1200. immature age, her marriage had not been consum- mated, when king John, smitten by her charms, and finding no other means of indulging his desire, took her to wife, with her father's concurrence, re pudiating on pretence of consanguinity, his queen Avisa, who had brought him great estates, particu larly the earldom of Glocester. Enraged against rhe Englissi monarch, and hoping the support of Philip Augustus, the count of la Marche was active to in flame the discontents of the nobles, and, in thefol- B 2 lowing"], [526, "HISTORY OF- THE 4 Chap LS.XI ]_\u25a0. lowing year, 1201, excited commotions in Norman dyand Poictou. Vvhh forces levied with some dif ficulty in England, where his arbitrary conduct had already given much offense, John advanced against the revolted barons, who, finding themselves over powered, appealed for redress of grievances, in a judicial manner, to Philip, their feudal sovereign. His evasions in this business exposed at once his per fidy and weakness to Philip, who invaded the Nor man territories, and made a rapid progress, till an incident seemed to turn the balance in favour of his rival. Duke Arthur of Brittany, who, stem fears too well grounded, had fled from his uncle's power, now entered, at the age of sixteen, into a league with Philip, and married his daughter Mary. In an at tempt to capture his grandmother, queen Eleanor, his enemy, in the castle of Mirabel :n Poictou, this young prince was suddenly surrounded by the army of John, and made prisoner, together with the count of la Marche, and the rest of the most con siderable among the revolted barons. This extraordi nary occurrence, which caused Philip to retreat in consternation, and which, by a prudent use of it, might have proved of vast advantage to the English king, was abustfd to his unspeakable disgrace and detriment. Arthur was murdered, with circum stances not certainly known, but most probably by Lis uncle's own hand : his sister Eleanor, called the damsel of Brittany, heiress of that dutchy on Ar thur's death, was carried into England, where ssie was immured for life in prison : and the captured nobles"], [527, "BRITISH I LAND... i> nobles were so cruelly treated, that most of them perilbed in confinement, particularly twenty-two, the chief in rank or bravery, who were starved to death in Corf castle. Indignation was excited in every quarter. The nobles of Brittany carried their complaints to Philip. That monarch summoned John in legal form to answer the accusation of the murder of his nephew, one of the principal vassals of the French crown ; and, on his non-appearance, passed on him a judicial sentence, pronouncing him guilty of felony and parricide, and adjudging him to the forfeiture of all his estates in France. Chap. XXI. Such a sentence in other circumstances would have been fruitless ; but Philip, fully sensible that the state of affairs was most favourable to his views, lost no time in availing himself of an opportunity so pro pitious. Aided by the defection of many of John's vassals, and, from the general odium against that monarch, unopposed by any of his own, he made so vigorous an invasion in 1203, that in two years he conquered the whole of the Norman dutchy, and thus re-united to the French crown, that most im portant fief, after a separation of almost three cen turies. In this career of the success of his foe, the Englissi monarch, after an abortive siege of Alencon, where he lost his camp and baggage, spent his time in amusements at Rouen, whence, uttering vain me naces, he fled into England. The Normans, though abandoned by their lord, and weakened by the de sertion of many of their barons, made a brave re sistance from hatred to the French, from whom they then regarded themselves as a quite distinct people. His expul sion from Normandy, &c. 1203 1'iOd. Anjou,"], [528, "HISTORY OF THE 8 Anjou, Touraine, and Maire, yielded, with much less difficulty, to Philip's arms, with a great part of Poictou. Invited by a powerful interest to the pro tection of the last, John so far made exertions as to pass to Rochelle with a fleet in the July of 1206; but, after fruitless devastation, he reimbarked his troops, on the approach of Philip, and returned to England. By the mediation of the pope, who had before in vain attempted to arrest by menaces the progress of the French arms, a truce was made be tween John and Philip, when the former had lost all his transmarine territories, except Guienne, to the great aggrandisement of the French monarchy.

His quarrel with the Not only to Philip, who took a fair advantage to recover what had been separated from his kingdom, was a great opportunity afforded by the weakness of John, but also to the pope, who neglected not, in such a situation of affairs, to extend his usurped ju risdiction. By a slow gradation the bifliop of Rome had risen to surprising eminence. From being a de pendant on the volumary contributions of his flock, under the connivance of the pagan government, he had acquired a legal establishment, in the fourth century, under Constantine. Respectable from his seat in the great Roman metropolis, he became high er in authority, when he ceased to be eclipsed by the emperor's presence, on the removal of the seat of empire to Constantinople ; and higher still ; as he pope. 1207. 15.14. arrogated"], [529, "BRITISH ILANDS. 7 Chap XXI. arrogated to be the successor os saint Peter, when Rome became independent of the Greek empire. By territorial donations from the Prankish monarchs, Pepin and Charlemagne, in the eighth century, he became a temporal prince, the first in the christian system who united in his person the civil with the episcopal government. From being elected by the clergy, senate, nobles, and people, he was made eli gible exclusively by the college of cardinals by a de cree in 1059. To confirm the choice of the electors the approbation of the German emperor, as the suc cessor of the Roman emperors, was long necessary by establissied custom : but by a custom, which seemed also establissied by time, the pope was the officiating prelate in presenting the crown to the emperor at the ceremony of his coronation. Hence the pontiff claim ed a right of withholding, or conferring, the impe rial crown according to. his pleasure ; declared the emperor's confirmation of the papal election quite un necessary ; and, setting himself above the imperial dignity, assumed a power to depose the reigning em peror, and to raise another to his place. By no preceding pontiff had the papal claims been carried to a higher pitch than they were by John's contemporary, Innocent the third, who endeavoured to acquire a real domination over all the princes of Europe, by concentrating in himself, .and stretching to the utmost, the authority of ecclesiastics, whose encroachments on the civil power had already been enormous. Lie began early to invade tne preroga tive of this monarch, particularly by levying in Eng land, by his own sole authority, under the pretence of"], [530, "3 Chap.

On a vacancy in the fee of Canterbury, by the death of primate Hubert in 1 205, he found a pretext of a much great- er invasion. The monks of the cathedral, wissiing to monopolize the privilege of election, clandestine- ly chose Reginald, their subprior, and sent him pri- vately to Rome to solicit the confirmation of their choice. From vanity Reginald revealed in the Ne- therlands the purpose of his journey, contrary to prudence and his solemn engagements with his elec- tors. Scandalized at his levity, when the report arrived, and willing to avert the royal displeasure, the monks proceeded to a new election, and chose for primate on the king's recommendation, John de Gray, bissiop of Norwich. The suffragan bissiops of the province of Canterbury insisted on their right of participating in the choice of their metropolitan. The pope, to whom all parties appealed, pronounced ungrounded the claim of the suffragans ; annul- led, after a tedious and expensive litigation, the elections both of Reginald and Gray ; and compel- led, by the severest menaces, the deputies of the monks at Rome, contrary to rule, and to an oath which they had taken to the king, to elect cardinal Stephen Langton, whom he then consecrated arch bishop; John, to whom Innocent, in return for an import ant prerogative thus torn from him, sent a present of precious rings, with a fantastic letter describing their mysteries, was agitated with rage. He drove the"], [531, "*\u25a0 BRITISH ILANDS. 9 Chap, XXI the monks of Canterbury from his dominions, seiz ed their effects, and utterly disclaimed the new pri mate, who dared not to enter England. The pon tiff, on the failure of his admonitions to the king, pronounced on his kingdom the threatened sentence of interdict. The execution of this sentence, says Hume, who has elegantly described it, \" was artifi cially calculated to strike the senses in the highest degree, and to operate with irresistible force on the superstitious minds of the people. The nation was of a sudden deprived of all exterior exercise of its religion : the altars were despoiled of their orna ments : the crosses, the relics, the images, the sta tues of the saints were laid on the ground ; and, as if the air itself were profaned, and might pollute them by its contact, the priests carefully covered them up, even from their own approach and venera tion. The use of bells entirely ceased in all the churches : the bells themselves were removed from the steeples, and laid on the ground with the other sacred utensils. Mass was celebrated with ssiut doors ; and none but the priests were admitted to that holy institution. The laity partook of no religious rite, except baptism to newborn infants, and the commu nion to the dying. The dead were not interred in consecrated ground : they were thrown into ditches, or buried in common fields ; and their obsequies were not attended with prayers or any hallowed cere mony. Marriage was celebrated in the churchyards ; and that every action in life might bear the marks of this dreadful situation, the people were prohibited the use of meat, as in lent, or times of the highest penance ;"], [532, "HISTORY OF THE 10 Ch \u00bbp. XXi. ]_09 penance ; were debarred from all pleasures and en tertainments ; and were forbidden even to salute each other, or so much as to shave their beards, or give any decent attention to their persons or apparel. Every circumstance carried the symptoms of the deep est distress, and of the most immediate apprehension of divine vengeance and indignation.\" To the spiritual of the pope were opposed, with boisterous and unssiilful fury, the temporal arms of the king. From a dread of his violence many of the clergy continued to officiate, in disobedience to the interdict, but with the utmost reluctance, and under terrors of ecclesiastical punissiment. The rest fled the kingdom, or remained secluded from the public vieVv in their churches or convents. Their revenues were confiscated ; their persons exposed to injuries by the withdrawing of all protection from them of the civil power ; and, to add ridicule to dis tress, their concubines were thrown into prison, and not otherwise released than by the payment of heavy fines. These concubines were numerous, for since the celibacy of the clergy had, after a struggle of centuries, been now at length establissied, its substi tute, concubinage, was by connivance become very general. For the intimidation of malcontents an army was raised, and, on pretence of national dis putes, was led by the king to the borders of Scot land, where an accommodation was effected without a battle. But that alone, which he could reasonably expect to prove his bulwark against papal power, the affection of his people, was neglected by John, who reiterated grievous exactions, diihonoured the fami- lies"], [533, "BRITISH ILANDS. 11 Chap XXI Ex omm'j. nication 1210, lies of his nobles by his galantries, and raised uni versal hatred by cruelly enforcing the forest laws, and levelling the fences in the vicinity of many of his forests to give his deer a free access to the fields of corn. Depending on terrour alone, he obliged his barons to give hostages for their fidelity. William de Braofa, lord of Brecknock, whose wife unguard edly declared that her children should not be deliver ed into the hands of a man who had been the mur derer of his own nephew, fled from royal vengeance with his family into Ireland. Pursued in the follow ing year, he escaped thence into France : but his wife and children were taken, and are laid to have been starved to death in the castle of Bristol. Finding the Englissi monarch unsubdued by the in terdict, after a trial nearly of two years, Innocent proceeded to the next step in the scale of ecclesiasti cal censure, fulminating against him the sentence of excommunication. Though none of the clergy were hardy enough to publissi this in England with due formality, it soon became universally known ; and to prevent its effects the king still exerted the engine of terrour. Thus, when Geoffry, archdeacon of Norwich, one of the royal judges, retired from the bench of the exchequer, expressing his apprehensions of danger in acting under the authority of an ex communicated prince, he was thrown into prison, and treated with such cruelty, particularly by the pressure of a great leaden cope on his head, that he expired in a few days. Not more than three bissiops remained in the kingdom, and many of the nobles also privately withdrew. To guard himself by mili- tary"], [534, "HISTORY OF THE 12 tary force, the king, on pretence of commotions in Ireland, levied an army, chiefly by money extorted by acts of cruel violence from the jews, who, not withstanding the horrid massacre and plunder of their sect about twenty years before, had acquired opu lence again.

The next step of the pope was to absolve all his subjects from their oaths of allegiance, and to pronounce all excommunicated who ssiould have any intercourse with him. The consequences were soon felt by the king, who was terrified by the accounts of conspiracies formed against him ; but, as his humiliation was not yet complete, the dread ful sentence of deposition was at length proclaimed by Innocent, who declared him to have forfeited all right to the regal dignity. For the execution of this decree, the dethronement of the obnoxious monarch, the instrument selected was Philip Augus tus, to whom, in recompense of such service, the 1212. sentence of -ipoihion. s2 1 2. pontiff"], [535, "BRITISH ILANDS. jg pontiff transferred the forfeited kingdom of England, Chap. assuring him also of eternal felicity.

Collecting in his northern ports about seventeen hundred vessels of various magnitude, and a numerous army at Rouen, he prepared with ardour to acquire possession of the offered prize by a vigorous invasion ; while John, aroused by a sense of extreme peril, summoned all his vassals to Dover to oppose the enemy. Such a multitude of Englissi assembled to defend their coun try on this occasion, that after the dismission of great numbers, from an impossibility of procuring subsist ence for them all, not less than sixty thousand effec tive men remained. From this and other circum stances we may with probability suppose that, if John had been a man of a different character, amiable, brave, and politic, he might have securely defied all the vengeance of Rome, and emancipated his domi nions from papal thraldom. But, beside the horrours of superstition against a person designated by ecclesi astical condemnation, a hatred of his tyranny, and a total distrust of his courage and abilities, operated so powerfully, that many of his barons were suspect ed of having entered into private engagements with Philip, as the man most likely to be their future sove reign. In"], [536, "HISTORY OF THE 14 Chap XXI His sub. mission to the pope. 1213 His truce with France, 1214 In this crisis of affairs, Innocent, whose object was the aggrandizement, not of the French monarchy, but of the Roman see, sent Pandolph, his legate, to explain to John his desperate situation, and the con ditions on which he might obtain his pardon. The terrified monarch submitted, without reserve, to the papal dictates. He engaged, among other articles, to make ample reparation to all who had sustained any detriment by their adherence, in this contest, to the cause of Rome ; and to surrender his kingdoms of England and Ireland to the pope, under whom as his liege lord, he ssiould hold them in feudal subjec tion, and to whom he ssiould pay a yearly tribute of a thousand marks, seven hundred for England, three hundred for Ireland. To fulfil the ceremony of his submission he subscribed a charter in legal mode, and performed in the humblest manner the homage of a vassal. Unarmed, and on his knees, he swore feal ty, with his hands joined, and raised, and placed between the hands of the pope's representative, the legate, who sat proudly on a throne, and, in token of his master's dominion over the two surrendered kingdoms, trampled on the money which was laid at his feet as an earnest of tribute. Pandolph, returning to France, commended the holy zeal of Philip in arming with such alacrity in the cause of Christ's vicegerent ; and informed him that the object of all his pious preparations for war was now attained by the submission of John ; and that England, being now a fief of she apostolic fee, a part of Saint Peter's patrimony, could not be in vaded without incurring the guilt of sacrilege, and its"], [537, "!> Chap. XXI BRITISH ILANDS. its fatal consequences, the vengeance of the church. Enragedin finding himself duped into an undertaking of vast expense and trouble for the sole emolument of another person, Philip represented his case to his barons in so pathetic terms, that, except the earl of Flanders, who withdrew with his troops, declaring his abhorrence of impiety, they all vowed, or, seem ed inclined to vow, to attend him in the execution. of his enterprize, in spite of Pandolph's inhibition. Bat, while the French monarch, unwilling to leave behind him unsubdued a vassal so powerful and refrac tory, employed his army in the invasion of Flanders, and deferred for the present his Englissi expedition, the navy of England, which even then abounded in courageous mariners, assailed that of France, which unsupported by the land forces, was defeated, pur sued into the harbours, and mostly destroyed. Elated by a victory of such magnitude, though from it he could justly claim no personal merit, John instantly determined to transport his numerous troops to France for the recovery of his continental terri tories : but, from hatred, contempt, and distrust, his barons refused to follow him, alleging a want of provisions, and the expiration of the legal time of their service. In the vain expectation that they would be ashamed to stay behind their monarch mag nanimously exposing his person to the foe, he set sail with his household troops : but, finding, when he had arrived at Jersey, that they had dispersed to their estates, he returned with fury, and raised forces, chiefly foreigners to chastise them. By a threat of excommunication from Langton, the new primate, he"], [538, "HISTORY OF THE 16 Chap XXI 1214 His peace with the Church. 1214 he was obliged to relinquissi this design against his barons. He, however, in a ssiort time found an opportunity of indulging his ardour for an invasion of France. Encouraged by a vast confederacy formed against Philip, he carried an army to Poic tou in the February of 1214, and, in conjunction with the mal-content nobles in that quarter, gained possession of some towns ; but, on the approach of a force under prince Lewis, the son of Philip, he fled from the siege of a castle near Angiers, with the loss of all his tents and baggage. Philip had at this time given a mighty discomfiture to the Emper or Otho at the head of a hundred and fifty thousand Germans, at Bovines in the Netherlands ; a discomfi ture which establissied, with a glorious reputation to himself, the solid strength of the French monarchy. By the intelligence of this the fears of John were confirmed. He made a truce with his royal oppon ent, and returned to England in October. The King of England had previously to this expe dition almost completed his reconciliation with the apostolic see. The sentences against him were succes sively, in retrogade order, rescinded ; that of depo sition first, that of interdict last. He was absolved from excommunication on his imploring pardon, on his knees, with tears, from the exiled prelates, at their triumphal return with Langton at their head, and on his taking a new oath, in which he repeated his oath of fealty to the pope : but a new legate, Nicholas, sent in Pandolph's place, declared, that the interdict must remain until full reparation of damages ssiould have been made to the clergy. The estimates"], [539, "BRITISH ILANDS. 17 Chap XXI. t His contest with his barons. 1215 estimates of these, received by commissioners, were great beyond all possibility of payment. But the pope, to whom John passed a second charter of sub mission, more ample than the first, and sealed with gold, interposed in his favour, regardless of the clergy's losses, and declared forty thousand marks a reasonable composition for the whole. Whether more than a part of this sum, which was a very small part of the estimate, was ever paid, seems not quite cer tain ; but, except the members of the hierarchy, the sufferers in the papal cause remained unredreffed. The interdict was at length annulled, after a conti nuance of above six years and a quarter, in the June of 1 2 14, by the legate, whom, as well as the pope, the king had found means of alluring to his interest. Stephen Langton, though obtruded into the see of Canterbury by a papal usurpation on the royal prerogative of England, was a person of merit ade quate to such preferment, an Englissiman of an en larged understanding, and of a patriotism somewhat singular in ecclesiastics of those days. In the oath administered to John, preparatory to his absolution, this prelate had inserted a clause whereby the mo narch bound himself to re-establissi the good laws of his predecessors, particularly those of Edward the confessor. A charter, founded on these laws, had been granted to his subjects by Henry the first, re newed by Stephen, and confirmed by Henry the second ; but had remained a dead letter, and seems to have been almost forgotten in the time of John, whose tyranny to his people was not relaxed by his Vol. II. C abject"], [540, "Chap XXI. V_-\"-\\~s_^ HISTORY OF THE abject submission to the pope. Thus Peter of Pom fret, a fanatical hermit, who had prophesied that in the year 1213 this monarch would lose his crown, and had been imprisoned for his prediction, was, on the expiration of the time specified, commanded by the king to be punissied as an impostor. The cul prit, who aggravated the royal anger by pleading that his prophesy was fulfilled in the actual resigna tion of the sovereign crown of England to the Ro man pontiff, was doomed to the augmented agony of having his son hanged with him on the fame gibbet, after being dragged at horses tails to Ware ham. Langton, soon after the absolution of John, pro- duced the old charter of Henry the first in a private meeting of some barons in London, and exhorted them to insist on the restoration of their rights ac- cording to the king's oath. When a confederacy, thus formed, had become widely extended, he re- peated his exhortations to a much more numerous body, convened by him at St. Edmonsbury, under colour of devotion. Availing themselves of so sit an opportunity, the reign of a prince quite destitute of support from public affection, respect, or opinion of his firmness or capacity, the barons took a so- lemn oath of mutual adherence in an armed associa- tion for the enforcement of their claims. On the day appointed, the sixth of January in the year 1 2 15, they assembled in London and presented their petition. Notwithstanding the most respectful terms in which it was composed, the king was alarmed, and requested time till Easter for his return of an answer."], [541, "BRITISH ILANDS. 19 Chap XXI answer. To this they agreed, and retired peaceably to their castles. \u25a0 The interval was employed by John in seeking means of avoiding a compliance. To obtain the protection of the church, he passed a charter to the clergy, subversive of the royal preroga tive in the appointing of prelates : he took the cross under a vow to lead an army to Palestine : and he appealed to the pope against his mutinous nobles, who also sent an agent to plead their cause in Rome. Though they saw that the power of Innocent, who judged the king his fittest instrument for the retain ing of England under the papal dominion, would be exerted against them, the barons were undaunted, sensible of the general approbation of the Englissi clergy, who were disgusted with the despotic inso lence exercised over them by the pontiff and his legate. Assembling at Stamford a numerous army, in which were above two thousand knights, they advanced on the twenty-seventh of April to Brack ley, fifteen miles from Oxford, whence the king, who then resided in that city, sent to them to inquire what were particularly their demands. On receiv ing from them a schedule of the chief articles, he swore in a violent passion that he would never grant such liberties as would render himself a slave. Hav ing chosen for their general, Robert Fitzwalter, ltvled \" mareschal of the army of God and of the holy church,\" they assailed, but without success, the castle of Northampton ; seized that of Bedford; took possession of London ; issued proclamations , and laid waste the king's parks and palaces. De serted by the remaining nobles from real or affected C 2 fears,"], [542, "an Chap XXI. Magna Charta. 1215 HISTORY OF THE fears, and reduced to a contemptible retinue of only seven knights, the king, after a \"vain recourse to various expedients to elude the blow, agreed to a ronference, which commenced on the fifteenth of June, in the plain of Runnemede, between Windsor and Staines. Here, after a debate of four or five days, while the two parties lay encamped and guard ed in hostile form, a charter, containing the liberties of the nation, or the limitations of royal power, demanded by the barons, was, on the nineteenth, signed and sealed by the king, with great inward reluctance, but apparent facility. By this famous instrument, styled Magna Charta, or the Great Charter, were confirmed or granted to the clergy, nobility, and people, important privi leges, privileges much better understood, defined, and maintained in later times, and not necessary to be particularly stated in this place. To the clergy were secured the freedom of election independently of the royal prerogative, unrestrained appeals to Rome, and exemption from fines on their ecclesiasti cal benefices. \" The privileges,\" fays Hume, \" granted to the barons, were either abatements in the rigours of the feudal law, or determinations in points which had been left by that law, or had be come by practice, arbitrary or ambiguous.\" Thus, for instance, the reliefs, or fines, payable into the royal coffers by heirs for permission to enter into pos session of their estates, had long become arbitrary, and were often enormous : the guardianssiip of mi nors, a prerogative of the king, was by him sold or bestowed to men who, intent on their own emo- lument,"], [543, "21 BRITISH ILANDS.

By limitations of fines, and by other restrictions, provi sion was made in the great charter to obstruct the abuse of royal power in these and other cases. The liberties granted or restored by this charter to the citizens, burgesses, and other freemen dis tinct from the classes of clergy and great barons, appear to have been such as their ancestors had en joyed under the old Englissi laws, or customs, di gested by the Confessor. These, fays Hume, \" in volve all the chief outlines of a legal government, and provide for the equal distribution of justice, and free enjoyment of property ; the great objects which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor statute, nor positive institution, ought to deter rherr from keeping ever uppermost in their thought;; attention.\" We may observe that all the privileges and immunities granted to the baro^'- --\"rainst the king, we\u00bbe ordered to be extended by the barons to their inferior vassals ; but that concerning labourers in agriculture, numerous and in a state of slave one clause only v ihichwas also for the benefit of their n.. . t. hey aiousd not by any . b\u00bbe deprived ot cuv... i ....uments of husban- dry.'1 >set, though such an idea of national free dom as the emancipation of this unfortunate class was"], [544, "52 Chap XXI.

But, con vinced of the faithless and tyrannical disposition of John, they were obliged to adopt measures unconsti tutional and seemingly severe, to prevent his in fringement of those laws to which he had so reluc tantly assented. For this purpose they constrained him to agree to the election of twenty- five barons, conservators of the charter, empowered to redress every violation, and thus actually, though not in appearance, vested with the sovereign sway. Feigning acquiescence and a resolution of acting henceforward in conformity with the great charter, John was inwardly determined on its total rescis- sion, and on the severest vengeance against his ba- rons. Indignant and sullen, he retired into the He of Wight, where he spent three months in secret preparations for war, complaining to the pope against the violence of his subjects, and enlisting in his service. the foreign mercenaries called Brabanters, to whom he promised the spoils of England, with the estates of his rebellious nobility. With bulls from the pope annulling the great charter, absolving all- from their oaths respecting it, and excommu- nicating all who ssiould continue to acknowledge its legality, John arrived, in the September of 1215, at Dover, where he was joined by so numerous bands of mercenaries from the continent, that the barons, who had suffered themselves to be lulled into"], [545, "BRITISH ILANDS. 23 Chap XXI 1216 into a fatal security, were utterly unable to resist him. Having reduced the castle of Rochester by famine, in a siege of two months, and hanged the garrison, except the officers, he divided his forces, leaving one army to act in the southern parts, and marching with another in person to the northern. England now, through its whole extent, from Dover to Berwick, exhibited the fame kind of dismal scene as in the civil wars of Stephen, desolated with the most merciless fury by mercenary bands of rapacious foreigners, let loose to glut themselves with blood and plunder. The nation seemed threatened with a new conquest under French and Flemissi adven turers, the confiscation of its lands, and the ex tinction of its nobility, as in the time of William the first. In this desperate state the barons had recourse to a desperate expedient. They made a tender of the Englissi crown to Lewis, the eldest son of Philip Augustus, under a vague pretence that to this prince, who was married to a defcendant of Henry the se cond, had devolved the right which John had for feited by his resignation of his sovereignty to the pope, and by the judgment formerly pronounced against him by the peers of France on account of his nephew's murder. Having received twenty-five hostages, the sons of the chief Englissi nobles, for their fidelity to his son, Philip eagerly accepted the proposal, in spite of all the menaces of papal thun der, which had already been discharged against the Englissi barons, but with little success, as their cause was favoured by the clergy, particularly primate Langton,"], [546, "HISTORY OF THE 24 Chap XXI Death of John. 1216 Langton, who was on that account suspended and threatened with deposition. After the arrival of prince Lewis with his forces, who landed at Sand wich in the May of 1216, the balance quickly turned against king John. He was deserted by the greater part of his foreign troops, who, being natives of France, refused to fight against the son of their sovereign, and by a number of barons who had hitherto adhered to his cause; while his rival, having taken Rochester, and entered London amid the joyful acclamations of the citizens, gained pos session of all the south except the castle of Dover, whose garrison made a most obstinate defence. While prince Lewis was wasting his time in the unsuccessful siege of this fortress, distrust and dis content were operating to his disadvantage among the Englissi barons, his confederates, who observed a great partiality in Lewis in favour of his com patriots, and among whom a report was propagated, that the Viscount of Melun had, at the approach of death, revealed a secret intention of the prince to exterminate the Englissi nobiiity, and to confer their estates on Frenchmen, in whom he mio-ht more safely confide.

Vested with su preme authority, under the title of protector or regent, by another convention of nobles at Bristol, this great and honest baron exerted his abilities, by arms and conciliation, for the establissiment of the new reign. To secure the papal interest he had caused the young king, immediately on his corona tion, to perform homage and swear fealty, according to"], [549, "2? Chap.

In the follow ing year was granted a separate chapter concerning forests, abridging the extent of these royal nuisan ces, and substituting in place of capital punissiments, for ttespasses in them, fines and imprisonment. While by public acts of a conciliatory nature, and by private applications to individuals, Pembroke was making successful attempts to detach the mal- content barons from the party of Lewis, that prince, who still continued the siege of Dover castle, brought strong reinforcements from France to sup- port his claim. A French army under the count of Perche obliged the troops of the protector to re- treat from the siege of Mount-Sorrel ; advanced, elated with success, to Lincoln ; entered the city ; and invested the castle. Here, in the May of 12 17, assailed at once from without by an army collected by Pembroke, and from within by a sally of the garrison, the French were totally defeated, and their leader slain.

Though the menaces and censures of the sovereign pontiff prevented not the enterprize of Lewis, nor even retarded the progress of his arms, while for tune seemed propitious, they had yet manifestly an uifluence ; and, when the balance took a turn un favourable to the prince's party, they hastened its decline. Philip Augustus affected a disapprobation of his son's undertaking, and even refused to admit him to his presence, when he passed into France to solicit reinforcements . yet the troops, fleets, and supplies were as effectually collected in the name of the prince, and of the prince's consort, as they could have been in that of the king. This conduct could deceive none ; but, as Hume observes, who has displayed much judgement and elegance in this part of his Englissi history, \" in public affairs, men are often better pleased that the truth, though known to every body, ssiould be wrapped up under a decent cover, than if it were exposed in open day light to the eyes of all the world.\" The penal power of the pope, thus virtually acknowledged, even where it was opposed, accelerated desertion among the Englissi adherents of the prince, when, by"], [551, "BRITISH ILANDS. 29 Chap, XXII Internal disorders. 1219, 1224, by his reverse of fortune, they lost their hopes of his final success, and consequent ability of affording them protection. Pembroke, on the conclusion of his treaty of peace with Lewis, performed faithfully his engagements, reinstating the revolted nobles, and even receiving them into favour: but to protect from papal vengeance the clergy, who had disregarded the interdict and excommunication, fulminated against all the adherents of the prince, was beyond his pow er. Suspension, deprivation, or exile, was the lot of all who redeemed not themselves by heavy fines. Hence the legate deprived England of a vast mass of treasure. On the decease of Pembroke in 1219, the regency was committed to Peter de Roches, bissiop of Win chester, and Hubert de Burgh, high justiciary, who found themselves unable to retain in due subjection to the royal authority the licentious barons. The earl of Albemarle, the principle violator of the public peace, the depredator of the northern counties, was excommunicated by the legate, and was in conse quence of this, and of military preparations against him, forsaken by his adherents, was obliged to sub mit to mercy, was pardoned, and was restored to his whole estate. Such a stretch of lenity to such a culprit appears to have arisen from a combination among the barons, unwilling to permit any one of their order to be totally ruined.

Two escaped : the third was imprisoned and treated with great indignity. Unsupported and compelled to surrender, Fawkes was punissied by banissiment and the confiscation of his estates. Pre viously to this, in 1222, a more rigorous chastise ment had been inflicted on some citizens of London for a less premeditated offense, a riotous attack, in consequence of a wrestling match, on their neigh bours of Westminster, in which they made use of the French cry of war, an indication of their con tinued attachment to prince Lewis. Without a due form of trial, their leader, Constantine Fitzarnulf, was hanged, and many others mutilated, contrary to the great charter. After much violent opposition to the regents, and even attempts to seize London and the king's person, most of the refractory barons, intimidated by the menaces of the church, menaces often salutary in times of such turbulence, at length surrendered the royal castles to Henry, who, by a bull of the pope, at the instance of the regents, was declared to be fully of age for the personal exercise of all the rega! functions, though he was only sixteen years old. Not withstanding the weakness of domestic disquiet, means were found for the transportation of an army to France, where Lewis the eighth, on the death of his father, Philip Augustus, and, on a demand made by Henry of the French provinces conquered from John, had invaded the territories of the English crown in Poictou, and, with other towns, had taken Rochelle."], [553, "n Chap.

Landing at Bourdeaux in 1225, the Eng lissi commanders put a stop to the progress of the French, recovered some places, and, after two years of hostility, without any action of moment, brought Lewis to a treaty of truce. Three other expeditions were conducted to France in the course of this reign, at distant intervals, and were commanded by the king in person, which, to prevent the interruption of other narratives, may be related here. On the death of Lewis the eighth, after a very short reign, and the accession of his infant son, Lewis the ninth, France became a scene of confusion. The aid of Henry's arms was eagerly solicited by numerous malcontents, particularly the Normans, who offered to reinstate the Englissi government. Procrastinating long, till, by the overthrow of the revolters, the opportunity was lost, the Englissi monarch at length landed at Saint-Maloes, in the May of 1230; and even then received such offers from the malcontents as might have enabled him to attain his object : but, wasting his time and money in extravagant amuse ments, as if his sole purpose had been a journey of pleasure, he was abandoned by his French allies ; and, retreating at the approach of the hostile army, he returned home with disgrace in October. To pro tect the count of la Marche, the first betrothed, and the actual second husoand of his mother, who refused from a vain conception of his dignity, to perform homage for his estates in Poictou to Alphonso, the brother of the French king, he conducted an army to that quarter in 1242: but, unfit to cope with Lewis, who now held personally the reins of govern- ment"], [554, "SI Cha XXII 1213 1253 Character ., Henry, HISTORY OF THE ment, he lost what had remained of Poictou to Eng land ; left the count to the mercy of his offended sovereign ; paid money to obtain a truce of five years ; and returned to England in the September of 1243, where, as if to conceal his disgrace, he marched in triumphal pomp to the capital. Better fortune attend ed, his last expedition, which had also a more legal object, the reduction of revolted barons in Guienne, the only French province now remaining to the Eng lissi crown, who confederated with Alphonso, king of Castile, for the transferring of their allegiance to him from Henry. Relying too much on the indo lence, or unwarlike genius, of their opponent, nei ther t,he Castilian prince, nor the confederate barons, were prepared to resist an Englissi army, which land ed at Bourdeaux in the August of 1253. Having reinstated the Englissi government, and concluded an alliance with Alphonso, by the marriage of his son Edward with Eleanor, sister of that monarch, Henry returned homeward through France, was magnifi cently entertained at Paris by Lewis the ninth, and arrived in England in the last week of the year 1 254. From his conduct in his French campaigns the reader must perceive the inertness of Henry. Con formably to the papal bull, issued above two years before, he was declared completely of age for the exercise of royalty, by a parliament convened at Ox ford in 1227 ; but his incapacity became every day more evident. He was of middle stature, a robust constitution, a countenance not pleasing, particularly by the peculiar form of his left eye-brow, which hung"], [555, "BRITISH ILANDS. 31 hung in such manner as to cover a part of the eye. Chap. xXII In strength of intellect, spirit, and resolution, he was very defective. \" Gentle, humane, and merciful,\" fays Hume, \" even to a fault, he seems to have been steady in no other circumstance of his character, but to have received every impression from those who surrounded him, and whom he loved, for the time, with the most imprudent, and most unreserved af fection. Without activity or vigour, he was unfit to conduct war : without policy or art, he was ill fit ted to maintain peace. His resentments, though has ty and violent, were not dreaded, while he was found to drop them wirh such facility. His friendihips were little valued, because they were neither derived from choice, nor maintained with constancy : a proper pageant of state in a regular monarchy, where his ministers could have conducted all his affairs in his name and by his authority ; but too feeble in those disorderly times to sway a sceptre, whose weight de pended entirely on the firmness and dexterity of the hand which held it.\" Conspicuous throughout his reign were his impolitic attachments to foreign favour ites ; a thoughtless profusion to persons of this class; a rapacity and lawless oppression to supply this waste; a low evasive cunning, and an insensibility of ssiame in the repeated breaches of his most solemn engage ments. His chastity and piety are praised by monkissi writers. The latter appears to have been deeply tinctured with superstition, the religious affection of a weak understanding, which prevented not the pub lic violations of his oaths repeatedly plighted to his parliament. Voj.. II. D The"], [556, "HISTORY OF THE 34 Cl'AP XXII Dissentions. 1232 1248, 1233 The annals of this reign compose little else than a registry of internal dissentions. Hubert de Burgh, who had been the leading regent, and who continued to act, after the king's majority, as prime minister, in the office of high justiciary, conferred on him for life, fell at length, by the incessant attacks of his enemies, into such disgrace with the king, in all ap- pearance unjustly, that he narrowly escaped death. After various vicissitudes, he regained a considerable share of the royal favour, but wisely abstained from offices of administration. He was succeeded by the bissiop of Winchester, his former colleague, rival, and enemy, a man of arbitrary principles, of great courage and abilities, who, to support his authority, brought from Poictou, of which he was a native, great numbers, whom he enriched by offices of trust, and marriages with the most wealthy heiresses under the king's guardianssiip. Enraged at the rapacity and insolence of these foreigners, who absorbed the revenues, and contumelioufly violated the rights of the nation, the barons refused to obey the king's summons for their attendance in parliament, and even sent his Majesty a message, that, \" if he would not dismiss these foreigners, they would drive both them and him out of the kingdom, and set the crown on a worthier head !\" By the deep artifices of the minis ter the combination of the barons was broken.

To complaints of illegal acts the king replied, *' why ssiould I observe a charter which is neglected by all my grandees ?\" To this was reasonably an swered, \" you ought, sir, to set them the example.\" So tyrannical an administration must soon terminate in its own or the public ruin. Alarmed by the forci ble representations of Edmund, the primate, Henry commanded the bissiop of Winchester to retire to his diocese, dispossessed the foreigners, and restored the Englissi. As the primate, a man of integrity and judge ment, took, for some time, the lead in public affairs great hopes were entertained of national tranquillity ; but the qualities of the king, arising from his weak ness, were not well adapted for the realizing of such hopes. The marriage of Henry with Eleanor, daugh ter of the count of Provence, was followed by a new swarm of foreigners from that country and Savoy, who were enriched in the fame manner as their dis carded predecessors of Poictou. The annals of the country are filled, for some years after, with remon strances of the Englissi nobles against foreign favou rites, with the artifices of the latter to maintain their ground, and with promises of redress, always broken, from the king. Far from executing the reiteratedly promised dismissal of such favourites, he received, with perhaps a still higher degree of cordial attachment, a fressi addition from Gaseony.

By his intemperate profusion, while a disgusted parlia ment was tardy in supplies, the king, notwithstand ing various modes of iliegal exaction, as forced loans and benevolences, was reduced to such straits as to sell all his plate and jewels, which were purchased by the citizens of London. This proof of their wealth at once provoked his envy, and augmented his eagerness to extort money from them. David Hume has remarked that, as Henry was the first Englissi monarch of the Norman line, who in strictness of speech was considered as subject to the restraint of law, so was he \" also the first who prac tised the dispensing power, and employed the famous clause of non-obstante in his grants and patents.\" In this he pleaded the example of the pope, who dis pensed occasionally with all ordonnances human and divine. The resentments, excited against the king by the oppressions in the civil government, were greatly aggravated by his abetment of a tyrannical exercise of the papal authority over the Englissi church, which in this reign was carried to its utmost extent. The sovereign pontiff assumed a despotic power in setting aside all particular rules, and all privileges of patrons, churches, and convents. Be side his nomination of two successive primates, Rich ard Legrand and Edmund Rich, both indeed worthy of that high dignity, he disposed of all the valuable benefices of the kingdom, mostly to Italians ; inso much that the annual revenues in England of Italian ecclesiastics, most of. whom were absentees, dwelling at"], [559, "n Chap XXII, \u2022 . ' BRlrL'H ILANDS. at P.ome, were computed to amount to sixty thousand marks, which much exceeded in value seven hun dred thousand pounds at present. Pluralities were carried to such a height, that the king's chaplain, Mansel, is said to have held at once seven hundred livings. Beside great sums procured in a less direct manner, where simony was openly practised, and justice, in appeals to the Roman tribunal, sold to the highest bidders, the most grievious taxes were arbitrarily le vied by the pope from the Englissi clergy. In 1228 he levied the tenths of all the moveables, not only of the clergy, but even of the laity, by the terrors of excommunication. He obliged the members of the hierarchy to collect from the inferior ecclesiastics; and to leave no excuse for delay of payment, his le gate produced Italian usurers, who advanced the mo ney at exorbitant interest. Exactions from the cler gy were frequently renewed to such an amount, that at one time, the legate was said to have carried more money out of England than remained in it after him. Various attempts of the Englissi barons, to prevent these balefully empoverissiing abuses and extortions, served only as momentary checks. In 1232 associ ations were formed secretly for driving the Italian cler gy out of the kingdom. Their barns and fields were wasted and the persons of those who were found were maltreated. On a judicial inquiry, such numbers, and men of such rank, were found concerned in these tumults, that all escaped punissiment. In 1245, the barons frighted the legate out of England by threat- ening"], [560, "si Chap. XXII, Sicilian projeit. 1254 126 HTSTOFY OF THE ening to cut him to pieces, and sent a most respecta ble embassy to a general council at Lyons, where such statements were made of papal oppression, that the pontiff was effected with shame, but not prevent ed from renewing his exactions. Beside other de mands, he claimed half the revenues of all the non resident, and a third of those of all the resident cler gy. The king, who, relying on the papal authority to support him against his discontented subjects, had been so abjectly submissive, as even to publish in his kingdom the sentence of excommunication against the emperor, Frederic the second, the husoand of his sister, was at length obliged, by the enormity of the evil, to join his barons and clergy in opposing such intolerable claims. But the pope contrived to dupe him into a delusive project, by which he drew from him vast quantities of treasure. The kingdom of Naples and Sicily, called the kingdom of Sicily, or of the Two Sicilies, had fall en under a feudal subjection to the Roman pontiff. Fierce wars had been waged between the emperor Frederic the second and pope Innocent the fourth for its actual dominion. After the emperor's death in 1250, his natural son, Mainfroy, possessed him self of it by stratagem, under the pretence of defend ing it for its lawful heir, Conradine, grandson of Fre derick. Finding himself unable, by his own armies and resources alone, to dispossess this artful and active prince, Innocent made a tender of the kingdom to. Henry for his second son, Edmund. Without con sulting his parliament or friends, the weak monarch joyfully accepted the insidious offer of a kingdom as yet"], [561, "BRITISH ILANDS 39 Chap, XXII Earl of Cornwall, yet unconquered, which, even in case of conquest, liis son would most probably never be permitted to govern. Having given the pontiff unlimited credit for discretionary expences on his account in the Sicilian war, Henry soon found himself involved in a monstrous debt, which received perpetually new accessions, without any progress against Mainfroy, who kept his ground so firmly that the maintaining of a papal army against him was at length abandon ed. To supply the importunate demands the clergy of England were repeatedly and most mercilessly fleeced. Beside numerous and grievous exactions made according to some rules, bills were drawn at one time to the value of above eighteen hundred thousand pounds of our money, in the names of all the bissiops and other superior clergy, who were com manded to sign them, payable to Italian merchants. The clergy, who at first refused with indignation, submitted in the end to the menaces of the legate, who told them that ** all ecclesiastical benefices were the property of the pope, who might dispose of them in whole or in part, according to his pleasure.\" The value of twelve millions of our money is computed to have been drawn from England, in some years, under the pretence of the Sicilian war.

Though Richard was too wise to be duped by so palbably fraudulent a proposal, yet he was not wise enough to decline another offer not much less vainly expensive. On a vacancy in the German empire of the elective dignity of king of the Romans, a dignity which gave the right of ascending the imperial throne as soon as vacant, a majority of the electors, influenced by the fame of the earl's im mense riches, gave their suffrages to raise him to that exalted title. A prodigious mass of treasure, which he carried to Germany in 1257, was soon drained from him by the rapacity of tne German princes, among whom he had no personal interest ; and he returned home in 1259 with full grounds of convic tion, that he had lavissied the savings of his past life on the purchase of a merely nominal dignity ; had augmented the national distress and discontents by the exportation of so much money ; and had by his absence given an opportunity to the malcontent ba rons to divest his royal brother of his authority. Richard had sometimes joined against the king in combinations of the discontented nobles ; but, in the approach of a crisis dangerous to the royal power, he had each time by deTertion supported his brother's cause. 1 hese nobles, in answer to requests of sup plies made by the king, had repeatedly made severe complaints of the wretchedness caused by his mis government, and of his. dissionourable breaches of the most solemn promises. Some poignant reproach- es"], [563, "BRITISH ILANDS. 41 Chap.

Among the foreigners who settled in England in this reign, was Simon de Montfort, younger brother of a French baron, to whose family had fallen an am ple inheritance of Englissi estates. The elder bro ther possessed of estates more ample still in France, and unable to perform fealty to two monarchs at once, transferred his right of the former to Simon, who was created earl of Leicester, and, in 1238, married to a sister of king' Henry, the dowager of William, earl of Pembroke. Much favoured by the king, but too spirited for a servile compliance with his"], [564, "u Chap. XXII Provision* of Osford. 1258. HISTORY OF THE his caprices, he had with him alternate quarrels and reconciliations. In one of these quarrels, charac teristic of incorrect manners and government, the king called Montfort a traitor to his face, on which the latter gave him the lie, and told him that, if he were not his sovereign, he would chastise him for the insult. Though re-admitted, even after this, to a share of authority at court, yet, disdaining to act in subserviency to the minions of a weak unsteady prince, he chose to connect himself with the malcon tent barons, whose resentments he enflamed by pa thetic representations of their various grievances, among which was the ignominy of being governed by foreigners, notwithstanding that himself was of that description. Having ingratiated himself with the clergy by affected devotion, and gained the con fidence of the public by declaiming against abuses, and by his known antipathy to the royal favourites, with the chief of whom, a uterine brother of the king, he had entered into open hostility, he proceed ed to attempt an innovation in the government. He called a private meeting of the principal barons, and persuaded them, as the only remedy for the na tional evils, to form a league for taking into their own hands the administration of the kingdom. In consequence of the plan then formed, the king, at the next assembly of the parliament, summoned in the expectation of supplies for the Sicilian war, found, on his entrance into the hall, the nobles clad in complete armour. Startled at the sight, and de manding whether they intended to make him their prisoner, he received for answer, that they had no such"], [565, "BRITISH ILANDS. 43 such design ; that they even purposed to grant him Chap. ample supplies ; but that, as he had often promised , _ 1 ' y redress without performance, they expected him to confer authority on those who were able and willing to give national content. Intimidated by a forcible display of union and determined spirit among the barons, and partly soothed by the hopes of supplies, the king agreed to convene another parliament at Oxford, in which a new administration ssiould be formed. Accordingly, on the eleventh of June, in the year 1258, was assembled what was called by the king's adherents the mad parliament, at which the confederate barons were attended by such multitudes of armed men, that their sovereign was virtually their prisoner, and obliged to assent to the terms imposed. Twenty-four nobles, twelve selected from the king's council, twelve chosen by parliament, were vested with unlimited authority to reform the state. These immediately ordered that three sessions of parliament ssiould be held every year : that four knights, elected by each county, should report at each session the state of the country : that a new high ssieriff ssiould be every year elected in each county by its freeholders : that no foreigners ssiould be entrusted with the ward ssiip of heirs or custody of castles : and that no new forests or warrens ssiould be created, nor the revenues of any hundreds or counties let to farm. After these regulations, called the Provisions of Abuses \u2022( Oxford, the twenty-four barons proceeded to acts less v.sTon-'s0\" laudable. The king's uterine brothers, and other foreigners, were glad to save their lives by flight from the kingdom. Claiming, like the Decemviri of"], [566, "HISTORY OF THE 44 Chap XXU 1259 1262, of the ancient commonwealth of Rome, a right to retain their authority until they should have com- pleted their plan of reform, the twenty-four took such steps as letmed to indicate a design to perpe- tuate their powtr. Having associated themseves by an oath to support one another with their lives and fortunes, and having filled all the chief offices, both civil and military, with their adherents, they oblig- ed every person to swear obedience to all their regu- lations present and future. Earl Richard, king of the Romans, was not permitted, in the following year, to enter the kingdom, till he had sworn to that purpose. An alarm pervaded the nation, which seem- ed to be threatened with the despotism of a perma- nent oligarchy. Encouraged by the general discon- tents, and by a dissention among the governing barons, the king at length took measures to re- establifli his power. As the twenty-four had con- fiscated the revenues of the nonresident Italian clergy, he easily obtained from the irritated pope an absolution from their oaths of all who had sworn to observe the porvisions of Oxford. He gained possession of the tower of London with a treasure there deposited. By a proclamation, and by a speech to a parliament held in London in the April of 1262, he announced his resumption of the govern- ment, and his displacing of the ssierisss and other officers appointed by the barons. Hence arose much confusion, as men obeyed officers of the one or the other appointment according to their inclina tion or other circumstance^.

The barons, reunited, prepared for war. Hostilities were begun by Lewellin, prince of North- Wales, their confederate, whose invasion of the Englissi counties wras repelled by prince Edward, the eldest son of king Henry ; but Edward was soon after made prisoner by Montfort, who had re turned from France, and taken the lead of the malcontents. This prince, though young, had con demned his father's violations of promises ; had, until matters came to extremity, refused to avail himself of the pope's absolution from his oath, though imposed by force, in his opinion unjust, and abused by the barons ; and had thus begun to gain the confidence of all parties by giving such a proof of integrity and steadiness. By the capture of Edward, the animating power of the royalist party, a decisive superiority was gained by the faction of Montfort, whose cause was espoused by the populace of the cities, particularly London. In the country the demesnes of the king and of his adherents were ravaged ; but in London the unbridled mob, as is usual in such bodies roused to hostility, confined not the torrent of their fury to their political opponents. Some hundreds of Jews were massacred, whose ef fects, with those of Italian merchants, and of many of the wealthier Englissi citizens, became the prey of the rabble.

The king was compelled again to submit to the barons, on terms more humiliating still than formerly ; but prince Edward, having re covered his liberty, renewed the war. The two parties, finding themselves nearly balanced, were brought to agree, by the loud solicitations of the general voice, to a suspension of arms, and to the referring of their differences to the arbitration of Lewis the ninth, the French monarch. This reference, which would otherwise have been extremely dangerous, was rendered safe by the pecu liar character of Lewis, a character, fays Hume, \" the most singular which is to be met with in all the records of history. This monarch united to the mean and abject superstition of a monk all the courage and magnanimity of the greatest hero ; and, what may be deemed more extraordinary, the justice and integrity of the most disinterested patriot, the mildness and humanity of the most accomplissied philosopher.\" He had already given to the king and nobles of England the most ample proof of his scrupulous sense of justice. Completely enabled, by the intestine divisions of the Englissi nation to deprive the Englissi crown of what territories still remained to it in France, he had not only abstained from the easy conquest, but had even voluntarily restored some conquered parts of Poictou and Guienne, and ha,d paid a great sum in consideration of an empty cession made to him by Henry of the other French provinces formerly subject to the kings of"], [569, "-BRITISH ILANDS. 47 Chap.

As he had already endeavoured by kind per suasions to reconcile the contending parties, he un dertook, without reluctance, the office of a judge between them, on a solemn appeal, ratified by the oaths and subscriptions of the leaders on both sides. A/ter a full discussion, in an assembly of the states of France at Amiens, in the presence of king Henry and some chiefs of the malcontents, he pronounced, on the third of February, a sentence for the restora tion of the king to all the prerogatives which he had enjoyed previously to the provisions of Oxford, as these provisions had been only a temporary expe dient. At the fame time he ordered a general amnesty, and declared that he meant not, by his award, in any manner, to abrogate the privileges granted to their subjects by the Englissi monarchs before the disputes between Henry and his barons. Declaring that the sentence contained a contra diction, since the annulling of the provisions of Oxford would leave them without security for their privileges, the confederate nobles flew to arms. Ruinous devastations were committed on both sides. The king and prince Edward, advancing from the north with a superior force, reduced the cities of Northampton, Leicester, and Nottingham ; raised the siege of Rochester, and compelled the general of the junto, Montfort, to retire to London. That general, possessed of high military talents, collected an army, in which were fifteen thousand Londoners, and marched with so much secrecy and speed, that, if he had not been prevented by the promptitude of the"], [570, "HISTORY OF THE 48 Chap, XXII. Mite of Lewes. 1264 the prince, he would have surprised the royalists in their quarters at Lewes in Sussex. On the four teenth of May the two armies advanced with mutu ally adverse fronts, the confederates in four divisions, the royalists in three. The prince, with one divi sion, russied furiously on the Londoners, who com posed the opposite van ; broke them in an instant ; and, actuated by youthful ardour, and a spirit of revenge, pursued them four miles without giving quarter. Montfort, attentive to every circumstance, took advantage of the error of long pursuit com mitted by Edward, charged the two remaining divisions of the royal army, broke them, and made prisoners both Henry and the king of the Romans. Astonissied, yet undaunted, on his return to the field of battle, Edward strove in vain to rouse his division to attack the victorious army ; while Mont fort, apprehensive of such an attempt, amused him by a pretence of negociation, until he had recalled from the pursuit, and re-embattled, the confederates. Finding an escape impossible by either battle or flight, Edward submitted to a convention, called, from an absolete French word, the Mise of Lewes, by which himself and Henry d'Allmaine, son of the king of the Romans, were to remain hostages, until the terms of pacification, founded on the pro visions of Oxford, should have been fully adjusted, while all the other prisoners should be set at liberty. Montfort, having gained this decisive advantage, the capture of the prince, his only formidable op ponent, whom he sent, strongly guarded, to the castle of Dover, was little anxious to fulfil on his own"], [571, "BRITISH ILANDS. 49 Cha XXII own side the terms of the convention. The king, whom he seemed to liberate, he still retained in effect a prisoner under guards attached to his inte rest ; and, governing under the pretended authority of his captive sovereign, possessed himself of all the royal fortresses, and acted as sole master of the king dom. As if he had wissied to be enabled, by the acquisition of immense property, to carry into exe cution some higher plan, perhaps the usurpation even of the throne, he exercised such rapacity as to appropriate to himself the confiscated estates of eighteen baTons, and the ransome of all the prison ers. By an ordonnance of Parliament, procured by his influence, the whole regal power was com mitted to a council of nine, and thus virtually to himself, as the scheme was so contrived, that he had in reality, though not in appearance, the nomination of all its members. Active to maintain the power which he had acqui- red, he prepared against the arm of his opponents both temporal and spiritual. An army was assembled on the southern coast against the attempt of an invasion from France, which was arranged by the queen of England with the connivance of the French monarch, but frustrated by adverse winds. To cardinal Guido, the pope's legate, who was coming with a bull of excommunication against him and all his adherents, he sent a messenger with a denunciation of death, if he ssiould attempt to land in the Englissi territo ries. The legate, not choosing to incur the danger, sent the bull by three Englissi bishops whom he found in France, with strict orders, under pain of Vol. II.

But in this time of public disorder, when Montfort, depending much on the attachment of the lower ranks, dared not to restrain their excesses, the mariners of these towns became so licentious as to practice the most ferocious piracy, seizing the vessels of all nations, and throwing their crews into the sea, by which the foreign commerce of England was for a time quite destroyed. To maintain his ascendency by the popular favour against the growing discontents, which had caused a dissention from his interest even in his own junto, Montfort assembled a Parliament in London, on the twenty-eighth of January, in the year 1 265, to which, beside the barons and ecclesiastics, were summoned two knights of the ssiire from each county, and two citizens or burgesses from each town, representatives first noticed on this occasion in the records of England as members of parliament, the first authenticated components of a house of commons. By his sug gestion the liberation of prince Edward was voted by this parliament : but this liberation was only apparent, like that of the king, as both were guarded in the fame manner. - As the most powerful dissentient"], [573, "BRITISH ILANDS. 51 Chap XXII Battles of Kennel- worth and Ev.sharn. 1265 dissentient nobleman of the junto, the earl of Glo cester, retired to his estates on the Welch borders, and made warlike preparations, Montfort followed him with an ajcmy to Hereford, bringing with him the king and prince, by whose presence he might seem to be acting under the sanction of royal autho rity. Here the prince, feigning indisposition, and obtaining leave to take an airing on horseback with his guards, effected his escape by a remarkably fleet horse, clandestinely conveyed to him by the earl of Glocester, with whom the plot had been concerted. On the news of this event, such numbers repaired with alacrity to the standard of the prince, that he soon found himself at the head of an army far supe rior to that of Montfort. Having, at the requisition of the earl of Glocester, taken an oath to use his best endeavours, in case of his being victorious, to procure the exclusion of foreigners, and a legal administration, Edward advanced to attack the earl of Leicester, who dexterously avoided a battle until he ssiould have been reinforced by an army from London, under Simon his son. To prevent the junction of the two armies, the prince, by a rapid inarch, surprised and routed the troops of young Simon, who had arrived at Kennelworth. Resolv ing to draw from this victory every possible advan-. tage, he marched without delay against the father encamped at Evessiam, ordering one division, which advanced on the direct: road, to display, for decep tion, the captive standards; while himself, with the main body, took a course more circuitous.

At length perceiving the reality, he prepared for action with unabated courage, though with disadvantages so great and manifest, that he is said to have confessed his condition hope less. Notwithstanding their great inferiority of number, and the immediate route of their Welch associates, the troops of Leicester maintained the combat from two in the afternoon till night, when, after the fall of their general and his son Henry, they were completely broken. The king, who was among them as a prisoner, narrowly escaped the swords of his friends. Whatever were the real de signs of Montfort, which were left in uncertainty by his discomfiture and death, and whatever were the temporary disasters of the nation by his commo tions, the Englissi constitution received by his means a radical improvement. He was so revered by the lower orders of both laity and clergy, that notwith standing the consignment of him to perdition, both alive and dead, by the pope's decree, he was regarded after his death as a faint and martyr. Of extraordi nary talents he gave ample proof, and he has been commended for uncommon clemency. The victory of Evessiam, gained on the fourth of August, in the year 1265, gave a decided derance to the royalists; but some of the baronial party, from apprehensions or experience, of rigo rous treatment, still continued in arms, particularly in Axholine, Ely, Kennelworth, and Hampssiire.

Adam Gordon or de Gourdon, who is said to have been overcome in a dreadful single combat by Edward, to have been generously treated by that prince, and to have requited his generosity by con tinuing ever afterward faithful in his service. Though, for the restoration of tranquillity, more lenient measures were afterwards adopted, fines im posed on the vanquished, instead of confiscations of their property, yet the earl of Glocester, offended by past severities, dreading a return of Henry's maladministration, and alledging that the prince had not performed his engagement, raised the standard of revolt, and took possession of the metro polis, whose citizens, enraged by the violent ex actions and other harssi acts of the king, joined his troops with alacrity. On the approach of the prince with a formidable army from the north, he proposed an accommodation ; and, having obtained an indemnity for himself and his adherents, he re newed his fealty.

Under that young and ambitious priest the successors of Saint Peter attained the full meridian of their greatness ;, and in a reign of eighteen years he exercised a despotic command over the emperors and kings, whom he raised and deposed ; over the nations, whom an in terdict of months or years deprived, for the offence of their rulers, of the exercise of christian worssiip. In the council of the Lateran he acted as the eccle siastical, almost as the temporal, sovereign of the east and west. It was at the feet of his legate that John of England surrendered his crown ; and Innocent may boast of the two mojl signal triumphs over fense and humanity, the establishment of transub stanliai'ion, and the origin of the inquisition. At his voice two crusades, the fourth and the fifth were undertaken ; but, except a king of Hungary, the princes of the second order were at the head of the pilgrims : the forces were inadequate to the design : nor did the effects correspond with the hopes and wissies of the pope and the people.\" Mhe fourth crusade, performed conjointly by French and Venetian forces, was, by the solicita tions' of an exiled son of a dethroned and imprisoned emperor of the Greeks, and by the ambitious views et"], [579, "BRITISH ILANDS. 57 Chap.

In the fifth crusade, , two hundred thousand Franks were debarked in Egypt, the scat and storehouse of the sultan, the conquest of which might naturally be expected to involve or facilitate that of the Holy land. Bat frustrated by misconduct, sickness, and the inundation of the Nile, in aid of the Oriental forces, they agreed to a pacification, relinquissied the little ground which they had gained, and retired with out advantage. The emperor of Germany, how ever, Frederick the second, landing in Palestine, with a formidable army, was though under a sentence of papal excommunication, so successful, that, partly by the discord of the mohammedans, partly by their esteem of his personal character, he obtained, by a treaty of peace, the restitution of Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, Tyre, and Sidon. A peace of fifteen years, enjoyed by the Latins of Jt.:usalem, was, in the words of Gibbon, \"termi nated by the interruption of the strange and savage hords of Carizmians. Flying from the arms of the Moguls, those Shepherds of the Caspian rolled headlong on Syria ; and the union of the Franks with the sultans of Aleppo, Hems, and Damascus, was insufficient to stem the violence of the tor rent. Whatever stood against them was cut off by the sword or dragged into captivity : the military orders were almost exterminated in a single battle : and in the pillage of the city, in the profanation of the holy sepulchre, the Latins confess and regret the modesty and discipline of the Turks and Saracens.\" Against"], [580, "HISTORY OF THE 58 (\"'HAP, XXIII 12.S 1251 1270 1271 1271 Against Egypt, a great source of power to the mohammedans, who, after the Carizmian irruption, had repossessed themselves of Jerusalem, was the sixth crusade conducted by Lewis the ninth of France. Notwithstanding the most heroic bravery displayed by this monarch and his followers, he was overcome by the climate, by the Nile, by famine, and the vigour of the enemy. Surrounded and made prisoner, with all his army, but permitted by capitulation, on the payment of a great ransome, to embark for Palestine with the remnant of his forces, he wasted four years within the walls of Acre, unable to visit the holy sepulchre, and at length returned home. After sixteen years of re pose, when the strength of his kingdom was restored and augmented, he embarked in the seventh and last crusade, but lived not to revisit the Syrian coast. Debarking, on his way, at Tunis in Bar bary, in the vain expectation of converting its monarch, and obtaining a great treasure, he died of a pestilence on the burning sands, and his suc cessor returned to France with the wreck of the wasted army. \u25a0Prince Edward of England had, at the exhortation of Lewis, embarked in this crusade. Unaided by the French, his forces were quite inadequate to his ob ject ; yet, by his prowess, and the terrific fame of his great-uncle Richard, he was enabled to make a considerable impression. At the head of a thousand soldiers he delivered Acre from a siege ; marched with nine thousand as far as Nazareth ; and extorted by the terrour of his arms a truce of ten years. To rid"], [581, "BRITISH ILANDS. 59 Chap XXI Is, 1291 Accession of Edward the first. 1272, rid the mohammedans of so formidable a foe, a fanatic attempted to kill him in a private conference ; but he wrested the dagger from the assassin, after he had received a dangerous wound in the arm, of which he was cured by the skill of a surgeon, not, as has been fabulously related, by the sucking of the poison from the cut by the mouth of his consort, at the rissi of her own life. As no great effort was afterwards made by the nations of the west for the recovery of the holy city, or the protection of what remained to the christians in Syria, these were gradually expelled from all their fortresses except the town of Acre, which remained in their hands till the year 1291. The Mamelukes of Egypt, of whom I shall have occasion to give an account in my fourth volume, constituted the flower of a mighty host, by which this last refuge of the Franks was assailed, and after a siege of thirty-three days taken by storm. \" At the command of the sultan,\" says Gibbon, \" the churches and fortifications of the latin cities were demolissied : a motive of avarice or sear still opened the holy sepulchre to some de vout and defenseless pilgrims : and a mournful and solitary silence prevailed along the coast, which had so long resounded with the world's debate.\" Edward had arrived in Sicily, in his return to England, when he received information of his father's death, which impressed him with serious concern. He was also informed of the perfectly peaceable settlement of his kingdom, where a re gency had been appointed of an archbissiop and two earls ; and where, from the high idea entertained of"], [582, "HISTORY OF THE 60 Chxp. XXIII 127 3 1274 Hi. charac ter, of his talents and integrity, all ranks had been for ward in giving their oaths of allegiance. Thus rendered secure, he allowed himself ample time, not only for business, but even for amusement, in his journey homeward through Italy and France. At Chalon in Burgundy, he engaged in a tourna ment, which, from envy of a superior prowess of himself and his knights, ended in a serious quarrel with much bloodssied : he performed homage for Guinne to the French monarch : he visited that pro vince to settle its affairs ; and returned through France to England, where he was received with joyful acclamations, and crowned on the nineteenth of August in the year 1274. Except that his legs were uncommonly long and slender, whence was affixed to his name the appel lation of Longstanks, this monarch was of a well proportioned frame. Lie was tall, majestic, of a prepossessing aspect, with regular and comely fea tures, a piercing look, a strength of body, and a dexterity in arms, perhaps exceeded by no man in his time. Edward, fays LIume, \" was as well quali fied to captivate the populace by his exterior appear ance, as to gain the approbation of men of fense by his more solid virtues.

The enterprises which he finissied, and the projects which he formed and brought very near to a conclusion, were more pru dent, more regularly conducted, and more advanta geous to the solid interests of his kingdom than those which were undertaken in any reign either of his ancestors or successors.\" But as the great improver of the laws of his kingdom, whence he has been justly stiled the English Justinian, he is seen in the most advantageous light ; for, as the fame elegant and philosophical historian has observed, \" the work of wise legislators commonly remains ; while the acqui sitions of conquerors often perish with them.\" Yet, with all his merits, this great prince displayed a cru elty of temper on occasions where his ambition was opposed, and an arbitrary spirit, which might have been attended with fatal consequences, if it had not been corrected by wisdom at the critical moments of danger. His application to the establissiment of laws and civil arrangements, which he immediately com menced after his arrival in England from the east, suffered some interruption by his wars with the Welch. In resuming the history of this people, which, in my thirteenth chapter I have carried to the year 1 185, I have little to add of transactions in the reigns of the three Englissi monarchs, who came successively to the throne next after the death of Henry the second. These transactions were similar to those which I have already related. According to circumstances the princes of Wales acknowledged or denied subsection to the Englissi monarchs, and were"], [584, "i:I TORY OF THE 62 Crap. x: in were in peace or war with the barons on their bor ders : they occasionally interfered in the civil wars of the Englissi, and had very frequently intestine ouarrels. To recite the petty contests, a.most innu merable, among themselves and with their neigh bours, has been judged inconsistent- with plans of history far more diffusive, and in fact could answer no purpose of utility. David ap Owen, who had seized the throne of North-Wales in 1170, after the death of his father Owen Gwyneth, held possession till 1 194, when he was expelled by his eldest brother Lewellyn. This prince, who reigned till his death in 1240, displayed such ability and wisdom as to gain from his compa triots the title of great : yet, not thinking himself able, in the decline of life, to maintain his authori ty against the rebellious practices of his son Griffin, he purchased the protection of king Henry the third, by subjecting his principality to vassalage under the crown of England. At his decease, his eldest son David, establissied his succession, by engaging king Henry to secure the person of Griffin in the tower of London. Aster the death of Griffin, occasioned by a fall, in an attempt to escape from prison, in 1244, David, thus freed from rivalry, ceased to pay deference to the English monarch, and even made hostile incursions into the neighbouring territories:. Lewellyn, the son of Griffin, elected to succeed his uncle David, who died in 1246, renewed these incur sions, and confederated with Montfort, earl of Leices ter, against the king : but, after the fall of this great baron, and the final reduction of the Englissi mal- contents,"], [585, "(33 Chap xxnt 127 7 BRITISH ILANDS. Contents, he was constrained to submit to vassalage, and the payment of tribute, in 1267. Repeatedly summoned, as a vassal of the Englissi crown, to perform his homage, after the accession of Edward, Lewellyn, regarding the new monarch as his personal enemy, refused, except on conditions which were judged inadmissible. Edward entered Wales from the north, in the spring of 1277, with a powerful army, exploring his way with the most cautious vigilance, and fortifying the passes behind him to secure a retreat in cafe of necessity. Utterly unequal to such a force, the Welch retired with their cattle to the mountains of Snowdon, where they were soon reduced by famine, as Edward, not choo- sing to pursue them into their fastnesses, maintained his position in the lower grounds, preventing all sup- ply. Without an opportunity of striking one blow in defense of his independence, Lewellyn was con- strained to submit to the rigorous terms imposed ; to pay a fine of fifty thousand pounds ; to perform ho- mage ; to consent that ail the barons of Wales, ex- cept four, ssiould swear fealty to the Englissi crown ; to relinquissi the country between Chessiire and the river Conway ; to pay a yearly tax for Anglesea ; and to settle pensions on his two brothers, David and Roderick, who had put themselves under the pro tection of the Englissi king. On the performance of the other articles, Edward made a ssiew of generosity in remitting the fine, which, amounting in value to eight hundred thousand pounds of our money, could not probably be levied from so poor a country. He restored to Lewellyn his betrothed consort, Eleanor Montfort,"], [586, "HISTORY OF THE 64 Chap XXIII 1281 282 Montfort, daughter of the deceased earl of Leicester, who, in her passage from France to Wales, had been taken by an English ssiip ; and he assisted in a friend ly manner at the celebration of his nuptials. Lewellyn is said to have been instigated by his brother David, his presumptive heir, as he had no children, and by prophecies interpreted in his favour, so re-assert his independence. The yoke of subjec tion he regarded as ignominious : perhaps he felt it galling ; while the Welch made loud complaints, without redress, of grievous oppressions, and contu melious treatment, from the English in the conquer ed territories. A revolt was determined : the Welch flew to arms ; invaded the English borders in 1281 ; defeated and captured lord Clifford ; and gained some other slight advantages. Edward, probably not dis pleased at occurrences which opened to him the de sirable prospect of uniting all South-Britain into one kingdom, advanced into Wales in the summer of 1282 with an irresistible army ; and as Lewellyn re tired to his former post on Snowdon, he took measures to reduce him, as before, by blockade. Committing the army to Roger Mortimer, he took his own station at Rhudhlan castle, to await the event of this block ade, which he expected to be tedious. An incident brought the business to an earlier decision, A body of French from Guienne and of Englissi, having, in a vain bravado, passed from Angltsca to the main land, on a bridge of boats thrown across the Menai, were furiously assailed and defeated with great slaugh ter. Elated by this casual victory, Lewellyn rassi !y descended from the heights, gave battle to Mor- timer,"], [587, "0 5 Chap.

David, his brother and successor, the last who bore the title of sovereign prince of Wales, unable to collect an army, was taken some time after, brought to trial before the peers of England, con demned as a traitor, hanged, drawn, and quartered ; and his head, together with that of Lewellyn, was exposed on the walls of the tower of London. After a struggle of so many centuries to maintain its in dependence, Wales was finally and completely con quered, and subjected to the laws and political ar rangements of England. Thecruel policy of Edward, instanced in the execution of prince David, is said to have been exercised to a much greater extent, in another instance, for the security of his conquest. Sensible that the traditional songs of the heroic deeds of their ancestors, fung, aided by the power of mu sic, at their feasts, tended highly to inflame a martial spirit, and love of independence, in the Welch, he is said to have issued an order by which all or most of their bards were collected and put to death. In the year 1301 he conferred on his eldest son the title of prince of Wales, a title which the eldest sons of his\" successors have ever since continued to bear. The rigour of Edward's justice, temper, avarice, and bigotry, was most severely felt by the Jews, who, notwithstanding all the persecutions and extortions which they had underwent, still formed a body in England, envied for wealth ; as much perhaps as Vox..

Among the ,a rious disorders, to the correction of which his active attention was directed, . none was more a subject of popular complaint than the debasement of the coin. This, on account of their superior skill, and atten tion to gain, was imputed to the Jews. On the twelfth of November, in the year 1278, all of this people were seized throughout the kingdom, and severely examined. Considerable numbers were con demned to death and the total confiscation of proper ty. In London alone two hundred and eighty were hanged. Not content with this, he indulged the national prejudices in consenting to a decree of his parliament, in 1 290, for the total banissiment of the race of Israel from England, whose number was sound to be fifteen thousand. Their property was confiscated, except their moveable effects, or money left with them for travelling expences ; but even of this they were robbed, on their passage from the Eng lish coast, by the mariners of the Cinque ports, who also threw many of them into the sea. For this, were many of these mariners capitally punished, as the king, how unjustly soever himself had acted to the unfortunate Israelites, would not connive at the violence of his subjects. England, so inauspicious to the Jewissi name, has, since this expulsion, been little inhabited by people of that sect : but the prac tice of usury against which the public clamour had been so loud, is supposed to have been more oppres sively conducted by Italian merchants and others, who succeeded in the trade, since the business, though very"], [589, "BRITISH II.ANDS. 67 Chap, XXIII Hi< civil govern' ment. Vtry useful in society, was, from religious error, not otherwise than clandestinely managed. The chief solid glory of Edward's reign rests on his civil regulations, to which he was on every oc casion strenuously attentive, but chiefly in those years of peace which immediately followed the final con quest of Wales. In the words of Hume, \" not only the numerous statutes, passed in his reign, touch the chief points of jurisprudence, and, according to Sir Edward Coke, truly deserve the name of esta blissiments, because they wrere more constant, stand ing, and durable laws than any made since ; but the regular order of his administration gave an oppor tunity to the common law to refine itself, and brought the judges to a certainty in their determinations, and the lawyers to a precision in their pleadings. Sir Matthew Hale has remarked the sudden improvement of Englissi law during this reign ; and ventures to assert that, till his own time, it never had received any considerable encrease. Edward settled the juris diction of the several courts ; first establissied the office of justice of peace ; abstained from the practice, too common before him, of interrupting justice by mandates from the privy council ; repressed robberies and disorders ; encouraged trade by giving merchants an easy way of recovering their debts ; and in ssiort introduced a new face of things by the wisdom and vigour of his government. As the law began now to be well establissied, the abuse of that happiness be gan also to be remarked. Instead of their former associations for robbery and violence, men entered into formal combinations to support each other in F 2 \u2022 lawsuits j"], [590, "6S Chap XXIII HISTORY OF THE lawsuits ; and it was found requisite to check this grievance by act of parliament.\" \" There happened in this reign a considerable alteration in the execution of the laws. The king abolissied the office of chief justiciary, which he thought possessed too much power, and was danger ous to the crown. He completed the division of the court of exchequer into four distinct courts, which managed, each its several branch, without depen dence on any one magistrate ; and, as the lawyers invented a method, by means of their fictions, to carry business from one court to another, the several courts became rivals and checks to each other ; a circumstance which tended much to improve the practice of the law in England.\" Though a great object of his attention was so to curb the power of the great barons as to prevent them from obstructing the regular course of justice ; \" yet he was imprudent ly led into a measure which tended very much to en crease and confirm their exorbitant authority. He passed a statute, which, by allowing them to entail their estates, made it impracticable to diminish the property of the great families, and left them all means of encrease and acquisition. He observed a contrary policy with regard to the church. He seems to have been the first christian prince who passed a statute of' mortmain ; and prevented by law the clergy from making new acquisitions, which, by the eclesi astical canons, they were for ever prohibited to alienate.\" He caused laws to be enacted Tor the protection of the Englissi church against new modes of papal exaction and usurpation ; and, though, from"], [591, "by Cha XXIII, Instances of his arbitra ry disposi tion. BRITISH ILANDS. from political motives, he refused not to the sove reign pontiff the tribute to which king John had subjected the realm, yet the payments were made with such reluctance and irregularity, that the arrears were suffered to accumulate at one time for six years, at another for eleven. As the barons had alwavs J disavowed the vassalage of the crown, and insisted on the nullity of the deed of John in assuming a right of subjecting his kingdom, without the national consent, to a foreign power, the act of homage was not peremptorily demanded, and, to avoid offense, the money was called a census instead of tribute. To remove corruption from the judicial benches, the pollution of justice at its source, Edward sum- moned a parliament, in 1289, for the trial of sus- pected judges, most of whom were found guilty of receiving bribes. For this, beside removal from their offices, they were punissied by fines, which are said to have amounted to the almost incredible sum of a hundred thousand marks, in value much above a million at present. But, most meritorious as he was in establissiing the enforcements of justice among his subjects, he was yet extremely fond of retaining in his own person arbitrary power. To this he seems to have been chiefly tempted by great and urgent pe- cuniary demands in expensive wars, in whicli he was engaged, or for which he was willing to be prepared. In 1280, by commissioners appointed to inquire into the validity of the titles by which men held their estates, considerable sums were exacted from those who had lost their original titles, notwithstanding their indubitable right from length of possession. This"], [592, "HISTORY OF THE 70 Chap XXIII This grievance was opportunely stopped by the de terminate behaviour of earl Warren, and the great prudence of the king, who saw the danger of pro ceeding further in this business. Required to pro duce his titles, the earl ssiewed his sword, saying, \" by this my ancestor acquired his estate, as a joint adventurer with William the bastard, who conquered this kingdom not for himself alone, and by this I am determined to hold it till my death.\" The king at one time seized, and converted to the public use, all the money and plate lodged in the churches and monasteries. In 1297 he forced the clergy to pay a tax amounting in value to the fifth of their moveables, in spite of a bull of the then reigning pope, by which, under pain of excommu nication, all princes were forbidden, without his consent, to levy taxes from the clergy, and the cler gy were likewise forbidden to pay them. On the positive refusal, under this authority, of payment from the ecclesiastics, Edward, declaring those who refused to support the civil government unworthy of its benefits, put them quite out of the protection of the laws, by issuing orders to the civil magistrates to hear no complaints from clergymen against laymen, but to give ample redress to the latter in their com plaints against the former. Robbed and maltreated with impunity by ruffians, who despised the unsup. ported censures of the church, the clergy found their situation intolerable, and finally submitted to the royal demand. On the same occasion, the preparing of a great armament against France, he prohibited the merchants from exporting more than a certain quantity"], [593, "BRITISH ILANDS. 71 Cn \\p, XXHI His con#ts sions to liberty. quantity of wool, at that time the staple merchan dise of England, laid a heavy impost on that quan tity, seized all the rest in the kingdom, together with the leather, and sold it for the purposes of war. He also took corn, cattle, and other necessaries for his army, without leave of the owners, with a pro raise, perhaps never performed, of future payment. The necessities of Edward in his vast exertions for momentous wars, which impelled him to deeds of illegal exaction, were also the cause of such conces sions on his part as tended much to the establissiment of public liberty. Discontent in all ranks had risen to a great height before his embarkation in his expe dition against France, and was manifested by the behaviour of some principal barons. Humphry Bohun, earl of Hereford, the constable of England, and Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, the mareschal, appointed by the king to command an army destined for Guienne, refused positively to take the charge, or to embark in the voyage. In a violent dispute on this occasion, which marks the rough manners Gf the age, Edward thus addressed the constable, \" by God, fir earl, you stall either go or be hanged ;\" to which the latter replied, \" by God, fir king, I will neither go nor be hanged ;\" and he immediately re tired, accompanied by the mareschal, and above thirty other nobles. Edward, perceiving a crisis of danger, took several measures to conciliate the pub lic mind. One of these was the assembling of many barons in Westminster-hall, to whom he apologized from the state of his affairs, for his past conduct ; promised"], [594, "M Chap X II HISTORY OF THE promised to redress all their grievances, in case of his return in safety from the continent ; and exhort ed them, if he ssiould perissi in the war, to preserve their allegiance to his son.

With the assent of the council of regency the charters, with the restricting clause, were sent to, Edward in Flanders, who, after some delay, and with the utmost reluctance, affixed to them his seal.

It is computed that* above thirty confirma tions of it were, at different times, required of seve ral kings, and granted by them in full parliament ; a precaution, which, while it discovers some igno rance of the true nature of law and government, proves a very laudable jealousy of national privileges in the people, and an extreme anxiety lest contrary precedents should ever be pleaded as an authority for infringing them. Accordingly we find that, though arbitrary practices often prevailed, and were even able to establissi themselves into settled customs, the validity of the great charter was never afterwards formally disputed ; and that grant was still regarded as the basis of Englissi government, and the sure rule by which the authority of every custom was to be tried and canvassed.\" In the contest between the king and the remon strant barons, the chief actors among whom he seems never to have forgiven, a civil war was pre vented by their dread of his supereminent abilities, and by his great prudence in avoiding to pussithem by persecution to extremities, and in yielding to the cogency of affairs in the critical moments. The difficulties in which he was involved, difficulties so great"], [596, "HISTORY OF THE 74 Chap, XXIII 1293 great as to force his most reluctant compliance, were occasioned by his wars with France and Scotland. Of the latter I shall speak in the next following chap ter. His intercourse with France was during many years amicable. In 1286 he visited that kingdom to perform homage for Guienne to Philip the fair, the monarch then reigning ; and remained above three years in the French territories, employed in a peace able transaction of affairs which concerned not Eng lish history. The concord of the two monarchs was interrupted by an unauthorized war between their seafaring subjects, occasioned by a quarrel between the crews of an Englissi and a Norman ssiip, in 1 293, about a spring of fressi water near Bayonne, in which a Norman was killed. As their sovereign refused to pay attention to their complaint, the Normans, to avenge themselves, seized an Englissi ssiip in the channel, and hanged some of the crew, together with some dogs, in addition of insult, at the yard arm. The mariners of the Cinque ports, without making any complaint, retaliated by making prize of all French vessels without distinction, which they were able to capture, and putting all on board to death. The French retaliated in like manner ; and the sea thus became a scene of the most barbarous hostility. Two hundred Norman ships, returning together from the south with troops and merchan dise, were intercepted, and, after an obstinate bat tle, almost all destroyed or taken by a fleet of sixty Englissi fitted for the purpose. No quarter, as usual, was given ; and the loss of men by the French was said to have been fifteen thousand.

The latter, from apprehensions of a war with Scot land, unwilling to come to an open rupture, employ ed, as a mediatrix, the queen of Navarre, mother to the queen of France, and wife to his brother Ed mund, earl of Lancaster. By her, and the queen her daughter, he was assured, that, if he would sur render Guienne to the French monarch, that prince, thus fully satisfied as to the point of honour, would restore it entire, and amicably terminate all differen ces. The surrendry was accordingly made, on the solemn engagement of Philip, in the presence of se veral witnesses, for its restoration : but the disinge nuous prince, in open violation of his compact, sum moned Edward a second time, and, on his non-ap pearance, declared the dutchy forfeited and annexed to the crown. Extremely provoked on finding himself duped in so gross a manner, Edward resolved on a war with France, but proceeded with a caution proportioned to its magnitude.

Edward, having overrun this kingdom, which he chose not to leave behind him unsubdued, at length embarked for the continent in the august of 1297, with an army of fifty thousand men. He had been so long delayed by the Scottish war, the difficulty of raising the great sums of money required, and the opposition of the remon strant barons, that he was too late for the perfor mance of any thing decisive against Philip, who, taking advantage of his delay, had invaded the ter ritories of his ally, the earl of Flanders, and made an alarming progress. The Englissi, however, on their arrival in Flanders, quickly stopped the career of the French arms, and silled the hitherto victo rious monarch with such apprehensions as inclined him to wissi for peace ; while Edward, disappointed of assistance by Adolphus, king of the Romans, to whom he had paid a great subsidy, discouraged by other circumstances, and having very urgent business at home where the Scots had revolted, was strongly impelled to the fame inclination. The twro kings agreed to a truce and to. a negociation for peace under the pope's mediation. In 1303 a pacific treaty was finally concluded, beside a matri monial alliance.

The principal transactions of this monarch and his successors, with the kings of Eng land, previously to the time of Edward the first, have been already related. Beside these we find little of an authentic nature worthy of narration. Mal colm, in his fifth invasion of England, in the No vember of 1 093, fell into an ambuscade, and toge ther with his eldest son Edward, was killed by the troops of Robert Mowbray, earl of Northumberland. His queen died of grief in a few days after.

XXlY V-^'V'w' 1095 1037 1107 1124-. encouraged by the tender age of Malcolm's three surviving sons, who took refuge in England. The usurper, in six months after, sought an asylum in the Hebude ilands, expelled by Duncan, a natural son of Malcolm, a warrior in the Englissi service, who, by a Scottissi faction, aided by some Englissi troops, gained possession of the monarchy. On the assassination of Duncan, in 1095, Malpeder, earl of Mearns, a partizan of the opposite faction, Do nald, returning from the iles, was again seated on the throne ; but, in two years after, he was defeat ed and taken prisoner by an Englissi army under Edgar Atheling, who caused prince Edgar, his ne phew, the eldest surviving son of Malcolm, to be crowned king of Scotland. A long peace was establissied between England and Scotland by the marriage of king Henry the first of the former with Matilda, the sister of king Edgar. To Edgar, who died in the January of 1 107, succeeded his brother next in age, Alexander, surnamed the fierce, from his exertions to punissi the licentious, and to establissi order in his king dom. To this monarch, who, though married to Sibylla, a natural daughter of Henry the first of England, died without issue in 11 24, succeeded his his youngest brother, David, styled saint in history from his piety according to the notions of that age, and his excessive liberality to the church. By his marriage with .Matilda, the only child of earl Wal theof, David acquired a claim to the Englissi earl doms of Huntingdon and Northumberland. By his long residence in England he had contracted a fond- ness"], [602, "HISTORY OF THE 80 Chap XXIV 1153 U<55 ness for the manners of that country, which he endeavoured to introduce among his subjects. In the civil wars of England he adhered to the party of Matilda the empress, and became possessed of the four most northern Englissi counties. As his only son, Henry, a youth of great hopes, died before him, he was succeeded at his death in 1153 by his grandson, Malcolm the fourth, surnamed the maiden from the circumstances of his life. This prince, of a feeble constitution and pacific temper, yielded to Henry the second of England the four northern Englissi counties ; performed homage to him at Chester for the earldom of Huntingdon ; and served under him in his war of Toulouse in 1159. The few remaining years of his reign were disturbed by tumults and insurrections among his subjects. He died of a lingering disease at Jedburg, in the Decem ber of 1 1 65, and was succeeded by his brother William, of a character so different from his as to be styled the lion. The feudal subjection of Scotland to the English crown, in consequence of William's captivity, is related in my nineteenth chapter, and its emancipa tion in my twentieth. Galloway, which had been hitherto almost or altogether independent of the Scottissi crown, was brought under a strict feudal subjection, 1175, by William, with the consent of Henry. In 1186 Roland, a chief of the reigning house, who had, after a civil war, gained the com mand of this principality, was by the arms of the Scottissi monarch, aided by those of England, inti midated, without a battle, into a renewal and con- firmation"], [603, "SI Chap.

Under the name of Gallo way was at that time comprehended the whole of that triangular part of Scotland which extends from the river Clyde to the frith of Solway and the Englissi borders, apparently inhabited by a heterogeneous race, of whom a great part is supposed to have con sisted of colonists from Ireland. Grateful to Richard the first of England for his resignation of Scotland's vassalage, William not only declined to take advan tage of that monarch's distress, but also contributed money for his ranfome. Except some insurrections in a ssiort time suppressed, particularly in Caithness and Sutherland, in the year 1196 and 1197, the chief troubles of William, after his pacification with England, were occasioned by disputes with the papal court. On a vacancy in the bissioprick of Saint-Andrews, in the year 1178, the monks at first made choice of John Scot, an Englissiman, for their bissiop ; but afterwards, at their king's requisition, they proceeded to a new election, and chose Hugo, one of the royal chaplains. Scot, on his appeal to the pope, was, by command of the legate Alexius, in 1180, consecrated bissiop; but the king with held from him the revenues, and he again repaired to Rome with his complaints. Pope Alexander the third excommunicated Hugo, and threatened the king himself with censures. William was so far from complying, that he banissied Scot and all his adherents ; in consequence of which he was imme diately excommunicated, and his kingdom was put under an interdict. On the death of this pontiff, Vol. II. G his"], [604, "\u25a0S2 Chap, XXIV HISTORY OF TlsE his successor, Lucius the third, removed the cen- sures from the king and kingdom in 1182. In the next following year, having caused both claimants to resign, he conferred tht; see of Saint-Andrews on Hugo, and that of Dunkeld on Scot. The latter, after an apparent acquiescence, renewed his claim after the death of Lucius, and was favourably heard by the successive popes, Urban the third and Clement the third. By Urban, Hugo was suspended and excommunicated: by Clement, in 1188, the see of Saint-Andrews was declared vacant, tire chapter commanded to proceed to a new election, the clergy to receive Scot as their bishop, the Scottissi monarch enjoined no longer to oppose that prelate, and the Englissi monarch to exert his influence in his favour by persuasion, or, if necessary, by arms. As Wil- liam appeared inflexible, Scot finally resigned, and Hugo was absolved, and restored to the see. Not- withstanding all the firmness of the king, his suc- cess, as Doctor Henry has observed in his history of Britain, \" seems to have been partly owing to the seasonable death of that haughty inflexible pontiff, Alexander the third, and to the character of John Scot, who had neither the courage, abili- ties, nor obstinacy of a Becket.\" As the arch- bishops of York had claimed a right of primatial jurisdiction over Scotland, which was not admitted by the clergy of that kingdom, William, to put an end to tnis pretension, procured from Celestine the third in 1192 a bull, by which the church of Scotland was declared immediately subject to the see"], [605, "t- BRITISH ILANDS. 83 Chap.

This prince had been betrothed, when he was only one year old, to a child of the fame age, Margaret, the eldest daughter of Henry the third of England, and his marriage with her was celebrated with great pomp at York, at the end of the year 1251. The kingdom, during his minority, was agitated by factions. The party of the Comyns, in whose hands was the regency, kept the king and queen in a sort of imprisonment, in separate apartments, in the castle of Edinburg. Henry, who was uncle to the king and father to the queen, concerted mea sures for their deliverance with the adverse faction. While he advanced to the borders with an Englissi army to support them, they gained possession of the castle by surprise, in 1255, and liberated the royal pair. The Comyns and their adherents were dismissed from the administration, and the regency was committed to fifteen chiefs of the victorious party. The defeated faction soon found an oppor tunity of attempting to regain their power. One of its members, Gamelin, bissiop elect of Saint- Andrews, consecrated by the bissiop of Glasgow, in direct opposition to the commands of the re gency, was in consequence outlawed and deprived of"], [607, "BRITISH ILANDS.' 65 of his revenues. When, on his complaint, a papal excommunication was fulminated against all his enemies, the Comyns, exclaiming that the govern ment was in the hands of excommunicated men, took arms, and seized at Kinross the persons of the king and queen. Forming an alliance with Lewellyn, prince of Wales, then at war with Eng land, they advanced with an army to the borders ; but, fearing the consequences of a battle with the English troops, they entered into a negotiation, which terminated in a sort of coalition of parties, and the forming of a new regency on that princi ple. After his assumption of the reins of govern ment, on his arrival at maturity of age, we find little worth mention in his history, except his acqui sition of a sovereignty over the Hebude ilands to the crown of Scotland. Chap. X IV. 1257. As the Hebudes, in the ninth century, had be came, together with the Orkneys and iles of Shetland, the stations of Scandinavian pirates, Harald Harfargre, king of Norway, who aimed at the extirpation of these ravagers, pursued them into their retreats, and subdued the ilands, about the year 910. The Hebudes however became soon independent, forming a distinct state under a Nor wegian lord, but nominally subject to the king of Norway. At what time they received the Celtic race of people, by which they are now inhabited, the same with the Scottissi Highlanders, is not known. Probably they were gradually colonized by successive emigrations from the neighbouring Highlands and Ireland.

In 1263, Haco the fourth of Norway, probably with the design of establissiing fully his dominion in these ilands, and of possessing himself of a part of the Scottissi mainland as a security to that dominion, arriving with a formidable fleet, seized the iles of Arran and Bute, and landed his army in the ssiire of Cunningham. Here he was encountered by the Scottish forces under their king Alexander, at Largs, in an obstinate battle, on the second of October. The victory is given by the Daniih historians to Haco, by the Sc ttissi to Alex- ander. Haco however suffered the consequences of a defeat. Llis fleet was on the next day dissipated by a storm, and he died at the Orkneys in his re- treat homeward, Discouraged by this disaster, Magnus the fifth, his son and successor, transferred to the king of Scotland, in 1266, his right of sovereignty over the Llebudes for the stun of four thousand marks payable in four years, and one ' hundred marks of quit rent annually ever after.

As the ilands also of Orkney and Shet land, possessed by the Norwegians, who long held the government of Caithness, Sutherland, and Ross, on the mainland, were totally independent of the Scottissi crown, the dominion of the kings of Scotland was in these ages not extensive. The political constitution and laws of this king dom were almost the fame with those of England, at least far more like them than they are at present, when both countries are united under one king, and into one realm. The causes of this conformity we cannot satisfactorily trace from the meagre chro nicles of the times. But, from his researches into ancient charters, the result of which he has given us in his Caledonia, Chalmers has found that nume rous grants of exttnsive tracts in the Lowlands were at different times made by successive monarchs to Norman or Englissi baron:--, who brought colonists from England, and built castles for their security. Edgar, who was the son of an Englissi princess, and was placed on the throne by an Englissi army, made gifts of this kind for the purpose of having around him, for the protection of his crown, a body of warlike nobles on whose fidelity he could depend.

HISTORY OF THE number of military tenants from the south. Even previously to the reigns of these princes, encou ragement had been given, for the improvement of the country, by Scottissi kings, to colonists from England ; but these were banissied in the time of Donald Baan. A jealous hatred of such settlers, long subsisted among the Scots, who attempted a univer sal massacre of them after the caption of William the lion. In the latter part, however, of the thir teenth century we find the language of the Scottissi court and nobles to be French, and the principal barons to be of French extraction, among whom were the Gordons, Monrgomeries, and Mowbrays. When the baronage of Scotland was consanguineous and quite similar to that of England, the similiafity of the laws of these two kingdoms is no longer sur prising. The nobles of both were derived from France, and vested with lands by military tenure. The friendly intercourse, which had so long sub sisted between the two British kingdoms, was ex changed for the most rancourous and lasting hostility, in consequence of events which took place after the death of Alexander the third, who was killed by a fall from his horse at Kinghorn, in the March of 1286. His only surviving descendant was Margaret, an infant granddaughter, called The Maid of Norway, the offspring of his daughter Margaret, late queen of Norway, and of Eric, the Norwegian monarch. To govern the kingdom during the minority of this princess, the undoubted heiress, and acknowledged queen of Scotland, a council of regency was appointed under the joint protection of Eric and of Edward the first of England. Having already conquered Wales, the"], [611, "BRITISH ILANDS. 83 the English monarch had formed the scheme of Chap. uniting all Britain into one kingdom by the marriage . _' * of prince Edward, his eldest son, with this infant queen. The Scottish parliament readily agreed to his proposals, and consented that their young queen should be educated in his court ; but bound him, under the penalty of a hundred thousand pounds payable to the pope, and of excommunication and interdict on his dominions, to the observance of all the articles of a treaty, made on this occasion, for the security of their country's independence. Beside other conditions, they stipulated, that Scotland {hould retain its own laws and officers of state : that, if Edward and Margaret should die without children by her, the Scottish kingdom should revert, completely independent, to the next heir : and that its parliament should never be summoned beyond the boundaries of Scotland. This treaty, which promised so great advantages to the two British kingdoms by their union under one monarch, was most unfortunately frustrated by the death of the princess, 1 290, in her voyage to Scotland from Norway. As the line of William the lion had become ex- \u00a3\u00b0\u2122foTthe tinct in the Maid of Norway, the right of succession |^* devolved to the posterity of his brother David, who rr \u2022 1291 had left three daughters, but no male offspring. l2i2' Margaret, the eldest of these, married to Alan, lord of Galloway, had left an only daughter, Der vorgilla, whose son, John Baliol, by a lord of that name, was a candidate for the crown. Isabella, the second in age, married to the lord of Annan dale, had a son, named, from his father, Robert Bruce,"], [612, "HISTORY OF THE 90 Chap. XXIV Edward's arbitration 1192, Bruce, who claimed the succession, as being one de gree nearer the common stock than Baliol, who was sprung from the elder branch. ' Between these two, though other claimants appeared, lay the only right of competition generally acknowledged by the Scots, who, espousing opposite parties, scented ready to decide the controversy by the sword. To prevent so great an evil, the parliament of Scotland, swayed by the custom of the age, and induced by the charac ter of Edward, who had already acquitted himself with honour, as an umpire in disputes between fo reign princes, agreed to leave the decision of the controversy to the arbitration of the Englissi monarch. Disappointed in his honest scheme of uniting Scotland to England by the treaty of marriage, Ed ward had resolved to seize the first opportunity of obtaining the same important object by fraud or force. Accepting therefore willingly the office of arbitrator, he caused privately strict search to be made in chro nicles and histories for proofs of an ancient feudal subjection of the Scottissi to the Englissi crown. The search was fruitless ; yet from fables and misquota tions a collection was made of futile arguments, and reduced formally to writing. Marching with a great army to the borders, and inviting the Scottissi par liament and competitors to the castle of Norham,. on the southern bank of the Tweed, he there an nounced to them his inherent prerogative of deter mining the controversy, as supreme liege lord of Scotland, produced his arguments, and demanded their acknowledgement of his title.

Even then the parliament, distracted and without a leader, made no determinate reply ; but the candidates all, anxious to acquire his favour, acknowledged, under their hands and seals, his right of sovereignty. That he might, he said, be enabled to put the successful competitor in possession of the kingdom without op position, he next demanded the custody of all the castles of Scotland, which were accordingly deliver ed to his troops. Having also taken the oaths of fealty of the Scottish barons, he took measures for the final determination of the contest. Of thirteen candidates the claims of Bruce and Baliol alone were admitted. The former had been the first, the latter the last, to acknowledge the sove- reignty of the English king. The discussion of the subject was committed to a council, appointed to sic at Berwick, composed of a hundred and sour com- missioners, forty nominated by each of the two can- didates, and twenty-four Englissimen by Edward. After a deliberation of three months, the commission- ers gave their opinion in favour of Baliol. With these concurred in sentiment the most celebrated law- yers in Europe, to whom was submitted the abstract question of the right of inheritance between the great grandson by the eldest daughter, and the grand- son by the second. Conformably to this decision, Edward, in the November of 1292, pronounced his sentence in favour of Baliol, who, on renewing his oath"], [614, "HISTORY OF THE 92 Chap, XXIV His con quest of Scotland 1296 oath of fealty to the Englissi crown, was put into full possession of the kingdom of Scotland with all its fortresses. The feudal subjection of Scotland, thus obtained by Edward, seems to have been regarded by him as merely a preparatory step to its absolute subjection, and incorporation into one kingdom with England. The end, which he proposed, was laudable and im- portant, but the means, which he employed for its attainment, were not less culpable. As if his design had been to enrage by insult his new feudatory into rebellion, that he might thence take occasion, by a sentence of forfeiture, to assume the immediate dominion of the Scottissi territories, he summoned Baliol six times in little more than twelve months, to appear before him and the Englissi parliament, to answer unimportant complaints of private persons ; and, denying him the privilege of pleading his cause by his attorney, he obliged him to stand at the bar as a common delinquent. Harrassed by citations, and stung with indignity, Baliol, though a prince of a gentle spirit, resolved to avail himself of the first opportunity of emancipation. On the occasion of a war between France and England in 1295, he made a private league with the French monarch, the commencement of a strict union, maintained during many ages after, from mutual interest, between the French and Scottissi kingdoms. Informed of this alliance, and resolving to subdue his domestic foe previously to his embarking in an expedition to the continent, Edward demanded from Baliol the fur rendry of the fortresses of Berwick, Jedburg, and Roxburg,"], [615, "M Chap. XXIV. BRITISH ILANDS. Roxburg, as a security for his peaceable behaviour ; and cited him to an Englissi parliament held at New castle. As the Scottissi king, who had been absolv ed from his oaths by the pope, declined his requisi tions, Edward advanced against him with an army stated at thirty thousand infantry and four thousand horse. Having little reliance on the abilities of Baliol, the Scottissi parliament appointed a council of twelve to assist him in forming arrangements for defense, in whom was in fact vested the sovereign power ; while some of the chief nobles, particularly Bruce, the late candidate, and his father, despairing of public safety amid internal distraction and formidable inva sion, hastened to acquire, by early submission, the favour of Edward, whose ultimate success seemed hardly doubtful. In the commencement of the war some apparent advantages were gained by the Scots, who, penetrating into Cumberland, burned the sub urbs of Carlisle : but the Englissi monarch, who had determined on a plan of most vigorous opera tions, crossed the Tweed at Coldstream ; took Ber wick with the slaughter of the garrison, said to have consisted of seven thousand ; reduced Roxburg ; and sent earl Warrenne, with a force of twelve thousand to besiege Dunbar, defended by the flower of the Scottissi nobility. The main army of Scotland, stated at forty thousand foot and five hundred caval xy, advancing to the relief of this important fortress, was assailed with so great a superiority of discipline and tactics by Warrenne, that it was totally routed with prodigious loss, on the twenty-seventh of April in"], [616, "04 Chap XX1V HISTORY OF THE in the year 1296. All the south of Scotland was quickly subdued ; and to penetrate the recesses of the north, for the completion of the conquest, con siderable bodies of Irish and Welch troops were brought to act in conjunction with the Englissi. Disgusted with his own subjects, and distrusting their fidelity, Baliol made a formal resignation of his person and crown to Edward, who, proceeding northward without resistance to Elgin in Noray, re ceived the submissions of all the Scottissi chiefs. The Englissi monarch, having completed, as he supposed, the conquest of Scotland, returned at length home ward, leaving the administration in the hands of Englissi officers, and an army under earl Warrenne to retain the country in subjection. He broke the great seal of Scotland, carried away the regalia, and a sacred stone, on which all the Scottissi kings re ceived the rite of inauguration, preserved at Scone with the utmost care, and venerated, as the true palladium of their monarchy, by the Scots, who were assured by an ancient tradition, that wherever this stone ssiould have been placed their nation ssiould always govern. To \u25a0obliterate the memorials of Scottissi independence, he is said to have destroyed the records of the kingdom, together wi.th all its an nals or chronicles.

Baliol, after an imprisonment of two years in the tower, was exiled into France, where he lived on a private estate, without ever intermeddling in affairs of government, and died in the year 1305. The acquisition of Scotland, most important to the Englissi crown, might doubtless have been pre served entire, if Edward had not withdrawn his troops, and personal superintendency to a foreign war. For the recovery of Guienne, a distant pro vince of no real value to England, this great mo narch, in other instances so wisely politic, lost the opportunity of securing an inestimable prize, and entailed on his kingdom a most destructive enmity. Earl Warrene, left governor of Scotland by Edward, on his expedition to Flanders, in his war against France, related in the preceding chapter, retired into England on account of his health, leaving the government in the hands of Ormessiy the justiciary, and Creffingham, the treasurer of the conquered country, with but a small body of troops for the enforcement of obedience. These officers are accu sed of such an abuse of power, as to make the Scots too ssiarply feel, as a subjugated people, all the ri gours of servitude. The bravest spirits of the na tion, vehemently exasperated against the Englissi government, soon found a leader for the most ardu ous or desperate attempts in William Wallace, a gentleman of respectable ancestry, but a small for tune, in the ssiire of Renfrew. This man, fays Hume, \" was endowed with a gigantic force of body, with"], [618, "10 Chap. XXIV HISTORY OF THE with heroic courage of mind, with disinterested mag nanimity, with incredible patience and ability to bear hunger, fatigue, and all the severities of the seasons. Beginning with small attempts, in which he was always successful, he gradually proceeded to more momentous enterprizes j and he discovered equal caution in securing his followers, and valour in an noying the enemy.\" Alarmed for the safety of his person, Ormesoy set the example of flight, which was quickly followed by the rest of the English. The news of their flight, from the terrour of the small bands under Wallace, roused the rest of the Scots, who, running every where to arms, prepared to combat with united force for the maintenance of their suddenly recovered freedom. To remedy with all possible speed the damage of his own misconduct, or that of his deputies, War renne, with an army, stated at forty thousand, levi ed hastily in the north of England, advanced rapid ly through Annandale against the Scots, before they were prepared for resistance, and terrified their no bles into a renewal of submission. Wallace and his adherents, retreating northward, took post on ad vantageous ground, at Cambuskenneth, on the nor thern side of the river Forth, whither he was pur sued by the Englissi commander. The latter, hav ing arrived at Stirling, yielding to the solicitations of Cressingham, contrary to the advice of men more judicious, commanded his army to cross the river by a bridge, and to assail the foe. \"Watching their motions, and prepared for this event, Wallace russi ed with irresistible impetuosity on a part of the Eng- lissi"], [619, "9; Chap XXIV Its second conquest 1298. 1304, \"BRITISH ILANDS. fish who had passed, and destroyed them in the sight of their associates on the opposite side of the river, who, by the breaking of the bridge, were unable to come to their assistance. Warrenne retreated home with a dispirited army, after this disaster, which happened on the eleventh of September in the year 1297. The body of Cressingham, found dead on the held of battle, was flayed by the Scots, and the ssiin worked into girths and saddles, in expression of their hatred. Appointed regent of Scotland, of which he was universally regarded as the deliverer, Wallace soon reduced the ill garrisoned fortresses of Roxburg and Berwick ; and, invading the north of England, collected spoil from the ravaged country, unresisted by the Englissi, who were distracted by intestine discord. By a truce with the king of France, who virtual- ly abandoned his alliance with Scotland, Edward, in the following year, was enabled to collect from England, Wales, and Ireland, a mighty force, sta- ted at eighty thousand foot and seven thousand ca- valry, with which he advanced against the Scots ; While a fleet with provisions for their supply sailed into the frith of Clyde. Sensible of the jealousy entertained against him by his compatriot nobles, Wallace had resigned the office of regent, and the chief power had devolved on two men of eminent birth, Comyn of Badenogh and the steward of Scot land, who, collecting all their forces, took post at Falkirk to aWait the onset of the Englissi.

The Scots, who retired into the northern parts, which Edward, obliged to return home by a scarcity of provisions, left for the present unsubdued, at tempted in the next year to recover the southern from the Englissi troops stationed in them for their security. Become formidable now by being enured to war, notwithstanding their great overthrow at Falkirk, they reduced the castle of Stirling, while the king was prevented from marching against them by his negociations with France, and the refractory conduct of his great barons. When, in the summer of 1300, he had advanced into Galloway, his pro gress was interrupted by a bull from the pope, who asserted that the temporal sovereignty of Scotland had always belonged to the Holy See, and command ed the Englissi monarch, if he could pretend to any claim, to send commissioners for the pleading of his cause at the Roman tribunal. To this most unfound ed pretension a most elaborate answer, after long consultations, and a solemn debate in parliament, was returned, in which the supremacy of the Englissi"], [621, "s? Chap XXIV 1301 1303 1303 1301, BRITISH ILANDS, English crown over Scotland was, on the vain foun dation of trifling arguments, affirmed, and its real independence from the pontifical authority, and from every other, with proper spirit asserted. After alternate truces and hostilities of no great moment, three divisions of an Englissi army under John de Segrave were separately defeated in succes sion, at Roslin near Edinburgh, on the twenty fourth of February in the year 1303, by an army under Sir Simon Fraser and John Comyn, the Scottissi regent ; in consequence of which the for tresses in the south were recovered by the Scots, and Edward had the work of conquest to begin anew. Having at length concluded a definitive treaty of peace with France, and reconciled -his discontented barons, the king of England was enabled to direct his whole force to the attainment of an object re garded by him justly as of the highest importance. Entering their territories with such an army as the Scots could not pretend to resist, which was regular ly supplied with provisions by a coasting fleet, he penetrated in two campaigns almost to the northern extremity of Scotland, receiving the submission of the nobles, including the regent, Comyn. The cas tles of Brechin and Sterling made obstinate defense. By the surrendry of the latter, the second conquest of the kingdom was completed in the summer of 1304.

The unworthy fate of this cham pion, all the . envy against whom was extinguished with his life, enflamed the indignation of the Scots, already indignant at the system of Edward's govern ment, who is supposed to have treated them with se verity. In this disposition of their minds a leader soon offered himself for a new revolt, of which the authentically recorded circumstances are few, sepa rated from the fictions of Scottissi writers, with some of which David LIume, more eloquent than veracious, has chosen to embeilissi this part of his history. When Baliol, Bruce, his competitor, and the eldest son of -the latter, were dead, Robert Bruce, grandson of the competitor, regarding himself as the indubitably rightful heir of the Scottissi monar chy, resolved on the arduous, the almost desperate attempt of establissiing by arms the independence of his country, and his scat upon its throne. He had accidentally a conference at Dumfries, in the church of the Minoritts, in the February of 1306, with Comyn, the late regent, one of the last who had submitted to Edward, and one whom he regarded as a rival. Their conversation is quite unknown, as it was quite unwitnessed ; but they disagreed in opinion and violently quarrelled. Comyn was wounded by the dagger of Bruce, and dispatched by Kirkpatrick, an"], [623, "40J Chap XXIV, 1307 Death of Edward. 130' BRITISH ILANDS.- an attendant of the latter, who russied into the apart ment on hearing the scuffle. Instantly Bruce and his partizans seized the castle of Dumfries, and the English judges assembled in the town hall; issued a manifesto ; sent emissaries on all sides ; collected an army, and advanced to Scone, where this leader was -crowned on the twent)vscventh of March. A stop was soon put to his progress, by Aymer de Valence, a general sent against him by Edward, who, assail ing him by surprize, at Methven near Perth, on the twenty-fourth of June, so routed his army, that, unable to keep the field, he took refuge with a few adherents in the Htbude ilands. Bruce again suddenly made his appearance at the head of a small body in Carrick, at Michaelmas ; but fled into the Highlands at the approach of an Englissi army ; whence he descended in the spring of the following year, gained some advantages in the field, and laid siege to the castle of Ayr,. Edward who had executed, as guilty of rebellion, a number of Scottissi nobles, among whom were three bro- thers of the new king, and who had procured a sen- tence of papal excommunication against all the ad- herents of that prince, commanded the assembling of his troops from all quarters at Carlisle, for the -final conquest of Scotland, which most probably would have been effected if he had lived to command the operations of the war : but, weakened by a dysentery, he expired in his tent, at Burgh on the sands, near Carlisle, on the seventh of July, in the sixty-ninth year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his \u25a0resen, enjoining his successor with his last breath, under"], [624, "HISTORY OF TftE 102 Chap, under pain of his malediction, to march his army XXIV \u2022 w _-_^, into Scotland, and to keep his body unburied until he ssiould have completed the conquest of that country.

To characterize more historians, cotemporary with this period, would be tedious ; and a mere list of their names would be useless. Almost a cotemporary was i homas Walsingham, a benedictine monk of Saint- Alban's about the year 1440, whose two works record some occurrences, not elsewhere found ; the Historia brevis of England from the conclusion of Henry the third's reign, and the Hypodigma Neustri\u0153, a historical account of Nor mandy, with a mixture of Englissi transactions, from the settlement of Rollo to the year 1418.

All the authentic matter of Scot tissi history from the year 1056, where Pinkerton's inquiry ends, to 137 1, is contained in the annals of Scotland, publissied in two volumes by Sir David Dalrimple, styled lord Hailes, in the latter part of the eighteenth century. We can expect little more than diligence and veracity from even the best historians who wrote in those times of ignorance. In England the Greek language was almost or altogether unknown ; and the knowledge of Latin had declined since the twelfth century, when it had been written with grammatical precision and in- classic style. Learning was confined to the clergy ; and, beside history, scarcely any other useful subject of study was pur sued with effect than the canon and civil law. The latter, the law of the Roman empire, contained in the Pandects of Justinian, in which it had been digested by that emperor in the sixth century, be came known among the western Europeans before the middle of the twelfth, and contributed power fully in process of time, by the dissemination of rational jurisprudence, to the melioration of civil society. But the literature of these dark ages con sisted chiefly in logic, metaphysics, and school divi nity, all cultivated in such manner as to be at least useless, rather pernicious, not at all directed to the discovery of truth, and calculated not to instruct, but to perplex the mind, and to give specious colourings to gross errors and absurdities, by sophisms, affected subtilties, and an unintelligible jargon"], [629, "feRITISH ILANDS. io7 jargon of artificial terms, indefinable and without Chap. meaning. From about the middle of the thirteenth xxv century the authority of Aristotle was regarded as an infallible criterion in philosophical disquisitions, as well as in logic : but the works of that great man were not otherwise known than through the medium of latin translations wretchedly erroneous, which co-operated with other causes to prevent the emancipation of the human intellect from thraldom. The ciphers, or numerical figures, universally now employed in Arithmetic, appear to have been originally invented by the Hindoos, the natives of Cisgangene India, and by them communicated to the Arabs ; though Villoison, in the second volume of his Grecian Anecdotes, has endeavoured to prove that they were used by the Greek and Latin arithmeticians. They were howeverquite unknown among the western Europeans until the knowledge of them was acquired from the Saracens in Spain, and imported into France, about the year 970, by the illustrious Gerbert, who was preceptor to king Robert the first of France, and to the emperor Otho the third of Germany, and who was afterwards elevated to the dignity of pope under the name of Sylvester the second. Till about the middle of the thirteenth century they seem to have been little used in England, where the clumsy mode of computing by the letters of the alphabet was long retained.

A prodigy of parts and industry in this period was Roger Bacon, a friar of the Franciscan order, who was bom near lichester in the year 1214, and died at Oxford in i 292. Despising the beaten paths of barren study, he rendered himself completely master of the Greek language, as a key to the literary treasures of the ancients, and applied him self to experiments for new discoveries. In these experiments he expended, in the course of twenty years, a sum equal in efficient value lo thirty thou sand pounds of our money at present, with which he was supplied by the liberality of his friends and patrons. Fiom the works of this great philosopher still extant we see that very much, which has been attributed to the invention of others in limes poste rior, had actually been discovered by his most laborious investigation ; as a great part of the theory of optics in its several branches ; the telescope, microscope, and various mathematical and astrono mical instruments ; modes of combining and apply ing mechanic powers for the performance of opera tions which might seem supernatural ; and various preparations in chymistry, particularly the com position of gunpowder, which he clearly describes, except that he has transposed the letters of one of the components, the charcoal, to prevent so dan gerous a combustible from being too commonly known. That a man of so exalted an intellect, far the greatest philosopher of his time, believed in astrology, and in the power of alchymy to transmute metals"], [631, "10!) Chu'. XXV, Arts.

Believing from ignorance, or pre tending from envy to believe, that he was conversant in magic, the monks of his order confined both his person and writings, permitting the latter to be seen only by the pope. After an imprisonment of several years, he obtained some indulgence by the interpo sition of pope Clement the fourth ; but he was soon again committed to durance, whence, after about eleven years, he was released, a little before his death, by pope Nicholas the fourth, at the earnest intercession of a number of nobles. Notwithstanding the generally wrong direction of the mind in fruitless disquisitions, for which great numbers of schools and colleges were establissied throughout Europe, literature, how very flow soever in its advances, was in a state of progression from about the end of the eleventh century. Among the causes of this was the art of making paper, a product of manufacture much cheaper than parch ment, which, by rendering books more easily purchasable, augmented their number. From China, where it had been in use from time immemorial, the manufacture of paper was communicated to the Tartars of Samarcand and Bochara in the seventh century, and thence to the Arabs, from whom it was"], [632, "110 HISTORY OF THE Chap.

Ano ther kind, made from the Egyptian plant, papyrus, had been in use among the ancient Romans, and, after them, among other Europeans ; but the im portation of it ceased on the conquest of Egypt by the Saracens in the seventh century. By a practice which originated from the want of paper, but which was long continued after the introduction of that material, many literary works of the ancients have partially or wholly perissied, among which particularly we deplore the loss of the far greater por tion of the inestimable history and annals of Tacitus. To procure parchment, on which they might copy their missals, legends, and lives of saints, the igno rant monks often erased the writings of the ancients, with a stupid indifference to their value, from the books repofited in the libraries of their monasteries. Yet we must with gratitude acknowledge, that the precious portion, preserved to us, of ancient litera ture, we owe entirely to the care of the Romissi clergy, of whom generally some were not insensible of its value, and whose monasteries were rendered secure by superstitious awe in times of turbulence, when from superstition alone they could hope for protection. Since literature and the arts conjointly either flourissi cr languissi, the fame state of society foster ing or discouraging both alike, we can expect among the inhabitants of Britain in this period little pro gress in arts, or acquaintance with their productions. The"], [633, "BRITISH ILANDS. 111 Chap.

Cloth of silk, and various other products of foreign workmanssiip, were in use with the nobles and richer citizens, though excessively dear ; but the art of weaving was practised to so little extent then in England, that most of the wool was exported unwrought to the Netherlands, whence much of it was again imported by the Englissi in its manufactured state. Clocks and watches, by whom invented we know not, were known in Britain from the latter part of the thirteenth century. The first clock, of which we find mention, was placed in the old clock-tower, opposite to the gate of Westminster-hall, in the year 1288; and the next four years after, in the cathe dral of Canterbury, purchased for thirty pounds, near five hundred in value of our money now. Watches were doubtless somewhat later.

Such a rage prevailed in Europe in the thirteenth and four teenth centuries, for the building of religious fabricks, as the purchase of salvation, that, to render the number of workmen adequate to the demand, the pope issued bulls of indulgence, by which frater nities of artificers were establissied, styled freemasons, who formed encampments, till their works were finished, under strict regulations, in the several places where they were employed. A rage had prevailed more early, as the reader may have already observed in this work, for the building of castles, fortresses for protection against lawless force in times of feudal anarchy, or against the legitimate power of the sovereign, or against invasions of foreign foes. Such had been in use among the Anglo-Saxons, but far inferior as well in number, as in magnitude, strength, and com modiousness of plan, to those which were erected after ihe conquest by the Anglo-Normans.

This wall was environed by a broad and deep ditch ; and the principal gate and drawbridge were defended by an outwork termed the barbacan. Castles of primary magnitude were furnissied with a second wall and ditch, inclosing at some distance the former, and of the fame kind.

But Edward immediately displayed two symptoms, decisive_and disastrous, of an infirm, unmanly spirit, and incapacity for government, military and civil. Piers de Gavaston, son of a Gascon knight, had, on account os the pernicious ascendancy acquired over the mind of this prince by his insinuating ad dress, been banissied by the late king, who had also obliged the prince to take an oath, or solemn pro mile, that he would never recall him. Edward, on. the death of his father, in violation of this most solemn and salutary engagement, sent instantly for Gavaston, with a thoughtless resolution of heaping on him riches, honours, and power, with boundless prodigality. He was equally regardless of the so lemn injunction of his dying parent with respect to Scotland. Having given orders for his father's fune ral, he began his march, after a delay of three weeks at Carlisle, and advanced unresisted into the Scottish territories to Cumnock in Ayrssiire ; whence, eager for the enjoyment of indolence in the compa ny of his favourite, he returned into England in the beginning of September, dispersing his army, and leaving Aymer de Valence with a force inadequate to maintain the Englissi dominion.

He united him to the royal family by giv ing his niece in marriage to him.

On his return to England he bestowed on him all the rich presents which he had received from the French king at his marriage.

In ssiort he seemed to act -as if he regard ed the exaltation of the favourite as the sole purpose of his reign. A most disgusting weakness was thus demon strated by the conduct of the king, which blasted at once the hopes of his people. He is said to have strikingly resembled the great monarch, his father, in the stature, strength, and beauty of his person ; but unfortunately the resemblance extended not to the mind. From indolence he divested himself of the cares of government. From I 2 indifference"], [638, "HISTORY OF THE 116 Chap.

He seems not to have been desti tute of personal courage, but of resolution or firm ness. He appears to have been illiberal and not free from cruelty ; to have been giddy, passionate, and loquacious ; yet on the whole amount rather frivo lous than wicked : but the great and strikingly prominent feature of characteristic distinction was his immeasurable and inviolable attachment to favourites. Gavaston, who from this enormous frailty, acquired the government of the king and kingdom, was possess ed of splendid qualities natural and acquired ; an ex traordinary elegance of ssiape and general beauty of person ; a nobleness of mien and graceful manners ; an uncommon dexterity and address in all the war like and fassiionable exercises of the age ; and a promptness in sallies of wit, in which the Gascons have been commonly reputed to excels But, , while by such accomplishments he acquired on unbounded influence over his puerile sovereign, he was not en dowed with solid virtue or with prudence to render his unexampled ascendancy palatable to the nation.

A violent hatred of the presumptuous foreigner pervaded the Englissi nobility and the public in gene ral. Disorders, which had been repressed by the wisdom and abilities of the late monarch, began every where to revive, as the regal authority met only with contempt in the hands of the reigning sovereign, only with disgust in those of his minion. Thomas, earl of Lancaster, cousin-german to the king, and sirst prince of the blood, became the head of a confederacy of barons, who brought with them such an armed force to parliament, that the king, utterly unable to oppose them, was constrained to consent to the banissiment of Gavaston, who was obliged to bind himself by an oath never to return, and was by the bissiops pronounced excommunicated unless he ssiould immediately depart from the king dom. But Edward, instead of sending him home to Guienne, appointed him lord lieutenant of Ire land ; conferred on him new estates ; accompanied him as far as Bristol in his journey ; obtained from the pope for him an absolution from his oath ; made such exertions to appease the barons as to prevail on them to consent in parliament to his recall after a year's absence ; and flew to receive him, on his land ing at Chester, with transports of joy. The discontents were by the fame causes renewed, as neither the king nor his favourite had learned wis dom from experience. Summoned twice to parlia ment, the confederate barons declined attendance. Summoned"], [640, "1 IS Chap.

Their ordonnances, in general salutary, were confirmed by a parliament held in London in the August of the following year ; but the king entered secretly a protest against them, chiefly because the removal of evil counsellors was decreed, by which many were excluded by name from being intrusted with offices of power or profit, and Gavaston was ordered into perpetual banissi ment. Retiring soon after to York, Edward recalled his favourite from the Netherlands, the place of his ex ile ; declared by proclamation his banissiment illegal ; and reinstated him in all his pomp and authority. Alarmed for their safety, the confederates flew to arms. On the approach of the troops under the earl of Lancaster, the general of the confederacy, the king and his favourite, who had been thought lessly enjoying, as usual, their festive pleasures, fled through Newcastle to Tinmouth, and thence by sea to t-carborough. In the castle of the last, which was deemed impregnable, Gavaston remained, while the king hasted to York to raise an army. Besieged in this"], [641, "BRITISH ILANDS. 119 Chap XXV 1313 Scottish war. 1 307 1314 this fortress, Gavaston surrendered, from a failure of provisions, to Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke, on terms which might seem to secure his personal safety. Left by this earl, perhaps from design, in the castle of Deddington in Oxford shire, he was thence taken forcibly by the earl of Warwick, and was, by command of Lancaster and other chiefs, beheaded on Blacklow-hill near Warwick, without regard to his capitulation, and without a trial in form. Transported with the most furious resent ment, the king made efforts with unusual spirit to raise forces for the overthrow and punissiment of his favourite's murderers . but, having lost the general affection of his subjects, he had so little success, that he found himself in danger of being overwhelmed by a superior force, and was induced to give ear to proposals of accommodation, which, after many de lays, was at length completed in a parliament held at Westminster in the September of 13 13. Accord ing to the terms of this treaty, the offending barons performed the humiliating ceremony of imploring the royal mercy on their knees, and received a full pardon for all crimes whatsoever. When the domes tic dissentions, which had so long diverted the atten tion of the English from the affairs of Scotland, were thus composed, all parties united in a formidable effort for the reconquest of that country. By the fatal dereliction of the Scottissi war by Edward, at the commencement of his reign, the opportunity, never again recoverable, had been lost, of subjecting Scotland to the Englissi crown. Ro- bert"], [642, "HISTORY OF THE 120 Chap XXV bert Bruce, restored to health, had issued from his retreat, and, unopposed by any effective EngHssi force, had acted with such energy, as, in the space of three years, to destroy, subdue, or drive into exile, all the Scots attached to the Englissi interest ; to reduce most of the fortresses ; and even to make wasteful incursions into the neighbouring parts of England. Roused at length from his ignominious lethargy, Edward marched against him into Scot land, in the year 1310, as far as Linlithgo ; and, in the succeeding year, sent his troops under Gavaston, who penetrated far into the country ; but Bruce, each time, retiring northward, avoided a battle; and the Englissi, ill furnissied with provisions, returned home without advantage. By the subsequent com motions of England, in which Gavaston fell, Bruce, who had been generally acknowledged king by the Scots, and even by foreign nations, had seizure to establissi order in his kingdom and to consolidate his power ; in so much that when at length, after seven years of languid and intermitting warfare, a serious invasion was resolved for his overthrow, he was en abled to oppose it with a competent army. The Englissi monarch, who had, so seasonably for his opponent, . deferred his great enterprize until the very time when it could be resisted, made vast pre parations, reinforcing his Englissi host with troops from Ireland, Wales, and Guienne. The whole, greatly exaggerated by Scottissi writers, may perhaps have consisted of sixty thousand combatants. The fortresses of Berwick, Dunbar, and Stirling still remained in the hands of the Englissi. In the siegfj"], [643, "BRITISH ILANDS. 121 siege of the last were the Scots engaged when the Chap. army of king Edward, led by him in person, ap- XXV. proached them from Berwick. An advantageous B Je of position was chosen by Bruce, two miles to the south Ban\"\u00b0ck- . . . burn, of Stirling, having a mountain on his right, a mo- June is, rass on his left, and the rivulet called Bannock-burn 1314. in front, along the banks of which he had caused pits to be digged, and stakes fixed in them, tharpen ed at top, and artfully concealed with a covering of sods or russies. His army amounted to not more than thirty thousand ; but his advantage lay in the strength of his position, and still far more in the un bounded confidence reposed by his followers in his courage, wisdom, and skill. This confidence he confirmed by a deed of prowess in the evening before the day of battle. In a ssiirmissi with some Englissi cavalry he clove Henry de Bohun to the chin with a battleaxe in the sight of both armies. The awful interval of the night is said to have been spent in prayer by the Scots, in riotous mirth by the Englissi, among whom we find no marks of military conduct, and who appear to have been vainly confident in their numbers, without any confidence in their royal commander. Early in the morning the vanguard of the Englissi cavalry, russiing precipitately to the attack, fell among the pits, and were thrown into confusion, while their leader, the earl of Glocester, nephew to king Edward was slain. Charged in the decisive mo ment by the Scottissi van under Sir James Douglas, the whole body of horse was put to flight. When from this event, utterly unexpected, as the army of Edward"], [644, "HISTORY OF THE 122 ClJAF XXV Edward was far superior in number and appointment of horsemen, the Englissi infantry were struck with astonissiment, they saw, as they imagined, at the fame time, a new army of Scots, of which they had received no previous intimation, advancing along the hills on their left with a seeming design to surround them ; as Bruce, for deception, had ordered the waggoners and other attendants of his camp to march with military ensigns in such manner as to give, at proper distance, the shew of a considerable body of troops. Seized with a sudden panic, a consequence of great distrust in the wisdom or abilities of their commander, the entire line of infantry, throwing away their arms, fled in extreme disorder, not only without the least attempt to strike a blow, but even without awaiting the approach of the enemy. If the Scots had not been delayed by the plunder of a camp, furnissied even to profusion for a long cam- paign, very few of the flying troops could have escaped, as the length of their march was eighty miles to a place of safety. The loss however was prodigious, the greatest ever sustained by England in any defeat since that of Hastings. From a com parison of accounts and other circumstances not less than a third of the army seems to have been killed or captured. Among the prisoners were above four hundred nobles and gentlemen. Edward, who had taken no precaution either for the gaining of a vic tory, or the securing of a retreat, escaped with great difficulty to Dunbar, whence he proceeded by sea to Berwick.

England was now in a deplorable condition, dejected by defeat, wasted by famine, and filled with alarms by an army of Scots, who ravaged, with little resistance, the nor- thern parts, while renovated faction prevented effec- tive measures to oppose their progress. The earl of Lancaster and his principal associates, who, from ap- prehensions, real or pretended, of murderous designs against them, had declined to accompany the king in his Scottissi expedition, revived their ordonnances after his discomfiture, and possessed themselves of the chief power. This nobleman was suspected, on grounds highly probable, of having entered into a private agreement with Bruce ; as, by his declining to attend, when troops were assembled at favourable opportunities for attacking the Scots, he frustrated the design. In exchange for some of his captives Bruce recovered his wife, daughter, and sister, with many lords and gentlemen, all of whom had re- mained prisoners in England since the time of the late Edward. By the ransomes of the rest great sums were acquired, which, with the prodigious plunder of the camp, tended to enrich his kingdom and augment his financial strength.

This deputy was Hugh de Lacy, son of the late brave officer of that name, nominated by the caprice of prince John, to whom his brother, king Richard the first, engaged in foreign wars, abandoned the administration of this iland during his whole reign, according to the commission of the late king, by which prince John had been created lord of Ireland.

The vanity of this warrior, who affected to restore the monarchy of Ireland, was raised high by the success of a battle, which in fact was much more glorious to (he vanquissied than to the victors. Armoric of Saint-Lawrence, with a band of thirty horsemen and two hundred infantry, on his march to join De Courcey through a territory of Cathal, was intercepted by a numerous army commanded by that prince. As a retreat was impracticable, except by the cavalry, who after some hesitation resolved to share the fate of their companions, a determination was formed that, with exception of two, who were appointed to view the scene from an eminence, and to give an account to De Courcey, all should perissi fighting, and sell their lives as dearly as possible. The cavalry, plunging their swords into their horses to deprive the foe of such a booty, embodied with the foot ; and the whole band moved onward with a face of such composure and confidence as astonish- ed the hostile army.

XXVI, 1200. 120S. warrior, whose father had been an illegitimate sort of king Henry the first by Nesta, the mother of Fitzstephen and Fitzgerald. Unassisted by king John, who had succeeded Richard, Fitzhenry was during some time unable to make efficacious exertions. Meanwhile Englissi lords as well as Irissi, acting as independent, made Wars and coalitions. William de Burgo, having possessed himself of Limerick, ex- pelled Cathal from Connaught, and placed Carragh O'Connor on the throne, 'she combined forces of De Courcey, De Lacy, and Hugh O'Nial of Tir- owen, espousing the quarrel of the expelled prince, were defeated with- great slaughter by those of Car- ragh and De Burgo. Cathal, recurring to artifice, prevailed on De Burgo to consent to his restoration. Carragh died bravely fighting ; and Cathal repaid with perfidy the injustice of the baron, who, in at- tempting to punissi his breach of engagement, was repulsed with disgrace. He was recalled from a second attempt by the news of the chief governor's opeiations, who had at length found means to collect an army for the enforcement of obedience, and was marching to Limerick. In this expedition, the first in which an Englissi chief governor was seen leading native Irissi against his own compatriots, Fitzhenry was assisted by the troops of Connaught and Tho- mond. De Burgo, capitulating, was admitted to renew his allegiance, and both Cathal and O'Brien of Thomond entered into treaties of submission. De Courcey in Ulster, assailed by the Irissi and by Walter and Hugh de Lacy, found himself oblig ed., though victorious in battle, to submit to the performance"], [650, "128 HISTORY OF THE Chap. XXVI King John's expedition. 1210. performance of homage, giving sureties for his ap* pearance in the royal presence, and receiving a safe conduct for his journey. Of this warlike baron, who seems to have died soon after, we have no fur ther information. His title of earl of Ulster, toge ther with his estates in that province, was conferred by the unjust monarch on Hugh de Lacy, in preju dice to Milo de Courcey, the lawful heir. No other transactions occur worth mention here till the expe dition of king John into this iland, the real motive of which, together with the fate of William de Braofa's family, I have already noted in my twenty first chapter. To punissi Braosa and the two Lacies was the ostensible purpose. The latter had abused the power derived from his own unrighteous dona tions. The only exploit of a military nature performed in Ireland by this monarch, who arrived in Dublin, in the June of 1210, and remained three months in the country, was the reduction of the fortresses in Meath and Ulster belonging to the Lacies, who, as well as Braosa, took refuge in France. The Irissi princes made submissions without thereby becoming more subject than before. O'Nial of Tir-owen re fused to attend the king till two hostages were given him for the security of his safe conduct, and on his return to his own territories, disclaimed with impu nity all idea of subjection. Regulations of a civil nature were the chief benefits resulting to the Eng lissi colony from this visit. A regular code and char ter of English laws was, at the general request of his liegemen in Ireland, ordained in this kingdom, and"], [651, "BRITISH ILANDS. 129 Chap XXVI State of the country. and deposited for their direction in the exchequer os Dublin, under the royal seal, uniting, as it were, his subjects in Ireland under the fame system of poli ty with his subjects in Britain. For the more effec tual execution of these laws, beside the establissi ment of the king's courts of judicature in Dublin, a new and more ample division was made of the king's lands into counties, where sheriffs and other officers were appointed. Twelve counties only are enumerated as formed on this occasion, which mark ed the Englissi territories as containing parts of Leinster, Munster, and Ulster : but either then, or soon aster, three others were added, two in Con naught, and one in South-Munster. The situation of affairs was so greatly altered since the commencement of Meyler Fitzhenry's ad ministration, that a prince less indolent than king John, and more secure in the love of his people, might at this time have reduced all the iland under Englissi government. The colonies had become so extended, so fortified with castles like those of Eng land, and so firmly establissied, as to be little molest ed by the natives, engaged as they were in mutual hostilities. The great English barons of Ireland were also quite in subjection to the crown. The Lacies witn difficulty obtained restoration on the pay ment of sums equal in efficient value to near seventy thousand pounds at present. In the year 12 17, after John's decease, the Great Charter of that monarch, renewed in England, was extended to Ireland, with some alterations required for local circumstances, and still more of the aristocratic spirit so blamed in Vol. II. K the"], [652, "HISTOEY OF THE 130 Cimp XXVI Renewal of disorders. 1219 the original. By this instrument, still extant, the union of the English colonists in Ireland with their fellow-subjects in Britain was clearly establissied. William, earl Mareschal, protector in the mi nority of Henry the third, who had married a daugh ter of Strongbow and the princess Eva, their only offspring, was owner of extensive property in Ire land, where the loyalty of the nobles was encourag ed by the hopes of his favour, and their turbulence awed by his vigilance and vigour. On his decease in 1219 disorders recommenced, from which for ages after we scarcely find even temporary cessations. From this time till the Scottissi invasion in the reign of Edward the second, a period of ninety-six years, the annals of Ireland are a confused mass of desul tory wars, and other petty transactions of Irissi chiefs and Englissi barons, the latter degenerated almost to the condition of the former, acting as independent princes, and frequently engaged in hostilities among themselves as well as against the native lords. So unprosperous a state of Irissi affairs was permitted by the weakness of Henry, and by the great occupations elsewhere of his warlike successor. From a chaos of small events I can select only a few consistently with my plan. Richard, earl Mareschal, grandson of Strongbow and of Eva by his mother, was enticed to a confer ence, and murdered, in the plains of Kildare, in 1234, by a number of barons, who had been en gaged to conspire for that purpose by Peter de Roches, prime minister of Henry the third, on the authority of letters patent, under the royal seal, granting"], [653, "BRITISH ILANDS. 131 Chap XXVI granting all the Irissi estates of Richard to the con spirators, on condition of their transmission of his body, dead or alive, to the king. By the fall of De Roches, which, together with his motives for this plot, is related in my twenty-second chapter, the conspirators were disappointed of their expected prize. Gilbert, a brother of the murdered baron, was invested with his estates and dignity. Previously to this affair violent commotions had arisen in Con naught, where, after various turns of fortune in contests for the throne, Fedlim, a son of Cathal, at length prevailed by the favour of king Henry, to whom he made in person a complaint against De Burgo. Not ungrateful for this kindness, Fedlim was the only one of above twenty Irish princes, sum moned to assist the king in an invasion of Wales, about the year 1245, who went to his aid : and, aster his return to Ireland, he joined his troops with those of the king's vicegerent to reduce the chiefs of Tirconnel. Among the violent contests, which agi tated the country, was a feud between the houses of De Burgo and Fitzgerald, in which Richard de Ca pella, the chief governor, suspected of partiality to the former, was seized at a conference by the latter, in 1264, and for some time imprisoned. This iland might have been happily reduced into a state of peaceable subjection, if a project formally commenced had been really executed, a project of rendering prince Edward, who was afterwards king, the resident lord and actual governor. In 1253 a grant was made to him of the lordssiip of Ireland : but neither his intended residence nor effective super- K 2 intendcnce"], [654, "i'3_f Cbi' XXVI _*etitior._ lor English laws. HISTORY OF THE intendence ever took place. Though sometimes partly curbed by the interference of government, particularly in Sir John Wogan's administration in 1295, and Piers Gavaston's in 1308, the feuds of Englissi lords and Irish clans continued to subsist to the unspeakable detriment of the kingdom. In the commission of atrocities in these barbarous times the clergy also bore a part. The petition of Margaret le Blunde of Cassiel to Edward the first represents, that David Macmackerwait, bishop of Cassiel, had killed her father, and starved to death in prison her grandfather, mother, and her fix brothers and sisters ; that he withheld her inheritance in defiance of legal decrees in her favour ; retained a body of robbers in support of his tyranny ; and fulminated the sentence of excommunication against the mem bers of the king's council, as often as they attempt ed to take cognizance of the offense. From such an instance the lawless condition of Ireland at this period may be more easily conceived than from a general description. Yet, though the English laws were so outrageously infringed, as to afford but a slender protection to the colonists who lived under their authority, the case was still worse with the Irissi, who lived under a different system, their ancient laws, and had no legal claim to the privileges of the Englissi constitution. This disad vantage was so severely felt, especially by those whose lands were bordered or surrounded by the lands of the colonists, that repeatedly petiiions to the throne were sent, earnestly soliciting admission to the pro tection of the Englissi law, or, in other words, a change"], [655, "BRITISH ILANDS. 133 Ch^p. XXVI Parliament- change of condition from tributaries to subjects. By elpecial favour a few were admitted by royal patents. To Edward the first was offered, in 1278, through his vicegerent Uffbrd, a sum exceeding in value eighty thousand pounds now, for the extension of this right to all the Irissi within the Pale. Not withstanding the most peremptory orders from the king for the carrying of so salutary a measure into execution, his good intentions were frustrated by the intrigues of the colonial chiefs. The properties and lives of the Irissi, unprotected by the laws of England, the acceptance of which they had. at first ignorantly declined, were exposed to the violence of the colonial barons and their dependents, who chose unwisely to retain a delusive privilege rather than to contribute to such a settlement as would ultimately redound to their own solid benefit and security. Colonial parliaments, representatives of the Eng lissi inhabitants in Ireland, were in this period several times convened ; but the first, which had the ap pearance of a regular parliament, was one summoned in 1295 by Sir John Wogan, composed of lords spiritual and temporal, and knights, two from each county and each liberty, or privileged district in cluded in .a county. From the remedies decreed by this assembly we searn the abuses then subsisting. ri he lords marchers neglected their duty of defend ing the Englissi borders; the absentee barons con tributed nothing for the protection of their tenants : the colonists united not for mutual protection against the common enemy : the barons with bands of idle retainers made lawless exactions : hostile incursions were"], [656, "ft I'll AT.

Wogan in Vain endeavoured, in his second ad ministration, to preserve the public peace by the summoning of parliaments, when the haughty spirits of the barons had risen to such a height, that \"Richard de Burgo had held a court in the town of Trim, as an independent prince, and conferred the honour of knighthood in regal style. This baron, entering Thomond with an army for the enforcement of some claim?, was encountered by the Geraldines, the descendants of Maurice Fitzgerald, conducted by Richard de Glare, and, on the total route of his forces, remained a prisoner with the enemy. Con ditions were imposed by the victorious party, and an accommodation ensued which ended in a matri monial alliance.

But in the reign of Edward the second the hatred ot the Irissi to the government of England, which lest them to be treated as outlaws by the colonists, was much gratified by the successful war of the Scots against the Englissi. Ambassadors were sent from Irissi chieftains, particularly those of Ulster, inviting an invasion of the Scots, and offering to Robert Bruce the monarchy of Ireland. To gratify the ambition of his brother Edward, his associate in military toils, Robert advised that prince to accept in his place the offer of the Irissi crown, and fur nissied him with a Scottissi army to enforce his claim. After a premature and unsuccessful attempt, Edward landed with six thousand soldiers, from three hundred small vessels, on the north-eastern coast of Ulster, on the twenty-fifth of May in the year 1315. These forces, joined with those of the Ulto nian lords, the Irissi chiefs of Ulster, fell with the fury of a devouring tempest on the Englissi settle ments in that quarter, wasting all before them with slaughter and fire. Though cattle was the chief wealth of the inhabitants, the agriculture of Ireland was then, in comparison of times past and lome ages after, in a flourishing state among the Englissi set lers. Several tracts were not only cultivated, but adorned also with edifices, and plantations of fruit trees. While"], [658, "1S6 Chap, XXVI 1516 HISTORY OF TIIK While the fair improvements of Ulster were obliterated by these ferocious bands, and Atherdee, Dundalk, and other towns laid in allies, Richard de Burgo, earl of Ulster, reinforced by the troops of Fedlim, prince of Connaught, marched against them from Athlone, declining the assistance of Edmund Butler, the lord deputy, and declaring that his own force was more than sufficient for the enemy's overthrow. The enemy indeed retired northward before him, unable to find subsistance in a wasted country ; but he gained no decisive advan tage in his progress, and is said to have received a severe check near Colerain.

Here the young king was eager to assail them, notwithstanding their strong post, but was overruled by Mortimer. On the other side Douglas formed the bold design of capturing or kill ing Edward in the midst of his army. Having sur veyed the disposition of the English troops, and learned their watchword, he entered their camp at midnight with two hundred determined followers ; but the young king fighting bravely at his tent, escaped in the dark, and Douglas was glad to avail himself of the same cover for his own retreat in the general alarm.

Deceived by a report artfully circulated, that the late king was still alive in secret imprisonment, the earl of Kent began to form a plot for his restoration to the throne. When this was proved to a servile par liament, the tool of the prevailing faction, the earl was condemned to death and confiscation, and was execut ed before the young king had an opportunity to inter pose in favour of his uncle. The earl of Lancaster was thrown into prison, and other members of the -coalition prosecuted, to the enrichment of Morti mer's partizans, and the depression of his enemies; but by such violence he hastened his own destruc tion. The young king, in the eighteenth year of his age, desirous to free himself from the shackles of pupillage under his mother and her favourite, found noblemen enough to aid his design ; but was obliged to use the fame caution and secrecy as the conductor of a plot against a lawful sovereign. In the castle of Notting ham, strongly guarded by the adherents of. the obnoxious chief, Mortimer was seized in his bed, \u25a0in a chamber adjoining to that of the queen, by a party secretly admitted by Sir William Eland the governor, through a subterranean passage, long bu ried in rubbish, and unknown to the guards.

Notwithstanding Edward's youth, his subjects quickly felt the salutary effects of his having taken the reins of government into his own hands. He made the most vigorous exertions for there-establish ment of obedience to the laws, for the destruction of robbers, the dissolution of illegal combinations, and the correction in general of all disorders, which had become inveterate by a long continued weakness, of administration since the time of the first Edward, his grandfather.

Edward Baliol, the son of that John who had once been king of Scotland, was by them brought from Normandy, where he had resided as a private man on his patrimonial estate, to claim the Scottish crown by hereditary right. Choosing to invade by sea to elude the armed opposition on the borders, they embarked with about two thousand four hundred men at Ravenspur, and landed in Fife. Though disap pointed in their hopes of being joined by the ancient friends of the Baliols, they advanced intrepidly with their little force. Having routed the troops who opposed their debarcation, they crossed the river Ern in the night ; surprised the camp of Donald earl of Marr, the regent, who had collected aa army stated at forty thousand; put to flight this numerous body ; and completed their victory in the morning by a second onset on the rallying Scots, who were rushing tumultuoufly to renew the com bat. Only thirty men are said to have been slain in this battle on the side of Baliol ; on that of the Scots not less than twelve thousand, among whom was the regent and the flower of. their nobility. Astonishment and dismay pervaded the nation : the minor king and his betrothed consort were sent for safety to France : an army, not inferior in number to the former, led to besiege the English in Perth, dispersed from want of subsistence : the nobles, most exposed to danger, successively submitted : Baliol was crowned at Scone, and granted a general truce until"], [674, "152 HISTORY OF THE Chap.

Scotland, thus reduced into submission to Baliol by a handful of men, might doubtless have still been retained under his authority by the maintenance of a moderate force, if standing armies had then been in use, and money been furnished for the pur pose. Most probably from a financial failure, Baliol, who had ssiewed neither want of spirit nor of capa pacity in his military operations, dismissed, on the appearance of a tranquil state of affairs, most of his English followers, and retired to Annan with a slender retinue. Here, in open violation of the truce, he was suddenly attacked in the night, and with difficulty escaped, almost naked, on a horse without a saddle, to Carlisle, leaving his brother John and other attendants dead. The English monarch, who had given no public sanction to the invasion made by his nobles, now openly espoused the cause of Baliol, who had offered to renew the homage of the Scottissi monarchy to the crown of England. Leading a formidable army to Berwick, he pressed the siege with such vigour, that the governor agreed to surrender the place if he should not have been relieved before the twentieth of July. Apprised of this capitulation, the Scottish army, under lord Archibald Douglas, the regent, advanced on the nineteenth to attack the English, who were embattled on Hallidown-hill, a mile distant from the town on the northwest quarter.

They were pursued with dreadful carnage, particularly by a body of Irissi under lord Darcy, who seem to have given little or no quarter. Near thirty thou sand are said to have been slain : the regent had fallen at the first onset ; and almost all the nobles of his faction, who escaped the sword, were captured ; while the English army, inferior in number, is said to have lost only fifteen men. From Berwick, which immediately surrendered, Baliol, with a part of the Englissi army, on Edward's return homeward, proceeded without opposition into Scotland, where his title to the crown, with its feudal subjection to that of England, was formally acknowledged by a parliament convened at Perth. In the June of the following year he performed homage to Edward at Newcastle, and ceded to him all the southeastern counties of Scotland, including Edinburg, to be for ever united to the kingdom of England. Detesting Baliol, whom they regarded as no other than the tool of their determined foe, the Scots flew to arms, when the Englissi troops were withdrawn, and under Sir Andrew Moray, chosen regent, almost expelled him from the coun try Edward, with a vengeful spirit excited by their obstinacy, made successive invasions in 1335 and the following year.

On the death of Charles the fair, king of France, in 1328, Philip de Valois, his cousin german, the next male heir in the male line, had succeeded him on the throne with the universal acquiescence of the nation. Edward, then only fifteen years of age, had con- ceived himself entitled to that succession in right of Isabella, his mother, the sister of Charles. But, by custom esiablissied without interruption through cine centuries, and even lately by positive law, all females were excluded from the throne of France, nor was any right of succession admitted in males descended in a female line. Besides, if a female right ssiould be allowed, others stood before Edward in the order of succession. Utterly unprepared at that time to assert his claim, the young monarch had obeyed a summons to perform homage to Philip for Guienne, which would otherwise have been for feited, and had thus in the most ample form recog nized that prince as the legitimate sovereign.

Regarding the degree as iniquitous, and hoping its reversal on the accession of Philip de Valois, to whose sister he was married, he unhappily assented to bad advice for the forging of some deeds to faciliate the attainment of his object. Philip, enraged, and regardless of his connexion, prosecuted him with such rigour, as to drive him out of France into the Netherlands and thence into England. Here, in spite of all the remonstrances and menaces of the French monarch, he was protected by Edward, into whose mind he laboured to inculcate the idea of his right to the crown of France, and who was already much irritated against Philip for his protection of David Bruce, the exiled king of Scotland, and for his encouragement of the Scots in their resistance to Baliol. Mutually enraged, the two kings prepared for war ; and Edward formed alliances with some princes of Germany and the Netherlands, for the invasion of France on that side, the only quarter on which he expected to make a deep impression, or an effectual diversion in favour cf Guienne.

He is described as tall, majestic, finely shaped, with a piercing eye, and aquiline nose. In vigour of body and dexterity in arms he was equaled by very sew ; but the vigour of his mind was still more eminent. He was uncommonly versed in the learning of the age, and a munificent patron to men of literature. His military genius is evinced by the splendour of his atchievements ; but his conduct in the domestic administration of his realm appears more worthy of admiration. By his wisdom and energy the Englissi nation enjoyed in his reign a longer interval of internal peace than ever before, or for a length of time after. His affable and obliging demeanour, his generosity and martial prowess, gained the affections and esteem of his nobles; while they were held in awe by their knowledge of his spirit and capacity.

Thus two of the greatest and most estimable of the Englissi monarchs, by abortive attempts to enforce unfounded titles, widely different however, in respect of sound policy, entailed on their kingdom the establissied hatred of its two proximite neighbouring nations. The animosity, however, of the French against the, Englissi nation, since this epocha, has been much less than that of the Scots to the Englissi, and also less, as Hume observes, than that of the latter to the French, as the last were a people of softer manners, and successively engaged in hostilities with all their neighbours on the continent, by which the popular prejudices were diverted into many channels.

With both the wind and sun in their favour, by superior seamanssiip, the Englissi archers made grievous havoc, and, after a desperate conflict, a victory was obtained by Edward, with a loss to the French stated at thirty thousand men and two hundred and thirty ships. The splendour of this victory excited such a spirit among his allies, that mo. he was enabled to take the field with a hundred thousand men, beside a separate army of forty thou sand Flemings : yet this campaign terminated with not more advantage than the former. Routed by a sally of the garrison of Saint-Omers, the unwarlike Flemings dispersed to their several homes. Baffled by the defensive system of his rival at the head of a still more numerous army than his, and irritated by a long and fruitless siege of Tourney, Edward sent a herald to Philip, challenging him to a single com bat or a general battle. This was declined in a contemptuous manner ; but, for the relief of the town, a battle seemed inevitable, when by Jane of Hainault, sister to Philip and mother to Edward's queen, a truce was proposed, which Edward, by his embarrassments, and the reluctance of his allies to the forwarding of his design, found himself obliged to accept. DUeomenti Quite frustrated in his plans, deserted by his 1341. confederates, deeply immersed in debt, and so un- mercifully teased by his creditors, that he withdrew by stealth from the continent to escape their importunities, Edward arrived in England in extremely ill humour, the effects of which were felt by many, but chiefly by"], [681, "15\u00bb Chap, XXVII BRITISH ILANDS. by those who were concerned in the management of the revenue. From the severity, perhaps injustice, of his prosecutions, Stratford, the primate and prime minister, regarded as the chief delinquent, ssiielded himself under the privileges of his order, and, denouncing excommunication against all who ssiould dare to lay violent hands on the persons or proper ties of Churchmen, boldly set himself at the head of his clergy in opposition to the regal power. Arrayed in his pontificals, bearing his crosier, and followed by a magnificent train of ecclesiastics, he demanded admittance to his seat in parliament as the first peer of the realm. After an exclusion during two days, the king, conscious of danger, perhaps of error, admitted him to his place and to reconciliation. Not only were the clergy offended, but, by op- pressive impositions and arbitrary measures, discontent had been caused through the nation in general ; and the nobles, taking advantage of the king's situation, formed a plan for making dangerous encroachments on his power. Justly apprehensive that, if Edward should ever have been able to enforce his claim to the crown of France, England would become a province of the French monarchy, the parliament had already made prudently a protest, that they owed him no obedience as king of France, and that the two kingdoms must forever remain distinct and independent ; a vain defense if the event had taken place ! but now an act was framed with im- portant limitations of the royal prerogative, and an independence of the nobility, to which Edward unwillingly"], [682, "HISTORY OF THE 160 Chap XXVII Renewal of war with France. 1312 13.7, unwillingly assented, yielding to the torrent which he was unable to stem, and depending on his address and on contingencies for his future extrication. Accordingly he entered a secret protest ; and after wards, when he had obtained a much needed supply, he issued an edict, declaring the statute null, as being contrary to the constitution, yet promising to observe such articles of it as had before been law. Notwithstanding this fraudful deed, which might be expected to prevent all future confidence between him and his people, he, by masterly conduct, in the course of two years, so re-establissied his influ ence as to obtain from parliament, in legal form, a complete abrogation of the obnoxious statute. Mortified by hi. disappointments in his attempts against France, and by the difficulties in which he was thence involved at home, he might perhaps have remained at peace with Philip if he had not been invited to renew the war by a revolution in Brittany. A niece of the late duke of Brittany had, by the will of that prince, and a decree of the states of the dutchy, been declared heiress ; but on the duke's decease, the count of Mounfort, his brother by a second marriage, attempted, by force and intrigue, to render himself master of the province. In the civil war thus excited the count was made prisoner ; but his countess, Jane of Flanders, a real heroine, putting herself at the head of his troops, maintained the war with amazing spirit, and solicited aid from Edward, with whom her husband had formed an alliance, notwithstanding that his claim to"], [683, "m Chap XXVII. 1343 1344 1345 BRITISH ILANDS. to the dutchy, in right of male inheritance, was directly opposite to that of the Englissi prince to the crown of France. Overpowered by superior num bers furnissied by the French monarch, and besieged in Hennebonne, ssie was relieved, in a critical moment, by an Englissi force under Sir Walter Manny. Another reinforcement soon after arrived under Robert d'Artois, who was mortally wounded in a conflict at Vannes ; and Edward in person led thither in October a body of twelve thousand. Undertaking too much, three sieges at once, with so small a force, this prince had no success ; and in the end while he invested Vannes, was himself almost invested by forty thousand men. In this dangerous situation, he came to an agreement, in the January of 1343, for a three years' truce, the release of prisoners on both sides, and the retention of what each party then held in possession. The design of a treaty of peace, negociated under the pope's mediation, proved abortive. Both parties complained of infractions of the truce, and recom menced hostilities. Henry of Lancaster, a magna nimous nobleman, leading an Englissi army from Guienne, made in two years large conquests from the French monarch, who was long disabled by financial embarrassments from effective opposition. At length, overpowered by a vast superiority of number, the Englissi in that quarter were compelled to recede, while Edward, with an armament of a thousand vessels, was prevented by contrary winds from coming to their assillance. Bv the advice of Godfrey d'Harcourt, a noble Norman, a refugee in Yoj.. II, \"M hi."], [684, "HISTORY OF THE 162 Chap XXVII his court from Philip's persecution, the English monarch resolved, instead of Guienne, to choose for the scene of his operations the northern parts of France, which were at once unguarded and wealthy. With four thousand men at arms, ten thousand archers, and eighteen thousand Welch and Irifli infantry, he landed at La Hogue in the July of 1346. As both the coast and interior country were found quite defenseless, his fleet destroyed all the shipping in the several harbours ; while his troops, unresisted, spread extensive devastation, and loaded their ships with enormous spoil. From the pillage of Caen, great part of whose inhabitants were slaughtered without distinction of age or sex, he advanced eastward to attack Rouen, but found the bridge broken, and an army collected under Philip, on the opposite bank of the Seine, for the city's defense. Along the western side of that river he extended bis ravages to the gates of Paris, but found himself in the utmost peril of being enclosed and captured. Here to extricate himself from the toils, into which his rassiness had carried him, great generalssiip and vigour were necessary. Gaining a passage over the Seine, by a feint at Poissy, he directed his march with rapidity to the Netherlands, but was again in like manner stopped by the Somme. Below Abbeville he crossed the stream at low water, in a critical moment, and dispersed an army which guarded the ford ; while, by the rising of the tide, the great host led by Philip, which hung upon his was interrupted in its pursuit. Sensible"], [685, "BRITISH ILANDS. 16S Sensible of the danger to which a continued Chat-. flight would expose his troops, who must soon be overtaken by the numerous cavalry of the foe, Battle of Edward resolved to make a stand for battle, and r\"y\" chose judiciously his ground near the village of Ausust *6' Crecy. On a gentle ascent, with a wood behind, 1346. and deep trenches to protect his flanks, his army stood arranged in three lines, in the hindmost of which himself took his station, in the foremost his eldest son Edward, only sixteen years old, styled, from the colour of his armour, the Black Prince. At the head of a hundred and twenty thousand men, occompanied by the king of the Romans, and the kings of Bohemia and Majorca, Philip crossed the river at the bridge of Abbeville, and pursued with the utmost eagerness, dreading nothing so much as the escape of his rival. Finding that the Englissi had halted and prepared for combat, he issued orders to stop the career of his troops, that they might respire from their fatigue, and be embattled at more leisure on the following day : but these orders, from their lateness, the hurry of the march, and impetuosity of the French nobles, proved ineffectual. The vast unwieldy host moved onward in three lines, and began the battle at three in the after- noon. Fifteen thousand Genoese in the front, armed with cross bows, advancing with loud shouts, disi charged their weapons, which, because their bow strings had been relaxed by a thunderftower, fell ssiort of their object. The Englissi archers, bearing long bows, having preserved these engines dry in M i their"], [686, "16+ Chap, XXVII. t HISTORY OF THE their cases, and having awaited in steady silence a sufficiently near approach of the enemy, poured volleys of arrows thick as showers of snow, accord ing to Froissart's idea, which made such havoc that the Genoese sell back in consternation on the second line. This line fell into confusion, was galled also by the arrows, and ordered by its enraged commander to drive the runaways to the combat, or to put them to the sword. In this disorder they were furiously charged by the Englissi van under the Black prince, followed, for its support, by the second line. King Edward in the rear, surveying the battle from the top of the hill, informed that his son was perform ing prodigies of valour, but in serious danger from the vast superiority of number against him, sent a message that, \" to the prince was reserved all the glory of that day, who must therefore expect no assistance from the third division, but shew himself worthy of the honour of knighthood lately conferred on him.\" By this, which breathed the spirit of romantic chivalry, much more than of generalssiip, the ardour of the prince and his associates was sub limed to the utmost pitch. Their efforts were vehe mently strained : the French cavalry were driven, one upon another, in confused crowds : great num. bers were unhorsed, and slaughtered by the long knives of the Welch infantry, who russied among them with tremendous yells. Philip, enraged, pussied forward with the third division to sustain his broken troops ; but this quickly ssiared the fame fate, and he was reluctantly led away by his attend- ants"], [687, "BRITIill I LANDS. 165 Cha XXV I Reduction ot Calais. 134' ants in the general rout, when he had'been wounded and his horse killed under him. The pursuit and slaughter continued till night. No quarter was given either then or in the following day, when straggling bodies of the routed army, bewildered in a fog, were allured to destruction by French ensigns, insidiously displayed on eminences by the Englissi. The loss of men on the side of Edward appears to have been unimportant ; on that of Philip about thirty-seven thousand, among whom were his brother the count of Alencon, the kings of Bohemia and Majorco, many of the chief nobi lity, twelve hundred knights, fourteen hundred other gentlemen, and four thousand men at arms. The crest of the king of Bohemia, with three ostrich feathers, and this German motto, \" Ich dien, I serve,\" was adopted by the prince of Wales and his suc cessors, in memorial of a victory, where the con- quering host exceeded not perhaps one fourth of the vanquissied, and where the number of slain of the latter actually surpassed the whole number of men in the former. The cruelty of the Englissi in giving no quarter, and in making greater havock than necessity required, seems to have arisen from apprehensions of danger in the incumbrance of prisoners, and a policy of striking all possible terrour for the forwarding of their future success. Continuing their retreat to Calais, they invested that city, the possession of which would afford them in future a convenient entrance into France. To save the provisions for his garrison, the governor, John de Vienne, ex- pelled"], [688, "166 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXVII i \u2022-v pelled above fixteen hundred persons Useless for war, whom Edward generously permitted to pass through his camp, and even furnissied with money for their support in travelling. So strongly en trenched amid impassible morasses was the besieging army, that Philip, with a host more numerous still than that which had been lately routed, found the relief of the town impracticable, and, after a vain challenge to Edward, retired in despair. Yielding to the rage of hunger, on the failure of all resources, the garrison surrendered in the August of 1347, after a blockade of above eleven months. A story told by Froissart, unnoticed by others whose accounts are otherwise minute, seems somewhat doubtful ; that Edward, enraged by their obstinate defense, would grant their lives to the garrison on no other terms, than that six of the principal citizens should come to him with ropes about their necks ready to be sacrificed as victims for the rest ; and that six, who voluntarily devoted themselves to death on this occa sion, were dismissed in safety at the pathetic suppli cation fcf queen Philippa.

While Edward was employed in the long blockade of Calais, occurrences of moment had elsewhere taken place mostly in his favour. The Englissi army in Guienne had regained its superiority, and had carried devastation and terrour through the neighbouring parts to the banks of the Loire. In Brittanny the countess of Mountfort had taken pri soner the rival of her husoand, Charles de Blois ; but found in the wise of that prince, the heiress of the late duke, an opponent not inferior to herself in heroic valour and political dexterity. In England an important victory had been gained, which might have been followed by vast advantages. David Bruce, king of Scotland, had been recalled from France by his subjects, and, after the infraction of the truce between the Englissi and French, in which the Scots were included, had prepared for offensive war. With an army stated at fifty thousand, he entered the Englissi borders, and carried his ravages to the gates of Durham. At Nevil's cross, near that city, in the October of 1346, his disorderly multitude was assailed by lord Piercy with twelve thousand Englissi, and routed with horrid carnage ; and himself was made prisoner, with lord Douglas and several others of the chief nobility. Philippa, the queen of Edward, who may have had much merit in assisting to raise and encourage the troops, but who, as lord Hailes has proved, was not present in this battle, secured the royal prisoner in the tower of London, and passed thence to her husoand's camp at Calais, where ssie was received with trium phal respect. Through"], [690, "16* Ch .p XxVn Posterior transaction* 1348 1353 HISTORY OF THE Through the mediation of the pope's legates the contending parties agreed to a truce, which by several renewals was prolonged near six years, but so ill observed that partial hostilities were still main tained in various quarters. Among these was an attempt of the French to recover Calais by treachery in the year 1349. Returning to England, Edward had committed the charge of this town to Amerie de Pavia, an Italian officer of military merit, but of so little fidelity, that he bargained to betray the place for twenty thousand crowns to Charnay, the commander of the French in that neighbourhood. Informed of the conspiracy, Edward promised par don to the governor on condition of his turning the plot against the foe. Accordingly, in the concerted night, when Amerie had received the stipulated sum from a small select band of French who were silently introduced through the postern, that band was instantly assailed, and all either killed or cap tured ; while Edward himself, who had come pri vately to the town, throwing open the chief gate, russied out against the main body, who waited there for admittance. Notwithstanding their surprise, the French fought with such valour as to render the conflict for some time dangerous. The king engaged singly with a knight, named Eustace de Ribeaumont, who, after a doubtful combat, yielded himself pri soner, when he perceived his party routed.

Jt. RANCE, at the accession of John to the throne, was found in a state of distraction and debility far beyond the reach of his norrow genius to correct. Adverse to the restoration of vigour to a monarchy, whose frame had been severely ssiaken by the suc cessful inroads of the Englissi, were the crooked designs of an intestine foe, a feudatory of France, Charles, king of Navarre, surnamed the wicked. Descended from the royal blood of France, and married to a daughter of king John, this prince, endowed with great vigour of mind, with splendid abilities, with fascinating graces of person and address, ought to have proved the main pillar of the French throne; but destitute of principle, of natu ral affection, and of true policy, he adopted schemes which tended to its subversion. After some heinous acts of disloyalty, which John, from inability to punissi, had pretended to forgive, this monarch was exasperated to extremity when he dis- covered"], [693, "BRITISH 1LAN13S. 171 ClIAP, XXVIII. Covered, that Charles was not only proceeding in his plots, but had even seduced to his party the prince royal or heir of France, a youth of seventeen, the first who bore the title of Dauphin, from the province of Dauphine reunited to the French crown. Made sensible of his criminal error, the dauphin resolved to make atonement by the sacrifice of his confederates. Against the treachery of the conspi rators treachery was employed by king John and his son. Seized at a feast, to which he had been insidiously invited, at Rouen, the king of Navarre was committed to prison, and his principal accom plices put to death. This act of perfidy proved little advantageous. By Philip of Navarre, brother of the imprisoned prince, were his fortresses quickly put in a state of defence, and instant aid solicited from the Englissi monarch, with whom the detected conspirators had formed a confederacy. Well pleased with the assistance of a faction in king Edward, whose truce with John had expired, and whose negociations for peace had failed, invaded that country with two armies at once, in two opposite quarters, with sword and conflagration. One of these armies he led from Calais in person : the other was commanded by the Black prince, who landed at Bourdeaux in the September of 1355. The king, after much devastation, and several vain efforts to bring the French army under John to a battle, re turned home in winter to repel some hostilities of the Scots.

Battle of In the following year this young hero directed his line of devastation toward the north-east, apparently 1356. with design to form a junction with the English forces in the northern quarter : but, finding that the bridges on the Loire were broken, all the passes guarded, and a vast army assembled against him under king John, he perceived that a retreat into Guienne was necessary. His resolution, however, for this purpose was taken too late. The French overtook him near Poictiers, and rendered his escape impracticable otherwise than by victory. With, at most, not more than twelve thousand men, of whom not a third were Englissi, he prepared for battle against a host not less, at least, than sixty thousand in num ber. Sensible of his perilous situation, he con sented, by the interference of the cardinal of Peri gord, to purchase a retreat by the restitution of all his conquests, and by engaging not to serve against France in seven years : but when John insisted on his becoming a prisoner, he replied with disdainful determination, that \" England ssiould never have to pay a ransome for him.\" A delay of near twenty-four hours, caused by this negociation, gave, contrary tothe cardinal's intention, the advantage to prince Edward of more strongly entrenching the post which he had judiciously chosen. This was an inclined plain, so \u25a0 environed by woods, vineyards and hedges, as to be assailable"], [695, "175 Chap xxvin. BRITISH ILANDS. assailable only through a defile in front. Here, however, he might have been surrounded and starved into a surrendry : but the impetuosity of the French, and confidence in their numbers, hurried them to the assault, as to a victory indubitable. Having taken various precautions for defense, he arranged his army in three lines, the fame number in which the troops of John advanced against him. The men at arms, who led the attack in the van guard of the French, sustained a terrible slaughter from the archers placed on both sides of the defile,. whose murderous arrows pierced their armour ; and, when they had passed to the open ground, they were received with so fierce a ssiock by the prince, that they recoiled on their associates who were pressing forward through the defile, and filled all that column with alarm and confusion. In the critical moment, when disorder was spreading from the routed van, six hundred men, springing suddenly from an ambussi, made a furious onset on the flank of the second line. The attendants of the dauphin, who had been placed in that division, anxious for his safety, carried him away from the field with precipitation. Dismay pervaded that body of the French from an example of flight, which was quickly followed by many, while the troops of prince Edward, issuing from the defile, completed their discomfiture, and charged with desperate impetuosity a body of German horse in the front of the third division, where John him self commanded.

John maintained the combat with heroic valour; but his troops were broken, his nobles slaughtered round him, and he was at length taken prisoner together with one of his sons, a boy of fourteen, who had also fought bravely and received a wound. His life was now in greater peril than before. The Englissi soldiers forced him from a French knight, who had taken him in custody : the Gascons in the prince's army insisted on their right to the charge of guarding him j and the former would have killed him rather than permit them to enjoy that honour. The earl of Warwick, sent by the prince to enquire concerning the sate of the French monarch, arrived in a happy moment to effect his rescue, and to conduct him to the tent of his royal commander. Prince Edward, hasting to meet the captive monarch, accosted him with expressions of respect and tenderness, extolled his bravery, and ascribed his misfortune to the blind chance of war, or the inscrutible decree of providence. At a sumptuous repast, which he furnissied to his royal prisoner, he positively refused, as a feudatory of the French crown, to sit at table with his sovereign, and stood at his back as one of his retinue. Thus, as Hume has observed, \u25a0** all his father's pretensions to the crown of France were buried in oblivion. John in captivity, received the honours of a king, which were refused him when seated on the throne. His misfortunes, not his title, were respected : and the French prisoners, conquered by this elevation of mind, more than by their late discomfiture, burst out"], [697, "BRITISH ILAKDS. 175 Chap, XXVIIIk 134' out into tears of joy and admiration ; which were only checked by the reflexion, that such genuine and unaltered heroism in an enemy must certainly in the issue prove but the more dangerous to their native country. All the Englissi and Gascon knights imitated the generous example set them by the prince. The captives were every where treated with humanity, and were soon after dsmissed on paying moderate ransomes to the persons into whose hands they had fallen. Yet so numerous were the noble prisoners, that these ransomes, joined to the spoils of the field, were sufficient to enrich the prince's army, and as they had suffered very little in the action, their joy and exultation was com plete.\" His desperate courage in the rage of battle ; his cool judicious conduct in circumstances of danger ; and, above all, his mild and soothing courtesy to the vanqui slied, entitle Edward, the Black prince, to be ranked in the first class of heroes ; perhaps to be pronounced, except Alfred, the most amiable on record. Yet such is the power of habit in uniting contraries in the human composition, that this heroic youth, so charmingly humane to his royal and noble captives, consistently with the spirit of chivalry then prevalent, had not scrupled to inflict, according to the mode of warfare of the age, mo (I rueful calamities on the unoffending people of France by extensive ravage and conflagration.

He landed at South wark, and was met by a prodigious concourse of people of all ranks and stations. The prisoner was clad in royal apparel, and mounted on a white steed, dislinguissied by its size and beauty, and by the richness of its furniture. The conqueror rode by his side in a meaner attire, and carried by a black palfrey. In this situation, much more glorious than all the insolent parade of a Roman triumph, he passed through the streets of London, and presented the king of France to his father, who advanced to meet him, and received him with the fame courtesy, as if he had been a neighbouring potentate that had voluntarily come to pay him a friendly visit. It is im possible, in reflecting on this noble conduct, not to per ceive the advantages which resulted from the otherwise whimsical chivalry, and which gave men in those rude times some superiority even over people of a more cultivated age and nation.\" In the May of 1347 this triumphal entry took place, in which, and on all other occasions, the captive monarch ssiewed himself not unworthy of the most courteous treat ment, displaying a royal dignity of deportment, never forgetting one moment that he was a king, appearing more sensible to Edward's generosity than to his own misfortunes, and professing his honour un impaired, since, whatever discomfiture he had suf fered, the advantage had been gained over him by a prince of consummate prowess and benignity.

Availing themselves of the absence of king Edward in France, the Scots had taken by surprise the town of Berwick in the November of 1355: but, as they were unable to gain possession of the castle, the place was recovered, after a siege of a few days, in the following January, by the Englissi monarch, who laid waste the Scottissi territories to Edinburg, which, together with Fladdington, he destroyed with fire. To him was resigned, in the most formal manner, all right to the crown of Scotland by Edward Baliol, now old, childless, and utterly rejected as king by the Scots, in consideration of two thousand pounds a year in a pension for life, not amounting, in efficient value, to thirty thousand of the eighteenth century, as, by an alteration in the coinage made in this reign, the nominal pound irt money had become near a fourth part less than the real pound of silver. Finding, however, that neither by his purchase of the regal right, nor by the captivity of king David, was his design pro moted for the conquest of Scotland, Edward set this prince at liberty in the October of 1357, after a captivity of eleven years, for a ransome of a hundred thousand marks, for the payment of which in ten years hostages were given, and a truce con cluded for the fame length of time.

Paris and the other cities, arrogating independence, rejected the dauphin's authority, a youth of eighteen, of promising abilities, who, in the captivity of his father, had naturally assumed the regal administration. The nobles, from their disgraceful rout, and desertion of their king, at Poictiers, had fallen into contempt, and lost all influence.

The gentry were hunted like wolves and slaughtered wherever found. Their wives and daughters were publicly violated, and afterwards butchered; their castles burned; and some gentlemen were impaled, and roasted alive over a slow fire ! Such are the dire consequences of rendering the lower classes insensible to others woes, and ferocious, by oppres sion ! Amid the general confusion the king of Navarre escaped from prison, and heightened the national danger by attempting to seat himself on the throne of France, for his success in which he chiefly relied on the Englissi interest ; an interest adverse in its nature to the ultimate accomplissiment of his views-, and hurtful to his cause by its present coalition, as it was odious to the people of France in general.

Some bands of military plunderers, and the principal bodies of insurgent peasants, were dispersed with slaughter.

While he sent privately assistance to the N i king"], [702, "180 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXVIII. 1 360 king of Navarre, he negociated with John his pri soner, who concluded a treaty for annexing for ever to the Englissi crown all the French provinces for merly possessed by Henry the second, free from all homage or subordination to the French monarchy. As this compact, so dishonourable and ruinous to their country, was rejected by the dauphin and the states of France, the Englissi monarch, who had in the interval collected money, made preparations for a most formidable attack. The hope of success and of ample spoil under two such leaders as king Edward and his heroic son, attracted to his standard all the military force of England, with many foreign adventurers. Pesolved on a plan of warfare purely defensive, the dauphin left the open country to the ravages of the foe, and, throwing garrisons into the chief towns, took his station in the capital to super intend the general system. Marching from Calais in the November of 1359, at the head of a hundred thousand men, with six thousand waggons for their supply of provisions, the enraged king of England carried widespread desola tion to Rheims in Champagne, in which he wissied to be crowned king of France, as it was the usual place of coronation to the French monarchs. Hence decamping, after a siege long and fruitless, he ad vanced into Burgundy, whose duke purchased an exemption from further pillage by a sum equiva lent to between three and four hundred thousand pounds of. our money. He continued his ravages and exactions to the gates of Paris, where he arrived at the end of March in the following year. Perceiving"], [703, "1SI Chap XXVIII. Posterior transactions 1 360. 1306. BRITISH IT ANDS. Perceiving that either an assault or blockade would be a vain attempt, he directed his march toward Btittanny, with intention to refrelh his troops for some time in that friendly province. He abstained from devastation during the holydays of Easter ; for, as Hume has observed, \" superstition can some times restrain the rage of men, which neither justice nor humanity is able to control.\" Convinced at length that the deplorable havoc, committed by his troops in the territories of France, had not the least tendency to favour his advancement to the throne of that kingdom, he consented to a treaty of peace, which was brought to a conclusion at Bretigny in the May of the fame year. Extensive territories in the west, with Calais and a contiguous district, were ceded in full sovereignty to Edward : king John was set at liberty for a ransome estimated at above fifteen hundred thousand pounds of our money, payable in several sums at stated times : and the disputes in Brittanny were reserved for the decision of arbiters appointable by the two monarchs. As, principally from the unwillingness of the nobles in the ceded provinces to transfer their allegi ance from their native sovereign to the king of England, many difficulties occurred in the execution of articles in the treaty of peace, king John, who laboured strenuously for the faithful performance of all his engagements, returned to England in-* 1363, in the hope of adjusting all matters in dispute. Admonissied against the danger of such a step by his council, who would probably have recommended evasions of the compact, he replied, that \" though good"], [704, "HISTORY OF THE 182 Chap XXVIII.

This magnanimous prince, most un deservedly unfortunate, was treated, as formerly, with respectful kindness in London, where he was seized with sickness, and expired in the April of the following year. In the fame year the contest in Brittanny was decided in favour of Mountfort, not by arbiters but by a battle in which his rival fell. To conciliate the French in the ceded countries in the west to the Englissi government, king Edward had bestowed these countries, formed into a fief, styled the principality of Aquitaine, to the Black prince, who, highly esteemed, even by his enemies, appeared to have establissied his dominion in that quarter, till, by engaging in an enterprise unjust and impolitic, he sapped the foundation of his own authority. The military adventurers in France, who had followed the standard of the Englissi, refused, on the return of peace, to relinquissi an occupation by which they had gained subsistence ; and, augmenting their numbers by associations of men similarly inclined, they seized many fortresses, denominated their bands the companies, and maintained them selves by plunder. Foiled in his repeated attempts to correct the evil by force of arms, the late dauphin, now Charles the fifth of France, had the address to free his kingdom from these deleterious humours by diverting them into an extraneous channel. He employed"], [705, "1S3 Chap XXVIII, Reconquest of the French pro vinces from England. 1368 137 -t, BRITISH ILANBS. employed a famous general, named Bertrand du Gueselin, to insist these bands, and to lead them into Spain, for the dethronement of Peter, king of Castile, sornamed the cruel, in favour of Henry of Transtamare, a natural brother of that tyrant. By the arms of these adventurers, favoured by the Castilians, Henry was without opposition placed on the throne in 1366: but Peter took refuge in Guienne with the Black prince, who, from v/hat motives we can only conjecture, unfortunately espoused the tyrant's cause. Reinforced, when he had entered Spain, by the bands of adventurers, who deserted to him from Du Gueselin, Prince Edward gained a great victory, in the April of 1367, at Najara, and restored the cruel Peter, who requit ed his unjust enterprise by defrauding him of the money which he had promised to pay him for the maintenance of his troops. After a tedious delay in vain expectation, the prince returned to Bour deaux with the ssiattered remnant of his army wasted by sickness in the hot summer of Spain. Henry, soon after, assembling a small army, flew the detested Peter, and establissied himself on the Castilian throne, while the Black prince, deeply injured in health and in revenue by his Spanissi expedition, was involved in difficulties which he never surmounted. Immersed in debt by the ex pences of this enterprise, prince Edward imposed a tax on hearths in his French dominions, which ex cited or augmented disaffection to the Englissi government, insomuch that many of. the nobles entered into hostile intrigues with king Charles of France. v"], [706, "181 Chap XXVIII wv>_^ History of the France. That monarch, encouraged by circum stances, and thinking every kind of means justifiable against a foe who had caused such calamities to his kingdom, summoned the prince to Paris to answer the complaints of his nobles, as if he were still a feudatorv of the French crown, in violation of an article in the treaty of peace. The prince replied, that \" he would indeed come to Paris, but in no other style than at the head of an army of sixty thousand ;\" a threat which might perhaps have been accomplissied if he had retained his health and vigour. But the French monarch, w:ho had long been silently active in preparation, and had amassed a great sum for the pretended purpose of discharging what remained unpaid of his father's ransome, assailed the Englissi possessions with formidable force, relying much en the advanced age of king Edward, the indisposition of the prince, and the intrigues with the disaffected under the Englissi dominion. Tardy at first, notwithstanding his manifest supe riority in an extended war of ssiirmissies and sieges, the success of Charles, who committed his troops to the conduct of the great Du Guesclin, became rapid at length from the revolt of towns and the decline of prince Edward, who, debilitated by sick ness, resigned the command to his brother, John of Gaunt, in 1370, and returned to England in the following year.

J.N the reign of Edward the third, notwithstanding that the practices of administration continued to be arbitrary, the laws to be imperfectly executed, and a general irregularity to prevail, we find the politi cal constitution of England assuming a form less in definite ; the division, which has ever since subsisted, of the parliament into t^vo distinct houses completely established ; and the house of commons beginning to acquire a considerable weight in the general sys tem. Our information is obscure and scanty con cerning the parliament of the Angse-Saxons, called the wittena-gemot, which literally signified the assem bly of wife men. That any representatives of the commons had place in this assembly, which appears to have been of aristocratical composition, we have no rational grounds to suppose. The union of all the particular or provincial wittenagemots, those which had severally subsisted in the little kingdoms of the Heptarchy, into one general assembly for the whole"], [710, "HISTORY OF THE 188 Chap XXIX whole nation, termed sometimes the micklemot or great meeting, must have had a tendency, in the natural course of affairs, to confine still more the privilege to the higher classes, from the necessity of restricting the number of members within such limits as might preclude a tumultuary confusion. This ge neral wittenagemot was composed of the bissiops, abbots, and nobles, together with seme others not now definable, among whom were certain wise men, perhaps judges or men learned in the laws. Pro bably the more considerable proprietors of land be low the rank of nobles were also, without any elec tion, entitled to be members. Their qualification is supposed to have been at first five hydes of land, afterwards forty hydes, or about five thousand acres. When the system was altered, by the Norman con quest, from a feudal aristocracy to a feudal monar chy, we can trace no other, until aftera long period, than a similar composition in the national assembly, which was called the great council, or common council of the kingdom, and afterwards the parlia ment from the French tongue. Commonly, from ancient custom, a great council, composed of nobles and prelates only, met thrice in the year, at the three great festivals of christmas, easter, and whitfuntide, authorized, by the tacit consent of the nation, to exercise parliamentary power to an exteat not now, perhaps not even then, accurately determinable. Even in the fullest parliament, we are led to conclude, from the state of property and other circumstances, that these members mult have commanded by their power"], [711, "18S\u00bb Chap XXIX. ' v ' BRITISH HANDS. power or influence the votes of all the rest, particu larly the representatives of towns, if any such deputies had in early times a place in this great convention, since we learn from doomsday book, that the towns were so inconsiderable in the time of the first William, that York, at least the third city in the kingdom, contained not more than fourteen hundred and eighteen houses, and none below it, except Norwich, near half that number. Not only were all the great barons liable to be summoned to parliament, at whatsoever time and place the king judged expedient, but also all the small barons, or the inferior military tenants who held their fiefs immediately from the crown, even those who possessed each not more than a single knight's fee. Though the privilege Was too honour able to be altogether relinquissied, yet the attend ance was so burthensome to small proprietors, that they wissied an exemption from it except on extraor dinary occasions. Hence the Great Charter of king John provided, that, while the great barons ssiould be summoned particularly by writs addressed to each, the summonses of the smaller ssiould be general from the ssieriffs in their respective counties, which seems to have left an option of attendance or non attendance to the several individuals. A question still remains, not answerable with complete decision, whether, beside the prelates, and the great and small barons, whose personal presence was requisite, the parliament, before the reign of Henry the third, contained in its composition any representatives of the other freemen of England, as the fubvassals, or military"], [712, "HISTORY OF THE 190 Chap, military tenants of the great barons ; the possessors .^^\\. of lands allodial, or exempt from feudal services ; and the denizens of cities, towns, and boroughs ? The negative of this question seems probable, notwithstanding that lord Lyttleton, whose opinion is highly respectable, maintained the affirmative, in the second book of his life of Henry the second, where, after a full examination of the subject, he thus concludes : \" Upon the whole, it seems that the parliaments, during the times which 1 write of, contained in them the first elements of those we have now ; but were only a rough draught, in which regularity and decorum were absolutely wanting. Nor was that balance of power, which makes the perfection of our present constitution, yet fixed in those assemblies. For, the property of the commons was so unequal to that of the nobles, and the feudal obligations of the inferior landholders, to the lords they held under, created such a dependence of the former on the latter, that although, in the idea and scheme of the government, a popular power was mixed with the regal and aristocratical, yet, in reality, the scale of the people was not weighty enough to make a proper counterpoise to either of the other. The changes made in the peerage, the relaxation of the feudal laws, and the diffusion of wealth among the lower orders of freemen, pro duced afterwards a great difference in the state of the legislature.\" The first representation of the Englissi commons,. recorded in history, had place, as I have already noticed in my twenty-second chapter, in the year i*6$\u00ab"], [713, "BRITISH ILAND9. 191 Chap, XXIX, 1265, when king Henry the third, under the influ- ence of Simon de Montfort, issued writs for the sending of two knights of the ssiire to parliament from each county, two citizens from each city, two burgesses from each considerable borough, and two barons from each of the Cinque ports. This repre- sentative body appears not to have been summoned again to the national convention, till Edward the first, pressed by pecuniary demands, and influenced by the changes which had by insensible degrees taken place in the general system, revived, but not in a regular or settled form, what has been termed the deputation of the third estate. The feudal establissiment, incompatible with popular freedom, had fallen into decay. From the inefficacy of its militia had arisen the custom of scutage, the com- mutation of military service for money which was commonly employed in the occasional hiring of mercenary troops. This revenue failed from the great diminution in the number of knights fees, caused by revolutibns of property too various for specification, and by various frauds which through force of prescription became incorrigible, as false musters and collusive alienations of lands to the church. The power of the great barons, under- mined by the authority of the ssierisss and their county courts, had been much impaired : the small barons, or gentry, had become more numerous and respectable : and the boroughs, long protected by monarchal policy, according to the general custom then prevalent in the west of Europe, on account of the"], [714, "HISTORY OF THE 192 Chap. XXIX VsTVN-*' the useful industry of their inhabitants, had en creased in number, population, and riches. To procure, ifi a manner the most convenient and least offensive to his people, the money of which he stood in so much need, Edward the first, in the year 1295, commanded the sending of deputies not only from the gentry of the counties, but also from the cities and boroughs, who, by their delegated authority, might consent, after due deliberation, to the levying of such taxes as ssiould be deemed requisite. The number of deputies, during some time indeterminate, was at length, by establissied cus- tom, fixed at two for each county and corporation. All the expences of their election and attendance were defrayed by their constituents. At first the representatives of boroughs, and other towns cor- porate, formed in parliament a separate body, not admitted to mix with the great barons, nor With the deputies of the small. By their number and union, 'however, and by the encreasing wealth of the towns, these delegates of cities and boroughs rose gradually in consideration ; while the gentry of the counties, denominated knights from their being possessed of knight's fees, not of the honour of knighthood, having enereased in number on divided properties, found themselves more funk below the level of the great barons, and consequently, when elected deputies, less disinclined to coalesce with men acting, like themselves, in a vicarious capacity. A complete coalition was formed when small barons were elected to represent boroughs. The time of this coalition is not marked in history, nor the time when"], [715, "103 Chap XXIX Improve ment of the laws. BRITISH ILANDS. when a separation first had place of the whole delegated body, or house of commons, from the spiritual and temporal lords, or house of peers ; but we find this separation existing in the year 1343, under Edward the third, who is found to have summoned, in the course of his reign, not less than seventy parliaments and great councils, by the latter of which we understand assemblies of prelates and barons only. Though lawyers in this period were so far from having as yet attained a respectable rank in society, that they were not admitted as members of the house of commons, jurisprudence had risen to such a pitch of improvement, as to induce Sir Matthew Hale, in his history of common law, to assert, that at the end of Edward the third's reign \" the law seemed to be near its meridian.\" The laws of the Anglo-Saxons, like those of the other Gothic nations, who conquered and settled in the provinces of the Roman empire, were customs long establissied, and at length reduced to writing, barbarous, or characteristic of rude society. For crimes the most atrocious, murder, and even regicide, sines were the only punissiments. These, accurately specified, or proportioned to the conceived degrees of transgres sion, were compensations, partly to the person or family injured, partly to the magistrate for infrac tions of the peace and his trouble in settling the disputes. The modes of proof in their judicial trials were the strongest marks of their barbarism. \" Whatever we may imagine,\" says Hume, \" con cerning the usual truth and sincerity of men who Vol. II. O live"], [716, "1Q-. Chap XXIX I HISTORY OF THE live in a rude and barbarous state, there is much more falsehood, and even perjury, among them than among civilized nations ; and virtue, which is nothing but a more enlarged and more cultivated reason, never flourissies to any degree, nor is founded on steady principles of honour, except where a good education becomes general, and men are taught the pernicious consequences of vice, treachery, and immorality. Even superstition,, though more pre valent among ignorant nations, is but a poor supply for the defects of knowledge and education ; and our European ancestors, who employed every moment the expedient of swearing on extraordinary crosses and relics, were less honourable in all engage ments than their posterity, who from experience have omitted these ineffectual securities.\" To guard against perjury, when a person was admitted to clear himself of an imputation by his own oath, the corroborative testimony of compur gators was required, persons who, though they might have no knowledge of the fact, ssiould swear that they believed his oath to be true. Of these compur gators, who cannot be clalled with either jurymen or witnesses, the stated number, commonly twelve or twenty-four, varied according to the nature of the case, and sometimes amounted even to some hundreds. The weight of evidence was estimated not only by the number, but also by the rank, of the swearers. Thus, if the weregyld of a man, the fine stated for his murder, was equal to the sum of the weregylds of four others, his testimony was equivalent to the testimonies of all the four. As the"], [717, "BRITISH ILANDS. 195 Chap XXIX the procuring of compurgators depended on the extent of influence and connexion, while perjury, notwithstanding the awful and varied solemnity em ployed in administering of oaths, was a common practice, recourse was often had to what was termed the judgment of God, who was expected, on every such occasion, to work a miracle for the manifesta tion of guilt or innocence. This expectation was perfectly consonant with the ideas prevalent in those ages, when stories of innumerable miracles, related to have been performed on the most frivolous accounts in fabulous lives of saints, were irrefragably believed under the authority of papal bulls and de crees of councils. This mode of trial was various, but always pre ceded by the most solemn ceremonies of religion. Sometimes of a pair of sticks one was drawn by lot, which, if found marked with the figure of a cross, acquitted the accused, otherwise condemned him. Sometimes he was presented with a con secrated cake of barley, called a corsned, and was declared innocent or guilty according to his ability or inability to swallow it: but the latter could scarcely happen otherwise than from the disorder of corporal weakness or religious terrour. In the ordeal of cold water, he was thrown, with his feet and hands tied, into a pool, where, if he ssiould float, his guilt would be evinced ; but by sinking he in sured his acquittal, and was instantly drawn to land. Very different from this were the ordeals of hot water and iron, which appear to us to have been truly formidable. Here the person on trial, with O 2 his"], [718, "HISTORY OF THE 196 Chap. XXIX his bare hand, took a stone from some depth beneath the surface of boiling water, or carried a ball of hot iron through the space of nine feet. His hand and arm were instantly inclosed in a bag, which was carefully sealed, and were at the end of three days exposed to view. If any sign of injury appeared, he lost his cause ; otherwise he was victorious. Doubtless the clergy, to whom was committed the management of these trials, availed themselves of arts for the saving of those whom they favoured ; since otherwise the successful, of whom many are recorded, could not have possibly escaped unhurt the effects of sire. In another ordeal of iron, a person was condemned or acquitted, according as he was burned or not, in walking blindfold, with bare feet, over nine red hot ploughssiares placed at certain intervals. Long after the conquest of England by the Nor mans, among whom similar customs had prevailed, the ordeals were continued, besides that a new species was introduced, the judicial combat, or duel, by the chance of which the cause, whether criminal or civil, was decided in favour of the victorious party. When disqualified by sex, by age, by sick ness, or by the sacerdotal profession, for personal encounter, either party litigant might substitute a champion ! Not only were the principles in a suit liable to be challenged, but also the witnesses and even the judge, to maintain by arms the truth of iheir assertions or the rectitude of the sentence. This, notwithstanding its great absurdity, seems preferable to the ordeals of water and iron, since it served"], [719, "BRITISH ILANDS. 197 Chap. XXIX served at least as a test of personal courage, and since the danger of the trial might prove some check to a malicious prosecutor, and a useful barrier against injustice supported by power. Beside the introduc tion of this legal combat, which was in practice only among the higher classes, and strictly regulated by various forms, many changes took place in the laws and judicial proceedings in England in conse quence of its conquest by William the first, who made such arrangements, that all the judges, plea ders, and writers, in the courts of law, were Nor mans, and all the pleadings were in the French tongue. The rough system of the conqueror, a compound of old Englissi and Norman institutions, was greatly improved, as I have noted in my twelfth chapter, by Henry the second, whose chief justiciary, Ranulph de Glanville, has left us a digest of the common law then in being, styled De legibus et confuetudi nibus Angeli\u00e6. From the study of the civil law, in the Pandects of Justinian, notions more correct gradually gained ground to the excitement of disgust against the absurdities in practice, ordeals and the admission of the defendant's oath in his own purga tion. Edward the first, the Justinian of England, as I have observed in my twenty-third chapter, was the great improver of both the written and unwritten law. The former, more frequently called the statute law, consists of statutes expressly enacted by the legislature, more commonly known by the name of acts of parliament. The latter, called also the com mon law, has the title of unwritten, because, though it"], [720, "198 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXIX Accession of Richard the second. 1377 it is found in books and records, it owes not its sanction to any express declaration of the legislature, but merely to immemorial custom, for the oiigin of which no written authority is known. The system received additional advances toward refinement in the reign of Edward the third, when such changes were found to have taken place in the state of the country or the minds of men, that, in 1362, a statute was enacted commanding the use of the Englissi language in the pleadings of all courts, royal or baronial. Not friendly to the progress of improvement was the accession of a minor to the throne. On the death of the venerated Black prince in 1376, his son by the princess of Wales, his cousin, called Richard of Bourdeax from the place of his birth, then in his eleventh year, had, on the petition of both houses of parliament, been vested with all his father's honours and possessions, and introduced into the national assembly, that the members might have the pleasure of beholding this only representative of their beloved prince, and of paying their duty to him as heir apparent to the crown. On the acces sion of this young prince, under the title of Richard the second, in the following year, after the death of his grandfather, who had neglected to appoint a regency, a council of nine was nominated for that purpose by the house of lords, in consequence of a petition from the commons : but the kingdom was in fact governed by the influence of the young king's three uncles, the eldest of whom, John of Gaunt, duke"], [721, "BRITISH ILANDS; 199 Ch ,p XXIX WatTyier's insurrection 1381 duke of Lancaster, proud, passionate, and unpo pular, was by his superior authority the virtual regent. The late monarch had left his kingdom in a state of hostility with France, Castile, and Scotland. The expences of the war with France, with the want of \u0153conomy in the reign of a minor, so ex hausted the treasury, that a most oppressive impost was decreed by parliament in 1380, a poll tax of three groats on every person in the kingdom above the age of fifteen, without distinction of rank or sex,\" in the levying of which the deficiencies of the poorer were ordered, by an indefinite clause, to be compensated by the richer. The grievance was augmented by the rigours and abuses of collection, as the tax was farmed in the several counties. The peasants, almost or altogether slaves throughout England, had begun to conceive, in the dawn of political knowledge, a more lively sense of their depressed condition, and some rude notions of the the rights of man, particularly from the preaching of John Ball, a seditious friar, who, instead of christian duties, declaimed on the natural equality of the human species. Exasperated by this new grievance of a galling impost, they became so in flammable, that a spark was sufficient to excite a conflagration. A tiler in Deptford, according to some, according to others a blacksmith in Essex, gave a beginning to the tumult. A collector, to whom this man refused the tax for his daughter, whom he asserted to be below the age of fifteen, seized the girl with the design of producing an in- decent"], [722, "HISTORY OF THE 200 Chap XXIX decent proof of her being above that age. The father in a fury broke his skull with a hammer. The people around applauded the deed, and, dreading vengeance for the collector's death, incited their neighbours to arms. The flame of insurrection was propagated with amazing rapidity through the eastern counties. The peasants assembled in multi tudes under various leaders, who seem to have assumed their names from rustic and mechanic occu pations, as Wat Tyler, Jack Straw, Hob Carter, and Tom Miller. In the conduct of slaves, rising suddenly into rebel lion with tumultuous fury, very little of either system or decorum can be supposed. Designs the most atrocious are charged by writers to these insur gents, as the extermination of the nobles and gentry ; and, since the most ferocious and profligate com monly take the lead on such occasions, the inten tions of some might have been of that nature. But, as Hume has observed, \" of all the evils attending human society, the insurrection of the populace, when not raised and supported by persons of higher quality, is the least to be dreaded. The mischiefs consequent on an abolition of \"all rank and distinction become so great, that they are immediately felt, and soon bring back affairs to their former order and arrangement.\" An immense multitude of insur gents, vaguely stated at a hundred thousand, assem bled on Black heath, in the June of 1381, under Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, whence they sent a message requesting a conference with the king. The young monarch, who, in this unexpected rebellion, in"], [723, "2D1 C-HAP. XXIX. BRITISH ILANDS. in the absence of his three uncles, had taken refuge in the tower of London, seised down the Thames, in a barge, to give audience, by appointment, to the rebels on its banks ; but, intimidated by their ssiouts, which, though terrific, were probably meant not otherwise than in congratulation, he returned to his fortress without hearing their demands. Still more inflamed by this disappointment, the rebels russied into London, committed pillage and massacre, burned the palace of Savoy and the temple with its valuable records. The king, leaving the tower, which was unpro vided for a siege, met, by appointment, at Mile-end, a great body of the rioters, whose demands were a general pardon, the abolition of slavery, freedom of commerce in market towns without toll or impost, and a fixed rent on lands instead of the personal ser vices of villanage, which was a species of slavery. With these requisitions, reasonable and just, but above the notions of the times, and tending to a too sudden revolution when extorted by force, the young monarch complied by signing charters to that pur pose ; on which this multitude, satisfied with the attainment, as they thought, of their object, dis persed to their several homes. But, in the mean time, another body forced their way into the tower, and beheaded several persons of distinction, particu larly Simon Sudbury, primate and chancellor. In passing through Smithfield, the king was met by a vast mob conducted by Wat Tyler, who, leaving his followers at some distance, rode intrepidly into the royal train, and behaved with such insolence, that"], [724, "HISTORY OF THE 202 Chap XXIX Character of Richard that Walworth, the mayor of London, losing all patience, struck him to the ground with his sword, where he was instantly dispatched by others. Richard, in the critical moment, with admirable presence of mind, hasted alone to the enraged multitude, and exhorted them not to be grieved for the loss of their conductor, but to follow him, who was their king, and would be their leader. In a stupid surprise, without agitators to prompt them, they suffered him to conduct them to the fields, where he peaceably dismissed them with charters, without permitting a body of troops to attack them, which had been hastily collected, and had followed them from the city. By some military operations, and the news of Wat Tyler's death, who is supposed by some to have been the same who kiiled the insolent collector, the insurgents dispersed in other parts of the country, insomuch that in a few days this terrible com motion subsided into a calm. Having assembled, by a general summons, an army of forty thousand, the king, by proclamation, and afterwards an act of parliament, revoked all the charters which he had granted ; thus consigning the common people to their former state of slavery. Also to try the culprits justices were sent into the several counties, who acted with such rigour, that not less than fifteen hundred are said to have been executed.

He was beautiful in person, and seems to have been so well endowed by nature, that, if he had been educated in the school of adversity, he might have become perhaps a great and a good king. But his education was totally neglected, and his youth corrupted by feasting, dissipation, and the company of dissolute anc worthless persons, who are always the most for ward to insinuate themselves into the favour of the young in high rank. Hence he contracted habits which unfitted him for governing, so that, as Hume observes, \" he was violent in his temper, profuse in his expences, fond of idle ssiow and magnificence, devoted to favourites, and addicted to pleasure; passions, all of them, the most inconsistent with a prudent ceconomy, and consequently dangerous in a limited and mixed government.\" The weakness of the monarch encouraged the chief nobility, with his uncle, the duke of Glo cester, at their head, in the absence of John of Gaunt in Spain, to usurp the sovereign power, and to destroy the royal favourites. Under their influ ence the house of commons, in the October of 1386, impeached Michael de la Pose, earl of Suffolk, one of these favourites, who, on frivolous charges, was degraded from the office of chancellor. The king was obliged by this parliament to sign a commission of regency, by which the government of the king- dom"], [726, "20-t- Chap. XXIX HISTORY OF THE dom was for one year committed to fourteen persons. Uneasy under this virtual dethronement, which might perhaps not cease at the term specified, Richard, after a consultation at Nottingham with his confidants, in the August of the following year, proposed queries to the judges ; and these, in writ ten answers, declared all, who acted under such commission, guilty of treason. To prevent his de sign of resuming the regal power, the ruling faction, on his return to London, surrounded him with numerous forces, made a formal accusation against his favourites, procured their condemnation in par liament in the February of 1388, and put those to death who effected not their escape. The judges, who had answered the queries, were capitally con demned, but their sentence was changed into banissi ment to Ireland. Michael de la Pole and Robert de Vere escaped beyond sea ; the former to Paris where he died the fame year; the latter to Holland, where he ended his days four years after. This Robert, created duke of Ireland, had raised forces in the king's defense, but was defeated in Oxford ssiire. By the violent proceedings of this parliament, with little regard to law or justice, in a session of four months, the longest until that time known in England, the power of the aristocracy might have seemed immoveably confirmed ; yet, from causes not recorded, and left to conjecture, the king found himself able, in less than a year, to re-establissi the regal authority. Entering the council, in the May of 1389, at the age of twenty-three, he demanded with"], [727, "BRITISH II.ANDS. 205 with a resolute tone whether he was not sufficiently Chap. mature in years for holding in his own hands the XXIX reins of government ? and when no body ventured to reply in the negative, he instantly proceeded to displace all the ministers appointed by the aristocratic junto, and to nominate others in their room. In his triumph over a party, who had by such blood ssied endeavoured to fix their dominion, he acted with very prudent moderation, proclaiming a general pardon, and resigning some taxes which had been voted by parliament.

The hostilities with 1 377 the last, consisting of reciprocal incursions for devaf- j_;a;/\u00bb ration and plunder, without any action of impor tance, will be noticed hereafter. At first the French appeared to prosecute the war with vigour. An armament, in the August of 1377, plundered the ile of Wight, burned the town of Hastings, and made other attempts on the coast, without, how ever, the fame-success. But the French king, Charles the fifth, furnamed the wise, found so much employment at home as to divert his attention from foreign enterprises ; and, before he could dislodge the Englissi from their posts in his kingdom, he died in the September of 1379, leaving his domi nions to his son, a minor, Charles the sixth. Two attempts against France had previously been made by the Englissi. An army under John of Gaunt, debarking in Brittanny, in 1378, laid siege to Saint-Malo, but was baffled, and returned home without"], [728, "203 Chap. XXIX HISTORY OF THE without advantage. In the following year the duke of Glocester led another body of troops from Calais to Brittanny to the assistance of Mountfort, the duke of that province, marking, unopposed, his way with devastation : but, as Mountfort entered into nego tiations with the new sovereign of France, and concluded a treaty with him in 1381, this expedi tion proved also fruitless. 1 he war between the two kingdoms was tedious, languid, and interrupted by truces. A martial prelate, the bissiop of Norwich, led an army to the Netherlands in 1383, where he made a considerable progress, but was in the end obliged to evacuate the country, and return home with ssiattered troops. With Castile a naval warfare only was maintained, till John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, brought a force to vindicate his claim to the Castilian crown, in right of his wife, a daughter of Peter the cruel. Landing at Corunna, in the August of 1386, the Englissi prince, in conjunction with the king of Portugal, with whom he soon formed a close alli ance by giving him in marriage his eldest daughter, gained possession of some towns in Gallicia and Leon : but in the succeeding year he was more powerfully resisted ; two thirds of his men died by sickness ; himself was dangerously diseased ; and he retired with the miserable remnant of his troops to Guienne, whose inhabitants had revolted to the Englissi government. Yet the Castilian monarch, for the prevention of new attempts, made a treaty with him in 1388; marrying his eldest son to a daughter of the duke, the heiress of the regal claim derived"], [729, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 207 Chap.

In the absence of so great a part of the military force of the Englissi as accompanied the duke of Lancaster to Spain, the French prepared an arma ment of twelve hundred ships, and above sixty thousand men for the invasion of England, in 1386: but, from various delays and disappointments, the design was at length relinquissied ; while, on the other hand numerous captures of trading vessels were made by the Englissi navy. Tired with a long state of hostility, indecisive anctslow from the weak ness of both parties, the Englissi and French monarchs agreed, in 1389, to a truce for three years, which they afterwards prolonged to the year 1396, when it was renewed for twenty-five years, on the conclusion of a treaty of marriage between a daughter of the French king, a child under the age of eight, and king Richard, whose former wife, a sister of Winceslaus, king of Bohemia, had been some time dead. Of the public contempt incurred by Richard, by his low pleasures, dissolute life, and vain profusion, advantage was taken by his uncle, the duke of Glocester, who, enraged at finding himself destitute of influence in the administration, made exertions to inflame the national discontent, and was even suspected of caballing for the king's dethronement. Richard caused the duke to be suddenly seized, in the July of 1397, and conveyed to Calais, a place secure from attempts of rescue, where he in a ssiort time"], [730, "scs Chap, XXIX. HISTORY QF THE time died by private assassination, though his death was declared to have been caused by apoplexy. In the ensuing September he assembled a parliament, which was so fully at his devotion as to annul all the acts passed under the commission of the aristo- cratical junto, and to consign to death or banissiment some lords who had acted under that authority, though they were not accused of any other crime, and had freely received, in the most ample form, the royal pardon, above eight years before. All the members, lords and commons, took a solemn oath for the perpetual establissiment of the acts now passed ; and a bull was besides procured from the pope for their confirmation. Similar oaths had been exacted by Glocester's party for the perpetual establissiment of decrees quite contrary to the pre- sent. From the obscure annals of the times we are furnissied with facts without explanations ; but, as Hume has observed, \" both parties, in their succes- sive triumphs, seem to have had no farther concern than that of retaliating upon their adversaries ; and neither of them were aware, that, in imitating, they indirectly justified, as far as lay in their power, all the illegal violences of the opposite party. The ancient history of England is nothing but a catalogue of reversals. Every thing is a fluctuation of move- ment. One faction is continually undoing what was established by another : and the multiplied oaths, which each party required for the security of the present acts, betray a perpetual consciousness of their instability.\" After"], [731, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 209 Chap.

Norfolk gave the lie, with a challenge to judicial combat ; and, as this affair might require the interference of the legislature, the parliament, rather than prolong its session, delegated its whole power to a committee of twelve lords and six com moners. When, in the September of that year, the combatants appeared at Coventry, amid a vast concourse of spectators, ready to engage, the king, by advice of the committee, interdicted the duel, and pronounced a sentence of banissiment on both ; for ten years on Hereford, for life on Norfolk ; and assigned them different countries for their places of exile. Soon after their departure from the king dom, died John of Gaunt, father of the banished Henry, who, as heir to the deceased, claimed to be admitted by his attorney to the estates and jurisdic tions of the dutchy of Lancaster, according to the king's promise and setters patent: but Richard, supported by the committee, revoked the letters patent, seized the estates, and banissied the attorney.

XXIX Deposition and death of Richard, 1399 of embarking in an expedition to Ireland, in the May of 1399, carrying with him all his powerful adherents, and thus leaving his kingdom exposed to the attempts of his enemies. In the absence of theking in this expedition, of which and of a former, I shall speak hereafter, Henry took his departure from Paris, and, sailing from Nantes with a small armament, landed at Ravenspur in Yorkssiire in the July of 1399, where he was joined by the potent earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland. Having taken a solemn oath that his sole object was the recovery of his dutchy of Lancaster, he was so reinforced, in his progress toward the south, that his army was said to have at length amounted to the number of sixty thousand. The duke of York, the only surviving uncle of the king, a prince of slender capacity, who had been left guardian of the king dom, assembled a body of forty thousand at Saint- Alban's : but these, with their leader, after some negotiation, instead of opposing, coalesced with the troops of Henry, who thus became undisputed master of the realm. Richard, returning home, on the news of this invasion, landed, in August, at Milford, with twenty thousand men ; but, per ceiving after his too late arrival, the desperate state of his astairs, he disoanded his troops, and retired to Conway, whence he at first intended to retire for refuge to France or Ireland; but he afterwards adopted a measure in his situation the most impru dent, negociation with his enemy. Dreading the consequences of his flight, Henry sent to him the earl of Northumberland, who, deceiving him by false"], [733, "BRITISH ILANDS. 211 Chap XXIX Accession of Henry the fourth. 1399 false oaths into a belief of intended submission to his royal power, brought him to Flint castle to his enemy, whence he was conveyed a prisoner to the tower of London. Seeing himself master of the king and kingdom, Henry no longer confined his claim to the dutchy of Lancaster, but aspired to the crown A resigna tion of the regal dignity was extorted from Richard, and a charge of thirty-three articles, mostly frivolous or confutable, was exhibited against him in parliament, where his deposition was solemnly decreed, without a dissenting voice, except that of one man, whose mind was superior to the times, Thomas Merks, bissiop of Carlisle, who magnanimously defended the cause of his unfortunate sovereign by a noble speech, and who, in consequence, was instantly arrested, by order of Henry, and sent to prison. Richard soon after died in secret confinement, but the manner and exact time of his death are not known. The most probable account is that he was starved to death in the castle of Pomfret in York ssiire. He left no children legitimate or illegiti mate. When, on the arrest of the generous prelate, the deposition of Richard was unanimously decreed by parliament, and the throne was thus, become vacant, Henry, stepping forward, and crossing him self on the forehead and breast, pronounced the fol io ving remarkable words, which are given by most writers in the original language. \" In the name of Fadher, Son, and Holy Ghost, I, Henry of Lancaster, challenge this rewme of Ynglonde, and P 2 the"], [734, "HISTORY OF THE 212 Chap XXIX the croune, with all the members and the appur tenances, als I that am descendit be ryght lyne of the blode, cumyng fra the gude lorde king Henry thirde, and throghe that ryght that God of his Grace hath sent me, with helpe of my kyn, and of my frendes, to recover it ; the whiche rewme was in poynt to be ondone for defaut of govern ance and ondoying of the gude lawes.\" In this strange speech he made obscure hints at a right to the crown by inheritance, by fortune of arms, and by his merit in rescuing the nation from tyrannical government ; but he dared not explicitly to avow any of those grounds of claim ; since the last would have implied election, which confers not more than an infirm title ; since the second, as implying con quest, would be invidious ; and since the first was Without foundation, when another person stood before him in the line of succession, as 1 ssiall have occasi on to state hereafter.

Of the ancient Gothic tongue, the parent of the Englissi, the oldest existing monument is a mutilated copy of the four Gospels, translated into that language by Ulphilas, the apostle and bissiop of the Goths, in the fourth century. From this curious monument, collated in the twelfth volume of the Arch\u0153ologia with the Englissi translation, the old Gothic appears to have been a kind of medial speech between the ancient Greek and English. Of the two main dialects, into which the Gothic is divided, the German and the Scandinavian, the language of Ulphilas bears a far greater resemblance to the for mer, of which the Belgic is a branch, the chief component of the Englissi. In the ancient Englissi tongue,"], [736, "21 + Chap XXX HISTORY OF THE tongue, or Anglo-Belgic, improperly called Saxon, as in all other dialects of the Gothic, nouns and verbs were inflected by changing the terminations, as in Greek and Latin. It also resembled these most noble languages in its abounding in vowels and polysyllables, which rendered it sonorous, and capable of being formed into compositions of either verse or prose delightful to the ear. Some idea of its state at the end of the ninth century may be con ceived from the following sentences in Roman letters, translated into modern English in Italics. These are the first in the journal of Othere's voyage, mentioned in my fifth chapter. The translation is taken from Turner's history of the Anglo-Saxons. \" Othere f\u00e6de his hlaforde, \u00c6lfrede kyninege, th\u00e6t he ealra Northmanna north mest bude. Ohthere said to his lord, king Alfred, that he abode the mrth- most of all the Northmen. He cw\u00e6th th\u00e6t he bude on th\u00e6m lande northeweardum withtha west see.

They hunt in winter, and in summer they fist in the sea.\" Also to (hew in some degree the state of this language immediately before the Norman conquest, I select the following from a charter of king Harold, translated in Henry's history of Britain. \" And Ich bidde"], [737, "BRITISH ILANDS. 215 Chap.

So as I confidence in you have, that you will for my love. After the Norman conquest, from the institutions of the first William, and the great intercourse main- tained with the French provinces under the Englissi crown, the French became the language of all the gentry, of all transactions in the courts of law, and of all public business. The Englissi tongue, though abandoned thus to the vulgar classes for three centu- ries, yet still continuing to be the common speech of far the greater part of the nation, gained ground at length, when, by the wars of Edward the third, a national antipathy against France had been excited in the nobles of England, who had hitherto regard- ed themselves rather as French than as Englissi ; and when writings composed in Englissi in the fourteenth century, particularly the poetic works of Gower, Barbour, and, above all, of Chaucer, had, by their merit of novelty, so attracted the public notice as to have become subjects of general reading. In 1362 all pleadings in courts of justice were commanded by the legislature to be performed in the vernacular language: and in 1385, as we are informed by John de Trevifa, a cotemporary writer, this language had gained such an ascendency, that in it, instead of"], [738, "HISTORY OF THE 216 Chap, XXX of in French, as had been the custom since the conquest, were the rudiments of Grammar taught or explained in the schools throughout England. In a state of depression, however, under the predominance of a foreign language, the Engliih tongue, in the course of three centuries, had under gone a great alteration. It had adopted from the French a multitude of words, which remain con stitutionally imbodied with our vernacular speech, but with a pronunciation different from that of the present inhabitants of France. It had received an entirely new grammatical modification, having lost its inflections, and supplied their place with prepo sitions and auxiliary-verbs. The fame has happened in other parts of the world in similar cases. Thus, in consequence of the conquest of Italy by the Goths, a new language, the modern Italian, was gradually formed, composed principally of words from the Latin, the old language of the country, newmodeled under a different grammatical arrange ment, where auxiliary verbs, articles, and preposi tions supersede, in great measure, the use of con jugations and declensions, the management of which was too nice or too troublesome to the Gothic settlers. In like manner also have been formed the modern French and Spanissi tongues. All these modern languages have, in respect of sound, been more fortunate in their formation than ours, which is harssi by its monosyllables and incessant collision of consonants. If the English tongue had retained until now its ancient grammatical structure, with its vowels and polysyllables, it might perhaps have been so"], [739, "BRITISH 1LANDS. 217 so polissied by the labours of the learned in the Chap. \"X \"X\"X eighteenth century, as to rival the Latin, or even ,yy^ Greek, in elegant smoothness and harmony of diction. In fact, until the eighteenth century, this language attained no settled form, especially in spelling, as I shall have occasion to observe more particularly hereafter. Of the Pictissi tongue, the ancient language of 0f Scotland, doubtless an unwritten speech, we have *nc,e!\" \u00bb ' bcottiah. no specimen : but, that it was a dialect of the Scandinavian Gothic, is inferred from circumstances, particularly from the manifest similitude of the vul gar speech of the present Lowland Scots to the Norwegian, Swedish, and Danissi tongues. That the Pictissi like the other ancient dialects of the Gothic, had inflections of nouns and verbs, we have no room to doubt, nor that these were lost by the prevalence of the English, a written language of kindred origin, learned by those , Scots who were taught to read, and adopted by writers of that nation. This aseendencv of the written language of a comparatively greater and civilized people, over an unwritten- dialect in the fame iland, must appear quite natural, when we consider that a great intercourse subsisted between the Englissi and Scottish nations; that many noble Anglo-Norman families had settled among the Scots ; and that many small burghs, or corporate towns, in Scotland were inha bited by Englissimen.

HISTORY OF THE poet, in the latter part of that century, for the entertainment of his countrymen, is somewhat more intelligible to an Englissi reader of the present day than the works of any Englissi poet of that time. F In dress, which in the reign of Richard the second rose to the summit of extravagance in Eng- land, we may naturally suppose the Scots to have followed the Englissi modes as much as in writing. To describe the several variations of attire, which had happened in Britain before this period, would be tedious. At the time of the Norman conquest, the dress of the Englissi gentry consisted in general of a linen shirt ; a vest or tunic, with or without sleeves, fitted closely to the body, and descending half way down the thigh ; a girdle round the waist, in which the sword was fixed in an almost perpen- dicular position ; a kind of trowsers extending at least so low as the knee ; a cloak, or mantle, fastened on the right shoulder by a button, and falling to the ancles behind and before, but scarcely to the knees at the sides ; wooden ssioes, and a kind of hose, or stockings of cloth, made to sit closely on the legs by bandages drawn around in a spiral form. They wore the hair of the head long, but ssiaved the beard, except mustaches on the upper lip. They seem not to have been in the habit of changing so frequently the inmost garment as their posterity at present, since we find the warm bath to have been considered by them as a necessary of life. The attire of the females was not very different from that of the other sex, except that the bosom was not covered by the tunic, the ssiirts of which reached as low"], [741, "BRITISH II.ANDS. 219 Chap. XXX, low as the feet, the sleeves no farther than the elbow; and that the cloak, in which were openings in the sides for the arms, flowed on all sides to the ground, and was fastened by a button on the breast. Both sexes were fond of costly ornaments, such as chains and bracelets of gold. T he head was covered with a bonnet of cloth, like that of the modern Scottissi Highlanders. The fassiions of these garments underwent, by caprice, a variety of alterations in succeeding times, but in none so strangely whimsical as in the latter part of the fourteenth century. The giddy intoxica- tion produced in the public mind by the splendid, though fruitless, victories of Edward the third, and by the plunder brought from France, to the damage of the one country, without any real advantage to the other, inflamed the fantastic humour of the Englissi nobles for perpetual changes in modes of dress, which by the example of a dissipated prince and court, in the reign of Richard the second, was carried to a surprising pitch of absurdity. A speci- men of the changing fassiions of the age was a dress consisting of a tunic or coat, white in one half, and black or blue in the other; a silken hood, em- broidered with grotesque figures, and buttoned under the chin ; ssiort trowsers or drawers, which reached not so low as the middle of the thigh, and displayed to the eye the shape of all the parts included within them ; hose of one colour on one leg, and of a different colour on the other ; and ssioes pointed before, and of such a length as to be made fast to chains of gold or silver hanging from the knees, without"], [742, "220 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXX Diet without which the wearer would be disabled from walking. With these was also worn a long beard, quite contrary to the general custom after the Nor man conquest, when to ssiave all the hair from the lips and chin had become fassiionable. Extravagance in feasting, which, together with intemperance in drinking, is charged by cotempo rary writers to the Englissi of those times, was encouraged in a high degree by the example of the fame unfortunate monarch, who is said to have maintained in his household, at various tables, sup plied with provisions at the royal expence, not less than ten thousand persons, of whom three hundred belonged to the department of the kitchen. The great barons, in like manner, maintained in propor tion very numerous households ; and as agriculture was in so imperfect a state as to produce, except some hay, no food for cattle in winter, all carcases, even those of ssieep, intended for the supply of that season, were salted at its commencement. Of the quantities put in store some conception may be formed from the petition of the elder Spenser to parliament, in the reign of Edward the second, stating the losses sustained by the ravages committed on his lands by the hostile barons. Though these ravages had not place till after the third of May, when far the greater part of the salted stock had been consumed, the provision of this kind, still remaining in the larder, consisted of eighty carcases of beef, six hundred of bacon, and as many of mutton. Some"], [743, "BRITISH ILANDS. 221 Chap XXX Character of Henry the fourth Some species of food, not now admitted, were in use among the ancient Englifli. Thus the people of Northumbria, descendants of the Danes, were fond of the flessi of horses. Improvements in cookery took place after the Norman conquest. Several dissies, brought then to table, are now unknown ; and some, as the flessi of cranes, though known, have been long disused. The principal drinks were ale and cider. Mead was less common. A still greater delicacy was morat, a compound from honey and the juice of mulberries. Pigment or pyment, ypocrass, and claret, were mixtures made from wine, honey, and spices, in different propor tions. The stated meals were two in the day; dinner about nine o'clock in the morning, and supper about five in the afternoon, even in the houses of the great. At extraordinary feasts were entertainments of what were called intermeats, delicacies introduced between the courses, and some times, at royal banquets, accompanied with repre sentations of battles, sieges, or other mimic exhibi tions. Where the intellect remained unenlightened by a diffusion of genuine literature, the changing fashions continued to be absurd, and the manners unim proved, notwithstanding that the example of Henry the fourth was very different from that of his unfor tunate predecessor. Far superior in abilities, and more fortunate in appearance, the former in reality ought to be regarded as more unhapy than the latter.

Ambition, and the desire of placing himself in full security from the resentment of his sovereign, had induced him to seize the opportunity, afforded by the rassi and violent zeal of the people, of seating himself on the throne. To prevent his own ruin in the restoration of his rival, when the tide of popular favour began to turn, he had advanced to the last act of criminality, the murder of the deposed monarch. The great popularity, by which he had been enabled to become a usurper, began quickly to subside, and a hatred to succeed for the crimes into which he had been successively led by a natural gradation. During eight years from the commencement of his reign he was agitated with almost incestant plots and insurrections, in the coun- teracting and suppressing of which he displayed a most cool and steady courage, and an admirable prudence, vigilance, foresight, and command of temper. Though, by the exertion of such talents as might have rendered his kingdom prosperous, if he had acquired the sovereignty by indubitable right, he procured for his latter years external tranquillity ; yet, from previous perturbations, and a conscious- ness of guilt and of the public hatred, he enjoyed neither peace of mind nor health of body. The qualities of his head were superior to those of his heart. He sacrificed every feeling to the acquire ment and retention of the regal dignity.

When once this monarch, named Henry of Bo lingbroke from the place of his birth, and had gained full possession of the crown, he found himself in volved in dangers from enemies both foreign and domestic ; the king of France, whose daughter had been espoused by Richard ; the Scots, the allies of France; and those Englissi nobles who had been de prived of estates conferred on them by the favour of the late sovereign. These nobles formed a plot for his assassination at a tournament, advertised to be held at Oxford in the January of 1400. The exe cution of their design was prevented by one of their associates, the principal plotter, a man practised in treachery, the earl of Rutland, who privately in formed the king on the day preceding that of the tournament. Finding by Henry's absence that their plan was betrayed, the conspirators hasted with troops to Windsor, in the hope of seizing his person there.; but he had thence retired to London. On this dis appointment, they made proclamation, that Richard had escaped from prison, and commanded all his subjects to repair to his standard against the usurper. This hastened the death of that ill-fated prince. Hearing that Henry was approaching at the head of twenty thousand men, they dispersed, were pursued, captured, and put to death with their principal ad herents. Their quarters were brought to London, and carried in a triumphal procession of the exulting populace, among whom were fifty bissiops and mi tred abbots, and the infamous earl of Rutland, dis- playing"], [746, "22.

This, with the open infractions of the oaths, taken by both houses of parliament in the time of Richard, may furnish a specimen of bar barous manners in the ages of chivalry. Reciprocal incursions were made by the Scots and Englissi, in one of which, the last conducted into the Scottissi territories by an Englissi monarch in person, Henry advanced to Edinburg, in the Au gust of 1400, and returned without a battle, per haps prematurely recalled by a revolt of the Welch, who continued seme years to defy his arms. In 1402, while Henry was engaged with the Welch insur gents, ten thousand Scots, under earl Douglas, ra vaged the country 'to the gates of Newcastle ; but were intercepted in their return, near Milfield in Northumberland, by an army under the earl of that county, and his son, Henry Percy, surnamed Hot spur from his impetuous valour. On the fourteenth of September, the troops of Douglas, embattled on the hill of Homildon, were assailed with such ssiowers of arrows from the Englissi archers, that they were totally routed with terrible slaughter, without any assistance of the heavy armed Englissi, who had no opportunity of being other than spectators of the battle. The exquisitely tempered armour of Doug las, as he advanced to make a charge, was pierced with five arrows. His wounds were not mortal, but he lost an eye, and was, together with near thirty men of eminent rank, taken prisoner. Many of high distinction w.re also among the slain. Rejoiced at"], [747, "BRITISH ILANDS. 225 Chap, XXX. at the news, king Henry commanded the victorious earl not to liberate for any ransom his noble pri soner, as he hoped to draw great advantage, in a treaty with Scotland, from the incident of their capture. But the Percies, thinking this mo march, whom they had raised to the throne, not sufficiently grateful, were already discontented ; and, as this command infringed the rights of captors then sanctioned by custom, they were so inflamed that they entered into a league with Douglas and the Welch for the dethronement of Henry, and the enthronement of young Mortimer, earl of March, the rightful heir, descended from Lionel, duke of Clarence, the elder brother of Henry's father. An army of the Percies, combined with the troops of Douglas, who had been liberated on the occa sion, advanced under Hotspur, to Shrewssiury, in the July of 1403, with the design of a junction with the Welch. This was prevented by the prudence of the king, who, sensible of the great importance of celerity in his situation, made all possible haste to give battle before the reinforcement of the foe. The impatient Hotspur, not awaiting the aid of his fa ther, who had promised to follow with another army, but was too flow in his outset, withheld not from his opponent the opportunity of early decision. In the morning of the twenty-first of July, the two armies, nearly equal, consisting each of twelve or fourteen thousand men, commanded by leaders of consummate courage and the fiercest hatred, en gaged on the plains of Hartlesield near Shrewsbury, with a ssiock perhaps as furious as imagination can Vot.

As Henry, either to elude the attacks of the enemy on his person, or to encourage his men by the appearance of the royal presence in several places, had caused a number of his officers to be ar rayed like himself, the sword of Douglas, who per formed feats of arms almost incredible, and was determined on the utmost efforts for the king's de struction, lendered fatal to many the honour of this disguise. After three hours of a desperate and doubt ful conflict, the death of Hotspur, by an unknown hand, so dismayed his troops, that they fled, and left the victory to the king. Their loss was said to be about four thousand, beside about two thousand prisoners, among whom was Douglas. Above two thousand, among whom was a great proportion of nobles, sell on the side of Henry, who caused, after the battle, the Englissi lords, taken in rebellion, to be executed, but the Scottissi champion to be treated with courtesy. Some lenient measures, which were quickly after adopted by the king, induced the earl of Northum berland, who was advancing too late with hi's troops, to throw himself upon the royal mercy. The earl received a pardon ; but, as he had reason to think that he never would be trusted, nor cordially for given, he entered into a new conspiracy with Poch ard Scrope, archbissiop of York, and others, who might have been successful, if they had early enough taken arms for the seconding of Hotspur. While the king was collecting forces with all possible haste, Ealph Nevil, earl of Westmoreland, instantly marched, in the Tv.ay of 1405, to attack the arch- bissiop's"], [749, "BRITISH ILANDS. 227 Chap XXX 1408 bissiop's army, on Shipton-moor near York, before it could be reinforced by the troops of Percy. Find ing it numerous beyond his expectation, he had re course to fraud and perjury, which, from the sim plicity of the prelate, met with success. Having, in consequence of a message to Scrope and his asso ciates, received a schedule of their demand, he de clared them to be perfectly reasonable, requested a conference with the chiefs of the insurgents in sight of both armies, granted every claim with all appear ance of most cordial sincerity, and swore to the ob servance of the treaty, and to the procuring of the king's ratification of it. On messages then sent, according to his proposal, with orders to the two armies to disband, the troops of the prelate imme diately dispersed, but those of the royalists, by pre vious arrangement, continued in their posts. Scrope and his associate leader, thus ensnared, were seized and put to death. The execution of this man, the first instance of capital punissiment of a bissiop in England, was attended with circumstances of mean insult and wanton cruelty. The earl of Northumberland, on intelligence of this affair, fled with lord Bardolf into Scotland, whence, after some time, these two nobles removed into Wales. Finding the strength of the Welch in surgents in a state of decline, they returned to Scot land, assembled a small force, and advanced into Yorkssiire to Bratnhammoor. Here they were at tacked, defeated, and slain by Sir Thomas Rokeby, in the February of 1408, while the king was hast ening toward them with troops from the south.

Owen ap Griffith Vaughan, lord of Glendowrdwy, commonly called Owen Glendour, descended from Lewellyn, the last of the ancient Welch princes, had, as a friend ess the late king Richard, been re garded, on the revolution, as an obnoxious person by the partizans of Henry, one of whom, Regi nald, lord Grey, of Ruthyn, possessed of extensive lands on the marches of Wales, thought the oppor tunity favourable for the aggrandizement of himself by the seizure of the estate of this Welch chieftain. Glendour by force of arms repelled the aggression. The king proclaimed him a rebel, and sent assistance to Grey. Glendour proclaimed himself prince of Wales, excited the Welch to insurrection, and made wasteful incursions on the Englissi borders. Henry, with numerous troops, in the June and October of 1401, marched against him into Wales, but return ed both limes without advantage, as the Welch, by their mountains, eluded his attack, and, on his re treat, renewed their incursions. In the following year Glendour gained two victories over the English, in the former of which he captured Grey, and in the setter the earl of March. The ransoming of this young lord, who was legal heir to the throne, was not permitted by the jealousy of the king, which augmented the disaffection of many in England. Successive expeditions were conducted into Wales, by"], [751, "BRITISH I LANDS. 220 by king Henry and his eldest son, with the fame Cb*p. kind of fortune as the two first : but when Glendour \u2022 was deprived of all hopes of assistance from Engiilh malcontents, his force declined by the desertion of many followers, who despaired of success. At length in 1409, when two of his bravest commanders were 1409. defeated and captured, while they were committing ravages in Shropssiire, all the rest of the Welch sub mitted to the Englissi government. Thus forsaken, he lurked six years in the country under various dis guises, and died in 141 5, at his daughter's house at Monington in the ssiire of Hereford. After the battle of Homildon, the transactions of Transac\", tions with the Englissi with the Scottissi nation consisted of s.o.Und. truces, petty incursions, and negociations for the \\io<z, ransom of Douglas and other Scottissi nobles pri- 1+13 soners in England. In 1405 accident threw into the hands of the Englissi monarch a captive still more illustrious. The king of Scotland, Robert the third, from apprehensions of his brother's dangerous am bition, was induced to send prince James, his son, the heir apparent, a boy in his eleventh year, to be educated in France. Captured near Flamborough head by an Englissi vessel, the prince was ungene rously confined in the tower of London, yet allowed an excellent education by Henry, who was enabled by the custody of such a personage to awe the Scot tissi government. Prince James remained in Eng land nineteen years ; but Douglas was liberated in 1407, on his giving hostages for a ransom of a thou sand marks. From"], [752, "230 HISTORY OF THE Chap.

The deposition and murder of Richard, who had been born at Bourdeaux, and whose father had been an object. of admiration for his heroism and amiable qualities, excited such resentment in the people of Guienne, that they threatened to re volt from the Englissi government. The advantage was seized by the French king, the father-in-law of Richard, and consequently the foe of his deposer : but, after the conquest of some territories, the Gas cons began to resume their long establissied attach ment to England, in which they were confirmed by the prudence of Henry, who conferred all places of trust on their nobles, and sent a body of troops to their assistance. From a state of intermitting frenzy of the French monarch, Charles the sixth, which rendered him, except at intervals, totally unfit for governing, the councils of the leading men of his court were so distracted, as to prevent their availing themselves of England's weakness, and to oblige them to stipulate a long truce for the restoration of Isabella, Richard's queen, whom, as being still a virgin, Henry was eager, for the fake of a French alliance, to have married to his own son. Notwithstanding this truce, many hostile acts were committed by the subjects of the French monarchy, without the acknowledged sanction of its govern ment, particularly the landing of twelve thousand men in Wales, in the year 1405, for the aid of Glendour. These, on the side of England, caused only remonstrances, and acts of retaliation by Eng lissi subjects without explicit orders from royal au- thority,"], [753, "BRITISH ILANDS. 231 Chap.

In the contest, thus rendered implacable between the two factions, the Englissi monarch, wissiing to foment the debilitating distractions of a rival king dom, sent a body of troops into France to assist the Burgundian party : but, on more tempting offers from the opposite side, he agreed in the following year, 1412, to join his forces with the Armagnacs, the partizans headed by the count of Armagnac, fa ther-in-law to the young duke of Orleans.

He was most eminently qualified for the duties of civil government and the opera tions of war, the miseries of which he considerably mitigated by a humane deportment and strictness of discipline. He was possessed of a courage which no danger could appal, tempered with a cool delibera tion which took advantage of every favourable cir cumstance.

XXXI 660, near the Syrian city of Samosata, famous for the birth of Lucian, is ascribed the foundation of the Paulician system, the professors of which affected a simple worssiip, rejecting the adoration of images, the intercession of saints, the virtue of relics, and the divinity of the blessed virgin. From the New Testament, not then allowed in the Roman or Greek church to be read by the laity, they took the rule of their faith, and held in principal veneration the epis tles of St. Paul. Doctrines more exceptionable, bor rowed from the Gnostic sect, have been imputed to the Paulicians, but these now stated, in which they con curred with the reformed churches of modern times, were more than sufficient to render them objects of persecution. Rebellion, after the martyrdom of many thousands, was the result at length of sacer dotal tyranny. During more than thirty years, in the latter part of the ninth century, these reli gionists, in Armenia, and the neighbouring parts of Asia minor, defied the arms, and wasted the terri tories, of the Greek empire ; and, even when they were finally overpowered, they continued to main tain the independence of their worssiip in the moun tains of these countries. Unable to subdue these obstinate sectaries, ren dered warlike and ferocious by the horrors of per. secution, the policy of the Greek emperors prevailed on great numbers, in the tenth century, under pro mise of toleration, to migrate from the neighbour hood of the Saracens, by whose arms they were as sisted, to the borders of Thrace and the adjoining regions, where their valour might be useful against the"], [759, "BRITISH ILANDS. 237 Chap, XXXI, the barbarians of the north. From these new posts in Europe, where they formed a strong barrier against the enemies of the Greek empire, their te nets were clandestinely propagated through the king doms of the west, where their reception was ren dered easier by the disgust which had been conceived from the avarice and despotism of the papal court, and from the pomp, the pride, the luxurious, and otherwise scandalous, lives of many among the cler gy. Chiefly in the country of the Albigensis, or Albigeois, in the south of France, were their opi nions deeply rooted, where a persecution, as horri ble and destructive as any recorded in the annals of the world, was executed in the thirteenth century by command of the pope. In the words of Gibbon, \" the visible assemblies of the Paulicians, or Albi geois, were extirpated by fire and sword ; and the bleeding remnant escaped by flight, concealment, or catholic conformity. But the invincible spirit, which they had kindled, still lived and breathed in the western world. In the state, in the church, and even in the cloister, a latent succession was preserved of the disciples of St. Paul, who protested against the tyranny of Rome, embraced the Bible as the rule of faith, and purified their creed from all the visions of the Gnostic theology.\" Of these the most active, bold, and successful in the fourteenth century, was John Wickliffe, a doc tor of Oxford, a most learned and pious man, who died in 1384, having translated the Holy Scripture into Englissi, and preached and written much against the corruptions of Rome. He had been furiously persecuted"], [760, "23 i Chap, XXXI HISTORY OF THE persecuted by the pope and the Englissi clergy, and had been twice obliged to appear before papal com missioners appointed to judge him ; but had been so favoured by the court, by some prime barons, par ticularly the duke of Lancaster, the father of Henry the fourth, and by the citizens of London, that they were unable to inflict any punissiment on him. By a treatise, written by him, against the claim of the sovereign pontiff to the tribute and homage from England yielded by king John, he had so gained the savour of Edward the third as to have been pre sented to some ecclesiastical benefices by that mo narch, who, after a compliance in some years of his minority, had refused forever in future, with the advice of his parliament, such a mark of subjection. The doctrines of Wickliffe, continued after his death, to be propagated with zeal by his disciples, termed Lollards, whose superiority in argument, over the clergy of the establissied church, was gravely ascrib ed by the latter to the inspiration of the devil. As the Englissi code contained no law which armed the civil magistrate for the suppression of heresy, till then so little known or apprehended in England, the clergy procured, in 1381, without the knowledge of the commons, the clandestine enrolment of a fictitious statute, by which the ssieriffs were commanded to seize and imprison the preachers and abettors of he retical opinions. The commons, in the following year, complained of the fraud, and procured a for mal repeal of the pretended law : but, by the art and influence of the clergy, this repeal was sup pressed, and the illegal statute retained in the code, where"], [761, "BRITISH ILANDS. 239 Chap XXXI. where to this day it remains. By imprisonments and menaces, and by the zeal of king Richard, who intimidated the noble favourers of the sectaries into the withdrawing of their protection from their preachers, the Lollards were so severely checked, that great numbers recanted. None suffered death, however, for heretical notions, in the reign of this monarch : but Henry the fourth, though he inter nally favoured the new religiqn, yet sensible of the dangers of his usurped situation, and of the great influence of the clergy, was determined by all means to gain that body to his interest, and, sacrificing his principles to his ambition, procured, immediately after his accession to the throne, a statute for the punissiment of heretics by committing them alive to the flames. This law was not permitted to lie long dormant. William Sawtre, rector of Saint-Oswyth in London, who confessed that he could not under stand the doctrine of transubstantiation, was, in the February of 1401, burned alive in Smithfield, the first who underwent this horrible punissiment for heresy in England. Though numbers were successively arrested, of whom some appear to have expired in prison, no second was found courageous enough to prefer to recantation a death so tremendous, till 1410, when Thomas Bad ly, a taylor, was in like manner martyred. Other victims were sacrificed in the reign of Henry the fifth, particularly Sir John Oldcastle, baron of Cobham, then regarded as the chief of the Lollard party. On account of his great valour and moral virtues, the king, in a personal conference, laboured to draw this"], [762, "210 Chap, XXXI War with France. 1415 HISTORY OF THE this nobleman by persuasion to a renunciation of sec tarian tenets. Disgusted by his religious obstinacy, though his behaviour was otherwise most respectful, Henry abandoned him to the rage of the clergy. In the same year, 141 3, he escaped from the tower, previously to the day fixed for his execution, and concealed himself in Wales. He is said to have formed in his retreat a conspiracy of the Lollards for the seizure of the king, and even his assassina tion. We have no evidence of so atrocious a design. We only know that a considerable body of these sectaries assembled, in the January of 1414, in the neighbourhood of London, in the fields near Saint Giles, where they were surprised by Henry, who had received intelligence of their meeting. Some were executed ; the rest pardoned ; and a reward of a thousand marks was offered by proclamation for the caption of Oldcastle, who yet was not taken till the year 1418. From the charge of treason, true or false, he was sentenced to be hanged, while to be burned alive was his doom for heresy. Whether by the former he in any degree escaped the pain of the latter, or was suspended alive in the flames by a chain round the middle, I have not been able to ascer tain. ' Though the belief of this conspiracy brought such odium on the Lollards as to disgrace their doctrines in the general estimation, yet their discourses had much contributed to'raise the public attention toward the abuses prevailing in the clerical system. Even many, who disregarded or disliked the speculative opinions of reformers, were anxious for a reforma- tion,"], [763, "BRITISH ILANDS. 241 Chap, XXXI tion, evidently most needful, in matters of disci pline. In this spirit the commons, in a parliament assembled soon after the suppression of the Lollard conspiracy, augmented to the utmost the rigours of the law against these sectaries, and afterwards ear nestly recommended to the king, as they had for merly recommended to his father, to seize, and to appropriate to the crown, for the national benefit, the revenues of the church. The clergy, in alarm, resigned forever to the king the lands of what were termed alien priories, lands in England belonging to Norman abbeys in France ; and also resolved to di vert the public attention to another object, by en gaging their sovereign in a war with the French mo narchy. Such a war had been recommended to Henry by his father on his death-bed, to prevent commotions at home by giving employment abroad to the active spirits of the Englissi. These incen tives appear not to have been necessary to the Englissi monarch. The distracted state of France, noticed at the end of the preceding chapter, was sufficient to allure a warlike and ambitious prince. Resolved on invasion, he made such demands as he could not expect to be granted by the French court, and col lected with all diligence a fleet and army. When king Henry was embarking his troops at Southampton, he discovered a plot for his dethrone ment in his absence, and for the raising of the earl of March to his place, formed'by some of his near kinsmen and chief favourites. These were con demned and executed without the due forms of law ; but the earl of March, who was probably innocent, Vol. II. R was"], [764, "242 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXI. V-J^VNw/ was fully pardoned. Debarking at Havre de Grace, in the August of 1 41 5, the Englissi monarch, after a siege of five weeks, became master of Harfleur, which he peopled with Englissi, having expelled the French inhabitants, and seized all their effects. His army, at first composed of six thousand heavy armed horsemen, and twenty-four thousand infantry, most ly archers, was so reduced by sickness in the siege, that he was unable to continue offensive operations ; and, as he conceived the reimbarkation of his forces on that part of the coast either dangerous or disgrace ful, he took the resolution of marching thence to Calais. This march was rassily undertaken, but most prudently conducted. With guarded caution, through all the obstacles of an enemy's country, while hostile troops were hovering around, watching for advantage, he proceeded by slow journeys to the river Somme. Prevented by a fortification of ssiarp stakes in the river's bottom, and by a formidable army on the opposite bank, from crossing the stream at the place where Edward the third had sound a passage, he was reduced to a situation altogether pe rilous, till he discovered a ford, higher up the river, near Bethencourt. Having passed at this place, and proceeded to the village of Azincourt in Artois, he* perceived that the French forces, which had hither to attended his motions, without venturing a pitched battle, had at length taken post directly in his way, with a determination to prevent his further retreat. Convinced that victory now alone could save him from ruin, he prepared with great caution and ac tivity for the unequal combat, declaring that, if he ssiould"], [765, "BRITISH 1I.ANDS. 243 Chap XXXI Battle of Azincourt, October 15 1415 ssiould be defeated, the number of his men, thus doomed to destruction, was too great; and \"that, if he ssiould be victorious, the glory would be higher in proportion to their paucity. In the lowest conception the host of the French was fourfold that of the Englissi, whose number seems little to have exceeded ten or twelve thousand, most of whom were in a state of weakness from hard ssiips and disease, yet roused to vigorous efforts by a sense of their situation, the recollection of former victories in similar circumstances, and a full reliance on the ability of their royal commander. By mere ly retaining his position with his army, the general of the French, the constable D'Albert, might have reduced the Englissi to inevitable ruin, as they must have either starved, surrendered, or abandoned their advantageous ground to attack the enemy's post without prospect of success. Urged by a vain con fidence in the vast superiority of their number and condition, the troops of D' Albert advanced against their foes, who were posted on a gentle declivity contracted between two woods. Each army was ar ranged in three lines. The Englissi van, composed of archers, and protected with portable palisadoes, stakes pointed at both extremities with iron, fastened at one end in the ground, and leaning with the other toward the enemy, sent incessant ssiowers of arrows, which in the dense host of the foe, crowded with deep files in a narrow space, made terrible execu tion. In the moment of extreme disorder, caused by their ssiafts, these archers, relinquissiing their bows, russied forward with their battleaxes, and dis- R 1 comfited-"], [766, "HISTORY OF THE 244 Chap XXXI comfited, with appalling havoc, a multitude so thronged as to be incapable either of resistance or retreat. The combat was renewed with the utmost fury, when the two second lines came into contact ; but that of the French was completely routed, when the duke of Alencon fell, who sacrificed his life in an attempt to kill the king of England. The third line of the French fled without fighting ; but some runaways had made a circuit, and plundered the Englissi camp. The alarm from this quarter caused the slaughter of many prisoners by the order of Henry, apprehensive of danger from their numbers in a renovation of an attack from the enemy, whom he for some time imagined to have rallied. This battle, fought on the twenty-fifth of Octo ber, 1415, resembling those of Cressy and Poictiers in the principal circumstances and immediate conse quences, was most fatal to France in the number of princes of the royal blood, and other nobles, cap tured or slain. The incumbrance of their armour in a rout, in a space so contracted and crowded, pre vented their escape. With a loss on the side of the Englissi, improbably alleged to have exceeded not a hundred, ten thousand are stated slain on that of the French, of whom above seven thousand are said to have been barons, knights, or gentlemen, as of such were composed the heavy armed troops. A number not less of men of the fame ranks were prisoners. The constable D'Albert was among the slain. Yet, if we except the wound thus given to France, and the spoil and prisoners acquired, the only fruit of this great victory to the Englissi monarch was the se- curing"], [767, "215 Chap XXXI Second in vasion of France. 1417, 1 422, 1 t BRITISH 1I.ANDS. curing of his retreat to Calais. Received with tri umphal exultation in England, where, from' the ex traordinary splendour of his vain exploit, he procur ed from parliament considerable supplies, he agreed to a truce with France, unable for near two yrears from financial deficiency, notwithstanding parlia mentary boons, to undertake any enterprise against that kingdom. While Henry, with all diligence, was preparing for a second invasion of France, that country was miserably distracted by the fury of the two contend ing parties mentioned in the preceding chapter, the Armagnacs and Burgundians. To the latter acceded the French queen, Isabella, fired with resentment, when, by the influence of the count of Armagnac, become constable of the kingdom, her treasures were seized, her person confined, and her principal fa vourite accused of gallantry with her, and cruelly put to death. She was liberated by the arms of the duke of Burgundy, who had been carried so far by enmity to his opponents, as to have entered into a league with the Englissi king for the raising of that monarch to the throne of France. The claim of Henry to that throne was, if possible, still worse than that of Edward the third, to whom he was not a legal successor even in the Englissi monarchy.

Not less than in war was the genius of Henry evinced in his negociations with the heads of the two factions which divided France. The Burgundians, who had obtained possession of the king's person, with the city of Paris, where their partizans had massacred near thirteen thousand men and five thou sand women, proclaimed queen Isabella regent of the kingdom, while by the opposite party, whose leader, the count of Armagnac, had perissied in the massacre, the same office was nominally conferred on the dauphin, the son of Isabella. The queen and the duke, who had a personal conference with the English king, brought near to a conclusion a treaty, by which that monarch was to receive in marriage the princess Catharine of France, with vast territo rial acquisitions. But, from disgust at the arro gance of Henry, or from a sense of the real interest of the French nation, the duke permitted himself to be persuaded to renounce the English alliance, and to form a league with the dauphin for the ex pulsion of the invader.

In a conference with the dauphin, in which to pre vent treachery all precautions on both sides had been taken, the duke was assassinated, in the September oF 1419, in revenge of the assassination already no ticed, of the dul.e of Orleans. So violent was the sage of the Burgundian party, particularly of the son and successor of the murdered grandee, that all considerations of national interest were sacrificed to the thirst of vengeance. Negociations with the king of England were, with excessive eagerness, renewed, and were carried to a conclusion in the May of 1420, in the treaty of Troyes, the principal terms of which were, that this monarch ssiould marry the princess Catharine, ssiould be regent of France during the life of its present king, Charles the sixth, and, at the death of this prince, should succeed to the French crown as the rightful heir, uniting forever under one sovereign, the kingdoms of France and England, which however ssiould retain their distinct privi leges. Having put into immediate execution the article of marriage in this treaty, the Englissi monarch pressed with vigour his military operations, on which depended the completion of the rest. He reduced the cities of Sens and Melun, and proceeded to Paris in the November of the fame year, where, ac companied by the king of France, his father-in-law, he was received by the citizens with joyful acclama tions.

This discomfiture was given by a body of seven thousand Scots, which had been led into France by John Stuart, earl of Buchan, son of the duke of Albany, who Was regent of Scot land. To prevent the operation of these auxiliars against him, Henry had brought, as his companion, into France, the Scottish monarch James, detained still in captivity ; but the command of a prince in that situation was disregarded by his subjects. On being informed of this check to the hitherto unin terrupted career of Henry's arms, pope Martin the fifth declared, in a ludicrous manner, that \" the Scots were the only antidote of the Englissi.\" Near thirty thousand fressi troops from England soon re covered to their king his former superiority. His most difficult enterprise was the reduction of Meaux, undertaken at the request of the Parisians, exaspe rated by the cruelty of its governor, the bastard of Vaurus, who hanged, on a particular oak-tree, every Englissiman and Burgundian whom he could seize. After a desperate siege of above seven months, in which no quarter was given on either side, the place was taken in the May of 1422, and the inhuman commander hanged on his own oak.

Leaving \"the regency of France to his eldest brother, the duke of Bedford, that of England to his younger, the duke of Glocester, and the care of his infant son to the earl of Warwick, he conjured them in his last moments to console his widowed queen ; to cultivate most sedulously the duke of Burgundy's friendssiip ; to detain as prisoners, till his successor ssiould have passed his minority, the French princes captured at Azincourt ; and to continue, without remission, the war with France, till his son ssiould have been firmly seated on the throne of that king dom, or at least the Norman dukedom annexed, in full sovereignty to the Englissi crown.

JnlENRY the sixth, born at Windsor, son of Henry the fifth and Catharine of France, was not quite nine months old at his father's death. To the arrangement of affairs dictated by the late king no great respect was paid by the parliament, which had risen so much in its importance since the usurpation of Henry the fourth, that neither that prince nor his successor, conscious of their ill-founded title, had ventured to impose taxes without its consent. A council was appointed to limit the duke of Bed ford's authority, who, instead of regent, was al lowed for England the title only of protector. The duke of Glocester, his younger brother, was vested with the fame office during the absence of this prince. The care of the infant king was committed to his great uncle, Henry Beaufort, bissiop of Winchester, the legitimated son of John of Gaunt, duke of Lan caster.

The duke of Bedford, a man of great abilities, regent of the French monarchy for the Englissi claimant, made every exertion, be side the efforts of arms, for the strengthening of his party. He gained the duke of Britanny to Henry's interest : he married himself to a sister of Philip, duke of Burgundy : and he liberated, on a treaty of peace, king James the first of Scotland, whom he espoused to an Englissi lady. This peace, or compact of neutrality, with Scotland, served as a prevention to the sending of more troops thence to the continent, to the aid of the French king Charles, who had been signally benefited by Scottissi auxiliars ; but to a prevention more effectual served two defeats, by which these auxiliars were almost anni hilated. The former of these happened at Crevan in Burgundy, in 1423, where at least a thousand Scots were slain, and their general with many others, taken prisoners, James Stuart, lord Darnley, who had been honoured by king Charles with the lordship of Aubigny in France. The latter, sustained in the August of 1424, at Verneuil in Normandy, was much more disastrous. By the influence of the earl of Buchan, who, for his victory at Bauge, had been raised to the high office of constable of France, earl Douglas had brought from Scotland a reinforcement of"], [774, "15* Chap, XXXII 1424 HISTORY OF THE of five thousand men, on account of which he had been created duke of Touraine. The attack of the Englissi, led by the duke of Bedford, Douglas would have awaited with cool resolution ; but the impe tuosity of his French associates, who rusted prema turely to the charge, disordered his array. Of the Scots and French near five thousand were slain, among whom fell Douglas himself and the earl of feuchan. By the slaughter of his best troops, and the rout of the rest, with the loss of many towns and territories, king Charles, who had gained only a ssiort respite, by the death of Henry the fifth, from the pressure of the Englissi arms, seemed now driven to the brink of inevitable ruin, when by the impru dence of an enemy he obtained another respite much longer and more promising. Jaqneline, countess of Hainault and Holland, a woman of uncommon understanding and spirit, had conceived such contempt and antipathy for her huf band, the duke of Brabant, a youth both feeble in body and mind, a eousingerman to the duke of Bur gundy, that ssie had retired into England to solicit the interest of the Englissi court for the procuring of a divorce by the papal authority. The duke of Glocester, vehement and impetuous, though in other respects of a laudable character, eager to possess so great a prize, married the countess, without await ing a divorce, and attempted by force of arms to wrest her inheritance from her former husband.

Thus were Englissi and Burgundian armies, instead of acting in conjunction against king Charles, engaged in hostilities against each other ; while the duke of Bri-ttanny transferred his alliance from the Englissi to the French mo narch ; and the duke of Bedford, instead of avail ing himself of his victories by a vigorous prosecu tion of the war, found himself obliged to make a visit to England to effect, if possible, a reconcilia tion between his brother and the Burgundian prince, and to compose a dissension between the former and bissiop Beaufort. Having, by authority of parliament, without the attainment of the other object, adjusted for a time his brother's difference with the bissiop, Bedford returned to France, and made, with his collected forces, such a sudden and powerful incursion into Brittanny, as obliged its duke to renew his alliance with England- By events also elsewhere the war in the Netherlands was terminated, and the Burgun dian arms again united with those of England. In consequence of a papal bull, which not only ren dered void the marriage of Jaqueline with the duke of Glocester, but also declared her incapable of marrying the Englissi prince even in case of her for mer hussiand's death, that prince married an Englissi lady, and relinquissied all further competition for her estates.

For the defence of a post so important, on which the destiny of France was believed to de pend, all precautions had been taken in fortifica tions, provisions, a numerous garrison, and able officers. By a ball from a cannon, an engine which seems to have been then first used in sieges to any consi- derable purpose, the brave Salisoury was slain, when he had stormed some of the outworks, and was succeeded by the earl of Suffolk, who, receiving large reinforcements, environed the city with a chain of redoubts, which he intended to connect, in the following spring, by trenches, to the total pre- clusion of supplies, and the conquest of Orleans by famine. On the other hand the French laid waste the country all around to distress the besiegers, who were obliged thus to bring their victuals from afar. In the attempts to throw provisions into the town, and to intercept those of the besieging army, many fkirmissies had place in which great fierceness was dis- played. Thus a convoy of two thousand soldiers under Sir John Fastolf, with above four hundred waggons loaded with supplies for the besiegers was attacked by four thousand French and Scots, who were defeated with great loss, especially of the lat ter. After this engagement, called the battle of her rings, from the lenten food escorted by the convoy king"], [777, "BRITISH ILANDS. 255 Chap XXXII Maid of Orleans. 142!? 143 1 king Charles almost despaired of relief to the be sieged, and of his ability to maintain his ground much longer in those parts. Under the influence of dejection, he had formed the design of retiring with the remnant of his forces into Languedoc and dau phine, when he was roused into the noble determi nation of defending his inheritance or perissiing in the attempt, by the remonstrances of his queen, and still more by those of his mistress, the beautiful Agnes Sorel, who threatened otherwise to seek her fortune in the Englissi court. To second the heroic spirit, excited or infused by two amiable females, a third soon came forward, a phenomenon in history, an amazon in arms, who turned in his favour the tide of war, which had been so long adverse, and which menaced him now with final submersion. Near Vaucouleurs, on the western border of Lor- raine, lived a female peasant, named Joan of Arc, about twenty-two years of age, of an unblemissied cha- racter, and hitherto unnoticed for extraordinary ta- lents, but robust and active, and who, having per- formed the office of an hostler at a low inn, had, by conducting horses to water, become expert in riding. A young and amiable prince, a favourite with the fair sex, as being much inclined to the tender pas- sion, driven from his native throne by domestic sedi- tion and foreign arms, appears to have been so in- teresting an object to the thoughts of this young woman, as to have fired her with enthusiasm in his cause, and even to have affected her fancy with the belief of her being summoned by a voice divine, and authorized by a commission from above, to achieve his"], [778, "456 Chap, XXXII. HISTORY OF THE his deliverance. Thus elevated to an intrepidity of spirit, beyond the timid feelings natural to her sex, her youth, and condition, ssie repaired to Baudri court, the governor of the above-named town, in formed him of her celestial mandates, and solicited to be sent to the royal presence. Treating her first as a visionary, but afterwards convinced of the possi ble utility of such a deception, or of the reality of her inspiration, the governor complied with her re quest. When ssie was admitted to the king at Chi non in Touraine, ssie addressed him thus, with an air of respectful freedom : \" Gentle dauphin, I am Joan the maid : the King of heaven hath sent me to your succour : if you please to grant me troops, by the grace of God and the force of arms, I will raise the siege of Orleans, and conduct you to be crowned at Rheims in spite of all your enemies. This is what the King of heaven hath commanded me to tell you.\" Of the advantages which might be reaped from a general belief, among the vulgar, of a divine com mission for the expulsion of the Englissi, the leaders of the French were not insensible. With an affected incredulity of her pretensions, the maid was for mally examined in succession by the court, an as sembly of grave theologians, and the parliament at Poictiers; and was, with an affected sincerity of conviction, pronounced by them all miraculously au thorized. She was next exhibited in arms and on horseback to the multitude, who regarded her dex terity in the management of her steed as an addi tional proof of supernatural power. The report, through"], [779, "BRITISH ILANDS. 257 Chap xxxir. through all quarters propagated with rapidity, raised high the spirits of the French, and struck the Englissi with dismay. The commanders of the besieging army at Orleans, to whom ssie sent written menaces of divine vengeance, unless they would immediately relinquissi their attempt and depart from France, affected to treat with derision her celestial agency, and assured their soldiers that ssie could not have otherwise power than from the devil : but this ap pears not to have given much encouragement, as su pernatural force, whencesoever derived, if permitted to operate, was regarded as tremendous : nor were perhaps the commanders themselves completely free from superstitious horror. The engine so fortunately offered to their service was employed to full advantage by the generals of the French, particularly the count of Dunois, who, combining with the influence of superstition the skill of military operations, took all possible precautions for the ensuring of success, and ascribed the whose merit to the maid's divine efficiency. The first ex periment was tried at the end of April, when the garrison of Orleans made a sally on one side, while on the other, the most weakly guarded by the Englissi, an army, convoying provisions for the town, ad vanced with the maid at its head, who ostentati ously displayed a consecrated standard. The opposi tion of the besiegers appears to have been feeble ; at least the attempt of the French was attended with success, and Joan was received in Orleans with tri umphant exultation. The earl of Suffolk,/ who ought to have endeavoured, by the most active em- Vol. II.

When the wants of the garrison were sully relieved, the maid cried aloud for the attack of the blockading forts, and fought with desperate courage at every assault, rallying her troops when repulsed, and leading them back against the foe, even when herself was wounded, as ssie was once behind in the neck with an arrow, which ssie extracted with her own hands. After the loss of several forts, and of six or eight thousand men in their defense, the Englissi general, seeing the danger of his situation, with dispirited troops in the pre sence of an elated enemy, abandoned the siege, and retired with great precaution on the eighth of May. Having gained this great advantage, from her ser vices in which the French heroine was denominated the Maid of Orleans, the generals of king Charles resolved to press with vigour the retreating Englissi, without allowing time for their recovery from con sternation. Suffolk was made prisoner at Gergeaux, in the storming of which the maid was beaten to the ground by a stroke of a stone on the head, yet re covered, and rendered the assault successful. Other towns were reduced, and, at the village of Pattav, six leagues from Orleans, the remnant of the Englissi army, strengthened by a reinforcement, was defeat ed with so little resistance, that Sir John Fastolf, a man until then of eminent valour, was among the foremost"], [781, "BRITISH 1I.ANDS. 259 Chap XXXII. foremost in flight, on account of which he was de prived of the garter, the badge of the highest order of Englissi knighthood. As the raising of the siege of Orleans, one part of her mission, was completely accomplissied, the maid insisted on the performance of the other, the coronation of king Charles at Rheims, where, for a peculiar purpose, the unction of French monarchs, a holy oil was preserved, which, according to fabulous tradition, had been carried by a pigeon from heaven to king Clovis, on the first establissiment of the French monarchy. The march to Rheims, through a country every where inpos session of his enemies, an enterprise apparently of excessive danger, and, before the present dismay of the Englissi, impossible, was undertaken by Charles, at the head of twelve thousand men, in the July of 1429, and accomplissied without opposition. After this coronation, a ceremony of great im portance on account of the popular prejudices in its favour, many towns revolted to Charles, and the duke of Bedford's abilities were proved far above the common standard, by his finding the means of resistance in so difficult a situation, when those French, who had hitherto been in his interest, were now awaiting the opportunity of revolt, and when from England no supplies could be obtained of any moment, and very few recruits, since those, who en gaged to serve, mostly afterwards deserted through terror of the maid.

OF THE 260 Chap XXXH clans of Bohemia, Bedford kept the field in a man ner the best calculated to revive the courage of his troops, and to impede the progress of the foe, without exposing himself on any occasion to the risk of a battle. He caused young Henry of Eng land to be crowded king of France at Paris in the December of 1431, in the vain hope of exciting more interest in his cause among the French; but he had, in the mean time, by his atrocious cruelty to the maid of Orleans, given just cause of aliena tion to the friends, of humanity among his adhe- rents. That heroine had forced her way, through the be sieging troops of Englissi and Burgundians, into the town of Compiegne, twenty-one leagues from Paris, in the May of 1430, to the great joy of the besieged, who thought themselves rendered thus invincible. On the next day ssie headed a sally, and drove the besiegers from their entrenchments in that quarter, but was afterwards overpowered by numbers, desert ed by her routed troops, and taken prisoner by the Burgundians, from whom ssie was purchased, for a sum not less in value than a hundred thousand pounds of our money, by Bedford. This merito rious female, who, together with her parents, bro thers, and sisters, had been ennobled for her ser vices by king Charles, and who after the coronation at Rheims, had in vain solicited leave to retire from the war, seems to have been neglected by the Trench when they saw her fallen into the hands of the exasperated Englissi, who attributed to her dia bolical powers their sudden and great reverse of fortune."], [783, "BRITISH ILANDS. 261 Chip XXXi I. 1431 Continua- tion of the war m France. 1432, 1443, fortune. Entitled to all the privileges of a prisoner of war, she was yet loaded with irons in a dungeon, and, after a long confinement, was tried, on an accusation of sorcery and other crimes, by a body of prelates in the Englissi interest, of whom only one was an Englissiman. Notwithstanding all exertions, in a long protracted examination against an illiterate woman unassisted by any advocate, no imputation could be fixed upon her moral character; but when to a question, \" whether ssie would submit to the church the judgment of her pretended inspira tions ?\" ssie replied that \" ssie would submit it to God, the fountain of all truth,\" ssie was pronoun ced a heretic. On her acknowledging at length that these were no other than illusory inspirations, her punissiment was mitigated into imprisonment for life on bread and water, with an interdiction against her ever again appearing in male apparel. But so implacable were her enemies, that they art fully entrapped her into a breach of this interdic tion, and caused her to be burned alive, according to her former sentence, in the market place of Rouen, in the May of 1431. The superstitious horror, which had so signally blasted the courage of the Englissi, appears to have vanissied with its object; but so exhausted and feeble was the state of the two belligerent parties, that no efficient force could be sent into the field, nor the war waged otherwise than by employing small bodies of troops, who fkirmissied, made incursions into the open country, and took towns by surprize. In this mode of warfare the advantage was quite on the"], [784, "HISTORY OF THE 262 Chap xxxii 1433 the side of Charles, to whom the people, engaged in affection, were always ready to convey intelligence, and to give assistance against the garrisons of the ene my. While the Englissi were thus continually losing ground, the death of the dutchefs of Bedford, in the November of 1432, gave commencement to a breach between her husoand, who soon after took another wife, and her brother the duke of Burgun dy, who considered himself as direspectfully treated .by this marriage, in which his consent had not been aslced. By the mediation cf friends the two dukes repaired to Saint-Omers, in the following May, for the purpose of a conference and mutual reconcilia tion ; but as neither would submit to make the first visit to the other, they returned, without any con ference, to their respective stations. The resentment of the duke of Burgundy, by which alone he had been incited, in manifest op position to the interest of himself and his family, to enter into a league with foreigners against a prince who was his native sovereign and kinsman, had been gradually subsiding by length cf time, the earnest entreaties of friends, and the apologies and conces sions of Charles himself. Disgusts received from the English encreased his propensity to an accom modation with his kindred family on the French throne. For this purpose at length, in the August of 1435, a congress was held at Arras, where the commissioners of the Englissi court were so offended at the terms proposed on the part of Charles, the ccflson of Normandy and Guienne to England un der condition of homage, that they instantly re- nounced"], [785, "BRITISH II.ANDS. 263 Chap XXXII 1436 1 113 nounced all further concern in the conference. When they had departed, the adjustment was easy between the king and the duke, as the demands of the latter were all yieldedby the former. Such rage prevailed in England on this account, that the duke's subjects in London were insulted by the populace, some of them even murdered, which, if he had not been protected by guards, would have been the fate of his herald, sent with his notification of the peace, and an apology for his conduct. As the he rald was also contumeliously treated by the court, the duke was still more disgusted, and was furnissi ed with a sufficient excuse for departing from his neutrality, and joining his arms with those of Charles against the insolent pretensions of England. From the defection of the Burgundians, the death of the duke of Bedford, and the prevention of acti vity on the part of England by dissensions in the regency, the Englissi in France were so much over powered as to be constrained to evacuate, with other towns, the city of Paris. Yet such was still the terror of the Englissi arms, that, on the sailing of a fleet with troops for the relief of Calais, besieged by the duke Burgundy, that prince, with far su perior numbers, retired with precipitation. In a war still maintained with great animosity, but little force, in which many gallant, but indecisive, actions were performed, the exhausted condition of the Englissi, and the miseries of France, subjected to the depredations of its enemies and defenders, at length induced the contending parties, after many ineffec tual negociations for peace, to settle, in 1443, the terms"], [786, "26 + HISTORY OF THE terms of a truce, which was afterwards prolonged by several renewals. For the accomplissiment of this measure the duke of Orleans made zealous exertions, a prince of the blood, who had been taken in the defeat at Azincourt, and had, after a captivity in England of twenty-five years, been libe rated for an enormous ransom ; a fad instance of the inferiority of those times to the present in the treatment given to prisoners of war.

These were the heads of two opposite factions, which had long di vided the Englissi council; the former high spirited, haughty, and of an unguarded temper; the latter artful, interested, and intriguing. This prelate, in 144 1, had availed himself of the ignorance and su perstition of the age to inflict a cruel wound on the family of his rival. He had caused his dutchess to be accused of sorcery, of having slowly melted a waxen image before a sire, for the destruction, in the like slow manner, of the king's health. As Hume observes, \" the nature of this crime, so opposite to all common sense, seems always to ex empt the accusers frcm observing the rules of com mon sense in their evidence.\" To be accused and to be guilty were therefore terms almost synonymous. The dutchess was sentenced to perform public penance at three churches, and to imprisonment during life. One of her pretended accomplices, a priest, was hanged; and another, a woman, was burned alive. Ditf.n'ions i.i England. 1441. 1 .43. To"], [787, "205 Chap XXXII 141-4 1447 BRITISH ILANDS. To secure the superiority of his influence in the government, the cardinal formed a project of pro curing for his master, now grown to man's estate, but of a feeble mind, a queen, who ssiould be fit ted by her talents to govern her husoand, and who, indebted for her elevation entirely to this prelate, might always act according to instructions from him. He selected on this occasion a princess high ly accomplissied in mind and body, of a masculine courageous, and enterprising spirit, of solid judge ment and vivacity of temper. This was fVargaret, daughter of Reni of Anjou, who bore the titles of king of Sicily, Naples and Jerusalem, but was des titute of power or territorial possessions. Not only ssie had no fortune, but for her purchase, as it were, from France, a private stipulation was made, in the matrimonial compact, for the surrendry of the province of Maine, then in the hands of the Eng lissi, to Charles of Anjou, her uncle, the premier minister of the French monarch.

Charles, the French monarch, demanded compensa tion for the injury of his vassal, and estimated the damages at an enormous sum. The answer, though true, \" that these troops were under no control of any authority in England,\" was not admit- ted as satisfactory by Charles, who having availed himself of the truce to recover his kingdom from its state of debility, was now resolved to avail himself of the distractions of a rival kingdom, for the recovery of his provinces from foreign dominion. Though the time of truce was far as yet from having expired, Normandy was invaded, in the July and August of 1449, by four separate armies of French, who met little resistance, as from the Eng- lish troops, ill paid and few, no force could be collected to oppose the enemy in the field, the for- tresses were in bad condition, the garrisons small and disorderly, and the inhabitants every where so disaffected, as to be ready to assist in the expulsion of the garrisons.

Re mote from foreign aid, and otherwise quite unable to oppose the great army of the count of Dunois, the nobles and people, after some weak attempts, resolved to submit; Bourdeaux capitulated; and with the surrendry of Bayonne, in the August of 1 45 1, the expulsion of the English from all France, except Calais, was triumphantly completed. Thns was a second time demonstrated the egregious folly of the Englissi nation in their schemes of conquest in France, in which could be only purchased an un substantial and transient glory, by such a waste of blood and treasure, as to have caused some men of eminence hyperbolically to asserr, that in the war between France and England more men had been lost than, at the commencement of the truce, remained alive in both kingdoms. While the French in Normandy were in the ca reer of conquest, discontent in England arose to an alarming height against the party of the queen, to whose intrigues were imputed the loss of the French territories.

An insurrection in Kent, which was soon suppressed, was headed by Thomas Thany, a fuller, nicknamed Bluebeard. Oppressions, which naturally arose from the exhausted and disordered state of the public revenue, were, with all other national grievances, charged on Suffolk, an object of popular hatred from his supposed participation in the death of Glo cester. Impeached by the commons, and despair ing of an acquittal under such a load of odium, he attempted by an expedient to elude his prosecutors. In presence of all the lords of parliament, who bad been summoned for this purpose into the king's apartment, he was asked what he had to say in his defense; and, on his denial of the charge, with yet submission to the royal mercy, he was pronounced banissied by the king for five years.

Having advanced to Black-heath, and transmitted to the king and council his complaints and requests, Cade re tired to Sevenoaks, on the approach of troops against him. Having at this place routed these troops, and slain their commander, he again took post at Black-heath, renewed his petition, and, while the king was carried for safety to Kenilworth, entered London without resistance, as the reasonable nature of his demands, and the regularity of conduct which he maintained among his followers, had pre possessed the citizens in his favour. But he found himself unable to retain much longer this multitude in good order. Lord Say, the late Treasurer, and Cromer, high ssieriff of Kent, were beheaded with out legal formality: acts of riot and plunder were committed: the citizens took arms: the rebels, quartered in Southwark, were repulsed with slaugh ter in attempting to regain admittance into the city: a pardon to all, who ssiould immediately re turn home, was proclaimed: the rebels dispersed: Cade, thus abandoned, fled alone in disguise: a reward was proclaimed for his head: he was slain in Sussex by Alexander Eden, a gentleman of Kent; and many of his followers, notwithstanding the pardon promised them under the great seal, were capitally punissied.

The line male of the Mortimers was now extinct, but their title rested in Richard duke of York, to whom it was transmit- ted by his mother, the lady Anne, sister of the last earl of March, who was descended from Philippa, the only daughter of Lionel duke bf Clarence, the second son of Edward the third. Duke Richard stood thus clearly in the order of succession be- fore the reigning monarch, Henry the sixth, who derived his descent from John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, the third son of the same Edward. Rich- ard had held, with much honour, the command of the Englissi in France, for some years before the truce with that kingdom ; and had since been ap- pointed to a like post in Ireland, where he had'firm- ly establissied by his conduct a general attachment to his person and family. When the scepter was placed in a feeble hand, the right of the duke was very formidable, as he was a man of prudence and ability, of a most extensive property in land, and of powerful connexions. From the jealousy entertained against him by the court, augmented by the cir- cumstances of Cade's insurrection, orders were issued, when his intention of returning from Ireland was known, to oppose his debarcation on the Eng- lissi coasts, as he was suspected of a design of bring- ing with him an army for the enforcement of his claim.

He therefore instruct ed his friends to argue in all companies in fa vour of his title, that the public mind might be prepared for an appeal to arms. Affairs were not, however, for a considerable time, carried to extremity, as the duke was sensible, that a sudden violation of the establissiment would be dangerous, at a period when the influence of the commons and the laws had acquired a stability ; and as the court was unable to crussi this pretender by a decisive blow, on account of the excessive weakness of the king.

He was of a tame and inoffen sive spirit, little affected by the vicissitudes of for tune, temperate in his course of life, and supersti tiously devout. He was well qualified for the con dition of a monk by these virtues, together with his intellectual weakness and total want of energy, which rendered him a merely passive instrument in the hands of whatever persons happened to surround him.

Finding himself precluded from admission into the metropolis, he proceeded into Kent, and was followed by an army under the king, who encamped on Blackheath. Terms were proposed, and an agreement made, that Somerset, who was accordingly in appearance arrested, ssiould be re moved from the royal presence, and stand a trial in parliament ; and that Richard ssiould disoand his forces, and pay his respects in person to Henry. Richard performed his part of the treaty, but was astonissied, when he had entered the royal tent, by the presence of Somerset, who stepped from behind a curtain, and declared his readiness to justify his conduct. Though York was thus en snared into the power of his enemies, they were deterred by the situation of affairs from proceeding to violence. He was therefore permitted, under solemn promises of pacific behaviour, to retire to his castle of Wigmore in Herefordssiire. Though baffled for the present, this nobleman found afterwards a more favourable opportunity of gaining possession of the sovereign power.

When, in this disposition of the public mind, the king fell into a lingering distemper, which rendered him unable to assist his party by exhibiting any appearance whatsoever of a perfor- mance of the regal function, duke Richard, emerg- ing from his retirement, repaired to the capital, accompanied by his powerful friends with their numerous attendants. Yielding to the present ne- cessity, the queen and council committed Somerset to the tower, and authorized Richard, as lieutenant of the kingdom, to hold a parliament, by which, when the state of the country was taken into consideration, he was vested with the temporary exercise of sovereignty, under the title of protec tor. Of the duke's moderation, who neglected this favourable opportunity of gaining actual possession of the throne, his enemies took advantage. When Henry was so far recovered that he could appear to act as a king, Somerset was released, York's pro tectorssiip annulled, and other measures taken ominous to that prince.

Somer set and other nobles were slain, and the king taken prisoner, but treated with respect and kindness. This battle fought on the twenty-third of May, in the year 1455, was the commencement of a long contest, fierce and bloody in the extreme, between the two factions attached to the families of York and Lancaster, called the war of the roses, because those flowers were carried, as marks of distinction, by the two parties, a red by the Lancastrians, a white by the Yorkists. The chiefs and their adherents were not as yet inflamed to that pitch of atrocious acrimony, with which the war was afterwards pro secuted. The parliament decreed a general indem nity to the Yorkists, and the restoration of the protectorssiip to Prichard until the king's eldest son ssiould have passed his minority, or until the com mission ssiould have been revoked by royal authority with the consent of the lords of parliament. In the house of lords, among whom ssie had pre viously intrigued for the purpose, the active queen Margaret caused her husoand to appear, to declare himself sufficiently recovered for the exercise of royalty, and to demand their consent for the revoca tion of the protectorssiip.

Informed of a snare for their destruction, when, in compliance with the royal invitation, they were approaching this town, these nobles fled pre cipitately to different places of strength. In the dubious calm which ensued, some patriotic or paci fic lords, anxious to prevent the horrours cf intestine war, laboured, with apparent success, for the mutual conciliation of the chiefs of the two factions. These chiefs, with numerous trains for their security, took station in the capital, each faction apart, while the mayor, at the head of five thousand men, kept in cessant guard for the safety of both. In this posture an accommodation was formed, unsound, but seeming ly so cordial, that, in a solemn procession to Saint- Paul'8, the duke of York led the queen by the hand, while each lord in one party walked arm in arm with one of the opposite. In less than six months after this the earl of Warwick, on whose attendants a bloody assault was made by those of the king in London, whither he had been summoned on public business, imagined a plot for his destruction, and, effecting his escape, alarmed his associates, who now again prepared for war. The earl of Salisoury, marching with five thou sand men to join duke Richard in Wales, was inter cepted by a Lancastrian army, twice as numerous, under lord Audley, at Bloreheath, on the eastern borders of Shropssiire, on the twenty-second of Sep tember. Having at first feigned a flight, the York ists wheeled suddenly on the foe, and, attacking them when a part had, in a disorderly pursuit, passed the steep"], [799, "877 Chap XXXIK 1460 BRITISH ILANDS. steep banks of 3 rivulet, they put them to rout, and flew their commander. At Ludlow the victorious troops effected a junction with those of Richard; but on the thirteenth of the succeeding month, Sir Andrew Trollop deserted in the night, with the ve terans from Calais under his command, to king Henry, who had advanced with a great force to meet his opponents. The duke and his principal friends, in consternation at an example of treachery, which many others might be ready to imitate, dis persed their followers, and took refuge in different places. The Yorkists, who seemed thus irretrievably ruined, became suddenly predominant. Rigorous measures of judicial prosecution, against all who had appeared in hostile array against the king, spread such , alarms among the people, particularly those of Kent, who were most obnoxious, that deputies were sent to the refugee lords with earnest entreaties for their return. The earls' of March and Warwick, arriving at Sandwich from Calais with fifteen hun dred men, were joined by such numbers, that they soon entered London at the head of forty thousand. Hence they proceeded, with twenty-five thousand, to oppose the Lancastrian forces, which, commanded by the queen, were hastening from Coventry. The two armies met in battle near Northampton, on the tenth of July. The decision in favour of the York ists is ascribed to the desertion of lord Grey of Ruthin to their side, with his troops, in the heat of the conflict. In the battle and pursuit, in which no quarter was given to nobles or gentry, ten thousand of the discomfited are said to have been slain. The king"], [800, "273 Chap XXXIII 1460 HISTORY OF THE king remained a prisoner ; but the queen, with her son, escaped into Scotland. Duke Richard, having returned from Ireland, on the receipt of this intelligence, appeared in par liament; and, stating his grounds of claim to the throne, departed, leaving the determination of the affair to that assembly. After a formal debate, the two houses decreed, that Henry ssiould retain the crown for life, but ssiould be succeeded at his death by Richard, who ssiould meanwhile exercise the ad ministration of government. But Margaret, having collected the fugitives of her party, returned from Scotland, prevailed, by her address, on the Englissi barons in the north to espouse her cause, and assem bled an army of twenty thousand, with which ssie advanced toward the south. Richard, with five thousand, marched northward against her ; but when, on his arrival at-Wakefield in Yorkssiire, her forces were unexpectedly found to be so prodigious- ly superior, he took ssielter in the castle of Sandal. For reasons not well known, he afterwards relin quissied the advantage of this fortress, and descended to battle in the plain. Surrounded and overpower-. ed, his troops were defeated with the slaughter of near three thousand. His body was found among the slain ; his head was severed, and with a crown of paper on it, in derision, was placed on the walls of York.

Altering his direction, he en countered these troops at Mortimer's cross near Here ford, on the second of February, and defeated them with great slaughter. Margaret, notwithstanding \u25a0the news of this disaster, proceeded toward London, She was opposed at Saint-Albans by the earl -of War wick, who suffered a bloody discomfiture by the desertion of lord -Lovelace. The king, who had been carried on this occasion with the army of the Yorkists, but had always been treated with respect and tenderness, was, in consequence of her victory, recovered by the queen. Lord Bonville, to whose care he h.d been consigned, remained with him in his tent after the battle, in compliance with his ear nest entreaty, and on the pledge of his royal word for the safety of his person. Yet this nobleman was instantly beheaded. This violation of the royal promise is said to have been perpetrated by the com mand of Margaret, to whose account many acts of cruelty, with what justice I cannot judge, are char ged by historians. She was at this time, however, evidently unable to restrain her troops, composed in great part of Scottissi and Englissi borderers, from continuing those ravages and devastations which they had constantly committed in their march.

Reinforced by the fugitive troops of Warwick, young Edward had advanced with eagerness to give battle to the queen. On intelligence of her retreat, he entered London amid the joyful acclamations of the people ; and, adopting a bolder and more deci sive line of conduct than his father, resolved without delay to assume the regal authority, and to have his title recognised as the rightful monarch. By a pro miscuous multitude, assembled on the occasion in Saint-John's fields, to whom a speech was pronoun ced in favour of his right, and questions pro posed, \" whether they would have Henry or Edward for their king?\" the former was rejected, and the latter, with ssiouts of approbation, accepted.

On the defeat of an advanced party of the Yorkists detached to secure the pass of Ferrybridge over the river Aire, dismay began to pervade the new mo narch's host, whose number is stated at only forty thousand. To counteract an impression, which might be attended with the most disastrous effects, the earl of Warwick, having stabbed his horse in the pre sence of the troops, kissed the cross on the hilt of his sword, and took a solemn oath that he would ssiare the fortune of the meanest sentinel ; while pro clamation was made by Edward's command, that all, who were unwilling to fight, might now retire ; that the brave, who would act well in the ensuing tattle, ssiould be rewarded \\ but that vengeance ssiould be inflicted on any, who, having now con sented to remain, ssiould afterwards betray any symp toms of cowardice.

The Lancastrian archers, when they felt these missiles, imagined the enemy within reach of theirs, and poured volleys in vain. When their quivers were exhausted, all the bowmen of the Yorkists moved forward, and made havoc unrevenged, until the two armies closed in the soock of conflict. After a des perately obstinate struggle from morning till night, the Lancastrians gave ground, still sighting as they retired, and at length were driven into total rout. Since the battle of Wakesield no quarter had been given to nobles on either side, and by the orders of Edward, no quarter was now given to men of any rank. Above thirty-six thousand appear to have been slaughtered in the battle and pursuit. The queen, who, committing the command of her army to the young duke of Somerset, had remained at York during the engagement, fled with her husoand and son, on hearing of the defeat, into Scotland, to whose government, for the conciliation of its fa vour, ssie surrendered the important fortress of Ber wick. The title of young Edward was confirmed by the event of this most bloody combat, the last of four pitched battles, fought, in a space of less than three months, between the two Englissi factions, in all which four not less than sixty thousand are computed to have fallen. Executions succeeded by martial law : the ceremony of coronation was performed \u25a0 and a parliament was convened, whose upper-house, from the death and exile of so many nobles, was excessively"], [805, "BRITISH ILANDS. 283 excessively thin. While by the new monarch this Chap. obsequious instrument was employed for the reward- XXXIII. ing of his friends by the forfeited estates of his op ponets, queen Margaret, who betrothed her son to the sister of the king of Scotland, was labouring to engage that kingdom in her quarrel ; but she failed of other than partial success, from the distracted state of Scottissi affairs, and the negociations of her enenly. Eager to acquire additional assistance, this indefatigable heroine sailed from Kircudbright to Brittanny, from whose duke ssie obtained twelve thousand crowns ; and ssie proceeded thence to Chi- non, to the court of the French king. The government of France, of whose internal 1462. discord the English had taken so baneful an advan tage, might have retaliated on these enemies in their state of weakness, if its attention had not been en gaged in healing wounds at home. No invasion had been attempted, nor other than desultory attacks on the coast. Thus, in the August of 1457, the town of Sandwich had been burned by one armament, and some villages in Cornwall by another. On the pro mise of sVargaret to restore Calais to the French, whenever ssie ssiould have re-establissied her husoand on his throne, Lewis the eleventh, who hael succeed ed Charles the seventh, his father, in 1460, fur nished her with a sum of money, and permitted Breze, the high steward of Normandy, to accom pany her with a force of two thousand men.

Convinced of the des perate situation of her affairs, ssie returned to the continent in the April of 1463, and passed, with her son, through Flanders, to the court of her father in Anjou, where ssie seems to have remained. Resolving rather to make another effort, than wholly to abandon themselves to despair, the duke of Somerset and other exiles, collecting all the troops which they could draw to their standard, and putting the dethroned king Henry at their head, invaded Northumberland in the April of the following year, with an army of Scots and Englissi. An advanced detachment of these troops was defeated, at Hedgely moor, by John Nevil, lord Montacute, who was there- by encouraged, without awaiting reinforcements, to attack the main body in their intrenchmenis at Hex- ham. Here this leader, on the fifteenth of May, gave the Lancastrians a bloody and decisive over- throw. That Margaret was then in France is highly probable, though some of our historians, fond of the marvellous, have copied from a French writer a strange story of her wandering in a forest in the north of England after this battle. The history of this period is remarkably obscure, and the last at tempts of this queen and her partizans, in the nor thern countries, have been misunderstood and mistated from imperfect annals, as may be seen in the seventh book of Pinkerton's History of Scotland under the line"], [807, "BRITISH ILANDS. 285 Chap, XXXIII.

King Henry effected his escape into the Scottissi dominions ; but doubtful of his safety there, he fled thence into Lancassiire, where, after a concealment during twelve months, he was disco vered by his enemies, who conducted him to Lon don, and lodged him as a prisoner in the tower. Edward appeared now unssiakeably settled on his throne. He had scarcely entered his twentieth year at the time when he assumed the regal style, beauti ful in his person, and possessed of all those qualities which render a monarch popular ; affable, of a graceful and winning address, brave to intrepidity, and in the hour of danger energetic ; but in peace abandoned to pleasure, and, as Hume observes, \" less fitted to prevent ills by wise precautions, than to remedy them, after they took place, by his vi gour and enterprise ;\" of boundless incontinence ; and, partly from nature, partly from his being habi tuated to the relentless rage of party, so unfeelingly cruel, that he was sometimes engaged at once in the double employment of beholding the executions of Lancastrian gentlemen, and making his tender ad dresses to a lady. Notwithstanding the cruel heart and libertine life of this monarch, he was so powerfully captivated by the charms of a virtuous female, as to yield a great sacrifice for the attainment cf her person.

Enamoured at once, 4he king soon be came a suppliant in his turn, for favours which ssie, perhaps from ambitious hopes, inflexibly re fused. His passion, which was every day augmented, became at length so ungovernable, that, as the only alternative for its gratification, he resolved to raise her to the throne. His marriage, privately solem nized in the May of 1463, was kept secret till the September of the following year? when thinking himself secure, after the overthrow of his opponents, he caused her to be conducted to the church of Reading, and publicly declared his queen. The marriage of a subject with a sovereign, who stood in need of fortifying his title by a matrimonial alliance with a foreign court, was followed by im mediate consequences productive of jealousies and dis affection. The Woodvilles, the queen's relatives, en grossed the royal favour, and were promoted to the greatest honours and estates. This gave no small umbrage to several nobles, who were sensible of their own services in the Yorkist cause, particularly the Nevil family, whose head was the earl of War wick, the principal instrument of Edward's elevation. These jealousies, however, produced not for some years any violent commotion, and the king seemed se cure from enemies both domestic and foreign, hav ing made a truce with Scotland in 1464, another with"], [809, "2S1 Chap.

But from un abated discontents a confederacy was formed against the Woodvilles, into which the king's second bro ther, George duke of Clarence was drawn by a com munity of dissatisfaction, and by his marriage with Warwick's daughter, coheiress of her father's vast estates. The settlement, thus acquired by Clarence, was greater than any which the monarch himself could confer upon him, as the possessions of this earl, the last and greatest of those mighty barons who overawed the crown, were such,\" that \" not less than thirty thousand people are said to have lived daily at his board in the different manors and castles which he held in England.\" The league was rendered formidable not only by the property, but also by the character of Warwick, who was bold in his resolves, brave in the field, and so popular by his affability, generosity, and magnificence, as to command a powerful influence among the subjects of the crown. In this dim portion of Englissi annals, amid the contradictions of historians to one another and to public records of indubitable authenticity, I can pretend to nothing further than the statement of plain facts, without accounting, with nicety, for their causes or circumstances.

Par tially defeated by the earl of Warwick's brother, John Nevil, lord Montacute, who captured and slew their leader, a man of low rank, they remained yet undispersed, and soon found commanders more respectable, Sir John Coniers, and Sir Henry Nevil, who directed their march boldly to the south. On account of a dispute about quarters, between the earls of Pembroke and Devonssiire, who had ad vanced against the insurgents, the latter retired with his part of the troops. Pembroke, with the rest, composed mostly of Welch, was attacked near Ban bury by the rebels, whose vanguard was repulsed, and its leader, Sir Henry Nevil, taken prisoner and executed. Rendered more furious by this act, the northern army russied on the royalists, put them to rout with terrible slaughter, and took Pembroke pri soner, together with his brother and several other gentlemen, all of whom they beheaded in the field. They afterwards by a detachment, seized the queen's father, who had been created earl of Rivers, and her brother, Sir John Woodville, and executed them in like manner on a scaffold at Northampton. Edward, for his desertion, caused the earl of Devon ssiire to be put to death ; and soon after, notwith standing their bloody outrage on the queen's family, he quieted the insurgents by a general pardon, from the 'advice, as is said, of Warwick, who had come from his government of Calais, with his son- in-law"], [811, "2.9 Chap XXXIII. 1270: 1470, BRITISH ILANDS. in-law Clarence, to make an offer of his assistance to his sovereign. After, in appearance, a perfect harmony between the king and these two lords at this time, we find him in the November of the fame year, 1469, ordering a levy of troops to oppose a conspiracy, with which he charged them, against his crown. Yet we discover no war in consequence, but a reconciliation seemingly complete, and new honours conferred on the family of Nfvil. A royal commission to Warwick and Clarence was issued in the march of 1470, authorizing them to raise troops for the reinforcement of an army, which the king was assembling against a new body of insurgents who had taken arms in Lincolnssiire. Of the cause of this insurrection nothing certain, or even very probable, can be said. At its head was Sir Robert Welles, whose father, lord Welles, through dread of being suspected, fled into a sanctuary. Drawn thence by Edward, under a solemn promise of safety, he sent orders to his son to disoand his followers, and, on the non-compliance of the latter, was perfi diously beheaded by the royal command. The fame fate soon after attended Sir Robert, who, joining battle with the king at Stamford, was overthrown and taken prisoner. Edward is said, previously to the commencement of his march on this occasion, to have privately fled from the house of the archbissiop of York, a brother of Warwick, through dread of a plot for the seizure of his person, in a visit to that prelate.

Disconcerted by the unexpected suppres sion of these revolters, declared by proclamation re bels, and disappointed of assistance in every quarter, while the king was advancing with rapidity against them, they found themselves under the necessity of seeking refuge abroad, and therefore set fail with a small fleet from Dartmouth to Calais, of which Warwick was governor. Here Vaucler, the deputy of Warwick, inflexibly refused to suffer any of their party to go on ssiore, even the dutchess of Clarence, who had been delivered of a son on ssiipboard, and was extremely indisposed ; but he at the same time assured his master, that, by this apparent hostility, rendered necessary by circumstances, he only veiled his intention of serving him effectually as soon as ever an opportunity ssiould occur. Affecting to ad mit the truth of his apology, Warwick, making prize of some Flemissi vessels, directed his course to the Norman coast, and landed at Honfleur. Warwick, between whom and the Lancastrian party, natural hatred had been ssiarpened to the ut most pitch by the crudest injuries mutually inflict ed, had not, in taking arms, formed any designs in favour of the dethroned king Henry, but had hoped to prevail by the sole strength of his own adherents, and"], [813, "BRITISH ILANDS, 291 Chap XXXIII. 1470. and may perhaps- have intended to raise Clarence to the throne. But in his present situation he was soon persuaded by the French monarch to enter into a league with queen Margaret, which was immediately cemented by the marriage of his second daughter with prince Edward, the son of Margaret and king Henry. The chief articles were, that Henry ssiould be restored ; that the administration of the govern ment ssiould be committed to Warwick and Clarence jointly during the minority of prince Edward ; and that, if this prince ssiould leave no male issue, the crown ssiould descend to Clarence or his heirs, to the total exclusion of king Edward and his posterity. To detach his brother from a confederacy so discor dantly composed, the Englissi monarch employed a lady of great art and address, who represented in such terms to the duke the danger of his present conduct, that he secretly engaged to betray his associates on the first favourable opportunity. A like promise of treachery was, on the other side, made to Warwick, by his brother lord Montacute or Montague, who feigned strict fidelity to the present sovereign. Duke Charles of Burgundy, the ally of England, sent a fleet to guard the channel against Warwick's invasion, and exhorted king Edward to prepare with all diligence on land for the reception of the foe. While the Englissi monarch neglected this advice, with such confidence in his own strength, that he declared a most earnest wissi for the landing of this enemy, the Flemissi navy was dispersed by a storm, and Warwick, with money, and a few troops, fur- U ? nissied"], [814, "HISTORY OF THE 292 Chap XXXIII Restoration of Edward. 147 1 nissied by France, debarked at Dartmouth in the September of 1470. Employed in the north, in the quelling of some commotion, of which we have no satisfactory account, Edward, on the news of this, hasted southward, with alacrity, to meet his oppo nent, whose force was so rapidly augmented, as in a few days to consist of sixty thousand men. Near Nottingham, the place appointed for the assembling of the royal forces, he learned that those, who were led by lord Montacute, had raised the Lancastrian cry of war, and declared for king Henry. Alarmed at this defection, and assured by lord Stanley, that he was surrounded by secret foes, and could have no safety but in flight, he instantly withdrew, and rode in full speed to Lynne in Norfolk, where he em barked his small retinue in three vessels, and made fail for the Netherlands. Pursued by some (hips of the Hansetowns, a confederation of mercantile ci ties, mostly situate in Germany, then engaged in hostility with England, he with difficulty escaped to Alcmaer in Holland, where, destitute of money, he could not otherwise reward the naval captain, his preserver, than with a robe lined with skins of sables, and with promises of more effective gratitude in case of future good fortune. While Warwick, who, without a blow, had be come master of the kingdom in the space of eleven days, was employed in measures for the complete re establissiment of king Henry on the throne, the duke of Burgundy was much perplexed between the ssiame \u25a0of entirely abandoning his royal brother-in-law, who had"], [815, "BRITISH ILANDS. 293 Chap XXXIII 1471 had taken refuge in his dominions, and the danger of provoking the present English regency to join in a league with France for his destruction. His fear so predominated as to influence him to fay, that his connexions were with the kingdom of England, not its king, and that whether its monarch ssiould bear the name of Edward or Henry was to him indiffer ent. But when he found that Warwick, too hastily regarding him as a determined enemy, had sent troops to Calais to attack his territories in the Ne therlands, he concluded that his safety depended on Edward's restoration. He therefore furnissied him privately with (hips, troops, and money ; yet pub licly refused to give him any assistance, that, in case of failure, a decent pretence might still be left to the Lancastrian party, if so disposed, to adjust affairs with him in an amicable manner. Having landed, with two thousand men, at Ra venspur in Yorkssiire in the March of 1471, king Edward, finding himself opposed by the magistrates, took a solemn oath, in the cathedral of York, that he would not advance any claim to the crown, and that he had come for no other purpose than to gain possession of his patrimonial estates. When he had thus obtained permission to proceed unmolested, and was joined by such numbers of Yorkists as formed a respectable army, he resumed the regal style, and directed his march to London. By what motives lord Montacute, who commanded a large force in the northern quarter, was prevented from intercept ing him on this occasion, we cannot pretend to dis- cover."], [816, "HISTORY OF THE 294 Chap XXXIII. 1471 cover. Having reached the metropolis, where a repulse would have ruined him, Edward procured admission by a concurrence of different causes; the zeal of his partizans, who, in the number of two thousand, russied from the sanctuaries in which they had taken refuge ; the influence of his creditors, who, without his restoration, must lose every pros pect of payment ; the persuasive efforts of the ladies, with whom this gallant young monarch was a fa vourite ; and the treachery, or timid policy, of the archbissiop of York, to whose care Warwick, his brother, had entrusted the capital, and the custody of king Henry's person, who was now a second time committed to the tower. Having collected at Leicester a formidable force, with design to proceed northward against the hostile army, Warwick, on the news of its having passed toward London by an unsuspected road, took his course to the same point, in the expectation of an attack with advantage on the foe, whom he hoped to find excluded from the walls of the city. But he was now deserted by twelve thousand men under Clarence, who had found not before an opportunity of defec tion, in the design of which he had persevered, not withstanding that he had been by his father-in-law treated with strict fidelity and great kindness. Thus weakened, and finding London in the hands of his foe, Warwick yet persisted in his purpose to give battle, without awaiting the arrival of queen Mar garet, who would have drawn to his banners a pow erful reinforcement of all the genuine Lancastrians. He"], [817, "205 Chap XXX11I. 1471 BRITISH ILAXDS. He is even supposed to have hasted to a decision, for the sake of preventing his ancient enemies from hav ing any ssiare in an action, the chief merit of which, in case of success, they might afterwards claim. As Edward, on the other side, eager, from better reasons, to come quickly to an engagement, advanced against him from London, the two armies met at Barnet, near that city, on Easter sonday, the fourteenth of April. As no quarter was expected by the soldiers of either host, the combat was maintained with des perate fury, and, notwithstanding the great inferio rity of Warwick's number, which i\u00a7 stated at only nine thousand, continued fluctuating and doubtful till the balance was turned by a fatal error. A body of Lancastrians under the earl of Oxford, having re pulsed, and driven some way before them, some troops of the enemy, were, in their return to their station in the line, mistaken for Yorkists by their associates, and so furiously assailed, that, believing themselves betrayed, they fled with rirecipitation. The cause of this accident was, that a star with rays, the cognizance marked, before and behind, on the coats of Oxford's men, was, from the refraction of the hazy air, mistaken for a fun, the mark of dis tinction on the soldiers of Edward. Warwick, in his exertions to restore the fight, was slain, and his brother, lord Montacute, in attempting to relieve him. Edward's victory was complete, and the slaugh ter horrible. The death of Richard Nevil, earl of Warwick, called from his former success the king maker, was fatal to the views of Margaret, who, after a long de- tention"], [818, "29(5 Chap XXXIIt HISTORY OF THE tention in France by adverse weather, landed at Weimouth, with prince Edward, her son, on the very day of this battle. Astounded at the news, ssie threw herself into a sanctuary in despair ; but afterwards encouraged by the appearance of some Lancastrian nobles, ssie resolved to try once more the fortune of arms. She directed her march toward Wales, to form a junction with forces levied there for her service ; but ssie was prevented by the dili gence of king Edward, who overtook her at Tewks bury on the Severn, attacked her troops in their in trenchments on the fourth of May, defeated them with the slaughter of three thousand, and took her self and her son prisoners. When this brave prince now eighteen years of age, was conducted to king Edward, and to the question, \" why he had dared to invade his dominions,\" answered that he had come to claim his just inheritance, he was struck on the face by the cruel monarch, and immediately dis patched by his attendants. The queen was con signed an afflicted prisoner to the tower, where king Henry, her husoand, expired a few days after, by what species of death is unknown, as his body was exposed without marks of violence. The possession of the crown to Edward was finally secured by his fortune in this engagement, the last of twelve battles, sought in the war of the roses, which had now con sumed above sixty princes of the royal blood, and more than half of the nobles and principal gentry of England, together with above a hundred thou sand of th\u00ab common people.

Beside the grants of parliament on this oc casion, money was levied by what was called a bene volence, a mode of exaction almost unprecedented, except in Richard the second's reign, by which, un der the name of voluntary gifts to the crown, sums were procured severally from the subjects, more through fear than inclination. Having landed at Calais, in the July of 1475, w't'1 perhaps as fine an army as had ever sailed from England, Edward sent a herald to demand the crown of France, and to defy king Lewis on his expected refusal. But, be side the failure of promised assistance from other French lords, who perhaps awaited an opportunity more favourable for defection, he was disappointed of the stipulated junction of the Burgundian forces, which the duke, pursuing schemes of wild ambition, had elsewhere employed against other foes. Digust ed by this conduct, and convinced that the troops of Charles could not now arrive soon enough for any enterprise of moment before the following year, he began to lend an ear to proposals of pacification most artfully made to him by the politic Lewis. The"], [820, "29 S Chap, XXXIII. HISTORY OF THE The situation of this monarch, amid secret and declared enemies, had been such, that his ruin seem ed not otherwise evitable than by the folly of his ad versaries, and his own dexterity in taking advantage of their errors. He caressed and bribed the herald who brought him the defiance, returned a temperate and respectful answer, and engaged the chief minis. ters of Edward's court in his interest by pensions to the amount of sixteen thousand crowns. By this management the terms were soon settled. He agreed to pay the king of England seventy-five thousand crowns immediately, on condition of his withdraw ing all his troops from the French territories, and fifty thousand every year during their joint lives, and to covenant that the dauphin, the heir of the French crown, ssiould, on the expiration of his minority, be married to the princess Elizabeth, the eldest daugh ter of Edward. He also paid fifty thousand crowns as a ransom for queen Margaret, who resided after wards in France till her death in 1482. The two monarchs met in private conference, on the bridge of Pequini, on opposite sides of a partition of close rails, and gave their solemn oaths for the observance of their treaty. To ingratiate himself with the king of England, Lewis expressed an affected wissi to see him on a visit among the ladies in Paris, where a confessor ssiould be assigned uncommonly indulgent to the flights of gallantry ; but he was afterwards obliged to contrive excuses, when he found Edward inclined to accept the invitation.

This brought such a con course, that not less than nine thousand of these were at once in that city, who might, if they had formed so base a design, have seized the person of Lewis : but he was careful not to betray any sign of suspicion against them, or of ridicule, though he felt it, at the facility with which he had duped their sovereign. When he was requested by Edward to order the gates to be ssiut for the prevention of this resort, he replied, that \" he would never consent to the exclusion of the Englissi from the place where he resided.\" Edward, who returned to England with all his forces in the September of 1475, was permitted, by the cessation of war, to follow an uninterrupted course of indulgence in festivity, which, however, proved not of such lenient kind as to prevent his commission of some cruel acts. The resentment ex cited by the league of Clarence with Warwick seems not to have been obliterated by his posterior treache ry, ruinous to the earl ; and the Woodvilles, the royal favourites, appear to have been active to awaken the suspicions, and to inflame the anger, of the king. The duke was in consequence irritated by affronts. Having become a bachelor by the death of his dutchess, he made proposals of marriage to Mary of Burgundy, the daughter of the deceased Charles, and sole heiress of his great and rich dominions. To obtain the alliance of England against the arms of France, which threatened the conquest of these dominions, the Burgundian regency would have ac- cepted"], [822, "300 HISTORY OF THE Chap, XXXIII, 1478 cepted his proposals ; but Edward refused, and, in stead of his brother, proposed Anthony Woodville, earl Rivers, the queen's brother, who was rejected with disdain. The discontent of Clarence was raised to a still higher pitch by the most unjust and barbar ous execution of two of his friends. John Stacey, a clergyman, imagined by the vulgar, from his ac quaintance with mathematics, to be a necromancer, was, on this pretence, tortured and put to death ; and Thomas Burdet of Arrow, in Warwickssiire, was beheaded, as a traitor, for an angry expression. This gentleman, when Edward, hunting in his park, had killed a white buck, his favourite, wissied the horns of the animal were in the belly of the person who had advised the king to put such an insult on him. Not only a judge and jury to condemn the friends of Clarence, but also a parliament to condemn him self, were found servile instruments by his royal bro ther. He was accused, before the lords, by the king in person, merely of speeches deemed disloyal, such as his asserting that his friends were innocent, after sentence pronounced against them in courts of jus tice, in which they had been prosecuted by order of the sovereign. He was found guilty by the peers, and his execution was demanded by the commons, who also passed against him a bill of attainder. He was put privately to death in the tower, but in what manner we are not informed with indubitable au thenticity. He is reported by Fabian to have been drowned in a butt of wine called Malmsey.

BRITISH ILANDS. his cruel injustice, as some writers fay, he appears not to have enjoyed in his last years much happiness. Anxious in a high degree to obtain splendid matches for his children, this monarch contrived to affiance, in tender years, all his daughters to the heirs of sovereign princes, by treaties of marriage, of which none took effect. Of the contract between the dauphin and princess Elizabeth, the most highly prized of all his matrimonial projects, the breach, to his great mortification, had place before his death. Lewis, who had soothed him with a pension, stipulated for life at first, but afterwards for a hundred years further, and had amused him with treaties and pro mises, which he had never intended to observe any longer than his own convenience ssiould require, was at length, by his evasions, found to be deceptious by Edward, who began too late to make warlike preparations, and entered into an alliance against France with Mary, dutchess of Bungundy, and Maximilian, archduke of Austria whom ssie had married. Meanwhile a war with Scotland arose from causes now unknown ; but the aggression seems chargeable on the Englissi court, as a herald of peace from Scotland was dismissed without a hearing. An army of sixteen thousand, under Richard duke of Glocester, the only surviving brother of Edward, advanced to Edinburgh unopposed, as the Scottissi army had dispersed, on a dissension of the nobles, who had imprisoned their king.

The accounts which have till now sur vived, written by cotemporaries, are \u2022 very few and very imperfect ; and most of those, who have written histories of this period in later times, have added new imperfections from tradition, or from nonextant writings, uncertain or false, and even, in all appear ance, from their own imaginations. This obscure period would be obscurer still, if we had not the assistance of some French historians, par ticularly Philip de Comines, and Denguerran de Mon strelet, who give more circumstantial accounts of some Englissi transactions than are recorded by Englissi cotemporaries. Also in much less defective parts of our annals the writers of that nation have been use ful, as, for instance, in the reign of Henry the fifth, of whose, life an account, disgusting by its bombast, was composed by Thomas Elmham, prior of Linton, and another by a man whose real name is unknown, said to have been an Italian, who assumed the appel lation, and unsuccessfully attempted to imitate the style, of Titus Livius, the great historian of the Roman commonwealth. The former of these, both of whom wrote in latin, lived in the reign of Henry, the subject of his book, the latter in the minority of the succeeding monarch. Beside the anonymous continuator of the history of Croyland, we find among the cotemporary historians of the dark times William Bottoner, called also William of Wyrces ter, who wrote annals of England from 1324 to 1468, meager, in a barbarous style, and, as he lived Cot to finissi them, incorrect: and confused. John, Wethamstede, abbot of Saint Albans, who lived be- yond"], [827, "305 BRITISH HANDS. Chap. XXXIV. yond the age of a hundred, and was eighty.two years in priest's orders, wrote a chronicle of events from 1 44 1 to 1461, in which he recorded the affairs of his own abbey, with some public transactions and original papers. A history of the kings of England was written by John Rous or Rosse, a priest who died in 1491, so ignorant, credulous, and false, as to affirm, among other absurdities, that \" Richard the third had lain two years in his mother's womb, and was born with long hair, and his teeth complete.\" Beside these au thors, who wrote in latin, we find Harding, Fabian, and Caxton, who wrote in Englissi, all wretched his torians. The first has left us chronicles in rhime ; the third a continuation of Higden's polychronicon to the year 1483, which had been translated by Tre visa; and the seconds who was a merchant and al derman of London, a chronicle of England and France, to the year 1 504, styled the concordance of /lories. Far superior to these in style, but not in ve racity, was Sir Thomas More, who wrote copiously concerning the reigns of Edward the fifth and Rich ard the third, but left unfinissied his account of the latter. Of his nairative some parts are improbable^ some evidently false.

HISTORY OF THE faulty paraphrase by Strype or Kennet has, with most authors, superseded the original.\" This paraphrase only appears to have been consulted by Hume, whose impatience of minute research disqualified him on one hand for the office of a historian, for which, on the other, by his philosophical genius he was so re markably well fitted. The transactions of these times are also related, elegantly but unfairly, by Polydore Virgil, an Italian priest, who was sent in 1500 to collect in England the papal tributes, and, at the re quest of Henry the seventh, from whom he received his information, undertook his work in 1505. Histo ries were written, long after their reigns, with the supposed assistance of original papers, of Richard the third by Buck, of Henry the seventh by Bacon. The former appears partial to Richard, the narra tive of the latter, who publissied under Charles the second, was calculated for other purposes than the conveyance of genuine truths to the public, and consequently so mixed with fictitious matter, that to discriminate what the author himself considered as real facts is perhaps impossible. That the darkest part of a defective period in Englissi history should have place after the actual in troduction of printing into England, is doubtless surprizing, and heightens our idea of the causes to which we attribute such obscurity. From time im memorial had the art of printing, from engravings in wood, been practised in China, as was found when Europeans became acquainted with that vast empire ; but by whom the performance of the fame operation from types was first invented in Europe, is a question not"], [829, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 307 Chap XXXIV. Invention of gun- powder, not answerable with perfect certainty. The com monly received opinion is, that Laurentius Coster, keeper of the cathedral at Haerlem, first conceived the idea, and printed some books, with wooden types tied together with threads, between the years 1430 and 1440; that this invention, which he had wissied to keep secret for his private advantage, was, by his workman, John Geinsfleich, who absconded, car ried to Mentz, where, in two years afterwards, metal types were constructed and set in frames ; and that the art was thence disseminated to various towns, particularly Paris, where John Fust, or Faustus, having sold a number of bibles, all bearing an exact resemblance one to another, which could not be sup posed to happen in manuscript copies, was prosecuted as a magician, and obliged for his liberation to dis close the mystery. The first printer in England ap pears to have been William Cexton, the historian, who, having learned the trade in the Netherlands, established a press at Westminster in 1473* whence he publissied, in the March of 1474, a translation of a French treatise, called the game at chess, the first book known to have been printed in England. After this, in the space of seventeen years, about fifty books issued from his press, many of which Were translated by himself. The first printer in Scotland was Walter Chepman, a citizen of Edinburg, who began his typography, in 1508, with pamphlets, which are still preserved in one volume in the advo cate's library. Long previously to the invention of this noble art, so highly beneficial to mankind by its dissemination X 2 of"], [830, "HISTORY OF THE 308 Chaf. XXXIV. of knowledge, had another been invented, but not so speedily carried to any considerable pitch of improvement, the art of making gunpowder and fire-arms, by which the modes of war are totally changed in Europe, whether for the better or the worse, with respect to the state of society, as the question may be still problematical, Issiall not pretend to determine, though my judgment is in favour of the former. Gunpowder appears to have been known in China some centuries earlier than in Eu rope, but to have been used only in the explosions of mines, and in fireworks on festive occasions. I have already remarked in my twenty-fifth chapter, that its composition was discovered by the great Roger Bacon, in the thirteenth century, but concealed from the public from motives of benevolence. That it was in use before the fourteenth century in Europe we have no sort of proof, though this has been believed by some, who have probably been led into error by the accounts which they had found of the effects produced by the Greek fire. This was a liquid compound of tremendous operation, perhaps now unknown, employed in the wars between the Greeks and Saracens. With a thick smoke and a loud explosion, it produced a most fierce and obstinate flame, which expanded equally in all directions, downward and laterally as well as upward, was rendered still more vehement by the effusion of water, but was extinguissiable by some substances, as vinegar and sand. The last invention of gunpowder is ascribed to Barthold"], [831, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 309 Chap XXXIV. Barthold Schwartz, a German monk and chymlst, about the commencement of the fourteenth century, but the precise era of its application to the purposes of war is unknown. We find it, however, thus ap plied before the middle of the fame century, and the use of artillery, before the end, familiar to the Englissi on land and sea, as well as to other nations. That the army of Edward the third fought with engines of this kind in the battle of Crecy in 1346 appears very doubtful ; but bombs are mentioned by Robert Valturio, an Italian who wrote in 1483, long before cannons, which were at first called bombards, were improved to that great pitch of efficacy which they have in later times attained. The cannons were originally so formed as to widen from the chamber to the mouth.

Of the mussiet the invention, or the improve ment was later still than that of the cannon. No men tion, before the the sixteenth century, is found of this engine, at first ponderous and unhandy, fired on a rest by a match like a great gun. Fire-arms were extremely formidable by the force of their ssiot, too great for the resistance of armour; but, as expertness in their use, and facility in making gun powder, were very slowly acquired, men, long retained, after"], [832, "HISTORY OF THE 310 Chap XXXIV Accession of Edward. the fifth. 1483 after the introduction of these instruments, their an cient weapons, the bow, the pike, the battleaxe, and the iron mace, by which a warrior might be felled whose armour would not yield to the edge of a sword or point of a lance. The death of Edward the fourth, in a time of surprising historical obscurity, when improvements of great importance were taking place in literature and arts, was followed by a series of events, so dubiously or darkly recorded, as to render extreme caution in the compiler necessary. I mean to con fine myself, amid so much uncertainty, to a simple narration of what appear to be plain facts, divested of fiction, and to conjectures made with diffidence concerning the motives by which the several actors may have been influenced. Much assistance is fur nilhed by Walpole's Historic Doubts, and by the third number in the appendix to the sixth volume qf Henry's history of Britain. We are certain that the eldest son of the deceased monarch was acknow ledged by all parties the undoubted heir, and was proclaimed king immediately, without the least op ( rposition, under the name of Edward the fifth ; but as he was only in his thirteenth year, each of the sections, which divided the court, was anxious to hold possession of his person, for the sake of being enabled to exercise the administration of the government in his name. Of these factions, which the late king had striven in vain to reconcile, the one was composed of the queen and her rela tives, particularly the earl of Rivers her brother, and the marquis of Dorset her son by her first husoemd; the"], [833, "3U Chap XXXIV. BRITISH ILAXDS. the other of some nobles who dreaded the power of her aspiring semily, as Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham, the lords Hastings, Stanley, and Ho ward. A proposal was made by the queen's party, that a small army ssiould be raised for the purpose of conducting the young king to London, from Ludiow castle on the Welch border, where he was then resident under the guardianssiip of lord Rivers. To this the opposite party, who discerned the mo tive, made so violent an opposition in the council, particularly Hastings, that the escort was by mutual consent limited to two thousand. Richard, duke of Glocester, the only surviving brother of the late monarch, was levying troops in the north for a second expedition against the Scots, when he was informed of these events. Having taken and ad ministered in that quarter, an oath of allegiance to the new king, he hasted to the south, and was joined at Northampton by Buckingham, with whose faction he had coalesced. The young king, with his escort, on his way to the capital, lodged at the fame time, the twenty-ninth of April, at Stony Strat ford, ten miles from Northampton. Here after much outward appearance of an amicable disposition between the chiefs of the two parties, lord Rivers, and lord Richard Grey, a son of the queen, were arrested on the next morning, with some others, and sent to Pomfret castle; and all the res: of the king's attendants were dismissed ; but, to assuage the grief and terrour of the defenceless prince, duke Richard, falling on his knees before him,"], [834, "312 HISTORY OF THE Chap XX XIV. him, made the most solemn protestations of loyalty to his person, and declared that the measures now adopted were intended for his preservation. Duke Richard conducted young Edward to the metropolis, rode before him bareheaded through the streets on the fourth of May, calling to the people, \" behold your king,\" and assigned him lodgings in the bissiop's palace. By a great council, held in two or three days after, Richard was appointed protector of the king and kingdom during the mi nority ; the twenty-second of June was named for the day of Edward's coronation ; and that prince was re moved to royal apartments in the tower, as the place whence the kings, in that age, rode commonly in state, on the day before that of their coronation, to Westminster, Richard appears to have been at this time popular, to have acted with such prudence in his brother's reign as to have been obnoxious to neither faction, to have served that monarch with strict fide lity, and to have sustained on the whole amount such a character, that, if he had then happened to die, or had never aspired above the office of pro tector, he would now be regarded, from the records of history, as a wise and able statesman: but a new scene was opened, the transactions of which, trans mitted by writers who wissied to gratify his bitterest enemies, have rendered his character doubtful to the inquisitive, and to the uninquisitive detestable. While the protector still seemed earnest in pre paring for the coronation of young Edward, a coun cil was held by him in the tower on the thirteenth of June, where a cry of \" treason\" was suddenly raised"], [835, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 313 Chap XXXIV raised without ; a body of the guards russied into the apartment ; wounded lord Stanley on the head with a poleaxe; seized that nobleman, together with the archbissiop of York, the bissiop of Ely, and lord Hastings ; conducted the three former to prison, and immediately beheaded the fourth on a block of wood which happened to be lying in the court of the tower. Whether this charge of treason was founded in fact or fictitious is totally unknown. On the fame day the earl of Rivers and lord Rich ard Grey, with others who had been arrested at Stony Stratford, were beheaded at Pomfret, without trial, and with circumstances of wanton cruelty, by Sir Richard Radclisse, who, acting under the pro tector's orders, was leading an army of five thousand men to London, This execution may have been in tended as a preparatory step to an unopposed usur pation of the regal dignity, or may have been caused by revenge in the protector for the legal murder of his brother Clarence, procured in the late reign by the influence of the queen's faction. About this time the council resolved, that Richard duke of York, the younger and only royal brother of the new king, ought to be removed from the sanctuary in Westminster, where the unhappy queen had taken refuge with her family, on the news of the arrest at Stony Stratford. They said, that to allow this young prince to remain in such a place, among criminals, at a time of his brother's corona tion, would be highly indecent. For this purpose a deputation, with cardinal Bourchier at its head, was sent to the queen, who resigned her son into the hands"], [836, "314 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXIV. Acer Hi .n of Richard the third. 1483 hands of this prelate, willingly, fays a cotemp-orary writer, with reluctance and terrour, fay later authors, on what grounds we are not informed. A story was now propagated, that the late king had been privately married, by Stillington, bissiop of Bath, to lady Eleanor Butler, widow of lord Butler of Sudsey, previously to his marriage with lady Elizabeth Grey; that his marriage with the latter was null, as having had place before the death of the former ; that consequently the children of the late king by lady Elizabeth were illegitimate; and that, as the children of the ,duke of Clarence were excluded from the succession by his attainder, the protector was the only rightful heir of the mon- archy. This private marriage appears very probable, from circumstances not necessary to be stated here, and may have been now first made known to the protector by his sister, the dutchess of burgundy, when ssie saw him in a situation for the enforcing of his claim. On sunday, the twenty-second of June, the day which had been appointed for the co- ronation of young Edward, who may be considered as then dethroned, a sermon was preached at Saint Paul's, in favour of the protector's title, by doctor Shaw, brother to the mayor of London. The duke of Buckingham made an eloquent harangue on the fame subject, on the tuesday following, to the alder- men and citizens, from the hustings in Guiidhall.

He was installed on that day, as king at Westminster; was proclaim ed on the next under the name of Richard the third ; and was crowned on the sixth of the suc ceeding month. What became of the two young princes, the dethron ed Edward and his brother, of whom I ssiall hereafter have occasion to speak, has never been made known. From the time of Richard's accession they were closely confined in the tower. Insurrections for their liberation, and the dethronement of their uncle, were planned in several parts of the kingdom. The duke of Buckingham, the most powerful of the Eng lissi nobles, and the chief instrument of Richard's elevation, acceded to the conspiracy, and became its head. When the plans were matured, a report was circulated that the two princes had been secretly murdered in the tower by order of the new monarch. Whence this rumour originated, or what was the cause of Buckingham's defection, we have no means of dis covering. He seems to have been amply rewarded for his services by Richard, but is said to have been influenced against him by sv'orcon, bishop of Ely, who had been released from his prison in the tower, and committed to the custody of this nobleman. His ultimate object may have been the obtaining of the regal dignity for himself as a descendant of Edward the third, and the securing of it to his heirs by the marriage of his son to the princess Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Edward the fourth; notwith standing that the ostensible, if not the real, design of many"], [838, "HISTORY OF THE 316 Chap XXX IV Posterior t-an^ac tiunt. 1484. 1485 many of the conspirators was to place Henry Tudor, earl of Richmond, on the throne, and to unite the line of Lancaster, of which he was regarded as the .remaining heir, with that of York, by his marriage with that princess. The conspirators, by general concert, erected their standards, in several places, all in one day, the eighteenth of October ; but Buckingham, who had assembled an army in Wales, was frustrated in his de sign of crossing the Severn, to join his confederates, by unusual rains, which caused a vast swell in that river, long remembered under the name of Bucking ham's flood. Dissieartend by this phenomenon, his troops disoanded, and he found himself under the necessity of absconding in the house of one of his de pendants, named Bannister. Richard had been in formed of this insurrection, in a progress which he was making through the northern counties, and had advanced to Liecester against the duke, when the news arrived of that nobleman's disaster. He issued a proclamation, offering rewards for the cap tion of the chiefs, and a pardon to all the lower members of the conspiracy who ssiould desert their leaders. A general dispersion of the insurgents was the consequence: most of their commanders escaped beyond sea or into sanctuaries ; but Buckingham was betrayed by his host and beheaded at Salissiury. Having thus without a battle triumphed over the revolters, Richard convened a parliament in the January of 1484. In this, beside the enaction of laws useful and popular, the title of the present king was confirmed, the offspring of Edward the fourth"], [839, "31T Chap XXXIV. Henry TV dor.

He is said to have engaged on oath, in the house of lords, for the safe ty of the dowager queen, and her five daughters, and for their support, in a decent, though humble, condition. All these ladies, relinquissiing the sanc tuary, placed themselves under his power and pro tection. His consort died, of what disorder is un known, in the March of 1485, without leaving him an heir, as Edward, his only son, had died before her. She was the youngest daughter of the great earl of Warwick, and the widow of prince Edward, the heir of Henry the sixth. In this situation, Richard proposed to unite himself in marriage with the princess Elizabeth, his niece, the eldest daugh ter of Edward the fourth, to prevent her projected match with the earl of Richmond, who was prepa ring for an invasion. The proposal was quite agree able to the princess and her mother, and a dispen sation was requested from the pope for the purpose, but the. news of it caused Richmond to accelerate his preparations. Of this nobleman's descent, and fortune hitherto, a ssiort account is here necessary. Catherine of France, the queen of Henry the fifth of England, married, soon after that monarch's death, Sir Owen Tudor, a Welch gentleman, by whom ssie had three sons, Edmund, Jasper, and Owen. Sir Owen, her hussiand, was captured at the battle of Mortimer's cross, 1461, and beheaded by Edward the fourth. Edmund had been created earl of Richmond, by Henry the sixth, in 1452, and had married the lady Margaret, the only daughter"], [840, "313 Chap XXXIV. HISTORY OF THE daughter of John Beaufort, duke of Somerset. The offspring of this marriage was a son who afterwards became Henry the seventh on the Englissi throne. This lady was descended from one of the natural sons of John of Guant, duke of Lancaster, by Ca therine Swineford. These sons had been legitima ted by act of parliament ; but had been declared, by the fame authority, incapable of succeeding to the crown, or of transmitting to their posterity any right of royal succession. Yet Henry Tudor, the son of Edmund, was, in right of the line of Somer set, regarded as the representative of the house of Lancaster. He escaped out of England, with his uncle, Jasper Tudor, earl of Pembroke, after the battle of Tewksoury, in 1471, and was hospitably entertained, but carefully guarded, by the duke of Brittanny, who maintained an alliance with Edward the fourth. When this alliance was dissolved by the death of Edward, he was allowed to prepare a small armament for the invasion of England, in aid of Buckingham's insurrection ; but his fleet was driven back to France by a tempest, and he soon received the news of his confederate's destruction. At length an intellectual decline in the duke of Brit tanny, whose generosity had hitherto resisted the so licitations of both Edward and Richard, gave an op portunity to his favourite minister, who was bribed by Richard, to form a plan for the betraying of the Tudors into the hands of that monarch: but, re ceiving a hint of their danger, the two earls made their escape to the French court, where, with the rest"], [841, "3tS\u00bb Chap XXXIV, Tudor's in vasion. 1485 Battle of Boswor\u00bbh. 1485 August 13 BRITISH ILAXDS. Test of the Englissi exiles, the sound a friendly re ception. With about a thousand Englissi exiles, and two thousand French adventurers, the earl of Richmond landed at Milford haven, on the seventh of August, in the year 1485. As he advanced through Wales and Shropssiire, his army encreased to the number of six thousand by the accession of his friends ; but he was stopped in his progress near Bosworth in in Leicesterssiire, by the approach of king Richard at the head of troops more than twice as nume rous. That monarch had prepared against this invasion with diligence and activity. He had negoci ated a truce and alliance with Scotland, raised money by benevolence, equipped a sleet, and taken station at Nottingham, from which, as a spot not far from central, he could in a ssiort time march to any quar ter invaded. He had obliged lord Stanley, long liberated from prison, to deliver into custody his son as a hostage, since, being husband to the countess of Richmond, he was suspected of disaffection, notwith standing his vehement professions to the contrary. That nobleman, however, conveyed secretly to Rich mond assurances of his intended desertion to his side, whenever he ssiould find the opportunity of effecting it with the greatest advantage to his in terest. When the two armies advanced against each other to battle, on the twenty-third of August, near Bos worth, the vast superiority of number on the side of Richard was more than counterbalanced by a mutual distrust among his officers, and by the actual"], [842, "HISTORY OF THE 320 Chap XXXIV. Death of Richard. 1485 Character of Richard actual treachery of lord Stanley and his brother Sir William. The former, who had arrived with an additional body of troops, took station on one wing, opposite to the interval between the two armies, in such manner as to be able occasionally to join either. Probably Richard perceived his design, but abstained from the execution of his hostage, wissiing him to prolong his ambiguous conduct, and hoping meanwhile to obtain the victory, by which he would be fully enabled to punissi all who ssiould have deserted his cause. When the main body of his host had closed in conflict with the foe, the troops of lord Stanley assailed him in flank and threw all into disorder. Finding the fortune of the day adverse, he resolved by a desperate onset to kill his rival or perissi in the attempt. Followed by a few determined adherents, he burst into the enemy's host, and overthrowing all in his way, approached the station of Henry, slew the standardbearer of that earl, and was on the point of assailing his person, when himself was surrounded by the throng and slain. His body found in a heap of slaughtered enemies, was, after an exposure to the public eye during some days, buried in the church of Gray friars at Leicester. Richard was thirty-two years of age at his death, and had reigned two years and two months. The assertions of later historians, that his\" person was deformed, are found to be false. His stature was low, and one of his ssioulders was somewhat higher than the other. In courage, and, with due allow ance for his size, in feats of arms, he was exceeded by"], [843, "BRITISH II.AXDS. 321 Chap XXXI V. by none. He was also endowed with extraordinary powers of eloquence. To ascertain his moral cha racter is now impossible. That before the accession of his nephew, Edward the fifth, he committed crimes which writers in later ages have charged to his account, we have no reason to believe. He appears to have so far. conducted himself with de cency, and to have been at that time a favourite with the nation in general. As none dared to write in his favour until some ages after his death, we are not furnissied with the means of tracing the mo tives of those violent acts which he perpetrated after the demise of his brother Edward ; as the executions of the earl of Rivers, lord Hastings, and others, without any trial ; the dethronement of his nephew for his own elevation ; and the close con finement of this young prince and his brother in the tower. All these have been represented as the mere consequences of a preconcerted plan of usur pation ; yet they may have arisen from other in centives. A dread and hatred of the queen's party, who had effected the death of his brother Clarence, and might, if possessed of the sovereign power, effect also his own, may have incited him to the destruction of Rivers and his chief associates : a sud den detection of some dangerous plot may have caused the sudden execution of Hastings : and a late information of his nephew's illegitimacy, toge ther with a desire of rendering himself secure from any future vengeance of the queen's faction, may have been his reason for claiming the crown.

JLN Richard the third expired the line of Planta genet monarchs, which had reigned in England three hundred and thirty-one years, from the ac cession of Henry the second in 1154. The dynasty of the Tudors commenced in the earl of Richmond, who was proclaimed king by his soldiers in the field of battle at Bosworth, under the name of Henry the seventh, and was crowned with a kind of dia dem which Richard had worn in the fight. Henry who had not hitherto avowed any pretension to the crown, acted thenceforth as undoubted sovereign, and never would permit his title to be questioned, though, except possession, no ground for that title could be ssiewn. Neither had the line of Lancaster a right to the succession, while the house of York was not extinct, nor was he legitimately the heir of that line.

A parliament, convened at Westminster, in the November of 1485, enacted, that the inheritance of the crown ssiould rest in the person of Henry the seventh, \" and in the heirs of his body lawfully coming, perpetually, with the grace of God, so to endure, and in none other.\" By the fame autho rity the attainders of the Lancastrians were re versed, and above thirty lords and gentlemen at tainted, who had fought under the banners of Rich ard at Bofworth ; the defenders of a king, to whom the whole nation had sworn fealty, against an at tainted outlaw, who had not even advanced any pretension to the throne! Though the Yorkists in this parliament were unable to prevent this flagrant injustice, nor the tacit exclusion of Elizabeth's right, they had sufficient influence to pro.ure an address to Henry for the conclusion of his much desired espousals of that princess. The matrimo nial ceremony was at length performed in the ensu ing January, and followed by excessive rejoicings in London and elsewhere. These rejoicings, far great er than those which had taken place at his own accession and coronation, ssiewed Henry how much the house of York possessed the public favour, and raised"], [847, "BRITISH ILANDS. 325 Chap XXXV. V_-\"Y>-' Insurrec tion of Lambert Simnel. 1487 raised in his mind a political jealousy against his beautiful and amiable consort, whom he always afterwards treated with unkindness. He delayed the ceremony of her coronation till the end of the year 1487, when, from sear of the public anger, he allowed it to be solemnized. An irritation in the public mind had been meanwhile manifested in such manner as to threaten the safety of his govern ment. An insurrection under lord Level was dissipated by a proclamation of pardon to all who ssiould desert their leaders, but another soon followed of a more threatening appearance. A report was in circula tion, that Richard Plantagenet, duke of York, the younger son of Edward the fourth, had escaped from his prison in the tower, and would ssiortly appear among the friends of his family to assert his right, as the surviving heir of his father, to the crown. Lambert Simnel, the natural son of a baker at Oxford, handsome, graceful, and acute, about the age of fifteen, was assiduously instructed by Richard Simon, a priest, to personate this duke. Most probably the contrivers of the scheme were persons of superior consequence, but the affair is involved in mystery quite impenetrable. Meanwhile another rumour gained belief, that Edward Planta genet, earl of Warwick, nephew of Edward the fourth, and son of the duke of Clarence, had ef fected his escape, and would soon emerge into pub lic view. From political jealousy, this yourg and innocent prince had been held in confinement, by Richard the third, in Shropssiire, and imme- diately"], [848, "326 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXV diately after the battle of Bosworth had been re moved by Henry, to close imprisonment in the tower where he was falsely believed by some to have pe rissied. On the report of his flight the plan of Simon was altered. Instead of the duke of York, Simnel began to personate the earl of Warwick. As both Warwick and Simnel were known in England, another scene for the commencement of operations was necessary. Ireland was chosen, where Clarence had been born, and where the Yorkists were predominant since the administration of that prince's father. On the arrival of the pretended earl in Dublin, the people almost universally decla- red in his favour ; and the lord-deputy, Gerald Fitzgerarld, earl of Kildare, with his council of state, proclaimed him king, under the name of Edward the sixth, without consideration of other claims to the Englissi crown, preferable to that of Warwick. His coronation was afterwards per- formed, with all possible pomp, with a diadem taken from an image of the Blessed Virgin in Christ's church, whence he was conveyed, according to the custom of the ancient Irish, on the ftoulders of an Englissi chieftain of Meath, named Darcy, to the castle. Two thousand veteran Germans, under Martin Swaart, an experienced officer, arrived in Ireland to aid the cause. These had been furnissi- ed to the earl of Lincoln, a son of the eldest sister of Edward the fourth, by the dutchess of Burgun dy, another sister of that monarch. The plan of the chief conspirators appears to have been to endea vour to draw Henry with his forces into Ireland, which"], [849, "BRITISH 1LANDS. 327 Chap, XXXV. which would furnissi an opportunity for the rising of his enemies in England : but this was impractica ble from the condition of the colony. Only a small andimpoverissied part of Ireland, utterly unequal to the support of a court and army, belonged to the Eng lissi of the Pale, whose weakness was such, amid their preparations for Henry's dethronement, that their borders were ravaged, without resistance, by a sept of Irish. The ardour of the soldiers, who hoped for success and riches, accorded with the ex isting necessity. The army embarked, and landed at Foudrey in Lancassiire on the fourth of June. The king had been greatly alarmed by the news of this conspiracy, and had made all possible inquiries and preparations. He must have per- ceived that the principal plotters meant only to make a pageant of Simnel, whom, in case of their success, they could easily set aside in favour of their real object. The public wrere astonissied at the first step which he took. He seized the queen dow- ager, stripped her of all pecuniary resources,and com- mitted her to close imprisonment in the convent of Bermondsey. The pretence was her having come out of her sanctuary in the time of Richard, and having permitted her daughter to fall into the hands of that monarch. This, which had been long before par doned, if it could be brought under the denomination of a crime, could not be the real cause. We are there- sore warranted to conjecture, that ssie was possessed of some important secret, the divulging of which would endanger the present government. Perhaps her son, the duke of York was still alive, and ssie acquainted with"], [850, "HISTORY OF THE 328 Chap XXXV. with the fact. To undeceive the people of England, Warwick was conducted publicly from the tower through the streets of the metropolis, and exhibited at Saint-Paul's, where the spectators were invited to approach and converse with him. This proba bly was a disappointment to the contrivers of the plot, for they seem to have actually believed this young prince to have been privately murdered by Henry's order. The Englissi of Ireland were how ever assured, that the person thus exhibited was an imposter, and that themselves were possessed of the true Plantagenet. The forces of Simnel, joined by Sir Thomas Broughton and his troop, soon after their landing, directed their march at first to York; but were ut terly disappointed in their hopes of an insurrection in their favour. Seeing thus the necessity of a quick decision, they altered their course, and met the royal army at the village of Stoke in the ssiire of Not tingham. The battle fought at this place, on the sixteenth of June, was one of the most obstinate recorded by historians. Notwithstanding the great superiority of number on the side of Henry, who led in person his forces, the event might have been different, if the troops of Ireland had been armed and disciplined in the Englissi manner. But the Englissi colonists in that country, forgetting the heavy armour and weapons of their ancestors, had adopted those of the old natives, fit only for desul tory warfare. Yet the furious onset and desperate valour of these colonists, supported by the steadiness of the veteran Germans, made for some time an alarming"], [851, "BRITISH ILANDS. 329 Chap, XXXV Character of Henry, alarming impression : but the slaughter of these men, who, though unable to stand against superior arms, disdained to retreat, so dissieartened their associates, that a victory quite decisive was gained by the king, whose loss amounted to about two thousand. Of the invaders about four thousand were slain, together with Swaart, Broughton, the lords Lincoln and Lovel, and two Fitzgeraids, brothers of the lord deputy. Among the prisoners were Simnel, and his tutor Simon. The latter perimed in prison : the former, admitted to pardon, was at first made a scullion in the royal kitchen, and afterwards pro moted, in the king's houssiold, to the office of fal coner. To punissi all who could be discovered to have favoured the invasion, strict inquiries were made in the northern counties. Not many suffered death ; but the king's avarice was gratified by the exaction of severe fines from such as had furnissied any pretence of suspicion, even by words undesignedly or innocently spoken. Flenry had given an early specimen of stately re serve in his first entrance into the metropolis, after the battle of Bofworth, when he refused to gratify the public by a sight of his person, which he con cealed in a close litter. Other parts of his charac ter became successively developed, and presented on the whole amount not an amiable picture. He was somewhat taller than the middle size, slender, straight, firm, and active; of a grave aspect, satur nine temperament, and generally in his deportment austere and sullen, but capable of occasionally assum ing a different appearance. His understanding, though"], [852, "HISTORY OF THE 330 Chap XXXV. Transac, tion. with France. 1 18 My 2, though sound, was narrow. This defect he endea voured to compensate by mature and indefatigable deliberation. He was cool, suspicious, artful, de signing, and impenetrably secret in all his schemes. The success, with which his dark policy and unwearied application were generally attended, gained him such repute, that he was denominated the Englissi Solo mon. He wanted not courage personal or political, but this was of a cautious, not an enterprising na ture. He was excessively selfissi and unfeeling, al most or altogether incapable of entertaining senti ments of love, benevolence, friendssiip, or generosity, though two or three of his actions might seem to bear a semblance of the last. In his hatred to the house of York he was so relentless, that all the endearing graces, and submissive gentleness, of his beautiful consort could never elicit kind treatment from him. His ruling passion was avarice, which he carried to sordid minuteness and cruel oppression. He doubtless deserted the odious name of tyrant ; but, as he crussied the petty tyrants, the feudal no bility, and by a steady administration enforced the laws, his reign was, in a general conception, very salutary to his people. A much greater opportunity of amassing riches was afforded to this avaricious monarch by the affairs of France than by the revolt of Simnel. Taking advantage of dissentions between the duke and the nobles of Brittanny, the French court attempted, by a formidable invasion, to conquer, and reanex to the crown, that important fief. The inhabitants were unable to defend their country by their own unaided"], [853, "BRITISH ILANDS. 331 Chap, XXXV. v__^W-\u00bb 1*88 148S unaided strength, even when, convinced too late of their error, they had become reunited against the common foe. Assistance was therefore earnestly so licited from the king of England, from whom, as interested to prevent the aggrandizement of the French monarchy, it might most naturally be ex pected. The plan formed by Henry, on this occa sion, was to draw from his subjects, who were generally eager for a war with France, as much money as possible, under pretence of arming for the protection of Brittanny, and to prevent, without expence, the conquest of that province by the arts of negociation. By magnificent professions of war like designs he obtained considerable supplies from his parliament, the levying of which caused an in surrection, not suppressed without bloodssied, in the counties of York and Durham. He then sent am bassadors to the court of France under the pretence of mediating a peace, which he had declared to his parliament to be unattainable. By these he pri vately concluded a truce with that court, unknown to his subjects for many years after, without the least mention of the duke of Brittanny, whom he thus perfiduously abandoned, while he warmly pro fessed himself his protector. The duke, afteravainexpectationofsuccourfromhis treacherous ally, at length rissied a battle at Saint Au bin,encouraged by the arrival of four hundred Englissi, brought, without the king's authority, by lord Wood ville, the queen dowager's brother. The duke was de feated, and all the Englissi, with Woodville, slain. From a fear of rousing the Englissi nation and its king into actual hostility, the ministers of France, who acted with"], [854, "HISTORY OF THE 332 Chap XXXV, 1491 with profound policy throughout this business, granted to the defeated prince an insidious peace, of which they well understood the advantage. On the decease of the duke, who left his daughter Anne sole heiress of his dominions, Henry was loud and vehement in declaring his resolution of furnissiing to this princess effectual aid. Embassies were sent by him with much ostentation to all the neighbouring potentates, as if he intended to form against France a powerful confe deracy. He also transported six thousand archers into Brittanny, in the March of 1489, to the assist ance of the young dutchess ; but obliged her to give the most ample security for the complete reimburse ment of every expence incurred on account of this armament ; and yet by these troops, who remained not longer than eight months in the country, no ser vice was performed, and the inhabitants were much damaged. No solicitations could prevail on Flenry to give other protection than threats of war against France, in conjunction with allies with whom he ne gotiated. These threats and negociations served at once to intimidate the French government, and to amuse his own subjects, who were fired with ardour for an invasion of France. But means more effec tual were employed by his opponents, who seem to have penetrated the object of his sclfissi policy. Re solving to pussi to a speedy conclusion, with their ut most vigour, a war which had languissied from va rious causes, the French attacked Rennes with a numerous army, and, using persuasion as well as force, prevailed on the dutchess, who was inclosed in that city, to give her hand in marriage to their sovereign,"], [855, "533 Chap xxxv, 1491 1492, BRITISH ILANDS. sovereign, Charles the eighth, who thus united Brit tanny to the crown of France. Chagrined at the defeat of his schemes by the ad dress of his antagonists, yet resolving to avail him self of the event for the indulgence of his predomi nant passion, Henry made mighty vaunts of his de termination to invade, and even to conquer, the dominions of Charles, and actually with seeming earnestness made vigorous preparations. He raised money by benevolence in the direct violation of law, and employed in its exaction this dilemma. If a man's mode of living was hospitable, or in any de gree expensive, he was required, as an opulent per son, to contribute liberally : and if he lived in a mean or frugal style, he was told that, enriched by his oeconomy, he was well enabled to be bountiful. Transported with joy at the promised invasion, the parliament, which was convened soon after, gave a sanction to this measure so illegal and oppressive, by ordering the arrears of the benevolence to be levied, and granted also additional supplies. Henry landed at Calais, in the October of 1492, with a formida ble army of near thirty thousand, with which, in a few days after, he invested Boulogne. No alarm from this invasion appears to have affected the court of France. Most probably a treaty of peace had al- ready been concluded privately with that court, and all the parade of military operations was intended merely to dupe the people of England. Letters from the allies of the Englissi monarch in Germany and Spain were published to his troops, announcing these princes to be as yet unprepared for co-opera- tion."], [856, "HISTORY OF THE 334 Chap XXXV Transac tions of Perkin Warbeck, 1492, 1499, tion. That monarch affected an unwillingness at first to accept what were offered as the terms of paci fication by the enemy. The matter was referred to a council of officers. By these a petition, dictated by himself, was presented to the king, in which they advised him to accept the terms, and stated their rea sons for this advice. They had the effrontery to af firm that this was the most glorious treaty ever made by a king of England with a king of France. Henry suffered himself to be persuaded. He signed the treaty, and received from the French monarch, as the purchase of reconciliation, seven hundred and forty-five thousand crowns, perhaps not inferior in value to a -million of pounds at present. While the monarch was enriched, many Englissi gentlemen were ruined, who had raised troops at great expence to embark in this expedition, in the hope of thence ac quiring both wealth and honour. Before the conclusion of this pacific treaty, Henry had been alarmed by the appearance of a man, who claimed the crown of England as Richard, duke of York, the younger son of Edward the fourth. This youth had chosen Ireland for the scene of his first attempt, where the Englissi colonists were mostly in clined to the Yorkist faction. He had landed at Cork, without troops or retinue, in 1492 ; had been received with the honours due to a prince by the chief magistrate ; and had addressed letters to the earls of Desmond and Kildare. The former declared openly in his favour, and the latter was suspected of intending the same. But the Englissi of Ireland were relieved from the apprehension of being involved in a new"], [857, "BRITISH ILANDS. 335 Chap XXXV 1193. 1493 new revolt against the reigning monarch. The claimant was invited to Paris by Charles the eighth, where he was treated with princely respect, and join ed by above a hundred Englissi gentlemen. On the approach of a peace between Flenry and Charles, he retired with speed into the Netherlands, fearing that the betraying of his person into the hands of the former might be made an article of the treaty. Here he was received by the dutchess of Burgundy as her real nephew, the duke of York. In consequence of a private conversation of some Yorkists in England, Sir Robert Clifford, who had been well acquainted with duke Richard in his puerile years, was sent to the court of the dutchess at Brussels to ascertain the identity or diversity of this pretender. After fre quent conversations with this personage, Clifford wrote to his friends, that his conviction of the iden tity was such as to leave no room for doubt. Meanwhile no means were neglected by Henry to discredit the title, and counteract the attempts, of this new rival. He first endeavoured to establissi among his subjects a belief, that the duke of York had been murdered in the tower, together with his brother, Edward the fifth, by the order of Richard the third. For this purpose Sir James Tirrel, lieute nant of the tower, and one John Dighton, were seized and examined. Their confession was imme diately publissied, \" that this Dighton, and one Miles Forest, since deceased, had smothered the two young princes in their bed, and had ssiewed their dead bo dies naked to Tirrel ; and that these bodies were first buried under the stairs, but afterwards removed by the"], [858, "356 Chap, XXXV 1493 HISTCRY OF THE the priest of the tower to another place, which could not now be discovered, because the priest was dead.\" Tirrel and Dighton were set at liberty, after this con- fession, which appears to have been fabricated, was little credited at the time, and was not afterwards employed by Henry in any of his declarations. The king also publissied an account of this pretender, said to be the result of enquiries made by spies whom he had sent into the Netherlands. This publication stated, that he was the son of one John Ossieck or Warbeck, a converted Jew of Tournay ; that he had been born in London, where his father had been a ssiort time resident on mercantile business ; that Ed- ward the fourth, into whose favour his father had contrived to gain admission, had been his godfather; that his parents had carried him in his childhood to Tournay ; and that he had lived some time, when he was a boy, with a relative at Antwerp, after which he had been such a wanderer that he could not be any further traced. To account for his correct pro- nunciation of the Englissi tongue, he was said to have conversed much with Englishmen in all his wan- derings ; but how could this be discovered in wan- derings untraceable ? To account for his striking resemblance to the duke of York, Edward the fourth was reported to have had an illicit intercourse with the mother of this youth, whose name was said to be Perkin Warbeck, and under this alone he is re corded in history. Beside numbers of inferior spies, Henry found the means of engaging in this employment several gen tlemen of rank, who went to Brussels, and declared themselves"], [859, "BRITISH II.ANDS. 337 Chap XXXV 1494, 1495 themselves most violent partizans of Warbeck. To procure to these all possible confidence with the man whom they designed to betray, he feigned the utmost vehemence of rage against them, proclaimed them outlaws, and caused them even to be excommuni cated in the most public manner. According to their instructions, they spared no expence for the gaining of Sir Robert Clifford, who, being War beck's chief confidant, was enabled to be the most detrimental to his cause. From intelligence thus procured, which laid open the whole correspondence of the pretender's favourers in England, a number of men high in rank and influence were suddenly arrested, and put to death. Sir Robert Clifford soon after made his appearance, and accused Sir William Stanley, the chief instrument of Henry's elevation to the throne. If any gratitude had place in the royal breast, it was quite overbalanced by anger, po licy, and avarice. Sir William was beheaded, and all his vast wealth confiscated to swell the treasury of an unfeeling master. Terror and mutual distrust so pervaded the Yorkists, that no confederacy could be formed in England against the king, who paid libe rally to spies, though otherwise a niggard. When such was the state of affairs at home, and the princes on the continent were se engaged in their own affairs that none of them could afford him ef fectual assistance, Warbeck concluded that his friends could not otherwise have an opportunity of rising in his favour than by his actual appearance among them in England. Collecting a body of troops of different nations, by the aid of his supposed aunt, Vol. II. Z the"], [860, "'-.3 Chap XXXV 1495 HISTORY OF THE the dowager dutchess of Bungundy, he failed from Flanders, approached the coast of Kent, and sent a party on ssiore to gain intelligence, and invite the people to join his standard. The inhabitants, appre hensive of danger to their properties from foreign bands of a suspicious appearance, and preferring their present peaceful condition to contests concern ing regal heirssiip, resolved to adhere to the mo narch in possession, and to attempt, as an essential service, to entice the pretender on ssiore, and to seize his person or to kill him. Failing in this at tempt, as Warbeck was on his guard, they fell on those who had landed, slew many, and took the rest prisoners to the number of a hundred and fifty, all of whom were hanged by order of the king. War beck returned to Flanders, where he next year found his situation unsafe. The total interruption of com merce between the Netherlands and England, by the resentment of Henry, was so distressing to the inha bitants of the former, that, by earnest petitions, they prevailed on their sovereign, the archduke of Au stria, to negociate a renewal of commercial treaties with that kingdom. An article of this new com pact was plainly calculated for the expulsion of Hen ry's rival, who, in consequence, departed from Flan ders, and landed in Ireland with a few adherents. Joined here by the earl of Desmond with his forces, he summoned the city of Waterford. He was re pulsed by the citizens, who had been reinforced by the Butlers and other adherents of the Lancas trian party. Perceiving his cause to be desperate in this iland from measures which had been adopted by the"], [861, "BRITISH ILANDS. 339 Chap XXXV. \u2014 ' 149G, the king, he set fail for Scotland, to whose monarch he is said to have had letters of recommendation from the emperor of Germany, the king of France, and the archduke of Austria. From the moment of his accession, Henry had en- deavoured, with earnest assiduity, to cultivate peace with the Scottissi nation, and was now labouring to procure a most intimate connexion with its monarch, James the fourth, by negociating a marriage be- tween Margaret, his eldest daughter, and that prince. On the other hand, James could not be ignorant of the danger and folly of attempting, without some proportionate cause, the dethronement of so potent and politic a neighbour as Henry. Yet this prince immediately entered into a close league with War- beck, on his arrival at his court ; gave him in mar- riage his relative, lady Catherine Gordon, one of the most beautiful, accomplissied, and amiable wo- men of the age ; and raised an army for his assist- ance in the asserting of his claim to the crown of England. He was doubtless fully convinced that this claimant was the real duke of York, and expect- ed that great numbers of the Englissi would flock to his banners, on his appearance among them with a military force. In the October of 1496 he entered Northumberland with his army, and published War- beck's manifesto. This was a long and artful com- position. It is given in the first number of the ap- pendix to the sixth volume of Henry's history of Britain, from a genuine copy, very different from that which we find in Bacon's narrative. Few or none of the Englissi in that quarter were found will- Z 3 ing"], [862, "HISTORY OF THE 340 Chap XXXV, 1497 ing to run the rift of enlisting under his auspices, as they were not certain of his title, regarded his Scot tissi friends as their greatest enemies, and were strong ly impressed with ideas of the policy and good for tune of the present king, and of the rigorous exe cution of his vengeance if the enterprize ssiould have failed, The Scots, who had entered the country as friends, changed their plan, when they perceived this disposition in the people, and had recourse to the modes of pillage usual in their incursions. War beck expostulated, declaring that he would rather continue deprived of his right, than recover his crown by the ruin of his subjects. James replied, irritated by his disappointment, \" you feel too much for subjects, who acknowledge you not as king, and are devoted to your capital enemy.\" To secure their booty the Scots returned home, before they could\" be attacked by the forces of Henry. Anxious, on the subsidence of this alarm by the retreat of the Scots, to avail himself of such a handle to raise money, Henry, in a speech to his parlia ment, in the January of the following year, affected to seel the keenest resentment for the sufferings of his subjects in the north, and declared his- resolution of taking signal vengeance for the national insult. A great sum was voted under certain restrictions, by which its application was appropriated to a war with Scotland; but these restrictions were totally disre garded by the king. The people of Cornwall refused to pay, irritated by former exactions, and informed by Thomas Flammock, a lawyer, that the tax was ille gal, since the northern barons were bound by their tenures"], [863, "BRITISH ILANDS. 341 Chap XXXV 1497 tenures to defend the country against the Scots. By the advice of the fame they assembled with such asms as they could procure, and advanced toward Londen, with encreasing numbers, to present a pe tition to the king against the tax, and for the dismis sion of bad advisers. At Wells, where they amount ed to about sixteen thousand, Thomas Touches, lord Audley, put himself at their head. They ar rived without opposition at Black-heath near Lon don, but were at length assailed on different sides by the royal forces, far superior in number, as well as arms and tactics. They fought with bravery, but were totally defeated. About two thousand were slain, and all the rest taken prisoners. Audley, Flammock, and another leader, named Michael Jo seph, were executed. AU the captives of low rank were permitted to return home. Among the causes of this clemency may have been their inoffensive conduct throughout their march, and their silence with respect to the validity of the king's title. While the main body of the Englissi forces were employed in the south by this insurrection, the Scots made a second incursion into the northern counties, but retired on the approach of an army under lord Surrey. As James was now convinced, that to raise Warbeck to the Englissi throne was altogether be yond his power, he readily admitted the mediation of the Spanissi ambassador for a peace, of which the king of England, notwithstanding his far superior force, was extremely desirous. The unfortunate pretender, with warm expressions of gratitude to the Scottissi monarch, sailed for Ireland, with zfcove a hundred"], [864, "$42 Chap XXXV. 1498, 1498 HISTORY OF THE hundred followers, and his consort who was deter- mined to accompany him through all perils. He rei mained protected in the wild recesses of this country, until a second insurrection in Cornwall invited him into England. The Cornissi insurgents, who had been captured at Black-heath and dismissed, were more emboldened by the experience of war than dis- couraged by defeat ; and as the tax was collected with rigour, they again took arms. Either spon- taneously resolving to try his fortune in England by the aid of this revolt, or receiving a message to that purpose from the insurgents, Warbeck embarked for Cornwall, and landed at Whitsand bay in the September of 1498. With three thousand men, who joined him at Bodmin, he attempted to gain Exeter, but was repulsed by the citizens, who saw the total improbability of success on his side. At Taunton he found that forces of such magnitude as to be quite irresistible were at hand to attack him, raised by the utmost efforts of Henry. Though the insurgents, now augmented to seven thousand, de- clared their determination to fight and perissi in his cause ; yet, knowing such sacrifice to be vain, he \u2022fled in the night to the sanctuary of Bewley. The revolters surrendered, and were pardoned with the exception of thtir leaders, who were hanged at Exeter. Fearing to embroil himself with the church by a violation of the sanctuary, Elcnry contrived means of prevailing on Warbeck to come forth and sur render, by a promise of life, perhaps of much more. He ws conducted into London amid the hisses and insults"], [865, "S43 Chap XXXV, 1499 *j,er*' BRITISH ILANDS. insults of a mob, who thus displayed their loyalty. These he bore with such dignified composure as be- came a royal personage. Not satisfied with his situa- tion in the hands of keepers, he escaped from con- finement, but was ib hotly pursued, that he took sanctuary in the convent of Shene in Surrey. Hence also he was drawn by promises, and reconducted to the capital. Here he is reported, by later historians, to have twice read publicly from a scaffold a con- fession of his being an impostor ; but this account appears to be false, as it is unsupported by the co- temporary writers, Polydore Virgil and Fabian. In the tower, where he was imprisoned, he formed a plan of escape, gained four of his keepers, and com- municated his design to the earl of Warwick, con- fined in the fame fortress, who agreed to become a companion of his flight. On the detection of this plan, which perhaps had originated from the king himself, if it was not quite fictitious, he was hanged at Tyburn, in the November of 1499, as guilty of conspiring to excite new troubles. On the fame charge Warwick, who, without the least imputation of guilt, had been a prisoner from early youth, was beheaded on Tower-hill a few days after. Lady. Ca- therine Gordon had been taken in Cornwall before her husoand's furrendry. Henry had entertained ap- prehensions of her being in a state of pregnancy, whence might be continued the claim of *,Varbeck.

Dnnhts concerning Warbeck. court, where ssie was well known under the name cf the white rose, given her in allusion to her husoand's pretensions, the beauty of her person, and the purity of her mind. She is said to have been in some time after married to Sir Matthew Cradock of Wales, an ancestor of the noble family of Pembroke. Who Warbeck really was is a question still unde termined, though much light has been lately thrown on the subject, particularly by IVialcolm Laing, a most acute investigator, in the third number of his appendix to the sixth volume of Henry's history of Britain, the perusal of which I earnestly recommend to curious readers. In this compendium of mine discussion cannot have place ; yet a few brief re marks may not be unacceptable. I have noticed in the beginning of the foregoing chapter the extreme ob scurity and defective nature of the historical records J of those times. The notices recorded concerning Warbeck are quite unsatisfactory, received only through the medium of his rancorous enemies, Hen ry and those writers who had strong motives of bias. That he was not the person .stated by these is evi dent. The two accounts of him publissied by royal authority, the one said to be the result of information gained by the spies, the other asserted to be the con fession of Warbeck himself, which was probably fa bricated after his execution, essentially contradict each other, and, even independently of such con tradiction, neither of them can be true. They are quire unsupported by evidence, and, beside several circumstances utterly improbable, they contain one which is justly pronounced impossible, that this pre- tender,"], [867, "BRITISH ILANBS. 345 Chap XXXV. tender, who spoke the Englissi language with its genuine accent, was a foreigner never educated in England. Laing rightly observes, that \" history furnishes no example of an impostor personating a foreign prince to impose himself as a native on a foreign nation.\" Warbeck was a youth of princely deportment, and such manners as denoted an early education in a superior class. He bore a perfect resemblance to the duke of York, so far as a person of nineteen or twenty years can resemble one of nine. He was de clared to be that prince by the dowager dutchess of Burgundy, a woman of an excellent character, who could not be supposed to wissi the success of an im postor of the hated race of Israel to the. dethrone ment of her niece, the queen of England. He was believed to be the fame by the Scottissi monarch, and by numbers of men of rank among the Englissi. Henry, who could command all the means of proof, if proof were possible, was unable to convince the public that the duke had been murdered. The story related of the murder, by Richard's order, of the two princes, contains circumstances which are proved false by the dates of authentic records. No grounds, are afforded to prevent us from conjecturing, that the elder may have remained in the oblivious gloom of a dungeon till the reign of Henry, and perissied there. This would most probably have been the fate of Warwick, if he had been found by that mo narch in secret prison in the same fortress, and the production of his person had not been rendered ne cessary by the impostor of Simnel. The younger may"], [868, "HISTORY OF THE 346 CHAP XXXV Mi.cellane, ous -rans. ftctions. 1499 1506 may have been conveyed from the tower by persons employed by his mother, perhaps amid the confu- sion and flight of the officers of that fortress on the death of Richard, and sent beyond sea in the care of a faithful domestic. When Warbeck fell into the hands of Henry, no effectual means were taken to prove him an impostor, though these were at hand, if such he had been. If he had been con- fronted with the queen dowager, whose son he pre- tended to be, or with her daughters, their examina- tion and verdict would have put the matter beyond dispute. But an apprehension that \" the emotions of nature might have disregarded the feeble injunc- tions of a tyrant,\" seems to have been the reason why so obvious a mode was not adopted. So far as I have been enabled to inquire into this subject, I can find no ground for thinking that the extraor dinary personage, nick-named Perkin Warbeck, can have been any other than the real Richard Planta genet, duke of York. By the execution of the innocent earl of War- wick, the last of the line male of the Plantagenets, the public odium was much augmented against Hen- ry. This he vainly attempted to palliate by alleg- ing, that Ferdinand, king of Spain, refused to give his daughter in marriage to the heir of England while any male of that line existed. This marriage and that of James the fourth of Scotland with Mar- garet, the eldest daughter of Flenry, were the re- mote causes of events of great importance to Britain in succeeding times. From a course of policy pur sued with at once extraordinary vigour and caution, and"], [869, "BRITISH ILANttS. 347 Chap, XXXV. and from the mutual hostilities of continental states, England remained, after the capture of Warbeck, free from both external and domestic war, notwith standing monarchal oppression and popular hatred : but the nation was afflicted, in the year 1500, by one of those pestilential disorders, to which it was in those ages liable, probably from want of cleanli ness and of preventive regulations. A malady of a species unnoticed in any other country had prevaijed in the first year of Henry's reign, and had caused the ceremony of his coronation to be sometime de ferred. In this wasteful distemper, termed the sweat ing sickness from the violent perspiration with which it was accompanied, the patient commonly either died or recovered in the space of twenty-four hours. Of his ungenerous disposition Henry gave a speci- men in his conduct toward the archduke Philip, so- vereign of the Netherlands, the democratic spirit of whose inhabitants had before obliged their mo- narch, on account of their advantages of their com- merce with England, to enter into a treaty for the expulsion of Warbeck. Philip was driven by a storm into the port of Weymouth, in the January of 1506, in a voyage to Spain, where, in right of his wife, Jo- anna, heiress of Castile, he intended to claim the ad- ministration of that kingdom. By imprudently de- barking he became virtually a prisoner in the hands of Henry, who yet treated him with all the external marks of respect, while he extorted concessions from him, one of which was very humiliating. Edmund de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, nephew to Edward the fourth, had, from discontents and apprehensions, fled from the Englissi dominions, and taken refuge in the Nether- lands. 1"], [870, "HISTORY OF THE 348 Chap XXXV Henry's administra, -ion. lands. Here, without being openly countenanced, he was protected by Philip, and betrayed by the spies of Henry in the fame manner as Warbeck had been. To the demand of the king that Suffolk ssiould be delivered into his hands, the archduke replied, \" that measure would reflect dissionour not only on me, but also on your majesty, as you will be supposed to have treated me as a prisoner.\" To this the king an swered, \" then the affair is at an end, for I will take that dissionour upon me, and thus your honour is saved.\" On the royal promise for the safety of Suffolk's life, that nobleman was surrendered, and imprisoned in the tower, where he was beheaded seven years after, in the following reign. The arch duke, after a detention of three months, was per mitted to fail, to the place of his destination. The incarceration of this baron completed the se curity of the reigning king, who, by unremitted exertions in the contrivance and execution of his schemes, had acquired over his subjects, except the clergy, a power virtually despotic. Such destruc tion in the civil wars had been sustained by the no bility, that two-thirds of the great families had been ruined, and not more than twenty-seven temporal peers, at the accession of Henry, were found in Eng land. By such debilitation of the feudal aristocracy an opportunity, not neglected, was furnissied to this monarch, of completing the depression of 'this body too powerful in former times. He employed not nobles as his confidential ministers, but clergymen, who depended for advancement wholly on his fa vour, and whose services he rewarded by benefices, without"], [871, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 346< without expenditure from the treasury. His principal Chap. confidants were John Morton and Richard Fox, ysy, whom he finally promoted through successive steps, the former to the see of Canterbury, the latter to that of Winchester. A practice begun in the reigrt of Edward the fourth, was in that of Henry con firmed by a law, which authorized the alienation of estates by breaking the ancient entails. By this, and by the growth of a more elegant luxury, the vast properties of the nobles were gradually diminissied, and those of the commons augmented. Also by this luxury, or the indulgence of a passion for splen dour in houses and modes of living, another law of this monarch in course of time became effectual ; a law against the keeping of retainers under badges or liveries like those of menial servants. Such retainers of great barons had been numerous, insisted to main tain the interests cf their several patrons, without regard to justice, by arms or even by perjury. By the statute against retainers was furnissied one Hj. exto_ among the many channels by which this avaricious prince forced money from his subjects. John de Vere, earl of Oxford, his most zealous partizan, who entertained him splendidly at his castle of Hen ningham, was obliged to pay a fine exceeding in value sixty thousand pounds at present, for having assembled, on the occasion, a body of retainers in honour of his royal guest. But this, except the ex orbitance of the sum, was among the least blameable instances of the rapacious conduct of Henry, who neglected no practicable means of extortion. The chief instruments of oppression were two lawyers, Richard"], [872, "350 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXV His death lioy Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley, equal in their disregard of humanity and justice, though unequal in manners, the latter being superior in education to the former. To particularize the various arts of these and their master would be tedious ; but we may observe that old penal statutes, rendered obsolete by circumstances, and forgotten by the public, afforded an ample field. Of breaches of these information was given by spies employed in every part of the kingdom. The persons accu- sed were imprisoned, and were generally obliged, from the pain of long confinement, to pay large sums for liberation. When a trial was granted, they were arbitrarily condemned in heavy fines, without juries or even witnesses. Juries intimidated served only to sanction the injustice of ministers. The fame was the depressed situation of even the parliament. By private extortion, by subsidies ar- bitrarily obtained, and benevolences arbitrarily le vied, Henry amassed a hoard of coin, slated at eigh- teen hundred thousand pounds of that time, equal in value to above eleven millions now, and com paratively still greater, if we consider the general poverty of European states in that age. A consciousness of his various crimes at length struck this monarch with remorse. After the death of his queen, in the February of 1503, he specula ted on treaties of marriage with princeffes on the continent, in which his main object was acquire ment of money, till he was warned of his approach ing dissolution by his health's decline. Falling into a consumption, after several fits of the gout, he was"], [873, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 351 Chap XXXV. was seized with dreadful apprehensions of a future state, and, beside some acts of mercy, had recourse to the arts of superstition to assuage his terroqrs. Thus he bequeathed in his will two thousand pounds to poor persons of various descriptions to purchase their prayers for his soul after its departure; also money for the saying of two thousand masses, at the price of sixpence each, in the space of a month after his death; and likewise additional sums to the clergy of all the cathedral, collegiate, and conventual churches in the kingdom, beside what he had be fore by contract engaged to pay them for their ini tercessions with heaven in his favour. About three weeks after the signing of his will, he expired in his palace at Richmond, on the twenty-first of April, in the Year 1509, the twenty-fourth of his reign, and fifty-fourth of his age.

Even men of deeper thought were inclined to be san guine in their hopes of a prosperous reign from cir cumstances more estimable, while they overlooked the vehemence of his temper, as a fault of unripe years, which experience might correct. To prevent his intermeddling in affairs of state, he had been, by the jealousy of his father, employed in literary pur suits, and in these had displayed a considerable de gree of talent : the union in his person of the rival claims of the Yorkist and Lancastrian families had precluded all danger of civil war arising from a competition for the throne : his kingdom enjoyed a profound peace, and he was possessed of treasure comparatively"], [875, "BRITISH ILANDS. 353 Chap, XXXVI. comparatively prodigious. The first acts of his reign tended much to confirm the favourable ex pectations entertained by his subjects Redress was promised by proclamation to those who had unjust ly suffered by obsolete statutes under the late king, and commissioners were nominated to hear the-com plainants. To punissi the instruments of oppression was found much easier than to compensate the oppressed. The principal informers, employed by Dudley and Empson, were set in the pillory, and so maltreated by the populace that they expired in prison : but these two ministers themselves, the prime agents of extortion, whose cause was ably defended by Empson, could be punissied only by a perversion of law. Screened from condemnation for their real crime by the sanction of authority, they were accused of one which was Certainly ficti tious, a treasonable plot against the present monarch ; and were, through the popular odium, found guilty without proof, and beheaded to appease the general clamour. Thus the instruments, employed by one tyrant to exercise injustice by the abuse of law, may, by another tyrant, be punissied by a like abuse. How flattering soever may be the public hope at the commencement of a reign, the prospect soon darkens from the corruption of human nature, when the monarch is young, and unschooled by ad versity. Courtiers, who, by access to his person, became acquainted with his foibles, strive to creep into his favour by encouraging him in the indul gence of his most ardent propensities, however Vol. II. A a vicious,"], [876, "HISTORY OF THE 354 Chap XXXVI. War with France. 1512 1514, vicious, to the public detriment and his own dis honour. Thus, perceiving in the king an extraor dinary passion for vain magnificence, the treasurer, Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, gained the ascen dant by promoting every plan of this nature. He even attempted to concentrate in himself the virtual exer cise of the sovereign power, by engaging his master in amusements which withdrew his attention from serious affairs. Mortified by the loss of his influence, and grieved at the useless dissipation of the public treasure, bissiop Fox introduced at court, as his assistant, a man of consummate address, the famous Thomas Woolsey, whom he supposed to be a fit per son at once for the supplanting of Surrey, and for the occupying of a station subordinate to his own. In the latter part of the scheme he was totally disap- pointed, as Woolsey so eclipsed all his competitors, that he quickly became prime favourite, and in some time an unrivaled minister, governing, at least from the year 151 5, the king, and kingdom, in a manner almost absolute, during the ten succeeding years. The king, by the death of his prudent grandmother, the countess of Richmond, soon after his accession, is supposed to have more easily been made the dupe of the selsinterested and artful, at home and abroad. In his first interference in the wars of the continent, with which his kingdom had no con cern, he was duped to a degree seldom paralleled in history. By the deep and enterprising genius of pope Julius the second a confederacy of the chief mo narchies on the European continent, called the league of"], [877, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 355 Chap XXXVI. 1512 of Cambray, had been formed for the diminution of the then formidable power of the Venetian com monwealth. When this was accomplissied, princi pally by the arms of France, the rapidity of whose progress had much exceeded his wissi, the fame am bitious pontiff contrived a plan for the expulsion of all foreign forces, and foreign dominion, out of Italy. The first part of this plan was the expul sion of the French. For this, beside the Venetians, he engaged the emperor of Germany and the king of Spain in a confederacy against the French mo narch, with whom they had been so lately combined in the league of Cambray. To draw the king of England into this combination against France was a task assigned to the crafty and perfidious Ferdinand, king of Spain, the father-in-law of Henry. The young monarch was allured by the promised glory of being declared the chief of the holy Italian league against Lewis the twelfth, against whom, from poli tical motives, the censures of the church had been fulminated ; of having the title of most christian king transferred to him from the French monarch ; and of the restoration of Guienne, and other territories in France, to the crown of England. He was also flattered with the present of a sacred rose, perfumed with musk and dipped in chrism, from Julius. With the vanity of its sovereign concurred the silly prejudices of the English nation, stupidly eager for conquests in France, contrary to the judgement of the wisest counsellors. -; In the may of 1512 ten thousand Englissi, mostly ar chers, were embarked for the northern coast of Spain, A a 2 by"], [878, "156 Chap XXXVI. HISTORY OF THE by the advice of Ferdinand, who promised to joist a Spanish army to these for the subjecting the neigh bouring province of Guienne to the command of Henry, whose interest he pretended solely to consult. Sir Edward Howard, with sixteen ssiips of war, having convoyed the transports of these troops, annoyed the French coast and commerce in his return; and reinforced by an additional squadron of twenty-five vessels, he gave battle to a French fleet of thirty nine, on the tenth of August. In the heat of the action the ssiip of the French admiral took fire and grappled with the largest vessel of the Englissi. Both were consumed : seventeen hundred men, their crews, perissied by the flames : and from the im pression of horrour, caused by this woful spectacle, the two hostile squadrons parted without further fighting. Meanwhile the marquis of Dorset, commander of the Englissi army in Spain, stationed at Fontarabia, was amused by vain promises of a junction of Span issi troops for the invasion of Guienne. These troops were treacherously employed, without offence received, or war declared, in the conquest of Na varre, a kingdom to which Ferdinand had not even any plausible pretension, but which Jay convenient to his dominions, and was in alliance with the French monarchy, on whose territories it bordered. Though the Englissi army declined a co-operation in this conquest, for which it had no orders, yet its position near the borders of France, for an irruption into which it was awaiting an opportunity, inti midated the French from sending forces for the\" protection"], [879, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 357 Chap XXXVI. 1513 protection of the invaded country. Thus, by a stroke of refined knavery, was this little kingdom sub jected to the Spanish government under which it has ever since remained: and the Englissi troops, wasted by sickness from inactivity, from ill furnissied provisions, and from improper use of wine, were sent home in December, when Ferdinand's real ob ject in bringing them was accomplished, the acquisi tion of Navarre. Though, from this finesse cf the Spanissi king, Henry might have discerned the impolicy of his join ing in this league, yet he was persuaded to make the greatest preparations in the following year against France, the invasion of which, in several quarters at once, was promised by his confederates, who had no other intention than to avail themselves of his credulity for the procuring of supplies from his revenue, and for the acquiring of territories from the French, while the forces of _ England ssiould be employed in fruitless operations. In June a formidable body of Englissi invaded France on the side of Calais. Henry, having taken the com mand in person, was joined by Maximilian, the German emperor, not, according to his engage ment, with an army, but with excuses and absurd flattery to the prince whom he was deceiving. At the daily wages of a hundred crowns he enlisted as an officer in the service of the Englissi king, whose vanity he thus gratified, and whole councils he contrived to influence to purposes of his own. A French army which advanced to relieve Te rouane from a siege was seized with an unac countable panic, on its meeting with the Eng- lish"], [880, "353 Chap XXXVI Wa- -with Scocl..n_. 1513 HISTORY OF THE lissi at Guinegate, on the nineteenth of August, and fled in disorder, leaving its general, and many other officers, in the hands of the enemy. This rout wa's called the battle of spurs, as these were the chief instruments used on that occasion by the French cavalry. Having gained possession of Terouane and Tournay, the Englissi monarch, who had filled France with alarm, and might probably have advanced to the gates of its capital, concluded the campaign with magnificent entertainments, and returned to his kingdom, with his troops, in No vember. Before his return, at the time when Tournay sur- rendered, about the end of September, he had been further elated by the important intelligence of a sig- nal defeat sustained from his forces by the Scots. Several causes of quarrel had happened, from the circumstances of their natural and political situa- tion, between the subjects of Henry and those of his brother-in-law, James the fourth of Scotland. One of these was the capture of two Scottissi vessels com- manded by Andrew Barton, who having been com- missioned by king James to make reprisals on the Portuguese for injuries received, had so abused his authority as to perpetrate acts of depredation on the Englissi commerce. Barton was slain in a fierce engagement with two ships commanded by two Howard?, the sons of lord Surrey, and his vessels were confiscated as lawful prizes. Another subject of complaint was an instance of meanness in Henry, who declined to pay the Scottish queen, his sister, \u25a0a legacy of jewels bequeathed to her by her father. But how much soever James was discontented with his"], [881, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 359 Chap XXXVI. Battle of Floddcn. Septem ber 9, 1513 his royal neighbour, he offered to make him a com plete and gratuitous remission of all offences on con dition of his abandoning the confederacy against France. This was haughtily rejected by the Englissi monarch, while the queen of France, acquainted with the romantic spirit of chivalry possessed by the king of Scotland, sent him setters in an amourous strain, with fourteen thousand crowns, and a ring from her own finger, styling him her knight, and beseeching him to advance three steps into Englissi ground for the fake of his mistress. Determined to distract, since he could not prevent, hostilities against France, James invaded England with the whole force of his dominions. While the king of Scotland wasted his time In the reduction of unimportant fortresses on the borders, and in amorous conversation with a lady named Heron, a woman of enchanting beauty, found in the castle of Ford, his soldiers, dispirited by delay, deserted in such numbers, that his army was dimi nissied from near a hundred thousand to a third of that number, when an Englissi force of near thirty thousand, collected by lord Surrey, advanced to give him battle. James took post on the hill of Flodden, the last and lowest of those eminences which extend on the northeast of the mountains of Cheviot, toward the vales of Tweed, from which river.it is distant about four miles. Surrey, having, by skilful movements, unobstructed from ignorance in his antagonist, gained a position behind the Scots, which gave him an easy access to their other wise advantageous post, led his troops without delay in"], [882, "HISTORY OF THE 360 Chap XXXVI. Peace wit); France and Scotland, 151-1 in order of battle to attack them, on the ninth of September. The Scots, by setting fire to the huts of their camp, when they hasted to oppose the ap proaching enemy, favoured the motions of the latter, as the smoke, driven between the two armies by a southern wind, intercepted the view. The adverse hosts engaged in close conflict at four in the after noon. Before night the two Scottissi wings were driven from the field, but the center, where the king fought in person, maintained its ground. Rest ing from battle during the darkness, and uncer tain of the final event,, the Englissi perceived in the morning the field abandoned completely by the foe, who, according to the most probable account, had sustained a slaughter of ten thousand men. The dead body of the king, who had fought like a com mon soldier, was found pierced with an arrow, and wounded in the head with a bill. Of the Scottissi nobles and gentry, who, from a sense of honour, had adhered to their sovereign in this fierce con test, a number unparalleled in their history were slain, twelve earls, thirteen other lords, five eldest sons of peers, fifty gentlemen of high rank and chiefs of f-imilies, beside some dignitaries of the church ; while on the side of the Englissi, whose chiefs acted only as generals hardly any gentlemen were lost. Scotland, by this mighty disaster, lay open to conquest ; but as all the naval forces of the Englissi, and most of their military, were employed against France ; and as the earl 'of Surrey, from a want of provisions, was obliged to disoand his troops; Henry, though quite eager to pussi to the utmost his advantage"], [883, "3Q1 Chap XXXVI. BRITISH ILANDS. advantage over the Scots, was able only to annoy them by wasteful incursions. By a peace with France, which was extended to Scotland, these hos tilities were terminated in the following year. Lewis the twelfth, the French monarch, whose kingdom, might have been dismembered, perhaps overrun, if all the other confederates had acted according to their engagements with Henry, found means of dis solving their league by treating separately and se cretly with the allied potentates. The Swiss, who alone had adhered to their agreement, were amused by a treaty: the poilcffion of Navarre was retained by the Spanish king : and Lewis relinquissied his Italian territories. Invaded by an army of near thirty thousand Englissi, whose name was terrible from foimer exploits, while Englissi fleets assessed their coasts, the French had been obliged to keep their forces at home, and thus to leave extraneous territories a prey to Henry's allie., who, when they had once obtained their object, deserved that mo narch in violation of a solemn compact. Kenry, who, beside the vast expences of his own fleets and armies, had given great lubsidies, particularly to Maximilian, was enraged when he discovered, that he had been made an instrument for the promotion of gain to others without any fort of advantage accruing to himself. In this disposition he listened to overtures, not only of a peace, but allo of a matri- monial alliance with France His youngest i-lier Mary, beautiful and accomplissied, was married in person at Abbeville, in the October of 1514, to Lewis, who had lost by death his former queen, Anne"], [884, "HISTORY OF THE 362 Chap XXXVI. Posterior transac tions. 15H. 1521. 4 Anne of Brittanny. The stipulated portion of the princess was four hundred thousand crowns, while the French monarch engaged to pay, in several succes sive sums, to Henry a million of crowns for all for mer debts and unadjusted claims. The matrimonial alliance between France and England was in less than three months dissolved by the death of Lewis, too far advanced in years for so young a bride. To this amiable monarch, styled by his loving subjects the father of his people, suc ceeded his son-in-law, the generous and enterprising Francis the first. The Englissi princess, the widow of Lewis, prevented by her marriage with Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, any plan which might be formed for her second nuptials with a potentate. The claims on Italian and other territories main tained by Francis, together with some other subjects of dispute, portended mighty wars on the European continent ; and, as Henry, from the circumstances of his situation, was enabled to give preponderance to either side, his favour was most assiduously court ed by the parties concerned. By the influence alone of Wolscy could this be acquired, who was known to direct all the councils of his master. On this favourite therefore, who was raised to the dignity of cardinal and legate, were pensions and benefices accumulated, to an unprecedented pitch, by rival princes, who stooped even to palpable flattery to obtain his interest. By promising to raise the cardinal to the papal throne, when it ssiould next have become vacant, the ascendancy over Francis was gained by his competitor, a young monarch whoj"], [885, "303 Chap XXXVL 1519 BRITISH ILAXDS. who, on the death of Ferdinand in 15 16, succeeded by inheritance to the monarchy of Spain, and on the death of Maximilian in 1519, to the imperial crown of Germany, by the suffrages of the German electors, under the celebrated name of Charles the fifth. Though Henry had betrayed a hostile disposition toward Francis in fruitlessly remitting great sums to Maximilian, in consequence of abortive treaties, for the expulsion of the French from the Italian terri- tories, of which they had regained possession under their new monarch, he was yet afterwards so ma- naged as to enter apparently into warm friendssiip with this gay prince, and to agree with him in the plan of a personal interview. Anxious to prevent any effects of this meeting injurious to his interest, the emperor Charles the fifth, by a preconcert with the favourite cardinal, landed at Dover, in his voyage from Spain to the Netherlands in the May of 1520, and made a visit to the king of England, who was highly gratified by such a compliment, and pro- mised to return it after his interview with Francis. In a few days after, between Guines and Ardres in Picardy, the appointed meeting took place between the French and Englissi monarchs, who laboured to outssiine each other in prodigal magnificence. Each, with his queen, was accompanied by a train of many lords and ladies, with their numerous followers, who, in like manner, so contended in expensive ostentation as to involve their estates very deeply in debt. Hardly less numerous than that of his master was the train of Wolscy, to wnose manage- ment,"], [886, "HISTORY OF THE 364 Chap XXXVI 1520, 1521 ment, by the adulatory obsequiousness of Francis, the arramrment of the whole ceremonial was con signed. Disgusted with ceremonies, which indica ted mutual diffidence, the king of France, with only three attendants, rode into the Englissi quarters, and put himself into the power of Henry, who so felt and returned the compliment, that full confi dence and a perfectly free intercourse was establissi ed. After a parade of twenty days, including twelve of tournaments, in which the two monarchs were conspicuous in beauty and address, this interview, called the field of the cloth of gold, was terminated on the twenty-third of June. Though the two monarchs, at their parting, were ardent in their professions of mutual friendssiip, Francis was far from attaining the end expected from his adulation and profuse expenditure, the fixing of the cardinal and Henry in his interest. On the tenth of the ensuing month, at Gravelines, the king of England made a visit to the emperor, who returned it at Calais, and by dexterous management completely succeeded in his attempts to gain Woiscy. After his riotous lavissiment of a treasure more enormous than that which was dissipated in like manner by Francis, and with more detriment to his people as the money was expended abroad, Henry returned home. Ed ward Stafford, duke of Buckingham, the richest and most powerful nobleman in England, had deeply incurred the cardinal's displeasure, by dddahnMf& against him as the encourager of a vainly expensive scheme of parade, ruinous to the estates of nobles and gentry. Matter of treasonable accusation was found"], [887, "BRITISH ILANDS. 365 rtI.p xxxvi Henry's second war witst France. 1522 1525, found against Stafford, particularly his weakness in listening to the predictions of a knavissi monk, who had prophesied to him that he was destined to be king of England. He seems to have afforded too much colour for his condemnation, in pursuance of which he was executed in the May of 152 1. From the classiing interests of the two great ri val potentates, whose dominions were conterminous along the southern and western boundaries of France, hostilities commenced between the emperor and she French monarch in 1521, both on the borders of Spain and of the Netherlands. According to a for mer compact among the three princes, the king of England interposed his mediation. This was accept ed by Francis, not without reluctance, as he justly suspected the offer to be insidious, calculated solely for the advantage of his antagonist. In a congress at Calais the interested Wolsey, vested by his master with the most ample powers, and acting entirely in concert with the emperor, treacherously protracted the negociation to the end of three months, to the detriment of France, without a pacific conclusion, or any design of that nature on the part of England, notwithstanding the strongest expressions of friend ssiip to Francis which language could afford. On the refusal of the French monarch to accede to the proposals of a perfidious mediator, a declaration of war, which had already commenced at sea between the subjects of the two crowns, was formally made against him, in the May of 1522., by Henry. Previ ously to this declaration the emperor, in his way from the Netherlands to Spain, had made a visit to the"], [888, "HISTORY OF THE 366 Chap XXXVI. 1522, 1523 the Englissi court, with the design of endeavouring, by new promises and additional pensions, to retain in his interest the potent cardinal, who, on an un expected vacancy in the popedom, had been lately disappointed of his promised elevation to that su preme dignity. Wolsey was completely soothed by a near prospect of the new pope's death, who was far advanced in years, and by the bounty and ad dress of Charles, who prolonged his visit to the end of six weeks. While France was assailed by the arms of Charles, who was sovereign at once of Spain, the Nether lands, and Germany, the Englissi king was, on the other side, eager in his exertions for the distress or destruction of the common foe. The earl of Sur rey, high admiral of England, also appointed admi ral of the fleets of Charles in compliment to Henry, ravaged the French coast in the July of 1522, col lecting spoil, and burning many towns, particularly the rich emporium of Morlaix. In the next month, at the head of sixteen thousand English, reinforced by Spanissi and German forces, he entered Picardy, wasted all before him except the fortified towns, and returned to Calais with a great booty. In the Sep tember of the following year, a similarly combined army, under the duke of Suffolk, advanced with devastation within eleven leagues of Paris, and re turned home in December, much diminished by hardssiips without a battle. In these two invasions, in neither of which was the conquest of any consi derable town effected by the Englissi, the French commanders acted purely on the defensive, avoiding an"], [889, "BRITISH II.ANDS. 367 an engagement against superior forces, but neglect- Chap. \u2022 \u2022 XXX V f ing no opportunity of harassing the invaders. Hen- L_ '. ry, having idly dissipated the vast wealth of his fa ther, was unable, from pecuniary defects, to put his armies in motion so early in the season, ot in such force, as he wissied. Little could be obtained from parliament by all the authority and menaces of the court, and the sums, which were extorted by forced loans and benevolence, were collected slowly. The emperor, whose dominions were vast in extent, but not every where contiguous, nor homogeneous in political constitution, nor subject to his absolute go vernment, was similarly circumstanced with respect to finance ; while the French king, his opponent, hold ing, with less limited sway, the command of a king dom, far inferior in area, but compact, uniform in polity, and populous, was enabled to act with more promptitude and vigour. Of such favourable circumstances Francis so avail ed himself as not to lose a foot of his territories in France in these campaigns, notwithstanding the tre mendous coalition against him of England, the em peror's dominions, and all the states of Italy, beside a plot of domestic treason, most dangerous, but timely detected, contrived by a prince of the blood, the duke of Bourbon. If this monarch could have been contented with the defense of his own king dom, he might have continued securely to baffle all the efforts of his enemies : but, fired with the ambi tion of re-conquering those Italian territories from which the French had been expelled, he invaded the Milanese dutchy with a formidable force, where, misled"], [890, "363 Chap XXXVI. 1525 HISTORY OF THE misled by the sycophantic advice of a favourite cour tier, he was defeated and taken prisoner, at the battle of Pavia, in the February of 1525. Henry had made no invasion on France in the preceding year. He had probably become less ardent in the emperor's cause by the influence of Wolscy, who, in his at tempts to ascend the papal throne, had met a second disappointment, on the decease of pope Adrian the sixth in 1523. Yet, on the news of this decisive overthrow and captivity of the French king, he or dered great rejoicings in England, congratulated warmly his imperial ally, and required, beside other demands, according to the treaty of coalition, that the royal prisoner ssiould be delivered into his hands, as the usurper not only of the continental provinces formerly subject to the Englissi crown, but also even of the crown of France. That the emperor had no intention of permitting the king of England to participate in the fruits of his victory was soon discovered, whatsoever may have been the real expectations or views of the latter. Contrary to the usual tenour of his crafty conduct, the former prince was so intoxicated with success, that he ceased to pay court to the Englissi cardinal or his master. Instead of writing to the king of England with his own hand as formerly, and sub scribing himself his \" loving son and cousin,\" he sent him a letter written by his secretary, with sim ply the subscription of \" Charles.\" Resentment had great influence on the haughty minds of both Wolley and his sovereign ; but, whatsoever might otherwise have been their conduct, common sense could"], [891, "BRITISH ILANDS. 369 Chap XXXVI. V_<^v-v-' Alliance with France, 1525 1529 Could now not dictate any other plan of policy than a coalition with France to prevent the emperor from becoming irresistible on the neighbouring continent, and in consequence master ultimately of England. Money besides could not be obtained for the vigor ous prosecution of any great enterprise. To com missioners appointed by royal prerogative to levy a fourth part of the goods of ecclesiastics, and a sixth of those of laymen, such opposition was made through out the kingdom, that a general rebellion was appre hended. Alarmed at such a prospect, Henry an nulled the order for arbitrary taxation, and appoint ed new commissioners for the collection of a bene volence. The people, already in a state of irrita tion, resisted these also. An insurrection in Suffolk, which might have spread farther, was suppressed by persuasion instead of force ; and these commissions were also recalled, productive of little money and much danger. Deprived of its king, its army, and its generals by the defeat at Pavia, France, with an exhausted treasury, must have fallen beneath the force of its po tent foe, if England had co-operated with vigour for that purpose. But, by the judicious and spirited ex ertions of Louise, the mother of Francis, and re gent of the kingdom in his absence, the country was in a ssiort time put, in some degree, in a state of de fence, and a treaty of peace and alliance concluded with Henry. In this, which was of a defensive na ture, the contracting parties guaranteed to each other the integrity of their dominions, to prevent the ces sion of any part of France to the emperor by its Vol. II.

Se curity was given for the payment of two millions of crowns to the king of England in stated sums, and of a hundred thousand afterwards annually during life. To Wolscy was given a bond for a hundred thousand crowns, beside twenty-nine thousand as the arrears of his pension. This treaty was signed at a royal mansion in Hertfordssiire, called the Moor, in the August of 1525. In the March of the follow ing year Francis was liberated, after a tedious im prisonment, on the subscription of his signature to a most humiliating compact, which he was secretly de termined not to execute, notwithstanding that his sons were delivered as hostages into the hands of the emperor. The war was renewed; and a league, which was termed holy as the pope was a member, and of which the Englissi monarch was declared pro tector, was formed, beside other views, for the pur pose of compelling the ambitious Charles to release his royal hostages en reasonable conditions. In Italy, the great scene of warfare, the duke of Bourbon, an exile from France, and commander of the imperial army, was killed in the storming of Rome, in the May of 1527 ; but the city was taken by his troops, and much more miserably sacked than it had ever been by the barbarous Goths. The pope was made prisoner, and detained in captivity till al most the end of that year, when he obtained his li berty by humiliating concessions and a great ran som.

But this decla ration was not followed by any vigorous hostilities on the part of England, whose sovereign, beside the well known aversion of his subjects to a state of en mity with the Flemings, was so occupied with the business of a divorce from his queen, that he will ingly assented to the proposal of a truce for eight months in the ensuing June. He had in fact not otherwise assisted France than by subsidies for the support of troops in Italy Without any stipulation in his own favour, he agreed to a treaty of general peace, which was concluded at Cambray, in the August of 1529, by two female negociators, Mar garet, the emperor's aunt, and Louise, the mother of Francis. A debt of three hundred and forty thousand crowns, due to him by Charles, was by him generously assigned to the French monarch to enable that prince to pay two millions of that coin, as the ransom of his sons, to which he was bound by this treaty, together with a renunciation of his claims in Italy, beside other conditions hardly less severe. While events of great moment, which are to be related in the following chapter, had place in Eng land, the friendlhip of Henry and Francis remained long uninterrupted. They formed a new treaty of alliance in .1532 ; and, in the October of the fame year, for the confirmation of their league, they had B b 2 a personal"], [894, "HISTORY OF THE 372 Chap XXXVI, Third war with France. 1343 1516 15U. a personal interview, with the utmost apparent, per haps with real, cordiality. Francis entertained his royal guest during four days at Boulogne, and was en tained in return during as many at Calais. But, as they coincided not in their political views, no con sequences of moment resulted from this conference ; and from a variety of causes displeasure and dissen tion gradually arose. The emperor, in his way through France from Spain to the Netherlands, so completely deceived Francis as to gain his intire con fidence, and the disclosure of secrets intrusted to him by Flenry. This disclosure was, with aggravat ing circumstances, perhaps with misrepresentation, ungenerously betrayed by Charles to the Englissi mo narch, whose resentment was thus excited against his French ally. But the chief cause of anger against his ally was the support given by him to a French interest in Scotland, by which the designs of the Englissi cabinet on that kingdom were counteracted. In this disposition the Englissi prince negociated with the emperor, and concluded with him in the Fe bruary of 1543, a treaty of offensive alliance against France. Having resumed the title of king of France, which, from complaisance to his late confederate, he had during some years omitted, Henry sent six thousand men to the assistance of the emperor in the Netherlands, where, without any act of importance, they concluded the campaign, in conjunction with the imperial troops, in the abortive siege of Lan drecy. In the plan of the second campaign the two associated monarchs engaged to advance from dif- ferent"], [895, "BRITISH ILANDS. 373 Chap XXXVI. 15\u00ab ferent quarters at once, in great force, directly to ward the French capital : but, instead of the punc tual execution of this, which must have proved ruin ous to France, they both employed their forces in the sieges of towns near the frontiers. At length however the emperor, summoning the king of Eng land to perform his part of the agreement, pressed forward with such vigour as to approach within two days march of Paris, which was filled with dreadful alarms: but, on the refusal of Henry, who was engaged in person in the siege of Bou logne, while another part of his army invested Montreuil, he commanded a retreat, and, deserting his ally, made a separate peace with Francis. The latter of these towns was defended with success, but the former surrendered, and was retained by the Englissi notwithstanding great efforts of the French for its recovery. In the third campaign Henry could act only on the defensive, attacked by all the power of France, and deprived of the assistance of fourteen thousand men, who, levied by him in Germany, were march ing to join his troops, but were denied a passage through the emperor's dominions. To divert the Englissi from the defense of Boulogne, a French ar mament of above two hundred ships approached the coast of England ; engaged, without coming to close action, an Englissi fleet in the road of Portsmouth ; and sent on ssiore, in Wight and Sussex, some bodies of troops, which had ssiirmissies with the militia, but re-embarked without the obtaining of any consi derable advantage. A second engagement, similar to"], [896, "HISTORY OF THE 374 Chap XXXVI. 1546 to the former, had place between the fleets. Mar tin du Bellay, a French writer of memoirs, has re corded, that, in a cannonade of two hours, each of these great navies fired only about three hun dred ssiots of cannon ; an instance of so clumsy a management of artillery in that age as might seem incredible in this. Negociations for the ending of a war, from which little profit could accrue to either party, at length terminated in a treaty of peace in the June of 1 546, after much opposition from the pride and resentment of the Englissi king, who re fused to restore Boulogne, though the possession of it was useless and attended with great expence. By this treaty he was allowed to retain that town during eight years, at the expiration of which two millions of crowns were to be paid to him by France. Scot land, the war with which had been desultory and indecisive, was included in the articles of pacifi cation, quite contrary to Henry's wissi, who con tended long for its exclusion.

Among these were the revival of learning in the west, by which the minds of men were roused from a stupid torpor to reflexion and inquiry ; the invention of the typogra phic art, by which the copies of writings were pro digiously multiplied, and by their cheapness diffused among all ranks of people ; the diminution in the public mind of the veneration for papal infallibility, caused by long schisms, by the deposition and elec tion of popes by general councils, and by the noto rious immorality of some pontiffs ; and a great indig nation in general excited by the simoniacal practices of the Roman court, by the exhausting drains of trea sure under various pretences to that receptacle, by the scandalous lives of ecclesiastics, and by the op pression which their power and riches enabled them to exercise over the laity. In the long schisms of the church, in the latter part of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fif teenth century, when two or three popes at once pro nounced against one another the most dreadful curses, appealed severally to secular princes for support, and were obliged to abide finally the decisions of coun cils for their confirmation or rejection, men were unintentionally led to discover that in them rested a choice whom, among a number of infallible succes sors of Saint Peter, they might select for their in fallible despot in religious concerns. The atroci ous crimes of pope Alexander the sixth about the end of the fifteenth century, and the fierce ambition and military violence of Julius the second in the be ginning of the sixteenth, raised doubts concerning the"], [899, "37T Chap XXXV II, Revival o{ literature. BRITISH ILAXDS. the existence of infallibility in such men. The trans gressions of laws both divine and human, committed by the clergy, in which they were encouraged by their exemption from the cognizance of the civil courts, were often so flagrant as to be scarcely cre dible in this age, and to have caused in those times excessive disgust among the laity, who were exposed to their injustice with little or no redress. Of the invention of printing I have spoken in my thirty-fourth chapter. Of the revival of literature in the west of Europe, where it had been extin guissied in the subversion of the Roman empire in that quarter by the Goths, a ssiort account may not perhaps be improper in this place. The Roman provinces situate eastward of Italy escaped this Gothic conquest, which I have noticed in my third chapter, and continued long to constitute an extensive and powerful monarchy under the name of the Roman, more properly of the Byzantine or Greek empire, the capital of which was Constantinople, more an ciently termed Byzantium. The fall of this empire, assailed by the Turks, while its people were ener vated by despotism and superstition, was long de layed by the discords and disasters of the Mohamme dans. Of ' the crusades of the western christians against the Turks and Saracens I have spoken in my twentieth and twenty-third chapters. In the year 1 204, persuaded by interested statesmen to turn their arms against the Greeks, christians differing from them in unimportant articles of belief or worssiip, these champions of Christ made a conquest of most part of Greece with its capital. Though in i26r, by"], [900, "e S78 Chap xxxvn HISTORY OF THE by the expulsion of the western christians, compre hended in general under the denomination of Latins or Franks, the Greeks recovered their imperial city and the adjacent region, their empire never reco vered any high degree of power, but continued to sink lower, in irregular gradation, to a state of debility. Menaced with total conquest by the Turks under the house of Ottoman the grand surviving dynasty of these mohammedan conquerors, the Greeks, whose empire was at length reduced almost within the circuit of their great commercial metropolis, implored the succour of the Latin princes. For this purpose, beside embassies, three emperors in per- son visited the regions of the west ; John Pal\u00e6ologus the first in 1369, Manuel at the end of the four- teenth century, and John Pal\u00e6ologus the second in 1438, Beside his travels through Italy, Germany, and France, Manuel made his appearance at the court of England in the year 1400. The Greek historian of these travels, Laonicus Chalcondyles, in his history of the Greeks and Turks, describes the Englissi of that age as a people eminent in mi- litary prowess, particulary in the management of the long bow ; and London as excelled by no city of the west in greatness, wealth, and luxury: but he was led into a gross error with respect to Englissi manners by his compatriot travellers, who, habituated to the Oriental ideas of female seclusion, were unable to conceive an interchange of kisses between the two sexes without an actual participation in the rights of the Cyprian goddess. His thoughts on this subject are"], [901, "BRITISH ILANDS. 379 Chap XXXVII. are thus translated by Gibbon. \" In their mutual visits, as the first act of hospitality, the guest is web corned in the embraces of their wives and daugh ters : among friends they are lent and borrowed with out shame ; nor are the ilanders offended at this strange commerce and its inevitable consequences.\" On this occasion the fame great Englissi writer has observed, that the Greek historian's \" credulity and injustice may teach us an important lesson; to distrust the accounts of foreign and remote nations, and to suspend our belief gf every tale that deviates from the laws of nature and the character of man.\" Neither the embassies of the Greek emperors, nor their personal applications, could elicite effectual aid from christian princes, discordant among them- selves, and too deeply engaged in affairs at home to be willing to embark in so distant a war : but the intercourse thus occasioned was propitious to reviving literature in the~ western countries. \" In their lowest servitude and oppression,\" says Gibbon, \" the subjects of the Byzantine throne were still possessed qf a golden key that could un- lock the treasures of antiquity ; of a musical and pro- lific lauguage, that gives a soul to the objects of sense, and a body to the abstractions of philosophy.\" Together with this key they possessed also the trea- sure, reposited in the libraries of their splendid em- porium ; and notwithstanding the wretched igno- rance in general prevalent from the two chief causes of human degeneracy already specified, some Greeks were still found not unacquainted with these inesti mable relicks. Fortunately a knowledge of the la- tin,"], [902, "3S0 Chap XXXVII. HISTORY OF THE tin, how corrupted soever, was preserved in the wes tern parts of Europe, where, under the spiritual dominion of the Roman pontiff, the service of the church was performed in that language, whence the people of these regions were denominated Latins, in contradistinction to the christians of the east. Among the Latins, where they emerged from the slavery of the feudal system, a spirit of inquiry arose, and gained strength in proportion to their political improvement. Conspicuously foremost in this pro gress were the Italians, whose towns had acquired freedom, and whose rival commonwealths had risen by extensive commerce into opulence and power. If the visits of Greek scholars, and their final flight to Italy on the. extinction of their empire in 1453, by the Turkissi conquest of Constantinople, had happened at an earlier and more barbarous age, before the Italians were prepared for the reception of the precious gifts by a previous foundation of mental culture, the knowledge of Grecian literature might have irrecoverably perissied. Petrarch, the eloquent Italian, who diedin 1374 at the age of seven ty, was the greatest revives of learning among his compatriots ; but, though he procured some of the noblest compositions in the Greek, he was unable, from want of instructors, to acquire a sufficient knowlege of the language for the enjoyment of their beauties. His friend Boccacio, a famous wri ter of modern Italian, styled the father of the Tus can prose, was more fortunate in this respect, taught to translate the Grecian writings by Leo Pilatus, whom he met at Florence in 1360. In this fame city,"], [903, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 3SU city, the head of a republic which was enriched by Chap. commerce, and which became a prolific nur- ,^__^ fery of Greek and Roman literature, two learn ed professors, Manuel Chrysolorus and John of Ra venna, establissied schools at the end of the four teenth century, the former for the expounding of the Grecian, the latter for that of the Latin classics. Here in the fifteenth century, Cosmo de Medicis, an illustrious merchant, who, by the influence of his wealth and popular virtues, governed almost abso lutely this democratic state, applied a considerable part of his revenue to the promotion of literature, and his example was followed by his grandson Lorenzo. A most eminent benefactor of mankind in this line of conduct was also the amiable pope Nicholas the fifth, who expended great sums in the rewarding of literary merit and the collecting of manuscripts. In a reign of eight years, which, ended in 1455, he furnissied a library of five thou sand volumes. From a consciousness of their own superiority, the Italians denominated all the rest of the Euro peans, in comparison of themselves, barbarians, a term which the Greeks, before the downfall of their empire, had applied to the inhabitants of all the western regions including Italy. But the know ledge acquired by transalpine students in the schools of this renowned peninsula, which was destined a second time to receive and transfuse the literature of Greece, was disseminated in France, Germany, and England, whose natives emulated, and at length surpassed, their Italian masters. Near the close of the"], [904, "HISTORY OF THE 382 Chap XXXVII. the fifteenth century the Greek language was in* troduced into the university of Oxford by Grocyn, Linacre, and La-imer, who had learned it at Flo rence. To the study of this language in this uni versity the enemies of improvement, who are nu* merous in all times in proportion to the general ignorance and bigotry, made a furious opposition* particularly by riots and personal assaults. They styled themselves Trojans, and assailed the Greek students wherever they met them, with verbal or corporal outrage. When, by the resolute perseve rence of the friends of true literature, encouraged by the protection of cardinal Wolsey, this barbarous hostility was overcome, and the. cultivation of Greek letters became fashionable, a new dispute arose con cerning their pronunciation. In the ages of their degeneracy the Greeks had lost the knowledge, not of the sense or meaning, but of great part of the beauties, of the unparal leled language of their ancient ancestors. \" Of the power of the Greek accents they were igno rant,\" fays Gibbon; \" and those musical notes, which from an attic tongue, and to an attic ear, must have been the secret soul of harmonv, were to their eyes, as to our own, no more than mute and unmeaning marks, in prose superfluous, and trou blesome in verse.\" This perhaps, as an inevitable misfortune, may be excused ; but the variety and musical sweetness of the Greek was barbarously destroyed by the pronouncing of three of the vow els and several diphthongs all with the fame sound. Some eminent scholars, particularly the great Eras- mus,"], [905, "5*3 Chap, XXXVII. BRITISH ILANDS\". mus, a Dutchman who resided several years in England, endeavoured by solid arguments to correct this vicious pronunciation introduced by the first teachers. In anf.ver to these arguments a fu rious decree was issued by Stephen Gardiner, bissiop of Winchester and chancellor of Oxford, denoun cing the severest censures against all who ssiould presume to adopt the correct, or as he considered it, the new, mode of pronouncing the Greek tongue. But such force had the spirit of inquiry, or reason, already acquired, that in defiance of this fulmina tion, the correction was in a ssiort time universally admitted. The barbarous corruption of the Greek may in some degree be elucidated by a similar cor ruption of the Englissi by many at present in Ireland, who, from affectation and ignorance, confound the vowels a and e and the diphthong ai, giving them all the sound of ee, pronouncing, for instance, table and chain, as if they were written teeble and cheen, in contradiction to common sense, and the establissied custom of England. While the taste was refined, and the genius ele vated by a familiar intercourse with the Greek and Roman classics, \" those immortal men who spoke the sublime language of eloquence and reason,\" the absurd metaphysical works of the writers denomina ted schoolmen sell into contempt.

Commence ment ot the reformation dition, exposing to public indignation and ridicule the ignorance and vices of the clergy, together with the absurdity of many doctrines and practices of the church. The chief of all these writers in force of argument and satyric wit was Erasmus, whose elegant compositions, universally admired and wide ly dispersed, served as the feeds of religious refor mation, which were afterwards fostered to a state of maturity, beyond his design and that of several other encouragers of learning, by rude and fearless preachers, who openly assailed the papal authority. Even these rude preachers had the advantage of su perior knowledge over illiterate monks, the advo cates of ignorance ; beside that a few of the refor mers were men of elegant erudition. In my thirty-first chapter I have given an account of the Paulicians, a reformed sect, suppressed by power, yet still remaining latent in western Eu rope ; also of Wicklisse and the Lollards. The doctrines of Wicklisse were disseminated in Bohe mia by some divines, particularly by John Hufs and Jerome of Prague. Great numbers in that quarter were drawn from the Romissi communion. In consequence of persecution these rose in arms, and under the conduct of the celebrated Zisca, gave repeated overthrows to the forces of the German emperor. Nor, even after the death of this dreaded leader in 1424, were they so completely reduced as to have no indulgence conceded to their scruples.

In the following century, from the causes al ready mentioned, the state of affairs was much more auspicious for religious reformation. In Germany, where these causes, particularly the disgust of papal oppression, had the greatest force, a new champion appeared, whose energetic labours and invincible boldness were crowned with a success unexpected and surprising. This was Martin Luther, a native of Eifleben in Saxony, a friar of the Augustinian order, professor of theology in the university of Wit temberg, studious and very learned for the times, but barbarous in his stile, and of a fierce, impetuous, and arrogant spirit. Wanting money for the completion of the vast and splendid fabric of Saint Peter's church in Rome, for donations to men of genius, and for other pur poses, the liberal and magnificent pope Leo the tenth publissied a sale of indulgences, pardons for sins however great purchascable by sums so small as not to be beyond the reach of the poorest classes. The dominican friars, to whom the sale was com mitted in Saxony, were successful in collecting, but scandalous in their conduct. The nobles were in dignant at the draining of wealth in this manner from their estates. The pious were grieved at the delusion of the vulgar, who were taught to depend for salvation neither on faith nor good morals, but on pecuniary purchases. By such malcontents the harangues and publications of Luther were favour ably received, when, in 15 17, he began to call in question the efficacy of indulgences, and to inveigh against the vices of those who vended them. By an Vol. II. C c early"], [908, "3S6 Chap XXXVII. HISTORY OF THE early exertion of the papal power Leo might have crussied at once this daring polemic in the com mencement of his career ; or, by affecting to take no notice of his procedure, might have suffered the controversy concerning indulgences to be agi tated as a metaphysical question, without detriment to the church. But his measures were such as to exasperate, without subduing, his opponents. Luther at first had not the least intention of dis puting the divine authority of the sovereign pontiff, of which he then entertained no sort of doubt : but, when he was peremptorily commanded to make a simple recantation of the opinions which he had successfully maintained from reason and scripture on the subject in question, he declined to obey. Con vinced, from the proceedings of the Roman court, that safety was impossible in any middle course be tween a disgraceful retraction and open defiance, he was led by degrees to adopt the latter, and to carry his opposition to extremity. By his vigorous and decisive conduct his party rose in Germany to such a pitch of strength, that when a bull of ex communication was at length fulminated against him in 1520, it proved harmless to his cause. He publickly burned the bull with great solemnity at Wittemberg, and the example was followed in se veral other cities. The number of his German proselytes continued to encrease. When a diet of the empire, assembled at Spires in 1529, issued a decree unfavourable to them, by the influence of the emperor Charles the fifth, these entered a solemn protest against it. Thence they received the appel- lation"], [909, "BRITISH ILANBS. 3S7 lation of Protestants; \" an appellation,\" says Ro- Chap. bertson, \" which has since became better known ' 'V j and more honourable, by its being applied indis criminately to all the sects of whatever denomination which have revolted from the Roman see.\" The clergy of England, during great part of the state of . r tt \u2022 i i \u2022 \u2022 religion in reign or Henry the eighth, continued, with their England. monarch, most firmly attached to the church of ]5og Rome. Among the laity ihe general causes predis- 1528. posing to reformation had place, beside the odium excited against the clerical orders by a horrible persecution of Lollards, of 'whom a considerable number still remained in this country. Among the instances of ecclesiastical tyranny was the treatment of Richard Hunne, a respectable citizen of Lon don, in 1 514. He was sued in the legate's court, by a priest, for the mortuary of a child, buried at the age of five weeks. In return, he prosecuted the priest in the court of king's bench, in a premunire, for carrying a suit to a foreign tribunal. To ex tricate their member the clergy charged Hunne with heretical opinions, and sent him to the Lol lards' prison, where he was soon found dead, and placed in such an attitude as if he had hanged him self. After his death, in a foam trial, in which no person dared to plead in his favour, he was pronoun ced guilty ; and his corpse, when it had lain ten days in the grave, was committed to the -flames. That he had been murdered by doctor Horsey, chan cellor to the bissiop of London, was clearly disco vered. Such however was the power of the clergy that the murderer could not be brought to justice. C c 2 A com-"], [910, "5SS Chap XXXVII. HISTORY OF THE A compromise was made between them and the king. Appearing at the bar in the court of king's bench, Horsey denied the charge, and his plea, to prevent a trial, was admitted by the attorney ge neral. On the other hand the clergy desisted from their proceedings against doctor Standissi, who had incurred their hatred by daring to plead against the total exemption of clerical persons from the civil authority. Henry was a warm adherent of the Roman church. He admired the writings of Thomas Aqui nas, a celebrated schoolman, treated by Luther with contempt. Doubly provoked, he wrote a book against this reformer concerning the seven sacra ments. Its language was latin, and the style and matter displayed no despicable specimen of his learn ing and abilities. In 1521 it was formally presented in full consistory to the pope, who pronounced on it the highest eulogies in a strain quite extravagant, and conferred on the royal author, and his succes sors on the throne, the title of Defender of the faith. Irritated by some contemptuous expressions in this book, Luther pubissied an accrimonious reply, claim ing, in his own phrase, \" a right to bespatter his Englissi majesty with mire, and to trample the crown of this blasphemer against Christ under his feet.\" The appearance of a royal polemic rendered the controversy more famous. Curiosity was more ex cited, and, in consequence of inquiry, the number of apostates from Rome was encreased. Repenting of his asperity on cool reflection, Luther sent an apology to the king in 1525: but the resentment os"], [911, "38P Chap XXXVH. Suit of Henry for a divorce. \u00ab/'l527. 1529.

Vengeance was denounced against all who ssiould dare to read his works, and many were burned alive for adopting his opinions. Persecu tion continued throughout the reign of Henry, who remained all his life inflexibly attached to the cere monies of the Roman church ; but he was led by uncommon circumstances to become in his latter days a most determined opponent of the papal power. Prince Arthur, the elder brother of Henry, had been married in 1501 to the princess Catherine, the third daughter of Ferdinand king of Spain., Oa_ the death of Arthur in the following year, Henry, the only surviving son of Henry the seventh, be- came heir to the crown. From political motives this prince was contracted in 1503, under the pope's dispensation, to Catherine, his brother's widow, though ssie exceeded him in age by six years, had cohabited five months with her former husoand, and was some time suspected, but erroneously, of being in a pregnant state. On account of his youth, as he was then hardly twelve years old, the actual mar- riage was deferred. Immediately on his arrival at the age of fourteen he protested against the con- tract. Yet, on his accession to the throne in 1509, yielding to the prudential reasons of his council, he completed the marriage. About fifteen years after, when the beauty of his queen faded, and her infirm constitution afforded no hopes of male issue, he"], [912, "390 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXVII. he felt much disquietude. He doubted concern ing the legality of his marriage, and feared to leave behind him a disputable succession. He even took the pains of writing a book to prove, that \" the martiage of a man with the widow of his brother was contrary to the laws of God, and that the pope had not the p wjer of dispensing with these laws.\" Of the latter proposi ion, explicitly asserted by Thomas Aquinas, he was fully convinced. His desire of a divorce was in 1527 rendered much more ardent by his passion for Anne Boleyn, a young woman of great beauty, and engaging manners, who returning then to England, after a residence of twelve years in the French court, was appointed to a place among the maids of honour. Catherine refused positively to consent to a di- vorce, and inflexibly adhered to that determination to the end of her life, which was closed at Kimbol- ton in 1536. To obtain it from the pope an em- bassy was sent in the July of 1527. Every possible exertion was made by arguments, entreaties and money. The reigning pontiff, Clement the seventh, had seen the miserable sack of Rome by the imperial troops, and had himself been detained six months in prison. He wisoed much to gratify the Englissi monarch, who had used both his sword and pen in the defense of the holy see : but he dreaded the emperor Charles, whose power he had so severely felt, the nephew of Catherine, arid at that time the foe of Henry. To amuse the king with vain hopes, without incurring the resentment of the emperor, he adopted a plan of the deepest duplicity. Fie granted"], [913, "391 BRITISH ILANDS. Chap XXXVII. V granted a commission for the hearing and determin ing of the cause in England, together with a dis pensation for the king's marriage with another lady. But both of these, when brought to London, were found so defective that to proceed on them was thought dangerous. A second embassy was sent to Rome in the Fe bruary of the following year. As the armies of France then allied with England, were become in Italy so superior to those of Charles as to threat en their expulsion, Clement made concessions which raised the hopes of his petitioner to the highest pitch. He granted a commission to two cardinals, Wolsey and Campegius, legates a latere, with the most ample powers, to judge and determine the affair in England ; a solemn policitation that he never would revoke this commission, nor avocate the cause to Rome; and a decretal bull, which an nulled the king's marriage with Catherine, and per mitted him to take any other for a wise. Campe gius, to whose custody the bull was intrusted, con trived such delays that he arrived not in England before October. He ssiewed it in private to the king and Wolsey, but could not be persuaded, by any means whatsoever, to part with it for a moment, or to suffer it to be seen by any other person. The most earnest solicitations were made in vain to the pope by Henry's agents in Rome to order its pro duction. The imperialists had again become superior in Italy, and Clement was secretly negotiating a separate treaty with the emperor. To maintain the delusion he sent his prothonotary Gambara into England"], [914, "392 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXVIt. England with professions of the utmost gratitude to the king, and of his resolution to gratify him in the amplest manner ; yet the main object of Gambara's mission was to see the decretal bull destroyed secret ly by the flames, for the prevention of offense to Charles, whose favour or enmity the pontiff con sidered as of chief importance. In another solemn embassy to Rome the Englissi agents were fully convinced of the pope's determi nation to amuse the king only with vain professions. At the instance of Henry, who now despaired of the bull, the legates proceeded to trial in the summer of 1529. The queen appeared before them on the eighteenth of June, and protested against their juris diction. They entered notwithstanding into the examination of the affair. The consummation of Arthur's marriage was proved as fully as could be expected in such a case. But, on the thirtieth of July, when the sentence of divorce was expected to be pronounced, Campegius, to the utter sur prise of a crowded audience, declared the court to be adjourned to the first of October. In the mean time Clement, who had brought his treaty with the emperor to a conclusion, suspended the commis sion of the two cardinals, and, by the avocation of the cause to his own court in Rome, to which the queen had appealed, put an end to the hopes of Henry. Acting under the secret orders of the sovereign pontiff, Campegius had received repeated presents from the king, had listened to his still greater promises, had expressed the most ardent wissies for his service, but, had all along betrayed him."], [915, "BR1TICH ILANDS. 393 him. He had even contrived to pilfer from the Chap. royal cabinet some letters which had passed between Henry and Anne Boleyn. These were sent to Rome and still remain in the papal archives. The rage of the disappointed monarch, labouring for a vent, was, at the instigation of Wolsey's foes, discharged on that minister, who had given way to Campegius in the proceedings of the trial, but appears to have earnestly endeavoured to obtain the divorce. Thomas Wolsey, the son of a butcher in Ipswich, Fall of had been brought as tutor into the family of the \u00b0 sey' b 3 1529. marquis of Dorset, and had thence been recom- 1530. mended as chaplain to Henry the seventh. In a se cret embassy, in which he was employed by that monarch, he displayed such diligence and dexterity as establissied his character. Of his introduction to Henry the eighth I have spoken in the preceding chapter. By talents hardly paralleled of insinua tion and address, together with the most steady per severence, activity, and the deepest cunning, he acquired and long maintained, such an influence over this prince, one of the most capricious and impe tuous characterized by history, as to exercise virtu ally the government of England. On this account his favour was courted by foreign potentates, with amazing assiduity, by presents, pensions, and sub missive adulation. He was vested with the digni ties of archbissiop of York, cardinal and legate. From the union of several sees, which he was per mitted to hold, and from various other channels, he received a revenue, nearly, if not altogether, equal to that of his master. Fully adequate to this was the magnificence"], [916, "394 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXVII. magnificence of his houssiold, and the splendour with which he dazzled the vulgar eye when he ap peared in public. Though his wealth, his power at home, and his influence abroad, exceeded what has ever been acquired by the exertions of any other British subject, his abilities were only of the super ficial kind. His letters exhibit the declamation of a pedant, and his political conduct weakness and want of principle. He was haughty, ostentatious in the extreme, immoral in private life, but a gene rous encourager of learning. In some days after the failure of his suit, Flenry received a visit from the two legates at Grafton without expressions of resentment: but on the next morning Wolsey, instead of being admitted to the royal presence, was ordered to accompany Campe gius to London. After this he was never seen by the king. In October he was deprived of the great seal, and commanded to retire from his palace in Westminster. This, now named Whitehall, toge ther with the value of above half a million of our money in plate and other furniture, was seized for the king's use. To an indictment against him in the court of king's bench, in a prcemunire, for his having procured the commission of legate a latere from the pope, he pleaded guilty, though he might have produced the king's letters patent authorizing him to accept that commission. Fie seems to have been led to this submissive conduct by the hopes of reconciliation with his sovereign. He had on his way to Assiur, another episcopal mansion, received a message from Henry, together with a ring, as a token"], [917, "BRITISH ILANDS. 395 Chap XXXVIt. \u25a0r^Y^J token of credence, assuring him that he stood as high as ever heretofore in the royal favour. Forget ful of his age and dignity in an ecstasy of joy, he had thrown himself from his mule, and kneeling in the mire, had uttered some extravagant ejaculations of gratitude. Vv'hat was Henry's real motive for this And other favourable messages afterwards, all of which proved .ultimately vain, cannot now be discovered. The court of king's bench pronounced his pro perty forfeited and his person seizable. When the king had gained possession of all his property, he granted him a pardon in the most ample form in the February of 1530, with a yearly pension of a thou sand marks, a present of above six thousand pounds in money and plate, and leave to retain his see of York with all its adjuncts. But from Richmond, where he earnestly wissied to fix his residence, he was com manded to retire into his archiepiscopal see. As he had fixed his whole attention on royal favour, with the wealth and power thence acquirable, as the sole foundations of happiness, his dejection on the loss of these, as is seen in his letters, was so great that he seemed without resource. Yet at his castle of Cawood in Yorkssiire, in the repairing of which he ssiewed a fondness of splendour above his remaining revenue, he behaved witn a condescension and hos pitality which rendered him very popular. At the unanimous request of his clergy he consented to be installed in his c.thedral, and preparations were made for a magnificent feast on the occasion : but he was arrested three days before the appointed time, as a person"], [918, "398 CHAP XXXVII v__^v^/ New dis- eases, HISTORY OF THE a person charged with high treason, and conducted toward the capital. He was in the journey seized with sickness. On his arrival at the abbey of Lei cester he told the monks that he was come to lay his bones among them. On his death-bed there he said, among other things, to Kingston, constable of the tower, \" if I had served God as diligently as 1 have served the king, he would not have forsaken me in my gray hairs.\" He died on the twenty-ninth of November in the year 1530, the sixtieth of his age. In an accusation brought into parliament against Wolsey, in the November of 1529, a part of the charge is, that, \" bearing in his blood the contagi ous distemper of the lues venerea, he had know ingly endangered the king's health by approaching his person, and whispering in his ear.\" We may observe in .his place that this distemper, the most terrible scourge of criminal indulgence, was un known in Europe before the year 1493, when it was carried into Spain from the Hands of America by the discoverers of those regions. By Spanissi troops it was brought to Naples, and thence by French to France. In 1497 we find its appearance in Scot land. It had in four years rapidly spread through most European countries. Physicians at first stood aghast, unable to devise a remedy for a new and most malignant species of infection, the operation of which was frightfully violent, swift, and fatal. The inter ference of the civil magistrate was thought necessary. Infected persons were segregated, and sent into small Hands or secluded spots, to prevent as far as possible the spreading"], [919, "BRITISH ILANDS. 397 Chap. XXXVII. spreading of the pestilence. Thus the unhappy pa tients of Edinburg were sequestered in Inch-Keith, a verdant ile, a mile in length, in the frith of Forth. Medicines for the purpose were gradually discovered, and the virulence of the malady seems to have much decreased. To the Americans, in return for this infection, the small pox, received from Asia nearly about the same time, was communicated by the Eu ropeans. Both plagues, like the leprosy, are hoped to become extinct in a future age in Europe. CHAP."], [920, "399 Chap XXXVIII Prosecution of Henrj's divorce. 1529 1533 HISTORY OF THE CHAPTER XXXVIII.

Doctor Thomas Cranmer, a fellow of Jesus' college in Cambridge, gave casually his opinion in a conversation with two courtiers, that, instead of fruitlessly persisting in solicitations at the papal court, the question might be submitted to the judgment of the chief universities and most learned men in Eu rope. If in their answers the marriage, as he ex pected, ssiould be pronounced illegal, the pope could hardly venture to give a contrary sentence. This plan was immediately adopted by the king, who de clared in a vulgar phrase, not then unusual even at court, that '\u25a0* Cranmer had got the right sow by the ear.\" Much pleased with the appearance and con- versation"], [921, "BRITISH ILANDS. 399 Chap XXXVII-. versation of the doctor, who was summoned to his presence on this occasion, he retained him in his service, and employed him to write a book on the subject of the marriage. The agents of Henry, by strenuous exertions and considerable expenditure, procured the decrees of the most famous universities, ten in number, together with the written opinions of eminent men, doctors of civil and canon law, with also several books publissied on the question. As all these agreed in declaring the marriage illegal, application was once more made to the sovereign pontiff with stronger hopes. In the July of 1530 a most pathetic address, signed by many prelates, nobles, and other persons of distinction, was transmitted to the Roman court. Cranmer, an ambassador on this occasion, challenged all the members of that court to a disputation on the subject : but this they declined. The answer of Cle ment was artful, smooth and evasive. Despairing finally of success in that quarter, the king laid the affair before his parliament, appealed to the judg- ment of his people, and took measures for the de pression of the clergy, and the diminution of the papal influence in his kingdom. He affected to con sider all the clergy of England as involved in a pre munire for having submitted to Wolsey's legatine commission contrary to an obsolete law called the statute of provisors. Though they were manifestly blameless in having yielded to an irresistible power, yet, thinking opposition altogether fruitless, they agreed to pay a fine of a hundred and eighteen thou sand pounds, equivalent to about seven hundred thousand"], [922, "HISTORY OF THE 400 Chap XXXVtil. His quarrel with the pope 1533 1538 thousand of our money now. The parliament by an act in 1532 empowered the king to stop the pay ment of the first fruits of all the sees in England to the pope. At length in the November of 1532, when he thought the public mind and the state of affairs pre disposed for the event, the king was privately mar ried to Ann Boleyn, whom he had previously created marchioness of Pembroke. For the final determina tion of Catherine's marriage, Cranmer, who had become archbissiop of Canterbury, opened a court at Dunstable in the following May, accompanied by a number of prelates, and men versed in the studies of divine and canon law. Refusing to appear, Cathe rine was pronounced contumacious. After a very formal and solemn examination, the court unani mously declared her divorced, and her marriage null from the beginning. In a court held at Lambeth on the twenty-eighth of that month, Cranmer pro nounced the king's marriage with the marchioness to be completely valid ; and that lady was crowned in four days after with pompous solemnity. Though the Roman court was enraged against the king and primate for having dared to proceed to the decision of a cause which was depending by appeal before the tribunal of the sovereign pontiff, yet Cle ment, from prudential motives, particularly a fear of disobliging the French monarch, took at first no severer step than to annul the sentence of divorce, and to menace Henry with excommunication if he ssiould not have restored the former state of affairs before the ensuing September. The king appealed to"], [923, "BRITISH ILANDS. 401 Chap. XXXVIII. to the next general council. The appeal was read by doctor Bonner in the pontiff's presence in the November of 1533. This was rejected by Clement, who declared it illegal. By the earnest mediation of the king of France an agreement was made between the pope and Henry, that the latter ssiould submit his cause to the tribunal of the former on the pre vious assurance of a sentence in his favour. A day was nominated by the pontiff, on or before which a proxy ssiould appear for the Englissi king, and pro duce his consent in writing to submit to judgment. The day appointed was too early. The cardinals of the imperial faction prevailed by their vehemence, when no messenger appeared from England, to have a final sentence pronounced confirming the validity of Catherine's marriage. Two days after, on the twenty-fifth of March in the year 1534, the Englissi courier arrived with documents quite satisfactory. Clement repented of his precipitate conduct ; but the error was irreparable. To reverse his own de cree, delivered with so great solemnity, and made so public, no plausible pretext could be found. Henry was not unprepared for this decision, though it appears to have been quite unexpected. To se cure himself against the papal power he had taken successive steps, in which he found his parliament eagerly to concur, and even the convocation of clergy to acquiesce. In a parliamentary session, which com menced in the January of 1534, several acts to this purpose were passed. All appeals to Rome, and all payments into the apostolic chamber of first fruits, of Peter's pence, and of money for dispensations and Vol. If. D d other"], [924, "\u2022102 Chap. XXXVIII. Executions. 1531. 1535 HISTORY OF THE other writings, were prohibited. Regulations were enacted for the choosing and consecrating of prelates without papal authority. The divorce of Catherine and the marriage of Ann were confirmed, and the succession to the crown settled to the exclusion of the former's offspring. In another session, in the No vember of the fame year, when the breach with the pope had become irreparable, the separation of Eng land from the church and court of Rome was com pleted. The king was declared the only supreme head on earth of the -Englissi church, and pn him were conferred the first fruits and tenths of the ec clesiastical benefices formerly payable to the Reman pontiff. The news of these and of some other trans actions excited a violent rage in the papal consistory. The most opprobrious appellations were copiously bestowed on the Englissi monarch, who would doubt less have been canonized if he had happened to die soon after the publication of his book against Lu ther. Bulls were prepared in which he was excom municated, his soul delivered to satan, his subjects absolved from their allegiance, and his dominions given to the first who ssiould conquer them. But these bulls, as no temporal power could be found to enforce them, were not publissied till the year 1538, and even then were without efficacy. Meanwhile some executions had place in England in consequence of non-compliance with the antipapal measures of Henry. By the contrivance of some ecclesiastics, Elizabeth Barton, called the holy maid of Kent, had acquired among the vulgar the reputa tion of a prophetess. She affected frequently to fall into"], [925, "BRITISH ILANDS. 403 Chap XXXVIII. into a trance, and to utter predictions from the in spiration of the Holy Ghost. These, denouncing the vengeance of heaven against all who ssiould dis obey the pope and clergy, were publissied in a book by a monk named Deering. One of her prophesies was, that, if Henry ssiould divorce queen Catherine, and take another wife, he ssiould not be a king a month longer, and must suffer a villain's death. The imposture was privately encouraged by persons of rank in the Roman interest. The king was alarmed. The prophetess and her chief accomplices were arrested. The affair was laid before the parliament in 1544. Six ecclesiastics, with their deluded female, were un der a sentence of high treason capitally punissied. Some others, among whom was Fissier, bissiop of Rochester, were condemned to imprisonment, with confiscation of property, for misprision of treason in having connived at the fallacious procedure. Fissier was high in the estimation of the public for virtue, piety, and learning. So was also Sir Thomas More, who was, besides, very pleasing by his facetious humour. Both were devoted to the Roman see, and had been led by the prevailing tem per of the times to be very cruel persecutors of those who admitted the doctrines of reformation. More had been appointed lord chancellor on the resigna tion of Wolsey ; but he had resigned in 1532, on perceiving the approach of a quarrel between his temporal and spiritual sovereigns. When all wert required to take an oath of obedience to the act by which the succession to the crown was settled, Fissier and More refused, as this oath implied an approba tion of Catherine's divorce. For this they were at- D d 2 tainted"], [926, "40. Chap XXXVIII Dissolution of the mo nasteries. 1536 1540 HISTORY OF THE tainted as guilty of misprision of treason in the latter part of the year 1534. In prison they were en trapped by insidious conversation into expressions which indicated their disapprobation of the title as sumed by the king of supreme head of the church. To dispute any of the royal titles had been declared high treason by parliament. The Roman pontiff created Fissier a cardinal, hoping that Henry would be awed by a dignity so sacred. But both he and More were condemned and beheaded in the summer of 1535. The latter retained his pleasantry even in his last moments. Beside other sallies of humour, he said to the executioner, \" you will get no credit by beheading me, my neck is so ssiort.\" Regarding the monks as his determined enemies from their attachment to the pope, Henry resolved on the destruction of their convents, by the spoils of which he might at the fame time be enriched. For this purpose, in virtue of his ecclesiastical su premacy, he appointed his secretary, Thomas Crom wel, to act as his vicar-general or vicegerent. By visitors commissioned by Cromwel, and sent into all parts of the kingdom, a report was made very unfa vourable to the morals in general of the monastics, though some were found blameless. This report was laid before parliament in the April of 1536, and an act was passed for the ratification of all the furren dries made of religious houses by their superiors to the crown, and for the dissolution of all monasteries of males or females, which possessed not each above two hundred pounds of annual revenue, and con tained not each above twelve members. The num- ber"], [927, "403 Chap XXXVIII. Insurrec tions. 1536 1537 BRITISH ILANDS. ber of houses dissolved by this act was three hundred and seventy-six. Their inhabitants were removed into the greater monasteries. The news of another visitation, appointed in iS37, struck the monks with such terror, that, to prevent exposure, and to pro cure better treatment and better pensions, many of them resigned their possessions under various pre texts. In the havoc made of monastic edifices on this accasion many libraries perished, and many va luable books were lost. By an act of parliament in the May of 1540, the lands and goods of all religi ous houses were vested in the crown. Thus were suppressed in the whole amount six hundred and for ty-five convents, ninety colleges, two thousand three hundred and seventy-four chantries and free chapels, and a hundred and ten hospitals. The annual sum of the rents of their lands was estimated at a hun dred and sixty thousand pounds, near a million in value of our money now. These rents were very low, as fines were paid when leases were taken. The plate, the jewels, and various furniture were worth a vast sum of which no computation can now be made. Alarming insurrections had meanwhile taken place. The common people were enraged by the dissolution of the smaller monasteries, and by apprehensions of the fame destiny for all which remained. The sacri lege was rendered more ssiocking by the indecent violence and rapacity of agents employed in the sup pression. Discontent reached even the higher orders, particularly those men whose vanity was interested in the preservation of establissiments founded by their"], [928, "HISTORY OF THE 406 Chap XXXVIU, their ancestors. Irritated by some innovations, by which their revenues were affected, the secular priests also inflamed by their discourses the general disaffec tion. A body of twenty thousand under arms i-i Lincolnssiire, in the September of 1536, sent are monstrance to the king. In his answer he com manded them to surrender their leaders and to dis perse. By the mediation of nobles and gentry the busir. :ss was terminated without bloodssied. On the publication of a general pardon the insurgents re turned to their several homes. The dispersion of this host was very seasonable for government, as a much more formidable insurrec- tion had been excited in Yorkssiire. Forty thousand men, denominating their enterprise the pilgrimage of grace, marched with standards representing the five wounds of Christ, preceded by priests in the habits of their order with crucifixes displayed. While a flood in the river Don separated the rebels from the royal forces which had advanced against them (to Doncaster, the duke of Norfolk, the king's lieut- nant, proposed a treaty. After a negociation art 'fully protracted to December by the court, in the course of which many of the armed pilgrims from hardssiip deserted their standards, the insurgents dis- banded on receiving a general pardon, and a promise that the next parliament ssiould be held in their country. Quiet seemed restored in the north ; yet, in the beginning of the ensuing year, eight thou- sand malcontents, assembling in Cumberland, laid siege to Carlisle ; but were repulsed by the garrison, and defeated by Norfolk, who hanged seventy pri- soners"], [929, "407 Chap XXXVIlt. De .potion of H.nry BRITISH 1I.ANDS. soners as officers of rebels. Another body of insur gents was routed at Hull. Some tumults arose else where, but all were suppressed. Great numbers were executed, among whom were some who had been formerly pardoned, but were suspected of new plots. By the terror of these punishments the spirit of re volt was at length quite suppressed. That the princes of the neighbouring countries were so situated that no aid from abroad could be sent to the malcontents was fortunate for Henry. The suppression of these insurrections served so to confirm the power of this monarch as to enable him to proceed unresisted to complete the dissolution of monastic establissiments. From a concurrence of cir cumstances he acquired an actual despotism. The court, the ministry, and the nation were divided into two parties, the one zealously attached to the Ro missi, the other to the reformed religion. The par tizans of each were ardently desirous to draw Flenry to their side ; but with a prince of so impetuous and imperious a spirit, not guided in his conduct by po licy, but by his vehement passions, they could en tertain no hopes of success by any other means than an unlimited submission to his humour. Thus, fays Hume, the \" monarch, who held the balance be tween the factions, was enabled, by the courtssiip paid him both by protestants and catholics, to as sume an immeasurable authority. Each side dreaded to lose him by the smallest opposition, and flattered themselves that a blind compliance with his will would throw him cordially and fully into their in terests.\" Circumstanced in this manner, and vested with"], [930, "408 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXVIII Henry's character, with all the ecclesiastical jurisdiction formerly pos sessed in England by the pope, which was quite un defined, and consequently more formidable when united with temporal sovereignty, he exercised a more absolute prerogative than has fallen to the lot of any other Englissi king. The use or abuse of this exorbitant power depend ed on the sovereign's character, to which its acqui sition is in great part ascribabse. His situation af forded him a full opportunity for a display of his qualities both bad and good. His popularity in the beginning of his reign was in great part caused by those endowments by which the vulgar eye is affect ed. He was tall and handsome in his youth, strong, active, expert in the manly exercises of the age, stately and of a commanding aspect, rather indeed imperious than dignified or majestic. In the powers of the intellect he was not deficient. He was pos sessed of a vigorous, daring, vigilant spirit, with an uncommonly good capacity for literary attainments, in which he also made a remarkable proficiency : but, instead of true philosophy, which expands the soul and mollifies the heart, the chief object of his study was the absurd metaphysics of the schoolmen, which, instead of enlarging, tended only to perplex and setter the faculty of reason. He was destitute of solid judgment, and displayed a mental weakness in his fondness for vain and expensive pageantry. His passions, naturally vehement, were, from the un bounded flattery of his prostrate subjects, and even of foreign princes, between whom, from his situa tion, he stood arbiter, fostered to a pitch of ungo- vernable"], [931, "BRITISH HANDS. 409 Chap, XXXVIII. Fall of Cromwel. 1510. vernable fury. From the fame causes he was actu ated by a consummate pride, and a most inordinately high opinion of his own wisdom. He was caprici ous, pedantic, superstitious, inflexibly obstinate, pro digal, rapacious, and so cruel as to demonstrate him self utterly void of pity or remorse. He is however acknowledged to have been highly accomplished for his time, undisguised in his conduct, and at inter vals gallant, generous, and friendly ; but of his ca pability of permanent friendssiip his behaviour to Cranmer is a solitarv instance. His caprice and cruelty were strongly displayed in the unmerited fate of Thomas Cromwel. This man, the son of a blacksmith, had been a servant of car dinal Wolsey, and had been raised by his favour to a seat in the house of commons. In 1529, when the upper house of parliament requested the lower to join in an address to the king against the cardinal, Cromwel defended his fallen master with such spirit, such force of argument and eloquence, that the pro posal was rejected. This noble exertion, supposed at the time in a high degree hazardous, unexpect edly acquired the esteem of his sovereign, who per haps in reality approved not of the address. Em ployed in the royal service, and proving most active, and prudent, he rose by gradation to the office of prime minister, of the king's vicegerent in spirituals, to the dignity of earl of Essex, and the highest seat in the house of Lords. Fie at length sell suddenly into disgrace by recommending as a wife Anne of Cleves to his royal master, to whose taste her person and manners were not adapted. As the king was at the"], [932, "HISTORY OF THE 410 Chap XXXVIII. Servility of parliament. the same time enamoured with a lady named Cathe- rine Howard, her powerful relatives, enemies of the reformation, and of Cromwel, its secret favourer, seized the opportunity, and used all their influence to complete his ruin. With the malice of these co- operated the envy of the nobles in general and the hatred of the vulgar. The former were indignant at the elevation of a low-born man above them by the force of merit. The latter ascribed to his advice the destruction of the monasteries. Henry was not unwilling to transfer the odium of public measures from himself to his minister, and to make a sacrifice of him to his own popularity. Cromwel was ac- cused of treason and heresy. The servile parliament required no proof. Those, who had a few days be- fore declared him worthy of being vicar-g-eneral of the universe, adjudged him to death by a bill of at- tainder. Neither Cranmer's supplication, nor his own most pathetic letters to the king availed. He was beheaded in the July of 1540, deeply regretted by those who were acquainted with his grateful dis position, his moderation and other virtues. Not only in the attainder of Cromwel and of others, without regard to justice or humanity, was the dastard servility of parliament in this reign dis played, but also in various other instances too nu merous to be specified. By an act in 1529, all the sums, which the king had borrowed from his sub jects, were declared to be his own, the bonds, which he had given for security, were annulled ; and his numerous creditors of all ranks, most of whom had been the friends of the fallen Wolsey, were left without"], [933, "4!t Chap XXXVIII, BRITISH ILANDS. without redress, to lament their losses. In 1544, a like acquittance was made to him of a loan, doubt- less not voluntary, which he had levied from his peo- ple in general. Even those, who had already got payment in whole or in part, were obliged to refund whatever they had received. In 1539 a total resig- nation was made of the civil liberties of England, as had already been made of the ecclesiastical, to the king, to whose proclamations the entire force of sta- tutes was given by a decree of parliament ; and this decree was so framed as if it were declaratory of the power naturally inherent in the sovereign. As Henry was now formally vested with the whole of the legis- lative, as well as every other authority of the state, he might have thenceforth governed without a par- liament, if he had not found it so useful an instru- ment of his tyranny. By an act of 1 545, all the reve- nues of the universities were conferred on the king, as had been those of the convents ; and to his ge- nerous abstinence from pillage on this occasion the great seminaries of Oxford and Cambridge owe the continuation of their existence. Flattery, with which every monarch is profusely regaled while he is reign ing, was lavished on this prince in the extreme by his parliament. Thus, immediately after a most ty rannic deed of cruelty, the execution of Ann Bo leyn, the speaker of the commons, in a speech made in his presence, compared him for wisdom to Solo mon, for strength to Sampson, and for beauty to Absalom. The reception of so great and so public flattery with complacence marks fully the pampered arro- gance"], [934, "\u2022*s2 Chap XXXVIII Ecclesiasti cal proceed ings of Henry, 1536 154-4* HISTORY OF THE gance of the king. This was most forcibly by him dis played in his ecclesiastical government, in which on every occasion he found his parliament unboundedly compliant. Though he had renounced all subordi nation to the Roman fee, and annexed to his crown that supremacy over the church of England of which he had deprived the pope, he had yet inflexibly de termined to maintain in full force the doctrines of the Roman church, and to guard, fays Hume, \" with fire and sword the imagined purity of his speculative principles.\" Some changes, however, were admit ted which had a tendency in favour of reformation, and Henry ssiewed a somewhat fluctuating conduct according to the prevailing influence of persons at tached to the old or new opinions. In 1536 a system of religious articles, in which all his subjects were commanded to acquiesce, as the creed and ritual of the church of England, was composed, under the king's authority and correc tion, by the bissiops and other men of learning. The scriptures and the three ancient creeds, that of the apostles, the Nicene, and Athanasian, were made the standards of doctrine, without any notice of tradition. Four sacraments were omitted. The three retained were those of baptism, of penance, and of the altar. With penance auricular confession was declared necessary. Transubstantiation was as serted in the strongest terms possible. Pilgrimages were not enjoined, and purgatory was left doubtful. A translation of the Bible into Englissi had been per mitted, and in 1537 a copy of it was ordered to be deposited in each parissi church for the perusal of all who"], [935, "BRITISH ILANDS. 413 who might choose to read it. In the following year Chap. images, to which the vulgar were supposed to pay *^_l_i idolatrous worssiip, were commanded to be removed from the churches. The fame direction was given with respect to the ssirines of some reputed saints, particularly that of Thomas a Becket at Canterbury. A judicial examination into the merits of this man was formally managed before the king and council, by whom he was adjudged to have been neither a faint nor a martyr, but a rebel. His images and tomb were demolissied, his festival annulled, his bones burned, and their assies scattered in the wind. As the resort of pilgrims to the ssirine of Becket had been prodigious, its riches were proportionally great. Beside a variety of costly ornaments, the solid gold is said to have filled two chests which eight strong men could scarcely carry. To all further advances toward reformation an ef fectual bar was opposed in 1539 by an act called the law of the six articles. By this cruel statute the se verest punissiments were decreed against all who ssiould express any doubt concerning the doctrines of the real presence in the sacrament of the altar, of the communion in one kind, of the perpetual ob ligation of vows of chastity, of the utility of pri vate masses, of the celibacy of the clergy, or of the necessity of auricular confession. For an offense against the first article the punissiment was death by fire, with confiscation of all property, without the admission of recantation for pardon. Against trans gressors with respect to the other five the pains of felony were decreed. Cranmer had the courage to oppose"], [936, "HISTORY OF THE 414 Chap XXXVIII, Religious persecu- tions, oppose this bill in the house of lords contrary to the king's injunction ; yet, as he parted with his wife in obedience to the law, he lost not the royal favour. As complaints were still made that differences in sen timents of religion continued to subsist among the Englissi, the parliament enacted in 1540, that what ever system of belief and practice ssiould afterward be publissied, under the king's authority, ssiould, under the most rigorous penalties, be admitted by all his subjects. In 1543 the reading of the scrip tures in Englissi was prohibited to the common peo ple, and a book, styled the \" Erudition of a chris tian man,\" substituted for them, containing the royal doctrines. In this the four sacraments, for merly omitted, were restored. Also in a composi tion, titled the \" king's primer book,\" prayers for the private use of his subjects were exclusively pre scribed. In the succeeding year, by the influence of Cranmer, some innovations were made in favour of the reformers, particularly an order for the use of a body of prayers in the Englissi tongue in the public service of the churches in the archiepiseopal pro vince of Canterbury. How much soever Henry indulged his own hu mour in making alterations in the model of ortho doxy which he prescribed to his subjects, he had no sort of idea of any indulgence allowable to the opinions of others. An unrelenting spirit of persecution was actively employed throughout his reign, first against the Lollards, and afterwards against the followers of the new reformers. Of the numbers burned alive, or punissied in some other less horrible"], [937, "BRITISH ILANDS. 415 Chap XXXVIII. horrible mode, for acknowledging their doubts con cerning any dogmas of the Roman church, the catalogue would be tedious and the narrative dis gusting. My readers may be satisfied with two or three instances. John Nicholson, a school-master in London, who, to elude his former persecutors, had changed his name to Lambert, appealed to the king, when, in 1538, he was cited before Cranmer for his diibelief of the corporal presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Proud of such an opportunity of displaying to the public his theological erudition, Henry issued orders for the exhibition of the trial in Westminster-hall in a manner the most pompous and solemn imagina- ble. He fat clothed in white robes, under a canopy covered with white cloth, intended as emblematic of the purity of his faith. On his right in solemn state were arranged the spiritual, on his left the temporal lords ; while the rest of the hall was crowded with judges, eminent lawyers, courtiers, and other persons of distinction from all parts of England. The prisoner was much intimidated on being produced before^ so awful an assembly, parti- cularly by the truculent aspect and stern de- meanour of the king, who having resolved to act the disputant, not the impartial judge, furiously rejected his humble address, and com- manded him to answer directly to the question. Amid browbeatings, taunts, and insults, Lambert maintained his cause by sound arguments, during five hours, against the king and ten bilhops in suc cession. Silenced at length by faintness from so long"], [938, "HISTORY OF THE 416 Chap XXXVIII long continued exertions in a standing posture, he declared his resignation of his soul to the mercy of God, and of his body to the mercy of his sovereign. Than the latter he could hardly have found a more merciless depositary. For his having dared to argue against the king his sentence of death by fire was executed in the most excruciating manner. His legs and thighs were consumed before his trunk was touched by the flames ; but the guards, from compassion, threw this into the burning mass, where he expired, repeating this exclamation \" none but Christ.\" A boy of fifteen, named Richard Mekens, was in 1540 accused of having said that \" the sacrament was only a ceremony or signification.\" The il literate youth declared himself willing to believe whatever ssiould be dictated to him ; but abjuration was not admitted by the law of the six articles. On account of inconsistency in the evidence the grand jury twice rejected the bill, but was intimidated into compliance by the threats of bissiop Bonar. The petty jury found him guilty of denying the corporal presence, and he was burned alive. Nei ther were the catholics, in this tyrannic reign, quite free from persecution. Those who denied the king's supremacy were executed as traitors. When a foreigner, in that year saw three of these drawn to the place of execution, together with three of the most learned protestant preachers, he remarked that, in England, \" all who were against the pope were burned, and all who were for him were hanged.\" Among those who died by fire in 1546 was a beautiful"], [939, "BRITISH ILANDS. 417 beautiful young woman, named Ann Assiew, inti- .\u00a3H*p.;r mately connected with some of the chief ladies of v\u2014 v-w the court, and possessed of uncommon intellect, learning, and piety. Found guilty of the fame crime as Mekins, ssie was tortured in so dreadful a manner as to be almost pulled asunder by the rack, for the purpose of extorting from her some matter of accusation against her suspected friends, particu larly the last of the successive wives of Henry. She had, on her trial, silenced her judges by the acute ness of her answers, and ssie bore her tortures with such invincible fortitude, as to give no infor mation. Unable to stand, from the dislocation of her joints, ssie was carried in a chair to the stake, and retained amid the fire a serene and smiling countenance.

His danger once seemed imminent when the catholic faction was possessed of the ascen dancy. On a charge of his giving encourage ment to heresy, exhibited by the chief cour tiers, the king consented that he ssiould be sum moned before the council, and that, if sufficient cause ssiould be found, he ssiould be imprisoned in the tower : but he gave him privately a ring, which he directed him to produce, as a token of appeal to the royal ear, if the privilege of being Vol. 11.

On the receipt of this the members of the council repaired to their sovereign, who severely rebuked them for their malice, and for the indignity which they had offered to the primate in causing him to remain above an hour among ser vants in the antechamber. Cranmer, whose ruin had appeared to all inevitable, was thus found to stand so firm in the royal favour that no further attempt was in this reign made against him. The successive marriages of Henry, and the seve ral fates of his queens, form an important part of the history of his reign. In no part is the capri cious tyranny of the king, and the pliant sycophancy of parliament, more strongly exemplified. 1 have already related his marriage with Catherine of Spain, his divorce from that lady, and the espousal of his second queen, Ann Boleyn. Though his attach ment to the latter had, previously to the accom plissiment of his matrimonial union with her, been ardent and unchangeable, he sometime afterwards began to ssiew signs of coolness, particularly when he had conceived a passion for another lady, one of the maids of honour, named Jane Seymour. The enemies of the reformation, to which Ann was a friend, took advantage of this unfavourable change in her hussiand's affections, and inflamed him with jealousy.

Though per fectly chaste, ssie had been sprightly and jocose in her manner. When ssie fell into hysterics in the tower, which weakened both her body and mind, insidious arts were used to draw confessions from her of words innocently spoken which might be miscon strued as indiscreet. Though denied the admittance of any friend in her confinement, and of any counsel in her trial, which was held before a jury of twenty-six peers, the queen made such a defence as convinced all the audience that ssie was innocent. But the judges dared not to give any other verdict than such as would please their sovereign. She was sentenced to be either burned or beheaded according to his choice. Not satisfied with her blood, he required a divorce, and the consequent bastardizing of her in fant daughter. To escape the fire ssie feigned the acknowledgement of a legal obstacle to her marriage, which was therefore pronounced null from the be ginning. In either justice or law ssie could not have the guilt of adultery without being a wife; y^nfo glaring an inconsistency was quite disregarded. She was beheaded in the May of 1536. She suffered with a cheerful composure. Previously to her death five gentlemen had been executed as her paramours, among whom was her brother, lord Rochford, barbarously accused of incest with her. Her body was thrown carelessly into an old chest, and im mediately buried in the tower. On the very day after the murder, as it may just ly be styled, of his second queen, the nuptial cere- E e 2 mony"], [942, "\u266620 Chap XXXVIII. 1 5 10. HISTORY OF THE mony was performed between the king and Jane Seymour. This was also a very amiable and beau tiful woman, lively, but less gay than Ann Boleyn. She was fortunate in escaping by an early death any unfavourable change which might have arisen from the unsteady temper of her concert. She expired in the October of 1537, twelve days after her delive ry of a prince named Edward. After some other negociations for a foreign bride, Henry at length concluded a treaty for the espousal of Ann of Cleves, daughter to a duke of that title, one of the mem bers of the protestant league in Germany. On her arrival in England, he went in disguise to Rochester to obtain privately a view of her person. This he so much disliked that, in his rude manner, he pro nounced her, with an oath, \" a great Flanders mare.\" His aversion encreased when he found that ssie could speak no other language than the dutch. Yet, fear ing to offend the German protestants, in the deli cate situation in which he seemed at that time to stand with respect to other potentates, he completed the marriage in the January of 1540. He became still more disgusted. Cromwel, who had encoura ged this joyless match, fell a victim to his discontent, and to his new passion for Catherine Howard. On the pretence of a former negociation for a treaty of marriage between Ann and the prince of Lorraine, Henry was divorced from his fourth queen, by the decrees of both the convocation and parliament, in the July of the fame year. Fortunately for Ann in this situation, ssie was so far from being actuated by an acute sensibility, that, on the promise of a , pension"], [943, "42 i Chap XXXVIII. 1511 151-2 BRITISH ILANDS. pension of three thousand pounds yearly, her adop tion as the king's sister, and precedence of all females at court except the king's wise and daugh ters, ssie appeared quite satisfied, wrote in that spi rit to her friends, and remained till the day of her death in England. The king proceeded quickly to his nuptials with Catherine Howard, a lady of noble blood, attached to the catholics, who thus for some time gained a manifest ascendency. He felt such happiness in this new connexion, that he commanded a form of prayer to be composed for his acknowledge- ment of it, and he returned public thanks to God on his receiving the sacrament. On the very next day after this, an information was given to Cranmer, by a man named John Lossels, of lewd indulgences of the queen previously to her marriage. The pri- mate, not daring to conceal what yet, if it ssiould not be indubitably proved, would bring ruin on his head, communicated immediately the intelli- gence to his sovereign. That three men had seve- rally been admitted to her bed was on investiga- tion made evident to her astonissied consort. She was attainted by parliament, and beheaded, in the February of 1542. With her was execu- ted, unpitied by the public, the confidant of her amours, the widow of lord Rochford, who had been the chief instrument in bringing her husoand, and his sister Ann Boleyn, to the scaffold. The paramours of the queen had already been put to death, and several persons were condemned, but mostly afterwards pardoned, for misprision of treason, as"], [944, "HISTORY OF THE 422 Chap XXXVIII. 1543 as they had not informed against Catherine, though they had been acquainted with her gallantries. To humour the caprices of their tyrant, the slavissi par liament, having praised him, as \" anointed by the Almighty with the oil of wisdom above all princes,\" enacted some indelicate laws which were repealed in the first year of the succeeding reign. By one of these any woman, to whom the present or any future king of England ssiould make proposals of marriage, on the supposition of her being a virgin, would be guilty of high treason, if ssie ssiould not, without confessing the truth to her royal suiter, be of that description. That reputed virgins would be afraid to encoun ter the danger of such a statute, and that none but a widow could be a fit match for the king, was now commonly said by his subjecte. Himself appears to have conceived the fame idea, for in the following year he married the widow of lord Latimer, lady Catherine Parr. This lady, who secretly favoured the reformers, was three years after in the utmost peril from the cruel bigotry of her consort. The lord Chancellor Wriothesly and bissiop Bonar, to whom Henry complained of her having argued against him on subjects of religion, seized with ar dour the opportunity of representing her to him as a most pestilent heretic. In his anger he signed articles of impeachment against her : but, by uncom monly good fortune, the paper of impeachment was, on his way homeward, dropped by the chancellor, and found by one of the queen's friends who brought it to her. She saw clearly her danger and"], [945, "BRITISH ILANDS. 423 Chap XXXVIII. Inconsistent Statutes. and formed calmly her plan. In her next in terview, without pretending to know any thing of this affair, ssie took occasion to tell him that her only object in controverting his arguments was to afford him amusement, and to draw delightful in struction from a man who was well qualified to dictate a system of faith and worssiip to all the na tions of the earth. Embracing her, he said, \" is it so sweet-heart.\" Soon after, when the chancellor arri ved with a guard to arrest the queen, Henry advan ced to meet him, and, calling him knave, fool, and beast, drove him from his presence. The tyranny of the monarch and the slavery of his parliament appeared glaring in the enactment of statutes inconsistent one with another. Concern ing this I shall transcribe the words of Hume. \" Beside the violent prosecution of whatever he was pleased to call heresy, the laws of treason were multiplied beyond all former precedent. Even words to the disparagement of the king, queen, or royal issue, were subjected to that penalty ; and so little care was taken in framing these rigorous statutes, that they contain obvious contradictions; insomuch that, had they been strictly executed, every man, without exception, must have fallen under the pe nalty of treason. By one, statute, for instance, it was declared treason to assert the validity of the king's marriage either with Catherine of Arragon or Ann Boleyn. By another it was treason to say any thing to the disparagement or slander of the princesses Mary and Elizabeth, the daughters of these; and to call them spurious would be no doubt construed to"], [946, "HISTORY OF THE 424 Chap XXXVIII Executions, to their slander. Nor would even a profound silence with respect to these delicate points be able to save a person from such penalties, for by the former statute, whoever refuses to answer upon oath to any point contained in that act, was subjected to the pains of treason. The king therefore needed only to propose to any one a question with regard to the legality of either of his first marriages. If the person was silent, he was a traitor by law. If he answered either in the negative or affirmative, he was no less a traitor. So monstrous were the inconsistencies, which arose from the furious pas sions of the king, and the slavissi submission of his parliaments. It is hard to lay whether these contradictions were owing to Henry's precipitancy, or to a formed design of tyranny.\" Of the numbers executed in this reign, on reli gious or civil accusations, a few have been already mentioned, and some sew others may here be no ticed. Reginald de la Pole, fourth son of Mar garet, countess of Salisoury, daughter of George duke of Clarence, the second brother of Edward the fourth, had manifested an early taste for litera ture, had been educated in foreign universities at Henry's expence, and had been destined for the highest preferments in the church, but had formed connexions in Italy, which drew him into the in terest of the pope against his relative and sove reign. He publissied a book, in which he con demned in the most forcible terms the king's divorce from his first wife, and his marriage with a second. He was created cardinal and legate by the pope. He"], [947, "BRITISH 11.ANDS. 42J He was supposed to have engaged several persons Chap. of eminence in England in a treasonable plot. These xxxv'11' were tried and executed in 1538, except Sir GeoflVy, a brother of the cardinal, who is said to have given information against the rest. As this champion of the Roman see was, by his residence on the con tinent, beyond the reach of his royal enemy, the vengeance of the latter was wreai.e 1 on the moiher of ' Reginald. This old countess, the last furviver of the royal blood of the Plantagenets, was con demned, without any known proof of guiit, by a bill of attainder in 1539, and led to execution in 1541. Declaring herself innocent, ssie refused to lay her neck on the block, and, running about the stage, was pursued by the executioner, by whom ssie was rather butchered than beheaded. Actuated by a jealousy of the vast property and power of Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk, the king resolved in the decline of life, on the death of this nobleman, the head of the catholics, together with that of his son, the earl of Surrey ; though the duke had performed the most important services, and had ssiewn an unlimited compliance with the will of his master, even in the sacrificing of two queens, his nieces, Ann Boleyn and Catherine Ho ward, to the royal humour. Condemned by a jury, on frivolous imputations, Surrey was beheaded in the January of 1547- His father, the duke, was in like manner doomed to death by a bill of attain der \u2022 but, before the sentence could be executed, the king himself expired ; and, as the council, was unwil ling that the first act of the new reign ssiould be the execution"], [948, "42D Chap XXXVIII.

When Cranmer arrived, he found him speechless ; but when the primate exhorted him to give some token of his dying in the faith, he squeezed his hand. He expired on the twenty-eighth of January in the year 1547) the fifty-sixth of his age and the thirty eighth of his reign. His surviving leigitimate issue were Mary, daughter of Catherine of Spain, Eliza beth, daughter of Ann Boleyn, and Edward, son of Jane Seymour.

Though the Englissi were triumphant over these invaders, yet, from the rue ful devastations of their warfare, and the unutter able confusion into which affairs were thrown, the Englissi colony in this iland had fallen into a state of decline, from which it recovered not for nearly two centuries. The diminution of inhabitants by famine and pestilence was a loss far more easily repaired than the extinction of all regard for laws and regular government. So deeply imbibed was the habit of disorder, and love of exemption from all restraints of legal rules, that numbers of colo nists, renouncing their privileges as Englissi subjects, coalesced with the Irish, adopting their garb, man ners, and language. From the licentiousness of war, which"], [950, "4_\\_ Chap XXXIX. HISTORY OF THE which fixed such a lamentable fondness for irregu- lar life, arose another cause of English apostacy. The troops of the king, unpaid from a deficient revenue, were licensed to procure subsistence for themselves by what was denominated coyne and li- very, that is, arbitrary exactions from the people of the districts through which they marched, or main- tenance at free quarter. Freeholders, unable to support the rapacity and insolence of the royal troops, and of those of the barons, fled partly into England, partly to septs of Irissi, abandoning their lands to the original natives. Thus the lands of Waterford, Cork, Kerry, and Limerick, deserted by Englissi settlers, were occupied by a mixed rabble of Irissi manners, and mostly of Irissi blood, the fol lowers of Maurice Fitzthomas of Desmond, who, to evade the claims of the proprietors, renounced all connexion with Englissi law, and assumed the style of an Irissi prince. So enviable appeared the situation of this chief, that his example was followed by several other barons ; and so great was the general corruption, that even among those, who 'still called themselves Englissi, justice was often administered in the Irissi manner ; judges assuming an authority of compound ing for the crimes of even robbery and murder. The name and influence of Englissimen were con tracted within still narrower limits by events con sequential to the death of William de Burgo, earl of Ulster, in the year 1333. This baron was mur dered at Carrickfergus by his own attendants, who were afterwards punissied for the crime. An infant daughter,"], [951, "42^ Chap XXXI X- 1333 1343 BRITISH ILAKDS. daughter, with whom her mother fled into England, was heiress of his vast estates, which by the Englissi law ought to have been taken into possession by the king, as guardian in such cases. But the sept of O'Nial, passing the river Bann with all their forces, seized great part of the Englissi settlements in Antrim ; and, parcelling these among themselves, under the names of the upper and lower Clan Hugh-boy, from their leader Hugh-boy O'Nial, al most extirpated, in the course of some years, the Englissi colony in that quarter : while in Con naught the two most powerful among the younger branches of the de Burgo family divided the exten sive demesnes between them ; and, to elude the claim of the young heirs, they, with their nume rous followers, adopted the manners of the ancient natives, and became Irissi princes under the names of Macwilliam oughter and Mackwilliam eighter, or the farther and nether Macwilliam. The strength of the colonists was diminissied still further by divisions among themselves, caused by the impolitic measures of Edward the third, who, occu pied by delusive schemes of conquest in France, overlooked the substantial interests of his crown in Ireland. With apparently a sovereign contempt of his subjects in this country, he issued ordonnances for the resumption of all grants of estates and juris dictions made by himself and his father ; and for the disqualification of all, except Englissimen pos sessed of property in England, to hold offices in this kingdom. \" Thus,\" fays .Leland, \" were the descendants of those who had originally gained the English"], [952, "430 HISTORY OF THE Chap XXXIX 1361 Englissi acquisitions in Ireland, who had laboured in a long course of painful and perilous service to maintain them, who daily ssied their blood in the service of their monarch, pronounced indiscrimi nately to be dangerous, and declared incapable of filling any even the meanest department in adminis tration.\" A violent ferment was excited among the insulted colonists, which encreased from day to day, and become at length quite alarming. To petitions for redress the king returned soothing promises. To what extent these promises were fulfilled we are not informed ; but the invidious distinction, made be tween Englishmen born in England and men of Englissi descent born in Ireland, caused a faction be tween English by birth and English by blood, which remained long after the removal of its original cause. The dissension was heightened between these fac tions by the erroneous conduct of Lionel, the second son of Edward the third. Claiming the earldom of Ulster in right of his wife Elizabeth, daughter of the murdered earl De Burgo, this prince brought from England an army of fifteen hundred men, and took on him the office of chief governor with ample power. This body, if conducted by an able com mander, and reinforced by the troops of the colonial barons, might have accomplissied the recovery of his wife's estates, and prepared the way for a complete reduction of the kingdom. But, altogether unac quainted with Irissi affairs, and surrounded by the faction of English birth, the prince not only declined all colonial assistance, but even interdicted by pro- clamation"], [953, "BRITISH ILANDS. 431 clamaticn the approach to his camp of all persons Chap. of Irissi birth, though of English blood. Thus des- J^I^ titute of the most effectual aid, Lionel was environed by the enemy in Thomond, and in danger of total destruction, till, convinced of his error, he sum moned the colonists to his standard. By the exer tions of these he gained such advantages over the O'Briens in that quarter as to reduce their force to a very low condition. Nothing of moment was how ever atchieved. The prince was recalled, unable to recover his lands in Ireland, though his father, in a ruinous war of many years, had aimed at the con quest of the great kingdom of France. So absurd is often the conduct of men most celebrated for mi- litary prowess ! If even the success of Lionel had been much greater, it could hardly have counter- balanced the evils of discord ssiarpened between the two parties of Englissi. So many violent acts were committed, that Edward was obliged to issue an or- donnance, commanding his Englissi subjects of both denominations, under penalty of two years impri sonment, to abstain from all deeds of contumely and contention. Among occurrences of an inferior class, which Misceiiane bad place in -this period of the colony's decline, a rences, few may be briefly noticed, indicative of the state 1327. - .... 1367. of government and society. To the miseries of civil broils were added the horrors of prosecutions for the imaginary crime of witchcraft by a pestiferous churchman, Richard Ledred, bissiop of Ossory, who also brought accusations of heresy to the aid of his malevolence. When he had by his machinations de- stroyed"], [954, "HISTORY OF THE 432 Chap XXXIX stroyed several innocent victims, particularly a lady named Alice Ketser, who was burned alive, he was prevented from further proceedings in this path of iniquity by his metropolitan, who, charging him with heresy, forced him to seek refuge in Rome by an appeal to the pope Meanwhile the political his tory presents to us perpetual repetitions of baronial feuds, and desultory wars of Irissi clans, now and then checked by the extraordinary exertions of a chief governor. These petty commotions were often attended with atrocious acts of cruelty. Thus, in a war conducted by O'Brien of Thomond, at the head of a confederacy of Irissi clans, who were enraged by a fressi refusal of their request to be admitted un der the protection of Englissi law, we find the fol lowing instance. About eighty persons of Englissi ancestry, surprized in a church at the time of divine service, in utter despair of mercy to themselves, at tempted only to supplicate for the life of the priest, who in vain presented the consecrated wafer. The host was furiously snatched from his hand, himself transpierced with weapons, and the miserable con gregation consumed in the church, which was set on fire over them. Among the impolitic acts of Englissi government in Ireland was the erection of palatinates, whose number, in the reign of the third Edward was aug mented to nine. In these the king's writs had no authority, except in the lands, called the Cross, be longing to the church. The lords of counties pala tine were petty monarchs, who thus held two-thirds of the Englissi territories in Ireland exempt from the royal"], [955, "BRITISH 1LANDS. 433 C>IAP XXX IX, 1355 royal jurisdiction. Of the actual imbecility of ad ministration in this reign we have a striking instance in the opposition of an ecclesiastic. When a sub sidy, assessed on land, for the relief of the subjects from coyne and livery, was granted by parliament, Ralph Kelly, an Irissiman, archbissiop of Cassiel, issued an ordonnance, with the concurrence of his suffragans, forbidding the payment of this tax from the clergy and tenants on lands of the church, under the severest ecclesiastical penalties. He proceeded to excommunicate, with the most awful solemnity, all persons concerned in the interdicted collection. Found guilty on an information, Kelly and his suf fragans refused to appear in arrest of judgment, and yet suffered no punissiment for this defiance of royal power. The administration of Sir Thomas Rokeby, which commenced in 1355, was rendered remarkable by his uncommon integrity, and his regulation of the Irissi parliament. The maxirn of this chief governor was, \" let my dissies be wooden rather than my cre ditors unpaid.\" According to lord Coke's account, Irissi conventions, before this administration, had not been so properly parliaments as assemblies of great men : but they were now brought nearer the Englissi model. To these was also consigned the de cision of appeals from erroneous proceedings in the courts of law, which before had been carried at great expence and trouble into England.

For this purpose he summoned a parliament in 1367, more numerous and respectable than had hitherto been convened in thi3 kingdom, by which, composed of both estates in one house, was enacted a celebrated ordonnance, distinguissied by the name of the statute of Kil kenny. This statute, framed chiefly to prevent the dege neracy of the English colonists, interdicted, under various and severe penalties, marriage, fosterage, and other such connexions, with the Irissi; the adoption of an Irissi name, the use of the Irissi language, garb, or customs ; the use of the Brehon law ; the making of war on the Irissi without special licence from go vernment ; the presentation of Irissimen to eccle siastical benefices, and the reception of them into monasteries ; the entertainment of Irissi bards and newsmongers, and the quartering of soldiers on Englissi subjects without their consent. Some other rules were enacted for the enforcement of order and the defence of the colony. This act of the legis lature, by which the Irissi were declared enemies ex cluded from intercourse, was at several times after wards revived with modifications, but was never strictly observed, nor in fact then capable of being strictly reduced to practice. The solid policy of a plan for the uniting of all under the fame laws was above the genius of the men in power amonc the Englissi in Ireland in that age. For"], [957, "BRITISH ILANI.S. 435 Chap XXXIX Degraded statute of the colony. 13 67 13.4 For the space of twenty-seven years after the en- action of these laws we find nothing in the annals of this country but petty transactions attendant on the retrogradation of the colony, dissentions among the settlers, desultory attacks of Irissi clans on the Englissi and among themselves, complaints of oppressive con- duct in chief governors, and of Englissi absentees, the owners of Irissi estates, who declined to attend in person, or even to send substitutes, for the de- fence of their possessions. In the administration of Sir William Windsore, which commenced in 1369, the dishonourable plan was adopted of employing Irissi chieftains to protect the colony, in considera- tion of pensions, which they regarded as tributes, and of which the payment, when delayed by any ac- cident they enforced by hostility. These pensions, with other charges, could not be paid without re- mittances from England ; for we are assured by Da- vies, that the whole revenue accruing to the English government out of Ireland, both certain and casual, amounted not to ten thousand pounds annually, on an average of the best seven years during the long reign of Edward the third. Into so abject a state was the colony fallen, and so foul was become the country's reputation, that when Sir Richard Pem- bridge was nominated chief governor, he refused to execute the commission, and his refusal was justified, as going into Ireland, even in that high office, was adjudged to be going into exile. After some abortive schemes for the reduction of the Irissi, king Richard the second resolved to per- F f 2 form"], [958, "43(5 Chap XXXIX.

He landed at Waterford, in the October of 1394, with an army of thirty four thousand men, of whom four thousand were men at arms, a force of such magnitude as Ireland had never seen, and fully sufficient for its purpose, if wisely conducted. But the genius of Richard was unequal to the enterprise. No plan of resistance was adopted by the Irissi chieftains, all of whom, after some slight fkirmissies in Leinster, made their sub missions. On this occasion the lords or petty mo narchs of the Irissi were found to be seventy-five in number. The king in person received at Drogheda the homage of the northern dynasts ; earl Mowbray that of the Leinstrian. To perform the ceremony of fubmiflion, to promise fealty, the payment of tribute, and the keeping of the peace inviolate, were merely the terms required or proposed, terms always regarded by the Irissi elans as no other than formalities, ne cessary to be observed only during convenience. On some principal chieftains the honour of knighthood was conferred, which was not accepted without some reluctance, as they had among themselves what they called knighthood, though its nature and ceremo nies were different from those of England. Having spent nine months in, Ireland in frivolous parade, Richard returned home, leaving this unfortunate country precisely In the fame state in which he had found it, except a temporary appearance of deceit- ful tranquillity. The futile conclusion of this pompous undertak. ing, symbolized by the fable of a mountain in par turition,"], [959, "BRITISH ILANDS. 437 Chap XXXIX Second visit of Richard, 1390 turition, was in a ssiort time evident. The septs of Leinster had promised to evacuate this province for the use of the colonists, and to seek settlements else where for themselves. Attempts to enforce this un reasonable stipulation occasioned a furious war, va rious in success, but adverse to the Englifli. Driven from their lands in Wicklow, and pursued into Os sory, the sept of O'Byrn assailed their pursuers by surprize, and defeated them with the destruction of many, among whom was Roger Mortimer, earl of March, the lord lieutenant. Richard was en raged at the audacity of the Leinstrians and the death of Mortimer, his cousin, whom he had des tined to be his successor on the throne. Resolved on castigation, he assembled an army of thirty thou sand men at Bristol, whence he sailed to Ireland. Landing at Waterford in the May of 1399, Rich ard, after some delay at that town and at Kilkenny, proceeded through a country wasted by war to at tack Art Mac Murchad, a politic and enterprizing chieftain. With a body of three thousand well arm ed followers, this leader so availed himself of the bogs and woods of his country, the admirable agility of his men, and their expertnefs in desultory onsets, as to baffle the far superior numbers and discipline of the royal army. This army was at length forced to an inglorious retreat, incessantly harassed by an enemy, who, casting missiles with fatal strength, eluded a combat. The retreating troops were so miserably pressed by famine, against which the thoughtless monarch had made no provision, that, when"], [960, "HISTORY OF THE 438 CIl .P XXXIX.

Mac Murchad endeavoured to avail himself of present circumstances for the accomplissiment of an advantageous treaty. An interview on that subject, between him and the duke of Glocester, terminated without an accommodation. Richard continued his march to Dublin, where, after a delay of six weeks without intelligence from England, on account of unfavourable weather, he at length received the dis mal news of a general insurrection of the Englissi for his deposition, of which I have given an account in my twenty-ninth chapter. From this time, during a long period, Ireland was little regarded by its Englissi monarchs. In its -re- cords in those days little is found of an interesting, and still less of an agreeable nature. The state of the country was such as I have described it previ- ously to the visits of king Richard. The feeble co- lony owed its preservation to the contempt into which it had fallen among the Irissi ; to the regular pay- ment of annual tributes, denominated black rent, to Irissi toparchs, which, as an acknowledgement of their superiority, gratified their pride ; to the dis- union of the septs, and their mutual jealousy, almost as great toward one another as toward the Englissi, who were considered as a particular sept, in some de- gree naturalized, and under the protection of cer tain dynasts. Great numbers of Englissi were com- pletely"], [961, "4S9 Chap XXXIX Further decline of the colony I 1.0, 1 174 BRITISH ILAXDS. pletely blended with the ancient natives, and others were in a kind of intermediate state, in various steps of gradation, between the condition of subjects to the king and of enemies to his power. The colony, thus degraded, was enfeebled still further by its be ing involved in the war of the Roses, until it gra dually funk to the lowest ebb of its decline. Richard, duke of York, the inheritor of ample estates, and of much more ample claims, in Ireland, particularly of the earldom of Ulster, entered per sonally on the function of lord lieutenant in 1449, vested with the most extensive authority. He here neither found, nor seems to have sought, any great opportunity for a display of military talents. The most striking and durable effect of his administra tion was the popularity which he acquired by his en gaging deportment, in which he exhibited the dig nity of a prince with an apparent cordiality of affec tion, as a kinsman, to the Irissi subjects. His com plaisance was indiscriminately extended to men of all parties. The rival earls of Desmond and Ormond were equally invited to stand sponsors for his son George, born in the castle of Dublin. In his second visit to Ireland, where he took refuge, after the dis persion of his forces at Ludlow in i459> when he had engaged in the war of the Roses, as I have re lated in my thirty-third chapter, his reception was most cordial, particularly among the Geraldines of Desmond and Kildare. For the safety of his fol lowers such acts were passed by the Irissi parliament as almost declared the colony independent of the Englissi"], [962, "410 Chap XXXIX Wakeness of the pale 1174 HISTORY OF THE Englissi crown. Nor were these laws permitted to lie dormant. An agent of the earl of Ormond, who attempted, in virtue of the king's writ, to ar rest some persons declared rebels by the ruling party in England, was seized and executed, as a violator of a statute, by which those persons were pronounced guilty of high treason, who, under pretence of any authority, ssiould molest strangers received under the laws of hospitality in Ireland. The great victory gained by his party at North ampton, in 1460, induced the duke to return into England. Such eagerness was displayed by the Englissi of Ireland to follow his standard, that some settlements, particularly those of Meath, were almost exhausted of men. The battle of Wakefield, fatal to the duke, whose army, mostly composed of men from Ireland, was nearly destroyed, might have proved fatal to the colony, if the Irissi lords had availed themselves of its defenceless condition : but they severally assented to terms of peace under the stipulation of regular tributes. The Englissi pale, by the war of the Roses, was not only thinned of its warriors, but also distracted by the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, to the former of which ad hered the Geraldines, to the latter the Butlers or house of Ormond. The feuds of those barons were attended with fluctuating success, and effects debili tating to the colonial establissiment, the low condi tion of which appears from the measures concerted for its defense. By an act of parliament was instituted a fraternity of arms, consisting of thirteen principal persons in the"], [963, "BRITISH ILANDS. 441 the counties of Dublin, Meath, Kildare, and Ar gial or Louth, in which resided the mass of Englissi subjects. These were empowered annually to elect on Saint George's day a captain, for whose train were assigned a hundred and twenty archers on horse back, and forty other horsemen, each of the latter furnissied with one attendant. A force of only two hundred and thirteen men, with such tumultuary le vies as might be occasionally raised, could constitute a defense merely against local incursions of small parties, while the chief security of the pale depended on the protection of Irissi dynasts purchased by ssiame ful tributes. We also sind that, in some years after this, the annual expence of five hundred pounds, equal in efficient value to about five thousand in the eighteenth century, was suspected to be too great for the resources of the Englissi in Ireland. Chap. XXXIX. During the latter years of Edward the fourth, the ssiort succeeding reigns of Edward the fifth and Rich ard the third, with much of the reign also of Henry the seventh, the administration of the colonial go vernment was held by Gerald Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare, whose removal from this post was appre hended by the court of England to be dangerous, and was therefore not enforced. His influence among the Irissi toparchs was highly augmented by a new connexion. He gave his sister in marriage to Con O'Nial of Tyrowen, son of the greatest among the Irissi lords, who in consequence was vested by act of parliament with all the rights of an Englissi subject ; rights little regarded by the O'Nials, who considered Miscellane ous trans actions.

Of lawless force, practiced in the pale under this admi nistration, the behaviour of Keating, the prior of Kilmainham, a member of the military order of Saint John of Jerusalem, was a striking instance. Having alienated the revenues, and even sold the or naments and relics of the house committed to his charge, he was deprived by the grand master of his order : but, refusing to submit, he seized his ap pointed successor, Lomley, an Englishman of dis tinction, forced from him the instruments of his elec tion, and held his place without regard of the royal pleasure, or even of an excommunication pronounced against him, while the unfortunate Lomley perissied in prison. Kildare himself, when summoned into England to attend the king, whose suspicions were excited of a plot in Ireland against his government, eluded the mandate by a petition from the lords of the pale. That the suspicions of Henry were not unsounded soon appeared from the plot of Lambert Simnel, of which, and of the battle of Stoke, I have given an account in my thirty-fifth chapter. Pardon to the offending colonists, on their humble entreaty, was thought, from the circumstances of his situation, ex pedient by the king.

The pale, now further debi litated by the loss of its men slaughtered at Stoke, was still preserved by the activity and influence of Kildare, and by the mutual hostilities of Irissi chief tains. Of these petty wars, incessant in one or other part of the iland, the narratives of which would be tedious and disgusting, one, at this time waged with great fury between the dynasts of Tyrowen and Tyr connel, was chiefly remarkable for the laconic man ner in which a menace was denounced on one side, and a defiance returned on the other. Send me tri bute or else \u2014 was the message of O'Nial. I owe you none, and if \u2014 was the answer from Tyrconnel. The barbarous devastations of this contest, which Kil dare endeavoured in vain to prevent, were suspended at length by the murder of O'Nial and the infirmi ties of the foe. The abduction of a multitude, of colonists who perissied at Stoke, after those who had before fallen at Wakefield, reduced the colony to the lowest de gree of weakness, when it was threatened with new convulsions by the claim of Perkin Warbeck, of whose adventures I have given a narrative in my thirty-fifth chapter. Little could have been per formed by the Englissi of Ireland in favour of this claimant. The Pale, that portion of the iland which acknowledged Englissi law, had ssirunk into so nar row a compass as not to extend over more than the half of the counties of Dublin, Meath, Kildare, Wexford, and Uriel or Argial, which comprehended Louth.

Having superseded Kildare in 1492 by the appointment of Walter, archbissiop of Dublin, to the office of lord deputy, and having given strength to the faction of the Butler's, the king, in two years after, sent Sir Edward Poyning into Ireland, to lay a foundation for the recovery and extension of the Englissi interest in this country. Little of a military nature was performed by this governor, but his le gislative exertions have rendered his name celebrat ed in Irissi history. In a parliament, convened at Drogheda in i495> several statutes were enacted of a permanent,"], [968, "4+(> Chap XL. Poyning's laws. 1495 HISTORY OF THE a permanent influence for the prevention of the encreasing degeneracy of the colonists, the security of the royal prerogative, and the regulation of fu ture parliaments. Two acts of this parliament are particularly no ticed. By the one the statutes lately enacted in England were extended in the fame force to Ire land. This was neither new nor extraordinary, as the fame provision had been made in the seventh year of Edward the fourth. The other, which was called emphatically Poyning's law, and which made an essential change in the irissi constitution, pro vided, \" that no parliament ssiould thenceforth be held in Ireland but at such seasons as, that the causes and considerations on account of which it ssiould be convened, and the laws which might be deemed proper to be enacted by it, ssiould be pre viously certified to the king under the great seal of Ireland by the king's lieutenant and council.\" This act was at first extremely popular, as it gave the people a temporary relief from the exactions of rapacious governors, but became, from a change of circumstances, unpopular in later times. According to it no parliament could be held in Ireland with out a formal certification of the governor and coun cil of Ireland transmitted to the king and his coun cil, and a formal acknowledgement of their approba tion : and, according to an explanation of it made in the reign of Mary, no bill, nor even heads of a bill, could be framed by the lords or commons of Ireland, but only by the Irissi viceroy and privy council, who transmitted the- bills to the king and privy"], [969, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 447 Chap1, XL Trial of Kildare. 1496^ privy council in England, to be approved, altered, or rejected ; while the Irissi lords and commons had no further power, when a bill was remitted from England, altered or unaltered, than simply to accept or to reject it. Kildare, the late governor, was, on a variety of charges, sent prisoner into England by Poyning. In his tedious confinement his wife languissied at home, and at length died from anxiety. When he was admitted to trial, and ordered by the king to provide council for his defence, he seized his Ma- jesty's hand with an uncourtly familiarity, faying, \" Yea, the ablest in the realm : your highness I take for my council against these false knaves.\" Not destitute of penetration, Henry was not displeased with this rough compliment to his equity and dis- cernment : nor was he unfavourably disposed by the artless behaviour of the culprit on his trial, who treated his accusers as if he were still in Ireland, and still their master. When he was charged with having sacrilegiously burned the church of Cassiel to the ground in one of his lawless expeditions, he sternly replied, \" spare your evidence ; I did set fire to the church, because I thought that the bissiop was in it.\" When nothing was proved of a treason- able nature against the king's government, but only acts of feudal violence, the policy of the king de termined him not only to acquit the accused, but also to invest him with the office of chief governor, as he judged him a fit instrument for his purpose. Therefore, when the accusers closed their charge with this declaration, \" all Ireland cannot govern this"], [970, "HISTORY OF THE 448 this earl;\" Henry replied, \" well, then, this earl ssiall govern all Ireland.\" Chap. XL. This policy of the monarch was justified by the event. Kildare held the reigns of colonial govern ment till his death, during seventeen years. He overawed Irissi chieftains, reduced to a peaceful de meanour Hibernicized Englissi, and put such plans in execution as served to secure:, not to enlarge, the Pale, and to render the acknowledgement, not the establissied obedience of the king's sovereignty more extensive. He formed a matrimonial con nexion, not however attended with cordial recon ciliation, with the Butlers. As from the Scottissi invasion under Edward Bruce to the administration of Poyning, the Englissi power in this iland had gradually declined, through the space of a hundred and eighty years, to its lowest point of depression ; so from the later epocha we date the commence ment of its re-aseension, whence it has, often very slowly, sometimes with great irregularity, continued to encrease till the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Revival of the colony, Battle of Knocktow, A victory gained by Kildare, though the quarrel was of a private nature, had a considerable influence on the affairs of Ireland. The parties met at a place called Knocktow near Galway in 1504, on the nineteenth of August. On the side of the governor were the lords of the Pale, the O'Nials, and some other chiefs of the north. On the oppo site side were the forces of Connaught, with the O'Briens of Thomond, and other toparchs of Mun ster, at whose head was Uliac Macwilliam, lord 1504. of"], [971, "BRITISH II.ANDS. 449 Chap XL 1 \u2014 , \u2014 I Posterior Transac- tions 1513, 1534, of Clanricard, leader of a sept of degenerate Englissi. The colonial barons, when they saw the superior numbers of the enemy, would have proposed a retreat, if it could have been attempted with safety j but they were delivered from their danger by the superior arms and discipline of their men. Among the late improvements of the Pale was the revival of archery. The furious onset of Clanricard's troops was steadily received with a ssiower of well aimed arrows, which made so dreadful a havoc that the victory was afterwards easily obtained. With little loss to the victors, above two thousand of Uliac's men were slain. His two sons were made prisoners, and the Hibernicized septs of Englissi in Munster and Connaught were subdued. After the accession of Henry the eighth little at tention was given to Irissi affairs by the Englissi court; so that on the decease of Kildare in 15 13, the colony was in danger of relapsing into its former state of decline. But Gerald his son, the inheritor of his spirit as well as patrimony, elected governor by the council, and confirmed in his place by the king, quelled in a ssiort time the alarming commo tions of the turbulent, and convened a parliament, among whose statutes was the revival of a law against absentees, vesting two thirds of their Irissi revenues in the king for the service of the state. Gerald was supplanted in 1520 by the intrigues of Piers Butler, earl of Ormond, called Rufus or the red, who was nominated to his place, but with much inferior influence among the Irissi toparchs.

G g entertained"], [972, "450 HISTORY OF THE Chap, XL. 1522 1532 1534 entertained by these, a strong instance occurred in this administration. Mac-Gillapatrick, lord of Of sory, having received some offence from the gover nor, dispatched an ambassador to the king to de mand satisfaction. This representative of majesty, with a solemnity of deportment suitable to the con ceived importance of his office, accosted Henry, when he was going to prayers, at the door of his chapel, in these words, Sta pedibus, Domine Rex. Dominus meus Gillapalriciotts, me mifit ad te, \u00a35* justt diccre, quod si non vi's castigare Pet rum Rufum, ipfe faciet belhtm contra te. In what manner the vain and imperious monarch received this address, or what were its consequences, we are not informed. Contests for the chief authority, with alternate success, were maintained by intrigue between the houses of Kildare and Ormond, till at length earl Gerald gained a decided preponderance, appointed to the place of governor with a plenitude of power, and apparently freed from all restraint by the dis grace of cardinal Wolsey, his foe, and by his re peated triumphs over his accusers. But the abuse of his prosperity proved the cause of his ruin. Justly alarmed at his violent conduct, the impartial friends of Englissi government united with the Butlers to transmit to the king a representation cf griev ances. Kildare was commanded to leave the reins of government in the hands of some person for whose actions he ssiould be responsible, and to repair immediately to his sovereign. Having in vain ex erted his utmost interest to evade this order, and being reduced to the alternative of obedience or open"], [973, "BRITISH ILANDS. 451 Chap, XI. Geraldine re.elli.n. 1.5 34, 1535, open rebellion, he resolved on the former. He left the administration to his son Thomas, and, contrary to the royal mandate, supplied his castles with arms and ammunition from the king's stores for defence against the apprehended retaliations of his enemies. Lord Thomas Fitzgerald, a youth of a captiva- ting person and endowments, but possessed of too high a notion of the power and consequence of his family, and rassi from inexperience, being scarcely twenty-one years of age, was misled by false news of his father's execution in England,- whence infla- med with resentment, he raised the standard of re- bellion. Entering the affrighted council, assembled in Saint-Mary's abbey in the capital, at the head of a hundred and forty armed men, he resigned the office of deputy, and declared himself the enemy of the Englissi monarch. When Cromer, the chancellor, primate of Armagh, seizing the youth by the hand, pathetically represented to him the rueful conse- quences of such an attempt, his followers, ignorant of the Englissi tongue, imagined the prelate's oration to be an encomium on their hero and his enter- prise : and a bard in his train, unwilling to be sur- passed in his particular province, chaunted in Irissi rhymes, acording to the ancient custom of the coun- try, the praises of the young leader, whom he styled the silken lord from his rich habiliments, chiding the delay of his martial exploits, and emphatically calling him to the field of glory. Whatever im pression might have been made by the sage admo nition of the primate was instantly effaced by the senseless rhapsody of an ignorant rhymer. Lord G g 2 Thomas"], [974, "452 HISTORY OF THE Chap, XL Thomas collected his forces and laid siege to the castle of Dublin. In attempting to escape from this fortress to England, Alan the archbissiop was mur dered by the insurgents. Receiving to his proposal of a coalition with the Butlers an answer of defiance, lord Thomas invaded their territories, defeated their troops, and ravaged their lands ; but he was alarmed by the movements of the Dublinians, who, having received assurances of assistance from England, closed their gates against his adherents, and made prisoners of those who were besieging the castle. Dublin was assailed, but the assailants were all repulsed ; and an agreement was at length made for the raising of the siege, and the liberation of prisoners on both sides. The next attempt of the insurgents was to prevent the debarcation of troops from England. A detach ment, which landed on the northern side of the har bour, was defeated, and all the men either killed or captured by lord Thomas, who was wounded by the commander in a brave defence. The rebels now planted their artillery on the promontory of Howth, which thundered on the vessels at anchor, and on others advancing with fressi supplies. Though a ssiip laden with horses was taken, and the rest were obliged to retire from the cannonade, Sir William Brereton effected his landing on the opposite ssiore with five hundred men, and was followed by the new deputy, Sir William Skeffington, with another band. By the noise of rejoicing, which announced the arrival of these succours in the city, the revolt ed lord, thought himself admonissied to retreat ; and"], [975, "BRITISH HANDS. 453 Chap XL and during some time after he remained inactive in the west. Hostilities recommenced in the following spring, when the strong castle of svlaynooth was taken from the rebels by the treachery of Pareis, a foster bro ther of lord Thomas, who having made no further stipulation than for a pecuniary recompence, was first with punctuality paid his price, and then hang* ed by Skeffington. The news of this conquest had such an effect on the forces of the revolted noble man, who was advancing at the head of seven thousand Irissi from Ulster and Connaught, that numbers deserted, and the rest, when they came to encounter the Englissi army near Naas, fled at the first discharge of the royal artillery. Unable any longer to keep the field, Fitzgerald retired into Munster, whither he was followed by a body of hostile troops under his relative lord Leonard Grey, who, unwilling to run unnecessary rissis proposed a treaty of submission, which was accepted by the rebel commander. On a solemn covenant for pardon lord Thomas dismissed his troops, attended Grey to Dublin, and was sent a prisoner to the tower of London, where he learned that his father had not been executed, but had died of a broken heart in consequence of Bis rebellion. His five uncles, three of whom had opposed the insurrection, were treacherously invited to a banquet by Grey, seized, and sent to London, where they were all executed together with their nephew.

The former were light troops armed with swords and javelins, and generally so ir- regular that kern and robber were sometimes sy- nonymous.

By an act of parliament the black rent was abolissied, and the king's forces in Ireland were declared suffi cient for the protection of his subjects : yet we find pensions continued, under other pretences, to Irissi toparchs.

Since the courfcil of Cassiel in i 172 the Irish church had remained in conformity with those of England and Rome. The miserable anarchy and confusion, the deplorable ignorance and barbarism of the Irissi of those times, precluded all rational discussion ; while the bulk of the people were naturally preju diced against innovations dictated from England, whose inhabitants they regarded as enemies ; besides that an opinion had taken deep root among them, that Ireland was a patrimony of the pope, and that consequently the Englissi monarch, whose predeces sors had originally claimed no other right to the dominion of this iland than what was derived from the papal authority, was, in the renunciation of the Roman supremacy, guilty of nefarious rebellion against his spiritual sovereign. An act of parliament was procured in conformity with the king's views, but every engine was employ ed to counteract its operation. The Irissi lords of Ulster rose in arms, under the conduct of O'Nial, as champions of the holy see. Their forces, having made an irruption toward the south, retired at the approach of the governor, lord Grey. They after ward made a stand, ajad were found formidably posted at the Bellahoe, on the borders of Meath, with a river in front.

But the important services of this governor received such a reward as might be expected from the ingratitude of a ty rant. Pursued by the enmity of the Butlers, and the zealots of the church, who were enraged at his activity in the promotion of the king's religious plans, he was committed to the tower of London on a variety of groundless and frivolous charges. Possessed with the most horrid apprehensions of Flen ry's violence, he declined a trial ; and, resigning his life and honour to the discretion of a merci- less despot, pleaded guilty and was beheaded. Meanwhile the government reaped the fruits of the unfortunate Grey's administration. Submission be came general among the toparchs. The earl of Desmond, whose boasted privileges were to be ex empt from attendance on parliaments, on governors, and from entering into any fortified town, renoun ced these imaginary rights, together with the papal supremacy, and gave his favourite son as a hostage to receive Englissi education. To forward still more this disposition among the Irissi, the title, of king of Ireland, instead of lord, was conferred in j 541, on the Englissi monarch by the Irissi parliament. Doubtless the novelty and splendour of the title had considerable influence, but causes unexplained must have had still greater, in producing an emulation for expressions of loyalty among the ancient natives and Flibernicized Englissi. Several dynasts received from the king titles of nobility.

In those districts of Munster and Connaught, which had been colonized by Englissi and formed into counties, but in which the laws of England had been in disuse during two centuries, some regula tions were ordered to be observed, of a mixed na ture between Englissi law and Irissi custom, for the gradual reformation of the inhabitants ; but these regulations lay totally dormant, as no officer of justice dared to attempt the execution of his office in these wild countries. The dynasts, who had received Englissi titles of nobility, were bound to hold their lands by military tenure in the feudal mode of England ; but ignorant or regardless of such a sys tem, they conceived not any diminution of their power over their vassals to arise from their new dignities, and they continued to govern by their Brehon law as formerly. For the extension of Englissi go vernment the reception of inferior toparchs, inde pendently of their superiors, under the royal pro tection, would have been expedient ; but so liberal a policy was not consistent with the views of those who had the chief influence in Ireland : insomuch that the petitions of some septs to be admitted into the Englissi jurisdiction were neglected or denied, particularly that of the O'Byrns, who requested that their territory ssiould be converted into an Englissi"], [980, "45 S HISTORY OF THE Chap.

Coming into Scotland in the reign of David the first, Walter became steward of that kingdom. The office attached to this title was hereditary, and was the highest under the crown in the financial, judicial, and military de- partments. Another Walter, his lineal descend- ant, the sixth in this line who held in succession this exalted post, was married to Marjory, the only daughter of his sovereign, king Robert Bruce.

The bor derers of the two countries made mutual incursions, and depredations were mutually committed on the sea. The castle of Berwick was taken by surprise by a body of Scots, who were afterwards overpower ed and put to the sword. The horrible ravages perpetrated in England, where a pestilence was raging, were punissied by the importation of the ma lady into Scotland, where a third of the inhabitants is said to have perissied by malignant distempers about this time. The French court, whose influence had fomented these hostilities, excited, after some respite, a war of much greater magnitude between the two British nations. On the expiration of a truce with Scotland, while one still subsisted with France, an army under the duke of Lancaster ravaged the country to the gates of Edinburg, but spared that capital, in which, on a former occasion, he had been hospitably enter tained. The Scots retaliated by a formidable incur sion, and the Englissi again wasted the south of Scotland. On the arrival of Jehan de Vienne, admiral of France, in the following year, with a large sum of money, twelve hundred complete suits of armour for Scottissi gentlemen, and a thousand men at arms, the Englissi territory between Berwick and Newcastle suffered the devastation of thirty thou sand Scots, who retired however on the approach of an Englissi army. King Richard in person, with all the force of his realm, advanced into the hostile country, destroying with fire and sword every thing"], [984, "HISTORY OF THE 462 Chap, XLI, 1388 1389 thing in his progress capable of destruction, even the religious houses which had in all former inva sions been spared, and consigning to conflagration the towns of Edinburg, Stirling, Perth, and Dun dee. Yet, by the failure of provisions, and the in telligence of an irruption made into England through the western borders by the Scots and French, he re turned home without the acquisition of any perma nent advantage. At the end of the campaign the French auxiliars, exhausted by fatigue and the mi serable food of Scotland, gladly returned home, de tested by the Scots on account of their dissimilar manners, in particular their gallantry. Notwith standing their assistance which they had given in personal service and in money, their departure was not permitted till they gave security for the payment of their maintenance while they remained in Scot land. After a variety of reciprocal inroads, an army of Scots, stated at forty thousand, took a defensive sta tion on the borders, while a select body under earl Douglas made a rapid incursion. Having wasted the open country to the gates of York, the invaders re treated, and were pursued by Henry Percy, styled Hotspur, and his brother Ralph. In a furious con flict at Otterburn, about thirty miles north west ward of Newcastle, Douglas received a mortal wound, but his troops were victorious, and the two Percies were made prisoners.

The Scots mostly retired before the in vading Englissi, removing their cattle, provisions, effects, and even the thatch of their cabins, into wilds and fastnesses. Their poverty was also such that their country afforded little matter of spoil. Their French auxiliars could hardly procure among them the slightest accommodations of life or even of war. Every article of iron and leather was import ed from the Netherlands. Their houses were only huts covered with thatch. Even Edinburg, their capital, was only a congeries of four thousand such cabins. Hence in wars of depredation more plunder probably accrued to the Scots than to the Englissi, but certainly national detriment in a far greater de- gree. The parts of Scotland exposed to Englissi devastation were the most fertile and populous, where otherwise wealth and civilization would have been progressive. Hence poverty and barbarism had en creased in that kingdom since the death of its king Alexander the third. But the northern parts only of England, where the land is most narrow, moun tainous, and barren, were liable to be infested, while the rest of the kingdom was little impeded by incur sions on that side in the progress of improvement. Of the permanence of the Scots in their hostility to the Englissi the vain attempts of the latter against France"], [986, "HISTORY OF THE 464 Chap XLI Robert the third. 1390 140t>, 1400 France were in a great degree the remote cause. By these attempts were the French monarchs obliged to court the alliance of Scotland, whose uncontroled nobility, even when the king was averse to war, ig norantly sacrificed the national prosperity to a fo reign interest. On the decease of Robert the second in the year 1390, the seventy-fifth of his age and the twentieth of his reign, he was succeeded by his eldest son under the assumed name of Robert the third, as his former name John was by the superstition of the age regarded as inauspicious for the regal dignity, on account of the unfortunate reigns of three kings of that appellation in England, France, and Scotland. This monarch had been lamed in his youth by a vicious horse, yet, fays Pinkerton, \" his person was tall and graceful. His florid countenance and viva cious eyes, joined with the snowy whiteness of his beard, rendered him an object at once pleasing and majestic. But his indolent meekness, his piety, his faint-like humility, are fitter themes of praise to the monk than to the philosopher, who knows that the virtues of a king are the virtues of ability and of action ; and that the most acceptable service to the Deity consists in the service of mankind. The lenity of Robert the third may be vindicated from the yet new elevation of a family accustomed to regard the nobles as equals and brothers : but it unhappily tend ed to encreasc the power of the aristociacy, and add to the consequent stock of public calamity.\" The reign of this weak prince was disgraced by intestine seuds, acts of atrocious violence, and de- feats"], [987, "BRITISH ILANDS. 465 Chap, XLI. Murders, 140L' feats from the Englissi, After a scries of ssiort truces, inroads into England were renewed, at the instigation of the French court, after the accession of Henry the fourth. That monarch with a numerous army, the last king of England who personally in vaded Scotland, advanced to Edinburg ; but when he had failed in his assaults on the castle of that city, and his offers of battle to the Scottissi forces, he re tired into his own kingdom. His lenity in this ex pedition was a contrast to the desolating fury of Richard his predecessor. M To the towns, villages, monasteries, and even fortresses, which submitted, he instantly sent a banner, painted with his arms, to be displayed as the fixed signal that none of his army ssiould approach them.\" Among the feuds of this reign I may notice that which had place between the Highland clans of Kay and Quhele, in 1396, the decision of which was left by agreement to a combat of two parties of thirty men on each side in pre sence of the king at Perth. The conflict maintained with bows, battleaxes, swords, and daggers, ended in the defeat of Clon Kay, on whose side only one was left alive, while eleven of the opponents kept the field. Of the numerous murders the most noted was that of the heir apparent of the kingdom, prince David, styled duke of Rothsay, eldest son of the king. The paternal uncle of this prince, created duke of Al bany in 1398, the first who, with Rothsay, bore the ducal title in Scotland, had been appointed governor of the kingdom in the decline of the late monarch, and held the chief influence in the weakness of the Vol. II.

The conduct of the young prince, which seems to have resembled that of Henry the fifth of England in his youth, was most foully misrepresented to his father by Albany, who seems to have been actuated by a base and malignant genius. By his machinations he at length obtained a royal order in writing for a temporary imprisonment of the prince, whose stubborn spirit, he said, might thus be cor rected. Consigning him to the charge of instru ments proper for his purpose, he caused him to be starved to death in the tower of Falkland. A dysen tery was declared to have caused his dissolution : a ssiam investigation was made in parliament : and to obviate every imputation a pardon in the amplest form was given to Albany. Another act with this may suffice to depict the disorderly state of affairs. Sir Malcolm Drummond, huiband of a lady who was in her own right countess of sVar, was suddenly seized in his castle by a band of ruffians, incarce rated, and so cruelly maltreated that he expired in confinement. No doubt was entertained that this murder was committed by Alexander Stuart, a na tural son of a brother of Albany, who, at the head of a predatory band of Highlanders, soon after forced the widowed countess to marry him, and, through the interest of his uncle, was confirmed in the possession of the earldom by charter.

On the decease of Robert the third in 1406, the seven teenth of his reign, and about the sixty-seventh of his age, Albany, who had already been virtually re gent, was formally vested with that office by parlia ment ; but the title of the heir, a captive in Eng land, was at the fame time acknowledged. The re gent studied to recommend his administration, \" not by promoting the public good, but by sharing the spoils of the monarchy with the nobles, by a patient connivance at their enormities, by a dazzling pomp of expenditure in the pleasures of the feast, and in the conciliation of munificence.\" Of deep dissimu lation he affected excessive zeal for the church. The first person burned for heresy in Scotland was James Resoy, an Englissi priest, a Wickliffite, who suffered at Perth, in 1408. An act of a very different na ture was the foundation of the university of Saint Andrews, in 141 2, by Henry Wardlaw its bissiop, the first ever founded in this kingdom. Albany ex pired in 1419, at an age exceeding eighty years, and was succeeded in the office of regent by Murdac his son, a man of too indolent and mild a disposition for holding the reins of government. Conscious of his own inability, or unable to with stand the public wissi, the regent consented to a ne gociation with England for the liberation of prince James, and his establissiment on the Scottissi throne. The prince was married to an Englissi lady, a niece of Richard the second.

But from national poverty the rest of this debt remained ever undischarged. After a captivity of nineteen years, James the first ascended the throne of his ancestors in the thirtieth year of his age, re commended by every advantage, which natural ta lents, and the best education which England then afforded could bestow. \" In person he was rather under the middle size, but endued with such firm ness and agility as to excel in every manly exercise. But his mental abilities were yet more conspicuous. A man of science and learning, an excellent poet, a master of music, the fame of his accomplissimenis reflected glory even on the throne. Illustrious in every personal virtue, free from any personal vice, his very amusements adorned his character; his hours of leisure being frequently dedicated to ele gant writing and miniature painting, to mechani cal arts, and to the cultivation of the garden and the orchard.\" Educated in the school of adversity and literature, this monarch was eminently qualified for the function of governor, and made extraordinary exertions for the enforcement of order. But, as Pinkerton has observed, \" to a people who had lived for half a century under a loose and delegated government, and who had been accustomed to regard licence as liberty, it is no wonder that the punissiment of crimes seemed quite a new and strange cruelty : that a salu tary strength of government appeared despotism : that a necessary and legal taxation assumed the ftape of tyrannic extortion. The commons, led by the nobles,"], [991, "BRITISH ILAXDS. 469 Chap, XLI V__^Y-V_; 1425, nobles, absurdly regarded the cause of the latter as their own, and saw not that the king in crussiing the aristocracy was doing the most essential service to his people. The plans of James were sagacious and pro found, but sometimes incur the charge of temerity ; and while they partake of the greatness of genius, they are limited by the want of a sufficient power in the Scottissi monarchy for their complete execution. In a word James is fully intitled to the uncommon character of a great sovereign in the arts of govern ment and of peace.\" The reign of this prince was almost entirely oc cupied in the holding of parliamentary conventions, and the enacting and enforcing of laws. By the Scots of that age laws appear to have been hardly otherwise regarded than as theoretic precepts, which might be obeyed or neglected according to conveni ence. To reduce the exorbitant power of the house of Albany, which had been so abused to the na tional detriment, was one of the earliest objects of his policy. With cautious but decisive boldness the obnoxious persons were seized and their trials insti tuted. The jury consisted of twenty-one members of parliament, who were considered as the arbitra tors of both fact and law, while the king, who fat as judge, was only the organ of their verdict. The late regent Murdac, two of his sons, and his father in-law, Duncan, earl of Lenox, were condemned and beheaded. Their estates, confiscated to the crown, served in some degree to compensate the defalcation of the royal property made under the regents. Another"], [992, "4 .0 Chap, XLI. 1427 1429 431 rans- with Juiglaiid 14.3 43 HISTORY OF THE Another object was to repress the disorderly chiefs of the Highlands and Hebudes. The chief of the latter, called lord of the iles, acted as an indepen dent prince, and was often an ally of England against the Scottissi monarchy. In a parliament convened at Inverness above fifty leaders of lawless clans were suddenly arrested. Some were put to death. Some after a confinement were set at liberty. Alexander, lord of the iles, irritated by a long imprisonment, took arms against the king, in some time after his liberation, and burned the town of Inverness. On the approach of James with a formidable force, two clans deserted to the royal standard, and Alexander was routed near Lochaber. Reduced to despair, \" he came privately to Edinburg, and, on a solemn day, only attired in his shirt and drawers, he, be fore the high altar of Holyrood church, upon his knees presented his drawn sword to the king, in the presence of the queen and many nobles. His life was granted,\" but his person was secured under the custody of his nephew, the earl of Angus. Anarchy however still prevailed in the Highlands. Thus An gus Duff and Angus -Moray, two heads of clans delivered from imprisonment, met in conflict with twelve hundred men on each side, with such obsti nate fury, that scarcely nine of the whole are said to have been left alive. Peace by long truces was maintained with Eng land without neglecting the alliance with France.

When the business was discussed v. parliament, the monkissi members, the abbots, caused such confu sion by making the affair a subject of scholastic dis pute, that the assembly dispersed without any deter mination. The English proposals were thus virtu ally rejected, and the marriage was above two years after solemnized. As the Entilish attenuated to in tercept the princess on her voyage to France, James, irritated by this, and by an incursion of a small band into his borders, resolved on war. Summoning the whole army of his kingdom, he laid siege to Jedburg ; but, after fifteen days of ineffectual efforts, he was obliged from causes not explained, to dismiss his unwieldy host. This monarch, in passing at first through Scotland on his way to assume the reins of government, is said thus to have expressed his determination for the enforcement of order ; \" by the help of God, though I ssiould myself lead the life of a dog, 1 ssiall make the key keep the castle, and the bussi secure the cow.\" To his perseverance in this resolution he at length fell a martyr. Enraged by imprisonment, Sir Robert Grah*am, after his enlargement, proposed in an assemby of nobles to represent their grievances to the king, and obtained a promise of their support. Exceeding his commission, he, in 1435, audaciously arrested his sovereign in parliament ; but not being supported, he was driven into banishment, and all his property was forfeited to the crown. From the remotest Highlands he sent in writing a defiance to James"], [994, "HISTORY OF THE 472 Chap XLI. State of Sco-land, James and a menace of assassination. By proclamation a great reward was offered for the securing of his body either alive or dead. But he too easily found malcontents to join him in a conspiracy, even among the domestics of the royal household. By the assist ance of those he was admitted at night, with three hundred followers, into the palace at Perth, in the February of 1437. The king expired under many wounds, but the queen escaped. By her exertions all the chief actors were taken in less than a month, and were put to death with horrible tortures. After the murder of this excellent monarch in the forty-fourth year of his age, and the thirteenth of his actual reign, Scotland, which had begun to as sume a face of order and prosperity, relapsed into its former state of anarchy and barbarism. The country had been already denuded of wood. The fewel was turf or fossile coal. The towns were destitute of walls ; and, except the castles or sortalices of the great, the houses were commonly built of earth, roofed with sods or thatch, and furnissied with no other door than art aperture covered with a cow's hide. The mode of life was chiefly pastoral. Oats and barley were almost the only grain. The vari- ous preparations of milk formed the principal food. Fissi, or meat boiled with oatmeal, supplied more solemn meals. Shirts were almost unknown even to the great. The legs and feet of the common people were bare. The head was covered with a woollen bonnet or a hat of bassietwork or felt. A doublet, cloke, and a kind of trowse constituted their dress. Females wore a kerchief or hood, a tippet about the neck,"], [995, "BRITISH ILANDS. 4?J neck, and a kirtle or close gown; rarely either a Chap. pettycoat or mantle. The nobles differed not greatly XLL from-those of England. That of war was their only science ; hunting their sole amusement ; and their chief magnificence a numerous train. The peers or great barons, hardly more than twenty in number, were severally monarchs within their own estates, To them, not to the sovereign, belonged the soldiers in war ; and by them, with their associates in par liament, was peace or hostility with foreign states determined ; while to the king was left the summon ing of parliaments, the administration of justice when practicable, the conferring of dignities, the command of the national array, and the nomination to preferments in the church. To the deceased monarch succeeded his only son, Jam\u00ab the James the second, in the sixth year of his age. Of ' the reign of this prince, fays Pinkerton, *'\u2022 no ori- 1400. ginal and authentic history remains ; and at a period when we might expect a light so strong as to illumi nate the minutest features of action and of charac ter, a kind of twilight surrounds us, in which only a few large objects can be discerned.\" The regency seems to have been at first in the hands of the queen with a select council, in which the two principal per- sons were Sir William Crichton the chancellor, and Sir Alexander Livingston, keeper of the young king's person, but to have been afterwards relinquished by her to these gentlemen. The character of James, when he arrived at manhood, appears to have been not much inferior to that of his father. He was ro bust in person, but a red tinge, which deformed one of"], [996, "HISTORY OF THE 474 Chap XLI House of Douglas. of his cheeks, acquired him the appellation of James with the fiery face. \"His actions proclaim him a prince of decisive, and sometimes even violent spirit. In war he was a valiant and popular leader ; and surpassed his father in a marked attention to military discipline. Negligent of pomp, the equal of every soldier, he soared the mean repast of the march, confident that poison is seldom administered in vessels of wood, reposing absolute faith in the love of his people. The power of his abilities, the excellence of his intentions in peace, are best displayed by the laws of his reign. His wisdom appears conspicuous in his reverence for the counsels of the wise, in guid ing his most important actions by the experience of Crichton and the benign and patriotic prudence of Kennedy,\" bissiop of Saint Andrews. But in the long time which elapsed between his accession and maturity of age, the kingdom was convulsed with most violent disorders, chiefly by the turbulence of the house of Douglas. From Chalmers we find that the progenitor of the house of Douglas, which produced se many heroes, and contended at length with that of Stuart for the crown of Scotland, was Theobald a Fleming, to whom Arnold, abbot of Kelso, made a grant of some lands on Douglas-water in Lanerkssiire, in the year 1150. Surnamed from his lands, according to the custom of the age, the son of Theobald was de nominated William de Duvglas or Douglas. From his services to Robert Bruce in the fourteenth cen tury, Sir James, the then existing head of this stock, rose into the peerage. By grants and marriages their estates"], [997, "BRITISH ILANDS. 475 Chap XLI. 1440, 1444. 1 145, 1644 1149 estates and revenues were augmented to almost an equality with those of the crown. With an arrogance of spirit, concomitant with his vast possessions and in experienced youth, William, earl of Douglas, in his sixteenth year, acted as an independent monarch, in the minority of James the second, to the terror of the regency. The remedy adopted, in the weakness of government, was wicked and ineffectual. The earl, with his brother David, and an adherent named Fleming, was inveigled into the castle of Edinburg, and, after a ssiam trial, beheaded. The next male heir, a peaceable man, died two years after ; and his turbulent son was permitted to re-unite, by a marriage with a cousin, the estates of this formida ble family. d This earl, named William, when the king, in approaching his fourteenth year, took into his own hands the reins of government, became his greatest favourite, and the director of his counsels. Crich ton and Livington, who, with their adherents, were dismissed from office, took refuge in the castles of Edinburg and Stirling. The parliament denounced them rebels, and their estates forfeited. On con ditions very advantageous to himself, which were strictly observed, Crichton surrendered ; but the fa mily of Livington was cruelly depressed by fines and executions. At length, acquiring a riper judgment, and influenced by the good sense of his queen, Mary, daughter of the duke of Gelders, whom he married in 1449, James adopted the salutary resolution of abridging the power of Douglas, which had been ssiockingly abused to the destruction of all order. Enraged"], [998, "476 HISTORY OF THE Chap XLI 1452, 1452 1454, Enraged at the loss of his influence at court, earl William entered into a treasonable correspondence with the Englissi, and formed in Scotland a most dangerous association, while he continued to perpe trate devastations and murders in open defiance of the royal authority. Thus one of his vassals, named Maclelan, was contumelioufly beheaded by him, in spite of a supplicatory letter from the king in his fa vour, for having refused to join the earl in his law less engagements. According to the advice of a chosen council, Douglas was enticed to the castle of Stirling where the king held his court. Taking him apart after supper, James mildly informed him that his illegal association was known, and requested him to renounce it. On his insolent refusal the king in a rage stabbed him with his dagger, and Sir Patrick Gray, uncle to the murdered Maclelan, dispatched him with a battleax. Commotions, raised by the relatives and adherents of the deceased, were soon suppressed, particularly by a bloody defeat of the earl of Crawford at Brechin. Earl James, the brother and successor of William, signed an instrument of submission to the royal au\u00ab thority, and the country was reduced to an unusual state of peace. Yet, in two years afterwards, earls Moray and Ormond, brothers of this new earl Douglas, raised a rebellion in the north, but were driven by lord Huntley to the Hebudes, whence they soon returned to the south to join in a most for midable insurrection in that quarter. From ambition, or perhaps a dread of total depression under the royal power, the present earl had formed a league with the"], [999, "BRITISH ILAND-S. 477 Chap XLI 1455 Transac- tions with England. 1438, 1460, the Yorkists of England, had thence been supplied with money, and had determined to come with ad verse force to a full trial of strength with his sove^ reign. Alarmed at the assembling of a hostile army, which consisted chiefly of borderers, the best troops of Scotland, the king retired by sea to Saint-Andrews, and even, in despair, was entertaining a design of abandoning his kingdom, until he recovered courage from the suggestions of bissiop Kennedy. In conse quence of proclamations for the armed array of the northern counties, with promises of amnesty to all who ssiould join his standard, he ssiortly sound a force of forty thousand men collected around him, with which he marched against Douglas, who had taken post with nearly an equal number on the southern side of the river Carron. Douglas imme diately advanced against the royal host ; but, when he saw its strength, and imagined some signs of dis- may or disaffection among his own troops, he defer- red the battle to the following day. By the practices cf Kennedy lord Hamilton deserted in the night to the king. Alarmed at this defection, and dis- trusting one another, the rest of the chiefs dissiand- ed. Finding in the morning his camp a desert, Douglas fled, and lurking some time on the borders, took refuge at length in England. His partizans were every where suppressed, and the exorbitant power of the house of Douglas was for ever fallen. The honourable protection afforded in England to the rebel chief added much to the resentment already excited in the Scottissi monarch against the house of York. Truces with that kingdom had been"], [1000, "HISTORY OF THE 478 Chap, been made and renewed since the beginning of this _ X^_. reign, but infractions had been committed by the borderers, perhaps on both sides. We are told by Scottissi writers of a later time that a great victory was gained by their compatriots at the river Sark in Annandale in 1448, of which no notice is found in Englissi history. After various negocia tions and petty hostilities, James with a great army, after the flight of Douglas, ravaged Northumber- 14.36. land. Truces again succeeded ; but the king, per- haps to assist the Lancastrians of England, collected in 1460 a numerous host, and laid siege to the castle of Roxburg, which had long remained in the Death of hands of the English.

The regency seems to have been managed some years by the queen and bissiop Kennedy. The former died in 1463, and the latter in 1466. I have already taken notice of the transactions of this court with the Lancastrians of England. A truce with that kingdom was adjusted in 1463, and afterwards renewed for the vain period of fifty-four years.

In the success of adulation Robert lord Boyd, with his relative, gained a decisive superiority. With seeming force they carried the king from Linlithgow to Edinburg, and caused him to dismiss from his presence all those who had been placed about his person by authority of parliament, in violation of a statute which had declared such an act altogether treasonable. They were solemnly pardoned by the young monarch, and promoted to places of the highest authority. The eldest sister of the king, who had been affianced to the son of Henry the sixth of England, was given in marriage to Sir Thomas, the son of lord Boyd ; and the earl dom of Arran was conferred on her hussiand. Alterations were made in the value of money. Of this subject 1 shall treat in my third volume.

By a late survey their number is stated at sixty-seven, of which only twenty-nine are inha bited. The rest, called holms, are small and con- signed to pasturage. Beside these we find a number of sterries, rocky ilets, liable to be over- flowed at high water. The area of the whole group may amount nearly to the quantity of two hun- dred and fifty thousand acres. They are destitute of trees, but bear evident vestiges of former woods. The soil, mixed with calcareous particles, is fertile, though ssiallow. They are in general high and pre- cipitous toward the west, but slope toward the east, and sink into plains. Only four of the Hands are"], [1003, "BRITISH 1LANDS. 481 Chap XLII W^ are mountainous. The temperature is mild ; but during about fourteen days in the middle of June a wind from the north brings hail and snow, caused perhaps by the melting and evaporation of the ice in the northern ocean. The inhabitants, a mixed progeny of Norwegians and Lowland Scots are at present in number about twenty-four thousand. Far the greatest of the Orkney's is Pomona or Mainland, thirty miles in length, in breadth very various, consisting of two peninsulas connected by an isthmus one mile broad. This iland is furnissied with four harbours, on one of which stands Kirkwall the chief town, on another that of Stromnefs ac cessible only from the sea. South-Ronaldssia, seven miles long, from one to five broad, is the nearest of all to the great iland of Britain. To the south west of this lies the small ile of Swinna, remark able for two dangerous whirlpools on its, south western coast, called the wells of Swinna., caused by tides and eddies in the ssiallow water. Hoy, ten miles long, from five to one broad, is at high tides divi ded into two ilands, the southern named Waes or Walls, and the northern Hoy. The latter is the most mountainous tract in the Orkneys. Its highest eminence, also the highest in the whole group, is called the Wart-hill, elevated five hun dred and forty yards above the ocean. Sanda, twelve miles in length, in medial breadth about two, is deeply and irregularly indented, yet destitute of good harbours.

The iles of Shetland, situate about twenty leagues north-eastward of the Orkneys, and forty-four west of Norway, are supposed to consist of twenty-seven inhabited ilands, beside above thirty holms and forty ssierries, and to contain in area near seven hundred thousand Englissi acres. They resemble the Orkneys in their precipitous elevations on the west, their sloping toward the east, their tempera ture, and general face ; but are more wild, and somewhat more mountainous. This most northern portion of the insular system of Britain enjoys, during more than two months about the summer solstice, almost continual day ; the inhabitants being able by the twilight alone to read at midnight when the sky is clear. In the opposite season almost continual night involves the heavens during an equal space ; and a tedious winter of seven or eight months, dark and tempestuous, precludes the Shet landers from any intercourse with other countries during most of that time. Yet in this dreary sea son they have some comforts. Among these we may reckon the Aurora Borealis, which often illuminates the ssiy in a manner inexpressively beau tiful. The people are of the fame kind with those of the Orkneys, and their number seems nearly the fame also. Here, as in the former group, the central and greatest ile is Mainland, above fifty miles long, but so indented as to form a knot of peninsulas, in which hardly any spot is two miles distant from the sea. By these inlets are furnissied twenty har bours, six of which are remarkably commodious. Lerwick,"], [1005, "43:, Chap XL4I History 83 1st? 8, BRITISH ILANDS.

Three ridges of hills run longitudinally through the country, of which the highest is Ronas in the north-west, rising five hun dred yards above the ocean. The second ile in size is Yell, sixteen miles long, five or six broad, extremely mountainous and boggy, indented with eight con siderable harbours and many creeks. The most northern of all the British system is Unst, eight miles in length, four in breadth, and furnissied with two excellent harbours. The Orkneys, known to the Romans under the name of Orcades, were visited by the fleet of Agricola about the year 83, but so late as the year 240 they are described by Solinus as uninhabi ted.

If Celts were the first inhabitants, they were pro bably exterminated. The Orkneys, perhaps also Shetland, became the haunts of pyratic Saxons and Other maritime tribes, who infested with predatory visits the Roman province of Britain.

XLII Annexion of them to Scotland. 14-lJS HISTORY OF THE reignty over him he appeared to acknowledge. Soon after the reduction of all the provinces of Norway under Harald Harfagre about the year 875, that monarch, pursuing the pirates into their retreats, conquered these two insular groups, and delegated his power over them to Sigurd, the first who bore the title of earl of Orkney. After Sigurd ensued a long succession of earh, who, amid piracies and dissentions, yielded probably not more than a slight subjection to the Norwegian kings. We find that another Sigurd, the fourteenth earl, who succeeded in 996, held the command of Cathnefs, Sutherland, the coasts of Ross and Mur ray, and a tribute from the Hebudes. His suc cessors appear to have maintained a similar ascen dency, and to have acted almost as independent, until Magnus Barefoot, king of Norway, in 1098, subdued the ilands, and establissied his dominion. The Orkneys and Shetland thence remained subject to the Norwegian monarchy till the year 1468, when they were transferred to the crown of Scotland. The annual of Norway, the yearly sum payable from the Scottissi to the Norwegian crown for the Hebudes, which I have noted in my twenty-fourth chapter, was in the fourteenth century suffered to accumulate. The penalties demanded for the ne glect of payment arose with the arrears to a sum of considerable magnitude. When this was required with menaces by the king of Denmark, to whom Norway was then subject, the king of France, in 1460, recommended a marriage between the daugh- ter"], [1007, "BRITISH ILANDS. 485 Chap.

The con clusion of a treaty to this purpose was prevented by the death of James the second. The negociation was renewed with success in the reism of his sue- o eessor. By the articles of marriage between James the third and Margaret of Denmark, daughter of Christiern the first, the annual of Norway was re nounced forever, and the iles of Orkney and Shet land were pledged for a part of the bride's dower, by the non-payment of which they remained ever since annexed to Scotland, to which by their situa tion they naturally belonged. This treaty was doubtless forwarded by the Scottissi family of Sinclair, to whom the earldom of Orkney had devolved by inheritance through a female line. To favourable circumstances, not to an energetic spirit in James the third, are this and other acqui- sitions aseribable, which accrued to Scotland in the early part of his reign. His stature was tall, his hair black, his face oval and adust- He was elegant in person, weak in mind. He had too great attachment to favourites, was avaricious, ca- pricious, extremely fond of architecture and music, inclined to cultivate the literature of the age and to indulge himself in retirement from affairs of state, but so little benefited by hi* speculations as to be much addicted to superstition and astrology.

The highest places in his savour were acquired by artizans, whose professional merit he might have amply rewarded, without ex- alting them invidiously beyond their sphere into political consequence to the excitement of envious rage among the proud nobility. To the influence of these artizens is attributed the fall of his two bfo- thers, Alexander and John, of whom the former had been created duke of Albany, the latter earl of Mar. Accused of magical practices against the king's life, these princes were seized and commit- ted to prison. Albany effected an escape into France : but Mar was put to death without a public trial.

After some renewals of a truce, and partial infractions on the borders and on sea, a treaty On more solid grounds was concluded in 1774. In this a marriage was contracted be tween the heir of the Scottissi crown and Cecilia* the youngest daughter of Edward the fourth of England, both infants. Her portion was fixed at twenty thousand marks, payable! in yearly sums of two thousand each. But the Englissi monarch, after a third payment, despising the fenmity of Scotland, when he had made a permanent peace with France, discontinued the pension, and at length waged a war, in which he appears to have been the aggressor.

Both parties however soon again prepared for the decision of arms. The conspirators meanwhile had strengthened their interest, and had obtained possession of the person of the young prince. The two adverse armies met about a mile to the south of the famous Bannockburn on the eighteenth of June. The rebel host appears to have been more numerous j but the king took flight be fore a judgment could be formed of the event of battle, and his troops declined the defense of a deserted cause. By the starting of his horse, while fae fled with rapidity, at the sight of a woman's pitcher left in the way, he fell, and was greatly bruised, at Miltown on Bannockburn. He was carried to a mill where he called for a priest. On intelligence of this a priest of the rebel party re paired to his bed, heard his confession, and then stabbed him to death. On the decease of James the third, in the thirty sixth year of his age and twenty-eighth of his reign, his son, James the fourth, aged sixteen as cended the throne. As the new monarch soon at tained maturity in corporal strength and intellect, his character remained not a long time dubious. He was of a middle stature, robust, and of an elegant appearance. Fie excelled in horsemanssiip and other exercises. He also excelled in music. From a neglected education he was ignorant of set ters, but his mind was acute. He was in a high degree possessed of popular qualities. He was generour-,"], [1013, "BRITISH ILANDS. 491 chap. XLII, v_^w_/ generous, munificent, a patron of useful arts, and strongly actuated by a romantic spirit of chivalry. Yet some of his qualities were rather specious than solid. In the high regal duties of a politician and of a general he was extremely defective ; his natural impetuosity predominating alike in his smaller pursuits and in hi. most important affairs.\" The superstitious devotion, which was generally inherent in his family, was augmented in him by remorse for his father's murder, in the prelude to which he had been made an involuntary instru ment. The mass was every day one of his chief offices, and he wore constantly in penance an iron girdle, the weight of which he encreased with his years. But whatsoever may have been his weak ness, he won the hearts cf his subjects by his love of justice, his affability, his gentleness, and patience in listening to admonition, and even to re proach. His government appears to have been as propi tious to his people as that of any monarch adminis tering through the medium of a feudal aristocracy could be supposed. Regarding fidelity to his father as a pledge of a similar attachment to himself, he extended his favour equally to those who had op posed his premature elevation to the throne as to those who had caused it. This conduct was produc tive of internal tranquillity, as it conciliated the sup port of the nobles, the leaders of all the lower classes of the nation. Instead of mean favourites, his court was crouded with peers, \" whose hereditary wealth at"], [1014, "HISTORY OF THE 492 Chap, XLII at least exempted them from the baseness of avarice, and the atrocity of vulgar oppression.

Sometimes he would travel, dis guised and unknown, through a great part of his king dom, and lodge in the hovels of the poor, where he would provoke the voice of truth, so odious to royal tars, by questions concerning his own character and conduct, without any dread or anxiety at thus learn ing his reputation from the universal voice.\" His court, magnificent beyond his revenue, was famous throughout Europe for the exhibitions of tourna ments and other martial exercises. Amid the gene ral applause his faults were overlooked, though his gallantry was such, that, beside a number of other amours, three ladies of noble rank produced to him pledges of his amorous attention. Happily from the domestic tranquillity of Scot land, in which the king's administration of justice was impartial and lenient, little matter is afforded For internal history in this reign, except affairs of civil government, of which a general view will here after be token. The period of his dominion is as serted to have been that of the greatest wealth and power of this kingdom whilst it remained a separate state. To the formation of an armed navy he gave such attention as to possess at length a respectable fleet."], [1015, "BRITISH ILANDS. 493 Chap XLII Minority of James the fifth. 1513 15 '28 fleet, one of the ships of which, named the Great Michael, seems to have been the largest at that time in the seas of Europe. By his naval force he was enabled to render himself master of the Hebudes, which had hitherto actually continued independent of the Scottissi monarchy. Alexander the third had only acquired over them a nominal superiority : but now, in 1503, by the forfeiture of Donald, a spurious chief who had usurped the title of lord of the iles, they became the indisputable property of the crown. The royal influence was by this event extended also over the Highlands, whose clans had been accustom ed to regard the insular lords as their only sove reigns. The transactions of James with England I have related already. Of his war with Henry the seventh, to whose daughter Margaret he was mar ried in 1503, I have given an account in my thirty fifth chapter, and of his death at the battle of Flod den, in the year 15 13, in my thirty-sixth. James the fourth was in the forty-first year of his age and the twenty-sixth of his reign, when he fell, in 1513, in the field of Flodden. He left only one legitimate child, a son not quite eighteen months old, who succeeded him under the name of James the fifth. Great beyond conception was the conster nation of the Scots on intelligence of the dreadful overthrow of their forces, the slaughter of their king and of their prime nobility : but they were saved from conquest, were permitted to respire, and even at length to resume courage, from the circumstances of England engaged in a fruitless continental war. Distracted,"], [1016, "HISTORY OF THE 494 Chap. XI.1I. 1514, 1515 Distracted, however, by the intrigues of foreign courts, Scotland became a prey to anarchy and fac tion. Two parties were formed, the one in the French, the other in the Englissi interest, who con tended for power with fluctuating and indecisive suc cess. The Englissi monarch, Henry the eighth, had over France the advantage of proximity of situation in this contest of influence ; but was prevented from effectually availing himself of it by his domineering spirit, which would stoop to no soothing arts, and by his prodigality, which disabled him from afford ing sufficient sums to his partisans. Deplorable from the dissolution of government was the state of the country. Ravages, conflagrations, and murders were almost incessantly perpetrated. Often were men of rank openly assassinated, even in the streets of Edin burg, in defiance of every law. The young and beautiful dowager queen Margaret was appointed regent : but too apt to give way to the strength of passion, in like manner as her bro ther, Henry of England, ssie was deprived of that office, according to her husoand's will and the law of the country, in consequence of her imprudent marriage with the young earl of Angus. After a series of desultory inroads, which desolated the bor ders, peace was made with England. John, duke of Albany, son to that duke who had fled into exile from James the third, was by invitation brought from France to undertake the regency. This noble man, born of a French lady, was by birth, educa tion, and national attachment, wholly a Frenchman. He"], [1017, "BRITISH ILANDS. 495 He could speak no other language than that of Chap. France ; and he still regarded himself as a subject of XL1L that kingdom, and his regency of Scotland only as provincial. The character of his administration is thus stated by Pinkerton. \" It was artful yet weak, profuse yet unfriended, tyrannic yet insufficient : while love and attachment were estranged by caprice, fear and awe were not supported by uniform rigour : opiniative obstinacy disconcerted the prudence of friends, and prevented the conciliation of enemies.\" He soon, by the authority of parliament, rendered himself master of the young king's person, and caused such terror to Margaret that ssie fled into England. Angus, who accompanied the queen in her flight, 151S. finding himself unsupported by Henry, made his peace with the regent and returned home. This de sertion, with his amorous infidelities, excited a last ing aversion in his consort. Counteracted in his go- 1517, vernment, Albany retired to France, leaving, by compromise, the regency to a council composed of the two factions, but still retaining for himself the title of regent. Little exertion of foreign influence is perceived in the next four years ; but dissensions continued between the factionists of the duke and those of the queen, who returned to Scotland. But, 1521. disgusted by. her brother's neglect:, this high spirited princess at length deserted the Englissi interest, and formed a coalition with Albany, who in consequence again made his appearance in Scotland.

In this war, undertaken in conjunction with France, the regent led to the borders an army of eighty thousand, perhaps the best appointed of all ever arrayed by the Scots. Terror pervaded the north of England, quite unprovided against his me naced invasion : but lord Dacre, warden of the marches, worked so on his timidity by feigning the approach of a formidable host of Engsissi, that he agreed to a truce and to the disoanding of his array. Stung with the disgrace of this affair, and meditat ing revenge, Albany again repaired to France, where he solicited assistance in stores, troops, and money. With such aids the duke returned in the following year to Scotland, the south-eastern parts of which were desolated by the Englissi. With a force of sixty thousand, of whom above four thousand were French, he advanced to the hostile border, and laid siege to Wark ; but, on the approach of lord Sur rey at the head of fifty thousand, he sounded a re* treat, and his army fled in confusion, and dispersed. Mortified, and unable to maintain his power, he took his final departure to France in six months af ter. Margaret recovered the young king, her son, and her party gained the ascendant. With England was made a truce, which was afterwards repeatedly prolonged ; but the queen, offended by Henry and his minister, negociated for an alliance with France, and opposed a proposal of marriage between her son and the princess Mary of England. She procured a divorce from Angus, who had returned home after a long"], [1019, "BRITISH ILANDS. 497 Chap XLII, 1528 Actual reign of James the fifth. 1528, 1542, long absence in France ; and ssie married Henry Stuart, created afterwards lord Methven. Angus, becoming the head of the Englissi party, obtained possession of the king's person, and exercised the so vereign power. Scot of Buccleugh was defeated, and the earl of Lenox slain, in their attempts to res cue the young monarch from his durance. In the battle against Lenox, a violent brother of Angus thus spoke to the king ; \" should our enemies van quissi, rather than surrender your person, we ssiould tear you in halves.\" This cruel speech was never forgotten by James, who afterwards effected his escape by a stratagem, drove Angus and his adhe rents into exile, and confiscated their estates. Thus after its second dangerous elevation fell finally the house of Douglas. James the fifth commenced his actual government in his seventeenth year. His character, which be came in a ssiort time fully developed, bears in his tory the stamp of excellence. In person he was of a middle size, robust, active, of an elegant ssiape, with an oval face, blue piercing eyes, yellow hair, an aquiline nose, and a small beard forked in the then existing fassiion. His countenance and whole appearance impressed the idea of sweetness joined with majesty. To an education spoiled by flattery, the common lot of princes, he rose superior by the force of intellect. He was acute in discernment, ex pert in the offices of civil and judicial administration, warm in affection, stern to the nobles, and so fa vourable to the lower classes, whom he endeavoured Vol. II.

A propensity to vaj'.ue amours was one of his few vices, which were such as gave no interruption to the public hap piness. Among his virtues was temperance with re spect to food and liquors. Truly arduous was the object of this youthful mo narch, the re-establishment of order in a nation long habituated to outrageous contempt of law ; the re covery of the royal estates, and of the strength of his kingdom, dilapidated in his minority. Against the aristocracy, whose usurpations were baneful, he bore a fixed aversion, and attached himself closely to the eminent ecclesiastics, who alone could balance the weight of the nobles, and surpassed them far in eloquence and political skill. To this, to no bigo try in him, seems justly aseribable the persecution of protestants hereafter to be noticed. He executed vengeance on plunderers, particularly on a clan near the borders headed by a chief named John Arm strong. Having reduced his subjects on the main land to order, and created a new fleet to replace the old, which had perissied by neglect, he visited the Orkney and Hebude ilands in 1540, confirming in their loyalty the inhabitants of the former, and re ducing to obedience those of #ue latter, whose law- less"], [1021, "BRITISH ILANDS. 499 Chap.

By liberal wages, and even pensions, artisans from the neighbouring countries were enticed to settle among his subjects. His care was extended even to the melioration of the breed of cattle, particularly horses, of which he im ported many from the countries of the Baltic. From the imperious conduct of his uncle, Henry of England, particularly in the support afforded to the family of Douglas, by whom he had been re tained in captivity, this monarch had contracted an unfavourable disposition toward the Englissi interest, and considered himself so situated as to be obliged to cultivate the French alliance. With England however he maintained a pacific intercourse till the last year of his reign, except one interruption, m which the English borderers seem to have been the aggressors. Without any formal declaration of the two monarchs a war was waged between their sob* jects by reciprocal incursions, with the utmost fero city, from the latter part of the year 1532 till the following May, when a truce was ordained, and afterwards a solemn peace, by the mediation of France. The alliance of James with that kingdom was strengthened by a matrimonial connexion.

The first act of this regency was a departure from the system ordained by the deceased despot, who had expected to reign even after his death. This was the appointment of a protector, who ssiould represent in his person the ma jesty of the monarch, without the exercise of autho rity independent of the guardians. This office was conferred on the duke of Somerset, maternal uncle to the young king, a humane protestant of good in tention, but destitute of the firmness necessary to a ruler in his delicate situation. Not content with so limited a jurisdiction, the duke procured a patent from"], [1025, "BRITISH ILANDS. 503 Chap XLIII. Affairs of Scotland. 1542 1550, 1543 from the minor sovereign, by which he was vested with more ample power. Notwithstanding this usur pation, his measures were moderate. A plan was soon formed, and its execution begun, for the gra dual abolition of the Romish, and the establishment of the reformed religion. Political improvements were also meditated ; but from the internal adminis tration of the realm the protector was for a time withdrawn by a war with the Scots. On the untimely death of James the fifth of Scot land, whose only legitimate offspring was a daughter, named Mary, one week old, the regency had been seized, under a forged will of the deceased monarch, by cardinal Beton, a prelate of immoderate ambi tion, great abilities, address, and refinement : but, by the unanimous resolution of the nobles, he had been soon deprived of that office, and James Hamil ton, earl of Arran, next heir to the crown after Mary, constituted regent, a man unambitious and mild, but unfit for the place from his timidity. On intelligence of the Scottissi king's decease, Henry had immediately formed the wise design of uniting the two British kingdoms by the marriage of his son Edward with the princess Mary, and had engaged the nobles captured at the rout of Solway, whom he liberated on this occasion, to second his proposal : but by his rassi and imperious conduct he had rendered the scheme abortive. His demand, that the person of the young queen, and the government of her kingdom during her minority, ssiould be immedi ately committed to him, excited the indignation of the Scots : yet afterwards, on his dereliction of all claim"], [1026, "HISTORY OF THE 504 Chap.

By the intrigues and arts of the cardinal a furious opposition against this arrangement was excited. He seized both the young queen and her mother, and intimidated Arran into an infraction of the treaty, a desertion to the French party, and a renunciation of the protestant religion which he had before adopted. Enraged at this infraction, Henry commissioned a formidable body of troops for the invasion of Scot land. The towns of Leith and Edinburg were in volved in conflagration, together with some hundreds of villages and hamlets. The aversion of the Scots to the connexion proposed was only by such means more strongly confirmed. Lord Huntley said that, though he might not dislike the match, he could not relifhso rough a courtstip. After repeated devasta tions, hostilities were at length suspended, by a peace between France and England, in which Scotland was included. Previously to this pacific interval the slate of affairs was considerably affected by the death of Beton. Many had been exasperated by the cruelty of this prelate, particularly by the burning of George Wissiart, a protestant preacher extremely popular, with the fad spectacle of whose execution he seemed to be delighted, as he viewed it from the windows of his palace.

The intended invasion for the enforcement of the 1517. matrimonial alliance was, by the death of Henry, not relinquissied, but suspended. The protector of England, as soon as internal regulations permitted, advanced into the Scottissi territories at the head of eighteen thousand men, attended by a fleet of sixty snips. He found a Scottissi army of thirty-six thou sand posted so advantageously, on the heights above Musselburg, as to defy an assault ; while a scarci ty of provisions must ssiortly force him to retreat with extreme hazard in the presence of such a force. He offered very reasonable conditions of peace, which, as being supposed the effects of sear, were rejected with scorn. He was rescued from his danger by the presumption of the Scots, who, incited by their priests, descended in three divisions to attack the Englissi. Each division was formed like the Mace donian phalanx, dense, with deep files, and spears protended eighteen feet long. By these compact bo dies, the Englissi cavalry, who began the engage ment, were driven in disorder from the field ; but the Scots were galled in flank by a cannonade from the ships, in front by artillery planted on an emi nence and above all by dreadful ssiowers of arrows, which spread confusion through their ranks ; while the Englissi infantry advanced in good order, and the cavalry,"], [1028, "50(5 Chap, XL11I 3 547 1548 1550, HISTORY OF THE cavalry, having rallied, returned to the charge.

Above ten thousand of the Scottissi army fell, among whom were some hun dreds of monks, who had come to devote the here tics to destruction, and were slaughtered in sport, in their flight, by the Englissi, of whom not more than two hundred were slain. The great victory gained in this engagement, called the battle of Pinkey, fought on the tenth of Sep tember in the year 1547, served only to confirm the French interest among the Scots to the great detri ment of England. The object of the invasion was thence indeed easily attainable, as the kingdom, lay open without defense to the arms of the protector : but, after the reduction of some fortresses, that no bleman thought himself necessitated to return home with his forces to counteract intrigues formed against him in the Englissi council. Meanwhile the furious Tescntment of the Scottissi nobles against England impelled them, agreeably to the solicitations of the Dowager queen, Mary of Guise, to throw their country for protection into the arms of France. They proposed to contract their young queen in mar riage to the dauphin, the heir of the French mo narchy, and to send her immediately to the French court. That court was too politic to leave them time for reflection on their own rassiness. The fleet, which carried an auxiliar army from France into Scotland, conveyed the princess Mary into France. By dissen sions in England these auxiliars were permitted to re cover all the places of strength which had been gar risoned by the protector.

I .47 1553 1549 with France was at length negociated, and Scotland remained under the government of a French party. The intrigues in the English council, by which the protector was prematurely called from the Scot tissi war, were fomented, if not originated, by John Dudley, earl of Northumberland, son of that Dud ley who had been employed by Henry the seventh as an instrument of Extortion. This man was inordi nately ambitious, artful, unprincipled, of great abi lities, which he advantageously displayed at the battle of Pinkey. He is suspected to have instigated to his criminal attempts lord Seymour, the admiral, bro ther to the protector, equal to Dudley himself in ambition, boldness, turbulence, and disregard of morality, but far inferior in art. Seymour, who had married Catherine Parr, the widow of Henry the eighth, immediately after that monarch's death, made the utmost exertions for the supplanting of the protector, while that nobleman was in Scotland ; nor could he be persuaded, after his return, by the most soothing endeavours to desist from the attempt. On the decease of his wife Catherine, whom he is sus pected to have poisoned, he made his addresses to the princess Elizabeth, and appeared to carry his de signs even to the acquisition of the regal sceptre. Unable otherwise to curb his violence, the protector committed him to the tower, and, at the instigation of Dudley, consigned him to death by a bill of at tainder. By this execution a chief obstacle to the schemes of Dudley was removed. His next great object was the protector's overthrow. In favour of his design"], [1030, "HISTORY OF THE 508 Chap XL1II design some circumstances occurred. From the alienation of the lands of monasteries to less indul gent and non resident landlords, and from the ex tension of pasturage to the dimunition of agriculture on account of the augmented demand , for wool, much distress was experienced by the peasants, and insurrections in several counties alarmed the regency. Some of these were not suppressed without blood ssied ; particularly in Devonssiire and Norfolk, where the insurgents, incited by friars, demanded the re-establissiment of the Romissi rites. By the total rout of the rebels in Norfolk, of whom he put two thousand to the sword, the insidious Dudley encreascd his reputation ; while the protector by his lenity to the malcontents, either from compassion or a desire of popularity, gave offense to the nobles. The protector had also excited much jealousy by his surreptitious patent, his affectation of monarchal sway, and his erection of a palace too magnificent for a subject, called Somerset house, for the pro curing of ground and materials for which three episcopal palaces, and three churches, were demolissi ed. Perhaps the building of this edifice, the cause of fatal envy, had been chiefly undertaken for the gratification of his inordinately vain consort. When the state of affairs seemed ripe for the purpose, the cabal of Dudley, assembling apart, took measures which intimidated the protector into the resignation of his office. On his submission he was re-admitted into the council, and a perfect reconciliation seem ed to be effected with his capital foe by the mar- riage"], [1031, "BRITISH ILANDS. 509 Chap.

By this alliance was Dudley more enabled to accomplissi' Somerset's final ruin, whom, notwith standing his humiliation, he still regarded as an obstacle to the attainment of the grand object of his ambition. Commanding, without the title of regent, the council of regency by his influence, he caused Somerset to be accused of conspiring against his life, to be condemned and executed, together with his chief adherents. When he had thus de stroyed the Seymours, he unfolded his plot. By various arguments, particularly by the danger of the reformed religion under such a bigot as the prin cess Mary, he persuaded his young sovereign to ex clude from the throne, by setters patent, that prin cess, her sister Elizabeth, and the queen of Scot land, and to settle the succession on the lady Jane Gray, as next in the order of blood. He then pro cured this lady in marriage for one of his own sons, lord Guilford Dudley. The judges, when required to draw these setters, were terrified into compliance by the menaces of Dudley, who called Sir Edward Montague, chief justice, on his hesi tation, a traitor, and declared that he would fight in his shirt against any man who would dare to dispute the right of lady Jane. Notwithstanding the domestic dissensions in the reign of this minor king, and the national weak ness resulting thence, much improvement was made in the state of the kingdom religious and civil. Those laws of Henry the. eighth, which were"], [1032, "510 HISTORY OF THE Chap XLill were most inimical to public liberty, were repeal- ed in Somerset's administration; and the tenets and discipline of the reformed religion were introduced by successive steps. But unfortunately, in the course of religious innovation, the rapacious cour- tiers not only made spoil of much land, and other property, belonging to the church, but also com- mitted an irreparable destruction of books, par- ticularly in the colleges of Oxford, under the pretence of \" purging the libraries of legends and other superstitious volumes.\" By the fall of the protector, and the elevation of Dudley, the hopes of the catholics were considerably raised, but pro- portionally disappointed. This crafty statesman, though probably attached to the Roman church, yet knowing the zeal of the king for the new religion, joined with affected ardour the predo- minant party, and treated the unyielding prelates with augmented rigour. He endeavoured to de- prive even the princess Mary of mass in her own palace ; and, though the emperor interposed in her favour, her chaplains were so roughly treated, that ssie meditated an escape out of England, but her scheme was prevented. The king wept much at being obliged to permit, any where in his domi- nions, a service deemed by him imj_ious, or idola- trous. This amiable prince, on another occasion, wept from a far more rational motive, when, by Cranmer's importunity he was impelled to sign the sentence of an anabaptist condemned to the flames.

As he had quite recovered from the meazles and small-pox, his health was supposed to be firmly established ; but, whatsoever may have been the cause, he fell visibly into a state of decay from the time in which the Dudleys placed them selves around him. Foul deeds are suspected. When the succession was settled on lady Jane Gray, his physicians were dismissed, and the care of his person committed to an ignorant woman who under took his cure. His bad symptoms rapidly encreascd, and he expired in the July of 1553, the sixteenth year of his age, and the seventh of his reign. Imagining his great object at length within his procIarna. grasp, the possession of the monarchy in the name f^c\u2122?, of lady Jane Grey, his daughter-in-law, the duke 1553 of Northumberland repaired to that lady to salute her queen, and caused proclamation to be made of her ac cession to the throne. Jane was only in her sixteenth year. She was most amiable and accomplissied, destitute of ambition, and so addicted to literature as to have attained a familiar acquaintance with the Greek and Latin languages.

According to the then pre vailing custom ssie was lodged in the tower, accom panied by the members of the council, who were thus in some degree prisoners in the hands of Nor thumberland, to whose will they had thought them selves before obliged to be submissive. If the princess Mary, heiress of the crown by birth and her father's will, had been permitted to effectuate her meditated escape from England before Edward's death, ssie might now perhaps have found a return not practicable ; and the Dudleys, instead of the Tudors might have formed, a new dynasty. Her prevention on that occasion seems unaccount able in the conduct of Northumberland. He at tempted, immediately before the young king's de cease, to decoy both her and her sister Elizabeth into his power, by letters from the council in the name of that prince, requesting the consolation of their company and advice. By a private mes sage Mary was informed, in her approach to the court, of her brother's departure, and of the plot formed against her. She fled hastily to Suffolk, and sent letters to the nobles throughout England commanding their assistance. By a message to the council ssie promised pardon for past misdeeds on condition of future loyalty.

When Northumberland had advanced with six thousand men to give battle to Mary, he sound her army so superior, that he halted and wrote to the council for reinforcements. The members, all of whom had professed the utmost attachment to his cause, each with more vehemence in proportion to the hatred which he secretly bore him, were enabled, under the pretence of executing this order, to liberate themselves from their confinement in the tower. As sembling in another place, they issued orders for the proclaiming of Mary the legal queen. These were obeyed writh general joy and ssioms of applauscin every quarter. The garrison of the tower declared for the seme sovereign. The lady Jane, after the joyless pos session of a vain title during ten days, resigned the crown with more satisfaction than ssie had assumed it, happy, if ssie had been permitted to live unmolest ed in her loved retirement. Deserted by his troops, Northumberland himself proclaimed queen Mary with pretended zeal. He was soon after executed with two of his accomplices. On the scaffold he professed himself a catholic, and exhorted the peo ple in an earnest manner to return to the commu nion in which their ancestors had lived. To make a suitable return to her subjects for their zeal in her cause was not in the disposition of the princess Mary. Scarcely can we ascribe to her any Vol. II. L 1 quality"], [1036, "5U Chap.

Impatient for the abolition of heresy in her domi nions, the queen waited not for a repeal cf the laws by which it had been establissied, but proceeded im mediately in a direct violation of the statutes of her kingdom, to reinstate the Romissi, and severely to. discountenance the protestant ritual. The protes tants of Suffolk, who had raised her to the throne, were ssiarply rebuked for presuming to remind her of her solemn promise ; and, in proof of her con tempt, their speaker was exposed in the pillory. Judge Hale, the only man who had persisted throughout in maintaining her title in opposi tion to the Dudleys, was thrown into prison, and so cruelly treated that he there perissied, because he expressed his disapprobation of the infringement of the laws. The foreign protestants, who had settled in England,"], [1037, "il:S Chap. XLlil 1554, BRITISH ILANDS. England, fled in alarm to the continent, and their example was followed by many of the Englissi. Terrour was augmented, when by a parliament con vened in October, all the laws of Edward in favour of the reformed religion were rescinded by one vote; and when Mary was known to have formed the resolution of marrying herself to Philip of Spain, an atrocious bigot. The match with Philip, as it seemed to threaten the subjection of England under the tyrannic domi nion of Spain, was very ill relissied even by the catholics. Such was the general aversion and dis quietude, that the queen might have been dethroned, if men of rank and abilities had plotted an insur rection. An ill-planned conspiracy was formed against the marriage. In breach of concert some prematurely rose in arms and were suppressed. Sir Thomas Wiat, at the head of four thousand men from Kent, had at first an appearance of better success. Unable to force his way from Southwark into London, as the bridge was strongly guarded, he made a circuit by Kingston, and entered Westmin ster. But by his dilatory motions the critical time was lost. His followers deserted when they per ceived no effectual support. About four hundred were executed. Wiat, on the scaffold, declared the princess Elizabeth, whom the queen would have gladly involved in the guilt, quite innocent in the plot. The tower and prisons were silled with nobles and gentry, who were supposed to be possessed of popular influence.

A more steady and calm fortitude, a more mild resignation, cannot be conceived, than this admi rable young female exhibited at this lamentable catastrophe. Confirmed in her government by the suppression of this revolt, Mary procured from a new parlia ment the ratification of her matrimonial treaty: but, notwithstanding that the sum of four hundred thousand pounds, a great sum at that time, is said to have been remitted from abroad for the purpose of bribery, that assembly persisted with inflexible resolu tion in excluding the Spanissi king from authority in England, the independance of wssiich was secured as far as law in such a case could avail. In the July of 1554 Philip landed in England, repaired to Westminster, and was married to the queen, who had most impatiently longed for his arrival. As he was remarkably handsome, and eleven years younger than herself, her fondness after marriage was carried to excess. Disgusted with her love, teazed by her jealous humour, and disappointed in his hopes of drawing into his own hands the government of England, he returned in less than fourteen months to the continent ; but had, before his departure, to gain popularity, procured the liberation of several prisoners of distinction, par ticularly the princess Elizabeth, whose escape will be noticed in the succeeding chapter. Before"], [1039, "BRITISH ILANDS.. 517 Before her marriage with Philip, the queen had Chap. dissolved two parliaments not sufficiently compliant. 3^0 By a third, convened in the November of 1554, rer.ecu._o_i the laws for the persecution of here ics were re- tants vived ; but strict care .was taken to secure in the 1555. amplest form to their present possessors all the lands lJ\u00b0 ' which had been usurped in the two late reigns, from the ecclesiastical establishment. In the fourth parliament, in the following year, ssie procured the restitution of those impropriations to the church which had remained, to the crown ; declaring, when objections were made to such enfeebling dilapidation, that \" her soul was of more value than ten such kingdoms as England.\" Likewise ssie may have thought the burning of heretics necessary for her salvation. Cardinal Pole, who, commissioned as legate, had absolved the kingdom from the guilt of schism, and pronounced its restoration to the holy see, endeavoured to dissuade her from intolerant schemes, though himself was a sincere believer in the doctrines of the Romissi church : while Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, to whom specu lative opinions were a matter of indifference, ad vised the extermination of heresy by sire. He was urged by resentment against the protestant party, by whom he had been treated with great injustice, and by his wissi to indulge the fierce bigotry of the queen. A furious persecution was maintained above three years. Often were the magistrates reprimanded for their want of activity in searching for heretics. Men were seized on mere suspicion, and, on their declining"], [1040, "513 Chap. XLIII HISTORY OF THE declining to subscribe certain articles of belief, par ticularly the real presence, were committed to the flames. The zeal of Gardiner was exceeded by that of Edmund Bonner, Bissiop of London, whose disposition was savage, and his manners marked with buffoonery. Tortures were ordered for the forcing of confession ; and a court of inquisition resembling that of Spain, was by regal prerogative instituted. All the married clergy, the majority of the order then in England, had been ejected from their livings in the beginning of this reign. Beside a multitude of all ranks variously punissied otherwise, two hun dred and seventy-seven are recorded to have been burned alive in the course of this persecution. Among these were five bissiops, twenty-one other clergymen, fifty-five women, and four children. The execu tions of some were attended with uncommon cir cumstances. John Hooper, bissiop of Glocester, who refused to recant, when he was offered the royal par don at the stake on that condition, was burned with so slow a fire that he continued three quarters of an hour in torments, which he sustained with inflexible constancy. Among many other examples of forti tude in suffering was that of Thomas Haukes. Hav ing promised to his friends to give a particular sign, in case of his finding the pain not insupportable, he made the concerted signal amid the flames. When three women, a mother and her two daughters, were burned together in Guernsey, a child burst from the womb of one cf them, and was instantly snatched from"], [1041, "513 Chap. XLIII BRITISH ILANDS. from the sire by one of the guards, but was thrown back and consumed by order of the presiding magis trate. When the bissiops Ridley and Latimer were fastened to the stake, the latter said aloud to the for mer, \" Be of good cheer, brother, we shall this day kindle such a torch in England, as, I trust in God, will never be extinguissied :\" and doubtless these in fernal executions were in the highest degree fitted for the raising of a detestation against the Romissi, and consequently for the promotion of the protestant religion. Primate Cranmer had saved the life of Mary, at the hazard of his own, by interceding in her favour with her tyrannic father, who was enraged by her obstinate adherence to the Roman church : but he had also excited her hatred by the part which he had acted in her mother's divorce. After her accession he offended her anew by publissiing a declaration of his adherence to the protestant faith, in contradic tion to the taunts of Bonner and others, who affect ed to regard his silence as acquiescence in the queen's religion. He was imprisoned, but protected in the possession of his see by Gardiner, who feared the in troduction of cardinal Pole into the primacy. On the death of Gardiner in 1556, his doom was deter mined. He was cited to appear in eighty days be fore the tribunal of the sovereign pontiff, and was condemned as a contumacious heretic for non-ap pearance, though he was well known to be pre vented by his confinement.

XLIII War with France. 1557 1558 as already doomed to eternal torments, means were found by the most artful flatteries, insinuations, and excitements of great hopes, to prevail on him to re cant. The plan was to carry him immediately to the flames after his abjuration of heresy in church, where a great congregation was assembled to hear him. He disappointed his enemies by declaring before the au dience his resolution to die in the protestant faith, and his deep repentance for his temporary defection. At the stake he held his right hand, which had signed the* recantation, in the flames till it was consumed, repeating several times, \" this hand has offended ;\" nor, either then, or when the fire attacked his body, was any symptom of pain betrayed by him. Cardinal Pole, who succeeded Cranmer in the see of Canterbury, found himself as little able to dis suade the queen from forcing her kingdom into a war with France, as he had been to prevent the flames of persecution. Even before ssie could effect this impolitic measure, ssie had employed every en gine of extortion in her power for the raising of sums which she remitted to Philip. One instance out of many may here suffice. She levied forced loans from persons possessed of twenty pounds a-year or more, to such an amount, that the gentry were oblig ed to discharge great numbers of servants : and, as these servants, destitute of regular maintenance, cre ated disturbance, ssie forced their former masters to re-instate them in their service. Revisiting his con sort in the March of 1557, Philip, who was engaged in hostilities against France, declared his resolution of"], [1043, "BRITISH ILANDS. 521 Chap. XLIII, 155S Death of Mary. 155S of never again setting foot in England, unless that kingdom would join him in this war. The ardour of Mary, thus roused to its highest pitch, bore down every opposition. Eight thousand men were sent to join the Spanissi army in the Netherlands, and fleets were sent to annoy the coast of France. Ten Englissi ships, approaching accidentally to Gravelines, where a French army was engaged in battle against a Spa nish, poured their ssiot on the flank of the former, who were thus driven to rout with prodigious loss. But Calais, which had remained above two centu ries in the hands of the Englissi, had, before this battle, been taken by a French army under the duke of Guise, in the January of 1558. When the go vernor of this fortress, deemed impregnable in win ter on account of the surrounding marssies, expressed his apprehensions of an attack, when his garrison exceeded not five hundred men, the queen's eccle siastical counsellors answered, that \" even their white staves would be sufficient for its defense.\" The well planned and rapidly executed attack of Guise was crowned with success in fifteen days, to the great exultation of the French, and dejection of the Englissi. The loss of this town, more important to the ho nour than the profit of England, much affected the queen, who said that, \" aster death, Calais would be found engraven on her heart.\" This princess had, soon after marriage, fancied herself pregnant, and even that ssie felt the embryo stirring in her womb at the introduction of cardinal Pose; This Vol. II.

To the assaults of these, and other causes of vexation, her frame at length yielded.
