I. \u2014 Indian Marine Surveys, 1871-72. The Secretary of State has not yet been furnished with the opinions and suggestions of the Government of India as to the best means of placing the Marine Surveys on an efficient footing, which were caUed for in a despatch in the Geographical department, dated March 30th (No. 7), 1871.1 It is, therefore, presumed that the subject is still under consideration.2 Meanwhile Mr. Morris Chapman and Mr. Thompson, in the schooner \" Constance,\" have proceeded with the smvey of the Bahrein reefs.3 Mr. Chapman arrived at Bahrein on the 23d of October 1871. His initial data of latitude and azimuth were determined by numerous astronomical observations; the latitude of origin being 150 feet N. 10\u00b0 W. of the highest part of the old Portuguese Fort. The base line was measured four times with iron chains, carefully compared with a steel standard ; its azimuth being determined by means of numerous sets of observations to a Polaris at its greatest elongation with a 12\" Troughton and Simms' theodolite. Careful tidal observa tions were taken at Bahrein ; and in March, when the fan weather set in, soundings were commenced, the edges of the reefs at low water springs being put in by plane table. In May nearly all the crew were attacked with fever, and Mr. Chapman returned, with the \"Constance\" to Bombay, where he completed a fah* chart of Bahrein harbour and its adjacent reefs.

The tides run so strong that, without a good breeze, the Lascars cannot puU against them for any length of time; but with a steam launch, fitted with a condenser, the surveyor could remain outside and work, instead of having constantly to run into port for water. A steam cutter, 26 feet in length, for this surveying service, has accordingly been ordered in England, and was to have been ready to be sent out on about the 30th of June 1873. The great ocean and coasting trade of India renders the provision of accurate charts on adequate scales of the coasts and anchorages, a very important part of the duty of the Government. But, since the abolition of the Indian Navy, nothing has been done, except a survey of the mouths of rivers in Orissa and at Chittagong, and this work in the Persian Gulf, and no proper arrangement has been made for the execution of much-needed marine surveys. New surveys are urgently required of the coasts between Calicut and Bepur, from Santopillay to Point Palmyra, from Nizampatam to Cocanada, and of various shoals on the Coromandel coast.1 A survey is much needed of the new port of Kolachul in Travancor, near Cape Comorin, which has never been properly surveyed by the authority of Government, but was practically discovered by the coffee planters in the adjacent hills. They found that large ships could saH between some outlying rocks, and ride at anchor to leeward of them in still water. The first ship called there in March 1871, and since that date two other ships have loaded at the port of Kolachul. A survey is also urgently needed of Palk Strait and the Gulf of Manar ; and there should be a periodical examination of the river mouths of Mangalor and Cochin, and of the mud banks off Narakal and Alepy. Mr. Bobertson has pointed out the need for surveys of the mouths of the Narbada and Tapti, and several others are much wanted. The adoption of effective measures for seeming the due execution and continued revision of Marine Surveys and Charts on a systematic imperial plan, is a question which yearly becomes more m-gent. In a despatch, dated March 30th, 1871, the subject of Marine Surveys was brought to the notice of the Govern ment of India by the Secretary of State as one of very great import ance, and as deserving of early and serious attention. But the See \"Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 9."], [19, "11 TRIGONOMETRICAL SERIES. despatch, as has been already mentioned, has not yet been answered, and the subject is beHeved still to be under the consideration of the Government of India.1 II. \u2014 Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, 1871-72. During the season of 1871-72 the Great Trigonometrical Survey has been proceeded with on five series, and the completed work is represented by 10,310 square miles of principal, and 13,530 of secon dary triangulation. The work on the Brahmaputra Series, under Mr. Beverley, was confined to approximate operations, as much of the strength of the party as possible being devoted to the Asam triangulation. The Bidar Longitudinal Series,2 under the charge of Mr. Bossen rode,3 who took the field in December, 1871. The country was hilly and intricate, marching and arranging for supplies was a matter of very great difficulty, and pack buUocks were the only available means for carriage. Tigers and other wild animals were numerous and very troublesome ; and after February the smoke from the jungle fires rendered the progress of observing very slow. Towards the end of April the Bidar Series was completed, and a junction was effected with the Coast Series. The Bilaspur Meridional Series * was extended 42 miles in the district of Chattisgarh ; but it was difficult to find stations owing to the total absence of all permanent buildings in the wild forest-covered country. Some ruined temples were seen, in the depths of dense forest, on sites where, in some remote period, a large town existed, but they did not rise above the trees. The Bidar Scries party, having completed that portion of then* work, will now take up the southern portion of the Bilaspur Series. Lieutenant Rogers 5 carried on the northern section of the Bangalor Meridional Series 6 without intermission, until a junction was effected with Sir Andrew Waugh's southern section of the Great 1 Since this was in type, the Government of India have requested that a conference may be held at Calcutta in the ensuing cold season between the Naval Officer who may be selected by the Secretary of State to investigate the Marine affairs of India, the local Maritime Administrations, the several Chambers of Commerce, the Marine Authorities, the Surveyor-General, and Commander Taylor, late I.N. 2 See \"Memoir,\" p. 115; \" Abstract \" for 1869-70, p. 11; and \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 18. 3 See \" Memoir,\" p. 114, and \" Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 17. 4 See \"Abstract\" for 1869-70, p. 12, and \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 18. 5 See \"Memoir,\" p. 113, \"Abstract\" for 1869-70, p. 12. s See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 18."], [20, "12 SURVEYS OF GUJRAT, KATHYWAR, AND GURWHAL. Arc, extending north to Dehra Dun, on the 1st of March. Lieu tenant Rogers also fixed the positions of Haidarabad and Sikandrabad. The operations of the Mangalur Longitudinal Series, on the parallel of 13\u00b0, were pushed on with great energy by Major Branfill.1 The series was carried over the western Ghats, a difficult range, partly covered with dense jungle. From the computations of the previous season's work it was found that the Aneimudi Peak, in the Animalle Range, has an altitude of 8,837 feet above the sea, nearly 200 feet higher than the Dodabeta Peak, on the Nilgiris, which has hitherto been supposed to be the highest mountain south of the Himalayas. The triangulation of the Asam valley 2 has been continued to the eastward by Mr. \"W. G. Beverley 3. It was necessary, owing to the unsettled state of the hill country, to carry the triangulation along the valley which, when not covered with forest, is clothed with gigantic tropical reeds and grass. The reeds were so thick that, in clearing a ray, they had to be cut one by one, as if they were small trees. The series has now reached the Sibsagar district. The Topographical Survey operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey have been carried on in Gujrat, Katiwar, and Kamaun. Major Haig * was at the head of the Gujrat Party,5 which commenced operations near Surat, and an accurate map will be prepared of the city. Very good progress was made, and 1,036 square miles were triangulated. In Katiwar,6 under Captain Trotter,7 very important work was done, for the old maps of this country are excessively inaccurate, and, as regards the lines of drainage, positively mis leading. The agent of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, on examining the new maps, was induced to lay out an entirely different line for detailed survey from what he intended when he had the old maps only to judge from. In Garhwal the field work began with an extension of the triangulation of the Mana and Niti valleys that drain into the Alaknanda branch of the Ganges.8 This was a very difficult piece of work, as the stations were above i See \"Memoir\" p. 112, \" Abstract\" for 1869-70, p. 12. 2 See \" Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 17. 3 See \"Abstract\" for 1871-72, p. 17. 4 See \"Memoir,\" p. 118. 5 See \" Abstract \" for 1869-70, p. 13, and \" Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 18. 6 See \"Memoir,\" p. 118, \"Abstract\" for 1869-70, p. 13, aud \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 19. 7 See \"Asbtract\" for 1869-70, p. 13, and for 1870-71, p. 19.

From three stations near the Niti Pass, eight lofty peaks of the Trans- Himalayan range were fixed. One of them is the celebrated Kailas Parbat, or Gangri, which was formerly measured by Major-General Strachey.1 The present operations show that his results were newly correct, the height now established of 22,028 feet, being just 28 feet in excess of General Strachey's measurement. The field work of the season comprised the triangulation of the country east of Naini Tal, up to the Nepal frontier, on the Sardah river. Latitude observations were carried on by two parties under Captains Campbell and Herschel,2 on the 75th and 78th meridians.3 The Pendulum Party, on the death of Captain Basevi, was placed temporarily under the charge of Mr. Hennessey, who took pains to collect and arrange every record of Captain Basevi's valuable opera tions,4 in order that none of his hard-earned results might be lost to posterity. Subsequently, Captain Heaviside took charge of the Pendulum Party, in order to take the observations which are required to complete Captain Basevi's work. He will afterwards proceed by Aden and Egypt to England, and complete the Series at Greenwich. Tidal operations 5 have been satisfactorily completed at Tutikorin, and Major BranfiU will select a site at Mangalur for another set of tidal observations. In Katiwar Captain Trotter very cares uUy examined the coast line between Diu and Verawal, with the object of selecting stations for tidal observations. Lieutenant Baird c has been entrusted with the superintendence of the tidal observations, and, it is hoped, that he will be enabled to carry out a complete survey of the coast in the first instance, so that sites may be selected and ready when the new instruments arrive from England. The levelling operations7 for 1871-72 were conducted by Captain Carter, who carried the main line to the Great Trigonometrical Survey, Towers of Sonakhoda 8 and Ramganj, which mark the ends of one of the initial bases.

Progress has also been made with the new volumes of the \"Account of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.\" The drawing office was chiefly occupied with the preliminary charts of triangula tion, and the charts of levels ; but a map of the country round Delhi was compiled for the use of the camp of exercise, and experiments were made as to the most convenient form for issuing such maps for use with troops in the field. Copies were printed on waterproof india-rubber cloth, on white cloth, and on several kinds of paper ; and it was found that the white cloth promised to be most useful in the climate of India. A second edition of Colonel Walker's map of Turkestan has now been prepared, and will shortly be published. Colonel Walker returned to India in October 1872, and Major Montgomerie is now in England on furlough. III. \u2014 The Topographical Surveys of India, and Work in the Office of the Surveyor General, 1781-72. Seven Topographical Survey Parties were at work during 1871-72, under the direction of the Surveyor General, and they have made systematic progress in filling up the blank country in the respective divisions, so as to provide for each sheet of the Indian Atlas in due order. As the Surveys progress, the ground to be taken up becomes more insalubrious and difficult of access. The ground now occupied by each party is very wild, much of it altogether uninhabited, and in many parts very malarious. The vast tracts stiU remaining have never come under the operations of any Survey, but every corner wiU now be penetrated and defined. A marked impression is thus steadily being made, in laying down the features of the country and completing the first Survey of aU India. An area of from 16,000 to 18,000 square mUes on an average is annually mapped by this department. No. 1 Party,1 under Lieut. Holdich,2 was at work in GwaKor and Tonk ; an unusually difficult country. From the head of the Kunu valley to the Parbati river, the country is one continuous level of uninterrupted jungle. Scarcity of water and constantly recurring famines has reduced the population, and the cities are now hamlets standing in the midst of ruins. i See \u00ab Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 24. 2 , See \u00ab Abstract \" for 1870-71, P. 24."], [23, "15 TOPOGRAPHICAL surveys. The 2d Party,1 under Mr. Girdlestone,3 was surveying the north east corner of Khandesh, and Holkar's territory of Nimar, together with small portions of the native states of Barw&ni, Dhar, and Sindia. Colonel Saxton,3 with No. 3 party,4 was in the Bustar State of the Central Provinces, and Jaipur, Panchpenta, and Madgul of the Vizagapatam Agency ; a very wild mountainous country, from 500 to 5,000 feet above the sea. No. 1 Party,5 under Major Depree,6 was in the Rewah State and the Bilaspur district. Then* ground included the high plateau from which rises, at Amarkantak, the Narbada river, and the Johila, a tributary of the Son. The highest part of this plateau is 3,860 feet above the sea. The vaUeys are bare of forest and covered with tall coarse grass, and the inhabitants are wild Gonds, who five in wretched mud huts. The Party also extended its operations to the plateau of Sohagpur in Rewah where the Son rises, and to part of Chatisgarh. Captain Riddell,7 with No. 5 Party was in Bhopal and Malwa, on the Narbada and its tributaries the Sindor, Tendoni, and Banna. A smaU portion of the valley of the Betwa is also within the ground surveyed in 1871-72. The triangulation of No. 6 Party,8 under Captain Strahan, ex tended along the eastern flank of the Arabulla range in Rajputana, the highest point of which next to mount Abu is 1,330 feet above the sea. The range forms a long precipitous ridge rising abruptly from a plateau, and constituting the watershed of this part of India. The western portion of the country triangulated is in the plains of Marwar. The 7th Party conducted the Survey operations with the expe ditionary force in the Lushai and North Chittagong hills. Major Macdonald with Captain Tanner, Mr. Clifford Barrett, and Mr. Gordon Cooke, accompanied the southern column from Chittagong. This party succeeded in establishing a series of 27 secondary tri angles emanating from a base of the Eastern Frontier Series of the 1 See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 25. 2 See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, pp. 10 and 26. 3 See \"Memoir,\" p. 128 ; \" Abstract \" for 1869-70, p. 18, and for 1870-71, p. 25. 4 See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 25. 5 See \" Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 25. 6 See \"Memoir,\" p. 128, and \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 25, 7 See \"Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 25. 8 See \" Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 25,"], [24, "16 LUSHAI EXPEDITION.

It estab lished 40 well-defined points, and its work covers an area of 2,300 square miles of country, never before laid down, or even attempted to be painted. The mountain ranges and water system were sketched in from the Kurnafuli river to the valley of the Koladin in the extreme east. Unfortunately, although the two columns of the Lushai expedition approached each other very closely, a junc tion was not actually formed. It is hoped that improved relations with the hill tribes will hereafter enable the department to fill up this and other gaps which still disfigure the map of India. The northern column, starting from Cachar, was accompanied by Captain Badgley in charge of the surveying party, assisted by Lieut. Wood thorpe, Mr. E. V. Leach, Mr. Ogle, Mr. Robert, and Mr. McCay. The triangulation of this party emanates from a side of the Cachar Secondary Series of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and extends for 25 miles, in a S.E. direction into the Lushai country. Thence a route survey of 191 miles formed, with the triangulation, a connected basis for the delineation of 1,800 miles of entirely new topography. The party was within 40 miles of Major Macdonald' s party which accompanied the southern column. The officers of both parties have given very interesting descriptions of this new country, and of the manners and customs of the wild tribes which inhabit it. Lieut. Woodthorpe published a narrative of the proceedings of the left column of the Lushai expedition.1 His opening chapters con tain a summary of the events which led to the expedition, and some particulars respecting the physical and intellectual characteristics of the Lushais, then- villages, customs, and wasteful method of cultiva tion by jungle clearances. The rest of the work consists of a narra tive of the march, with various incidents and adventures, and accounts of the skirmishes with the hill men. The book is illus trated by two sketches and a map, showing only the route of the left column, and not covering sufficient ground to give a notion of the general plan of the campaign. Captain Tanner also wrote an account of the work of the right column, containing graphic des criptions of scenery, and interesting ethnological details.

During the year under review, nine new quarter sheets of the Indian Atlas were com pleted, and several are under compilation. A most useful standard map of India, on a scale of 64 miles to the inch, is also being prepared, and will be engraved on copper, on four sheets. A new standard map of Bengal in outline, on a scale of 16 miles to the inch, as a sister map to those of the Punjab and north-west provinces, has been completed; and the general map of the eastern frontier is commenced. The engraving of the remaining quarter plates of the Indian Atlas is progressing very satisfactorily.1 Up to the end of 1872 18 quarter plates had been engraved and published in India, and as many are in various stages of progress. Sixteen native apprentices are re ceiving instruction in the art of engraving on copper, and three new engravers have been added to the European staff. The process of steel facing the copper plates to preserve them from deterioration has been adopted, and the necessary apparatus has been received from England. In the lithographic branch 702 sheets of maps have been placed on stone, and 177,986 copies printed off. Among them may be mentioned the Revenue Survey sheets of the provinces of Sind and Oudh. Captain Waterhouse,2 under whose energetic superintendence the photozincographic branch1 of the office has attained its present high standard of usefulness, has spared no efforts to meet the demands for the immediate reproduction and issue of survey maps. As many as 1,428 were published, the number of copies being 117,320. He has also produced a beautiful specimen Map, by the photocoUotype process, of a reduced Atlas sheet, and another of an old Dutch map of Bengal. IV. \u2014 Revenue Surveys. There were 16 Revenue Survey Parties employed during 1871-72, under the orders of the Surveyor General, seven in the upper and nine in the lower circle ; and the total area surveyed was 18,144 square miles. The year 1871-72 inaugurated the system of cadastral field Surveys i See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 26. 2 See \"Memoir,\" p. 185, 131, and 137 ; and \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 26, (8967.)

The small size of the fields of course increases the amount of measurements to be made, recorded, and plotted, and consequently the cost of the Surveys. During this, the first year, the cost was 5 annas per acre, but it wiH be considerably 1 In a letter from the Secretary to the Government of the North-West Provinces to the Secretary to the Government of India (No. 2272 A., -Dec. 23, 1872) attention is invited to a passage at page 28 of the \" Abstract of the Reports of the Surveys, &c.\" (for 1870-71), which is said to contain erroneous statements \"not in accordance with facts.\" The remarks in question are : \u2014 1. That the first Revenue Survey of the North-West Provinces was executed by professional surveyors. 2. That this vital principle has since been set aside. 3. That the return to the old and more accurate system is quite in accordance with the views of Mr. Thomason. There is nothing in the Secretary's letter which contradicts the two first of these remarks, the correctness of which can scarcely be disputed. The first Survey v, as undoubtedly executed by professional surveyors, although it is true that, owing to the extraordinary haste with which the work was pushed forward (3,000 square miles each season), the topography was omitted, and the resulting maps were all but useless for any purpose but the settlement. They were used for the Atlas of India, but the sheets which were constructed from such materials are incorrect and require revision. The second remark, that the vital principle of making the Surveys by professional agency has been set aside, is strictly accurate, although a correct system has recently been adopted in Mattra and Muradabad. The third remark is based on several passages in Mr. Thomason's directions for settlement officers. In paragraph 30 he says, \" The scientific survey is of great value as a check upon the Ameens,\" although he adds that the giving of topographical information is a secondary consideration. He also refers to the Scientific Survey at paragraphs 25 and 27, and to the principle laid down by him of \" simultaneous proce dure between the professional survey and khusreh.\" These passages prove that an accurate system was in accordance with the views of Mr. Thomason, and a reference to paragraph 30 of Mr. Thomason's directions, as well as to paragraph 29, will show that the remark at page 28 of the \" Abstract \" for 1870-71 is quite in accordance with facts. Mr. Thomason's views are also referred to by Colonel Thuillier, in a letter dated Feb. 12th, 1870, No. 229, paragraph 9. Mr. Thomason did not put so high a value upon a correct Survey, and upon the importance of combining settlement work with the preparation of Maps for general administrative purposes as is done at the present day. Thirty years ago such Maps were not so urgently needed in every department of the government. But he consi dered the scientific Survey to be of great value as a check ; and its operations are, therefore, quite in accordance with his views.

The work is most intricate, and Colonel GastreU, the Superintendent of the Revenue Surveys (upper circle), reports that great credit is due to Colonel Anderson and Major Vanrenen, who have conducted the operations in the Mattra and Muradabad dis tricts, for the completeness of the work in every respect, and for the extent of the areas that have been completed. A facsimile of one sheet of a village in Mattra, by Colonel Anderson, illustrating the style and minuteness of the cadastral operations now being carried on in the North-West Provinces, is forwarded with the report. More permanent Survey marks are needed, to make this cadastral Survey complete and efficient in every respect. There are masonry marks erected at triple junctions of villages, which are used as theodolite stations, and plotted down on the village maps. But these alone are not sufficient to enable additions to be made to maps hereafter, with out unnecessary labour and expense, and it is proposed to have the nearest survey station, right or left of the triple junction, permanently marked, so as to give a good and reliable base line, from which any new measurements can at once be laid off. The cadastral Surveys are on a scale of 16 inches to the mile ; and Colonel Thuillier anti cipates the very best results from these operations, both financiaUy and professionally, as regards systematic and accurate measurement, with permanent recordings of the maps of \" fields \" and ascertain ment of true areas. \" EventuaUy,\" he continues, \" I believe they \" win prove not only invaluable as a correct permanent record of \" the landed tenures for aU purposes of Revenue assessment, but an \" immense saving of expense will be effected in the end, by doing \" away with the constant necessity for partial remeasurements for \" irrigation, canals, railways, roads, and other purposes, which are \" now perpetuaUy being made in an irregular, unsatisfactory, and \" expensive manner, for emergent engineering objects.\" Besides Mattra and Muradabad, Revenue Surveys on accurate principles, on the scale of 16 inches to the mile, have also been commenced in Agra and Hamirpur. The other Revenue Surveys of the upper circle were at work in Bareli, Kurnal, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Bhawalpur. In the lower circle (Bengal) 4,760 square miles were surveyed in Nauo-ong, Dorang, and Sibsagar in Asam, and in Hugli, including a Topographical Survey of 1,099 square miles in Hazaribagh and a portion of Lohardugga in Bengal. The Hazaribagh Survey b 2"], [28, "MADRAS REVENUE SURVEY. 20 was made by Captain Sconce,1 who is reported to have combined triangulation with a close and searching delineation of the topo grapy of the country, and by his system, energy, and skill to have made a splendid topographical survey of Hazaribagh. The depart ment has to deplore the loss of Mr. O'Donel,2 which occurred in the height of the field season, on April 22d, 1872. Colonel Vanrenen, in recording his death, says that he entered the service in 1836, and by sheer hard work, industry, and perseverance, he worked his way up to the highest grade of the executive branch. In the Central Provinces the Revenue Survey Parties were at work in the districts of Chindwara, Raipur, and Bhandara. The combined area completed by the Topographical and Revenue Surveys was 36,054 square miles, at an average cost of BI. 10s. Id. per square mile. The annual cost of the Great Trigonometrical Survey is 70,0002., of the Topographical 70,0002., and of the Revenue 100,000/., making the total cost of the Surveys 240,0002. The Madras Revenue Survey,3 under the superintendence of Colonel Priestley, made steady progress. Up to 1872 the Survey of eight districts was completed, and eight were in progress. The finished area amounts to 32,122 square miles, besides 7,862 in the districts still under Survey. The excess of assessable area brought to light by the Survey ranges from 2 to 23 per cent., and in the completed districts the Survey gives 24,000 square miles, which have hitherto only been counted as 21,500 for assessment purposes. The average assessment is 3s. 9c?. per acre, and the addition of these 2,500 square miles to the taxable area represents an annual gain to the State of 300,0002. The value of a Revenue Survey on accurate principles can scarcely be disputed in the face of such facts as these. The average size of fields is about two acres, and the approximate number measured and potted in the eight completed districts is 7,000,000. The number of village maps that has been drawn is 15,546, and the average error per mile, shown by the test of comparing the work with that of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, is 7*61 feet. During 1871-72 the experiment of the combined Revenue Survey and settlement measurements in the Bombay Presidency4 was tried in the Nasik district ; and after being fully reported upon, it was decided by the Government of India not to have been sufficiently 1 See \"Abstract\" for 1869-70, p. 16. 2 See \" Abstract \" for 1869-70, p. 16. 3 See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 32 ; also \"Memoir,\" pp. 106 and 133. 1 See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 34."], [29, "BOMBAY REVENUE SURVEY. 21 successful to warrant its continuance on the same principles for another season. The operations of the party from Bengal comprised a survey of each village including aU the topographical details required for geographical maps on a scale of 8 inches to 1 mile, that being the scale in general use in the Bombay Presidency. The Bombay Parties were to measure and class the fields within the village areas. The work of the two Parties could not be made to agree, and it was found that this double system of measurements was impracticable. A conference was, therefore, held between Colonel Francis, the Survey and Settlement Commissioner of Bombay, the Surveyor General of India, and the Superintendents of the Revenue Survey Department of India, on the 24th of February 1873, on the subject of combined Revenue and Topographical Survey in the Nasik, Puna, Skolapur, and Ahmadnagar districts. It was arranged that a General Topographical Survey, on a scale of 2 inches to the mile, should be executed by the Department of the Surveyor General, entirely independently of the Bombay Revenue Survey of fields. By this arrangement the whole of the Bombay districts will be laid down on one uniform scale of professional Topographical Survey, whilst the Revenue Survey of fields will proceed intact and be totally free from all clashing. V. \u2014 Supply of Instruments. The 11th section of the Memoh* on the Indian Surveys contains an account of the Lambeth Observatory, created and superintended by Colonel Strange, of the system under which it is managed, and of the work it performs.1 Colonel Strange was appointed to examine and test all instru ments ordered for India in 1863. On October 15th, 1866, Colonel Strange submitted a report, and on March 3d, 1873, he sent in another interesting report, based on the results of 10 years' expe rience of the working of his system. When Colonel Strange was first appointed there was no one kind of instrument supplied to India which was not faulty, either in respect of form, principle, workmanship, or material, and frequently in all these respects. Parallel rulers were not parallel, protractors indicated angles enormously in error, scales and level staves were incorrectly graduated, spirit levels were imperfect, barometers had i See \" Memoir,\" p. 138."], [30, "22 SUPPLY OF INSTRUMENTS. enormous errors, and the more elaborate instruments, such as theo dolites and levels, stood in need of thorough reform in every detaH. The great improvement effected by Colonel Strange has been attained by three measures, the abolition of patterns, the abolition of tenders, and a system of thorough inspection. The pattern system is an encouragement to the trade to stand still, and the result is the perpetuation of forms which have long been condemned and superseded by the advance of knowledge. But there is no finabty in science. In no branch of human knowledge is there more rapid and extensive change. At the same time, a system of supply without patterns entails invention and skilful superintendence, and could not be adopted unless the services of such an officer as Colonel Strange were available, who to unsurpassed knowledge of the use and construction of scientific instruments, adds a practical acquaintance with Indian surveying, acquired by many years of arduous service in the field. In December 1867, Mr. Thomas Cusbing, an accomplished mechanic, trained under the eye of Mr. Thomas Cooke of York, was appointed as Colonel Strange's assistant. Under the colonel's instructions he has now become qualified to inspect, adjust, and observe with every description of scientific instrument and apparatus furnished to the Indian services. The system of employing makers of repute has been substituted by Colonel Strange for that of tenders, but he gives orders to more than one for each class of instrument. This plan stimulates effort, and affords the means of checking any augmentation of prices. Makers are caUed upon to give estimates, not tenders, for each class of instruments. The instruments are subjected to rigorous inspection, and to actual trial before payment is made. This has raised then* price, but at the same time it has greatly increased their accuracy. In 1865 there were 4,148 instruments inspected, which cost 10,6092, In 1872 the number inspected was 18,000, and the cost 20,8452. The number of different kinds of instruments ordered through Colonel Strange is about 150 ; several have to be individually carefuHy examined and tested, and some require to be taken to pieces. The following is the average annual number of the most important kinds :\u2014 Theodolites - 145 Levelling Instruments - 152 Thermometers \u25a0- - 739 Barometers - - - 25 Aneroids - - - 20 Microscopes - - - 17 Pentagraphs - - - 19 Salinometers - - 34 Hydrometers - 17 Telescopes - - 48 Levelling Staves - - 212 Prismatic Compasses - 103 Insts. Mathl. cases - 406 Chronometers - - 45"], [31, "SUPPLY OF INSTRUMENTS. 23 Colonel Strange remarks that the only just mode of viewing the cost of inspection, which he calcidates at 3*57 per cent, of the cost of the instruments,1 is by looking on it as a per-centage of the cost of the departments using the instruments ; and on this point he offers the following calculation : \u2014 \" My office is not kept up for its own sake, but for the sake of \" maintaining the efficiency of certain departments, such as the \" Public Works, the Surveys, and, to a certain extent, the Medical \" and Educational Departments. It is as an integral part of these \" departments that the cost of instruments, including then inspec \" tion, is rendered necessary and is to be justified. \" Viewing it in this way, I take the expenditure of late years on \" Public Works in India as between seven and eight millions \" (8,000,0002.) per annum. \" The number of instruments which would be supplied if no \" inspection existed would probably be the same as that supplied \" at present with inspection ; but one effect of efficient super \" intendence must be, and has been, to raise the price of instru \" ments. I held out no other expectation on being appointed, as \" I conceived one of the main objects in appointing me was to put \" a stop to the supply of low-priced bad instruments by inferior \" makers. It is difficult to arrive exactly at the amount of this \" increase, which has affected different kinds of instruments very \" unequally, but I am quite sure that if I take it at 10 per cent, on \" the whole 1 shall be considerably over-estimating it. \" Taking the average cost of instruments for the last five years, \" as before, at 16,3432., then 10 per cent, of this will be 1,6342. \" We have then \u2014 \" Increased cost of instruments consequent on inspection - 1,634/. \" Colonel Strange's salary ----- 350/. \" Mr. Cushing's \u201e - - - - 170/. \" Observatory Attendant ----- 64/.

I \" need make no remarks on this result.\" VI.\u2014 The Geological Survey of India, 1872. During 1872 Mr. Medlicott was engaged in the examination of the Satpura coal fields and adjoining country.1 The most important practical results of his work are the possibility of coal being found to extend under the more recent deposits of the Narbada valley, and the probability of workable coal being traced more to the south in the Dudhi valley. Mr. Medlicott recommended that boring trials should be made, but the undertaking was attempted to be carried out without proper tools or efficient supervision. Mr. Willson was engaged in extending the geological lines and boundaries from the north of Damoh into Bandalkhand and the adjoining territory of Rewah.2 The coal fields of Kota, on the southern borders of the Mirzapur district, have been mapped by Mr. Mallet, who noticed 14 outcrops of coal, most of them very thin and worthless, but two or three have a workable thickness of fan coal. During the later part of the year Mr. Mallet took up the examination of the Hazaribagh district. Mr. Ball was engaged in the examination of the coal bearing rocks in Sirguja, and afterwards he was deputed to accom pany Mr. Bauerman in his visit to the more important iron yielding districts, with a view to giving a definite opinion on the feasibility of establishing ironworks in India. Mr. Hacket3 has carried his lines and divisions from Jabalpur into Rewah ; while Mr. Fedden, during the early part of the year, extended his examination of the rock in the Nizam's territory adjoining Chanda, tracing out the existence of a group of rocks under the great Deccan trap, related to the Upper Jurassic rocks of Kach, and the Rajmahal beds of Bengal. Mr. Wynne and Dr. Waagen4 have completed the mapping of the whole of the Salt Range, in the Punjab, and have obtained a remark- 1 See \" Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 38. 2 See \u00ab Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 38. 3 See \" Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 38. * See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 40."], [33, "25 MR. BLANFORD IN PERSIA. ably interesting and extensive series of fossils. Afterwards Mr. Wynne was at work in the country north of the Salt Range ; while Mr. Waagen returned to Calcutta and took up the detailed examina tion of the cephalopoda from Kach, a group which will form one of the most important contributions to the cephalopoda fauna of the Upper Jurassic formations ever published. Mr. King took up the examination of the country near the Godavari, in continuation of Mr. Blanford's Survey of the previous year. He discovered the most southerly coal deposit that has hitherto been found in India, and has come upon some fossiliferous beds between Rajmahendri and the sea, the organic remains of which will prove of high interest. As the jungles become drier and more accessible, Mr. King will extend his researches northwards. Mr. Foote1 has been carrying out the boundary lines between the Deccan trap rocks and the underlying beds, and between those intermediate beds and the gneiss rocks on which they rest, con necting his lines with those previously mapped in by Mr. Wilkinson to the west. In Burma, Mr. Theobald3 has been at work in the country between the central range and the eastern boundary of the country on the Sitang river ; and in the season of 1871-72 he will have completed the examination of British Burma proper, when a map and general report will be prepared for publication. Dr. Stoliczka3 also completed his work on the province of Kach, and he has defined several well marked sub-divisions of the Jurassic rocks, establishing their close relationship to the acknowledged group in European classifications. Mr. Blanford had been instructed to devote the working season of 1871-72 to a preliminary examination of the geology of Sind, but on his arrival in Karachi in November 1871 he was directed, instead of proceeding into Sind, to accompany Major St. John, R.E., in the Survey of the Perso-Baluch frontier. It was proposed that Maj 01- St. John's Party should leave Gwadar early in December, and after tracing the frontier between Persia and independent Baluchistan as far as Jalk, should traverse or skirt the desert to the north, and joining Sir F. Goldsmid in Sistan, accompany that officer to Tehran. Major St. John being detained for a time in Persia by illness, Mr. Blanford devoted the time at his disposal to a brief examination 1 See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 40. 2 See \"Abstract \" for 1870-71, p. 40. 3 See \"Abstract\" 1870-71, p. 41."], [34, "26 MR. BLANFORD IN PERSIA. of several places of interest on the Makran coast and the shores of the Persian Gulf, an opportunity of visiting these places in the Government telegraph steamer being afforded to bim by Mr. H. Walton, director of the Persian Gulf telegraph The results, of which a brief account has been pubHshed in the Records of the Geological Survey of India, are of some interest and even of prac- tical importance, for his examination of the islands of Hormuz, Kishm, and some neighbouring islets confirms the accounts given by previous traveUer s of the quantities of rock salt existing in them. The supply appears to be practically inexhaustible. The beds of salt are associated with volcanic rocks and are of much older date than the tertiary formations in the neighbourhood. The principal geological facts ascertained upon the voyage to the Persian Gulf are, the existence of a great series of tertiary beds for which the name of Makran Series has been proposed, several thousand feet in thickness, locaUy highly fossiliferous, and having a weU marked mineral character, which occupy the greater portion of the coast from Somniani, near Karachi, to the head of the Persian Gulf; the evidence of a rise of land in recent times on the north-east and of depression on the south-west coasts of the Gulf, and a few points connected with the geology of Maskat and of Cape Masandam in Arabia. From the limestone of which the mountains which form the last named promontory consist, a few fossils were obtained, one of which has been ascertained by Dr. Stoliczka to be triassic. From the Persian Gulf Mr. Blanford returned to Gwadar a few days before Major St. John arrived there, and after a short detention caused by temporary disturbances amongst the tribes in the neigh bom-hood, they left Gwadar together on the 22d January 1872, and marched via Bahu Kelat, Pishin, the Nihing river, and Kalagan to Jalk. The road, after leaving the later tertiary rocks of the Makran Series near the coast, traversed vertical or nearly vertical beds of unfossiliferous shale and sandstone for the whole distance, and the age of the rocks could only be inferred from the occasional occurrence of smaU irregular bands and masses of nummulitic limestone. Jalk lies at the edge of an immense desert plain, which, like the other great desert plains of Central Persia, has possibly once been the bed of a lake. Owing to delays caused by the difficulty of obtaining carriage, it was too late when the party reached Jalk to attempt to join Sir F. Goldsmid in Sistan, and they consequently inarched to Tehran via Bampivr, Bam, Kerman, Shiraz, and Ispahan. Throughout this long march the principal rocks noticed were of"], [35, "GEOLOGICAL PUBLICATIONS. 27 cretaceous and nummuHtic age, volcanic formations being of fre quent occurrence, and some of the mountains consisting of granite and metamorphic rocks. An enormous area was found to be concealed beneath alluvial deposits, part of which are probably due to the former existence of lakes, and it was inferred that large inland seas at one time occupied the areas now forming the great desert plains of Central Persia. Tehran was reached at the end of July, and after devoting a few days to the Elburz mountains, north of the capital, Mr. Blanford left for Europe. The geology of the Elburz mountains differs greatly from that of the ranges south of Tehran, and beds of coal, part of which at least are of oolitic age, occur in them. Besides his geological notes, Mr. Blanford, with the aid of Major St. John, and of a collector sent by the Indian Museum, succeeded in forming for the Government a large and very valuable coUection of the mammals, birds, and reptiles of the country traversed. Very Httle being known of the zoology of Persia, this collection furnishes a large amount of additional information as to the Persian fauna. Large coUections of marine animals also were made on the Persian Gulf.1 The Records of the Survey were published each quarter during 1872. They contain a paper on a section of the hills near Mail in the Punjab, showing the distinctions of the beds as indicated by then* fossils by Dr. Waagen ; descriptions of the mineral contents of the gneiss in the district of South Mirzapur by Mr. Mallet ; a paper on the sandstones of the Godavari by Mr. Blanford ; a more detailed account of the southern portions of this area, showing the occurrence of coal near Kambhampet by Mr. King ; two valuable sketches of the geological structure of the shores of the Persian Gulf by Mr. Blanford ; an account of a very remarkable case of local jointing in some sandstones near Jabalpur by Mr. Medlicott ; a notice of petroleum locaHties in Pegu, and further discussion of the relations of the axial group in western Prom by Mr. Theobald ; and two other papers by Mr. Blanford, one a general sketch of the o-eology of Orissa, and the other on the geology of the Bombay Presidency. These records show the activity of the members of the Survey, and the great progress that is being made, year by year, in the elucidation of the geological structure of India and the adjoining countries. Durino* 1872 volumes VIII. and IX. of the Memoirs of the 1 See also page 34."], [36, "28 GEOLOGICAL PUBLICATIONS. Geological Survey were issued. In the first a detailed account is given of an immense area, nearly as large as England, in the Madras Presidency, including the districts of Kurnal and Kadapa (Cuddapah), with maps and illustrations. The second includes a notice of the Peninsula of Kach ; a description of the geology of the vicinity of Nagpur ; a notice of the geology of Sirban bills near Abbotabad in the Punjab, and a short account of the occurrence of ammonites in beds, in the Salt Range, containing other fossils universally admitted hitherto as of carboniferous age. The occurrence of a true ammonite in any of the pal\u00e6ozoic rocks is a fact altogether new, and open of field of investigation of the highest interest. The Pal\u00e6ontologia Indica continues to be issued, and the four large volumes of the cretaceous fauna of Southern India, which will complete the monograph of that very important group, are nearly completed. A number containing cephalopode collected in Kach is also ready for issue. The sheets of the Atlas of India are to be used for showing the geology, and will be the maps composing the final record of the work of the Survey. The four quarter sheets of sheet No. 79, containing the larger portion of the cretaceous area of the Madras Presidency, were prepared some time ago. Two quarter sheets of No. (78, S. E. and N. E.) were printed during 1872, and parts of No. 77 were in the hands of the engravers. The printing in colours, in the lithographic branch of the Surveyor-General's Office, has been very successful, and the issue of the maps will now make steady progress. A work, bearing on the mineralogy of the Himalayas, has recently been published by Mr. Calvert.1 His journey into the Kulu valley was undertaken with the object of examining its mineral resources, and he appears to have been well rewarded for his trouble. He has projects for working the silver mines at Manikara, and he has ob tained the lease of an antimony mine at Shigoi. He also speaks of finding sapphires worth 2502., and other gems. The present volume contains a pleasant narrative of his journey, with good descriptions of scenery, of the temples and villages, and much useful information respecting the rocks and minerals.

VII. \u2014 The Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India. General Cunningham has been actively engaged in organising a systematic arch\u00e6ological examination of India since his return in January 1871. In the conduct of this important Survey, which is of as much interest and value to the science of comparative geography as to that of arch\u00e6ology, he has divided it into five provinces of nearly equal size ; the Punjab, the North West Provinces, Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. These provinces are again divided into three sections each, to be explored by one party in a single season. Not more than one-half of the arch\u00e6ological remains of India are now known to us, and inquiries and explora tions will lead to fresh discoveries. The regular Arch\u00e6ological Survey was commenced in October 1871, under General Cunning ham's personal superintendence. M. Beglar, an excellent photo grapher, and Mr. Carlleyle, the Curator of the RiddeU Museum at Agra, will be the General's assistants. During the summer of 1871, General Cunningham was super intending the reprint of his Arch\u00e6ological Reports made from 1862 to 1865, for the illustration of which he prepared 99 plates with his own hand. The new edition1 contains an introduction giving an interesting sketch of the labours of General Cunningham's pre decessors in the field of ; Indian arch\u00e6ological research. It is also illustrated by maps, plans, and architectural drawings, and is altogether in a more convenient and useful form than the original reports. In the winter of 1871-72, he made researches in the Gangetic Valley, and Mr. Beglar and Mr. Carlleyle were at work in Delhi and Agra. The new and valuable information thus collected 1 \"Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India.\" Four Reports made during the years 1862-63-64-65, by Alexander Cunningham, C.S.I., Major-General, R.E., and Director- General of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India (2 vols., Simla, 1871).

General Cunningham explored many ancient places in the Punjab in 1872-73, and he proposes to make a Survey of the Central Provinces in 1873-74. The time required to complete an Arch\u00e6ological Survey of the whole of India will extend over 10 or 12 years. It is proposed to appoint Mr. James Burgess,1 an eminent antiquary, to the superintendence of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey of the Bombay Presidency. He has already drawn up a memorandum on the architectural and arch\u00e6ological remains in the Bombay Presidency, and in the territory of the Nizam. But the most interesting piece of arch\u00e6ological work in Western India that has been undertaken during the year under review has been the measures for replacing the grievous loss caused by the destruction of the oH colour copies of frescos in the Ajanta Caves, in the fire at the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. The Government of India has sanctioned an expenditure of 5002. with this object. Mr. Griffiths, the Decorative Artist in the School of Arts at Bombay, who is an artist of no ordinary merit, was deputed to report upon the state of the frescos. He found the paintings in a most deplorable condition, wantonly defaced and hacked, with water percolating through the rock, and converting them into black unintelligible masses. Yet there are many fragments worthy of being copies, which, in a few years, will be entirely obliterated. Mr. Griffiths formed a high estimate of their value, and says, \" These old Buddhist artists were \" keenly ahve to the pleasures derived from, and thoroughly under \" stood the principles of decorative art in its highest and noblest \" sense.\" VIII.\u2014 Meteorological Observations in India, 1871. The question of the organization of a Meteorological Department in India is stiH under consideration.2 The Despatch from the Secretary of State on the subject, dated the 18th of May 1871, and enclosing the Report of the Committee of the Royal Society, not having yet been answered. In Bengal there has been no change in the number of observatories, 1 See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 42. 2 See \"Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 43."], [39, "31 METEOROLOGY. nor in the methods of observing and registering, except that the register of rainfalls has been extended to a number of sub-divisional stations. The want of an observatory at Calcutta is pressingly felt, especiaUy as a means of training observers to then work. The difficulties in keeping the work of the observatories up to a proper standard are chiefly attributable to observers never having been regularly trained to then work. Dr. Townsend, who has charge of the meteorological observations in the Central Provinces, and Mr. Elliott, the officiating reporter in the North West Provinces, have, at much pains and labour, brought the registers of their respective provinces up to a standard which renders the major part of them strictly comparable with those of Bengal. The extension of know ledge thus gained has been most important, and has enabled Mr. Blanford to give a more complete sketch of the meteorology and climate of northern India than has hitherto been possible. Most of the first-class stations in Bengal have now furnished registers for five years. The observers are the electric telegraph station masters, and they are reported to have performed their work conscientiously. At the second-class stations there are native observers under the superintendence of civil medical officers ; and at the third-class stations the rainfaUs only are recorded. In the North West Provinces there are 14 first-class stations, that of Dehra belonging to the great Trigonometrical Survey. At the Agra Medical CoUege an annual course of instruction is given in the rudiments of meteorological science, and an annual money prize is given, for which 22 students competed. The Punjab and Oudh observations have not yet been made comparable with those of Bengal. In Mysor the only observations that can be reHed on as accurate are those recorded in the observatory at Bangalore, which is under the control of the Madras astronomer. In the Berars there are meteorological stations at Akola, Buldana, and Amraoti, and rain guages at all the Tahsil stations. IX. \u2014 The Madras Observatory, 1871-72. The Madras Observatory has been the centre of astronomical work during the British occupation of India. It was founded in the days of Sir Thomas Munro, and has ever since been directed by a suc cession of able astronomers, whose series of observations extend from 1787 to 1873. Mr. Pogson, the present astronomer, continues to"], [40, "32 THE COMET OF BIELA. observe with valuable results, but for some time his most important work must be the publication of observations already recorded,1 rather than the further accumulation of results. There arc now 20,895 unpublished observations with the new transit circle. This year he records the extraordinary appearance of g. Argus, a star in the constellation of Argo Navis, which is beHeved to be a perma nent furnace world, maintained by burning gases of totally different character to any with which we are acquainted. Mr. Pogson has also obtained a difference of longitude between Madras and Batavia, by exchanging signals along the electric submarine telegraph, with Dr. Oudemans, the Surveyor General of Netherlands India. But the chief work of the staff of the Madras Observatory, during 1871-72, was the observation of the total eclipse of the sun on 12th December 1871. Mr. Pogson's son, the Assistant Astronomer, had previously been sent home to study solar photography. Special instruments were sent out, and a village called Avanashi, on the railway to Coimbator, was selected as the place for observing. Three fair photographs were obtained during the totality, which verify the existence of a luminous envelope round the sun's disc, to a height of 160,000 miles, and show other interesting features. Mr. Winter, the Telegraph Engineer of the Madras Railway, at the same time made polarisation measurements of the corona. The same eclipse was observed at Utakamand, on the Nilgiris, by Colonel Tennant, assisted by Mr. Hennessey and Captain Herschel, of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and Captain Waterhouse, an admirable photographer, from the Surveyor General's Office. Six photographs were taken during totahty. Colonel Tennant's conclusion is that the corona is solar ; it is the atmosphere of the sun mainly shining by reflected light. In December 1872, Mr. Pogson detected the comet of Biela, at the Madras Observatory, under circumstances of extraordinary inte rest. This- comet was first seen in 1772 ; but in 1826 Mr. Biela discovered it again, when the orbit was carefully calculated, and the results showed that it revolved round the sun in about 6| years. In 1832 it returned with the utmost punctuality ; and again in 1846, it separated into two, each complete, with a short tad of its own, 150,000 mdes apart. The phenomenon produced a profound sensation among astronomers. It, and its companion, were again seen in 1852, but 1,250,000 mdes apart. 1 See \" Abstract\" for 1870-71, p. 51."], [41, "JOURNEY OF NO. 9. WORK IN PERSIA. 33 In 1859 it was due, but was too near the sun's position to be found ; and, in 1866, it could not be found ; it was missing. It was next due, agreeably to its former orbit, in October 1872. On November 30th, Mr. Pogson received a telegram from Professor Klinkerfues, of Gottingen : \" Biela touched earth on 27th ; search near 5 Centauri.\" Mr. Pogson searched day after day, and on the 3rd he found the comet, securing four comparisons of it with an anonymous star. The lost comet was re-found, but it had no tad. Next morning, December 4th, it was again seen, and with a short tail ; it appears actually to touch the earth, and neither the earth nor the comet were conscious of the collision. X. \u2014 Geographical Exploration, Publications, and New Maps. During the year exploring work beyond British India has been executed both beyond the Himalayan peaks, and in Persia. In the former direction Major Montgomerie employed a native explorer, who succeeded in opening out the geography of a very large tract of country, as to which we had previously had but the vaguest conjectural indications. These explorers are anonymous, and are carefuUy drilled to observe for latitude and elevation above the sea. The explorer of 1871-72 is known to the world as No. 9. His route led round the great Mount Everest, penetrating on the north to the Sanpu River, and thence south-west over the Dingri-maidan, the most extensive plateau on the south of the Himalyan watershed that is drained by streams flowing direct into India. The route taken by No. 9 corresponds, for some distance, with that of Dr. Hooker to the rest of Darjiling. The new ground commences with Dr. Hooker's most north-westerly point, and includes a large lake which had not previously been indicated on the maps. The positions of many peaks north of those which are visible from the side of India have been determined, as well as that of the celebrated Sakya Monastery. The route traversed by No. 9 is 844 mdes long, 550 of which are over entirely new ground, and it elucidates the geography of the basin of the Arun, the largest feeder of the great Kosi River, which drains the whole of Eastern Nepal. The explorer took latitude observations at 11 points, and determined the height of 31 places. During the years 1870-71 geographical information of great (8967.) C"], [42, "34 WORK OF MAJOR ST. JOHN. importance was obtained in Persia and Baluchistan by the Frontier Commission, under Sir Frederick Goldsmid, and by Captain St. John. Majors St. John and Lovett, R.E., are now engaged in placing on record the results of their geographical labours in Baluchistan and Sistan. On their completion, the first-named officer will compile from these, and other earlier data, a map on the scale of 16 inches to the mde, of the whole of the territories of the Shah. (A similar work has, it is known, been under preparation for some years by the Russian staff, but no copy has reached this country.) A brief sketch of the advances made in our geographical knowledge of Persia during the last nine years wdl not be out of place here. When officers of engineers were sent to Persia, in 1864, to construct the telegraph from the Turkish frontier to Tehran, and thence to Bushir, it occurred to Colonel Walker that their presence might be utilized not only to extend topographical knowledge of the country, but to fix accurately the difference of longitude of the various cities of importance on the Hne, by means of the telegraph itself. After some correspondence on the subject with Captain (then Lieutenant) St. John, superintendent of the telegraph in Southern Persia, a detailed proposal was submitted by Colonel Walker to the Secretary of State for India, and met with his approval, subject to the consent of the Persian Government, to be obtained through Her Majesty's Minister at the court of Tehran. The answer of the British Minister was adverse to the proposal, and the matter fell to the ground. In 1866, however, with the limited means at his disposal, Lieutenant St. John made a survey of the country in the vicinity of the line of telegraph in his own immediate district, based on latitudes fixed by sextant. He also made a section of the country between Tehran and the Persian GuH by aneroid and hypsometric observations. Being on leave in England, in 1867, he submitted to the India Office the result of his work, with a request that the necessary instruments might be allowed him to carry out Colonel Walker's scheme as far as possible, showing from his own experience that no difficulties were to be apprehended either from the Persian Govern ment or people in carrying out geographical observations. A second application to Her Majesty's Legation at Tehran, based upon these grounds, met with a more favourable response ; and the necessary funds (2502.) were placed at Lieutenant St. John's disposal, together with an order on the Survey Department at Calcutta to supply him with the instruments there obtainable."], [43, "35 WORK OF MAJOR LOVETT. Captain St. John's absence in Abyssinia prevented his doing anything tiU the following year (1868), but towards its close he purchased the necessary instruments, and returned to Persia. He then made the necessary arrangements with Captain Pierson, R.E., for fixing the differences of longitude between Tehran and other towns on the line of telegraph ; but before they could be carried into effect, Captain Pierson was ordered to England, whence he did not return till the close of 1869. In the next year (1870) Captain St. John's duties detained him at Tehran, and it was not tdl the winter of 1870-71 that he and Captain Pierson were able to complete their work. During Captain St. John's journey from Tehran to Bushire at that time (CaptainPierson remaining at Tehran) they fixed the difference of longitude of Tehran from K6m, Kashan, Ispahan, Abadeh, Shiraz, and Bushire itself. By the co-operation of Captain Stiffe, late Indian navy, one of the authors of the latest chart of the Persian GuH, Captain St. John was enabled to fix, by means of the submarine telegraph, the difference of longitude between Bushire and Karachi, thus connecting his Persian work with India. In the summer of 1871, Colonel Walker's presence in England enabled Captain St. John and Pierson to complete the chain of observations between England and India by exchanging time signals between Tehran and London. The result was most gratifying. The accepted longitude of the Madras Observatory, as ascertained by direct astronomical observations, is 80\u00b0 14' 19\". As fixed by the telegraph it is 80\u00b0 14' 43\", a difference not more than is easily attributable 'to the personal errors of the observers, who had no chronographs, and used Troughton and Simms' reflecting circles of 6-inch radius, with telescopic power necessarily smaU. Thus, not only are the longitudes of the principal cities in Persia fixed with very great accuracy, but the starting point of the Indian Surveys is proved to be laid down on the earth's surface within a very small fraction of the truth. This valuable proof was moreover obtained without any expenditure by government beyond the cost of the necessary instruments, having been purely a labour of love on the part of the officers concerned. To return to the topographical work. In 1870-71 Captain St. John laid down the features of the rest of the country in the vicinity of the telegraph between Tehran and Bushire, aU the routes between the last city and Shiraz, the summer road between that town and Ispahan, and with the assistance of Captain Pierson some interesting vaUeys in the Elburz mountains north of Tehran. The c2"], [44, "36 SIR FREDERIC GOLDSMID. total area embraced by his work amounted to nearly 50,000 square mdes. In 1870 Colonel, now Sir F. Goldsmid, was ordered to proceed to Persia to carry out a settlement of the Sistan and Baluchistan frontiers. His appHcation for the services of Captains St. John or Pierson to make the necessary surveys was unsuccessful, as they could not be spared from their work at Tehran, and another officer of the telegraph, Captain Beresford Lovett, R.E., was therefore detached with him. Circumstances prevented the expedition pro ceeding to Sistan, but in Baluchistan much valuable information was obtained. Captain Lovett made a Compass Survey checked by observations for latitude from Gwadar to Bampur, thence via Pishin to Panjgur, and back to the sea by a different route, altogether nearly 800 mdes of road, covering an area of 20,000 square mdes. Other routes were surveyed by Major Ross and Quarter-Master Serjeant Bower, R.E. The greater part of the country thus delineated had never before been visited by a European. Important as were the scientific results thus obtained the objects of the expedition were not fully attained. The actual frontier had only been crossed in two places, and could thus only be laid down by hearsay. On his return, therefore, Sir F. Goldsmid recommended that Captain St. John should be sent with Commissioners from Persia and Kelat to lay down the features of the country on both sides of the frontier. Accordingly, in January 1872, Captain St. John left Gwadm, accompanied by Mr. W. T. Blanford, of the Geological Survey, and with considerable difficulty succeeded in passing along the greater portion of the frontier line, which Hes for the most part in an uninhabited wdderness. On reaching Jalk, which Captain St. John's observations placed 45' further south than the position assigned to it on maps, and which Hes at the edge of the great Sistan desert, they turned their steps westward, finding the passage across the desert to the Helmund impracticable. They then traversed the highlands of Central Baluchistan, foUowing nearly the route taken by Sir H. Pottinger in 1809, and arrived at Bampur early in Aprd. Thence they foUowed the road traversed by Sir F. Goldsmid the preceding year to Kerman, from which city they travelled to Shiraz. The whole of this route of 1,200 miles from Gwadur to Shiraz was measured by perambulating wheels, the total error in longitude on arriving at Shiraz, the first place whose longi tude was accurately known, being a little over one per cent in"], [45, "37 NEW MAP OF WESTERN ASIA longitude, or three fourths per cent, of the whole distance travelled. The positions of the important towns of Bampur, Bam, and Kerman have thus been laid down with considerable accuracy. The altera tions in existing maps are very considerable. Captain St. John places Bampur 19 miles east of the position assigned to it by Captain Lovett, and Kerman 17 mdes west of that chronometricaUy ascer tained by Khanikoff. The direction of mountain chains in South- Eastern Persia is also shown by Captain St. John to be identical with those in the west, viz., N.W. and S.E., and not as shown on existing maps, east and west. The altitude of the principal peaks was found to be about 15,000 feet above the sea. During the journey from Gwadur to Tehran Mr. Blanford made, in addition to a geological section, a large zoological coUection, which, added to a number of specimens previously coUected by Captain St. John for the Calcutta Museum, furnishes data for a very complete account of the fauna of Persia, as yet almost undescribed. Al together specimens of 250 birds, eight of which, at least, are new to science, were obtained, besides 50 reptdes and a large number of mammals and fish. The coUection is particularly interesting as fixing the geographical limits of many European and Indian forms. In 1871-72 Sir F. Goldsmid completed his labours by a journey to Sistan. He was met by Captain Lovett at Bam, where that officer had traveUed via Shiraz and Kerman, visiting the little known district of Khabbis en route. From Bam the party traveUed across the Kerman desert to Sistan, whence after a stay of six weeks they journeyed, via Birjand, Kain, Bajistan, and Turbat-i- Haidari, to Meshed, and thence to Tehran. The total distance traversed and surveyed by Captain Lovett from Shiraz to Tehran to 2,700 mdes, of which half at least had never been previously delineated with any accuracy. Altogether, the united labours of Captains St. John and Lovett have given us 6,000 mdes of route survey, covering nearly 200,000 square mdes of country. Besides the new map of Persia, Captain Felix Jones, of the late Indian Navy, is engaged, under orders from the Secretary of State, on the preparation of a map of Western Asia, including the vaUeys of the Euphrates and Tigris, from the materials accumulated by the surveyors of the Indian Navy and other observers, a large mass of hitherto neglected material wdl be utilised, and a most valuable map wdl be the result. The map wdl consist of four double-elephant sheets. The first, or N.W. sheet, includes the range of the Taurus"], [46, "38 MADRAS MANUALS. and the watersheds of the Euphrates and Tigris, from Erzeroun to the northern slopes of the Lebanon. The second, or N.E. sheet, wiU extend from Erzeroun to the frontiers of Russia, Persia, and Turkey around Ararat, and the Turco-Persian frontier, as far as the Fak-i-Gyrra Pass in Persian-Turkistan. The third, or S.W. sheet, will embrace Syria, south of the Lebanon, to the Suez Canal and Mount Sinai, besides a portion of the Euphrates. The fourth sheet takes in Mesopotamia to the Persian GuH, and the rest of the Turco- Persian frontier. Captain FeHx Jones has nearly completed the first, second, and fourth sheets in outline, and has finished the portions covered by the Mesoptamian Surveys, and the Turco-Persian frontier map. The third sheet wdl contain the new work now in progress under the auspices of the Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund. The Madras Government have ordered manuals of the different CoUectorates in their Presidency to be compded and published, under the supervision of the Board of Revenue. The first which appeared was on the Madura country, by Mr. J. H. Nelson, of the Madras Civil Service, pubUshed in 1868 .1 It contains an account of the physical geography of the district, its forests, lakes, fauna, flora, mineralogy, climate, and diseases ; details respecting the castes into which the population is divided, and a political history, ancient and modern. There are also fuU details respecting the land tenures, revenue, administration, pubUc work, and educational progress. The manual of the Vizagapatam district,2 compded by Mr. Car michael, appeared in 1869. It is preparedin the same form, but is less voluminous. The third is on the Belary District, by Mr. Kelsall. In the first part there is a general description of the country, and chapters on the climate, population, diseases, geology, fauna, and flora. The second part contains the political history, and an account of the revenue and other departments ; and the third part gives detafls of the agriculture, trade, and manufactures, dis pensaries, schools, and missions.

The ornithological portion, illustrated by 32 coloured plates, is by Mr. Hume ; the chapter on insects by Mr. Bates; and there are also a Ust of plants, with coloured dlustrations, and a series of meteorological observations. Altogether, 158 species of birds were observed, but of these only 59 belong to the hills and plains of Yarkand, of which seven are pro bably new to science. The most interesting of the new species is a noble falcon, which Mr. Hume believes to be the \" shanghar \" of Eastern works on falconry. The study of the collection points to the conclusion that Central Asia, although visited by numbers of northern and southern Asiatic forms, possesses a distinct resident avi-fauna. More than one tenth of the birds that were seen in Yarkand are unknown both to the northern and southern sections of the continent. The peculiar forms, besides the falcon, are a crested lark, a stone-chat, a wren warbler, and a red-legged partridge. One of the breeding-haunts of the Indian winter visitants has been found in Yarkand. The little warbler performs an annual migration across a lofty desert a hundred miles wide, and over snow-capped ridges 18,000 feet above the sea, in travelling from Yarkand to Southern India and back again. One of the most striking points in the observations of Dr. Henderson is the great altitudes at which many species of birds seem perfectly at their ease. The cuckoo was seen on the branches of a birch-tree 11,000 feet above the sea ; the hoopoe was quite at home at 18,000 feet ; a i \" Memoir of the Codugu Survey, commonly written Koorg,\" by Lieut.

The first high snowy range of the Himalayas, we are told by Mr. Hume, defines the area of distribution of a large proportion of species. Many birds occur south of the first snowy range, from the Panjab to Sikkim, which are never found north of that line, except where some large river breaks through the range, and enables them to creep a short distance up the vaUey. Many, too, are found throughout the midland Himalayas which are never met with south of that range. Mr. Hume beHeves this sharp definition of range to be due to an equally sharp definition of climate. South of the range is a moist cUmate and periodical rains, while to the north of it there is an excessively dry climate varied only by occasional showers. South of it there is luxuriant vegetation, to the north a stunted flora. Among the insects coUected was the \"painted lady\" at the northern foot of the Kuen Lun Mountains, a species of almost universal distribution. Of the other two species of butterflies, Mr. Bates remarks that they are remarkable for the great elevation at which they were found, the highest yet recorded in the flight of butterflies. Both {Parnassius and Mesapia) are exclusively con fined to mountain ranges, and to the northern hemisphere. The Parnassius was found, by Dr. Henderson, from 17,000 to 19,690 feet above the sea, and there can be Httle doubt that the food plant of its caterpiUar grows in the same zone as the perfect insect. Among cultivated plants, Dr. Henderson noticed cotton, flax, tobacco, plums, apricots, pears, apples, melons, cucumber, goinds, figs, mulberries, hemp, walnuts, poplars, rice, maize, millet, wheat, barley, cabbages, radishes, beans and peas in the neighbourhood of Yarkand.

The death of Mr. John Walker, the geographer to the Secretary of State for India, took place in April 1873. Mr. Walker had been geographer to the East India Company and to the Secretary of State for India for the last 48 years. His father worked for Alexander DaHymple, and engraved the maps for Parry's and Franklin's voyages, for Vincent's N\u00e6archus, for Salt's Abyssinia, and for many other works, published in the end of the last and beginning of the present century. The son was thoroughly trained as a carto grapher and engraver, and in 1825 he was appointed to compile and engrave the sheets of the Atlas of India. The amount of judgment and ability he brought to the great task he undertook is shown by the often disputed but ever approved exceUence of his work; and there has always been the highest testimony to the accuracy and excellent style with which Mr. Walker has brought 1 p. 67. 2 (Confidential.) \"Central Asia,\" Part II.

He has also produced many general maps of great value, and engraved 87 out of the 200 charts pub- Ushed from surveys executed by officers of the Indian Navy. But the most beautiful specimens of Mr. Walker's work are his produc tion of Colonel Robinson's remarkable survey of Jhilam and Rawal Pindi, on 28 sheets, and his maps showing the results of Major Montgomerie's surveys in Jummu and Kashmir.1 Mr. Walker was in his 86th year. He had been in failing health for the last two years, and died on the 19th of April 1873. He had just received a complimentary letter, addressed to him by order of the Duke of ArgyU, on the value of his long and zealous services. The catalogue of maps and other geographical documents belong ing to the India Office is nearly printed, and wiU be ready for deUvery in the course of the summer. The uses of this collection were fully explained in the abstract for 1870-71 ;2 and the incon venience and injury to the public service caused by the want of adequate space for its proper arrangement were dwelt upon.3 This inconvenience is more felt every year. The importance of providing the necessary space for the geographical coUection is increased by the danger of having both originals and duplicates of reports, and numerical data of surveys, in one office at Calcutta. None of the dupUcates have been sent home since 1865 ; and the Surveyor General is anxious that one complete set should be safely lodged in the Geographical Department of the India Office. Space is stiU needed for its suitable arrangement, as weU as for that of the maps and plans. In the meanwhile every effort is made to render the present state of things as little injurious to the public service as possible. During the long period that the Dutch held sway on the west coast of India and in Ceylon, many maps, charts, and plans were prepared, and a large number are now preserved in the royal archives of the Hague. Eighty of these Dutch maps have been copied for the Geographical Department of the India Office, and have now been added to this national collection. Some of them are very quaintly ornamented, others are enriched with carefully executed coloured sketches of towns and forts, and several are of considerable value. Among them may be enumerated the following, in order to give an 1 For a more detailed account of Mr. John Walker's labours, see the \u00b0 Memoir on the Indian Surveys,\" p. 281, 282, and 283. 2 P- 69- 3 See \u00ab Abstract,\" for 1870-71, p. 56."], [51, "COPIES OF DUTCH MAPS AND CHARTS. 43 idea of the character of the whole set, for which the country is indebted to the courtesy of the Netherlands Government : \u2014 A chart of the Persian Gulf, of the 17th century, with soundings along the Persian shore, and along the Arabian shore from Maskat to Cape Masandim.

A more thorough and exhaustive search has been made for the missing memoirs referred to in the \" Memoir on the Indian Surveys,\" and for other geographical documents ; and several have been found. There being no catalogue of these manuscripts a dihgent search was the only possible means of discovering them. Of the seven foUo volumes of Colin Mackenzie's Survey of the Mysore, four have been found and restored to the Geographical Department.1 Two missing volumes of the Travancor Memoir and two of the Dindigul Memoir have also been found.2 The other documents that have been added to the collection in the Geographical Department are the original manuscripts of the journal of Dr. Buchanan during his journey to Ava in 1795, and that of Captain Kirkpatriek on Nepal in 1793, a geographical sketch of Assam, in three parts, by Wade, a route from Chunargur to Rajmahendri, by Lieut. James Blunt, in 1795, and notes on the western frontier of India, by Captain Williams, with a descriptive index of his map (1809-10) .3 But the most interesting manuscripts that have been found are the Memoirs on Afghanistan by Mr. Richard Strachey, Lieut. Irvine, and Lieut. Macartney. The memoir on a map of Kabul and the adjacent countries by Lieut. Macartney is most valuable. About half of it was published as an appendix to Elphinstone's Cabul. The remainder has never been printed. It contains interesting in formation relating to Shighnan, Wakhan, and other districts of the upper Oxus, which have recently excited much discussion with reference to the correspondence on the northern boundary of Afghanistan. During the year 1872 sets of maps were presented to the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, to the Privy Councd Office for the use of the Judicial Committee, to Sir PhHip Wodehouse the Governor of Bombay, to Colonel Yule, C.B., for use in bis geo graphical studies, to the Royal Geographical Society, to the Topographical Department of the War Office, to the British Museum, to the Radclyffe Library at Oxford, and numerous scientific and other bodies. Regular progress has been made in mounting the permanent coUection of maps and plans. From 180 to 200 were mounted during the year 1872 ; making a total of 700 mounted since that work was commenced.

Dry paper prints of 50, 54, 89, and 104 have been sent out to Colonel Thuillier, and meanwhile additions and corrections are being made to the plates to the extent of the materials available for the purpose in this country. (3.) I constructed skeleton charts for the guidance of the engravers, show ing the projections of the lines of latitude and longitude for each of the following new plates :\u2014 69 S.E., 70 N.E.,71 S.E.,71 S.W., 90 N.E, 90 N.W, 92 S.E., 126 (all four sections), 127 (all four sections), and 128 N.E. On those for plates 126, 127, and 128 I projected all the Trigonometrical Stations and a number of Revenue Survey Stations, and instructed Mr. Malby, to whom the plates were entrusted, to insert these points on the plates in the first instance, and afterwards to fit the topographical details of the maps in between them. (4.) I also prepared skeleton charts for plates 133 and 134, but as the maps which contain the geographical materials for these plates have neither latitudes nor longitudes nor any of the stations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, it was impossible to fit their details with appropriate accuracy into the Indian Atlas, and this cannot now be done until the meridians and parallels or the positions of the Trigonometrical Stations have been inserted on the maps in the Surveyor-General's Office at Calcutta. For these reasons I have been unable to make arrangements for engraving plates 133 and 134, but Mr. Malby is quite ready to take them in hand on receiving suitably prepared maps for the purpose, and as they join on to the sheets 126, 127, and 128 which he is engraving, it is desirable that he should have them if they cannot be conve niently engraved in the Surveyor-General's Office. (5.) All necessary instructions regarding the work to be done in each instance have been communicated to Mr. Malby and Mr. Connell, both verbally and by letter. I have particularly requested them not to make any attempts to harmonize and adjust discrepancies which they may meet with in the geo graphical materials with which they have been furnished, but in such cases to leave blanks on the copper plates to be filled in on the proofs which are sent to the Surveyor-General for examination and correction ; after the return of the proofs the blanks must be filled in on the copper plates. It is not the business of the engraver to harmonize discrepancies but merely to copy his originals exactly, and when discrepancies are met with to leave them to be adjusted by the proper authorities. (6.) In selecting the plates to be placed in the hands of engravers in this country I have been guided by the Surveyor-General's letter, No. F./188, dated 13 June 1871, to the Secretary to Government of India, Department of (8967.) D"], [58, "50 APPENDIX. Agriculture, Revenue, and Commerce, and by the Index Chart accompanying that document, and first took up the plates \u2014 coloured yellow in the chart \u2014 for which materials were stated to have been supplied. I found very little material for 70 NE. and 90 N.E., but as Colonel Thuillier has repeatedly expressed to me his anxiety to have as much of the engraving done in this country as is possible, I placed the plates in the hands of the engravers, and also the plates of the contiguous sheets 69 S.E. and 90 N.W., for which I found as much material available, though they are not specified in the Index Chart. 54 (full plate) also is not specified, but finding considerable additional materials for it I made it over to Mr. Connell. 105 S.W. is specified, but no materials whatever were to be met with, and as the lines of latitude and longitude and the margins of this plate had been already engraved under Mr. John Walker's superintendence, I have directed Mr. Connell to make the plate over to this office for transmission to India. 133 and 134 are also specified, but for reasons in para. (4) they could not be taken in hand. (7.) With the object of rendering all possible assistance to Colonel Thuillier I have gone over the whole of the Atlas Sheets, and made out a list of those which, though not specified in the letter and index chart above referred to, are at present incomplete, and may be completed in this country if the geographical materials can be conveniently supplied by Col. Thuillier. Dry paper prints of the plates of these sheets have been sent out to the Surveyor-General's Office, in order that the requisite additions may, if possible, be made to them, after which they would be returned to be placed in the hands of engravers in this country. The sheets in question are as follows : \u2014 8 N.E and S.E. 28 full plate. 51 N.W. 70 N.W. and S.W. 71 N.E. and N.W. 90 S.E. 91 N.E. and S.E. 105S.E. and N.W. The plates of these sheets should be retained in this office until it is known whether Col. Thuillier would wish to have them completed in England, or sent out to India for completion in his office. ' (8.) Estimates have been received from Messrs. Malby and Connell of the probable cost of the work they have undertaken to perform, and the probable period required for its completion in each instance.

These estimates are only given as an approximation, it being understood that if any saving can be effected the Indian Government will have the benefit of such saving, and on the other hand, if the expenses are found to exceed the estimate the charges must be increased. It must be further borne in mind that in each instance the estimate given is that for performing the amount of work specified in my letters of instruction ; if the proofs of their work are materially altered or added to when under examination in the Surveyor- General's office, a proportionate increase must be allowed to the engraver's charges. (9.) I am informed that the work is well advanced towards completion. I have received from Mr. Malby a proof of 64 S.W. which contains a very large amount of elaborate hill etching for the delineation of portions of the Himalayan ranges ; I consider it to be very satisfactory, quite as good, if not superior to anything in the previously published sheets of the Atlas. I forwarded it to Col. Thuillier for his inspection, and I give his opinion of it in his own words : \" Mr. Malby's proof of No. 64 is excellent, very artistic, and in \u25a0*** good relief; he will do the work admirably. It would take us a very long \" time indeed to do such sheets as these ; I shall be very glad to see these \" long pending sheets turned out of hand.\" Mr. Connell has submitted proofs of the following plates for my inspection: \u2014 1 S.E. Writing and outline completed, hills not commenced. 71 S.W. Outline (very intricate) completed, writing and hills not com- menced. 71 S.E. Outline and writing completed, hills not commenced. 89. Outline and writing completed, hills not commenced. The hill engravers employed by Mr. Connell have been engaged for some time past in the very heavy hill work required for 46, which is expected to be completed in two months. As Mr. Connell employs the very men who were employed by Mr. John Walker for many years past in engraving the Atlas sheets, I have every reason to believe that the character of the work will not be at all inferior to what it has been hitherto. (10.) As it will be necessary for me to return to India shortly, before the work can be completed by the engravers, I would suggest that the proofs of the several plates which will be handed in to this office, as each is completed to the extent of the materials given to the engravers, be immediately forwarded * This plate is now completed. D 2"], [60, "52 APPENDIX. to Col. Thuillier by Mr. Markham, two or three copies of each proof being sent, aa a single copy will not suffice for the requirements of the Surveyor- General's office. One of the copies should be printed on dry paper for correc tion in India and return to the engraver ; if the corrections are numerous and several additions have been made to the proof \u2014 as may be the case when new geooraphical materials have meanwhile been acquired in India \u2014 it will be necessary to send a second proof out to India for examination and correction. If, however, the corrections are few and unimportant, it will be desirable to avoid the loss of time occasioned by a second reference to India ; the engraver should be required to certify on the second proof that it has been compared with the corrected first proof, and found correct in all respects. Mr. Markham might then give the requisite order for printing as many copies as are required, and for the disposal of the copper plate. I make these suggestions because there is no sufficient establishment in this office for the careful comparison of a large number of proofs with the original drawings, and the engravers being ignorant of this circumstance, might suppose that the examination in this office would obviate the necessity for very careful examination on their own part. The signature of the vouching authority should always be affixed to such documents ; and in addition to this, the number of each successive proof \u2014 whether first, second, &c. \u2014 and the dates of its passing through this office and the Surveyor-General's office, should also be written on it, that it may be readily identified when necessary, and that in cases of delay \u2014 such as very frequently occurred under the old arrangements\u2014 the cause of the delay may be traced to the proper quarter. I may state that the entire absence of all such information in a large number of the documents which have passed through my hands in this Office, have caused me much embarrassment, and materially delayed the completion of the work I had to do. (11.) The following arrangements have been made regarding the disposal of the copper plates in England. On the 4th June I submitted a suggestion to the Secretary of State \u2014 with reference to Col. ThuiUier's letter, No. 354, dated 22nd February 1872 \u2014 that the copper plates should be despatched to India, ten at a time, by successive mails ; first, those that are completed and specified in Col. Thuillier's letter as most urgently required in India ; secondly, the completed plates not specified by Col. Thuillier ; and finally, all the plates now or about to be placed in the hands of the engravers (see paras. 1 and 7), after completion to the extent of the geographical materials at present avail able in this country and about to be sent home by Col. Thuillier. I further suggested that a sufficient number of prints should be taken from each plate before its despatch to India to meet the probable requirements in this country for some time to come. My suggestions were duly sanctioned, but considerable delay has occurred in having them carried out. I am informed that the necessary supply of the following plates for stock in this office has been printed, and that the plates are now available for disnatch to Tndin. : \u2014 1 (a.)

Thuillier, in his No. 402 (f), dated 5th August, has indented for 300 impressions of several of these plates or for the plates themselves, as the stock of impressions in India is entirely exhausted. He remarks that his office is quite competent to print the impressions if it possessed the plates, and he considers it very desirable on every account that the plates should be deposited in his office. (12.) I have only to add that I have made over Mr. John Walker's brass scale, from which all measurements for the copper plates of the Indian Atlas have been taken, to the custody of Mr. Markham. J. T. Walker, Col., R.E. India Office, 27th September 1872. NOTE OF THE PROGRESS SINCE COLONEL WALKER'S DEPARTURE. The engraving of the Indian Atlas plates entrusted to Messrs. Malby and Connell by Colonel Walker, as detailed in the preceding memorandum, has been steadily pushed forward since that officer's departure. Out of a total of 6 full plates and 25 quarter plates handed over to the engravers, proofs have been submitted of 5 full and 11 quarter plates. The engraving of the remaining plates is nearly completed, and proofs are now expected. In addition to the plates mentioned above, five more quarter sections have"], [62, "54 APPENDIX. been handed over for engraving, the Surveyor-General having caused the blanks on the proofs to be completely filled up from the results of surveys in progress. This makes the whole number of quarter plates at present being engraved in England 28, two having been completed and awaiting transmission to India. The plates themselves are in various stages of completion, the amount of engraving requisite varying extremely, according to individual cases. A detailed statement showing the progress made with each plate is subjoined. All the plates not actually in, or about to be placed in, the hands of engravers in this country have been forwarded to India for permanent deposit in the Surveyor-General's office at Calcutta. 1 S.E.

Return to an Order of the Financial Department of the Government of India* for the information of the Indian Finance Committee of the House of Commons, as to the Surveys carried on under the Government of India for the season 1870-71, the work performed and the cost thereof, corresponding with the actual expense shown in the Budget Estimates for that year. By Colonel H. L. Thuillier, C.S.I., F.R.S., &c. Surveyor-General of India. 1. The Imperial Survey carried on under the Government of India is of three kinds : \u2014 Trigonometrical, for the accurate fixing of all 'important places, and showing the latitudes, longitudes, and heights above the mean sea level of such a number of obligatory and other points as to form a complete basis for the connexion and starting of all other Surveys. Topographical, on a trigonometrical basis by breaking up the principal triangles obtained with the larger instruments into secondary and tertiary triangles, by means of which the topography is depicted by plane table sketching on a minor scale. Revenue or Fiscal, which is likewise a good Topographical Survey on a larger scale, with the depiction of the boundary of every village or parish, as well as of districts and other subdivisions in the revenue-paying champaign provinces. 2. The following is a general outline of the several heads of account of the expenditure incurred, and of the system prevailing, in a Trigonometrical - 70,000 succinct and brief form, on the supposition that no previous RerenSf1110-1 - looiooo acquaintance with the Indian system prevails, and has jemooo heen prepared under the extreme haste with which the information has been called for. The allotted budget estimates for the entire department amount in round numbers to 240,000/., distributed as per margin. * No. 3494 dated 27th October with Despatch No. 323 dated 22nd August 1872 of Secretary of State."], [64, "56 APPENDIX. 3 The great Trigonometrical Survey is under special management, and the general operations are fully described in the chart of triangulation published with the Annual Administrative Keport of that branch of the Department, showing precisely to what extent the great triangulation has passed over the whole of India, and what blanks remain to be filled up. ; _ 4 The several field or executive parties, as per margin ,* were at work in the \u2022 6 skeleton Principal season referred to, for which the fuU details i and the s 'Kpogmphkai. various particulars and cost of the operations will be found 2 Astronomical. jn the abstract report dated the 19th December, now iPe'ndXm. rendered bythe superintendent of this branch, Colonel Walker, K.E., and in his printed annual Administration t5Itedthe ist December 1871.

Hilly British Non-Kegulation Territory, on the minor scale of 1 inch per mile, progress at the rate of about 1 6,000 to 20,000 square miles per annum, by the agency of seven distinct executive parties (one being in abeyance during the season referred to for want of funds) as specified in the margin. 6. During this season 14,592 square miles of Survey were effected at an actual cost of 3,45,242. The Survey is effected entirely on a trigonome trical basis, the great triangles being broken up into minor triangles of convenient small sides, suitable for sketching the features of the country by plane table, which is sufficient for general military purposes and for filling up the Atlas of India by reduction from the 1 inch to the -\\ inch scale, and is as large as a first delineation of such rugged and unprofitable ground, paying no revenue to Government, warrants. 7. The mean average cost per square mile of this description of Survey comes to about 22 Ks., or 21. 4*. The average for the season 1870-71 was Ks. 23-3 annas. 8. The equipment, training, constitution, and procedure of these topographical parties is special and totally different to that of other Survey establishments required for revenue or minute land measurements on a large scale. One system and one scale of Survey for all India is not applicable or practicable, and therefore the machinery is adapted to the particular wants and necessities of so vast an empire, so as to deal with champaign rich revenue-paying districts as well as hilly, rugged, and unprofitable countries, in a way suitable to each. 9. The nature of, and the reasons for, the expense incurred on account of the Topographical Surveys will be understood from the following analysis of the actual outlay for a single season : \u2014"], [65, "APPENDIX. 57 Executive Department, ok Field Establishments.

There is an immense area remaining to be effected on the 1-inch scale by these topographical parties of all the portions of the native states not yet taken up, but urgently required for military, geographical, and other purposes. Each existing party has at least from 10 to 15 years work before it, and possibly more. The annual printed report by the Surveyor-General for this season, dated 15th January 1872, enters fully into more minute details con nected with the work in question, its nature, precise locality, and cost, and may be referred to if required. 11. The topographical operations divided into provinces and Native states may be summed up as follows as to what has been already done, what remains to be done, with a rough approximate estimate of the time required to finish present projects. But there is no fixity to the wants and requirements of India, as its resources become better developed ; the estimate cannot therefore be entirely depended upon.

The above is all that has been done by the present system of Topo graphical Surveys in the Madras presidency, but the officers of the old military institution acted as the pioneers of survey early in the present century in delineating the Southern Peninsula on the 1 -inch scale, from which the existing sheets of the Indian Atlas have been published. A new Revenue Cadastral Survey of the whole of the Madras districts has been in progress for the last 15 years under separate superintendence in that presidency, but no new geo graphical results have been furnished therefrom up to date. The imperative necessity of utilising some of the Revenue Surveys for geographical purposes has been strongly insisted on. 22. A Topographical Survey on the small scale of \\ inch to the mile, which may be more fairly termed a close reconnaissance, has been made of the Pegu division of British Burmah under the local administration, and independent of this department, on an independent basis, prior to the extension of the Great Triangulation in this direction. The area completed and mapped on the above scale is 32,250 square miles, the general map of which in sour sheets has been lithographed in this office. It is probable that an entirely new Survey conducted on rigorous principles and based on the Great Triangulation, partially carried in this direction, will be necessary for the Pegu and Martaban division, as well as of the whole of the Tenasserim provinces never yet surveyed. 22.

The above figures are very approximate, as the results of the Bombay Revenue measurements are altogether unknown, and how far any of the work may be susceptible of incorporation with the ordinary topographical maps for the purposes of geography and the Atlas of India it is impossible to say. Remaining to be completed. Likely to occupy 50,000. 25 years, for a single party. But with additional working power the time may be decreased in proportion."], [68, "60 APPENDIX. 23. For the last 30 or 40 years no geographical contributions whatever have been made from the Bombay Presidency towards the filling up of the sheets of the Atlas, which are peculiarly blank throughout the northern division of the Presidency, but great exertions have lately been made by this department to r alter this state of things, and to obtain proper agency for GBranc^n\u00b0;}Guzeraat!' regular topographical surveys of the blank portions.

Consequently, the first survey of India, which is so urgently needed for all purposes of administration, and which is so moderate in its mean average cost per square mile, which may be taken at 21. Us., will no doubt, when com- pleted, have to give place to some extent to a more minute and superior style of survey, on improved scales, and executed at a higher cost. 25. By the joint efforts of the several branches of the Imperial Survey of India an area of 35,000 to 40,000 square miles is annually effected, mapped, and for the most part published in a preliminary style, within the same period. The progress and outturn of course depends much on many local causes over which the executives have but little control. 26.

'29. The village system, or definition of revenue boundaries and ascertainment of areas, forms again the basis for the more minute record of the measurement of \" Fields \" on a scale four times larger, or an approach to the cadastral system, for the record of every holding, which has heretofore been conducted according to the primitive native system of measuring land, in conformity with the know ledge and experience of the native landowners and cultivators of the soil, with and on which operation, checked and confined by the professional or Enghsh survey, the settlements with the people have heretofore been conducted. This rough and antiquated process by native agency, and according to native ideas and systems only, it is now in contemplation to exchange for the more reliable and correct method of a regular Cadastral Survey on an adequate scale, like that of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain on the 25 inch \u2022= 1 mile scale, which it is believed will be found more worthy and reliable, as a basis for the revenue assessment and Government demand, of an empire depending so entirely almost on its land revenue. 30. There is still much remaining to be accomplished by this description of survey, viz., the greater portion of the North-Western Provinces, a proper re-survey of which has only recently been commenced, to supply the loss caused by the mutiny, and in order to meet the requirements of a new settlement. The Delhi Division west of Jumna River, transferred to the Punjab, together with the Derajat west of the Indus up to British frontier, now ripe for revenue or fiscal investigation. Also a few remaining districts in the Central Provinces, as well as some in Assam of the Lower Provinces. The above will occupy existing establishments many years. The total expenditure for this branch of the department for the season under report amounts to Rs. 889,433 including the Revenue Administrative Office. 31. With the above general explanation of the nature of and the reasons for the expenditure, on account of the revenue or fiscal surveys of this side of India, as conducted under the Imperial Government, further details as to progress and cost, with the budget actual expenditure, will be found in the annexed Report of the Superintendents of that branch of the department dated 21st December 1872. \u2014 Appendix A. 32.

The specific purposes for which these several establishments are required are as follows : No. 1 is for the conduct of the general business, correspondence, and accounts, entailed by the control and supervision of the department, the custody and maintenance of the records, the issue of published maps, and various miscellaneous duties. It is the geographical depot for the whole of India. 34. No. 2 is for the geographical business connected with the examination, compilation, drawing, and reduction of maps on all scales, as rendered by the executives, and geographical materials derived thereon, preparatory to publication, for the revision of the proofs from the several printing presses, and the con struction of the sheets of the Atlas of India, in manuscript, to be put into the engravers hands, as well as the colouring of all printed maps, and meeting the wants of the several local Governments. This branch is under the immediate superintendence of J. O. N. James, Esq., Assistant Surveyor-General, a departmental officer of great experience. In 1870-71 the work completed was as follows: \u2014 General maps and extensive compilations on various scales - 14 Quarter sheets of the Indian atlas, 4 miles = 1-inch - 32 Sheet maps of old Topographical Surveys, 1-inch scale, re- drawn for photozincography - - - - 29 Miscellaneous maps, charts, and extracts 20 Maps coloured, corrected, &c. - 23,321 35. No. 3 is for the copper-plate engraving of the final results of the survey on the sheets of the Indian Atlas, as well as other provincial and miscellaneous maps on various scales, as only very lately established in India and transferred from the geographer to the Secretary of State at the India Office. The European staff sent out from England is now training the native agency largely. Great advantages have already resulted from the conduct of this most important part of the work, so intimately connected with the Survey of India, under proper professional supervision and instruction at the head quarters of the department tt-\u201e tv \u00ab._ o in India.

No. 5 is for copying and printing maps for each branch of the department by the lithographic process, and issue for all subjects requiring revision and re-copying, and which are not adapted for reproduction by the photographic process. It is also necessary for the speedy publication of the maps on both the one-inch and quarter-inch scales, urgently demanded by all local officers, as preliminary productions before the engraving of the latter can be executed. All general and useful maps of provinces or districts are treated in this manner. An average of 100,000 copies of maps of various sorts are struck off annually by this process. The details of work produced in this branch of my office are given in a report by Capt. W. G. Murray, Assistant Surveyor-General in immediate charge. Appendix B. Photographic Department. 38. No. 6 is of modern adoption, and enables us now to produce all the results of the current surveys, prepared expressly for this object, rapidly and effectively, which before were never printed or published in any form prior to the engraving on the small scale. By a combination of system in the preparation of the manuscript maps, they are now susceptible of immediate photographic reproduction and transfers to zinc without any hand copying at all, and the public service is immensely benefited thereby. The perfection to which this art is now brought, and the great facility with which the transfers are effected, owing materially to the beauty of the original drawings, but also in a measure to superior manipulation of the process, has proved of immense value to the department, and to all administrative officers interested in getting the results of good surveys for all local purposes. About 100,000 copies of maps are now turned out by this process alone annually. 39. The general results achieved in this I ranch of my office, with the details of expenditure, are well described in the separate report appended by Captain Waterhouse, Assistant Surveyor General.

Under the immediate superintendence of the Deputy Surveyor- General, this establishment is a valuable adjunct to the Survey Department, for the repair of all the instruments in use, as well as for the manufacture of many of the simpler instruments, and implements required for survey purposes, and which can be made better in this country. It also forms a depot for the safe custody of aU the instruments sent out from England on indent, from which all the supplies are drawn by executives under due control by heads of Departments. It is likewise largely made use of by the Public Works Depart ment, and other branches of the public service, both military and civil.

Statement Explanatory of the Nature of, and the Reasons for, the Expeniture incurred on Account of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, prepared for submission to the East India Finance Committee of the House of Commons, in compliance with Resolution No. 3494, dated Simla, the 17th October 1872, of the Government of India in the Financial Department, by Colonel J. T. Walker, R.E., F.R.S., &c, Superintendent of the Survey. THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS. (1.) The primary object \u2014 the raison d'etre \u2014 of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, is to furnish a basis for all Geographical and Topographical operations within the limits of the empire of British India, by means of which errors generated in the course of the several local surveys may be practically eliminated, and lines of latitude and longitude may be drawn on the maps showing the exact positions on the face of the earth of all places indicated thereon. The Great Triangulation was commenced in the year 1 800, when it appears to have been ascertained that the Maps of the Madras Presidency, which had been constructed during the course of the preceding century, were exceedingly erroneous; they had been based to a considerable extent on Astronomical Observations taken to fix the positions of some of the most important places in the Presidency, for it was not until the end of the last century that a Trigonometrical Survey was generally allowed to be the only accurate basis for the mapping of a country. Proposals for a Geographical Survey of Southern India, on such a basis, emanated from Major Lambton \u2014 of H. M.'s 33rd Regiment of Foot \u2014 in the year 1800, and being warmly supported by the Hon. Colonel Wellesley, afterwards the great Duke of Wellington, were sanctioned by Lord Clive, the then Govenor of Madras. The circumstance that at that time a large accession of territory in the centre of the Peninsula had been recently acquired by the successes of the British troops in the Mysore campaign, which opened a free communication with the western coast, doubtless contributed to the readiness with which the Madras Government assented to the proposals for constructing a trigonometrical basis for the geography of the Peninsula, which would also serve the purpose of connecting the surveys of the newly acquired provinces with those of other portions of the Presidency already"], [75, "67 APPENDIX. completed or in progress. By the year 1817 the triangulation had covered the provinces under the Madras Government, and reached the southern limits of provinces which were politically connected with the Bengal and Bombay Governments. Consequently the Marquis of Hastings \u2014 who was then Governor General \u2014 directed that the operations should be taken under the direct and immediate control of the Supreme Government, and that what had hitherto been known as the \" Geographical Survey of the Southern Peninsula \" should become \" the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India.\" (2.) In the course of the progress of the Survey it soon became obvious to Major Lambton that the operations \" would involve many more objects than what immediately appertain to geography.\" He saw that before the latitudes and longitudes of the trigonometrical stations could be computed it would be necessary to determine the figure of the earth and the lengths of the polar and the equatorial axes, or in other words that geodetic investigations must proceed pari passu with the trigonometrical and linear measurements, in order that the latter might be correctly utilized. Such has been the experience of all great national surveys, and consequently great efforts have been made, in every instance, to carry on the operations with sufficient attention to accuracy and precision to permit of their satisfying the requirements of delicate geodetic investigations as well as furnishing a basis for geographical purposes. The additional operations, which are required for purely geodetic purposes, are astronomical observations of the latitudes of a few of the principal trigono metrical stations, combined astronomical and telegraphic determinations of the differences of longitude, and pendulum observations. Extensive trigonometri cal operations necessarily geodetic also. (3.) The Geographical Surveys of India have been and still are, for the most part, executed by special departments, topographical and fiscal; e.g., the Topographical Survey of India and the Revenue Surveys of the Bengal and Madras Presidencies, all of which work on the basis of the G. T. Survey. But a large amount of geographical work has been done by this Survey also ; in the first twenty years of its existence Major Lambton completed maps of a cnnsiderable portion of the Madras Presidency ; in the next twenty-five years little or nothing was done beyond the triangulation ; but in the last twenty seven years the Trigonometrical Survey has undertaken and nearly completed the topographical delineation of the whole of the Himalayan mountains, up to the furthest points to which Europeans can penetrate ; it has also carried out, by a special native agency, geographical explorations of extensive Trans- Himalayan regions which Europeans cannot safely enter, and these are still being urged forward and are progressing satisfactorily. And now that the time is fast arriving when the Great Triangulation will be completed, the members of this Survey are being gradually transferred to topographical operations, as occasion offers. To distinguish the latter operations from the corresponding performances of the Topographical Survey Department, they will be here designated \" Trigo topographical.\" The geogra phical opera tions of the G. T. Survey. (4.) To the above must be added the Levelling operations which are under taken in order to connect together and reduce to a common datum all the levels which have been taken all over India ; in the course of the several surveys for canals, railways, and other purposes. It has always been a part of the operations of this survey to determine the heights of its principal stations, of the summits of mountains \u2014 more particularly the peaks of the Himalayas\u2014 and of all places of importance in the vicinity of the triangulation, by the well-known method of vertical angles. Owing, however, to the errors to which such determinations Reduction of all levels taken in India to a common datum."], [76, "68 APPENDIX. Reduction of observations and publication of results. are hable in consequence of the uncertainties in determining the amount of terrestrial refraction, the results were not considered sufficiently accurate to serve the purpose of connecting systems of levels together. Consequently in the year 1856 this Survey commenced executing certain main lines of levels for correcting its trigonometrical determinations of height, and connecting together the lines of levels which had been executed by other departments, and furnishing permanent bench-marks, or points of reference, to which all future systems of levels may be referred and thus reduced to a common datum. The economical advantages of this measure should be very great, in that, with comparatively little extra expense, all the numerous systems of levels, which have been executed for various special objects, may be rendered available for general purposes. Already a great quantity of valuable work has been rescued from comparative oblivion \u2014 from manuscript records accessible to only a few persons \u2014 and reduced to the G. T. S. datum and published for general information. (5.) The preceding observations will, I trust, serve to give an explanation, sufficient for the present purpose, of what may be called the field, or out of door, operations of this Survey ; but it will be obvious that a very large amount of work is also necessary for combining the results of the field operations, and preparing them for publication and general utilization. First. The exact lengths of the base-lines, on which the triangulation depends for its initial and verificatory linear elements, must be determined with great accuracy ; for this purpose an exact knowledge of the thermal expansions of the standards of length and of their relations to European standards is necessary, and this requires numerous very delicate and laborious investigations. Secondly. In all triangulations every fact of observation, whether linear or angular, should be so combined together as to give to each fact its proper weight, neither more nor less ; there may not be any arbitrary adjustment of discrepancies. Error must arise in the course of the very best and most accurate operations, for the agents employed are but men and the instruments used are manufactured by mortal hands; and these errors, though individually small and inappreciable, are liable to accumulate and eventually become disagreeably large. To ascertain how to disperse them in a legitimate manner for a survey of such vast extent as this, was long, for us, a great and direful problem in the distance, now I am happy to say it is a problem satisfactorily solved, and applied to a large portion of the triangulation ; the labour has been very great, but it has been well rewarded. This work is necessarily one which could only be undertaken within the last few years as the field operations approached com- pletion ; pending the final reduction of the operations it was the practice to supply \" Preliminary Charts \" containing full numerical data of the latitudes, longitudes, azimuths, heights and distances of the survey stations, in manuscript, to topographical and fiscal surveyors and all other persons requiring them, in order to satisfy immediate wants. Thirdly. The pubhcation of the results. Of late years the growing require- ments of the public service has necessitated the formation of photoo-raphic, zincographic, and type printing offices at the head quarters of the Survey to to satisfy the demands for data; these work with the computing office and under the immediate direction of its superintendent, Mr. Hennessey. Here the preliminary charts are now photozincographed and published for general use, instead of being merely prepared in manuscript as formerly; and the maps of the tngo-topographical surveys, and of Major Montgomerie's trans-Himalayan explorations, the charts of levels, and all other maps by officers of this Survey are also photozincographed for publication ; and the numerous computation-"], [77, "69 APPENDIX. The accounts of the official year 1870-71 taken as an illustration of the cost of the operations. forms which are required for departmental use are zincographed. Here too the annual administration (general) reports of the Department are printed, and the tables of heights which are compiled from the levelling operations, and last, though not least, the final \" accounts of the operations \" of the Survey, the first volume of which was published in 1870, while materials for several sub sequent volumes have been printed and will be published as soon as possible. IL\u2014 THE COST OF THE OPERATIONS. (6.) The Government of India being desirous that the statements under preparation for submission to the East India Finance Committee of the House of Commons should be explanatory of the accounts submitted to Parliament, the figures corresponding with those prepared in the Financial Department of the Government ; and further that, as it is impossible, in the short time allowed, to furnish more than a general outline, the statements should be prepared with reference to publications which treat more fully of the subject, from which useful additional information may be obtained, I proceed to show the cost of the operations during the official year 1870-71, the last year for which accounts of actual expenditure have been published by the Government ; full details of the nature of the corresponding operations are given in Major Mont gomerie's \" general report \" for that year, when he was officiating as my locum tenens ; to this document are appended extracts from the narrative reports of the executive officers in change of the several operations, and a memorandum, by Major Montgomerie, on the Trans-Himalayan explorations. (7.) The actual cost of the federations in 1870-71 is represented by the following figures in the Civil Budget estimate of the Government of India for 1872-73.

(9.) An explanation of the reasons why the expenditure on account of operations of such a different nature as the topographical operations in Kumaon and Gurhwal and the Trans-Himalayan Explorations is lumped together in the accounts of this department is necessary. The amount actually expended in the payment of the explorers was Rs. 5,542 ; it varies materially from year to year within the sanctioned maximum of Rs. 8600, and depends on the amount of work done and the rewards paid for good work. But these sums by no means indicate the total outlay on the operations ; the journals and field books of the explorers have to be translated into English and very carefully analyzed and corrected before they can be published, and the observations have to be examined and reduced ; this work happens to have been done for the most part by the staff of the Kumaon and Gurhwal Survey and has occupied a large amount of the time of the persons employed on it ; the actual expense may be roughly estimated as at least Rs. 15,000, and consequently the cost of the purely topographical operations may be taken as so much less than the total amount of both which is given on the preceding page. III.\u2014 THE AMOUNT OF WORK EXECUTED. (10.) In para. 1 of Major Montgomerie's report the out-turn of work is stated to be as follows : \" Principal Triangulation with great theodolites, 59 \" triangles, covering an area of 11,203 square miles with a total direct length \" of 403 miles, and observations for 3 azimuths of verification ; secondary tri *\u25a0' angulation with smaller theodolites, an area of 10,076 square miles on which \" the positions of 1676 points were fixed and the heights of 467 were deter \" mined ; trigo-topographical surveying, on the one inch to the mile scale 301 \" square miles, on the two inches to the mile 2,291 square miles, and on the \" six inches to the mile 60,027 acres ; boundary lines and check lines, 780 \" miles ; main lines of double levelling, 380 miles, by means of which the heights \" of 166 points of reference were finally determined; astronomical latitude ob \" servations, 1,353, by which the latitudes of 15 points were determined ; \" geographical exploration, the reduction of 289 miles of Route- Survey by \" which the geography of an area of about 13,000 square miles of terra incognita \" has been unravelled.\" At page 25 of the report a tabular abstract gives the out-turn work by the several survey parties in greater detail. At pages 56 to 60 of the Appendix to the report corresponding details are given for the photozincographic printing and drawing offices. These may be epitomized as follows : \u2014 Maps and Charts of levels and triangulation newly drawn for publication .... 30 (This is exclusive of 42 maps drawn by the topogra- phical survey parties and sent in to the Head Quarters' Office ready for publication) Photozincographs ; 68 sheets of maps 6,465 copies printed in all. \u201e 16 sheets of numerical charts 839 \u201e \u201e various plates and diagrams, 13,205 \u201e Zincographs ; forms for computation, &c. 10,402 \u201e Type printing ; 819 pages composed; 234,828 \u201e"], [80, "APPENDIX. 72 IV -ESTIMATES OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COST AND THE OUT-TURN OF WORK. (11) The cost of a survey is invariably assessed on the area surveyed. There is probably no better way of showing the relations between the outlay and the out-turn; but the way is most unsatisfactory; it does not give an accurate idea of the intrinsic value of the work done, nor any indication whether the expenditure has been thrifty or wasteful. It is analogous to estimates of the cost of railroads at so much per mile ; there are some railroads which would be cheap at half a million sterling the mile, others which would be dear at a hundredth part of that amount. All such estimates are worthless without a full knowledge of the nature of the operations in each instance, the exact amount of work done, and the difficulties met with and overcome. All that can be said of them is that they are better than no estimates at all, and on this understanding I proceed to give such estimates as may be legitimately drawn from the above figures. (12.) Estimated Cost of the Triangulation. Outlay as above - Rg- 2,09,519 Area embraced ; Principal Triangulation - 11,203 square miles. Secondary \u201e - 7,019 \u201e \u201e Total 18,222 Rate, 11 J rupees, or 23s. per square mile. The operations of the year are singularly illustrative of the dangers atten ding estimates of this nature, and the illusions to which they may give rise. On the Brahmaputra Series no triangulation was done ; the surveyors were wholly employed in preparatory work ; they were selecting sites for and building new stations, and clearing the lines between them, the country being a dead level plain, covered with trees and in parts with dense jungle ; the theoretical cost of the triangulation is therefore infinity. The Bider longitu dinal Series was being carried through a very malarious and deadly district ; the officer in charge died of fever ; much delay occurred, and that in the middle of the field season, in filling his place ; the series was advanced a distance of 37 miles only, and the area embraced by the triangulation (principal and secondary) was 1,097 square miles, giving a rate of about Rs. 35 per square mile. The Belaspur Series traverses one of the wildest parts of India, covered with dense forest and having much lat ground ; the advance was 52 miles, and the area triangulated over was 1,190 square miles, giving a rate of Rs. 33 per square mile. On the other hand, the northern section of the Bangalore Series passes over a delightful country for triangulation, with hills high enough to give commanding views but not too high to ascend easily, and with very little nesessity for line clearing. The advance was no less than 161 miles ; the area triangulated over was as much as 6,849 square miles, giving a rate of little more than Rs. 4 per square mile. Though facts are very highly creditable to the executive officer, Lieutenant Rogers, yet in really difficult ground his progress would have been far slower. (13.) Estimated Cost of the Topography. First, the surveys of Kattywar and Guzerat which, being on the same scale, may be noticed together. The operations consist in first constructing a net-"], [81, "73 APPENDIX. work of minor triangulation, emanating from the Great Triangulation, as a basis on which the details of the ground are afterwards drawn by the method of plane tabling, as in the topographical surveys which are immediately under the directions of the Surveyor-General, but with this addition, that a large number of boundaries are traversed with theodolites and chains for fiscal pur poses, and the further difference that the scale of the field survey is ordinarily twice as large, i.e., 2 inches, instead of 1 inch to the mile. The areas finally surveyed and mapped amounted to 1,757 square miles in Kattywar, and to 534 in Guzerat, or in all 2,291, on the 2-inch scale ; in addition to which 301 square miles of wild and unhealthy hills in the Gir of Kattywar were surveyed on the inch scale ; assuming the latter as equivalent in cost to half the area on the larger scale, the out-turn of work may be treated as covering an area of 2,442 square miles on the 2-inch scale, and the outlay being Rs. 1,26,037, the rate of cost is Rs. 52 per square mile. Secondly. The Survey in Kumaon Gurhwal. This is usually conducted on the scale of one inch to the mile, but during the year under review the survey party was diverted, under orders received from the Government of India, from its ordinary operations to make a survey of the Kosi Valley, on the scale of 6 inches to the mile, \" to facilitate the investigation into the practicability of the construction of a railway \" up the valley to the new hill station of Ranikhet. This work was necessarily done in far more detad than the ordinary topographical surveys in India ; several contour lines were laid down and the levels of a large number of points were determined, for future reference by the radway engineers. The area completed and mapped was 60,027 acres, say 94 square miles ; and taking the outlay as Rs. 75,000, for the reasons already o-iyen in para. (9), the rate of cost is a trifle under Rs. 800 per square mile. Estimated Cost of the Levelling Operations. (14.) These are executed with the utmost possible care and precision ; the lines are twice leveUed, independently, by two persons, and the results are com pared station by station ; corrections for dislevelment are applied as in astrono mical observations. 308 linear miles of line were levelled over, and the outlay was Rs. 21,752 ; thus the rate of cost is about Rs. 70 per linear mile. (15.) These are all the estimates that can well be given. Similar estimates are not possible in the case of the geodetic operations ; nor would it be of any use for me to endeavour to investigate the cost of the mapping, the photozinco graphy, and the type printing in this way. But what I have already done will I trust suffice for the requirements of the Parliamentary committee. I need only add that further details of the cost the operations of this Survey may be found in a report, dated 20th October 1850, by Colonel A. S. Waugh, Surveyor General of India and Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, which is printed in the return to an order of the Honourable the House of Commons, dated 12th February 185ft.

Indian Marine Surveys, 1871. Since the publication of the \"Abstract for 1872-73 \" surveys of portions of the coasts of British India have been actually com menced, and these may be considered as the first fruits of the newly-organized Department of Marine Surveys, which, under the able direction of Commander Taylor, will provide for the long neglected wants of the mercantile fleets frequenting Indian ports. Previous, however, to the commencement of operations in India, Commander Taylor visited England for the purpose of conferring with the Hydrographer at the Admiralty, more particularly respecting the selection of suitable officers of the Royal Navy as surveyors. Every assistance was readily given by Captain Evans, and on his recommendation the Lords Commissioners of the Admi ralty nominated six surveyors from the Royal Navy for service on the Indian coasts. There were, however, still important duties connected with the preparation of charts and the projection thereon of the land surveys unprovided for, and these required qualifications and training of a special order. To discharge these duties Mr. R. C. Carrington of the Hydrographic Office, who had been highly recommended by Admiral Richards, was appointed, his post being that of Chief Civil Assistant to the Superintendent of Marine Surveys at Calcutta. The Admiralty placed at the disposal of Captain Taylor all those original charts and records in their custody which were the property of the Indian Government, and that officer selected those which he considered requisite to take back to India. These originals, together with a goodly number of others that were found at Bombay doomed to destruction because frayed, insect eaten, and dust-stained, but fortunately rescued just in time, are now safely deposited in presses at Calcutta, and a catalogue of them has been printed. The catalogue of all the original and other documents dejiosited in the Marine Survey Office, Calcutta, has been compiled by Mr. Carringlon. It comprises lists of the general and physical charts of India, and the coasts to the west, as well as of each section of the coasts of India from Karachi to Tenasserim, and of the Anda- a 1"], [94, "2 NECESSARY SURVEYS. man Islands, Ceylon, the Eastern Archipelago, and China. Captain Taylor has also prepared a useful review of all the Admiralty charts of British Indian coasts, showing in what respects they are incom plete and untrustworthy, and what surveys are required to render them adequate guides for navigation. He cheerfully admits, how ever, that the Admiralty charts are the best obtainable, and suggests that some of the wrecks and accidents are due to the fact that most merchant ships obtain for their use inferior copies of the Admiralty charts not corrected up to date. Captain Taylor has also made notes of the survey operations necessary between the Pakchan river and Karachi. Pending the extension of the Great Trigonometrical Survey throughout the length of the territory of British Burmah, Captain Taylor does not recommend any minute maritime survey of the coasts, but supplementary soundings chiefly at the entrances of ports, where steamers now call or wish to call for commercial objects. The requisite surveys in the order of their importance are those of the Cuttack coast from Point Palmyras to the south-west for a distance of 270 miles, the Great Megna Elats or shoal water off: the mouths of the Brahmaputra and Ganges (the latter river being one of those which bring down alluvial deposits that render periodical examination an absolute necessity), the Coeos, Andamans, and Nicobar Islands, the entrance of the Sittang River, the Gulf of Cambay, the Chittagong Coast from Eermy River to the Nauf River, the coast of the Burmah from Nauf River to the Pakchan, with further examination of the Mergui Archipelago as far south ward as the Seyer Islands, or perhaps to Junk Seylon. Coringa or Coconada Bay requires re-examination, owing to the silt brought down by the Godavari, which has had the effect of throwing the anchorage some two miles further northward. Euture littoral changes may be expected at the mouths of all large Indian-rivers, the Indus, Narbada, Tapti, Krishna, Godavari, Mahanadi, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Aracan, Irawadi, and the Salwen, and also at the bars of minor rivers, notably Mangalor, Cochin, Negapatam, Nar sapur, Chittagong, Bassem, Rangoon, and Tavoy. Though the working season had almost passed away before the surveyors had all reached India, yet a small amount of work has been done. Mr. Chapman in the \" Constance \" has made a survey of Kolachel port in Travancore ; he has added to the soundings in Palk Bay and the vicinity of Paumben Pass, and has com menced a fresh examination of Cocanada port and the shoals off"], [95, "NEW SURVEYS. WRECKS, &C. 3 Coringa. Mr. Chapman in continuation of his survey of the Bahrein reefs1 has also surveyed the N.E. and S.E. approaches to El Katif and Deman, but not the regular approaches to Bahrein by which the British India Steam Navigation Company enter the place. Being beyond the limits of British India, this work will for the future fall to the province of the Admiralty. Capt. Taylor expected to have started the \" Guide \" to examine the mouths of the Ganges, but was only able to send her on 8th April to the vicinity of Diamond Harbour on the river Hugli, more with the object of testing the steam cutters and the fittings of the vessel. But her commander, Lieut. Coghlan, R.N., in little over a month, has made a beautiful sectional survey of the Hugli reach, with the Rupnarain river for two miles up, and the famous James and Mary Shoals. If all the river from Chandernagore to the Sand Heads were similarly sectionally sounded, the charts would be a worthy legacy to hand down to posterity. The first chart compiled under the orders of the new Marine Survey Department has been received in England, and has been put into the engraver's hands. It is a chart of the West Coast of India from Sunmiyani Bay, north of Karachi, to Pigeon Island, in latitude 11\u00b0 south. It has been compiled by Mr. Carrington from the surveys of Ethersey, Grieve, Selby, Constable, Taylor, Ward, Whish, Stiffe, and Wilhams, 1835 to 1862. It is on the scale of three inches to a degree of longitude, and the price will be two rupees. Captain Taylor proposes to issue three more charts uniform with the above, to embrace the whole of British India. The number of wrecks and casualties reported in Her Majesty's Indian possessions, including Ceylon, during the year 1874, amounted to 40 and 29 respectively. The total number of lives lost was 85, and the total tonnage of vessels wrecked was 16,656. The officiating deputy Master Attendant remarks, that the majority of the vessels totally wrecked were native-built native vessels, and that hundreds of these vessels are annually constructed in British India without survey, or any competent authority to class or inspect them during the course of their construction. They are as a rule built of the cheapest and commonest materials, and barely nailed together. The native owners are exceedingly parsimonious, and pick up scraps of gear and fittings anywhere. The same officer is of opinion that steps should be taken to compel the owners to have them built under certain express conditions and fitted out properly. i See Abstract for 1871-2, p. 1."], [96, "4 II. Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, 1873-4. During the year 1873-4, the operations of this department produced the following results : 70 principal triangles, covering an area of 7,190 square miles, were measured, and of secondary triangulation an area of 5,212 square miles has been closely covered with points for topographical operations, an area of 3,650 square miles has been operated in pari passu with the principal triangulation but exterior thereto, and in the ranges of mountains north of the Assam Valley a large number of peaks have been fixed. In the Himalayas 534 square miles have been topographically surveyed on the scale of one inch to the mile, 2,366 square miles in Kattyawar on the two-inch scale, and in Guzerat and in the Dehra Dun a total area of 753 square miles has been completed. Besides all this, much important geographical exploration has been done in Kashgaria and the Pamir Steppes and in Nepal and in Great Thibet and Nepal by native explorers. The party under Major Branfill completed the revision of the southern portion of the Great Arc, about five-sixths of which had been already revised at the commencement of the present year, the last operations having terminated in 1871. The remaining gap was about 108 miles in length, and by its revision the last of the old links in all the chains of triangles, which might have been objected to as weak and faulty, have now been made strong and put on a par with the best modern triangulation. Search was made for one of Colonel Lambton's old stations, in a group of red sand hills, and eventually it was discovered that this must have moved 1,060 yards to the E.S.E., being in the direction of the * prevailing winds in tbe locality, and at the rate of 17 yards per annum. This affords a very accurate measurement of tbe rate of progress of this remarkable sand- wave, which all efforts to arrest have hitherto proved unsuccessful. Mr. Bond, one of the Assistant Surveyors, had the good fortune to catch a couple of the wild folk who inhabit the hill jungles of the Western Ghats, and occasionally come to the villages with honey, wax, and sandalwood, to exchange for cloth, rice, tobacco, and betelnut. On examination they each proved to be 4 feet Qz} inches high, and, generally speaking, of a low type. After completing the triangulation, Major Branfill proceeded to recon noitre the Straits of Manaar, with a view to connect, if possible,"], [97, "5 CONNEXION WITH CEYLON TRIANGULATION. the triangulations of India and Ceylon. The straits are narrowest at Adam's Bridge, but the islets composing the bridge proved to be mere sand -hillocks, often submerged by the sea, and quite unsuitable for stations. Northward, however, between Ramisweram and Jaffna, there are several islands composed of coral and sandstone ; and on one of these, Kachi-tivu, halfway between Ramisweram and Neduven-tivu, two stations about a mile apart will be built, and from this base will be determined the positions of the two next stations on Neduven-tivu, which will be erected by the Ceylon Government. As the angles at the Kachi-tivu stations will necessarily be very acute, they will be measured by the superior instruments of the Indian Survey, the more symmetrical triangles beyond being measured by the Ceylon officers under Colonel Eyers, R.E., who is taking great interest in the operations, and doing all in his power to help. Major Branfill proceeded after this reconnaissance to lay a longitudinal chain of triangles on the parallel of 9\u00b0 15', which will run eastwards from the Great Arc to the coast, and thence to Neduven-tivu, and from which a chain of triangles must eventually be carried up the Coromandel coast to Madras. On taking in hand the reduction of the observations and the calculations of the usual preliminary results, the difference between the measured value of the base line at Cape Comorin and the computed value brought down by the triangulation from Calcutta, via Madras and Bangalore, was barely appreciable, being 2-23 millionths of the length measured. No serious errors have been met with in the values of the sections of the Great Arc between the parallels of 8\u00b0 9' and 18\u00b0 3', which were deduced from Colonel Lambton' s observations at the beginning of the century. The difficulties in the way of progress up the Assam Valley were explained in the abstract for last year.1 This year the triangula tion was advanced for 47 miles, to within a few miles of Sibsagar Station, greater rapidity of progress having been secured by building tripod stands for the theodolite and separate platforms for the observers, instead of the usual elaborate central masonry pillars. Various points were fixed in the Duffla Hills to the north and in the Naga Hills to the south-east ; and connections have also been made with the stations of the Revenue Survey in the valley. The party sustained a loss in the death of Mr. G. A. Harris from fever, he being a very painstaking and worthy member of the Department. i Abstract for 1872-3, p. 10."], [98, "6 BRAHMAPUTRA, JODHPUR, AND BURMA SERIES. Captain Carter had a gap of only 54 miles in the triangulation of the Brahmaputra series (meridian of 90\u00b0) to complete, but it was a work of some difficulty to accomplish this, as all triangulation had to be done before the usual jungle fires in March. Moreover the series lay almost wholly in alluvial plains, necessitating the construction of lofty towers and elaborate clearances between. Endeavours were made to establish a connection with the Revenue Survey, but as the plan of erecting tri-j unction pillars has only recently been adopted in Bengal, the positions of the temples and banyan trees, under which the villagers hold their markets, had to be fixed instead. The Jodhpur meridional series1 was advanced a considerable distance northwards through the Desert of Marwar and Jesalmer, a region much dreaded on account of its desolate appearance, the frequency of its famines, and tbe distress and disease generally prevalent among the poorest classes of inhabitants, owing to the miserable food and unwholesome water on which they are com pelled to subsist. The desert is covered with sand hills of a pretty uniform altitude, so that the advantages of a hilly country are lost, and short sides to the triangles are unavoidable. The principal triangulation was carried for 90 miles along the meridian, by a series of figures embracing an area of 1,552 square miles; Secondary chains of triangles have been extended from the main series, and sites for stations selected for 102 miles ahead of the principal triangulation. Between the Indus and Gurhagarh series, eastward of it, there will be only two principal series, the Jodhpur and another, on the meridian of 70\u00b0, the plan of having the main meridional series about a degree apart having been found to involve too great an amount of principal triangulation, the deficiency being made good by an increase of secondary triangulation. The Eastern Frontier Series in British Burma had been stopped in 1870 owing to the financial embarrassments of the Government ; the expenses being vastly greater in Burma than in any part of India proper. This is to be ascribed chiefly to the thinness of the population and the density of the forests, which, covering the whole face of the country up to the top of the hills, necessitate extensive clearances and the cutting of long lines. This year the Govern ment directed the triangulation in Burma to be resumed and pushed forward with vigour, so that points might be fixed for the operations of the Revenue Surveyors in that province. Mr. 1 Abstract for 1872-3, p. 11."], [99, "7 LEVELLING IN MADRAS. KATTYWAR AND GUZERAT SURVEYS. Rossenrode was selected for the duty, and he arrived at Rangoon on the 7th November. The great object in British Burma is to keep the stations as much as possible on the hills, and so avoid the necessity of bringing the triangulation into plains crowded with luxuriant vegetation and dense forests. Eor two months Mr. Rossenrode was impeded by the smoke of the jungle fires and unable to observe, and when the monsoon finally dispelled the haze, the whole country was submerged, the depth varying from one to four feet. The out-turn of work comprised a double polygon, covering 1,294 square miles, and in the preliminary operations stations have been selected for a secondary chain to connect Rangoon and Pegu. Captain Herschel's departure to Europe necessitated the breaking up of the party which had been employed on astronomical and geodetic operations in the Madras Presidency. But the levelling, the object of which is to connect and reduce to a common datum the several lines and systems of levels executed for railways, canals, and other public works, these being very numerous in the Madras Presidency, and to check trigonometrical determinations of heights, was entrusted to Lieutenant Harman. He carried a line, 304 miles in length, from Guti, through Bellary, to Karwar, where tidal observations will probably be made soon. Turning to the topographical operations,1 the completion of the survey of Kattywar within the next five years may be confidently looked to. The area completed in the season of 1873-4 by Lieu tenant Pullan, whose party was weakened by the death of two assistants and the loss of a third, who became a lunatic, comprised about 2,201 square miles, which were surveyed on the scale of two inches to the mile by plane-tabling on a trigonometrical basis, with the addition of a large amount of traversing, in order to lay down the taluka boundaries, and for purposes of check. A survey of Ptajkot, on the. scale of 12 inches to the mile was also made, and a good deal of triangulation in advance for next year's operations. The efforts to combine the work of the Revenue Surveyors in Guzerat with the scientific topographical survey were described in the Abstract for 1872-3,2 and it now appears that, thanks to the unceasing efforts of the Trigonometrical Survey officers concerned, the valuable measurements laid down in the village maps can be successfully incorporated in the maps of the professional surveyors. i Abstract for 1872-3, p. 12. 2 Abstract for 1872-3, p. 13."], [100, "8 FOREST SURVEYS. This end had been steadily kept in view by Colonel Walker, who was desirous of utilizing the measurements of the revenue surveyors. inasmuch as plane-tabling, which is the method usually employed by his officers, is unsuited for a rich champaign country like Guzerat, and a recourse to minute chaining was therefore unavoid able. The Bombay Government co-operated usefully by sending a small but sufficient party of native surveyors to furnish details of the fiscal measurements, and indicating the positions of the principal pillars and marks for reference. By cutting up the village maps into triangles, with sides under three-quarters of a mile, all the boundaries given by them can be satisfactorily embodied on the professional maps. The scale finally adopted is that of four inches to the mile for the Khalsa villages, where the owner of each field pays his rent directly to the British Government, and each field has been surveyed fiscally ; lands on the talukddri and indmi tenure, villages belonging to the native states, and the Dang forests being surveyed on the two-inch scale, as in Kattywar. A satisfactory amount of triangulation was accomplished, the topographical operations embracing a rather smaller area than in former years, when the scale was but half as great; but Major Haig expects that his party will soon be able to turn out nearly as much work annually on the four-inch scale as could be done in those parts where the Revenue Surveyors have not been at work, on the two-inch scale. The maps completed show the wall, fences, and other divisions between the fields, the \" numbers \" by which the fields are registered and generally recognized, and all other fiscal details, besides topo graphical information. They will thus prove most useful for local and general administrative purposes to engineers employed in laying out lines of roads, canals, and railroads, and more par ticularly for local irrigation works, for which it is a matter of great importance to have a map showing the fields which are brought under irrigation, and the owners of which have to be taxed in proportion to the benefits they receive. The importance of forest surveys has been recognized in India, and Captain Bailey, the new superintendent, was temporarily affiliated to Colonel Walker's department, to enable his establish ment to be properly trained and organised. The Dehra Dun district was selected as the field of operations, and it was first intended that a re-survey of the whole should be made by Captain Bailey, as the increase of cultivation and formation of extensive tea plantations since Major Brown's survey in 1840 had been ereat."], [101, "PENDULUM OBSERVATIONS. 9 But as the calls on Captain Bailey from all quarters became too numerous to enable him to finish his work, a portion of Captain Thuillier's assistants from the Kumaun and Garhwal Survey were drafted off to work on the non-forest tracts of the Dehra Dun ; and a good out-turn of work was completed by them. The scale adopted was the same as that which, after some discussion, had been fixed upon for the pari passu survey of the forest tracts, i.e., four inches to the mile. This is the same scale as is used for the surveys in the British districts in the Bengal Presidency plains, and it was therefore deemed advisable to make use of a large proportion of native agency, as is there used, in order to train them for the new survey of the districts of Jaunsar, Bawar, Kangra, Kulu, and Spiti, which had been sanctioned by the Government and Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India.1 The districts of Kangra, Lahaol, and Spiti, and the native states of Chamba, Tiri. and Garhwal, had been surveyed in 1849-54 on the scale of -^-inch to the mile,. but the object had been the delineation of the general geographical rather than the topographical features, so that a re-survey on a larger scale had now become necessary, and the larger amount of comparatively mechanical work offered a good opportunity for an extended use of native agency. The remaining members of Captain Thuillier's party (Kumaun and Garhwal Survey),2 under Mr. Ryall, executed a fair amount of triangulation (460 miles) and topography (534 miles) during April, May, and June, among the upper valleys of the Ramganga, Sarju, Gori, and Ralam rivers. In the Abstract for 1872-3, an account was given of the pen- dulum observations3 which had been carried on in India since 1865, and which last year were brought to a conclusion at Kew by Captain W J. Heaviside, R.E. The results of the operations, as far as they relate to the observations made with the invariable pendulums of the Royal Society, have been since calculated, and they offer incontestible evidence in confirmation of the hypothesis of a diminution of density in the strata of the earth's crust which are under continents and mountains, and an increase of density in the strata under the bed of the ocean ; and it is clear that elevations above the mean sea level are accompanied by an attenuation of the matter of the crust and depressions by a consolidation. i Since disallowed, owing to financial reductions. 2 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 14. 3 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 16."], [102, "10 TIDAL OBSERVATIONS. The reductions of the swings with the Russian pendulums and Captain Kater's convertible pendulum are not yet sufficiently advanced to enable any conclusions to be drawn regarding the results. Tidal Observations. In the \" Abstract \" for last year,1 the preliminary arrangements were described, which had been made by Lieutenant (now Captain) Baird, for instituting tidal observations at three points on the coast and in the Rann of Kach, and a description of the masonry wells and their method of connection with the sea was also given. At the beginning of the field season of 1873-4, some experimental observations were made at Bombay ; and here fortunately the discovery was made that there was a decided tendency for air to collect in the connecting pipes. This having been remedied by affixing stop-cocks to the pipes, a start was made for Okha Station \u2022 all the instruments and stores, European assistants and native establishment, having been embarked on board a pattimar or native sailing vessel. On the 5th November the landing of the stores and sinking of a masonry well \u2014 for the sandy soil had rendered this necessary \u2014 were commenced, and by the 23rd December every thing was in full working order. The very next day, however, a large native boat drifted from her anchorage towards the station, broke the flexible piping in two places, and carried away the buoys and anchor. This led to various arrangements for protecting the piping and intercepting drifting vessels being made. At short distances round each station three bench marks, which had been carefully connected with the zero of the tide gauge, were sunk in the ground for future reference. Next year a series of levels will be carried so as to connect the tidal stations and determine their differences of level. It is very desirable, in order to obtain data for ascertaining the separate influence of each of the chief tidal con stituents, that a series of observations should be taken for a year at least. During this time, periodical inspection would be absolutely necessary, and arrangements to that effect have accordingly been made. This inspection entails exposure and privation. In May the Rann of Kach was from six inches to a foot in depth, and Captain Baird and Mr. Rendell travelled on camel back. Later on during the monsoon, communication by boat became impossible, as 1 p. 54."], [103, "TOPOGRAPHICAL SURVEYS. 11 the native vessels could not venture out in such strong gales as then set in, so a long detour round the gulf became necessary ; while the common unmetalled roads in the black soil of Kattywar becoming all but impassable during the rains, often prevented Captain Baird from making more than a mile an hour. The working of the gauges at Okha Station has been satisfactory. At Hanstal there have been short breaks in the continuity of the observations, owing mostly to the unavoidable deposit of fine mud in the piping and well. Nawanar, however, proved to be quite unsuitable for continuous tidal observations, as under the influence of the strong S.W. monsoon, the drift from a belt of sand hills to the south had formed an extensive sand spit on the line of piping, and the extreme end was thits buried in sand, where a few weeks before there had been a depth of 20 feet of water at low tide. The preliminary results of the observations up to the end of September have been worked out by Captain Baird, and the extreme range is greatest at Hanstal, where it is 21*2 feet, or from two to four feet more than is given in the Marine Charts. Very fairly approximate values of the progress of the tidal wave up and down the gulf have also been obtained. Observations of barometric pressure, of the velocity and direction of the wind, and on the amount of rainfall have also been taken in order to separate local atmospheric influences from the true tidal constituents, which are caused by the varying positions of the sun and moon, and so materially increase the scientific value of the tidal observations. Colonel Walker speaks highly of Captain Baird's labours, and of the trying nature of his duties, especially while inspecting the stations during the monsoon. III. Topographical Survey of India and Work of the Surveyor General's Office, 1873-4. During the year under review there were seven topographical parties employed in the field, and the out-turn of work amounted to 24,103 square miles of final topography, chiefly on the one-inch scale, and 19,623 square miles of triangulation in advance, results which are pretty nearly the same as those obtained last season. The general results are pronounced by the Surveyor General to be most satisfactory, a very full and large area having been returned by each party. B"], [104, "12 TOPOGRAPHICAL surveys. The Gwalior and Central India Survey,1 under Captain Strahan, was engaged during 1873-4 in portions of the native states in the vicinity of Jhalra Patan, east of Neemuch, between the parallels of 24\u00b0 and 25\u00b0. A good description of the cities of Pertabgarh and Deola by Mr. Scanlan, 1st assistant surveyor of the party, will be found in the appendix to Colonel Thuillier's report. They are noted for the manufacture of a peculiar kind of jewellery which appears to be fashionable at present among Indian ladies, and consists of all sorts of shapes of green glass on which grotesque figures and hunting scenes are delineated, among which the lion is of such frequent occurrence as to suggest the idea that it was at one time much commoner than now. The secret of the manufacture of this jewellery is so jealously kept that the men will not permit their daughters to enter the workrooms, lest on marriage they should divulge its mysteries. Mr. Scanlan also furnishes an account of the curious troglodyte caves of Dhamnar, which were seen by Tod in 1821, and described by him in his Rajasthan. In the course of the survey some of the party met with some of the notorious Bhil tribes, but though a difference arose it was fortunately adjusted satisfactorily. The final topography executed covers an area of 2,783 square miles, and the triangulation 4,080 square miles. No. 2 party,2 under Mr. E. B. Girdlestone, was engaged along the great range of the Vyndhias, in the Nerbudda Valley, in portions of Nimar and Malwa, Barwani, Dhar, and Dewas. The area covered by the topographical operations amounted to 2,285 square miles, and by the triangulation, 1,000 square miles. The fall of the river Nerbudda between Mortakka and Kheri (73'5 miles apart) was taken and proved to be 147 feet, being at the rate of 2 feet per mile. Mr. Girdlestone visited the ruins of Mando, which are girt by walls 30 miles in circumference, and situated on a plateau, surrounded nearly on all sides by precipitous hills, the Vyndhias forming a precipitous wall of 1,254 feet to the south. The enor mous mass of mixed palaces, temples, and tanks, and of the towns and villages around, attest its former importance, it having been for three and a half centuries the residence of kings and vast armies. Now it is inhabited by only a few wretched Bhils, and the ruins are rapidly decaying. The Vyndhia Bhils are cultivators, own then* own cattle, and are far better off both in physique and condition of life than then brethren in the Satpuras who go by the 1 and 2 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 19."], [105, "13 CENTRAL PROVINCES AND REWAH SURVEYS. same name. They are a contented and humorous race when sober, and take readily to Europeans, but when drunk (which they frequently are) are easily provoked and troublesome to deal with. Mr. Girdlestone furnishes a detailed description of Mahesar Eort in Nimar (Holkar's dominions). There are 30 pieces of ordnance within the fort, and at the time that the survey was going on there was a garrison of 215 men. Colonel Thuillier speaks in very high terms of Mr. Girdlestone' s energy and devotion to his duties in spite of the difficulties and unhealthiness of the country. The Central Provinces and Vizagapatam Agency Survey1 opera tions, under Lieutenant Holdich, cover an area of 1,428 square miles of final topography among the broken rugged hills which continue the mountain system of the Eastern Ghats, and extending across the Godavery River with a general south-westernly trend, finally merge into the high plateau of the Hyderabad country. The country is as a rule a densely forest-clad district, which, com bined with the remarkable unhealthiness of the region, the difficulty of obtaining guides and supplies, the paucity of villages, and the annoyance experienced from tigers, greatly hindered the progress of the surveyors. The triangulation was extended over 1,800 square miles in the southern zemindaries of Bustar, a tolerably low, jungle-covered country infested by tigers. The villages are few and far between, the inhabitants being mainly Kois, an aboriginal tribe of the Dravidian or Gond family. Owing to the increasing difficulties of the country remaining for survey, about 9,000 square miles, the unprofitable nature and unhealthiness of the country. Lieutenant Colonel Depree's party,1 No. 4, was at work in the Rewah state, and the Mandla, Balaghat, and Bilaspur districts of the Central Provinces. The out-turn amounted to an area of 1,600 square miles of triangulation, and of 2,419 square miles of final topography, in addition to 3,812 acres of forest reserves in the Mandla district, which were surveyed on the large scale of four inches to the mile. A junction was effected by means of triangula tion with the revenue survey tri-junction masonry platforms in Bilaspur and Raipur, while valuable aids to future settlement surveys were afforded by the marking on the maps of all the tri-junction points in the Mandla district. The nature of the country was unfavourable for transit, all the hill ranges being elevated plateaux covered with heavy forest, and the entire surface 1 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 20. B 2"], [106, "14 MALWA AND N.E. FRONTIER SURVEYS. of the ground of a stony character. It is anticipated that the remaining topography will not occupy more than a season or two, and the Central Provinces will then have been entirely surveyed. A very good season's work was turned out by the Bhopal and Malwa Native States Survey1 under Captain Riddell, amounting to 2,812 square miles of final topography round Sehore and Bhopal, and in some of the smaller native states in the Rajputana and Central India agencies, and 2,833 square miles of triangulation, in addition to the triangulation for a plan of Sehore, the head quarters of the Bhopal agency. Of the city of Bhopal, Captain Riddell remarks that it is over-crowded, the population amounting to at least 44,000, but that (unlike any other Indian city of his knowledge) excellent water is obtainable by simply turning a tap, the supply being derived from a reservoir, which in its turn is fed by steam from the lake 150 feet below. During the season 1874-5 this party was to have been under the charge of Captain Wilmer. The arrangements made for the exploration and completion of the surveys along the north-eastern frontier and in the Manipur state were described last year. This year three detachments of No. 6 party were formed with the objects, lstly, of continuing the exploration in the Eastern Naga Hills, south of the Sibsagar and Lakhimpur districts ; 2ndly, the completion of the central portion of the Naga Hills or Samaguting district, and 3rdly, the filling up the blank or western portion of the Manipur Native State between the meridians of 93\u00b0 15' and 94\u00b0. All these objects were attained with the exception of a small strip in the Naga Hills 25 miles long, the total out-turn being 9,201 square miles of topography, over a most difficult tract of hilly and inhospitable country, and 3,100 square miles of triangulation. A considerable portion of the country visited and mapped was totally unknown, except by name, to the oldest and most experienced frontier officers ; and the Lanier River which has long been supposed to drain into the Brahmaputra, has been proved to join the Namtonai or Kyandwein River, which debouches into the Irawadi, almost due west of Ava. The whole party had many great privations to undergo from bad and insufficient food, fever, and exposure in low pestiferous valleys and the snow-covered Eastern Naga Hills, while occasional acts of hostility on the part of the natives were sustained. During the season 1874-5 the party was to have been employed 1 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 20."], [107, "RAJPUTANA SURVEY. NEW MAPS. 15 in three detachments ; two under Captain Badgley and Lieutenant Woodthorpe in the Eastern Naga Hills, and the third under Major Godwin- Austen, with the military expedition against the Dufflas. The Rajputana and Simla Survey party (No. 7),1 under Captain G. Strahan, extended its triangulation through portions of Ajmere, Jodhpur, and Jeypur, covering an area of 5,210 square miles, and 3,170 miles of final topography in Mhairwarra and parts of Udeypur and Jodhpur, besides completing large scale plans of Erinpura and Beawar. The country triangulated consists mainly of plain studded with sandhills, throughout which supplies, especially grass and water, were procured with much difficulty. A curious method of telegraphy by means of mirror flashes proved to be practised across the desert from Ajmere to Bikanir. It is used by the opium merchants, who thus make known the rate at which opium is selling in Calcutta. Mr. W. M'Nair, assistant- surveyor, furnishes a description of Ranpur Temple in the Aravalli range, a pile of buildings of imposing aspect, of sandstone, occupying a space about 250 feet square. It is devoted to the Jain religion, and pilgrims assemble thither from Guzerat, Bombay, Bhopal, and the North-West Provinces during the months of March and September, when a fair is held. While in recess quarters Captain Strahan's party took up the Simla and Jutog large scale survey (24 inches to a mile), and besides completing a good out-turn of traversing, trigonometrical determination of heights, field sketching and drawing, a most artistic plan of Simla and Jutog was rendered by him on the scale of eight inches to the mile. A large portion of the season's fair mapping, which embraces altogether an area of 21,383 square miles, has been reduced to the quarter-inch to the mile scale for the Indian Atlas. A compilation of a map of Assam, scale eight miles to the inch, uniform with that of Bengal, has been started ; maps of Bhutan, Darjiling, Chind- wara, Hazara, and Garo Hills, and various other miscellaneous maps completed, and the engraving of maps of Sind and of India have been proceeded with. The latter will be very useful, a good general map of India being a desideratum. Seven quarter plates of the Indian Atlas have been published during the year under review, three of them being complete up to margin. As regards the photographic department, no less than 27,800 1 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 20. 2 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 21. B3"], [108, "16 REVENUE SURVEYS. copies of outline maps of districts and divisions in Western and Northern Bengal were printed to meet the demands of the local administration for the purpose of aiding the famine relief opera tions. The increase of work in printing copies in this branch during the year was nearly 32 per cent, above that of 1873. The photo-collotype process for the reproduction of maps has un fortunately failed owing to climatic influences, and though it may eventually succeed with care, it will probably never suit for the printing of large maps. An excellent series of copies of casts in the caves of Cuttack has been nevertheless produced by it to illustrate Baboo Rajendralal Mitra's work on the Antiquities of Orissa. In the lithographic branch 214,153 complete copies of maps, plans, &c. were printed during the year, and a good portion of these were coloured by the process of chromo or color printing. The per-centage of out-turn of the three different descriptions of printing presses is as follows : \u2014 Photozincographic 40 per cent., lithographic 57 per cent., and copper plate 3 per cent. During the year the total issue of maps to all public departments on service and to agents for sale amounted to 38,022 copies, of the value of 51,531 rupees (5,153?.) IV. Revenue Surveys of India, 1873-4. During the season 1873-4 there were fifteen survey parties at work, eight in the Punjab and North-West Provinces, and seven in the Central Provinces, Bombay, Bengal, and Assam. The total number of square miles surveyed and mapped amounted to 19,901, or 3,389 square miles more than in the preceding season, while 9,422 square miles of country were also either triangulated or surveyed in boundary in advance for the field season of 1874-5. Colonel H. C. Johnstone's party were engaged in the Dehra Ghazi Khan and Dehra Ismail Khan districts, the operations beino* confined to lowlands of the Indus' bed, stretching up to a little beyond the high bank on each side. The boundary survey of 374 villages was completed, as well as the interior survey of an area of 1,291 square miles. A comparison of the areas with those obtained by the Settlement Department cannot as yet be instituted, but the total areas of villages are said to agree well. On the other hand the thakbusts or boundary maps of the river lowlands are badly made, according to Colonel Johnstone, and the mud boundary"], [109, "CADASTRAL SURVEYS. 17 pillars are continually being moved by the villagers or washed away by the movements of the river. Brick boundary pillars have now been erected along the high banks on both sides of the Indus. Levelling operations were undertaken in consultation with the Irrigation Department, and 476 linear lines of levelling were got through. During the season 1874-5 the completion of the survey of the River Indus and the lowland villages, as far north as Kalabagh, where the river emerges from the Salt Range, was to have been taken in hand. The second party, under Captain Wilkins, completed 674 square miles of interior survey in the Delhi district, and 1,647 square miles of boundary survey in the Gurgaon district. All the marks of the Great Trigonometrical Survey that could be properly identified were incorporated. The fort of Tuglakabad and ground round the celebrated Kutub Minar were surveyed on the large scale of 16 inches to the mile. As regards the comparison of the settlement with the professional work, Captain Wilkins reports that the total areas of villages as determined by both surveys do not agree so well as they ought to, while the details have not been worked out far enough to admit of comparison. In the Bhawulpur State two parties were engaged (the third, under Captain Andrew, and the 15th, under Mr. J. Campbell,) in the cultivated portions bordering on the Indus and Sutlej, and in the desert tracts to the south. The area of out-turn in the case of the first-mentioned party was 4,014 square miles, and of the second 3,051 square miles. The results are considered very good, as the difficulties of locomotion in the desert tracts, where the chain men often sunk up to their knees at each step, were very great; Throughout this tract the sand ridges uniformly extend north-east and south-west, being more precipitous on the south-east face than the other. The vegetation is very scanty, and the aspect of the country is simply that of an \"ocean of sand. The four cadastral surveys in the North-West Provinces were again engaged in Muradabad, Muttra, Agra, and Humirpivr. The total number of fields surveyed was 1,501,398, and these averaged apiece 1' 16 of an acre in size, or rather larger than the average of the previous season. The work was carefully connected with the points of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, where such could be identified, and the agreement between the two classes of measure ments was very close. Much delay in publication in the case of the Muttra party's work was avoided by the Settlement Department testing the classification in the field, after the usual test had been b 4"], [110, "18 BOMBAY SURVEYS. applied by the European officers of the survey. Colonel Anderson reports that numerous and urgent demands for copies of the 16-inch survey sheets are made by the canal and railway departments, and civil officers, and that Mr. Prince, superintending engineer of the Light Provincial Railway, through being supplied with tracings of the Muttra survey, has been enabled to dispense with a special preliminary survey to enable him to determine the best point for the proposed railway across the Jumna and through Muttra. Mr. Prince also reports that he has found them wonderfully correct. The Agra party were to have taken up the 16-inch survey of the city, cantonment, civil station, and environs of Agra during the season 1874-5. In the Lower Circle the eighth party, under Lieutenant Colonel Oakes, was employed in the Betul district and Aheri Zemindari of the Central Provinces, and an area of 1,466 square miles was covered by their operations, though an unusually hot and dry season occasioned much sickness to the party. Mr. Lane's party in the Bilaspur district and Aheri Zemindari rendered a total out-turn of 2,039 square miles, which was carefully tested by European agency. The Settlement Department had gone over the same ground five or six years previously, and the com parison of areas is satisfactory, the difference over the whole of four main circuits being 4| per cent. The whole of the Aheri Zemin dari, with the exception of a few patches of cultivation, is covered with high jungle, has a dense undergrowth of high grass and weeds, and abounds with wild animals, such as tigers, panthers, leopards, bears, wild hogs, and buffaloes, bisons, neelgyes, samburs or Indian elks, several species of deer, and others. There are three Government forest blocks of teak of a superior quality near Aheri, and the timber is carted to Nagpur or floated down to the Praneta River. A good deal of excellent teak is also found to the south east, near the River Indraoti, and is being worked by some Marwari merchants, who float it down the Indraoti and the Godavari rivers. In the Bombay Presidency two parties were engaged in the Nasik, Ahmadnagar, and Poona collectorates. The object of this, as was explained in last year's Abstract,1 was to render the Bombay revenue survey available for the construction of accurate maps for the general purposes of administration. A total area of 1,741 square miles was topographically surveyed by Captain Coddington, --p. 23."], [111, "ASSAM AND NAGA HILLS SURVEY. 19 while the triangulation covered 3,000 and the traverse work 1,524 square miles. A connection was established with the Khanpisura series of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The cost of the work has been much reduced since last year, being Rs. 37 5. 8. per square mile, as against Rs. 55. 6. 11. for the previous season. The party under Major Tanner completed an area of 1,440 square miles of topography, and of nearly 3,500 of triangulation in the Poona and Ahmadnagar collectorates, the cost being Rs. 38. 15. 1. per mile. Major Tanner reports that the Bombay village plans when reduced to the scale of two inches to the mile fit in accurately with the Topographical Survey, and that as the plane-tabling is done from the tri-junction points of villages (which are always to be found on the local plans), the amalgamation of the surveys is attended with no extra labour in the field. The 12th, Midnapur district, party completed an area of 941 square miles, and of the 180 miles forming the remainder of the tract the village boundaries have been surveyed. Major Sconce, the chief of the party, is described as one who takes great pains to improve his subordinates, and as a most valuable officer. In the Goalpara and Darrang districts of Assam a total area of 1,425 square miles were topographically surveyed on the scales of two and four inches to the mile respectively. In the Lakhimpur district an area of 1,287 square miles was topographically surveyed by the 14th party, under Captain Samuells. It was found necessary to measure a base line and proceed on triangulated data, as the operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey had not yet been extended so far. The party was exposed to much sickness and hardship. Mr. Ewing was wrecked while floating down the Dihing, and all the property of his party was lost ; and Mr. Swyny, through remaining too long at his post while suffering from fever, fell a victim to his devotion, and died May 26th. A valuable and interesting descriptive report of this important and little known frontier region is given by Captain Samuells, and it has therefore been thought desirable to reproduce the substance of his more important observations. The portion of the Naga Hills surveyed by the 14th, or Lakhim pur party, consists of a succession of ranges running parallel to the watershed, and varying from 25 to 30 miles in width. The water shed, or Patkoi Range, which divides the valleys of the Brahmaputra and Irawadi, has a general direction north-east and south-west, and an average height of about 6,000 feet on the south-west of the"], [112, "20 THE NAGA HILLS. work, which decreases gradually, till at the source of the Dihing River it is not more than 2,000 feet high. After this the range increases in height and joins the high hills and snowy peaks inclosing the east end of the Assam Valley. The hills are covered with dense forest except here and there near the villages, where small patches have been cleared for cultivation. On the lower ranges the India rubber tree {ficus elastica) is common, and forms a source of revenue to the Nagas, who wander about the jungles in the cold season tapping the trees and collecting the rubber. A great impulse was given to the rubber trade a few years ago by some of the European planters engaging in it. The price rose from Rs. 10 to Rs. 40 per maund, and the consequence was that the trees were tapped to such an extent that they were nearly all killed. The Nagas were not content with tapping the trunk and branches but exposed the roots and notched them also, and in some instances, when they were too lazy to climb the tree, they deliberately cut it down to save themselves trouble. The tea plant is very plentiful in certain localities of these hills, and a kind of brick tea is made therefrom by compressing the green leaves into hollow bamboos, where it ferments slightly, but it is neither dried nor roasted before use. Limes of various sorts are common throughout the jungle, and in some of the villages there are magnificent orange trees with a remarkably fine sort of fruit. On the higher ranges the cassia tree (latirus cassia) is very common. It is a species of cinnamon, but the bark is thicker than that of the true cinnamon, and its colour deeper. Salt springs were met with throughout the tract surveyed, while coal is found all along the foot of the hills, and generally seen cropping out on the banks of the streams which flow into the Dihing at the point where they leave the hills. It is of excellent quality, and has been worked at several places, but the want of local labour and the dearness of provisions prevented the working being remunerative. Petroleum has been bored for in one or two places. There are a great\" many types and clans of Nagas inhabiting the country surveyed. As a general rule, those inhabiting the ranges nearer the plains are all more or less demoralised from excessive indulgence in opium and strong drinks. There are constant blood feuds between the tribes, and their peculiarities and distinctions are intensified by the absence of means of communications from one village to another. A capital detailed account of their manners and customs is given by Captain Samuells. He remarks, with regard to trade routes between Assam and China, that, though Europeans have been turned back"], [113, "GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. 21 while endeavouring to cross into Tibet from the side of Dibrugurh, no physical difficulty exists in the way of communication across the Patkoi into Hukong and Upper Burma. In 1823 the Burmese army invaded Assam by a route east of the country surveyed, where there are no high ranges to be crossed, and returned the same way in 1825, carrying away many women and children, and much booty, and that even thus encumbered our light infantry were unable to overtake them and rescue the captives. Numbers of Singphos and Burmese cross backwards and forwards every year, and several parties of traders were met with who had come over to sell gongs, dhaos, and amber earrings. The reason assigned for the trade not being greater was that the traders chiefly wanted guns, gunpowder, and opium ; and as the sale of these was prohibited by the British Government they preferred selling their goods in Burma, where these articles were procurable. Captain Samuells gives in an appendix a useful hist of routes between Assam and Upper Burma. V. The Geological Survey of India, 1874. The regidar work of this survey again suffered somewhat from the enforced absence of some of its members. During nearly the whole of the year, Mr. H. B. Medlicott officiated as Superintendent during Dr. Oldham's absence on sick leave. Mr. W. T. Blanford was also absent for some time, being engaged in working out and passing through the press his notes on the natural history and geology of Persia: He returned about the middle of December, and proceeded to Surat to advise the authorities on the best way of obtaining a good water supply ; after which he took up the general examination of Sind. Another member of the staff, whose services the Survey was deprived of for the year, unfortunately fell a victim to his over exertion in the cause of science. Dr. E. Stoliczka, who accompanied the Kashgar mission in the capacity of naturalist and geologist, was returning to India with a rich harvest of notes and collections, when he succumbed to the extreme cold and fatigue encountered in the extreme altitudes of the Pamir Steppe and Karakorum passes, which had under mined a constitution not naturally strong. Dr. Oldham remarks of him : \u2014 \" Gifted by nature with peculiar powers of observation and com parison, trained in an accurate and careful school of geology and pal\u00e6ontology, he brought to his labours unbounded zeal, acute intelligence, and large and carefully acquired knowledge, all of"], [114, "22 TRANS- INDUS SALT DEPOSITS. which tended to render him one of the most useful and trusted of our colleagues. But in addition to this, his genial temperament, his sound judgment, and his liearty appreciation of work of any kind in others, together with his clear views of justice, and the unflinching expression of those views, made him also one of our most esteemed and beloved friends and advisers. His loss to the Geological Survey will be long and keenly felt.\" The Pal\u00e6ontologia Indica, which forms a noble monument of Dr. Stoliczka's research and powers, will be continued by his trusted fellow labourer, Dr. Waagen. Mr. Medlicott's time was pretty fully taken up with the current work, but at the urgent request of the Government of Bengal he visited the Garo Hills, whither it is now possible to proceed with safety, and discovered a strong seam of fair coal in one of several detached basins of newer secondary rocks in the heart of the hills, north of the main ridge. Mr. Theobald, in a rapid examination of the area between the Ganges and Ravi, arrived at the conclusion that the great mass of the Siwalikh range on the east of the Jumna is composed of rocks belonging not to the Siwalikh group, but to the older and distinct Nahan group, and that on the further side of the Sutlej the Siwalikh rocks are bounded by the Una Dun. A large number of fossils of these areas have been received from Mr. Theobald, but want of space in the Geological Museum at Calcutta prevents their being opened out. Mr. Wynne commenced the examination of the Trans-Indus salt region early in the season, being accompanied by Dr. Warth, who was to form a sound practical estimate of the commercial value of these extensive salt deposits. Mr. Wynne's researches proved that the Trans-Indus salt region (excluding the Kalabagh salt) com prises about 1,000 square miles of country between the British frontier and the River Indus, and Kohat and Banan to the north and south. It is very difficult to arrive at any fixed notion concerning the thickness of the beds, but nowhere can it be said that the bottom of the salt is seen, and it is known to exceed 1,230 feet in thickness in some places. The salt is of a white or grey colour, and the greater portion of it is remarkably pure, though less saline in taste than the Cis-Indus salt. The quarries were first worked in 1650. There are two methods of quarrying applied, by gunpowder and by detaching the salt in slabs or tubbis from the rock by means of pickaxe and wedge, care being taken to make them of a uniform size. Owing to the remarkable difference in"], [115, "23 GODAVARI SANDSTONES. colour between the Trans-Indus and Cis-Indus salt, it has been found expedient heavily to tax the latter, and impose a heavy fine upon all persons in whose possession the former was found to the east of the Indus. The area of consumption is very extensive, the radius exceeding 200 miles in length. Report even says that the Kohat salt is carried as far as Kandahar and Balkh, but this is uncertain. It is said that Government sacrifices a great deal by giving the Trans-Indus salt at so low a rate, but this point requires further research. By careful and detailed investigation Mr. Wynne arrived at a conclusion of some interest, confirming previous ideas, that the rock salt dates from the old tertiary periods, no rock older than the salt having been noticed, and the salt itself appearing to be inter calated with the lower beds or almost the base of the nummulitic rocks. Mr. Wynne has since visited the country lying between the salt range and Kashmir boundary to the north. Reference was made in last year's Abstract1 to the interesting investigations in which Mr. King was engaged, in endeavouring to fix the corelation of the Godavari sandstones with established formations. He has established three zones in the Rajmehal series, two characterized by marine fauna, and a lower one by well marked Rajmehal plants, this last being closely superimposed upon beds containing specimens of the Kampti Damuda flora. The explora tion of the Beddadanole coal field was continued under Mr. King's superintendence, and some bands of poor coal and coaly shale were proved. The main coal may, however, turn out to be in the upper parts of the measure, which has not yet been examined. Mr. Vanstavern has put down some borings at Jugiapettah, along side of those formerly made by Colonel Applegath, and where he believed he had found coal, but though the borings were carried down to the sub-crystalline rocks, not a trace of coal was discovered. Mr. King was actively engaged in January 1875 in an examination of the gold bearing reefs of Wynad. Mr. Eoote was first engaged in completing a survey of the quartzite region of the Southern Mahratta region, after which he proceeded to report on the small gold-bearing tract in the Dambal bills of Dharwar. The smallness of the area and the scarcity of the metal seems, however, to offer but little inducement for any large outlay. Mr. Eoote then took up the region between the hill i p. 30."], [116, "24 GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS. ranges and the sea north of Madras, with a view of completing the sheets 76, 77, and 95. Mr. Hughes' researches have been more of a directly economic kind, in connection with the manufacture of iron. At the close of the year he had re-examined the iron deposits of Kumaon. His opinion thereon (which confirms in the main various researches of the Geological Survey) is that there is abundance of ore and flux and fuel for operations on a limited scale. He then made a revised examination of parts of the Raniganj field, and his report thereon appeared in the \" Records.\" His regular work did not commence till January, when, with Mr. Eedden's aid, he remapped the northern portion of the Warora coal field. On his recommendation borings were put down in the neighbourhood of Bander, and beds many feet in thickness were proved. This discovery is the more im portant as the locality of coal is the nearest yet known to that of the valuable iron ores of the country. Towards the close of the year Mr. Hughes was engaged in rendering general advice to two companies who propose to undertake the smelting of iron. Mr. Eedden, as stated above, was occupied, in company with Mr. Hughes, in the Wardha valley field. At a place north of Warora he discovered some fossil fishes in the uppermost beds of the sedimentary rocks, and this will help to elucidate the age of the beds. Some progress had been made by Mr. Ball in the borings of the Dudhi valley, when he was suddenly called away to Calcutta with a view to his visiting the Mergui Archipelago. This trip was subsequently abandoned, but he was unable thus to complete a large out-turn of work, although he had time to visit the wild district of the Luni Pathans west of Upper Sind, where some traces of lignite had been seen. A full account of his trip has appeared in the \" Records \" for 1874, p. 145. The experimental borings for coal in the region of the Narbada were continued, but did not lead to any discovery, though at Sukakheri a depth of 491 feet was attained. Borings have been commenced in the Tawa Valley, with the object of saving 20 miles of rough carting from the Shahpur or Betul coal field. Mr. Willson continued his mapping of the northern portion of she Bundelkund Survey. One of the chief points of interest is the prevalence of quartz reefs or veins of a great size and in large number. Two systems of trap dykes were also hit upon, both being apparently younger than the great quartz reefs. Mr. Hacket resumed his labours in Rajputana, a region of which"], [117, "25 TRAINING OF NATIVE GEOLOGISTS. the greater portion forms a blank at present in the geological map of India. Mr. Mallet finished his examination of the coal deposits in British Sikkim and the Western Duars, where he considers there is some prospect of the Damuda coal being made serviceable by the adoption of some contrivance for the utilization of such powdery coal. His observations have led him to believe that the Damuda forma tion is here the lowest member of the rock series of the outer Himalaya ranges, the Darjiling gneiss being the topmost and youngest. This, if confirmed, is a result of importance, and will tend to establish a well marked common horizon between the rocks of the Himalaya and those of the Peninsula of India. In accordance with the scheme for training natives as geologists,1 mentioned in last year's \"Abstract,\" there have been during the past year four apprentices attached to the Survey, and paid out of the Survey Budget. One of the four has now been attached to the Survey for nearly two years. Mr. Ball reports that he is attentive and willing to learn, but that his progress is very small and very unpromising. The other three, though receiving pay as apprentices, have been doing nothing in connection with the Geological Museum or Survey, but have been attending courses of lectures and instruc tions at the Presidency College. They are thus being paid for learning what apparently they ought to be able to prove their acquaintance with before then* appointment. Dr. Oldham expresses regret in his report that his Department has been hitherto unable to complete a general sketch map of the geology of India. This has been principally owing to the frequent calls made upon his officers for various extraordinary purposes (often not strictly geological), as well as to sickness and absence. Examinations of numerous isolated areas have been made; but without some knowledge of the intervening spaces, it is imprac ticable to correlate the rocks in one part with those elsewhere. Dr. Oldham has accordingly' for some years devoted much attention to preparing separate descriptions and maps of certain divisions of the country. Besides papers relating to districts and collectorates, sketches of the geology of the Central Provinces, of Orissa, of the Bombay Presidency, and of the North-Western Provinces have been already published, while one of the Punjab is ready for press, and one of Bengal will be soon taken up. During the year, Part 2, Vol. X. of the Memoirs was published, containing an account of the geology of Pegu by Mr. Theobald, and i p. 32."], [118, "26 ARCH\u00c6OLOGICAL SURVEYS. part of Vol. XL, containing a report by Mr. Mallet on the geology of Darjiling and the Western Duars. The Records were issued quarterly as usual, and contained 23 papers on various points in the geology of India. Eour are valuable summaries of the geological results obtained by the late Dr. Stoliczka during the mission to Kashgar, and one a note on the Altuni Artush by the same hand. Of practical papers there are notes on the iron ores of Kumaon ; on the raw materials for iron smelting ; on petroleum in Assam ; on the subsidiary materials used for artificial f uel ; on the building and ornamental stones of India ; on potash salts ; on manganese ore ; while descriptive notices are given of parts of northern Hazaribagh, the neighbourhood of Murree, of Kangra, of the Garo Hills, of the Luni Pathan country west of Sind, and of the Southern Godavari country. Of the Pal\u00e6ontologia Indica the concluding parts of the cretaceous fauna of Southern India were published before Dr. Sto liczka's departure for Kashgar in 1873. The illness of Dr. Waagen, his successor, has prevented full progress being made, but two parts of the Kachh Cephalopoda have been completed. The later part contains an illustrated description of a very interesting form of rhinoceros (r. deccanensis) found by Mr. R. B. Eoote in fluviatile deposits in Belgaum. Large additions of books and publications have been made to the library ; and some valuable collections of fossils from the Sivalikh range, the Rawal Pindi and Jhilam districts, the Milam pass to the north of Kumaon, and other localities, have been forwarded to the Museum by officers of the Survey. VI. The Arch\u00e6ological Surveys of India, 1872-3-4. General Cunningham, has published his fifth report,1 containing the results of an arch\u00e6ological tour made by him through the Punjab during the cold season of 1872-73. Yusufzai, where he seems to have broken ground, is known to be rich in ancient remains, and it is very desirable that, before these lessen and deteriorate, efforts should be made to secure them ; but unfortunately the bigotry of the people will suffer Europeans to visit only the southern half or British district of Yusufzai (corre sponding to the ancient Penkolaitis). Dr. Bellew estimates the inhabitants as numbering 132 to the square mile ; but in former i Arch\u00e6logical Survey of India. Report for the year 1872-3. By Alex. Cunning ham, C.S.I. Vol. V.

' 8"], [119, "RUINS IN YUSUFZAI. 27 times, judging from the numerous mounds of ruined cities and villages, the population must have been much denser, the water supply more plentiful, and the forests more abundant than now. Of the latter we have a proof in the fact that the Emperor Baber and his soldiers hunted the rhinoceros there ; and as regards water, Yuzufzai offers many advantages for securing an artificial supply, \u2014 a fact which was not lost sight of by the keen-sighted and thrifty Buddhist population that held the country for so many centimes before the conquest of Mahmud of Ghazni brought in the rapacious Musalmans. The population of the Yusufzai plain was probably about 300,000 at the time of the Muhammadan invasion, being more than double the present numbers, while the fertility of the lands from irrigation was referred to by the Chinese pilgrim Sung- Yung in A.D. 519. An examination of the numerous mounds in the Yusufzai plain brought to light coins, sculptures, pieces of pottery, beads, and bones of men and animals. The coins prove that many of the mounds are the ruins of villages, which were occupied from a period preceding the invasion of Alexander, down to the time of Mahmud of Ghazni. The inscriptions found are in the Aryan character, and appear to show that most of the Buddhist monas teries and temples of Yusufzai date between B.C. 50 to A.D. 150. These buildings existed in the early centuries of the Christian era, but in the time of the last of the Chinese pilgrims, Brahmanism had made some progress, the king in particular being a determined Brahmanist, though the people were still attached to the old faith. However, Buddhism continued to decline, and though its monu ments still survive in numbers, the Brahmanical coins, which are exceedingly numerous, show the ascendancy of the latter religion to have been complete during the two centuries preceding the Christian era. Shahbaz-garhi, which was visited by General Cunningham, had been previously described by Dr. Bellew as built on the actual ruins of a stone-built town ; and this opinion is borne out by General Cunningham, who, after examining the mounds of ruins, arrived at the conclusion that the circuit of the old town had been about four miles, and that, including the suburbs, its population must have numbered not less than 20,000 inhabitants. The people said it was once the capital of the country; \u2014 a theory strengthened by the fact of its having been selected as the site for the great rock inscription of Asoka. They also say it was called Sattami or Setram ; \u2014 names c"], [120, "LEGENDS OP PRINCE SUDATTA. 28 which General Cunningham believes to be corruptions of the name of the famous Buddhist prince Sudana or Sudatta. It is mentioned by the Emperor Baber under the name of Makam. Several mounds in the vicinity of the place were examined by General Cunningham, but the two most interesting points in his researches are the discovery of the cave in the Karamar hill to the north-east, and the obtaining a faithful copy of the great rock inscription of Asoka. The cave has no special name, and contained only one room, according to the natives; whereas the cave of Sudatta, with which General Cunningham sought to identity it, contained two. But after a minute search he spied a small dark hole at one end, which, on being enlarged, proved to lead into a second chamber and establish the identity of the cave with that of Prince Sudatta. The identity was clinched by the discovery of a great block of stone 12 feet square, just in front of the cave, where Sung Yun says there was a great square stone on which it was said the prince was accustomed to sit. According to the Buddhist legend, Prince Wessantara, named Sudana and Sudatta, or the \"illustrious giver,\" in the narratives of the Chinese pilgrims, was noted for his excessive liberality, which led him even to give away any of his possessions he might be asked for. At last he provoked the indignation of his people for giving away the richly-prized white elephant of Siwi to the Rajah of Kalinga, and was banished, The religious history begins at this point, and every spot connected with his after career possessed a monument commemorating the event. Sung Yun and Hwen- Thsang called the city of Sudatta Fo-lu-sha and Fo-sha-fu respec tively ; and the position assigned to it by the latter limits it to the neighbomhood of Shahbaz-garhi, with which General Cunningham is convinced that Fo-lu-sha or Fo-sha may be identified. He also inclines to the notion that it corresponds with the Bazaria of Arrian and Quintus Curtius. A monastery, which stood on the spot where Sudana' s son and daughter were sold by the Brahman to whom they had been given in charity to serve as slaves, is most probably represented by some ruined mounds outside the east gate of the old city ; and the temple of the white elephant palace, which, according to Sung Yun, \" contained stone images highly adorned and very beautiful, very many in number, and covered with gold sufficient to dazzle the eyes,\" is now to be found in a long low mound by the road to Karamar. At 50 li or upwards of eight miles N.E. of the city, Hwen-Thsang places a high mountain, on"], [121, "ROCK INSCRIPTION OF ASOKA. 29 which there was a statue in blue stone of the goddess Bhima. This is most probably the Karamar peak, 3,480 feet high. The great inscription of Asoka is engraved in Arian characters on a large shapeless mass of trap rock, 24 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet thick, the greater portion of the inscription being on the eastern face, but some being found on the western. After several attempts, a careful copy was successfully taken by tracing the letters out with ink, all doubtful portions having been examined in different lights. As no photographs can be taken, on account of the slope of the hill, this transcript is the most accurate copy that could be made. General Cunningham proposes hereafter to collate it with the Khalsi and other versions of Asoka's edicts. The present inscription establishes a fact of importance with regard to the rise of the Andhras, which it places back to B.C. 263, or cotem poraneous with Asoka, instead of B.C. 21, the date hitherto accepted. The ruins of Takht-i-bahi, so called from two small tanks or reservoirs (bhai) on the hill which had been previously examined at some length by Dr. Bellew, were next explored by General Cun ningham. They are situated on the crest and northern slope of a projecting spur about 28 miles north-east of Peshawar, and com mand an extensive view of the surrounding country. The religious buildings are the most important, and consist of a stupa surrounded on three sides by chapels, an open court with lofty chapels for colossal statues, a monastery with cells, and minor edifices. The chapels were many of them dedicated to the memory of holy men or of powerful kings, whose statues were enshrined in them, in addition to a single figure of Buddha which each chapel most probably contained. The chapels, as well as the principal statues, would appear to have been gilded, as even now in Burma. Some, however, of the plaster statues have been simply coloured red. As the walls of some of these chapels are .still from 25 to 30 feet in height, it is probable that the statues must have been nearly as lofty;\u2014 a view borne out by fragments of colossal figures found by Dr. Bellew and Sergeant Wilcher. The large court in which these colossi were found is situated between the monastery and the stupa, and in its eastern portion contains some platforms which General Cunningham thinks formed at one time the basements of stupas. The monastery probably held about 33 persons. Outside of it on the west is a square unroofed quadrangle, with walls 30 feet high, which may very possibly have been used for the monthly meetings c 2"], [122, "30 RUINS OF SAHRI-BAHLOL AND JAMAL-GARHI. of the fraternity. The number of private houses still standing show that the place must once have been of some consequence. Two and a half miles to the south-south-east of Takht-i-bahi are the ruins of Sahri-Bahlol, an ancient city, with a population in former days of about 3,000 or 4,000. The immense accumulation of rubbish would seem to place the date of its occupation as far back as 2,000 B.C. The place was probably very marshy at one time ; and this, General Cunningham believes, may very possibly have been caused by the Cabul river having then flowed in a north easternly direction towards Sahri-Bahlol instead of its present E.S.E. direction. The most conspicuous ruin is a lofty mound or stupa, (in all probability built to commemorate the place where Buddha gave his eyes in charity), which had been examined by Dr. Bellew, and had proved to contain human and other bones ; while from the adjoining ruins had been obtained a quantity of miscellaneous relics, which are now in the Lahor Museum. General Cunning ham is inclined to attribute the date 500 or 600 A.D. to the tope, while Sahri-Bahlol itself he would identify with the city men tioned by Hwen-Thsang, where the Rishi Ekasringa had resided before the time of Asoka. A long low mound in the vicinity of Dr. Bellew's tope yielded 10 statues, figures of Buddha, varying in size from the colossal to half size, a head of a king, with moustache, long hair, and a tall head-dress, and other sculptures. Several pieces of pottery, with a curious black shiny glaze both inside and out, were also discovered. One discovery of interest consisted of a broken lingam 'of white marble, with a portion of a single face of Siva, this being the only sculptured evidence of the former existence of Brahmanism found by General Cunningham in the Yusufzai district. Numismatic evidence, however, is frequent, coins bearing the bull of Siva being constantly found. The few coins brought to General Cunningham comprised several early Indo-Scythian speci mens, showing that the place must have been in existence at the beginning of the Christian era. The Buddhist ruins at Jamal-Garhi occupy the top of the hill overlooking the village, and about 500 feet above the plain. The scidptures are more numerous and in better preservation than those in the other ruins ; and several statues and capitals show distinct traces of having been richly gilded. The ruins themselves include two principal and other smaller blocks ; the first consisting of a large stupa surrounded with a circle of chapels; and the second, which adjoins, of all the buildings of a complete Buddhist"], [123, "YUSUFAZI INSCRIPTIONS. 31 establishment, disposed in a series of courts or blocks of buildings. A notable feature in the sculpture of these chapels was the occur rence of several capitals of pilasters in the Indo-Corinthian style, with boldly designed volutes, and two tiers of acanthus leaves deeply and delicately chiselled. Some of them have small figures of Buddha, either sitting or standing amongst the acanthus leaves, and many still preserve traces of gilding. Some of the sculptures found in one of the courts were very good and interesting, includ ing many statues of kings, i.e., figures with mustachios, jewels round the neck and upper arm, and sandals on the feet. The religious establishment on the hill of Jamal-garhi was supplied with water by an artificial reservoir in which the rain was collected. According to the inhabitants it is quite full in the rains, and generally lasts for the greater part of the year. The ruins at Kharkai have not been examined yet, but some sculptures have been obtained from thence ; and some which General Cunningham, secured, three slabs, which, from the Aryan letters inscribed thereon, he considers were originally the three sides of a relic casket of Arya Deva, one of the most prominent disciples of Nagarjuna, and a well known leader of the Buddhist church, about the beginning of the Christian era. The ruins on the hill of Ranigat close to Nogram had been already described by Bellew, Lowenthal, and Cunningham, but, being just beyond the British frontier, have been as yet but super ficially examined. They are deserving of more complete study, the neatness and accuracy of the architecture alone being described as wonderful. General Cunningham devotes some pages to a detailed considera tion of various inscriptions brought at different times frOm Yusufzai. One of these, a simple record of the building of a stupa by some pious Buddhist, derives special interest from the mention therein of King Gondophares (A.D. 21-51) of the Saxon Legenda Aurea, who is recorded to have received St. Thomas at his court. According to this legend, St. Thomas was sold to Gondophares as a slave, and is said to have converted the king himself ; but to have left him afterwards and gone to the country of King Meodeus, by whom he was eventually put to death, as some say, at Calamina in India. Another account makes him out to have converted the king's sister-in-law, Migdonia, for which he was thrown into prison and afterwards put to death. Khairabad on the western bank of the Indus, opposite Attok, was formerly the great stronghold of Raja Hodi or Udi, which c 3"], [124, "32 IONIC COLUMNS. MANIKYALA TOPE. General Cunningham would identify with the great Indo-Scythian race of Yuti or Yuchi, who became masters of the Kabul valley towards the end of the second century B.C., and had extended their arms over the Punjab and North-west India before the besinnins: of the Christian era. General Cunningham also visited Shahderi, which he is now more than ever inclined to identify with the ancient Taxila, partly because of its position, and partly because of the great extent of the ruins as compared with any others between the Indus and the Hydaspes. Some of his excavations have brought to light some Buddhist Vihars adorned with Ionic columns of pure Greek design, the first examples of this order which have yet been found in India. The bases of the columns of one of these Vihars correspond exactly with the pure Attic base, which, as in the Erectheium at Athens, was very commonly used with the Ionic order. But the capitals and volutes differ, so that altogether this unique specimen of the Indian Ionic seems to be of a ruder and more primitive type than some of the pure Greek examples. The temple is to all appearances that described by Philostratus {see Vita Apollonii, II. 20), in which he saw tablets of brass, with repre sentations of the deeds of Alexander and Porus in various metals, which may possibly be identified with the sculptured alto-relievos of the Buddhists. Twelve coins of Azas were discovered by General Cunningham, proving that the date of the temple was as old as 80 B.C. Another Buddhist Vihar was excavated on the south bank of the Tabra Nala, and plans of a temple and of a great monastery and stupa at Sirkap were made; the latter, from its name Babar Khana (\"House of the Tiger \"), being apparently the famous monument erected by Asoka to commemorate the place where Buddha had made an offering of his head to appease the hunger of a starving tiger. The great Manikyala Tope had been visited by General Cunning ham in 1863, but since then the whole of the lower part had been excavated, and the ground around cleared, so that on his renewed visit he was enabled to make fresh measurements, and examine it carefully. It is built of huge rough blocks of sandstone, and is 127 feet in diameter ; the height of the dome is 92 feet, while that of the cylindrical base on which it rests is 15 feet. Eour broad flights of steps facing the cardinal points led to the top of the terrace, and the whole was most probably surrounded with a Buddhist raibng. The carving of capitals shows that the pilasters were of the Indo-Corinthian style, and broad masses of acanthus"], [125, "ANTIQUITIES OF SALT RANGE. 33 foliage are still plainly visible. General Cunningham's conclusions are that the tope was built originally in the time of Huvishka by his Satrap Karasiva, and after the lapse of several centuries repaired with Kankar facings and mouldings, about A.D. 720. Some excavation 1,000 yards to the south-east of the tope revealed two gigantic heads of Buddha in coarse sandstone, the statues of which must have been fully 20 feet high. In dealing with the antiquities of the Salt Range, General Cunningham gives a rapid sketch of the history of the table land between the Indus and the Jhilam, touching upon the, Kashmman ascendancy, in order to explain and account for the existence of a number of old Hindu temples in the Salt Range, all belonging to the Kashmman style of architecture, and apparently to the time of Avanti Varmma, the most flourishing period of the Kashmirian rule (A.D. 854-883). Mallot, the first place described, corresponds closely with Seng-ho-pu-lo or Singhapura, the capital of the Salt Range of Hwen-Thsang. The fort justifies the Chinese pilgrim's description of being difficult of access, as it has a precipitous cliff from 100 to 300 feet in height on three sides, and is protected by a fortified cliff on the fourth. The only remains of any antiquity at Mallot are a temple and gateway built of coarse sandstone, in the Kashmirian style of architecture. After leaving Mallot, Hwen- Thsang travelled upwards of eight miles to a stone stupa of Asoka surrounded by 10 springs of water. This General Cunningham had now pretty satisfactorily identified with the holy fountain of Ketas, above which there are still seven pools round three sides of a rocky spur. Across the bed of the stream above the holy pool, there is an embankment, which, in the days of Kashmirian rule, retained the accumulated waters of the valley for irrigation. Both at Ketas and at Mallot numerous coins of the early Indo-Scythian rulers were found ; so both places may be assiuned to have been occupied before the Christian era. Near Bhon 250 coins were discovered, two of which were recognized to be pure Greek, of Heliokles and Antialkidas, and the others as Indo-Scythian, as coins of the Hindu and Jajuha Rajas and Mudammadan rulers. The sites of the old cities in the plains of the Punjab are marked by o-reat mounds of ruins, very similar to those on the Yusufzai, except that they are composed of bricks, and not of stones. It is thus almost impossible at the present time to form the faintest idea of the style of building then prevalent. The old fort of Shorkot is probably the loftiest of all the mounds in the Panjab. It is composed of sun-dried bricks, partly faced C 4"], [126, "34 HARAPA. MULTAN. with burnt bricks, built on a natural eminence on the bank of the Chenab. To the east there is a large sheet of water which doubtless occupies the place whence the many millions of sun dried bricks were obtained. Burnes visited Shorkot in 1831, and described it as a mound of earth surrounded by a brick wall, and so high as to be seen for a circuit of six or eight miles. He obtained from it a coin of the Greek king Apollodotus ; and General Cunningham received from Shorkot large parcels of Indo-Scythian coins, proving its antiquity. Besides the coins, beads of crystal, agate, cornelian, &c, were found, as well as moulded bricks of various patterns, which are a characteristic feature of all the cities in the plains of the Punjab. Some of the bricks bore inscriptions dating apparently between 79 and 319 A.D. The ruins of Harapa are the most extensive of all along the banks of the Ravi. They comprised, at the time of Masson and Burnes' visit, a ruined castle (now no longer in existence), a tomb of a gigantic Naogaja, and portions of a large square building with rooms surrounding a courtyard as in a Buddhist monastery. The walls were very massive, but the whole have now been removed, and have sufficed to furnish brick ballast for about 100 miles of the Lahor and Multan Railway. Harapa is probably the Po-fa-to of Hwen-Thsang, the population of which was very dense, there being at the time of his visit 1,000 monks, besides 20 Brahmanical temples. Depalpur was a place of much importance during the whole period of the Pathan rule, and had, according to tradition, 84 masjids, 84 towers, and 84 wells. The adjacent lands were watered by a canal drawn by Eiruz Shah from the Sutlej. On the banks of this canal there stood at the time of General Cunningham's visit in 1838 a masjicl ascribed to Eiruz Shah, but this has since been pulled down to supply materials for civil buildings. Tulamba was once a strong fort with an outer rampart 200 feet thick, but was abandoned in consequence of a change in the course of the Ravi, which took a more northerly direction, and thus cut off the principal supply of water. It was' sacked and pillaged by Tiniur on his way to Delhi, but the fort escaped. The brick facings of the old ramparts were then removed to build the walls of the new town. Several specimens of ornamented bricks were brought from hence by General Cunningham. Multan was formerly situated on two islands in the Ravi, but some centuries ago this river changed its course, and joined the Chenab 32 miles above Multan. It is now a walled city and dis mantled fortress, situated on opposite banks of the old bed, and"], [127, "TEMPLE OF SUN-GOD. 35 stands nearly 40 feet higher than formerly, owing to the accumula tion of rubbish of centuries. The fort was a mile and a quarter in circuit, and had 46 towers or bastions, including two flanking towers at each of the four gates. The walled city was very nearly three miles round, and the whole circuit, including the unwalled suburbs, between four and a half and five miles, which agrees closely with Hwen-Thsang's estimate of 30 li. During high floods, however, the waters of the Ravi still flow down their old bed, and the ditches of the town are filled. In the time of Hwen Thsang there was a magnificent temple erected to the sun god Aditya, whose statue was of pure gold adorned with precious stones, and appears to have been greatly venerated. Both temple and statue are said to have been destroyed by Aurangzib, but General Cunningham has succeeded in satisfactorily identifying the site as being exactly in the middle of the fort. Erom a consideration of the legend of the building of the temple and making of the idol (as related in the Chach-Nama in Dowson's edition of Sir H. Elliott), as well as of the devices on three silver coins, each of which bears a rayed head Hke that of the Indian sun god, General Cunningham is led to ascribe its origin to Diwahij, the founder of a dynasty of kings which ruled over Multan and Sindh for 137 years prior to the usurpation of the Brahman Chach. The only Hindu remains at Multan are several gigantic stone rings called Mankas, similar to some at Harapa, and some fragments of statues in a temple, which are said to have been made by Ader, the father of Abraham \u2014 so complete has been the clearance of idolatry during the Muham medan rule of upwards of 12 centuries. In the absence of Hindu remains, General Cunningham sank several wells within the fort, but only one yielded objects of interest. In this one the presence of two coins of different dates at different depths tends to prove that the accumulation of debris has been about 22 feet in 2,000 years, or at the rate of 1^ foot per century. Glazed tiles and bricks were discovered, and arguing from the depth of the \" layer \" or stratum in which these occurred, a confirmation is afforded of the belief that glazed tiles were intro duced by the Muhammadans, and that the older bricks were much larser than the more modern ones. Two lavers of ashes were also discovered, and their positions corresponded very nearly with the conquest of Multan in A.D. 712, and the capture and massacre of Malli (which General Cunningham has identified with Multan) by Alexander's soldiers, when enraged at their commander's wound."], [128, "36 JALANDHARA. Multan may probably be identified with the Kaspaturos of Hero dotus and Kaspeira of Ptolemy. The Muhammadan remains at Multan consist of several of the long brick tombs assigned to Nao-gajas or \" nine-yarders,\" as the existing tombs of Muhammadans fallen in action against Hindus are called throughout the North-West Provinces and the Panjab. Every one of these is described as a warrior and martyr, and the tombs are of gigantic size. It is a curious fact that Hindus as well as Musalmans pay their devotions at these tombs, and place lights before them on Eridays. The chief monument in Multan is the great tomb of Rukn-ud-din, the grandson of Bahawal Hak. It is an octagonal building of red brick, bonded with beams of sissu wood, surmounted by a hemispherical dome, and about 100 feet in height, and, standing in a conspicuous position on the north-western edge of the fort, can be seen for a distance of 12 or 15 miles all round. The rich district of Jalandhar formerly comprised the whole of the Upper Doabs between the Ravi and Satlej. It was also called \" Trigartta \" or the land watered by three rivers. The capital of the country was the city of Jalandhar, and Kot Kangra or Nagar Kot was the only stronghold or place of refuge in times of trouble. According to the legend, the famous Danava Jalandhara from whom the name is derived was the son of the Ganges by the Ocean, who is considered the Eather of Rivers. When the boy was grown up, the sea withdrew his waves and left a tract of country, extending 300 zojanas in length, as residence for him. This, General Cunningham thinks, would appear to be a traditionary remembrance of the fact that the sea formerly extended up the valleys of the Ganges and Indus, a fact which was demonstrated by the late Dr. Ealconer in his \" Pal\u00e6ontological Memoirs and Notes.\" The Rajas of Trigartta'or Jalandhara have played but an unim portant part in history, so far as we know, yet their names are so frequently brought to notice in inscriptions or in the Hindu history of Kashmir, or in the Muhammadan history of Delhi, that their genealogy is of some importance for reference, both to the historian and the numismatist. Erom various sources General Cunningham has been enabled to give their genealogy for a limited period, i.e., from 1315 to 1847, A.D. The old fort of Pathankot, situated in the middle of a narrow neck of land between the valleys of the Bias and Ravi, at the point"], [129, "PATHANKOT AND KOT KANGRA FORTS. 37 where they leave the hills, naturally became the great emporium between the two rich valleys of Kangra and Chamba, and the great cities of Labor and Jalandhar. The name is said to be derived from the Hindu Fathdn a road, and to have nothing to do with the Afghan Pathans, but this point is uncertain. The old fort is now a mere mound, but it furnished bricks for the Bari Doab Canal. The bricks were of a very large size, a sure sign of Hindu origin as well as of a great age. Among the coins discovered were only two of the Hindu rajas of Kashmir, which confirms the historical fact that their rule did not extend east of the Ravi. The most curious specimens, however, were six early Hindu coins dating as far back as the beginning of the Christian era. They are thin pieces of copper, either square or oblong, with a temple on one face and an elephant on the other. Beside the temple are the symbols of Swasti and Dharma, and underneath it a snake, while before the elephant there is a tree surrounded by a Buddhist railing, with an Arian legend on two sides. The famous fort of Kot Kangra or Nagarkot was probably built and occupied at an early date, but no present portion of it is older than the 9th or 10th century. It has played a conspicuous part in Hindu and Muhammadan annals, and its history, which is tolerably fully given by General Cunningham, has been a fluctuating and a troublous one. The earliest notice of it is at the time of Mahmud (A.D. 1009), but it probably belonged before that for several generations to the Hindu rajas of Kabul, who no doubt hoarded up the enormous treasure found there by Mahmud. The fortress occupies a long narrow strip of land in a fork between two rivers, and the precipitous cliffs on which it stands make it very strong, while on the town side a deep ditch has been cut at the foot of the walls. In Bhawan, a suburb of the city of Kangra, stands the famous temple of Mata Devi, which was desecrated on several occasions by the Muhammadans. Terry, the chaplain of Sir Thomas Roe in Jahangir's reign, states of it, on the authority of Tom Coryat, that in Nagarkot there was \" a chapel most richly set \" forth, being seeled and paved with plates of pure silver most \" curiously imbossed over head in several figures, which they keep \" exceeding bright.\" Thevenot, the Erench traveller, says of it that pilgrims used to sacrifice parts of their body there, and this is also related by Abu Eazl. According to the universal traditions of the people, Akbar was told that Kangra was famous for four things,\u2014 1. Manufacture of new noses ; 2. Treatment of eye com plaints ; 3. Bansmati rice ; and 4, Its strong fort. General Cun-"], [130, "TEMPLE OF JWALA MUKHI. 38 ningham could learn nothing about the treatment of the eyes, but the repair of noses still goes on, although to a less extent than during the Sikh rule, when amputation of the nose was a common punishment. But people still come from Kabul and Nepal to be treated. The practice is to obtain the flesh for the new nose by cutting a piece from the sorehead of the patient. This is sewn over the aperture and supported by rolls of cotton with quills inserted for breathing. The famous temple of Jwala Mukhi or \"the flaming mouth,\" is built over a fissure at the base of a high range of hills about 20 miles S.E. of Kangra, from which fissure an inflammable gas has been issuing from time immemorial. The present temple of Jwala- Mukhi is built against the side of the ravine, just over the cleft from which the gas escapes. It is plain outside, in the modern Muhammadan style of plaster and paint, with a gilt dome and pinnacles, and a gilt roof inside. The finest thing about the build ing is the splendid folding door of silver plates, which so struck Lord Hardinge that he had a model made of it. The gas escapes from the crevice very slowly, and when pilgrims are numerous the attendant Brahmans keep up the flames by feeding them with ghi. The flaming fissure is believed to be the fiery mouth of the goddess, whose headless body is said to be in the temple of Bhawan. The Sultan Eiroz Tughlak is said to have paid a visit to the temple on his way to Kangra, and the Hindus have pretended that this was an act of worship, and that by thus propitiating the goddess he was enabled to take Kangra. It is however most improbable that the motive of the visit was anything but curiosity. Kanhiara, where are some well-known slate quarries, possesses two massive inscribed blocks of granite, an account of which was published by Mr. E. C. Bayley in 1854. General Cunningham assigns the inscription to the end of the first century, during the flourishing reign of the Indo-Scythian Kanishka. . At the small village of Chari, 8 miles E. of Kangra, the founda tions of a temple of importance were discovered by Mr. Eorsyth in 1854. A carved stone with an inscription has been deciphered by General Cunningham, and proves to be Buddhist, being the only trace of Buddhism he has seen in the Kangra valley. The fine temple of Baijnath stands in the village of Kiragrama. It possesses an inscription from which it appears that the date of the temple is A.D. 804, and that it was repaired extensively at the hand of Raja Sansara Chandra II. in 1786. In an appendix on ancient Indian architecture, General Cunning-"], [131, "INDO-PERSIAN AND INDO-GRECIAN STYLES. 39 ham remarks that in the numerous ancient ruins of the Yusufzai country, two very distinct styles of architecture may be traced, which appear to have differed widely from the styles of Persia and Greece. These he has named Indo-Fersian and Indo-Grecian. The former appears to have extended over the whole of Northern Indian, from Kabul to the banks of the Ganges, while the latter is found only to the west, in the districts of Peshawar, Rawal-Pindi, and Kashmir, or in other words, the ancient provinces of Penko laitis and Taxila. The former may safely be looked upon as an older style, which was probably introduced by the Ach\u0153menides during the period of' Persian supremacy between B.C. 500 and 330, and prevailed over the whole of the Kabul valley and Western Panjab previous to the occupation of the Greeks. The latter was most likely introduced by the successors of Alexander the Great. The prototype of the Indo-Persian style may be seen in the well known pillars of Persepolis and Susa, the chief characteristics of which are a bell-shaped lower capital surmounted by an upper member formed of recumbent animals, back to back. The general prevalence of this style is perhaps best shown by the pillars repre sented in the bas-reliefs of Bharhut, Bodh Gaya, Sanchi, and Yusufzai. In Kabul, Kashmir, and the Panjab, the Persian style seems to have been superseded by the Ionic, Doric, and Corin thian orders of Greek architecture, which appear to have flourished there for several centuries. In India, where the supply of timber was abundant, the pure Greek style seems never to have taken root, and the builders of Mathura, Ujain, and Pataliputra adhered to the tall pillars, the bell capitals, and recumbent animal brackets of their Persian prototypes. But the early adoption of the beaded astragalus and the honeysuckle as ornaments of the monoliths of Asoka and of the gateway pillars and medallion borders of Bharhut, attests the influence which the finished beauty and harmonious symmetry of Greek forms had on Indian architects. The only specimens of the Indo-Persian style beyond the Indus are the two lofty columns near Kabul which are called Surkh Minar and Minar Chakri, and the numerous bas-reliefs of the Yusufzai sculptures. In all of these may be seen the bowl and bell capital which forms the connecting link with the architecture of Persia, as well as a base composed of a series of steps, a peculiar characteristic of this style. The date of the Kabul columns General Cunningham is inclined to fix between B.C. 50 and A.D. 100, or three centuries earlier than that assigned to them by Mr. ' Eergusson in his History of Architecture. The age of the"], [132, "40 INDO-PERSIAN AND INDO-GRECIAN STYLES. Yusufzai sculptures is still a disputed point, but he considers that they probably belong to pretty much the same period. The earliest examples of the Indo-Persian style in India are at Bharhut, in the gateways and sculptures of the magnificent Buddhist railing which General Cunningham discovered towards the end of 1873.1 Their date was probably from about 250 to 200 B.C., or certainly two centuries older than the Yusufzai sculptures. That the style, though probably the prevailing one of the period, was not indigenous to India, but was imported from the countries on the Indus, is rendered almost certain by the discovery of Aryan letters on the Bharhut gateway, characters which were never in use in Central India, and which must have been imported by foreign sculptors. Other specimens of the Indo-Persian style may be seen in the sculptures of the Buddha Gaya railings, the Mathura pillars, the Sanchi Stupa, the monolith of Buddha Gupta at Eran, and the pillars of the Narsinh temple. As all the existing specimens of Indo-Grecian architecture seen by General Cunningham are limited to the riparian provinces of the Indus, he is of opinion that its adoption was confined to those districts. The different styles of Greek architecture must have been introduced into the Kabul valley and the districts adjacent to the Indus as early as B.C. 200'. The total absence of specimens of earlier date than 80 B.C. may be accounted for by the devastation effected by the Indo-Scythian inundation. As mentioned above, the Indians appear to have adopted each of the three great styles of Grecian architecture, the Ionic, the Cor inthian, and Doric. The Indo-Ionic style is exemplified only in the Buddhist Vihar at Shah-dheri.2 The Indo-Corinthian style is found in all the Buddhist ruins in Gandhara, Peshawar, and Yusufzai, and in Manikyala east of the Indus. The similarity of the capital to that of the genuine Corinthian order is obvious, and a detailed enumeration of the chief points of similarity is given. The likeness is easily seen in the ruins of Jamal Garhi, examples of which have been reproduced by General Cunningham in the shape of illustrations to his report. The base of a column at Sahri-Bahlol closely resembles one belonging to the monument of Lysicrates, a representation of which is given by General Cunning ham side by side with one of the former, its torus or round projecting moulding being thickly foliated. No piece of shaft has 1 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 34. 2 See above, p. 32."], [133, "INDO-CORINTHIAN COLUMNS. 41 yet been discovered, but from the bas-reliefs it would appear that flutes were not used, but that round and square shafts were in use, and that the latter were frequently adorned with figures. These Indo-Corinthian pillars are by far the most beautiful examples of Indo-Greek architecture which have come down to us. The remains are very numerous, but nearly all imperfect, owing to the brittle nature of the slate out of which they were made, and the practice of manufacturing each capital out of several pieces clamped together by iron. As in some of the pure Corinthian examples, figures are introduced in the spaces between the acanthus leaves, the overhanging tufts of which form canopies. Here, how ever, the single figure or the chief one (where there are three) is always Buddha. Erom this circumstance, and the presence of Aryan letters as mason's marks, General Cunningham is led to fix the date of the pillars as co\u0153val with the similar specimens found in the Baths of Caracalla, i.e., about the first century before the Christian era. The substitution of Buddha was probably suggested by the establishment of the Buddhist religion under Kanishka, the Indo-Scythian king, temp. 57 to 27 B.C. Another innovation was the greater width of the capital and the consequent bolder treatment of the volutes and foliage. Some small figures of elephants dis covered probably originally stood on the top of one of the pillars, four being arranged back to back. The earliest known specimen of the Indo-Doric style, which are found only in Kashmir and the Salt Range of the Punjab, is the great temple of the Sun or Marttand, circa A.D. 400. The style however had probably been long in use before that. The great ovolo of the capital and the hollow flutes of the shaft correspond closely with the pure Doric style of Greece. The specimen has been already described elsewhere by General Cunningham and Mr. Eergusson. Mr. Burgess, the Arch\u00e6ological Surveyor of Western India, commenced his tour by a visit to the Buddhist caves at Junnar. These have been before described, but their chronological place among the other groups of Western India was uncertain. The Caves of Junnar are remarkably devoid of figure, ornament, or imagery, partly no doubt because the facades of many of the caves have peeled off in the lapse of centuries. The caves mainly consist of vihdras with cells \u2022 adjoining for the resident monks. They afford many instances of the mutilation of Buddhist emblems and images, in order to convert them to Brahman purposes."], [134, "42 MR. BURGESS IN WESTERN INDIA. Mr. Burgess next visited Dabhoi, the principal objects of interest at which are the old walls and gates, which are said to have been built in the glorious reign of Siddharaja Jayasinha (A.D. 1093 1142). Ahmedabad, which was next visited, was partly illustrated, about eight years ago, by a series of photographs taken by Colonel Biggs, and edited by Mr. Eergusson and Mr. Hope. Mr. Burgess considers, however, that it would be quite worth while to devote six months to the preparation of a volume on the architecture of the place, accompanied by a copy of the inscriptions. The suggestion of General Cunningham, to place religious buildings, no longer in use as such, under the civil authority of the place, with a view to then- conservation, might here be adopted with the best results. Among the Kathis of Than, a village close to the main road from Wadhwan to Rajkot, snake worship still fingers, and there is a small temple devoted to it. At Junagadh there are numerous antiquities. The rock of Kapra Kodia is rapidly disappearing before the Nawab's quarrynien, but in it there originally was a rock-hewn temple of great extent. The Uparkot or fort of Juna gadh is probably a rich mine of antiquities. It seems to have been the citadel of the old city, where the lieutenants of the Great Asoka and still later of the Gupta kings resided. It contains some wells cut to a great depth in the soft rock. Some rock-cut apartments, manifesting a high style of art, were discovered on the north of the Juma'ah Masjid at the time of Mr. Burgess' visit in 1869, and he suggests that beneath the enclosure of the Uparkot, which is now planted with custard apples, groups of buildings very probably lie hid, the debris above being unevenly scattered in heaps. Of the Buddhist convents mentioned by the Chinese pilgrim, there are still remains, though four hundred years of Musalman dominion and strife have obliterated every trace of . many of them. In the east of Junagadh, between the inhabited part and the walls beside the modern monastery of Bawa Pyara's, is a number of Buddhist caves. A quarry has been opened behind them, and it has already encroached on some on the north-west and east. Near the Uparkot is the mausoleum of the late Maiji Sahiba, who died about three years ago, which is one of the finest buildings erected in Kathiawar during the present century. The Great Asoka rock inscription at Junagadh attracted Mr. Burgess' special attention, as complaints had been made that Government had not secured for the use of science the most perfect copies attainable of this and other contemporary monuments in"], [135, "MR. burgess' arch\u00e6ological survey. 43 India. The first copy was made by the late Revd. Dr. J. Wilson, of Bombay, in 1837, and other copies have since been taken, but there were doubtful letters, which, however, Mr. Burgess thinks he has now satisfactorily settled. The 14 edicts into which the inscription is divided cover considerably over 100 square feet of rock, and facsimile impressions or stampages, by means of moistened paper, were taken by Mr. Burgess and an assistant. After visiting some Buddhist caves a few miles west of Dhank and the Kapra Kodia caves between Pathan and Siddhoar, Mr. Burgess repaired to Gumli, where he made a survey of all the temples. An examination was made of the Naulakha temple, the walls of which are built of slabs of the common Kathiawad sandstone set on edge and clamped together, a mode of construction which has hastened the ruin of the edifice, for trees and plants which have once got then- roots in between the slabs have split the wall. The carving on the outside is what has chiefly attracted notice to this temple, and four photographs of the sculptures were taken. A few yards from the outer enclosure is the spire of an old temple, of which the tower alone remains. Its walls, unlike the Naulakha, are smaller and very carefully jointed. East of this is the ruin of an old Jaina temple, and east of this again is the Jetha Wav, which must originally have been a large and noble public well. Outside its western gate, of which now only two brackets remain, but which a few years ago might have been saved by a few props and cutting down the vegetation over it, there are a few paliyas standing, the figures carved on which are mostly on horseback, the horses being covered with what looks like a thick quilt or chain armour. On February 15th Mr. Burgess visited Nana Gop, and discovered in the village the shrine of an old temple, which is probably the only fragment standing of the old city, which appears to have covered a considerable area round the present village. Mr. Burgess considers the building as the oldest structure of the kind in Kathiawar. After visiting Jamnagar and Mundra in Kachh, he came to Bhadresvar, the ancient city of which was formerly of great extent, but few buildings of which are now remaining. Mr. Burgess has reproduced the substance of a narrative furnished to him regarding the history of the place, but its chronology is very unreliable. The general plan of the temple is similar to that of the Jaina temples at Delwada on Mount Abu. There are curious subterranean chambers connected with it, entered by fisting up flagstones in the floor. On occasion of danger from Muhammadans or others, the D"], [136, "44 ARCH\u00c6OLOGY IN SOUTHERN INDIA. idols were hurriedly deposited hi these vaults, and sand thrown in after them to the level of the floor. A ground plan was made of this large temple, and drawings of several details. Two mosques, one of which is nearly buried in sand, were also examined here, as well as temples at Buoad and Anjar, which do not call for detailed notice. Bhuj was reached on March the 9th, and the mausolea of the Raos of Kachh were here visited, but most of them were damaged by the earthquake in 1819. Rao Lakhaji's is the finest and largest. Near Keda is the place of Pir Ghulam Ali, one of the prettiest places in Kachh. The buildings in it were examined by Mr. Burgess, and proved to have been erected about 80 years ago. The estate yields between 18,000 and 19,000 rupees annually, which is distributed in charity. Marching northward to the shores of the Rann, Mr. Burgess reached Kotai, where are the remains of an old city, with several ruined temples of perhaps the earlier part of the tenth century. On one part of the hill foundations still remain, showing that whole edifices must have been carted away for building purposes else where. Mr. Burgess then marched for some long distance along the shores of the Rann, and examined several reported temples, one in an old fortress on the top of an isolated rocky hill at Kanthkot. Sankesvar, though traditionally a place of great an tiquity, contained but little of note. The country to the east and north-east of Jhinjuwada would probably repay a visit, but this must be undertaken earlier in the season. Mr. Burgess' report of his operations, as narrated above, will be a more extensive one than that for last year, containing as it does the results of private researches made in past years. He hopes to finish the entire Survey in the course of two more seasons. In consequence of representations made by the President of the Oriental Congress of 1874, the Secretary of State has addressed the Madras Government on the subject of appointing an Arch\u00e6ological Surveyor for Southern India, in the same way as has been done in the other presidencies. It has been pointed out that, with a few exceptions, the antiquities of Southern India, though equally important, have not attracted the same attention that had been bestowed by the Asiatic societies of Bengal and Bombay on the arch\u00e6ology of Hindustan before the organization of the present Survey. The difficulties attending an arch\u00e6ological Survey in the south are greater than those that operate in the north and west, on account of the greater variety of characters used in inscriptions and ancient documents, which are not easy to decipher ; and on account"], [137, "ANTIQUITIES OF ORISSA. BREEKS' NILGIRI TRIBES. 45 of the mixture of Sanscrit with forms of local vernaculars now little understood. There is only one man living who possesses all the qualifications required of an arch\u00e6ological surveyor of Southern India. Mr. A. C. Burnell, District and Sessions Judge at Tanjore, combines, with a rare knowledge of the literary and religious history of Southern India, not only a thorough familiarity with Sanscrit and the modern Dravidean vernaculars, but also a unique acquaintance with South Indian pal\u00e6ography, a science which he has been the first to elaborate in a work recently published. The appointment of this gentleman to the post referred to has been suggested to the Government. It is probable that the whole question will receive the careful consideration of the Governments of India and Madras during the current year. The first volume of Babu Rajendralala Mitra's \" Antiquities of Orissa \" has appeared in the shape of a large quarto, illustrated by 36 lithographed plates. It contains the results of the author's labours while engaged on the arch\u00e6ological mission to Bhuvanes' vara in 1868-9 ; \u2014 an undertaking sanctioned by the Government of India mainly at the suggestion of the Royal Society of Arts in London, who recommended the grant of a large sum of money for the purpose of obtaining casts of some of the more important sculptures of ancient India. The second volume deals with the antiquities of the different localities, but it has not yet been received in England. A work on the primitive tribes and monuments of the Nilgiris, by the late Mr. J. W. Breeks, Commissioner of the Nilgiris, has recently been published by Government. Mr. Breeks' researches were undertaken in 1871, principally at the instance of the Trustees of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, who urgued upon Government the desirability of making a collection of the arms, ornaments, dresses, household utensils, and agricultural implements, and all other products of the manufacturing skill of these aboriginal tribes, whose ancient and distinctive customs are now fast disappearing. The work referred to contains the results of Mr. Breeks' labours to attain this object. It forms a handsome volume in quarto, and is profusely illustrated by photographs. VII. Meteorology in India. The organization of the Meteorological Department of India has recently been sanctioned by the Government. During the early d 2"], [138, "46 METEOROLOGY IN INDIA. part of 1875 Mr. H. E. Blanford had made a tour of inspection through the Bombay Presidency, Berar, the Central and North- Western Provinces, the Punjab, Oudh, and Madras, besides com municating by letter with the Government of British Burma, and the senior medical officer of the Andaman and Nicobar settlements. He had thus gathered ample information respecting the different systems in operation, their working and respective cost, and some practical acquaintance with then- merits and demerits. In his report, Mr. Blanford gives a brief notice of the principal features of registration as adopted in the different presidencies, as well as some notes on the general character of existing observations. He then proceeds to discuss the value of existing records, and in doing so arrives at the conclusion that a considerable portion of the registers of past years must be rejected as practically worthless ; this being more especially the case with the barometric registers, one half of which may perhaps have to be rejected. The abstracts of registers for Bengal he considers generally trustworthy, though the data of temperature and wind movements fall short of the desired standard. The Madras reports are probably the best in India, but they have not yet been published ; the abstract for 1874, however, is understood to be ready for the press. The published reports of the North-Western Provinces and the Central Provinces are of a more mixed character ; and Mr. Elliott is now reviewing the past registers of the first, with a view to expunge such uncertain work as can be detected. Most of the published work of the Punjab, Berar, and British Burma, Mr. Blanford believes to be of little value, excepting perhaps the registers of rainfall. The observatories of Colaba and Madras in point of trustworthiness and accuracy furnish standards of exceUence, below which all others must rank at various distances. There exist di .tributed through various Government offices a very large number of old rainfall returns. Some of these for Bombay have been recently examined by Mr. Chambers ; and Mr. Blanford considers that light would be thrown on the irregularities of rainfall, were all these old returns brought together, examined, and discussed. Mr. Blanford observes that the practical applications of me teorology which are most important in India are not those which have chiefly engaged attention in Europe and America. In extra tropical countries the chief practical object is to obtain due warning of stormy weather. In India, however, it is only on the coasts of Madras and Bengal, and that only for a few months of the year, tl.at a rapid and extensive interchange of reports (the most striking"], [139, "MR. BLANFORD'S SCHEME. 47 feature of the European and American systems) is desirable, and this is not therefore the chief object of the system. On the other hand, in all that relates to the distribution and. causes of rainfall, every part of India is profoundly interested. The primary require ment of a meteorological system is, that the information should be obtained from as wide an area as possible, and not only from the lowest stratum of the atmosphere on the plains and at the sea level, but also from the higher strata accessible ' to observation at hill stations. It is desirable, moreover, that low-lying and elevated stations (where such are available) should be grouped in pairs. Thus, in Southern India, Coimbatore on the plain, serves, to contrast with Wellington in the Nilgiris, while Hoshangabad and Pachmari, Deesa and Mount Abu, Purneah and Darjiling, Bareilly and Ranikhet, and Ludhiana and Simla, will afford similar valuable contrasts. Some stations on plateaux, such as Hazaribagh, Seoni, Sagar, Poona, and Belgaum, although not far from low-lying stations, will be retained on account of the special influence supposed to be exerted on the movements of the atmosphere by these plateaux. Coast stations and those situated at a short distance inland are also retained or established in somewhat close proximity, since such difference of position induces a very consider able difference in temperature, humidity, and wind direction at certain seasons of the year. With these excejitions, the observa tories have been sought to be distributed as equally as the nature of the country and the existence of suitable stations will admit of. A few have been weeded out where stations have been unnecessarily crowded. With regard to the kind and scope of the observations, it has been determined, with a view to economy, to restrict comprehensive registration to the smallest number of stations that will serve for the purpose. With the exception of the Bombay Observatory and the extensive tracts occupied chiefly by native states, viz., Rajputana, Ban dalkand, Chutia, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Jeypur, and Ava, the number of observatories already establised or sanctioned is sufficient for present purposes, although some changes here and there may advantageously be made. The first of the three classes into which the stations have been arranged (exclusive of those at which rainfall only is registered) will accordingly comprise the Madras and Colaba Observatories, a new one at Calcutta instead of the present one at the Surveyor- General's office, one at Allahabad, and one at Lahore. They will d 3"], [140, "48 PUBLICATION OF RESULTS. be the central controlling observatories at which continuous regis tration will be carried on by autographic instruments. At the same time they will be depots for verifying and issuing instruments to the inferior stations, for training schools for observers, and as far as may be for officers who may have the charge of the minor observatories. Experimental enquiries, of which several are urgently required, will be carried out at these observatories under the direction of the reporters. Of the second-class stations there will be 21, and here hourly observations will be recorded on four days in each month, and two sets of observations on other days ; while at the remaining stations, which are 70 in number, and will form the third class, only two sets of observations will be recorded daily at the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. As regards telegraphic communication of reports to the local and central reporters' offices, Mr. Blanford does not propose its adoption, except in the case of the storm-warning system on the west and northern coasts of the Bay of Bengal. Hereafter, how ever, it may become a necessity. Mr. Blanford lays particular stress on the necessity of bringing registers together speedily for investigation. To hope for the same success in prediction in India as has attended the storm-warning system in Europe and America, the same careful watching of meteorological changes as they occur day by day must be adhered to. The results will be published in two forms. To meet local requirements, daily observations, weekly or monthly abstracts, &c, will be published in the local gazettes or newspapers. The annual results for the whole of India and Burma will be brought together and issued in one general report. If the system now sanctioned is allowed to remain in operation for some years, it may confidently be anticipated that a real approach will be made towards acquiring a knowledge of the chief laws by which Indian meteorology is governed. It has hitherto been possible to lay down with any approach to accuracy the courses of the isobaric and isothermal lines for a limited portion of Northern India only. It will now be possible to introduce uni formity in the systems of meteorology in different provinces, to secure the reduction of all observations to the same standards, and thus to afford, for the first time, data for a complete discussion of the phenomena of the monsoons and their peculiarities in so far as they are connected with local causes. Mr. Blanford's report (the eighth) on the meteorology of Bengal for 1874 was issued last year. It comprises general meteorological returns,"], [141, "49 METEOROLOGY OF BENGAL. more or less, complete for 16 stations in Bengal, three in Assam, two in Madras, one in Arakan, two in the Bay of Bengal, and two in the North-West Provinces. In addition to the above, there is given, as in former years, a summary of the registers communicated by the meteorological superintendents of other provinces. The meteorology of the year 1874 affords striking contrasts when compared with that of its predecessor. In many respects, however, the atmospheric phenomena were very similar to those in 1872, and in less degree to those in 1870. The south-west monsoon was remarkable, both at its commencement and at its close, (as was also that of 1872,) for the number of storms which occurred in the Bay of Bengal. In 1873, on the other hand, but one cyclone was reported in the bay. In the commencement of the monsoon in June 1874 the rainfall was generally very scanty in southern and western Bengal, in the northern parts of Orissa, and on the Arakan coast; while throughout the whole of Behar, the North-West Provinces, the Central Provinces, and the north-east of the Assam Valley it was much above the average. In July and the greater part of August the area of deficient rainfall extended further north wards and westwards, including part of Behar. During this period, throughout the greater portion of the Lower Provinces, there was an almost complete, and, as far as recent records extend, an unpre cedented failure of the monsoon rains. During the same period in 1872 there was a marked, although much smaller, deficiency of rainfall over the greater portion of the same area. On the other hand, it may be said that in 1873 the rainfall was almost confined to the two months of the year, July and August, when it was in many places much above the average. With the slackening of the monsoon current in 1874 and the advent of variable winds a change took place, and, as in 1872, the rainfall became unusually heavy all over Bengal in the months of September and October. On the other hand, the rainy reason of 1873 may be said to have ended early in September. The points of resemblance between the peculiarities of the rainy seasons of 1870, 1872, and 1874 are remarkable, and afford some grounds for the hope that, even before the physical causes of such peculiarities shall have been satisfactorily explained, some use may be made of them empirically in predicting the probable course of certain seasons for some time beforehand. A forecast of this nature was called for by the Government of India in the latter part of July 1874, when considerable apprehensions were entertained regarding the prospects of the principal rice crop of the year. A d 4"], [142, "50 MIDNAPUR CYCLONE. SOLAR ECLIPSE. comparison of the peculiarities of the rainfall up to the end of July with those of past years, and the general similarity of the me teorological circumstances with those in 1872, induced Mr. Blanford to submit the opinion that the rainfall in the latter months of the monsoon would turn out as favourable as in 1872. This forecast, fortunately, was fully realized. A report on the disastrous Midnapur and Bardwan cyclone of the 15th and 16th October 1874 has been prepared by Mr. W. G. Willson, officiating reporter to the Government of Bengal. The centre of the cyclone, moving in a north-north-westernly direction, passed over the Sandheads about noon on the 15th, passed to the west of Saugor Island, and struck the coast line about long. 87\u00b0 37' E. Near Midnapur the course of the cyclone re-curved ; the centre passed about 15 miles to the east of that place between midnight and 1 a.m. of the 16th, and the vortex passed over the town of Bardwan between 6 and 7 in the morning. Between 1.15 and 3 of the afternoon of the same day the central calm was passing over the town of Berhampur, the storm having then greatly diminished in violence. The centre after this followed a more easterly path, passing to the westward of Bogra, and over the junction of the Tista and Brahmaputra, and the storm finally broke up on the western ridge of the Garo Hills, approaching, but not reaching, Goalpara, in Assam. The diameter of the body of the hurricane was, in round numbers, about 50 miles ; but outside this circumference, especially on the eastern side, a heavy gale of wind extended to some distance. The total solar eclipse on the 6th of April 1875 was observed at Camorta, in the Nicobars, by an Indian expedition under Captain J. Waterhouse, Assistant Surveyor General, an English expedition under Mr. R. Meldola and Professor Tacchini. The principal object of the present observations was to extend and apply the knowledge thus gained since 1871 regarding the chromosphere, to ascertaining as far as possible the chemical constitution and physical condition of the regions of the solar atmosphere extending from the photosphere to the furthest limits of the corona, of the height to which the successive layers of vapour extend from the photo sphere, and of the order in which they thin out. The Eclipse Committee of the Royal Society had recommended that the opera tions should be mainly photographic, and that an endeavour should be made to obtain photographs of the spectra given by the different layers of the coronal atmosphere, spectroscopes being used in conjunction with telescopes for obtaining line spectra, and prismatic"], [143, "51 EXPLORATION IN TIBET. cameras being employed for the purpose of obtaining images of the chromosphere and coronal atmosphere. The principal instruments of the Indian party (to whom Professor Pedler, of the Presidency College, Calcutta, was attached,) consisted of the Dodabetta equatorial camera, a spectroscopic camera, with Janssen's slide, spectroscope, and heliostat, and the great 9-in. Browning reflector from the Madras Observatory. Unfortunately, all these preparations proved abortive, as, although every arrangement had been made, and everything was in readiness at Camorta, whither both parties had repaired, thick clouds came up and obscured the sun during the whole period of totality, so as effectually to prevent the successful taking of any observation. This was all the more to be regretted, as at Mergui, where it was at first intended to have located one party, there was an absolutely cloudless sky. Owing, however, to the incomplete manner in which the English party had been equipped and organised, this division of the forces proved impracticable. IX. Geographical Exploration, Publications and New Maps. The account of the exploration by one of the native explorers attached to the Great Trigonometrical Survey of the journey made to the Namcho or Tengri Nur Lake in Great Tibet, has appeared in Colonel Walker's last report. The party consisted of a semi- Tibetan, who had been thoroughly trained for the work, with four assistants engaged from border districts. They passed through Kumaon into the Tibetan province of Hundes or Gnarikhorsum, and thence followed the south bank of the Brahmaputra to Shigatze, where they found there was a regular route to the Tengri Nur Lake, frequented by traders in borax, salt, &c, and also by pilgrims, whose character they determined to assume. Having purchased some of the long-legged sheep (the only means of carriage that would answer), they crossed the Brahmaputra, and having reached the Khalamba pass (17,200 feet above the sea), found themselves in the basin of the Tengri Nur Lake. The country is peopled by nomads, and a species of white bear is said to commit great havoc among the cattle. The party found all the \u25a0streams hard frozen ; springs of almost boiling temperature were frequent, and bore a similarity in some respects to the geysers of Iceland, one attaining the height of about 50 feet. A remarkable feature in them is that in winter the falling water is converted into"], [144, "LAKE TENGRI NUR (NAMCHO). 52 ice, and forms a hollow pillar of ice round them. The Great Tengri Nur Lake proved to be called Namcho or Sky-Lake, from its great altitude (15,200 feet). It is a splendid sheet of water, about 50 miles in length, by from 16 to 25 in breadth. It receives the waters of two considerable rivers and several minor streams, but has no exit. To the south the lake is bounded by a splendid range of snowy peaks, flanked with large glaciers, culminating in the magnificent peak Jang Ninjinthangla, probably 25,000 feet in height. The range was traced for nearly 150 miles, running in a north-easterly direction. To the north no high peaks could be seen, and the country appeared to be a succession of rounded hills with moderately flat ground in between them. Immediately north was a small lake, called Bui or Borax lake, from the borax, which is there produced in large quantities, and supplies both Lhasa and Shigatze. The party made the circuit of the lake, but their exami nation of it was brought to a close by the appearance of a band of robbers, who stripped the party so completely that they were forced to make their way to Lhasa as fast as they could. In Lhasa they managed to raise a little money by pawning their instruments, the large aneroid being fortunately mistaken for a gigantic watch. The proof of the existence of a great snowy range to the north of the Brahmaputra is interesting ; the Himalayan system, even at that distance, say 160 miles from its base in the plains of India, showing no signs of getting lower. The country northward is called Jamaata De, and is independent of Lhasa. It is inhabited by a law less set of people, and for a considerable distance northward is de scribed as being very much the same as that round the lake, but 60 marches to the north-east there are said to be signs of a more civilized country. Koko Nur Lake is said to be 2\\ to 3 months' journey north of Namcho, and the caravan road thither and to Jilling or Sinning runs from the east end of Namcho. An attempt will be made to despatch an explorer along this route, and so connect the Indian Trans-Himalayan explorations with a place that has been fixed by the regular survey operations of the Erench Jesuit Missionaries. The explorer's route survey extends over 320 miles of what has hitherto been veritable terra incognita. Latitude observations were taken at 10 places, and heights by boiling point and aneroid obser vations at 24 places. The geography of an area of about 12,000 square miles has been elucidated, and one northern tributary of the Brahmaputra has been thoroughly explored, thus giving us an idea as to how far back the northern watershed extends. The general"], [145, "53 EXPLORATION IN NEPAL AND TIBET. accuracy of the explorer's work is satisfactory, and he has shown a large amount of skill, observation, and determination. Another trained Asiatic explorer made his way from Pitoragarh, in Kumaun, through Nepal, into Great Tibet, and back across the Brahmaputra by the Gunduk river into British territory. More than one of the Nepal streams are crossed by means of a single rope stretched across, from which the traveller suspends himself, monkey fashion, by his hands and feet, carrying his luggage or merchandise on his chest. Eor those, however, like the Asiatic explorer, whose nerves are not equal to this feat, slings are provided. Slavery exists throughout Nepal, and all castes are sold into slavery, the father having power to sell his children; but this step deprives them of caste. It is said, however, that Jung Bahadur intends to abolish the entire practice. The Brahmaputra was crossed by the explorer about 83\u00b0 55' E. longitude, (where it is about 250 feet wide, and has a very gentle current,) on boats made of yak's hides sewn at the ends, and attached to sticks at the sides. On his return journey the explorer passed through Sansen, where there is a fort, gun foundry, and manufactory of small arms. Inside the fort, the walls of which are about 12 feet high, and made of brick and mortar, are two-storied brick buildings, which are used as the magazine, court-house, and treasury. Formerly 1,100 men used to be stationed here, but now there are 1,800, who are drilled by two discharged subahdars of the Indian native army. All over Nepal, in fact, military organisation is being amplified. Although the explorer was prevented from advancing further into Tibet than the vicinity of the Brahmaputra, he has contributed much valuable information concerning the Nepalese kingdom, our knowledge of which is still very fragmentary. The geographical results of the Kashghar mission, reference to which was made in last year's Abstract,1 have been considerable ; and Captain Trotter may well be congratulated on the success of his labours, carried on as they were in mid-winter. To the north of Kashghar he carried a survey through the Artysh valley, up to the Russian frontier at Lake Chadyr Kul; and though he was unable to strike off eastwards to the Terekty pass, and return by the road from there to Kashghar, he has satisfactorily connected his work with that of the Russian geographers. He subsequently surveyed about 150 miles of the road from Kashghar to the north- 1 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 61."], [146, "54 KASHGHAR MISSION SURVEYS. east, as far as the Belowti pass, 90 miles from Ush-Turfan, while Captain Biddulph surveyed the road from Kashghar eastwards to Maralbashi. But no opportunity was afforded for reconnoitering any portion of the long belt of almost unknown country at present ruled by the Atalikh Ghazi, which extends eastwards for a distance of probably over 700 miles beyond the points reached by Captains Trotter and Biddulph, nor of the road to the west leading into Khokand via the Terek pass. Captain Trotter afterwards surveyed the route from Yangi Hissar to Tashkurghan, and then westwards via Aktash, over the little Pamir, and ascertained that the Barkut Yassin lake of the Mirza on this plateau is one of the sources of the Aksu or Murghabi, and thus, in all probability, the chief source of the Oxus. Captain Trotter continued his survey down to Kila Panja in Wakhan, and was enabled to send a native surveyor down the Panja river to Ishkashim, and then struck northwards into unknown ground, and followed the course of the Panja for nearly 100 miles, finding its direction to be very different from what has hitherto been supposed. His furthest point was Kila Wamar in Roshan. An important exploration has since been made, from Eyzabad and Kolab up the river, to a point believed to be not far from Kila Wamar, by Colonel Montgomerie's havildar. Erom Panja Captain Trotter returned to Atkash and Yarkand via the Great Pamir, passing the lake discovered in 1838, and named Victoria by Lieutenant Wood, R.N. The pandit who accompanied Captain Trotter as far as Tashkurghan on the outward journey returned thence by a more direct route to Yarkand, carrying a traverse survey along an entirely new piece of road. While Captain Trotter was absent in Wakhan, one of the Hindu pandits was sent by way of Sanju to Khotan, with instructions to penetrate as far eastwards as possible. He traversed the ancient road to China as far as the Sorghak gold fields, and then returning to Keria, struck southwards along the road to Rudok, crossed the Kuen Luen range and the great table lands of the higher Himalayas on the western confines of Chinese Tibet, and reached the village of Nob, which is about 20 miles to the north of Rudok. Here he was stopped by the Chinese officials, and nearly turned back again by the road he came, but eventually he was permitted to go direct to Leh by the Pangong Lake. His work was very carefully executed, and has stood the usual tests, and has shown the necessity of large corrections being made in the work of 1865-66. A very elaborate and interesting volume of his survey operations"], [147, "INDIAN GAZETTEERS. 55 in connection with the mission has been published by Captain Trotter. It contains descriptive letter-press of the divers routes surveyed, appendices giving lists of the various observations, routes, &c, and is illustrated by a map of Eastern Turkistan and plans of Yarkand, Khotan, and Kashghar. The official account of the work done by Sir Frederic Goldsmid and the officers employed on the Persian Frontier Commission1 is still in preparation, but will probably be published in a few weeks. The map of Persia2 executed by Major St. John is still in the hands of the engravers, Messrs. Stanford, of Charing Cross. Its completion is looked for at no very distant date. The map of Western Asia prepared by Captain Felix Jones, I.N.3 has been completed, and is now in the Geographical Department of the India Office, awaiting such decision as may be arrived at with regard to its reproduction. Its scope and general character have been described in previous Abstracts ; the compilation, execution, and drawing are most elaborate ; and it altogether claims notice as a very remarkable specimen of cartographic skill. Among the maps prepared in the Geographical Department of the India Office during the year 1874 may be mentioned a map of the Hyderabad circar of Warungul in 12 imperial sheets ; and lithographs of 15 original drawings of surveys made by officers during the Afghan war which Colonel Eraser Tytler had amassed during his sojourn in Afghanistan in 1838-42. They contain topographical information respecting the Herat valley, the upper valley of the Helmund, the lower course of the river, and the country between the Helmund and the Argundab, which has never been published on any map. The value of a trustworthy book of general reference as to the geography, history, and resources of India has long been admitted, and much money has been spent by Government in efforts to obtain such a manual. In 1855 the work of compiling a gazetteer for all India was initiated by the Court of Directors, and the work proceeded in a desultory way until 1869, when the necessity of taking steps to ensure uniformity in the gazetteers of the various provinces was forced upon the Government from several quarters. On the 3rd July 1869, Mr. W. W. Hunter, who was then engaged on the Gazetteer of Bengal, was directed to take the whole question into consideration, with a view to prescribing the principles accord- 1 See Abstract for 1872-3, p. 62. 3 Ditto ditto p. 64. 3 Ditto ditto p. 66."], [148, "56 INDIAN GAZETTEERS. ing to which all local gazetteers should in future be prepared, and for the consolidation into one work of the whole of the materials that might be available. In accordance with these instructions, Mr. Hunter visited the different provinces of India, and submitted a plan for an Imperial Gazetteer. One main feature of this plan was, that the local gazetteers should be prepared in consultation with a central editing officer, who should be charged with the duty of seeing that they were prepared on a uniform system, so that they might easily be incorporated in due course into an Imperial Gazetteer. The plan was adopted, and Mr. Hunter was charged with the duties of central editor in addition to those of compiler of the Bengal Gazetteer. In consequence of the enormous cost of literary labour and printing in India, the work of compiling and printing the Bengal Gazetteer goes on in England, while the work of amassing statistics and making enquiries on the spot is intrusted to five local assistants. Dr. Hunter, as editor, divides his time between inspection of the work in England and India. Five volumes are now finished, furnishing the statistical account of 13 out of the 37 districts comprising the Lower Provinces of Bengal. These five volumes deal with an area of 45,844 square miles, and a population of 21,768,747 souls. The accounts of the remaining districts are in various stages of completion.

The intention of these Annual Abstracts is to indicate the more important and interesting opera tions of the year, previous to an examination of the detailed reports, with their valuable appendices. They are also designed to be useful for future reference. It is hoped that the abstracts attain these objects. Foot notes are given, referring the reader to passages in the Memoir, or in the Abstracts for 1869-70, 1870-71, and 1871-72, in which the previous history of each operation is described, and the previous services of officers that are mentioned is given. The Memoir appeared in 1870, and Annual Abstracts have been published in the four succeeding years. In 1875, the fifth year, a second edition of the Memoir will be published, embodying all the contents of the four Abstracts and the work of 1874 under the respective heads, and containing many corrections and additions. In the new edition the Memoir will be differently arranged, and pains will be taken to eliminate all the errors of the first edition and to make up for all former omissions and shortcomings.

Indian Marine Surveys, 1873. The increasing necessity for making due provision for the surveys of the Indian coasts and harbours, and for the supply of accurate charts, has been fully recognised during the past year, when the enclosures to the Secretary of State's despatch, dated March 30th, (No. 7) 1871,1 received careful consideration. In a reply, dated June 30th, (No. 26) 1873, the Government of India requested that Captain A. D. Taylor of the Indian Navy, might be deputed to Cal cutta, to assist them in devising suitable means for restoring to efficiency the Marine Surveying Department, which had ceased to exist in any form since 1861. Captain Taylor arrived in Calcutta on the 22d of December 1873, and has since prepared, under instructions from the Government, a review of all existing charts and material for charts of the coasts and islands of British India ; and a scheme to supplement and perfect existing charts both by working up materials not yet utilised, and by fresh surveys, fully detailing for each project the agency by which he would propose to carry it out, the time it would probably occupy, and its probable cost. Captain Taylor's exhaustive report reviews each chart and plan, pointing out their deficiencies and estimating their intrinsic and relative value ; so that a most complete knowledge is thus obtained of existing requirements. Commencing at Chittagong the old plan of Captain Lloyd is found to be very incomplete. Next comes the chart from Chitta gong, across the sea face of the Sunderbuns, to Cuttack {Bay of Bengal, Sheet 5).2 It is a most useful chart for navigation, but the increase of the banks and the alterations of the channels at the Megna mouths of the Ganges, during 10 years, call for a revised survey of the approaches. Then follows a complete blank in the i See Abstract for 1869-70, p. 11. 2 See Memoir, p. 25."], [162, "2 NEW SURVEYS REQUIRED. series of charts embracing the Bay of Bengal. From Palse Point in Cuttack to the Santapilly rocks, a distance of 250 miles, the coast of India is unsurveyed. Here the mouths of the Mahanadi are continually changing, and the wreck charts exhibit many casualties. The four-sheet chart of the Coromandel Coast, by Fell and Sweny, is good \u2022} but it requires more deep-sea soundings, especially off Cocanada ; and the bay there, a most important port, ought to be re-surveyed, owing to the great changes wrought by the river Godavari. The surveys of Palk Strait and the Gulf of Manaar were never completed, and the central parts of the channels have not been sounded. As these are the approaches to the Paumben channel, and to deeper cuttings that hereafter may be undertaken, this work is very urgent. The west coast of India was surveyed by officers of the Indian Navy, a large section by Captain Taylor himself,2 and the charts are published in three sheets, about 5 inches to a degree, a very good scale for navigation ; and also on the large scale of half an inch to a mile, in 13 sheets, together with several plans of ports on larger scales. But gaps occur at the junctions of five of the surveys along this coast, a fact which shows that a Survey Department without efficient supervision necessarily leads to mistakes entailing future disaster and loss. The first gap is off Calicut and Beypur, another off Boria Pagoda, and others at the mouth of the gulf of Kach, and off Aripo in the gulf of Manaar. But the most dangerous blank is off Danu in the north Konkan, where reefs extend five miles off shore. Here the steamer \" Feroze \" struck heavily during the last S.W. monsoon. The plans of Cochin and Alepi need correction, as both the Cochin bar and the Alepi mud bank have changed ; and more accurate soundings are needed off Calicut and Beypur. Colachull, the coffee port of Travancor, has never been surveyed at all, and Narakal is in the same position, while Enciam Islet and the deep water between it and the main and Mangalore require examination. The plans of the ports of Ratnagiri, Bajapur bay, Viziadrug, and Deogurh, are all incomplete and require re-examination. The gulf of Kambay now requires re-sounding, as the banks have materially changed in the 37 years since the last survey of Lieut.

These are the most important out of the long list of desiderata, as regards the Indian coast ; but the surrounding islands also require attention. The southern half of the Laccadives, including Minicoy, need survey and to have their geographical positions tested by astronomical observations with good chronometers. The Andamans also require more thorough examination and careful survey, and the channel between them and the Nicobars needs to be better known. The scope of the annual surveying operations will be limited by financial considerations, and by the number of surveyors that are available. At Calcutta there are only three or four, and at Bombay none. A surveying vessel, when on her ground, would usually be anchored as a mark, whilst her boats and tenders were away sounding, and each of these should have a good surveyor with the boat's crew. Captain Taylor in his report, proposes that there should be a Superintendent of Marine Surveys with a clerk and two draftsmen, and a staff of a dozen qualified surveyors ; and it is also of great importance that each vessel should have a medical officer of scientific attainments, who would have peculiar advantages in making collections and pursuing investigations in natural history. As for vessels, wooden pilot brigs and schooners are recommended, each with a steam pinnace ; and a steam tender. The work to be done is thus calculated. Three seasons of seven months each will suffice to render the existing charts of the Burmese coast sufficient for present requirements. The coast of Chittagong and its river mouths, and the Megna mouths of the Ganges would occupy one brig with a tender, and two steam pin naces, one whole season ; whilst the survey of the sea face of the Sunderbuns would be postponed until the land surveys in that direction are complete. One brig would be employed, for a season, on deep-sea soundings in the Bay of Bengal; and another in surveying the several ports along the Madras coast. The coast from Point Palmyras to the south-west for 270 miles, demands immediate attention ; and there is the advantage, to the surveyors, of being able to connect their work with several stations of the coast series of the Great Trigonometrical series. Two vessels, with steam pinnaces, might complete this work in nine months. A brig and her tender might complete the examination of the unsurveyed straits leading to the Paumben channel in four or five months. But the Madras Presidency urgently needs a special small survey"], [164, "4 NEW SURVEYS. party of her own, with a steamer, to survey the port of Colachull, Enciam Islet, and the deep water between it and the main, to get more soundings between Beypur and Calicut, and to make periodical examinations of Cocanada, Alepi, Cochin, Narakal, and Mangalore. On the Bombay coast the shifting mouth of the Kauli-nadi (Karwar river) requires periodical examination, and large scale surveys are needed of the ports of Honore, Vingorla, Ratnagiri, Viziadrug, Jaighur, Chaul, Hubshi-Jinjerah, and others. Lieut. Palmer, R.N., the commander of the iron-clad Magdala, is to make an elaborate survey of the bottom, throughout certain portions of Bombay harbour, with reference to a system of defence by torpedoes. North of Bombay the coast was never minutely examined; and certain portions were absolutely neglected. The foul ground off Danu requires immediate attention, and this dan gerous projecting part of the coast should have a light. Damaon and Bulsar have never been fully surveyed, and the entrances to the Surat, Broach, and Tankria rivers are known only to native local pilots. The whole gulf of Cambay very urgently calls for thorough re-examination ; and fortunately most accurate deli neations of the shore lines can be obtained from the recent work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in Kattiwar and Gujarat. Captain Taylor recommends that the first survey should be from Point Palmyras to the south-west, and the second of the Great Megna flats, or shoal water off the mouths of the Ganges and Brahmaputra. He would then take up, in succession, the Andaman and Nicobar Isles, the Sittang river, the gulf of Cambay, and the Chittagong coast. Changes may be expected at the mouths of all large Indian rivers, the Indus, Narbada, Tapti, Krishna, Mahanadi, Ganges and Brahmaputra, Irawadi, and Salwin ; and also at the bars of minor rivers, especially at Mangalore, Cochin, Negapatam, Chittagong, Bassein, and Rangoon. These, and periodical changes in the form of banks, will demand the continuous services of three or four vessels. The first year's expenses are estimated at 2,8001. for the superintendent and his establishment, l,B62l. for outfit and repairs, 7,050Z. for the survey from Point Palmyras and Bimltpatam, and 8,787\u00a3. for the survey of the Megna mouths of the Ganges, making a total cost of 20,000Z.

They propose, in order to undertake accurate surveys of localities not yet surveyed, and to maintain the accuracy of the charts, to organise a small survey flotilla. It is to consist of one steam tender, three brigs, two schooners, and five steam pinnaces, with competent surveyors and efficiently manned. The following vessels have been selected for this service : \u2014 The gunboat \" Clyde,\" a steamer belonging to the Bombay Government, of 300 tons and 60 h.-p. (nominal), two old teak-built pilot brigs of 300 tons, the \" Guide \" and the \" Megna,\" the \" Marie,\" a teak-built schooner, on board of which Captain Constable did his surveys in Persian Gulf from 1858 to 1860, and a very small schooner called the \" Augusta.\" Two of the steam pinnaces will be built at Calcutta for BOOL each. They will be 28 feet long by 7 feet, with engines of 3 h.-p., and will hoist inboard. Two others are to be built in this country. The whole annual cost, including a superintendent of marine surveys, is not to exceed 20,000^. The vessels will be pro vided in India ; and it is hoped to commence the first year's surveys, namely the coast between Point Palmyras and Bimlipatam, and the mouths of the Ganges, in the end of 1871. Captain Taylor, than whom no man living has a more thorough knowledge of the subject, both from long experience and natural love of the work, is to be the first Superintendent. Thus, after a dreary period of 12 years, during which the surveys of the Indian coasts and the safety of the great mercantile fleet which frequents them, were entirely neglected, the marine survey department is to be restored to efficiency. The office of marine surveyor general was abolished on Captain Lloyd's retirement in 1840, after which time the work was carried on at hap-hazard, with no efficient superintendence, and in 1862 it ceased altogether. Its restoration to efficiency is an important measure which will be the means of preventing much loss, and of securing the safety of one of the largest mercantile fleets in the world, so far as accurate charts and reliable sailing directions can effect that great object. Lieut. Stiff e (late I.N.), formerly employed for nine years on the surveying service of the Indian navy, has compiled a new chart of the Makran coast, which has lately acquired some importance owing to the establishment of telegraphs along it since 1862. As this"], [166, "6 NEW CHART OF THE MEKRAN COAST. officer had served for many years on this coast, the Admiralty sug gested his employment to construct a new chart based on his own observations, and embodying all the information that he or other officers had collected. It is now being engraved. It is a revise of that made by Bracks and Haines in 1829, and a few particulars of the old survey will explain the value of the present work.1 The former survey was commenced at Jashak by Bracks on the 22nd January 1829, and had progressed as far as Chahbar by the 8th February, on which date the surveyors sailed for Maskat, where Bracks was invalided, and left for Bombay. Haines, who now took command and continued the work, returned to Chahbar by the 20th February, and finished the survey to Karachi by the 10th April. He thence returned to Gwadar to correct the chronometric measurements between that place and Karachi, and left the coast for Bombay on the 26th April. Considering that the time occupied, after deducting twelve days for the trip to Maskat, was only 67 days for the survey of 540 miles of coast (without including the windings of the coast-line), it can only have been by unremitting hard work that any chart could have been produced, with the resources of one small and dull-sailing vessel, E.I.C.S. \" Benares.\" The general correctness of the chart reflects the highest credit on the authors, indeed, according to the standard of hydrography of fifty years since, it was a high class work. They had but four chronometers, all of which did not go well, and as they carried on the survey by a series of chronometric measurements, made at each day's position, the only part triangulated being the great bays, extreme accuracy could not be expected, especially on that part west of Gwadar, which was not checked by a return measurement. It does not appear that Bracks, on leaving, made over any note books to his successor ; and Lieutenant Stiffe has been unable to trace any memoir of his on the part of the coast he surveyed. The information in \" Horsburgh,\" is from the original explorers in 1774. Haines' memoir, which refers to the coast be tween Chahbar and Karachi, appears never to have been published until the present time. [Taylor's Sailing Directory, 1874.] The latitudes of the old chart are fairly correct, the errors not exceeding 1 to 1^ miles. 1 See Memoir, p. 10."], [167, "7 NEW CHART OF THE MEKRAN COAST. In general, the part by Haines is obviously done in more detail than that by Brucks. The new chart has been based upon a table of positions, the authority for each of which is given. A correction in the Persian gulf longitude of Maskat and the Arabian coast of \u2014 30\", and in that of Jashak of \u201443\", has been adopted, in consequence of additional nieasurenients. For Sunmiyani, and places to the eastward, the triangulation of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India has been made use of. The original observation book of Haines has been discussed, and the trigonometrical data contained in it replotted. The longitudes of the charts are referred to Madras instead of Bombay, as Karachi, the starting point, has been connected by the G. T. S. with Madras more recently, and is probably more correctly determined than Bombay : thus, o Longitude of Madras, according to results of Taylor's observations 80 14 19 Diff.

The coast-line in the neighbourhood of the above astronomical positions has been re-surveyed as far as time would admit. Jashak bay, with the coast-line between Ras-al-Kuh and Ras-Jagin, is altogether new work, as also is Gwadar bay. Many landmarks and hills have been fixed, and their heights measured by theodolite. These heights, with the results of careful observations for varia tion, and some information as to the tides, are given in the table of positions. Many additional soundings have been taken, chiefly during cable operations. The style of delineation of the coast-line has been much modified in accordance with the received hydro graphical symbols of the present day. The names of places and their orthography have been the subject of much study, and the system is in conformity with the rules of the Indian Government. With the sailing directions, now about to be undertaken, will be forwarded for record a book showing the authority for each name, and reason for its adoption. Should it be"], [168, "WRECK CHART FOR 1873. 8 considered desirable at any future time to revise the names, this book would be of some service to the person undertaking it. The rest of the chart has been completed from the following sources : \u2014 Coast of Arabia below Maskat, carefully reduced from the original large scale M.S. of Grieve, and from Capt. Dayman's soundings. Coast of 'Oman, west of Maskat, and coast west of Jashak, from the Persian Gulf chart. From Jashak to Chahbar from Bracks' survey. From Chahbar to Sunmiyani from Haines' survey From Sunmiyani to Karachi from Carless' survey, The deep soundings from Jashak to long. 66' from Chitty's soundings, and from long. 66\u00b0 to 67\u00b0 from the chart of the coast of Sind by Grieve. The details inland are taken from the routes of Government political and telegraph officers. The sketches of the land are original (three by Captain Constable). The correction of the longitude of Maskat of \u2014 30\", above referred to, will involve the alteration of all the Persian gulf longitudes by the same amount. It is founded on the new measurements made by Lieutenant Stiffe to Karachi, Mr. Girdlestone to Bombay, and also on telegraphic determinations of Biishehr by Major St. John, R.E. As it is possible that eventually a further correction of 15\" \u2014 20\" may be found necessary, it may not be worth while for the present to alter the existing Persian gulf chart so small an amount. Thus, the chart hitherto used, which was made in 1829, and is no longer adequate to the hydrographical requirements of the present day, will be superseded by Lieutenant Stiffe' s new chart of the Makran coast, containing much additional matter. The additions consist of positions and heights of hills and soundings, while the chart comprehends a more extensive area, including part of the opposite coast of Arabia, which will be a convenience to the navi gator. Since the completion of the chart, Mr. Stiffe has been engaged in the preparation of detailed sailing directions for the coast, those in existence being very insufficient. A wreck chart from Karachi to Singapur, showing the positions of wrecks during the year 1873, has been published, from which it appears that the number of wrecks for that year was 20, besides the same number of casualties of other kinds. The Deputy Master Attendant, in his review of the wrecks, calls attention to the great increase of trade on the Coromandel coast, and the opening of"], [169, "NEW EDITION OF HORSBURGH'S DIRECTORY. 9 several new ports by the visits of the British India Steam Naviga tion Company's vessels. He urges the necessity for a survey from Point Palmyras to Bimhpatam, and for large scale charts of all the harbours, roadsteads, and rivers on the Coromandel coast. He also represents the importance of a re-survey of the sea face of the Sunderbunds, where the sands have extended, and there are several rivers with good entrances requiring examination. Captain Taylor, before he left England for Calcutta in the autumn of 1873, completed the new edition of the first part of Horsburgh's East India Directory.1 This well-known work had already gone through eight editions since its original publication in 1809, under different editors, who added considerably to its bulk, without sufficiently curtailing the original matter. Captain Taylor's edition is in reality almost a new work. He has adopted the system of brief paragraphs, dropped the marginal references, given abbre viations well understood by seamen, and introduced block-printing of important names and words to catch the eye. The opening of the Suez Canal necessitated a notice respecting the navigation of the Mediterranean, and Captain Taylor of course gives terse and succinct, but sufficiently complete, directions for the Red Sea. His introduction treats of the trade winds, monsoons, currents, land and sea breezes, storms and cyclones, variation and deviation of the compass, and tides. II Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, 1872-73. During the year 1872-73, the work consisted of 92 triangles, covering an area of 11,058 square miles, with the great theodolites ; and of 3,224 square miles closely covered with points for the topographical surveys, with smaller theodolites, while in an area of 7,290 square miles of a portion of the Himalayas, inhabited by independent tribes, several points have been fixed which will be valuable for preliminary geographical requirements. An area of 2,734 square miles has been topographically surveyed in the Himalayas on a scale of one inch to the mile, and an area of 3,878 square miles on the 2-inch scale, in the Bombay presidency, in the course of which 2,734 linear miles of boundary and check lines have been traversed. 1 See Memoir, p. 279."], [170, "10 TRIANGULATION IN ASSAM. The southern section of the Bildspur series,1 being a longitudinal chain of triangles extending from Bombay to Vizagapatam, was completed during the year 1871-72. The party, commanded by Mr. W. C. Rossenrode, then commenced a triangulation on the meridian of 82\u00b0 from the Bidar series northwards, to meet the triangulation on the same meridian which was brought down from the Calcutta longitudinal series by Mr. Keelan. The country was very hilly and without roads, but in three months Mr. Rossenrode carried the operations northward a distance of 94 miles, where they formed a junction with those of Mr. Keelan. The country in which Mr. Rossenrode and his three assistants were labouring, is one of the most malarious and deadly in India. It is the region in which Colonel Everest commenced his career as a trigonometrical sur veyor in 1818, when he was stricken down by jungle fever,2 and it was here that in 1870 Mr. George Shelverton lost his life.3 Mr. Rossenrode and his whole party suffered more or less from fever. Their way led them past Jaipur, the capital of a wild hill chief ship, and the hill of Sihoa, which is considered to be one source of the Mahanadi river. Meanwhile Mr. Keelan worked southwards on the same meridian for a distance of 55 miles, and thus the series was completed.* Mr. Keelan describes the country as the wildest tract it has ever been his lot to work in, covered with forest, and presenting no well defined points to fix. The importance of the operations in the Assam valley lies in the necessity for connecting the surveys of the Sibsagar and Lakhimpur districts, which were commenced several years ago, with the general topographical survey. Progress has been slow, owing to the extraordinary difficulties. The whole surface of the country is covered either with patches of sorest, or with dense jungles of bamboo and long grass, and the entire length of line between continuous stations has to be cleared. A single line occupied a party of 25 cutters 36 days to clear. The country is very thinly inhabited, so that supplies of labourers have to be brought from a distance, while the most healthy time of the year i See Memoir, p. 115 : Abstract for 1869-70, p. 11 ; for 1870-71, p. 18, and for 1871-72, p. 11. \u00ab See Memoir, p. 55. 3 See Abstract for 1869-70, p. 12. * See Abstracts for 1869-70, p. 12; for 1870-71, p. 18; and for 1871-72, p. 11.

The atmosphere is clearest just after the termination of the rainy season when jungle fever is rife and the country is very deadly. In the dry season the jungle fires give rise to a canopy of smoke which shuts out distant objects from view. The Assam series was commenced in 1867 by Lieutenant Larmirie, near Gowhatty. In 1870-71, the triangulation was advanced 86 miles by Mr. W. C. Rossenrode, and in the following year Mr. W. G. Beverley carried it 40 miles further. During the season of 1872 73 Mr. Beverley did not advance the principal train of triangles quite 20 miles, though several points were fixed on the hill ranges to the north of the valley. The series is now approaching the town of Sibsagar, while the secondary triangulation has defined the Dufila hills to the north, and will be useful in the operations for fixing the British frontier. The Jodhpur series is one of the two internal chains of triangles which remain to complete the great north-west quadrilateral, the exterior chains of which connect the base line of Karachi, Sironj, Dehra Dun, and Chach, near Attock. The Jodhpur meridional series will be carried northwards, so as to close on the Sutlej series. Lieutenant Rogers, who is in charge, fixed 12 new stations dining the season, extending over a direct distance of 95 miles, preliminary operations being advanced 52 miles further. The country is very favourable, being sandy with isolated hills, the chief difficulty being the scanty supply of water. On the other hand the Jodhpur Durbar rendered most cordial and effective assistance. The Mangalore meridian series was carried southward from the Bombay longitudinal by Captain Haig and Lieutenant Trotter between 1865 and 1867. 1 Operations were then suspended, and resumed by Major Branfill in 1872-73, and continued south until it joined the longitudinal series which connects Mangalore with Madras. It was thus completed. The series passes for above a hundred miles along the crest of the Western Ghauts, a tract of hills and forests, clouds and mists, rivers and torrents, and one of great beauty. It is the Maisur district of Naggar, aud that portion of it known as the Malnad or \" rain district.\" The valleys are 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the sea, with the rivers Bhadra, Tunga, Choradi, Warda \u2014 all flowing to the north. But one of them, the Sheravati, draining the Bednore (Bidarur) or Naggar 1 See Memoir, p. 112. Abstracts for 1869-70, p. 12, and for 1871-72, p. 12. (10057.)

This was ground gone over in the early days of the survey by Colonel Lambton, and several of his station marks were found. During the previous seasons, from 1870 to 1872, the work of the Brahmaputra series,1 on the meridian of 90\u00b0, had been restricted to preliminary operations. Last season Captain Carter took the field early and made satisfactory progress. Much hindrance was caused by the mists in the mornings, and the smoke of the village fires towards evening. The series was extended for a direct distance of 56 miles, and will probably be completed during the ensuing season. A series of secondary triangles was carried eastwards from the principal series, to fix the town of Mymensingh. A great deal of work was completed during 1872-73 on the Kattiwar topographical survey, 2,642 square miles having been surveyed, and an area of 2,680 square miles triangulated in advance for the work of next year. The operations lay chiefly in the northern portions of Jhalawar, in a bare and sterile county which is bordered on the north by the Rann of Kach. The topo graphy of the eastern half of the province is now nearly completed, and a survey of the town of Rajkote, the chief place in the province, will be made on a scale of 12 inches to a mile. When the operations of the survey reach the shores of the gulf of Kach, every effort will be made to connect them with the survey of that gulf by Captain Taylor, I.N. The original maps of the survey were lost, but Captain Taylor had fortunately retained copies for his own use, which were lithographed through the Geographical Department of the India Office, and copies have been sent out to India. Captain Trotter had charge of the Kattiwar survey until nearly the end of the season, when he joined Mr. Forsyth's embassy to Yarkand, and was succeeded by Captain Pullen. A peculiar feature of the part of Kattiwar that was surveyed in 1872-73 is the number of large \" baolis \" or wells, built some hundreds of years ago near what were then large and populous towns. Some of them are very roomy and beautiful, the covering and the ornamentation of the approaches being elaborate and elegant. A broad flight of stairs, richly ornamented at the sides, generally leads down to the water. There is nothing above 1 See Memoir, p. 114.

Captain Trotter also gives an interesting description of the Rann of Kach, and of the new and extensive government salt works at Patri.1 The Gujrat survey,2 under Major Haig, was employed during 1872-73 upon the topography of some portions of the Kaira collectorate, the whole of the Pitlad Mahal in the territory of the Gaikawar of Baroda, and nearly the whole of the territory of Kambay. The area completed was 1,175 square miles. The first attempts to incorporate the Bombay Revenue Survey details with the scientific Topographical Survey failed. It appears that while in Bengal the periphery of a village is first measured, and all interior details are then referred to it ; in Bombay so called \" base lines \" are first measured in the interior of the village lands, and all subse quent measures are referred to these lines by offsets. The Bombay method, therefore, gives the greatest accuracy in the central portions and least on the boundaries, while the converse is the case with the Bengal system. This is the reason why the revenue operations in Bengal are so valuable for topographical purposes, while in Bombay every attempt to construct general maps from the revenue materials has hitherto failed.3 The marks selected were almost invariably on the exterior boundaries where the work is most inaccurate ; whereas, for the above reason, the interior marks would have been best adapted for the purpose. When Colonel Walker returned to India he determined to make another more carefully devised attempt to utilise the Bombay revenue details. He arranged that Major Haig should be supplied with all the data of the revenue survey measurements, as given in the original field books, in addition to the lithographed village maps, which had hitherto been the only materials available for the purpose, and that he should have the assistance of some of the revenue surveyors, especially as all the field books are written in Gujrati. Major Haig was not joined by this revenue party under Mr. Dalzell until February 1873 ; so that it is premature to draw any positive conclusions as to the results of the experiment. i See Memoir, p. 118, and Abstracts for 1869-70, p. 13; for 1870-71, p. 19, and for 1871-72, p. 12. 2 See Abstract for 1869-70, p. 13 ; for 1870-71, p. 18, and for 1871-72, p. 12. 3 See Abstract for 1870-71, p. 34. B 2"], [174, "14 MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE. But Major Haig is already satisfied that great use may be made of the revenue survey materials in improving the accuracy of the topographical maps, as soon as a more extensive and systematic connexion is made between the fixed points of the two surveys than has yet been attempted. \"The combination,\" he thinks, \" will \" permit of the construction of topographical maps of all the British \" portions of Gujrat on a scale of four inches to a mile, with an \" amount of additional detail and accuracy, for which improve \" ment the public will be indebted to the Gujrat Revenue Survey.\" ** The survey of Kamaun and Gurhwal has, for two years, been under Lieut. J. Hill, R.E. In 1872-73 topographical operations were carried on in the Mana valley, in the lake country to the east of Naini Tal, in the country round Lohur Ghat, in the portions of the Gori and Ramganga valleys near Arkot, and in the Bhabar parganahs, sub-Himalayan tracts between Haldwari and the Sardah river. The region under survey has a range of over 25,000 feet in altitude, so that it presents every variety of climate. During the year, 2,734 miles were surveyed on a scale of one inch to the mile, and 353 were triangulated in advance for future operations. Much of this area was between 10,000 and 25,000 feet above the sea. Of late years advantage has been taken of the lines of telegraph, in Europe and America, to determine differences of longitude, and thus to obtain astronomical arcs of amplitude between two places situated on a common parallel of latitude, with reference to the determination of the figure of the earth. Formerly such arcs had been measured between points on the same meridian, because in that case it was only necessary to determine latitudes at the extreme points, which is one of the simplest problems of practical astronomy. But on arcs of parallel it is longitudes that are re quired, and their determination within the requisite degree of precision was extremely difficult and laborious. When, however, places are connected telegraphically, their differences of longitude can be determined with great precision. In 1872, some of the instruments which were ordered in 1863, designed by Colonel Strange, and constructed under his superintendence, arrived in India. These were two transit instruments, by Messrs. Cooke and Son, of York, two astronomical clocks by Frodsham, two chrono graphs by MM. Secretan and Hardy, of Paris, and electric 1 See page 23."], [175, "MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE. 15 apparatus. Colonel Walker determined to employ these instru ments, in the first instance, on the arc of parallel which crosses the peninsula of India in latitude 13\u00b0 from Madras to Mangalore, passing through Bangalore midway. This arc is of special interest, because it is situated mucli nearer to the equator than any similar arc that has yet been measured in any part of the globe. Its length is 361 miles. Captains Herschel and Campbell were selected to carry out the operations, who first made a series of most careful preliminary trials, ascertaining that no sensible in fluence, in one direction more than another, was exerted by earth currents. The mean of all the determinations gives a velocity of 17,000 miles per second, which is materially greater than the velocities deduced in the course of similar operations in Europe and America. But as several relays were used on those lines, and none on these, such a difference is only what might have been anticipated. The preliminary results are, that the difference of longitude between Madras and Mangalore by the trigonometrical measurement is Oh. 21m. 36-78s., and by telegraph Oh. 21m. 35-85s. The difference is 0 93s., which is equivalent to 13 95\" seconds of arc. The latitudes and longitudes of the stations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey have, for the last 40 years, been computed with the elements of the figure of the earth known as Everest's First Set of Constants, (equatorial semi-axis, 20,922,932 ft., ellipticity \u2022swTe)- Subsequent investigations have slightly modified these dimensions of the mean figure, and Captain Clarke gives the fol lowing elements in the appendix to his Comparison of the Standards of Length (1866) ; equatorial semi-axis 20,926,062 ft., ellipticity \u25a029W8- Using Captain Clarke's elements, instead of Colonel Everest's, the trigonometrical determination of the difference of longitude between Madras and Bangalore would be diminished by 3 \u2022 5\", and thus be brought into better accordance with the tele graphic difference, which is still 10 '5s. less than the trigonometric difference. This fact is consistent with the result of Captain Basevi's pendulum operations, which show that the density of the strata of the earth's crust is greater under the depressed beds of oceans than it is under lands elevated above the sea level. Thus the direction of the plumb line at Madras, on the east coast, is most probably deflected to the east of the normal to the mean figure, while at Mangalore the direction of the plumb Une is deflected to the west of the corresponding normal. The length of the -arc between the apparent zenith points is consequently"], [176, "16 PENDULUM OBSERVATIONS. diminished, and must, therefore, be less than the length deduced from trigonometrical observations. The observations to determine the astronomical latitudes of certain stations of the Survey were held in abeyance during 1872-73, as Captains Herschel and Camp bell, by whom they are carried on, were both employed on the longitude observations. The pendulum experiments l which have been carried on in India since 1865 have lately been brought to a conclusion by a series of observations made at the Kew Observatory by Captain W. J. Heaviside, R.E. In 1864, Colonel Walker, R.E., the Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, applied to the Secretary of State for India for sanction to undertake a series of pendulum experi ments in India in connexion with this Survey. His application was strengthened by opinions from several of the most eminent Fellows of the Royal Society in favour of the undertaking, more especially as affording an independent check on the local variations in the direction of the force of gravity, and on the disturbances due to the mountain masses north of India. The necessary sanction having been obtained, the Royal Society lent for the purpose of the experiments an astronomical clock by Shelton and two invariable pendulums. The equipment was sup plemented by a copper vacuum cylinder and an air pump. It was decided to make the Kew Observatory the base station in this country for the operations, and before the pendulums were sent to India they were swung there by Mr. Loewy. The apparatus arrived in India in 1865, and the work was at once commenced by Captain J. P. Basevi, R.E., who had been placed in charge of the operations in India. In the course of the next five years Captain Basevi swung the pendulums at some 19 stations on the Indian arc from Dehra Dhun to Cape Comorin, at two stations on the East Coast, and at two on the West Coast of India, and he likewise swung them at Minicoy, an island of the Laccadive group. In 1870, two convertible pendulums were lent to Colonel Walker by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg. These pendulums had been used on the Russian arc, and it was hoped that by their means a connexion might be established between the Indian and Russian pendulum operations. An arrangement for 1 See Memoir, p. 120."], [177, "PENDULUM OBSERVATIONS. 17 measuring the lengths of these pendulums forms part of the whole. apparatus, so that they are capable of giving not only relative results, such as are obtained by the invariable pendulums, but also absolute values of the length of the simple seconds pendulum. Captain Basevi had at that time but little opportunity of using these pendulums, and in the spring of 1871 he started for the lofty plateaux of Tibet, taking with him the invariable pendulums only. On his way to Tibet he took observations at Mian Meer, and passing through Leh, crossed the Takatung pass 18,060 feet in height, into the desolate region of Ruskshu. He there swung the pendulums at a station he selected on the More plain, 15,500 feet above the sea level. From More he made his way back to the Upper Indus, and, although suffering from a severe cold, he crossed the Marsimik pass and set up his tents and instruments on the Lanak plains, upwards of 17,000 feet above the sea. There, pro tected only by a teut, in a climate where the thermometer rises to 70 or 80 in the afternoon and falls below zero at daybreak, his illness increased. One morning, when gallantly striving to rise from his bed and commence work, he died, and by his untimely death the Survey lost the services of one of its ablest officers. Captain Heaviside was subsequently appointed to complete the operations. After some preliminary observations at Dehra and at Mussoorie he went to Kaliana, the base station in India for the pendulum experiments. He there took observations with the in variable pendulums to determine whether they had undergone any change since they were last swung there. He also swung and measured at Kaliana the Russian convertible pendulums. He then started for England, and on his way to this country he swung the pendulums at Bombay, at Aden, and at Ismailia, in Egypt, At the Kew Observatory he has swung the invariable pendulums, to deter mine whether they had undergone any alteration since 1865, and he has also carried out there a complete series of experiments with the Russian convertible pendulums for the determination of the length of the simple seconds pendulum. At the suggestion of General Sir E. Sabine a further series of experiments is being made with the convertible pendulum employed in 1818 by Captain Kater. The bar of this pendulum, owing to some unknown cause, had become bent. The bar has been re straightened and the knife edges re-ground and rebedded. In its thus altered condition this pendulum has been swung at the Kew"], [178, "18 COMPUTATION AND PUBLICATION OF MAPS. Observatory by Captain Heaviside. Lieut. -Colonel A. R. Clarke, R.E., has undertaken to measure the distance between the knife edges of the pendulum at Southampton. From the values thus obtained, a second determination of the length of the simple seconds pendulum at Kew will be made. Captain Heaviside will shortly return to India, when the final results of the whole series of experiments from 1865 will be computed out and arranged for publication. The operations of the computing office have consisted of a re adjustment of the secondary triangulation based on the several principal series of the North-West Quadrilateral, and of passing through the press the observations, reductions, and final results of the principal triangulation of the North-West Quadrilateral, which is now completed, and will form volumes III. and IV. of the \" Account of the Operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.\" As the whole contents of these volumes will not be needed by geographers, an abstract or synopsis is being prepared, which will give the descriptions and co-ordinates of the stations, and the sides and angles of the triangles. This information will be published in a separate volume for each of the principal series. The first of these synopses is now nearly ready. It is devoted to the work ot the great Indus series, and contains the positions of the whole of the points that have been fixed beyond the British frontier, on the spurs of the Hindu Kush range, and on the Solid Koh and Sulaimani ranges and their spurs. During the year Colonel Walker also brought out the second edition of his map of Turkistan, of which the first was published in 1868 in four sheets. It was accompanied by a memorandum giving an account of the various sources from which it was compiled. Major Montgomerie also prepared a series of \"Trans-Frontier Maps,\" on a scale of 16 miles to the inch, con taining all the most recent information of the region beyond the British frontier. They show the positions of towns, villages, rivers, and mountain passes, but omit the hills. Three have now been published, Nos. 4, 7, and 9. No. 4 comprises portions of Af ghanistan, Kafiristan, Badakshan, Bokhara, Karategin, Swat, and Chitral. No. 7 includes Chilas, Gilgit, Yassin, Kunject, Sirikul, the Pamir, Kashgar, Yarkand, and part of Tibet ; and No. 9 com prises Nepal, Sikkim, Bhotan, and Great Tibet. Good progress has been made with the series of level charts on which the results of the series of levelling operations for canals and railways are shown, after having been connected with the main lines of level of the"], [179, "TOPOGRAPHICAL SURVEYS. 19 Great Trigonometrical Survey and reduced to the same datum, namely, the mean sea level at Karachi. Twenty preliminary charts of the triangulation in all parts of India have also been published. III. The Topographical Surveys of India and Work in the Office of the Surveyor General, 1872-73. Seven parties belonging to the Topographical Survey were in the field during 1872-73, as in the previous year. The total amount of work done was 25,327 square miles of final topography, of which 14,054 were on the scale of one mile to the inch, 670 square miles of the Naga Hills on two miles to the inch, and 10,603 square miles in Chittagong, Tipperah, Lushai, and the Munipur Hills on the scale of four miles to the inch. Of this large area only 6,136 square miles were in British territory, and 19,191 in native states. The tracts thus explored were for the most part wild and unhealthy, and those in Bilaspur, Mandla of the Central Provinces, the Garo, Naga, and northern Chittagong Hills were covered with forest, in parts uninhabited, and never before entered by a European. No. 1 party, under Lieut. Holdich, was at work in Central India, near the river Chumbul, partly in a wild country belonging to Kota and Gwalior, and partly in the district of Chapra, a portion of the Tonk territory, which is split up into six sections scattered over the dominions of Jeypur, Bandi, Jhallawar, Kota, and Sindia and Holkar. Chapra is bounded on the east by the river Parbati, and has an area of 320 square miles. It is well drained and watered, bavin\"* hills 1,300 to 1,500 feet above the sea, whence flow streams to an open and well- cultivated tract in the west and north. Mr. Scanlan furnishes an interesting historical and statistical account of the district of Chapra. The party No. 2, under Mr. Girdlestone, was at work in the Narbada valley, in the territories of Holkar, Sindia, Dhar, and the British district of Nemar. An area of 1,872 square miles was topographically illustrated, and 2,013 square miles of triangu lation in advance. This is the second season during which Mr. Girdlestone has been at work in this difficult region, and his management has been marked by great energy and success. The block of country surveyed in 1172-73 consisted of a series of un-"], [180, "20 TOPOGRAPHICAL surveys. dulating plateaux with three distinct falls or ledges, between the Satpuras and the Narbada, which forms the northern boundary of the work. The survey of the Vizagapatam Agency was continued by Colonel Saxton's party (No. 3), working southward from the parallel of Vizianagram. The total amount of work was 1,636 square miles of final topography, and 1,500 of triangulation in advance. The country was throughout wild and inhospitable, and overrun with jungle, though the soil is in most parts good, and there is no want of water. Colonel Saxton draws attention to a fine tract of country with an area of about eight by two miles, which is in every way suited for a sanatarium, being easily accessible from the plains and only 50 miles W.N.W. of Vizagapatam. The hills are here 5,000 feet above the sea, the scenery beautiful, and water abundant. Party No. 4, under Major Depree, was at work in some of the worst portions of the country along the south-west side of the Sohagpur Taluk of the Rewah Native State, and the north-east border of Mandla in the Central Provinces. There were 2,57li square miles surveyed, including the \" Mekal pat,\" or Amarkantak plateau. Here, within only a few hundred yards of each other, rise the Narbada, the Son, the Johilla, and the Hali, one of the prin cipal feeders of the Mahanadi. All this ground was very carefully mapped. The Narbada and Johilla both cut their way from off the plateau by abrupt gorges and rocky chasms hundreds of feet in perpendicular depth, and the plateau is inhabited only by aboriginal tribes. The fifth party was at work in the Malwa native states of Bhopal, Narsingarh, Tonk, and Dewas, under Captain Riddell, over an area of 2,215 square miles ; and a plan of the city and fort of Bhopal was made on a scale of 12 inches to the mile. The Vindhyan range of mountains crosses the season's work, at a point where it is traversed by the Great Arc Meridional series. The pressing demands of the Bengal Government for the ex ploration and completion of the surveys in the Northern Chittagong hill tracts, the Tipperah, Lushai, and Cachar hills, the Garo and Naga hills, and along the northern Munipur frontier necessitated special arrangements. Four several detachments of No. 6 party were obliged to act independently of each other. Major Godwin- Austen took the Naga and Munipur hills. The Tipperah, Lushai, and Cachar hills were assigned to Captain Badgley ; Mr. Cook"], [181, "DRAWING AND COMPILING. 21 was in northern and eastern Chittagong ; and Lieut. Woodthorpe in the Garo hills. The objects desired by the Bengal Government were the demarcation and survey of the portion of the Naga hills contiguous with the Munipur native state boundary, and the ex ploration of the extreme frontier along the Patkoi range as far eastward as could be reached ; the completion of the survey com menced during the Lushai expedition, and a reconnaissance of the unsurveyed portion of the Garo lulls. Altogether 11,273 square miles were surveyed by these detachments. Major Godwin- Austen was unable to explore the Patkoi range further east than longi tude 94 ' 18' E., owing to the opposition of the Munipur Raja, which caused a diversion to the south, and led to the survey of a large portion of the Munipur State, between its disputed northern boundary and the capital. Captain Badgley's party were at work in the interior of Hill Tipperah, the north-east corner of Chittagong, and the Lushai country between Hill Tipperah and the finished surveys of the previous season. This region is crossed by parallel ridges running north and south, which increase in height from west to east, gradually narrowing the valleys between them, with the ridges so narrow at top as to be only knife-like rocks. The sides are covered with forests which are often impenetrable in the ravines and valleys. Mr. Cook continued the surveys in the Chittagong hill tracts south of Dewagiri, accompanied by Captain Lewin, the Deputy Commissioner, and a hundred men ; while Lieut. Woodthorpe completed the wrork in the Garo hills. The narratives of these officers throw much light on previously unex plored and unknown regions. They are extremely interesting, and will well repay perusal. The Rajputana party (No. 7) under Captain Strahan, delineated topographically 2,760 square miles of ground in the States of Meywar, Marwar, Shahpura, and in the southern portion of Mhar wara. Some of the ridges of the Aravalli hills, 4,000 feet above the sea, were within the area, and were extremely difficult of delineation. During tbe recess the party was employed on the survey of Simla, on a scale of 24 inches to the mile. Six large sheets of the Simla survey have already been published. Great progress was made in the drawing and compiling branch of the head-quarter office, under the energetic superintendence of Mr. J. 0. N. James ; in reducing, compiling, and incorporating, the latest survey results on the original sheets of the Indian Atlas. Nine new quarter-sheets have been taken up, and considerable ad-"], [182, "22 ENGRAVING AND LITHOGRAPHY. ditions have been made to 11 of the old full-sized sheets. A great number of other maps have also been completed, or are in progress. The new standard map of India on a scale of 32 miles to an inch, and the reduction on 64 miles to an inch have been advanced. The great obstacle to progress with these maps are the doubts and uncertainty which still exist, owing to the perpetual changes in the boundaries of districts and sub-divisions, more especially in Bengal, and to the various systems of spelling names. The standard map of Bengal, Bahar, Orissa, and Assam, on a scale of 16 miles to an inch will be published as soon as the boundaries of internal juris diction are settled. Maps of Oudh and Sind, for the local gazetteers are completed ; and a new district map of Darjiling on a scale of four miles to an inch has been compiled. Excellent progress has been made in the engraving branch, but the small European staff has been very unfortunately reduced, and it is extremely difficult to supply the places of the men who have retired. In the copper-plate printing branch 9,508 impressions have been taken of Indian Atlas sheets and other maps. The staff of native engravers and apprentices continues to make very good progress, and two give hopes of turning out fair hill etchers. Mr. Coard continues to superintend this branch with skill and energy, and is training a large number of native youths. Captain Waterhouse continues the charge of the photographic branch. During the year 1872-73 the number of maps that passed through his office was 1,611, of which 105,753 copies were printed from zinc, besides 2,010 silver prints, and about 3,000 photo collotypes. The process of steel facing the engraved copper plates under the superintendence of Captain Waterhouse has been worked with fair success, but the steel surfaces have shown signs of inci pient rust in spite of every precaution, and impressions are now taken from the stone. A method of correcting copper plates for erasures or additions with the aid of the galvanic battery has been successfully carried out by Captain Waterhouse. It is a similar process to the one employed in engraving department of the Depot de la Guerre at Paris, and the Military Geographical Institute at Vienna ; and by it the old process of \" knocking up \" the copper is entirely obviated. In the lithographic branch 481 new maps and plans were produced, and 159,652 copies were taken. Thus no less than 271,528 copies of maps have been struck off during the year, besides a vast amount of colouring and mounting. As many as 5,090 maps were forwarded to the Geographical Department of the"], [183, "REVENUE SURVEYS. 23 India Office, 25,817 were issued to Government officials in India, and to local agents 5,384. The total area produced by the Topographical and Revenue Surveys in progress was 41,839 square miles, at a cost of 111,878/., at an average rate per square mile of 21. 14s., being 11. 14s. for the Topographical, and 4d. 8s. for the revenue work. The aggregate result of Topographical and Revenue Surveys from 1817 to 1873 is 743,802 square miles at a cost of 2,002,833/. IV. Revenue Surveys. The Revenue Surveys under the Government of India are divided into the upper and lower circles. Of the former there were eight at work during 1872-73 in Muradabad, Muttra, Agra, Humirpur, Delhi, and Hissar, the North- west Frontier, and two in Bhawulpur. In the latter there were seven parties, in Luchmipur, Midnapur, Baitul, Bilaspur, and the Nasik and Ahmadnagar Collectorates in Bombay. There are now four cadastral surveys at work in the North-West Provinces, in Muradabad, Muttra, Agra, and Humirpur. The size of the fields is very small, averaging 0'94 of an acre ; and the enormous number of 1,269,882 fields were surveyed and computed in area by the four parties during the year. Colonel Gastrcll has introduced several processes by which the labour of mapping will be reduced to a minimum, and Government will be supplied with copies of the cadastral field maps for from 3J to 4| annas per imperial sheet, containing 1,250 acres. The cost per acre, which averaged five annas in 1871-72, has been brought down to three annas 11 pies. Another season's experience will place the working of the cadastral system on a thoroughly durable and satisfactory basis. But the immense advantage of accurate cadastral surveys is not confined to the questions relating to the settlement of the land revenue. They are also useful for railway purposes. The officers in charge of the cadastral surveys of Muradabad and Muttra have supplied working ground plans for the extension of the Rohilkand railways towards Rani Khet and Naini Tal. This is a great saving in time and expense of special survey, enabling the engineers to mark out then lines at once, and the civil officers to settle com pensation due to proprietors for land to be taken up for the railways."], [184, "24 CADASTRAL SURVEYS. NORTH-WEST PROVINCES. The cadastral survey of Muradabad under Major Vanrenen was commenced in November 1872, and continued until May 1873, the area comprising 731 villages, 376,191 acres, and 348,523 fields. It will be continued in 1873-74, and the amount of work done is very satisfactory. The field survey of every village was carefully checked by lines run across each, and a certain per-centage of villages was further tested by the Deputy Superintendent himself. The work is connected with the stations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The Muttra Cadastral Survey is under Colonel Aaderson, whose party measured 621,367 fields, the average size of winch was 0-6 of an acre. The wrork in the Agra district consisted of 167,115 fields, covering an area of 307 square miles ; and in Humirpur it was commenced in January 1873. The number of fields measured during the season was 132,877. All triple junction stations are to be permanently marked. The Delhi and Hissar revenue survey party, after completing the Kurnal district, commenced work upon that of Delhi, which contains 821 villages in three Tahsils. This survey is on the old plan, and is not being conducted as the previous four cadastral surveys. About half the Delhi district was completed in the year. The Derajat survey under Colonel Johnstone, was extended from Dera Ghazi Khan into Dera Ismail Khan, including the Indus on the eastern borders. The city of Dera Ghazi Khan has been surveyed on a scale of 12 inches to the mile. The two parties in Bhawalpur completed areas of 1,759 and 3,915 square miles respectively, and the boundary along Bikanir has been marked throughout by masonry pillars. All these operations have been connected with points of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. In the Lower Circle the work of the revenue surveys amounted to 2,875 square miles. There were two parties at work in Assam, in the districts of Durrung and Lackimpur. In Durrung the area was surveyed on a scale of 4 inches to a mile, except the lalchiraj or rent-free tenures, which are done on the 8 inch scale. About 48 square miles of hill sketching were brought in, of which 40 were in Bhutan. The Lackimpur party had to enter on the topographical survey of the vast tract stretching between the cultivated or revenue-paying area already done, and the watershed or natural boundary north and cast covering some thousands of square miles. Only 384 square miles were completed, owing to the diffieulty in obtaining carriages."], [185, "25 BOMBAY SURVEYS. During the working season of 1872-73 a party was employed in surveying 908 square miles in the districts of Hugli and Midnapur, and another in the Bilaspur district. In the Bombay Presidency two parties have been at work in Nasik and Ahmadnagar. The object of thus detaching two Bengal parties to Bombay was, not that the present Bombay local system should be abandoned, but that, in connexion with it, a plan of operation might be devised, which should secure maps available for geographical and general purposes. The plan, as now adopted, consists of a four-inch scale Mouzahwar survey, and a two-inch topographical survey of the hilly and jungly tracts. The surveyors are to make a complete skeleton smvey of the whole of the champaign country, with sufficient closeness to admit of the incor poration of every village boundary from the Bombay revenue survey plans, the triple boundary points of the villages being laid down as a basis for connexion by the Bombay revenue survey authorities. The internal drainage and topography are to be surveyed thoroughly by the Bengal parties, the village boundaries being taken from the settlement maps. By these arrangements all the Bombay districts will be laid down on one uniform scale, while the revenue survey \" fields \" will proceed intact, and be free from all clashing. It is believed that the Bombay field survey might lay down all details in the champaign country fit for incorporation on the general maps. Hereafter, when the Bombay survey maps are more advanced, and the topography is laid down on a better system than at present, it is hoped that congregated sheet village maps may be made on the foiu*-inch scale, according to the Bengal practice, instead of on the two-inch scale, and that the Bombay revenue survey materials may be then utilised for the purpose. These are the views and recommendations of the conference held at Calcutta on February 24th, 1873, consisting of Colonel Thuillier the Surveyor-General, Colonel Vanrenen, Deputy-Superintendent of Bengal revenue surveys, Colonel Francis, the Bombay survey and settlement com missioner, and Captains Coddington and Tanner, who have charge of the Nasik and Ahmadnagar surveys respectively.1 Colonel Laugh ton has now completed the survey of the town and island of Bombay. It was commenced on the 1st of October 1865, and completed on the 23rd of November 1872 ; at a cost of 31,306/., towards which the municipality contributed 5,000/. ; but, allowing 1 See page 13."], [186, "26 SURVEY OF THE TOWN OF BOMBAY. for the sale of maps, the actual outlay will only be 20,000/. The area surveyed is 22 square miles, 149 acres. The first regular survey of Bombay, for defining not only the boundaries of the Company's property, but also those of the holdings of the inhabitants and for specifying the nature of the tenures, was undertaken in 1811, and completed in 1827, under Captains Tate and Dickinson. The fort and old town were on a scale of 40 feet to an inch, and the remainder of the island partly on 100 and partly on 300 feet to an inch. The cost was 16,300/. The great changes in the features of landed property since 1827, and the additions to the area of the island by reclamations of foreshores, necessitated new maps ; and another survey of the island, in much greater detail, was consequently found to be urgently required. The scales sanc tioned were 100 feet to an inch for the fields and open country, and 40 feet to an inch for the fort and native town. Captain Nasmyth, of the great Trigonometrical Survey of India, triangulated the island, and fixed a series of points as a basis for chain measurements ; and Colonel Laughton undertook the detailed work of surveying each separate property. The corners of properties were fixed by cast iron marks. The outlines of high- water mark at spring tides and high-water mark at ordinary or neap tides have been carefully laid down all round the island. Levels have been taken at every 300 feet along the principal roads, and all the hills have been carefully and accurately contoured to every 1 0 feet. All the 172 sheets are of one universal size (3 feet by 2 feet), and everything is plotted up to the marginal lines, which are accurately projected parallel to the lines of meridian and latitude. Besides these sheets, which are on a very large scale, there is a reduced map of the island in two sheets, which are extremely useful. It is on a scale of 400 feet to an inch, and the sheets are 6^ feet long by 6 feet broad. The Government of Bombay have ordered measures to be taken for the maintenance of the boundary marks, and a law will be enacted to ensure a recognition of the record that has been made of the several properties. Much credit is due to Colonel Laughton for the accuracy and skill with which this difficult and important survey has been executed. The Survey Department in the Madras Presidency was organised in 1858, but only brought to its present strength in 1865-66. It is composed of 3,377 persons, made up of 24 officers, half military, half civilians, 30 upper subordinates, 1,805 surveyors, clerks, and draughtsmen, and 1,518 servants {i. e. chain and offsetmen, &c. &c)."], [187, "MADRAS REVENUE SURVEY. 27 It is under the direction of a military officer of the rank of colonel, and combines the operations of a revenue or cadastral survey, with those of a perfect topographical survey on a trigonometrical basis. The former, with few exceptions, is confined to land paying land tax to Government on the ryotwari system, and is plotted in village maps on the scale of 5 chains = 1 inch, exhibiting all topographical details and the limits of every field not smaller than two acres, recording its content both by survey and by the old native accounts, nature of tenure and eultivation, source of irrigation, if watered, present assessment, and name of ryot or tenant. Lands held on tenure other than ryotwari, such as zemindari, shrotriem, or inam, ranges of hills and tracts of waste land or forest of inferior value, are excluded from the minute detailed field survey. They are, however, topographically surveyed on a scale of 4 inches = 1 mile (unless of a rugged and unhealthy nature when a reduced scale is adopted) and from these topographical, revenue and purely topo graphical surveys combined, Talook maps are constructed on the scale of 1 inch = l mile. These are again reduced one half to form district maps. Up to the end of 1873-74 the Revenue survey of * eight districts had been completed and the survey of teight was in progress.

The excess of assessable area brought to light by the survey ranges from 2 to 23 per cent., the average being about 12 per cent. Of the 38,290 square miles, deducting 25 per cent, (an extremely (10057.) C"], [188, "28 MADRAS REVENUE SURVEY. liberal margin) for waste and unprofitable land, there remain 28,700 square miles which have been hitherto counted as only 25,600 for assessment purposes. Taking the average assessment of the Presi dency at Rs. 1-14-0 or 3s. 9c/. per acre, the addition of square miles 3,100 or 1,984,000 acres to the taxable area would represent an annual gain to the State of Rs. 37,20,000 or 372,000/., supposing that it were taxed at the existing average rate. The average size of survey fields is about two acres, and the approximate number measured and plotted in the eight completed districts is 7,000,000. 17,941 manuscript village and estate maps have been drawn ; of these 15.607 have been reproduced by lithography. The topogra phical maps of 79 talooks have been completed, representing 41,166 square miles, 55 having been lithographed. As yet only two dis trict maps have been compiled, two are under compilation, and materials for two more are being prepared. Since the commencement of operations the Madras survey has been connected with 264 Great Trigonometrical Survey stations. The average error per mile shown by the test of compariug the distance obtained by the Madras survey of a side of the G. T. S. Triangulation with the G. T. S. records is 7'61 feet. Photo-lithography has been employed for reduction and repro duction of maps since the beginning of 1873, and during the last year the manipulation has been much improved. After trying several methods of reducing maps, the following mechanical system of reduction is now employed, and is thought to be the best suited to the Madras survey. Lithographed impressions in blue of the village maps on the scale of 16 inches to the mile (the largest scale in general use) are combined in squares of a con venient size (40,000 feet), and the details required for the Taluq map on the 1 inch scale are slightly exaggerated on them in black ink. Each square is photographed separately, and the reduction from the scale of 1 inch = 1 mile 16 inches = 1 mile to that is obtained by one negative. The carbon prints (transfers) of each square are pieced together carefully on a sheet of paper, on which the same squares have been mathematically projected on the smaller scale. The whole is then transferred to stone. The district maps are compiled in the same manner, with the additional accurate check of having the G. T. stations with lines of latitude and longitude projected on the sheet of paper on which the transfers are pieced together. An adjustment of the squares is also made by which the"], [189, "29 GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. convergency of the meridians is provided for, and by these means correct geographical position is given to the district maps. Photo-zincography has not been fairly started yet on account of there being a large stock of lithographic stones on hand, a large number of which must be first used, and also because the few zinc plates in this office are not of a very good kind. A new supply of zinc plates is expected from England, and in the course of a few months photo -zincography will gradually begin to replace photo lithography. Engraving on copper has also been started in the Central Survey Office. A map of the city and suburbs of Madras has been engraved, and it is proposed to issue engraved maps of other important towns and cantonments ; arrangements are being perfected for the re production by electrotypy of the engraved plates, which will permit of the original being kept in store and revised when necessary. V. The Geological Survey of India, 1873. Dr. Oldham, who may be said to have founded the Geological Survey, took sick leave for Europe early in April 1873, for the first time during twenty -two years ; and this is the first annual report that has not been drawn up by him. It was written by his accomplished colleague Mr. H. B. Medlicott. For the last half of the year, six out of the small staff of geologists, were absent from India. Mr. Blanford has been busily engaged in England, working out the zoological collections he brought home from Persia ; Dr. Stoliczka accompanied the embassy of Mr. Forsyth to Kashgar ; ** Mr. Fedden and Dr. Waagen have been obliged to leave India on sick leave; and Mr. Willson has left the Geological Survey for an appointment in the Educational Department. His is a permanent loss ; for the Government has decided that the pay of his appoint ment shall be devoted to the experimental training of native apprentices. Commencing with the formations to which the Indian coal measures belong, Mr. King accomplished a very satisfactory season in the region of the lower Godavari. He revisited the Singareni coal field, which he had discovered and described in the preceding i The news of the melancholy death of Dr. Stoliczka on his way back from Kashgar, has lately been received. C 2"], [190, "30 COAL MEASURES. season. Numerous trial borings had meanwhile been put dowm by the Nizam's officers, and a considerable amount of coal proved, although the seam was not found to be continuous throughout. The Beddadanole coal field was also examined, and the Madras Government has given orders for prosecuting the search there, by borings. In this region only three members of the great rock series had hitherto been discriminated, namely, the Talchirs, the Barakars, and the Kamthi sandstones, which Mr. Blanford had followed down the Godavari from Chanda, where he had, from the evidence of the fossil plants, ranked them with the Damuda horizon. But, from fossils found in the upper sandstone series of the Godavari basin, it is considered that, in part at least, it represents formations younger than the reputed age of the Damudas. The obscurity regarding the correlation of this whole series of rocks with established formations has been owing to the failure hitherto to link any important por tion of it with beds containing a distinctive marine fauna. Such a connexion was made with the Rajmahal group, through the Kach deposits, but the connexion of the Rajmahal group itself with the main rock series is very uncertain. Mr. King has at last hit upon what may yield a clue to the puzzle, namely, a fossiliferous zone of marine beds at Ragavapuram, 30 miles due west of Rajamandri, well intercalated with the upper sandstones continuous with those over lying the Beddadanole coal measures. He has also found fossils in the same region, 30 miles N.N.E. of Cocanada, in some detached sandstone beds along the northern margin of the Godavari delta. Dr. Stoliczka has recognised them as on the horizon of the upper most Jurassic zone, in the Kach series, which had long been assimilated to the Rajmahal group. Above these rocks, and under lying the trap, Mr. King discriminates a belt of sands with a thin limestone, which he conjectures to be cretaceous. The working out of all these suggestive discoveries is of the greatest importance to the geological history of India. The Warda coal fields, in the northern part of the Godavari basin, engaged the attention of Mr. Hughes during the whole season. Two pits have been sunk to the coal, one at Warora and one at Pisgaon. Mr. Medlicott took up work in Satpura, with the intention of carrying out the examination of formations closely connected with the coal measures there, and by which they Avere concealed; and at the same time he was to afford geological guidance for the borings he had recommended in the Narbada valley. These trials were undertaken upon the probability that the"], [191, "31 COMPLETION OF THE PEGU SURVEY. Satpura coal measures might here extend from the Sitarva field, beneath the alluvial plain. No depth could be assigned for the covering deposits, but from 200 to 500 feet was given as the pro bable range. Borings are in progress, but the upper deposits have proved to be of great thickness. In the Damuda basins Mr. Willson spent the season in retracing the lines of the Karapuna coal fields on the newly issued maps of the Hazaribagh district. Mr. Hacket traced the boundaries of the Vindhyan and older rocks on the new maps, along the northern side of the Narbada valley, filling in a large area. Mr. Mallet took up an important section of the crys talline and metamorphic rocks in South Bahar, with the advantage of the new large scale maps of Hazaribagh. Far to the south-west Mr. Foote was at work in the southern Mahratta country. So much of the gross area was gone over as was necessary to close in the north-east quarter of Atlas Sheet 41, and work was carried on in the quartzite area around Toragul and Ramdrug. In the extreme north-west Mr. Wynne was engaged in working out the ground to the north of the salt range, where the tertiary series occupies a large area and forms the outer ridges of the mountain region. The top and bottom horizons are identifiable with the Sivalik and Subathu groups of the sections far to the east, but the same marked divisions of the series are not expressed in the west. A long stretch of intervening mountains between the Jhilum and Ravi remain to be examined. The survey of Pegu was completed by Mr. Theobald in 1872-73. This work was commenced in the end of 1861 by Mr. Blanford, assisted by Mr. Fedden, and Mr. Theobald took Mr. Blanford's place in 1861. All the formations have a north and south strike, and are thus absolutely cut off along the frontier, but on the east the boundary is very regular and natural. The difficulty of observing rocks in a wild tropical region like that of Pegu is, however, very formidable. Rank vegetation produces deep soil ; and it may be days before, in marching through a hill country, the geologist gets a fan section of rock in place. Fossils, too, are very scarce in Pegu. Enough only have been discovered to establish the existence of triassic, cretaceous, and numnmlitic strata, forming the Arakan Yomah, beneath the general mass of younger tertiary deposits on the east, forming the Pegu Yomah. The south-eastern districts of the province form a distinct geolo gical field from that now completed by Mr. Theobald. They are entirely formed of crystalline and sub-metamorphic rocks, in"], [192, "32 IRON which there is much promise of metalliferous deposits. On this account Mr. Fryar, the mining geologist, has been deputed to examine them. Mr. Bauerman, a metallurgist, was employed dining 1872-73, to examine and report upon the iron ores of India, with a view to the promotion of iron manufacture. His conclusion is the same as that which has long been expressed by the Geological Survey, namely, that under existing circumstances the Raniganj coal field is the most promising place for a trial, the principal defect there being the flux, and further search has been dihgently made by Mr. Hughes, of the Geological Survey, for means of surmounting the known deficiencies. As regards the requisites for iron manu facture at Raniganj, there is, in the first place, an enormous amount of coal. Mr. Hughes says that there is perhaps no area of similar size in the whole world which can compare with the Raniganj field for actual thickness of the seams. The weak point of Indian coal is the amount of ash, but better may be discovered as the field becomes progressively developed. The average per-centage of ash is 15, but quite lately specimens have been found with only 8 \u2022 9 and 8 \u25a0 7 per cent, of ash respectively. The deposits of Raniganj iron ore are of two distinct geological ages, the older associated with the coal measures, while the more recent are connected with the rock known as laterite. Laterite as a rale is not rich in iron, but the ironstones of the coal measures, which are valuable ores, occur over an area of several square miles in thin beds, varying in thickness from two to eight inches, about 6,400,000 tons per square mile. The main dependence of any iron works must, therefore, be upon the iron ores of the coal measures. As regards a flux, there is an unlimited supply of kunkwr, containing 70 per cent, of carbonate of lime. The Government have determined to make an attempt to train native geologists. Unfortunately, the expense of this experiment is to be met by curtailing the effective staff of the Survey, while the native students will be a direct incumbrance. There are to be four native apprentices. One joined in March 1873. The rest will follow. They are all from the Lahore College, and their qualifications consist of a moderate knowledge of English and of elementary mathematics. They are first to attend courses of physical science lectures at the Presidency College, and they may hereafter be utilised as fossil collectors. The Records have been published regularly every quarter, and"], [193, "33 GEOLOGICAL PUBLICATIONS. contain numerous interesting papers. Among these are a sketch of the geology of the North-West Provinces ; a map and description of the Bisrampur coal field ; notes on the crystalline rocks of south Mirzapiu- by Mr. Mallet ; a discussion on the geological age of old river valley deposits, in which (in the Narbada valley) Mr. Hacket had found a most symmetrically formed stone implement ; a notice of the Beddanadole coal field by Mr. King ; a sketch of the geology of the Rawal Pindi region by Mr. King, and a description of the brine springs in Pegu by Mr. Theobald.

The first of the systematic publication of the geological maps on the scale of one inch to the mile was made in 1873, by the issue of the twelve sheets of the district of Dumoh. The rest will, as a rule, be issued on a smaller scale. Of the Indian Atlas Sheets, the quarter sheet 78 W. was published during the year, and several of the adjoining sheets are ready for the engraver. VI. The Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India, 1873. The third and fourth volumes of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India,1 containing the reports for the year 1871-72, wrere published at Calcutta in 1873 and 1874. The introduction to the third volume contains a detailed account of General Cunningham's plan for carrying out the survey, with the memorandum of instructions to his assistants. The body of the work includes a report of re searches at various places in the Gangetic valley, from Mathura to Lakhisarai, by Major-General Cunningham in 1871-72, illustrated by 47 plates. The fourth volume contains the reports on Delhi by Mr. Beglar, and on Agra by Mr. Carlleyle. The illustrations consist of inscriptions, copies of sculptures and other architectural details, and maps. 1 Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India.

(Calcutta, 1874)."], [194, "34 DISCOVERIES at bharahut. General Cunningham, and his Assistant Mr. Beglar, explored the greater part of the Central Provinces during the year under review ; 1 the General taking the western, and Mr. Beglar the eastern half. At Jabalpur they examined together the old temple at Bhera Ghat, overhanging the marble rocks. General Cunningham says that the circular colonnade which surrounds the temple, with its long line of female statues, all of life size, is one of the most curious and perfect specimens of Hindu architecture he has yet met with. The temple is dedicated to Siva, but the discovery of a small statue, with the Buddhist creed inscribed on the pedestal, leads to the conclusion that this circular colonnade once enclosed a Buddhist stupa. General Cunningham assigns the establishment of the Siva temple, on the rains of Buddhism, to the 9th or 10th century. To the north of Jabalpur several temples were explored, and good copies were obtained of the Asoka inscription on the rock at Rupnath. To the west of Jabalpur the decayed city of Burhanpur was examined, and plans made of the Jami and Bibi Masjids, the former being one of the finest Muhammadan buildings in India. It contains a record of Akbar, mentioning his conquest of Khandes and the Dakhin (Deccan). From Asighar a second similar record of Akbar was obtained, with an inscription of his son Daniyal, and others of Shah Jahan and Aurangzib. To the south the Buddhist caves and Brahmanical temples at Bhandak were explored, and the colossal sculptures at Lalpet, outside the walls of Chanda were visited. Thence General Cunningham proceeded to the famous group of temples at Markanda, on the Wen-ganga river. On the northern frontier of the Central Provinces he visited an old temple dedicated to Saraswati, in the small state of Myhere. It is on the top of a lofty conical bill. But the most interesting remains are at Bharahut, six miles to the north-east of Uchahara, nine miles to the south-east of the Sutna railway station, and 120 miles to the south-west of Allahabad. In om maps the place is called Bharaod, and General Cunningham believes that it may be identified with the Bardaotis of Ptolemy. It is the site of an old city, which only 60 years ago was covered with a dense jungle. In the midst of this jungle stood a large brick stupa, 68 feet in diameter, surrounded by a stone railing, 88 feet in diameter and 9 feet in height. The whole of the stupa has been carried away to build the houses of the present village ; but 1 See Abstract for 1871-72, p. 29."], [195, "BUDDHIST REMAINS AT BHARAHUT. 35 rather more than half of the stone railing still remains, although it has been prostrated by the weight of the rubbish thrown against it when the stupa was excavated. When General Cunningham first saw the place only three of the railing pillars near the eastern gate were visible above the ground, but a shallow excavation soon brought to light some pillars of the south gate, from which he obtained the measurement of one quadrant of the circle. He was thus able to determine the diameter of the enclosure, the whole of which was afterwards excavated partly by himself and partly by his assistant, Mr. Beglar. In many places the accumulation of rubbish rose to 8 feet in height, and as the stone pillars were lying flat underneath this heap, the amount of excavation was necessarily rather great ; but the whole work did not occupy more than six weeks, and all that now exists of this fine railing is now exposed to view. This colonnade of the Bharahut stupa is of the same age and style as that of the great Sanchi stupa near Bhilsa. But the Sanchi railing is quite plain, while the Bharahut railing is profusely sculptured \u2014 every pillar and every rail as well as the whole coping being sculptured on both faces, with an inscription on nearly every stone. From the characters of these inscriptions, as in the similar case of the Sanchi stupa, the erection of the railing must be assigned to the age of Asoka, or about B.C. 250. The inscriptions are mostly records of the gifts of pillars and rails Hke those of the Sanchi and other stupas. But there is also a considerable number of descriptive records or placards, placed cither above or below many of the sculptures. These last are extremely valuable, as they will enable arch\u00e6ologists to identify nearly all the principal figures and scenes that are represented in these ancient bas-reliefs. Amongst the numerous sculptures at Bharahut there are no naked figures as at Sanchi and at Mathura, but are all well clad, and especially the women, whose heads are generally covered with richly figured cloths, which may be either muslins, or perhaps brocades or shawls. Most of the figures, both male and female, arc also profusely adorned with gold and jewelled ornaments, in many of which one of the most significant Buddhist symbols plays a prominent part. The earrings are mostly of one curious massive pattern, which is common to both men and women. The ankus, or elephant goad, was also a favourite ornament, which is placed at intervals in the long necklaces of ladies."], [196, "36 BUDDHIST REMAINS AT BHARAHUT. At each of the four entrances the corner pillars bore statues, each 4-| feet in height of Yakshas and Yakshinis and of Naga Bag as, to whom the guardianship of the gates was entrusted. Thus at the northern gate there are two male figures and one female, which are respectively labelled Ajakdlaka Yakho, Kupiro Yakho, and Chadd Yakhi, that is, the Yakshas named Ajakdlaka and Ktipira, and the Yakshini Chandd. Other Yakshas are named Suviloma, Viradaka, and Gangito, and a second Yakshini is labelled Yakhini Sudasana. On two other pillars there are male figures, each wdth a hood canopy of five snakes' head, and each labelled Naga Baja. These have then* arms crossed upon their breasts in an attitude of devotion appropriate to their appearance on a Buddhist building. On two middle pillars there are two female statues, respectively labelled Chukaloka Bevatd and Sairimd Devatd, whom General Cunningham takes to be goddesses. Amongst the scenes represented there are upwards of a dozen of the Buddhist legends called Jdtakas, all of which relate to the former births of Buddha. Luckily these also have then* appropriate inscriptions, or descriptive labels, without which their identification would hardly have been possible. Amongst these Jdtakas are the following : \u2014 (1.) Hansa Jataka, or \" Goose-birth,\" of which the only portion now remaining below the inscription is the expanded tail of a peacock, which must therefore have played some part in the story. (2.) Kinara Jataka. \u2014 The Kinaras were a kind of demi-gods. Here two of them, male and female, are represented, with human heads and clad in leaves, standing before some human personage who is seated. The assignment of horses' heads to the Kinaras must therefore belong to a later date. (3.) Miga Jataka, or the wrell-known legend of the \" Deer,\" in Sanskrit Mriga. General Cunningham calls it a deer and not an antelope, as is generally understood, because all the animals in this bas-relief are represented with antlers. The King of Kasi is seen aiming an arrow at the King of the Deer (Buddha). (1.) Magha Deviya Jdtakam, or \" Magha Devi-birth.\" General Cunningham knows nothing of this story. (5.) Yava Majhakiyam Jdtakam. \u2014 This title means literally the \" mean or average amount of food,\" which was attained by daily increasing the quantity with the waxing moon and decreasing it with the waning moon. The bas-relief shows a king seated with"], [197, "BUDDHIST REMAINS AT BHARAHUT. 37 baskets of grain (?) before him, each bearing a stamp or medallion of a human head. To the left some men are bringing other baskets. Barley {yava) would appear to have been the principal food in those days. (6.) Bhisaharaniya Jataka. \u2014 A rishi (or sage) is seated in front of his hut, with a man and woman standing before him, and a monkey seated on the ground, who is energetically addressing the sage. (7.) Latmoa- Jdtakam. \u2014 The \" La twa-bird-birth.\" \u2014This legend apparently refers to some story of a bh-d and an elephant, of which General Cunningham heard a curious version in Kashmir in 1839. In the bas-relief there is a bee stinging the eye, and a bird pecking the head of an elephant, with a frog croaking close by, while the elephant is treading on a nest of young birds. To the right the same (or a similar) bird is sitting on the branch of a tree over an elephant who is running away with his tail between his legs. Near the top the hind half of an elephant is seen rushing down some rocks. In the Kashmiri version an elephant while feeding throws down a nest of young birds into a stream, where they are all drowned. The parent bud seeks the aid of the bees and mosquitoes, who attack the elephant with their stings, and having half blinded him he rushes off towards the stream, and plunging headlong down the rocks is drowned. The fable seems intended to show the power of combination. There can be no doubt that the two legends are substantially the same : and it seems probable that other Buddhist Jdtakas, still preserved in modern legends after the lapse of more than 2000 years may be found. Perhaps this particular legend may be found in the Pancha Tantra. (8.) Vitura ptmakaya Jdtakam. Vitura may perhaps be a mistake for Vithura, \"a thief.\" Of illustrations of the life of Buddha during his last appearance there are some good examples. The earliest of these is a medallion containing Maya's dream of the white elephant, which is superscribed Bhagavato Vkdanti. A second scene belongs to the reign of As ata Satru, King of Magadha, in the eighth year of whose reign Buddha attained Nirvana. This is labelled. Ajdtasata Bhagavato vandate. \u2014 Some of the well-known assem blies of the Buddhists would also appear to be represented, of which one is called the 'Jatila Sabha. A second probably belongs to a later period of Buddhist history, about midway between the death"], [198, "38 BUDDHIST REMAINS AT BHARAHUT. of Buddha and the reign of Asoka. This sculpture represents a large assembly and is duly labelled. Sudhamma Beva Sabha Bhagavato Chudd Mahd. \u2014 The words Beva Sabha probably mean the assembly or synod which was pre sided over by the famous Buddhist priest Revato just 100 years after the death of Buddha, or in B.C. 378. But the Bharahut sculptures are not confined to the legends and events connected with the career of Buddha, as there is at least one bas-relief which illustrates a famous scene in the life of Rama. In this sculpture there are only three figures, of wdiich one seated to the left is holding out an arrow towards a male and female who stand before him \u2014 the latter being behind the other. These figures are labelled respectively Bdma (the rest lost, but most probably Chandra), Janaka Raja and Sitala Devi. General Cunningham believes that this is by far the earliest notice that we possess of the great solar hero Rama and his wife. General Cunningham looks upon the discovery of these curious sculptures as one of the most valuable acquisitions that has yet been made to our knowledge of ancient India. From them can be learnt what was the dress of all classes of the people of India during the reign of Asoka, or about three-quarters of a century after the death of Alexander the Great. We can see the Queen of India decked out in all her finery, with a flowered shawl or muslin sheet over her head, with massive earrings and elaborate necklaces, and a petticoat reaching to the midleg, which is secured round the waist by a zone of seven strings, as well as by a broad and highly orna mented belt. Here wre can see the soldier with short curly hair, clad in a long jacket, or tunic, which is tied at the waist, and a dhoti reaching below the knees, with long boots, ornamented with a tassel in front, just like Hessians, and armed with a straight broad sword, of which the scabbard is three inches wide. Here also we may sec the standard-bearer on horseback, with a human-headed bird surmounting the pole. Here, too, we can see the king mounted on an elephant, escorting a casket of relics. The curious horse-trappings and elephant-housings of the time are given with full and elaborate detail. Everywhere we may see the peculiar Buddhist symbol which crowns the great stupa at Sanchi used as a favourite ornament. It forms the drop of an earring, the clasp of a necklace, the support"], [199, "BUDDHIST REMAINS AT BHARAHUT. 39 of a lamp, the crest of the royal standard, and the decoration of the lady's broad belt and of the soldier's scabbard. There are also houses of many kinds, and several temples, one of which is labelled Vijayata pdsdde, or the \" Temple of Victory.\" There are animals of several kinds, as elephants, horses, deer, cows, and monkeys, and a single specimen of a real tapir. There are numerous crocodiles and fishes, and in one sculpture there is a very large fish, which is represented swallowing two boat-loads of men. There is also a great variety of flowers, and several kinds of fruits, amongst which the mangoe is very happily treated. But perhaps the most curious of the Bharahut sculptures are a few scenes of broad humour, with elephants and monkeys as the only characters. In two of these an elephant has been captured by a band of monkeys, who have fastened a billet of wood along the inside of his trunk so as to prevent him from moving it. Ropes are fastened to his neck and body, the ends of wlaich are pulled by monkeys, who are walking and dancing in triumphal procession to the sound of shells and cymbals played by other monkeys. The spirit of these scenes is very droll. A third scene represents the monkeys holding a giant by the nose with a pair of pincers, to which is fastened a rope dragged by an elephant. The action and attitudes of the monkeys are very good. The intention of all these designs is exceedingly spirited, but the execution is coarse and weak. In the short inscriptions on the railing of the Bharahut stupa, General Cunningham found the names of the following jdaces : \u2014 Sugana, or Srughna ; Vedisa, or Bhilsa ; Fdtalipnta, or Patna ; Kosdmbi, or Kosam ; Nandinagarika, or Nander ; and Ndsika, or Nasik ; besides a number of unknown places, of which Asitamasd is most probably some town on the river Tamasd or Tamas, the Tons of our maps. From these inscriptions also General Cunningham has learned the names of several parts of the Buddhist gateways and railings, one of which is a new word, or at least a new form of word, not to be found in the dictionaries. On the top of LdlPahdr, or the \" Red Hill,\" which overhangs Bharahut, he obtained a rock inscription of one of the great Kala churi Rajas, Nara Sinha Deva, dated in Samvat (Sake) 909. Altogether General Cunningham and Mr. Beglar have collected about 20 inscriptions of the Kalachuris, who took the titles of Chedindra and Chedinarendra, or \" Lord of Chedi,\" and called the era which they used the Chedi Samvat and the Kalachuri Samvat."], [200, "40 BOMBAY ARCH\u00c6OLOGICAL SURVEY. They have also got an inscription of the great Chalukya Raja Tribhuvana Malla, who began to reign in A.D. 1076, and reigned fifty-one years. The inscription is dated in Sake 1008, or A.D. 10S6, and the place of its discovery, Sitabala confirms the account of his having conducted an expedition across the Narbada. In order to carry into effect the proposals made by the Secretary of State for India in a despatch of the 11th October 1871, with a view to the production of a complete survey of the Rock Cut Temples of Western India, the Government of Bombay, in July 1873, submitted a scheme for the survey of the arch\u00e6ological remains in Western India, suggesting the employment of Mr. J. Burgess to conduct the survey. The Government of India in sanctioning this scheme, how ever, introduced a clause limiting the area of research to the Bombay Presidency, and restricting the expenditure to such an amount as to allow only Rs. 3,000 for establishment, photography, scaffolding, &c. per annum. Mr. Burgess returned to Bombay in January 1874, and, with one School of Art student and an assistant, he started on the 24th January for Vingorla en route for Belgam, where he began work on 2nd February. In the Fort at Belgam are three old Jaina temples, built about the year 1200, A.D. One of them has been repaired, and, with additions built around it, is now used as quarters for the families of married soldiers. A portion of a second has been pulled down to make way for a road ; and the third is enclosed in the commissariat premises. There must have been other temples also about the place, for many of the gateposts to compounds both inside the fort and outside, are pillars from old temples. Sculptured stones are also occasionally turned up, which seem deserving of preservation in a local museum could such be provided. The district around is sufficiently rich in old sculptures, inscriptions, &c. to stock a small museum in a short time. Plans of both the ruined temples, drawings of columns and details, and photographic views, and photographs of the inner door and of the finely carved porphyry dome of the larger temple were obtained. An inscription removed from one of these temples many years ago, and now in the Bombay Asiatic Society's Museum, says it'was built by Lakshmi-Bhupati, the son of Kartavirya, the son of Sena Eaja of Venigrama (Belgam), and dedicated to. Santinath, the 16th Tirthankara or Jaina pontiff in S'aka 1127 (A.D. 1205). In the fort are several Persian inscriptions, one of them to the north of the main gate is translated : \u2014"], [201, "RESEARCHES OF MR. BURGESS. 41 \" Ya'qub 'Ali Khan, who is a joy to the heart, and by whose \" benevolence the world is prosperous, built the wall of the fort \" which has a strong foundation, like the wall of Alexander.\" The date in the chronogram is A.H. 937, or A.D. 1530. Another in the south-east of the fort has been forwarded to Professor Bloch mann, of Calcutta, who thus translates it : \u2014 \" O Opener !

Written by Abdul Azaz.\" Copies of other two were also taken, but have not yet been deciphered. On 7th February the work at Belgam was closed, and on Monday, the 9th, Mr. Burgess visited Ankalgi Monastery, and proceeded thence by Gokak to Konur. Time did not admit of copies being made of the inscriptions there, but a photograph was taken of a fragment of an old temple, and others of the best of the remaining dolmens in the neighbourhood of the village \u2014 great numbers of which have been destroyed by \"wadaris,\" or wandering stone cutters. The fine old temple at the Falls was also surveyed and photographed. In this temple is an inscription in very old cha racters, but partly illegible ; this was also photographed. Some very old ruins also exist here on the north bank of the Ghatprabha, but they are so overgrown with prickly pear that, to permit a careful examination they would require to be cleared, for which there was no funds at the command of the survey. Hukeri was next visited, but the Muhammadan remains there did not seem of such interest as to be deserving of the time neces sary to plan and photograph them. Returning by Belgam, Kadaroli on the Malaprabha was next visited, where are two or more inscriptions on stone slabs. The best of these was photographed, and proves to be a grant \" of S'ri - Prithvivallabha Maharajadhiraja - paramesvara - parania \" bhattaraka-srimad Bhuvanaika Malladeva, the ornament of the \" race of Satyasraya.\" \" Dated on a full moon day at the summer \" soltice in S'aka 997 (A.D. 1075), the year Rakshasa, on a Sunday \" in the month Pushya.\" The language is Canarese.

The inscription, however, proved to be only three verses from the Qoran, viz.. stirah LXI. 13, XII. 61, and VI. 161. Next day the old temple, probably a S'aiva one, at Bail Hangal, was surveyed and photographed, but time did not admit of the two long inscriptions here being copied. Saundati was next visited, and one of the two inscriptions here was photographed, but has not yet been read. The same evening the party started for Yellama, a shrine built in the rocky bed of the Sarasvati, a small stream flowing eastwards among the hills east of Saundati. The temple has been rebuilt and repaired in recent times, and is one of the most famous places of pilgrimage in the Canarese country. Another march brought the party to Huli, wliere are numerous remains of old temples, dating probably from the 10th to the 13th century. There are also several inscriptions, but the expedition had not the time to spare to copy them, and the want of a qualified pandit prevented the possibility of making a selection of the oldest or most interesting. The great temple of Panchalinga now used by the Lingayats was found to have been originally a Jaina Basti, \u2014 the Jinas having been hewn off the lintels of all the doors except that to the shrine in the south end of the inner hall. This temple is supposed by Mr. Burgess to date from about the year 1100, A.D. A plan and photographs of it were taken, as also of some others close by. But some expenditure to clear away the prickly pear and make some slight excavations was necessary to make a satisfactory examination of the more promising remains here, and for this there was no provision. On 2nd March the temples of Panchalinga Deva at Manauli were examined, but the villagers objected to the oldest temple being entered. Three photographs, one of them of an inscription, were taken here. From Manauli two marches were made to Badanii in the Kaladgi Zilla. On the south of the town is a rocky hill, facing the fort, which is north of it, and in its north-west face are four caves, three of them Brahmanical and one Jaina. These caves had been often incidentally noticed, and Dr. J. Bird, who had visited them, de voted a section in his Historical Researches to their description, and tried to prove that they belonged to the 10th century, A.D., but even from his account it is impossible to make out whether they were S'aiva or Vaishnava, \u2014 the Jaina cave seems to have entirely escaped bis notice. To examine these caves more thoroughly, and if possible"], [203, "RESEARCHES OF MR. BURGESS. 43 fix their age, was a principal object of this tour. They stand, as to arrangement of parts, between the Buddhist Viharas and the later Brahmanical caves at Elora, Elephanta, and Jogesvara in Salsette, and, hence, must be placed before the 8th century. Cave I. contains the linga in the shrine, and in various parts of the cave arc figures of S'iva, Ganpati, Kartikeya, Mahisasuri, Arddhanari, and Harihara, with S'esha and other figures specially S'aiva ; hence it may with safety be relegated to that sect. The style of the cave, too, would indicate that it is probably the oldest here, and may be attributed to the end of the 5th century. In Cave IL, though there is also a cell with the chavaranga or altar for the linga, the sculptures are so distinctively Vaishnava as to show that it originally belonged to that sect. Though rich in sculpture, much of it well deserving of being moulded, neither of these caves have any inscription. The second is probably the later of the two, but not by more than half a century. The third cave is by far the largest and finest of the series., and in some respects one of the most interesting Brahmanical remains in India. It measures about 70 feet by 48, and is approached through a large square court in front of it, which is entered by a door on the west side. On the wall to the right of this door is an inscrip tion in characters of about the 6th century, and there are other inscriptions, mostly very short ones, on the rock near the cave. At each end of the front of the cave is a gigantic figure, that on the east Vishnu armed, but at rest, the other the same deva in conflict with an enemy. At the ends of the Veranda are gigantic forms, 11 feet high, of Vishnu on Ananta or S'esha and Narisinha, and on the back wall of the verandah are equally large figures of Varaha and Harihara. The roof of the verandah is also elaborately carved, and has all been painted. The six columns of the verandah have each brackets on the sides and inwards to the ceiling, carved with pans of figures or with a single female and attendant dwarf. On a pilaster beside the figure of Varaha is an inscription in 24 lines, \u2014 letters of it scarcely legible, \u2014 which was copied with much difficulty, by means of estampages ; and from these Professor Egge ling has been able to read it. It records that S'ri Mangalisvara, \u2014 \" of the Chalkya (for Chalnkya) race, worshippers of Vishnu, of the \" Manavyagotra, sons of Hariti, \u2014 in the 12th year of (his ?) reign, in \" the year S'aka 500 {i.e. 578 A.D.), built a house of the great Vishnu, \" surpassing all things divine and human, constructed by wonderful \" labour, and beautiful with its enclosing boundaries, and granted the 00057.) D"], [204, "44 RESEARCHES OF MR. BURGESS. \" revenues of a village for making daily offerings to Narayana and \" for giving charitable relief to 16 Brahmans and to mendicants.\" This grant, he adds, \" is made to increase the religious merit of my \" eldest brother Kirttivarman.\" This remarkable inscription, besides settling the date of the cave at three and a half centimes older than Dr. Bird would have led us to believe, helps greatly to clear up what had already been inferred from other inscriptions, that Mangalisa practically ruled the country in the name of his elder brother Kirttivarman. The style of these caves too is so closely connected with that of several old temples at Badami and many more at Pattadkal and Aiwalli, that even in the absence of inscriptions we can be at little loss to assign them approximately to the age in which they were built. But inscriptions are always of the highest importance as confirmative or corrective of dates theoretically assigned. There are inscriptions in a much more modern character on two pillars in the cave, from one of which Dr. Bird read, \" Ndkula hala \" navakdla mritana ghaya, 1176,\" \u2014 (the figures are 1436), which he made out to mean \"the new date of Hala Hala or Buddha,\" and to date from B.C. 543 ! Good \" estampages \" of these inscriptions have been brought home. A complete delineation of the Badami Caves, with a few casts would form a valuable illustration of Hindu art and Vaishnava mythology, only to be rivalled by what Ajanta affords of Buddhism. Cave IV. is a Jaina Cave, dedicated to Mahavira, and with a large figure of Parsvanath in the one end of the verandah, and another jina, perhaps Mahavira, both nude, in the other. Scores of figures of jinas are also carved in different parts of the cave. It perhaps belongs to the 7th or 8th century, A.D. On the north side of the talao or lake at Badami, and on the fort rock are several old temples, built with very massive square pillars, and belong to about the same age as the caves. There are also others of more modern date. Banasankari and Alaitirtha were both visited, but there was not time for any very detailed examination, and the season being now weU advanced and the heat very intense, the party moved on to Pattadkal on the Malaprabha. The number of old temples still remaining here, and still more the number that must have been pulled down over an area extending considerably to the north of the village, are evidences that in ancient times Pattadkal must have been a place of no small repute. Only the great temple is now used"], [205, "RESEARCHES OF MR. BURGESS. 45 for worship, all the others, including the curious old temple of Papnath, \u2014 with scenes from the Bdmdyana on the outsides of its walls, all labelled, like the sculptures on the Bharahut tope, \u2014 are occupied by the villagers as sheds for their cattle, to cook in, &c, and some have been used as quarries from which to obtain building materials. Plans and other drawings were made of the more im portant ; several inscriptions were also copied, but have not yet been deciphered. The temples may be approximately ranged from the 5th to the 10th century, those of the northern or Bengal style being the more recent, for it is curious that here, as at Bhavanesvar, the Bengal and Dravidian styles are found side by side. On 13th April, the examination of the remains at Aiwalli was begun. Here is a Jaina cave, hitherto undescribed, but evidently of the same age as that at Badami, and like it of the Digambara, or naked sect, worshippers of Mahavira Svami. Parsvanatha, with the seven-headed snake overshadowing him, figures at one end of the verandah, and Mahavira (?) at the other, whilst a chapel has three of its sides filled with figures, of which the last tirthankar is the centre. This is quite a counterpart of a similar chamber in a Brahmanical cave not far from this one, \u2014 also hitherto unnoticed \u2014 in which S'iva forms the central figure. This second cave at Aiwalli apparently belongs to about the same age as Cave I. at Badami ; the sculptures are much the same, but the arrangements are very different. On the hill above the Jaina Cave are numerous dolmens of large size, most of them wanting the stone at the end with a round hole in it, which seems to have served as the entrance. The temple on the north-east wall of the village, locally known as the Durga, and hitherto described by the few persons who had seen it as a S'aiva temple, was intended to be a subject of special examination. It wras supposed to be the locale of an inscription, dated 584 A.D. ; and from its terminating in an apse at the back, and its general plan, so far as that could be made out from photo graphs, it was expected that its interior arrangements would throw so much light on the subject of cave architecture, that few temples in India would more fully repay a careful smvey and detailed illus tration. Unfortunately the heat was intense at Aiwalli in April, and the frequent heavy thunderstorms that occur at that season in the Canarese districts put a sudden stop to the work. A plan, however, was made of the temple ; the inscription of Pulakesi II. d2"], [206, "46 METEOROLOGY. (A.D. 584) was not found to belong to it ; but another inscription was found beginning, Svasti, Vikramdditya Satyds'raya, 8sC Now as Vikramaditya died in A.D. 680, this gives us the date of its con struction within a very few years, and confirms the date which theoretical considerations wordd lead us to attribute it to. The temple, moreover, has not been built for S'aiva worship, but for Vaishnava, to which the early Chalukya princes of the Dekhan were attached, the plan is unique and almost suggests a copy from a Buddhist Chaitya cave. The Marathas of a century or two ago piled up a ramp of loose stones on the roof and round the spire, and the roof has fallen in filling the interior with debris ; if this were cleared out, the temple might be used as a place in which to store inscriptions and sculptures, which are very numerous here. In the village a considerable number of fine old temples have been appropriated as dwellings, cowsheds, &c, and very many others of great age have been destroyed or ruined for sake of the large stones they yield for building purposes. To the south-west of the village, and at some distance from it, is a large collection of ruined or deserted temples, mostly small, which it would take a volume to illustrate fully. It was impossible, however, to remain longer out, and Mr. Burgess's party left Aiwalli on the 17th April, and reached Bombay on the 27th, bringing 54 photographs, between 25 and 30 inscriptions, about 40 ground plans, sections, drawings of columns, &c, and 10 sketches of sculptures. A portion of these will be prepared for publication and submitted to Government, with a report of the season's operations. VII. Meteorological and Tidal Observations in India, 1873. The question of the organisation of a Meteorological Department in India is still under consideration ; the despatch from the Secretary of State on the subject, dated the 18th of May 1871, and enclosing the report of the committee of the Royal Society, not having yet been answered. They have, however, together with some further correspondence, been presented to Parliament on the motion of Mr. Egerton Hubbard. In Bengal the same system of meteorological registration as has been described in previous abstracts, was carried on during 1873 ; and Mr. Blanford received the monthly abstracts of results from"], [207, "47 METE0R0L0GV. the North-West and Central Provinces, but not from other parts of India. Such obstacles to work must always be expected so long as there is an independent system of registration in each pro vince. This absence of central control is noticed and deplored, not only in India and in England, but in other countries ; and it has been especially the subject of remark in the Zeitschrift of the Mete orological Society of Vienna. In the North-West Provinces there were 14 meteorological stations, under the direction of Dr. Murray Thomson, who prepared the annual report ; and twelve in the Punjab. In Bombay the Kolaba observatory is most efficiently directed with valuable results by Mr. Chambers; and there are four other meteorological stations the observations taken at which are sent to England, where no particular use has hitherto been made of them. The system in the Madras Presidency has been described in a former abstract. It is under Mr. Pogson, the astronomer. There is one excellent private observatory at Viza gaptam in Daba gardens, belonging to Mr. G. V. Juggarow ; which is superintended by Mr. A. V. Nursingrow. The monthly results are published annually, and Mr. Blanford speaks highly of them. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of placing Indian meteorology on an efficient footing, when it is considered how absolutely the crops and with them the very existence of the people depend upon the regularity or otherwise of the winds and rains, and on an intelligent comprehension, based on long series of obser vations taken over a vast area, of the laws which govern them. There is no hope, however, that any advance can be made until a central office has been established to receive, reduce, and draw conclusions from careful observations taken over the whole area of India. Meanwhile the most valuable meteorological work of the year has been Mr. Blanford' s paper on the winds of Northern India in relation to the temperature and vapour-constituent of the atmo sphere. Its object is to describe the normal wind currents of Northern India and their annual variation, and to trace out their origin and causes so far as these can be discovered in the local physical changes of the atmosphere. Mr. Blanford describes the winds of the principal geographical regions of North India in detail, commencing with the Punjab. In this part of the area under discussion the currents from the westward predominate as a rule throughout the year. In the most northern part of the Punjab westerly winds prevail in the cold and hot dry months, easterly in"], [208, "48 WINDS OF NORTHERN INDIA. the rainy months. In the central districts northerly winds pre dominate over southerly, having in the cold months a westerly tendency, but drawing round to the north-east as the hot weather comes on, while as the rainy season sets in the winds tend to east and south-east, returning to west after the rain ceases in September. In the southern part of the Punjab and Sind easterly winds never prevail, and southerly, south-westerly, and north-westerly winds predominate \u2014 the two former in the rainy months, the last in the cold and hot dry season. In the coldest months the winds veer towards the north. The Gangetic plain, sloping from an elevation above the sea of 900 feet eastward to 150, is skirted on its northern edge by the chain of the Himalaya, which determines in a great measure the direction of its prevailing winds. Those from the north-west and south-east much exceed those from other quarters. The change from the westerly to the easterly direction accompanies the change from the hot and dry season to the rains, and from easterly to westerly that from the rains to the cold season. The plateau of Rajputana is somewhat elevated above the Gangetic plain, varying from 800 to 1,800 feet above the sea level. Winds from west and south-west greatly exceed those from other quarters in the southern districts, commencing as early as February and continuing till November, when they are replaced by northerly and north-easterly winds. There is a similarity to the winds of the southern Punjab. The Central India region is considerably broken up into valley and mountain, so that the winds are more influenced by merely local conditions than in the more northern areas. Westerly winds on the whole prevail. Central India participates in the characteristics both of the plains of Northern India and of the Peninsula, which last is under the influence of the true south west and north-east monsoons. In the Gangetic Delta the winter monsoon becomes well established in November, blowing from the north. As the season advances the wind draws round towards the west, and eventually backs by south-west to south and south-east, in which direction it blows during the rainy season and till Sep tember. In October the winds are chiefly easterly, but unsteady and inchned to be stormy. The local configuration of the Assam valley, forming an open passage for the monsoons to pass to and from the region north of the Himalaya, affects its winds. On the whole the characteristic of Assam is the prevalence- of easterly winds, which is here as conspicuous as that of the westerly winds over the Gangetic plain and Punjab."], [209, "WINDS OF NORTHERN INDIA. 49 It will be seen that the winds of Northern India are very different from those of the adjacent seas. Instead of two monsoons from the north-east and south-west alternately prevailing during about equal periods of the year, there are three distinct seasons in which special winds prevail, the directions of which mainly depend on the relative positions and directions of the mountain ranges and plains. During the cold weather months, November to January, light westerly and northerly winds blow from the plains of Upper India down the valleys of the Ganges and Indus, and across the table-land of Central India, and join into the north-east monsoon of the Punjab. The easterly winds of the Assam valley add to this current. In April and May, as the hot weather comes on, the winds of Northern India become more westerly and powerful, and take the form of the hot winds, blowing till sunset, and then being followed by calms. At the same time southerly winds are commencing on the coast, and are felt from Sind across to Bengal, but only at intervals and feebly, except near the sea. In June the south-west monsoon, being established in the equatorial ocean, sets in round both coasts of the peninsula, penetrates up the valleys of the Indus, Narbada, and Tapti, carrying a west or south-west current over Central India, and from the bay of Bengal pouring up the funnel-shaped openings occupied by the Ganges delta, whence, turning westward, it passes up the Gangetic valley towards the Punjab, which seems to be the limit of the south-easterly winds. This is the period of the rainy season in Northern India. In October, as the south-east monsoon ceases, the southerly current is recurved towards the heated region along the Coromandel coast, and blowing as a south-east wind, causes the autumn rains, which some writers have erroneously attributed to the north-east monsoon. The seasons of Northern India present three distinct phases : the cold season, from the end of the rains in September to March ; the hot season, characterised by a dry atmosphere and great diurnal range of temperature ; and the rainy season, in which the tempera ture is moderately high and equable, and the air humid. At the close of the rains, in the end of September, the temperature of Northern India, from the Punjab to the sea, is nearly uniform, at about 81\u00b0' or 82\u00b0: But evaporation and radiation to a cloudless sky soon reduce the temperature of the interior below that of the maritime regions, and in January the Punjab is about 11\u00b0 colder than Bengal, the plains of the North-West Provinces being about midway in temperature between the two. In March the advance"], [210, "50 WINDS OF NORTHERN INDIA. of temperature in Central India has brought out two thermal foci, one on the west in Rajputana, and the other on the east, in the hilly tracts of Western Bengal. In April the Central Indian thermal focus is well developed. In May the thermal focus has gone further to the north-west, and lies in the northern part of the Rajputana plateau. In June it has reached the Punjab, the tempe rature there rising to 95\u00b0 and more, while that of the south of India begins to fall, consequent on the rains. In July the Punjab ranges above 90\u00b0, while the greater part of Central India is below 85\u00b0. After July the temperature again falls, so that by the end of September it is nearly equalised all over Northern India. Thus in the cold weather there are two foci of minimum tempera ture, one in the Punjab, and the other in Assam, and the isotherms nearly conform to the parallels of latitude. In the hot months a focus of heat is formed in Central India, round which the isotherms are bent, the temperature on the coasts and in the northern plains being considerably lower than that in the interior. Finally, during the rainy season the seat of highest temperature is in the Punjab, the coolest regions then being those of the maximum rainfall, consisting of two tracts extending from the coasts of Bombay and Bengal along the course of the monsoon currents. The available data for discussing the atmospheric pressure are imperfect, but, subject to this explanation, the mean pressure reduced to sea level, in October, is nearly uniform over Bengal, in the Central Provinces, and the Ganges valley. In the following months the pressure rises over the whole area but most in the North-West Provinces and western Bengal, and in December an axis of maximum pressure lies in a fine down from Cuttack to the North-West Provinces in a north-west and south-east direction. The distribution of pressure remains much the same until February. In March a rapid fall takes place in Northern India, but the fine of higher pressure still remains, extending now from north-western India across to the coast of Arabia, round the delta of the Ganges. In April, with a continued rapid fall, a trough of low pressure becomes apparent, which extends from the head of the delta of the Ganges into Central India. In May, this area of low pressure occupies line from western Bengal to Nagpur and in June the con- ditions are generally similar, but with much reduced pressure in the Punjab, in the north-west of which province, the absolute minimum is probably to be found. In July the minimum of pressure is reached without important relative change. In August a rise"], [211, "WINDS OF NORTHERN INDIA. 51 begins, greater over Northern India, which continues during Sep tember and October, when the uniformity of pressure is once more approximately restored. The distribution of pressure follows within certain limits, that of temperature in an inverse ratio of intensity. Mr. Blanford' s conclusion is that these changes of pressure are influenced by the proportion of aqueous vapour in the air, by carrying heat from the lower to the upper strata, and by arresting solar and terrestrial radiation, thus equalising the tem perature of the air column. In general terms be concludes that the changes of temperature are the principal causes of the variations of pressure. There is evidence that anti-monsoon currents blow in the upper strata of the atmosphere, at the various seasons of the year, and at varying elevations, causing corresponding modifications in the general temperature; and Mr. Blanford is inclined to attribute the rains of the cold season to the descent of the anti-monsoon current from the south. This valuable paper indicates the direction which future investigations must take ; and the practical importance of the conclusions to which they will lead. The barometric pressure has a direct influence on the winds, and the winds on the rainfall, and when these elements are thoroughly understood, it is probable that the normal or abnormal character of a year's meteorology may be known as early as April. Mr. Blanford's Meteorological Report for the year 1873 is the seventh that has been submitted since the Department was established in 1867. It is the first which has to treat of a year of disastrous drought and serious failure of crops, leading to a threatened famine in the lower provinces. India is pre-eminently a country in which the systematic study of meteorology promises to be attended with the greatest and most speedy results. The peculiarities which have already been observed, justify the expectation that, when a more complete knowledge has been obtained, a forecast may be made of the seasons, so that their probable character may be known for some months in advance. The most important question is that of the causes which determine the distribution of rainfall and its irregularities ; and Mr. Blanford says, in his report for 1873, \" that it is within the power of science \" to solve this problem, I see no reason to doubt.\" That any progress has already been made is, however, still due to the voluntary association of the meteorological officers of Bengal, the North-west and Central Provinces, and Berar, with a view to the"], [212, "52 free interchange of results, and their unification. But the Punjab registers are untrustworthy and not comparable, and nothing is received from Bombay, Madras,1 or Burma. It is now possible to frame a conception of the general distribution of pressure and tem perature over about half India and its seas. It will not, however, be possible to gain a satisfactory understanding of the meteorology of any part of India, and therefore to derive from the meteorological system the really valuable information which a sound methodical system is capable of affording, until the whole of India and Burma is brought into one nexus, so that the records of all can be studied as a whole. Ceylon and Singapore have long been associated with Bengal. In 1873 there were 18 first-class stations in Bengal, at which the following meteorological elements were observed : \u2014 Atmospheric pressure, temperature of the air, extreme temperatures, temperature of solar evaporation, temperature of grass, nocturnal evaporation, vapour tension, relative humidity, serenity, rainfall, number of days of rainfall, wind, and mean diurnal movement of wind. There are 10 second-class stations, and will shortly be 12, including one at Nancowry in the Nicobar Islands, and 145 third-class stations for observing rainfall. There is at length to be a meteorological obser vatory at Calcutta, Sir George Campbell having secured a suitable piece of ground at Alipore, and provision having been made in the budget for the building and for the self-registering instruments now being constructed in England.2 Self-registering anemometers, giving a simultaneous record of the direction and velocity of the wind, are much needed, to obtain a knowledge of the real movements of the air. The first has lately been set up over the Calcutta Meteo rological Office. The whole cost of the Bengal Meteorological Department is 1,936/. The chief meteorological characteristics of 1873 were excessively high temperature, especially in Oudh and the North-west Province, unusually low pressure in the same region, abnormally high pressure in East Bengal, great unsteadiness in the winds, and a general defi ciency of moisture in the atmosphere. The monsoon cm-rent was, as a whole, either unusually weak or unusually dry, but that portion from the Bay of Bengal failed to a greater extent than that from the Arabian sea. The deficiency in Lower Bengal was as much as See page 38. 2 Since this was in press the allowance of Rupees 25,000 for the Observatory has been struck out of the Budget for 1874-5."], [213, "53 40 per cent. The dryness was probably due to a persistent baro metric pressure in the south-east part of the Bay of Bengal, and to the irregular depression in the upper part of the Gangetic Valley, together with the high pressure in East Bengal. Other causes were, no doubt, in operation, of which we are ignorant. These persistent barometric irregularities exercise a very important influence on the winds. Mr. Blanford divides the fluctuations of atmospheric pressure under five heads, two regular and periodical, and three irregular. The first is the semi-diurnal tides of pressure.1 The second is the great annual variation which, in the plains, has one maximum in December and one niinimum in June or July, the amount of rise or fall varying according to the locality. The thud is the local and temporary variations of short duration, such as accompany local storms. The fourth is general and temporary fluc tuations affecting a large area simultaneously, as a rule, the more intense the higher the latitude. The fifth is the local and persistent variations, which are the most important in relation to irregularities in the monsoon rainfall. What has been brought to light by Mr. Blanford's systematic observations is that the abnormal features of each monsoon are almost as persistent as its normal characteristics. The persistent irregularities in the relative distribution of pressure first became apparent in comparing the distribution of atmospheric pressure of the two rainy seasons of 1868 and 1869, and attention was drawn to the subject in 1870.2 In 1868 there was unduly low pressure at Sagor and False Point, in the north-east corner of the Bay of Bengal, affecting the winds and obstructing their passage up coun try, while causing unusually heavy fall of rain in the south-west corner of the Gangetic Delta, with drought in the region to the north-west. Each subsequent year has confirmed the general truth of the law by which abnormal meteorological conditions have a tendency to be persistent in India. If, therefore, the connexion of these irregularities with those of the rainfall can be once clearly ascertained, it may be possible, even at an early period of the season, in April, to obtain a clue to its probable peculiarities. Durin\u00b0* the year 1873 the distribution of atmospheric pressure differed more widely from that of average years than was the case in 1868. The effect was to weaken the current of wind which 1 See Memoir, p. 214. a Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume XXXIX., page 123."], [214, "54 blows from the Bay of Bengal, and therefore to affect prejudicially the rainfall of the Lower provinces. The winds of the monsoon blow from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal towards a line south of the Ganges, where a baro metric depression begins in April, and is well established by the time the rains set in in June. The pressure decreases along this line from east to west, where the trough, as it may be termed, merges into the great barometric depression of the Desert and the Punjab. To the south of this trough of barometric depression, the winds from the Arabian Sea blow across the central provinces from the westward. To the north of it, those from the Bay of Bengal,, turning with the Gangetic Valley, blow in the opposite direction, their line of meeting being along the trough. In 1873 this trough did not exist. The pressure declined thence to the north, so that the place of lowest barometer lay far to the north-west, in Oude and Rohilkhand, immediately under the Hima layas. Differences of barometric pressure are the causes of winds. A current of air coming from the Bay of Bengal could only reach this barometric depression along its northern margin, and here lay a great physical obstruction in the shape of the Himalaya mountains. Any weakening of the monsoon current implies a deficiency of rain, for all the vapour that is condensed as rain on the uplands and hills of India is brought by this current from the ocean. The persistent barometric depression in Oudh, instead of that which usually appears in summer and autumn as the trough to the south of the Ganges, seems to be intimately connected with the failure of rainfall in Bengal. But whether these ascertained conditions were the principal agents operating to cause the drought of 1873 cannot be known without some knowledge of the state of things pre vailing in the Punjab, Bombay, and Madras. This Mr. Blanford points out is but one of a vast number of most important inquiries which present themselves for solution at the hands of the Indian meteorologist. Tidal Observations in India. In the abstract for 1870-71 an account was given of Colonel Walker's measures, while in England, for organising a plan for the investigation of the law of tides of the Indian Ocean, and of Lieu tenant Baird's wrork in drawing up an account of the method of reducing tidal observations by a harmonic analysis, as conducted"], [215, "TIDAL OBSERVATIONS. 55 by the British Association. The steps were also described, which Colonel Walker took to procure the necessary instruments.1 Lieu tenant Baird made an experimental trial of the performances of the tide gauge at Chatham, the results of which were very satisfactory. On his return to India Colonel Walker deputed Lieutenant Baird to make a reconnaissance of the coasts of the Gulf of Kach, with a view to selecting tidal stations, and more particularly to ascertain in what manner a station could be established at a point as far into the Rann of Kach as possible to which the tide has free access. Lieutenant Baird fitted up a large country boat at Juria Bandar to be used in navigating the creeks and channels of the gulf, and secured the services of a good pilot. He then embarked and crossed to Nowanar Point on the Kach coast, where he found a spot which is well adapted for tidal observations, having a minimum depth of 19 feet of water within 336 feet of a site for a station. He then proceeded eastwards towards the head of the gulf, and discovered a position near Hanstal Point, which is well adapted for a tidal station, having a minimum depth of 72 feet of water within 160 feet of the site of an observatory. Turning westwards along the Kattiwar coast, he finally selected a third station at the entrance of the guff at Okha Point, where he met with a rocky foreshore having a minimum depth of 23 feet of water within 220 feet of a site for a tidal station. Lieutenant Baird derived much assistance in his explorations from the admirable charts which were con structed by Captain A. D. Taylor, I.N., in 1851, copies of which on the full scale of the original survey, had been lithographed for Colonel Walker, through the Geographical Department of the India Office. It was decided to construct the stations on shore at the line of high water. Masonry wells of a diameter of about three feet will be sunk at the stations to a depth of several feet below the lowest tides. In these wells iron cylinders of a diameter slightly exceeding that of the float of the tide gauge will be set up vertically, and eventually connected with the sea by an iron piping carried along the shore down to the low water line, where a flexible piping will be attached and carried into deep water. The cylinders will be closed below by an iron plate, to prevent the entrance of the water which may be expected to percolate through the sides of the well i Abstract for 1870-71, p. 49."], [216, "56 TIDAL OBSERVATIONS. whenever the tide is falling. The flexible piping will terminate in a rose suspended a few feet above the bed of the sea, in order to prevent the entrance of silt as much as possible, and it will be attached to the iron piping in such a manner as that it may be readily removed and cleared whenever necessary. The interior diameter of the piping will be two inches, which has been computed to be sufficient to permit of the transmission of the tidal wave from the sea to the cylinder in the well without sensible retardation, so that the height of the water in the cylinder may be expected to be always the same as that of the surface of the sea. The tide gauges will be set up over the cylinders, and their iron bed plates will indicate the places to which the tidal measurements will be referred, and they will be connected by levelling with permanent bench marks fixed in the ground in the vicinity of the stations. Lieutenant Band was employed during several months at Bombay in making the requisite arrangements. He then proceeded to con struct the stations on the coasts of the Gulf of Kach. Colonel Walker reports that he has worked with great assiduity and skill, and with a hearty interest in the success of these important tidal investigation. VIII. The Madras Observatory, 1872-73. Mr. Pogson, the astronomer in charge of the observatory at Madras, has submitted a report upon the proceedings of that esta blishment up to the end of 1873. Beyond announcements of dis coveries, and the observations necessary to substantiate them, com municated to the Royal Astronomical Society and the Astronomischc Nachrichten, nothing has been published during Mr. Pogson' s term of office, which commenced in 1860.1 He undertook to work on a programme of operations which he now considers to have been unreasonably extensive without assistance ; but he persevered in it, leaving publication to the future, in the full expectation that he would be provided with an efficient European assistant. At last, in August 1870, Mr. Pogson's son was appointed as his assistant, but the sanguine hopes then raised of being enabled to bring out the results so long awaiting publication were disappointed, owing to the illness and untimely death of young Mr. Pogson in July 1873. 1 See Memoir, p. 241."], [217, "57 MADRAS OBSERVATORY. As the heaviest work on hand, namely, the catalogue of stars made with the new meridian circle, is now nearly completed, it is con sidered that, for a time, observations may be almost suspended, and the whole available force of the establishment concentrated on the reduction and publication of the arrears. By adopting this course from the commencement of 1875 the volumes may be brought out in pretty rapid succession, and all arrears cleared off before any fresh undertaking is commenced. When Mr. Pogson took charge of the observatory in February 1861 there was a catalogue of about 2,200 stars, chiefly selected from Taylor's Madras catalogue, and that of the British Association, observed between 1853 and 1858, awaiting completion. The ob servations to be incorporated in this catalogue will be little under 10,000, and much has already been done towards preparing it for the press. There are 1,331 observations of the sun, 345 of the moon, 1,680 of the principal planets, 333 of the minor planets, and 25 of Donati's comet of 1868 ; besides the mean places of the 144 Nau tical Almanack stars from 1853 to 1858 ; observations of Mars at the oppositions of 1854 and 1856 ; of moon culminations for deter mination of longitude ; and a long list of occultations of planets and fixed stars, and of the phenomena of Jupiter's satellites. These form the arrears, and most of them are reduced and ready for the press. They are well worthy of publication, and prove that the predecessor of Mr. Pogson conscientiously exerted himself for the attainment of such results as were within his very limited instru mental means. The hourly meteorological observations from 1851 to 1860 x are still unpublished. Those from 1851 to 1855 are printed and nearly ready for issue. Of the hourly magnetic observations, only the results from 1846 to 1850 have yet been published. Those from 1850 to 1855 are printed and will shortly be distributed. Since Mr. Pogson assumed charge in 1861 he has had several works in progress. A catalogue of about 3,000 stars, observed with the meridian circle, towards which 23,506 observations have already been made, is to be closed with the year 1874. The catalogue con tains a number of southern stars not previously observed elsewhere, chiefly between 110\u00b0 and 150\u00b0 of North Polar distance. Meridional observations have at the same time been made of the moon from 1862 to 1872 ; and of Mars and some of the minor planets.

Discoveries of new planets and variable stars have chiefly resulted from a search regularly maintained over certain very perfect manuscript charts constructed by Mr. Pogson. When Mr. Pogson arrived at Madras in February 1861 he found the observatory in a most distressingly hopeless state of inanition. Nothing had been done during the two previous years, and the only instruments available for work were the equatoreal by Messrs. Lere bours and Secretan, and a small portable transit used for finding the local time. During 1861 Mr. Pogson was engaged in setting up the new transit circle ; and in observations with the equatoreal . The new planet \" Asia,\" so named in consequence of its being the first discovery made in that quarter of the globe, was found early in April 1861, and the observations of it were printed in the monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The solar eclipse of July 7th, 1861, the transit of Mercury on November 11th, and many other observations, were also duly attended to; and the meteorological and magnetical registers, and the local time signals by the telegraphic dropping of a time ball daily at 1 p.m., were carried on throughout the year. The mounting of the new transit circle was completed, and the instrument brought into use on May 31st, 1862. A monthly record of observations made with it, has since been kept. Much work wTas also done with the equatoreal. But 1861 was the best year as regards the general work of the observatory. The maximum number of observations was attained with the transit circle. With the equatoreal the new planet \"Freia\" was independently discovered on the 2nd of February, 1864 ; but it proved to be one detected by Professor D'Arrest at Copenhagen in 1861, which had since been lost owing to the in sufficiency of the observations made at its discovery. Another new planet, called \" Sappho,\" was discovered on the 3rd of May 1864. A second series of differential right ascensions of Mars was also observed, for the investigation of the solar parallax. In 1865 the meridian circle work continued to be all that could be desired. The new large equatoreal, by Messrs. Troughton and Shnms, had been received early in 1864, and a suitable structure was erected for it. From 1866 a more complete form of tabular reports was introduced. The great events of 1866 were the mounting of the new 8*|-inch equatoreal, and the discovery of the new planet"], [219, "59 MADRAS OBSERVATORY. \" Sylvia.\" In 1867 the finding of the variable star R. Reticuli, by C. Ragoonatha Charry in January, is memorable as the first astro nomical discovery achieved by a native of India. In 1868 the total eclipse of the sun on the 18th of August was observed. Actual micrometrical measurements of the positions of bright lines in the solar corona were obtained with the spectroscope at Masulipatam, and the visibility of the red prominences after the sun's reappearance wras confirmed by measures taken half a minute after the end of totality. The polarization of the Hght of the corona was satisfactorily proved by Mr. G. K. Winter, and the observations of the ordinary phenomena of the eclipse were recorded by the late Mr. C. G. Walker, C. S. On the 19th of November 1868, another new planet was discovered, called \" Camilla.\" A third series of measurements of Mars, for investigation of the solar parallax, was made in 1869 with the new equatoreal. In 1870 the firing of the fort gun by an ingenious electrical discharging apparatus was substituted for the dropping of a ball, to give the time. In 1871 a fourth series of observations of Mars was made with the large equatoreal ; and signals were exchanged by the sub marine cable between Madras and Singapore, in July, for the diffe rence of longitude. At the suggestion of Professor Oudemens, the Dutch Surveyor-General in Java, a similar exchange of longitude signals had previously been made between Singapore and Batavia. The central shadow path of another total eclipse of the sun across the Madras presidency, on December 12th, 1871, led to the equip ment of several expeditions to observe it. The station selected for the Government Observatory was at Avenashy, in the Coimbatore district, on the line of railway. The Assistant Astronomer, aided by Colonel Ritherdon and Mr. Doderet, obtained three successful photographic pictures of the totality, showing the corona and other phenomena of the eclipse. Mr. Winter rendered valuable service as polariscopist, and C. Ragoonatha Charry was entrusted with the ordinary telescopic phenomena. The report on this work has not yet been submitted by Mr. Pogson, owing to continued pressure of work. In 1872 the annular eclipse of the sun was observed on the 6th of June ; and the phenomena known as \" reversal of the lines,\" hitherto observed only at total eclipses, was also seen to great advantage with the spectroscope at both the formation and breaking of tbe ring. The observations of Biela's comet, which was last seen 18 years ago and had since been given up as lost, were taken under very extraordinary circumstances. But the observations are stil (10057.) E"], [220, "60 MADRAS OBSERVATORY. were discontinued, and the meridian circle was used exclusively for star places to complete the catalogue in hand. A fifth series of Mars observations was taken in April and May, with the large equatoreal. Mr. Pogson represents that if an experienced European assistant had been granted him in 1863, there would have been no arrears at the present time. Meanwhile he has long had one labour in hand, the vast importance of which cannot well be over-rated ; namely, the investigation of the constant of solar-parallax, by means of the planet Mars in opposition ; which is one method of ascertaining the sun's true distance from the earth. The transit of Venus offers the readiest and most immediate result, but the opportunity of observing it only occurs twice in a century. In 1857, the Astro nomer Royal ** suggested and advocated the method by means of the planet Mars when in opposition, which is equally adapted to secure the same result. The requisite observations for this method can only be made to the best advantage at a tropical observatory, and Madras was particularly named by the Astronomer Royal for the work. Mr. Pogson has now taken five series of opposition observa tions in 1862, 1864, 1869, 1871, and 1873, all of which await discussion. The three last were made with the new equatoreal ; but still without all the proper appliances. Arrangements have been made for the observation of the transit of Venus in India, which have been entrusted to Colonel Tennant. Among the instruments ordered by the Secretary of State, a photo heliograph was sent out to India in June, and a chronograph and three electric clocks in the middle of July; the remaining ap pliances, a six-inch equatoreal telescope and a transit instrument, being still in the hands of the manufacturers, Messrs. Cooke and Sons of York.2 Meanwhile the Government have sanctioned the funds necessary for building an observatory, and Colonel Tennant is proceeding with the arrangement at Rurki. Colonel Walker has been enabled through changes in his Department to make some intruments available, which will partially fill the place of what were ordered from England,' and Colonel Douglas, R.A., has also contributed some timekeepers! Colonel Tennant proposes to observe at Rurki, where he will be assisted by Captain Campbell, R.E., of the G. T. Survey. He has i Monthly Notice, E.A.S., XVII., p. 208-21. 2 The transit instrument has since been shipped."], [221, "MAJOR MONTGOMERIE'S PUNDITS. 61 unreduced and unpublished In 1873 the observations of the moon been authorised to send an officer (probably Captain Strahan, R.E.) as far up into the Panjab as possible to get eye observations of the last contact of Venus and the Sun.

In 1872, one of Major Montgomerie's Pundits made a journey north-eastwards from Shitgatze to the great Namchu Lake, and then southwards to Lassa ; but the account of it has not yet appeared. In 1873, a Pathan was sent to the region beyond the Hindu. Kush range, with instructions to penetrate, if possible, into the terra' incognita, of Shighnan, Roshan, Darwaz, and Karatagin, to the north of the river Oxus. One of the Pundits has been sent into the part of Great Tibet beyond the northern watershed of the Brahmaputra river ; and four are attached to Mr. Forsyth's embassy to Kashgar, in the expectation that they may be able to make then way back to India by various routes which are closed to Europeans. Intelligence had been received of the murder of the Mirza, whose exploration of the route from Badakshan across the Pamir Steppe to Kashgar was described by Major Montgomerie in the report of the Great Trigonometical Survey for 1869-70.1 He had been sent on a second expedition, with his son-in-law as an assistant, to travel through Afghanistan. At first his reports were received pretty regularly, but for several months he was not heard of; and it now seems likely that, after traversing the road from Herat to Maimana, he was murdered with his companion during the night while asleep, by the guides they were employing. A servant is said to have escaped, and to have given information which led to the subsequent execution of the murderers by order of the Governor of Maimana. Endeavours are being made to obtain fuller informa tion respecting the fate of this faithful and intelligent emissary, and to get possession of his papers. Much geographical information is expected from the members of Mr. Forsyth's embassy to Kashgar. Captain Trotter, formerly i See Abstract for 1869-70, p. 26. E 2"], [222, "62 MR. FORSYTH'S MISSION TO KASHGAR. in charge of the Kattiwar Survey, passed some time at Colonel Walker's head-quarters, before starting, in practising astronomical observations, and particularly those for the determination of absolute longitudes. Two other officers attached to the mission, Captain Chapman, R.A., and Captain Biddulph, also spent a short time in practising observations and reductions. A Kashmiri surveyor of the Rajputana survey, and four of the Pundits, were sent with Captain Trotter ; and Colonel Walker has done all in his power to promote the success of the geographical operations of the mission. From Kashgar three members of the mission made an excursion to the Pamir table land, namely, Colonel Gordon, Captain Trotter, and Dr. Stoliczka, the geologist. The results of their journey may be summed up as follows : \u2014 There are two Karakul lakes on the plateau, the drainage from one flowing east, and from the other west. The eastward stream is the Ghiz, which, passing through the Ghiz-Dawan, becomes the Kashgar river. That flowing west joins the stream from the Ghiz lake or Pamir Kul, and forms the Murghab river. It enters Shignan at Bartang, and falls into the Oxus five days journey below Kila Panja, at a place called Vamer. Shignan (Shaghnan) has been ascertained to be perfectly independent, and is ruled over by Yusuf 'Aly Shah, who also owns Roshan and the adjoining Pamir. The territory of Wakhan ex tends up to the junction of the Aktash stream with the stream flowing from Lake Karakul, and contains the great, little, and Alichur Pamirs. The true water-parting betwreen the east and west is the Kizilyart plain, belonging to the Amir of Kashgar. The Shignan Pamir and the Kizilyart plain are inhabited by wandering Kirghiz. The other Pamirs have been abandoned of late years. From Tashkurgan to the small Karakul Lake is one day's march, from the small to the great Karakul five days, and from the great Karakul to Ush is six days' march. The Barojit Pass into Chitral is reported to be extremely easy, and open during the whole year, except about six weeks in March and April. The results of the work done by Sir Frederic Goldsmid, and the officers employed on the Persian Frontier Commission, are about to be published. The narrative of Sir Frederic's earlier travels, with an account of the construction of the telegraph line between India and England, will be found in the handsome work published by Messrs. Macmillan, entitled \" Telegraph and Travel.\" An official work will also be published, comprising an introduction by Sir Frederic Goldsmid, a narrative of the journey from Bandar Abbas,"], [223, "MR. BLANFORD'S WORK IN PERSIA. 63 through Sistan to Mash-had by Major Euan Smith ; geographical memoirs and accounts of their independent journies by Major St. John and Major Lovett ; and the scientific results of Mr. Blanford's visit to Persia. Mr. Blanford's portion of the work will be divided into two parts, zoology and geology. The former, which will be the most volumi nous, will treat of the vertebrate fauna, with the exception of the fishes. In the collections obtained by Mr. Blanford himself, supple mented by a very valuable series of skins previously amassed for the Indian Museum by Major St. John, and placed at Mr. Blanford's disposal for examination, there were altogether rather more than 2,000 specimens (dried or preserved in spirit), representing 32 species of mammalia, 248 birds, 62 reptiles, and 5 amphibia ; and by collating the data given by S. E. Gmelin, Pallas, Menetrics, Eichwald, and other explorers of the shores of the Caspian, together with those furnished by De Filippi and others from various parts of Persia, Mr. Blanford has ascertained that the known fauna of the country combines 87 species of mammals, 380 of birds, 91 of reptiles, and 9 of amphibians, of each of which notes as to localities, and where practicable, structure and habits, will be added. The novelties described, of several of which brief notices have been given in various scientific publications, amount to 10 mammals, 8 birds, 19 reptiles, and 1 amphibian. All of these will be fully described, and, together with a few rare forms described but not figured by previous observers, illustrated by lithographs, many of them coloured, and woodcuts. The whole account will be preceded by some remarks on the general distribution of the Persian fauna, and its relation to that of adjoining regions. The geological portion of the work will consist principally of an account of the rocks observed during Mr. Blanford's journey through Persia. A brief sketch will be given of what is known of the general structure of the country from the explorations of Mr. Loftus and others, but it is considered that so large a part of Persia is as yet unknown, that nothing like a complete description of the geology can be written as yet. A geological map will accompany this portion of the work. During the past year Major St. John has completed a map of Western Baluchistan on the scale of eight statute miles to the inch. It includes the country between the Mekran coast and latitude 28\u00b0 20\", and the 58th and 64th meridians, thus covering the whole of the territory recently regained by Persia and the frontier districts"], [224, "st. John's new map of Persia. 64 which owe allegiance to the Khan of Kalat. With the exception of the coast line, and the route of Captain Grant in 1809, all the ma terial used in the compilation of this map is original. The country on both sides of the Kalat frontier, and all north of the 27th parallel except Panjgur is from Major St. John's own survey in 1872. The country in the vicinity of the roads from Gwadar to Bampur via Kasrkand and Sarbaz ; from Gwadar to Bolida, and thence by both routes to Panjgur is from surveys by Major Lovett, C.S.I., in 1871. The'roads through the Pa-godar pass from Bampur to Sarbaz, and from Kastag to Gwadar, are from surveys made by Lieut-Colonel Ross and Quartermaster-serjeant Bower, R.E., in 1871. Other routes are inserted on the authority of Captain Grant, 1809 ; Sir F. J. Goldsmid, 1862 and 1866 ; Lieut.-Col. Ross, 1865 ; and the same officer and Mr. Sealy, 1867. Appended to the map are sections of the country between the Bampur and the Kharan deserts, and between each of these deserts and the sea. Valuable as have been the results of the labours of the frontier commissions under Sir F. J. Goldsmid in a geographical point of view, much remains to be done before our knowledge of Baluchistan can be considered adequate. Besides the many spaces left blank and marked un explored on Major St. John's map, the geography of that part of the Kalat territory lying between the frontier districts and Colonel Green's surveys, or roughly speaking, between the 64th and 66th meridians, is still unknown, save on the route taken by Lieut.-Col. Ross along the prolongation of the Kej valley in 1865. The map has been carefully executed in lithography by Mr. Trelawny Saunders. Its large scale, eight miles to the inch, neces sitated by the purpose for which it was required, viz., as a basis for the settlement of frontier disputes, seemed to render its publication unadvisable. One hundred copies only have therefore been struck off. All the information contained in it will, however, be available to the public on a smaller scale in Major St. John's general map of Persia. This work is far advanced towards completion, Messrs. Stanford being already engaged on the reproduction of four of the six sheets. The map is based in the first instance on the longitudes of Tehr&n, Bushire, and the towns between them, fixed by means of the tele graph by Major St. John and Captain Pier son in Persia, with the co-operation of Colonel Walker in London and Lieutenant Stiffe in Karachi. A parallel base is afforded by the map of the Turco- Persian frontier survey, of which sheets on a reduced scale are in"], [225, "st.

M. Khanikoff 's work, or rather that of his assistant M. Lenz, gives in addition a chain of points connecting his routes in Khurasan, Sistan, and Karmdn with those of Majors St. John and Lovett from the south. The coast Hues of the Persian Gulf and the Caspian are derived from the most recent Russian and English charts. A description of the amount and sources of detail which Major St. John has been able to fit on the skeleton thus provided had better be deferred till the completion of the map. Suffice it to say, that though, with the exception of the Turco-Persian frontier survey, there is little that is new in the two western sheets, the topography of the country embraced by the other four, i.e. east of the Bush ire-Tehran road, is mainly compiled from authorities whose work, where not entirely new, has never yet appeared in any general map of Persia. While much has thus been added to the information obtainable from existing maps, much that is erroneous and untrustworthy has also been swept away. A system of trans-literation has been introduced, uniform as far as possible under the circumstances. The various languages in which au thorities have recorded their travels, and the impossibility of ob taining the Persian orthography in many cases, render absolute uniformity out of the question. No attempt has been made at conjectural geography, and blanks have been unhesitatingly left in the absence of direct visual evidence. The result is to show that in spite of the immense increase of information recently acquired our knowledge of the topography of Persia is much less in extent and detail than might be supposed from existing maps, German and English. This is especially the case in South Fars and Western Irak. The six sheets of the map, which is on the scale of 16 statute miles to the inch, are divided as follows :\u2014 The 1st or N.W. sheet comprises Adarbaijan, Ghilan, Kurdistan, Karmanshah, Hamadan, and part of Irak. The 2nd or N. sheet contains eastern Irak, western Khurasan, and Mazandaran, and includes the Great Salt Desert. The 3rd or N.E. sheet has but the eastern half of a single province, Khurasan ; and the 4th or S.W. those of Arabistan 1 The non-completion of this work has delayed Major St. John's map several months."], [226, "66 GAZETTEERS. and Khuzistan. The 5th or S. sheet comprises the great southern provinces of Ears and Karman, with part of Yazd ; and the 6th or S.E., Sistan, Narmashir, and Baluchistan. The outline is being executed by Messrs. Stanford on copper ; the hill shading will be given by the peculiar process patented by them. It is hoped that the whole will be published by the end of the year. The map of western Asia, under construction by Captain Felix Jones, is progressing satisfactorily. It comprises four sheets of double elephant size, that is, 40 by 26 inches each of which three sheets can be made ready for reproduction at a brief notice, and the fourth, or S.W. sheet, will be in hand in a short period. This has been deferred to the last to give place to the results of the Palestine Exploration Surveys, very liberally promised by the Committee of the fund. Representing, as these sheets will do, all the modern features of the Old World as well as the classical sites of antiquity for which the region between the Mediterranean and the Caspian, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, is renowned, the work will prove of public utility and generally instructive in a variety of ways. The more so as in its treatment a new process of cartography has been em ployed ; a process tending to throw the natural features of coun tries more into relief than map surfaces usually do, and will therefore commend itself. But it here merits notice as important to public works of a geographical character. Those most conversant with the subject discern but little difficulty in the reproduction of maps similarly treated ; all that is suggested is, that if reproduction be intended it should not be delayed, for the simple reason that our climate is but a sorry preservative of the original fan- aspect of manuscript wrorks of any kind. The gazetteers of Central Asia, prepared under the superintendence of Colonel McGregor, for political and military reference, are making progress. The first, which appeared in 1872, was \"Part I.

There are useful statistical tables at the end, and the work is illus trated with maps and photographs. An excellent general index adds to the completeness of this ably compiled and very useful work. Another gazetteer which has recently appeared is that of the little state of Karauli, the author being Captain P. W. Powlett, settlement officer of Alwar.

Then followrs a statistical account of the state (from which we learn that the area, as determined by the operations of the topographical survey, is about 1,260 square miles only, being a third less than hitherto believed), a description of the mines and quarries, forests, wild animals, and jungle products.

Its preparation was suggested by the senior Board of Examiners in Arts of the Calcutta University, who felt that elementary text books treating of natural sciences, for use in India, should deal more especially with objects familiar and inte resting to the Indian learner. The illustrations in Mr. Blanford's little work are, therefore, taken as much as possible from Indian localities, and the three last chapters are entirely devoted to the geology and climate of India ; forming the only popular description that has yet appeared of these interesting subjests.

Among the treasures preserved from destruction are the original manuscript reports of the trigonometrical operations of Colonel Lambton, Sir George Everest, and Sir Andrew Waugh. A list of these, with the contents of each volume, commences the catalogue; together with the manuscript angle books. Then follow the printed reports, including Sir George Everest's accounts of the measurement of an arc of the meridian ; Sir Andrew Waugh's exhaustive report on the extent and nature of the surveys, prepared for Parliament in 1851 - the annual reports ; and Colonel Walker's account of the operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, vol. I. The list of charts and plans of the triangles of the survey next occupies 27 pages. There is then a list of the printed reports"], [229, "THE CATALOGUE. 69 of the revenue surveys, and of all the publications of the Geological Survey. The catalogue of general maps of India commences with the Indian Atlas, and contains all the early memoirs and maps of the Madras Military Institute ; early general maps of India, or parts of India, by Rennell, A. Arrowsmith, Colonel Hodgson, Monier Williams, Reynolds; and the later maps of Allen, Thuillier, Walker, and Stanford. The series of old Portuguese plans of Indian towns, and of old Dutch charts and maps of India, which have been added to the collection in the Geographical Department, are specially interesting. The collection also contains a valuable series of maps of the Ganges and other rivers in India, most of them in manuscript. Tassin's maps of the Ganges Delta appeared at Calcutta in 1835 and 1840. There are 32 manuscript maps of the Ganges, by Colonel Rennell ; Colebrooke's manuscript survey ; Wood's beauti ful manuscript maps of the Ganges, from Hurdwar to Allahabad ; Hogdson's Ganges ; maps of the Brahmaputra, by Bedford and Wilcox ; manuscript surveys of the Indus, by Burnes, Wood, and Grieve ; and surveys of the Burmese rivers. After the catalogue of general maps follow those of the dif ferent divisions of India, commencing with the Bengal Presidency. These commence with the Bengal Atlas of Colonel Rennell, and numerous old route maps, memoirs, and field books. There are also six manuscript maps of Bengal districts by Dr. Buchanan Hamilton. The rest are arranged according to districts ; and the list of maps of districts and rivers of Bengal, the North-West Provinces, Oudh, and the Punjab, fills 70 pages. Another 30 pages contain the maps of countries in the Rajputana and Central India Agencies, and of the Nizam's territory. Mysore and Curg are represented by the old maps and memoirs of Colonel Colin Mackenzie, and by the sur veys of Connor, as well as by more modern maps. The maps of British Burmah fill seven pages. The earlier maps of the Madras Presidency, and those of Colonel Priestley's survey, including the village maps, occupy 90 pages, and the Bombay list fills 27 pages. Then follows the list of maps of the Portuguese and French territories in India, of Central Asia, including Turkistan, and of Afghanistan. The latter include the reports and papers of Sir Alexander Burnes' mission, with the manuscript maps and sketches by Lieutenant Wood during his expedition to the source of the Oxus ; the route surveys of the army of the Indus by Anderson and"], [230, "70 WORK OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL DEPARTMENT. Durand ; and various other manuscripts of great value and interest. The geographical materials referring to Persia, Asiatic Turkey, and Arabia, including the results of the Mesopotamian Survey, occupy 17 pages. The maps of Nepal include the routes of Kirkpatrick, Crawford, Sir D. Ochterlony, and the boundary surveys of lieu tenant Garden and others. The China section contains the Atlas of China by D'Anville ; and a Chinese map of great part of Asia, on ten rolls, printed in about 1761 ; which appears to be a new edition of the famous map con structed by the J esuits, and which formed the basis\" of D'Anville's Atlas. The list of maps in Oriental languages fills three pages. The list of charts of Indian coasts and islands, collected by Dalrymple, and of those published by Horsburgh and Walker, completes the catalogue, which fills over 500 large octavo pages. It is anticipated that the India Office Geographical Catalogue will be of great service, not only to geographers and map makers, but also to all the Government Departments, and to inquirers into almost all classes of Indian subjects. It will convey a vast amount of information as to the existence of precious manuscript materials, both in the shape of maps and of memoirs, wliich have hitherto been buried and unknown. A very complete idea may thus be formed of the existing materials for the compilation of general maps, and for use in the study of special subjects. The catalogue was com menced by Mr. Clements Markham, who made lists of the atlases, memoirs, field books, and other manuscript materials, continued by Mr. Girdlestone and Captain Thuillier, and completed and passed through the press by Mr. Trelawney Saunders. A catalogue of the maps of the Indian Surveys and other miscel laneous maps on sale, arranged in alphabetical order, is also passing through the press. It is to appear in octavo form, and will be accompanied by an index map showing the condition of the Indian Atlas. Besides maps for the moral and material progress report, the following maps were prepared in the Geographical Department during the year ; three maps, with statistical tables to illustrate the Bengal famine ; a map of India exhibiting the distribution of rice, and another showing the distribution of wheat and other grains ; a map of Bengal to show the relative intensity of the failure of the food crops ; a map of India for the railway report, a map of Asia showing the successive acquisitions of Russia, and a map of the principal routes to the north-west of India."], [231, "GEOGRAPHICAL DEPARTMENT. 71 In 1873 the preparation of the annual report of the moral and material progress of India, for presentation to Parliament, became a part of the duties of the Assistant Secretary in charge of the Geographical Department. The graphic illustration of statistics brings this work into direct and harmonious contact with geo graphy. Territorial limits are one of the bases of all statistics. Population comes next, and these two statistical elements neces sarily rule all others. Diagrams and maps both generalise and allow of abstraction. They enable inquirers at once to detect and often to rectify errors, which if undetected would affect results and throw everything into confusion. In the present Geographical Department of the India Office there is the efficient means of employing this method to advantage ; and almost all statistical facts can be treated on the basis of geographical distribution. Poprdation may be illustrated with reference to the physical aspects of a country. Agricultural statistics may be shown with reference not only to the yield and area of crops, but also to the proportion of that yield to population. Fiscal arrangements, as re gards India, may be very clearly explained on a map, better indeed than by any system of tabulation. The exact extent of each system of land revenue settlement may be shown by colours, with the salt lines and stations, and the opium cultivation. Manufactures, commerce treated from various points of view, institutions, lan guages, ethnology, religions, education, crime, medical statistics, political questions, and distribution of troops, are all capable of cartographic illustration, while some can best, and others can only be presented effectively by this method. Not only is it in itself a necessary part of statistical work, but it serves to give aids, supply checks, and detect errors in tabulation. The two methods are necessary to each other. The usefulness of reports of a statistical character depends on the systematic classification of facts in appropriate groups, such as every accurate thinker or careful historian necessarily adopts for his own use. The report is now divided into fifteen sections, each treating of a special administrative subject, or group of subjects, as they affect the whole of India ; the aim being to include in each section those subjects which have more characteristics in common with one another than any of them have in common with any other subject not in that section. Each section is to be eventually illus trated by maps and statistical tables. The preparation of the illustrative statistical maps must, however, necessarily be a work"], [232, "72 GEOGRAPHICAL DEPARTMENT. of time. The surveys in India are still incomplete, and there is urgent need of an accurate map of India on an adequate scale, with which to work as a basis. Statistical data are also wanting as regards several subjects, and can only be gradually collected. Mean while progress will be made in the cartographic illustration of the statistical reports year by year. For the year 1871-72, fifteen maps were prepared, showing terri torial divisions ; the rainfall ; the irrigation ; the railways ; lines of telegraph, and lighthouses ; the reserved forests ; the distribution of troops ; the progress of the geological survey ; and the series of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. In 1874, for the report of 1872-73, some additions have been made, of maps to show administrative divisions, the incidence of fiscal arrangements, and commercial routes. Further progress must be slow, owing to the incomplete ness of the statistics received from India ; but it is intended to make some important additions during the ensuing year, and especially to prepare, so far as it is now possible, a map showing the distribution of population. The Moral and Material Progress Report for 1872-73 is a new edition of that for 1871-72, with the information specially belonging to the previous year eliminated, and that of the current year taking its place.

Indian Marine Surveys, 1871-6. The Department of Indian Marine Surveys has been officially organized during the latter year under review, and the provision of this most necessary work may therefore be said to be now permanently secured. According to a resolution1 of the Government of India, published in the Gazette, the duties to be discharged are as follows : Systematic surveys of the coasts of India are to be carried on with suitable vessels efficiently equipped and manned. These surveys are to be connected with the shore surveys, and closed in on points ah-eady fixed by the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The original surveys of ports, harbours, and river entrances will be photozincographed, and issued for local navigation and engineering purposes, and from them charts of the coast will be compiled on a medium scale for the purposes of general navigation. Copies of all original surveys will be forwarded to the Admiralty Hydro grapher for publication ; and all corrections of surveys and other information, such as notices of changes in the places of buoys, lights, &c, will also be transmitted at once to the same office. A catalogue of all the charts of the Department will be kept, besides a sufficient stock of Admiralty charts, and copies of these will be furnished to the Local Governments and public officers on demand. The Superintendent of Marine Surveys is also charged with the duty of compiling an annual chart of wrecks, an annual list of fights, with descriptions of them and their position, and sailing directions for the Indian coasts. He will report on the lighting and marking of the sea approaches to all great Indian ports and rivers ; suggest improvements in harbour conservancy by means of buoys, beacons, and lights, and in the navigation of rivers throughout India. Any extracts from log books of vessels belonging to the Bengal and Bombay Marine, or to H. M.'s Squadron, which bear upon any discoveries, dangers, or errors in the charts of the Indian Seas will be communicated to the Department of Marine 1 Nos. 782-792, Department of Revenue, Agriculture, and Commerce, dated Simla, October 25, 1875.

The foregoing describes the nature of the duties. The agency by which they are to be discharged consists of a Superintendent (Commander A. D. Taylor, late I. N.), two Deputy Superintendents, and nine Assistant Superintendents, three executive officers, one Medical Officer and Naturalist, and a Superintendent of the Drawing Branch. The five surveying officers next in rank to the Superin tendent belong to the Royal Navy, their services having been lent to the Indian Government by the Admiralty. The whole cost of the Department does not exceed two lakhs of rupees or 20,000/. per annum.1 The first general report on the operations of the Marine Survey of India was issued by the Superintendent, Commander Taylor, in the latter part of December 1876. It commences with a retrospect of the preliminary steps from 1871 to 1873, which led to the deputation of Commander Taylor to India in the latter year. It touches upon the proposals of the Government of India for securing efficient surveys and charts, the measures taken in England to obtain qualified surveyors, and the final departure of Commander Taylor and the officers selected for service under him in December 1871. The vessels chosen for the Marine Survey operations were at that date as follows : \u2014 The \"Clyde\" (steamer) and the \"Constance\" (schooner) had been fitted at Bombay for surveying purposes, and the \" Guide \" (brig) and the \"Lady Lawrence\" (schooner) had been selected by the Kidderpore dockyard authorities for the same service. The last-mentioned vessel, however, could not carry a steam cutter, and was unsuitable for chart work, so was retransferred to the Marine Department. The \" Clyde \" eventually proved to be almost useless under sail, and the \" Guide\" to be so affected by dry rot as to be 1 The Department on 31st March 1876 consisted of the- following officers : \u2014 Commander A. D. Taylor, I.N., Superintendent ; Staff-Commander J. H. Ellis, R.N. Deputy Superintendent, 1st Grade ; R. C. Carrington, Esquire, Superintendent of the Drawing Branch ; Navigating Lieutenant F. W.

These disappointments have caused much delay, and have necessitated the provision of a new steamer, which is eventually to be constructed in England.1 Notwithstanding the lack of vessels, the Department has been able to accomplish much valuable work. Mr. Chapman, late I.N., in the \" Constance,\" made a plan of Kolachel Harbour and surveyed the Enciam Bocks in Travancore, charting 6 miles of coast and 5^ square miles of water. He then rounded Cape Comorin, passed through the Paumben Pass, obtained additional soundings in Palk Strait, and verified those on the published charts, and then pro ceeded to Coconada, where he commenced the survey of the Bay, till relieved by Lieut. Hammond and Sub-Lieut. Petley. This survey was completed on the 21th August 1874. It comprised 79 square miles of water and 12 miles of coast, charted on a scale of 2 inches =1 nautic mile. The survey has since been republished by the Admh-alty Hydrographer. Regarding the question of the lighting of the port of Coconada, Lieut. Hammond considers that two new lighthouses are required ; one of the 1st order dioptric, with a radius of 21 miles, on Point Gordeware, and another for Coconada Harbour of the 3rd order dioptric, to show at a distance of 10 miles and to be erected 1^ miles S.S.E., of the present lighthouse. On the 8th April the \" Guide,\" under the command of Navigating Lieut. J. E. Coghlan, proceeded down the River Hooghly, and surveyed the dangerous James and Mary Shoals, Luff Point to Anchoring Creek, including the entrance to the Roopnarain River, on the scale of 10 inches to the nautic mile (this being subsequently reduced for publication by photozincography to 6 inches to the mile). The chart is a valuable one for record, and Captain Taylor remarks that if the whole of the river from Chandernagore were annually surveyed in the same way, a comparison of the results would be most invaluable in carrying out engineering works for the improvement of the conservancy of the river. Staff Commander Ellis, R.N., in the \" Clyde,\" had in February connected by meridian distance Pigeon Island with one of the Laccadive group, in his voyage from Bombay to Calcutta. He was also enabled to make an examination of the channel into 1 The Asiatic Society of Bengal have requested Government to have this vessel constructed with appliances for deep-sea dredging. The point is still under con sideration."], [248, "4 SURVEY OF BURMESE COAST. Mootapetta Bay (Port Lome), the soundings near which differed considerably from Captain Powell's survey in 1837. The dredging and blasting operations in Paumben Pass are still continued. A depth of 11 feet 9 inches had then (March, 1875) been attained, and it was confidently expected that the Pass would soon be available for vessels of 11 feet draught. Survey operations along the Burma coast were commenced in November 1875 by Lieut. Jarrad in the \" Clyde \" examining the approaches to the Rangoon River. The erection and maintenance of a tide pole was a matter of great difficulty, owing to native boats fouling it, and the great strength of the tidal streams. Captain Taylor considers the establishment of a self-registering tidal gauge there very desirable. This important\" survey was completed on the 8th March, and comprised 37-| miles of coast, trigonometrically laid down, and 216 square miles of water examined. In consequence of a discrepancy in longitude discovered in the compilation of the sheet, including the coast of Tenasserim and Singapore and Penang, the meridian distance between Elephant Point Obelisk, which has been determined by the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and Amherst, was astronomically measured. The result proved that the position of Amherst on Admiralty Chart, No. 823, is 4|* miles too far west. Commander Taylor intends to have observations made next season at Diamond Island, off Cape Negrais, and Amherst, for the same purpose, and there would then be three principal points in the Gulf of Martaban fixed astronomically. These measurements of meridian distances are of great importance, as the whole of the eastern side of the Bay of Bengal has been very incorrectly laid down on the Admiralty Charts, an error of from five to eight miles sometimes existing. After obtaining some prohfic dredging between Diamond Island and Akyab, the \" Clyde \" commenced the survey of that port on the 21st March. Much time was spent in clearing the hill tops of jungle, owing to the independent character of the Burmese, and the difficulty, through want of an interpreter, of communicating with them. On the night of the 30th March, Navigating Sub-Lieut. C. George, R.N., was suddenly seized with cholera, which had been rife for some time among the native population ; and though every thing possible was done to arrest the progress of the disease, the unfortunate young officer died at noon on the 1st April. Lieut. George was a son of Staff-Commander C. George, R.N., Map"], [249, "captain taylor's inspection of Burmese ports. 5 Curator to the Royal Geographical Society, and a young officer of much promise. Owing to the threatening prevalence of the disease, Commander Taylor, who was on his way down the coast of Burma on a visit of inspection, ordered Lieut. Jarrad to leave Akyab. The \" Clyde \" accordingly proceeded northwards, and tested the correct ness of the coast between Cheduba and Kyouk Phyou, as shown on Admiralty Chart, No. 821. Lieut. Jarrad reports it to be roughly laid down and out of bearing when referred to Cheduba Island. The published plan of Kyouk Phyou proved to be so incorrect that arrangements were made for the survey of the Port to be continued the ensuing season. The \" Constance,\" under the command of Lieut. Hammond, left Calcutta in December 1875 for the purpose of making a plan of the anchorage of Ealse Point on the Orissa coast. In spite of many mishaps with the steam cutter, the survey was completed by the 9th March. The anchorage was charted on the 6-inch scale, the coast for 5 miles to the south and 10 miles to the north was surveyed on the 3-inch scale, and the soundings extend to from 5 to 8 miles off shore. Lieut. Hammond then proceeded to the northern portion of the shoal off Dhumrah River, where he measured a base, and proceeded to sound the shoals. Unfortunately, work was completely stopped by a heavy gale, and a great number of the crew falling sick compelled Lieut. Hammond to return to Calcutta, whence he proceeded to England on medical certificate. During the months of April and May 1876, Commander Taylor made a tour along the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal, and inspected the ports of British Burma. He visited first Akyab and Moulmain, and then proceeded to Amherst. This port has never been properly surveyed. The late Mr. Pearson, of the Bengal Marine, examined the Moulmain River in 1865, but no steps were taken to have the Admiralty Chart corrected by the survey. Com mander Taylor is of opinion that no large port of British India requires so much to be properly surveyed and mapped, and has accordingly1 arranged for Lieut. Jarrad to commence next season's work at Amherst. The Admiralty Chart of Tavoy proved to be dangerously erroneous; and the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamer \" Mahratta,\" when navigating by it, struck on a rock in Tavoy River. Subsequently, Captain Taylor discovered a copy of the survey of Tavoy, executed by Lieut. R. Moresby, of tbe Bombay Marine, in 1824, and published by Horsburgh in 1827,"], [250, "6 NEW LIST OF COAST LIGHTS. which is far superior to that issued by the Admiralty. Captain Taylor proposes to issue amended charts of Tavoy, Mergui, Pakchan, &c. After visiting Mergui he turned his attention to the passage from Mergui to Pakchan, which urgently needs sailing directions, \u2014 none of which at present exist. He proposes to issue these in the form of hydrographic notices, explanatory of the normal trading route between Moulmain and Pakchan, touching at Tavoy and Mergui, with some useful remarks on the extended voyage along the Siam coast to Penang. Below Pakchan, Commander Taylor has made a sketch showing the soundings in the entrances to Kopah, which has great tin mines like most of the ports along the Siam coast, but no trace of such a fine river as depicted on the Admiralty Chart. A new chart of Kopah is now in preparation. Of Junk Ceylon or Salang a pretty good survey was obtained from Captain Richelieu, commanding the Siamese Royal gunboat ***- Coronation.\" This officer was trained in the British Royal Navy, is a good observer, and most intelligent in surveying the coast and islands. The actual survey of this island differs immensely from the published one, and the corrected charts will be a great boon to the British India Steam Navigation Company and the coasting trade. The Superintendent of Marine Surveys has been consulted by Government on a variety of marine questions of great importance. Among these may be mentioned that of the re-organization of the River Hooghly Survey, on which an exhaustive report has been submitted by him. Commander Taylor is of opinion that an elaborate scientific survey of the whole tidal basin of the Hooghly River, at least from Chandernagore to the Sand Heads, is required, as well as an accurate series of levels from Calcutta to below Diamond Harbour. During the year under review a valuable list of lighthouses and light vessels in British India, including the Red Sea and coast of Arabia, has been issued by the Marine Survey Department. The list is in the form of a hand-book, giving in tabular order the lights, with their names, latitude and longitude, colour, radius of illumination, height, and other particulars. This little book will be a most useful aid to navigation. It has been compiled by Mr. R. C. Carrington. The programme of work to be undertaken by the Marine Survey Department during the season of 1876-77 was as follows:\u2014 The \" Clyde\" was\" to leave Calcutta in November, call at Diamond"], [251, "GREAT TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY. 7 Island (Bassein River), and connect the same astronomically with Rangoon and Amherst Pagoda, and then to proceed to survey the approaches and entrance to Moulmain River, on a 2^-inch scale. After that the \" Clyde \" is to examine the entrance to the Sandoway River, and then to complete the survey of Akyab Port,\u2014 a task which will probably occupy two months. Commander Taylor proposes himself to visit first the Mergui Archipelago, in which trip he is to be accompanied by Dr. Arm strong, (the opportunities for research in natural history and geology being very promising in these islands,) and then to inspect all the ports on the Coromandel Coast, with a view to satisfying himself regarding their requirements as far as regards lighting, buoying, &c. This programme has received the sanction of the Government of India. The Annual Indian Wreck and Casualty Statement for 1875 has not yet been received in England, and a review thereof is therefore impracticable. II. Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, 1874-5. The out-turn of work by this department amounted to 89 principal triangles, covering an area of 6,416 square miles, in connection with which two astronomical azimuths of verification have been measured ; of secondary triangulation, an area of 4,049 square miles bas been closely covered with points for the topo graphical surveys, and an area of about 6,000 square miles has been operated in pari passu with the principal triangulation ; and of topographical surveying, 4,525 square miles on the scales of one inch, two inches, and four inches to the mile. Of geographical exploration much valuable work has been completed by officers of the department on the northern frontier of Afghanistan, and on the lines from Ladakh to Lhasa, and Lhasa to Assam. The financial administration of the department during the year under review has been exceedingly difficult and embarrassing. A large increase of expenditure had been occasioned by the introduction of a system of consolidated salaries, and by the resumption of opera tions in British Burmah. The orders for these measures were speedily followed by orders for large reductions of expenditure, which, accord ing to present arrangements, are to be gradually carried out within"], [252, "8 CONNEXION OF INDIA AND CEYLON TRIANGULATIONS. the next three years by the stoppage of promotions, and a reduction of numbers as vacancies occur. The revision of portions of the Great Arc south of Bangalore having been completed, as stated in last year's abstract,1 the Madras party was deputed to start the Ramnad Longitudinal Series, which is to extend eastwards from the Great Arc and along the coast to Ramesweram, with a view to the proposed connection of the tri angulations of India and Ceylon. The work of clearing \" rays \" between the stations was very slow, owing to the occurrence of belts of dense palmyra forest intermixed with groves of cocoanut trees, which necessitated the erection of the stations to a sufficient height, by means of lofty scaffolding. Major Branfill extended a succession of quadrilaterals as far as the land's end, utilising islets of coral reef which lie parallel to the mainland at a distance of from 4 to 5 miles. The connection with Ceylon will be completed, it is hoped, by next season. A curious instance of religious bigotry was exemplified in the refusal of some village priests to allow the gopuram or entrance tower (80 feet high) of the Tirupullani Temple to be used for a station, although Major Branfill offered to pay liberally for the use of it. He has drawn up a most useful alpha betical list of the proper names of the stations and landmarks fixed during the season, with the root-meaning. The vernacular form was ascertained on the spot, and this will, no doubt, prove of service in correcting the spelling in further maps and charts. As mentioned in the Topographical Surveys section,2 Lieut. Har man was deputed to join the Duffla Hills expeditionary force. His first triangulatory operations were confined to the country between Jorhat and Dibrugarh. He subsequently accompanied the field force as Major Godwin Austen's assistant, and made a recon naissance of the Ranga Valley and the hill-ranges to the east of the tracts occupied by the force. He made good friends of the mountaineers, and after an absence of three months returned to his own party, but the extraordinary difficulties of the country pre vented him from completing more than two triangles. In British Burmah the want of proper topographical maps had necessitated the suspension of the Geological Survey ; and as isolated Town Surveys were being carried on, and Marine Surveys of the 1 See Abstract for 1873-4, p. 4. 8 See infra, p. 17."], [253, "9 EASTERN frontier series. coast were about to be commenced, Colonel \"Walker was requested to prosecute the triangulation vigorously. The Brahmaputra party was accordingly re-organised and trans ferred to Burmah, under Mr. W. Beverley, who worked in the country to the south of Rangoon, while Mr. Mitchell, his assistant, who. was transferred from the Eastern Frontier Series, reconnoitred the ground and laid out the triangulation north of Rangoon. The object was to lay out secondary triangles from the principal sides of the Easter Frontier Series, in order to fix all the large towns, prominent and permanent objects, peaks, &c, in British Burmah, for detail and geological surveys, and lighthouses along the coast for the marine surveys. Owing, however, to the unfavourable nature of the weather and difficulties of the ground, it was not possible to connect the two sections ; this, however, was to have been accomplished the following season. The Eastern Frontier Series1 has been extended in a S.E. direction to within 40 miles of the town of Moulmain. The same obstructions as had been met with in previous years \u2014 the dense forest and tropical vegetation growth, the sparse population, the reluctance of the Burmese to work for hire, and the practice of firing the grass jungles during the field season and so obscuring the atmosphere \u2014 all these circumstances combined to render a less out-turn of work than would have been obtained elsewhere in India. The area amounted to about 3,150 square miles, and the preliminary operations for future triangulation were carried over a distance of about 100 miles. One hill station, Chaiteo, 3,600 feet above sea-level, is described by Mr. Rossenrode as a very remarkable sight. It consists of stupendous projecting rocks surmounted by masses of other rock raised in successive tiers. Each of these rocks is crowned by a pagoda, the principal one standing on a rock which projects like a rhinoceros horn over a yawning precipice several hundred feet in depth. The Burmese ascribe, not unnaturally, the erection of these super-imposed masses of rock to superhuman agency. Captain Rogers's party1 extended its triangulation northwards through the Deserts of Jaisalmir and Bikanir, \u2014 tracts which, though fairly inhabited during the rainy season, are deserted in the hot 1 See Abstract for 1873-4, p. 6."], [254, "10 KATTYWAR AND GUZERAT SURVEYS. months, owing to the failure of water. The out-turn was very good, amounting to an area of 2,172 square miles. . The topographical operations in Kattywar1 have been carried on under the charge of Captain Pullan, owing to Captain Trotter's engagements on duties connected with the Geographical Exploration beyond the British Frontier. The area topographically surveyed amounted to 1,749 square miles, while preliminary triangulation was extended over 2,200 square miles. On reaching the coast of the Gulf of Cutch a satisfactory junction was effected with the Marine Survey of that gulf, executed by Commander A. D. Taylor in 1851. This portion of the country lying along the borders of the Gulf of Cutch proved very difficult to survey, on account of the treacherous mud banks and mangrove swamps which fringed the coast. Major Haig was engaged during the year under review in carrying on in Guzerat a system of survey1 planned so as to combine the work of the Bombay Revenue Survey with the accurate measurements of the professional survey. This combined survey is on the scale of 4 inches for the British districts, and 2 inches to the mile for the Native States. The area surveyed topographically was 1,375 square miles, the out-turn being almost exactly double what it was the previous year when the operations were of a tentative nature, and the best method of utilising the Revenue Survey details had still to be ascertained. About 550 square miles were surveyed by Lieut. Gibbs in the Dang Forests, the Dang Hills being tbe first step of the trap formation leading to the Deccan table-land. Lieut. Gibbs says that in the Gaekwar territory he was struck with the wretched state of the trees, especially teak, and that one might reckon on the core of any teak tree over a foot in diameter being rotten, and the trees all misshapen. On working into the Dang States, the superiority in size, symmetry, and healthy growth of the trees under the Forest Department strikes the untrained eye at once. A copious list of trees and plants is given by Lieut. Gibbs, with the scientific name and locality. The Surveyor-General of India having expressed very decided opinions against the expediency of using at all the Bombay Revenue Survey work for geographical purposes, a conference of survey and engineer officers was assembled by Government to report on the 1 See Abstract for 1873-4, p. 7."], [255, "DEHRA DUN SURVEYS. LEVELS IN MADRAS. 11 whole subject, including the question of scale, but, owing to the divergencies of opinion, no report could be agreed on. Under these circumstances Government ordered the adoption of a medium course, and directed the employment of the 2-inch scale and the utilisation of the Revenue Survey maps. The surveys in the Dehra Dun and the Siwalikhs are being carried on conjointly by part of the Kumaun and Garhwal party, under Captain Thuillier,1 who is surveying the non-forest tracts and by the newly formed Department of Forest Surveys, under Captain Baily.1 The areas topographically surveyed by this combined party were 225 and 288 square miles respectively, \u2014 the ground, particularly in the interior of the Siwalikhs, being very broken and difficult to delineate. During the rainy season of 1871 a detachment from Captain Thuil lier's party under Mr. Ryall was located at Almora in Kumaun, with a view to make the most of the short interval between the cessation of the autumnal rains and the setting in of winter weather. The out-turn amounted to 2,176 square miles, and the portion of country triangulated in advance covers 800 square miles. Much of this work required all the skill and nerve of the surveyors, owing to the great height of the mountains ; Mr. Pocock's work, par ticularly in the upper part of the Mana Valley, lay above 21,000 feet, the maximum height reached being over 22,010 feet above sea level. There only remains now 1,2.00 square miles to be completed ; but, operations in these desolate and inaccessible regions being expensive, their further progress has for the present been post poned. The spirit-levelling operations in the Madras Presidency were undertaken by Captain McCullagh {vice Lieut. Harman, transferred to Assam), who carried his work from the S.W. end of the Bangalore base to Bellary, and thence to Raichore Railway Station, a total distance of 297 miles. At Bellary a junction was effected with the line of levels which had been carried from thence to the Port of Karwar in the preceding season. There was a discrepancy of 4*5 feet : this will probably be eliminated when the mean sea-levels at Karwar and Madras have been exactly determined. The determinations of mean sea-level in the Gulf of Cutch,2 com menced in 1873 and continued up to the year under review under 2 Ibid., p. 10. B i See Abstract for 1873-4, p. 8."], [256, "12 TIDAL OBSERVATIONS. Captain A. W. Baird, R.E., were undertaken as a first step towards deciding whether progressive changes are taking place in the level of the land at the head of the Gulf, as has long been supposed to be the case. It is proposed that the operations shall be repeated at the same points a few years hence, and the comparison will show what variation has occurred. The tidal stations are three in number, connected with each other by carefully-executed lines of spirit-levelling. The self -registering gauges are erected on shore over iron cylinders, which are sunk vertically into masonry wells, and communicate with the sea by a system of piping, terminating in a rose suspended by a buoy in deep water. Each station is also furnished with self-registering instruments for recording the direction and velocity of the wind, and the barometric pressure. During the monsoon of 1874, which was one of great severity, the piping at Nowanar was completely buried by sand, and as new piping had to be procured from Bombay, a break of nine months duration occurred in the registration of the observations. At Okha the breaks in the continuity of the registration were very short and of no importance; at Hanstal they were more numerous and longer, the water being here muddier and causing more sediment. Owing to the trying nature of the work of in specting the stations during the monsoon, the registration was continued to within a few days of the commencement of the monsoon, and the stations then dismantled, the cylinders being sm-mounted by cairns to serve future identification. The first series of operations to determine the relative changes of land and sea is thus now accomplished.1 From the combined tidal and levellin\u00b0* operations preliminary results have been obtained, showing that the mean sea-level is higher by 7 inches at the head of the Gulf, and by 4 inches midway up, than it is at the mouth of the Gulf. During the year 1875 the tidal observations taken in 1871-72 at Tuticorin had been reduced by the harmonic method bv M. E. Roberts of the Nautical Almanac Office, and mathematical expressions have been deduced by which the height of any tide may be computed with great exactitude. In consequence of Captain Herschel's absence from India, and of 1 The final reduction of the registrations is being now (April 1877) carried on in England,"], [257, "PUBLICATIONS AND MAPS. 13 Captain Campbell being deputed to assist Colonel Tenuant in the operations connected with the transit of Venus at Roorkee, the determinations of longitude by the electro-telegraphic method have been suspended during the year under review. The Computing Office, besides being employed in its usual duties of examining and reducing the observations, has aided in the completion of the third and fourth volumes of the \" Account of the Operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.\" These volumes, however, will not be issued till the second, which is still in hand, is completed. This volume is intended to give a historical account of the triangu lation, and descriptions of the methods of procedure and of the instruments which have been employed. Its preparation has fallen mainly on Colonel Walker himself, as well as the portion of Vol. V. which will deal with the pendulum observations. Captain Heaviside, R.E., has been employed at the Head Office for nearly a year in completing the reduction of his pendulum observations,1 and in passing the late Captain Basevi's and his own observations through the press. Full accounts of these operations have now been printed, and will either form part of Vol. V. or be included in a supple mental volume. During the year 1875, Colonel Walker issued a third edition of his valuable map of Central Asia, each of the four sheets being entirely re-drawn, and much new material being inserted. A new map of Northern Afghanistan and the countries to the north of the Trans-Indus frontier, on the scale of 16 miles to the inch, has been prepared ivnder Captain Trotter's supervision, to indicate the results of the exploration of the Havildar and Mullah. Two maps illus tratins the Pundit's route from Leh to Lhasa and Assam have been prepared, as well as Captain Trotter's preliminary map of Eastern Turkestan, the Gazetteer maps of Kumaun and Garhwal, and various others. 1 See Abstract for 1873-4, p. 9.

During the year under review the number of parties employed on this survey remained unchanged. Much, however, remains to be done before the first Topographical Survey of India will have been accomplished, and the task becomes all the more difficult, as the tracts remaining to be surveyed are for the most part situated in the most mountainous and inaccessible parts. The total results for the season are, of final topography 21,731 square miles on the scales of 1 inch and -J inch to a mile, and 22,614 square miles of triangulation in advance, the average cost of the survey being Rs. 19 1 per square mile. Large scale plans were made of Jhalra Patun and Gagron Fort, Narsingarh, Sehore, Ajmere, Nasirabad, and Kishengarh ; and five forest reserves were surveyed on the scale of 4 inches to the mile, besides which pro gress was made with the Topographical Survey of Simla. Compared with the results of the preceding season, this shows a decrease of 2,372 square miles of topography \u2014 mainly attributable to the disaster which befell the party in the Naga Hills, and which caused Captain Badgley (who was badly wounded) to retire pre maturely from the operations of the field. The Gwalior and Central India Survey under Captain Charles Strahan was continued west of the meridian of 75\u00b0 45', within the Rajputara and Central India agencies. The triangulation in advance was extended towards the city of TJdeypur, and south of the operations of No. 7 party in Rajputara, and a junction was effected with the Karachi or Western Longitudinal Series. In the southern portion of the country which came under survey, the staple produce is opium. The tracts are plentifully watered by small streams, but very little use is made of the water, the only means of irrigation being the ordinary leather bucket drawn up by two bullocks. Cereals are much neglected, and the prices of grain of all sorts are very high. Plans of the cantonments of Jhalra Patun and of the fort of Gagron were made. The great mass of the inhabitants are Rajputs, but in the large towns a good number of Muhammadans are found. The aboriginal tribes are Bhils, who are of peaceful disposition, those of a warlike character being found further west. The soil in the low-lying tracts is mostly rich black cotton soil, on which the opium is grown, while all the high parts are very rocky"], [259, "CENTRAL PROVINCES SURVEY. 15 and barren. Notwithstanding the large area of forest, there is very little valuable timber. The ground topographically surveyed by the second party under Mr. F. B. Girdlestone embraced portions of the district of Khandesh, Native or Holkar's Nimar, and the State of Barwani. The Satpura range of hills extends through it, and hundreds of square miles within the tract are entirely uninhabited, though there is ample evidence that the country must have been fairly populated in former times. Tigers, leopards, panthers, bears, bison, and Sambhar deer are plentiful in the interior, but the sportsman incurs serious risk in pursuing these animals through the high spear-grass and forest. Mr. W. C. Barckley, one of the assistant surveyors, was terribly mauled by a bear, which he wounded, while engaged in surveying, and a Bheel guide was so severely wounded by another that he died soon after. The solitary bison inhabiting these hills is also described as very fierce and vindictive. The party has still to work in two detachments, on the hills and plains, and the operations are of a complicated character. Those for the season of 1875-6 have been occupied in the Native States between the Tapti and Nerbudda, a tract never before attempted to be delineated. Owing to the wild and unhealthy nature of the ground of the Central Provinces and Vizagapatam Agency Survey1, the scale has been reduced from the 1 inch to the I- inch to a mile, with a view to getting over the ground quicker. The topography obtained covers an area of 2,534 square miles, and connects the previous work of this party with that of the Hyderabad Survey along the eastern boundary of the Upper Godavery districts of Rakapili, Bhadrachelam, and Cherla. The triangulation covers an area of 5,132 square miles. Both Captain Holdich and Mr. Harper were subjected to much hardship and exposure in the course of their work, and the latter fell a victim and died on the 23rd June 1875. The inhabitants of the vast jungle of Bustar, included between the Saveri and the highlands of Jeypore on the east to the Godaveri district taluks on the west, is occupied by the aboriginal tribe of Koi or Koitor, a branch of the great family of Gond. The ordinary method of disposing of the dead is by cremation. Rude upright stone monuments, called menhirs, are found planted along the road in memory of the dead, and some trilithoms (two upright stones with a horizontal one) have also been discovered.

Tigers abound, especially in the proximity of the river; bears, leopards, deer of several varieties, bisons or buffaloes, are found ; and snakes of great size and variety are plentiful. The chief product of the country is timber. The Bhopal and Malwa Survey completed 2,237 square miles of topography and 3,385 square miles of triangulation, the ground of their operations lying east and west through the Bhopal Survey, north of the Nerbudda river and south of the parallel of 24\u00b0 S., which is the Hmit of No. 1 party. The -country triangulated was uninteresting, being very flat, with isolated low fiat hills, patches of jungle here and there, but generally cultivated throughout. Opium is the chief product about these parts; other grains are grown, but in small quantities, wheat being very expensive. As mentioned in last years abstract,1 the Khasia, Garo, and Naga Hills Survey party was engaged in three detachments. The first, under Major Godwin Austen, accompanied the Duffla military expedition against the tribes on the northern frontier of Assam. The second, under Captain Badgley, and the third, under Lieut. Wood thorpe, R.E., were employed in the Eastern Naga Hills south of the Sibsagar district. Captain Badgley was enabled to carry his triangulation from a side of the Assam Valley Series of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, to work into the hills immediately to the south and east, with a view to obtain a good basis for the topography, and to establish a connection with the work executed by Captain Samuells of the Revenue Survey during a previous season in the South Lakhimpur Hills east of the Dihing River. This he succeeded in doing, and had secured 792 square miles of triangulation and 657 square miles of topography up to February 2nd, 1875, when the party was suddenly attacked by Nagas from the villages of Sauna and Ninn, assisted by others from the village of Noka, who entered the camp very early in the morning under the pretence of furnishing supplies, and treacherously murdered Lieut. Holcombe, Political Officer, and 80 natives, besides severely wounding in the space of a few minutes Captain Badgley and 51 men, of whom some died afterwards. It was entirely due to Captain Badgley's fortitude and presence of mind under very trying circumstances, and while suffering from serious flesh wounds received in personal combat with several Nagas, two of whom he killed, that the remnant of the 1 Page 14."], [261, "OPERATIONS IN NAGA AND DUFFLA HILLS. 17 party, carrying the dying and the wounded, were extricated from these hills and brought safely to the station of Jaipur, where medical aid was obtained on the 7 th of February. Captain Badgley, though unable to take any further part in the field, recovered sufficiently to resume his duties at Shillong by the time the party went there for the recess. The detachment under Lieut. Woodthorpe entered the Naga Hills, south of Golaghat, and proceeded into the interior, accompanied by Captain Butler, Political Agent. They had barely begun work when they were attacked by natives from the large Naga village of Wokha. These, however, they defeated; and by this stroke an excellent moral effect was produced on the surrounding Naga villagers, most of whom then sent in friendly deputations. After this, work was continued in a north-easterly direction along the outer ranges of the Naga Hills, so as to join Captain Badgley's work, and complete what remained further south up to the Patkoi range. Owing, however, to the disaster which had befallen Captain Badgley's party, survey work was closed on this side, and Lieut. Woodthorpe and Mr. McCay joined the punitive expedition against the Eastern Nagas ; and, besides accomplishing a fair amount of topography, a good junction was established with Captain Samuells work on the east ; and the whole length of the outer and middle ranges south of district Sibsagar and part of Lakhimpur, or about 150 miles in length by 25 to 30 miles in breadth, has been surveyed. The area surveyed by the detachment was 1,507 square miles on i-inch and 1,075 square miles on the -|-inch scales. The season's total out-turn amounts to 792 square miles of triangulation and 3,239 square miles of topography, or, omitting overlaps and margins, 2,164 square miles of actually new area surveyed. A very lengthy and interesting account of the Naga Hills and the inhabitants is given in the narratives by Captain Badgley and Lieut. Woodthorpe, which are inserted in the appendices to Colonel Thuillier's report. The military expedition despatched into the Duffla Hills by the Government of India was accompanied by a survey party under Major Godwin Austen, Lieutenant H. J. Harman, R.E., having being attached thereto temporarily until the arrival of the former. Narainpur on the Dikrung Nullah was reached on the 2nd December 1874, and from a base on the banks of the Brahmaputra a short series of triangles was extended northward into the Duffla Hills. B 4"], [262, "18 RiJPUTANA SURVEY. Owing to the brief period during which the military were in the country, the survey party were unable to remain beyond two and a half months. The out-turn of work amounted to 1,705 square miles of entirely new topography, on the scales of 2 and 4 inches to the mile. A map on the latter scale, showing the results of the season's work in the Duffla Hills, has been compiled by Major Godwin Austen, and is a valuable addition to our geographical knowledge of the region beyond the northern frontier of Assam. Lieut. Harman, R.E., rendered assistance by surveying the course of the Ranga River; and Mr. Lister, of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, was assiduous in making a collection of plants, seeds, and dried botanical specimens. The Surveyor-General expresses a hope that these explorations on the Northern Assam frontier will be continued, and is of opinion that with tact and precaution all difficulties in the way of visiting and exploring the narrow strip of hills between the Assam valley and Tibet may be overcome. In consequence of Captain George Strahan's being temporarily employed in connection with the Transit of Venus observations, No. 7 (Rajputana) party was conducted into the field by Lieut. E. P. Leach, R.E. The area triangulated was 5,160 square miles, comprising most of the remaining good area or cultivated and thickly inhabited tract north of Jodhpur and Ajmere up to the margin of the desert of Bikanir. The country triangulated is very easy and open, little better than a sandy plain, with groups of sand hills at long intervals. The topography covered 3,711 square miles of ground, and embraces nearly the whole of the British district of Ajmere, besides portions of the States of Kishengarh and Jodhpur. During the recess progress was again made with the extension of the large scale survey of Simla ; and though it was interrupted by order of Government for a brief period, it was resumed after an outbreak of cholera, which necessitated measures for obtainin\u00b0- a water supply. The services of an experienced officer having been required to start a new topographical survey of the Mysore State, Captain George Strahan, R.E., has been transferred to this duty, and Lieut. E. P. Leach has again assumed charge of No. 7 party.

The Topographical Survey of Mysore, which is estimated to contain about 27,001 square miles, was arranged for under orders from the Government of India in the Foreign Department ; and two half parties from the Trigonometrical and Topographical Survey branches were drafted off with the object of starting the necessary triangulation during the season of 1875-76 as a basis for the topography, \u2014 the budget estimate having been sanctioned by the Chief Commissioner of Mysore at Rs. 80,000 for each party. These two half parties were under Captains Strahan, R.E., and J. R. McCullagh, R.E., and commenced work in November 1875, working from the northern portion of the Mysore State, so as to follow in the wake of the completed revenue and assessment measurements of the fields. The scale adopted is 1 inch to the mile ; but no fair estimates of the progress or cost can be made till the physical difficulties and peculiarities of the country and its people are fairly experienced. In the Geographical, Compiling, and Engraving branches of the Surveyor General's Office at Calcutta good work has been done in the year under review. The two maps of India, on the scales of 32 and 64 miles to the inch, have been proceeded with, but early editions of these maps are not yet available. Maps of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, and of Assam, both on the scale of 16 miles to the inch, have been photozincographed, and a map of Khelat and Balochistan, on the same scale, has been compiled from the best available information, at the request of the Foreign Depart ment of the Government of India. Progress has been made with the drawing of the old Ganjam and Orissa series maps, which by photozincography will be soon available for use. In the Engraving branch additions and corrections have been made to no less than 133 plates of different sizes, including tho plates of Simms' plan of Calcutta, with a view of bringing it up to date. A new survey of the city, to be executed on rigorous prin ciples, is however in contemplation, though no final arrangement has as yet been come to.

Of these eight were engaged in the Punjab and North-west Provinces, and six in Behar, Lower Bengal, Bombay, and Assam. Besides the above, four small parties were employed on detached duty, one on the Nepal Frontier Boundary Survey, one in Darjiling, one in Cachar, and one in the Darrang District of Assam. The total area of country surveyed amounted to 16,852 square miles, on the respective scales of 2, 4, 16, and 32 inches to the mile, In addition to the above, 2,286 square miles of country were triangulated, and 5,076 square miles traversed and surveyed in boundary in advance. With the exception of four parties, three of which were engaged on larger scale surveys and one of which had no more work to do, all have given in larger returns of work during the year under review than in the preceding year. The cost of the Cadastral Survey, on the 16-inch scale, has decreased still further to three annas three pies per acre. In the Hamirpur district, where the fields average nearly two acres each, the cost per mile is only a few rupees more than the rates of first class 4-inch = 1 mile survey, showing full area, details of cultivation, fallow, waste, &c., as carried out in the Punjab and Oudh. Had a professional field survey, with permanent fixed stations, been carried out in the first instance in the Punjab and Oudh, and the field maps been printed"], [265, "DERA GHAZI KHAN AND GURGA0N SURVEYS. 21 and published, it is needless to observe that immense sums of money would have been saved. The present cadastral maps of the districts of the North-western Provinces can be readily kept up to date year by year at a mere nominal expense, thus rendering a wholesale re-survey after re-settlements unnecessary. For ex tensions of canals or railroads and other engineering projects, these large scale surveys, combined as they are with careful levelling, are invaluable, and will save large expenditure in the future. During the past year 2,846 linear lines of levelling have been run in the districts of Dera Ismail Khan, Moradabad, Muttra and Banda, Agra and Hamirpur, and have been connected with the main series of levels run by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. Most of the Revenue Survey parties were inspected, both in the field and in the recess, by the Superintendents, and much advantage is said to be derived from this newly introduced system. In the Upper Circle, where operations are carried on under the general superintendence of Colonel Gastrell, the first or Dera Ismail Khan party,1 under Colonel H. C. Johnstone, were for the most part confined to the low lands of the Indus, south of Kalabagh, where the river emerges from the hills. Five principal and eight secondary stations of the Great Indus Series of the Great Trigono metrical Survey were connected with the survey. The measure ments of the two surveys agreed fairly well, those of the Revenue Survey being, however, always in excess, a peculiarity which may be attributed to sand hills and broken ground. The Gurgaon Survey,2 under Captain Wilkins, completed alto gether 1,348 square miles of 4-inch sm*vey, connection being established with several stations of the Great Arc and Rahun Meridional Series. The thakbusts, or settlement boundary maps, are described as very good, but in the Kurnal district the detail areas of the professional and settlement surveys did not agree well. A special investigation and report on this point will be made to Government. During the season of 1875-6 the Cadastral Survey, on tbe scale of 16 inches to the mile, of the small native state of Patandiwas to have been undertaken. The survey of the State of Bhawalpur2 was completed in the year under review, by Captain D. C. Andrew, and the party was broken 1 See Abstract of Surveys for 1873-4, p. 16. 2 See Abstract for 1873-4, p. 17."], [266, "22 CADASTRAL SURVEYS. up. The Bhawalpur State covers an area of 17,285-12 square miles, of which 5,082-02 miles are village area and 12,203-10 desert. Captain Andrew has prepared a Statistical and Geographical Report on the Bhawalpur State, which is to be duly published. In the Moradabad district1 a gross area of 918 square miles was surveyed cadastrally, on the scale of 16 inches to the mile, by Captain Barron's party. Exclusive of waste tracts, the average size of the fields was 0-91 of an acre, which may afford a notion of the labour involved in the field by field delineation of this district. 201 miles of levelling were carried out in connection with the above survey. The area in the Moradabad district remaining to be surveyed amounts to 339 square miles. In the case of the Muttra and Banda Cadastral Survey, though the average size of the fields was much the same as in the Moradabad district, operations were much complicated by the fact of large fields being often tilled by two or more cultivators, and the necessity for the quasi-boundary between these patches to be shown separately for settlement purposes. The utility of these cadastral maps is exemplified by the fact that the superintending engineer of the Light Provincial Railways had applied for tracings of the sheets, to save the delay and expense of a separate survey. The executive engineer of the Bulandshahr division, too, states that the tracings are of the greatest help in laying out the irrigation lines in the Muttra district. Good progress was also made with the Agra and Ghazipur Districts Survey, under Mr. E. T. S. Johnson. The average size of the fields in these districts was only -81 of an acre. In the Hamirpur district 1,238 square miles in all were surveyed by Mr. R, B. Smart, while in the Azamgarh district the party under Mr. Lane, formerly employed in the Central Provinces, completed an out-turn of 398 square miles, and brought the old survey of Allahabad Canton ment and Civil Station, taken in 1867-68, up to date. In the Lower Circle, where Colonel Macdonald officiated as super intendent, Lieut.-Col. Oakes was placed in charge of the cadastral survey of the Shahabad district in Behar. It was originally arranged that this survey should be on the 16 inch scale, but in consequence of the diminutive average size of the fields (0-273 of an acre), the scale, after some discussion, was increased to 32 1 See Abstract for 1873-4, p. 17."], [267, "MIDNAPUR SURVEY. 23 inches. The total area surveyed was 685 square miles, and the cost 12as. 4p. per acre, but Colonel Macdonald considers that with additional practice on the part of the Amins the rate may be reduced. The 12th or Midnapur division survey, under Major Sconce, covered an area of 978 square miles, and five stations of the coast series and one station of the South Maluncha series of the Great Trigonometrical Survey have been connected with the main circuit traverses. A very interesting geographical report on the rivers and embankments of the Midnapur district is given by Major Sconce in the Appendix to the Revenue Survey Report. The embankment on the face of the Bay of Bengal he describes as a magnificent work ; it is in some places 25 feet in height, and 150 feet in breadth at base. The 14th division, cr Dearah Survey, was formed out of the late 11th or Lakhimpur and 15th or Bhawalpur party, in order to determine the alterations of land consequent on the changes in the course of the river, between the Chundna river and Goalundo. Numerous masonry pillars were erected to mark the limit of action of the river, and connection of the season's work was made with ten stations of the Brahmaputra series of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The boundary between the Native States of Nepal and the British districts of Purneah and Bhagulpore was surveyed by Captain Samuells, in concert with the Nepalese officials. The boundary is marked by a substantial bank and ditch, belts of twenty-one yards on either side being marked as neutral ground, which is neither to be cultivated nor encroached upon by either state. In the rainy season of 1874, Mr. H. E. Gastrell was deputed to measure the alterations in grants of waste land in the Darjiling Hills. Unfortunately work was taken up here and there, at the instance of the Deputy Commissioner, and no systematic connexion was established, though 25,064 acres in the aggregate were surveyed in the two seasons. In consequence of the confused state of the boundaries, both of forest lands and cultivated holdings, in various parts of the district, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal arranged for Captain Sandeman, with an adequate party, to complete the survey in two seasons. This work has however been now stopped, and Colonel Macdonald apparently considers that the step is much to"], [268, "24 BOMBAY AND ASSAM SURVEYS. be deplored. Mr. Edgar actually found more than 500 acres of ground in the Terai highly cultivated and inhabited, which had never been assessed, and were paying no revenue. The Government forest lands too require to be carefully demarcated and delineated, their present extent being most erroneously shown on the map. When a settlement of the district is required, a fresh survey will have to be commenced, and nearly all the old work will have been rendered useless. In the Bombay Presidency, as during the last season, two parties1 were employed, viz., the 10th and 11th Deccan Surveys. The first mentioned party, under Captain Coddington, completed 1,900 square miles on the two-inch scale in the Nasik district and the Peint and Salgana States. The country is here poor, sparsely populated, and unhealthy. The other party, under Major H. C. B. Tanner, com pleted 1,623 square miles on the same scale in the Poona, Aclhmednagar, Satara, and Sholapur Collectorates, the tract touch ing the Nizam's dominions on the east and the great scarp of the Ghats on the west. Major Tanner graphically describes some of the magnificent scenery in the Western Ghats, which struck him in the course of his survey, and furnishes the reader with a very vivid notion of the general configuration and geological structure of the country he traversed. He proves very cogently that unless Govern ment takes systematic and vigorous measures to promote vegetation on the Bombay Deccan mountains, and so equalize the distribution of rain, the downpour will soon wash away the thin crust of soil which covers the rocks. He remarks that it is melancholy to con template the future of Indapoor and other Talukas similarly situated ; for though the land tax is light, yet constantly recurring famines have reduced the mass of the people to great poverty, and unless the Government makes extra exertions to increase the amount of wet cultivation from wells or to provide canal water at a reasonable rate, the future of the cultivation is gloomy indeed. In Assam, 1,663 square miles were surveyed on the two-inch scale by the 13th or Goalpara party, under Major Macdonald. The district formerly belonged to the Kuch Behar Commissionership, but now forms a portion of the Chief Commissionership of Assam. A brief but exhaustive statistical account of Goalpara is given by 1 See Abstract for 1873-4, pp. 18 and 19."], [269, "GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. 25 Major Macdonald in the Appendix to the Report. Survey operations were also continued in the Darrang district, in order to revise the boundaries of the Lakhiraj holdings and the waste lands grants ; and in the Cachar tea grants, to settle the areas which had to be resumed from grantees who had failed to fulfil all the conditions under which they had originally received land from Government. V. The Geological Survey of India, 1875. During the earlier part of the above year Mr. Medlicott's labours were confined to the Satpura Hills. Towards the close of the season he noticed the occurrence of rocks, which he considers as undoubtedly representative of the upper part of the series accom panying the coal-bearing rocks elsewhere, at a point much further west than previously known. Mr. Medlicott has recommended borings, but there is great uncertainty as to the depth at which the coal may be found. Up to the beginning of 1876 no definite results had been obtained from the borings instituted at Toondnee and Khappa. An interesting account is given by Mr. Medlicott in the Records of a visit paid by him to Khatmandu in Nepal, a country of which better knowledge, both geological and topographical, is much to be desired. Mr. Medlicott's inspection was necessarily brief and partial, but the continuity of the zone of newer rocks which fringes the Himalayan range to the north-west has been established and the occurrence of the newer tertiary groups also proved. At the com mencement of the season of 1875-6, Mr. Medlicott, in conjunction with Messrs. Theobald and Lydekker, commenced a revision of the tertiary rocks of the North-west and Punjab, with the main object of seeing whether the marked stratigraphical separation of two distinct groups of rocks in the Nahun country was accompanied by a distinction further west in their fossils. A knowledge of the structure of Sind has long been of great importance with reference to a study of the tertiary rocks of India. The examination of the province has often been put off, though with great reluctance, by the department. The sections in Sind were known to be unusually clear and well exposed. Many of the rocks were richy fossiliferous ; and though a very large number of"], [270, "26 GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. species had been already collected and described it had become evident that they had been erroneously referred to the same series. It was also highly probable that in Sind a connecting link would be found between the tertiaries of Cutch and of the sub -Himalayas. Accordingly Mr. Blanford and Mr. Fedden took up the examina tion of Sind in 1874, and before the end of the season of 1874-5 they had completed a fair sketch of the geology of the province, and resumed their labours again last year, Mr. Blanford proposing to traverse the desert to Jessulmir and Jodhpur. Mr. Fedden has made an excellent collection of fossils. During the summer Mr. Blanford was engaged in working out the collections of the late Dr. Stoliczka from Yarkand for publication, and in arranging those brought from Sind. A full sketch of the results is given in the Records. Mr. Blanford seems to have established the existence, in addition to the more recent and sub-recent deposits, of pliocene, miocene, and eocene age rocks, all of which had previously been roughly grouped into old tertiary. In some places, again, there are still lower beds, the exact geological age of which is not fixed, but which partly at least are probably cretaceous. Mr. Willson has continued his work in the Bundelcund and Re wah country, and Mr. Hacket has been engaged first in Raj putana, and subsequently Ulwar. During the entire season Mr. Hughes was engaged in working up the geological maps of the Chanda country, with especial view to the coal-fields of the Wardah valley. During the season of 1875-6 he took up the continuation of the same geological area to the south, and it is hoped that he will be able to join on his work to that of Mr. King, who is extend ing his examination from the south up the valley of the Godavery. Mr. Ball completed his researches in the Raigarh and Hingir coal-field,1 and published a notice of it in the Records. During the following season he has been engaged in a revision of the Atgurh sandstones. Dr. Feistmantel, who recently joined the survey, has commenced the description of a history of the fossil flora of Cutch, which Dr. Oldham considers will prove of great value and interest. In spite of severe indisposition Mr. King has continued his ex amination of the Godavery district, wliile in the Nellore and Ongole country Mr. Eoote succeeded in mapping a good area of the coast region. During the recess Mr. Foote completed a valuable report 1 See Abstract for 1873-4, p. 24."], [271, "PUBLICATIONS of geological survey. 27 on the Southern Mahratta country, and in the season of 1875-6 he was to continue to work northwards so as to join on to the God avery and Rajahmundry areas. During the year under review, Vol. XL, Part 2, of the Memoirs was issued, containing a detailed description of the salt-producing country in the Kohat district, Trans-Indus. The Records were published quarterly as usual, and the following papers in them claim notice: On the \"Altum Artush\" by the late F. Stoliczka ; a note on the Geology of Nepal, by Mr. Medlicott ; on the Khareean Hills in the Punjab by Mr. Wynne ; a sketch of the geology of Scindia's territories; a full sketch of the Shapur coal-fields with notices on the explorations in progress in the Nerbuda valley for coal; also an account of the Raigarh and Hingir coal-field by Mr. Ball ; while the directly practical bearings of geological research are illustrated by Mr. W. Blanford's paper on the water-bearing strata of Surat, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Medlicott on fire bricks, Mr. Mallet on coal measures near Hoflong, &c. Of the Pal\u0153ontologia Indica the publication of the Jurassic Cephalopoda of Cutch has been completed and issued, though the preparation of the numerous plates occasioned much delay. Dr. Oldham considers that this is unquestionably one of the most valuable contributions to the fossil history of the series ever issued. Good progress has been made in the preparation of plates for the next issue, which will be devoted to the fossil flora of Cutch. Dr. Waagen, the pal\u00e6ontologist, has unfortunately been compelled to resign his appointment, chiefly through ill-health contracted in his public labours, but arrangements have been made by which he will work up for publication the description of the fossils collected by him in the Trans-Indus region. Dr. Oldham, the accomplished head of the survey, has resigned his post after a long and arduous career of over twenty years. Before commencing his service in India he had been on. the Irish Survey, and was Professor of Geology at Trinity College, Dublin. A statement of his services will be found at page 165 of the Memoir on Indian Surveys1 and in the succeeding Abstracts. He was the first to establish the plan of steadily mapping out the country from east to west, and to set his face against the desultory method of sending geologists about from place to place to report on fancied discoveries of minerals. The abundant materials which have been 1 First Edition. C"], [272, "arch\u00e6ological surveys. 28 collected during his administration will render the publication of a general map of the geology of India a comparatively easy task. Dr. Oldham has been succeeded in the superintendentship by Mr. H. B. Medlicott, M.A., F.G.S., CE. VI. Arch\u00e6ological Surveys of India. During the past year no report of General Cunningham's opera - tions has been received in England. The last report received is still Vol. V. of the series, dealing with the researches in the Punjab during the season 1872-3, and reviewed in last year's \" Abstract,\" pp. 26 et seq. The Secretary of State has drawn the attention of the Govern ment of India to the fact that in the scheme originally prepared for the conduct of this survey it was provided that an annual narration of the progress of operations should be submitted to Government, whereas hitherto the object appears to have been to submit only detailed descriptions and discussions of results accompanied by illustrations, which works have of necessity appeared much in arrears. The second volume1 of Mr. Burgess's report dealing with his arch\u00e6ological investigations in Kattywar and Cutch has been issued in England during the year 1876. A notice of these re searches will be found in the Abstract for 1873-4, pp. 41-44. The first . chapter is devoted to Ahmedabad and its structures ; the second, to Kattywar or Kathiawad, the Xavpats-rp^vri of the Greeks and Romans and Sorath of the Muhammadans, the ancient geo graphy and history of which is expounded ; the third chapter, one of considerable importance and some length, is by Mr. E. Thomas, F.R.S., &c., on the Sah and Gupta coins obtained from Kathiawad by Mi*. Burgess. Mr. Thomas has enlarged the scope of the chapter to the extent of collating the extraneous data bearing on the history of the dynasty, viz., inscriptions, written history, tradition, and coins. The fourth chapter is devoted to an account of the Valabhi dynasty, including a brief notice of Hwen Tsang's visit to Valabhi 1 Arch\u00e6ological Survey of Western India.

The celebrated rock inscription of Asoka as well as the Sail or Rudra Dama and the Skandagupta inscriptions at Junagadh form the subject of the sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters. The caves at Junagadh and the temples of Mount Girnar are then dealt with, and these are followed by descriptions of the royal tombs at Junagadh, of the temples at Ghumli or Bhumli and Gop, and of the beautiful palace at Jamnagar, a very noticeable photo graph of which is given. An interesting account of Kachh or Cutch (which has hitherto been an unworked field to the anti quarian), its geography, modern and ancient, its people and history, is to be found in chapter XV., and the remainder of the volume is occupied with descriptions of the towns in Kachh and Gujarat visited by Mr. Burgess. Translations of inscriptions from Belgaum and Kaladgi, by Mr. J. F. Fleet, of the Bombay Civil Service, are given in an appendix to the work, which is illustrated by 74 plates. Mr. Burgess has also prepared a document of much utility with a view to meeting the recommendations of those who in 1873 urged upon the Secretary of State the necessity of adopting systematic measures for the preservation of historic monuments in India. This paper consists of a series of provisional lists of the antiquities throughout the different collectorates of the Bombay Presidency, Kattywar, Guzerat, the Central Provinces, and Berar. The lists are compiled from various sources, and largely from native reports, but after being widely circulated and enriched with such information as can be supplied by the local officers they will prove a valuable guide to the arch\u00e6ologist, to the compilers of the Gazetteers, and many others. Mr. Burgess appends a list of queries, drawing attention to the chief heads of information required in regard to every object of antiquity. These heads consist of the following: exact locality, work, age, style, size, character, and particulars of the inscriptions. When this information has been all collected it will be possible for the arch\u00e6ologist to draw up a classification of the various monu ments, showing which should, in the first place, be kept up in permanent repair by Government; secondly, which should be rescued from further decay, but which would need only occasional subsequent attention; and, lastly, those of which, either from their advanced stage of decay or comparative unimportance, it is im possible or unnecessary to undertake the preservation, but of which a record is desirable. c 2"], [274, "30 MADRAS ARCH\u00c6OLOGY.

The suggested appointment of Dr. Burnell has been rejected by the Government of India, and a proposal made to postpone further consideration of the matter. This decision is to be deplored, as the deterioration of monumental records in Southern India is extremely rapid. Even in the absence of a regular organized survey, pre liminary steps, such as the preparation of lists of monuments and antiquities, similar to those drawn up by Mr. Burgess and referred to above, might be undertaken with great advantage. During the last three cold seasons (1872-5) copies have been made by Mr. Griffiths, decorative artist, and students of the Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy School, of the celebrated paintings in the Ajanta Cave temples. The original paintings themselves have been much damaged by damp and by animals infesting the caves, chiefly through the neglect to provide sooner doors and shutters to the apertures in the caves. This precaution has now been taken, and has been found to answer well. The copies of the paintings have been deposited in the India Museum, and will in some measure replace the valuable copies taken by Major Gill under the orders of the Honourable Court of Directors, and destroyed in the fire at the Crystal Palace. VII. Indian Meteorology and the Madras Observatory. The recent re-organization of the Indian Meteorological Depart ment, referred to in last year's Abstract, pp. 45 et seq., has delayed the submission of the usual Bengal Meteorological Report for 1875. As, however, under the new system the local reports will be sum marized, digested, and reviewed in the general report of the Meteoro logical Reporter to the Government of India, the chief interest will henceforth centre in this latter production. Mr. Blanford pro poses to deal with the year 1875 as a commencement of the new scheme by which attempts are to be made to deduce generalized conclusions from the basis of local observations. This report is understood to be in preparation. The reports received in England during the past year (1876), comprise the following : \u2014"], [275, "METEOROLOGY IN BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 31 Report on the Government Observatory, Colaba, for the year ending 30th June 1876 : Administration Report of the Meteorological Reporter for the Bombay Presidency, Rajputana, and Berar for 1875-6 : Reports on meteorological observations in the North-West Pro vinces for 1874, Punjab for 1874, Hyderabad assigned districts for 1874, Mysore for 1874, and Oudh for 1875-6. The regular series of magnetical and meteorological observations, amounting to five per diem, were continued regularly at the Colaba Observatory during the year 1875-6. The first assistant at the Observatory, Mr. F. Chambers, was appointed on the 17th November 1875 to fill the new office of Meteorological Reporter for Bombay, and he has taken the opportunity to give in his Administration Report for 1875-6, a brief history of previous endeavours to pro secute geographical meteorology in the Bombay Presidency. The first attempt at systematic registration at provincial stations in the Bombay Presidency was made in 1851 at twelve principal stations of European troops. These observations were made under the superintendence of the senior medical officer by hospital assistants trained at the Bombay Observatory. The training was, however, generally speaking, of a very imperfect nature, the in struments incomplete and seldom verified, and the entries of ten questionable. In 1852 a new impetus was given by the trans mission of five complete sets of new and verified instruments from England, which were located at Belgaum, Poona, Bombay, Deesa, and Karachi. It was hoped by the Board of Directors that the zeal and energy of the medical officers and their love of science would suffice for the due registration of the observations without the entailment of any public expenditure. This arrangement, however, would not work, and in 1856, two European soldiers, previously trained at the Observatory, Avere told off for service at each station, on a salary of Rs. 25 per mensem; and this marks the commencement of thorough and trustworthy registration. The programme comprised observations on the following meteorological phenomena at 9.30 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. : Barometric pressure, temperature of air and evaporation, direction and pressure of the wind, extent of cloudy sky, remarks on the weather and dew-point by Daniell's and Regnault's hygrometers. The following observa tions were taken once a day : Maxima and minima of the ther mometer in the sun aud on the grass, maxima and minima of the c 3"], [276, "32 BOMBAY METEOROLIGAL WORK. air and of evaporation, amount of rainfall, with two gauges, and of ozone. Besides the foregoing, on the 21st of each month, obser vations of the first seven phenomena were taken at each of the twenty-four hours. Of these different observations, Mr. F. Chambers remarks that those on evaporation and ozone are, judging from the present standpoint of meteorological science, probably unnecessary, while instruments for measuring the velocity of the wind instead of its pressure have recently come into use, besides more sensitive wind vanes than were formerly used. Nevertheless, provision was made for securing a very complete and correct registration of observations, but owing to the very different way in which the instruments were exposed, a comparison of the registers was impracticable. Mr. F. Chambers remarks that the chief reforms which the new Reporter for Bombay, Rajputana, and the Berars will have to see to, will be to secure, firstly, greater uniformity in the mode of exposing the thermometric instruments ; secondly, new wind in struments erected in perfectly exposed and unobstructed sites ; and thirdly, improved hygrometers. It is also very desirable that an attempt should be made to give absolute value to the old obser vations by a redetermination of the errors of the instruments, of which most of the important ones are still uninjured. Besides the five observatories at Bombay, Belgaum, Poona, Deesa, and Karachi, there are to be started fourteen others of the thn-d class, i.e., where only two complete sets of observations daily are to be recorded. The observers will have no calculations to make, but only to register readings of the instruments at stated times, and for this extra work they are to receive Rs. 15 per mensem. The inspection of the instruments and observing stations being a matter of considerable importance, Mr. F. Chambers made it his duty on being first appointed Meteorological Reporter to bring the existing observatories into working order. He took with him a set of portable instruments which had been previously compared with all the standards at the Observatory with a view to determine the errors of the local instruments in use. Poona, Sholapur, Belgaum, Vingorla, Goa (where the co-operation of the Portuguese Government was secured), and Ratnagiri were visited. On Mr. Chambers' return to Bombay the travelling barometers were compared with the Colaba standard, and the errors were found"], [277, "MR. C. CHAMBERS ON BOMBAY METEOROLOGY. 33 to be the same as at starting. At the end of January 1876, Mr. Chambers commenced a tour from Bombay to Karachi, through Sind to the Upper Sind frontier district, and back through Cutch and Kattywar. Mr. Chambers remarks of his inspection tours that among the advantages secured by them may be mentioned the determination of the instrumental -errors, and the conversion of observations for past years into absolute measures of the various phenomena re corded, rescuing them by this means from the stigma of doubt. The improvements required at each station have been brought to light, the best sites for stations have been selected, and local defects have been avoided. An important paper on \" The Meteorology of the Bombay Presi dency \" has been completed during the year 1876 by Mr. Charles Chambers, F.R.S., Superintendent of the Colaba Observatory, and has been presented .by the author to the Royal Society with a view to publication. The work consists of four parts \u2014 the first dealing with registrations of meteorological phenomena at the Colaba Observatory during a period of twenty-seven years; the second with moderately full observations at five military stations in the Bombay Presidency during a period of nineteen years; and the third with large numbers of observations from civil hospitals and revenue stations, being those of selected registers extending over various periods from not less than a fortnight up to a number of years ; in this part the phenomena treated are temperature of the air, winds, and rainfall only, and the extent of territory to which the observations refer includes the whole of the Presidency, Sind, and the western half of Rajputana. In the fourth part are dis cussed the general distribution (as regards both space and season) of temperature and rainfall, and the variations of the wind ; first with respect simply to the physical geography of the country, and then in combination with certain theoretical views, the elucidation of which, by means of the dynamical theory of heat and the kinetic theory of gases, occupies much space. Nearly half the memoir is devoted to the work of the Colaba Observatory, of the history of which a short sketch is given. The design of this part is to give a compendious account of the results of a long and continuous maintenance of the Observatory, both in the shape of numerical determinations of meteorological elements and of their periodical and other variations, and in throwing light by means of these upon the physical conditions and actions which c 4"], [278, "34 INDIAN METEOROLOGICAL MEMOIRS. give rise to the observed relations between different phenomena, and to the variation of these relations with time. In the course of the work the author introduces several new modes of picturing clearly to the mind, and of representing graphi cally, the general results of the various phenomena observed ; he also develops a theory of aerial circulation, including a dynamical theory of convection currents, which is original, and, so far as he knows, put forth now for the first time. Of the report of Mr. Elliott on meteorological observations in the North-West Provinces for 1874, Mr. Blanford observes of it, that, judged both by an absolute standard and by comparison with all previous reports, it is one of high merit, and that much has been done towards making the observations of past years worthy of some confidence. In the case of the Punjab, Oudh, and Berar observations, from various causes, the records are pronounced by Mr. Blanford as of little trustworthiness. A useful new serial publication has been issued by Mr. Blanford, under the name of \" Indian Meteorological Memoirs,\" being occa sional discussions and compilations of meteorological data relating to India and the neighbouring countries. It is not intended to issue the parts at fixed dates, but papers accepted for publication will be printed and issued as expeditiously as circumstances will admit of. The work is designed as a vehicle for publication of such portions of the work of the meteorological officers as do not form part of the regular Annual Report on the Meteorology of India. Thus descriptions of local climates, of important and unusual phenomena, and of investigations in meteorological physics', will more fitly find place in the present serial. Part I. of the first volume contains three papers, viz., (1) on the winds of Calcutta, (2) on the meteorology and climate of Yarkand and Kashghar, being chiefly a discussion of registers kept by Dr. Scully during his deputation with the Mission in 1871-5, and (3) on the diurnal variation of the barometer at Simla. Madras Observatory. An inquiry was made last year into the operations of the Madras Observatory for the past thirteen years, with the view of ascertain ing the actual work done both in observations and reductions. A catalogue of about 2,200 stars observed between 1853 and 1858, and chiefly selected from Taylor's Madras Catalogue and that of the"], [279, "MADRAS OBSERVATORY. 35 British Association, still awaits completion. There are also obser vations of the sun, moon, principal and minor planets, of Donati's comet of 1868, the mean places of the 144 Nautical Almanac stars from 1853 to 1858, observations of Mars at the oppositions of 1854 and 1856, of moon culminations for longitude, and a long list of occultations of planets and fixed stars and of the phenomena of Jupiter's satellites, which complete the old astronomical arrears previous to 1861. With the exception of the minor planets, Donati's comet, and the occultations, all these observations are reduced and ready for press. In 1861 the equatoreal by Messrs. Lerebours and Secretan was used to good advantage by the discovery and observation on fourteen nights of the planet Asia. These observations were at once reduced and printed in the Astfonomische Nachrichten. A conspicuous comet, which appeared very suddenly in July, as well as the Solar Eclipse and the Transit of Mercury in the same year, were duly observed. In 1862 the new trausit-circle was completed and brought into use ; and the equatoreal wrork was heavy, comprising the refinding of Asia on her first return to opposition after discovery, observations of the comet for which the year was memorable, and of Encke's comet. The first of a series of measurements of the planet Mars when in opposition, by differences of right ascension from adjacent stars near his rising and setting, wras taken in September and October, and 49 observations were secured, but no final reduc tion of them has been effected up to the present. The object of this operation is to correct the value of the solar parallax on the sun's mean distance from the earth. The repetition of these measurements at successive oppositions of Mars is an important work, and it can be carried out to the best advantage at a tropical observatory like Madras. In 1863 the new transit-circle was in full work, and satisfactory results were obtained throughout the year. The year 1864 was a pre-eminently successful one as regards the general work of the Observatory. The maximum number of obser vations with the transit- circle was attained, viz., 2,681. With the equatoreal the planet Freia was detected ; but the supposition of its being a new planet was dissipated by the calculation of its orbital elements, which proved it to be identical with the one discovered by Professor D'Arrest at Copenhagen in 1861. Another new planet (Sappho) was discovered and its orbit calculated. The planet Mars"], [280, "36 WORK AT MADRAS OBSERVATORY. being again in opposition in November, a second series of differential right ascensions was observed, for investigation of the solar parallax. The new equatoreal by Messrs. Troughton and Sims was received early in 1864, but the dome under which it had to be used had to be removed for the officers of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, to enable them to fix surrounding stations with the centre of the Madras transit-circle. On completion of these operations the re- construction of the dome was undertaken on improved principles. The chief event of the year 1866 was the mounting of the new equatoreal ; and of 1868, the total eclipse of the sun on August 18th, one of the chief results of the Masulipatam Expedition being the detection of bright lines in the solar corona. The third series of measurements of Mars for investigation of the solar parallax was made with the new equatoreal in February 1869, and though the opposition was by no means a favourable one, the stability of the instrument gave the observations a weight to which the two former series in 1862 and 1864 with the old equatoreal could lay no claim. The observations of D'Arrest's periodical comet wrere the operations of principal interest in 1870. An ingenious electrical discharging apparatus for firing the Fort gun as a time signal was also adopted. The year 1871 was one of heavy extraneous work. A fourth series of observations of Mars at the opposition in March and April was made with the new equatoreal as in 1869. The laying of the submarine cable to Singapore led to the necessary obser vations being secured for determining the longitude between Madras, Singapore, and Batavia. The central shadow path of another total eclipse of the sun across the Presidency on 12th December led to the equipment of several local expeditions, as also of some from England, France, and Germany. The station selected for the Government Observatory party was Avenashy iu the Coimbatore district. Three successful pictures of the totality were obtained, showing the corona and other phenomena. The annular eclipse of the sun on 6th June yielded results equal if not superior in interest to those of the total eclipse expeditions.. Four good photographs where taken of the annular phase. Two obser vations of Biela's comet were taken under unusual circumstances, after a period of eighteen years, during which it had been given up as a lost or annihilated comet. In 1873 the meridian circle was used exclusively for star places, to complete the catalogue in hand."], [281, "GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION. 37 A fifth and more favourable series of Mars observations was taken in April and May with the new equatoreal. The year 1874-5 was devoted to finishing works in hand and preparing them for publication, rather than to accumulating more observations. Considerable progress has been made in this direction, and it is anticipated that ere long arrears of every kind will be completely cleared off. The Star Catalogue, which is being made by means of the meridian circle, is very nearly finished. The observation of the transit of Venus was a failure at Madras owing to cloudy weather; but valuable aid to observers at Karachi, Muddapore, and Roorkee was rendered by means of telegraphic determinations of longitude. The transmission of Madras mean time to every Government telegraph station daily at 4 p.m. has been continued throughout the last-mentioned year, and the telegraph to the Master At tendant's Office for weather warnings was serviceable during three stormy periods. VIII. Geographical Exploration, 1873-5. The geographical explorations carried on beyond the British frontier during the two years above mentioned have been unusually important, besides the valuable results derived from the Yarkand Mission referred to in last year's Abstract. The Havildar who had been deputed to survey unknown portions of the head-waters of the Oxus, and the Pundit who had been instructed to survey the direct road from Ladakh to Lhasa, both returned to the head quarters at Dehra almost simultaneously, and brought each numerous journals, records of astronomical observations, and route surveys, which Captain Trotter, who was on the point of returning to England, volunteered, by remaining in India, to put into shape for publication. The \" Report on the Trans-Himalayan Explora tions during 1873-4-5\" has, however, not appeared up to the present date (February 1877), though it is possible that the narrative of the journey of the Pundit through Tibet with its accompanying observations and map may be published separately. The brief abstract accounts of these journeys given in Colonel Walker's report enable us to summarize the results."], [282, "havildar's journey about the upper oxus. 38 The Havildar, who is well known for his journey in 1870 from Peshawur through Chitral to Badakshan, started from Kabul in the guise of a travelling merchant on the 3rd November 1873, and struck at once northwards, instead of taking the more circuitous and westerly route by the Bamian Pass. He crossed the Hindu Kush range by the Sar-ulang Pass, and passing Khinjan took the direct north-easterly route by Narin and Ishkamish to Faizabad on the Kokcha in Badakshan, the greater part of which route had never before been surveyed. Thence he turned westward to Rustak, and from thence due north to Kolab, crossing the Oxus at Samti, which is the point above which the river assumes the name of Pan j ah instead of Amu. His instructions were to ascend the stream, keeping closely to its course, but as this would have led him away from the main roads and awakened suspicion, he had to stick to the frequented roads, and accordingly proceeded via Khuwalin and Sagri-Dasht to Kila Khumb (the capital of Darwaz), where he again struck the river at the northernmost point of the bend in its course through the mountains between its rise in the Pamir and its downward plunge into the plains of Kolab and Badakshan. From Kila Khumb the Havildar advanced for a distance of about 50 miles in a south-easterly direction along the bank of the river, making a detour to Kila Wanj en route, this being apparently in order to avoid having to follow the path along the river, which, in many places where the cliffs are perpendicular, consists of supports of rope attached to iron pegs driven into the face of the rock. The traveller makes his way along with his feet on the rope supports, while he holds on to the pegs with his hands. The Havildar finally reached Yazghulam, the frontier village of Darwaz. Here he was most unfortunately turned back, under orders from the Khan of Darwaz. Thus his exploration of the Upper Oxus was stopped at the distance of about a day's journey from Pigish, the lowest point reached by Captain Trotter's native surveyor from the opposite direction just two months previously. Being very anxious to complete his survey of the bend of the river, and being ignorant of what the other explorer had done, the Havildar returned to Faizabad by his former route, and thence proceeded to Ishkashim, the point where the Oxus makes its bend, whence he followed the river for about 35 miles, but was then again stopped, this time by the guards on the Shignan frontier. There is thus a gap of about 20 miles between the work of the"], [283, "the mullah's journey. 39 Havildar from the west and that of Captain Trotter's agent from the east, which is much to be regretted ; but on the other hand it is a matter of congratulation that so large a portion of the course of the Oxus, which was unknown when that river was adopted as the northern boundary of Afghanistan by the British and Russian governments, has now become clearly defined. Being unable to complete the survey of the river, the Havildar returned to Kolab, and from thence struck westward through regions north of the Oxus, of the geography of which very little was known. His route determines the position of the important town of Kubadian, and proves that the Surkh-ab river (also called the river of Karatigin, Kizil-su, or Waksh-ab), which rises in the Alai plateau, south of Khokand, joins the Oxus not near Kolab, as has long been supposed, but a point about 80 miles lower down. His route survey was carried southwards from Kubadian, crossing the Oxus at the Aiwaj ferry (probably the Swachik of some maps), down to Khulm, from whence he travelled eastward to Rostak, where he had left some property, and thence back to India by the Bamian Pass and Kabul. The Havildar's explorations in Kolab and Kubadian cover part of the ground traversed by the Russian expedition to Hissar in the summer of 1875, and the longitudes and latitudes of those two towns as determined astronomically by the Russians agree very fairly with the positions as deduced from the Havildar's previous work at those places. A second connecting link has thus been obtained between the British and Russian Surveys in Central Asia. The Mullah, a man of good education, had accompanied the Havildar as far as Jalalabad, from which place he started on the 28th September 1873 with the object of ascending the Kunar river as far as its source in the Hindu Kush range. He was enabled to follow the course of the river as far as Asmar, but from that point to Mirkandi had to make a detour, as the Khan of Asmar was at war with the neighbouring Kaffir tribes. He therefore made his way over the hills on the left bank of the river to Janbatai, a place on the Havildar's route in 1870 from the Punjab in Badakshan, which route the Mullah followed as far as Chitral. At Chitral he was detained some time, but eventually managed to be allowed to make for Sarhadd Wakhan, and thus struck into new ground. He ascended the course of the river, via Mastuj up to the Baroghil Pass, which he crossed, and descended to Sarhadd-i- Wakhan, the"], [284, "THE PUNDIT'S JOURNEY IN TIBET. 40 position of which had been fixed by Captain Trotter. The Mullah's work was very carefully executed, and shows that the positions of Dir and Chitral as given by the Havildar must be altered by a few miles. It gives the entire length of the Kunar river with the exception of a length of 25 miles above Asmar. The journey performed by the Pundit Nain Sing is among the most important, as regards geographical discovery, that has been made in the present century. For the first time the vast lacustrine plateau of Tibet has been traversed by an educated traveller, who was able to take observations and describe what he saw ; and thus a great increase has been made to our scanty knowledge of Tibet. Nain Sing, a native of the mountainous district of Milam in Kumaon, is the chief among the natives trained by Colonel Mont gomerie, and his travels beyond the Himalaya have won for him a place in the foremost rank of Asiatic explorers. His geographical labours were commenced upwards of twenty years ago. He was first in the service of Captains H. and R. Strachey, and then in that of Messrs. Schlagintweit, in Kashmir and Ladak, during 1856 and 1857. He then joined the Education Department, and was head master of a Government vernacular school in his native district of Milam from 1858 to 1863. In the latter year Colonel Montgomerie trained him as an explorer, and he has since been constantly employed in the department of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. His famous journey to Lhasa, in 1865 and 1866, earned for him the reward of a gold watch from the Royal Geographical Society. In 1867 he visited the Tibetan gold mines of Thok- Jalung, and in 1873 he accompanied the mission of Sir Douglas Forsyth to Yarkand. In July 1873 Pundit Nain Sing set out from Leh on his final and most important journey, to cross the plateau of Tibet to Lhasa, and thence to make his way down into Assam. Nain Sing reached Tankse, near the frontier, on the 21st of July, and entered Tibet, at Chagra, as a Lama professing to be goino* on a pilgrimage to a temple near Rudok. At first he followed the Cbang-chenmo road to Yarkand, crossing the Marsemik-la at a height of 18,420 feet above the sea, and then turned to the east by a route over the Kin-la, which is still higher than the Marsemik, reaching Noh, a small village of the Rudok district. The progress was slow, as all baggage is carried by sheep, 20 to 25 lbs. each, which are never fed, and live on the pasturage by the road-side. Yet, out of the twenty-six which originally started from Tankse,"], [285, "THE PUNDIT'S JOUBNEY IN TIBET. 41 four arrived at Lhasa, having carried then- loads over a distance of a thousand miles. The region travelled over from Tankse to Noh is the northern portion of Nari, or Western Tibet. At this western corner of the plateau the road to Khotan rises to 15,500 feet in 40 miles, and then descends rather abruptly to the plains of Eastern Turkistan. Seven miles east of Noh is the eastern termination of the Pangong series of lakes, which is a hundred miles long. The Pundit determined this eastern limit for the first time ; audit is remarkable that the Pangong consists of sweet drinkable water at the east extremity, while the west end is very brackish. The Pangong is the most westerly of the system of inland lakes to which the drainage of the vast river plateau of Tibet converges for a distance of 800 miles. From Noh the road eastward over the plateau passes along a wide grassy valley, with occasional shepherd's huts, and large herds of wild asses, antelopes, and gigantic sheep {Ovis ammon). Large sheets of water were frequently met with, generally salt, but occa sionally fed by fresh-water streams. The plateau is at an elevation of from 13,700 to 15,000 feet above the sea. This western portion is inhabited by Kampas, a tribe which emigrated from eastern Tibet about a quarter of a century ago. The Pundit describes them as fine broad-shouldered men, well armed, and dressed in sheep-skin coats, felt hats, and leather boots with curved pointed toes. They are great sportsmen, and both men and women are constantly in the saddle. Their black tents are made of yaks' hair ; they manufacture a very coarse kind of woollen cloth, and live on meat, butter, cheese, milk, and a Httle flour to thicken their soup. On the 17th of September the Pundit reached the gold-fields of Thok-Daurakpa, which are not so important as those of Thok- Jalung, which he visited in 1867. There are also two smaUer diggings, called Tang- j ong and Sarka-Shyar, further east, the whole under the superintendence of an officer from Lhasa, with the title of Sarpon. The whole yield of gold, about 8,000Z. a year, is sent to Gartokh, whence it finds its way to the sea. Continuing his journey over the plateau, the Pundit traversed elevated plains for many marches, covered with velvet turf, and fre quented by countless herds of antelopes. To the south were the snowy peaks of the northern Himalayan range (Gangdis-ri), which"], [286, "THE PUNDIT'S JOURNEY IN TIBET. 42 the Pundit traced for a distance of 180 miles. The highest, called Targot-yap, is 25,000 feet above the sea. Our traveller was in formed that to the south of the range there was a river called Hota-Sangpo, which ultimately turned north into the Kyaring Lake. At the foot of the northern slope of Targot-yap there is a lake called Dangra-yum, and on its banks is the district of Nakchang Ombo, surrounded by snowy mountains. Here there are several villages of stone houses, and barley is extensively cultivated. It is remarkable that, although this district of Ombo is at nearly as great an elevation as the rest of the plateau, it is the only place where there is any cultivation from Chabuk Zinga, at a distance of 35 marches on one side, to Lhasa, a distance of 39 marches on the other. The elevation of Ombo is 15,240 feet. The inhabitants have a tradition that many centuries ago a great and powerful Gyalpo or king lived at Ombo and reigned over the whole of the Hor country. He was overcome by tbe Gyalpo of Lhasa. Thence to the great Lake of Tengri-nor or Namchu the country is 15,000 to 16,000 feet above the sea ; the drainage being from the mountains separating the plateau from the valley of the Brahma putra, to the north, into a vast system of land-locked lakes discovered by the Pundit. All these lakes are new to geographers, with the exception of Tengri-nor. The largest is the Dangra-yum- cho, which is 45 miles long by 25 broad, and the Kyaring-cho is 40 miles by 8 to 12. These lakes are well stocked with fish, and frequented by myriads of wild fowl. The Pundit passed along the northern shore of Tengri-nor, and thence followed the track of the former Pundit of 18721 to Lhasa, which city he reached on the 18th of November. Nain Sing, owing to well-grounded fear of detection, only remained two days at Lhasa on this occasion, and went thence to the ancient monastery of Sama-ye-gonpa, where the images of the temple are of pure gold, and which contains a large Buddhistic library. This is probably the Sawe mentioned in his former account. He continued his journey for two days down the course of the Brahmaputra, and crossed it at the lowest known point on its upper course, where it is 500 yards wide and 20 feet deep, with a very sluggish current. He arrived at a large town called Chetang, on the right bank, 1 See Abstract for 1873-4."], [287, "RETIREMENT OF THE PUNDIT. 43 where there are two monasteries and 700 lamas, and here he made out that the Brahmaputra continued its eastward course for 30 miles, and then turned south-east. At Chetang the route ascended the valley of the Yelung, a tributary of the Brahmaputra, on its right bank, which flows through and a rich fertile valley where there are fruit trees and large patches of wheat and barley. After 36 miles the Dalatang plain is reached, a grassy expanse stretching for 15 miles to the Karkang-la, a pass over the central chain of the Himalaya, 16,210 feet above the sea. Seventy miles to the south, over a lofty region, brought the traveller to the Kya-kya Pass, leading down into the Tawang valley, on the southern slopes of the southern chain. Here, at Chona-jong, in the Chukhang valley, there is a great exchange mart, where the Tibetan merchants meet those from Assam. The market, at its height, contains several hundred shops. The Pundit was detained in Tawang for some months, and eventually reached Odalguri in Assam on the 1st, and Calcutta on the 11th of March 1875. This really magnificent exploring achievement has yielded rich and valuable geographical results. The distance from the Pangong Lake, by Lhasa, to Odalguri, is 1,319 miles of previously unknown country, except for a very short distance traversed by the Pundit of 1872 ; 1,200 miles were entirely unknown ; and the whole extent was traversed with bearings and facings, 276 astronomical obser vations were taken for latitude, and 497 for elevation above the sea. The eastern extremity of the Pangong Lake was settled, a system of numerous lakes and rivers was discovered, the existence of the vast snowy range of the northern Himalaya (Gangdis-ri) was clearly demonstrated, several peaks were fixed, 30 miles of the Brahmaputra was discovered, .and the Tawang route from Tibet to India was surveyed. Nain Sing, though little past the prime of life, has become enfeebled by exposure in Tibet and other trying climates, and has been compelled to give up the public service. His arduous and brilliant services have, however, not been allowed to pass unnoticed. The Paris Geographical Society have awarded him a gold watch, and the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Govern ment of India, has sanctioned the grant to him of a village in Rohilkund, with a jumina of Rs. 1,00Q. n"], [288, "STATISTICAL SURVEY OF INDIA. 44 IX. Statistical Survey of India, New Gazetteers and other Publications. The Statistical Survey of India, organised under the general direction of Dr. W. W. Hunter, has now been in progress upwards of five years, and the statistical accounts of the different presidencies and provinces have so far approached completion as to enable the new Imperial Gazetteer of India to be commenced on the 1st of February 1877. Dr. Hunter has prepared an interesting report1 on the subject, which deserves a somewhat extended notice. The organisation of a Statistical Survey of India was sanctioned by Lord Mayo in 1869 ; but during the century preceding there had been numerous efforts after the same object, and the results of these different surveys formed a vast storehouse of unpublished information scattered over different provinces. In Bengal the first effort of this sort, dated from 1769, or precisely one century before Dr. Hunter's investigations commenced. For Madras a magnificent series of 200 manuscript folios, known as the Orme Collection, was compiled between 1740 and 1770, and, with the exception of portions utilized in Orrne's two printed volumes, remains inedited to this clay. The Bombay Government created a distinct department, and Colonel Sykes, as Statistical Reporter, drew up a mass of papers, which, with previous documents, furnish a continuous picture of that presidency since the establishment of British rule. In the case of minor provinces like Mysore, Travancore, and Cochin, the investigations had been even more carefully carried out. In fact each conspicuous period of administrative improve ment or reform has left behind it the traces of a fresh inquiry into the state of the country. For instance, in 1769, when English officers were first appointed to the Bengal districts, the President in Council issued an elaborate circular, calling for information respecting the political, ethical, and social history of the province, after which an investigation of the land tenures was to follow, together with a list of the products of the country, an account of its commercial capabilities, and a report on the means of developing its internal resources. The 1 Quinquennial Report on the Statistical Survey of India. By W. W. Hunter, L.L.D., Director General of Statistics to the Government of India, 1876."], [289, "EARLY STATISTICAL INQUIRIES IN INDIA. 45 administration of Warren Hastings, which followed, was charac terised by great activity. Surveys were made in every part of the dominions, and isolated documents of great value were left behind. But the next conspicuous period of inquiry was during the years Avliich preceded the permanent settlement of 1793, and the con solidation of the company's rules of business into the Cornwallis Code. Unfortunately, these and the preceding researches remain inedited and unprinted. The modifications which the Cornwallis Code shortly required, and the revenue settlement of the North-West Provinces during the early years of the present century, again forced on the Court of Directors the necessity of a comprehensive investigation, and the instructions drawn up by the Government of India on receipt of the court's despatch show that the plan was well conceived. An account of each district was to be first prepared, with a notice of its topography, history, and climate. The condition of the people was next considered, the natural productions of the country \u2014 animal, vegetable, and mineral \u2014 the modes of tillage, implements of husbandry, breeds of cattle, and safeguards against floods. The size of the farms, the rates of wages, and, above all, the land tenures are selected for review, and the list concludes with the arts, manufactures, and commerce of Bengal. No attempt was made to cramp and confine the operations within a specified time, and a man of learning and ability was selected for the work. Yet the net result was that, after seven years, 30,000\u00a3. are said to have been spent, only a fragment of a single province had been surveyed, and not one page had been printed. The records of this survey form a series of 28 volumes, containing at least 10,000 pages of MS., which practically remained unutilised until 1872. During the next 40 years the work in Bengal seems to have been taken up at intervals by individual investigators, such as district officers. The only organised attempt during this period was made between 1836 and 1840 by the Medical Department, 21 separate branches of inquiry being laid down. Several of the papers thus obtained, such as (Dr. Taylor) Dacca and (Dr. John McCosh) Assam, were for many years the standard authorities on the districts of which they treat. This period of isolated efforts may be fitly concluded by the reports of some officers in Eastern Bengal, which were embodied, in 1868, into a volume, entitled \" Principal Heads of the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division.\" d 2"], [290, "Thornton's gazeteers. 46 In the meantime, the Court of Directors having failed to obtain from the Indian servants any comprehensive account of the terri tories under their care, had set on foot a distinct series of efforts of then own. They liberally encouraged works bearing on the subject, and as far back as 1828 a fair compilation, under the name of the \"East India Gazetteer,\" in two volumes, by Walter Hamilton, had reached a second edition. Ten works of this class in all were examined by Dr. Hunter, and comprised such works as \" Thornton's Gazetteer,\" \" Pharaoh's Gazetteer of Southern India,\" and \" Balfour's Cyclop\u00e6dia.\" \" Thornton's Gazetteer of the Territories under the Government of the East India Company and of the Native States on the Continent of India \" appeared in 1854 ; and though there are a great many grave defects in it, Dr. Hunter expresses his opinion that it has done more than any other work to impart to the English people a knowledge of their Indian dominions, and that it remains to this day one great source from which successive compilers draw, sometimes with scanty acknowledgment, the materials for our modern encyclop\u00e6dias and gazetteers. But \" Thornton's Gazetteer\" had one inherent fault, which was that it was not based on a systematic account of each of the geographical or political divisions of India, compiled district by district, and that, in the absence of systematic materials, the author had to depend upon the chance topography of tourists and historians. He brought great industry to bear on the subject, but the practical result is that while some petty hamlet, in which a traveller had halted a night, or any locality which formed the subject of official cor respondence, stands out in bold relief, important features of great districts are passed over without a word. The results being thus less satisfactory than had been hoped, interleaved copies of \" Thornton's Gazetteer\" were circulated among district officers, who were requested to supply all omissions. It was soon perceived, however, that to conduct a proper revision involved a complete rewriting of the work, for since 1854 a new history had been enacted in India, a new political geography had been formed, and a new system of government had been reared. Perceiving this, the local administrations began to strike out new plans for drawing up a statistical and geographical account of their territories. In March 1862 the Madras Government issued orders for a series of district manuals to be compiled by the local officers, which should exhibit that presidency in minute detail. Similar efforts were made in the"], [291, "47 STATISTICAL SURVEY UNDER DR. HUNTER. Central Provinces and in Bengal, and in October 1867 the local governments were addressed with a view to the extension of the operations throughout India. It soon, however, became evident that there being no uniform system and no central supervision, the expenditure might eventually be considerable without the desired results being obtained, especially as regarded securing comparable statistics. The Council of the Asiatic Society forcibly urged this view, which was concurred in by the Government of India ; and Dr. Hunter was accordingly directed to make arrangements for the systematic conduct of the future statistical operations, which were designed to extend over a territory of 1,556,836 square miles, inhabited by a population of 240 millions. The previous operations, from 1807 downwards, had endeavoured to attain per saltum a goal which could only be reached by many weary steps ; Dr. Hunter's system, on the other hand, consisted in the circulation of a number of \" Heads of Information required for the Imperial Gazetteer,\" which ensured a fair amount of uniformity of treatment and subject-matter. These materials have been gathered in, almost without cost, by enlisting the unpaid co-operation of district' officers and heads of departments throughout India. By appointing a provincial editor in each of the presidencies and provinces, central control has been localised ; while the Director General, by means of regular tours, has been enabled to exercise inspection and secure steady progress and fairly uniform execution of the wrhole. By this means provision was made for the statistical survey of the whole of British India, the Native States being alone excepted. The results, according to Dr. Hunter's report of last summer, which is the most recent information on the subject, are briefly as follows: As regards Bengal, which com prises 47 districts, the accounts of 41 have been already compiled, and the compilation of the remainder will be probably completed within six months. Of Assam, which now forms a chief commis sionership consisting of 12 districts, about half have been compiled. In these two provinces Dr. Hunter has acted as provincial compiler. In the North-West Provinces Mr. E. J. Atkinson has acted as compiler ; here four volumes, comprising 13 out of the 35 districts, have been printed, and the remainder are expected about the be-rinnin\u00b0- of 1878. The Punjab comprises 32 districts, of which the accounts have all been printed, and will probably be published within the current year. In Oudh the manuscript accounts of all d 3"], [292, "48 STATISTICAL ACCOUNTS OF DISTRICTS. the 12 districts has been -completed, and the whole is expected to be published next year. The \" Gazetteer of the Central Provinces\" was published in 1870, before the Census of 1872 had taken place. The more accurate statistics supphed by this will be incorporated into the Gazetteer under Dr. Hunter's eye. In Bombay and Sind, as in the North-West Provinces, the scale of the operations has been magnified, so that the time of completion of the whole of the statistical accounts is a matter of some uncertainty. The Gazetteer of Sind, by Mr. Hughes, however, has been published, comprising five out of the 24 districts of the Bombay Presidency. Mr. Campbell is provincial editor as regards the other districts. In Mysore and Coorg , the whole of the materials have been collected from the district officers, and although the checking of these materials has been a laborious task, owing to the imperfect means of communication, still all the four volumes comprising the nine districts will be completed before the end of the year. The system adopted in Madras dates as far back as 1862. Here each district is done separately, and there is no central officer or provincial editor appointed. The preparation of the \"District Manuals,\" as they are termed, thus proceeds but slowly, only five1 out of the total 21 having been as yet published in the course of 11 years. Of these the Vizagapatam Manual, by the Hon. D. F. Carmichael, is pronounced by Dr. Hunter to be a model of adminis trative information and local research. But much repetition is involved by the scheme of decentralisation thus adopted, and Dr. Hunter has found it necessary to stipulate for the supply of short digests or abstracts of the outstanding manuals, so as to enable the \"Imperial Gazetteer\" to be proceeded with without delay. In British Burmah \"the operations are somewhat of a tentative character, as many years must elapse before the information here permits of the elaborate completeness of the statistical accounts of the older British Provinces. But Captain Spearman, the provincial editor, has brought great industry and steadiness of purpose to his task, and the volumes embracing the whole of the fifteen districts are expected at no distant date, the MS. having been already com pleted. Mr. La Touche completed a statistical account of Ajmir and Mhairwara in 1874. Thus of the 233 districts of British India with which the 1 Vizagapatam, Madura, Nellore, Bellari, and Cuddapah."], [293, "ACCOUNTS OF NATIVE STATES. NEW IMPERIAL GAZETTEER. 49 operations deal, the statistical accounts of 162 have been already completed, while out of the twelve provinces into which British India is divided, the work in 10 is either completed or so far advanced as to hold out a fair prospect of completion within two years. No provision was made for the survey of Native States, but inasmuch as this was necessary for an Imperial Gazetteer, Dr. Hunter has taken measures for obtaining accounts of those under the local governments, such as the groups of Native States under the Bengal, North-West Provinces, Punjab Madras, and (more especially) the Bombay Governments. Those under the Foreign Office are more difficult of access, but for these Dr. Hunter purposes to base his accounts on the forthcoming new edition of Aitchison's \"Treaties and Engagements,\" as amplified and revised in the Calcutta Foreign Office. A collection of administrative reports by the political officers in charge of Native States will also be placed at Dr. Hunter's disposal, and these, combined with other papers in the Foreign Office, will enable a far more complete account of the Native States of India to be given than has, as yet, been attempted. As regards the French and Portuguese possessions, no considerable body of materials has been discovered by Dr. Hunter in the course of visits to Goa and Pondicherry, but some statistical accounts will be derived from the Annuaires and semi-official pubfications of the respective governments, and some fresh facts from materials in the Calcutta Foreign Office. The condensation of all these provincial accounts into the \" Imperial Gazetteer of India \" commenced, it is understood, on the 1st February 1877. This work will be designed primarily for the use of the controlling body in England\"; in the second place, for the use of Indian officials ; and thirdly, for the public at large. The general plan will be that of alphabetical arrangement of articles varying from a few lines to about twenty pages in length. The period of time which the preparation of this important work will occupy will probably be four years from February 1877. Owing to the great expense of literary compilation in India, the staff engaged in Scotland by Dr. Hunter for the purposes of the Bengal and Assam Gazetteers, will be retained by him for the preparation of the \" New Imperial Gazetteer.\" The cost is estimated at an aggregate of 3,000/. (for four years) as against 6,500/. (for from four to six years) which would have been the cost in India. d 4"], [294, "50 UNIFORM ORTHOGRAPHY OF INDIAN NAMES. The \" New Imperial Gazetteer \" will represent a series of local inquiries and comparative statistics spread over an area but little less than that of all Europe excepting Russia. It forms the neces sary complement of the great Indian surveys, trigonometrical and topographical, which have been in operation for nearly a hundred years. The great difference between it and \" Thornton's Gazetteer \" (the only work in any way comparable with it) has been already in dicated above ; and the elaboration and care bestowed on the preparatory arrangements, as well as the abilities and experience of the editor, afford a guarantee that the execution of the work will be commensurate with its importance. In close connexion with the Statistical Survey of India is the subject of a uniform orthography of Indian names. This question has been dealt with in previous abstracts, and after much weary discussion is now nearing settlement. Briefly described, it is the method which adopts a uniform value for each letter, and takes as its basis the Indian vowel sounds of a and u as in rural, e in grey, and i and o as in police. Vernacular lists have been prepared of the names of districts, towns, rivers, and places in the various provinces, and carefully translated on this basis into the Roman character. In the case of well-known places which have obtained a popular or historical fixity of spelling, this customary spelling has been retained. For all other names the correct transliteration has been prescribed. In this way lists have been drawn up, approved, and published in the Gazette, for Assam, the North- Western Provinces, Oudh, the Punjab, the Central Provinces, the Berars, Bombay and Sind, Mysore, Coorg, and Bengal. That for Madras has not yet been received, and for Burmah it is not known whether any list will be prepared. Dr. Hunter states that through the agency of the Gazettes, official reports, the new maps, and the greater part of the Indian newspapers, the adoption of the scheme is gradually becoming general. But (he continues) the tangled growth of a century cannot suddenly be transformed into order or cleared away. A whole generation of Anglo-Indians must pass before general uniformity can be looked for, but meanwhile the old standing difficulties in the way of a uniform orthography for the \" Imperial Gazetteer\" have been removed. Part III. of the series of Central Asian Gazetteers issued by the"], [295, "MISCELLANEOUS GEOGRAPHICAL PUBLICATIONS. 51 Quartermaster General's department has been received in this country. It is entitled \" A contribution towardsthe better knowledge of the topography, ethnology, resources, and history of Belochistan,\" compiled by Lieut.-Colonel C. M. MacGregor, Assistant Quarter master General, Calcutta, 1875. It is furnished with some useful tables of routes. Another work on Balochistan has also been published, entitled '\u25a0' The country of Balochistan, its geography, topography, ethnology, and history,\" by A. W. Hughes, F.R.G.S., F.S.S., Bombay Un covenanted Civil Service. Mr. Hughes is the author of the Gazetteer of Sind noticed in the Abstract for 1872-3, p. 67, and he has exhibited in the present work the same research and careful com pilation which he displayed in the former work. The book contains geographical and ethnological sketches of both Persian and Kalati Balochistan, general descriptions of the whole country, and a history thereof from the earliest period down to the year 1876, while in an appendix are furnished a genealogical table of the Khans of Kalat, a vocabulary of the Baloch and Brahuiki dialects, a list of the principal road routes in Persian and Kalati Balochistan, aud a careful index. Mr. Hughes has compiled his work from most trustworthy sources, and its interest and usefulness cannot fail to be appreciated. Bannu is the name of the district on the extreme north-west of our Indian frontier, being bounded on the west by Waziristan, on the north by Kohat, and on the south by the Dera Ismail Khan district. It was originally annexed in 1848 by Lieutenant, after wards Sir Herbert Edwardes, who published a most popular work on it, called \" A year on the Punjab frontier.\" Mr. S. S. Thorburn, the present settlement officer of the district, has had, since 1872, much opportunity of studying the manners and customs of the inhabitants, and he has published his experiences in the shape of an interesting work called \" Bannu or our Afghan frontier \" (Triibner). This work, besides geographical and historical accounts of the district, contains a most useful and lucid section on the land tenures and settlements, while the book concludes with a very full record of the popular stories, ballads, and proverbs of the inhabitants. The recent disastrous cyclone at the mouth of the Megna in the Lower Provinces of Bengal will have lent much interest to Mr. Bcverido-e's \" District of Bakarganj,\" a work which deals exhaus tively with the district referred to from every point of view. It will"], [296, "52 GEOGRAPHICAL DEPARTMENT, INDIA OFFICE. also prove most useful for statistical reference, used in conjunction with the account of Bakarganj published in Vol. V. of Dr. Hunter's \" Statistical Accounts of Bengal\" mentioned above, p. 43. Among miscellaneous geographical reports should be mentioned an interesting account1 by Mr. J. W. Strettell, Deputy Conservator of Forests, of a six months' journey made by him in 1873-4 in Burma proper, under orders from the Government of India, to report on the Ficus elastica there, and the best method of forming plantations thereof in British Burma. Mr. Strettell journeyed to Mandalay, and thence to Bhamo. From Bhamo he made a short excursion eastward to the Kakhyen Hills, and a more extended one northward along the Irrawaddy to Mun-tsoung (lat. 26\u00b0 N.), where the river forks into two large branches, the eastern being the more important. He then returned and struck westward, making a circuit of the En-daw-gyee Lake, and returned to Bhamo in March 1871. Mr. Strettell found the ficus to extend southward as far as 25\u00b0 10', or half a degree further than the limit assigned to its distribution by Mr. Gustav Mann. Eastward of the Irra waddy it would appear from native report to be unknown. Mr. Strettell's work is illustrated by a map containing much new topographical information. X. Geographical Department of the India Office, 1876. The general catalogue of original and other records of the Geo graphical Department of the India Office, comprising manuscript and printed reports, field books, memoirs, maps, and charts of the Indian surveys, has owing to various circumstances been long delayed in publication. The whole of the catalogue, comprising all additions to the collection made up to the end of 1876, is however, now in type, and its publication and issue during the course of the year has been definitely arranged for. The general nature and scope of the catalogue was fully explained in the Abstract for 1872-3, p. 69 ; it only now remains to say that it has been enlarged in its details and brought up to date, and that its value for purposes of statistical reference will be sure to be appreciated. 1 \"The Ficus elastica in Burma proper, or a narrative of my journey in search of it \" By G. W. Strettell. Rangoon, 1876."], [297, "53 NEW MAPS. A new edition of the catalogue of the maps sold by the agents to the India Office has been issued, in which are included all maps pubbshed in India up to the end of 1875. In order to convey prompt intimation of the receipt in England of new maps, arrange ments have been made for the immediate publication and distri bution of slips giving all necessary particulars respecting every map received in each quarterly consignment from India. Among the maps prepared by the department may be mentioned a map of the northern frontier of Khorassan with parts of Irak and Mazanderan, drawn, on the scale of 16 miles to 1 inch, from a manuscript map of Captain the Hon. G. C. Napier. The map is based on St. John's Persia, sheets 2 and 3, and represents a new view of the structure of the Daman-i-kuh or Atak range and the plateau south of it, the former being treated simply as the escarpment of the latter. A good deal of new topographical information was acquired by Captain Napier during his sojourn in the country and embodied in the map, and it may fairly be anticipated, that his subsequent journey to the same region will on his return enable him to place on record a still fuller geographical knowledge of this important frontier province of Persia. The map of the Nandair Circar of the Nizam's dominions was also issued in 1876. This map, which is in 31 sheets, has been prepared uniform with the previous ones of the series, commenced by Mr. John Walker and continued by Mr. Trelawney Saunders. These surveys of the Hyderabad Circars are a part of the General Topographical Surveys of Native States, carried on under the super intendence of the Surveyor General of India. They were com menced in 1818, and continued till 1852, when, in consequence of the mismanagement of the officer in charge, they were suspended. In 1855 the Hyderabad Survey was resumed by Mr. Mulheran, an excellent surveyor, who made good progress, and successfully carried a branch series of triangles from the great arc to Nagpore, during the rising of Tantia Topee. Till 1858 these circars were lithographed under Mr. John Walker, late Geographer to the Secretary of State, and 13 circars in all were completed by him. From 1858 to 1870 there was a period of inaction as regards the reproduction of these maps, but in the latter year the local demands (chiefly from railway engineers) had become so frequent as to cause the Government of India urgently to recommend the con tinuance of the lithography. Since that date Mr. Saunders has"], [298, "st. john's map of Persia. 54 finished the lithography of eight circars (viz., Medduck, Bheer, Beder, Mullangoor, Warungul, Eilgundel, Daroor, and Nandair).. There are still 11 circars, the materials of which cannot be dis covered, and, besides these, six of the assigned districts (East and West Berar), the limits of which do not appear to have been fixed from actual survey. No steps can be taken to reproduce maps of these territories until more satisfactory material is forthcoming. Major St. John's map of Persia 1 was also issued during the year under review. The Abstract of Surveys for 1872-3 described the skeleton on which the details given in the map are fitted, and promised an account of the sources and extent of those details, wrhich are nearly all new to cartography, on completion of the map. Commencing with deter mined frontiers, the coast-line of the Gulf from Al-Basrah to Cape Jashk is taken from the Admiralty chart, corrected for the longitude of Bushire as ascertained by telegraph {vide Abstract for 1871-2). From Jashk to Gwadar the Makran coast was reduced from the manuscript of Captain Stiffe's chart. On the north the coast-line of the Caspian Sea is delineated from the Great Russian chart, the surveys for which were made in 1860-1. The Russo-Persian frontier from Mount Ararat to the Caspian is borrowed from the large scale official map of the Caucasus, and the Baliich and Sistan boundaries from the surveys by Majors St. John and Lovett, when serving on the commissions under Sir F. Goldsmid. These com plete the list of the settled frontier of Persia. Surveyed, but not yet determined by treaty, is the long line of frontier from Mount Ararat to the Persian Gulf. The sheets of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission Map were reduced to the scale of 4 miles to the inch, and photo-zincographed in the Ordnance Survey Office at Southampton ; and from the reduced copy thus obtained, Major St. John borrowed the details for this part of the frontier. The eastern boundary of Persia other than in Baluchistan and Sistan is entirely unexplored, though fairly settled ; the north-eastern frontier exactly the reverse. The details available for the delineation of the vast country included by the above-mentioned boundaries vary in character, *Map of Persia, in 6 sheets. Scale, 16 m. to 1 in. Compiled principally from original authorities, by Major 0. B. St. John, R.E., by order of H.M. Secretary of State for India. (Allen & Co., King & Co., Stanford, and Triibner & Co.)"], [299, "st. john's map of Persia. 55 from careful surveys made by competent topographers to mere routes of travellers who did no more than jot down the names of their halting-places and guess the length of their marches. Nothing, however, has been inserted for which there is not European testimony, and no topographical details given for which there is not valid authority in the shape of maps compiled from original surveys or of tangible verbal description. The routes obtained from natives by Kinneir and others, which form a prominent feature on most published maps of Persia, are omitted, having been found eminently untrustworthy in every case in which they have been tested by subsequent travellers ; and large blanks are thus left where previous maps show considerable detail. Commencing in the north-west corner, the delineation of the province of Adarbaijan is derived from very full though very discordant sources. The large official map of the Caucasus gives in outline an immense amount of information regarding the Persian districts bordering the frontier, besides noting certain points fixed by triangulation. These last have, of course, been accepted, as have been the courses of streams and positions of villages in the immediate vicinity of the frontier fine. But the greater part of the Persian topography on the Caucasus maps appeared on ex amination to be nothing more than a number of routes, probably obtained during the wars of 1827-29, and compiled on a few astronomical data since found to be erroneous. No attempt appears to have been made to fit the old work to the framework subsequently obtained. This was, however, partially done by M. Khanikoff in his map of Adarbaijan, which, considering that he had neither the Turko-Persian frontier survey nor the latest survey of the Araxes at his disposal, is a very creditable perform ance. Major St. John's topography is therefore mainly taken from M. Khanikoff's map, checked carefully throughout by General Monteith's earlier map, Sir Henry Rawlinson's travels, and the two frontier maps as far as they extend. Nearly the whole of Adarbaijan is thus filled in, but the country about Ardabil, the southern part of Lake Urmieh (about the extent of which, in that direction, authorities are at variance), and the country eastwards to Miana require exploration. Gilan and Mazandaran.\u2014 The Talish Mountains, though their o-eneral contours are doubtless correctly shown in General Monteith's map, which has been generally followed, present a field of great"], [300, "56 ST. JOHN'S MAP OF PERSIA. interest both to the topographer, the botanist, and the naturalist. Equally unexplored and equally interesting are the rest of Gilan and whole of Mazandaran, of which nothing but the sea-coast and a few isolated spots can claim to be correctly shown. Lemm (1829) fixed the latitude and longitude of several places between Astarabad and Tehran, and Khanikoff (1858-59), crossing the Alburz Moun tains from Shahrud to the former town, showed that they consist not of one but of three distinct parallel ranges. The new Russian map of Persia, of which more hereafter, gives a large amount of topographical detail, but, for the most part, apparently without authority. Much has therefore been rejected. Major St. John's own exploration on the Alburz near Tehran afford for the first time an accurate delineation of the Shamiran Mountain, the upper part of the Lar River which nearly encircles Mount Damavand and divides it from the water-parting, and of the direct route from Tehran to the Caspian through Anan, which is shifted 30 miles to the west of the position it has hitherto occupied on our maps. Irak. \u2014 Turning next to the great province of Irak, now merely a geographical expression, the topography of the district of Persian Kurdistan is derived from entirely original sources \u2014 in the west from the Turko-Persian frontier survey, in the east from the great Russian map. This was compiled at Tiflis in 1869-71, but its publication has been postponed till the results of the Sistan and Baluchistan Boundary Commissions, then in progress, should be made pubhc. Photographs of the manuscript, lent and copied in England, gave for the first time the detailed topographical result of M. Khanikoff's journeys in Eastern Persia, and the work of the Turko-Persian frontier surveys, which it appears extended over a far greater extent of country than that covered by the official map. The latter takes in the strip of frontier only ; the surveys appear to have comprehended the whole of Khuzist&n, and the roads from Karmanshah to Sihna in Kurdistan ; to Isfahan tlnough Burujird and Khousar ; to Shustar through Khorarnabad - and to Dizful by the Karkhah Valley, as well as the whole western shore of Lake Urmieh. Of these surveys, only that of Khuzistiin and a small portion of the Khorarnabad road seem to have been transcribed by the English members of the mission, and deposited in the Foreign Office Library, where they were made over by Mr. Hertslet, C.B., to Major St. John. For the remainder, the latter has been depen dent on the small scale photographs of the Russian general map,"], [301, "ST. JOHN'S MAP OF PERSIA. 57 which there was much difficulty in deciphering. Nevertheless, they add immensely to our knowledge of the topography of those regions. Other original sources of information in Irak are, \u2014 Major St. John's surveys of the main road from Bushirc to Tehran ; Major Lovett's routes from K6m to Tehran through Saveh and through Varamin ; and the same officer's road survey from Tehran to Mashad. All the rest of Irak is very imperfectly shown. No proper survey of the great Kasvin-Tehran and Tehran-Hamadan roads is believed to exist. Sutherland's map and the manuscript map of the journeys of Sh* John Malcolm's second mission are the main authorities for that part of Irak lying in the quadrangle of which Kasvin, Tehran, Isfahan, and Hamadan are the four corners. Of the second map mentioned, those portions done by Mr. Webb, the surveyor, are good, and, it appears from comparison with later surveys, checked by astronomical observations ; but the rest is very inferior work. This part of Persia is not very interesting, except for the carpet manufactories of Faraan, or Faraghan, an unvisited district, but its exploration would be easy, and fill an unsightly gap in one of the most populous parts of Persia. Ears. \u2014 The general positions of places in this province are shown with approximate accuracy on existing maps, but the physical features are, as a rule, given with a detail which existing data did not altogether warrant, and which are naturally extremely in correct. The main authorities for Western Fars appear to have been Mr. Arrowsmith's maps illustrating General Monteith's paper on the road from Bushire to Shiraz, in the Journal of the Geo graphical Society, and the map of Shiraz and its environs in Baron de Bode's Travels. Both are very faulty. For Western Fars, the foundation of our atlas maps would appear to be D'Anville's map, on which Pottinger's, Ouseley's, Tr6zel's, and one or two other routes have been marked in addition to those above given. In the new map, the country in tbe quadrangle \u2014 Bushire, Kazran, Shiraz, Firazabad \u2014 is from original surveys by Major St. John, who also gives both roads from Shiraz to Isfahan, together with the inter vening country and the main road towards Karman. Major Lovett's survey affords a delineation of the road from Niris to Shiraz, along the south shore of the salt lake of the same name, erroneously called Bakhtagan on older maps, and placed 20 miles too far north. The late Mr. Keith Abbott's carefully recorded"], [302, "st. john's map of persia. 58 observations have also been utilised, but not to the same extent as in the neighbouring district of Karman, and a coast road travelled by Dr. Colville from Bushire to Bandar Abbass has been noted. This is particularly interesting, as showing the outlet of the river system of Fars by the Miin, miscalled on maps the Prestkaf river. For the very scanty details available between the Shiraz-Karman road and the sea, older authorities have been followed. Much remains to be done here ; no route has been recorded from Bandar Abbass to Karman, and none surveyed from Bandar Abbass to Shiraz. The position of the important town of Lar is simply guessed. Khuzistan. \u2014 An almost complete survey of this province, on the scale of one mile to the inch, was unexpectedly found in the library of the Foreign Office. Its plain parts are, perhaps, therefore more accurately shown than any other part of Persia. The moun tains, however, with the neighbouring parts of Isfahan and Fars, comprising the upper basin of the Karun River, are almost a terra incognita. The solitary peak marked Daena on our maps, and supposed by Ritter to be 11,000 feet in altitude, is shown by Major St. John to be a ridge extending 30 miles, in a N.W. to S.E. direction, and covered with eternal snow. It can, therefore, be hardly less than 17,000 feet in altitude, and may be more. Under any circumstances, it is probably tbe most important mountain range in Persia as far as dimensions go. Yazd and Karman.\u2014 The astronomical observations recorded by M. Lenz when serving on Khanikoff's staff \u2014 though internal evidence and comparison with the work of other observers has shown they are not implicitly to be relied on \u2014 have served, after due correction, as a foundation for topographical details, collected by the late Quartermaster-Sergeant Bower, R.E., when travelling from Isfahan through Yazd to Karman with Sir Frederick Gold smid. Major St. John's survey from Bampur in Baluchistan through Bam to Karman and onwards to Shiraz ; Major Lovett's sketch of the country from Karman to Bam by Khabbis ; the same officer's route across the desert from Bam to Sistan with Sir F. Gold smid ; Mr. Keith Abbott's observations on the road from Sirjan to Bam by a circuitous road to the south, and by the eastern road from Karman to Yazd ; and routes by Majors Murdoch and Euan Smith from Bam to Bandar Abbass, are shown for the first time on this map. The route of Dupre and Trezel between the Shiraz -Isfahan"], [303, "st. john's map of persia. 59 road and Yazd, has not, it is believed, been before noticed by geographers. The great range of mountains stretching from near K6m to Baluchistan, though indicated by Khanikoff, and one of the most remarkable features of the geography of Persia, is now given its true proportions. Altogether there is, perhaps, as much novelty in this as in any other portion of the map, except the next. Baluchistan. \u2014 With the exception of the coast-line and Grant's route (1809) through Geh, everything is new in this part of the map, being entirely founded on the surveys of Majors St. John and Lovett in 1871-72. Comparing it with existing maps, it will be seen that the dimensions of this part of Baluchistan are much restricted towards the north, where the direction of the axes of the mountain ranges, as in Karman, is shown to be N.E. and S.W., instead of being parallel to the coast-line. The great desert south of the Halmand and all the northern hills are shown to be drained in the direction of Sistan, instead of into the Arabian Sea. Many erroneous names have been expunged, and a large amount of topo graphical detail given. Much, however, remains to be done. The district of Bashakird, which properly forms part of Karman, not Baluchistan, is quite unknown, as are the Irafshan and Sarhad districts, whilst no details exist regarding the country about Geh. It may be remarked, though the subject forms no part of Persian cartography, that a zone of unexplored country, nearly two degrees of longitude in breadth, intervenes between the frontier districts and the mapped parts of Kalat-i- Baluchistan. Khurasan. \u2014 The scanty map published with M. Khanikoff's Travels throws a flood of light on part of the geography of this the largest and perhaps the most interesting province of Persia, of which cartographers were not slow to take advantage. His routes will, however, be found given for the first time in detail on this map, owing to the kindness of M. Khanikoff in lending photographs of the manuscript. Partly covering the same ground, and elsewhere intersecting M. Khanikoff's routes in various points, are the surveys of Major Lovett when serving on Sir F. Goldsmid's Sistan Boundary Commission. That officer's map of Sistan, in particular, supersedes Connolly's imperfect sketch. Other work, original as far as a complete map is concerned, is a transcript of the Russian surveys north of the Atrak, showing the true direction and extent of the Kopet and Kuren chains, and of Baker's and Gill's work further east in 1873, including the hitherto unvisited Darah Gaz and E"], [304, "60 AFGHANISTAN GEOGRAPHY. Kalat-i-Nadiri, the most useful contribution made to the geography of Persia by private travellers since Fraser's journey over part of the same ground in 1829. Neither that traveller's route, nor that of Burnes from Kabushan to Astrabad, has been since followed, and remain unaltered on the map. Owing to the political interest which must attach for some years to come to the north-east frontier of Persia, regular additions to our knowledge of Northern and Eastern Khorasan may be confidently expected. Further south, all routes across the great salt desert have been carefully revised. One valuable addition is a direct route from Shahrud to Yazd, by which it appears that the level of the lowest part of the desert must nearly reach that of the sea, and that the extent of the actual saline tract has been much exaggerated. Further details on this point will be found in Major St. John's general sketch of the physical geography of Persia forming part of the two volumes on \" Eastern Persia \" recently published. A new map of Afghanistan is in course of preparation for the India Office, at the hands of Major C. W. Wilson, R.E., late director of the Topographical Depot of the War Office. The map is to be compiled from all available materials, for which due search has been made in the Political, Survey, and Quartermaster General's Departments in India. It is in 20 sheets, and com prises a large extent of country from Mashhad on the west to Multan on the east, and from the province of Hissar in the north to Karachi in the south. In connexion with the preparation of this new map of Afghanistan it may be mentioned that Major H. Raverty, late of Bombay, has undertaken, at the request of the Secretary of State for India, the translation of a considerable mass of geographical information in the Persian and Pushto languages, collected by him for his forth coming history of the Afghan nation. This information consists of a variety of detailed routes through the north-west and other parts of Afghanistan, as well as detailed accounts of the districts and territories of Kabul, Peshawar, Bajawr, Kashkar, Afghanistan and the Derah-jat. Amongst other documents there is an account, written by an eye-witness who accompanied the force, of the expedition of Prince Dara Shukoh, son of the Emperor Shah-i- Jahan, against Kandahar. He led a great army, with a numerous train of artillery, from the Punjab thither, without touching either the Bolan or Khyber routes, which many believe to be the only"], [305, "AFGHANISTAN GEOGRAPHY. 61 practicable routes between Afghanistan and India. Other papers which will be included in Major Raverty's translation, are the history written by Akhund Darwezah, the Tajik, who is the saint of the Afghans, and whose work is rich in geographical details respecting the tracts between the Indus and Jalalabad on the Kabul river and further north, and the travels of Mirza Rajab' Ali into the Kohistan of Kabul, his account of Khuwarazm (Khiva), and routes to the north, north-east, and north-west of Kabul. Major Raverty's translation of these important documents is anticipated to occupy about a year in preparation, and when com pleted will be deposited for utilization and record in the Geographical Department of the India Office. During the year under review, an important varied selection of Indian maps, plans, charts, and manuscript memoirs was exhibited in the Geographical Section of the Loan Exhibition of Scientific Instruments at South Kensington. It included some tracings of the old Dutch charts of the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, Rennell's map and atlas of India, a collection of Dahymple's charts, and various general and provincial maps issued during the last half -century, and arranged in order of the date of production.
