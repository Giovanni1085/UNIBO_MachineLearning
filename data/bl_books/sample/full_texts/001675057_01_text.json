To affifl: this effect, it has alio been thought better to make ufe of Names different from thofe of the late King of France, his Queen, Daughter, and Siller. The Perfonages of the King and his Family, in this Piece, have indeed a reference to the late King of France and his Family: but, in point of Charac ter, they are not offered as exact reprefentations. All the other Characters of the Drama are intirely fictitious : taken from the general fpirit of the times, and not from Individuals. The Author willies to add, that this Piece was (in a great nieafure) written fo long ago as laft May ; and before he had any intimation of another Tragedy relating to the fame af fairs.
