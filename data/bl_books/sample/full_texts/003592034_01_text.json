The plan of this work is nearly the same as that of the Student's Manual of Ancient LTistory, which has been sanctioned by public approbation. It is a compilation, which can have few claims to novelty; but it is hoped that most students will be gratified, with the attention paid to such events as mark the progress of civilization, for they form the chain by which the histories of the several nations of Europe are linked together. It has been the constant aim of the Author to impress upon his readers that the Providence of God may be traced with as much distinctness in the moral government of the universe, as in the physical world; we cannot comprehend all the mysteries of the Almighty's wondrous plan, because \" the end is not yet ;\" but we see enough to convince us that there is evident and great design in the order of the events which constitute general history. In the narrative of our own times, the Writer has sedu lously avoided party views of important questions, and has confined himself to a plain statement of facts, without any colouring borrowed from opinions. Colonization is too important a branch of Modern History to be omitted, and, at the risk of being charged with some thing like repetition, the Author has thought it right to give a summary of the history of the principal Colonies which have been founded in India and America. a 2"], [10, "PREFACE.

CHAPTER I. CONSEQUENCES OF THE FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. Section I. \u2014 The Gothic Kingdom of Italy. There is no period in the annals of the human race which presents to the historical student a greater scene of confusion than the century succeeding the overthrow of the Western Empire. The different hordes of barbarians, following no definite plan, esta blished separate monarchies in the dismembered provinces, engaged in sanguinary- wars that had no object but plunder, and were too ignorant to form anything like a political system. There is consequently a want of unity in the narrative of a time when nations ceased to have fixed relations towards each other, and history must appear desultory and digressive until some one state, rising into command, assumes such importance, that the fate of all the rest may be connected with its destinies. It is necessary, before entering on the various incidents of this cala mitous time, to take a geographical survey of the places occupied by the principal nations who succeeded the Romans in the sovereignty of Europe. The Visigoths, after their establishment in Spain, began gradually to adopt the refinement of their new subjects ; that peninsula had advanced rapidly in civilization under the Roman dominion, and had escaped from much of the corruption which had degraded Italy; the conquerors, more advanced than any of the other barbarians, soon learned to appreciate the advan tages of social order, and began to cultivate the higher arts of life. In Pannonia, the Ostrogoths derived great improvement ii"], [16, "2 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. from their vicinity to Italy on the one side, and the court of Constantinople on the other; they were thus gradually trained to civilization, and their early adoption of Christianity secured them the benefits of literature, which was sedulously cultivated by the clergy. Tribes of a very different character pressed into the empire from the German forests,\u2014 the Burgundians, the Lombards, and the Franks, of whom the last were long distinguished for their hostility to all refinements, and their exclusive attention to the military virtues. Still more barbarous were the Saxons and Ano-les ; they were not only strangers to the civilization and religion of the empire, but were kept in their rude state by the practice of piracy, for which flieir maritime situation afforded them great facilities ; their government, divided among several petty chiefs, was favourable to personal independence, and furnished a striking contrast to the absolute despotism that had been established in the Roman empire. All the Germanic tribes were remarkable for the respect which they showed to the delicacy of the female character ; they neither treated their women like slaves, as most other barbarians have done, nor did they degrade them into mere objects of sensual gratification, like the Romans and Byzantines. The German woman was the companion and counsellor of her husband; she shared his labours as an equal, not as a servant. It was from the sanctity of the domestic circle among the northern nations that races of conquerors derived the firmness and courage that ensured them victory. The north-eastern part of Europe was occupied by Sclavonic tribes, differing from the Germans in language, manners, and tactics; like the Tartars of more modern times, they placed their chief reliance on their cavalry; and they were more opposed to civilization than any of the Germanic nations. After the fall of the Western Empire, the court of Constan tinople sunk into obscurity, from which it did not emerge for half a century, when its supremacy was restored during the memorable reign of Justinian. The Isaurian Zeno, raised to the purple by his marriage with the Princess Ariadne, was forced to fly into the mountains by a fierce revolt which his"], [17, "3 THE GOTHIC KINGDOM OF ITALY. mother-in-law Verina had instigated. He was restored to the throne chiefly by the aid of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who had been carefully educated as a hostage at the court of Constantinople. The turbulence of the Goths, and the faith lessness of the Byzantines, soon destroyed the amity of the two sovereigns; a desultory, but sanguinary warfare harassed the Eastern Empire, until Zeno purchased peace by ceding to Theodoric his right over Italy, or rather stimulated the Goth to undertake the conquest of that peninsula. The march of Theodoric was the emigration of an entire people ; the Goths were accompanied by their wives, their children, and their aged parents, a vast m ultitude of wagons conveyed their most pre cious effects, and their store of provisions for a toilsome march undertaken in the depth of winter. Odoaeer boldly prepared to meet this formidable invasion ; he took post on the river Sontius (Isonzo) with a powerful host; but he was unable to resist the daring energy of the Goths, and his defeat gave Theodoric possession of the Venetian province as far as the walls of Verona (a.d. 489). Italy, however, was not won without further struggles; Ravenna alone sustained a siege of more than three years ; but at length Odoaeer capitulated (a. d. 493), and was soon after assassinated at a solemn banquet by his rival. Theodoric secured his conquest by distributing one-third of the lands of Italy to his soldiers. This partition was effected with very little violence to the ancient possessors ; the Goths were instructed to spare the p eople, to reverence the laws, and to lay aside their barbarous customs of judicial combats and private revenge. The Gothic sovereignty was soon extended from Sicily to the Danube, and from Sirmium (Sirmich) to the Atlantic Ocean ; thus including the faire st portion of the \"West ern Empire. The monarch of this new kingdom showed great wisdom and moderation in his civil government, but unfortu nately his attachment to the Arian heresy led him to persecute the Catholics ; it must however be confessed that their bigoted turbulence afforded too often a reasonable excuse for his severity. The legal murder of the philosopher Boethius and the venerable Symmachus were crimes which admit of no palliation; they B2"], [18, "4 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. hastened Theodoric's death, for remorse brought him to the grave in the thirty-third year of his reign (a. d. 526). Section II. \u2014 The Reign of Justinian. A Dacian peasant, named Justin, who had travelled on foot to Constantinople in the reign of the Emperor Leo, enlisted in the imperial guards, and, during the succeeding reigns, so distin- guished himself by his strength and valour, that he was gra- dually raised to the command of the household troops. On the death of the Emperor Anastasius, the eunuch Amantius, anxious to secure the throne for one of his creatures, entrusted Justin with a large sum of money to bribe the guards ; but he used it to purchase votes for himself, and was thus elevated to the empire (a. d. 518). Totally ignorant himself, Justin was not insensible of the value of education ; he made his nephew Jus- tinian his associate in the empire ; and as this prince had been instructed in all the learning of the times, he soon obtained the whole power of the state. After the death of Justin (a. d. 527), Justinian ruled alone ; but his first exercise of authority fixed a lasting stigma on his reign. He chose for his empress, Theodora, a woman of mean birth and infamous character, whose vices had disgusted even a capital so licentious as Constantinople. Among the most singular and disgraceful follies of the Eastern Empire, was the factions of the circus, which arose from the colours worn by the charioteers who competed for the prize of swiftness. Green and blue were the most remarkable for their inveterate hostility, though white and red were the most ancient ; all, however, soon acquired a legal existence, and the Byzantines willingly hazarded life and fortune to support their favourite colour. Justinian was a partisan of the blues ; his favour towards them provoked the hostility of the opposite faction, and led to a sedition which almost laid Constantinople in ashes. The disturbances first burst forth in the circus ; Jus tinian ordered the rioters to be secured ; both factions immedi ately turned against the monarch, the soldiers were called out,"], [19, "REIGN OF JUSTINIAN. 5 but they were unable to contend against the citizens in the narrow streets. Assailed from the tops of the houses, the bar barian mercenaries flung firebrands in revenge, and thus kindled a dreadful conflagration, which destroyed a vast number of public and private edifices. After the city had been for several days in the hands of the rioters, Justinian contrived to revive the ancient animosity between the greens and blues ; the -latter faction declared for the emperor, a strong body of veterans marched to the Hippodrome, and tranquillity was restored by the slaughter of thirty thousand of the insurgents. While the internal state of the empire was thus disturbed by faction, a costly and unprofitable war was waged against the Persians, until the emperor purchased a disgraceful and precarious truce, which both he and his rival chose to designate as an endless peace. The usurpation of the throne of the Vandals in Africa by Gelimer, who owed his success chiefly to th\" support of the Arian clergy, enabled Justinian to undertake a war, in which he appeared both the generous friend of an allied sovereign and the protector of the Catholic faith. Belisarius, the best general of his age, was appointed to the command of the imperial forces, and a large fleet was assembled for the transport of the army in the harbour of Constantinople (a. d. 533). After it had been blessed by the patriarch it set sail ; and, after a prosperous voyage, Belisarius effected a landing on the coast of Africa without opposition. He advanced towards Carthage, defeating the Vandals on his march, and became master of the city with little opposition. Gelimer made one effort more to save his kingdom ; it was unsuccessful, his army was irretrievably ruined, and he was closely besieged in the castle where he sought refuge. The unfortunate king, after having borne the most dreadful extremities of famine, was forced to surrender uncon ditionally; he was carried captive to Constantinople, where he was led in the triumphal procession that honoured the return of Belisarius. The dethroned monarch showed no sorrow for his fall, but consoled himself by Solomon's reflection on the insta bility of human greatness, frequently repeating, \" Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, all is vanity.\""], [20, "6 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. The murder of Amalasontha, queen of the Goths, by her ungrateful husband Theodatus, afforded Belisarius a pretext for attacking the kingdom of Italy. He sailed from Constantinople to Sicily, and easily conquered that important island (a. d. 535). Theodatus, in great terror, hasted to avert danger, by declaring himself the vassal of Justinian ; but hearing in the mean time that two Byzantine generals had been defeated in Dalmatia by the Gothic troops, he passed suddenly from extreme despair to the height of presumption, and withdrew his allegiance. Beli sarius soon appeared to chastise his perfidy; he transported his army across the Sicilian strait, and effected a landing at Rhe gium (Reggio). The greater part of southern Italy, including the important city of Naples, was speedily subdued by the imperial forces; while Theodatus, secure within the walls of Rome, made no effort to protect his subjects. At length the Goths, disgusted by the weakness and incapacity of their sove reign, removed him from the throne, and chose the valiant Vitiges for their king. But Vitiges was forced to commence his reign by abandoning Rome, of which Belisarius took pos session without encountering any opposition (a. d. 537). During the ensuing winter, the Goths assembled from every quarter to save, if possible, their kingdom in Italy; a powerful army, animated by dauntless spirit, was soon collected, and Vitiges led his followers to the sieoe of Rome. Belisarius con- es o centrated his forces in the Eternal City, which was defended with equal skill and bravery; but famine soon appeared within the walls, and the citizens became anxious for a capitulation. A conspiracy was formed under the sanction of the pope, Syl verius, for betraying the city to the Goths ; but it was discovered by an intercepted letter. Belisarius sent Sylverius into banish ment, and ordered the bishops to elect a new pontiff; but the general's wife, the infamous Antonina, sold the Holy See to Vigilius for a bribe of two hundred pounds weight of gold. Reinforcements soon after arrived from the east, and the Goths were forced to raise the siege of Rome, having lost one-third of their number before its walls. Belisarius pursued the retreating enemy to the marshes of Ravenna, and would probably have captured that city, but for the jealousy of the eunuch Narses"], [21, "7 REIGN OF JUSTINIAN. whom Justinian had entrusted with the independent command of a large division of the Byzantine army. Though the diffe rences between the two leaders were finally adjusted, the Goths had taken advantage of the interval to collect new strength ; and ten thousand Burgundians, sent to invade Italy by the command of Theodobert, king of the Franks, had stormed and plundered Milan. Soon after, Theodobert passed the Alps in person at the head of one hundred thousand men. The Franks stormed Genoa, and devastated Liguria; but their excesses brought pestilence into their camp, they perished by thousands, and Theodobert was induced, by his increasing distresses, to enter into terms of accommodation with the emperor. Delivered from this pressing danger, Belisarius laid siege to Ravenna, which was forced to capitulate (a.d. 539); and thus the Gothic kingdom of Italy was destroyed. Belisarius returned to Constantinople in triumph, leading with him the captive Vitiges; he was sent to conduct the Persian war, but was soon recalled and disgraced by the un grateful Justinian. While the conquests of Belisarius were restoring the western provinces to the empire, barbarous hordes ravaged, almost with impunity, the north-eastern frontiers. Unable or unwilling to meet the Gepid\u00e6 in the field, Justinian entered into alliance with the Lombards, who had just thrown off the yoke of the Heruli, and gave them settlements in Pan nonia. A war of forty years' duration, between the Lombards and Gepid\u00e6, protected the empire from the invasions of both hordes ; but it was still exposed to the incursions of the Scla vonians and Bulgarians, who annually purchased a passage through the territories of the Gepid\u00e6, and extended their inroads even into southern Greece. Commotions in the remote east brought Europeans, about this time, acquainted with new and more formidable races of barbarians, the Avars and the Turks, whose importance may justify a short digression on their origin. The Avars, from an unknown age, possessed the mountains and deserts that border on the lake Baikal in north-eastern Asia. Thence they advanced southwards under a monarch named Tuliin, and extended their empire to the eastern sea, which separates Corea from Japan. The conqueror took the title of"], [22, "8 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. Khakan or Chagan, a name still used on the coins of the Turkish sultan. But the prosperity of the Avars was not of long duration; they were assailed by rival tribes from the north, and at the same time harassed by civil wars ; while thus dis tressed, they were attacked by a new horde, called Thiii khiii by Chinese writers, but known to Europeans as the Turks. The Avars were overthrown by these new competitors for empire, and their power totally destroyed ; but their name was taken by a new nation, the Ogors or Varchonites, who, after being defeated by the Turks, migrated towards Europe by the route of the Volga. They chose the false designation, because the name of the Avars was still formidable, and they preserved it on account of the terror which they saw it produced. The Turks first appear in history as the slaves of the original Avars ; they inhabited the great Altaian mountains, and were eng-ag-ed in working; the mines and attending- the forg-es of those rich mineral districts. Their skill in fabricating armour and weapons was very great, and they prided themselves upon the excellence of their manufactures so much, that, when they became lords of eastern Asia, their Khakans annually forged a piece of iron in the presence of the heads of the nation. Under the guidance of Tlui-men, they asserted their independence, and made slaves of their former masters. So rapid was their pro gress, that, during the reigns of Tlui-men and his successor Dizabul, their empire extended from the Volga to the Sea of Japan. They were thus brought to the frontiers of the Byzan tine and Persian dominions, and engaged in commercial relations with both, by their occupation of the countries through which the silk-trade was carried. The great rival of Justinian was Chosroes or Nushirvan, the most celebrated Persian monarch of the Sassanid dynasty; in the early part of his reign he won the affection of his subjects, by extirpating the pernicious system of policy and religion which his predecessor Kobad, seduced by an impostor named Mazdak, had patronized. His next care was to give confidence to the labouring classes by judicious laws for securing the rights of industry, and by a sedulous attention to the administration of justice. Having thus secured the tranquillity and prosperity"], [23, "9 REIGN OF JUSTINIAN. of Persia, he directed his attention to the favourite project of the Sassanides, the re-establishment of the empire of Cyrus, and perceiving that the forces of Justinian were engaged in the west, invaded Syria, at the head of a powerful army (a.d. 540). His victorious career was checked for a brief space by Belisarius, but after the recall and disgrace of that g-eneral, he urered forward his conquests with alarming rapidity. Justinian, in his distress, repented of his ingratitude ; Belisarius was restored to command, and, by his judicious exertions, Nushirvan was forced to return across the Euphrates, loaded, however, with the spoils of western Asia. His next enterprize was the conquest of the Caucasian districts, inhabited by the Lazi, the Colchians, and other semi-barbarous tribes, which the Byzantines struggled to prevent, and this led to the tedious Lazic war, in which the strength of both empires was uselessly wasted. In consequence of the Persian war, Justinian entered into a treaty with the Abyssinians, whose monarch had subdued the greater part of Arabia, in the expectation of opening, by his means, a naval communication with China and India ; but the design was frustrated by the reluctance of the Ethiopian monarch to engage in a doubtful contest with the power of Persia. The provinces of Africa and Italy, acquired by the valour of Belisarius, were nearly lost by the incapacity and tyranny of his successors. Their weakness provoked the Moors to take arms ; and, though these barbarians were finally reduced, the African province was changed from a fertile and populous country into a savage and silent desert. Still more dangerous was the revolt of the Goths under the gallant Totila (a. d. 541), who in a very brief space recovered the greater part of Italy. Finding his generals successively defeated, Justinian sent Belisarius to the theatre of his former glory; but he neglected to supply the hero with sufficient forces, and Rome was captured by Totila, almost in sight of the imperial army. The city was recovered soon after, and the old general gained some advantages over Totila ; but finding himself unsupported, he solicited permission to return, and departed from Italy disgraced, not so much by his failure, as by the plunder he had permitted Antonina to extort from those he was sent to defend (a. d. 548). Totila,"], [24, "10 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. after the departure of Belisarius, again made himself master of Rome, but the maritime cities of Italy resisted his assaults, and supported the imperial interests until the eunuch Narses was sent into the peninsula (a. d. 552). Justinian granted to this favourite what he had denied to Belisarius, a competent supply of the munitions of war ; allies were entreated to send contin gents, and mercenaries were hired from the princi pal barbarous tribes. Thus supplied, the eunuch eagerly sought to bring the Goths to an engagement ; Totila showed equal ardour for the combat, and the hostile forces soon met in the vicinity of Rome. In the very commencement of the battle the Gothic cavalry, hurried forward by their impetuosity, advanced so far beyond their infantry, that they were surrounded and cut to pieces before they could receive assistance. Totila, hasting with a chosen troop to remedy the disorder, was struck to the earth mortally wounded, and his followers instantly fled in confusion. Rome opened its gates to the conquerors ; but the imperial forces, especially the barbarian mercenaries, treated the city more cruelly than the Gothic conquerors had done. The bravest of the Goths retired, after their defeat, beyond the Po, and chose Teias for their king. War was of course renewed ; but in a fierce battle, which lasted two entire days, Teias was slain, and the power of the Ostrogoths irretrievably ruined. Narses had scarcely time to recover from the fatigues of this campaign, when he was summoned to repel an invasion of the Franks and Allemans ; he routed them with great slaughter ; and then returning to Rome, gratified its citizens by the semblance of a triumph. Italy was thus reduced to a Byzantine province, governed by the exarchs of Ravenna; and Narses himself, the first and most powerful of the exarchs, governed the whole peninsula for fifteen years. In the mean time Belisarius had been summoned to defend the empire from the dangers with which it was menaced, by an invasion of the Bulgarians. He gained a decisive victory over the barbarians, but was prevented from improving his advautao-es by the intrigues of the courtiers. The Bulgarians were induced to return beyond the Danube, by the payment of a large ransom for their captives ; and Justinian claimed the gratitude of his"], [25, "REIGN OF JUSTINIAN. 11 subjects for accelerating their departure by the threat of placinc armed vessels in the Danube. This was the last campaio-n of Belisarius ; he was soon after disgraced and imprisoned, under a false charge of treason : his innocence was subsequently proved, and his freedom restored, but grief and resentment hurried him to the grave ; and his treasures were seized by the rapacious emperor. Eight months afterwards Justinian sunk into the tomb, scarcely regretted by his subjects. He was a pious and diligent sovereign, but he wanted energy to contend against the vices of his court and the age. His talents as a legislator and statesman were great ; had he acted on his own principles, he would have surpassed Augustus, but he yielded his power to the infamous Theodora, and to unworthy ministers who abused his confidence, and oppressed the empire. Section III. \u2014 The Establishment of the Civil Laic. Eably in his reign Justinian directed his attention to the state of the law in his empire, and formed the useful project of digest ing into a uniform code the vast mass of laws, rules, and judicial maxims, which the various interests of the Romans and Byzan tines, their progress in civilization, and the inconstancy of their rulers, had produced, during the course of thirteen hundred years. He saw that the multitude of ordinances occasioned confusion and disorder, and that the heap of inconsistent decisions and regulations, formed a labyrinth in which justice went astray, and iniquity found avenues for escape. The execution of this great plan was not worthy of the design. At the head of the commission appointed to prepare the code, was Tribonian, a lawyer of great eminence, but unfortunately an interested flatterer and corrupt judge ; accustomed to sell justice, he altered, perverted, or suppressed many excellent laws. He frequently persuaded the emperor to destroy, by supplementary edicts, called Novels, the principles of right which had been previously established in the Code and the Digest. Justinian commenced with the Code. In an edict, dated the"], [26, "FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. 12 3d of February, a. d. 528, addressed to the senate of Constan tinople, he declared his resolution of collecting into a single volume, not merely the laws in the three previous codes of Gregory, Hermogenianus, and Theodosius, but also the laws thathad been published by imperial authority since the forma tion of the Theodosian code. A commission of ten eminent lawyers, with Tribonian at its head, was charged with the execution of this task. They were permitted to suppress repetitions, to remove contradictory or obsolete laws, to add what was necessary for exactness or explanation, and to unite, under one head, what was spread over a great variety of laws. The work went on so rapidly, that in little more than a year the new code, containing, in twelve books, all the imperial laws from the accession of the emperor Adrian, was ready to appear. Justinian affixed the imperial seal to the new constitution (a. d. 529), and transmitted it, with a suitable edict, to Mennas, the pr\u00e6torian pr\u00e6fect. In this edict he congratulates himself and the empire on having found commissioners possessing so much zeal, knowledge, and probity ; he gives the collection the force of law, ordaining that the new code alone should be cited in courts of justice; and he commands the pr\u00e6fect to have this made known through the empire. A more extensive and difficult work remained, to collect the scattered monuments of ancient jurisprudence. Justinian con fided this task also to Tribonian, and gave him the power of nominating his fellow commissioners. Tribonian chose one of the magistrates who had already aided in the formation of the Code, four professors of jurisprudence, and eleven advocates of high legal reputation. These seventeen commissioners were instructed to search out, collect, and put in order, all that was really useful in the books of the jurisconsults who had been authorized to make or interpret laws by preceding sovereigns ; they were permitted, as in the case of the Code, to change, add, or retrench, and to fix doubtful cases by precise definitions. The emperor recommended them, in settling any point, to regard neither the number nor the reputation of the jurisconsults who had given opinions on the subject, but to be guided solely by reason and equity. Their collection was to be arranged in fifty"], [27, "13 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CIVIL LAW. books, having all the matter arranged under their respective titles, and was to be named the Digest, on account of its orderly classification, or the Pandects, because it was to contain all the ancient jurisprudence*. But the commissioners seem to have executed their task with more zeal and speed than exactness. The emperor himself did not expect that the work could be completed in less than ten years. It was necessary to examine carefully more than two thousand volumes, to discuss, compare, and reduce into order, an innumerable number of decisions ; to reform some of them, to reverse others, and to classify the whole. But Tribonian, who knew that in enterprises which engage the vanity of princes, the delay between the design and execution is borne with great impatience, hurried on the work so rapidly, that it was completed in three years. On the 16th of December, 533, Justinian invested this collection with the authority of law, by a constitution of state, addressed to the senate of Constantinople, and all his subjects throughout the empire. In this edict he states, that the enormous chaos of ancient decisions have been reduced to a twentieth part, without the omission of anything essential, so that the order and brevity of this body of jurisprudence, and the facility with which it could be learned, took away every excuse from negligence or ignorance. He declares, that though some errors may have crept into a work of such vast magnitude, their number is very limited ; and he asserts, rather too hastily, that it contains none of those inconsistent decisions which lawyers call antinomies t. Should any point be found deficient or obscure, he wills that recourse should be had to the imperial authority, which alone has the power to supply or interpret the laws. To prevent the recurrence of the ancient confusion, by a diversity of sentiments, he forbids all commentary, permitting only the translation of the laws into Greek, with the addition of titles and paratitles \u2014 that is to say, summaries of their contents. He forbids the use * From Trav, all, and &6)(es9at., to contain. The fifty books of the Pandects are divided into four hundred and twenty-three titles, which contain nine thousand one hundred and twenty-three laws, each marked with the name of its author. \u2022f From ami, contrary to, and vojxos, law."], [28, "14 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. of abbreviations in transcribing them, declaring that the copy in which a contraction was found should be held of no authority, and that the transcriber should be punished for forgery. All other laws are declared to be abrogated, and are even forbidden to be cited in the tribunals ; and the judges are ordered to con form in all things to the Digest from the day of the date of the edict. The emperor enjoins the three pr\u00e6torian pr\u00e6fects to publish the Digest in their several governments, and concludes by stating that he was anxious to have this meritorious revolu tion effected during his third consulate, in order that a year, which heaven had blessed by a peace with Persia, and the conquest of Africa, should witness the completion of this great edifice of the laws, as a holy and august temple, in which justice should pronounce her oracles. Whilst the commissioners laboured at the Digest, the emperor charged Tribonian, and two eminent professors, to prepare an elementary work on jurisprudence, in four books, as an intro duction to the study of law. This portion of Justinian's legislation is far the most valuable part ; it was finished and published a little before the Digest, and was named the Institutes. The whole system of ancient jurisprudence was thus simpli fied, reduced to its essentials, and arranged in the Institutes, the Pandects, and the Code. But, after their publication, Justinian published more than two hundred supplementary edicts ; and when the great collections began to be used in the courts, several errors and imperfections were discovered, as might reasonably be expected in a work of such magnitude, executed with such unnecessary speed. A new commission was appointed to revise the Code ; the result of its labours was a second edition, which received the imperial sanction, November 16th, 534, by an edict abrogating the former imperfect Code. The emperor reserved to himself, in express terms, the rio-ht of adding, at a subsequent time, but separately, such constitu tions as he should judge necessary. These were called Novels \u25a0 they limit, extend, and in some instances repeal the Code ; and it is this inconsistency that has led to the suspicion of Tribonian and the prince having occasionally been guided by interest and"], [29, "15 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CIVIL LAW. favour, rather than by reason and equity. These Novels are one hundred and sixty-eight in number, but only ninety-eight have the force of law, having been collected into a volume in the last year of Justinian's reign. This code was supplanted in the east by the Basilica or Greek constitutions of later emperors. In the west, Illyria was the only province by which it was received, until the overthrow of the Gothic monarchy afforded an opportunit y for its introduc tion into Italy. The code was, however, superseded by the laws of the Lombards, when their hordes became masters of Ravenna. After Charlemagne had overthrown the Lombard monarchy, he searched Italy in vain for a copy of Justinian's legislation ; it remained concealed until the twelfth century, when a copy of the Digest was found on the capture of Amalfi by the troops of the emperor Lothaire II., and presented by him to the citizens of Pisa, who had aided the- imperialists in this expedition. At a later period, a copy of the Code was dis covered at Ravenna, and a collection was made of the Novels which were dispersed throughout Italy. Such were the origin and revolutions of this celebrated body of legislation, the source of the civil law throughout Europe, and the great guide to the most civilized nations in supplying the defects of their several legal systems. Section IV. \u2014 History of the Silk-Trade. Introduction of the Silk- Worm into Europe. Silk was known as an article of commerce, and extensively used in the western world, long before the insect that produces this precious substance, and whose nature was unknown, was brought for the first time to Constantinople. No one before the age of Justinian had even contemplated such an enterprise. It was only by long and painful journeys through the dangerous and difficult wilds of central Asia, that a merchandize could be procured, which the progress of wealth and luxury rendered almost indispensable to the civilized nations of Europe, Asia, and Africa, that surrounded the Mediterranean. The Assyrians"], [30, "16 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. and Medcs, in the early ages, had long a monopoly of this commerce ; and hence we find that garments of wrought silk are usually called Median robes by the ancient writers. In this traffic they were succeeded by the Persians, who attached great importance to the trade, and neglected nothing that could keep it exclusively in their hands. From them the Greek and Syrian merchants of Asia purchased the silk which they trans ported into the western countries. Passing through such a number of hands, it was of course scarce and dear. During Justinian's reign, the Byzantines, or, as they still called them selves, the Romans, were eager to free themselves from their dependence on the Persians for the supply of this article. They tried to lower the price by purchasing from other Asiatic nations, and by making exertions to open a direct communica tion with the country in which the silk is produced. Their ignorance of geography was a great impediment to their success; they had very vague notions respecting the position of the regions where this desirable commodity was procured. They contented themselves with loosely describing it as part of India, or some very remote country in eastern Asia. A few modern writers have been misled by the inaccuracy of the Byzantine historians into the belief that the country which supplied the ancient world with silk was the Punjab, and the districts of northern India adjacent to Persia, regions where silk has never yet been produced in sufficient abundance to form an article of commerce. On the contrary, the circumstances related respecting Serica, the silk-growing country, are mani festly applicable to no place but China, where silk is still produced more plentifully than in any other part of the world. Indeed the very name Seres appears to have been derived from this commodity; for Se, or, as it is pronounced in the provincial dialects, Ser, is the Chines.\" name for the silk-worm. We also find the Sin\u00e6 identified with the Seres by the ancient geographers, and we know that Sin, or Chin, has been always the name given to China by the nations of western Asia. In the preced ing volume mention has been made of the embassy sent from the Romans to the Chinese, in the age of the Antonines ; and it is only necessary to add, in proof of the commercial relations"], [31, "HISTORY OF THE SILK-TRADE. 17 between this ancient empire and the western world, that a tolerably accurate account of the revolutions in the Persian and Parthian kingdoms may be found in Chinese histories *. The silk was exported from China in packages, which cara vans of merchants brought across the extreme breadth of Asia, in a journey of two hundred and forty-three days, to the sea coast of Syria. The Persians who supplied the Romans, usually made their purchases from the Sogdians, on the banks of the Oxus, and their traffic was liable to be interrupted by the White Huns and the Turks, who successively conquered that industrious people. But the difficulties of the road between the Sogdian capital, Maracanda {Samarcand), and the first Chinese city in the province of Shensi, led to frequent efforts for opening a new and less perilous route, which, however, proved un successful. From the time they passed the Jaxartes, the enter prising Sogdians had to contend, not only with the dangers and difficulties of the intervening deserts, but also against the wan dering hordes, who have always considered the citizen and the traveller as objects of lawful rapine. Justinian first attempted to open a communication with China by sea, through his Abyssinian allies, who had recently acquired the art of navigation, the spirit of trade, and the sea-port of Adulis. This negociation failed, as has been already mentioned, but the enterprise of Christian missionaries achieved what dip lomatists had failed to accomplish. Two Persian monks had long been settled in the Chinese capital ; they saw the entire process of rearing and feeding the silk-worms, and they soon discovered that, though it would be impossible to transport so short-lived an insect into a foreign land, that the eo-o-s mio-ht be * The Armenians call the Chinese Jenk, and China Jenistan. Their relations with this country ascend to the beginning of the third century of our era. About that time a Chinese colony was established in Armenia. The chief of this colony was probably one of the imperial dynasty of the Huns : driven from his country by civil wars, he at first sought refuge at the court of Ardeshi'r, the founder of the Sassanid dynasty in Persia, thence he passed into Persia, where he was received about a.o. 260, by Tiridates, the Armenian sovereign, who gave him the province of Jaron. This per sonage, whose name was Mamkon, became the founder of the family of the Memigonians, who are justly celebrated in Armenian history."], [32, "18 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. conveyed to any distance without difficulty. Having formed this project, they undertook a long and tedious journey to Con stantinople, where they unfolded their plan to Justinian. The emperor gladly gave their proposals his sanction: thus en couraged, they returned to China, concealed a sufficient supply of eggs in a hollow cane, and came back unsuspected to Europe. Under their direction, the eggs were hatched, at a proper season, by artificial heat ; supplies of mulberry leaves were provided for the young worms, and the art of rearing the insects became an object of importance to the government. Justinian at first attempted to monopolize this source of profit, but the rapid increase of the worms opened the trade. A singular circumstance enables us to appreciate the speedy success of the Greeks in the manufacture of silk. Before the sixth century closed, the Turks, descending from the Altaian mountains, conquered Sogdiana. The conquered people had found the demand for silk rapidly diminishing, which they attributed to the commercial jealousy of the Persians. They complained of their losses to their new master, the Turkish khakan, who sent ambassadors to form a commercial treaty with the Persian monarch, the celebrated Nushirvan. It was obviously unwise policy ;o strengthen the power of the new state which had been formed beyond the Oxus ; and Nushirvan was, besides, eager to open a direct communication with China, through the Persian gulf. To show his contempt for the offers of the Sogdians, he purchassd up all their goods, and committed them to the flames. The khakan next sent ambassadors to Justinian II., who, after a toilsome journey, reached Constanti nople, a.d. 571, just twenty years after the introduction of the silk- worm ; when, to their great astonishment, they found the Byzantines in possession of silk of their own growth, and so skilled in its use, that their manufactures already rivalled those of China. From this time the Sogdian carrying-trade declined ; it was totally annihilated about the middle of the ninth century, when a fanatic insurgent, in China, murdered the foreign mer chants, and cut down the mulberry trees, to destroy the silk that enticed strangers to the celestial empire. For nearly six hundred years, the Greeks were the only"], [33, "HISTORY OF THE SILK-TRADE. 19 Europeans who possessed the silk-worm : at length, Roger I., king of Sicily, engaged in war with the Byzantine empire, having captured some persons skilled in the production and manufacture of silk, established factories at Palermo, which rose rapidly into celebrity. Thence the trade spread into Italy, Spain and France ; but in most of these countries, the manu facture was long deemed of greater importance than the pro duction of the raw material. France owes her present superiority in the trade to the patriotic exertions of Henry IV., who made extensive nurseries of mulberry plants, and distributed them gratuitously to all desirous of establishing plantations. James I. endeavoured to introduce the production of raw silk, as a trade, into England : since his time the experiment has been frequently repeated, but it never has been attended with complete success. Similar trials have also been made in Ireland, but the result has not yet answered the expectations of the patriotic projectors. Section V. \u2014 The Monarchy of the Franks, under the Merovingian. Dynasty. The history of the Franks properly begins with the establish ment of a large body of that nation in Belgic Gaul, under a chief named Mere-wig*, from whom the dynasty received the name Merovingian t. He was succeeded by his son Hilderik %, a brave warrior, but the slave of his passions. An insult that he offered to the wife of one of his officers occasioned a revolt ; Hilderik was dethroned, and a Count Egidius, or Giles, pro claimed king. After an exile of eight years, Hilderik was restored, and the remainder of his reign appears to have passed in tranquillity. Hlodo-wig \u00a7 was the next sovereign : his harsh German name was softened by the Latins into Clodovecus, or \" Mere-wig, eminent warrior. f The other Franks were named Ripe-Warians ; that is, inhabitants of the banks of the Rhine. ;\u00a3 Hilde-rik, bold in combat. \u00a7 Hlodo-wig, famous warrior."], [34, "20 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. Clovis, the origin of the modern Ludovicus, or Louis. At his accession (a.d. 481), Clovis had scarcely reached his twentieth year ; the ardour of youth combined with the circumstances of his position to urge him to foreign conquests ; for the fertility of the Belgic soil, the purity of its waters, and its atmosphere, continually attracted fresh hordes to the lower Rhine, i who sought admission into the Belgic colony. Clovis found it neces sary to enlarge his frontiers, and invaded the Roman province. Near Soissons he encountered Syagrius, the son of his father's rival, Egidius, and gained a decisive victory. Syagrius sought refuge with the Visigoths, but that nation had lost much of its martial spirit ; Alaric IL, unworthy of the name he bore, sent the unfortunate general bound to. Clovis, by whom he was be headed. The conqueror was now the most powerful monarch, and the neighbouring princes eagerly sought his alliance : he chose for his queen, Hlodohilde *, or Clotilda, whose uncle was king of the Burgundians. Clotilda was a Christian; she laboured earnestly to convert her husband, and especially urged him when his crown and life were endangered by an invasion of the Allemans. Clovis, persuaded that he owed the great victory of Tolbiac to the prayers of Clotilda, became a convert, and re ceived the sacrament of baptism from the bishop of Rheims (a. d. 496). He gave the prelate, as a fee, all the land he could ride round while he himself slept after dinner, a gift very cha racteristic of a conqueror, who felt that he had only to wake and acquire new dominions. Soon afterwards he undertook new conquests. Advancing in the direction of Genabum (Orleans'), he crossed the Loire, spreading everywhere the terror of his name. The Bretons, long subject to the Romans, consented without reluctance to a change of masters. Clovis, having tra versed their country, entered Aquitaine, pillaged the houses, laid waste the fields, plundered the temples, and returned to Paris, \" leaving,\" as the cotemporary historian says, \" nothing to the wretched inhabitants but the soil, which the Franks could not take away.\" The kingdom established by Clovis extended from the Rhine Hlodo-hilde, brilliant and noble."], [35, "21 THE MEROVINGIAN DYNASTY. to the Pyrenees, from the Alps to the ocean, but its security was very uncertain. Wherever the conqueror appeared, he met nothing but submission from the various races settled in Gaul ; as soon, however, as he passed onwards, the nominal subjects closed upon his rear, retaining no more trace of his inarch than the furrowed wave does of a vessel's keel. Neither was the Frankish monarch absolute over his own soldiers ; his army was composed of free men, who disdained to submit to despotic rule. They gave to their monarch his share of the booty, and nothing more*. When they disapproved of the expedition for which they were assembled, they abandoned it without scruple ; or if the monarch refused to undertake a war that they deemed ad visable, they forced him to comply with their wishes, not merely by menaces, but by actual violences. On the death of Clovis (a.d. 511), his dominions were divided between his four sons, Hildeberth J (Childebert), Hlo domer\u00a7 (Chlodomer), Hlodher|| (Clotaire), and Theodoricls, who respectively occupied the capitals of Paris, Orleans, Soissons, and Metz. This distribution gave rise to a new geographical division; all the districts between the Rhine, the Meuse, and * Gregory of Tours, furnishes us with a curious anecdote on this subject. \" About this time the army of Clovis pillaged a great number of churches and houses. His soldiers had taken away, from one of the cathedrals, a vase of surprising size and beauty. The bishop of the diocese sent a mes senger to reclaim it. To this man, the king said, ' Follow me to Soissons, where the plunder will be shared, and should chance give me the vase, I will do what your prelate requires.' When they reached Soissons, they went to the place where the plunder was piled, and the king said, ' I entreat you, my brave warriors, to give me this vase in addition to my share.' Upon this, a presumptuous soldier exclaimed, ' You shall have nothing but the portion assigned you by lot.' \" f The historian quoted in the preceding note, says, \"After this, Clotaire and Childebert (sons of Clovis) formed the design of marching against the Burgundians. Their brother, Theodoric, was unwilling to engage in the expedition, but the Franks who followed him, said unanimously, < If you will not join your brothers, we will quit you, and choose another leader.' \" J Hilde-berth, brilliant warrior. \u00a7 Hlodo-mer, celebrated chief. || Hlod-her, celebrated and excellent.

All that was not comprised in this division, belonged not to the Merovingian Franks, but retained its ancient name of Gaul. Chlodomer and Theodoric engaged in war with Gundumer J, king of the Burgundians. In a great battle fought near Vienne (a. d. 523), Chlodomer was slain \u00a7, but Theodoric gained a decisive victory, and added the Burgundian kingdom to his own dominions. Clotilda took the guardianship of her infant grandchildren, but the favour she showed to the three sons of Chlodomer provoked the resentment of Childebert, king of Paris. He secretly proposed to his brother Clotaire, that they should secure the persons of the young princes, shave their heads ||, and divide their dominions. Clotaire readily joined in the project, and put the two eldest of his nephews to death; the third, saved by faithful servants, cut off his hair with his own hands, and entering into a monastery, spent a life of celibacy IT.

Childebert had already spread a report that he and his brother had agreed to invest their nephews with rovaltv, and they sent a messenger to Clotilda, then residing in the same city, who said, ' Send your grandchildren, that they may be raised to the throne.'

When the children came to their uncles, they were taken and separated from their servants and gover nors. Then they shut them up apart, the children in one place, and the attendants in another. When this was done, Childebert and Clotaire sent Arcadius (one of their officers,) to the queen, with a scissors and drawn sword. When he came into her presence, showing her these, he said, ' Thy sons, our lords, desire to know thy pleasure, gracious queen, respecting the manner in which they should treat the children. Order either their hair or their throats to be cut.' Astounded by these words, and enraged at beholding the scissors and naked sword, the queen gave vent to her wrath, and, scarce knowing what she said, so troubled was her mind, imprudently replied, ' If they are not to reign like their father, I would rather see them dead than shaven.' Then Arcadius returned promptly to those who sent him, and said, ' You may persevere ; the queen approves what you have begun, and her will is, that you complete your project.' Immediately, Clotaire, taking the eldest of the children by the arm, threw him on the ground, and stabbing him under the shoulder, put him cruelly to death. His brother, terrified at the scene, threw himself at the feet of Childebert, and kissing his knees, exclaimed, ' Help me, my good father, let me not be murdered like my poor brother.' Then, Childebert, melting into tears, said to Clotaire, ' Oh ! I entreat you, my very dear brother, have the kindness to spare this child's life ; if you consent to spare him, I will give you whatever you may demand.' But Clotaire, overwhelming him with reproaches, said, ' Thrust the child away, or you shall die in his stead, for you were the first to urge me to this deed, though you now shrink from its completion.' Then Childebert, alarmed, pushed the child over to Clo taire, who struck his dagger into the boy's side, and slew him on the body of his brother. Afterwards they murdered the servants and tutors. When they were dead, Clotaire mounted his horse, without showing any compunc tion for the murder of his nephews, and retired with Childebert to the suburbs. The queen Clotilda, having placed the bodies on a bier, con ducted them, with litanies, sacred songs, and profound grief, to the church of St. Peter's, where they were buried together. One was ten years old, and the other six. The third son, named Clodoald, was saved by the interference of some brave men, called barons. Renouncing his earthly kingdom, he became a clerk, and, persisting in good works, finally received priest's orders.

Biscay, and Catalonia, stormed Pampeluna, besieged Saragossa, and were only induced to retire by a present of the tunic of St. Vincent, a relic which, in that superstitious age, was deemed an invaluable treasure. The fame of Theodobert extended to Constantinople; Jus tinian endeavoured to win his friendship, by the cession of the nominal claims which the empire retained over Provence, but the Austrasian monarch entered into alliance with Totila, crossed the Alps, and quickly subdued the greater part of northern Italy. After his return, the army he left behind met with some reverses, and the inflated vanity of Justinian led him to issue a medal, on which he styled himself Conqueror of the Franks. Theodobert was so enraged at this arrogance, that he prepared to lead an army through Hungary into Thrace, and assail Justinian in his capital, but this daring enterprise was frustrated by his sudden death; he was killed by the fall of a tree (a. d. 548), while hunting the wild buffalo, a dangerous sport, to which he was passionately addicted. Theodobald * succeeded to the Austrasian throne, but died after an inglorious reign of seven years. Childebert soon followed him to the tomb, and thus Clotaire acquired the sole, but not the undisturbed, possession of Neustria and Austrasia. His own son, Chramnet, headed a revolt of the turbulent Bretons, but he was defeated and barbarously put to death, with his entire family J, by command of his cruel father.

Clotaire left four sons, \u2014 Charibert*, Gontramt, Chilperic :\u00a3, and Sigebert\u00a7, who shared his dominions. The turbulent period that followed, is principally remarkable for the troubles occa sioned by the crimes of two infamous women, Brunilda and Fredegonda, the wives of Sigebcrt and Chilperic. Fredegonda had won her way to the throne by murdering Galswintha, the sister of her rival; and the jealousy between two ambitious and unprincipled women was aggravated, on one side, by the desire of revenge, and, on the other, by the difficulty of maintaining her dignity, when she was changed from a mistress into a wife. During the long period over which their resentments spread, it is difficult to distinguish anything but murders and assassi nations, in the gloomy annals of the time. Fredegonda pro cured the death of Sigebert, and afterwards of Chilperic and his two sons, being chiefly enraged against Merovee||, who had married Brunilda. Childebert inherited the kingdom of his father, Sigebert, and that of his uncle, Gontram ; aided by his mother, Brunilda, he maintained a long and sanguinary struggle ao-ainst Fredegonda, and her young son, Clotaire ; but he died early, leaving two children to divide his distracted dominions. Both of these were destroyed by Brunilda, whose hatred they had provoked by remonstrating against her crimes, and after a dreary scene of confusion, France was again united into a single monarchy, under Clotaire II. , son of Chilperic and Fredegonda (a.d. 613). His first care was to punish Brunilda, the ancient enemy of his mother and his house : she was exhibited for three days mounted on a camel, to the derision of the army, subjected to the most cruel tortures, and finally fastened to the tail of a wild horse, which tore her wretched carcass to pieces, in the pre sence of the soldiers. Clotaire published a code of laws, which enioys some reputation ; but his administration was deficient in vigour and during his reign several encroachments were made on the royal power, by the ambitious nobles.

The successors of Dagobert were mere phantoms of royalty ; the entire sovereignty was possessed by the mayors of the palace, who finally acquired absolute possession of half the monarchy, as dukes of Austrasia. Pepin D'Heristal, the greatest of these nominal ministers, and real monarchs, governed France in the name of several successive kings. After his death (a. d. 714), his power descended to his grandson, Theodobald, a child only eight years of age, who was thus singularly appointed guardian to a king that was not yet sixteen. Karlt, the natural son of Pepin, better known in history by the name of Charles Martel, set aside this absurd arrangement, and succeeded to more than his father's power. His numerous victories over the Saxons, Burgundians, Frisians, &c, have rendered his name illustrious\"; but he is more justly celebrated for his triumph over the Sara cenic invaders of France (a.d. 732), between Tours and Poitiers, by which he delivered Christendom from the imminent danger of being subjected to the Mohammedan yoke. His son, Pepin finally compelled Chilperic III. to abdicate (a. d. T&2), and the crown of France was thus transferred to the Carlovino-ian dynasty, from the descendants of Clovis. * The cause of his canonization is singularly illustrative of the super stitions of the age. Audoald, bishop of Poictiers, while on an embassy in Sicily, was miraculously, as he declared, informed of the long's death by a holy hermit, named John. This pious anchoret said, \" While I was asleep last night, an old man with a long beard bade me get up, and pray for the soul of King Dagobert, who was on the point of death. I arose, and looking through the window of my hermitage, I saw, in the middle of the sea, a host of devils carrying the king's soul to hell.

The emperor, Justin II. , unwisely abandoned the Gepid\u00e6 to their fate ; Cunimund, their monarch, hasted to encounter Alboin before he could join the Avars, but he fell in the field that proved fatal to the existence of his nation, and his skull was formed into a drinking vessel by his barbarous enemy. Rosamond, the daughter of the slaughtered king, became the prize and spouse of the victor; the bravest of the surviving Gepid\u00e6 were incorporated in the army of the Lombards. Though the Avars had contributed but slightly to the success of the war, they received a large share of the spoils ; the greater part of ancient Dacia was resigned to them, and in this country their chagans ruled for more than two hundred years. Alboin's ambition was fixed on a higher object ; fifteen years before, a body of Lombards had served under Narses in the conquest of Italy, and they still preserved a vivid remembrance of the wealth and fertility of the peninsula. Alboin encouraged them to hope that this fair land might yet own their sway, and to stimulate their ardour, produced some of its finest fruits at a royal feast. When his designs became known, adventurers flocked to his standard from the neighbour ing Slavonic and German tribes. Having made every prepara tion for the expedition, the Lombards resigned their lands to the Avars, on the simple promise of receiving them back, if they failed in the conquest of Italy. As if the court of Constantinople had resolved to aid the projects of the invaders, the brave Narses was contumeliously removed from his post by the Empress Sophia ; and Longinus, a person wholly unacquainted with Italy, appointed exarch in his C 2 N"], [42, "28 FALL OF THE -WESTERN EMPIRE. stead. Alboin met no army to oppose him in the field ; few even of the cities ventured to resist his progress ; Ticinum, or, as it began now to be called, Pavia, almost alone closed its gates against the conqueror, and detained him three years before its walls. It was at length forced to yield by the pressure of hunger ; Alboin threatened a general massacre, but his horse happening to stumble as he entered the gates, he believed that heaven had sent this omen to warn him against cruelty, and he assured the trembling multitude of pardon and safety. Before he could regulate the affairs of the kingdom he had so easily won, Alboin fell a victim to the revenge of his wife. One even- ing, heated with wine, he sent her the skull of her father Cuni- mund, fashioned, as has been stated, into a goblet, filled to the brim, with an insulting message, that she should rejoice with her sire. Rosamond, stifling her resentment, simply replied, \" Let the will of the king be obeyed;\" but she secretly resolved on vengeance, and, by infamous means, procured two officers of the household to murder her husband (a. d. 573). She was compelled to fly with her paramour to the court of Ravenna, where she was poisoned by a potion which she had prepared for \"the partner of her guilt. Clepho, one of the noblest of the Lombard chiefs, was chosen king after the murder of Alboin, by the great council of the nation ; but at the end of eighteen months, he was stabbed by a domestic. His cruelty gave the Lombards such a distaste for royalty, that after his death, they changed their form of govern ment, and for ten years, were ruled of thirty-six dukes, each of whom was chief of some important city. During this period, they made several efforts to acquire possession of some part of Gaul, but were invariably beaten by the Franks ; in Italy, on the contrary, they were generally successful, adding consider ably to their territories at the expense of the exarchate of Ravenna. A confederacy between the imperial exarch and Childebert, king of the Franks, so alarmed the Lombards, that they chose Autharis, son of Clepho, for their sovereign. He established a perfectly feudal monarchy, assigning their duchies to the dukes in perpetuity, on the condition of their giving one moiety of their"], [43, "29 THE LOMBARD MONARCHY. revenue to support the royal dignity ; they could not be de prived of their possessions except for high-treason, but they held power only at the sovereign's will. A similar form of govern ment seems to have prevailed among the Franks almost from the foundation of their monarchy ; but feudal law first received a complete form among the Lombards, and the rules respecting the succession, acquisition, and investiture of fiefs among other nations, were generally derived from their code. The new monarch gained several victories over the Franks, who had been bribed to invade Italy by the Emperor Maurice, and punished the hostility of the Byzantine by subduing a great part of ancient Samnium, which he formed into the duchy of Bene vento. Autharis died without issue (a. d. 590), after a brief but glorious reign, and the crown was transferred to Agilulf, duke of Turin. Hitherto the Lombards had been either Arians or pagans ; but Agilulf, instigated by his queen, established the Catholic faith throughout his dominions, and chastised several dukes who made this change a pretext for rebellion. His son and successor, Adaluald, completed the triumph of the orthodox faith, a cir cumstance that tended greatly to reconcile the Italians to the supremacy of the Lombards. The Arian party were, however, sufficiently powerful to raise another to the throne ; both the rivals, however, died without issue, and the general assembly chose Rotharis for their sovereign (a.d. 636). This monarch, though tainted with the Arian heresy, won the affection of all his subjects by the wise laws he enacted ; he also wrested some important places from the exarch of Ravenna, and reduced the imperial interest in Italy so low, that it might be said to exist only by the sufferance of the Lombards. On his death (a. d. 652), a scene of weakness and revolution followed, which was only terminated by the accession of Grimvald, duke of Bene vento (a. d. 662). Grimvald was soon involved in war with the Franks, whom he completely defeated. Scarcely had he repelled this invasion when the Byzantine emperor, Constans, appeared in Italy at the head of a powerful army, and laid siege to Benevento. But the imperialists, meeting a fierce resistance from the garrison,"], [44, "30 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. were soon forced to retreat, and being overtaken on their march, were routed with great slaughter. Constans fled to Sicily with the shattered remnant of his forces, and was murdered in a bath by some of his own servants. Grimvald did not long survive his triumph ; he died universally lamented (a. d. 672), and his death was followed by a series of obscure and uninteresting revolutions, which, however, deluged Italy with blood. The accession of Luitprand (a. d. 71 1), once more restored the prosperity of the Lombards ; he enacted several wise laws, rectified the evils that during the recent disturbances had crept into the administration of justice, and won the favour of the nobles that had opposed his elevation by a judicious display of courage and prudence. Unfortunately, he was prompted by ambition to attempt the complete conquest of Italy ; taking advantage of the troubles occasioned by the edicts of the Emperor Leo for the destruction of images. The exarchate was invaded, and Ravenna taken ; but Luitprand's success provoked the jealousy of the pope, who, though pleased with the punish ment of the Iconoclasts*, was byjio means gratified with the accession of power to the Lombards. At the pontiff's instiga tion, the Venetians aided the exarch to recover Ravenna ; but Leo, instead of showing any gratitude to Pope Gregory II. for his interference, sent emissaries to arrest him, and he was only saved from a prison by the prompt interference of Luitprand. The Italians, provoked at Leo's fierce zeal against images, began to revolt, and several cities voluntarily submitted to the Lombard monarch, who pretended to an extravagant zeal for the Catholic faith. The pope, however, dreaded Luitprand, and sought a protection in Charles Martel; the emperor of Byzantium was equally hostile to the Lombards and the pontiff. Italy was distracted by religious disputes and political jealousies, while the death of Luitprand, at this critical period (a. d. 743), afflicted the Lombards with a new series of revolutionary wars. After some minor changes, Astulphus was chosen king (a.d. 751); during his reign, the kingdom of the Lombards touched the summit of its greatness; he subdued the exarchate of Ravenna, and changed it into a new dukedom, and then led * Image-breakers."], [45, "31 THE LOMBARD MONARCHY. his forces against Rome, which, nominally subject to the emperor, was really governed by the pope. Alarmed at the danger that threatened him, Pope Stephen first applied for aid to the emperor, but finding that the Byzantine court cared little for Italy, he appealed to Pepin, the first monarch of the Carlo vingian dynasty in France. Pepin immediately crossed the Alps with a powerful army, besieged Astulphus in Pavia, and forced him to purchase peace by the cession not only of the places he had seized in the Roman dukedom, but also of the exarchate and the March of Ancona, to the Holy See. The Franks had to return a second time to compel the fulfilment of these engagements ; Astulphus once more submitted, but secretly resolved to renew the war on a favourable opportunity ; before his preparations were completed, however, he was killed by a fall from his horse, and the Lombard kingdom distracted by a disputed succession. By the aid of the pope, Desiderius prevailed in the contest ; but subsequently being exposed to the jealousy of the pontifical power, he tried to secure himself by giving his daughters in marriage to Charles and Carloman, the two sons of Pepin. This alliance was of no long duration; Charles divorced his wife under pretence of her barrenness ; and Desiderius, in revenge, endeavoured to persuade the pope to anoint Carloman's children monarchs of the Franks. Adrian I., who then filled the pontifical chair, steadily refused ; Desiderius invaded his dominions, and the pope, unable to make effective resistance, placed himself under the protection of Charles, or, as he is more commonly called, Charlemagne. The king of the Franks crossed the Alps, and, after a brief war, put an end to the kingdom of the Lombards by the capture of Pavia (a. d. 774). Desiderius and his family were sent into France, where they died in obscurity ; Charlemagne, as conqueror, received the iron crown of Lombardy. Section VII.\u2014 The Anglo-Saxons. When Britain was deserted by the Romans, the country re mained exposed to the savage incursions of the Picts and Scots ;"], [46, "32 FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. the inhabitants, unable to protect themselves, and refused aid by the emperors, who were oppressed by other barbarians, deserted their habitations, abandoned their fields, and sought shelter in the hills and woods, where they suffered equally from famine and the enemy. When the retreat of the barbarians afforded them a temporary respite, they wasted their energies in theo logical controversies arising out of the Pelagian heresy; and when the invasions were renewed, domestic rancour prevented their combining for their common defence. Vortigern, prince of Dumnonium, advised his countrymen to seek foreign aid ; and they, forgetting prudence in the extremity of their fears, invited the Saxons to their aid from Germany. The Saxons, from small beginnings, had gradually extended their sway from the mouth of the Rhine to the coast of Jut land ; their piratical vessels scoured the seas of western Europe ; and the maritime cities of Gaul, Spain, and Britain were fre quently plundered by their corsairs, or forced to purchase safety by the payment of a large tribute. Among the chiefs of their warlike tribes, none enjoyed greater authority than the two brothers Hengist and Horsa, who claimed to be descended from Woden, the tutelary god of the nation. To these leaders the application of Vortigern was made ; they readily accepted his invitation, and, accompanied by about sixteen hundred of their countrymen, landed in the isle of Thanet. The Picts and Scots were subdued with so much facility, that the adventurers began to reflect how easily they might conquer a nation unable to resist such feeble invaders ; instead of returning home, they invited over fresh hordes of their countrymen, and received from Germany a reinforcement of five thousand men. A long and cruel series of wars ensued, in which the Saxons and another barbarous tribe, the Angles, continually supported by crowds of volunteers from Germany, triumphed over the Britons in almost every encounter, and finally drove the miserable remnant of the nation to seek refuge in the mountains of Wales and Cornwall. The struggle lasted nearly one hundred and fifty years, and ended in the division of southern Britain into seven Saxon kingdoms, commonly called the Heptarchy. The Christian religion was first established in the kingdom of"], [47, "33 THE ANGLO-SAXONS. Kent, the earliest and long the most powerful of the Saxon monarchies. Ethelbert, its sovereign, though a pagan, had married a Christian princess, Bertha, the daughter of Caribert, one of the successors of Clovis, and had promised to allow her the free exercise of her religion. Bertha, by the excellence of her conduct, acquired considerable infl uence over the mind both of her husband and his courtiers ; her popularity was probably one of the principal motives that induced Pope Gregory the Great to send missionaries into England*. Augustine, the chief of the mission, was honourably received at the court of Ethelbert (a. d. 597), and began to preach the gospel to the people of Kent. The rigid austerity of his manners, and the severe penances to which he subjected himself, wrought power fully upon the minds of a barbarous people, and induced them readily to believe the pretended miracles he wrought for their conversion. Ethelbert and the great majority of his subjects were soon received into the church, and Augustine was conse crated the first archbishop of Canterbury. The petty wars between the princes of the Heptarchy are totally devoid of interest, and the history of the separate king doms is little more than a list of obscure names. An exception may be made in favour of Offa, king of Mercia, who zealously laboured to extend the power of the Romish See in England, and founded the magnificent monastery of St. Alban's. So considerable were his power and fame, that the Emperor Charle magne sought his friendship and alliance ; Offa, at his desire, sent the celebrated Alcuin to the court of Charlemagne, and * It is said that this prelate, while yet in a private station, beheld some Saxon youths exposed for sale in the slave-market at Rome. Struck with their beauty, he inquired to what country they belonged, and being told they were Angli, exclaimed, \" They would not be Angli, but Angeli (angels), if they were Christians.\" Continuing his questions, he asked the name of their province ; he was told Delri (a district of Northumberland). \" Deiri .'\" he exclaimed; \" De ira (from the wrath of God), they are sum moned to his mercy.\" He further asked the name of their king, and hear ing that it was \u00c6lla, or Alia, he joyously cried out, \" Allelujah ! we must endeavour that the praises of God bo sung in that country.\" Moved by these punning allusions, he designed to visit Britain himself as a missionary, but being detained by the Roman people, he embraced the earliest oppor tunity of entrusting the task to qualified legates. C 3"], [48, "FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. 34 this learned Saxon became the emperor's preceptor in the sciences. To Alouin France was indebted for all the polite learning it boasted of in that and the following ages; the universities of Paris, Tours, Fulden, Soissons, and many others, owe to him their origin and increase ; those of which he was not the superior and founder, being at least enlightened by his doctrine and example, and enriched by the benefits he procured them from Charlemagne. The kingdom of Mercia had nearly obtained the sovereignty of the Heptarchy when Egbert ascended the throne of Wessex (a. d. 799), as the kingdom of the West Saxons was called. He broke down the Mercian power, aided not a little by the hatred with which the tyrannical conduct of the Mercians had inspired the subject nations. His policy was as conspicuous as his valour, and both enabled him to unite the realm of England into an orderly monarchy, possessing tranquillity within itself, and secure from foreign invasion. This great event occurred (a.d. 827), nearly four hundred years after the first arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain."], [49, "35 CHAPTER II. THE RISE AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. Section I. \u2014 Political and Social Condition of the East at the coming of Mohammed. The reign of Justin II. , the nephew and successor of Justinian, at Constantinople, was remarkable only for disgrace abroad\" and misery at home. At his death (a. d. 578), he bequeathed the empire to Tiberius, whose virtues amply justified his choice; but the reign of Tiberius lasted only four years ; he was suc ceeded by Maurice, who inherited many of his predecessor's virtues as well as his crown. Soon after his accession, the attention of the emperor was directed to the unsettled state of Persia, which had been distracted by sanguinary civil wars since the death of the great Nushirvan. Horniuz, the son and successor of that monarch, was deposed and slain; Bahram, a brave general, but a feeble statesman, usurped the throne, and Khosrii or Chosroes, the legitimate heir, sought shelter in the Byzantine empire. Maurice levied a powerful army to restore the royal exile, and entrusted its command to Narses, a valiant general, who was himself of Persian descent. The expedition was crowned with success; Bahram, driven beyond the Oxus, died by poison, and Khosru, grateful for his recovered throne, entered into close alliance with the emperor. Freed from all danger on the side of Persia, Maurice resolved to turn his arms against the Avars ; but the incapacity of his generals, and his own avarice, provoked the resentment of the soldiers; they mutinied, and marched to Constantinople under the command of one of their centurions, named Phocas. Had the metropolis continued faithful, this sedition might have been easily quelled; but the licentious populace, disgusted by the parsimony of their sovereign, assaulted him as he walked in a"], [50, "36 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. religious procession, and compelled him to seek safety in his palace. The unfortunate emperor was compelled to abdicate ; Phocas was tumultuously invested with the purple, and wel comed into Constantinople by the acclamations of a thoughtless people. The tyrant commenced his reign by dragging Maurice from the sanctuary where he had sought refuge, murdering his five sons successively before his eyes, and then putting the deposed monarch to death by torture (a. d. 602). One of the royal nurses attempted to save the prince entrusted to her charge, by presenting her own child to the executioners in his stead ; but Maurice refused to sanction the deceit, and as each blow of the axe fell on the necks of his children, he exclaimed, with pious resignation, \" Righteous art thou, O Lord, and just are thy judgments !\" The usurpation of Phocas was basely sanctioned by Pope Gregory, who received in return for his adulation the title of Universal Bishop. But the pontiff's flatteries could not save the tyrant from the resentment of his subjects, who soon dis covered their error in preferring such a miscreant to the virtuous Maurice. Heraclius, exarch of Africa, invited by the unanimous voice of the empire, sailed to Constantinople ; scarcely had his fleet appeared in the Hellespont, when the citizens and imperial guards entered the palace, bound Phocas in chains, and sent him a helpless captive to his rival (a. d. 610). Heraclius reproached him with his manifold vices, to which the deposed tyrant simply replied, \" Wilt thou govern better ?\" These were the last words of Phocas ; after suffering much variety of insult and torture, he was beheaded, and his mangled body thrown into the sea. But the death of Phocas did not deliver the empire from the calamities his crimes had produced ; Khosrii Parviz had no sooner learned the sad fate of his benefactor Maurice, than he assembled the entire strength of Persia to avenge his murder. The unwise system of persecution which had been gradually established both by the Byzantine prelates and emperors, sup plied the invader with allies in every province ; the Jews, the Nestorians, and the Jacobites, believed with reason that they would find the worshippers of fire more tolerant than the"], [51, "37 THE EAST AT THE COMING OF MOHAMMED. orthodox Christians ; and scarcely had the Persians crossed the Euphrates, when insurrections were raised in their favour throughout Syria. Khosru, victorious in two decisive battles, was encouraged to undertake the hereditary enterprise of the Sassanid dynasty, \u2014 the restoration of the Persian empire. Heraclius had scarcely ascended the throne, when he received intelligence of the fall of Antioch ; and this was soon followed by the account of the storming of Jerusalem, where the Jews, encouraged by the Persians, wreaked dreadful vengeance on the heads of their Christian persecutors (a. d. 614). The fugitives from Palestine sought refuge in Egypt, where they were hos pitably entertained by the archbishop of Alexandria. But Egypt itself, where the din of arms had not been heard since the reign of Dioclesian, was invaded, conquered, and for a time annexed to the Persian empire (a. d. 616). Asia Minor was subdued with equal facility; in a single campaign, the Persian army advanced from the banks of the Euphrates to the shores of the Thracian Bosphorus, and during ten years their hostile camp was in sight of the towers of Constantinople. While Khosru was indulging in the pride that such brilliant conquests inspired, and dazzling his subjects by the display of his magnificent plunder, he received an epistle from the almost unknown city of Mecca, written by an obscure individual, who yet claimed the king's obedience, and demanded to be recog nised as the prophet of God. The grandson of Nushirvan was indignant at such a claim; he tore the letter to pieces, and flung the fragments to the winds. When this was reported to the writer, Mohammed, then beginning for the first time to taste the sweets of gratified ambition, and to find his prospects enlarging as he ascended the height of power, he exclaimed, \" It is thus that God will rend the kingdom of Khosru !\" a prophecy which, like many others, not a little accelerated its own accomplishment. While the Asiatic provinces were thus a prey to the Persians, Constantinople itself was so hardly pressed by the Avars, that Heraclius was on the point of abandoning the capital, and seek ing refuge with his treasures in Carthage. He was with diffi culty dissuaded from this dishonourable measure by the entrea-"], [52, "38 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. ties of the patriarch; but his prospects appeared to become darker every hour; the Avars, by a treacherous attack, had nearly seized the capital, and the ambassadors sent to supplicate pardon and peace from Khosru, were dismissed with contumely and scorn; the Persian despot declaring, that he would not grant peace until either Heraclius was brought bound in chains to his footstool, or had abjured Christianity and embraced the Magian religion. For about twelve years Heraclius had patiently witnessed the calamities of the empire without making any effort to protect his subjects; but this last insult roused his slumbering energies, and he entered on a career as glorious as his former inactivity had been disgraceful. He did not venture with his raw levies to attack the Persian camp at Chalcedon ; but he passed over to the coast of Cilicia, and fortified himself on the ground where Alexander had fought the battle of Issus, not far from the modern town of Scanderoon, whose excellent harbour offered a good station for the imperial fleet. A splendid victory over the Persian cavalry enabled him to establish his winter-quarters in Cappadocia, on the banks of the Halys (Kizil Irmak), and to mature his plans for one of the boldest enterprises recorded in history, \u2014 the invasion of Persia through its northern provinces (a. d. 623). Early in the ensuing spring, Heraclius, with a chosen band of five thousand men, sailed from Constantinople to Trebizond, assembled his forces from the southern regions, and, joined by the Christians of Armenia, entered the province of Atropatene (Azerbijdn). Tauris (Tabriz), the ancient and modern capital of the country, was taken by storm, almost in sight of Khosrii's army, while the Persian monarch had neither the courage to hazard a battle, nor the justice to conclude an equitable peace. Several equally glorious campaigns followed, the greater part of Persia was overrun by the victorious Byzan tines; they defeated the Asiatics wherever they encountered them, and marched in one direction as far as the Caspian, in the other to Ispahan, destroying in their progress all Khosrii's splendid palaces, plundering his hoarded treasures, and dis persing in every direction the countless slaves of his pleasure. Khosru made no effort to stop the mighty work of ruin, and"], [53, "39 THE EAST AT THE COMING OF MOHAMMED. yet he rejected the terms of peace offered him by the humanity of the conqueror. His subjects soon lost all regard for a monarch whom they deemed the sole cause of the desolation of his country; a conspiracy -was formed against him, he was deposed by his eldest son Shiroueh, cast into a dungeon, and put to death, by an unnatural prince, who pretended that he was com pelled to the parricide by the clamours and importunities of the people and nobles of the empire. After six glorious campaigns, Heraclius returned to Constan tinople, bringing with him the wood of the \" True Cross,\" which Khosru had taken at Jerusalem, \u2014 a precious relic, which was deemed a more splendid trophy of his victories than all his spoils and conquests. The kingdom of Persia, exhausted by the late sanguinary contest, was left to perish under the accumu lated evils of a dreadful famine, the disputes of proud and luxurious nobles, a succession of weak sovereigns, or rather pageants of power, and the attack of a new and terrible enemy. The flame which Mohammed had kindled in Arabia already began to spread, and to threaten an equal fate to the degraded and decaying monarchies of Byzantium and Persia. Victory itself was fatal to Heraclius ; the best and bravest of his soldiers had perished in the sanguinary war, his treasury was empty, taxes were levied with difficulty in the desolated provinces, and the emperor himself, as if exhausted by his great efforts, sunk into hopeless lethargy. While Heraclius was enjoying the empty honours of a triumph, the Saracens appeared on the confines of Syria : thenceforth the empire sunk rapidly before their fanatic valour ; and in the last eight years of his reign, the emperor lost to them all that he had rescued from the Persians. Section II. \u2014 State of Arabia at the coming of Mohammed. The peninsula of Arabia is in shape a large and irregular tri angle, between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Ethiopia ; its extreme length is about fifteen hundred miles, and its mean breadth"], [54, "40 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. about seven hundred. Though it contains several lofty ranges of mountains, the greater part of the country consists of level, sand}', and arid plains, which can support but few inhabi tants. Water is difficult to be obtained; there is scarcely any wood to shelter from the direct and intense rays of a tro pical sun; the winds, instead of being refreshing breezes, fre quently come loaded with pestilential vapours, or raise eddying billows of sand that have overwhelmed, not only caravans, but entire armies'. The high lands that border on the Indian Ocean are distinguished by a superior abundance of wood and water, and hence this part of the peninsula has beeu called Happy Arabia: but the groves, even of this favoured district, are thinly scattered; the streams, though pure, are small; and the country could only be deemed delightful by persons whose eyes were unaccustomed to vegetation, and who had often felt the want of a cooling shade or a refreshing drink. The northern part of Arabia is occupied by ranges of naked, rocky mountains, from which it received the name of Arabia Petr\u00e6a, or the Stony ; but, notwithstanding its rugged and desert aspect, it was in ancient times the centre of a flourishing trade, being the great high road of trade between Egypt and south-eastern Asia. The Arabs are an original and unmixed race ; they boast that their country has never been subdued, but the greater part of it has little that could tempt the cupidity of a conqueror. In the reign of Trajan, the Romans made Arabia Petr\u00e6a a province ; Yemen, or Arabia Felix, has been frequently subject to Persia, and about the time of Mohammed's appearance, the southern part of the peninsula was ruled by the Najashi of Ethiopia. The Arab is not very robust, but he is active and well made, able to endure great fatigue, and, both from habit and education, reckless of danger. In his mental constitution, he displays quickness rather than intelligence ; his imagination is warm, but his judgment is not vigorous. In all his pleasures, dangers, and fatigues, he makes the horse and camel of his deserts asso ciates rather than servants, and these animals appear to have obtained an actual superiority in Arabia, from being elevated into the companions of their masters. The horse of Arabia is equally remarkable for speed, temper, and power of endurance;"], [55, "41 ARABIA AT THE COMING OF MOHAMMED. and it is remarkable that the best breeds of this animal in Europe, Asia, and Africa, have been derived from an Arabian stock. The camel and dromedary of the desert are regarded by the Arab as scarcely inferior to his horse. This patient and powerful animal supplies him with milk for his sustenance, transports his property and family from one quarter of the desert to another, and, when occasion requires, enables him to pursue or fly from his enemy with almost incredible speed. The ancient religion of Arabia was the Sab\u00e6an form of idolatry, which consisted in the worship of the sun, moon, and planets ; but long before the coming of Mohammed, they were distracted by a great variety of creeds ; some adhered to the faith of their ancestors, others embraced Judaism, and several tribes became Christians. Unfortunately Christianity, when introduced into the peninsula, had been deeply sullied by man's devices ; the different Christian tribes were imbued with a fierce sectarian spirit, and hated each other more bitterly than Jews or pagans. The vivid imaginations of the Arabs led them to investigate questions beyond the powers of man's understanding ; and the consequence was so abundant a supply of new doctrines, that one of the early fathers described Arabia as the land most fruitful in heresies. The principal Arabian cities of ancient times were in Yemen; but their fame was destined to be eclipsed by the glories of Mecca and Medina, both in the Hejaz, the two great sanctua ries of the national religion. Mecca was a place of considerable trade from the earliest stages^ being situated at the intersection of two important routes, that between Syria and Arabia Felix, and that between Abyssinia or Upper Egypt, and south-eastern Asia. Commerce flourished under the sanctuary of religion. The temple of Mecca was regarded as the national metropolis of the Arabic faith, before Judaism and Christianity appeared in the peninsula; its custody raised the Koreishites to a rank above the other tribes, and the failure of the attempt made to storm it by the Ethiopians in the very year that Mohammed was born, may be considered the great check that impeded, or rather prevented, the further extension of Christianity in the country. Mecca is built in a winding valley at the foot of three"], [56, "42 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. barren mountains ; the soil is a rock, and the waters brackish. The pastures are remote from the city,\" and good fruits cannot be procured at a nearer place than the gardens of Tayef, which are about seventy miles distant. The Arabs believe that Mecca was founded by Adam, and the temple erected by Abraham. Its early prosperity they ascribe to Ishmael, who fixed his residence there, because, as their traditions assert, the brackish well Zemzem was that to which Hagar was directed by the angel. It must have been a very ancient city if, as commentators suppose, it was the Mesha which Moses mentions as inhabited by the posterity of Joktan*. Medina, called Yatreb before the appearance of Moha mined, enjoys more natural advantages than Mecca ; but it is not so conveniently situated for traffic. Its citizens appear to have been always jealous of the supremacy claimed by the Meccans, and this probably induced them to espouse the cause of Moham med when he was banished by their rivals. Literature was zealously cultivated by the ancient Arabs ; they were enthusiastically attached to eloquence and poetry, for both of which their rich, harmonious language affords peculiar facilities. A meeting of the tribes was held annually, at which the poets recited their compositions, and those which were judged the best, were preserved in the public treasury. The most cele brated of these were seven poems called Moallakat, which were written on Egyptian silk in letters of gold, and suspended in the Kaaba, or temple of Mecca. Science was not similarly valued; their history was merely genealogical tables ; their astro nomy such a rude knowledge of the stars as served to mark the variation of the seasons ; and the mechanical arts were almost wholly neglected. They used to say that God had given them four peculiarities, \u2014 turbans instead of diadems ,- tents instead of houses ; swords instead of fortresses ; and poems instead of written laws. * Gen. x. and xxxi."], [57, "43 PREACHING OF MOHAMMED. Section III. \u2014 The Preaching of Mohammed. Mohammed, the great legislator of the Arabians, and the founder of a religion that has long prevailed over the fairest portions of the globe, was born at Mecca. His father, Abd allah, was an idolater ; but his mother, Emina, was a Jewess that had been converted to Christianity, and from her early instructions, he probably derived the religious impressions for which he was distinguished even in boyhood. Both his parents died while he was yet a child, but their place was supplied by his uncles, Abd-al-Motalleb, and Abu-Taleb, the latter of whom became a tender parent to the orphan. At the age of thirteen he accompanied Abu-Taleb on a mercantile journey into Syria, and soon after made his first campaign against some neighbour ing tribes of predatory Arabs. From this time Mohammed appears to have engaged actively in trade. He displayed so much talent, that a rich widow, named Kadijah, appointed him her chief pastor ; and after some years, was so pleased with his zeal and industry, that she gave him her hand in marriage, and made him master of her splendid fortune. After his marriage Mohammed ranked among the first citizens of Mecca, and it must be added that he was not cor rupted by good fortune. The earliest use he made of prosperity was to relieve his kind guardian and uncle Abu Taleb, who had fallen into distress; he placed Abu-Taleb above want, and undertook the education of a portion of his family. Little is known of Mohammed's history during the next fif teen years, but there is every reason to believe that this interval was spent in maturing his plans for the great revolution he con templated. Every year he retired for a month to a cave in Mount Hira, near Mecca, where he spent his time in meditation and prayer. His travels as a merchant had made him acquainted with the principal forms of religion that then prevailed in the East. In Syria he met Christians of various sects, Jews, Ma gians, and Sab\u00e6ans ; Arabia presented to him countless varie ties of idolatry ; exiles from the Persian and Byzantine empires informed him of the dangerous doctrines preached by Mani and"], [58, "ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. 44 Mazdak. A singular dream led him to believe that he was chosen by the Deity to reconcile all these jarring creeds, and to unite mankind in the worship of the one true God. In the solitude of his cave he dreamed that the angel Gabriel appeared to him, and hailed him as a prophet. On his return, he announced his mission to Kadijah, who at once recognised his claims. Her example was followed by Ali, the son of Abu- Taleb, by Abu-Bekr, Othman, and a few friends accustomed to regard the recluse of Hira with reverence. These converts were called Mussulmans, that is, persons re signed to the divine will ; their faith was confirmed by revela tions which Mohammed pretended to receive from Gabriel, and which, as he did not then know how to read and write, or at least but imperfectly, he communicated orally to his disciples. These revelations were preserved by them in a volume, which they called the Koran, or book that ought to be read. The progress of the new religion was slow ; many of Mohammed's friends rejected his prophetic claims with something like horror, and three years elapsed before he ventured to announce his mission publicly. Having invited his friends and relatives to a splendid banquet, he declared to them that God had chosen him to preach the doctrine of the divine unity ; Ali, with the gener ous enthusiasm of youth, warmly offered to support the pro phet's claims, but many of the other guests doubted or laughed them to scorn. Undismayed by the imperfect result of his first essay, Mo hammed began to preach to the people of Mecca in the market place. Converts were made slowly ; and the guardians of the city opposed doctrines that threatened to subvert the influence they derived from the worship of the Kaaba. Several of the Mussulmans, most remarkable for their zeal, were forced by persecution to abandon their homes, and seek refuge in Abyssinia; but the spirit of Mohammed quailed not ; he refused to quit Mecca, and when asked to suspend his preaching for a season, he replied, \" Were my enemies to place the sun on my right hand, and the moon on my left, they would not reduce me to silence.\" At one of the great annual fairs held in Mecca, Mohammed"], [59, "PREACHING OF MOHAMMED. 45 preached his mission to the merchants assembled from all parts of Arabia. Among his auditors were some citizens of Yatreb, or, as it was afterwards called, Medina, whom peculiar circum stances rendered attentive to his claims. The Yatrebites had just conquered a Jewish tribe ; they heard their captives boast of their speedy liberation on the coming of the Messiah, and sup posing that the new prophet might be the expected deliverer, they resolved to conciliate his favour. Mohammed profited by their delusion ; and this appears to have been his first direct step in imposture, though in the tangled web of human motives, it is hard to say where enthusiasm ends and fraud begins. Inspired by his success with the Yatrebites, and some other tribes in the interior of Arabia, Mohammed, who had hitherto preached patience and submission under persecution, directed his disciples to defend themselves when attacked, declaring that all who died in defence of his person or his creed, would assuredly inherit Paradise. At the same time he averred that he had been taken up into heaven by Gabriel, and admitted to a personal interview with the Omnipotent. The Meccan chiefs, enraged at his hardihood, took measures for his destruction, and he could only save his life by a speedy retreat to Yatreb. This event, called Hejira (the flight), occurred about the fifty-third year of the prophet's age (a. d. 622), and is the era used by all Mohammedan nations. Mohammed was received in triumph at Yatreb ; he changed its name to Medinet al-nabi (the city of the prophet), or Medina (the city), which it still retains. Converts flocked to Medina, and were formed into warlike bands, who infested all the roads to Mecca, and took severe vengeance for the insult offered to their master. The plunder was shared equally among the soldiers; enthusiasm generally insured success; and warriors from all parts of the peninsula were attracted by the hopes of wealth and glory. In one of the frequent encounters between the Meccans and Mussulmans, near the well Bedr, Mohammed was on the point of being defeated, when he stooped down, took up a handful of dust and flung it towards the enemy, exclaim ing, \" May their faces be confounded !\" this simple action re vived the courage of his followers; they gained a decisive"], [60, "46 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. victory, which he failed not to ascribe to a miraculous inter position. After this success Mohammed made a great change in the character of his religion ; hitherto he had preached patience and toleration ; he now began to inculcate the doctrine of propagating the true faith by the sword, and of executing divine vengeance on idolaters and unbelievers. The Jews became special objects of his hatred ; he seems to have hoped that they would acknow ledge him as their Messiah, but they were too well acquainted with their sacred Scriptures to believe that the liberator of Israel should be descended from the bond-woman. A severe defeat at Ohod increased rather than abated the pride and fanaticism of Mohammed ; he ascribed it to the fault of his companions in having granted quarter to their enemies on a former occasion, and thenceforward the war assumed a most murderous and sanguinary character. The Meccans suffered much more severely than their adversaries; depending for their prosperity, and almost for their existence, on commerce, they saw their trade almost annihilated, their caravans plundered, and their flocks swept away. They made one great effort to remove their enemy, and besieged Mohammed in Medina, but were soon forced to retire with great loss. \" Hitherto they have sought us,\" exclaimed the prophet, \" it is now our turn to go in search of them.\" After this defeat, the Meccans seem to have lost all courage ; Mohammed rapidly became the most powerful prince in Arabia, his followers received his words as the inspired oracles of God, nor were they undeceived by the gross licentiousness in which the pretended prophet indulged. At length, he marched against Mecca, but found the defiles which lead to the city too strongly garrisoned to allow of an attack with any prospect of success. Under these circumstances, he concluded a truce, much ao-ainst the will of his followers, by which a peaceful admission into the city was secured to him in the ensuing year. Feeling that his power was now established, Mohammed sent ambassadors, inviting the most powerful kings of the earth, especially the emperors of Persia and Constantinople, to become his disciples. Khosru Parviz, who then ruled in Iran, was indignant at receiv-"], [61, "47 PREACHING OF MOHAMMED. ing a letter, in which \" a poor lizard-eater,\" as the Arab was then ca lied by his haughty neighbours, dared to place his name before that of \" the king of kings.\" He tore the paper to pieces, and dismissed the ambassador with insult ; when this was told to Mohammed, he exclaimed, \" Thus God hath torn his king dom.\" The Byzantine emperor, Heraclius, treated the message with respect, though he declined acceding to the invitation. During the year that preceded the pilgrimage to Mecca, Mo hammed subdued several of the surrounding tribes that had hitherto spurned his power ; but the seeds of mortal disease were sown in his constitution by a dose of poison, which a Jewess as a test of his prophetic pretensions. At length the day arrived which was to consummate the triumph of Islamism ; Mohammed made his public entry into Mecca with unparalleled magnificence ; he did homage to the national faith by worshipping in the Kaaba ; and such was the effect produced by his presence, that many of his former enemies, and among others, the chief guardian of the idolatrous sanc tuary, proclaimed themselves his disciples. Soon after this success he began his first foreign war. The ambassador he sent to the Byzantine governor of Bosrah, having been murdered at Muta, a little town south of the Dead Sea, an army was sent under the command of -Zeid, the freedman of the prophet, to avenge the insult. The Mussulman general, and the two officers that succeeded, were slain; but the command devolving upon Khaled, the son of Wab'd, he obtained a decisive victory, and returned to Medina laden with booty. This success induced Mohammed to break his truce with the Meccans ; disregarding their remonstrances and offers of submission, he marched against the city ; an entrance was forced by the fiery Khaled, and the prophet with difficulty prevented his followers from involving his fellow-citizens in one promiscuous massacre. The Kaaba became the property of the conqueror ; all traces of idolatry were removed from this national sanctuary; the only emblem of former superstition permitted to remain, was the celebrated Black Stone, an aerolite which the Arabs had venerated from an unknown age, the reverence for which was too deeply graven in their hearts to be easily eradicated. This success led to the"], [62, "48 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. subjugation of most of the northern Arabian tribes ; ambassadors flocked to congratulate the prophet from every side; the lieutenant of Khosru, at the western side of the Euphrates, became a Mussulman ; the governor of the provinces that the Najashi of Abyssinia held in Arabia, followed the example ; and Mohammed might be regarded as the undisputed sovereign of the peninsula. A second expedition against the southern provinces of the Byzantine, or, as it was still called, the Roman empire, was crowned with success ; and so rapid had been the progress of Islamism, that when the prophet performed his last pilgrimage to Mecca, his followers amounted to nearly one hundred thousand warriors, independent of women, slaves, and other attendants. On his return to Medina, the poison that Mohammed had taken from the Jewess began to show its effects. He was seized with mortal disease; and, at his own request, was removed to the house of his favourite wife Ayesha, on whose prudence he depended for concealing any incautious avowal he might make under the pressure of sickness. On the 8th of June, 632, he died, declaring with his last breath that he was about \" to take his place with his fellow-citizen on high,\" meaning the angel Gabriel. He made no will, he appointed no successor, owing to the contrivance of Ayesha, who feared that Ali, the cousin and son-in -law of the prophet, would be nominated the heir of his power. Section IV. \u2014 Early Progress of the Saracens. TnE fabric of Islamism was shaken to its very foundation after Mohammed's death, by the disputes that arose respecting the choice of a successor. Ali had the best hereditary claims, but his literary tastes, and ascetic manners, rendered him unpopular with the fierce soldiery ; and he had a powerful enemy in Ayesha, whom he had once charged with infidelity. After three days of fierce dispute, the controversy was decided by Omar's proffering the oath of fidelity to Abu Bekr, the father of Ayesha, and one of Mohammed's most faithful followers. Abu Bekr assumed the title of Khaliph, or vicar, which"], [63, "49 EARLY PROGRESS OF THE SARACENS. thenceforth became the designation of the Saracenic emperors. Having superintended the sepulture of his illustrious predecessor at Medina, the Khaliph sent an army against Mosseilama, an impostor, who, following the example of Mohammed, attempted to found a new religion. Mosseilama and his followers were exterminated by the gallant Khaled, surnamed from his fiery valour \" the sword of God,\" and Islamism was thenceforward established in Arabia. Perceiving that it was necessary to find employment for the energetic spirits by which he was surrounded, Abu Bekr pre pared to invade the Byzantine and Persian empires, both of which had fallen into a state of deplorable weakness. Osama, the son of Zeid, ravaged Syria, while the province of Irak, the ancient Babylonia, was subdued by Khaled. The conquest of Syria was a more important enterprise ; circulars announcing the undertaking, were sent to the principal Arabian tribes, and the army which assembled on the occasion was the most numerous that had yet been raised by the Saracens. The Emperor Hera clius, alarmed at the approach of such formidable forces, sent a large detachment to meet the enemy on the frontiers, which was defeated with great slaughter. But the imperialists were more successful at Gaza, where they gained a victory over a Moslem division, commanded by Abu Obeidah. The Khaliph invested Amrii with the supreme command of the expedition, but entrusted Obeidah's division to Khaled. The latter made him self master of the city of Bostra, and after gaining several other advantages over the Romans, laid siege to Damascus. Heraclius sent an army of 100,000 men to relieve the capital of Syria, but the imperialists were thrice routed ; and in the last of these battles more than half their number fell in the field. This calamity led to the fall of Damascas, one side of which was stormed by Khaled, just as the other capitulated to Abu Obeidah. A warm dispute arose between the generals as to the claims of the citizens to the benefit of the capitulation ; but mercy finally prevailed, and the lives of the Damascenes were spared. Abu Bekr died on the very day that Damascus was taken (a. d. 634) ; his memory was justly venerated, not only because he pointed the Saracens the way to conquest beyond D"], [64, "50 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. Arabia ; but because he gave their religion its permanent form, by collecting the scattered passages of the Koran, and arranging them in the order that they hold to the present day. Omar was chosen second Khaliph by the unanimous consent of the army. Soon after his accession he received the intelli- gence, of the capture of Damascus, but instead of evincing grati- tude, he yielded to the suggestions of petty jealousy, and transferred the command of the army from Khaled to Abu Obeidah. The conquest of Syria was followed by the subju- gation of Persia. Yezdijird, the last monarch of the Sassanid dynasty, sent a large army to recover Irak, under the command of Ferokshad, a general of high reputation. Saad-ebn-Wakass, the leader of the Saracens, relying upon the impetuous courage of his soldiers, eagerly sought a general action ; and Ferokshad, after many vain efforts to protract the war, was forced to a decisive engagement in the plains of Kadseah, or Kadesia. The battle lasted several days, and ended in the almost total annihi- lation of the Persian army, while the loss of the Arabs did not exceed three thousand men. The celebrated standard of Persia, originally the apron of the patriotic blacksmith Gavah, but which had been enlarged, by successive monarchs, to the lenoth of twenty-two feet and the breadth of fifteen, enriched with jewels of the highest value, fell into the hands of the conquerors, and was broken up for distribution. Nor was this the only rich booty obtained by the \" sons of the desert,\" who were yet igno rant of its value. \" I will give any quantity of this yellow metal for a little white,'' was an exclamation made, after the battle was over, by an Arabian soldier, who desired to exchange gold, which he had never before seen, for silver, which he had learned to appreciate (a. d. 638). Yezdijird assembled a new army in the northern and eastern provinces, while the Khaliph reinforced the invaders with fresh bodies of enthusiasts. The battle which decided the fate of Persia was fought at Nahavend (a. d. 641). Noman, the leader of the Saracens, attacked the Persians in their intrenchments ; nothing could resist the fury of the onslaught, it was a carnage rather than a battle. For ten years, Yezdijird, \" a hunted wanderer on the wild,\" protracted a faint but unyielding resis-"], [65, "EARLY\" PROGRESS OF THE SARACENS. 51 tance ; he was at length slain by a miller with whom he had sought refuge (a. d. 651). Thus ended the dynasty of Sassan, which ruled Persia for four hundred and fifty years, and the memory of which is still cherished by a nation, whose ancient glory is associated with the fame of Ardeshir, Shah-pur and Nushirvan. Nor were the Saracens less successful in Syria ; Abu Obeidah's caution tempered the fiery zeal of Khaled, and rendered victory more secure though less rapid. City after city was yielded to the Moslems, and the army which Heraclius sent to the defence of his unfortunate subjects was irretrievably ruined in the battle of Yermuk. Inspired by this victory, Abu Obeidah laid siege to Jerusalem, and in four months reduced the garrison to such distress, that a surrender was unavoidable. The Khaliph Omar came in person to receive the submission of the holy city. His equipage was a singular characteristic of the simplicity that still prevailed among the Saracens. He rode upon a red camel, with a sack of corn, and water-bag, slung from the saddle, to supply his wants during the journey. A wooden platter was the only utensil he brought with him ; his dress was of camel's hair, coarse and torn ; a single slave constituted his attendance and escort. In this guise he reached the Moslem camp, where he recited the public prayers, and preached a sermon to his troops. He then signed the capitulation, securing to the Christians of Jerusalem protection in person, property, and religious worship, on the payment of a moderate tribute, and entered the city in triumph (a. d. 637). In six years from their first appearance in Syria, the Saracens completed the conquest of that province, and of Palestine, and secured their acquisitions by occupying the mountain-fortresses on the borders of Cilicia. Egypt was next attacked by Amrii, and subdued without much difficulty. Alexandria alone made a vigorous defence ; but it was finally taken by storm, and its valuable library con signed to the flames, through the fanaticism of Omar, who was ignorant of literature and science. In the midst of these triumphs the Khaliph Omar was assassi nated by a slave (a. d. 643). During his reign of ten years and a half, the Saracens could boast that they had subdued Syria, d 2"], [66, "52 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. Chald\u00e6a, Persia, and Egypt ; taken thirty-six thousand cities, towns, and castles ; destroyed four thousand Christian churches, fire and idol temples, and built fourteen hundred mosques. Omar, by his will, appointed six commissioners to elect a new Khaliph, and their choice fell on Othman-ebn-Affan, whose pliancy of disposition appears to have been his chief recom- mendation. The change of their sovereign did not abate the rage for conquest among the Saracens. They ceased to limit their exertions to land ; a fleet fitted out by Moawiyah, the governor of Syria, subdued the island of Cyprus (a. d. 647), while the Syrian and Egyptian armies penetrated into Armenia and Nubia. The island of Rhodes was a still more important acquisition : it yielded to Moawiyah almost without a struggle ; its celebrated Colossus was broken to pieces and sold to a Jew, who loaded nine bundled camels with the metal that it con- tained. Othman's weakness soon rendered him odious to his warlike subjects. The Egyptian army revolted, and marched to besiege him in Medina ; their discontents were appeased for a time by the exertions of Ali, but the insurgents having reason to suspect that the Khaliph meditated vengeance, retraced then steps, and murdered him in his palace (a. d. 656). The Koran, stained with the blood of Othman, is said to be still preserved at Damascus. Immediately after the murder of Othman, Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet, was proclaimed Khaliph. His accession was the signal for disorders, which threatened the speedy ruin of the Saracenic empire. His old enemy Ayesha excited a revolt in Arabia, affecting to avenge the murder of Othman, though she had more than consented to his death ; Moawiyah headed a revolt in Syria ; and the turbulent army of Egypt set their sovereign's authority at defiance. The first combat was against the partisans of Ayesha, who were routed with great slaughter, and she herself made prisoner. Ali not only spared the life of this turbulent woman, but assio-ned her a large pension. Moawiyah was a far more dangerous enemy. By his affected zeal for religion, he had won the friendship of many of the com panions of the prophet, while his descent from the ancient chiefs"], [67, "EARLY PROGRESS OF THE SARACENS. 53 of Mecca, procured the support of many who had yielded reluc tantly to the sway of Mohammed. The rival armies met in the plains of Saffein, on the western bank of the Euphrates, and more than ninety days were spent in indecisive skirmishes. At length Moawiyah, finding his forces rapidly diminishing, adopted the following singular expedient, on the recommendation of Amru ; he ordered a copy of the Koran to be fixed on the top of a pike, and directed a herald to proclaim, in the presence of both armies, that he was willing to decide all differences by this sacred code. Ali's soldiers forced him to consent to a truce ; two commissioners were chosen to regulate the articles of peace ; and Amrii, who appeared on the part of Moawiyah, contrived to have his friend proclaimed Khaliph. The war was renewed, but no decisive battle was fought. At length some enthusiasts resolved to destroy Moawiyah, Amru, and Ali. The two former escaped, Ali became a victim (a. d. 661), and Moawiyah, with out much resistance, became chief of the Saracenic empire, and founded the Ommiade dynasty of Khaliphs. During these commotions the career of Saracenic conquest had been suspended ; but, under the Ommiade dynasty, the military spirit of the Arabs was restored to its former strength. Egypt furnished an excellent key to southern Europe and western Africa. Thrice the Saracens were compelled to abandon their enterprise against the countries west of Egypt ; but at length their perseverance was crowned with success, and the creed of Mohammed was extended through northern Africa to the shores, of the Atlantic. Count Julian, a Gothic noble, irritated by the treatment he had received from his sovereign, Roderic, invited the Saracens into Spain, A. D. 710. A numerous army of adventurers crossed the straits, and, aided by the resentment of the persecuted Jews, subdued the entire peninsula, with the exception of a small district in the Asturian mountains. Not content with this success, the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees, and advanced through France to the Loire ; they even meditated a plan of conquest, which would have subjected all Christendom to their yoke; they proposed to conquer France, Italy, and Germany, and then descending the Danube to exterminate the Greek empire, whose"], [68, "54 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SARACENIC POWER. capital they had already twice assailed. The valour of Charles Martel, who completely defeated the Saracens in a memorable battle, that lasted seven days (a. d. 732), rescued Europe from the Mohammedan yoke. His grandson, Charlemagne, drove the Saracens back to the Ebro ; and though they subsequently recovered their Spanish provinces, they were forced to respect the Pyrenees as the bulwark of Christendom. The revolution which transferred the Khaliphate from the descendants of Moawiyah to the posterity of Abbas, the uncle of Mohammed, led to the dismemberment of the empire. The Ommiade dynasty was continued in Spain, and this example was followed by the Edrissites of Mauritania, and the Fatimites and Aglabites of eastern Africa. Bagdad, founded by Al Mansur, became the capital of the Abasside dynasty. The Khaliphs of this line were generous patrons of science, literature, and the arts, especially Harun-al-Rashid, the hero of the Arabian Nights, and his son Al Mamiin. The love of learning spread from Bagdad into the other Saracenic countries ; the Ommiade Khaliphs founded several universities in Spain, the Fatimites established schools in Egypt, and the Mohammedan nations were distinguished for their attainments in physical science, while Europe remained sunk in barbarism. The Sara cenic empire gradually passed from splendour into weakness ; the Turkish mercenaries employed by the later Khaliphs became the of their sovereign; and the dignity, after being long an empty title, was finally abolished a. d. 1258."], [69, ".>.) CHAPTER III. RESTORATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. Section I. \u2014 The Life of Charlemagne. When the last of the feeble descendants of Clovis was dethroned by Pepin, France, by being brought into close connexion with the see of Rome, became the most prominent state in Europe, and the foundation was laid for the system of policy which has since prevailed in Europe, by the union of the highest ecclesiastical au thority with the most extensive civil power. Many circumstances had previously conspired to give the Popes, as the bishops of Rome were called from an unknown period, great and commanding authority over the Christian nations of the West. Among the most influential, was the extravagant claim to the ancient sway of the C\u00e6sars, gravely urged by the Byzantine emperors, when they had neither means nor ability to support their pretensions. Wearied by the pride and cruelty of the Greeks, the Italians supported the papal power as a counterpoise to the imperial, and were eager to have the bishop of Rome recognised as head of the Christian church, to prevent the title from being usurped by the patriarch of Constantinople. The recognition of Pepin's elevation to the throne of France was something more than a mere form ; it was a ratification of his claims by the only au thority that was respected by the nations of western Europe. In return, Pepin gave military aid to the popes, in their wars with the Lombards, and openly proclaimed himself the cham pion of the church. The French king entrusted the command of the armies he employed in Italy to his youthful son Karl, better known by his French name, Charlemagne. The prince, thus early brought into public life, displayed more than ordinary abilities, both as a general and a statesman ; he acted a dis tinguished part in the subjugation of Aquitaine, and deservedly"], [70, "restoration of the western empire. 56 obtained the fame of adding that fine province to the dominions of the Franks. Pepin did not long survive this acquisition; pursuing the pernicious policy which had already proved so destructive to the preceding dynasty, he divided his dominions between his sons Charles and Carloman. Their mutual jealousies would have exploded in civil war, but for the judicious interference of their mother Bertha. At length Carloman died suddenly ; his wife and children fled to the Lombards, his subjects, with one accord, resolved to have Charlemagne for their sovereign, and thus the French monarchy was again reunited under a single head. The protection granted to the family of Carloman was not the only ground of hostility between Charlemagne and the Lombard king Desiderius ; Charlemagne had married, and afterwards repudi ated, that monarch's daughter; Desiderius menaced war, but had not the means' of executing his threats ; Charlemagne was prevented from crossing the Alps, by the appearance of a more formidable enemy on his eastern frontiers. The Saxons, and other Germanic tribes, were still sunk in idolatry; they frequently devastated the frontier provinces of the Christian Franks, and showed particular animosity to the churches and ministers of religion. To chastise their aggressions, and restrain their future incursions, Charlemagne cros;ed the Rhine, captured their principal fortresses, destroyed their na tional idol, and compelled them to give hostages for their future good conduct. He had scarcely returned home, when he was summoned into Italy, to rescue the pope from the wrath of Desiderius, who, enraged at the pontiff's refusal to recognise the claims of the sons of Carloman, had actually laid siege to Rome. Like Hannibal in ancient, and Napoleon in modern times, Charlemagne forced a passage over the Alps, and was actually descending from the mountains before the Lombards knew of his having commenced his march. Desiderius, after vainly attempting to check the Franks in the defiles, abandoned the field, and shut himself up in Pavia. The city was taken after a year's siege : during the interval, Charlemagne visited Rome, and was received with great enthusiasm by the pope and the citizens. Soon after his return to his camp Pavia surrendered,"], [71, "57 LIFE OF CHARLEMAGNE. Desiderius and his queen were confined in separate monasteries, and the iron crown, usually worn by the kings of Lombardy, was placed upon the head of the French monarch. The Saxons and Lombards made several vigorous efforts to shake off the yoke, but their insurrections were easily sup pressed ; while, however, alarming discontents prevailed in both nations, Charlemagne was involved in a new and perilous war. A Saracenic prince sought refuge in the French court, and per suaded the monarch to lead an army over the Pyrenees. The frontier provinces were easily subdued, owing to the disputes that divided the Mohammedans in Spain. Charlemagne gained a decisive victory over the Saracens at Saragossa, but before he could complete his conquest, he was recalled home by a new and more dangerous revolt of the Saxons. The rear-guard of the French, commanded by the gallant Roland, was treacherously assailed on its return, by the Gascons, in the defiles of Ronces valles, and almost wholly destroyed, an incident that has given rise to countless romantic fictions*. The devastations of the Saxons, which recalled Charlemagne from Spain, exceeded anything which Europe had witnessed since the days of Attila. Witikind, prince of Westphalia, was the leader of this dangerous revolt ; he had united his countrymen * Mrs. Hemans describes this fatal fight in one of her chivalrous ballads,. from which we may venture to quote a couple of stanzas. In the gloomy Roncesvalles strait, There are helms and lances cleft ; And they that moved at morn elate On a bed of heath are left ! There's many a fair young face Which the war steed hath gone o'er ; At many a board there is kept a place For those that come no more. There is dust upon the joyous brow, And o'er the graceful head ; And the war-horse will not wake him now, Though it bruise his green-sward bed ! j I have seen the stripling die, And the strong man meet his fate, Where the mountain winds go sounding by, In the Roncesvalles' strait. D 3"], [72, "58 RESTORATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. into one great national confederacy, and long maintained a desperate struggle against the whole strength of the French monarchy. He was at length irretrievably routed, and submitting to the conqueror, became a Christian. Several minor revolts in his extensive dominions, troubled the reign of Charlemagne, but he quelled them all, and secured the tranquillity of Germany, both by subduing the Saxons, and destroying the last remnant of the barbarous Avars who had settled in Hungary. The brief intervals of tranquillity were spent by this wise monarch in extending the blessings of civilization to his subjects, by esta blishing schools, and patronising science and literature. In these labours he was assisted by Alcuin, an English monk, the most accomplished scholar of his age. Such was the fame of the French monarchy at this time, that embassies came to the court from the most distant cotemporary sovereigns. The most remarkable was that sent from the renowned Harun-al-Rashid, khaliph of Bagdad ; among the presents they brought were some beautiful pieces of clock-work, which were regarded as something almost miraculous in western Europe, where the mechanical arts were still in their infancy. But in the midst of these glories, Charlemagne was alarmed by the appearance of a new enemy on the coasts of France, whose incursions, though repelled, filled the monarch's prescient mind with sad bodings of future danger. These were the Northmen, or Normans, pirates, from the distant shores of Scandinavia, whose thirst of plunder was stimulated by the desire of revenging the wrongs that their idolatrous brethren, the Saxons, had endured. At their first landing in France, they had scarcely time to commit any ravages, for they fled on the news of the dreaded king's approach. Charlemagne saw their departing ships without exultation, he burst into tears *, and * The monk of St. Gall tells us, that when Charlemagne was asked the cause of these tears, he replied, \" My faithful friends, do you inquire why I weep thus bitterly ? Assuredly it is not that I dread any annoyance to myself from the piracy of those wretches ; but I am deeply affected to find that they have dared to visit these coasts even in my life-tune ; and violent grief overwhelms me, when I look forward to the evils they will inflict on my subjects.\""], [73, "59 LIFE OF CHARLEMAGNE. predicted that these \" sea-kings * would soon prove a dreadful scourge to southern Europe. Soon after the retreat of the Normans, Charlemagne was induced to visit Italy, both to quell the rebellion of the duke of Beneventum, and to rescue Pope Leo from his insurgent sub jects. He succeeded in both enterprises, and the grateful pontiff solemnly crowned his benefactor Emperor of the West. A project was soon after formed for re-establishing the ancient Roman Empire, by uniting Charlemagne to the Byzantine empress, Irene, but this was prevented by the factions of Con stantinople ; the degraded Greeks dreaded nothing so much as the vig-orous administration of such a sovereign as the restorer of the Western Empire. Charlemagne intended to divide his dominions equally be tween his three sons ; but two of them died while the arrange ments were in progress, and Louis, the weakest in mind and body, became sole heir to the empire. His claims were solemnly recognised in a national assembly of the Frank nobility, at Aix la-Chapelle ; soon after which, the emperor died, in the seventy second year of his age, universally lamented throughout his extensive dominions. Section II. \u2014 Decline and Fall of the Carlovingian Dynasty. The Western Empire, established by Charlemagne, extended from the Ebro in the west to the Elbe and Raab in the east, and from the duchy of Beneventum and the Adriatic sea to the river Eyder, which separated the Germanic tribes from the Scan dinavian hordes, or, as they began about this time to be called, the Danes and Normans. It consequently included all ancient Gaul, a great portion of Spain and Italy, several islands in the Mediterranean, especially Corsica, Sardinia, and the Baleares, western and northern Germany, with a considerable part of Pannonia, or Hungary. No other European power could com pete with that of the Franks; the monarchies of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and Russia, were not yet founded ;"], [74, "60 RESTORATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. England was still divided by the Heptarchy; the Saracenic empire in Spain was distracted by civil commotions, and the Christian kingdom of the Asturias was barely struggling into existence ; finally, the Byzantine empire was sunk into hopeless lethargy, and owed its continued existence only to the decay of the spirit of enterprise among the Arabs, after the seat of the Khaliphate was removed to Bagdad. But the continuation of an empire including so many nations essentially different in interests, habits, and feelings, required a superior genius in the sovereign. Louis the Debonnaire, the son and successor of Charlemagne, was deficient in every quality that a ruler should possess ; foolish, weak, and superstitious, he could not make himself beloved, and he failed to inspire fear. The seeds of discord were thickly sown during his life, they were forced into maturity after his death by his unwise distribution of his domi nions between his three sons. Scarcely had Louis been laid in the grave, when his sons Louis the Germanic and Charles the Bald took up arms against their elder brother Lothaire, and engaged him in a general battle at Fontenay, which proved fatal to the flower of the ancient Frank nobility (a. d. 841). After a desultory war, the brothers finally agreed on a partition of the empire, by which Lothaire obtained Italy and the eastern provinces of France ; Louis received his father's Germanic dominions ; and to Charles were assigned the provinces of France west of the Saone and the Rhone, together with the Spanish marches (a. d. 843). Lothaire preserved the empty title of emperor, but his brothers were really independent sovereigns, and must be regarded as the founders of the modern kingdoms of France and Germany. It is unnecessary to detail the petty revolutions in the family of Charlemagne ; it is sufficient to say, that the empire was mo mentarily reunited under Charles the Fat, younger son of Louis the Germanic (a. d. 884), but he being deposed by his subjects, its dissolution became inevitable ; from its fragments were formed the kingdoms of Italy, France, and Germany, with the states of Lorraine, Burgundy, and Navarre. These new states owed their origin less to the disputes that convulsed the Carlovingian family than to the exorbitant power"], [75, "61 DECLINE OF THE CARLOVINGIAN DYNASTY. of the nobles, which had been increasing rapidly from the death of Charlemagne. The titles of duke and count were not in that age merely honorary ; they conferred nearly despotic sway over the provinces. The great feudatories of the crown were invested not merely with the administration of justice and regulation of police in their respective districts, but had also the command of the army and the direction of the revenue. It is easy to see that the union of such different and important departments of government in a single person must necessarily have been dan gerous to royal authority, and constantly tempted ambitious nobles to proclaim their independence. Charlemagne saw this evil, and endeavoured to abate the danger by dividing the great duchies into several counties ; but in the civil wars among his posterity, rival competitors, to secure the support of powerful feudatories, offered the restored duchies as tempting bribes, and further weakened themselves by alienating the royal domains to secure the favour of the church. Taking advantage of this impolicy, the dukes and counts contrived to make their dignities hereditary; and this dangerous innovation was not only sanc tioned by Charles the Bald, but extended to all fiefs (a. d. 877), in a parliament held at Chiersi, towards the close of his reign. The principle of inheritance, thus introduced, may be regarded as the foundation of the feudal system, and the source of the calamitous wars between rival nobles which convulsed all central and south-western Europe. While France and Germany were thus devastated by intestine commotions, the Norman pirates ravaged the sea-coasts of western Europe, and extended their ravages into the Mediterranean. France suffered most severely from their hostilities ; their light barks ascended the Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, and the Rhone, carrying fire and sword into the very centre of the kingdom. Most of the principal cities were laid waste ; Paris itself was thrice taken and pillaged ; and the French, at length losing all courage, refused to meet the northern warriors in the field, but purchased their retreat with large bribes. This remedy was necessarily as inefficacious as it was disgraceful, for it stimulated the barbarians to fresh incursions in the assured hope of gain. Nor were the Normans regardless of permanent"], [76, "62 RESTORATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. conquests ; Ruric, a leader of their adventurous bands, founded the Russian monarchy towards the close of the ninth century; Iceland was colonized, and the greater part of Ireland subdued, at a still earlier period ; and the northern and western islands of Scotland were successively occupied as convenient stations for their piratical navies. Finally, they obtained fixed esta blishments in France ; the provinces of Neustria, now called Normandy, was ceded to Rolf or Rollo, the chief of a large horde of these northern pirates, by Charles the Simple (a. d. 912) ; the province gained great advantages by the exchange, for Rollo becoming a Christian, was baptized by the name of Robert, and applied himself with equal diligence and success to improve the condition of his new subjects. While the Normans devastated the coasts, central Europe was devastated by the Hungarians, or, as they called them selves, the Magyars, who extended their ravages into Greece and Italy. Germany suffered most from their hostilities, and was the longest exposed to their fury. These incursions, to which must be added occasional enterprises of the Sclavonians and Saracens, destroyed the political institutions that Charle magne had formed, and threw Christendom back into the bar barism from which it had just begun to emerge. England, under the government of Alfred, for a brief space, preserved the elements of civilization ; he expelled the Normans from the island (a. d. 887), restored the ancient seminaries of learning, and founded new schools. But his glorious reign was followed by fresh calamities ; the Danish-Normans reappeared in Eng land, and spread trouble and desolation throughout the country. From the reign of Charles the Bald, the royal authority rapidly declined in France, while the power of the feudal lords constantly increased. The dukes and counts, usurping regal rights, raised, on the slightest, or without any provocation, the standard of revolt : the kings, to gain some, and secure the allegiance of others, abandoned to them successively the most valuable royal domains and privileges, until the Carlovingian monarchs, so far from being able to counterbalance the power of the nobility, were unable to support the expenses of their own courts. A change of dpiasty was thus rendered inevitable,"], [77, "63 DECLINE OF THE CARLOVINGIAN DYNASTY. and the throne was certain to fall to the lot of the most powerful or most daring of the nominal vassals. This event, which had been long foreseen, took place on the death of Louis the Slug gard, the last of the Carlovingian dynasty, who died without issue at the early age of twenty (a. d. 987). Hugh Capet pos sessed already the centre of the kingdom ; he was count of Paris, duke of France and Neustria, while his brother Henry held the duchy of Burgundy. It was not difficult for so powerful a noble to form a party, by whose favour he was invested with the title, after having long enjoyed the power of royalty (a. d. 987). Charles of Lorraine, the late king's uncle, took up arms in defence of his hereditary rights ; but he was betrayed to his rival by the bishop of Laofi, and ended his days in prison. Hugh became the founder of the Capetian dynasty in France, a branch of which still retains possession of that crown. Section III. \u2014 The Foundation of the Germanic Empire. From the first foundation of the Germanic empire by the treaty of Verdun, the royal authority was extremely limited, and Louis, its monarch, was obliged to swear in a national assembly, held at Marone (a. d. 851), that \" he would maintain the states in all their rights and privileges.\" His youngest son, Charles the Fat, was deposed by his subjects; and Arnold, the natural son of prince Carloman, was elected to the vacant throne. The custom of electing emperors was thus established in Germany, and it continued almost to our own times. Arnold was suc ceeded by his son Louis ; the states chose Conrad, duke of Franconia, as his successor, to the exclusion of Charles the Simple, king of France, the legitimate heir male of the Carlo vingians. On the death of Conrad, the states elected Henry, surnamed the Fowler, as his successor (a. d. 919), the first of the Saxon dynasty of kings and emperors. Henry I., by his civil and military institution, raised Ger many to the highest rank among the states of Europe. Profiting by the intestine commotions of France, he conquered the pro-"], [78, "64 RESTORATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. vince of Lorraine, which he divided into two duchies, that of Upper Lorraine, or the Moselle, and that of Lower Lorraine, or Brabant. The former retained the name of Lorraine ; it was long governed by the family of Gerard, duke of Alsace, whose descendants obtained the Germanic empire in the eighteenth century. Brabant was assigned to Godfrey, count of Louvain, whose descendants retained it, with the title of duke, until, on the failure of male heirs, it passed by marriage into the hands of the dukes of Burgundy, who thus found means to render themselves masters of a great portion of the Netherlands. Henry successfully repelled the invasions of the Sclavonians and Hun garians ; by the defeat of the latter he freed the Germans from the disgraceful tribute with which they had been compelled to purchase the forbearance of these barbarians, and the memory of his victory was annually commemorated by a grateful people for several succeeding centuries. The great merits of Henry secured the election of his son Otho to the Germanic throne. His reign was disturbed by frequent revolts of the powerful feudatories ; their faction and insubordination effectually prevented him from givino- his subjects a code of laws, the great object of his ambition ; he was forced to yield to the turbulent spirit of the times, and leave some more fortunate sovereign to gather the laurels of a legislator. One incident will serve to mark the character of the age better than any laboured dissertation. Durino- one of the national assemblies or diets, it was debated \" whether children could inherit the property of their fathers during the lifetime of their grandfathers.\" After a long discussion, in which the point became more obscure than ever, it was gravely resolved to leave the matter to the decision of a duel. An equal number of combatants, chosen on both sides, entered the lists, the champions of the children prevailed, and from thence forward the law of inheritance was considered to be fixed. Italy had been raised into a kingdom after the partition of the Carlovingian dynasty, and several of its princes had taken the imperial title; but the government of these feeble rulers exposed the peninsula to dreadful calamities; it was harassed by the private wars of the nobles, and devastated by invasions of"], [79, "65 FOUNDATION OF THE GERMANIC EMPIRE. the Hungarians and Saracens. Adelaide, the widow of Lothaire, king of Italy, menaced with the loss of her dominions by Berenger, or Berengarius the Younger, supplicated the aid of Otho, and her request was strenuously supported by Pope John XII. (a.d. 951). Otho passed into Italy, conquered several of the strongest cities, and gave his hand in marriage to the queen whom he had come to protect. Berenger was per mitted to retain the crown of Italy on condition of doing homage to Otho ; but the -tyranny and faithlessness of this prince excited such commotions, that the German sovereign was once more summoned to cross the Alps by the united entreaties of the Italian princes and prelates. Otho entered Italy at the head of an army which his rival could not resist ; he marched directly to Rome, where he was received with the greatest enthusiasm (a. d. 962). The pope revived in his favour the imperial title, which had been thirty-eight years in abeyance, proclaimed him Augustus, crowned him emperor of the Romans, and acknow ledged him Supreme Head of the Church. But the pontiff's gratitude was not of long duration ; enraged by the emperor's remonstrances against his vicious courses, he took advantage of Otho's absence in pursuit of Berenger, to enter into alliance with Adelbert, the son of his ancient enemy, and to form a secret league for the expulsion of the Germans from Italy. Otho heard the intelligence of John's treachery with great indignation ; he returned to Rome, held a council, in which the pope was accused of the most scandalous immoralities, and on his refusal to appear, condemned as contumacious, deposed, and a new pontiff, Leo VIIL, elected in his stead. All Italy, as far as the ancient kingdom of the Lombards extended, thus fell under the sway of the Germans; there were only some maritime places in Lower Italy which, with Apulia and Calabria, still remained subject to the Greeks. Otho transmitted this kingdom, with the imperial dignity, to his successors on the German throne ; but from his reign to that of Maximilian I., no prince took the title of emperor until he had been consecrated by the pope. Maximilian designated himself \" Emperor Elect,\" (a.d. 1508,) and his example was followed by his successors down to our times."], [80, "66 RESTORATION OF TnE WESTERN EMPIRE. Otho I. died after a prosperous reign (a. d. 975), and was succeeded by his son Otho II. His reign was occupied in sanguinary wars which harassed Germany and Italy. Otho having married the Greek princess Theophano, claimed the pro vinces of Apulia and Calabria as her dowry. After a tedious struggle, the emperor was mortally wounded by a poisoned javelin in a battle with the Greeks (a. d. 983). His death is said to have been accelerated by indignation at the joy which Theophano showed for the victory of her countrymen, though it was obtained over her own husband. Otho III., when elected successor to his father, was only twelve years of age ; ambitious rivals prepared to dispute his title, but the affection of the Germans for his family enabled him to triumph over all opposition. His authority was more fiercely questioned in Italy, where Crescentius, an ambitious noble, became such a favourite with the Roman populace, that he deposed Pope Gregory, and gave the pontifical dignity to John XVI. Otho hastened into Italy, captured Rome, and put both Crescentius and John to death. These severities did not quell the turbulence of the Italians ; fresh insurrections soon compelled the emperor to return to the peninsula, where he was poisoned by the widow of Crescentius, whom he had seduced under a promise of marriage (a. d. 1002). He died without issue. After some competition, the electors chose Henry, duke of Bavaria, descended from the Othos in the female line, emperor of the West. His reign was disturbed by repeated insurrections, both in Germany and Italy; he succeeded in quelling them, but was so wearied by these repeated troubles, that he seriously designed to abdicate and retire into a monastery. The clergy took advantage of his piety and liberality, to extort from him several rich donations, which proved, in an after age, the cause of much evil. His death (a. d. 1024) put an end to the Saxon dynasty. Conrad II. , duke of Franconia, being chosen by the electors, united the kingdom of Burgundy, or, as it was called, Aries, to the empire. But this was an acquisition of little real value ; the great vassals of the kingdom, the counts and the bishops,"], [81, "FOUNDATION OF THE GERMANIC EMPIRE. 67 preserved the authority they had usurped in their respective districts, leaving to the emperors a merely nominal sovereignty. It is even probable that the high authority possessed by the Burgundian lords, induced the German nobles to arrogate to themselves the same prerogatives. The power of the clergy was increasing even more rapidly than that of the nobles, for they extorted fresh privileges and grants from every successive sove reign ; Conrad, who was naturally of a generous disposition*, impoverished the state by imitating the unwise liberality of his predecessors. Italy, during this reign and that of Conrad's son and successor, Henry IIL, continued to be distracted by rival factions, but Henry was an energetic supporter of the imperial authority ; he deposed three rival popes, who claimed succession to St. Peter at the same time, and gave the pontifical chair to a German prelate, Clement II. He even exacted an oath from the Romans, that they would never elect a pope without having previously received the imperial sanction. The imperial power, wielded by an energetic monarch like Henry, was still formi dable, but its resources were exhausted ; and when a feebler sovereign attempted to exercise the sway over the church which his father had held, he found the papacy stronger than the empire. The great struggle between the papal and imperial power began in the reign of Henry IV., whose long minority, for he succeeded his father when only five years old, necessarily weakened the influence of the sovereign. On the other hand, the circumstances of Europe, at this crisis, were peculiarly favourable to the policy of the popes. The Saxon line, restored in England by Edward the Confessor, had lost its nationality : Edward conferred the chief ecclesiastical dignities of his kingdom on foreigners, or persons remarkable for their foreign attach ments ; and thus those who wielded the power of the church in the island, were more like missionaries, labouring for the benefit of a distant see, than clergymen, attentive only to their flocks. * Many remarkable anecdotes are related of Conrad's generosity ; one deserves to be recorded. A gentleman having lost his leg in the imperial service, Conrad ordered that his boot should be filled with gold coins, to defray the expenses of his cure."], [82, "68 RESTORATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. In Spain, the new provinces wrested from the Moors, when the unity of their empire was destroyed by the subversion of the Ommiade Khaliphs, became closely attached to the Romish see. The spread of Christianity in Norway, Poland, Russia, and the other northern states, gave additional vigour to the papal power ; for the northerns, with all the zeal of new converts, became eager to prove their sincerity by some enterprise in support of the pontiff, whom they regarded as the great director of their faith. But the most potent allies obtained by the church were the Normans of England and Italy. William, the natural son of Robert, duke of Normandy, had been nominated heir of the English throne by Edward the Confessor, who had no right to make any such appointment. Harold, a popular Saxon noble, was raised to the crown by the people, and William was forced to establish his claim by open war. The pope warmly sup ported the Norman cause, on the pretext that Harold had sworn allegiance to William, and that his perjury exposed him to the censure of the church ; but really because he was anxious to confirm the power that the papal emissaries had acquired in England. At the battle of Hastings (a. d. 1066), Harold was defeated and slain ; William took possession of the kingdom, into which he introduced inheritance of fiefs, and the severities of the Norman feudal law. He deprived the English natives of their estates, whieh he shared among his own followers, and treated his new subjects with great severity. About the same time, some Norman adventurers laid the foundation of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, in southern Europe. The provinces that compose it were shared among the Lombard feudatories of the empire, the Greeks, and the Sara cens, who harassed each other with mutual wars. About a hundred Normans landing on the coast (a.d. 1016), offered their services to the Lombard princes, and displayed so much valour, that they obtained from the duke of Naples a grant of territory, where they built the city of Aversa. Encourao-ed by their success, Tancred, with another body of Norman adven turers, undertook the conquest of Apulia, which was completed by his son, Robert Guiscard. This warrior subdued Calabria"], [83, "69 FOUNDATION OF THE GERMANIC EMPIRE. also, and took the title of duke of both provinces. To secure his possessions, he entered into alliance with the pope, securing to the pontiff homage, and an annual tribute, on condition of receivino- investiture. Nicholas II. , who then filled the chair of St. Peter, willingly ratified a treaty by which the papacy gained important advantages, at the price of an empty title ; he stimu lated Guiscard to undertake the conquest of Sicily also, an en terprise in which that adventurer completely succeeded. Thus, at the moment that the papacy was about to struggle.for power with the empire, the former had been strengthened by the ac cession of powerful allies and vassals, while the latter had given away the greater part of its strength by the alienation of its domains, to gratify the church, or to win the favour of feu datories whose influence was already formidable. Section IV. \u2014 State of the East from the Establishment to the Overthrow of the Khaliphate. The history of the Byzantine empire, in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, is little better than a tissue of usurpation, fanaticism, and perfidy. \" Externally surrounded by foes, supe rior in numbers, in discipline, and in valour, it seemed as if its safety was guaranteed by cowardice, and its security confirmed by defeat. Internally were at work all the causes that usually effect the destruction of states : \u2014 dishonour and profligacy tri umphant in the palace ; \u2014 ferocious bigotry, based at once on enthusiasm and hypocrisy, ruling the church ; \u2014 civil dissensions, equally senseless and bloody, distracting the state ; \u2014 complete demoralization pervading every rank, from the court to the cot tage ;\u2014 so that its existence seemed owing to the antagonising effect of the causes that singly produce the ruin of empires.\" In the tenth century these causes seemed to have reached their consummation ; emperor after emperor perished by poison, or the dagger of the assassin ; parricide and fratricide were crimes of such ordinary occurrence, that they ceased to excite feelings"], [84, "RESTORATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. 70 of horror or disgust. Theological disputes, about questions that pass the limits of human knowledge, and a jealous rivalry between the patriarch of Constantinople and the pope of Rome, produced a division between the Eastern and Western churches, which the disputes respecting the Bulgarians aggravated into a formal schism. These barbarians were converted to Christianity by Greek and Latin missionaries ; the patriarch and the pope contended for the patronage of the new ecclesiastical establish ments; the Greeks prevailed in the contest, and forthwith banished their Latin adversaries, while the court of Rome took revenge by describing the Greeks as worse than the worst of the heathen. A brief display of vigour by Nicephorus, Phocas, and John Zimisces, arrested the progress of the Saracens, who were forming permanent establishments within sight of Constanti nople. But Zimisces was poisoned at the very moment when his piety, courage, and moderation had averted impending ruin, and promised to restore some portion of the empire's former stren\u00b0th and former glory. His feeble successors swayed the sceptre with unsteady hands, at a time when the empire was attacked by the fiercest enemies it had yet encountered, the Normans in Sicily, and the Seljukian Turks in Asia Minor. The names Turk and Tartar are loosely given to the inhabi tants of those regions which ancient authors included under the designation of Scythia. Their uncivilized tribes possessed the countries north of the Caucasus and east of the Caspian, from the river Oxus to the wall of China : hordes issuing from these wide plains had frequently devastated the empire of Persia, and more than once placed a new race of sovereigns on the throne. It was not, however, until the eighth century, that they were themselves invaded in turn; the Saracens, in the first burst of their enthusiasm, passed the Oxus, subdued Kharasm and Trans oxiana, and imposed the religion and law of Mohammed on a race of warriors more fiery and zealous than themselves. Soon after the establishment of the Khaliphate at Bagdad, the Sara cenic empire began to be diamembered, as we have already stated, and the khaliphs, alarmed by the revolt of their armies, and surrounded only by subjects devoted to the art of peace, began to entrust the guard of their persons and their capital to"], [85, "71 OVERTHROW OF THE KHALIPIIATE. foreign mercenaries. Al Moutasscm was the first who levied a Turkish army to protect his states (a. d. 833); and even during his reign, much inconvenience was felt from the pride and inso lence of soldiers unconnected with the soil they were employed to defend. The evil went on daily increasing, until the emirs, or Turkish commanders, usurped all the real authority of the state, leaving to the khaliphs the outward show and gewgaws of sovereignty, with empty titles, whose pomp was increased as the authority they pretended to represent was diminished. The revolution was completed in the reign of Al Khadi (a. d. 936) ; hoping to arrest the progress of the revolution, he created a new minister, called the Emir-al-Omra*, to whom far greater powers were given than had been entrusted to the ancient viziers. This, as might have been expected, aggravated the evil it was designed to prevent. The family of the Bowides, so called from their ancestor Buyah, usurped this high office, and the sovereignty of Bagdad ; the khaliph was deprived of all temporal authority, and was regarded simply as the chief Iman, or pontiff of the Mohammedan faith. Such was the state of the khaliphate, when a new horde from the interior of Turkestan appeared to change the entire face of Asia. This horde, deriving its name from Seljiik, one of its most renowned chiefs, was invited to cross the Oxus by the Ghazuevid t sultans %, who had already established a powerful \" Lord of the lords,\" or \" Commander of the commanders.\" + The Ghaznevid dynasty was founded by Sebektagen, who is said to have been originally a slave (a. d. 977). But his fame is eclipsed by that of his son Mahmiid, whose conquests in nothern India rival those of a hero of romance. His desire of conquest was rendered more terrible to those he attacked by his cruel bigotry, for in every country that he subdued, the horrors of war were increased by those of religious persecution. At his death, the empire of Ghizni included a great part of Persia, Afghanistan, and northern India, to the provinces of Bengal and the Deccan. But the rise of this great dynasty was not more rapid than its downfal, which we may date from the death of that monarch, to whom it owes all its lustre in the page of history (a. d. 1028). Little more than a century after Ma hommed's death, the last of the Ghaznevids was deposed by Mohammed Gouri, the founder of a new dynasty, equally transitory as that which it displaced. X The title of Sultan, which signifies a sovereign in the Chaldaic and Arabic languages, was first assumed by the Ghaznevid princes."], [86, "72 RESTORATION OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE. kingdom in the east of Persia, and subdued the north of Hin dostan. The Seljukians finding the pasturages of Khorassan far superior to those of their native country, invited new colonies to the fertile land ; they soon became so powerful that Togrul Beg proclaimed himself a sultan, and seized several of the best pro vinces belonging to the khaliphate. Finally, having taken Bagdad, he became master of the Khaliph's person (a. d. 1055), and succeeded to the power which had formerly been possessed by the Bowides. Togrul transmitted his authority to his nephew and heir, the formidable Alp Arslan*. This prince renewed the war against the Greek empire, obtained a signal victory over its forces in Armenia, and took the emperor, Romanus Diogenes, prisoner (a. d. 1070). The distractions produced by this event in the Byzantine dominions, enabled the Turks not only to expel the Greeks from Syria, but also to seize some of the finest provinces in Asia Minor. Under Malek Shah, the son and successor of Alp Arslan, the Seljukian monarchy touched the summit of its greatness. This wise prince extended his dominions from the Mediterranean to the walls of China. Guided by the wise counsels of his vizier Nezam-al-Mulk, the sultan ruled this mighty empire with great justice and moderation. Asia enjoyed tranquillity, to which it had been long unaccustomed, and learning and civilization began to revive. In the midst of this prosperity, a circumstance occurred, which, though little noticed at the time, became the source of unparal leled misfortunes to the East. This was the seizure of the mountain-castle of Alamut, and the foundation of the order of the Assassins, by Hassan Sabah. This formidable enthusiast had become a convert to the Ismaelian doctrines, in which the creed of Islam was mingled with the darker and more gloomy super stitions of Asiatic paganism. His followers, persuaded that obedience to the commands of their chief would ensure their eternal felicity, never hesitated to encounter any danger in order to remove his enemies. Emissaries from the formidable Sheikh al Jebalt went in disguise to palaces and private houses, * His name signifies the Conquering Lion. f \" Lord of the Mountain ;\" from the equivocal sense of the Arabic word Sheikh, the name is commonly translated \" Old Man of the Mountain.\""], [87, "73 OVERTHROW OF THE KHALIPHATE. watching the favourable opportunity of striking the mortal blow, to those who had provoked the hostility of their grand master. So dreadful was this scourge, that Oriental historians, during a long period of their annals, terminate their account of each year with a list of the men of note who had fallen victims during its course to the daggers of the assassins. After the death of Malek Shah (a. d. 1092), disputes arose between his sons, which led to sanguinary civil wars, and the dismemberment of the empire. Three powerful sultanies were formed from its fraoments, namely Iran, Kerman, and Rum, or Iconium. That of Iran was the most powerful, for it possessed the rich provinces of Upper Asia, but its greatness soon declined. The emirs, or governors of cities and provinces, threw off their allegiance, and under the modest title of Attabegs*, exercised sovereign authority. The Seljukians of Rum, known to the crusaders as the sultans of Nice, or Iconiumt, were first raised into notice by Soleiman. Their history is important only from its con nexion with that of the crusades. These divisions were the cause of the success which attended the early wars of the Christians in Palestine, and of the qualified independence of the late khaliphs, who shook off the Seljukian yoke, and established themselves in the sovereignty of Irak Arabi, or the province of Bagdad. * Atta-beg is a Turkish word, and signifies \" father or guardian of the prince.\" -f- Cogni, or Iconium, is a city of Lyeaonia, which these sultans made their capital, after Nice had been taken by the crusaders. E"], [88, "74 CHAPTER IV. GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. Section I. \u2014 History of Hildebr and, or Gregory VII. The establishment of the German empire beyond the Alps seemed to threaten the complete destruction of the papal power; the pontiffs ceased to have independent authority ; the emperors not only claimed a voice in pontifical elections, but insisted on a right of nomination ; the court disposed of ecclesiastical dignities at its pleasure ; and the Church was placed completely under the control of the state. Two circumstances combined to render the imperial supremacy of brief duration : the first was the permanence of the Romish See, which contrasted strongly with the revolutions of all civil governments. While successive changes altered dynasties and removed monarchies, the Church continued immutable; it would consequently retain all the advantages it had once gained ; it could sell its aid to the best bidder, when rival parties courted its alliance ; and it could seize its share of power in a general scramble. A second cause was that the imperial administration of ecclesiastical affairs led to gross corruptions. The emperor, surrounded by powerful vassals, whose favour could be won only by large bribes, frequently purchased support, by giving the highest dignities of the church to ignorant and vicious men, whose only recommendation was their consanguinity to some unprincipled noble, or leader of mercenary soldiers, ready to sell himself to a sovereign or a rebel, as the prospect of advantage varied. Society became rapidly demoralized, ecclesiastical dig nitaries openly practised the violence and the vice which it was their duty to denounce .- the laity, unrestrained, followed the same course; ignorance and immorality were fast spreading over the fairest portions of Europe. It was at this crisis that"], [89, "75 HISTORY OF IIILDEBRAND, OR GREGORY VII. the celebrated Hildebrand undertook to be the reformer of the age, to correct its depraved manners, and restore the purity of religion. His end was noble ; the means he used to attain it were more than questionable. His project was to replace the government of kings, which aristocratic usurpations had rendered almost nugatory, by a more imposing authority, whose salutary yoke imposed equally on the great and the humble, would give efficacy to the laws, and fix a restraint upon licentiousness. This new authority was the spiritual power of the papacy of which Hildebrand may be said to have been the creator. Two great objects presented themselves to the mind of this reformer, for such we must consider Hildebrand, though his reforms subsequently produced evils as great as those they were designed to remove; he had to make the world obedient to the Church, and to make the Church subservient to the papacy. Born of humble parents (a. d. 1020), he had many difficulties to encounter in early life, but he triumphed over them less by his abilities, great as they were, than by the inflexible firmness of character. The rigid rule of the feudal nobles prevented any man of mean birth from attaining to any dignity in the state; Hildebrand therefore devoted himself to the Church, with an earnestness that soon attracted the attention of his superiors. At the early age of twenty-four he was entrusted with the important charo-e of reforming the abuses that had crept into the Roman monas teries, and he executed this difficult task with equal zeal and discretion. The state of the papacy at this time was perfectly disgraceful; three popes contended for the possession of the pontifical throne; their vices and violence filled Italy with confusion, until tho emperor, Henry II. , deposed them all, and nominated Clement II. to the Holy See. Clement, and his successor, Damasus II. , perished by poison ; Leo IX., a man of strict integrity, but weak understanding, was next chosen by the emperor, and Hildebrand soon obtained complete ascendancy over the mind of the unsuspicious pontiff. On this and three subsequent occa sions Hildebrand was the zealous supporter of the imperial cause, for the ambitious monk, now advanced to the dignity of cardinal, saw that a German pope, unacquainted -with the E 2"], [90, "76 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. customs and manners of Italy, must of necessity be guided by his ministers. It was during the papacy of Nicholas II. that Hildebrand began openly to develop his plans for establishing the supremacy of the Church. Profiting by the minority of Henry IV., he induced Nicholas to grant Robert Guiscard the title of duke, with the investiture of all the lands which he had conquered, or should conquer, in Sicily, Apulia, and Calabria. Aided by the ferocious Normans, whose support had been thus easily purchased, Nicholas triumphed over the haughty Roman nobles that had hitherto defied his authority and controlled his power; he punished these chiefs with such remorseless severity, that the country round Rome was depopulated, and the tran- quillity that followed has been sometimes called \" the peace of desolation.\" On the death of Nicholas, Hildebrand appeared for the first time as the open adversary of the German court ; without wait ing for the commands of the empress-regent, he procured the election of Alexander II. , and succeeded in supporting this pope arrainst his rival Honorius, whom the empress had nominated. Alexander was a mere puppet in the hands of the cardinal monk, his minister, under whose guidance he effected more for the extension of the papal power than any of his predecessors ; he even summoned the young emperor to appear as a criminal before the tribunal of St. Peter, and answer charges brought against him by the German princes and prelates. Henry IV. was a sovereign not deficient in spirit ; he would have replied to such audacity by visiting Rome at the head of an army, but he was compelled to direct all his energies to the suppression of a revolt in Saxony ; and before that province was tranquillized, Alexander had sunk into an early grave. When the news of Alexander's death became public, the Roman populace demanded the election of Hildebrand with so much fury, that the affrighted cardinals hasted to offer him the pontificate, which he at once accepted, taking the title of Gregory VII. By a hypocritical pretence of humility and submission, he procured the imperial sanction for his irregular elevation ; while at the head of an army he enforced the sub mission of the Norman dukes in southern Italy. His first aim"], [91, "77 HISTORY OF HILDEBRAND, OR GREGORY VII. was to withdraw the Church from its dependence on the secular power, by abolishing the investiture of the crosier and ring, a subject which soon spread confusion through Christendom. This form of investiture gave to sovereigns the right of nam ing, or confirming, and that of deposing bishops, according to their pleasure. It also secured them the right of conferring, at their will, the fiefs and privileges with which the munificence and piety of former princes had endowed the sees and churches. Prelates were put in possession of these fiefs by receiving from the sovereign the symbols of a ring and a cross, which were the ensigns of episcopal dignity. When princes thus gave inves titure, they compelled the prelate to swear liege homage, like any other feudal lord, whence resulted subjection to the sove reign, and the obligation of furnishing him with military aid in his wars. Though all monarchs were interested in maintaining this supremacy, it was more particularly important to the emperors of Germany, who had committed the great fault of pilacing in the hands of the ecclesiastical dignitaries the principal part of their domains ; so that, depriving these princes of the patronage of benefices, was in fact stripping them of more than half their empire. The bishops flattering themselves with the hope of an imaginary liberty, forgot the benefits they had received from the emperors, threw themselves into the arms of the pope, and turned against their sovereigns the arms that had been so imprudently confided to them. It was necessary to break another link which bound the clero-y to civil society, the marriage of priests, which was then as common in the western as it is now in the eastern churches. It is true that the law of celibacy recommended by St. Augustin had already been recognised by the Romish See, but it was far from being generally adopted, especially in northern countries, and priests continued to marry, not only in Germany, Scandi navia, and England, but even in France, Spain, and Italy, notwithstanding the decrees of synods and councils. Gregory renewed the law of celibacy in a council held at Rome, with unusual severity, requiring that all who would not quit their wives should be deprived of their benefices. Great opposition was made to this decree by the clergy in various parts of"], [92, "78 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. Europe, and it required all the firmness of Gregory VIL, and his successors, to triumph over such resistance. Henry IV. witnessed the progress of these usurpations with secret rage, but he was forced for a time to dissemble, owing to the disturbances in Saxony. The arrogance of the pope pre cipitated a rupture which could not long be delayed; he sum moned the emperor to appear in Rome to answer the accusations of the Saxon lords (a. d. 1076), who had made complaints of his conduct. The emperor, fired by such an insult, convoked an assembly of bishops at Worms, and deposed the pope. Gregory at once launched a bull of excommunication and depo sition against Henry, and absolved his subjects from their allegiance. A religious war ensued; the emperor displayed great courage and constancy, but the papal influence was too powerful, and Henry, after enduring incredible fatigues in a journey over the Alps, was forced to solicit a personal interview from Gregory. The haughty pontiff subjected his enemy to the most galling humiliations ; before Henry was admitted into the fortress of Canossa, where the pope resided, he was forced to dismiss his attendants, and lay aside the ensigns of his imperial dignity ; for three consecutive days, during the severest winter that had been known for several years in northern Italy, he was forced to stand bare-footed and fasting in the open air, imploring pardon of his transgressions from God and the pope ; and, when fir. ally admitted to the presence of Gregory, he obtained not a remission, but a mere suspension of the sentence of excommu nication. As might have been expected, the emperor took an early opportunity of seeking revenge for these insults. Wax was renewed, and fortune proved unfavourable to Gregory, whose chief supporter, Guiscard, was engaged in war with the Greek emperor. The pope, however, aided by his Norman auxiliaries, took Rome by storm, and reduced the city to an untenable mass of luins. War produced famine, which was soon followed by a destructive pestilence ; Gregory himself was one of the earliest victims ; he died at Salerno, exclaiming with his latest breath, \" I have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, and therefore I die in exile.\""], [93, "79 STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE PAPAL AND IMPERIAL POWERS. Section II. \u2014 Continuation of the Struggle between the Papal and Imperial Powers. Henry IV. gained but a brief respite by the death of his for midable antagonist ; Gregory's successors, Urban II. and Paschal II. , steadily pursued his course of policy, and found strenuous supporters among the emperor's vassals. They raised enemies against Henry in the bosom of his family, encouraged his sons in their unnatural rebellions, and drew upon him the fanatical hostility of the leaders of the first crusade in their passage through Italy. For twenty years the unhappy monarch had to endure the fierce hatred of ambitious pontiffs, the revolts of priest-ridden vassals, and the rebellions of undutiful children. He was at length basely deposed by his second son Henry, and died in old age, sorrow, and poverty (a. d. 1106), destitute and broken-hearted. Henry V., though raised to the empire by the influence of the clergy, soon became disgusted with the extravagant claims of the pontiffs, and the war of investitures was renewed with greater fury than ever. The struggle was long and sanguinary, but it was finally settled by a convention, in which the emperor granted the right of free election to the ecclesiastical chapters, resigned the investiture by cross and ring, and reserved only the power of judging in appeal, and the investiture by sceptre, of the temporal fiefs annexed to the bishoprics and abbacies. Though the link of vassalage was thus continued between the emperors and the prelates, yet the former being bound to accept the persons who should henceforward be canonically elected, virtually resigned all power when they yielded their right of refusing investiture. On the death of Henry V. (a. d. 1125), his successor, Lotharius, made a vigorous effort to restore the imperial authority, but he was not able to resist the diplomatic skill of Pope Innocent II. , to whom he not only submitted in the question of investitures, but paid him homage, and received the crown kneeling before his footstool. In the reign of Conrad, the next emperor, and founder of the Hohenstauffen dynasty, the partisans of the popes began to be"], [94, "80 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. distinguished by the title of Guelphs, while the supporters of the imperial cause were denominated Ghibellins. These factions filled every city in Italy with their tumults, and in most contests the friends of the emperors were worsted. The struggle between the imperial and papal authorities facilitated the acquisition of independence by the states and princes of the empire; the Hohenstauffen dynasty was forced to purchase the support of feudatories by the cession of privileges, by which the Germanic constitution was changed into a kind of federative union, the emperor becoming merely the common chief and feudal suzerain of really independent princes. Frederic I., surnamed Barbarossa, from the colour of his beard, made a vigorous stand against the usurpations both of the pope and his vassals ; he triumphed over all opposition in the field ; but the court of Rome atoned for weakness in the field by its diplomatic skill, and the emperor lost the fruits of his victories at the very moment they seemed most secure within his grasp. The reign of Henry VI. pre- sented little remarkable in the great contest for supremacy ; but soon after the accession of Frederic II., a child only three years of age, Innocent III. took advantage of his minority to seize on the absolute sovereignty of the city of Rome, and to compel the prefect to swear the liege homage to the pope which had pre- viously been given to the empire (a. d. 1198). The emperors began from this time to be cautious in provoking the resentment of a court, whose power they had learned to dread, they unhe- sitatingly recognised the complete independence of the popes, and even formally announced the sovereignty which their pre- decessors had exercised over the city of Rome and the ecclesi- astical states. The papal domains were considerably increased by the acquisition of the Marches of Ancona, and the Duchy of Spoleto, and by the cession of the long disputed inheritance of the Countess Matilda to Pope Honorius III. The countess had made a grant of her fiefs and tenures to Gregory VII. (a. d. 1077), and his successors claimed the entire inheritance, though the countess had not the power of alienating the fiefs which she held directly under the crown of Italy, for in default of feudal heirs the right to them vested in the emperor. The question was .fiercely contested for nearly half a century, but at length"], [95, "81 STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE PAPAL AND IMPERIAL POWERS. Frederic II. abandoned all his claims to Honorius, and the popes formed these provinces into a domain which was called \" the Patrimony of St. Peter.\" One of the principal means used by the popes for the extension of their new power, was the multiplication of religious orders and societies. Before the accession of Gregory VII., the order of the Benedictines was the only one known in the west, and the rule of St. Benedict was the sole guide for the Latin monastic institutions, as that of St. Basil still continues for the Greek. Under Gregory, three new orders arose, of which the Carthusians were the most remarkable ; to these were added the mendicant orders in the reign of Pope Innocent III., which soon multiplied so rapidly as to excite murmurs and suspicions in every part of Christendom. The popes soon discovered that they could rely more confidently on this ecclesiastical militia, than on the secular clergy, and they gradually conceded exemptions to these several orders, by which they were withdrawn from the local juris diction of their bishops, and subjected only to their generals and the popes. They also secured to them several important privi leges, such as the exclusive privilege of preaching, and instructing youth, which were, of course, the most effective means of in creasing their power and influence. Hence the monks, frequently employeel by the popes as legates and missionaries, feared and respected by sovereigns, revered as inspired teachers by the people, neglected no opportunity of exalting and extending the power from which their own influence, consideration, and authority were tlerived. Of all the successors of Gregory VII., Innocent III. was the one who most nearly resembled him in the superiority of his genius, and the extent of his knowledge. The rival of Gregory in ambition and skill, he surpassed him in the boldness of his plans, and the success of his enterprises. His own words will best explain the extravagance of his pretensions : \" As God,\" he says, in a memorable epistle, \" has placed two great lights in the firmament of heaven, the one to rule the day and the other the night, so he has established two great powers, the pontifical and the royal ; and as the moon receives its light from the sun, e 3"], [96, "GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. 82 so the royal power derives all its splendour from the pontifical authority.\" But the pride of Innocent did not evaporate in words ; he was the founder of the Inquisition, the dreadful tribunal which, in a very short time became the firmest support of sacerdotal authority, and by a series of new regulations in the elections of bishops, and collation of benefices, he transferred the principal ecclesiastical patronage of Christendom to the court of Rome. These successive usurpations gradually established spiritual despotism in Europe, and a series of wars, misnamed \" holy,\" tended at once to encourage and secure the triumphs of the pontiffs. Section III. \u2014 The Crusades. The wars undertaken by the crusaders for the conquest of Pales tine, at the instigation of the popes, form an essential part of the history of the great struggle between the spiritual and tem poral -powers. To understand aright the influence they exer cised, it will be necessary to cast a retrospective glance at their origin, and at the state of society in the eastern and western world, when first this great movement began. Pilgrimages to Jerusalem, and the localities that had been hallowed by our blessed Saviour's presence, were common in the earliest ages of the church. They began to multiply very rapidly at the beginning of the eleventh century, in consequence of an opinion very generally diffused, that the end of the world was at hand ; many persons sold their estates, and migrated to the Holy Land, to wait there the coming of the Lord. W'hilst the Saracens remained masters of Palestine, they encouraged and protected visiters whose arrival brought them considerable profit, but when the Seljukian Turks wrested the country from the Khaliphs of Eg)-pt, the pilgrims were subjected to every extortion and outrage that fanaticism anel ignorance could dic tate. Their sad recital of the calamities they were forced to"], [97, "83 THE CRUSADES. endure excited universal indignation, and Gregory VII. was the first to propose a general arming throughout Christendom, for the purpose of driving the Turks beyond the Euphrates. The time was not propitious for such an undertaking ; the wars of the empire engaged the attention and employed the arms of the chief military leaders. But when the Normans had completed the conquest of England and the two Sicilies, when the imperial power had sunk before the popes in Italy and the feudal princes in Germany, vast hordes of military adventurers remained without employment, ready to embrace any cause that promised to gratify their love of glory and plunder. At this moment an enthusiastic monk, usually called Peter the Hermit, indignant at the oppression of the Christians, which he had witnessed in Palestine, began to preach the duty of expelling the infidels from the patrimony of Christ, and by his energetic labours, widely diffused his own fanaticism. Peter's zeal was vigorously seconded by Pope Urban II. ; the pontiff went personally to France, and held a council at Cler mont (a. d. 1095), where the war was sanctioned with great enthusiasm, and multitudes assumed the badge of the cross, as the symbol of their enlistment. The first hordes of crusaders were ignorant fanatics, guided by men of no note or experience. They marched without order or discipline, pillaging, burning, and plundering the countries that they traversed. Most of these wretches perished by fatigue, famine, disease, or the swords of the people they had outraged, but not before their excesses had indelibly stigmatized the cause in which they were engaged. At length a regular army was organized, under the command of Godfrey of Bouillon, duke of Lower Lorraine, one of the most celebrated generals of the age. No sovereign joined his stand ard, but the leading nobility of Christendom were enrolled among his followers, among whom may be mentioned, Robert, duke of Normandy, eldest son of William the Conqueror, Hugh, brother of the king of France, Bohemond, prince of Tarentum, and Raymond, count of Toulouse. When the divisions of this for midable army arrived near Constantinople, Alexis, who then ruled the Byzantine empire, was naturally terrified by the appearance of hosts, too powerful to be received as auxiliaries, and too"], [98, "GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. 84 formidable to be rejected as enemies. The crafty Greek had recourse to treachery and dissimulation ; after a disgusting train of fraudulent negotiations, the Latin warriors passed into Asia, leaving behind them worse enemies in the Christians of the Byzantine empire, whom it was part of their object to protect, than the Turks they had come to assail. Their early career in Asia was glorious, but purchased at an enormous expenditure of life. Nicea, the capital of the sultany of Rum, was taken ; a great victory over the sultan Soleiman opened a passage into Syria ; Antioch was captured after a siege of unparalleled diffi culty, and finally, Jerusalem, which had been recently wrested from the Turks by the Egyptians, fell before the arms of the crusaders, and became the capital of a new kingdom (a. d. 1099). Godfrey of Bouillon was chosen sovereign of Palestine ; he refused the title of king, declaring that Christ was the true monarch of the Holy Land, and declined to wear a crown of gold, where his Saviour had borne a crown of thorns. Baldwin, his brother and successor, was less scrupulous ; he assumed the royal ensigns and titles, and transmitted the throne to his cousin Baldwin du Bourg, whose posterity continued to reign in Pales tine until the kingdom was overthrown by Saladin (a. d. 1187). Several minor states were established by the crusaders, of which the most remarkable were the county of Edessa, the principality of Antioch, the county of Tripoli, and, at a later period, the kingdom of Cyprus. None of these states had long duration; the Christians of the east, continually assailed by powerful ene mies, could not be persuaded to unite cordially for mutual defence; victories were scarcely less calamitous to them than defeats, on account of the difficulty of obtaining reinforcements from Europe ; and though the crusading enthusiasm endured for two centuries, its heat gradually abated, and nothing would have kept it alive but the privileges and grants made by the popes, and the principal European potentates, to those who joined in such expeditions. Six principal crusades followed the first great movement ; they were all either unsuccessful or productive of advantages as fleeting as they were trivial. Forty-eight years after Jerusalem had been taken by the Christians, the emperor, Conrad III., and Louis VII., king of"], [99, "85 THE CRUSADES. France, undertook a second crusade to support the sinking for- tunes of their brethren in Palestine (a. d. 1117)- The Atta-beg Zenghi, who had, by his superior prowess, obtained the chief command over the Turkish tribes in Irak, attacked the Christian territories beyond the Euphrates, and made himself master of Edessa, justly regarded as the bulwark of the kingdom of Jeru- salem. Conrad proceeded to Constantinople without waiting for his ally. He had to encounter the treacherous hostility of the Byzantine emperor, which proved fatal to an army con- taining the flower of German chivalry, including a troop of noble ladies who served in the attituele and armour of men. Manuel, who then held the throne of Constantinople, gave the sultan secret intelligence of the German line of march, and fur- nished Conrad with treacherous guides. After a glorious but unsuccessful battle on the banks of the M\u00e6ander, Conrad was forced to retreat ; he met the French advancing from the Bos- phorus, and the contrast of his own condition with the pomp of Louis, led him to desert the cause. The French, undismayed and unwarned, pursued their march with inconsiderate speed, their rear-guard was surprised by the Turkish troops, while the van was at a considerable distance, and the greater part put to the sword. Louis brought the shattered remnant of his forces by sea to Antioch ; the Christians of Palestine joined him in an unsuccessful siege of Damascus, after which the monarch re turned to Europe, dishonoured by a faithless wife, and deserted by ungrateful allies. Noureddin *, the son of Zenghi, destroyed the dynasty of the Fatimite Khaliphs in Egypt. His favourite, Saladin t, usurped the government of Egypt, and, though a Kurd by descent, became the favourite hero both of the Turks and Arabs. On the death of his ancient master, Saladin invaded the Christian territories, and after a brief siege, made himself master of Jerusalem (a. d. 1187)- The loss of the holy city filled all Europe with sorrow; the emperor, Frederic I., the lion-hearted Richard of England, Philip Augustus of France, and several * Nur-ed-di'n, signifies \"the light of religion.\" -J- Salah-ed-diu, signifies \"the safety of religion.\""], [100, "86 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. minor princes, assumed the cross, while the maritime states of Italy, by sending immediate reinforcements to the garrisons on the coasts of the -Mediterranean, arrested the progress of Saladin. Frederic advanced through the Byzantine territories, 'harassed at every step by Greek fraud and treachery. Having wintered at Adrianople, he crossed the Hellespont, defeated the Turks in several engagements, and stormed the city of Iconium. But in the midst of his glorious career, he was drowned in the river Cydnus (a. d. 1190). The army persevered, and joined the eastern Christians in the famous siege of Acre. While Acre was closely pressed by the Christians, the be siegers were, in their turn, so strictly blockaded by Saladin, that they suffered more than the garrison. The kings of England and France, however, followed by the flower of their dominions, appeared together as companions in arms, and reached Palestine by sea.- Jealousy soon arose between the sovereigns ; Philip, unable to brook the superiority which Richard acquired by his military prowess, and perhaps, in some degree, by his wealth, returned home, leaving a part of his army under the command of the duke of Burgundy, for the defence of the Holy Land. But the animosity between the French and English parties was increased rather than abated by the departure of Philip ; the envy of his companions rendered the valorous exertions of Richard unavailing ; he entered into a treaty with Saladin, obtaining for the Christians free access to Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre, and then hasted home to defend his dominions from the attacks of his ancient rival (a.d. 1192). On his return, the English monarch was seized and imprisoned by the eluke of Austria ; he was subsequently resigned to the custody of the emperor of Germany, from whom he had to purchase his liberation by the payment of a large ransom. The illustrious Saladin did not long survive the departure of the royal crusader ; he died at Damascus, and the disputes that arose respecting his inheritance, prevented the Mohammedans from completing the destruction of the Latin kingdom of Palestine. The fourth crusade was undertaken at the instigation of Innocent III. (a. d. 1202), aided by a fanatic preacher, Foulkc of Neuilly. The fervour of enthusiasm had now abated, no"], [101, "87 THE CRUSADES. great sovereign joined in the enterprise, but several of the most potent feudatories offered their services, and Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, was chosen commander-in-chief. The crusaders obtained transports from the Venetians, by conquering Zara, in Dalmatia, for the republic of Venice, in spite of the threats and remonstrances of the pope, who was justly indignant at seeing their first efforts directed against a Christian city. But this departure from their original design, was followed by a still more remarkable deviation ; instead of proceeding to Palestine, they sailed against Constantinople, to dethrone the usurper, Alexius Antrelus. The crusaders succeeded in restoring the lawful emperor, Isaac, to his empire ; but the reward they claimed for their services was extravagant, and Isaac's efforts to comply with the stipulations, provoked such resentment, that he was deposed by his subjects, and put to death, together with his son. The crusaders instantly proclaimed war against the usurper, Mourzoufle, laid siege to Constantinople, took the city by storm, pillaged it with remorseless cruelty, and founded a new Latin empire on the ruins of the Byzantine (a. d. 1204). Baldwin, count of Flanders, was chosen sovereign of the new state, which, under five Latin emperors, lasted little more than half a century. Constantinople was recovered by the Greeks (a.d. 1261), and the hopes of uniting the eastern and western churches, which the possession of the Byzantine capital had inspired, were blighted for ever. The fifth crusade was conducted by the king of Hungary. Two hundred thousand Franks landed at the eastern mouth of the Nile, persuaded that the conquest of Egypt was a necessary preliminary to the recovery and safe possession of Palestine (a. d. 1218). After having obtained some important successes, their cause was ruined by the arrogance and presumption of the papal legate, who assumed the direction of the army. They purchased some trivial concessions, by evacuating all their con quests, and the pope, who at first proposed to come in person to their assistance, was too busily engaged in checking the progress of heresy, to venture on an expedition to Palestine. Frederic II. , emperor of Germany, led a formidable army to"], [102, "88 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. Palestine, after having been excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX., for delaying his expedition, a sentence which was renewed because he ventured to sail without waiting for the papal orders (a. d. 1228). This war exhibited the strange anomaly of a champion of the cross exposed to the bitterest hostility of the Church. Frederic was everywhere victorious, but the papal legates and the priests harassed him by constant opposition ; a crusade was preached against him in Italy, anel efforts were made to weaken his authority in his own hereditary dominions. By a treaty with the sultan, he obtained for the Christians possession of Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, Tyre, and Sidon, but his services were rewarded with ingratitude, and he returned home in disgust. Tranquillity, which endured fifteen years, raised the Latins of Palestine to a prosperous condition ; but a new and more formi dable enemy, issuing from the deserts of Tartary, subverted the kingdom which had been founded at such an expense of blood and treasure. The Khorasmian Turks, driven from their native deserts by the Mongols, threw themselves upon Palestine, stormed Jerusalem, subverted the Latin principalities, and the small Turkish states in Syria. Jerusalem, and the greater part of Palestine, was subsequently annexed to the sultany of Egypt. Louis IX., of France, commonly called St. Louis, led the ninth crusade. Egypt was the scene of his operations ; after obtaining some important triumphs, he was defeated, made prisoner, and forced to purchase his freedom by the payment of a large ransom (a. d. 1250). Untaught by this calamity, he prepared for a seconrl crusade ; on his voyage to the place of rendezvous, he was induced to steer to Tunis, in the wild hope of baptizing its king (a. d. 1270). Instead of a proselyte, Louis found a tedious siege, and a mortal disease. On his death, the remnant of his army was led back to Europe without making any further effort. The fate of Palestine was for a time delayed by the valour of Edward I., of England, who extorted a three years' truce from the Mohammedans. At length, some excesses of the Latins provoked the resentment of the Mameluke sultan, Khalil; he resolved to expel them completely from"], [103, "89 THE CRUSADES. Palestine, and laid siege to their last strong-hold, Acre (a. d. 1291). The city was taken after a tedious siege, and after its fall, the title of King of Jerusalem, still preserved by the Chris tian princes, became an empty name. Section IV. \u2014 Consequences of the Crusades. Though the popes did not succeed in establishing their supre macy over the eastern churches, as they seem to have expected, yet they derived very important advantages from the wars of the crusaders. Not the least of these was the general recog nition of their right to interfere in the internal management of states ; they compelled emperors and kings to assume the cross ; they levied taxes at their discretion on the clergy throughout Christendom for the support of these wars ; they took under their immediate protection the persons and properties of those who enlisted, and granted privileges to the adventurous warriors, which it would have been deemed impiety to contravene. Those who joined in these wars, frequently bequeathed their estates to the Church, in the not improbable case of their death without heirs ; those whom cowarelice or policy detained at home, atoned for their absence by founding ecclesiastical endowments. The popes, willing to improve these advantages, preached new cru sades for the north and west of Europe ; warriors were invited to attack the Moors of Spain, the emperors and kings who displeased the pope, the pagan nations which surrounded the Baltic and the Albigensian and Hussite heretics. While the papal power increased, that of monarchs declined ; in Germany, the Hohenstauffen gradually lost all influence ; in Eno-land, the barons extorted a charter from John, and the Hungarian chiefs placed similar restrictions on their sovereign. Peculiar circumstances led to a contrary result in France ; many of the great feudatories having fallen in a distant land, the monarchs were enabled to extend their prerogatives, while their domains were increased by seizing the properties of those who died without feudal heirs, or of those who were suspected of"], [104, "90 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. heretical opinions. The Christian kings of Spain and northern Europe derived also some profit from the fanaticism of the age, being aided by troops of warlike adventurers, in extending their dominions at the expense of their Mohammedan and pagan neighbours. Chivalry, though older than the crusades, derived its chief in fluence and strength from these wars. The use of surnames, coats of arms, and distinctive banners, became necessary in armies composed of men differing in language, habits, and feelings, col lected at hazard from every Christian kingdom. Tournaments were the natural result of pride and courage, in warriors naturally jealous of each other's fame, while the institution of the military orders invested knighthood with a mysterious religious sanction. The first of these was the order of the Hospitallers, or Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, known subsequently as the Knights of Malta. They were formed into a confraternity by Pope Pascal (a. d. 1114), but their order was greatly enlarged by Pope Calixtus. They bore an octagonal white cross on their black robes, and were bound to wage war on infidels, and attend to sick pilgrims. After the loss of the Holy Land, they removed successively to Cyprus, Rhodes, and Malta. Their order held Malta until a. d. 1798, when they were deprived of their last possession by Napoleon. The Knights Templars, distinguished by the red cross, were instituted soon after the Hospitallers. Their original duty was to keep the roads free for the pilgrims that visited the Holy Sepulchre, but as their numbers increased, they became the great bulwark of the Christian kingdom of Palestine, and the posses sors of rich endowments in every part of western Europe *. At length their wealth excited the cupidity of monarchs ; they were overwhelmed by a mass of forged accusations ; many of the noblest knights were put to death by torture, and the order wholly abolished at the council of Vienne (a. d. 1312). The Teutonic order was originally a confraternity of German knights, formed during the siege of Acre, for the relief of the * The Temple in London belonged to the Red-cross knights; the Hospitallers possessed a splendid preceptory in Clerkenwell, part of which is still standing."], [105, "91 CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRUSADES. sick and wounded. It was formally instituted by Pope Celestin III. (a.d. 1192), and a code of regulations prescribed for its direction. Their ensign was a black cross, on a white robe. They subdued the kingdom of Prussia (A. d. 1230), of which they held possession until the progress of the Reformation gave that country to a protestant prince (a. d. 1525). The last great order was that of St. Lazarus, instituted originally for super intending the treatment of leprosy, a loathsome disease which the crusaders introduced into Europe. It soon became military, like the preceding, but never rose to similar eminence. The Italian maritime states supplied the crusaders with trans ports, and conveyed to them provision and the munitions of war. This traffic led to a rapid increase in the commerce and navigation of the Mediterranean ; a taste for spices and other articles of Oriental luxury was gradually diffused throughout Europe, and trading depots were formed by Venice, Genoa, and other Italian powers, on the shores of the Levant, and the coasts of the Greek empire. Several French towns imitated this example, and in the remote North an association was formed for the protection and extension of commerce, between the cities of Lubeck and Hamburgh (a. d. 1241), which laid the foundation of the Hanseatic league. The progress of industry, the encouragement which sovereigns founel it their interest to grant to trade, and their anxiety to check the arrogance and rapacity of their feudal vassals, led to a great change in most European countries, the establishment of municipal institutions. Before this period, the inhabitants of towns were as much serfs and vassals to their feudal superiors, as the peasantry. The counts, or governors of cities, having rendered their power hereditary, soon made it despotic. They used their power cruelly, and drove the citizens at length to form associations for mutual defence. In Italy, the maritime cities erected them selves into republics, and their example was followed by the cities of Lombardy, during the wars between the popes, and the emperor, Henry IV. The French communes owed their civil liberty to both the policy and the want of Louis the Fat (a. d. 1108). He sold to his subjects the right of self-government, his example was followed by most of his powerful vassals, and"], [106, "92 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. in a very short time there were few cities which did not possess charters of incorporation. In England, the cities and boroughs were not only protected by the sovereigns against the barons, but their deputies were invited to take a share in the national councils (a. d. 1206), an example subsequently imitated in France and Germany. The royal authority gained considerably by the extension of municipal freedom. It checked the plundering habits which were naturally formed by the private wars of the barons, and it placed a restraint on the ambition of the nobles, who could no longer usurp privileges with impunity. The cities and towns saw that the sovereign was the pierson most interested in pro tecting their growing freedom, and they therefore gladly gave him their support in his struggles with the aristocracy and the clergy. The emancipation of the serfs was a consequence of municipal freedom. The free cities granted protection to all who sought shelter within their walls, and the nobles saw that they must either ameliorate the condition of their vassals, or witness the depopulation of their estates. Liberty thus gradu ally recovered its right; civilization consequently began to extend its blessings over society, and to chase away the darkness which ignorance and superstition had spread over Europe. The imperial house of Hohenstauffen fell from its pride of place on the death of the emperor Frederic II. , the great opponent of the papacy (a. d. 1250). His son Conrad fell a victim to disease, after a brief but troubled reign ; and the anarchy which succeeded in Germany, is justly named the calami tous period of the great interregnum. The wars between rival princes filled the country with plundering bands ; there would have been no security for life or property had not the cities combined for mutual consent, founding the confederation of the Rhine, and greatly extending the Hanseatic league. The chief feudatories and great officers of the crown arrogated to them selves the right of election, which had been previously shared by all the German princes ; they sought to bestow the sove reignty on princes too feeble to resist the progress of their ambition ; WTilliam of Holland, and an English prince, Richard, earl of Cornwall, were successively elected emperors, and"], [107, "CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRUSADES. 93 enjoyed little more than the title. At length, Rodolph, count of Hapsburgh, was chosen (a. d. 1273), and showed himself worthy of the crown by his energy in suppressing the predatory wars that were waged by his vassals. In the mean time, the popes, in defiance of the rights of the Hohenstauffen, had bestowed the kingdom of Naples on Charles, duke of Anjou, brother to the king of France. That prince hasted to secure his new grant ; Manfred, natural son of Frederic II. , who acted as regent during the minority of young Conradin, was defeated and slain near Benevento ; Charles became master of the two Sicilies, where his cruelties soon rendered him detested. Young Conradin, the last scion of his illustrious house, boldly resolved to attempt the recovery of his parental kingdom ; he was joined by his cousin, Frederic, duke of Austria, and several of the young Ger man nobles, by whose aid his early efforts were crowned with success. But Charles having procured strong reinforcements from France, encountered his rival near Alva, defeated his army with great slaughter, made the unfortunate Conradin prisoner, and after a mock trial, had him publicly executed (a. d. 1268). Thus the last of the Hohenstauffen, the dynasty which had struggled most determinately for the rights of kings against papal usurpations, perished shamefully on the scaffold, the victim of pontifical vengeance, and princely injustice. Section V. \u2014 State of Western Europe at the commencement of the Fourteenth Century. Rodolph of Hapsburgh had no sooner obtained possession of the empire than he resolved to strengthen the sovereign authority, by annexing some of the great fiefs to the crown. The usurpa tion of the duchy of Austria by Ottokar, king of Bohemia, afforded him a pretext for interfering in the disposal of that province ; he defeated Ottokar, and deprived him not only of Austria, but also of Stiria, Carinthia, and Camiola, which were formed into a new principality, and the investiture given to"], [108, "94 GROWTn OF THE PAPAL POWER. Albert, the emperor's son (a. d. 1282), who founded the imperial house of Austria. But while the emperor's authority was extended in Germany, it was almost unknown in Italy, where the republican cities generally withdrew even nominal allegiance from their former masters. Of these commercial states Venice was the most important. This city had been originally founded by some refugees who sought shelter in the islands and lagoons of the Adriatic, from the ferocity of the Huns (a. d. 452) ; but it first rose into importance under the doge Pierre Urseolo II. (a. d. 992), who obtained freedom of commerce for his fellow citizens from the Byzantine emperor and the sultan of Egypt, and subjected the maritime cities of Istria' and Dalmatia. In the wars between the empire and the papacy, they had generally supported the latter; Pope Alexander IIL, as a reward for their services, conferred on them the sovereignty of the Adriatic, and hence arose the singular ceremony of celebrating annually a mystic marriage between that sea and the Venetian doge. The crusades tended greatly to extend the power of the republic, especially the fourth, in which, as we have already stated, the Greek empire was dismembered. On this occasion, the Vene tians received from their allies several maritime cities in Dal matia, Albania, Epirus, and Greece, the islands of Crete, Corfu, Cephalonia, and several others in the Ionian cluster. But the increasing wealth of Venice led to a fatal change in its political constitution. The government was originally demo cratic, the power of the doge being limited by a council, who were freely chosen by the citizens. Several tumults at these elections furnished the doge, Peter Grandenigo, with an excuse for proposing a law abrogating annual elections, and rendering the dignity of councillor hereditary in the families of those who were at the period members of the legislative assembly (a. d. 1298). This establishment of a close aristocracy led to several revolts, of which that headed by Tiepolo was the most remarkable (a. d. 1310). After a fierce battle within the city, the insurgents were routed ; ten inquisitors were chosen to inves tigate the conspiracy, and this commission was soon ren dered permanent under the name of the Council of Ten, the"], [109, "WESTERN EUROPE IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. 95 most formidable tribunal ever founded to support aristocratic tyranny. > Genoa, like Venice, owed its prosperity to its extensive com merce, which flourished in spite of the several political convul sions that agitated the republic. The Genoese embraced the cause of the Greek emperors, and helped them to regain Con stantinople. Their services were rewarded by the cession of Caffa, Azov, and other ports on the Black Sea, through which they opened a lucrative trade with China and India. They obtained also Smyrna, and Pera, a suburb of Constantinople, together with several important islands in the Archipelago. Nor were they less successful in extending their power in Italy and the western Mediterranean, though they had to contend against powerful rivals in the citizens of Pisa. The mutual jealousies of these republics, and the anxiety of both to possess the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, led to a long and sanguinary war. It ended (a. d. 1290) in the complete overthrow of the Pisans, whose commerce was annihilated by the loss of the island of Elba, and the destruction of the ports of Pisa and Leghorn. Charles of Anjou did not long enjoy the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. His subjects justly hated him for the murder of Conradin, and; the insolence of the French soldiery confirmed their aversion. An atrocious insult offered to a Sicilian lady, provoked the celebrated insurrection, commonly called the Sicilian Vespers* (a. d. 1282), in which all the French residents in Sicily were massacred, with the exception of William Parcellet, whose virtues honourably distinguished him from his country men. The islanders placed themselves under the protection of the king of Arragon, and Charles, though aided by the pope, was unable to regain his authority over them. Spain continued divided into several small kingdoms, Chris - * The evening prayers in the Catholic Church are called Vespers, and the revolt commenced as the congregations were assembling at Palermo for the evening service, during the festival of Easter.

To the former belonged Navarre, Arragon, and Castile, of which the two last were gradually extending themselves at the expense of their Mohammedan neighbours. The Castilian monarch, Alphonso I., captured Madrid and Toledo (a. d. 1085) ; he would probably have ex pelled the Moors from Spain, had not a new burst of fanaticism in Africa supplied the Mohammedans with hordes of enthusiastic defenders in the moment of danger. The Moors not only recovered their strength, but became so formidable, that Pope Innocent III. published a crusade against them. A numerous Christian army assembled on the confines of Castile and Anda lusia ; they encountered their enemies near the city of Ubedav and inflicted on them a defeat, from which the Spanish Moham medans never recovered (a.d. 1212). Ferdinand IIL, king of Castile and Leon, profiting by the weakness of the Moors, sub dued the little kingdom of Cordova, Murcia, and Seville (a. d. 1256), so that the Mohammedans were reduced to the single kingdom of Granada. The crusade in Spain led to the foundation of a new kingdom in Europe. Henry of Burgundy, a member of the royal family of France, was so eminently distinguished by his valour in the Mohammedan wars, that Alphonso VI., king of Castile, gave him his daughter in marriage, with the investiture of the county of Portugal as her dowry. Henry enlarged his territory at the expense of the Mohammedans, but his fame was eclipsed by that of his son Alphonso, whom his soldiers proclaimed king on the gloriotis field of battle in which the power of the Mohammedans was destroyed (a. d. 1139). To secure his new royalty, Al phonso placed himself and his kingdom under the protection of the Holy See, and declared himself a liege subject of the pope. His successors found the Roman pontiffs by no means slow in availing themselves of the power thus ceded to them ; several violent struggles were made by the kings to free themselves from the yoke, but the power of the popes prevailed, and a treaty was concluded, by which the Portuguese cleroy were secured in extensive possessions, almost royal privileges, and a complete exemption from secular jurisdiction (a. d. 1289). As the governments of France and England began to assume"], [111, "97 WESTERN EUROPE IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. a stable form, rivalry arose between the two nations, which led to a long series of sanguinary wars. From the time of Capet's usurpation, the policy of the French kings had been to lessen the power of the great feudatories ; and it was a perilous error in Philip I. to sanction the duke of Normandy's conquest of England, for he thus permitted a vassal, already dangerous, to become his rival sovereign. The danger was greatly increased when Louis VII. divorced his faithless wife Eleanor, the heiress to the provinces of Guienne, Poitou, and Gascony. She married Henry II. , king of England, and thus enabled him to add her inheritance to that of the Plantagenets in France, which included the duchies of Normandy and the counties of Anjou and Maine (a.d. 1152). The vassal was now more powerful than his sovereign ; the throne of France indeed would scarcely have been secure, had not the family disputes of the Plantagenets, secretly fomented by the wicked Eleanor, caused Henry's sons to revolt against their indulgent father, and brought that able sovereign with sorrow to his grave. Philip Augustus was the founder of the greatness of the French monarchy. The Plan tagenets of England sunk rapidly before his superior talents. Richard I. was nothing more than a brave warrior, and unable to compete with the policy of his rival; his successor, John, was neither a soldier nor a statesman; he provoked the resent ment of all his subjects, and while assailed in England by the discontented barons, and menaced abroad by the pope, he was deprived of most of his continental dominions by the watchful kino- of France. Philip's neighbours, and many of his vassals, were alarmed at the vast increase of his power after his conquest of the Norman provinces ; they formed a league against him, but at the battle of Bouvines (a. d. 1214), he triumphed over the united forces of the Germans, the English, and the Flemings, and by this victory secured the possession of his acquisitions. The crusades in Palestine wasted the strength of the French sovereigns ; that which Louis VIIL undertook in Languedoc 'a.d. 1208), at the instigation of Pope Innocent IIL, considerably augmented the royal power. At the beginning of the thirteenth century, Languedoc, Provence, and Catalonia, were immediately dependent on the king of Arragon, who, like the king of F"], [112, "98 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. England, nominally paid homage for these provinces to the French crown. The inhabitants of these districts called them- selves Provencals ; they differed from their French neighbours in language, habits, and interests, surpassing them as much in civilization as they were inferior in the art of war. Their cities were numerous and flourishing ; they were governed by munici- palities of a form almost republican, and this had strengthened rather than diminished the attachment between them and their feudal superiors. A nation so enlightened as the Provencals could not long be enslaved by the gross superstitions that pre- vailed among their barbarous neighbours ; disgusted by the vices of their prelates, and at the same time strongly embued with religious feelings, they sought the instruction of sectarian preachers, whose lives were in accordance with the doctrines that they taught. These sectarians, called Vaudois, or Albi- genses, from the places where their doctrines found most followers, taught for the most part the creed adopted by the protestant Churches of the present day. There were some among them, however, who gave freer scope to their imagina- tions, and fell into the wild speculations and dangerous errors of the Manieh\u00e6an and other heresies. The original adoption of the reformed opinions neither had nor was designed to have any tendency to schism ; the Albigenses bore for a time the same relation to the Church of Rome that the Methodists, when first instituted, did to the Church of England. Converts merely engaged themselves to greater purity of life and conversation, to a stricter rule of morals, and a more diligent contemplation of their spiritual concerns. AVhen first these societies were known at Rome, the heads of the Church seem to have regarded the Paterins, the Catharins, the Poor Men of Lyons, and many similar designations, as new monastic institutions. Innocent III. was the first to discover that the independence of thought which they nurtured might prove of dangerous consequence to the extravagant pretensions of the papal see. A pontiff that menaced at the same moment the sovereigns of Germany, France, England, and Spain, that treated as his servants the kings of Hungary, Norway, and Armenia, that directed or reprimanded at his will the operations of the crusaders engaged in establish-"], [113, "WESTERN EUROPE IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. 99 ing a Latin empire at Constantinople, was by no means inclined to tolerate a difference of opinion. He commanded the Pro vencal lords, under pain of excommunication, to receive and support the inquisitors he sent into their dominions ; and the judges he selected for this difficult task were persons already notorious for bigotry and violence. Raymond VI., count of Toulouse, disgusted by the arrogance of one of the inquisitors, Peter de Castelnau, appealed bto the pope, but received in reply a letter full of menace and insult. While the dispute between the count and the legate was at its height, Castelnau was slain by a Provencal gentleman, whom he had insulted. Innocent instantly fulminated a bull against Raymond, who was innocent of the murder, directed the monks of Citeaux to preach a crusade against the heretics of Languedoc, and appointed Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, commander of the fanatic bands that enrolled themselves in the service of the Church. No language can adequately portray the miseries which the ferocious crusaders inflicted on the Provencals ; if for a moment their savage fury was mitigated, it was rekindled by the exhor tations of those who called themselves the ministers of a God of mercy. At the storming of Beziers, some knights, fearing that some who adhered to the Church might perish in the indiscri minate massacre, consulted their spiritual adviser, the abbot of Citeaux, as to the means by which they might distinguish Catholics from heretics : \u2014 \" Kill all,\" was the savage reply, \" Kill all ! God can distinguish those that belong to him !\" The war thus commenced, was supporteel in the same spirit for twenty years ; the son of Simon de Montfort sold his pretensions to Louis VIIL, king of France, who scrupled not to place himself at the head of the crusaders (a. d. 1226) ; the Provencals were utterly ruined, their cities levelled to the ground, and their fields laid desolate. The carnage ceased only from want of victims. A peace was at length concluded between the count of Toulouse and Louis IX., by which the greater part of Lan guedoc was annexed to the crown of France (a. d. 1229). The pope's gain was small in territorial acquisition, but he obtained advantages more important than provinces in the establishment F 2"], [114, "100 GROWTn OF TnE PAPAL POWER. of the Inquisition, and the foundation of the order of St. Dominic. Section VI. \u2014 State of England and the Northern Kingdoms at the Commencement of the Fourteenth Century. William the Conqueror reduced the Saxon population of Eng land to the most degrading state of vassalage, but he could not destroy the love and memory of their ancient laws and liberties, retained by the nation. His sons, William Rufus and Henry I. were successively enabled to seize the throne in prejudice of the rights of their elder brother Robert, by promising to restore the ancient laws of the kingdom. Henry, to conciliate the English more effectually, married a princess of Saxon descent ; on his death he bequeathed the crown to the surviving child by this marriage, Matilda, the wife of Geoffry Plantagenet, earl of Anjou. This arrangement was defeated by the usurpation of Stephen : England was convulsed by a civil war, which was terminated by Stephen's adopting Henry, Matilda's son, as his successor. Henry II., the first of the Plantagenet dynasty, on ascending the throne, united to England the duchy of Normandy, the county of Anjou, and the fairest provinces of north-western France (a. d. 1154). To these he added the more important acquisition of Ireland, partly by a papal donation, and partly by right of conquest. Ireland was at this period divided into five petty svoereignties, whose monarchs harassed each other by mutual wars, and could rarely be induced to combine for their common interest. The island had been frequently devastated, and once completely subdued, by the Danes ; several septs of these foreigners retained possession of the chief commercial cities, and even the king of Man was formidable to a country distracted by intestine wars. When their Norman brethren conquered England, the Danes in Ireland entered into a close correspondence with William and his successors, a circumstance which probably first suggested to Henry the notion of conquering the island. He applied to the"], [115, "101 THE NORTH IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. pope for a sanction of his enterprise. Adrian, the only English man that ever filled the papal throne, was at that time the reigning pontiff; his desire to gratify his native sovereign was stimulated by his anxiety to extend the papal authority. The Irish Church had been long independent of Rome ; and the connexion between its prelates and the papacy was as yet insecure ; it was therefore on the condition of subjecting Ireland to the jurisdiction of the Romish Church that a bull was issued, granting Henry permission to invade the country. The bitter feuds in the Plantagenet family, and the state of his continental dominions, long prevented the English monarch from availing himself of this permission. At length Dermod, king of Leinster, driven from his dominions by a rival sovereign, sought English aid, and was permitted to engage the services of Strongbow, and some other military adventurers, on condition of doing homage for his kingdom to Henry. The rapid successes of Strongbow awakened Henry's jealousy; he went to Ireland in person, and received the submission of its principal sovereigns (a. d. 1172). He returned without completing the conquest of the country, a circumstance productive of much misery and bloodshed through several successive centuries. The reign of Richard I. was a period of little importance in English history ; but that of his brother and successor, the profligate John, led to the most important results. The barons, provoked by his tyranny and his vices, took up arms, and com pelled him to sign the Great Charter, which laid the first per manent foundation of British freedom; the pope forced him to resign his crown, and to receive it back again, only on condition of vassalage to the Holy See, while Philip Augustus took advantage of these circumstances to deprive the English monarchs of most of their continental possessions. John's death saved England from becoming a province of France : absolved by Pope Innocent III. from his oath, he ventured to abrogate the Great Charter, upon which the English barons proffered the crown to Louis, the eldest son of Philip Augustus, who invaded England with the fairest prospects of success. John was completely defeated (a. d. 1216) ; he fled towards Scotland, but died upon the road. The English, already disgusted with their French"], [116, "102 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. allies, embraced this opportunity of rallying round Prince Henry, and Louis was glad to conclude a treaty for abandoning the island. Henry III. was a monarch wholly void of energy ; it was his misfortune to fill the throne at one of the most turbulent periods of English history, without talents to command respect, or resolution to enforce obedience. During his long reign, England was engaged in few foreign wars, but these were generally unfortunate. On the other hand, the country was agitated by internal commotions during the greater part of the fifty years that he swayed the sceptre. The discontent of the prelates and barons at the favour that the king showed to foreigners induced them to form an association, by which the king was virtually deposed, and the supreme authority vested in a committee of peers, with the earl of Leicester at its head. Leicester intro duced an important change into the constitution, by summoning representatives of counties, cities, and boroughs, to unite with the barons in the great council of the nation (a. d. 1265). This innovation laid the basis for the House of Commons, which henceforth had an increasing share in English legislation. The tyranny of the barons being found less endurable than that of the king, Henry was restored to his former power ; and his authority seemed fixed so permanently, that Prince Edward led an armament to the Holy Land, in aid of the last crusade of St. Louis. Henry died during his son's absence (a. d. 1272) ; but though two years elapsed before Edward's return home, the tranquillity of the country continued undisturbed. The chief object of Edward's ambition was to unite the whole of Great Britain under one sovereignty. __ Under the pretext of the Welsh prince, Llewelyn, having refused homage, he invaded the country, and completely subdued it; but not without encountering a desperate resistance. The English monarch staid more than a year in Wales to complete its pacification, and during that time his queen, Eleanor, gave birth to a son in the Castle of Carnarvon (a. d. 1284). The Welsh claimed the child as their countryman; and he was declared Prince of Wales, a title which has ever since been borne by the eldest sons; of the English kings."], [117, "THE NORTH IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. 103 The failure of the direct heirs to the crown of Scotland gave Edward a pretence for interfering in the affairs of that kingdom. Three competitors, Baliol, Bruce, and Hastings, laid claim to the crown; to avert the horrors of civil war, they agreed to leave the decision to Edward ; and he pronounced in favour of the first, on condition of Baliol's becoming a vassal to the king of England. Baliol soon grew weary of the authority exercised over him by Edward, and made an effort to recover his inde pendence ; but being defeated and taken prisoner he abdicated the throne (a. d. 1296), and was confined in the Tower of London. The Scottish nation, though vanquished, was not subdued; several insurrections were raised against the English yoke; but after the defeat and capture of the Scottish hero, Sir William Wallace, all hope of independence seemed to have vanished. At length, Robert Bruce raised the standard of revolt, and was crowned king at Scone (a. d. 1306). Edward once more sent an army into Scotland, and soon followed in person to subdue that obstinate nation. His death on the border (a. d. 1307), freed Bruce from his most dangerous foe ; and in the following reign the independence of Scotland was established by the decisive battle of Bannockburn (a. d. 1314). The northern kingdoms of Europe, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, offer little to our notice but scenes of horror and carnage. The natural ferocity and warlike spirit of the Northmen, the want of fixed rules of succession, and the difficulty of finding employment for turbulent spirits in piratical expeditions when the increase of civilization had given consistency to the governments of the south, and enabled them to provide for the protection of their subjects, multiplied factions, and produced innumerable civil wars. Crusades, however, were undertaken against the Selavonian and other pagan nations, by which the kings of Denmark and Sweden added considerably to their dominions, and gave them a high rank among the states of Europe. Prussia and Livonia were subdued by the knights of the Teutonic order; and Hungary, after having been almost ruined by the Mongolian hordes, began gradually to recover its importance after the retreat of these barbarians (a. d. 1244)."], [118, "104 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. Section VII. \u2014 Revolutions in the East in consequence of the Mongolian Invasion. There is no phenomenon more remarkable in history than the rise, progress, and extent of the Mongolian empire. It was thought that no human power could ever surpass the conquests of the Arabs, who in less than seventy years extended their sway over wider territories than the Romans had acquired in five centuries ; but the Mongols, or, as they are more commonly called, the Moguls, from as humble an origin, obtained greater dominion in a less time. Jenghiz Khan, in a single reign, issuing from a petty principality in the wilds of Tartary, acquired an empire stretching about six thousand miles from east to west, and at least half that space from north to south, including within its limits the most powerful and wealthy kingdoms of Asia. The vast and varied countries, loosely called Scythia by ancient, and Tartary by modern writers, are tenanted by hordes differing in manners, language, and even physical constitution, but which are frequently confounded with one another. Divided into numerous tribes, the several hordes are almost incessantly engaged in mutual wars, unless when some great leader arises, whose renown spreads through the nation, and then all the tribes hasten to range themselves beneath his standard. When they invade a country, they have no option between victory and death ; for other hordes, from more remote districts, press forward to occupy the pastures they have quitted, and thus cut off the possibility of their retreat ; but these, at the same time, form a body of reserve, ready and willing to supply the losses of war. The armies of a regular state contend against such hordes at an immense disadvantage ; a defeat is ruinous, for they give no quarter ; a victory useless, for the invaders have neither wealth nor country to lose, and are not conquered unless they are exterminated. The Mongols were first raised into eminence by Jenghiz Khan ; his original name was Temujin, and he was the chief of a small horde which his father's valour had elevated above the"], [119, "105 revolutions in the east. surrounding tribes. At an early age he was invited to the court of Vang Khan, the nominal head of the tribes of the Tartarian deserts, and received the hand of that potentate's daughter in marriage. Mutual jealousy soon led to a war between Temujin and his father-in-law; the latter was slain in battle, and Temujin succeeded to his authority. On the day of his installation, a pretended prophet named Kokza, addressing the new sovereign, declared that he was inspired by God to name him Jenghiz Khan, that is, supreme monarch, and to promise him the empire of the universe. Inspired by this prophecy, which, however, he is suspected of having suggested, Jenghiz zealously laboured to establish military discipline among the vast hordes that flocked to his standard ; and when he had organized an army, he invaded those provinces of northern China called Khatai by the oriental writers, and Cathay by our old English authors. In five years this extensive country was subdued, and Jenghiz directed his arms westward, provoked by an outrage of the sultan of Kharasm. This kingdom of Kharasm was among the most flourishing in central Asia ; the literary eminence of Bokhara, and the commercial prosperity of Samarcand, were celebrated throughout the East. The sultans Mohammed and his son and successor Jalaloddin were monarchs of dauntless bravery, but nothing could withstand the fury of the Mongols, and not only Kharasm, but the greater part of northern and eastern Persia, fell under the sway of Jenghiz. Astrachan was taken by a Mongolian detachment, and some of the hordes pushed their incursions as far as the confines of Russia. Jenghiz died in his seventy-sixth year (a. d. 1227), continuing his career of conquest almost to the last hour of his life. Few conquerors have displayed greater military abilities, none more savage ferocity. Lie delighted in slaughter and devastation ; his maxim was to slaughter, without mercy, all that offered him the least resistance. \" The successors of the Mongolian conqueror followed the course he had traced. They completed the subjugation of China, they overthrew the Khaliphate of Bagdad (a. d. 1258), and rendered the sultans of Iconium tributary. Okta'i Khan, the immediate F3"], [120, "106 GROWTH OF THE PAPAL POWER. successor of Jenghiz, sent two armies from the centre of China, one against the peninsula of Corea, the other to subdue the countries north and east of the Caspian. This latter army, under the guidance of Batii Khan, penetrated and subdued the Russian empire (a. d. 1237) ; thence the Mongols spread into Hungary, Poland, and Silesia, and even reached the coasts of the Adriatic Sea. The duchy of Wladi'mir was the only native Russian dynasty that preserved its existence ; it owed its good fortune to Alexander Newski, whose prudent measures con ciliated the favour of the conquerors, and secured him a tranquil reign. After the death of Kubla'i Khan, the grandson of Jenghiz, the Mongolian empire was partitioned by the provincial governors, and gradually sunk into decay. The overthrow of the Seljiikian sultans, and the Fatimite Khaliphs, byNoureddin and Saladin, has been already mentioned. The dynasty of the Ayiibites was founded by Saladin's descend ants in Syria and Egypt, and this, after having been divided into several states, was overthrown by the Mamalukes in the thirteenth century. The Mamelukes were Turkish captives, whom the ferocious Mongols sold into slavery ; great numbers of them were imported into Egypt in the reign of Sultan Saleh, of the Ayiibite dynasty. This prince purchased multitudes of the younger captives, whom he formed into an army and kept in a camp on the sea-coast, where they received instruction in military discipline *. From this they were removed to receive the charge of the royal person, and the superintendence of the officers of state. In a short time, these slaves became so numerous and so powerful that they were enabled to usurp the throne, having murdered Tiiran Shah, * Hence they were called the Baharite or Maritime Mamelukes, to dis tinguish them from the Borjite or Garrison Mamelukes, another body of this militia, formed by the Baharite sultan, Kelaun, to counterbalance the authority usurped by the Turkish emirs. The Borjites derived their name from the forts which they garrisoned ; they soon increased ifi power, and made the Baharite dynasty undergo the fate it inflicted on the Ayiibite sultans. They rose against their masters (a. d. 1382), gained possession of the supreme authority and placed one of their chiefs on the throne of Eg.vpt- The Borjites in their turn were overthrown by the Ottomans (a. d. 1517)."], [121, "107 REVOLUTIONS IN THE EAST. the son and successor of Saleh, who had vainly endeavoured to break the yoke which the Mamelukes had imposed upon their Sultan (a. d. 1250). This revolution took place in the presence of St. Louis, who had been taken prisoner at the battle of Mansurah, and had just concluded a truce for ten years with Turan Shah. The Mameluke insurgent, named at first regent or Atta-beg, was finally proclaimed Sultan of Egypt. The dominion of the Mamelukes over Egypt lasted for more than two centuries and a half. Their body, constantly recruited by Turkish and Circassian slaves, disposed of the throne at its pleasure ; the boldest of their chiefs, provided he could prove his descent from Turkestan, was chosen Sultan. Notwithstand ing the frequent wars and revolutions necessarily resulting from the licentiousness of military election, the Mamelukes made a successful resistance to the Mongols, and after the death of Jenghiz Khan's immediate heirs, conquered the kingdoms of Aleppo and Damascus, which the Mongolian Khans had taken from the Ayiibites (a. d. 1260). The surviving princes of the Ayiibite dynastry in Syria and Arabia tendered their submission to the Mamelukes, who were thus masters of all the ancient Saracenic possessions in the Levantine countries, with the excep tion of the few forts and cities which were still retained by the Franks and western Christians. The Mamelukes soon resolved to seize these last memorials of the crusades. They invaded the principalities of Antioch and Tripoli, which were subdued without much difficulty. A fierce resistance was made by the garrison of Acre, but the town was taken by assault and its gallant defenders put to the sword. Tyre soon after surrendered by capitulation (a. d. 1291), and thus the Christians were finally expelled from Syria and Palestine."], [122, "108 CHAPTER V.

Boni face VIIL, in the extravagance of his claims, surpassed all his predecessors. \" God,\" said he, in a celebrated bull*, \" has entrusted two swords to St. Peter and his successors, the one spiritual, and the other temporal.

A vast crowd from all parts of Christendom flocked to the pontifical city, and enriched its churches with offerings, and its private citizens by their liberal expenditure t. The claims of the pontiffs to supremacy over princes were not permitted to remain a dead letter; they intermeddled in all their quarrels, enjoined some to lay down their arms, received * Called, from the words with which it commences, \" Isnam Sanctum, &e.\" t According to the bull of Boniface VIIL, the jubilee was to be cele brated once only in every century ; but subsequent popes deemed a hundred years too long an interval between such lucrative festivals, and the period was reduced to fifty years by Clement VI., to thirty byUrban VI., and to twenty-five by Paul II. and Sixtus IV."], [123, "109 DECLINE of the PAPAL POWER. others under their protection, and commanded all to submit their differences for adjudication to the court of Rome. The very excess of such power was fatal to its duration ; many monarchs, among whom the English Edward III. stands conspicuous, began to revolt against the degrading yoke, and their efforts were seconded by the clergy, weary of a power that destroyed their independence, and taxed them with heavy impo sitions. Boniface VIIL himself was resisted by Philip the Fair, king of France, and his summons to that monarch to appear at Rome was treated with the contempt it merited. The irritated pontiff launched a bull of excommunication against the refractory monarch ; Philip convoked the estates of the realm, and found all the orders, but especially the commons, eager to maintain his dignity (a. d. 1303)*; he appealed to a general council, and was unanimously supported by his subjects. The example of the French was not lost upon the Germans ; the Emperor Louis of Bavaria, having incurred the hostility of the Holy See by his zeal in defending the prerogatives of his crown, had to encounter a long series of wars excited by the Popes John XXII. and Benedict XII. t Wearied by his incessant toils, he made the most humiliating concessions to obtain peace, but all his efforts were vain. Clement VI. sur passed even the preceding popes in violence ; his bull of excom munication against the emperor is unparalleled for blasphemous fury. \" May God,\" said the proud pontiff, \" visit Louis with idiotcy and madness ; may heaven overwhelm him with its thunders ; may the wrath of God, St. Peter, and St. Paul, crush him in this world, and that which is to come ; may the entire universe join in league against him ; may the earth open and * The kin\", thus supported, cared so little for ecclesiastical censures, that he sent Nogaret with an army into Italy : Nogaret, joined by Sciara Colonna, surprised the pope at Anagni, made him prisoner, and pillaged his treasures. -f Benedict XII. attempted to bring the Greek church under subjection, but received the following rebuke from the Constantinopolitan clergy (a. d. 1335). \" Thine uncontrollable power we firmly believe; thine excessive arrogance we cannot endure; thy boundless avarice we are unable to satisfy :\u2014 The devil be with thee, for God is with us !\""], [124, "110 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. swallow him alive; may his name perish in the first generation, and his memory be blotted out; may his children, delivered into the hands of their enemies, be destroyed in the sight of their father.\" Such extravagance disgusted all the princes and states of the empire ; a Diet was held at Frankfort (a. d. 1338), to take measures for repressing the usurped power of the popes ; and in this assembly it was enacted, that whoever was chosen sovereign by the free voice of the electors, should be held as truly emperor without the papal consent or coronation, and that whoever maintained the contrary, should be deemed guilty of high-treason. The translation of the papal see from Rome to Avignon was not less prejudicial to the power of the popes than the opposition which their extravagant pretensions provoked among princes. Clement V., elevated to the papacy by the influence of the French king, Philip the Fair, to gratify his patron, abstained from going to Rome, had the ceremony of his coronation per formed at Lyons, and fixed his residence at Avignon (a.d. 1309). Clement's successors continued to hold their court in this place, until Gregory XL, finding that their absence from a city long regarded as the sacred capital of Christendom, was seriously weakening the papal influence, and displeased by the concessions extorted from him by the powerful princes that surrounded Avignon, returned to Rome (a. d. 1376). The Italians called the residence of the popes at Avignon \" the Babylonish cap tivity,\" alluding not only to its duration of seventy years, but also to the loss of empire it occasioned. This absence from their proper metropolis was fatal also to the power of the popes in Rome itself, and the ecclesiastical states. Oppressed by factious nobles, preserving the memory of their ancient republican insti tutions, and the shadowy pride of a mighty name, the Roman citizens became impatient of the feeble rule of the papal dele gates, and instigated by Nicolas Gubrini, better known by the name of Rienzi, they revolted, and established a democratic constitution (a. d. 1347). Rienzi was placed at the head of the new republic, with the popular title of Tribune; he prepared a form of government which he named \" the good state,\" and tried to impose it on all the states and nobles of Italy by force"], [125, "111 DECLINE OF THE PAPAL POWER. of arms. His own arrogance, and the corrupt character of the Romans, demoralized by the misgovernment of centuries, frus trated this attempt to restore the Roman republic ; Rienzi was slain, and, after his death, the aristocracy re-established their tyranny in Rome and the ecclesiastical states; more than a century elapsed after the return of the popes to Italy before they could recover the power of which they had been deprived during their residence at Avignon. A still more fatal blow to the papal power was \" the great schism of the West,\" which, for fifty-one years, agitated the churches of Christendom. On the death of Gregory XL (a. d. 1378), the Italian cardinals elected a pope of their own nation, who took the name of Urban VI., and fixed his seat at Rome. The French cardinals, on the other hand, chose a rival pontiffj Clement VII., who established his court at Avignon. Christen dom was instantly divided into two parties, and the unity of the Church was threatened with annihilation. To Urban VI. succeeded, at Rome, Boniface IX., Innocent VII., and Gre gory XII., while Clement VII. had Benedict XIII. for his successor at Avignon. Some cardinals, wearied by these dis putes, detached themselves from both parties, convoked a council at Pisa (a. d. 1409), deposed the two popes, and con \u25a0 ferred the pontifical dignity on Alexander V., who was suc ceeded by John XXIII. This proceeding made matters worse; there were three rival pontiffs instead of two; each launched curses and excommunications against his competitors; each anxious to maintain his pontifical dignity, exacted heavy con tributions from the clergy subject to his authority. Under the auspices of the Emperor Sigismond, a general council was assembled at Constance (a.d. 1414). The council having voted its indissolubility, asserted its right, not only over the discipline, but the faith of the Church; it condemned to the flames John Huss and Jerome of Prague for having adopted the opinions of the celebrated English reformer, Wickliffe ; and it formed a committee to investigate the cause and nature of the abuses that had scandalized Christendom. Before the com mittee had prepared its report, a new pope, Martin V., was elected, to whom the three rival popes were forced to yield."], [126, "112 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. The projects of reform, begun at Constance, were revived at the council of Basle (a.d. 1431); but Eugenius IV., the suc cessor of Martin, soon felt that the proposed innovations would be fatal to the papal authority, and dissolved the council. This precipitancy caused another schism, which lasted ten years ; but at length the ex-duke of Savoy, who had been chosen pope by the partisans of the council, under the name of Felix V., gave in his submission ; and the council, from whose labours so much had been expected, ended by doing nothing. Still the convo cations of the prelates of Christendom at Constance and Basle struck a fatal blow against the despotism of the popes. Hence forth monarchs had, or seemed to have, a court of appeal, \u2014 one so dreaded by the pontiffs, that the mere dread of its convocation procured from them liberal concessions. But a new and more formidable enemy to the despotism of the pontiffs than the resistance of kings or of councils, was the progress of literature and knowledge, which brought the extravagant claims of spiritual and temporal rulers to be investigated on their real merits, not according to their asserted claims. Section II. \u2014 First Revival of Literature, and Inventions in Science. In the controversy between Philip the Fair and Boniface VIIL, literary talent was for the first time employed against the Church by John of Paris, a celebrated Dominican, who advo cated the royal independence with great zeal and considerable ability. The celebrated poet Dante Alighieri, who may be regarded as the founder of Italian literature, and almost of the Italian language, followed the same course, advocating strenu ously the cause of the Emperor Louis of Bavaria. Their example was a model for many other writers, who laid aside the shackles of authority, and supported the independence of states. But literature itself was subject to trammels which checked the progress of improvement. Aristotle's system of philosophy, not as originally formed by that great man, but modified in Arabian"], [127, "REVIVAL OF LITERATURE AND SCIENCE. 113 translations, and cumbered by scholastic refinements, was the only subject deemed worthy of attention. It was deemed a crime scarcely less than heresy, to doubt of any explanation given by the schoolmen of physical, mental, or moral pheno mena. Roger Bacon, a Franciscan monk, was the first who revived experimental science ; he made several important dis coveries in mechanics and chemistry, but his great merit is to he found, not so much in his various inventions and projects, as in the bold appeal which he made to experiment and the obser vation of nature. His lectures at Oxford, published under the title of \" Opus Majus\" (a.d. 1266), raised against him a host of enemies ; he was prohibited from giving instructions in the university, and was subjected to confinement in his convent. His scientific discoveries were deemed a species of magic in that age of ignorance ; he was the first of the long list of victims of ecclesiastical persecution, and the leader of a long line of patriots who supported the cause of intellectual and moral liberty against the odious encroachments of spiritual despotism. The emanci pation of literature accompanied that of science; the impulse which Dante had given to the cultivation of Italian poetry was long felt ; he was followed by Petrarch and Boccacio, whose writings at once elevated the character and formed the language of their countrymen. Several new inventions, or perhaps importations from the remote East, accelerated the progress of men in learning and the arts. Of these we may mention more particularly the art of forming paper from linen-rags, painting in oil, the art of printing, the use of gunpowder, and of the mariner's compass. Before the invention of linen-paper, parchment was generally used in Europe, both for copying books and preserving public records. This material was scarce and dear ; in consequence of its scarcity, the writing was often effaced from ancient manu scripts, and new matter written on the parchments. Some of the most valuable classical works were thus sacrificed to make room for idle legends of saints and trifling theological disserta tions. In some of these, called palimpsests, the old writing is faintly legible under that of the monks, and some important fragments have thus been recovered. When the Arabs con-"], [128, "114 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. quered Bokhara (a. d. 704), they are said to have found a large manufactory of cotton-paper at Samarcand, which is not impro bable, as the fabric was known in China before the Christian era. They brought the knowledge of the art into their western territories, but the scarcity of the materials long impeded its progress. At length, in the thirteenth century, it was dis covered that linen would answer all the purposes of cotton ; but when, where, or by whom this valuable discovery was made, cannot be ascertained. As flax and hemp are chiefly the growth of northern countries, the claim of the Germans to the invention seems better founded than that of the Italians ; the first great factory of linen-paper of which we have any certain accounts, was established at Nuremberg (a.d. 1390),' but there is reason to believe that paper was manufactured in western Europe a century earlier. The invention of painting in oils is usually attributed to two brothers, Van Eyck, of whom the younger, called John of Bruges, flourished towards the close of the thirteenth century. The invention, however, is of much earlier date, but the brothers deserve the merit of having brought it into practical use, and carried it to a high degree of perfection. Owing to this inven tion, modern paintings excel the ancients both in finish of execu tion and permanence. More important than either of those was the invention of printing, which seems to have been at least partially derived from the East. Solid blocks of wood, graven with pictures and legends, -were used in China from a very remote period. They were first introduced into Europe for the manufacture of playing cards, which became very popular about the close of the thir teenth century. The card manufacturers soon began to publish wood-cuts of remarkable persons and events in sacred history, or the Lives of the Saints, accompanied with brief descriptions graved on the block, and thus we find a species of stereotype printing in use before the discovery of moveable types. The great improvement of having separate types for each letter, was made by John Gutenberg, a citizen of Mayence (a. d. 1436) ; he used small blocks of wood, but the matrix for casting metal types was soon after devised by Peter Schoeffer, of Gemheim."], [129, "115 REVIVAL OF LITERATURE AND SCIENCE. Gutenberg established the first printing press known in Europe, at Strasburg; thence he removed to Mayence, where he entered into partnership with John Fust, or Faustus, whose ingenuity greatly contributed to perfect the invention. Gutenberg did not put his name to any of the books he printed ; Faustus, more ambitious of fame, placed his name and that of his partner to his celebrated Psalter, and thus received no small share of the glory that properly belonged to the first discoverer. The art of engraving on copper, was discovered about the same time as the use of moveable types, but its history is very obscure. Scarcely less important than printing was the manufacture and use of gunpowder. This invention includes several dis coveries which it is of importance to distinguish from each other : first, the discovery of the detonating power of saltpetre ; second, the process of uniting saltpetre with charcoal and sulphur, or the manufacture of gunpowder; third, the use of gunpowder in artificial fireworks ; fourth, its use as a projectile force, in throwing shot, &c; and fifth, its use in mines for blowing up walls, fortifications, &c. These discoveries were independent of each other, and took place at different times ; we must therefore consider them separately. The explosive power of saltpetre was probably known in the East from a very remote age, for that substance is produced abundantly, fit for use, both in India and China; and ancient traditions describe the repulses of invaders by launching artificial lightnings from walls, manifestly referring to the use of some detonating substance. With less certainty we may conjecture that the process of compounding saltpetre with other ingre dients, was brought from the remote East by the Saracens. Friar Bacon, the first European writer who describes the composition of gunpowder, derived his knowledge of chemistry chiefly from the Arabian writers, who were the originators of that science. Among the Chinese, the use of deflagrating compounds for artificial fireworks, is of very ancient date. The employment of gunpowder for throwing bullets and stones began in Europe about the commencement of the fourteenth century; it was introduced by the Saracens in their Spanish wars ; and the first certain account of this change in warfare, is"], [130, "116 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. in an Arabian history of the siege of Baza, by the king of Granada (a. d. 1312). It is generally supposed that the Genoese were the first who used powder in mines, to destroy walls and fortifications, at the siege of Seranessa (a. d. 1487). Bombs and mortars are said to have been invented by Mala testa, prince of Rimini (a. d. 1467) ; and about the same time guns, or rather portable cannons, began to be used by soldiers. Several circumstances prevented the immediate adoption of fire arms and artillery in war : long habit made many prefer their ancient weapons; the construction of cannons was imperfect, they were made more frequently of wood, leather, or iron hoops, than solid metal, and were therefore liable to burst ; the gun powder was of imperfect manufacture, and frequently failed in the field. Above all, the mail-clad chivalry of Europe opposed a change in the art of war which greatly lowered the value of knights and cavalry. They described the invention as murderous, inhuman, and treacherous ; they averred It was great pity, so it was, This villanous saltpetre should be digged Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed. The last great invention that requires notice is the polarity of the magnet, and its application to the mariner's compass. There are few European nations that have not at some time or other arrogated to themselves the merit of this discovery ; but few more successfully than the Italians, whose claims, until of late days, have been regarded as established. It was generally believed that the inventor of this precious instrument was Flavio Gioia, a native of Amalfi, in the kingdom of Naples; and so precise were the historians, that they specified the date of the invention as either a. d. 1302, or 1303. A more careful examination of the subject showed that the magnet's polarity had been noticed by Chinese, Arabian, and even European writers, long before the commencement of the fourteenth century, and hence it was fairly inferred that the Amalfitans could only claim the merit of introducing the invention into Europe, or at most of applying it to the purposes of navigation. Great obscurity continued to rest over the question, until the"], [131, "117 REVIVAL OF LITERATURE AND SCIENCE. attention of the late celebrated Orientalist, Klaproth, was directed to the subject. His work is so little known, that it will be interesting to extract from it some particulars respecting this interesting point in the history of human civilization. The time when the polarity of the magnet was first known to the Chinese is lost in the night of antiquity. But many centuries before the Christian era, this property of the loadstone was applied to the construction of magnetic chariots. In the front of these chariots, a doll, made of light materials, was fixed upon a pivot, a magnetic bar was passed through its extended arm, so contrived that it invariably pointed to the south, which was the hilleh, or sacred point, to which the Chinese always turned when performing their devotions. The original use of these chariots was merely to discover the kibleh, a purpose to which the mariner's compass is frequently applied among Mohammedan nations. It is obvious that the step from the magnetic chariot to the mariner's compass is not one of great difficulty; but it was probably not made until the Chinese began to direct their atten tion to navigation, under the Tsin dynasty, that is, between the middle of the third and the commencement of the fifth centuries of our era. The mode in which the magnet, or magnetized needle, was at first used by Oriental nations, is thus described by Ba'ilak, an Arabian writer of the thirteenth century : \" The captains that navigate the Syrian sea, when the night is so dark that they cannot see a star, by which they might determine the cardinal points, fill a vessel with water and shelter it from the wind. Then they take a needle, which they stick into a splinter of wood, or a reed in the form of a cross, and throw it upon the surface of the water. Afterwards they take a piece of loadstone, large enough to fill the hand, which they bring near the surface of the water, and then give the water a motion towards the right, by stirring it, so that the water begins to revolve. Then they suddenly withdraw their hands, and the needle certainly points north and south.\" This clumsy contrivance, called the \" water compass,\" was the first kind used both in Asia and Europe, and the Coreans had not abandoned it so late as the middle of the last century. We have no certain account of the"], [132, "118 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. introduction of the compass into Europe, but writers of the twelfth century, speaking of it, as far as we know for the first time, mention it as a thing generally known. From this sudden notoriety of the polarity of the magnet, it seems probable that its use had been practically known to sailors, before it engaged the attention of the learned. Only one century previous to this notoriety, we find that the northern navigators had no better expedient for directing their course, than watching the flight of birds. \"The old northern sailors,\" says a Danish chronicle, \" took a supply of ravens for their guides; they used to let these birds fly from their barks when in the open sea ; if the birds returned to the ship, the sailors concluded that there was no land in sight, but if they flew off, the vessels were steered in the direction of their flight.\" The improvements in the compass were made by slow degrees, and for the most important of them the world is indebted to Englishmen. Section III. \u2014 Progress of Commerce. From the beginning of the fourteenth to the middle of the fifteenth century, the commerce of Europe was engrossed by the Italian, Hanseatic, and Flemish cities. The Italians, but more especially the Florentines, Genoese, and Venetians, possessed the trade of the Levant. The Genoese exclusively monopolised the commerce of the Black Sea, while the Venetians traded to the ports of Syria and Egypt. The jealousy of the rival republics led to sanguinary wars, which ended in rendering the Venetians supreme in the Mediterranean. The manufacture of silk which had been introduced into Sicily from Greece, spread thence into various parts of Italy, but the largest factories were established at Venice. This city supplied the greater part of Europe with silks, spices, and Asiatic produce. Italian mer chants, commonly called Lombards, carried these goods into the northern and western kingdoms. The privileges and exemptions granted them by sovereigns, enabled them to rule the traffic of"], [133, "119 progress of commerce. Europe, and to become the chief bankers and money-dealers in its different states*. But all the Italian free cities did not enjoy equal prosperity. The states of Lombardy that had wrested their freedom from the German emperors, soon fell into anarchy. Disgusted with the advantages by which they knew not how to profit, some voluntarily resigned their liberties to new masters, while others yielded to usurpers. Thus the marquis of Este became lord of Modena and Reggia (a. d. 1336) ; the house of Gonzago gained possession of Mantua, and the Visconti took the title of dukes of Milan (a. d. 1395). Florence retained its freedom and pro sperity for a longer period. It was not until the reign of the emperor, Charles V. (a. d. 1530), that its republican form of government was abolished, and the supreme authority usurped by the princely family of the Medicis. The rivalry between the Genoese and Venetians led, as we have already mentioned, to long and deadly wars. The last and most memorable of these, was that called the war of Chiozza (a. d. 1379). The Genoese, after having gained a signal victory over the Venetian fleet, before Pola, in the Adriatic Sea, penetrated into the inmost lagoons of Venice, and seized the port of Chiozza. Had the Genoese acted with more promptitude, Venice itself might have been taken, its citizens, in the first moment of dismay, having resolved to quit their country, and seek refuge in Candia. The tardiness of the Genoese admiral afforded them time to recover their courage. Excited by a generous emulation, all classes vied with each other to repel the invaders; a new fleet was equipped in a very brief space, Chiozza was recovered, and the Genoese received so severe a check, that they were no longer able to contest the supremacy of the sea with their rivals. But these wars were not the only cause of the decline of Genoa; the streets of the city frequently streamed with the * The street in London where these foreigners were settled, still retains the name of Lombard-street, and continues to be the chief seat of banking establishments. It is not generally known that the three balls exhibited over pawnbrokers' shops, are the arms of Lombardy, and have been retained as a sign, ever since the Lombards were the sole money-lenders of Europe."], [134, "120 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. blood of rival factions; the nobles and commons fought for supremacy, which want of internal union prevented either party from maintaining; and at length, incapable of governing them selves, they sought the protection of foreign powers. With their usual inconstancy, the Genoese were ever changing masters ; twice they placed themselves under the king of France, but aftsr a short experience of French rule, took for their sovereign, first, the marquis of Montferrat, and afterwards the duke of Milan. From the year 1464, Genoa remained a dependency on the duchy of Milan, until 1528, when it recovered its former freedom. Whilst the power of the Genoese republic was declining, that of Venice was increasing by rapid strides. The permanence given to its government by introducing the principle of heredi tary aristocracy, saved the state from internal convulsions, while the judicious establishment of commercial stations, on the shores of the Adriatic and Levant, secured and fostered its trade. The greatest advantage that the Venetians obtained over their com mercial rivals, arose from their treaty with the sultan of Egypt (a. d. 1343) ; by this alliance, the republic obtained full liberty of trade in the Syrian and Egyptian ports, with the privilege of having consular establishments at Alexandria and Damascus. These advantages soon enabled them to acquire supreme com mand over the trade of central and southern Asia ; the spices and other commodities of India were brought to Syrian markets, and the Genoese establishments on the Black Sea soon became worthless. The territorial acquisitions of the republic on the northern coasts of the Adriatic, formed a powerful state about the middle of the fifteenth century. Dalmaz and Friuli were wrested from the king of Hungary, and the most important districts of eastern Lombardy conquered from the dukes of Milan. But the power of the republic was less secure than it appeared; oppressive to its dependencies, it provoked hostile feelings, which only waited for an opportunity to blaze forth in open rebellion ; insolent to all the surrounding powers, a secret jealousy and enmity were excited, which, at no distant date, exposed Venice to the resentments of a league too powerful to be resisted. We have already mentioned the Hanseatic confederation of"], [135, "121 PROGRESS OF COMMERCE. the commercial cities in northern and western Europe, to protect their trade from pirates and robbers. In the fourteenth century, the league became so extensive as to form an important power, that claimed and received the respect of kings and emperors. The maritime cities of Germany, from the Scheldt and the isles of Zealand, all round to the borders of Livonia, joined the confederacy, and several cities in the interior sought its protec tion, and admission into its alliance. The first known act of confederation was signed by the deputies of the several cities at Cologne (a. d. 1364). All the allied cities were divided into four circles, whose limits and capitals varied at different periods ; the general administration of the confederacy was entrusted to a confederacy which assembled triennially at Lubeck. In the early part of the fifteenth century, no less than eighty cities sent delegates to the congress, while many others were connected with the league, though they had not the power of sending delegates. Possessing the exclusive commerce of the Baltic sea, the Hanse towns exercised the right of making war and peace, and forming alliances ; they equipped powerful fleets and waged successful wars with the northern sovereigns that attempted to interfere with their monopoly, or limit the privileges extorted from the ignorance or weakness of their predecessors. The Hanseatic ships exported from the north seas, hemp, flax, timber, furs, leather, copper, corn, and the produce of their fisheries. Herrings, which were at that time taken in great abundance on the Norwegian coast, formed one of their most lucrative articles of commerce, on account of the strictness with which Lent was observed by the southern nations of Europe. The produce of the north was exchanged in the western markets for cloths, stuffs, wines, drugs, and spices. The principal marts were Bruges for the Flemish countries, London for England, Bergen for Norway, and Novogorod for Russia. In the close of the fifteenth century, Novogorod was deprived of its republican constitution, and the merchants migrated to Narva and Revel. Through the Flemings the Hanseatic commercial cities were brought into connexion with those of Italy ; the merchants of both met in the fairs and markets of Bruges, where the produce of the unexplored North was exchanged for that of the unknown G"], [136, "122 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. regions of India. The progress of trade, and the intercourse thus effected between remote nations, excited a love for maritime and inland discovery, which soon produced important changes, and aided the other causes that necessarily led to the overthrow of the confederation. Extensive as was the commerce of the Hanseatic cities, it possessed neither permanence nor durability. Having neither produce nor manufactures of their own, the merchants had merely a carrying trade, and the profits of simple barter ; con sequently the progress of industry, especially in countries where the useful arts were cultivated, raised powerful rivals against them, and gave commerce a new direction. The establishment of stable governments was also injurious to a confederation, whose chief utility was to afford protection against the piracy of northern adventurers and the robbery of turbulent feudal lords. When the limits of imperial and feudatory power were finally determined, the German princes gradually acquired the com manding influence that necessarily results from territorial possessions, and recovered their supremacy over the cities that had been withdrawn from their authority. This result was hastened by the internal dissensions of the confederate cities. Situated at considerable distances from each other, their interests often clashed, and the congress, occupied in reconciling disputes, could never direct its attention to any plan for colonial or territorial acquisition ; still less could they form a systematic union of mercantile establishments in which the gain of one necessarily ensured the loss of the other. When the northern sovereigns, enlightened on the advantages that their subjects might derive from commerce, assailed the privileges of the Hanse towns by force of arms, many of the southern cities withdrew themselves from the league and the northern con federates, thus deserted, were unable to preserve their mor opoly of the Baltic trade, which they were forced to share with the merchants of England and Holland. The confederacy thus gradually declined, until in the seventeenth century, this league, once so extensive, included only the cities of Hamburgh, Lubeck and Bremen. The prosperity of the Flemish towns was fixed on a more"], [137, "123 PROGRESS OF COMMERCE. secure basis than that of the Hanseatic cities, for their com mercial success was the result of their manufacturing industry, in which the}- far surpassed the rest of Europe. Their textile fabrics of wool, cotton, and silk, their tapestry, and their embroidery, supplied the principal nations of Christendom, who purchased these commodities with raw materials. The wealth, the population, and the resources of these cities, raised their sovereigns to the first rank among potentates. Bruges was long the capital and chief mart of Flemish commerce ; it preserved its rank to the close of the fifteenth century, when the superiority was transferred to Antwerp. But intestine wars and political revolutions proved ruinous to the supremacy of the Low Countries ; many of the Flemish manufacturers fled to England, whither they had been invited by Edward III. ; under the patronage of that politic monarch, they established woollen factories in various parts of the country, which soon attained such eminence that they rivalled the best products of the looms of Flanders. At an earlier period, the Hollanders having discovered an improved mode of salting and curing herrings, beo-an to compete with the Flemings in the fish trade ; and the subsequent opening of the Texel made Amsterdam the chief seat of this branch of industry. Section IV. \u2014 Revolutions of Germany, France, and Spain. From the period of the accession of Rodolph, the first emperor of the house of Hapsburgh, the German empire began to assume a constitutional form, and to be consolidated by new laws. Under the government of Albert, the son of Rodolph, an important change took place in Switzerland, which, at the com mencement of the fourteenth century, was divided into a number of states, both secular and ecclesiastical. The cantons of Uri, Schwitz, and Underwalden, were immediate dependencies of the empire, while some minor adjoining districts belonged to the dukes of Austria as counts of Hapsburgh. Albert, anxious to found a new kingdom for one of his younger children, resolved G 2"], [138, "124 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. to annex the imperial to the Austrian cantons ; and in order to reconcile the hardy mountaineers that inhabited them to the intended yoke, he sanctioned and encouraged the cruel tyranny of their German governors. Three brave men resolved to attempt the delivery of their country ; they secretly engaged a number of partisans, who surprised the imperial forts on the same day (a. d. 1308), and accomplished a revolution without shedding a drop of blood. The Austrians made a vigorous effort to recover their supremacy, but they suffered a ruinous defeat at Morgarten (a. d. 1315), which secured the independ ence of the Cantons. Their league of union was renewed at Brunnen in a treaty that became the base of the federative union of Switzerland. Five other cantons successively joined the former three, and the Helvetic possessions of the house of Austria were conquered by the Swiss during the interval in which the family of the counts of Hapsburgh ceased to wear the imperial crown. On the death of Albert (a. d. 1308), Henry VII., count of Luxemburg, was chosen emperor ; he was a brave and politic prince ; taking advantage of the pope's absence at Avignon, and the distracted state of Italy, he made a vigorous effort to restore the imperial authority in the peninsula, and would probably have succeeded but for his premature death. The troubled reign of the emperor Louis of Bavaria, his contest for the empire with Frederic, duke of Austria, and the wars occasioned by his efforts to restrain the extravagant pre tensions of the popes, led the German princes to discover the necessity of having a written constitution. On the accession of Charles of Luxemburg (a. d. 1347), the calamities of a disputed election to the empire were renewed, and after a long series of wars and disorders, a diet was convened at Nuremberg, to form a code of laws, regulating the rights and privileges of the spiritual and temporal authorities. The result of the diet's labours was published in a celebrated edict, called the Golden Bull, from the bulla, or seal of gold, affixed to the document (a. d. 1356). This bull fixed the order and form of the imperial elections, and the ceremonial of the coronation. It ordained that the crown should be given by the plurality of"], [139, "125 REVOLUTIONS OF GERMANY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN. votes of seven electors; the prince chosen emperor having a right to give his suffrage. The right of voting was restricted to the possessors of seven principalities, called electorates, of which the partition was prohibited, and the regularity of their inheritance secured by a strict law of primogeniture. Finally, the Golden Bull defined the rights and privileges of the several electors, confirming to the princes of the Palatinate and Saxony the administration of the empire during an interregnum. The next reign, nevertheless, evinced the danger of investing the electors with such preponderating authority. Wenceslaus, the son and successor of Charles, was a supine and voluptuous prince, who paid little attention to the interests of the empire ; he was deposed by a plurality of votes (a. d. 1400), and Robert, the elector palatine, chosen in his stead. Several of the states continued to acknowledge Wenceslaus, but Robert is usually regarded as the legitimate emperor. On Robert's death, the empire returned to the house of Luxemburg, Wenceslaus having consented to resign his pretensions in favour of his brother Sigismund, king of Hungary. A cloud had long hung over the house of Hapsburgh ; it was dispelled by the fortunate union of Albert, duke of Austria, with Sigismund's only daughter, queen in her own right of Hungary and Bohemia. On the death of his father-in-law (a. d. 1437), he succeeded to the empire, but survived his elevation only two years. Albert's posthumous son Ladislaus inherited his mother's realms ; his cousin Frederic, duke of Stiria, was chosen emperor, and from his posterity the imperial dignity never departed until the extinction of his male issue (a. d. 1740). The wise policy of Philip Augustus, in weakening the power of the feudal aristocracy and re-uniting the great fiefs to the crown, was vigorously pursued by his successors, but by none more effectually than Philip the Fair. On the death of that monarch (a. d. 1314), the king of France was undoubtedly the most powerful sovereign in Europe. Philip left three sons, who successively reigned in France ; Louis, surnamed Hutin, Philip the Long, and Charles the Fair; together with a daughter named Isabel, married to Edward II., king of England. The"], [140, "126 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. three French sovereigns just mentioned, died without leaving male issue ; all had daughters, but Philip and Charles asserted that no female could inherit the crown of France. The claims founded on this law of succession were but slightly questioned ; and on the death of Charles IV., Philip, Count de Valois, the nearest male heir, ascended the throne without encountering any immediate opposition (a.d. 1328). Edward III. of England resolved to claim the kingdom in right of his mother Isabel, but the distractions of his native dominions long presented insuperable obstacles to his projects. He even did liege homage to Philip for the province of Guienne, and for several years gave no sign of meditating such a mighty enterprise as the conquest of France. Aided by his son, the celebrated Black Prince, the English monarch invaded France, and, contrary to the opinions of all the cotemporary princes, was everywhere victorious (a. d. 1338). The war was maintained by Philip of Valois, and his son and successor John, with more obstinacy than wisdom ; the former suffered a terrible defeat at Crecy, the most glorious field ever won by English valour ; King John was taken prisoner at the battle of Poictiers. But these achievements, however glorious, could not ensure the conquest of France, the country was too large, the French nation too hostile to the invaders, and Edward's army too small for such a revolution. Both sides became weary of the contest, a treaty was concluded at Bretigni, by which several important provinces were ceded to Edward, on the condition of his renouncing his claims to the French crown (a.d. 1360). A troubled period of eight years followed, which can scarcely be called a peace, although there was a cessation from open hostilities. There is scarcely a calamity by which a nation can be afflicted that did not visit France during this disastrous season. A foreign enemy was in the heart of the kingdom ; the seditions of the capital deluged its streets with blood ; and a treacherous prince of the blood, Charles the Bad, king of Navarre, was in arms against the sovereign authority. Famine devastated the land, and a plague of unparalleled virulence (a. d. 1348) con summated the work of hunger and the sword. The companies of adventurers and mercenary troops that remained unemployed"], [141, "127 REVOLUTIONS OF GERMANY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN. during the truce that followed the victory of Poictiers, spread themselves over the land, in marauding troops, which there was no force to withstand. So little scrupulous were they, that they assailed the pope in Avignon, and compelled the pontiff to redeem himself by a ransom of forty thousand crowns. Finally, the peasantry of several districts, impatient of distress, and maddened by the oppressions of their lords, broke out into a fearful insurrection. This was named the Jacquerie, from the contemptuous phrase, \" Jacques bon homme,\" applied by the nobles to their serfs, and it was marked by all the horrors that necessarily attend a servile war, when men brutalized by tyranny, and maddened by wrongs, seek vengeance on their oppressors. Edward, the Black Prince, was entrusted by his father with the o-overnment of the French provinces. A brave and adven turous warrior, Edward was deficient in the qualities of a statesman. Having exhausted his finances by an unwise and fruitless invasion of Castile, he laid heavy taxes on his subjects, and they in anger appealed for protection to their ancient sovereions. Charles V., who had succeeded his father John on the throne of France, gladly received this appeal, and summoned Edward to appear before him as his liege lord (a. d. 1368). Though enfeebled by sickness, the answer of the gallant prince to this summons was a declaration of war, but the tide of fortune was changed, and in a few campaigns the English lost all their acquisitions in France, with the exception of a few important sea-ports. The weakness of Richard II., and the doubtful title of Henry IV., prevented the English from renewing the war with France durino- their reigns ; indeed they would probably have been expelled from all their continental possessions, but for the deplorable imbecility of the French monarch, Charles VI., and the sanguinary contests of the factions of Orleans and Burgundy. The English nation had been long commercially connected with Flanders, and when that country was annexed to the duchy of Buro-undy, provision had been made for the continuance of trade by separate truces. Encouraged by the promised neutrality, if not the active co-operation of the Burgundian duke, Henry V. invaded France, and destroyed the flower of the French chivalry"], [142, "128 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. on the memorable field of Agincourt (a. d. 1415). The progress of the English was uninterrupted until the defection of the duke of Burgundy (a.d. 1419), an event which seemed to threaten Henry with ruin ; but that prince having been assassinated, his partisans in revenge joined the English, and this circumstance, combined with the unnatural hatred of the French Queen Isabel to her son the Dauphin, led to the treaty of Troyes, by which Henry, on condition of marrying the Princess Catherine, was appointed regent of France, and heir to the unconscious Charles VI. Notwithstanding this arrangement, Charles VII. on the death of his father, was recognised as king in the southern provinces of France, while Henry VI., the infant inheritor of the crowns of England and France, was proclaimed, in the northern pro vinces, under the reign of his uncle, the Duke of Bedford (a. d. 1422). At first the fortunes of Charles wore the most unfavourable appearance ; and the siege of Orleans (a. d. 1428) threatened to deprive him of hope. A simple country girl overthrew the power of England. Joan of Arc, called also the Maid of Orleans, whether influenced by enthusiasm or imposture, it is not easy to determine, declared herself supernaturally inspired to undertake the deliverance of her country. The English felt a superstitious awe, and lost their conquests one by one, and after a protracted but feeble struggle, no memorial of the victories of Edward and Henry remained but the town of Calais and an empty title (a. d. 1449). The destruction of the French nobility in this long series of wars, enabled Charles VII. to mould the government into a despotic form, which was permanently fixed by his crafty successor Louis XL Scarcely a less important change was made in ecclesiastical affairs ; Charles VII. secured the Gallican Church from any future encroachments of the Holy See, by adopting several decrees of the council of Basil, which were solemnly recognised in a national assembly held at Bourges (a. d. 1438), and published under the name of the Pragmatic Sanction. Spain, during this period, continued to be divided into several kingdoms; the Christian monarchies of Navarre, Castile, and Arragon, could not be brought to combine against the Moors,"], [143, "129 REVOLUTIONS OF GERMANY, FRANCE, AND SPAIN. whose strength was concentrated in the province of Granada. Alphonso XI. was the only Castilian monarch who distinguished himself in war against the Mohammedans; he defeated the combined forces of the kings of Morocco and Granada, who had united to besiege Tariffa (a. d. 1340), and by this victory, not only delivered his own frontiers, but acquired several important fortresses. The power of Castile was weakened by the unex ampled tyranny of Peter the Cruel. He was dethroned by his illegitimate brother, Henry, count of Trastamarc, but was sub sequently restored by Edward the Black Prince. Proving ungrateful to his benefactor, he provoked a second contest, in which he lost his kingdom aud life. The kingdom now passed to the house of Trastamare (a. d. 1368), and for a considerable period enjoyed peace and prosperity. Though the kingdom of Arragon was inferior in extent to that of Castile, yet the advantages of a better government, and wiser sovereign, with those of industry and commerce, along a line of sea-coast, rendered it almost equally important. The Arragonese kings acquired the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Balearic islands, Sardinia, and the county of Barcelona, with several other Catalonian districts. They would probably have struggled for the supremacy of Spain, had not the crowns of Arragon and Castile been united by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella (a. d. 1469). A similar event had nearly united the crowns of Castile and Portugal. Ferdinand, king of Portugal, having no male heirs, wished to secure the succession for his daughter Beatrice, and married her, at the early age of eleven, to John I. king of Castile. On the death of Ferdinand, his illegitimate brother, Don Juan, commonly called John the Bastard, profiting by the national hatred between the Portuguese and Castilians, usurped the regency. A fierce war ensued, the Castilians were overthrown in the decisive battle of Aljubarota (a. d. 1385), and John was proclaimed king by the states of Portugal. The war was con tinued for several years, but finally a treaty was concluded, by which the Castilian monarchs resigned all claim to the inherit ance of Beatrice."], [144, "130 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. Section V. \u2014 The State of England and the Northern Kingdoms in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries. Tue inglorious reign of Edward II. in England was not on the whole unfavourable to the progress of constitutional liberty. After the weakness of the king and profligacy of his favourites had for four years disgusted the nations, the barons compelled the monarch to grant a reform of abuses in full parliament (a.d. 1311). The Great Charter was renewed, and a fresh clause added, of too much importance to be omitted even in this scanty page : \u2014 \" Forasmuch as many people be aggrieved by the king's ministers against right, in respect to which grievances no one can recover without a common parliament ; we do ordain that the king shall hold a parliament once in the year, or twice, if need be.\" But this security against misgovernment proved inefficacious, the monarch was deposed, and soon after murdered (a.d. 1327). Edward III. was proclaimed king; and during his minority, the administration was entrusted to Queen Isabella. After the lapse of three years, Isabella, who had disgraced herself by a criminal intrigue with Mortimer, earl of March, was stripped of power, and her paramour beheaded. Edward III. rendered his reign illustrious, not more by his splendid achievements in France, than by the wise laws he sanctioned in England. These, perhaps, must be ascribed less to the wisdom of the sovereign than the increasing spirit of the commons. It was during this long and prosperous reign that parliament established the three fundamental principles of our government, \u2014 the illegality of raising money without the con sent of parliament ; \u2014 the necessity of both houses concurring in any alteration of the laws ; \u2014 and the right of the commons to investigate public abuses, and impeach the royal ministers for mal-administration. While in the midst of victory, able to boast of his queen having conquered and captured the king of Scotland, and of his son having taken the king of France prisoner, Edward found his parliaments well-disposed to second all his efforts, and gratify all his wishes ; but, when the tide of fortune turned, he had to encounter the hostility of a constitu-"], [145, "131 ENGLAND AND TUE NORTHERN KINGDOMS. tional opposition, at the head of which appeared the prince of Wales. On the death of the heroic Black Prince, the royal favourite, the duke of Lancaster became supreme in parliament, but the fruits of the victories acquired by the patriots were not lost, the statute law of the realm was improved, the administra tion of justice improved, and the great security of ministerial responsibility established. English literature began to assume a settled form ; Chaucer, the greatest poet that modern Europe had produced, with the exception of Dante, flourished in the time of Edward ; and the language had become so far perfect, that it was resolved to have all laws written in English, instead of the Norman French, which had been used since the time of the conquest. Richard II., son of the Black Prince, succeeded his grandfather (a. d. 1377), ere he had attained his twelfth year. The early part of his reign was troubled by the contests of his ambitious uncles for the regency, and by a dangerous insurrection of the peasants, headed by the celebrated blacksmith, Wat Tyler. About the same time, the zeal with which Wickliffe denounced the corruptions of the church, provoked the hostility of the clergy; his doctrines were condemned by a national synod (a. d. 1382), but they had taken fast hold of the people, and some of his desciples carried them to the continent, more especially into Bohemia, where they continued to flourish in spite of persecution. The continued misgovernment of Richard provoked a revolution, while he was absent in Ireland. Henry of Lancaster, duke of Hereford, enraged at the forfeiture of his paternal estate, headed the revolt ; Richard, on his return, finding the royal cause hopeless, surrendered to his haughty cousin, and was forced to abdicate the crown (a. d. 1399). The throne thus vacated, was claimed by Henry, as repre sentative of the duke of Lancaster, the third son of Edward III. but the hereditary right belonged to Edmund Mortimer, carl of March, the lineal descendant of Lionel, duke of Clarence, second son of Edward III. The Mortimer claim, at a later period, was vested by marriage in the family of York, descended from the fourth son of Edward. Henry of Lancaster, however, was the idol of the people, and the master of the parliament; his"], [146, "132 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. demand passed without question, and the first acts of his reign were well calculated to make the nation acquiesce in his title. The efforts of some discontented nobles to restore Richard, were crushed by the spontaneous exertions of the populace, and the death of the deposed monarch seemed to secure tranquillity. But the fourth Henry found that discontented friends were the most dangerous enemies ; the proud Percies, to whom he owed his elevation, dissatisfied with the scanty reward of their services, took up arms, and involved the country in civil war. The Percies were overthrown at Shrewsbury (a. d. 1403), but their Welsh ally, Owen Glendower, maintained a stern resist ance to the house of Lancaster for several years. On the death of Henry IV., his son, Henry of Monmouth, ascended the throne (a. d. 1413). His dissipation in youth gave little promise of a glorious reign, but immediately after his accession, he resigned all his follies, and having secured the tranquillity of England by judicious measures of reform, he revived the claims of Edward to the throne of France. The glorious battle of Agincourt left him master of the open field, the crimes and follies of the French court gave him possession of Paris ; he died in the midst of victory (a. d. 1422), leaving a son only nine months old to inherit his kingdoms. The early part of Henry VI.'s reign is occupied by the series of wars that ended in the expulsion of the English from their continental possessions. The loss of trophies so gratifying to popular vanity, alienated the affections of the nation from the house of Lancaster, and this dislike was increased by the haughtiness of Henry's queen, Margaret of Anjou, and the ambition of unprincipled favourites. Richard, duke of York, sure of succeeding to the crown, would probably not have asserted the claims of his house, but for the unexpected birth of a prince, on whose legitimacy some suspicion was thrown. Encouraged by many powerful nobles, he took up arms ; the cognizance of the Yorkists was a white rose, that of the Lan castrians, a red rose, and the fierce contests that ensued are usually called the \" wars of the roses.\" After a sanguinary struggle, marked by many vicissitudes of fortune, the white rose triumphed, and Edward IV., son of Richard, duke of York,"], [147, "133 ENGLAND AND THE NORTHERN KINGDOMS. became king of England (a. d. 1461). Ten years afterwards, his triumph was completed, and his rights secured, by the battle of Tewkesbury, in which the Lancastrians were decisively over thrown. Edward's reign was sullied by cruelty and debauchery; after his death (a. d. 1483), the crown was usurped by Richard, duke of Gloucester, who endeavoured to secure himself by the murder of his nephews. But the claims of the Lancastrian family were now revived by Henry Tudor, earl of Richmond, the heir to that house by right of his mother, and a proposal, favoured by the principal nobles, was made for uniting this nobleman in marriage to the princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV., and thus for ever extinguishing the hostility between the rival houses. At the decisive battle of Bosworth field, Richard was defeated and slain (a. d. 1485) ; Henry became king of England, and his marriage with Elizabeth united the rival claims of York and Lancaster in the Tudor family. The wars excited by disputed successions in Scotland, were terminated by the transfer of the crown to the family of the Stuarts (a.d. 1371)- Under this dynasty, the royal authority, which had been almost annihilated by the nobles, was greatly extended, and judicious laws enacted for restraining the tur bulence of the aristocracy. Intestine wars long harassed the northern kingdoms, but their tranquillity was restored by Queen Margaret, commonly called the Semiramis of the North, who united Denmark, Norway, and Sweden into one state, by the treaty of Calmar (a. d. 1397). The predilection shown by Margaret's successors for their Danish subjects, displeased the Swedes, and on the death of King Christopher, without issue, they separated from the union, and chose Charles VIIL, one of their native nobles, to be their sovereign. The Danes conferred their crown on Christian I., count of Oldenberg (a. d. 1450), and it has ever since continued in his family. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Russia was divided into several principalities, all of which were under the Mongolian yoke, while the western provinces had the additional misery of being ravaged by the Poles and Lithuanians. A"], [148, "134 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. diversion in their favour was made by the Teutonic knights, who added several rich provinces to their Prussian dominions, but the oppressive government of the order provoked insur rections, of which the Poles took advantage, not only to regain their former provinces, but also to acquire a considerable portion of Prussia, which was ceded to them by the peace of Thorn (a.d. 1466). A great revolution in the Polish form of govern ment roused the martial enthusiasm, but proved fatal to the tranquillity of the Poles. Casimir the Great, having no male issue, wished for secure the succession to his nephew, Louis, king of Hungary, and convoked a general assembly of the states (a. d. 1339). The nobles, to whom an appeal was thus made, took advantage of the circumstance to render the throne elective, and to place great restrictions on the royal authority. When Louis of Hungary became king of Poland (a. d. 1370), he was obliged to swear fealty to a constitution which changed the monarchy into a republican aristocracy. On his death, the crown of Poland was given to Jagellon, duke of Lithuania (a. d. 1382), who renounced paganism on his election, and established the Christian religion in his hereditary estates. Though the crown continued elective, the Polish kings were always chosen from the Jagellon family, until its extinction in the sixteenth century. Section VI. \u2014 Rise and Progress of the Ottoman Empire. Under the administration of the Pal\u00e6ologi, the Byzantine empire sunk into hopeless decay; its history presents an un varied picture of vice and folly ; the weakness of the sovereigns, the exorbitant power of the patriarchs and monks, the fury of theological controversy, the multiplication of schisms and sects, would have ruined the state, but for the external pressure of the Mohammedan dynasties; while, on the other hand, the triumph of these enemies was delayed by the revolutions in the sultanies of Anatolia, and the difficulties that the sieo-e of a maritime capital presents to hordes ignorant of navigation. But"], [149, "135 rise and progress of the ottoman empire. when the power of the Ottoman Turks became consolidated, it was manifest that the fate of Constantinople could not be averted, though its fall was long delayed. The power of the Ottoman Turks commenced in Asia Minor; when the Mongolian hordes overthrew the Seljukian dynasties, a small wandering tribe of Turks sought refuge in Armenia, but after seven years of exile, seized what they deemed a favourable opportunity of returning to their ancient possessions. While fording the Euphrates, the leader of the Turks was drowned, and the tribe was divided into four, by his sons. Ertoghrul, the warlike leader of one division, resolved to return into Asia Minor : the sultanies into which the Seljukian empire had been divided, were harassing each other with mutual wars, and could not be persuaded to combine against cither the Mongols or the crusaders, and consequently a band of adventurous warriors might reasonably hope to obtain fame and fortune in such a distracted country. During Ertoghrul's retrograde march, he met two armies engaged in mortal combat, and without giving himself the trouble of investigating the cause, he took the chivalrous resolution of joining the weaker party. Llis unex pected aid changed the fortunes of the day, and he was rewarded by the conqueror, who proved to be a chief of the Seljukians, with the gift of a mountainous district, forming the frontiers of ancient Bithynia and Phrygia. Othman, or Ottoman, usually regarded as the founder of the Turkish empire (born a. d. 1258), succeeded his father Ertoghrul at an early aoe. He was fortunate in winning the friendship of a younor Greek, who embraced Islamism to please his patron, and instructed the Turkish prince in the art of government. From this renegade descended the family of Mikal-ogli*, which so often appears conspicuous in Turkish history. To the infor mation obtained from this Greek, Othman owed the supremacy which he speedily acquired over his Seljukian rivals t; aided by * Sons of Michael. + The Turkish historians, with true Oriental taste, cannot be satisfied with so simple an explanation, and they attribute all Othman's success to a dream. This celebrated vision, which every Turk learns by rote, from his"], [150, "136 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. the surrounding emirs, he wrested several important places from the Byzantine empire, particularly Prusa, the ancient capital of Bithynia, which under the slightly altered name of Briisa, became his metropolis (a. d. 1327). The new kingdom thus formed at the expense of the sultans of Iconium and the Greek emperors, increased rapidly, and soon became one of the most flourishing states in the East. Orkhan, the son and successor of Othman, instituted the military force of the Janissaries, to which the Turks owe the chief part of their success. Having greatly enlarged his dominions, he took the title of sultan, and began to expel the Greeks from Anatolia. While Orkhan pursued his victorious career in Asia, his son Soliman crossed the Hellespont (a. d. childhood, possesses too much historical importance to be omitted. It is only necessary to premise, that Othman was at the time visiting a sheikh, named Edebali, with whose daughter he was in love, but had not at first been able to gain the sheikh's consent. \" He dreamed that he was reposing on the same couch as his host ; suddenly the moon seemed to emerge from Edebali's person, and after having attained wondrous size and splen dour, to enter his own breast. Instantly, there sprung from his loins an immense tree, rapidly acquiring fresh size and foliage, until its branches shaded Europe, Asia, and Africa. Beneath this tree, the mountains of Caucasus, Atlas, and H\u00e6mus raised their snowy summits, and seemed to be the columns that supported this leafy tent. From the roots of the tree, sprung the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Nile, and the Danube, whose waters were almost hidden by forests of masts. Yellow harvests covered the plains, waving woods crowned the hills and mountains, countless rivulets meandered through groves and gardens, Through the vistas of the valleys, were seen cities adorned with domes, cupolas, towers, obelisks, and columns. The crescent gleamed from every spire, and on every minaret was heard the voice of the muezzin, summoning the faithful to prayer; the sound mingling with the notes of countless nightingales, and the chattering of millions of parrots, whose gay plumage exhibited all the colours of the rain bow. These birds sported gaily through the immense mass of foliage, and seemed not to fear the leaves, though they were long, pointed, and glittering, like sabres. Suddenly, a wind arose, and directed the points of all these sabre-like leaves towards the principal cities of the universe, but especially towards Constantinople, which, placed at the junction of two seas, and two continents, resembled a noble diamond, set between two sapphire stones and two emeralds, forming the precious jewel of the ring of a vast dominion, that circled the entire world; a ring destined to grace the finger of Othman, as soon as he woke.\""], [151, "137 RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. 1358), captured Gallipoli, and thus laid the first foundation of the Turkish power in Europe. Amurath, or Morad L, steadily pursued the policy of his father and brother. Lie captured Adrianople (a.d. 1360), which he made his capital. He subdued Thrace, Macedon, and Servia, but fell at the battle of Cossova, one of the most sanguinary ever fought between Turks and Christians. Bayezid, surnamed Ilderim, or the Thunderer, put an end to all the petty Turkish sovereignties in Asia Minor ; he subdued Bulgaria, and maintained his conquest by the decisive victory that he gained at Nicopolis over Sigismond, king of Hungary. The pride, the cruelty, and the bravery of Bayezid have been celebrated in history and romance. Southern Greece, the countries along the Danube, and the western districts of Thrace, submitted to his arms; the empire of Constantinople was bounded by the walls of the city, even this was held blockaded for ten years, and must eventually have fallen, had not Bayezid's attention been directed to Asia, by the rapid successes of a con queror, more savage than himself. Timur Lenk, that is to say, \"lame Timur,\" a name commonly corrupted into Tamerlane, was the son of a Jagatay Turk, who ruled a horde, nominally subject to the descendants of Jenghiz Khan. His amazing strength, exhibited even in early infancy, procured him the name of Timur, which signifies \" iron.\" While yet a youth, he resolved to deliver his country from the Mongolian yoke, but at the same time, aware of the high value placed upon illustrious birth, he pretended to be descended from JeDohiz, and on this account he is frequently called Timiir the Tartar, and this error was perpetuated in India, where his descendants, the emperors of Delhi, have been denominated the Great Moouls. He was as indefatigable a student as he was a warrior. His published works prove that he was deeply read in the Koran, and its most approved commentaries, and that he was familiar with Persian literature, and the Mongolian tra ditions and laws. On account of his literary acquisitions, he is a great favourite with the Oriental writers ; \" he knew,\" they say, \" how to rule the world he had subdued ; while other conquerors left no trace of their empire, he imprinted a character"], [152, "138 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. on many succeeding generations.\" His empire was rapidly extended from the wall of China to the Mediterranean Sea ; India in the south, and Russia in the north, acknowledged his sway, and his determination to wrest Syria and Anatolia from the Turks, compelled Bayezid to abandon the siege of Con stantinople, and hasten to the defence of his Asiatic dominions (a. d. 1403). Before he could reach the scene of action, Sivas (the ancient Sebaste) had fallen, and the bravest warriors of the garrison had been buried alive by the ferocious victor. Damascus soon after shared the same fate ; it was laid waste by fire and sword, and a solitary tower alone remained to mark the spot that had once been a city. Bayezid encountered Timur in the plains of Angora; he was defeated with great loss, and taken prisoner. The Turkish historians assert that Bayezid was confined by the conqueror in an iron cage, but Timur's own companion and historian asserts that the conqueror treated his captive with great lenity; all that can be determined with certainty is, that the sultan died in his enemy's camp. Timiir himself fell a victim to disease, while preparing to invade China (a. d. 1405); his empire was dismem bered after his death, but Baber, one of his descendants, established an empire at Delhi, in Northern India (a. d. 1389), which, sadly shorn of its ancient glories, subsisted almost to our own times, under the name of the empire of the Great Moguls. After a long fratricidal war, Mohammed I., the youngest of Bayezid's sons, succeeded to his father's dominions. The greater part of his reign was spent in restoring the Ottoman power in western Asia, and thus the Byzantines obtained a respite, by which they knew not how to profit. Morad, or Amurath II., raised the glory of the Ottomans to a height greater than it had yet attained. He deprived the Greeks of all their cities and castles on the Euxine Sea, and along the coasts of Thrace, Macedon, and Thessaly ; he even stormed the fortifications that had been constructed across the Corinthian isthmus, and carried his victorious arms into the midst of the Peleponnesus. The Grecian emperors acknowledged him as their superior lord, and he, in turn, accorded them protection. Two Christian heroes arrested the progress of the sultan, John Hunniades, and George"], [153, "139 RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. Castriot, better known by the name of Scanderbeg. Hunniades was a celebrated Hungarian general ; he drove the Turks from Servia, whose possession they eagerly coveted, and long impeded their progress westwards. Scanderbeg was an Albanian prince, possessing a small district in the Epirote mountains, of which Croia was the capital. At the head of a small but faithful band of followers, he long resisted the mighty armies of the Ottomans, and compelled Amurath himself to raise the siege of Croia. At length Mohammed II. ascended the Ottoman throne (a. d. 1451), and from the moment of his accession, directed all his efforts to the capture of Constantinople. At the head of an army of three hundred thousand men, supported by a fleet of three hundred sail, he laid siege to this celebrated metropolis, and encouraged his men by spreading reports of prophecies and prodigies, that portended the triumph of Islamism. Constan tine, the last of the Greek emperors, met the storm with becoming resolution; supported by the Genoese, and a scanty band of volunteers from western Europe, he maintained the city for fifty-three days, though the fanaticism of his enemies was raised to the highest pitch by their confident reliance on the favour of heaven, while prophecies of impending woe and desolation proportionally depressed the inhabitants of Constan tinople. At length, on the 29th of May, a. d. 1453, the Turks stormed the walls, the last Constantine fell as he boldly dis puted every inch of ground, multitudes of his subjects were massacred in the first burst of Turkish fury, the rest were dragged into slavery, and, when Mohammed made his triumphal entry, he found the city a vast solitude. A shade of melan choly mingled with the pride of victory, he vented his feelings in a quotation from the Persian poet Sadi, \u2014 The spider spreads the hangings of the palace of C\u00e6sar, The owl relieves the sentry on the towers of Afrasuib. The conquest of Constantinople was followed by that of Servia, Bosnia, Albania, Greece, including the Peloponnesus, several islands of the Archipelago, and the Greek empire of Trebizond. All Christendom was filled with alarm ; Pope"], [154, "140 PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION AND INVENTION. Pius II. convened a council at Mantua, for the purpose of orga nizing a general association to resist the progress of the Turks (a. d. 1459). A crusade was preached by his order, and he was about to undertake the command of the expedition in person, when death cut short his projects at Ancona (a. d. 1464). The Christian league was dissolved by his death, the Turks were permitted to establish their empire in Europe, and this received a great increase both of security and strength by the voluntary tender of allegiance which the khans of the Crimea made to Mohammed II. (a.d. 1478). After the first burst of fanaticism was over, Mohammed granted protection to his Chris tian subjects, and, by his wise measures, Constantinople was restored to its former prosperity."], [155, "141 CHAPTER VI. THE REFORMATION, AND COMMENCEMENT OF THE STATES-SYSTEM IN EUROPE. Section I. \u2014 Progress of Maritime Discovery. The impulse which the cultivation of ancient learning had received in Europe was greatly strengthened by the downfall of Constantinople, which drove the most learned Greeks into exile ; they sought refuge for the most part in Italy, and the libraries of that peninsula became the depositories of what remained of the ancient treasures of Greek literature and philo sophy. It was hence that' the first stimulus was given to the study of the Greek language in Europe. Translators of the Greek authors, and commentators upon them, began to multiply; and the rapid progress of the art of printing gave an additional impulse by the facilities it afforded for the dissemination of learning. The belief that there existed a fourth division of the globe, larger than any yet discovered, had been encouraged by some of the ancient philosophers ; and it had been so generally received, that two eminent fathers of the Church, St. Augustine and Lactantius, had zealously laboured to refute the theory, believing it inconsistent with the doctrines of Christianity. With the cultivation of Greek literature the old notion was revived, and at the same time the rapid development of the spirit of maritime discovery induced several nations, but espe cially the Portuguese, to search out new and unknown lands. The Canaries, or Fortunate Islands, were the first discovery that followed the introduction of the mariner's compass ; they became known to the Spaniards early in the fourteenth century, but no regular attempt was made for their colonization. Various circumstances prompted the Portuguese to exert their energies in maritime affairs; after the expulsion of the Moors, they engaged in fierce wars with the Mohammedan states of Africa,"], [156, "142 TnE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. and thus kept alive the martial and adventurous spirit of the nation. A large armament was prepared at Lisbon (a. d. 1412), to attack the Moors settled on the coast of Barbary, and a few vessels were at the same time ordered to sail along the western coast of Africa, to discover the unknown countries situated on the Atlantic Ocean. The success of this expedition, though very partial, induced Prince Henry, the fourth son of the reio-nino- monarch, John I., to devote his entire attention to the extension of these discoveries. He fixed his residence near Cape St. Vincent, whence he sent forth several expeditions; the valuable island of Madeira was discovered (a. d. 1419), but it was long before the navigators ventured within the tropics, and refuted the opinion that the torrid zone was uninhabitable from excessive heat. The passion for discovery languished after the death of Prince Henry, but it was revived by his grand-nephew, King John II., with additional ardour (a.d. 1481). In his reign, the Portu guese, for the first time, crossed the equator, and for the first time beheld the stars of a new hemisphere. They now dis covered the error of the ancients respecting the torrid zone, and practically refuted the common belief that the continent of Africa widened towards the south, for they beheld it sensibly contracting and bending towards the east. The hopes inspired by this discovery, induced the Portuguese monarch to send ambassadors in search of an unknown potentate supposed to profess the Christian religion, by whose aid, it was hoped, that a lucrative trade might be opened with India, and the progress of the true faith secured. Early in the thirteenth century, reports were prevalent in Europe of some great potentate in a remote part of Asia having embraced the Christian faith *. In consequence, the pope, Innocent IV., sent two monks to preach Christianity in the Mongolian court (a.d. 1246); and soon after, St. Louis of France employed the celebrated Rubruquis to seek the aid of * It is probable that this error arose from some inaccurate description of Buddhism.

A Venetian, named Marco Polo, visited the most distant parts of Asia (a. d. 1263), and penetrated to Pekin, the capital of China. He was followed by- Sir John Mandevile, an Englishman (a. d. 1322), and the narrations of both, though deficient in accuracy of information, contributed to keep alive the feelings of interest and curiosity which had been excited in Europe. While the Portuguese monarch's emissaries were engaged in a hopeless search for Prester John, and the more useful task of investigating the state of navigation in the Indian seas, an expedition from Lisbon, conducted by Bartholomew Diaz, had actually discovered the southern extremity of the African continent (a. d. 1483). A storm preventing him from pursuing his career, he named the promontory that terminated his voyage \"the Cape of Tempests;\" but King John, aware of the vast importance of the discovery, called it \" the Cape of Good Hope.\" At the same time letters were received from the monks who had been sent overland, in which the practicability of reaching the East Indies, by sailing round Africa, was strenuously main tained. But the intervening discovery of America diverted, for a season, men's minds from this voyage round Africa; and fifteen years had nearly elapsed before Vasco de Gama, having rounded the Cape of Good Hope, reached India, and anchored in the harbour of Calicut, on the coast of Malabar (May 22nd, a. d. 1498). Among the adventurers who flocked to join the Portuguese from every part of Europe was Christopher Colon, or Columbus, a native of Genoa. The narrative of Marco Polo had led to the belief that the extent of India, beyond the Ganges, was greater than that of the rest of Asia; and, as the spherical figure of the earth was known, he was naturaUy led to the conclusion that India might more easily be reached by sailing westwards, than by the long and tedious circumnavigation of Africa. Columbus made proposals successively to the republic of Genoa, the king of Portugal, and the king of England, but was mortified to find that his plans were regarded as visionary. Finally, he applied to the Spanish court, then rising rapidly"], [158, "THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM IN EUROPE. 144 into importance in consequence of the union of the crowns of Arragon and Castile, by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isa bella. After enduring many disappointments, Columbus obtained a small armament through the favour of the queen ; and, on the 3rd of August, a. d. 1492, sailed from the little port of Palos, in Andalusia, to discover a New World. During the long voyage, the crew of Columbus was more than once on the point of mutinying and turning back in despair; at length land was discovered on the 12th of October, and Columbus found himself soon in the midst of that cluster of islands, which, in consequence of the original error about the extent of India, were named the West Indies. On his return to Europe, he was received by Ferdinand and Isabella with the highest honours ; a second expedition was prepared to extend and secure his discoveries, but, before its departure, application was made to the pope for a grant of these new dominions, and Alexander VI. shared all the unknown regions of the earth inha bited by infidels between the Spaniards and Portuguese, fixing as their common boundary an imaginary line drawn from pole to pole, one hundred leagues to the west of the Azores, and assign ing all west of that line to Spain, and all east of it to Portugal. Columbus continued to extend his discoveries after his return to the New World, but he was destined to experience the ingratitude of Spain, and the injustice of mankind. The sug gestions of envious courtiers caused him to be sent to Europe a prisoner and in fetters; the new continent, instead of being called after the first discoverer, derived its appellation from Americo Vespuccio, who visited the southern part in company with a Spanish captain, and gave his name to the countries that he depicted on his chart. The Spaniards conquered the islands and the countries of America as fast as they discovered them. Excited by the thirst of gold, which the New World offered them in abundance, they were guilty of the most shocking cruelties that ever disgraced humanity. Millions of the unfortunate natives were massacred or drowned ; those who were spared were compelled to work for their savage masters in the mines : and, to supply this drain of the population, negroes were imported from the coast of"], [159, "145 PROGRESS OF MARITIME DISCOVERY. Africa, and the execrable slave-trade firmly established. The principal conquests of the Spaniards in America were made during the reign of the emperor Charles V. It was in his reign that Cortez, with a mere handful of followers, subdued the great empire of Mexico (a.d. 1521), whose last sovereigns, Montezuma and Guatimozin, were put to death with cruel tortures. Peru was conquered by Pizarro, its last monarch, Atabalipa, put to death, and in both countries the massacres of the natives were equally ruthless and desolating. The colonies established by the Spaniards differed from those founded by other European countries. The Spaniards were not a trading people, indeed ignorance of the advantages that result from commerce has been always a characteristic of that nation ; the precious metals were the only objects that excited their attention, and for a long series of years they devoted themselves exclusively to the exploration of mines. It was only when the augmentation of the European population, and the diminished returns from the mines, forced their attention to agriculture v that they began to pay any attention to raising colonial produce. In consequence of these restricted views, the commercial and colonial policy of Spain was always the worst possible ; it, was fettered by monopolies, exclusions, and restrictions, equally injurious to the parent state and its dependencies ; and perse verance in this erroneous system is a principal cause of the low state of civilization both in Spain and its late colonies. The success of the Portuguese in India, though not so bril liant, was scarcely less important than that of the Spaniards in America. Albuquerque conquered Goa (a. d. 1511), and made it the capital of the Portuguese establishments in the East ; the leao-ues of the Mohammedan princes for the expulsion of the Christians from India were defeated, and the Molucca islands brought under subjection. But the Portuguese generally abstained from territorial acquisition; they contented them selves with commercial establishments along the coast, whence they exported from India direct, the articles which the Venetians had formerly supplied to Europe through Egypt and the Levant. This event made a complete revolution in the commercial con dition of Europe ; the trade which had been confined to the u"], [160, "146 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. Mediterranean now traversed the Atlantic, and the western nations hasted to share in its gains. With characteristic indo lence, the Portuguese carried the Indian produce no farther than Lisbon, where it was sold to foreign merchants for transmission to other countries. The Dutch engaged very eagerly in this carrying trade, and found it so lucrative, that they took the earliest opportunity of excluding the Portuguese themselves from all share in their commerce by depriving them of their colonies. Not only the Dutch, but the English and French, were roused to emulation by the success of the Spaniards and Portuguese. In the reign of Henry VII., Cabot, a mariner of Bristol, made some considerable additions to maritime knowledge ; but it was not until the time of Elizabeth that regular plans of colonization were formed. Sir Walter Raleigh founded the first English colony, Virginia (a. d. 1584), in North America ; and, in the following reigns, the number of these establishments was greatly increased by the multitudes whom religious disputes, and the intolerance of the Stuarts, drove from England to seek \" free dom to worship God\" in the wilds of America. The Canadas, and the West Indian islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe, were colonized by the French ; but many circumstances combined to prevent the progress of French colonization, and the Dutch and English may be considered as the only rivals and successors of the Spaniards and Portuguese. The growth of commerce in this age was very rapid, but there appeared still room for further discoveries until the \"lobe was circumnavigated by Magellan (a. d. 1521 ). From that time the attention of nations began to be directed more to com pleting old discoveries than to the search for new lands. The navies of Europe began to assume a formidable aspect ; manu factures multiplied, and states, previously poor, became sud denly rich. Sovereigns and governments began to direct their attention to commerce, justly persuaded that mercantile wealth is equally the source of the prosperity and glory of nations."], [161, "ORIGIN OF THE REFORMATION. 147 Section II. \u2014 Origin of the Reformation. The extravagant claims of the popes to temporal, as well as spiritual supremacy, had been early resisted by several men of learning, whose works did not die with them, but continued to exercise a powerful, though secret effect on succeeding genera tions. This repugnance to ecclesiastical domination was greatly increased by the scandalous schism at the close of the fourteenth and commencement of the fifteenth century. Two or three popes reigning at the same time, excommunicating each other, appealing to the laity for support, compelled men to exercise the right of private judgment, and directed attention to the ecclesiastical abuses that had produced such unhappy fruits. The partial reforms, or rather attempts at reformation, made by the councils of Constance and Basil, spread the disrespect for the Romish See still wider; their deposition of contending pontiffs taught men that there was a jurisdiction in the Church superior to the papal power, their feeble efforts to correct abuse brouoht the evils prominently forward, and left them unamended to meet the public gaze. While this dissatisfaction was hourly increasing, the papal chair was filled successively by two pontiffs, whose career\" of unscrupulous guilt was sufficient to diso-ust even a less enlightened age. Alexander VI., profligate in private life, cruel and tyrannical in his public administration, was followed by Julius II., whose overbearing ambition led him to trample on the very semblance of justice and moderation when they interfered with the success of his schemes. The sovereigns of France aud Germany, alternately engaged in active hostilities with these heads of the Church, could not prevent their subjects from ridiculing papal pretensions, and assailing papal vices. Nor were these scandals confined to the papacy ; the licentious lives of the ecclesiastics in Italy and Germany, the facility with which they obtained pardons for enormous crimes their exorbitant wealth, their personal immunities, and their encroachments on the rights of the laity, had given just offence \u25a0 and this was the more sensibly felt in Germany, because most of the great benefices were in the hands of foreigners. H 2"], [162, "148 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. When men's minds were everywhere filled with disgust at the existing administration of ecclesiastical affairs, and eager for some change, a dispute, trivial in its origin, kindled a flame, which rapidly spread over Europe, destroying all the strongholds that had been so laboriously erected for the security of tyranny and superstition. Leo X., on his accession to the papal chair, found the treasury of the Church exhausted by the ambitious projects of his predecessors, Alexander VI. and Julius II. Generous in his disposition, magnificent in his habits of life, eager for the aggrandisement of his family, the princely Medicis, he could not practise the economy necessary to recruit his finances, and he therefore had recourse to every device that his ingenuity could suggest to raise money for the splendid desions he contemplated. Among these he introduced an extensive sale of indulgences, which often had proved a source of large profits to the Church. In the early ages of the Church persons guilty of any scanda lous crime were compelled to make a public acknowledgement of their sins, and do penance in presence of the cono-reo-ation. Sorrow and repentance were enjoined as their duty to God, the open expression of both was deemed a proper satisfaction to the society on which they had brought scandal. In process of time the custom arose of making this confession to the priest in private, and this change was followed by a practice of purchasing the remission of the penance for a sum of money. Indulgences as these remissions were called, at their first institution, were merely granted to absolve men from the satisfaction which the Church, like every other community, had a right to demand from its member, but they pretended not to avert the spiritual consequences of their guilt. As ecclesiastical usurpations pro ceeded, the prelates began to confound the remission of the temporal penance with that of the spiritual guilt ; and it was asserted that indulgences not only reconciled sinners to the Church but to God. The purposes for which they were granted contributed to the spread of this error ; they were rriven as a recompense to those who served in the Holy Wars, then to those who employed soldiers for that purpose, and finally to such as contributed to any pious work recommended by the pope."], [163, "149 ORIGIN OF THE REFORMATION. Julius II. had bestowed indulgences on all who contributed to the building of the Church of St. Peter's at Rome. Leo, with his characteristic love of splendour and the arts, eager to complete that expensive and magnificent work, resolved to commence the sale of indulgences on an extravagant scale, and to secure a good market in Germany, made Albert, archbishop of Magde burg, his agent, and granted him a share in the profits. Albert employed Tetzel, a Dominican monk, to manage the lucrative traffic ; and he, assisted by the monks of his order, diffused his wares with so little decency or discretion, that they excited murmurs from all but the grossly ignorant. Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar, whom his extensive knowledge of theology, and, what was rare in that day, his intimate acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures, had raised from an humble situation to a professors chair in the University of Wittemberg, was the first to resist the extravagant, or rather the blasphemous preten sions of Tetzei's indulgences*; he inveighed against them from the pulpit; he published ninety -five theses, examining their claims, which spread rapidly through Germany; and he won many converts among the nobles and princes, who were grieved to see large quantities of money drained from their own country to be expended on works of art in Italy. Leo X. at first regarded this controversy as a mere dispute between the Augustinian and Dominican friars, for a monopoly * The following is the form of absolution used by Tetzel : \u2014 \" May our Lord Jesus Christ have mercy upon thee, and absolve thee by all the merits of his most holy passion ; and I, by his authority, that of his blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of the most holy Pope, granted and com mitted to me in these parts, do absolve thee first from all ecclesiastical censures in whatever manner they have been incurred, and then from all thy sins, transgressions, and excesses, how enormous soever they may be, even from such as are reserved for the cognizance of the Holy See : and as far as the keys of the holy Church extend, I remit to you all punishment which you deserve in purgatory on their account ; and I restore you to the holy sacraments of the Church, to the unity of the faithful, and to that innocence and purity which you possessed at baptism ; so that when you die, the gates of punishment shall be shut, and the gates of the paradise of delight shall be opened ; and if you shall not die at present, this grace shall remain in full force when you are at the point of death. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\""], [164, "150 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. of the sale of indulgences ; but, alarmed by the accounts he received of the diminished demand for these wares, he summoned Luther to appear before his tribunal in Rome, but was subse quently persuaded to send Cardinal Cajetan into Germany to hear and decide the cause. Cajetan found Luther more obstinate than he had expected ; having vainly endeavoured to produce a change in his sentiments, he pronounced sentence against him, upon which Luther boldly appealed to a general council. No longer confining his attacks to indulgences, Martin Luther assailed the divine origin of the papal authority, and the Romish See no longer believing it necessary to temporize, published a bull of excommunication, denouncing Luther's opinions, excom municating him as an obstinate heretic, and requiring all secular princes to seize his person, that he might be punished as he deserved (a. d. 1520). This sentence produced the very opposite effect to that which had been expected. Luther burned the bull publicly in Wittemberg, his partisans prevented its publication in the principal cities of Germany, and his example had already incited Zuinglius to commence a similar career of reformation in Switzerland. The writings of both these reformers were spread by the press into the remotest parts of Europe, and were gladly received by many nations weary of ecclesiastical rapacity and oppression. John Calvin, another reformer, was a follower of Zuinglius ; he was a native of Noyon, in Picardy, and began first to publish his opinions at Paris (a. d. 1532). Driven from thence by the persecutions of the French clergy, he removed to Strasburoh, where he soon rendered himself so eminent by his talents as a writer and a preacher, that the name of Calvinists was given to that section of the refonned congregations which had at first ljeen named Zuinglians. The rapid progress of the new doctrines was attempted to be checked by the diet of Spires (a. d. 1529), where a decree was promulgated, forbidding any innovation until the assemblino- of a general council. Luther's friends and followers protested against this decree, and hence the professors of the reformed religion received the common name of Protestants. Soon after wards they presented a general confession of their faith to the"], [165, "151 ORIGIN OF THE REFORMATION. emperor at Augsburgh ; but unfortunately this celebrated docu ment showed that there were irreconcilable differences between the Calvinistic and Lutheran sections of the reformers. As the struggle, once begun, was maintained with great obstinacy, it soon led to serious political convulsions. Flalf of Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Prussia, and Livonia, adopted the doctrines of Luther, as taught in the confession of Augsburgh. England, Scotland, Holland, and Switzerland, embraced the tenets of Zuinglius and Calvin ; while efforts to establish similar principles were made in France, Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland. The means taken to end the controversy only aggravated the evil. \u25a0 It was proposed that the entire matter of dispute should be submitted to a general council, but it was impossible to deter mine the basis on which it should be convoked. After much delay, a council was assembled at Trent (a. d. 1545), whose sittings were continued, with some interruption, for several years; but when at the close (a.d. 1563), its decrees were published, they were rejected, not only by the protestants, but by many catholic princes, especially the king of France, as subversive of the independence of national Churches, and destructive of the lawful authority of sovereigns. Section III. \u2014 History of the Negociations and Wars respecting Italy. In the midst of the civil and ecclesiastical changes produced by the progress of intelligence, a system of policy for regulating the external relations of states was gradually formed, and attention, beoan to be paid to what was called the Balance of Power ; that is, the arrangement of the European states in such a system that the weak might be protected from the aggressions of the powerful and the ambitious. This system first began in Italy, which was divided into a number of petty states : its chief members were the duchy of Milan, and the republic of Venice, in the north ; the republic of Florence, and the states of the Church, in"], [166, "152 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. the centre ; and the kingdom of Naples, in the south. Encou raged by the distracted condition of the peninsula, foreigners were induced to attempt its conquest ; and the kings of France and Spain, and the emperors of Germany, made this country the battle-field of rival ambition. Louis XL, by a long course of cruelty and cunning, had restored the royal authority in France to a height that it had not attained since the days of Charlemagne. His great rival, Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, had fallen in an unjust war that he had undertaken against the Swiss (a. d. 1477), and with him fell the power of a house that rivalled, and even surpassed, many royal potentates in wealth and power. By the extinction of the House of Anjou, Louis XL acquired the impor tant county of Provence (a. d. 1481), and the claims of that house on the throne of Naples. But Louis, instead of wasting his forces on such a distant object, seized the greater part of the dominions of the Burgundian dukes, in defiance of the rights of the Princess Mary, who had married Maximilian, duke of Austria and emperor of Germany. Of the rich dowry which he claimed, Maximilian could only secure possession of Flanders ; Louis retained firm hold of the rest, which were confirmed to him by the treaties of Arras and Senlis. This unjustifiable usurpation of Louis XL laid the foundation of the bitter hostility between the Austrian and French dynasties, which has so often disturbed the peace of Europe. Charles VIIL departed from his father's prudent line of policy; instead of securing the royal authority at home, he directed his attention to foreign conquests, and resolved to assert his imagi nary claims to the throne of Naples. He was instigated also by the invitations of Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan, and by some *omantic hope of overthrowing the Turkish empire. A French army crossed the Alps (a. d. 1494), and marched through the peninsula without encountering any effective opposition. Rome, Florence, and Naples, submitted to the conqueror, and Ferdinand II. fled to the island of Ischia. But during the progress of the expedition, a league was formed for the expulsion of all forei oners from Italy ; the Venetian republic was the moving power of the confederacy, in which the pope and even Sforza were associated,"], [167, "153 NEGOCIATIONS AND WARS RESPECTING ITALY. while the Emperor Maximilian, and Ferdinand of Spain, secretly favoured its designs. Alarmed by the coming danger, Charles, leaving half his army to protect his conquests, led the remainder back to France. He encountered the Venetians on his road, and gained a complete victory ; but the forces he left in Italy were compelled to capitulate, and Ferdinand II. was restored to the throne of Naples. Charles VIIL was bent on vengeance, and the distracted state of the peninsula gave him hope of success ; but before he could complete his arrangements for a second expedition, he was snatched away by a sudden death (a. d. 1498). The duke of Orleans, Louis XII., in addition to his cousin's claims on Naples, inherited from his grandmother a title to the duchy of Milan. But the French monarch, before undertaking such an extensive conquest, deemed it necessary to strengthen himself by alliances with the republic of Venice, Pope Alexander VI. and Ferdinand, kino- of Spain. Thus strengthened, he found little difficulty in overrunning Italy ; Milan was captured (a. d. 1499), and the turbulent Sforza, after vain attempts to re-establish his power, died in captivity. Naples was next attacked; Ferdinand of Spain had entered into alliance with the Neapolitan monarch Frederic ; and his invader, Louis, secretly determined to cheat both. By his aid the kingdom of Naples was subdued, and the dupe Frederic imprisoned for life (a. d. 1501); but no sooner was the conquest completed, than the Spaniard prepared to secure the whole of the spoil. Aided by the abilities of' Gonsalvo de Cordova, Ferdinand succeeded in expelling the- French from Naples ; and the kingdom was finally confirmed to him on his marriage with Germaine de Foix, niece of Louis XII., with whom the French monarch, on the receipt of a million of ducats, assigned over his claims on Naples as a dowry (a.d. 1505). Italy, however, was soon destined to have its tranquillity disturbed by the grasping ambition of Pope Julius II. Anxious to recover the dependencies of the Holy See which had been seized by Venice, he organized a confederacy against that republic, of which he was himself the head; while Louis, Maximilian, and Ferdinand, were active members (a. d. 1509). H3"], [168, "154 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. The republic would have been ruined had the union of the confederates been sincere and permanent; but, owing to the mutual jealousies of its enemies, it escaped when brought to the verge of destruction. The impetuous valour of the French disconcerted all the measures the Venetians had taken to preserve their territories ; and the total ruin of their army at Aguadello (a. d. 1509), left them wholly without defence. Julius seized all the towns which they held in the ecclesiastical territories : Ferdinand added all their sea-ports in Apulia to his Neapolitan dominions ; but at the moment when the dismemberment of the republic seemed inevitable, the mutual jealousies of Louis and Maximilian dissolved the confederacy. The Venetians appeased the pope and Ferdinand, by large concessions, which were the more readily accepted, as Julius had now formed the design of expelling all foreigners from Italy, especially the French, of whose valour and ambition he was justly afraid. From the fragments of the leagne of Cambray, a new and stronger confederacy was formed against France, and Henry VIIL, who had just ascended the throne of England, was engaged to divert the attention of Louis from Italy, by an invasion of his dominions (a.d. 1511). The master-stroke, however, of the pope's policy was winning over the Swiss, whose mercenary infantry was the best body of troops then used in war. Louis XII. resisted all the efforts of this formidable conspiracy with undaunted fortitude. Hostilities were carried on during several campaigns in Italy, on the frontiers of Spain, and in Picardy, with alternate success. But weakened by the loss of his allies, Florence and Navarre, of which the former having been subjected to the Medicis, joined the league (a. d. 1512), and the latter was conquered and annexed to Spain, Louis would probably have been reduced to great distress, had not the death of Pope Julius (a. d. 1513) come to his relief. Leo, of the princely house of the Medicis, succeeded to the papacy, and immediately made peace with France. Spain, England, and the empire, followed this example, and the war terminated with the loss of everything which the French had acquired in Italy, except the castle of Milan and a few inconsiderable towns in that duchy."], [169, "155 THE AGE OF CHARLES V. Section IV.\u2014 The Age of Charles V. The political idea of maintaining a balance of power which was first formed in Italy, began to spread north of the Alps, in consequence of the rapid and overwhelming increase of the Austrian power. Maximilian of Austria, son of the emperor Frederic III., married Mary of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy (a. d. 1477), and in her right obtained possession of the fertile and wealthy provinces of the Netherlands. His son, Philip the Fair, was united to Joanna, infanta of Spain, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, whose union had joined the kingdoms of Arragon and Castile. The fruit of Philip's marriage with Joanna was two sons, Charles and Ferdinand ; and the elder of these, at the age of sixteen, inherited the crown of Spain and its colonies, in addition to his paternal dominions in the Netherlands (a. d. 1516). The death of his grandfather Maximilian transmitted to him the Austrian territories, and the other domains of the house of Hapsburgh, and the electors chose him to fill the vacant throne of the empire. Thus Charles, the first of Spain, and the fifth of the empire, possessed greater power than any sovereign that had flourished in Europe since the days of Charlemagne. In the beginning of his reign, he resigned his hereditary dominions in Germany to his brother Ferdinand, who afterwards succeeded him in the empire, and became the founder of the second Austrian line of emperors, which ended with Charles VI. (a. d. 1740). From the emperor Charles descended the Austrian family of Spanish kings, which was terminated by the death of Charles II. (a. d. 1700). These two branches of the Austrian house, the German and the Spanish, long acted in concert to secure reciprocal advant ages, and were fortunate in strengthening their power by new alliances. Ferdinand married Anne, sister of Louis, king of Hungary and Bohemia; and when that monarch fell in war against the Turks, added both these kingdoms to the hereditary dominions of Austria. Charles V., by his marriage with Isabella, daughter of Emmanuel, king of Portugal, prepared the way for his son Philip's annexation of that country to Spain."], [170, "156 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. Two monarchs, cotemporary with Charles, were almost equally bound by their interests to check the preponderance of the house of Austria, Henry VIIL of England, and Francis I. of France. Henry VII., after the victory of Bosworth field had given him undisputed possession of the crown, laboured diligently and successfully to extend the royal authority and to raise the commercial prosperity of the nation. On his death (a. d. 1509) he bequeathed to his son a rich treasury and a flourishing kingdom. Possessing such advantages, Henry VIIL might have been the arbitrator of Europe, but his naturally fine talents were perverted by flattery; he allowed free scope to all his passions, and his actions were consequently the result of caprice, vanity, or resentment, rarely, if ever, of enlightened policy. Many of the defects in his administration must, however, be ascribed to the pride and ambition of his prime minister, Cardinal Wolsey, who sacrificed the welfare of England and the honour of his sovereign to further his private ends or gratify his idle vanity. Francis I. was a prince of higher character ; he had many of the noble qualities, and not a few of the faults, usually ascribed to the spirit of chivalry ; bold, enterprising, and personally brave, he did not always regulate his actions by prudence, and his rashness lost what his valour had won. Soon after coming to the crown, he undertook to recover Milan, and overthrew Sforza and the imperialists at Marignano. The defeated duke resigned his country for a pension ; the pope and the northern Italian states assented to the arrangement, and the possession of the contested duchy seemed secured to France by the conclusion of a treaty with the Swiss cantons (a. d. 1516). Nearly at the same time a treaty was made with Charles, who had not yet succeeded to the empire, which seemed to establish peace, but only rendered war more certain. Henry and Francis were both candidates with Charles for the empire ; the former, however, had no rational hopes of success, while Francis could not hide his anticipations of success no more than his mortification when he failed. The mutual jealousies of the French and Spanish monarchs were aggravated by hostile claims; Charles, by right of descent, could demand the ancient"], [171, "157 THE AGE OF CHARLES V. possessions of the duke of Burgundy, and he was feudal sovereign, as emperor, over the northern Italian states, the chief duchy of which had been recently annexed to France. On the other hand, Francis had claims to the thrones of Navarre and Naples, which he was very unwilling to resign. Peace could not long subsist between these potentates, neither were their forces so unequally matched as might at first be supposed. The extensive dominions of Charles were governed by different constitutions ; in none, not even in Spain, was he wholly unfettered, while Germany, where the Reformation was con stantly raising embarrassing questions, and the princes ever anxious to circumscribe the imperial authority, added more to his nominal than to his real strength. His finances were also embarrassed, and he often found it an almost insuperable difficulty to provide for the payment of his troops, most of whom were necessarily mercenaries. On the other hand, Francis inherited almost despotic authority ; his power concentrated, his own subjects were enrolled as his soldiers, and the regular organization of the French government freed him from the financial embarrassments of his rival. Both strengthened them selves by alliances ; Charles gained the aid of the pope, and won Henry ATIII. to his side by duping the egregious vanity of Wolsey ; Francis, on the other hand, was supported by the Swiss and the Venetians. The war began nearly at the same moment in Navarre, the Netherlands, and Lombardy. The treachery of the queen-mother, who withheld from the French commander, Lautrec, the money necessary to pay the troops employed in Italy, led to the loss of Milan and the greater part of the duchy. Ah effort made to recover the lost ground led to the battle of Bicocca (a. d. 1522), in which the French were totally defeated and finally expelled from Italy ; and Genoa, their most faithful ally, was subjected to the power of their enemies. An event of scarcely less importance was the death of Leo, and the elevation of Adrian, a devoted adherent of Charles, to the papal chair ; and this was soon followed by the desertion of the Venetians to the imperial side. Francis might have still recovered the Milanese, where the emperor's troops had been disbanded for want of pay, had not"], [172, "158 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. the queen-mother, blinded by passion, induced him to treat the Constable of Bourbon with such gross injustice, that this power ful noble entered into a secret intrigue with the emperor, and agreed to raise the standard of revolt. The discovery of the plot delayed the French king's march into Italy; and though he protected his own territories, the Milanese was irrecoverably lost. Encouraged by this success, Charles commanded the imperial generals to invade France on the side of Provence, while the king of England promised to attack it on the north. Had this plan been executed, Francis must have been ruined ; but Wolsey, provoked by the elevation of Clement VII. to the papacy, on the death of Adrian, avenged himself for the broken promises of the emperor, abated Henry's ardour for enterprise, and persuaded him to keep his forces at home under pretence of resisting the Scots, who had embraced the side of the French king. Charles, unable to command money, could not make a diversion on the side of Spain or the Netherlands, and the imperialists, having uselessly wasted the country, were compelled to retire from Provence. Elated by his success, Francis hastened to invade Italy ; but instead of pressing the pursuit of the shattered imperialists, he laid siege to Pavia, and thus gave his adversaries time to strengthen and recruit their forces. With similar imprudence, he sent a large detachment to invade Naples, hoping that the viceroy of that kingdom would withdraw a large portion of the imperialists from the Milanese for its defence. But Charles's generals having received a strong reinforcement raised in Germany by the Constable of Bourbon, attacked the French in their entrenchments, and gained a decisive victory, in which Francis himself was made prisoner (a. d. 1525). This triumph appeared to make Charles master of Italy and arbiter of Europe ; but, in reality, it brought him few substantial advantages. It awakened against him the jealousy of England, the Italian states, and the protestant princes of Germany ; while the disorganized condition of his finances and the consequent difficulty of findino pay, subsistence, or the munitions of war for his soldiers, reduced the imperial armies to inactivity in the very hour of victory. Francis, indeed, conveyed a captive to Madrid, and harshly"], [173, "159 TnE AGE OF CHARLES V. treated, signed terms of peace, in which great concessions were made ; but he had prepared a formal protest against them before they were ratified, and no sooner was he at liberty than he refused compliance with any of the stipulations. During this period, Germany was cruelly harassed by insur rections of the peasants, goaded to madness by the oppressions of their lords. In Thuringia, where a great part of the population had been converted to Lutheranism, Muncer, a wild fanatic, became the leader of the insurgents, and by stimulating their ignorant zeal added religious bigotry to the horrors of civil war. Luther sincerely lamented the scandal that these disturbances brought on the cause of the reformation ; but his own marriage with a nun who had broken her vows, gave such general offence, that his influence, for a season, was greatly diminished. Francis was not long at liberty before he organized a new league against Charles, which was named \" Holy,\" because the pope was its nominal head. The Venetians, the duke of Milan, and the English king, joined the confederacy ; but their opera tions were so slow and feeble, that the imperialists easily maintained their ascendancy in the north of Italy. The Constable of Bourbon, irritated by the vacillating conduct of the pope, marched against Rome, heedless of the truce that had been granted to the pontiff by the Viceroy of Naples. \" The eternal city\" was taken by assault, and suffered more severely from the soldiers of a catholic king than from the barbarous pagans of an earlier age. Bourbon fell in the assault ; but the command of the imperialists devolved on the prince of Orange, who besieged the pope in the castle of St. Angelo, and compelled him to yield himself a prisoner (a. D. 1527). Charles received the intelli gence of this success with contemptible hypocricy ; he professed the most sincere sorrow for the captivity of the holy pontiff, and ordered prayers to be offered for his deliverance in all the Spanish churches, instead of sending orders for his liberation. So great was the indignation excited by the harsh treatment of the pope, that Francis was enabled to invade Italy and penetrate to the very walls of Naples. But here his prosperity ended; the pope, liberated from captivity, resolved to conciliate the emperor ; the Venetians became jealous of the French power,"], [174, "160 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. and, finally, the Genoese hero, Andrew Doria, roused by the wrongs which Francis had inflicted on himself and his country, revolted to the emperor, and turned the scale of the war by making the imperialists superior at sea. Doria's first care was to restore the republic of Genoa ; \u2022 and such was the opinion entertained of his patriotism and disinterestedness, that he was universally called \"The father of his country and the restorer of its liberty\" (a. d. 1528). These circumstances, and the defeat of his army in the Milanese, inclined Francis to peace ; a treaty was negociated at Cambray by the emperor's aunt and the king's mother, but the fair diplomatists left enough of disputable points unsettled to furnish grounds for a future war. Charles having thus prevailed over France, resolved to make a vigorous struggle to crush the reformation in Germany, but the protestant princes, undismayed by his power, formed a league for their mutual protection at Smalkald (a. d. 1530), and applied to the kings of France and England to patronize their confederacy. Henry VIIL was eager to grant them support ; he was desirous to be divorced from his wife, Catherine of Arragon, the emperor's aunt, and attributed the pope's reluct ance to the intrigues of Charles. Hostilities were for a time averted by the emperor's making some important concessions, for he was anxious to have his brother Ferdinand chosen as his successor, with the title of King of the Romans, and the progress of the Turks on his eastern frontiers, could only be resisted by the united strength of the empire. Francis had concluded peace at Cambray, because he was no longer able to maintain war. He sought the earliest opportunity of renewing hostilities, and secured the friendship of the pope, by uniting his son, the duke of Orleans, to the pontiff's niece, Catherine de Medicis. But, though he thus gained one ally, he lost others. Henry VIIL, inflamed by love of Anne Boleyn, and enraged by the pope's confirmation of his marriage with Catherine, no longer kept any measures with the court of Rome; his subjects seconded his resentment ; an act of parliament was passed, abolishing the papal power and jurisdiction in England (a.d. 1534); by another act, the king was declared supreme"], [175, "161 THE AGE OF CHARLES V. head of the church, and all the authority of which the popes were deprived, was vested in him. Henry was thus disinclined to support the pope's ally, and the protestant princes of Germany viewed Francis with some suspicion, because he persecuted the reformed in his own dominions. The death of Clement VII., and the election of Paul III., an adherent of the emperor's, suddenly deprived Francis of the papal aid, on which he had confidently calculated, and compelled him to delay his projects for troubling the peace of Europe. The insurrection of the Anabaptists, a new set of fanatics in Germany, and the emperor's expedition against the piratical states of Barbary, employed men's minds for a season. The suppression of the fanatics, and the conquest of Tunis, crowned the emperor with glory, yet it was at this moment that Francis chose to renew the war (a. d. 1535). Savoy was immediately overrun by the French troops, and its unfortunate duke in vain implored the aid of the emperor, whose resources had been exhausted in the African war. It was on this occasion that Charles challenged his rival to single combat, in which farcical proposal he only imitated the former follies of Francis. On the other hand, the death of the dauphin, amid the joy occasioned by the repulse of the imperialists, who had invaded Provence, was absurdly attributed to poison, administered by emissaries of Charles. To complete the exhibition of folly, Francis summoned Charles, as count of Flanders, to appear before the parliament of Paris, and on his refusal, he was declared to have forfeited the Low Countries to his feudal superior. The war itself was languidly conducted, but the pope, alarmed by the progress of the Turks, personally interfered, and a truce for ten years was concluded between the two sovereigns, at Nice (a. d. 1538). The religious disputes in Germany between the princes of the protestant and those of the catholic league, the struggles made by the pope to prevent the meeting of a general council, unless under circumstances that would give him complete control over its deliberations, filled Charles with anxiety, which was not a little increased by the turbulent disposition of his Flemish subjects, and the success of the Turks in Hungary. Notwith standing all these difficulties, he undertook an expedition against"], [176, "162 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. Algiers (a. d. 1541), but his fleet was shattered by a storm, his army wasted by a pestilential disease, and his stores of provision rendered unavailing. He was compelled to return, overwhelmed with loss and disgrace, and his defeat raised the courage of his enemies so high that he had to encounter a new war in Europe. Francis was eager to take advantage of his rival's distress, and the crime of the imperial governor of the Milanese furnished him with a decent pretext. This imprudent functionary seized two ambassadors, sent from the Parisian court to Turkey, and put them to death, in direct violation of the law of nations. Francis now changed his plan of operations ; acting on the defensive in Italy, he invaded the Netherlands and Rousillon (a. d. 1542), but failed to make any permanent impression. Charles found an ally in the king of England : the death of his aunt had removed the great source of enmity between the emperor and Flenry, and the close alliance between France and Scotland, recently cemented by the marriage of the Scotch king, James V., to a French princess, Mary of Guise, had excited great jealousy and alarm in England. Henry, with his usual impetuosity, having introduced the reformation into England, became anxious that Scotland should also withdraw its alle\u00b0i ance from the pope, and endeavoured to win his nephew James to adopt his plan, by the most advantageous offers. The influence of the Seottish clergy prevailed over that of the English monarch, and Henry, in his fury, proclaimed war against Scotland. In the midst of these troubles, James V. died, leaving his dominions to his infant daughter, Mary, the celebrated and unfortunate queen of Scots. This chanoed all Henry's plans; he aimed at uniting the two kingdoms, by effecting a marriage between his son Edward and Mary, but he knew that this could only be effected by crushing the French party in Scotland, and eager to accomplish this object, he readily entered into the alliance against Francis. The French monarch, on the other hand, entered into close union with the Turks, and courted the support of the German protestants; but the princes of the empire refused to join so bitter a persecutor of the reformed doctrines, and his only ally, the duke of Cleves, was forced to submit to Charles. The"], [177, "163 THE AGE OF CHARLES V. sultan afforded him more effective support; he invaded Hungary in person, and sent the celebrated admiral and pirate, Barbarossa, to join the French in invading Italy. Nice was besieged by their united forces ; to the astonishment and scandal of all Christendom, the lilies of France and the crescent of Mohammed appeared in conjunction against a fortress, on which the cross of Savoy was displayed. The allies were finally compelled to raise the siege, and Francis had not even the poor consolation of success, in return for the infamy of having taken as auxiliaries the deadly enemies of Christianity. The battle of Cerisoles (a. d. 1544) gave his arms the fame of useless victory, but it did not prevent the cotemporary invasion of France by the emperor on the side of Lorraine, and the English through Calais. Had Charles and Henry acted in concert, Francis must have yielded unconditionally, but he took advantage of their disunion to conclude a separate peace with the emperor at Cressy (a. d. 1544). Henry VIIL continued the war for some time longer, but it did not produce any event of consequence. Charles had now secured his predominance in Italy, and was secretly preparing to restore the imperial authority in Germany. Death removed his two powerful cotemporaries, Francis and Henry, in the same year (a. p. 1547), both of whom would have been dangerous antagonists. Though Henry's motives in favouring the reformation were not very pure, his intense hatred of the popes must have induced him to protect the protestant interest in Germany. The secularization of Prussia, by Albert of Brandenburg (a. d. 1525), was the first example of the seizure of church property, consequent on the change of religion; but the indignation of the catholic princes, and the ambition of the protestants, were restrained by the Turkish and the French wars. Still the emperor's conduct at the diets of Spires and Augsburg, the pope's anxiety to convene a council subservient to his will, and the intrigues of the ecclesiastics in the states that retained their con nexion with Rome, compelled the protestants to renew the league of Smalkald, and assign the fixed contingent of men and arms that should be supplied by the several members. When the couned of Trent finally opened (a. d. 1545), its very form and its first"], [178, "164 THE REFORMATION, AND. STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. decision rendered it impossible for the protestants to take any part in it. But the peace of Cressy left them unprotected, and their want of mutual confidence prevented them from acting in concert. At the very commencement of the war, Prince Maurice, of Saxony, deserted the league, and joined the emperor; John Frederic, the elector of Saxony, and chief leader of the protes tants, was made prisoner at the battle of Muhlberg (a. d. 1547), and his dominions rewarded the treachery of Maurice. The landgrave of Hesse, the last hope of the reformers, was inveigled to visit the emperor, at Halle, and dishonourably detained as a captive. This rapid success of the emperor alarmed the pope, who began to fear that Charles would prevail upon the council to limit his pontifical authority, and the two potentates, apparently believing the protestant cause crushed, began to seek for their own private advantages. Charles published a code of doctrines called the \" Interim,\" because the regulations it contained were only to be in force until the convocation of a free general council, and this edict, which was strictly conformable to the tenets of the Romish church, he resolved to enforce on the empire (a.d. 1548). Catholics and protestants equally declaimed against this summary mode of settling a nation's faith, but the emperor scarcely encountered any open resistance, except from the free city of Magdeburgh, and an army sent to reduce this disobedient place, was entrusted to Maurice of Saxony. Maurice was secretly dissatisfied with the conduct of the emperor, and was especially grieved by the detention of his father-in-law, the landgrave of Hesse. He formed a bold plan for compelling the emperor, by a sudden attack, to establish religious freedom, and liberate the landgrave, but concealed his projects until the most favourable moment for putting them into execution. On the surrender of Magdeburgh (a.d. 1551), he contrived to win the confidence of the garrison and the citizens, without awakening the suspicions of the emperor, and he entered into a secret treaty with Henry II. of France, the son and successor of Francis. No words can describe the astonishment and distress of the emperor, when Maurice, having completed his preparations, published his manifesto, detailing the grievances"], [179, "THE AGE OF CHARLES V. 165 which he required to be redressed. The active prince proceeded with so much promptitude and vigour, that Charles narrowly escaped being made prisoner at Innspruck. The council of Trent was broken up; the prelates tumultuously voted a prorogation for two years, but more than ten elapsed before its proceedings were renewed. The emperor had the mortification to see all his projects overthrown by the prince whom he had most trusted, and was compelled to sign a treaty at Passau, by which the captive princes were restored to liberty, and a free exercise of their religion secured to the protestants (a. d. 1552). The war with France lasted three years longer ; it was conducted without any great battles, but on the whole, proved unfavour able to the emperor. The protestant religion was first legally established in England by Edward VI., the pious son of the profligate Henry. But the troubles occasioned by his minority, and the ambition of his guardians, prevented the reformed church from being fixed on a permanent foundation. Edward died young (a. d. 1553), and the papal dominion was restored by his bigoted successor and sister, Mary. Charles, having failed to procure the empire for his son Philip, negociated a marriage between that prince and queen Mary, which was concluded, much to the dissatisfaction of the British nation. Mary's cruel persecutions of the protestants failed to reconcile her subjects to the yoke of Rome, and on her death (a. d. 1558), the reformed religion was triumphantly restored by her sister Elizabeth. The diet which assembled at Augsburg (a. d. 1555), did not secure to the protestants all the advantages they had a right to expect. Maurice had fallen in a petty war, and they had no leader fit to be his successor. With strange imprudence, the Lutherans consented to the exclusion of the Calvinists from the benefits of religious toleration, and left several important ques tions undecided, the pregnant source of future wars. When the labours of the diet terminated, Charles, mortified at being forced to resign the hope of securing the empire to his son, saddened by his experience of the instability of fortune, and broken down by illness, resolved to abdicate his double authority. He resigned the sceptre of Spain and the Netherlands to his son,"], [180, "166 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE, Philip II., and the imperial crown some months after to his brother Ferdinand: he then retired to the monastery of St. Justus, in Valladolid, where he died (a. d. 1558). The long struggle for religious freedom during the reign of Charles V. terminated in favour of the reformation ; but the Romish church was far from being subdued, and it derived most efficient support from the institution of the Jesuits, a political rather than religious society, admirably organized for the support of the highest and most unyielding assumptions of papal authority. This body became formidable from its unity and the secrecy of its operations, but it at length excited the alarm of catholic princes, and was suppressed in the last century. Section V. \u2014 The Age of Elizabeth. The accession of Elizabeth was the crisis of the reformation in Great Britain ; as she was the daughter of Anne Boleyn, whose marriage with Henry VIIL had not been sanctioned by the Romish church, her title was not recognised by the catholics, and the king of France permitted his daughter-in-law, Mary, queen of Scots, to assume the amis and title of England. Elizabeth secured herself by entering into secret alliance with the heads of the protestant party in Scotland, who succeeded in withdrawing that kingdom from its allegiance to the pope, and so fettering the royal authority, that the queen dowager, who acted as regent for her daughter, was too much harassed at home to make any hostile attempt on England. Connected with the cause of the reformation by her own interests, Elizabeth was naturally regarded as the head of the protestants in Europe, while Philip II. was the champion of the catholics. Hence England became the counterpoise to Spain in this age, as France had been in the preceding. But the ancient rivaby between France and Spain was of the highest importance to England ; it prevented a cordial union between the catholic powers of Europe for checking the progress of the reformation, and it secured support for her doubtful title, ere her noble"], [181, "167 THE AGE OP ELIZABETH. qualities becoming known, earned for her the best of all securities, the affections of the English nation. Mary, queen of Scots, was the niece of Henry VIIL, and next heir to his crown if the illegitimacy of Elizabeth were established ; she was wedded to the heir apparent of the French monarchy, her maternal uncles, the princes of Lorraine, were remarkable for capacity, valour, and daring ambition, and she had reasonable prospects of success at a time when Scotland was divided between the contending communions, Ireland altogether catholic, and while catholics predominated in the north of England. The death of Henry II., by a mortal wound in a tournament, raised Mary's husband, the feeble Francis II., to the French throne, and through the young queen's influence transferred the power of the monarchy to the princes of Lorraine. The bigoted Philip II. was so alarmed at the probable accession of power to his great rivals, that he not only acknowdedged Elizabeth's title, but proffered her marriage. She declined the offer, and Philip gave his hand to the princess Elizabeth of France, and concluded a treaty with that power at Chateau Cambresis. Though no express stipulations were made, it was well known that the extirpation of heresy formed a part of this alliance between the two great catholic powers ; it led to a furious war of religion, which ended in the establishment of a new European state. Before entering on the history of the religious wars in France and the Netherlands, it is of importance to examine the state of England and Scotland during the early part of Elizabeth's reio-n. On the death of Francis II. (Dec. 1560), Mary was compelled to return to her native dominions by the jealousy of her mother-in-law, Catherine de Medicis, who secretly envied the power of the princes of Lorraine. She left France with a heavy heart, and from the very first moment of her landing had to endure indignities the most mortifying to her proud spirit. Popery had been overthrown in Scotland, but the protestantism erected in its stead was just as bigoted and as intolerant as the ancient creed had been in the worst of times. Still, the winning manners of the queen, and the weakness of her party, prevented any immediate outbreak ; and the confidence of the protestants"], [182, "168 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. in the earl of Moray restrained the violence of their fanaticism. The marriage of Mary, to the young Lord Darnley, in spite of the remonstrances both of Elizabeth and Lord Moray (a. d. 1565), led to the first open breach between the queen and her subjects. Several lords, indignant at the refusal of security to the protestant religion, sought safety in England, and they soon gained Darnley himself to join their association. An Italian, of mean birth, David Rizzio, having been appointed private secretary to the queen, gained such an ascendancy over her, that Darnley's jealousy was roused ; he entered into a conspiracy with the exiled lords, introduced an armed band secretly into the palace, arrested Rizzio in the queen's presence, and murdered him at the door of her chamber. The birth of a son led to an apparent reconciliation between Mary and her husband ; but its hollowness was proved by Darnley's being excluded from witnessing the baptism of his own child. The appearance of renewed affection was maintained notwithstanding this insult ; Darnley fell sick, Mary visited him with apparent anxiety, and under the pretence that quiet was necessary to an invalid, removed him to a solitary hcaise called the Kirk of Field. On the 9th of February, 1567, this house was blown up with gunpowder, and the unfortunate Darnley's lifeless body carried to some distance, where it was found without any external mark of violence. The measures taken by Mary to screen Bothwell, universally regarded as the author of this crime, and her subsequent marriage to that nobleman, seemed conclusive evidence that she had countenanced her husband's murder. The Scottish lords flew to arms ; Mary was forced to yield herself a prisoner to her irritated subjects, and Bothwell fled into exile. The unfortunate queen, confined in Lochleven castle, was forced to abdicate in favour of her son, who was crowned with the title of James VI. She escaped from her prison, and soon found herself at the head of a numerous army, but within eleven days from her deliverance she was completely defeated in the battle of Langside, and forced to seek refuge in England (a. d. 1568). Elizabeth placed the fugitive in close custody, a measure which her safety perhaps demanded, but which was"], [183, "169 THE AGE OF ELIZABETH. scarcely consistent with her honour. The insurrections of the catholic lords in the northern counties, and Mary's intrigues with the duke of Norfolk, combined with the open attempts of the catholic states against Elizabeth, rendered the unfortunate queen's detention a matter of prudent expediency, if not of prime necessity. In the mean time, the conspiracy for the extirpation of protestantism, formed at Bayonne in September, 1565, between Catherine de Medicis on the part of France, and the duke of Alva as representative of Spain, had begun to produce the most disastrous consequences. Alva being sent by Philip to govern the Netherlands, commenced a career of sanguinary persecution which can scarcely be paralleled in history (a. d. 1567). The complaints of the Flemings were unheeded by Philip, whose natural gloom was augmented by the death of his son, Don Carlos, a death which the unhappy father certainly hastened. The judicial murder of the Counts Egmont and Llorn, the cruelties exercised by the inquisition, and the arbitrary execu tions ordained by the council for the suppression of disturbances, provoked an insurrection against Alva ; whilst, nearly at the same time, the French protestants, or, as they were called, the Huguenots, were forced to take arms to defend their lives and properties. In the spring of 1560, the French protestants were detected in a conspiracy for taking the infant king out of the hands of the persecuting Guises, and expelling the entire Lorraine family from France. The massacres with which this crime was punished, produced retaliation, a civil war ensued, which, interrupted by short and unsteady truces, lasted to 1570, when a treaty, favourable to the huguenots, was concluded at St. Germains. Charles IX., king of France, had then just attained his majority, but he was still influenced by his mother's counsels ; and, at the instigation of Catherine, he planned and executed the most memorable act of perfidy that sullies the annals of humanity. Under the presence of cementing the union of the protestant and catholic parties, by the marriage of his sister Margaret with the huguenot prince of Navarre, he invited all the leaders of the reformed party to Paris, and by the warmest professions of i"], [184, "170 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. friendship lulled their suspicions. On the eve of St. Bartholo mew (a. d. 1572), a general slaughter of those who had confided in the royal professions commenced ; the devoted huguenots were massacred in their beds, or shot on the roofs of the houses while attempting to escape. The fury of the murderers abated not during eight days and nights ; several catholics perished, the victims of mistake or of private animosity, and similar atrocities were perpetrated in the principal cities of the king dom. But there still remained nearly two millions of huguenots to avenge the fate of their murdered brethren; the civil war was renewed, and Charles had the mortification to find that this atrocious crime had been committed in vain. While public rejoicings were made at Rome and Madrid, for the supposed overthrow of heresy in France, the horror and indignation excited by the massacre in northern Europe, not only amongst protestant, but even catholic princes, proved a serious injury to the catholic cause. The prince of Orano-e placed himself at the head of the revolters in the Netherlands, the Gueux, or Beggars, as they were contemptuously called by their oppressors. Though at first unsuccessful, he gave the insurrection a determinate character by the capture of Brille (a. d. 1572), a conquest which secured him a naval station for his daring cruisers, and encouraged the cities of Holland and Zealand to reject the Spanish yoke. The massacre of St. Bartholomew weakened the insurgents by depriving them of the aid of the French huguenots ; but instead of quellino- their courage, it only stimulated them to perseverance. Defeated by land and deprived of their strongest cities, they attacked the Spaniards on sea, and captured several rich freights. At lenoth Alva retired in despair, and was succeeded by Zunega y Requesens (Dec. 1573). In the very commencement of his administration, Requesens gained a decisive victory over the insurgents at Monher Moor near Nimeguen. The three brothers of the prince of Oranoe fell in this fatal battle, which would probably have terminated the war but for a mutiny of the Spanish soldiers. The turbulence of the royal army, the insolence and licentiousness of the Spaniards, and the pillage of Antwerp by the mutineers,"], [185, "171 THE AGE OF ELIZABETH. excited the indignation of catholics and protestants. Five of the Batavian and six of the Belgic provinces entered into the Pacification of Ghent, which provided for the expulsion of foreigners, the repeal of Alva's sanguinary edicts, and restoration of the ancient power of the states-general (a. d. 1576). Don John of Austria, who had succeeded Requesens in the govern ment, disarmed suspicion by acceding to the league of Ghent ; but this confederacy soon fell to pieces, owing to the jealousy between the protestant and catholic states. It now became manifest that freedom could be attained only by a close union of the northern provinces, and a final rupture with Spain. Acting on this belief, the prince of Orange organized the confederacy of Utrecht, the basis of that commonwealth so renowned under the name of the republic of the United Provinces (a. d. 1579). But notwithstanding these precautions, the nomination of the duke of Parma to the regency threatened to ruin all the projects of the prince of Orange. The southern provinces, inspired with a jealousy of the protestant designs on the catholic religion, entered into alliance with the regent and levied an army against the insurgents of the north. But the Hollanders, thus deserted, did not lose courage, they formally renounced their allegiance to the Spanish crown and chose the duke of Anjou, brother to the king of France, for their sovereign (a. D. 1581). But this choice did not produce the expected advantages ; and the duke of Anjou, after a brief struggle, abandoned all hopes of competing with the duke of Parma, and returned to France. It is pro bable that the States would have chosen the prince of Orange for their constitutional sovereign, but that hero was stabbed by a fanatic, whether instigated wholly by bigotry, or partly seduced by Spanish gold, it is now difficult to determine (a. d. 1584). Amid the general gloom spread over the protestant confederates, by the loss of their illustrious leader, the Hollanders and Zealanders chose Maurice his son, a young man of eighteen, their stadtholder and captain-general by sea and land. The war still continued ; but though the duke of Parma prevailed in the field, and finally captured the important city of Antwerp (a. d. 1585), the confederates never dreamed I 2"], [186, "172 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. of submission. They offered the sovereignty of their republic to queen Elizabeth on certain conditions, and though she rejected the proffer, she sent the earl of Leicester to their aid with a considerable army. The misconduct of Leicester prevented the Hollanders from gaining all the advantages from the English auxiliaries that might have been expected ; but the breaking out of war between England and Spain, the death of the duke of Parma in the civil wars of France, and the heroism of Prince Maurice, gave them such a decided superiority by sea and land, that their independence was secured and finally recognised by Spain (a. d. 1609). Before entering on the history of the war between England and Spain, it is necessary to take aretrospective view of the state of France. On the death of Charles IX., his brother Henry III. resigned the throne of Poland for that of France (a. d. 1574). This prince, on his return, began a war of persecution, and concluded by an ignominious peace with his own subjects, in less than a year. He then abandoned himself to the lowest debaucheries, strangely combined with the practice of the most degrading superstitions. Opposed to the king, were the princes of Lorraine, whose chief, Henry, duke of Guise, was deservedly regarded as the leader of the violent catholic party in France. Noble in person, polished in demeanour, endowed with superior talents, and animated by grasping ambition, he seemed formed by nature to become the leader of a faction, and art had lent its aid to improve all these advantages. The utter contempt into which Henry III. had fallen, and the rage of the catholics at the tolerance granted to the protestants, bjr the late pacification encouraged the duke of Guise to raise the cry of religion in danger, and the fanatic populace, roused by this hypocritical pretext, began to take arms to defend their church. The Holy League, drawn up by Guise's uncle, the cardinal of Lorraine for the defence of the catholic religion, was signed and sworn to by catholics of all ranks and conditions in Paris and the provinces. The duke of Guise was appointed head of the league, the pope and the king of Spain declared themselves its protectors and the wretched Henry was forced to yield to the faction, assemble"], [187, "173 THE AGE OF ELIZABETH. the states at Blois, and revoke the freedom of conscience granted to the huguenots. The consequence was a civil war, the ninth which afflicted France since the death of Francis II. The fate of the unhappy queen of Scots, which had been determined ever since the massacre of St. Bartholomew, was precipitated by the formation of the Holy League. Some enthusiastic English catholics entered into a conspiracy for assassinating Elizabeth ; Mary was cognizant of their plans, but her participation in the plot is very doubtful. However, an act of parliament was passed authorizing her trial; commissioners were sent for the purpose to Fotheringay castle, the place of her confinement, and after an investigation, in which the forms of law and the principles of justice were little regarded, she was condemned to death. Elizabeth, with much apparent, but some real reluctance, signed the warrant of execution, and placed it in the hands of Davison, her private secretary, enjoining him not to use it without further orders (a. d. 1587). Davison, however, showed the warrant to the members of the council, and they, without further consulting Elizabeth, had the unhappy Mary beheaded. Henry III. of France, soon after wards, had his capital enemies, the duke and cardinal of Guise, assassinated, but this atrocious crime only roused the leaguers to more vigorous measures ; they assembled a parliament, deposed the king, and created the duke of Mayenne lieutenant-general of the kingdom. Philip II., in the mean time, prepared an expedition which he fondly hoped would conquer England, and thus destroy the great stay of Protestantism in Europe. Ships were prepared in all the ports throughout his extensive dominions; Spain, Portugal, Naples, and those parts of the Low Countries which still recognised his authority. An army of 30,000 picked men was assembled under the most experienced officers of Italy, Spain, and Germany, and the chief command was entrusted to the celebrated duke of Parma. The pope blessed an expedition that seemed destined once more to restore the supremacy of the Holy See; and the catholics, throughout Europe were so confident of success, that they named the armament, \" The Invincible"], [188, "174 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. Armada.\" Elizabeth undauntedly prepared to meet the danger. She entrusted the command of her fleet to a catholic nobleman, Lord Howard of Effingham, while the land army was placed under the command of the earl of Leicester. Nothing could exceed the enthusiastic determination of the English people to defend their religion and liberties, though the queen had but one ally on whose assistance she could reckon, James, king of Scotland ; she trusted to the attachment of her people, and found that the love of her subjects was the best security of her throne. On the 30th of May, 1588, the Armada sailed from Lisbon, but having been shattered by a storm, it was forced to stop at Corunna, and it did not reach the English Channel until the 19th of July. Here the Spanish admiral, the duke of Medina Sidonia, was surprised to find that the duke of Parma was not prepared to join him with a fleet and army. While he hesitated, the light English squadrons assailed his heavy vessels on all sides, and after seven days, three of which only passed without warm actions, though there was no decisive engagement, the Armada was so shattered by English skill and bravery, that it was forced to take shelter in the roads of Calais. The earl of Effingham, following up his advantage, sent in fire-ships during the night, which destroyed several vessels, and threw the others into such confusion, that the Spaniards no longer thought of victory, but escape. The duke of Medina Sidonia, drcadin\u00bb again to encounter the English fleet, attempted to return home by sailing round the north of Scotland; but dreadful storms overtook the Armada, many of the ships were driven on the shores of Norway-, Ireland, and the north of Scotland, and out of the triumphant navy that sailed from Lisbon, only a few shattered vessels returned to bring intelligence of the calamity that had overwhelmed the rest. This glorious success was deservedly regarded, not so much as the triumph of England, as of the protestant cause throughout Europe ; it virtually established the independence of the Dutch, and it raised the courage of the huguenots in France. It completely destroyed the decisive influence that Spain had"], [189, "175 THE AGE OF ELIZABETH. acquired in the affairs of Europe ; ever since the shipwreck of the Armada, the Spanish state and people seem to have lost all energy, and sunk into almost hopeless decay. Henry III. of France, obliged by the violence of the league to seek the aid of his protestant subjects, was murdered by a fanatic monk, just as he was upon the point of driving his enemies from Paris. By his death, the house of Valois became extinct, and the right of inheritance passed to the Bourbon family, descended from Robert, the sixth son of St. Louis. Its representative was Henry of Navarre, who now claimed to be Henry IV. of France, a warlike, chivalrous prince, endowed with many amiable qualities, but disliked by his new subjects on account of his attachment to the protestant religion. After a long struggle, Henry found it necessary to abjure his faith, in order to secure his crown, but he atoned to the huguenots for his compulsory desertion, by issuing the celebrated edict of Nantes. Still he had to make good his rights by the sword ; for his abjuration could not induce either the pope or Philip II. to give up their plans. He received some aid from Elizabeth, but his final success was mainly due to his own eminent abilities ; his triumph was virtually completed by the capture of Paris (a. d. 1594), but Spain persevered in its hostility until the peace of Vervins (a. d. 1598). The close of Elizabeth's reign was clouded by sanguinary wars against her Irish subjects, whose insurrections were too often provoked by the injustice of their rulers, and by the execution of her ill-fated favourite, the earl of Essex. But notwithstanding these domestic calamities, she maintained the war against Spain with great vigour, and encouraged her subjects to undermine the strength of that kingdom by enter prises against its commerce. The annexation of Portugal to the crown of Spain, apparently gave the subjects of Philip II. complete command of the Indian, as well as the South American trade; but the wars of that monarch with England and Holland, raised both countries to a rivalry that terminated to the disad vantage, if not to the ruin, of the Spanish commerce. In 1591, the English, for the first time, performed the voyage to India ; and in 1600, the year in which the East India Company was"], [190, "176 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. founded, they took possession of the island of St. Helena. The Hanseatic league, now fast sinking into decay, complained loudly of the encouragement given by the English government to its native merchants, and prohibited the English from trading in Germany ; but this unwise attempt to enforce monopoly, produced measures of retaliation that speedily proved fatal to their privileges and their power. During Elizabeth's reign, Eno-land attained the highest rank among European states, and may be said to have held the balance of power in Christendom ; that this was owing, in no small degree, to the personal character of the sovereign, is manifest from the rapid decline of British influence, when the sceptre passed to the feeble house of Stuart. Section VI. \u2014 The Age of Gustavus Adolphus. From the death of Charles V. to the accession of Ferdinand II., there were few events in German history that produced any important result in the general politics of Europe. Ferdinand I. and his son Maximilian II., were sincerely attached to peace, and Rudolph II. was willing to leave the world in quiet, if the world would have left him undisturbed. From the time of his accession (a. d. 1576), Rudolph's great anxiety was to unite the Germanic princes in a firm league against the Turks ; but theological dissensions, united with political ambition, served to prepare the way for fresh convulsions. The influence of the Jesuits in the imperial court, so alarmed the protestants, that they formed a new alliance, called \" The Evangelical Union,\" of which the elector-palatine was declared the chief (a. d. 1609), and this was opposed by a catholic league, in which foreign, as well as German princes were joined. In this unsettled state of affairs, the competition for the succession to a small principality had nearly involved Europe in a general war. Henry IV. of France, after having secured himself on the throne, entrusted the chief management of his affairs to the duke of Sully, under whose wise administration the finances were so improved, and the strength of the kingdom so consolidated, that France began"], [191, "THE AGE OF GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS. 177 to take the lead in European policy. Henry had formed a great scheme for making all Christendom a federate republic, in which the rights and independence of the several states should be firmly secured. A more immediate project was the humiliation of the house of Austria, whose increasing power in Germany and Spain was deemed dangerous to all the surrounding coun tries. The vacancy in the duchies of Cleves and Juliers, which, on the death of the duke without male heirs, had been seized by the emperor as lapsed fiefs, gave Henry a pretext for interfering in the affairs of Germany ; he formed alliances with several of his neighbours, and especially with the king of England, and the Italian princes. But while preparing to assist at the coronation of his queen, Mary de Medicis, he was stabbed by a fanatic, named Ravaillac (a. d. 1610), and the disturbances that ensued, prevented the French from making further exertions in Germany. The dissensions in the Austrian family contributed to avert a general war. Rudolph was gradually driven from his whole dominions by his brother Matthias ; deserted by his ancient partisans, he became melancholy and distrustful, shutting himself up in his palace, where grief and want of exercise soon produced a mortal disease, which brought him prematurely to the grave (a. d. 1611). Matthias succeeded to the imperial crown, and though he had been previously befriended by the protestants, he threw himself into the arms of the catholic party, and thus increased the dissatisfaction which had led to the evangelical union ; he procured the crown of Bohemia for his cousin Ferdinand, archduke of Gratz, and this bigoted monarch soon forced his protestant subjects to revolt. While the war was yet in pro gress, Matthias died, and Ferdinand, to the great alarm of the protestant party, was elected emperor (a.d. 1619). Ferdinand entered into close alliance with the Spanish branch of the house of Hapsburgh, but this family compact was not so formidable as it had been heretofore. The union of the crown of Portugal to that of Spain had not added much real strength to Philip II. ; the Portuguese hated the Spaniards, especially as they were compelled to abandon their lucrative commerce with the revolted Hollanders, and were finally deprived of the greater part of their i 3"], [192, "178 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. Indian colonies by the successful republicans. The defeat of the Armada, followed by these colonial losses, rendered the reign of Philip II. calamitous to the Peninsula ; but on his death (a. d. 1598) it was destined to suffer still greater losses from the bigotry of his successor. Philip III. expelled the Moriscoes or Moors, who had remained in the Peninsula after the overthrow of the last Mohammedan dynasty, and thus deprived himself of the services of more than a million of his most industrious subjects (a.d. 1610). He entrusted the administration of the the kingdom to favourites, chosen without discrimination, and made the custom of governing by ministers a maxim of state. On his death (a.d. 1621), Spain, though still respected and even feared, was in reality deplorably weak ; but the reign of Philip IV. almost completed its ruin; the Catalans revolted, and placed themselves under the protection of France ; the Portu guese, choosing for their monarch the duke of Braganza, achieved their independence (a. d. 1640), and the Neapolitans, harassed by the premier, the count-duke of Olivarez, attempted to form a republic. These events were not foreseen when Ferdinand became emperor. The Bohemian protestants, dreading his bigotry, chose Frederic, the elector-palatine, son-in-law of the British monarch, for their sovereign, and in an evil hour for himself, Frederic assumed the royal title. James I. was a monarch of much learning and little wisdom ; the natural timidity of his disposition, and his anxiety to secure the hand of a Spanish princess for his son, induced him to observe a neutrality in this dispute, contrary to the ardent wishes of his subjects. Duped by vanity, he believed himself a consummate master of diplomacy, and entered into a series of negotiations, which only showed his weakness, and rendered him contemptible in the eyes of Europe. Deserted by his father-in-law, and by many of the protestant princes, on whose assistance he relied, the elector-palatine lost not only Bohemia, but his hereditary dominions, which were shared by his enemies (a. d. 1623). Circumstances, in the mean time, had occurred to change the neutral policy of England. The young Prince Charles, accom panied by his favourite, the duke of Buckingham, had made a"], [193, "179 THE AGE OF GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS. romantic journey to Madrid, which, contrary to general expecta tion, led to the breaking off of the Spanish match. The discovery of a conspiracy for blowing up the British king and parliament with gunpowder (a. d. 1605), inflamed the English nation against the catholics, because the plot had been devised by some fanatics of that religion, who hoped in the confusion that must have ensued, to restore the supremacy of their church. Finally, count Mansfelt, the ablest of the protestant leaders, succeeded in convincing James that he had been egregiously duped by the Spaniards. A new protestant union was formed, of which Christian IV., king of Denmark, was chosen the head, and the war burst forth with fresh violence. The imperial generals, Tilly and Wallenstein, were far superior to their protestant adversaries. Wallenstein, having been created duke of Friedland and chief commander of the imperial army raised by himself, acted with so much vigour, that Christian, threatened with the loss of his own dominions, was forced to purchase peace by renouncing all right to interfere in the affairs of Germany and abandoning his allies, especially the dukes of Mecklenburg (a.d. 1629). Wallenstein obtained the investi ture of Mccklenburgh, and claimed henceforth a rank among the princes of the empire. England had borne little share in this arduous contest. On the death of James (a. d. 1625), his son Charles I. ascended the British throne, and was almost immediately involved in a contest with his parliament, which effectually diverted his attention from foreign affairs. The principal causes of this were the growing love of liberty in the English people ; the suspicions of danger to religion from the king's marriage with so bigoted a catholic as the princess Henrietta Maria, of France ; the unpopu larity of Buckingham, the royal favourite ; and the increasing hostility of the puritans to the episcopal form of church government. The troubles and distractions by which France were weakened during the minority and the early part of the reign of Louis XIII. began to disappear, when Cardinal Richelieu was placed at the head of the administration. His great talents and singular firmness acquired for his country a new and vigorous influence in the political system of Europe, at"], [194, "180 TOE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. the very moment when a counterpoise was most wanting to the overgrown power of the house of Austria. Richelieu's first operations were directed against the hugue nots, whom he completely subdued and rendered utterly helpless by the capture of Rochelle. Scarcely had the reduction of this important city been effected, when the cardinal commenced his war against Austria by endeavouring to secure the duchy of Mantua for the duke of Nevers, in opposition to the emperor, the king of Spain, and the duke of Savoy. The war was terminated by the treaty of Chierasio (a.d. 1631), which destroyed -the Spanish supremacy in Italy, restored the old influence of France, and gave that power possession of several of the most important fortresses on the frontiers. But far more important was the share which Richelieu had in renewing the war in Germany, and bringing forward a protestant leader, able and willing to cope with the imperial generals. During the war of the Mantuan succession, the emperor Ferdinand published an edict at Vienna, commanding the protestants to restore all the ecclesiastical benefices of which they had taken possession since the treaty of Passau. Some submitted, others remonstrated; imperial commissioners were sent to decide on the claims of the bishops and monks to restitution; the execution of the decree was entrusted to Wallenstein, who acted with so much rigour that the protestants were inflamed with just rage, and even the catholics joined in demanding justice against him from the emperor. So great was the clamour, that the emperor was forced to dismiss his general and confer the command of the imperial army upon Count Tilly. Scarcely had this important step been taken, when Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, secretly urged by some of the discontented protestant princes, published a declaration of war against the emperor, and after having captured the important island of Rugen, landed in Germany (June 24, 1630). An alliance was formed between the king and the leading protestant princes of Pomerania, Brandenburg, and Hesse ; Saxony, after some efforts to preserve neutrality, was forced to accede to the league; and Richelieu, who had no small share in forming the original plan, secured for the confederates the active co-operation"], [195, "181 THE AGE OF GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS. of France. The early successes of Gustavus would have been more decisive but for the jealousy of the Saxon princes, who prevented his passage through their dominions, and thus hindered him from relieving the city of Magdeburg, hard pressed by Count Tilly and the imperial forces. The unfor tunate city was finally taken by assault ; the cruel Tilly would show no mercy, thirty thousand of the inhabitants perished by water, fire, and sword ; and of this once flourishing city nothing was left standing except the cathedral and about one hundred and fifty7 fishing huts on the banks of the Elbe. This atrocious cruelty cemented the alliance betweefl Gustavus and the protestant princes ; the elector of Saxony, justly alarmed by the fate of his neighbours, and irritated by the menaces of Tillv, whom his recent success had filled with presumptuous pride, joined the king with all his forces at Wittemberg> A resolution to try the chances of battle was taken ; and at Leipsic, the imperialists were so decisively over thrown, that if Gustavus had marched immediately to Vienna, that city would probably have fallen. All the members of the evangelical union joined the king of Sweden ; the measures of the catholic confederates were disconcerted, and the whole country between the Elbe and the Rhine was occupied by the protestant forces. Early in the following year, Count Tilly was killed in disputing with the Swedes the passage of the Lech ; and Gustavus overran Bavaria. The emperor, in his distress, had recourse to Wallenstein, who was restored to command with unlimited powers. Gustavus attacked the imperialists in their entrenchments at Nuremberg, and was defeated with some loss ; but, anxious to retrieve his fame, he sought an early opportunity of bringing his rival to a second engagement. The armies met at Lutzen (Nov. 16, 1632), the confederates attacked the imperialists in their entrenchments, and after a dreadful contest, that lasted nine hours, put them completely to the rout. But the victors had little cause to triumph ; Gustavus fell, mortally wounded, in the middle of the engagement, and died before the fortune of the day was decided. His death produced great changes in the political state of Europe. The elector-palatine, believing all his hopes of resto-"], [196, "182 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. ration blighted, died of a broken heart ; the protestant con federates, deprived of a head, were divided into factions ; while the Swedes, overwhelmed with sorrow, saw the throne of their heroic prince occupied by a girl only seven years old. But the council of regency, appointed to protect the minority of the young queen Christina, entrusted the management of the German war to the chancellor Oxenstiern, a statesman of the highest order ; under his guidance, the protestant alliance again assumed a formidable aspect, and hostilities were prosecuted with vigour and success by the duke of Saxe Weimar, and the generals Banier and Horn. An unexpected event added to their confidence ; Ferdinand became jealous of Wallenstein, and suspected him, not without cause, of aiming at sovereign power. The emperor was too timid to bring this powerful leader to a legal trial ; he, therefore, had recourse to the dishonourable expedient of assassination (a. d. 1634), and Wallenstein was murdered in his own camp. The confederates did not gain all the advantages they anticipated from the fall of the duke of Friedland ; the emperor's eldest son, the king of Hungary, having succeeded to the command, gained several advantages, and twenty thousand Spaniards arrived in Germany to the aid of the imperialists, under the duke of Feria. The protestant leaders, anxious to stop the progress of the king of Hungary, attacked him at Nordlingen. The battle was one of the most obstinate recorded in history; it ended in the complete rout of the confederates, notwithstanding the most vigorous efforts of the Swedes. The emperor improved his victory by negotiation; he concluded a treaty with all the protestant princes, except the landgrave of Hesse, at Prague (a. d. 1635), and thus the whole weight of the war was thrown on the French and the Swedes."], [197, "183 ADMINISTRATION OF RICHELIEU AND MAZARINE. Section VII. \u2014 Administration of the Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarine. Richelieu ruled France with a rod of iron ; hated alike by the nobility and the people, he continued to hold the reins of government, and all conspiracies formed against him ended in the ruin of the contrivers. Jealousy of Gustavus prevented him from cordially co-operating with that prince, and Oxen stiern afterwards was unwilling to give the French any influence in Germany. But the battle of Nordlingen rendered a change of policy necessary, and the Swedish chancellor offered to put the French in immediate possession of Philipsburg and the province of Alsace, on condition of their taking an active share in the war against the emperor. Richelieu readily entered into a treaty so favourable to his projects for humbling the house of Austria. He concluded treaties with the Dutch republic and the duke of Savoy, proclaimed war against Spain, and in a very short space equipped five armies to act at once in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. The balance now turned against the imperialists ; the duke of Saxe Weimar proved a worthy successor to the king of Sweden, and Banier restored the lustre of the Swedish arms by the victory he gained over the elector of Saxony at Wislock. The death of the emperor Ferdinand II. (a. d. 1637), and the accession of his son Ferdi nand III., made little alteration in the state of the war; the victorious leaders of the confederates invaded the hereditary dominions of Austria, but in the midst of their triumphant career, the duke of Saxe Weimar fell a victim to poison (a. d. 1639), said to have been administered by an emissary of Richelieu, for the cardinal had reason to fear that the prince's patriotism would prove a serious obstacle to the aggrandisement of the French power. The war was still continued, but though the imperialists were generally worsted, disunion crept into the councils of the confederates, and prevented them from improving their advantages. Banier's death might have proved their ruin, had he not been succeeded by Torstenson, a general of scarcely"], [198, "184 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. inferior abilities. While the Swedes, under their new leader, maintained their former eminence in Germany, and gained a complete victory at Leipsic, almost on the very ground where Gustavus had triumphed ; the French were equally successful in Spain, having reduced Colioure and Perpignan*. The death of Richelieu, and his master, Louis XIII., the accession of the infant Louis XIV. (a.d. 1643), and some changes in Germany, for a time inclined the Swedes to peace; but when it was found that Cardinal Mazarine had resolved to pursue Richelieu's plans, and that France possessed such generals as Conde and Turenne, the hopes of the confederates were once \u25a0 more revived, and the Swedes had even the courage to provoke a fresh enemy, by invading the dominions of Denmark. After several vicissitudes, the triumph of the confederates was so decided, that the emperor found it necessary to solicit terms of peace. After long and tedious negotiations, which varied according to the vicissitudes of the war, the celebrated Peace of Westphalia was signed at Munster (a. d. 1648), and became a fundamental law of the empire. While the protestant cause was thus triumphant in Germany, England was convulsed by civil war. The failure of the expedition to relieve Rochelle, and the complete overthrow of the huguenots in France, had caused great discontent in England ; and embittered the dispute between the king and his parliament, respecting the extent of the royal prerogative. The Petition of Right, extorted from Charles I., might have laid the foundation of a constitutional monarchy, had the king adhered strictly to its spirit ; but he continued to levy taxes by his own authority, and when the remonstrances of the Commons became too ener- getic, he dissolved the parliament (a.d. 1629), with a fixed resolution never to call another, until he should see signs of a more compliant disposition in the nation. Religious disputes aggravated these political animosities. When the ecclesiastical jurisdiction was wrested from the see of Rome, the people of * Richelieu had just detected and punished a conspiracy, when Perpignan was taken. He sent intelligence of both events to Louis XIII., in the following laconic letter : \" Sire, your enemies are dead, and your troops in possession of Perpignan.\""], [199, "ADMINISTRATION OF RICHELIEU AND MAZARINE. 185 England had submitted to a jurisdiction no less arbitrary in the prince, and the sovereign obtained absolute power in all affairs relative to the government of the church and the consciences of the people. An ecclesiastical tribunal, called the High Com mission Court, was established under the immediate direction of the crown. Its judges enforced conformity with established ceremonies by fines and imprisonment. There were many who thought the English reformation incomplete ; they deemed that the church had not been sufficiently purified from Romish errors, and they wished for the simpler forms of worship that had been established in Scotland and Germany. Many of the puritans, as these reformers were called, had more justifiable reason for discontent ; they regarded the ecclesiastical sovereignty of the monarch as dangerous to general liberty, and they were anxious to transfer a portion of the authority to parliament. About this time, a sect, called from their founder the Arminians, had rejected the strict doctrines of predestination and absolute decrees, maintained by the first reformers. Their number, in England, was yet small, but by the favour of James and Charles, some who held the Arminian doctrines were advanced to the highest dignities of the church, and formed the majority of the bench of bishops. They, in return for this countenance, inculcated the doctrines of passive obedience and unconditional submission to princes. Hence, Arminianism was regarded by the patriots in the House of Commons, with as much horror as popery, and the preacher of either doctrine, was voted a capital enemy to the state. The success of Charles I. in his struggle with the Commons, depended very much upon the character of his ministers. The chief of these were Wentworth, earl of Strafford, a deserter from the popular party, and Laud, archbishop of Canterbury; they were both men of arbitrary principles, and Strafford, especially, was very unscrupulous in the use of means to gain a favourite end. Without any regard to the Petition of Right, which was directly opposed to such measures, tonnage, poundage, and other taxes were levied ; the penal laws against catholics were suspended, on the payment of stipulated sums ; and such exten sive jurisdiction given to those arbitrary tribunals, the courts of"], [200, "186 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. Star Chamber and High Commission, that the ordinary con stitutional administration of justice almost entirely ceased. While these innovations spread secret discontent throughout England, Laud's efforts to model the Scottish church after the English form, produced a dangerous outbreak in Scotland. The attempt to introduce a liturgy, similar to that used in the English church, provoked a formidable riot ; and finally, \" The Solemn League and Covenant,\" a bond of confederation for the preservation of the national religion was signed by a vast number of the higher and lower classes (a. d. 1638). Cardinal Richelieu, fearing that the English government might oppose his designs on the Low Countries, and aware that he was disliked by the English queen, Henrietta, secretly encouraged the Scottish covenanters, and supplied their leaders with money, which, in spite of their exaggerated pretensions to patriotism and sanctity, they did not scruple to accept. Armies were levied, but neither party wished to merit the imputation of commencing civil war. A treaty was concluded at Berwick (a. d. 1639), by which Charles displeased his friends, who thought that he made concessions unworthy of a prince, and did not conciliate his opponents, who were resolved to be satisfied with nothing less than his full acceptance of the covenant. As might have been foreseen, the treaty of Berwick proved to be merely a suspension of arms. Strafford and Laud considered the rebellion of the Scots to be so manifest, that they deemed the people of England could, not entertain a doubt on the subject, and that the king would be supported in its suppression by a parliament. Charles adopted the same opinions, and called a parliament, hoping to obtain a sufficient grant for carrying on the war (a.d. 1640); but the House of Commons, postponing all consideration of taxes, applied itself directly to the redress of grievances, and an examination of the recent measures of the government. Incensed by this conduct, Charles dissolved the parliament, and attempted to raise money by new and unconstitutional expedients. The Scotch, not waiting to be attacked, crossed the borders, defeated the earl of North umberland at Newburn, and occupied Newcastle and Durham. The king was unable to cope with them in the field, and he"], [201, "ADMINISTRATION OF RICHELIEU AND MAZARINE. 187 therefore entered into a treaty, by which he agreed to provide subsistence for the hostile army, until terms of pacification could be arranged. A new parliament was convoked, and, on the very first day of its meeting, the House of Commons manifested its uncomplying disposition, by choosing as its Speaker, a vehement opponent of the court. A more important and decisive step, was the impeachment of the earl of Strafford and Archbishop Laud on a charge of high treason; after which, the armistice with the Scottish army was prolonged, and the Scots described not as enemies or rebels, but brethren ! Straf ford's trial soon engrossed public attention; he was condemned to death by an act of attainder, and Charles, after a long delay, was forced to consent to the public execution of his favourite minister. An attempt was next made to exclude the bishops from parliament ; a bill for the purpose passed the Commons, but was rejected by the Lords ; as, however, the public excite ment continued, the bishops resolved to abstain from further attending their duty in parliament, and twelve of them published a protest, declaring everything null and void that should be determined during their absence. For this ill-advised pro ceeding, they were accused of high-treason, and committed to the Tower (a.d. 1641). Charles, dismayed by the hostility of the English, resolved to seek a reconciliation with his Scottish subjects, and for this purpose, undertook a journey to Edinburgh. His measures were not well suited to effect his object, and before anything satisfactory could be done, the insurrection of the Irish catholics produced a change in the position of parties most fatal to the royal interests. Few events have been so much misrepresented as the Irish civil war, and in order to view it correctly, we must go back to an earlier period of history. The Norman settlers in Ireland paid but a nominal allegiance to the English crown, the most powerful of them acted as independent princes, and adopted the customs of the native Irish. The Tudor monarchs were anxious to break the power of this aristocracy, which was as injurious to the national happi ness, as it was opposed to the royal power; but unfortunately, they combined this object with the reform of religion, and with"], [202, "188 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. a system of confiscation, equally impolitic and unjust. The Irish lords took up arms, to defend at once their religion and their power ; they were defeated by Elizabeth's generals, and many of them were deprived of their estates, which were shared among English colonists. James I., under the pretence of a meditated rebellion, confiscated the greater part of the province of Ulster, and deprived all the innocent vassals of their property, for the unproved guilt of their chiefs. Property was rendered still more insecure by an inquisition into titles, on the legal pretence, that the right to land belongs primarily to the king, and consequently, that every estate ought to be forfeited, for which a royal grant could not be produced. The effect of this principle would be, not only to strip all the native Irish of their estates, but also to confiscate the lands belonging to the greater part of the lords descended from the companions of Strongbow and Henry II. When Strafford became lord-lieutenant of Ireland, he began to enforce the system of confiscation, with a rigour which exceeded all former precedent. Every legal pretext was employed to expel the Irish from their possessions, and transfer them to strangers; judges were bribed, juries threatened, and witnesses suborned, with the most shameless effrontery. The English nation was induced to countenance this injustice, by the belief that it would be useful to substitute a more noble and civilized race of men for the barbarous Irish; though, in fact, the new settlers were for the most part rapacious adventurers, or indigent rabble. Religious intolerance was united to political wrongs ; catholics were excluded from all public offices and the acquisition of landed property; their churches and chapels were violently closed, their clergy expelled, and their children given to protestant - guardians. They applied to the king for protection, and gave a large sum for a charter of graces, which would secure their persons, property, and religion. Charles took the money, but refused the graces ; instigated by Strafford, who had devised a plan for rendering his master absolutely despotic in Ireland, as a preparatory step to his becoming supreme in England. The success of the Scots, in securing their national religion, and placing restrictions on the royal power, induced many of"], [203, "ADMINISTRATION OF RICHELIEU AND MAZARINE. 189 the Irish lords to devise a plan for obtaining similar advantages. Accident precipitated an outbreak ; the Ulster Irish, who had been expelled from their lands, hastened to attack the settlers that occupied them as intruders, and they sullied their cause by many acts of violence, which were easily exaggerated by persons who had derived much profit and expected more, from the trade of confiscation. The English House of Commons regarded the Irish as a degraded and conquered people ; they deemed their efforts acts of treason, not so much against royal power as English supremacy, while the difference of religion embittered this feeling of national pride, and rendered a peaceful termi- nation of the contest hopeless. It was studiously reported that Charles himself had instigated this revolt, in order to obtain unlimited power by aid of the catholics: to refute this sus- picion, he entrusted the conduct of Irish affairs to the English parliament ; and that body, with inconceivable precipitation, resolved that the catholic religion should no longer be tolerated in Ireland; that two millions and a half of acres should be confiscated to pay the expenses of the war, and that no quarter should be given to the insurgents or their adherents. These ordinances led to a civil war, whose history may be told in a few words : the Irish catholics, after having gained possession of nearly the entire kingdom, were broken into parties, more opposed to each other than to the common enemy : in the midst of this disunion, Cromwell, with a mere handful of men, conquered them in detail, and gave their estates to his victorious followers. The new settlers were confirmed in their possession after the restoration of Charles II., and the greater part of the ancient Irish landowners were reduced to beggary. Charles gained little by sacrificing the Irish to the parliament; finding that his concessions only provoked fresh demands, he attempted to arrest five of the leading members for high-treason, but the popular indignation compelled him to abandon the charge, and soon after to quit the capital. Negotiations were tried to avert the horrors of civil war, but the requisitions of the Commons, if granted, would have destroyed all royal authority, and Charles, on the 25th of August, 1642, caused the royal standard to be raised at Nottingham. War immediately com-"], [204, "190 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. menced ; it was conducted with spirit, and was at first favourable to the king. The English parliament, alarmed at the progress of Charles, entered into an alliance with the Scottish covenanters, and on the 15th of January, 1644, a Scotch auxiliary army, commanded by General Leslie, entered England. Fairfax, the parliamentary leader in the north, united his forces to those of Leslie, and both generals immediately laid siege to York. Prince Rupert, the son of the unfortunate elector-palatine, hasted to the relief of this important city, and effected a junction with the army of the marquis of Newcastle. Fairfax and Leslie retired to Marston Moor, whither they were followed by the royalists, who were urged to this rash proceeding by the fiery Rupert. Fifty thousand British combatants engaged on this occasion in mutual slaughter ; the victory was long undecided ; but, finally, the skill of Lieutenant-General Cromwell prevailed over the rash valour of Rupert, and the royalists were signally defeated, with the loss of all their baggage and artillery. A second defeat, at Newbury, so weakened the royal cause, that the king must have been forced to immediate submission, but for the divisions that arose among his adversaries. The Presbyterians and the Independents had combined against the Church of England as their common enemy ; but when episcopacy was abolished, the latter saw with great indignation the Presbyterian efforts to establish a system of ecclesiastical tyranny, differing from the papal only in form, the power being lodged in the general assembly of the clergy instead of a sinole head. The Presbyterians had the majority in parliament, but the great bulk of the army favoured the views of the Inde pendents, which were also supported by some of the most active members of the House of Commons. A law, called the Self-denying Ordinance, prohibiting members of parliament from holding military commissions, gave the greater part of the army into the hands of the Independents, especially, as an excep tion was made in favour of Oliver Cromwell, their principal leader. The battle of Naseby was decided in favour of the parliamentarians, principally by Cromwell's prudence and valour an event which gave so much strength to his party, that the Presbyterian majority in the House of Commons feared to accept"], [205, "191 ADMINISTRATION OF RICHELIEU AND MAZARINE. the king's proposals for an accommodation, contrary to their open professions and secret wishes. Meanwhile Charles, being unable to keep the rfield, threw himself on the mercy of his Scottish subjects ; and having opened negotiations with their leader, through the French ambassador, ventured on the faith of uncertain promises to present himself in their camp. He had the mortification to find himself treated as a prisoner, while all the towns and fortresses that had hitherto supported his cause fell into the hands of the parliament. The war was at an end, but civil dissensions raged with more fury than ever. The Presbyterians and Independents were each anxious to gain the king over to their side ; and the former, by a treaty with the Scots, gained possession of his person. Scarcely had they acquired this advantage, when the discontent of the army threatened them with unexpected danger; Cromwell encouraged the soldiers to resist the orders of the parliament, and by a bold measure gave fresh confidence to his party. Cornet Joyce, acting under his orders, removed the king from Holmby House, and brought him to the army. Cromwell and his friends made such a judicious use of the advantage thus obtained, that the Presbyterian party soon lost all its influence. The behaviour of Charles at this crisis was very injudicious; he negotiated with both parties, and, by his obvious insincerity, displeased all. Finally, he attempted to escape ; but seeking shelter in the Isle of Wight, he was seized by its governor, Hammond, and from that moment Cromwell became the master of his fate. Another opportunity of escaping from the perils that surrounded him was offered to the king; the Scotch took up arms in his favour, but they were routed by Cromwell with great slaughter, and all hopes from their assistance destroyed. But the parliament having reason to dread Cromwell's ambition, opened negotiations with the king on receiving the news of this victory, and the wisest of the royal counsellors entreated their master to seize this opportunity of concluding a treaty. Unfor tunately he hesitated and delayed the arrangements for more than three months, until the army once more took possession of his person, and conveyed him to Hurst. The two Houses, indeed voted that the royal concessions were sufficient grounds"], [206, "192 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. for settling the peace of the kingdom ; but two days afterwards the avenues to the House of Commons were beset with soldiers, and all the members supposed favourable to the king forcibly prevented from taking their seats. In this diminished house the resolutions leading to a reconciliation with the king were revoked, and proposals wTere made for bringing him to a public trial. The final resolution for impeaching the king of high treason, before a court of justice, constituted for the purpose, was adopted by the House of Commons, (January 2, 1649) : it was at once rejected by the Lords ; but their opposition was disregarded, and the court regularly constituted. The form of trial was but a solemn mockery ; Charles w-ith great spirit refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court, upon which some witnesses were called, to prove what every body knew-, that he had appeared at the head of his army, which his judges declared to be treason against the people, and a crime worthy of death. Sentence was pronounced on the 27th of January ; and, on the 30th of the same month, the misguided and unhappy Charles was beheaded in front of Whitehall, amid the unaffected sympathy of crowds of spectators. The death of Charles was followed by the usurpation of Cromwell, and Great Britain was subjected to a despotism more galling and severe than that of any monarch who ever swayed its sceptre. Section VIIL \u2014 Formation of the States-system in the Northern Kingdoms of Europe. The revolutions in the Northern kingdoms during the progress of the Reformation were scarcely less important than those in central Europe. Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, united by the treaty of Calmar, were never blended into a uniform govern ment : the Swedish nobles kept their country in continued agitation ; without severing the union, they chose administrators of the kingdom whose allegiance to the crown of Denmark was merely nominal. Christian II., a tyrannical prince, resolved to destroy the Swedish independence, he overthrew the adminis-"], [207, "STATES-SYSTEM OF THE NORTH. 193 trator at the battle of Bagesund, and had the ceremony of his coronation performed at Stockholm (a. d. 1520). A few days after this solemnity, Christian perfidiously violated the amnesty he had published ; and to gratify the vengeance of the arch bishop of Upsal, whom the Swedes had deposed, caused ninety four of the principal nobles to be publicly executed. This massacre was the signal for a revolution ; Gustavus Vasa, son of one of the murdered nobles, escaped to the mountains of Dalecarlia, and supported by the hardy peasants of that province, proclaimed the freedom of his country. Victory crowned his efforts, and he finally became king of Sweden (a. d. 1523). Christian II. was deposed by the Danes, and the crown con ferred on his uncle Frederic ; he wandered about for some years, vainly seeking support, but was finally seized by his subjects, and thrown into a prison, where he ended his days. The Danish monarchs, for nearly half a century, renewed their pretensions to the Swedish throne ; but finding that their efforts only exhausted their own resources, they recognised the independence of Sweden by the treaty of Stettin (a. d. 1570). Denmark thus lost the ascendancy which it had long maintained, and it wTas further injured by a disastrous change in its internal constitution. The aristocracy established a vicious supremacy over the prerogatives of the crowTi and the rights of the people. The senate, composed entirely of nobles, seized on all the authority of the state ; the national assemblies ceased to be convoked ; the elections of the kings were confined to the aristocratic order, and the royal power was restricted by capitulations, which the senate prescribed to the kings on their accession to the throne. It was in the reign of Frederic I., the uncle and successor of the tyrannical Christian, that the principles of the Reformation were first established in Denmark. The king invited several of Luther's disciples to preach the new doctrines in his kingdom ; he openly professed them himself, granted liberty of conscience to all his subjects, and sanctioned the marriages of priests throughout his dominions. Christian III. completed the reli gious revolution : in a general assembly of the states, he procured the abrogation of episcopacy, and the suppression of the Romish worship (a.d. 1536). The castles, fortresses, and vast domains K"], [208, "194 TnE reformation, and STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. of the bishops, were reunited to the crown; and the rest of their revenues applied to the maintenance of protestant ministers, the purposes of general education, and the relief of the poor. From Denmark the revolution extended to Norway ; and about the same time this kingdom, having supported the deposed Christian II., was deprived of its independence, and reduced to a Danish province. Christian IV. was distinguished among the northern sovereigns by the superiority of his talents, and the zeal that he showed in reforming the different branches of the administration. In his reign the Danes first directed their attention to Asiatic trade, and founded an East India Company ; a commercial establish ment was formed at v Tranquebar, on the coast of Coromandel, which was ceded to the company by the rajah of Tanjorc. Several large manufactories were established, and many cities founded by this wise monarch ; who wTas also a judicious patron of science and literature. He was less successful in his wars against Austria and Sweden, but this was owing rather to the restrictions which the nobles had placed on his power, than to any want of talent. Sweden, from having been subject to Denmark, rose to be its successful rival, and even menaced its total overthrow. It owed this preponderance to two of the greatest men of the period, Gustavus Vasa, and Gustavus Adolphus. After Vasa had liberated his country, he was raised to the throne, and by his wise government justified the choice of the nation. He directed his attention both to the political and religious reformation of the country ; instead of the aristocratic senate he introduced a Diet, composed of the different orders of the state, and by his influence wTith the Commons, introduced Lutheranism, though opposed by the bishops and nobles. He also established the hereditary succession of the crown, which was extended to females in the reign of his son Charles IX. Gustavus Adolphus, the grandson of Vasa, raised Sweden to the summit of its greatness. Involved in wars at his accession (a. d. 1611), he gained signal advantages over the Russians and Poles, which so extended his fame, that he was chosen, as we have seen, to be the leader of the protestant confederacy against the House of Austria. After a glorious career of two years and"], [209, "195 STATES-SYSTEM OF THE NORTH. a half, he fell in the battle of Lutzen ; but the victory which the Swedes won after his death was chiefly owing to his skilful arrangements. The war was continued under the minority of Christina, and brought to a successful issue ; as was also the war waged at the same time against Denmark. By the peace of Bromsebro (a. d. 1645), Sweden obtained the free navigation of the Sound, and the cession of several important islands in the Baltic. Prussia, under the electors of Brandenburg, gradually increased in strength and power, especially during the administration of Frederic William, the true founder of the greatness of his house. His abilities were particularly conspicuous in the protestant wars of Germany ; and he obtained such an accession of territory by the treaty of Westphalia, that his son Frederic assumed the title of king of Prussia. The dismemberment of Livonia led to a fierce struggle between the northern powers, each of which sought a portion of the spoil. Russia, which had slowly acquired consistency, obtained a consi derable portion, which, however, it was forced to yield to Poland. After having long submitted to the degrading yoke of the Mongols, the grand-dukes of Moscow, strengthened by the union of several small principalities, began to asjnre after inde pendence, which was achieved by Iwan III. This able ruler, having refused to pay the customary tribute to the barbarians, was attacked by the khan of the Golden Horde, as the leading sept of the Mongols was denominated. Instead of acting on the defensive, Iwan sent a body of troops into the very centre of the horde, and ruined all their establishments on the Volga. So great were the losses of the Mongols, that the Golden Horde disappeared, and left no traces but a few feeble tribes. Iwan IV. laboured to civilize the empire acquired by the valour of his predecessors : he invited artisans from England and Germany, established a printing-press at Moscow, and raised the standing army of the Strelitzes to curb his turbulent nobles. It was in his reign that Siberia was discovered and annexed to the Russian dominions, but the complete reduction of that country belongs to the reign of his son Fedor (a. d. 1587), who founded the city of Tobolsk. k 2"], [210, "196 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. On the death of Fedor, without any issue (a. d. 1598), Russia was involved in a series of calamitous civil wars, which ended in the elevation of Michael Fedrowetsch to the crown. He found his dominions exhausted by the late commotions, and could only procure peace from Sweden and Poland by the cession of many valuable provinces (a. d. 1634). During the reigns of the Jagellons, Poland was one of the most flourishing northern powers. The Reformation was favoured by Sigismond Augustus II., the last of this dynasty ; but the want of a middle order of society, which has ever been the cause of Polish misery, prevented evangelical principles from taking deep root in the country, and producing the benefits that had resulted from them in other states. When the male line of the Jagellons became extinct on the death of Sigismond (a. d. 1572), the throne of Poland became elective (without any restriction\"), and the right of voting was given to all the nobles, who met in arms to choose a sovereign. These elections were generally marked with violence and bloodshed ; but though the nobles were divided among themselves, they readily united to restrict the royal authority ; every sovereign, on his accession, was obliged to sign certain capitulations, which greatly limited his rule, and secured the chief powers of the state to the aristocracy. Under its new constitution, Poland was internally weak and miserable, though some of its monarchs still distinguished them selves by foreign conquests, especially Vladislaus IV., who wrested the duchy of Smolcnsko fron; Russia. Section IX. \u2014 Progress of the Turkish Poiver in Europe. The successors of Mohammed II. on the throne of Constan tinople imitated the vigorous policy of that conqueror, and for nearly a century were the terror of Christendom. Bayezid II. subdued Bessarabia, and acquired some important provinces in Asia. He was forced to resign the throne, by his son Selim (a.d. 1510), and was murdered in prison. Selim I., surnamed Gavuz, or the Savage, was obliged to maintain the throne he had so criminally gained, by a series of sanguinary wars with the \u2022 See page 134."], [211, "197 PROGRESS OF THE TURKISH POWER IN EUROPE. other members of his family. Having triumphed over these competitors, he turned his arms against the Persians, and gained a complete victory over Ismael Sofi at Tabriz (a.d. 1514). In consequence of this and other successes, Diarbekr and several other provinces beyond the Tigris were annexed to the Turkish empire. The Mameluke Sultans of Egypt having assisted the Persians in this war, Selim led an army into Syria, and encountered Sultan Gauri near Aleppo. After a sanguinary engagement, the Mamelukes were defeated and their leader slain, upon which Aleppo and Damascus submitted to the Turks. This success opened the way for invading Egypt : Tiiman Bey, who had been elected, sultan in place of Gauri, assembled the remnants of the Mamelukes under the walls of Cairo, and having procured some auxiliary forces from the Arabs, prepared to meet the enemy. Selim advanced steadily, and attacked the hostile camp. The battle was obstinate and bloody, but the superior fire of the Turkish artillery, which was served principally by Christian gunners, decided the fate of the day, and Tiiman Bey, after having done everything that could be expected from an able officer and a brave warrior, was driven into Cairo (a. d. 151-7). Selim stormed the city ; but Tiiman, not yet disheartened, fled across the Nile, and by incredible exertions once more collected an army. The Turks pursued him closely, and forced him to a final engagem ent, in which the Mamelukes were utterly routed, and their gallant sultan taken prisoner. Selim was at first disposed to spare the captive, but his officers, who feared and envied Tiiman, persuaded him that such clemency might inspire the Mamelukes with the hope of recovering their dominions, and the unfortunate sultan was hanged at the principal gate of Cairo. Soleyman, usually surnamed the Magnificent, succeeded his father Selim, and emulous of the fame acquired by the conquest of Eoypt, resolved to turn his arms against the princes of Christendom. Hungary, during the reign of Matthew Corvinus, had become a powerful and flourishing kingdom. Inspired by the example of his father, the renowned Hunniades, Corvinus wrested Bosnia from the Turks, and maintained his supremacy over Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia. But during the"], [212, "198 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. reigns of his indolent successors, Uladislaus II. and Louis, who were also kings of Bohemia, Hungary was distracted by factions and ravaged by the Turks. Soleyman took advantage of the minority of Louis, and the weakness of Hungary, to invade the kingdom. He captured, with little difficulty, the important fortress of Belgrade, justly deemed the bulwark of Christian Europe (a. d. 1521). Inspired by his first success, he returned to the attack ; having traversed the Danube and the Drave, without meeting any resistance, he encountered the Christians in the field of Mohatz, and gained over them one of the most signal victories that the Turks ever won (a. d. 1526). King Louis, and the principal part of the Hungarian nobility, fell in this fatal battle, the entire country was laid at the mercy of the invaders, but Soleyman, instead of securing a permanent con quest, laid waste the land with fire and sword, and carried myriads of the inhabitants as slaves to Constantinople. A triumph of even greater importance was gained by the Turks during the Hungarian war. Rhodes, the seat of the heroic knights of St. John, was besieged by Soleyman's vizier. All the arts of assault and defence that had yet been devised by human ingenuity were used in this siege, which lasted more than five months. The assailants and the garrison fought with such fury that it seemed a contest rather for the empire of the world than the possession of a single city. The sultan himself came in person to superintend the operations of his army, while the knights were not only neglected by the Christian powers, but exposed to the open hostilities of the Venetians. They protracted their resistance until every wall and bulwark had crumbled beneath the overwhelming fire of the Turkish batteries, when they surrendered on honourable conditions ; and on Christ mas day (a. d. 1522), Soleyman made his triumphant entry into what had been a city, but was now a shapeless mass of ruins. On the death of Louis, Ferdinand of Austria, who had married the sister of the unfortunate monarch, claimed the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia. He received quiet possession of the latter kingdom ; but the Hungarians chose for their sovereign, John Zapolya, prince palatine of Transylvania."], [213, "199 PROGRESS OF THE TURKISH POWER IN EUROPE. Zapolya finding himself unable to resist the power of Ferdinand, claimed the protection of the Turks. Soleyman marched in person to his aid, and not satisfied with expelling the Austrians from Hungary, pursued them into their own country and laid siege to Vienna (a. d. 1529). He failod in this enterprise, and was compelled to retreat, after having lost eighty thousand men. The emperor, Charles V., alarmed at the progress of the Turks, tried to form a general confederation of the German princes against them, but found that the troubles occasioned by the progress of the Reformation would prevent any cordial union. He resolved, however, to check the growth of their naval power in the Mediterranean, where Khair-ed-din *, or Barbarossa, a pirate whom Soleyman had taken into his service, captured Tunis and Algiers, and was collecting a formidable naval force. Charles took advantage of Soleyman's being engaged in con quering the pachalick of Bagdad from the Persians, to invade Africa, where he made himself master of Tunis. Soleyman, returning victorious from Asia, was so enraged at his losses in Africa, that he resolved to attempt the conquest of Italy. The imprudence of a Venetian captain turned the wrath of the sultan upon the republic of Venice ; he attacked two Turkish galleys in the Adriatic, for some mistake about their signals, and satisfaction being refused, Soleyman proclaimed war. But while thus engaged in the west, Soleyman did not neglect the enlargement of his eastern dominions. His generals conquered the whole of Arabia, and his admirals issuing from the Red Sea, attacked, but without success, the Portuguese dominions in India. In the mean time, the Venetian senate entered into an alliance with the emperor Charles V., and the pope Paul III. ; their united navies were placed under the command of the celebrated Doria, but his success was far from accordino- with the expectations that the allies had formed. The war, however, led to no decisive result ; it was suspended by occasional truces, during which Soleyman took the oppor tunity of enlarging his Asiatic dominions at the expense of Persia. * Khair-ed-din signifies \" the goodness of the faith.\" This terror of the Christians was named Barba-rossa, on account of his \" red beard.\""], [214, "200 THE REFORMATION, AND STATES-SYSTEM OF EUROPE. The knights of St. John, expelled from Rhodes, obtained a settlement in the island of Malta ; they directed their attention to naval affairs, and inflicted severe damages on the Turks by sea. Soleyman, roused by the complaints of his subjects, resolved that Malta should share the fate of Rhodes, and collected all his forces for the siege (a. d. 1565). The knights maintained their character for obstinate valour with more success than on the former occasion ; after a sanguinary contest of five months, the Turks were forced to retire, with the loss of twenty four thousand men and all their artillery. Soleyman prepared to take revenge by completing the conquest of Hungary, but while besieging Sigeth, he fell a victim to disease, produced by old age and fatigue (a. d. 1566), after having raised the Turkish empire to the highest pitch of its greatness. Selim II., soon after his accession, made peace with the Germans and Persians, but renewed war with the Venetians, from whom he took the important island of Cyprus (a.d. 1571). But while the Turkish army was thus engaged, their fleet was utterly destroyed in the battle of Lepanto, by the allied Venetian, imperial, and papal navy. The allies neglected to improve their victory, and Selim soon repaired his losses. But this sultan sunk into the usual indolence of oriental sove reigns, his successors followed his example, and the Ottoman power began rapidly to decline. The Austrian rulers became convinced of the impolicy of harsh measures, and con ceded to the Hungarians full security for their political and religious liberties, at the diet of Presburg ; Hungary was thence forth united to Austria, and the last war, directly resulting from the Reformation, happily terminated."], [215, "201 CHAPTER VII. THE AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. Section I. \u2014 State of the Continental Kingdom's after the Peace of Westphalia. Though the treaty of Westphalia restored tranquillity to northern Europe and Germany, France and Spain continued the war in which they had originally but a secondary share, with all the obstinacy of principals. At the same time, France was distracted by civil broils less fatal than those of England, but scarcely less sanguinary. The prime mover in these dis turbances was the coadjutor-archbishop of Paris, afterwards known as the Cardinal de Retz ; he wished to gain the post of prime minister from Cardinal Mazarine, and he induced several princes of the blood, with a large portion of the nobility, to espouse his quarrel. The parliaments of France resembled those of England only in names ; they were colleges of justice, not legislative assemblies, and the members purchased their seats. This was the body with which Retz commenced his operations ; instigated by the ambitious prelate, the parliament of Paris thwarted all the measures of the queen-regent and her minister, until Anne of Austria, irritated by such factious opposition, ordered the president and one of the most violent councillors to be arrested. Her orders were scarcely executed when the populace arose, barricadoed the streets, threatened the cardinal and the regent, and procured the release of the prisoners. Alarmed by the repetition of similar outrages, the queen, attended by her children and her minister, retired from Paris to St. Germains, where their distress was so great that they were obliged to pawn the crown jewels to procure the common necessaries of life. These intrigues led to a desultory civil war, which began to assume a serious aspect after the arrest of the K 3"], [216, "202 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. ambitious duke of Conde, who had repeatedly insulted the queen and the cardinal ; the factious took up arms in all the provinces ; and the duke of Orleans, uncle to the young king, placed himself at the head of the malcontents (a. d. 1650). Mazarine was unable to resist the confederacy; he liberated Conde and his associates, in the vain hope of conciliating their favour, but was obliged to fly to Cologne, where he continued to govern the queen-regent as if he had never quitted Paris. By his intrigues, which were now seconded by de Retz, the duke of Bouillon, and his brother Turenne, were detached from the confederates, and by their aid Mazarine was enabled to enter the kingdom at the head of an army, and resume his former authority. Conde, proclaimed a traitor by the parliament of Paris, threw himself upon the protection of Spain, and obtained from that power a body of troops, with which he pursued the court from province to province, and finally entered Paris. Turenne, who commanded the royal forces, brought the young king within sight of his capital ; and Louis witnessed a fierce conflict in the suburb of St. Antoine, which terminated in the defeat of his army. Encouraged by this success, the parliament of Paris proclaimed the duke of Orleans u lieutenant-general of the kingdom,\" and the prince of Conde, \" commander-in-chief of the armies of France.\" But the danger with which these appointments threatened the monarch)', was averted equally by the rashness of Conde and the prudence of the king. Conde instigated a tumult, in which several citizens lost their lives ; Louis con ciliated his subjects by sending the cardinal into temporary exile, and was received into his capital with the loudest accla mations. No sooner was the royal authority re-established, than Mazarine was recalled and invested with more than his former power. During these commotions, the Spaniards had recovered many of the places which they had previously lost to the French, and Louis de Haro, who governed Spain and Philip IV., as absolutely as Mazarine did France and its youthful sovereign, hoped by means of Conde's great military talents to brino- the war to a triumphant issue. But the French found a general in"], [217, "203 THE CONTINENT AFTER THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA. Marshal Turenne, who was more than a rival for Conde ; he compelled the Spaniards to raise the siege of Arras, and seized all their baggage, artillery, and ammunition (a. d. 1656). He was himself soon after compelled to raise the siege of Valen ciennes, but he made a masterly retreat as honourable as a victory, and even took the town of Capelle in the presence of his enemies. Still the fortune of the war was doubtful, when Mazarine, by flattering the passions of the usurper Cromwell, engaged Eng land to take a share in the contest. Dunkirk, the strongest town in Flanders, first engaged the attention of the allies ; the English blockaded it by sea, Turenne, with an auxiliary British force united to the French army, besieged it by land (a. d. 1656). The Spaniards sent an army to its relief; Turenne did not decline an engagement ; the obstinate valour of the English, combined with the impetuosity of the French troops, procured him a decided victory; Dunkirk surrendered in a few days, and was given to the English according to treaty, while France obtained possession of the strongest towns in Flanders. Peace was now necessary to Spain, and it was also essential to the success of Mazarine's favourite policy ; the jsrocuring for the House of Bourbon the eventual succession to the Spanish monarchy, by uniting King Louis to the infanta Maria Theresa. The preliminaries were adjusted by Mazarine and Louis de Haro, in person, at a conference in the Pyrenees, and France obtained an extent of territory and the jirospect of an inherit ance, which soon made it formidable to the rest of Europe. About a year after the conclusion of this treaty, Mazarine died (a.d. 1661); and Louis, who had borne the ministerial yoke with secret impatience, took the reins of government into his own hands. Germany, exhausted by tedious wars, remained undisturbed after the peace of Westphalia until the death of Ferdinand III. (a.d. 1657), when the Diet was agitated by fierce debates respecting the choice of a successor. Recent events had shown how dangerous was the ambition of the House of Austria to the independence of the minor states, and several of the electors wished to have as their head some monarch whose hereditary dominions would not be of sufficient importance to raise him"], [218, "204 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. above the control of the Diet. But these considerations were forced to yield to more pressing circumstances ; the presence of the Turks in Buda, of the French in Alsace, and of the Swedes in Pomerania, required a powerful sovereign to prevent further encroachments ; and Leopold, the son of the late emperor, was unanimously chosen. His first measure was to form an alliance with Poland and Denmark against Sweden, a power which, ever since the victorious career of Gustavus Adolphus, menaced the independence of the neighbouring states. We have already mentioned that the renowned Gustavus was succeeded by his daughter Christina. She was fondly attached to study, and assembled in her court the most distin guished professors of science, literature, and the fine arts. Her favourite pursuits were, however, too antiquated and abstruse for practical life, she was pedantic rather than wise, and her great learning was never applied to a useful end. She consented to the peace of Westphalia, not from any regard for the tran quillity of Europe or her own kingdom, but simply to indulge her passion for study, with which the cares of state interfered. The Swedish senate felt little sympathy in the learned pursuits of their sovereign ; they pressed her to marry her cousin, Charles Gustavus, for whom she had been designed in her infancy, but Christina dreaded to give herself a master, and she only nominated this prince her successor. The states renewed their importunity, and Christina offered to resign the crown to her cousin ; after some delay, occasioned by reasonable suspicions of her sincerity, she carried her design into execution, and abdicated in favour of Charles Gustavus, who ascended the throne under the title of Charles X. (a. d. 1654). The remainder of' Christina's life was disgraceful to her character. Designing to fix her residence at Rome, she renounced Luther anism, and embraced the catholic faith at Innspruck, not because she deemed it the preferable religion, but because she thouo-ht it convenient to conform to the tenets of the people with whom she intended to reside. Her profligate life, iier want of any valuable information, and her loss of power, soon rendered her contemptible in Italy; she made two journeys into France, where she was received with much respect, until her infamous"], [219, "205 THE CONTINENT AFTER THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA. conduct excited general abhorrence. In a fit of jealousy, she commanded one of her. paramours to be assassinated in the great gallery of Fontainebleau, and almost in her very presence (a. d. 1657). This atrocious violation of the laws of nature and of nations, perpetrated in the midst of a civilized kingdom, and a court that piqued itself on refinement, was allowed to pass over without judicial inquiry ; but it excited such universal detesta tion, that Christina was forced to quit France and seek refuge in Italy. There the remainder of her life was spent in sensual indulgence and literary conversation, if such a term can be applied to the language of a capricious woman, admiring many things for which she had no taste, and talking about others which she did not understand. While Christina was thus disgracing her sex and country, Charles X. indulged the martial spirit of his people, by declaring war against Poland. After the death of Sigis mond III. (a. d. 1632), his son Ladislaus was elected to the throne, and proved to be a prince of great courage and capacity. He gained several victories over the Russians and the Turks, he forced the Swedes to resign the places which Gustavus Adolphus had seized in Prussia, but unfortunately he com bined with his nobles in oppressing the Cossacks, and thus drove those uncivilized tribes to a general revolt. In the midst of this war Ladislaus died (a. d. 1648) ; he was succeeded by his brother John Casimir, who would gladly have entered into terms with the injured Cossacks, but wTas forced to continue the war by his turbulent nobles. Alexis, czar of Russia, took advantage of these commotions to capture Smolensko and ravage Lithuania, while Poland itself was invaded by Charles X. The progress of the Swedes was rapid, they obtained two brilliant victories in the field, captured Cracow, and compelled the terrified Casimir to seek refuge in Silesia. But the insulting demeanour of the Swedes, and the cruel massacre perpetrated at the capture of Warsaw, confirmed the Poles in the deter mined spirit of resistance, of which the burghers of Dantzic set them a noble example ; while the chief powers of the North combined to check the dangerous ambition of Sweden. Attacked at once by the czar of Russia, the emperor of Germany, and the"], [220, "206 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. king of Denmark, Charles, though deserted by his ally the elector of Brandenburg, did not lose courage. He led an army over the ice to Funen, subdued that and several other Danish islands, and laid siege to Copenhagen. The city was saved by an insincere peace, which proved to be only a suspension of arms ; but when Charles renewed his exertions, he was opposed by the republics of Holland and England. Negotiations for peace were commenced under the auspices of these great naval powers; but, ere they were brought to a conclusion, Charles died of an epidemic fever (a. d. 1660). The Swedes, deprived of their active and ambitious monarch, were easily brought to resign their pretensions to Poland by the treaty of Oliva ; and the general desire of preventing the minority of Charles XL being disturbed by foreign wars, induced the regency to adjust a pacification with Denmark and the other powers. Section II. \u2014 History of England under the Commonwealth. The civil and religious constitution of England was dissolved by the execution of Charles I. ; the great body of the nation was dissatisfied with the result of the civil war, but it was overawed by an army of fifty thousand men, entirely devoted to the service of Cromwell ; and the Commonwealth Parliament, as the inconsiderable remnant of the House of Commons was called, found itself in possession of the supreme authority. The state of affairs in Ireland and Scotland soon engaged the atten tion of the new government, and they were especially interested to maintain the dominion that England claimed over the former country. The revolt of the Irish, like the revolt of the Ame rica is in later days, was regarded as treason against the English people, rasher than rebellion against their joint sovereign; the partial successes of the insurgents were viewed as national wrongs, and the use of the phrase \" our kingdom of Ireland\" made every Englishman imagine that he would be robbed of some portion of his hereditary rights were that island to establish its independence. Cromwell, aware of the great popularity which"], [221, "207 HISTORY OF ENGLAND UNDER TnE COMMONWEALTH. might be gained in a war so popular as that undertaken for the recovery of Ireland, successfully intrigued to have himself appointed lord-lieutenant and commandcr-in-chicf of the army. The state of Ireland could not be more favourable to the pur poses of an invader. When Charles I. entered into a treaty with his revolted Irish subjects, he disgusted one party without conciliating the other, for he gave both reason to suspect his sincerity. He appointed the marquis of Ormond lord-lieute nant, a nobleman possessed of many high qualities, but who had imbibed the principles of the unfortunate earl of Strafford, and was bigotedly attached to the support of the royal authority and the episcopal church. Ormond conciliated Inchiquin, and some other protestant leaders who had refused to acknowledge the cessation of arms which Charles had granted to the insur gents, but he protracted the negotiations with the catholic con federates until their aid was useless to the royal cause. Alarmed at length by the progress of the Parliament, while the confede rates were at the same time incensed by the intolerant ordi nances of the English Commons, he concluded a treaty with the catholic deputies at Kilkenny (a. d. 1646), on the basis of a general pardon and full toleration. The native Irish were dissatisfied with this pacification, which did not restore them to lands of which they deemed themselves unjustly deprived; the bigoted catholics sought the supremacy, not the toleration, of their religion, and many of the more moderate entertained sus picions of Ormond's good faith. Under such circumstances they were influenced by Rinuccini, the papal nuncio, to reject the treaty of Kilkenny, and Ormond at onee was deprived of all authority. As the king was unable to assist him, he deli vered up the fortified towns to an officer of the English par liament, a fatal measure, which rendered the restoration of the royal power impossible. The Irish soon grew weary of Rinuccini's pride, bigotry, and incapacity ; a powerful body of the catholic nobles, headed by the earl of Clanricarde, expelled the nuncio, and invited Ormond to resume the government. The lord-lieutenant returned, and found the royal authority established everywhere except in the towns which he had himself surrendered to the"], [222, "208 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. parliament. His first care was to remedy this blunder; he subdued several important garrisons, but he allowed himself to be surprised near Dublin by an inferior force, and was routed with great loss. At this crisis, Cromwell landed with an army of enthusiastic soldiers trained to arms, and flushed by recent victories. He besieged Drogheda, took it by storm, and put all the garrison to the sword. The town of Wexford was. next assailed, and its defenders similarly butchered ; and this cruelty produced such alarm, that thenceforth every town, before which Cromwell presented himself, surrendered at the first summons. The declining season, a failure of provisions, and epidemic disease, soon reduced the invaders to great distress ; but they were relieved by a revolution as sudden as it was unexpected. The protestant royalists in Munster, always jealous of their Irish allies, revolted to the parliament at the instigation of the lords Broghill and Inchiquin, and the gates of all the important garrisons in the south of Ireland were opened to Cromwell's sickly troops. The Irish could no longer be brought to pay obedience to a protestant governor, Ormond quitted the country in despair, and the confederates, having no longer any bond of union, were overpowered in detail. Cromwell freed himself from all future opposition, by permitting the Irish officers and soldiers to engage in foreign service. About forty thousand catholics went on this occasion into voluntary exile. The young king, Charles II., had intended to place himself at the head of the Irish royalists; but, when their cause was ruined, he entered into negotiations with the Scottish cove nanters, and submitted to terms the most ignominious that ever a people imposed upon its prince. He was forced to publish a proclamation, banishing all excommunicated persons from his court, \u2014 that is, the royalists who had perilled their lives and fortunes in the service of his family ; to pledge his word that he would take the covenant and support the presbyterian form of government ; and finally, to promise that, in all civil affairs, he would conform to the direction of the parliament, and submit all ecclesiastical matters to the general assembly of the kirk. Charles did not consent to these disgraceful conditions, until the royal cause in Scotland was rendered desperate by the over-"], [223, "209 HISTORY OF ENGLAND UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH. throw of its greatest supporter, the marquis of Montrose. This gallant nobleman, immediately after the execution of Charles I., renewed the war in Scotland, but was made prisoner by the covenanters, and ignominiously put to death as a traitor (a. d. 1650). Soon after this tragical event, Charles landed in Scotland, and found himself a mere pageant of state in the hands of Argyle and the rigid covenanters, at whose mercy lay both his life and liberty. The intolerance of these bigots was not assuaged by the approach of an English army under the command of Crom well, whom the parliament of England had recalled from the Irish war, so soon as the treaty between Charles and the covenanters was published. Cromwell entered Scotland, but found a formidable competitor in General Leslie, the head of the covenanters. The English were soon reduced to great distress, and their post, at Dunbar, was blockaded by a Scottish army, on the heights that overlook that town. Cromwell was saved by the fanatical and ignorant preachers in the hostile camp ; they pretended that a revelation had descended to them, promising a victory over the sectarian host of the English, and forced Leslie, in despite of his urgent remonstrances, to quit his advantageous position. Cromwell took advantage of their delusion; he attacked the Scotch, disordered by their descent from the hills, before they could form their lines, and in a brief space, gained a decided victory. Edinburgh and Leith were abandoned to the conquerors, while the remnant of the Scottish army fled to Stirling. This defeat was by no means disagreeable to Charles ; it so far diminished the pride of the bigoted party, that he was permitted to accept the aid of the episcopal royalists, the hereditary friends of his family. Still the king felt very bitterly the bondage in which he was held, and when Cromwell crossed the Forth, he embraced a resolution worthy of his birth and cause, and disconcerting that general by a hasty march, he boldly entered England at the head of fourteen thousand men. But the result disappointed his expectations; the English royalists disliked the Scotch, and detested the covenant; the presbyterians were not prepared to join him, and both were"], [224, "210 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. overawed by the militia, which the parliament raised in the several counties. At Worcester the king was overtaken by Cromwell, with thirty thousand men (Sept. 3d, 1651). The place was attacked on all sides : Charles, after giving many proofs of personal valour, saw his cause totally ruined, and sought safety in flight ; the Scots were all either killed or taken, and the prisoners, eight thousand in number, were sold as slaves to the American plantations. Charles wandered about for forty five days in various disguises, and amidst the greatest dangers : more than fifty persons were entrusted with his secret, but they all preserved it faithfully, and he finally escaped to France. In Scotland, the presbyterian clergy, formerly all-powerful, found themselves treated with scorn by the English army. Their assembly at Aberdeen was dispersed by a military force, their persons were paraded through the town in insulting mockery, and they were forbidden to assemble in greater numbers than three at a time. In the mean time, the English republic was engaged in a foreign war. The increase of the naval and commercial power of the Dutch had been viewed with great jealousy by the English nation ; but the common interests of religion, and after wards, the alliance between the Stuart family and the house of Orange, had prevented a rupture. After the death of William II. prince of Orange, the Dutch abolished the office of stadtholder, and this advance towards a purely republican constitution, induced the English parliament to seek a closer alliance with Holland. Their ambassador, however, met but an indifferent reception at the Hague\"\"\", and on his return to London, it became obvious that the mutual jealousies of the two common wealths would soon lead to open hostilities. The English * Mr. St. John, the English plenipotentiary, was a stern republican and a haughty man. He had the presumption to take precedency of the duke of York, who was then at the Hague, in a public walls. The prince-palatine, happening to be present, struck off the ambassador's hat, and bade liini respect the son and brother of his king. St. John put his hand to his sword, refusing to recognise either the lung or the duke of York ; but the populace, compassionating fallen royalty, took part with the prince, and forced the stern republican to seek refuge in his lodgings."], [225, "211 HISTORY OF ENGLAND UNDER TOE COMMONWEALTH. parliament passed the celebrated Act of Navigation, which enacted that no goods from Asia, Africa, or America should be imported into England, except in English vessels ; and the prohibition was extended to European commodities not brought by ships belonging to the country of which the goods were the growth or manufacture. This, though apparently general, particularly affected the Dutch, whose commerce consisted chiefly in the carrying trade, their own country producing but few commodities. The war commenced in a dispute on a point of naval etiquette : the English required that all foreign vessels in the British seas should strike their flags to English ships of war ; Van Tromp, a Dutch admiral, with a fleet of forty sail, met Blake, the commander of the British fleet, in Dover road ; Conscious of his superior force, he refused to conform to the degrading ceremony, and answered the demand by a broadside. Though Blake had only fifteen ships, he immediately commenced an engagement, and being reinforced during the battle by eight more, he gained a glorious, though not a very valuable victory. A fierce naval war ensued between the two republics ; it was, on the whole, disadvantageous to the Dutch, though they were commanded by such excellent admirals as De Ruyter and Van Tromp. The death of the latter in an engagement that lasted three days (a. d. 1654), decided the contest, and the Hollanders were forced to beg peace from Oliver Cromwell, who had, in the mean time, dissolved the parliament, and usurped the government of England. When Scotland and Ireland were subdued, the parliament became jealous of Cromwell's power, and resolved to diminish it by disbanding a portion of the army. But the parliament, if such a name could fairly be given to a minority of the House of Commons, had lost its sole strength, the confidence of the people, by its obstinacy in retaining the power with which it had been invested by circumstances ; it would not dissolve itself, but seemed determined to perpetuate its sovereignty'\". An * Ludlow asserts, without a shadow of proof, that the parliament was about to dissolve itself, and give the nation a free general election on a reformed plan, when Cromwell interfered. Such a project, indeed, was discussed, but there appear no proofs of its being intended to put it into execution."], [226, "212 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. angry remonstrance from the army was rejected, and the soldiers reproved for interfering in public affairs. This brought affairs to a crisis: on the 19th of April, 1653, Cromwell turned out the members with military force, locked the doors, put the key in his pocket, and retired to his lodgings at Whitehall. The council of state was similarly dismissed, and so weary were the people of their late rulers, that addresses were sent to Cromwell from almost every part of England, thanking him for his boldness and courage. It was necessary still to preserve the forms of the constitution, but Cromwell could not venture on an appeal to the people, and allow them their ancient liberty of election, much less a more extended franchise ; he therefore adopted a middle course, and by the advice of his officers, nominated one hundred and sixty persons on his own authority, to form a new parliament. This extraordinary body was named the Barebones parliament, from one of its fanatic members, named Praise-God Barebones, who rendered himself conspicuous by his affectation of superior sanctity. Cromwell, finding this convention not so pliant as had been expected, contrived, by his creatures, that a majority should vote, for an immediate dissolution, and when about thirty members continued to meet, they were unceremoniously ejected by a file of musketeers. A new constitution was formed, by which the legislative power was granted to a Lord Protector and parliament, and the executive to the protector and a council of state. On the 16th of December, 1653, Cromwell took the oath of fidelity to the new form of gevernment, and was invested with the dignity of Lord Protector. On the 3d of the following September, the new parliament assembled, but though the strictest reoulations consistent with the forms of election had been devised to exclude all but partisans of the government, the protector's authority was menaced on the very first day of debate, and it was resolved by a majority of five, to refer the examination of the new constitution to a select committee. Cromwell first excluded half the members for refusing to take an oath of allegiance to the protector, and finding that the house, even after this mutilation, continued refractory, he dissolved the parliament, before it had"], [227, "213 HISTORY OF ENGLAND UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH. sat the five months required by the constitution, which he had himself framed and sworn to support. A new parliament was summoned, but notwithstanding the interference of Cromwell and the major-generals that ruled the twelve districts into which England was divided, so many opponents of the government were returned, that Cromwell posted soldiers at the door, to exclude those members to whom he had not granted tickets of admission. The parliament, thus modified, proved sufficiently subservient, and on the 26th of March, 1656, it gratified Cromwell's secret ambition, by offering him the title of king. But Fleetwood, the protector's son-in law, and Desborough, his brother-in-law, disconcerted the entire plan, by joining the republicans in the army, and procuring a petition from the officers against royalty, which it would have been dangerous to disregard*. Cromwell was forced to resign his darling object at the moment it seemed within his grasp, and to content himself with the protectorate for life, and the power of nominating his successor. To divert the attention of the nation from its internal affairs, Cromwell resolved to engage in some foreign war, but was at first undecided whether he should attack France or Spain t. Mazarine's cunning decided the question; he conciliated the protector by banishing the English princes from France, and thus obtained auxiliaries at a criticalnioment, whose support, as we have already seen, he paid by the cession of Dunkirk. Two formidable fleets were prepared in England ; one, under the command of Blake, was sent to cruise in the Mediterranean ; the other, entrusted to Admirals Penn and Venables, proceeded to the West Indies. To justify hostilities, Cromwell demanded of the * \" Certain persons,\" said the petition, \" are endeavouring to reduce the nation to the old state of slavery, and urge the protector to assume the royal title, wishing by this means to ruin him. We, therefore, petition the parliament to oppose such intrigues, and to abide by the old cause, for which we are ready to hazard our lives.\" \u25a0f- \" In order to maintain himself, he, in common with Lambert, and some of the council, wishes for war, and is only revolving whether it were better for him to raise it against France or Spain.\" \u2014 Report of the French Ambassador, April 20, 1654."], [228, "214 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. Spanish ambassador, that his master should abolish the Inqui sition, and open the trade of South America to the English. The ambassador replied, that this was asking for his master's two eyes; indeed, neither demand, under the circumstances, was reasonable. The Spanish Inquisition certainly exercised an unjust tyranny towards protestants, but Cromwell did not treat the Irish catholics with greater mildness ; and when England had just given an example of monopoly by passing the Navigation Act, it showed little regard for consistency to demand free trade from Spain. But both proposals were in accordance with the spirit of the times, and the knowdedge of their having been made, brought back to Cromwell a considerable share of the popularity he had forfeited. Admiral Blake first sailed to Leghorn, and having cast anchor before the town, demanded and obtained satisfaction for the injuries which the duke of Tuscany had done to English commerce. Repairing thence to Algiers, he compelled the dey to restrain his piratical subjects from further depredations on the English. Failing to obtain similar satisfaction at Tunis, he battered its fortifications with his artillery, and burned every ship in the harbour. His fame spread through the entire Mediterranean, and no power dared to provoke his vengeance. Penn and Vcnables attempted to take Hispaniola, then con sidered the most valuable island in the West Indies, but failino in this effort, they conquered Jamaica, which has ever since been annexed to the dominions of England. Cromwell, however, was so little satisfied with the conduct of the twTo admirals, that on their return, he committed them to the Tower. The Enolish, through the entire war, maintained their supremacy by sea; several of the galleons, laden with the precious metals, from South America, were taken or destroyed, and an entire fleet burned by the heroic Blake in the bay of Santa Cruz*. \u2022 April 21st, 1657.\u2014\" This was the last and greatest action of this gallant naval commander, who died in his way home.

Public attention was roused by the assembling of parliament, on the 20th of January, 1658; the House of Commons showed its hostility to the government, by admitting the members who had been previously excluded by the privy council, and still more by severely scrutinizing the constitution of the upper house. After a vain effort to conciliate his opponents, Cromwell dissolved the parliament, on the 4th of February, and resolved to hazard the perilous experiment of governing alone. But he encountered violent opposition, even in his own family ; Eliza beth, his second daughter, keenly reproached him on her dying bed, and the father, who loved her fondly, felt his grief for her loss sharpened by the pangs of conscience. A pamphlet was published, and -widely circulated, in which the assassination of the protector was recommended as an act of justice and patriotism ; Cromwell read it, and never smiled again. He lived in continual fear, always wore a coat of mail, never slept two successive nights in the same chamber, had guards posted everywhere, and secret avenues contrived, by which he might escape on the least alarm. In such a condition, his death must be considered a happy release; it took place on the 3d of September, 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Worcester and Dunbar. Lie was interred with great pomp in Westminster Abbey, but the conduct of the populace evinced anything but sorrow for the loss of their ruler t. height than it had ever attained in any former period. Cromwell, fully sensible of his merits, ordered him a pompous funeral at the public expense; and people of all parties, by their tears, bore testimony to his valour, generosity, and public spirit.\" \u2014 Dr. Johnson's Life of Blake. * Satirical poems were published, in one of which is the following \" A Protector ! what's that ?

Richard Cromwell had hitherto lived a thoughtless and rather extravagant life, but on his father's death, he was acknowledged as protector, both at home and abroad, without opposition. He had, bow-ever, soon to contend against a powerful republican minority in parliament, while still greater dangers menaced him from the discontent of the army, which was equally dissatisfied with the protector and the parliament*. The officers urged Richard to dissolve the refractory commons, and when he had taken this imprudent step, seized the reins of government into their own hands. Having deliberated on several projects, the military junta came to the resolution of reassembling the long parliament. About ninety members were hastily collected, but those who displeased the new rulers were excluded, and the deliberations of the rest were fettered by what was called \" an humble petition and address from the officers to the parliament of the commonwealth of England.\" Richard, weaiy of his situation, resigned the protectorate, and the chief power of the state passed to the cabal of officers, at whose head were Lambert, Fleet wood,, and Desborough. In the contests that followed between the parliament and the council of officers, the nation generally took no interest. It was a period of complete anarchy; principle was forgotten, every one was guided by his caprice, or by some prospect of private advantage. All true friends of their country were heartily tired of this confusion, and the illusions of the republicans had so completely vanished, that if we except those who wished for a protector, or expected the personal reign of Christ, not more than a few hundreds could be found anxious to restore the commonwealth. In this state of affairs, George barbarous noise, parading through the streets, drinking and smoking.\" Ludlow adds, \" The folly and profusion (of the lying in state) so far provoked the people, that they threw dirt in the night on his escutcheon, that was placed over the great gate of Somerset House.\" * Richard derided the fanatical pretensions of his father's officers ; when a remonstrance was made against his granting commissions to \"the ungodly,\" he replied, \" Here is Dick Ingoldsby, who can neither pray nor preach, and yet I will trust him before ye all.\" \"These imprudent, as well as irreligious words,\" says Ludlow, \" so clearly discovering the frame and temper of his mind, were soon published in the army and city of London, to his great prejudice.\""], [231, "217 HISTORY OF ENGLAND UNDER THE COMMONWEALTH. Monk, afterwards duke of Albemarle, resolved to act a decided part. He had been entrusted by Cromwell with the government of Scotland, and the command of the army : though suspected of a secret attachment to the royal cause*, he continued to hold his place during the protectorates of Oliver and Richard. On the abdication of the latter, he professed the utmost anxiety for a reconciliation between the parliament and the English army ; but if that could not be effected, he declared that he would support the former, because the establishment of a common wealth was dear to his heart. This declaration gave so much confidence to the opponents of the officers, that Fleetwood found it necessary to permit the parliament to assemble ; and the Rump Parliament, as the House of Commons so often mutilated was ignominiously termed, met amid the loudest acclamations of the soldiers, who only two months before had dispersed it by military violence. The house promptly made use of the power which it had regained; the members and officers of whom it did not approve were removed ; Desborough, with some others, fled to Lambert. Fleetwood was overwhelmed with consternation. On the 1st of January, 1660, Monk, at the head of six thousand men, commenced his march towards London ; he was received everywhere with the greatest enthusiasm ; in all the towns on his road the people rang the bells, lighted bonfires, and declared their ardent wish for a free parliament. Lambert's army melted away as he advanced ; but Fleetw7ood's soldiers excited so much alarm, that the speaker wrote to Monk to hasten his march. On the 6th of February, he appeared in parliament, and first excited some suspicion of his real designs by refusing to take the oath of abjuration against the Stuarts. The parliament tried to embroil him with the citizens of London, by sending him to arrest some members of the common council for resolving that no taxes should be paid until the parliament was filled. Monk performed this disagreeable duty; but * Cromwell once wrote to him, \" I have been informed that there is in Scotland, a certain cunning fellow, George Monk by name, who has a scheme for restoring Charles Stuart ; endeavour to catch him, and send him hither.\" I."], [232, "218 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. immediately after reconciled himself to the city, and sent a letter to the speaker, demanding a dissolution of parliament and a new election. While this letter was fiercely debated, Monk took the decisive step of introducing the old excluded members, by which he gained a triumphant majority. On the 17th of March, the Long Parliament concluded its sittings, to the great joy of the nation, and a new house of commons met on the 25th of April. In the interval, Lambert made a desperate effort to place himself at the head of a new army, but by Monk's promptitude and vigour he was taken prisoner and sent to the Tower. When the new parliament, consisting both of upper and lower house, met, it was manifest that the royalists had such a pre ponderance that the only question remaining to be decided was, whether Charles II. should be restored with or without condi tions. The latter course was unfortunately chosen, perhaps, because it would have been impossible to frame terms, the discussion of which would not have roused the slumbering feuds of hostile parties. On the 29th of May, the day on which he completed his thirtieth year, Charles triumphantly entered London. Lie was accompanied by the members of parliament, the clergy, the civic authorities, and about twenty thousand persons on foot or horseback. The streets were strewed with flowers, the houses decorated with tapestry, the bells rung in every church, the air resounded with acclamations. The monarch, so recently a hopeless exile, might well ask, as he witnessed the tumult of universal joy, \" Where then are my enemies ?\" Section III. \u2014 History of England, from the Restoration to the Revolution ; and rise of the power of Louis XIV. Few monarchs ever had such an opportunity of rendering himself popular, and his subjects happy, as Charles II. ; there is scarcely one who failed more lamentably. Llis first measures promised well ; a few of the regicides and their adherents were"], [233, "219 REIGNS OF CHARLES II. AND JAMES II. indeed excepted from the act of indemnity and executed ; but pardon was granted to the chief parliamentary leaders, and many of them received into favour. Ecclesiastical affairs, how ever, began to disturb the harmony of the nation, when a new parliament was assembled, in which the episcopal and royalist party had a triumphant majority. An act was passed, requiring that every clergyman should possess episcopal ordination, declare his assent to everything contained in the Book of Common Prayer, take the oath of canonical obedience, abjure the solemn league and covenant, and the right of taking up arms against the king, under any pretence whatever. About two thousand of the clergy rejected these conditions, and resigned their benefices, rather than do violence to their religious opinions. The ejected clergymen v\\jere persecuted with unwise rigour; severe laws were enacted against conventicles, and a non-con formist minister was prohibited from coming within five miles of a corporation. The marriage of the king to Catharine of Portugal, when his subjects hoped that he would make a protestant princess his queen, and the sale of Dunkirk to the French monarch, tended still further to diminish the royal popularity; and a war, equally unjust and impolitic, undertaken against the Dutch, completed the public dissatisfaction. Hosti lities were commenced without a formal declaration of war; the English seized several of the Dutch colonies in Africa and America, especially the province of Nova Belgia, which Charles, in honour of his brother, named the state of New York. Holland was at this time ruled by the Louvcstein, or violent republican party ; its head, the celebrated John de Wit, who, with the title of pensionaiy, enjoyed almost dictatorial power, feared that Charles might make some effort to restore Wil liam III., prince of Orange, to the office of stadt-holder, which his ancestors had enjoyed; and to avert this danger, entered into close alliance with France. The pensionary found, however, that he must rely upon his own resources ; he fitted out a powerful fleet ; the English exerted themselves with equal diligence, and a furious engagement took place upon the coast of Holland (a. d. 1665). Victory declared in favour of the English ; more than thirty of the enemy's ships were taken or L2"], [234, "220 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. destroyed, and the whole would probably have fallen had not the pursuit been stopped by the oversight or cowardice of the duke of York, who had been created lord high-admiral of England by his brother. The joy occasioned by this victory was diminished by the ravages of the great plague, which swept away seventy thousand citizens of London in the course of a year. De Wit, in the mean time, exerted himself to restore the naval power of the Dutch ; he formed an alliance with the king of Denmark, procured aid from France, and soon sent out a more powerful fleet than that which had been defeated. But the English still maintained their wonted superiority ; and the Dutch, dis- heartened by repeated defeats, began to murmur against the government of the grand pensionary. Scarcely had the plague ceased, when London was subjected to a second calamity; a dreadful fire, which raged for four days, destroyed four hundred streets and lanes, including thirteen thousand houses ; but it is remarkable that not a single life was lost by the conflagration. Great discontents were excited by the severity with which the non-conformists were treated in England and Scotland; about two thousand of the discontented, in the western counties of Scotland, had recourse to arms, and renewed the covenant, but they were oveipowered by the royal forces, and their insurrec- tion punished with remorseless cruelty. One of the stipulations made with Charles on his accession was, that he should not disturb the grants which Cromwell had given to his followers in Ireland. But as many, if not most, of these estates had been forfeited for the attachment of the proprietors to the royal cause, it was necessary that some compensation should be made to the sufferers. After a long struggle, the best arrangement that was perhaps possible, under the circumstances, was effected by the Act of Settlement ; and though many of those who had been dispossessed complained of injustice, the island was restored to tranquillity. It was fast recovering its prosperity, when the unwise jealousy of the English parliament produced considerable distress, by prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle *. While * The discussion of this act, in the House of Lords, gave rise to some singular debates. It was secretly opposed by the king, who felt its obvious"], [235, "221 REIGNS OF CHARLES II. AND JAMES II. these circumstances embarrassed the British government, the pensionary, De Wit, sent out a new fleet, which destroyed several vessels at the mouth of the Thames, reduced Shccrness, insulted Portsmouth and Plymouth, and for several weeks rode triumphant in the Channel (a. d. 1667). The conclusion of a peace at Breda dissipated the alarm, but at the same time increased the discontent of the English nation ; it was felt that the prodigality of the king had exhausted the treasury, and left the kingdom exposed to insult and disgrace. The ambitious projects of Louis XIV. began now to excite general alarm ; his personal qualities won him the affections of his people ; the splendour of his court dazzled the nobility, and changed the factious lords of France into a body of the most subservient courtiers that had ever been seen in modern Europe. On the death of Philip IV., of Spain, Louis claimed the Spanish Netherlands in right of his wife, the daughter of Philip, by his first marriage, asserting that females could inherit according to the custom of Brabant, and that his queen should have precedence of her infant brother, the offspring of a second marriage. Anna Maria, of Austria, queen-regent of Spain, was a weak woman, entirely governed by her confessor, a German Jesuit, named Nithard, who was more anxious to check the growth of heresy than to protect the monarchy*. Louis entered Flanders at the head of a powerful army, and found the Spaniards almost wholly unprepared for resistance. The principal towns surrendered immediately ; Lisle, though a place of considerable strength, capitulated after a siege of nine days, impolicy ; it was urged forward by the eccentric duke of Buckingham, who hoped to force himself into power by means of the House of Commons. The Commons declared the importation of Irish cattle \"a nuisance.\" The Lords rejected a term so revolting to common sense, and. substituted \" a grievance.\" The duke of Buckingham insisted on retaining the obnoxious phrase ; another noble lord moved that the importation of Irish cattle should be deemed \" a felony,\" or a \" pr\u00e6munire ;\" a third, with more wit and as much reason, proposed that it should be accounted \" adultery.\" * His arrogance and ignorance were displayed in his reply to a nobleman who had addressed him in a tone of disrespect. \" You ought,\" said he, ** to revere the man who has every day your God in his hands and your queen at his feet.\""], [236, "222 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. and Louis secured his conquests by entrusting the repair of their fortifications to the celebrated Vauban, and garrisoning them with his best troops. The Dutch were alarmed at the prospect of having their frontiers exposed to such a powerful neighbour; they received succour from an unexpected quarter. Charles II., cither jealous of Louis, or eager to acquire popularity, concluded a defensive alliance between England and Holland (a.d. 1668); and Sweden soon after concurred in the treaty. Louis found it necessary to stop short in his career ; he made peace with Spain, retaining a great portion of his conquests, which, however, were not sufficient to console him for the brilliant prospects he was compelled to resign. He had to endure another mortification ; the Turks once more became formidable, under the administra tion of the vizier Kupruli, and compelled the German emperor to conclude peace, on terms highly favourable to their interests ; and they wrested the important island of Candia from the Venetians, in spite of the efforts made by the French monarch to save the place. Louis saw that his designs on the Netherlands, and his revenge against Holland, could not be accomplished without the active participation of England. Knowing the profligate habits of Charles, whose court was a scene of extravagance and dissi pation, he concluded a secret treaty with that monarch, in which it was agreed that Charles should receive a large pension from Louis, in return for which he should co-operate in the conquest of the Netherlands, propagate the catholic faith in his dominions, and publicly announce his conversion to that religion. France and England commenced the war by atrociously out raging the laws of nations; Louis, without the shadow of a pretext, seized the duchy of Lorraine ; Charles attempted the capture of a rich Dutch fleet, before he had announced his dissatisfaction with the recent treaty. The Dutch were wholly unable to resist this storm ; at sea they maintained their equality, but the armies of France bore down all opposition ; Louis crossed the Rhine, advanced to Utrecht, and had he not delayed there, might have conquered Amsterdam. The Dutch populace vented their rage on the unfortunate pensionary, to whom they unjustly attributed all their calamities. John de Wit and his"], [237, "223 REIGNS OF CHARLES II. AND JAMES II. brother Cornelius were arrested, but ere they could be brought to trial, a furious mob burst into their prison and tore them to pieces. William III., prince of Orange, was immediately chosen stadt-holder ; his exhortations revived the sinking spirits of the Dutch; they resolved, that rather than submit to disgraceful terms, they would abandon their country, seek their settlements in the East Indies, and re-establish their republic in southern Asia *. Louis soon found the results of this determined spirit ; the emperor, thoroughly alarmed, sided with the Dutch, and many of the northern German states followed his example. Indecisive engagements were fought at sea ; but the conquest of Cologne by the Dutch and Germans, intercepted the communi cation between France and the United Provinces, in consequence of which, Louis was compelled to withdraw his forces and abandon his conquests. A more important change was the secession of England ; Charles, distressed for want of money, loaded with debt, and rendered anxious by the progress of public discontent, concluded peace with Holland, on very equitable conditions (a. d. 1674). He then offered his mediation to the contending powers. Louis surprised all Europe by the magnitude of his efforts, but they did not produce any corresponding result ; and the desolation of the Palatinate by Marshal Turenne excited such general indignation, that Louis bribed Charles to dissolve the parliament, lest it should force its sovereign to declare war ao'ainst France. The war was maintained with great fury durino- the ensuing campaigns ; it was on the whole favourable to the French, but the rapid progress of Louis, in the year 1677, excited so much alarm, that the English parliament addressed the kino to conclude an offensive and defensive alliance with Holland. Charles, however, had sold his neutrality, and would not abandon his pension to promote either the honour or advantage of his kingdom ; but he tried to conciliate the nation by criving his niece, the daughter of the duke of York, in * Several efforts were made to corrupt the prince of Orange, but he sternly rejected them. When told that the ruin of his country was inevitable, he replied, \" There is one way by which I can be certain not to see the ruin of my country ; and that is, to die disputing the last ditch.\""], [238, "224 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. marriage to the prince of Orange. Louis continued his vic torious career uninterrupted by England, until the Dutch sought peace on any terms, and a treaty was concluded at Nimeguen (a. d. 1678>, by which France acquired an increase of power dangerous to all the neighbouring states. The jealousy of the English nation at the exaltation of a rival, long regarded as their natural enemy, the feeling that the national honour had been sacrificed, and the fear of the design of the court to establish the Romish religion and arbitrary power, spread a deep gloom over England, and disposed the people to suspicions that led them to become the dupes of the vilest impostors. Just as the account of the cruelties practised on the covenanters in Scotland excited most alarm and indig nation, the three kingdoms were roused to sudden frenzy by the announcement of a popish plot. A wicked impostor, named Titus Oates, framed a talc of a conspiracy by the Jesuits for the subversion of the protestant religion and the murder of the king ; his narrative was improbable, confused, and contra dictory, but it suited the temper of the nation, and it was favourable to the ambition of some designing men, anxious to obtain power at any hazard. Before censuring too severely the credulity of the nation, we must remember that a plot for the re-establishment of the Romish religion really existed, but it was formed by the king, not against him ; many catholics, aware of the king's secret attachment to their religion, and encouraged by the duke of York's open profession of it, indulged hopes of the speedy reconciliation of the British kingdoms to the Holy See, and several enthusiastic phrases in their letters were capable of being distorted into confirmation of a plan formed to accelerate such a consummation *. The inexplicable murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, an active magistrate who had taken Oates's depositions, completed the delusion ; to deny the reality of the plot, was now to be reputed an accomplice ; * This is especially the case with the letters of the first victim to the national delusion, Edward Coleman, secretary to the duke of York. Dryden has well described the plot in a single line : \" Some truth there was, but dashed and brewed with lies.\""], [239, "225 REIGNS OF CHARLES II. AND JAMES II. even to doubt of it was criminal. Several catholics were brought to trial, the evidence against them was a tissue of palpable falsehoods, but, in the frenzy of the moment, every absurdity received credence ; they were, condemned and exe- cuted. The parliament at the same time passed a law excluding from both houses all who would not swear that \" the sacrifice of the mass was damnable and idolatrous,\" and it was with great difficulty that an exception was made in favour of the king's brother, the duke of York. The covenanters in Scotland were driven to such desperation by the severities of the royal government, that they murdered Archbishop Sharpe, and broke out into open rebellion. Their revolt was suppressed, and those who had shared in it, or who were suspected of favouring the views of the covenanters, were punished with remorseless cruelty. It deserves to be remarked that, during this turbulent period, Ireland, to the great discredit of the popish plot, con tinued perfectly tranquil. Still its name was dragged into the controversy, and it lent a title to party. The supporters of the court were named Tories, from the Irish robbers, who, under that name, harassed the Cromwellian settlers; the leaders of the opposition were denominated Whigs, the appellation of the fiercest of the Scottish covenanters (a.d. 1681). A bill to exclude the duke of York from the succession passed the Commons, but was rejected by the Lords ; Charles seized the moment when the violence of his adversaries disgusted the sound part of the nation, to dissolve the parliament, and to summon a new one to assemble at Oxford. This second parliament proving refractory, it was suddenly dissolved, and a declaration vindi cating the king's proceedings was ordered to be read in all churches and chapels. Charles won the support of the clergy, by vigorously enforcing the Act of Uniformity and persecuting sectaries, and at the same time chose some of the most pliant lawyers to be judges. By these means the doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance were revived, and the bench and the pulpit seemed to contend with each other which should show most zeal for the unlimited power of the crown. He next assafled his opponents with their L 3"], [240, "226 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. own weapons; the spies, informers, and false witnesses, who had been employed by the popular party to establish the reality of the popish plot, were now enlisted against their former patrons, and gave their perjured support to one party as freely as they had done to another. The spirit of independence still reigned in the hearts of the citizens of London, but, on the most flimsy legal pretexts, the capital was deprived of its charter, and the power of the corporation virtually transferred to the king. The popular leaders, not disheartened, formed a plan of insur rection ; they were betrayed by one of their party; Lord Howard, who had been a leader, became a witness against his associates ; several of them were tried, condemned, and executed; but the victims whose fate excited most sympathy were the popular Lord Russell and the virtuous Algernon Sydney. The duke of York was now placed at the head of the royal councils, but Charles soon became weary of his brother's violence and bigotry; he is even said to have meditated a change in the government, and the adoption of popular measures, when he died suddenly (a. d. 1685), not without strong suspicions of poison. It was supposed that some of the violent catholics, attached to the duke of York, perpetrated the crime without that prince's know ledge or participation. While England was thus convulsed at home, its foreign inte rests were wholly neglected by its profligate sovereign, who continued to be the pensioner of the French king. Louis XIV. thus had full scope to gratify his ambition ; he continually enlarged his frontiers on the most frivolous pretences, while Spain and Holland were too weak, and the Germanic empire too much harassed by other enemies, to check his progress. The emperor Leopold, by flagrantly violating the privileges of his Hungarian subjects, provoked a formidable revolt ; it was headed by Count Tekeli, a leader possessing great courage and resolution, and he called the Turks to the assistance of his countrymen. While these allies were ravaging Silesia, the Sultan Mohammed IV. was preparing one of the most formidable armies that the Ottoman empire had ever sent against Christen dom. Leopold, convinced that his own resources were not"], [241, "227 REIGNS OF CHARLES II. AND JAMES II. equal to the crisis, entered into close alliance with the celebrated John Sobieski, who, in the year 1674, had been raised to the throne of Poland. Before the Polish levies could be completed, the Turkish army, commanded by the grand vizier, Kara Mustapha, entered Austria ; the duke of Lorraine, who commanded the imperialists, was unable to resist the progress of the invaders, they advanced rapidly, and at length laid siege to Vienna. During several weeks the city was vigorously defended, but, at length, its forti fications crumbled under the heavy fire of the Turkish artillery ; the suburbs were destroyed, and the final assault was expected every moment (a. d. 1683). The garrison, reduced to despair, was about to resign all thoughts of resistance, when the banners of Sobieski, approaching to their relief, were seen on the hill of Schellenberg. Kara Mustapha led the main body of his forces to meet the Poles, while a body of twenty thousand men attempted to storm the city. But the courage of the garrison was now revived, and the confidence of their enemies abated : the assailants were repelled; a panic seized the Turks; they broke at the first charge of the Polish cavalry, and fled in such confusion, that they abandoned their artillery, baggage, and treasures. Even the consecrated banner of Mohammed became the prize of the victors, and was sent as a trophy to the pope. Leopold, in consequence of this decided triumph, recovered pos session of Hungary, but his ingratitude to his deliverers was as signal as their merits. Louis XIV. had raised the siege of Luxemburg when he heard of the advance of the Turks, declaring that he would not attack a Christian prince while Christendom itself was endan gered by the invasion of the infidels. No sooner, however, had Sobieski's valour crushed the Mohammedans, than he renewed his aoo-ressions. Spain was thus provoked into a war, which it had not strength to support, and a hasty peace confirmed Louis in his conquests. His naval power was steadily increased at the same time; he humbled the Algerines, compelled the republic of Genoa to submit to the most degrading humiliations, and did not even spare the pope. But while his ambition was provoking the resentment of Europe., he weakened his kingdom"], [242, "228 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. by a display of ferocious bigotry, at the moment when all its strength was required to resist justly-provoked hostility. The religious toleration of the huguenots had been secured by the edict of Nantes, which was designed to be perpetual; Louis, after the death of his wisest minister, the virtuous Colbert, revoked this edict, and attempted to impose his religion on his subjects by the sword. All the terrors of military execution were employed to make converts ; multitudes were put to death, but, in spite of the most rigorous vigilance, nearly four hundred thousand French protestants escaped from their country, and, as they were the most industrious part of the population, they carried their wealth, industry, and \u25a0 skill, to enrich England, Holland, and Germany, and their tales of suffering aggravated the hatred of France, which was fast spreading through these countries. A league was formed by all the princes of Germany to restrain the encroachments of Louis ; Spain and Holland joined it as principals ; Sweden, Denmark, and Savoy, were afterwards gained ; and a sudden revolution in England placed that country at the head of the confederacy. James II. commenced his reign by liberal promises, which procured him general popularity, notwithstanding his open adhesion to the Romish church, and his going to mass with all the ensigns of regal dignity. But there were many discontented spirits who lamented his accession, and these secretly instigated the duke of Monmouth, the natural son of Charles II., to assert his mother's marriage, and his own consequent claim to the throne. Monmouth was a weak, vain man ; he readily adopted the scheme, and, in concert with the earl of Argyle, prepared for the simultaneous invasion of Scotland and England. Argyle, who was the first, readily effected a landing in Scotland, but soon found that the country was not so ripe for revolt as he had believed. Surrounded by superior forces, he attempted to force his way into the disaffected part of the western counties, but his followers gradually abandoned him ; he was taken prisoner, and sent to Edinburgh, where he expiated his imprudence on the scaffold. In the mean time, Monmouth had landed in the west of England, where he was received with great enthusiasm. Encouraged by the proofs of attachment he received, he ven-"], [243, "229 REIGNS OF CHARLES II. AND JAMES II. tured to attack the royal army encamped at Scdgemoor, near Bridgewater. But the cowardice of Lord Grey, who commanded the horse, and the incapacity of Monmouth himself, proved fatal to the insurgents ; they were routed with great slaughter, and their unfortunate leader, after wandering about several days in great distress, was taken prisoner. James II. induced the unhappy Monmouth to degrade him self by a mean supplication for life, and then informed him that his offence was too great to be pardoned *. The cruelties exercised on all suspected of having shared in the insurrection, by the inhuman Colonel Kirke, and the still more infamous Judge Jefferies, were shocking to human nature ; they spread general consternation through the western counties, but at the same time they excited a spirit of secret hostility to the tyran nical king. Encouraged by his success, James resolved to dispense with the Test Acts, by wdrich catholics were excluded from the public service, and, finding the parliament opposed to his views, he dissolved that body. Eleven, out of the twelve judges, asserted that the dispensing power was an essential part of the royal prerogative ; and the king, fortified by their opinion, gave several places of trust to catholic lords and gentlemen. The lord-lieutenancy of Ireland was entrusted to the earl of Tyrconnell, a zealous adherent of the Romish church ; many of the catholics, who felt that their religion was the cause of their being deprived of their estates, began to look forward to the repeal of the Act of Land Settlement t, and several of the more timorous protestants sought refuge in England. Their represen tations, and the tales of horror related by the exiled huguenots, filled the nation with a general hatred of popery; the king, however, unconscious of his increasing unpopularity, unwisely deprived himself of his chief security by quarrelling with the Church. He commenced by endeavouring to open the doors of * Monmouth displayed great firmness and intrepidity on the scaffold. The executioner, touched with pity, or respect for the victim's noble bearing, struck him three times without effect, and then threw aside the axe, declaring he was unable to perform his office. The sheriff compelled him to renew his efforts, and the head of the unhappy duke was at length severed from his body. -1- See page 220."], [244, "230 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. the universities to catholics ; more opposition was offered than had been anticipated, but the king persevered, and a catholic, named Parker, was installed into the presidency of Magdalen College, Oxford. A new declaration of indulgence was published, with the design of conciliating the dissenters, and it was ordered to be read in all the churches. This proceeding was regarded as an injury and an insult by the clergy; the penal laws against non-conformists had been procured by the influence of the hierarchy ; the ministers of the establishment were now called upon to undo their own work, and to sanction the dispensing power, against which they had always protested. Six bishops concerted with the primate, Saneroft, a remonstrance, in the form of a petition, to the king; when the document was presented, James was so enraged, that he ordered the prelates to be committed to the Tower. Never did any trial excite greater interest than that of the bishops, for this pretended libel : their acquittal was celebrated by bonfires and other public rejoicings, the acclamations reached even the royal camp, which had been formed at Hounslow, and the first intimation which James received of the result, was from the shouts of his own soldiers. Taking no warning from these events, James still added to the discontent of the nation ; and his tyranny was endured while the succession seemed to be secured to the prince of Orange; but when the queen presented James with a son, general alarm was diffused through every rank of society, as if a regular plan had been formed for entafling popery and arbitrary power upon them and their descendants, to the latest posterity. It was even said, that the king was trying to impose a suppositious child on the nation, though the queen's delivery had been as public as decency would permit; and this monstrous tale was received with equal credulity in England and Holland. The tories, or high-church party, and the constitutional whigs, joined in solicting the prince of Orange to undertake the deliverance of the nation ; even the dissenters, in their hatred of the Romish religion, united themselves to the coalition, in spite of the recent indulgence granted to them ; the princes of Germany, the houses of Spain and Austria, and even the pope himself, favoured the project, on account of the determination"], [245, "231 REIGNS OF CHARLES II. AND JAMES II. that James had shown to support the ambitious schemes of Louis XIV. The infatuated James had no svispicion of the storm that was gathering, until it was ready to burst upon his head. Louis in vain sent him information of the proceedings of the prince of Orange ; of the army that was collected, and the fleet that was prepared. He could not be persuaded of his danger, until the expedition was on the point of sailing, and then his timidity was as great as his former confidence. On the 5th of November, 1688, William, whom the winds and waves had wonderfully favoured, landed, with about fourteen thousand men, at Torbay. At first, few adherents came to the prince's standard, for the suppression of Monmouth's rebellion had terrified the western counties, but when he advanced to Exeter, he was joined by the gentry of Somerset and Devon, and by many persons of influence from various parts of England. The movement, once begun, proceeded rapidly, the officers of the royal army deserted, even those who were under the greatest obligations to James, aban doned him, and at length his own favourite daughter fled from him to the prince of Orange. The unfortunate monarch, finding his affairs desperate, resolved to fly into France; his few remaining friends vainly endeavoured to revive his courage ; he escaped, by night, on board a ship in the Medway, and after encountering some obstructions, landed at Ambleteuse, in Picardy, and thence hasted to St. Germains, whither he had been preceded by the queen and the prince of Wales. As it was impossible to wait until a parliament could be assembled, a convention was summoned, consisting of all the members of the three last parliaments who could be found at a short notice, the lord mayor of London, the court of aldermen, and fifty of the common council. The lower house, without a division, voted, that \" King James II. having endeavoured to subvert the constitution, by breaking the original contract between king and people, and having violated the fundamental laws, and withdrawn himself from the kingdom, had abdicated the government, and that the throne had thus become vacant.\" The lords rejected this resolution, but after a free conference between the houses, it was adopted by a small majority. The"], [246, "232 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. next question was, \" who should fill the vacant throne ? \" Several plans were proposed, but it was finally resolved, that William and Mary, prince and princess of Orange, should be declared king and queen of England; that on the death of cither, the survivor should retain royal power, and that on failure of their issue, the inheritance should devolve to the princess Anne. At the same time, public liberty was secured from the future exertions of the royal prerogative, by the Bill of Rights. Section IV. \u2014 General History of Europe, from the League of Augsburg to the formation of the Grand Alliance. The domestic history of England, during the reign of William III., is so remotely connected with the progress of the war to restrain the ambition of Louis XIV., that it will be convenient to limit our attention to the former, before commencing the narrative of the latter. Several parties, as we have seen, joined in effecting the revolution ; scarcely had they succeeded, when their old jealousies were renewed with aggravated fury. The Scottish convention made the establishment of presbyterianisni an essential part of the settlement of the crown ; the protestant sectarians in England were thus encouraged to hope for some modifications in the discipline of the English church ; they did obtain a general toleration, to the great disgust of the tory, or high-church party. Ireland remained faithful to James, though William not only offered wealth and dignity to the lord lieutenant, Tyrconnell, but promised to secure the catholics in their civil rights, and give them one-third of the churches. But the protestants, who had so recently been secured in their lands by the Acts of Settlement and Explanation, conscious that the justice of their titles would not bear a very rigid scrutiny, and dreading that, under a catholic monarch, and a catholic parliament, these acts might be repealed, boldly took up arms, and atoned for their deficiency of number by martial vigour and a daring spirit. They felt that under Cromwell they had won their possessions by the sword, and by the sword they were"], [247, "233 GENERAL HISTORY OF EUROPE. resolved to retain them. Some of them formed guerilla bands, and scoured the country ; others threw themselves into London derry, Enniskillen, and other garrison towns, resolved to hold out until aid could arrive from England. James, with a small French force, proceeded to Ireland, and convened a parliament in Dublin. The Act of Settlement was repealed, and all the protestants who favoured, or were supposed to favour, the prince of Orange, were declared guilty of high treason. But in the mean time, the adherents of the abdicated monarch had been ruined in Scotland by the loss of their leader, the brave Viscount Dundee, who fell in the arms of victory. The Highlanders who followed his standard dispersed, and the Jacobite party had no person of sufficient influence to collect another army. James began his operations in Ireland by the siege of Londonderry ; it was nobly defended by the inhabitants, whose religious enthu siasm more than supplied their deficiency in martial discipline. They were, however, on the point of sinking under the joint sufferings of fatigue and famine, when a reinforcement arrived from England, with provisions and ammunition, upon which the besiegers abandoned their undertaking. Ere James could recover from this disaster, the duke of Schomberg landed at Carrickfergus, with ten thousand men, but as the operations of this general were too slow for the impatience of the people of England, William followed with a considerable reinforcement, and hasted to meet his father-in-law. The hostile armies met on the 1st of July, 1690, on the banks of the river Boyne ; the skill of William procured him a victory which the cowardice of James rendered decisive ; he fled from the field of battle, and scarcely halting in Dublin, hasted to take shipping at Waterford for France, abandoning his faithful subjects to their fate. The Irish, though forsaken, did not despair ; they threw themselves into Limerick, which William immediately invested, but was finally forced to raise the siege. This failure was, however, compensated by the success of the earl of Marl borough, in Munster, who with five thousand men reduced Cork, Kinsale, and some other places of less importance. But Ireland was not yet subdued, and William entrusted the com pletion of the task to Baron Ginckle, who took Athlone almost"], [248, "234 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. in the presence of the Irish army, chiefly through the negligence of St. Ruth, whom Louis had sent over at the request of James. Stung with remorse, St. Ruth hazarded a battle at Aughrim, but he was defeated and slain. The Irish once more sought shelter in Limerick, which Ginckle once more besieged. All parties were now weary of the war, and a treaty was concluded at Limerick, by which it was stipulated that the catholics should enjoy the same toleration as in the reign of Charles II.; that they should be restored to the privileges of subjects, on taking the oath of allegiance ; and that as many as chose to follow the fortunes of the late monarch should be transported to the continent, at the expense of the government. About ten thousand men took advantage of the last article, and, under the name of the Irish brigades, were taken into the service of the king of France. William had, in the mean time, become disgusted with the constitutional jealousy of the whigs, and had sought the friendship of the tories, who were remarkable for their zealous support of the royal prerogative. But a sanguinary act of vengeance, the massacre of the Macdonalds of Glencoe, under circumstances of great treachery, brought so much odium on the new government, that James began to entertain some hopes of a restoration. A camp was formed between Cherbourg and La Hogue ; twenty thousand Irish and French soldiers were prepared to invade England, and a powerful navy was equipped to support the expedition. The whole was frustrated by the valour of the British seamen ; Admiral Russell having formed a junction with a Dutch squadron, attacked the French fleet off La Hogue, burned several of their men-of-war and transports, and drove the rest into their harbours. James beheld from the shore this annihilation of his hopes, but could not forbear expressing his admiration of the valour of his former subjects*. The death of Queen Mary revived the hopes of the Jacobites, as the partisans of the Stuarts were called ; but instead of open rebellion, they resolved to remove the king by assassination. The plot was discovered, and the nation was so disgusted with * \"When he saw the French fleet set on fire, he exclaimed, \" Ah ! none but my brave English tars could have performed so gallant an action ! \""], [249, "235 GENERAL HISTORY' OF EUROPE. the intended treachery, that William was restored to all his former popularity. From this time to the accession of Queen Anne, there is little worthy of note in the domestic history of England. On the death of the duke of Gloucester, the last protestant heir to the crown, an act was passed, by which the eventual succession was settled on Sophia, duchess dowager of Hanover and her heirs, being protestants (a.d. 1701). She was the grand daughter of James I., by the princess Elizabeth, married to the unfortunate elector-palatine. Party animosities between the whigs and tories were occasionally violent, and William III. was not always on the best of terms with his parliament. The emperor Leopold, the head of the league of Augsburg, was a prince of great abilities, sullied, however, too often by cruelty and bigotry. Though the chief of a confederacy for maintaining the liberties of Europe, he trampled on the privileges of his Hungarian subjects, and persecuted the protestants. But the overthrow of the Turks at Vienna, and the subsequent capture of Belgrade, left the discontented without an ally, and they were forced to submit in sdence. Louis was not daunted by the power of the league; he assembled two armies in Flanders, sent a third to check the Spaniards in Catalonia, and, to form a barrier on the side of Germany, ravaged the Palatinate with fire and sword (a.d. 1688). This barbarous policy filled Europe with horror ; men, women, and children, driven from their habitations, in the inclement month of February, wandered by the light of their own burning houses over the frozen fields, and fell victims by thousands to cold and hunger. Nor did this detestable expedient produce the desired effect ; the German armies, in the ensuing campaign, gained several important triumphs. Louis sought to recover his former superiority by nobler means; he entrusted his armies to new generals of approved talent, and the fortune of the war instantly changed. Savoy was overrun by the French Marshal Catinat ; Marshal Luxemburg gained a brilliant victory over the -allies in Flanders ; the united Dutch and English fleets were defeated off Beachy Head, and the Spaniards were scarcely able to defend Catalonia (a.d. 1690). Little was done on the side of Germany, for the emperor was once more assailed by Tekeli and the Turks, whose"], [250, "236 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. progress threatened the ruin of his hereditary dominions. Had this course of fortune continued,' Louis must have become the master of Europe, but in the following campaigns, the Turks, deprived of all their advantages, left the emperor at leisure to watch his western frontiers, and Catinat was driven from Italy by the duke of Savoy. But in Flanders, the French continued to be eminently successful. Mons and Namur were taken in spite of all the efforts which the united forces of the English and Dutch could make for their relief, and the allies were defeated in two great general engagements, by the duke of Luxemburg. But William III. was never daunted by ill success, and he adopted such prudent measures, that Luxemburg was unable to derive any important advantages from his victories. Similar success attended the armies of Louis in Savoy, Spain, and Germany; but the triumphs were equally unproductive. Even at sea, notwithstanding the recent loss at La Hogue, the French navy rode triumphant, and gained a decided superiority over the English and Dutch fleets. But France was exhausted by these efforts ; a dreadful famine ravaged the country, arising partly from an unfavourable season, and partly from the want of hands to till the ground ; and the finances of the state were fast falling into confusion. The allies, aware of these circum stances, made vigorous efforts to recover their losses, but they were generally unsuccessful, except on the side of Flanders, where William re-captured Namur, and thus, in some degree, retrieved his military reputation. All parties became weary of a war in which much blood was shed, much treasure expended, and no permanent acquisitions made. Negotiations were com menced under the mediation of Charles XL, of Sweden, at Ryswick (a. d. 1697), and a treaty concluded, in which Louis made many important concessions, to purchase an interval of tranquillity for his future projects. The French king's renun ciation of the Spanish succession, which it had been the main object of the war to enforce, was not even mentioned in the articles of pacification, and several other omissions left abundant grounds for a renewal of the war at no distant period. The emperor, though severely harassed by the Turks, con sented to the peace with great reluctance, and complained"], [251, "237 GENERAL HISTORY' OF EUROPE. bitterly of the desertion of his allies. But no one of the confederates derived more advantage from the treaty; he was enabled to direct his whole force against the Ottomans, who, under their new sultan, Mustapha II., became, for a brief space, formidable to Europe. The danger was averted by the celebrated Prince Eugene, of Savoy, who now began to attract admiration. After the peace of Ryswick, he took the command of the imperialists, and encountered Mustapha at Zenta, a small village on the banks of the river Theysse, in the kingdom of Hungary. The battle was brief, but, for its duration, one of the most sanguinary on record ; fifteen thousand Turks were slain, and eight thousand more drowned in their flight across the river ; their artillery, baggage, and ammunition, the sultan's magnificent pavilion, countless standards, and the great seal of the Ottoman empire, remained the prize of the victors ; the grand vizier, the aga of the janissaries, and twenty seven pachas, were among the victims of this fatal field. Mustapha, having vainly attempted to retrieve his losses in a new campaign, was forced to consent to the peace of Carlowitz, by which several provinces were resigned to the Austrians, Azof ceded to the Russians, now fast rising into importance under the administration of the Czar Peter, and the Venetians gratified by the cession of the Morea, anciently called the Peloponnesus. The deebning health of the king of Spain, Charles II., engaged the general attention of Europe, after the peace of Ryswick : three princes were candidates for the succession, Louis XIV., the emperor Leopold, and the elector of Bavaria. It is unnecessary to canvass their several claims, but it is manifest that the general interests of Europe pointed to the electoral prince as the most eligible of the competitors. A secret treaty of partition was concluded between William and Louis, but Charles II. received information of the transaction, and enraged that his dominions should be shared during his life, proclaimed the electoral prince of Bavaria sole heir. Scarcely, however, had this arrangement been made, when that prince died suddenly, not without strong suspicions of poison (a. d. 1699). A new treaty of partition was arranged by Holland, France, and England, but the emperor Leopold refused his concurrence,"], [252, "238 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. expecting to obtain for his family the inheritance of the whole Spanish monarchy. During these negotiations, the affections of the Scotch were alienated from William, by his sacrificing the settlement wdiich they had established at a great expense, on the isthmus of Darien, to quiet the fears of the Spaniards, and the commercial jealousy of the English. Could they have found leaders, they would probably have had recourse to arms, but fortunately they were contented to vent their rage in violent language and furious invective. Charles II. was long disposed to favour the Austrian claimant to his crown, but the arrogance of his queen, and her German favourites, alienated the nation from the court of Vienna, while the Spanish nobility and clergy urged the dying monarch to bestow the sovereignty on the house of Bourbon. Charles applied to the pope for advice : Innocent XII., who then filled the pontifical chair, was very jealous of the progress of the Austrian power in Italy, he therefore strenuously recommended the choice of a French prince; a new will was made, and Philip, duke of Anjou, second son of the dauphin, was nominated heir to the crown of Spain. Not long after, Charles died (a.d. 1701), and Louis, after some hesitation between the will and the partition treaty, proclaimed his grandson king of Spain and the Indies, under the title of Philip V. Though England and Holland were equally alarmed at this proceeding, both powers were obliged to acquiesce for a season. William found his parliament reluctant to engage in a new war, and Louis, by an unexpected movement against the barrier towns, had secured a great portion of the Dutch army. The emperor, however, commenced a war, claiming the duchy of Milan as a fief of the imperial crown, and his army, under the command of Prince Eugene, gained several advantages over Marshal Catinat, in Italy. During this campaign, the States general and William, having failed to obtain any satisfactory explanations of his designs from the French king, concluded a treaty, called the Grand Alliance, with the emperor. Its avowed objects were \"to procure satisfaction to his imperial majesty in the case of the Spanish succession ; obtain security to the English and Dutch for their dominions and commerce ;"], [253, "239 GENERAL HISTORY OF EUROPE. prevent the union of the monarchies of France and Spain, and hinder the French from possessing the Spanish dominions in America.\" But this treaty would probably have been frustrated by the English parliament, but for the imprudence with which Louis hazarded an insult to the British nation (a. d. 1701). On the death of James II., he caused his son, commonly called the Old Pretender, to be recognised king of Great Britain and Ireland, under the title of James III. The parliament at once entered heartily into the war, which they had hitherto disap proved, and their martial ardour was not abated by the death of William, who fell a victim to a fall from his horse, and the unskilfulness of an inexperienced surgeon (a.d. 1702). The intelligence of this event filled the allies with consternation ; but their fears were of short duration, for Queen Anne, who next ascended the throne, declared her resolution to adhere steadily to the policy of her predecessor. Section V. \u2014 The War of the Spanish Succession. Queen Anne gave vigour to the grand alliance, not only by the prompt declaration of her adhesion, but by her judicious choice of ministers ; Lord Godolphin was placed at the head of the treasury, and the earl of Marlborough, who was connected with the premier by marriage, was appointed commander-in-chief of the English army in Flanders, and ambassador extraordinary to the States-general. War was declared against France on the same day, at London, the Hague, and Vienna ; and the campaign was simultaneously opened in Italy, Germany, and Flanders (a. d. 1702). The earl of Marlborough, who commanded in Flanders, was the only one of the allied generals who obtained success; he captured several important towns, and would pro bably have defeated the French in the open field, had not his motions been fettered by the presence of the Dutch field deputies, who were too cautious or too timorous to allow of his hazardino- an ensraeement. At sea, the ancient renown of the English navy was re-established; Sir George Rooke sailed against"], [254, "240 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. Cadiz with a fleet of fifty sail, having with him the duke of Ormond, and an army of twelve thousand men. Cadiz was too strong to be taken, and Rooke sailed to Vigo, where the galleons, laden with the treasures of Spanish America, lay protected by a French fleet, and a formidable castle and batteries. The English admiral broke the boom that protected the narrow entrance into the inner harbour, Ormond stormed the castle, and the French, losing all hope, set fire to their ships. But the English and Dutch were at hand to extinguish the flames ; six ships of the line and nine galleons became the trophies of the conquerors. These losses, and the defection of the duke of Savoy, did not abate the courage of Louis, and the confederates, though joined by the king of Portugal, did not improve their advantages (a.d. 1703). The elector of Bavaria, the firm ally of France, being joined by Marshal Villars, gained a great victory over the imperialists at Hochstet, by which a road was opened to Vienna. The armies of Louis retained their superiority in Italy : even at sea the French disconcerted the plans of the confederates, and these disasters were poorly compensated by the acquisition of a few fortified towns in Flanders, which were captured by Marl borough. Even these slight successes gave courage to the allies; the English parliament voted liberal supplies for continuing the war, and the emperor, though menaced on one side by the Hungarian insurgents, and on the other by the French and Bavarians, ordered his second son, Charles, to assume the title of king of Spain, and to proceed to Portugal, for the purpose of invading that country. Marlborough had hitherto been greatly impeded by the timid caution of his Dutch colleagues ; he concerted the plan of his next campaign with a more congenial spirit, Prince Eugene. As his Flemish conquests, in the preceding campaigns, had secured a good barrier for the United Provinces, Marlborouob. now advanced to the title of duke, leaving the defence of the fortresses to the Dutch garrisons, concentrated his forces, with the professed design of invading France, and then suddenly marched into Germany. A junction was effected with the imperialists, the elector of Bavaria's lines at Donawert were forced, and the allies advanced to the Danube. The Bavarian"], [255, "241 THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. prince, having been reinforced by thirty thousand French under the command of Marshal Tallard, resolved to hazard a battle, and the duke having been joined by Prince Eugene, with an equal number, eagerly sought for an engagement (August 13, A. D. 1704). The French and Bavarians were advantageously posted on a hill, between the Danube and the village of Blenheim ; but their line was weakened by detachments, and Marlborough, taking advantage of their error, charged throuoh.. and won a decisive victory. Thirty thousand French and Bavarians were killed, wounded, or taken ; their camp equi page, baggage, artillery, and standards, became the prize of the conquerors; Tallard was taken prisoner, and the Bavarian prince narrowly escaped the same fate. The allies, however, suffered very severely, their loss amounted to no less than five thousand killed, and seven thousand wounded. The consequences of this brilliant but bloody victory were, the immediate liberation of the emperor from all danger; the Hungarian insurgents were terrified into submission, Bavaria was abandoned by its sovereign to the ravages of the imperialists, and the shattered relics of the French army were driven to seek shelter within their own frontiers. The moral influences of the victory were even of more importance than the immediate results ; it not only compensated for the ill success of the allies in Italy and Spain, but changed the whole complexion of the war. At sea the English navy began to retrieve its fame; though Sir George Rooke failed in an attack on Barcelona, he stormed Gibraltar, a fortress hitherto deemed impregnable, and gained a glorious but unprofitable victory over the French fleet off Malaga. Had all the allies exhibited the same vigour as the English, Louis must have been speedily ruined ; but the Germans were sluggish ; the death of the emperor Leopold, and the accession of his more enterprising son Joseph, made no change in their policy (a.d. 1705): the prince of Baden, the general of the imperialists, obstinately refused to join Marlborough on the Moselle, and the allies could attempt no conquest of importance in Flanders. In Italy, the French obtained so many advantages that the duke of Savoy was forced to shut himself up in his M"], [256, "242 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. capital, where he was besieged, with little prospect of relief, but on the side of Spain, the allied arms were crowned with brilliant success. Sir John Lcake defeated a French fleet off Gibraltar, and thus forced the Marshal de Tesse to raise the siege of that fortress ; the confederates, entering Spain on the Portuguese side, captured several places in Estremadura, while the earl of Peterborough, having been convoyed by Sir Cloudesly Shovel to the coast of Catalonia, took the important city of Barcelona, and established the authority of Charles III. in the whole province of Catalonia, and the greater part of the kingdom of Valencia. These variations of success inflamed the courage and obstinacy of the belligerent powers. Louis was so elated, that he ordered Marshal Villcroy to act on the offensive in Flanders, while his Italian army besieged Turin, and the forces he sent into Germany drove the prince of Baden and the imperialists before them (a.d. 1706). The English parliament, now composed principally of whigs, showed the greatest eagerness for the prosecution of the war, and voted liberal supplies for the ensuing campaign. Marlborough joined the united army of Holland and England in May, and soon after received a subsidiary Danish force. Villeroy, relying on his superior strength, advanced to attack the allies, and the two armies met near the village of Ramillies. The French marshal posted his left wing behind a morass, where it could not be attacked, but where it was equally incapable of advancing against the enemy. Marlborough took immediate advantage of this error ; amusing the French left wing by a feigned attack, he poured his infantry in masses on the centre ; they encountered a brave resistance, but the duke, bringing up the cavalry just as the French lines began to waver, broke through them with a headlong charge, and in an instant, Villeroy's army was a helpless mass of confusion. Seven thou sand of the French were slain, six thousand taken prisoners, and a vast quantity of artillery and ammunition abandoned to the victors. The loss of the allies, in killed and wounded, did not exceed three thousand five hundred men. The results of this brilliant victory were the immediate con quest of Brabant, and almost all the Spanish Netherlands ; but"], [257, "243 THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. its consequences were felt even in Italy. Marshal Vendomc having been recalled to remedy, if possible, Villeroy's disaster, Prince Eugene resolved to raise the siege of Turin, and baffled the efforts of the duke of Orleans to obstruct his march. Orleans therefore joined the besieging army, and as a battle was manifestly inevitable, the French marshals anxiously deliberated whether they should wait for the enemy in their intrenchments. The majority voted against the measure, but Marshal Marsin produced an order, signed by the king, immediately after receiving the account of his defeat at Ramillies, commanding his oenerals not to offer but to wait for battle. This order hurt the pride and confused the measures of the duke of Orleans : while the French generals were angrily debating what arrange ments should be made, Prince Eugene and the duke of Savoy fell upon their lines ; the French got entangled in their extensive intrenchments, the \"river Doria running through their camp prevented one part of their army from coming to the assistance of the other ; they were speedily routed, and fled with precipi tation, not halting until they had passed their own frontiers. In men, the loss of the French army was not great, but they abandoned all their cannon, baggage, ammunition, and military chest. By this single blow, the house of Bourbon lost the duchies of Milan and Mantua, the principality of Piedmont, and eventually the kingdom of Naples. That the success of the allies was not equally decisive in Spain, must be attributed to the want of energy and Austrian sluo-oishness of the archduke Charles. Philip besieged his rival in Barcelona, but was forced to retire by the appearance of Sir John Leake, with an English squadron, before the town. The retreat was made in great disorder, partly occasioned by an eclipse of the sun, which the superstitious Spaniards regarded as an omen of their ruin. Forty thousand English and Portuguese, under the command of the earl of Galway and the marquis de las Minas advanced through Estremadura towards Madrid, and Philip was forced to abandon his capital ; at the same time, the count de Santa Cruz surrendered Carthagena and the galleys, to the allied powers. Had the archduke gone immediately to Madrid, and closely pressed his rival, the crown of Spain would M 2"], [258, "244 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. probably have been lost to the house of Bourbon, but he lingered unaccountably in the neighbourhood of Barcelona, until Philip and the duke of Berwick*, having collected a superior army, compelled the English and Portuguese to abandon Madrid. Carthao-ena was soon after recovered, but this was more than compensated by the loss of the islands of Majorca and Ivica, which surrendered to the English fleet under Sir John Leake. Louis was so disheartened by his losses, that he sought for peace on very humble conditions, but the allies, intoxicated with success, demanded such humiliating terms, that he resolved to try the hazards of another campaign. While the English ministers were lavishing blood and treasure to support foreign wars, they did not neglect the internal affairs of the nation. A treaty, for uniting England and Scotland under one legislature, was ratified by the parliaments of both countries ; but the Scottish nation generally was opposed to a union that galled their national pride, and the advantages of which time alone could develope (a.d. 1707)- Louis derived one advantage from his recent misfortunes ; the expulsion of his forces from Italy enabled him to send powerful succours into Spain, where the allies were acting with the greatest negligence and misconduct. The earl of Galway and the marquis de las Minas having exhausted all their provisions in Valencia, attempted to pass into New Castile; the duke of Berwick having received large reinforcements, and aware that the allies 'had been weakened by the departure of the archduke, did not hesitate to attack them at Almanza, and won a victory as complete as any that had been obtained during the war. This great triumph restored the cause of the Bourbons in Spain ; and similar success attended the French army in Germany, where the Marshal Villars penetrated to the Danube, and laid the duchy of Wirtemberg under contribution. Nothing of im portance occurred in Flanders, and the only naval enterprise was the siege of Toulon. Prince Eugene, and the duke of Savoy, marched through France to besiege this great port, while Sir Cloudesly Shovel appeared off the coast to second their opera- * The duke of Berwick was the natural son of James II., aud one of the ablest generals in the service of France."], [259, "245 THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. tions. But, unfortunately, the garrison of Toulon had been reinforced two hours before the appearance of the allies; they retreated through Provence, wasting the country as they passed, and diffusing consternation almost to the gates of Paris. Nor was this the only evil that Louis suffered from the invasion ; the detachments withdrawn from the army of Marshal Villars so weakened that general, that he was forced to relinquish his high projects in Germany, and repass the Rhine, instead of advancing beyond the Danube. Great expectations had been formed in England, which the results of the campaign miserably disappointed ; Godolphin and Marlborough lost a considerable share of their popularity ; they were opposed even by the members of \u2022the cabinet, and though they persuaded the queen to dismiss Mr. Secretary Harley, and Mr. St. John, they saw that their influence with her majesty, and their power in parliament, had been considerably diminished (a.d. 1708). Marlborough felt that a vigorous campaign was essential to his future interests, especially as the duke de Vendome had, by treachery, gained possession of Ghent and Bruges ; he, therefore, resolved to risk a general battle, and, crossing the Scheldt, came up with the French army strongly posted at Oudenarde. The British cavalry broke their opponents at the first charge, the French lines fell into confusion, and though the approach of darkness prevented the allies from completing their victory, the enemy fled in such disorder, that nine thousand were taken prisoners, and nearly six thousand deserted. Marlborough, being \" reinforced by Prince Eugene, undertook the siege of Lisle, the principal city in French Flanders, and though it was vigorously defended by Marshal Boufflers, it was forced to surrender after a siege of two months, while Ghent and Bruges were recovered ere the close of the campaign. Nothing of importance occurred in Italy, Germany, or Spain ; but the English fleet conquered the island of Sardinia, and terrified the pope into the acknowledgment of the archduke Charles, as lawful king of Spain. The confidence of the allies now rose to the highest pitch ; Godolphin and Marlborough found the English parliament ready to grant additional supplies ; the Dutch agreed to augment their"], [260, "246 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. troops, and the imperialists promised to lay aside their inactivity. Louis, on the contrary, disheartened by defeat, his treasury exhausted, his councils distracted, and his kingdom suffering from famine, offered to purchase peace by every concession that could reasonably be demanded (a. d. 1709). Once more his proffers were rejected, except upon conditions inconsistent with his personal honour and the safety of his kingdom, and once more he appealed to the hazards of war. The confederates in Flanders, finding that Marshal Villars had taken a position from which he could not be dislodged, laid siege to Tournay, and on the surrender of that place invested Mons. Villars, unable to relieve the place, took possession of a strong camp at Malplaquet, whence he trusted that he could harass the besiegers. The confederates, elated with past success, resolved to attack the French in their intrenchments. Few battles, since the invention of gunpow7der, have been more obstinate and bloody ; victory finally declared in favour of the allies, but it was dearly purchased by the loss of fifteen thousand men ; while the French, who had fought under cover, lost only ten thousand. Mons was now closely invested, and the surrender of that important place closed the campaign. Nothing of importance occurred in Germany, Italy, or Spain ; but Louis, finding his resources exhausted, once again made an unsuccessful effort to obtain peace. Conferences were opened at Gertruydenberg (a. d. 1710), but the allies, influenced by Marlborough and Prince Eugene, rejected the propositions of the French king; he was, however, unwilling to break off the negociations, and the conferences were continued even after the hostile armies had actually taken the field. The duke of Marlborough took several fortified places in Flanders ; but nothing of importance was done in Germany or Piedmont ; and the misfortunes of the allies in Sisain more than counterbalanced their other successes. The archduke Charles, aided by the English general, Stanhope, twice defeated his rival, and a second time gained possession of Madrid; instead of improving these advantages, he loitered in the capital, until forced to retire by the united forces of the French and Spaniards, under the duke of Vendome. The allies retired towards Cats-"], [261, "247 THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. Ionia, and marched, for the sake of subsistence, in two bodies. Stanhope, who commanded the rear division, allowed himself to be surrounded at Brihuega, and was forced to surrender at discretion. Staremberg, who led the principal division, was soon after forced to engage at a disadvantage, but he made such able dispositions, that Vendome was compelled to retreat, and the imperialists continued their march in safety. They were, however, so weakened and dispirited by Stanhope's misfortune, that they could not check the victorious progress of Philip. A revolution in the English cabinet proved of more conse quence to Louis, than even the success of his arms in Spain. The queen, a woman of feeble mind, had long been under the influence of the duchess of Marlborough, who did not always use her power with discretion. A new favourite, Mrs. Masham, supplanted the duchess, and w7as gained over by Harley and St. John, to induce the queen to make a total change in the administration. This would have been impossible, if the whigs had continued to enjoy the confidence of the nation ; but many circumstances contributed to diminish their popularity. The weight of taxes, occasioned by the expenses of the war, began to be felt as a burden, when victories, from their very frequency,' ceased to excite joy ; the conduct of the allies, who contrived that \" England should fight for all and pay for all,\" gave just dissatisfaction ; and the rejection of the French king's offers at Gertruydenberg was justly regarded as the triumph of private ambition over public policy. In addition to these grounds of discontent, the tories raised the cry that the \" Church was in danger,\" on account of the favour shown to the dissenters ; and the whigs, instead of allowing the imputation to refute itself, unwisely attempted to silence the clamour by force. Dr. Henry Sacheverell preached a sermon before the lord mayor, in which he bitterly attacked the dissenters, and advocated the exploded doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance. Though it was but a poor contemptible production, such is the violence of party, that it was printed, and forty thousand copies are said to have been sold in a week. In another week, it would probably have been forgotten, had not Godolphin, who was personally attacked in the Commons, persuaded his friends to make it"], [262, "248 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. the subject of a parliamentary impeachment. Common sense revolted from such an absurdity ; the generous feelings of the nation were enlisted on the side of the preacher, and this spmpathy was soon transferred to his cause. During his trial, the populace showed the liveliest zeal in his behalf ; and when he was found guilty, the House of Lords, dreading popular tumults, passed a sentence so lenient, that it was hailed by the tories as a triumph. The persecution of Sacheverell was the ruin of the whigs ; the queen, aware of their unpopularity, dismissed all her ministers except the duke of Marlborough ; and a new cabinet was formed under the avispices of Mr. Harley, who was soon after created earl of Oxford. A new parliament was summoned, in which the tories had an overwhelming majority (a. d. 1711), but the ministers did not abandon the foreign policy of their predecessors ; and copious supplies were voted for the main tenance of the war. But an unexpected event changed the situations and views of all parties. The emperor Joseph died without issue ; his brother Charles, the claimant of the Spanish crown, succeeded to the empire, and the liberties of Europe were thus exposed to as much danger from the aggrandizement of the house of Austria, as from that of the Bourbon family. The campaign was languidly conducted in every quarter, and ere its conclusion, the English ministers were secretly negociating with France. After many disgraceful intrigues, in which all the actors sacrificed the interests of the nation to party purposes, the duke of Marlborough was stripped of all his employments, and con ferences for a general peace commenced at Utrecht. The successive deaths of the dauphin of France, his son the duke of Burgundy, and his grandson the duke of Bretagne, left only the sickly duke of Anjou between Philip and the throne of France. The union of the French and Spanish monarchies filled the confederates with no unreasonable apprehensions, and the English ministers were obliged to threaten that they would renew the war, unless Philip renounced his right of succession to the throne of France (a. d. 1712). When this important point was obtained, the English and French agreed upon a"], [263, "THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. 249 cessation of arms; the Dutch and imperialists continued the campaign, but with such ill-success that they were induced to renew the conferences for peace. On the 31st of March, 1713, the treaties between the different powers were signed at Utrecht, by the plenipotentiaries of France, England, Prussia, recently exalted into a kingdom, Savoy, and the United Provinces. The emperor held out until the following year, when he signed a treaty at Rastadt, less favourable than that which had been offered at Utrecht ; and the king of Spain, with more reluctance, gave his adhesion to the general arrangements. Few subjects have been more fiercely contested than the conduct of the English ministers, in relation to the treaty of Utrecht ; the reason is perfectly obvious : both the political. parties that divided the nation had acted wrong ; the whigs continued the war after all its reasonable objects had been gained ; the tories concluded a peace, in which the advantages that England might have claimed, from the success of her arms, were wantonly sacrificed. The people of England generally disliked the peace, and the commercial treaty with France was rejected by a majority of nine votes, in the House of Commons. The whigs now began to pretend that the protestant succession was in danger, and the alarm spreading rapidly brought back to their party a large share of its former popularity. Nor were these apprehensions groundless ; through the influence of the Jacobites, the earl of Oxford was removed from his office, and a new administration, more favourable to the house of Stuart, formed under the auspices of St. John, Lord Bolingbroke. But before the court of St. Germains could derive any advantage from this change, the queen, harassed by the intrigues and quarrels of her servants, sunk into a lethargy, and her death disappointed the hopes of the pretender and his adherents (August 1st, 1714). Several whig lords, without being sum moned, attended the council, which was of course held at the demise of the crown, and the tories, overawed, concurred in issuing an order for the proclamation of the elector of Hanover, as George I., king of Great Britain and Ireland. M 2"], [264, "250 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. Section VI. \u2014 Peter the Great of Russia. Charles NIL. of Sweden. In the two last chapters, we have confined our attention to the wars which the ambition of Louis XIV. excited in the south and west of Europe; during this period, the northern and eastern divisions of Christendom were occupied by the rivalry of two of the most extraordinary men that ever appeared on the stage of human life, Peter the Great of Russia, and Charles XII. of Sweden. Before entering on their history, we must take a brief retrospect of the affairs of the North, after the accession of the Czar Alexis, and the resignation of Queen Christina. Under the administration of Alexis, Russia began rapidly to emerge from the barbarism into which it had been plunged by the Mongolian invasion and subsequent civil wars. He reformed the laws, encouraged commerce, and patronized the arts; he recovered Smolensko from the Poles, and prevented the Turks from establishing their dominion over the Cossack tribes. His son Theodore, though of a weak constitution, steadily pursued the same course of vigorous policy. \" He lived,\" says a, native Russian historian, \" the joy and delight of his people, and died amidst their sighs and tears. On the day of his decease, Moscow was in the same state of distress which Rome felt at the death of Titus.\" John, the brother and successor of Theodore, was a prince of weak intellects ; his ambitious sister, Sophia, seized for a time on the sovereignty, excluding her young brother Peter, to whom Theodore had bequeathed the crown. During seven years of boyhood, Peter endured Sophia's galling yoke, but when he reached his seventeenth year, he took advantage of the general indignation excited by the misconduct of the government, to shut that princess up in a nunnery, and banish her favourite into a distant part of the empire. Denmark was the scene of an extraordinary revolution (a. d. 1661) : the tyranny of the aristocracy arose to such a heio-ht, that the clergy and commons voted for the surrender of their liberties to the king, and Ferdinand III., almost without any effort of his own, was thus invested with absolute power. On"], [265, "251 PETER THE GREAT AND CHARLES XII. his death (a. d. 1670), his successor, Christian V., commenced war against Charles XL, king of Sweden, who, though assailed by a powerful league, defended himself with great ability and success. Charles XL, after the restoration of peace, tried to make himself as absolute as the kings of Denmark, but he died prematurely (a. d. 1697), leaving his crown to his son Charles XII., who has been deservedly styled the Alexander of the North. Peter the Great commenced his reign by defeating tljp Turks, from whom he wrested the advantageous port of Azof, which opened to his subjects the commerce of the Black Sea. This acquisition enlarged his views ; he resolved to make Russia the centre of trade between Europe and Asia, to connect the Dwina, the Volga, and the Don, by canals, thus opening a water communication between the northern seas, and the Black and the Caspian Seas. To complete this magnificent plan, he determined to build a city on the Baltic Sea, which should be the emporium of northern commerce, and the capital of his dominions. A still greater proof of his wisdom, and of his anxiety to secure the prosperity of his subjects, was his under taking a tour through Europe, for the purpose of acquiring instruction and bringing back to his subjects the improvements of more civilized nations. In 1698, having established a regency, to direct the government during his absence, he departed from his dominions as a private gentleman, in i the train of the ambassadors that he had sent to the principal courts of Europe. Amsterdam, at that time one of the most flourishing commercial cities in Europe, was the first place that arrested his attention ; he entered himself as a common carpenter, in one of the principal dock-yards, labouring and living exactly like the other work men. Thence he came to England, where he examined and studied the principal naval arsenals. King William presented the czar with an elegant yacht, and permitted him to engage several ingenious artificers in his service. After a year's absence, Peter returned home, greatly improved himself, and accompanied by a train of men well qualified to instruct his subjects. Anxious to extend his dominions on the eastern side of the Baltic, he entered into an alliance against Sweden, with Frederic"], [266, "252 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. Augustus, elector of Saxony, who had succeeded John Sobieski, on the throne of Poland, and Frederic IV., king of Denmark (a. d. 1700). The Danes commenced the war by invading the territories of the duke of Holstein-Gottorp, brother-in-law and ally of the king of Sweden. Their progress was slower than .they expected ; and, in the midst of their career, they were arrested bv intelligence of the dangers that menaced their own J ft o capital. Charles XII., undaunted by the power of the league, resolved^) carry the war into the dominions of Denmark ; whilst his fleet, strengthened by an English squadron, blockaded Copenhagen, he suddenly embarked his troops at Carlscrona, and having easily effected a passage, laid siege to the city by land. Frederic, cut off from his dominions by the Swedish cruisers, and alarmed by the imminent danger of his fleet and capital, concluded a peace highly honourable to the Swedes, leaving his Russian and Polish allies to continue the contest. No sooner had Charles concluded the treaty, than he resolved to turn his arms against the Russians, who were besieging Narva with a force of eighty thousand men ; though his own army did not exceed ten thousand, the heroic king of Sweden boldly resolved to attack his enemies in their intrenchments. As soon as his artillery had opened a small breach, he commanded his men to advance to the charge with fixed bayonets. A storm of snow, that blew full in their faces, added to the confusion into which the undisciplined Russians were thrown by this daring assault ; the very superiority of their numbers added to their confusion ; after a contest of three hours' duration they were totally routed ; eighteen thousand of the besiegers sell in the battle or flight, thirty thousand remained prisoners ; all their artillery, baggage, and ammunition, became the prey of the conquerors. The czar was not disheartened by this defeat, which he attributed to the right cause, the ignorance and bar barism of his subjects; \" I knew,\" he said, \" that, the Swedes would beat us, but they will teach us to become conquerors in our turn.\" Though at the head of forty thousand men, he did not venture to encounter his rival, but evacuated the provinces that he had invaded. Having wintered at Narva, Charles marched against the"], [267, "253 PETER TnE GREAT AND CHARLES XII. Poles and Saxons, who were encamped in the neighbourhood of Riga ; he forced a passage across the Duna, and gained a com plete victory. Thence he entered as a conqueror into Courland and Lithuania, scarcely encountering any opposition. Encouraged by this success, he formed the project of dethroning King Augustus, who had lost the affection of the Poles, by the undisguised preference which he showed for his Saxon subjects. With this design, he entered into a secret correspondence with Radzrewiski, the cardinal primate, by whose means such a spirit of opposition was raised in the diet and senate, that Augustus sought peace as his only means of safety. Charles refused to treat unless the Poles elected a new king ; and Augustus, con vinced that he could only protect his crown by the sword, led his army to meet the Swedes, in a spacious plain near Clissau (a. d. 1702). The Polish monarch had with him about twenty-four thousand men, the forces of Charles did not exceed half that number ; but the Swedes, flushed by recent conquests, gained a complete victory ; and Augustus, after having made in vain the most heroic efforts to rally his troops, was forced to fly, leaving the enemy in possession of all his artillery and baggage. A second triuinjih at Pultusk, in the following campaign, gave such encouragement to the enemies of Augustus, that he was formally deposed by the diet (a. d. 1704), and the vacant crown given to Stanislaus Leczinski, who had been nominated by the king of Sweden. Peter had not been in the mean time inactive ; though he had not given much assistance to his ally Augustus, he had made a powerful diversion by invading Ingria, and taking Narva, so recently the scene of his misfortunes, by storm. At the same time, he founded his projected capital in the heart of his new conquests, and by his judicious measures protected the rising city from the attacks of the Swedish generals. St. Petersburgh, founded on a marshy island in the river Neva, during a destruc tive war, and surrounded by countries recently subdued or still hostile, rose rapidly into importance, and remained in perfect security whilst all around was in confusion. Augustus had not yet resigned all hopes of recovering his crown ; he concerted a scheme of operations with Peter, and sixty thousand Russians"], [268, "254 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. entered Poland to drive the Swedes from their recent acquisitions. Charles was not daunted by the numbers of his enemies ; he routed the Russian divisions successively, and inspired such terror by the rapidity of his movements, which seemed almost miraculous, that the Russians retreated into their own country (a. d. 1706). In the mean time, a victory obtained by a division of the Swedish army over the Saxons, opened to Charles a passage into the hereditary dominions of his rival, and crossing the Oder, he appeared in Saxony at the head of twenty-four thousand men. Augustus was forced to conclude peace on the most humiliating conditions. Charles wintered in Germany, where his presence created considerable alarm. He demanded from the emperor toleration for the protestants of Silesia, and the relinquishment of the quota which Sweden was bound to furnish for its German provinces. Involved in the war of the succession, Joseph submitted *, and the fears with which the presence of Charles filled the allied powers were soon dispersed by his departure in quest of new adventuress. From Saxony, Charles marched back into Poland, where Peter was making some ineffectual efforts to revive the party of Augustus. Peter retired before his rival, who, had, however, the satisfaction of defeating an army of twenty thousand Russians, strongly intrenched. Intoxicated by success, he rejected the czar's offers of peace, declaring that he would treat * The pope was greatly displeased by the emperor's restoring the Silesian churches to the protestants; Joseph facetiously replied to his remonstrances, \" Had the king of Sweden demanded that I should become a Lutheran myself, I do not know what might have been the consequence.\" \u25a0f- The duke of Marlborough went into Saxony to dissuade the Swedish monarch from accepting the offers of Louis XIV. Marlborough was too cautious a politician to enter immediately on the object of his mission. He complimented Charles on his victories, and even expressed his anxiety to derive instruction in the art of war from so eminent a commander. In the course of the conversation, Marlborough perceived that Charles had a rooted aversion to, and was not, therefore, likely to form an alliance with Louis. A map of Eussia lying open before the king, and the anger with which Charles spoke of Peter, revealed to the duke the real intentions of the Swedish monarch. He, therefore, took his leave without making any proposals, convinced that the disputes of Charles with the emperor might easily be accommodated, as all his demands woidd be granted."], [269, "255 PETER THE GREAT AND CHARLES XII. at Moscow * ; and without forming any systematic plan of opera tions, he crossed the frontiers, resolved on the destruction of that ancient city. Peter prevented the advance of the Swedes, on the direct line, by destroying the roads and desolating the country : Charles, after having endured great privations, turned off towards the Ukraine, whither he had been invited by Mazeppa, the chief of the Cossacks, who, disgusted by the conduct of the czar, had resolved to throw oft* his allegiance. In spite of all the obstacles that nature and the enemy could throw in his way, Charles reached the place of rendezvous ; but he had the mortification to find Mazeppa appear in his camp, as a fugitive, rather than an ally, for the czar had discovered his treason, and disconcerted his schemes by the punishment of his associates. A still greater misfortune to the Swedes was the loss of the convoy and the ruin of the rc-inforcement they had expected from Livonia. General Lewcnhaupt, to whose care it was entrusted, had been forced into three general engagements by the Russians ; and though he had eminently distinguished him self by his courage and conduct, he was forced to set fire to his wagons to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy. Undaunted by these misfortunes, Charles continued the campaign even in the depth of a winter t, so severe that two thousand * When Peter was informed of this haughty answer, he coolly replied, \" My brother Charles affects to play the part of Alexander, but I hope he will not find in me a Darius.\" \u2022f- This catastrophe is powerfully described by Campbell : \u2014 Oh ! learn the fate that bleeding thousands bore, Led by their Charles to Dnieper's sandy shore. \u2014 Faint from his wounds, and shivering hi the blast, The Swedish soldier sunk and groaned his last ; File after file the stormy showers benumb, Freeze every standard sheet and hush the drum Horseman and horse confessed the bitter pang, And arms and warrior fell with hollow clang.

At length, he laid siege to Pultowa, a fortified city on the frontiers of the Ukraine, which contained one of the czar's principal magazines. The garrison was numerous, and the resistance obstinate, Charles himself was dangerously wounded in the heel, while viewing the works; and while he was still confined to his tent, he learned that Peter was advancing with a numerous army to raise the siege. Leaving seven thousand men to guard the works, Charles ordered his soldiers to march and meet the enemy, while he accompanied them in a litter (July 8th, 1709). The desperate charge of the Swedes broke the Russian cavalry, but the infantry stood firm, and gave the horse an opportunity of rallying in the rear. In the mean time, the czar's artillery made dreadful havoc in the Swedish line ; and Charles, who had been forced to abandon his cannon in his forced marches, in vain contended against this formidable disadvantage. After a dreadful combat of more than two hours' duration, the Swedish army was irretrievably ruined ; eight thousand of their best troops were left dead on the field, six thousand were taken prisoners, and about twelve thousand of the fugitives were soon after forced to surrender on the banks of the Dnieper, from want of boats to cross the river. Charles, accompanied by about three hundred of his guards, escaped to Bender, a Turkish town in Bessarabia, abandoning all his treasures to his rival, including the rich spoils of Poland and Saxony. Few victories have ever had such important consequences as that which the czar won at Pultowa ; in one fatal day Charles lost the fruits of nine years' victories ; the veteran army that had been the terror of Europe was completely ruined ; those who escaped from the fatal field were taken prisoners, but they found a fate scarcely better than death, for they were trans ported by the czar to colonize the wilds of Siberia ; the elector of Saxony re-entered Poland, and drove Stanislaus from the throne ; the kings of Denmark * and Prussia revived old claims * The Danish monarch invaded Schonen, but his troops were defeated by the Swedish militia, and a few regiments of the line, commanded by General Steenbock.

Indeed, but for the interference of the German emperor and the maritime powers, the Swedish monarchy would have been rent in pieces. Charles, in his exile, formed a new plan for the destruction of his hated rival ; he instigated the Turks to attempt the conquest of Russia, and flattered himself that he might yet enter Moscow at the head of a Mohammedan army. The bribes which Peter lavishly bestowed on the councillors of the sultan, for a time frustrated these intrigues ; but Charles, through his friend Poniatowski, informed the sultan of his vizier's corruption, and procured the deposition of that minister. Kupruli, who suc ceeded to the office of vizier, was averse to a Russian war, but he was removed at the end of two months, and the seals of office oiven to the pacha of Syria, who commenced his admini stration by sending the Russian ambassador to the prison of the Seven Towers. The czar made the most vigorous preparations for the new war by which he was menaced (a. d. 1711)- The Turkish vizier, on the other hand, assembled all the forces of the Ottoman empire in the plains of Adrianople. Demetrius Cantemir, the hospodar of Moldavia, believing that a favourable opportunity presented itself for delivering his country from the Mohammedan yoke, invited the czar to his aid ; and the Russians, rapidly advancing, reached the northern banks of the Pruth near Yassi, the Moldavian capital. Here the Russians found that the promises of Prince Cantemir were illusory, the Moldavians, happy under the Turkish sway, treated the invaders as enemies, and refused to supply them with provisions ; in the mean time, the vizier arriving, formed a fortified camp in their front, while his vast hosts of light cavalry swept round their lines and ctft off all foraging parties. The Russians defeated three successive attempts to storm their intrenchments,; but they must have yielded to the effects of fatigue and famine, had not the empress Catherine*, who accompanied her husband * Catherine was a Livonian captive, of low condition, whom the emperor first saw waiting at table.

A treaty was concluded, on terms which, though severe, were more favourable than Peter, under the circumstances, could reasonably have hoped; the Russians retired in safety, and Charles reached the Turkish camp, only to learn the downfall of all his expectations. A new series of intrigues, in the court of Constantinople, led to the appointment of a new vizier ; but this minister was little inclined to gratify the king of Sweden ; on the contrary, warned by the fate of his predecessors, he resolved to remove him from the Ottoman empire (a. d. 1713). Charles continued to linger, even after he had received a letter of dismissal from the sultan's own hand, he resolved to remain, and when a resolution was taken to send him away by force, he determined, with his few attendants, to dare the whole strength of the Turkish empire. After a fierce resistance, he was captured, and conveyed a prisoner to*Adrianople ; on his road, he learned that Stanislaus, whom he had raised to the throne of Poland, was likewise a Turkish captive ; but, bvioyed up by ardent hopes, he sent a message to his fellow-sufferer, never to make peace with Augustus. Another revolution in the divan revived the hopes of Charles, and induced him to remain in Turkey, when his return to the North would probably have restored him to his former eminence. The Swedes, under General Steenboek, gained one of the most brilliant victories that had been obtained during the war, over the united forces of the Danes and Saxons, at Gadebusch, in the duchy of Mecklenburgh ; but the conqueror sullied his fame by burning the defenceless town of Altona, an an outrage which excited the indignation of all Europe. This, however, was the last service that Steenboek could perform to his absent master ; unable to prevent the junction of the Russians with the Danes and Saxons, he retreated before superior numbers, and, by the artifices of Baron Goertz, obtained tempo rary refuge in a fortress belonging to the duke of Holstein. The allies, however, pursued their advantages so vigorously that Steenboek and his followers were forced to yield themselves prisoners of war. Goertz, however, in some degree averted the consequences of this calamity, by a series of political intrigues,"], [273, "259 PETER THE GREAT AND CnARLES XII. which excited various jealousies and discordant interests between the several enemies of Sweden. The czar in the mean time pushed forward his conquests on the side of Finland ; and the glory of his reign appeared to be consummated by a naval victory obtained over the Swedes, near the island of Oeland (a. d. 1714). This unusual success was celebrated by a triumphal entry into St. Petersburgh, at which Peter addressed his subjects on the magnitude of the advantages they had derived from his government. Charles heard of his rival's progress unmoved; bnt when he learned that the Swedish senate intended to make his sister regent, and to make peace with Russia and Denmark, he announced his intention of returning home. He was honourably escorted to' the Turkish frontiers ; but though orders had been given that he should be received with all due honour in the imperial dominions, he traversed Germany incognito, and towards the close of the year reached Stralsund, the capital of Swedish Pomerania. Charles, at the opening of the next campaign, found himself surrounded with enemies (a.d. 1715). Stralsund itself was besieoed by the united armies of the Prussians, Danes, and Saxons ; while the Russian fleet, which now rode triumphant in the Baltic, threatened a descent upon Sweden. After an obsti nate defence, in which the Swedish monarch displayed all his accustomed bravery, Stralsund was forced to capitulate, Charles having previously escaped in a small vessel to his native shores. All Europe believed the Swedish monarch undone ; it was supposed that he could no longer defend his own dominions, when to the inexpressible astonishment of every one, it was announced that he had invaded Norway. His attention, how ever, was less engaged by the war than by the gigantic intrigues of his new favourite Goertz, who, taking advantage of a coolness between the Russians and the other enemies of Sweden, proposed that Peter and Charles should unite in strict amity, and dictate the law to Europe. A part of this daring plan was the removal of the elector of Hanover from the English throne, and the restoration of the exiled Stuarts. But while the negociations were yet in progress, Charles invaded Norway a second time, and invested the castle of Frederickshall in the very depth of"], [274, "260 AUGUSTAN AGES OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. winter. But while engaged in viewing the works, he was struck by a cannon-ball, and was dead before any of his atten dants came to his assistance (a. d. 1718).'\" The Swedish senate showed little grief for the loss of the warlike king ; on the first news of his death, his favourite, Baron Goertz, was arrested, brought to trial, and put to death on a ridiculous charge of treason. The crown was conferred upon the late king's sister, but she soon resigned it to her husband, the prince of Hesse, both being compelled to swear that they never would attempt * Dr. Johnson's character of Charles XII. is the best comment on life of that adventurous warrior : \u2014 the On what foundation stands the warrior's pride, How just his hopes, let Swedish Charles decide ; A frame of adamant, a soul of fire,- No dangers fright him and no labours tire ; O'er love, o'er fear, extends his wide domain, TJnconquered lord of pleasure and of pain ; No joys to him pacific sceptres yield, War sounds the trump, he rushes to the field ; Behold surrounding kings their power combine, And one capitulate, and one resign ; Peace courts his hand, but spreads her charms in vain : \" Think nothing gained,\" he cries, \" till nought remain : On Moscow's walls, till Gothic standards fly, And all be mine beneath the polar sky.\" The march begins in military state, Aud nations on liis eye suspended wait ; Stern famine guards the solitary coast, And winter barricades the realms of frost ; He comes, nor want, nor cold, his course delay ; \u2014 Hide, blushing glory, hide Pultawa's day: The vanquished hero leaves his broken bands, And shows his miseries in distant lands ; Condemned a needy suppliant to wait, While ladies interpose, and slaves debate.

Ncgociations for peace were commenced with all the hostile powers, and treaties con cluded with all but Russia (a. d. 1720). The appearance of an English fleet in the Baltic, coming to aid the Swedish squadron, however finally disposed the czar to pacific measures ; and he consented to grant peace, on condition of being permitted to retain Ingria, Livonia, and part of Finland (a. d. 1721). Thus the great northern war terminated, just as it was about to be connected with the politics of southern Europe."], [276, "262 CHAPTER VII. GEOWTH OF THE MEECANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. Section I. \u2014 Establishment of the Hanoverian Succession in England. During the wars that had been waged against Louis XIV., the funding system was established in England ; it commenced by the founding of a National Bank (a. d. 1694), which lent its capital to the government at a lower rate of interest than was then usual. Further loans were contracted to support the exigences of the wars ; parliament guaranteed the payment of the interest, without entering into any obligation to restore the capital, which was transferable to any one. The gradual exten sion of the wealth of the nation facilitated the growth of this system, which soon gave England commanding influence on the continent. The facilities of raising money possessed by the English government enabled it to conclude subsidiary treaties, and set the armies of allied states in motion. Internally the funding system wrought a still greater change ; a great portion of the political influence previously possessed by the landed aristocracy was transferred to large capitalists and manufac turers ; the banking and funding systems afforded great facilities for accumulating the profits of industry, and thus fostered the growth of an intelligent and opulent middle class, whose strength was soon displayed in the increasing importance of the House of Commons. Even at the treaty of Utrecht, the mercantile system began to manifest itself in all its strength. Grants of commercial privileges were made the conditions of peace with the maritime powers, and territorial concessions were made with a regard to the interests of trade rather than power. Justly as the British negociators at Utrecht may be blamed for not taking"], [277, "ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HANOVERIAN SUCCESSION. 263 sufficient advantage of the position in which their country was placed by the victories of Marlborough, it is undeniable that the treaty they concluded laid the foundation of the commercial superiority of England ; it also contained the germs of two future wars, but these consequences were slowly developed ; and at the commencement of the eighteenth century, the republic of Holland was still the first commercial state in Europe. The accession of George I. produced a complete change in the English administration, the tories were dismissed with harsh ness ; the whigs were the sole possessors of office, and on the new- election consequent on the demise of the crown, they obtained a decided majority in parliament. Unfortunately they used their power to crush their political adversaries ; the chiefs of the late ministry were impeached for high treason, and their prosecution was hurried forward so vindictively, that Lords Bolingbroke and Ormond fled to the continent. This seemed a favourable moment to make an effort in favour of the exiled Stuarts, but Louis XIV., broken down by age, infirmities, and misfortune, was unwilling to hazard a new war, which might disturb the minority of his great-grandson, for in consequence of the mortality in the royal family, this remote descendant was destined to be his successor. The death of Louis (Sept. 1, 1715) further disconcerted the projects of the pretender and his adhe rents ; the duke of Orleans, who was chosen regent by the parliament of Paris during the minority of Louis XV., adopted every suggestion of the English ambassador, the earl of Stair, for counteracting the designs of the Jacobites ; and he did them irreparable injury by seizing some ships laden with arms and ammunition, at a time when it was impossible for them to purchase any fresh supply. The Jacobites, however, persevered, and a plan was formed for a general insurrection ; but this was defeated by the pretender's imprudence, who prematurely gave the carl of Mar a commission to raise his standard in Scotland. The earl of Mar possessed considerable influence in the High land counties ; no sooner had he proclaimed the pretender, under the title of James VIIL, than the clans crowded to his standard, and he was soon at the head of nine thousand men, including several noblemen and persons of distinction. Thus supported,"], [278, "264 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. he made himself master of Perth, and established his authority in almost all that part of Scotland which lies north of the Frith of Forth. In the mean time the government was alarmed ; the jacobite leaders who had agreed to raise the west of England were taken into custody, and the duke of Argyle was sent against Mar with all the forces of North Britain. An ill-con trived and worse executed insurrection of the Jacobites exploded in the north of England; its leaders, the earl of Derwentwater, Lord Widdrington, and Mr. Foster, a Northumbrian gentleman of great influence, were joined by several Scottish lords and a body of Highland infantry. But being unable to agree upon any rational plan of operations, they were surrounded by the royal forces in the town of Preston, and forced to surrender at discretion. It would have been better for the character of the government had lenity been shown to these unhappy men, but unfortunately most of the leaders were doomed to suffer the penalties of high treason. In the mean time the earl of Mar had fought an indecisive battle with the duke of Argyle, which proved nevertheless ruinous to the pretender's cause. Many who had been previ ously in doubt, declared for the royal cause, and several of the insurgent leaders returned to their allegiance. In this desperate state of his affairs, the pretender landed with a small train in Scotland ; but finding his cause hopeless, he returned to France with such of the leaders as did not expect pardon, and the whole country quietly submitted to the duke of Argyle. Before entering on the singular changes wrought by the policy of the duke of Orleans in Europe, it will be convenient to cast a brief glance at the affairs of Russia and Turkey. No sooner had Peter the Great concluded peace with Sweden than he assumed the title of emperor, with the consent of all the European powers. By sending an auxiliary force to aid the lawful sovereign of Persia against an Afghan usurper, he obtained the cession of the provinces ou the south and west of the Caspian Sea; and, while he thus extended his dominions, he did not neglect their internal improvement, but constructed canals, planned roads, and established manufactories. But Peter's own character retained many traces of barbarism, and his treatment"], [279, "265 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE nANOVERIAN SUCCESSION. of his eldest son Alexis excited general horror. This unfortunate prince is said to have been induced by some of the Russian priests and boyars to promise, that in the event of his accession, he would restore the old state of things, and abolish the new institutions of his father. He was arrested and forced to sign an abdication of the crown ; soon after this, he died in prison, but whether violent means were used to accelerate his end has never been satisfactorily ascertained. The second son of the Russian emperor died in infancy, and Peter chose his empress as his successor. He assisted at her coronation after his return from the Persian war; and on his death (a.d. 1725) she became empress of all the Russias, and by the excellence of her administration justified the choice of her illustrious husband. The Turks were enraged at the diminution of their national glory in the war that was terminated by the treaty of Carlowitz, and eagerly longed for an opportunity of retrieving their lost honour. Ahmed III., the most warlike sultan that had recently filled the throne, was far from being displeased by their martial zeal, and he took the earliest opportunity of declaring war against the Venetians, whom he expelled from the Morea in a single campaign (a. d. 1715). The emperor, Charles VI., was solicited by the pope to check the progress of the Mohammedans ; he therefore interfered, as protector of the treaty of Carlowitz ; but finding his remonstrances disregarded, he assembled a powerful army, and published a declaration of war (a. d. 1716). Prince Eugene, at the head of the imperialists, crossed the Danube, and attacked the forces of the grand vizier, near Peterwaradin. He gained a complete victory, twenty-five thousand of the Turks were either killed or drowned, while the loss of the Austrians did not exceed one-fifth of that number. In the ensuing campaign, the prince laid siege to Belgrade, and having defeated with great slaughter the vast Turkish army that marched to its relief, became master of that important fortress. The consequence of these victories was the peace of Passarowitz (a. d. 1718) by which Austria and Russia gained considerable acquisitions ; but the republic of Venice, for whose sake the war was ostensibly undertaken, did not recover its N"], [280, "266 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. possessions in Greece, and found its interests neglected by its more potent allies. These wars were very remotely connected with the political condition of southern Europe, which now depended entirely on the maintenance of the terms of the peace of Utrecht. Several powers were interested in their preservation ; England's flourish ing commerce depended in many essential particulars on the articles of the treaty; they were the best security to Austria, for the provinces lately ceded in Italy ; and the Dutch, unable or unwilling to garrison the barrier towns, felt that peace was necessary to their security. But above all, the regent of France felt that this treaty was the sole support of his power, since it involved the Spanish king's renunciation of his claims to the French crown. Altogether opposed to these views were the designs of the court of Spain ; the marriage of Philip to Elizabeth Farnese, heiress to the duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Tuscany, inspired him with the hope of recovering the provinces that had been severed from the Spanish monarchy ; his prime minister, Cardinal Alberoni, flattered him with hopes of success, and at the same time dfligently laboured to improve the financial condition of the country. But Alberoni did not confine his attention to Spain : he endeavoured to engage the Turks in a new war with the empire ; he intrigued to remove the duke of Orleans from the regency of France ; and he opened a secret correspondence with the Scottish Jacobites. Austria, France, England, and Holland, united against the dangerous schemes of Alberoni, and formed a treaty called the Quadruple Alliance (a. d. 1716). But the cardinal steadily pursued his course, and war was proclaimed against Spain by France and England. The strength of Spain, exhausted by the war of the succession, could not resist this powerful combination ; the English fleet rode triumphant in the Mediterranean\"; a German army expelled the Spaniards from Sicily ; the French, under the command of the duke of Berwick, invaded Spain, and captured several important fortresses ; the duke of Ormond failed in his attempt to land a Spanish army in Great Britain ; and Philip, completely subdued, dismissed Alberoni (a. d. 1720), and acceded to the terms of the Quadruple Alliance."], [281, "ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HANOVERIAN SUCCESSION. 267 During this war, France and England were involved in great financial difficulties, by the Mississippi scheme in one country, and the South Sea speculation in the other. A Scotch adven turer, named Law, proposed a plan to the regent of France for speedily paying off the vast national debt, and deliverino- the revenue from the enormous interest by which it was over whelmed. He effected this by an extraordinary issue of paper, on the security of the Mississippi company, from whose commercial speculations the most extravagant results were expected. So rapid was his success, that in 1719, the nominal value of the funds was eighty times greater than the real value of all the current coin of the realm. This immense disproportion soon excited alarm ; when the holders of the notes tried to convert them into money, there was no specie to meet their demands, and the result was a general bankruptcy. Some efforts were made by the government to remedy this calamity, but the evil admitted only of slight palliation, and thousands were com pletely ruined. The South Sea scheme, projected by Sir John Blount, in England, was a close imitation of Law's plan. He proposed that the South Sea company, to which great commercial advan tages had been secured by the treaty of Utrecht, should become the sole creditor of the nation ; and facilities were offered to the owners of stock to exchange the security of the crown for that of the South Sea company. Never did so wild a scheme meet such sudden success ; South Sea stock in a short time rose to ten times its original value ; new specidations were started, and for a time had similar popularity ; but when suspicion was excited, and some cautious holders of stock began to sell, a universal panic succeeded to the general delusion. By the prompt interference of parliament a general bankruptcy was averted, and the chief contrivers of the fraud, including many individuals of rank and station, were punished, and their estates sequestrated for the benefit of the sufferers. The confusion occasioned by the South Sea scheme encouraged the Jacobites to make another effort in favour of the Stuarts (a.d. 1722). But their plans were discovered, a gentleman named Layer was capitally punished for enlisting men in the n 2"], [282, "268 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. service of the Pretender, and Dr. Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, the soul of his party, was exiled. Fortunately for the repose of Europe, the prime ministers of France and England, Cardinal Fleury, who succeeded to power soon after the death of the duke of Orleans, and Sir Robert Walpole, were both bent on the preservation of peace, and for nearly twenty years they prevented any active hostilities. Walpole's administration, however, began to lose its popularity, on account of his not gratifying the national hatred against Spain. A powerful opposition was formed against him, com posed of the old tories, and some disappointed courtiers, which he contended against by unbounded parliamentary corruption. The death of George I. (a. d. 1727) made no change in the position of parties, for George II. entrusted Waljwle with the same power he had enjoyed under his father. The emperor Charles, having no prospect of male issue, was naturally anxious to secure the peaceful succession of his daughter, Maria Theresa, to his hereditary dominions ; and for this purpose he prepared a solemn law, called the Pragmatic Sanction, and procured its confirmation by the principal states of Europe. The guarantee of France was not obtained without war. Stanislaus Leczinski, father-in-law to the French monarch, was elected king of Poland, but was dethroned by the influence of the German powers (a. d. 1733). To avenge this insult, the French king formed a league with the courts of Spain and Sardinia against the emperor ; and, after a brief struggle, the court of Vienna was forced to purchase peace by considerable . sacrifices. The success of the Russians, under the reign of the \u00bbcmpress Anne, niece to Peter the Great, against the Turks, induced the German emperor to commence a second unfortunate war. Scarcely was it concluded, when the death of Charles (a.d. 1740) involved Europe in the contentions of a new disputed succession. Sir Robert Walpole had long preserved England at peace ; but the interested clamours of some merchants eno-aoed in a contraband trade with the Spanish colonies, compelled him to commence hostilities (a. d. 1739). Admiral Vernon, with a small force, captured the important city of Porto Bello, on the"], [283, "269 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HANOVERIAN SUCCESSION. American isthmus. This success induced the minister to send out large armaments against the Spanish colonies. Vernon with a fleet, and Lord Cathcart with a numerous army, under took to assail Spanish America on the side of the Atlantic, while Commodore Anson sailed round Cape Horn to ravage the coasts of Chili and Peru. The death of Lord Cathcart frustrated these arrangements ; he was succeeded by General Wentworth, an officer of little experience, and very jealous of Vemon's popularity. An attack was made on Carthagcna, but it failed lamentably, owing to the disputes between the naval and military commanders. Both were reinforced from England, but they effected nothing of any importance, and returned home after more than fifteen thousand of their men had fallen victims to the climate. Anson, in the mean time, encountered such a severe storm in rounding Cape Horn, that two of his ships were forced to return, and one was lost. His diminished squadron, however, took several prizes off the coast of Chili, and plundered the town of Paita, in Peru. His force was finally reduced to one ship, but with this he captured the Spanish galleon, laden with treasure, that sailed annually from Acapulco to Manilla. He then returned to England triumphant ; but the loss at Carthagena was so severely felt, that the English would not venture to renew their enterprises against Spanish America. Scarcely had Maria Theresa succeeded her father, the emperor Charles, when she found herself surrounded by a host of enemies. The elector of Bavaria laid claim to Bohemia; the king of Sardinia revived some obsolete pretensions to the duchy of Milan, while the kings of Poland, Spain, and France, exhibited claims to the whole Austrian succession. An unexpected claimant gave the first signal for war. Frederic III., who had just ascended the Prussian throne, inherited from his father a rich treasury, and a well-appointed army. Relying on the goodness of his troops rather than the goodness of his cause, he entered Silesia, and soon conquered that fine province (a. d. 1741). At the same time he offered to support Maria Theresa against all competitors, on the condition of being permitted to retain his acquisition. The princess steadily refused, though she knew that France was arming against her, aud that her enemies"], [284, "270 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. had resolved to elevate Charles Albert, elector of Bavaria, to the empire. The forces of the king of France entered Germany, and being joined by the Bavarian army, made several important conquests, and even threatened Vienna; but Maria Theresa, repairing to Presburg, convened the states of Hungary, and appearing before them with her infant son in her arms, made such an eloquent appeal, that the nobles with one accord exclaimed, \" We will die for our King, Maria Theresa.\" Nor was this a momentary burst of passion ; they raised a powerful army for the defence of their young and beautiful princess, and a subsidy was at the same time voted to her by the British parlia ment. So great was the attachment of the English people to her cause, that the pacific Sir Robert Walpolc was forced to resign, and a new administration was formed by his political rivals. The new ministers had been raised to power by a sudden burst of popular enthusiasm, but they soon showed themselves unworthy of the nation's confidence. They took the lead in suppressing the measures which they had themselves declared necessary to the security of the constitution, and they far out- stripped their predecessors in supporting German subsidies, standing armies, and continental connexions, which had been so long the theme of their severest censure. They augmented the army, sent a large body of troops into the Netherlands, under the command of the earl of Stair ; and granted subsidies to the Danes, the Hessians, and the Austrians. The French had some hopes of gaining the support of the Russians, who were now ruled by the empress Elizabeth. On the death of the empress Anne, her niece, the princess of Mecklenburgh, assumed the government, as guardian of her son John. But the partiality that the regent showed for her German countrymen displeased the Russian nobles ; their discontents were artfully increased by a French physician, named Lestocq, a bloodless insurrection led to the deposition of the Mecklenburgh princess, and Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great, was raised to the throne. She found the country involved in a war with Sweden, which she brought to a successful issue, and secured the inheritance to the Swedish crown for her favourite, Adolphus,"], [285, "ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HANOVERIAN SUCCESSION. 271 bishop of Lubeck. Though the czarina owed her elevation in a great degree to French intrigue, she was inclined to support the Austrian cause ; but she did not interfere in the contest until she had completed all her arrangements. The republic of Holland showed still more reluctance to engage in the war ; and the English army in the Netherlands, deprived of the expected Dutch aid, remained inactive. In Germany, the Bavarian elector was driven not only from his conquests, but from his hereditary dominions*, while the king of Prussia took advantage of a brilliant victory to conclude a treat}- with Maria Theresa, by which he was secured in the possession of Silesia. The French army, thus deprived of its most powerful ally, must have been ruined but for the abilities of its general, the count de Belleisle, who effected one of the most masterly retreats recorded in history, from the centre of Bohemia to the frontiers of Alsace. The Spaniards failed in their attacks on the imperial territories in Italy, chiefly owing to the activity of the English fleets in the Mediterranean ; and the court of Versailles, disheartened by these repeated failures, made proposals of peace. Maria Theresa, intoxicated with success, rejected all the proffered conditions (a. d. 1743). She uro-ed forward her armaments with such vigour, that the French were driven to the Rhine, and the unfortunate elector of Bavaria, abandoned by his allies, and stripped of his dominions, * Dr. Johnson has powerfully described the fate of this unfortunate prince : \u2014 The bold Bavarian, in a luckless hour, Tries the dread summits of C\u00e6sarean power, With unexpected legions bursts away, And sees defenceless realms receive his sway ; Short sway ! fair Austria spreads her mournful charms, The queen, the beauty, sets the world in arms ; From hill to hill the beacon's rousing blaze Spreads wide the hope of plunder and of praise ; The fierce Croatian and the wild hussar, With all the sons of ravage, crowd the war ; The baffled prince, in honour's flatt'ring bloom, Of hasty greatness finds the fatal doom ; His foes' derision, and his subjects' blame, And steals to death from anguish and from shame."], [286, "272 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. sought refuge in Frankfort, where he lived in indigence and obscurity. The errors of the French in Flanders led to their defeat at Dcttingen, just when a little caution would have ensured the ruin of the English and Austrians. But the allies made no use of their victory, owing to the irresolution of George II., who took the management of the campaign into his own hands, and superseded the earl of Stair. The war lingered in Italy, but the haughtiness and ambition of the empress began to excite the secret jealousy of the German princes ; and the French and Spanish courts, alarmed by her treaty with the king of Sardinia, drew their alliance closer by the celebrated Family Compact, which bound them to maintain the integrity of each other's dominions. England had now become a principal in the war, and the monarchs of France and Spain resolved to invade that country, and remove the Hanoverian dynasty. A powerful army was assembled, and a fleet prepared to protect the transports, but the French ships were shattered in a storm, and forced to take refuge in Brest from a superior English force (a.d. 1744). The English navy was less successful in the Mediterranean ; the combined fleets of France and Spain were met by the British admirals, Matthews and Lestock ; but owing to the misconduct of some captains, and Lestock's remaining aloof with his whole division, the result of the engagement was indecisive. It is a sad proof of the violence and injustice of faction, that when these officers were brought to trial, Matthews, who had fought like a hero, was condemned, and Lestock acquitted. The war in Italy was sanguinary, but indecisive. In Germany, however, the king of Prussia once more took up arms against Maria Theresa, and invaded Bohemia. He was defeated with great loss, and forced to retire precipitately into Silesia. Soon after wards the death of the elector of Bavaria removed all reasonable grounds for the continuance of hostilities ; his son, who had no pretensions to the empire, concluded a treaty with Maria Theresa, and promised to support the election of her husband, the grand duke of Tuscany, to the imperial dignity. But the national animosity between the French and English prevented the restoration of peace (a.d. 1745). The Austrians"], [287, "273 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HANOVERIAN SUCCESSION. were completely vanquished in Italy by the united forces of the French and Spaniards, whose vast superiority of numbers could not be resisted ; and on the side of the Netherlands, the miscon duct of the allies gave a signal triumph to the Bourbons. The French army under Marshal Saxe was strongly posted at Fon tenoy, but was, notwithstanding, attacked by the English, Dutch, and Germans. In few battles has the valour of the British infantry been displayed more signally or more uselessly. Forming themselves into a column, they bore down every thing before them, until, deserted by their Dutch and German auxili aries, they were outflanked and driven back by the entire force of the French army. The loss on both sides was nearly equal ; but though the victory was not decisive, it enabled Marshal Saxe to reduce some of the most considerable towns in the Nether land. Tranquillity was restored to Germany by the election of the grand duke of Tuscany to the empire, under the name of Francis I. ; and about the same time Maria Theresa, as queen of Hungary, concluded the treaty of Breslau with the king of Prussia, and thus quieted her most dangerous enemy. The discontent occasioned by the loss at Fontenoy induced the grandson of James II., commonly called the Young Pre tender, to attempt the restoration of his family. He landed in Scotland with a small train, but being soon joined by the enthusiastic Llighland clans, he descended from the mountains and marched towards Edinburgh. The city surrendered with out any attempt at resistance, but the castle still held out. Sir John Cope, the royal commander in Scotland, had marched northwards to raise the loyal clans ; having collected some rein forcements, he proceeded from Aberdeen to Dunbar by sea, and hcarino- that the insurgents were resolved to hazard a battle, he encamped at Preston Pans. Here he was unexpectedly attacked by the young Pretender, at the head of about three thousand undisciplined and half-armed soldiers. A panic seized the royal troops ; they fled with the most disgraceful precipitation, abandoning all their baggage, cannon, and camp equipage, to their enemies. The reduction of the French colony of Cape Breton, in North America, had revived the spirit of the English ; and the time N 3"], [288, "274 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. that the Pretender wasted in idle pageantry at Edinburgh, afforded the ministers an opportunity of bringing over some regiments from Flanders. Notwithstanding the formidable pre parations thus made, the Pretender, probably relying on pro mised aid from France, crossed the western borders, and took Carlisle. But the vigilance of Admiral Vernon prevented the French fleet from venturing out; and the Pretender having failed to raise recruits in Lancashire, and unable to force a pas sage into Wales, baffled the royal armies by an unexpected turn, and suddenly marched to Derby. Had he continued to advance boldly, London itself might have fallen, but he delayed at Derby until he was nearly enclosed between two powerful armies, and was forced either to retreat or to hazard a battle on very disadvantageous terms. It was finally determined that they should return to Scotland, and this retrograde movement was effected by the Highlanders with extraordinary courage and expedition. This retreat did not produce the dispiriting effect on the insur gents that had been anticipated. The Pretender's forces were greatly augmented after his return to Scotland ; but finding that Edinburgh had been secured by the royal army during his absence, he marched to Stirling, captured the town and besieged the castle. General Hawley was sent with a strong force to raise the siege, but despising the undisciplined Highlanders, he acted so imprudently that he suffered a complete defeat near Falkirk (a.d. 1746). -The Pretender, instead of following up his advantage, returned to the siege of Stirling Castle, while the royal army, reinforced by fresh troops, was placed under the command of the duke of Cumberland, a prince of the blood, who, though by no means a skilful general, was a great favourite with the soldiery. The insurgent army retired before the royal troops until they reached Culloden Moor, where they resolved to make a stand. Warned by the errors of Cope and Hawley, the duke of Cumberland took the most prudent precautions to meet the desperate charge of the Highlanders ; they rushed on with their usual impetuosity, but being received by a close and galling fire of musketry, while their ranks were torn by artillery, they wavered, broke, and in less than thirty minutes were a helpless"], [289, "275 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HANOVERIAN SUCCESSION. mass of confusion. The victors gave no quarter; many of the insurgents were murdered in cold blood, and their unfortunate prince was only saved from capture by the generous devotion of one of his adherents, wiio assured the pursuers that he was himself the object of their search. The cruelties of the royalists after their victory were perfectly disgraceful ; the country of the insurgent clans was laid waste with fire and sword ; the men were hunted like wild beasts on the mountains, the women and children, driven from their burned huts, perished by thousands on the barren heaths. When all traces of rebellion, and almost of population, had disappeared, the duke of Cumberland returned to London, leaving a large body of troops to continue the pursuit of the surviving fugitives. During five months the young Pretender remained concealed in the Highlands and Western isles of Scotland, though a reward of thirty thousand pounds was set on his head, and more than fifty persons were entrusted with his secret. At length he escaped on board a French privateer, and after enduring incre dible hardships arrived safely in Britanny. The vengeance of the government fell heavily on his adherents ; numbers of the leaders were tried and executed, and though they died with heroic firmness, their fate excited little commiseration. In the mean time the French, under Marshal Saxe, had overrun the greater part of the Netherlands; Brussels, Antwerp, and Namur, were captured, while the confederate army was defeated in a sanguinary but indecisive engagement at Raucoux. In Italy, the allies were more successful ; taking advantage of the mutual jealousies between the French and Spaniards, the Aus trians, reinforced by the king of Sardinia, drove their enemies from Italy, and pursued them into France. The death of their monarch had abated the vigour of the Spaniards, for the designs of Ferdinand VI., Philip's son and successor, were for some time unknown ; but when he declared his resolution to adhere to the Family Compact, the hopes of the partisans of the house of Bourbon were revived. About the same time the imperialists were compelled to evacuate the South of France by the judicious measures of the marshal de Belleisle, and the Genoese, irritated by the severity with which they were treated, expelled the"], [290, "276 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. Austrian garrison, and baffled every attempt that their oppres sors made to recover the city. The national animosity between the French and English was aggravated by commercial jealousy; they mutually fitted out armaments against each other's colo nies ; but these expeditions, badly contrived and worse executed, led to no decisive results, and all parties began to grow weary of a war which produced no consequence but a lavish waste of blood and treasure. Conferences were commenced at Breda, but the demands of the French appeared so exorbitant to the allies, that the negociations were abruptly terminated, and the hostile powers made the most vigorous preparations for a deci sive struggle (a.d. 1747). The exertions of the allies were long paralyzed by the indecision of the Dutch rulers; even when their own country was invaded, they could not be induced to adopt more vigorous councils, until a popular revolt compelled them to revive the office of Stadtholder, and confer that dignity on the prince of Orange. Though this revolution gave more vigour to the operations of the allies, the whole weight of the war was ungenerously thrown upon the English ; the obstinate and bloody battle of Val would have been won by British valour, but for the timidity- and slow ness of the Dutch and Austrians ; in consequence of their mis conduct it terminated to the disadvantage of the confederates. Soon after the fortress of Bergen-op-Zoom, generally believed to be impregnable, was captured by the French, who thus became masters of the whole navigation of the Scheldt. In Italy the allies, though forced to raise the siege of Genoa, were generally successful, while the British navy gained several important triumphs at sea. A valuable French convoy was attacked by the admirals Anson and Warren, off Cape Finisterre, and after an obstinate engagement, six ships of the line and several armed Indiainen were taken. Seven weeks after, a fleet laden with the rich produce of St. Domingo, fell into the hands of Commo dore Fox ; and at a later period of the year, Admiral Hawke, after a sharp battle, took six ships of the line in the latitude of Belleisle. These reverses, and the sailing of a powerful British armament to the East Indies, so alarmed the court of Versailles, that negociations for peace were once more commenced."], [291, "277 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HANOVERIAN SUCCESSION. While conferences were opened at Aix-la-Chapelle (a. d. 1748), Marshal Saxe continued to carry on the war with great vigour ; he laid siege to Maastricht, which was obstinately de fended, but before the contest could be decided, intelligence was received that the preliminaries of peace had been signed. The basis of the treaty was a restitution of all conquests made during the war, and a mutual release of prisoners without ransom. It left unsettled the clashing claims of the Spaniards and British to the trade of the American seas, and made no mention of the right of search, which had been the original cause of the war ; the only advantage, indeed, that England gained, was the recog nition of the Hanoverian succession, and the general abandonment of the Pretender, whose cause was from henceforth regarded as hopeless. This result, from so expensive a contest, gave general dissatisfaction ; but the blame should fall on the authors of the war, not of the peace ; England had no interest in the contests for the Austrian succession ; under the peaceful administration of Sir Robert Walpole her commerce and manufactures had rapidly increased, but through an idle ambition for military glory, and a perverse love of meddling in continental affairs, the pro sperity of the country received a severe check, and an enormous addition was made to the national debt. Section II. \u2014 The Colonial Struggle between France and Great Britain. The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was soon discovered to be little better than a suspension of arms. Two causes of a very dif ferent nature united to produce anew and fiercer struggle, which no arts of diplomacy could long avert. The first of these was the jealousy with which the court of Austria regarded the great increase of the Prussian monarchy; the extorted renunciation of Silesia could neither be forgiven nor forgotten, and its recovery had long been the favourite object of the court of Vienna. The Prussian monarch was not popular with his neighbours, all new powers are naturally objects of jealousy, and the selfish policy"], [292, "278 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. which Frederic displayed, both in contracting and dissolving alliances, prevented him from gaining any permanent friend; he was the personal enemy of Elizabeth, empress of Russia, and of Count Bruhl, the leading minister in the court of Saxony, and both readily joined in the plans formed for his destruction. But with these confederates, the Austrian cabinet was reluct ant to engage in hostilities, while France might at any time turn the balance, by renewing its former relations with Prussia. Prince Kaunitz, the real guide of the court of Vienna, and, during four reigns, the soul of the Austrian councils, resolved to unite the empire and France in one common project, for sharing the rule of Europe. Louis XV., who had sunk into being the slave of his mistresses, was induced, by this able diplomatist, to depart from the course of policy which for two centuries had maintained the high rank of France among the continental powers; from being the rivals and opponents of the Austrian dynasty, the house of Bourbon sunk into the humble character of assistants to that power, a change which eventually brought the greatest calamities on themselves and their country. The commercial jealousy- with which the English regarded the French, was the second cause for the renewal of the war. During the late war, the French navy had been all but annihi lated, and the exertions made for its restoration were viewed with secret anger. Owing to incapacity, or defective informa tion, the negociators at Aix-la-Chapelle had left most of the colonial questions at issue between England and France, wholly undecided. The chief subjects contested were, the limits of the English colony of Nova Scotia, \u2014 the right claimed by the French to erect forts along the Ohio, for the purpose of connect ing the Canadas with Louisiana, \u2014 the occupation of some neutral islands in the West Indies, by the French ; and, finally, the efforts of both nations to acquire political supremacy in Hindustan. The maritime war between England and France had no immediate connexion with the struggle between Prussia and Austria. But when the French king, at the commencement of the contest, menaced Hanover, George II., who preferred the interests of this petty principality to those of the British empire, entered"], [293, "COLONIAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND. 279 into a treaty with Frederic for its defence. Thus these two wars, so distinct in their origin and nature, were blended into one ; but before their termination, they were again separated and concluded by distinct treaties of peace. The empire which the descendants of Baber had established in Hindustan, touched the summit of its greatness in the reign of Aurungzebc ; under his feeble successors, the imperial power rapidly declined, and after the successful eruption of Nadir Shah (a. d. 1738), it was almost annihilated. The governors of provinces and districts became virtually independent sovereigns, and the allegiance they paid to the court of Delhi was merely nominal. Both the French and English East India Companies took advantage of this state of things, to extend their influence and enlarge their territories. Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, had long sought au opportunity of interfering in the troubled politics of India ; it was afforded him by the contests which arose on the vacancies in the souh badary of the Deccan, and the nabobship of the Carnatic. He supported the claims of Chundah Saheb to the latter post, and endeavoured to make Murzafa Jing, souhbadar or viceroy of the Deccan. He succeeded in these objects, but his favourites did not long retain their elevation ; still, however, a precedent was established for the interference of the French in the contests between the native powers, and their aid was purchased by fresh concessions in every revolution. The rapid progress of their rivals roused the English from their supineness, and, fortunately, they found a leader, whose abilities, both as a general and statesman, have scarcely been surpassed by any European that ever visited the East. Mr. Clive, the son of a private gentleman, had been originally employed in the civil service of the East India Company ; but war no sooner broke out than he exchanged the pen for the sword, and the union of courage and skill which he displayed at the very commence ment of his career, excited just expectations of the glory which marked its progress. He gained several brilliant advantages over the allies of the French, and greatly strengthened the English interest in the Deccan, or southern division of Hin dustan. But the French East India Company had begun to"], [294, "280 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. distrust the flattering promises of Dupleix ; they found that his plans of territorial aggrandizement involved them in expensive wars, and were, at the same time, destructive of their commerce. A similar feeling, though to a less extent, prevailed in England, and the rival Companies prepared to adjust their differences by the sacrifice of Dupleix. No regard was paid by his country men to his defence ; he was loaded with obloquy, as a selfish and ambitious man, though it was notorious that he had sacrificed his entire private fortune to support what he believed to be the true interests of France. The successor of Dupleix concluded a treaty with the English authorities, in which all the objects of that able governor were abandoned. Mohammed Ali, the friend of the English, was recognised as the nabob of the Carnatie ; the claims of the French upon the Northern Circars were relinquished, and it was agreed that the colonists from each nation should, for the future, abstain from all interference with the affairs of the native princes. It was scarcely possible that these stipulations could be strictly observed ; indeed, the treaty had scarcely been signed, when mutual complaints were made of infractions ; but, in the mean time, events had occurred in another part of the globe, which frustrated it altogether. After the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, the British ministry, anxious to secure the province of Nova Scotia, as a barrier for the other American colonies, induced many disbanded soldiers and sailors to settle in that country. The town of Halifax was built and its harbour fortified, and Nova Scotia began to rise rapidly in importance. The French, who had hitherto viewed the province as little better than a barren waste, began now to raise disputes concerning its limits ; and the settlers, from both countries, did not always arrange their controversies by peaceful discussion. Still more important were the differences which arose in the interior of North America. The French were naturally anxious to form a communication between the Canadas in the north and Louisiana in the south. This could only be effected by depriving the English of their settlements west of the Alleghany- mountains, and seizing the posts which the British settlers in Virginia and the Carolinas had established"], [295, "COLONIAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND. 281 beyond that chain, for the convenience of trade with the Indians. Hostilities were commenced, by the colonial authorities, without the formality of a declaration of war ; the Virginian post of Logs' Town was surprised by a French detachment, and all its inhabitants but two inhumanly murdered ; the North American Indians were stimulated to attack the British colonists, and large supplies of arms and ammunition were imported from France (a.d. 1755). The British ministers immediately pre pared for hostilities ; all the French forts within the limits of Nova Scotia, were reduced by Colonel Monckton ; but an expedition against the French forts on the Ohio was defeated, owing to the rashness of General Braddock, who refused to profit by the local knowledge of the provincial officers. He sell into an ambuscade of French and Indians, and instead of endeavouring to extricate himself, attempted to make a stand. At length he was slain, while vainly striving to rally his troops, and the regular soldiers fled with disgraceful precipitation. It deserves to be remarked, that the provincial militia, commanded by Major Washington, did not share the panic of the royal army, but displayed great coolness, courage, and conduct. Two other expeditions, against the forts of Niagara and Crown Point, failed, though General Johnson, who commanded the latter, gained a victory over the hostile army. But, at sea, the British strength was more effectually displayed ; two sail of the line were captured by Admiral Boscawcn, off Newfound- land ; and more than three hundred merchant ships were brought as prizes into the ports of Great Britain. Notwith standing these hostilities, a formal declaration of war was delayed ; its publication was the signal for one of the fiercest struggles in which modern Europe had yet been involved. Before, however, we enter on this part of our history, we must briefly notice the important events that for a time threatened the total ruin of the English in Bengal, but whose final results made their power paramount in Northern India. The privileges which the emperor of Delhi had granted to the English settlers in Calcutta, excited great jealousy among the provincial governors, and were violently opposed by Jaffier Khan, the soubahdar of Bengal. Means were taken, however, i"], [296, "282 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. to conciliate this powerful feudatory, and peace was preserved until the accession of the ferocious Suraja Dowla, who was enraged at the shelter which the English accorded to some of his destined victims (a. d. 1756). He advanced against Calcutta, when most of the local authorities were seized with a scandalous panic ; the governor and the military commanders escaped in boats, leaving Mr. Holwell, Mr. Pearks, and about one hundred and ninety more, to provide for their own safety as they best might. After endeavouring vainly to bring back even one vessel, to aid their removal, this handful of men, after a vigorous defence, fell into the power of the ferocious Suraja. They were all thrust into a room twenty feet square, where, from the heat and foulness of the atmosphere, all but twenty-three died before the morning. The news of this catastrophe reached Madras just when Colonel Clive and Admiral Watson, flushed by their recent victory over the celebrated pirate Angria, had arrived at Madras, to aid in the destruction of the French influence in the Deccan. The troops assembled for that purpose were now sent to recover Calcutta, and this object was effected by the mere appearance of the fleet before the city. Several of the Suraja's own places were taken and plundered, and the French fort of Chandernagore reduced; conspiracies were formed against Suraja Dowla, and that haughty chieftain felt that the sove reignty of Bengal must be decided by a battle. Contrary to the opinion of all his officers, Clive resolved to hazard an engage ment, and took up a position in the grove of Plassy (June 23d, 1757). The British force consisted of three thousand two hundred, not more than nine hundred of whom were Europeans ; their artillery consisted only of eight six-pounders and two howitzers. On the other hand, Suraja Dowla had with him fifty thousand foot, eighteen thousand horse, and fifty pieces of cannon. Though the engagement continued the greater part of the day, the British did not lose more than seventy in killed and wounded ; they owed the victory, indeed, more to the errors of their adversaries than to their own merits ; for the contest seems to have been little better than an irregular cannonade, occasionally relieved by ineffectual charges of"], [297, "COLONIAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND. 283 cavalry. Its consequences were not the less decisive from the ease with which it was won; Suraja Dowla, after wandering for some time as a fugitive, was murdered by one of his personal enemies ; and the viceroyalty of Bengal was given to Jaffier Khan, who purchased the favour of the British by large public grants, and larger private bribes. This brief campaign estab lished the supremacy of the English in Northern India, where their power has never since been shaken. Section III. \u2014 The Seven Years' War. When the French government received intelligence of the events that had taken place in India and America, vigorous preparations for war were made throughout the kingdom, and England itself was menaced with invasion (a. d. 1756). Never was the national character of the British nation so tarnished as it was by the panic which these futile threats diffused ; Hessians and Hanoverians were hired to protect the kingdom, while the presence of these mercenaries was justly regarded as dangerous to public liberty. It is more honourable to Britain to relate that, when Lisbon, on the very eve of this war, was almost destroyed by an earthquake, parliament voted one hundred thousand pounds for the relief of the sufferers. But the French government menaced an invasion, only to conceal its project for the reduction of Minorca ; a formidable force was landed on the island, and close siege laid to Fort St. Philip, which commands the principal town and harbour. Admiral Byng, who had been entrusted with the charge of the English fleet in the Mediterranean, was ordered to attempt the relief of the place ; he encountered a French squadron, of equal force, but instead of seeking an engagement, he would not even support Admiral West, who had thrown the French line into confusion. After this indecisive skirmish, he returned to Gibraltar, aban doning Minorca to its fate. General Blakeney, the governor of Fort St. Philip, made a vigorous defence, though his garrison was too small by one third ; but finding that he had no prospect"], [298, "284 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. of relief from England, he capitulated. But his conduct was so far from being disapproved of, that he was raised to the peerage by his sovereign, and welcomed as a hero by the people. The rage of the people at the loss of Minorca was directed against the unfortunate Byng ; popular discontent was still further aggravated by the ill-success of the campaign in America, where a second series of expeditions against the French forts signally- failed ; while the marquis de Montcalm, the governor of Canada, captured Oswego, where the British had deposited the greater part of their artillery and military stores. Our ally, the king of Prussia, displayed more vigour ; unable to obtain any satisfactory explanation from the court of Vienna, he resolved to anticipate the designs of the Austrians, and invade Bohemia. For this purpose it was necessary that he should secure the neutrality of Saxony, but the elector was secretly in league with Frederic's enemies ; and the Prussian monarch finding pacific measures ineffectual, advanced against Dresden. The elector, Augustus, who was also king of Poland, fortified himself in a strong camp at Pirna, where he resolved to wait for the junction of the Austrian forces. Frederic blockaded the Saxon army, and cut off its supplies ; the imperialists, who marched to the relief of their allies, were defeated at Lowositz, and the Saxons, thus left to their own resources, were forced to lay down their arms. Augustus fled to his kingdom of Poland, abandoning his hereditary dominions to the Prussians, who did not use their success with extraordinary moderation. But the victories of their ally only exasperated the rage of the English people against their rulers : the king was forced to yield to the storm, and dismiss his ministers. William Pitt (afterwards earl of Chatham), the most popular man in the kingdom, was appointed head of the new administration, though the duke of Devonshire was nominally premier ; a spirit of confidence was spread abroad, and abundant supplies voted for the war. Unfortunately, as a concession to popular clamour, the unhappy Byng, whose worst fault appears to have been an error of judgment, and the dread of the fate of Admiral Matthews*, was brought to trial, found guilty of a breach of * See pago 272."], [299, "THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR. 285 the articles of war, and sentenced to death. Great exertions were made to save the life of the unhappy admiral, but all in vain ; he was ordered to be shot on board the Monarque, and he met his fate with an intrepidity which effectually clears his memory from the stain of cowardice (a. d. 1757)- In France, the attention of the court was engaged by an attempt on the king's life. A maniac, named Damien, stabbed Louis with a pen-knife as he was entering his carriage ; the wound was not dangerous, but it was supposed that the assassin might have accomplices in his treason. Every refinement of cruelty that scientific ingenuity could devise was exhausted in the tortures of this unhappy wretch, whose manifest lunacy made him an object of compassion rather than punishment. The danger to which Louis had been exposed did not prevent him from making vigorous exertions to continue the war. Two armies were sent into Germany, one destined to invade Hanover, the other to join the imperial forces against Prussia. George II., anxious to save Hanover, wished to send over a body of British troops for the defence of the electorate, but being opposed by the Pitt administration, he dismissed his ministers, and tried to form a new cabinet. The burst of national indignation, at the removal of the popular favourite, was however so great, that Pitt was soon recalled to power, but not until he had evinced a desire to make some concession to the royal inclinations. At the commencement of the campaign, the prospects of the king of Prussia were very gloomy; the Russians were advanc ing throuo-h Lithuania, the Swedes threatened him in Pomerania, no ' the united forces of the French and imperialists were advancing through Germany, and the empress-queen, Maria Theresa, covered her hereditary dominions with four armies, whose united strength amounted to one hundred and eighty thousand men. Frederic, baffling the Austrians by a series of masterly movements, opened a passage into Bohemia, where he was joined by the prince of Bevern and Marshal Schwerin, who had defeated the Austrian divisions that opposed their progress. Confident in the excellence of his troops, he resolved to engage without delay, though his enemies were posted in a camp strongly fortified by nature (May 6). The memorable battle of"], [300, "286 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. Prague was vigorously contested, and success continued doubtful until the Austrian right wing, advancing too rapidly, was separated from the left. Frederic poured his troops through the gap, so that when the Austrian right was forced back by the intrepidity of Marshal Schwerin, it suddenly found itself surrounded, and fled in confusion. The centre and left, thus abandoned, could not resist the successive charges of the Prussians, and sought shelter in Prague. Frederic ventured to besiege this city, though the numbers of the garrison nearly equalled those of his own army ; and his delay before the walls gave the Austrians time to recover their courage and recruit their forces. Count Daun began soon to menace the Prussian communications ; Frederic sent the prince of Bevern to drive him back ; Daun, though his forces were superior, retreated before the prince, until he could procure such additional strength as to render victory certain. When this was effected, he resumed the offensive, and Frederic was forced to hasten to the prince's assistance. A junction was effected at Kolin, and Frederic marched to attack the imperial camp (June 18). The Prussians charged their enemies with their usual vigour, but they were unable to force the Austrian lines, and were finally driven from the field. In consequence of this defeat, the Prussians were forced, not only to raise the siege of Prague, but to evacuate Bohemia. Nor were the arms of Frederic and his allies more successful in other quarters. The Russians, having defeated General Lehwald, invaded the Prussian dominions on the side of Ger many, and committed the most frightful devastations; the British and Hanoverian troops, under the duke of Cumberland, were forced to accept the disgraceful convention of Closterseven, by which thirty-eight thousand soldiers were reduced to a state of inactivity ; and the French, thus released from an enemy that might interrupt their communications, advanced to join the Austrians in the invasion of Prussia ; finally, an Austrian army, by a rapid march, arrived at the very gates of Berlin, and laid that city under contribution. An expedition, planned by Mr. Pitt soon after his restoration to power, was defeated by the weakness and indecision of the"], [301, "THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR. 287 officers entrusted with its execution. The object of attack was the French port and arsenal of Rochefort, which would have fallen an easy prey, had it been assailed when first the fleet arrived before the place. But the time which ought to have been employed in action was wasted in deliberations, and the expedition returned ingloriously home. The conduct of British affairs in America was equally disastrous ; an armament was sent against Louisbourg, but it returned without having made any effort to effect its object ; while the French, under the marquis de Montcalm, captured the strong fort William Henry, the bulwark of our northern frontier, without meeting the slightest interruption from a British force posted in its immediate neighbourhood. These disasters would have proved fatal to the new ministry, had it not been generally understood that the officers whose cowardice or incapacity had led to such inglorious results, were the choice of their predecessors, and were maintained in their posts by court favour. This conviction proved favourable to Mr. Pitt, the king was compelled to grant full powers to his ministers, and the secret intrigues by which the cabinet \\tfas controlled, were rendered powerless for a season. An unex pected change of fortune on the Continent brightened the prospects of the British and Prussians towards the close of the year. Frederic, though his dominions were invaded by three hostile armies, never lost courage ; though his army did not exceed half the number of his enemies, he resolved to give battle to the united forces of the French and Austrians (Nov. 5). Frederic, by a series of judicious movements, led his enemies to believe that he dreaded an engagement; confident of victory, they hasted to force him to action, near the village of Rosbach. They advanced so precipitately, that their lines were thrown into disorder ; and before they could remedy the error, they were broken by the headlong charge of the Prussian horse. Every effort made by the generals of the combined army to retrieve the fortunes of the day was anticipated by the genius of Frederic ; they were forced to retreat in great confusion, having lost nearly nine thousand men in killed, wounded, and prisoners, while the total loss of the Prussians did not exceed five hundred."], [302, "288 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. From this field Frederic hasted to another scarcely less glorious. The Austrians and Hungarians, under Prince Charles of Lorrain, entered Silesia, captured the important fortress of Schweidnitz, drove the prince of Bevern from his intrenchments, and made themselves masters of the greater part of the province. Frederic, by a rapid march, formed a junction with the relics of the prince of Bevem's army, and thus reinforced, attacked the Austrians at Lissa (Dec. 5). Pretending to direct all his force against the Austrian right, Frederic suddenly poured his chief strength against their left wing, which was speedily broken ; Prince Charles attempted to restore the courage of his flying soldiers by sending reinforcements from the centre and right, but these fresh troops were unable to form under the heavy fire of the Prussians, and thus the Austrian battalions were defeated one after another. Night alone prevented the total ruin of the vanquished army. About five thousand men were killed and wounded on each side ; but within a week after the battle, the Prussians pressing vigorously the pursuit of their retiring foes, captured twenty thousand prisoners, three thousand wagons, and two hundred pieces of cannon. The Austrians abandoned all Silesia except the town of Schweidnitz, which surrendered in the following spring. The effects of the victories of Rosbach and Lissa were felt throughout Europe ; the French had flagrantly violated the convention of Closterseven ; it was now disavowed by the British and Hanoverians (a. d. 1758). Prince Ferdinand of Brynswick was chosen by George II. to command his electoral forces, and this able general in a short time not only recovered Hanover, but drove his adversaries across the Rhine. Mr. Pitt changed his policy, and consented to reinforce Prince Ferdinand with a body of British troops, while liberal supplies were voted to subsidize the German princes. The campaign was honourable to Prince Ferdinand's abilities, but its most important result was the diversion it made in favour of the king of Prussia, by compelling the French to employ their chief force on the Rhine. Frederic in this campaign endured several vicissitudes of fortune. Having taken Schweidnitz, he unexpectedly entered Moravia, which had hitherto escaped from the ravages of war,"], [303, "THE SEVEN YEARS* WAR. 289 laid that fine province under contribution, and even menaced Vienna. He failed, however, at the siege of Olmutz, but he effected a retreat as honourable as a victory, and suddenly directed his march against the Russians, whose ravages in Brandenburgh were shocking to humanity. He gained a complete victory over the invaders at Zomdorff, and then, without resting a moment, hasted to relieve his brother Henry, who was almost surrounded with enemies in Saxony. Count Daun, the commander of the imperialists, was a worthy rival of Frederic; he surprised and routed the Prussian right wing at Hochkirchen ; but the judicious measures of the king saved the rest of his army, and Daun was unable to pursue his advan tages. Indeed so little was Frederic affected by the reverse, that he drove the Austrians a second time from Silesia, and then returning, compelled Daun to raise the sieges of Dresden and Leipsic, and even retreat into Bohemia. The enterprising spirit of Mr. Pitt, freed from the trammels which secret intrigues had formed, diffused itself through the British empire, and particularly animated the officers of the army and navy. Several French ships of war were captured by the British ; an armament, destined for North America, was dispersed and driven on shore by Sir Edward Hawke, whose fleet rode triumphant in the Channel. From apathy and despair the nation passed at once to the opposite extreme of overweening confidence. It was resolved to carry the war into France itself, and two successive expeditions were sent against the French coast. As might reasonably have been anticipated, these armaments produced no important result ; the only consequence arising from such a waste of blood and treasure, was the destruc tion of Cherbourg, a triumph dearly purchased by the subsequent loss of some of the best of the troops in the hurried embarkation But in North America, where the British arms had been tarnished by delay, disaster, and disgrace, the removal of the earl of Loudon from the command, led to a complete change in the fortune of the war. His successor, General Abercrombie, planned three simultaneous expeditions, two of which produced triumphant results. General Amherst laid siege to Louisbourg, and aided by the talents of Brigadier Wolfe, who was fast o"], [304, "290 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. rising into eminence, forced that important garrison to surrender. This was followed by the entire reduction of the island of Cape Breton, and the inferior stations which the French occupied in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Brigadier Forbes was sent against Fort du Quesne, which the French abandoned at his approach, and fled down the Mississippi. Abercrombie marched in person against Ticonderago, which he found better fortified than he had anticipated, and after a useless manifestation of desperate valour, he was forced to retire with considerable loss. The French were, at the same time, deprived of all their settlements on the coast of Africa ; but the count de Lally, not only preserved their East Indian possessions, but wrested from the English, Fort St. David and Cuddalore. Great anxiety was felt at the opening of the next campaign (a. d. 1759). Early in the year, the Prussians destroyed the Russian magazines in Poland, laid Bohemia under contribution, and reduced the imperial armies to inactivity. But Prince Ferdinand was unable to prevent the French from sending succours to the Austrians ; and his ill-success once more exposed Llanover to an invasion. Had Ferdinand wavered, the British and Hanoverians might have been forced to a second convention as disgraceful as Closterseven, but his courage rose with the crisis, he engaged the French at Minden, and gained a complete victory. Minden, indeed, would have been as illustrious and decisive a battle as Blenheim, but for the unaccountable conduct of Lord George Saekville, who commanded the cavalry, and cither misunderstood or disobeyed the order to charge the discomfited French. There had been some previous disputes between the prince and Lord George ; they threw the blame mutually on each other, but whichever was in fault, it is certain that on this occasion the best opportunity that could have been desired for humbling the power of France was irretrievably lost. The victory of the British, at Minden, was more than coun terbalanced by the defeat of the Prussians, by the united forces of Austria and Russia, at Cunersdorff. But the heroic Frederic soon retrieved this disaster, and he would probably have triumphed in his turn, had he not exposed a large division of his"], [305, "THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR. 291 troops in the defiles of Bohemia, which was surrounded and taken by Count Daun. Still the only permanent acquisition that the Austrians made was Dresden, for Frederic's vigour and rapidity of movement rendered even their victories fruitless. This indecisive campaign greatly diminished the ardour of the English for their ally, the king of Prussia, while their victories in North America, and the West Indies, directed their attention to their colonial interests. Immediately after the conquest of Louisbourg, which was justly considered the key of Canada, an expedition was planned against Quebec. The colonists were prepared to submit to a change of masters, by the politic protection granted to the French settlers in Guada loupe, which had been subdued early in the year (a. d. 1758) ; and by the guarantee given to the inhabitants for the enjoyment of religious freedom. When General Wolfe, therefore, proceeded up the St. Lawrence, he did not encounter any serious opposi tion from the Canadians, who seemed to view the struggle with indifference. While Wolfe advanced towards Quebec, General Amherst conquered Ticonderago and Crown Point, and Sir William Johnson gained possession of the important fortress of Niagara. But Amherst, as had been originally intended, was unable to form a junction with General Wolfe, who was thus employed in a hazardous enterprise, with very inadequate means. Though he almost despaired of success, Wolfe resolved to persevere ; he adopted the daring plan of landing at night under the Heights of Abraham, leading his men up the steep, and securing this position, which commanded the town. The stream was rapid, the landing place narrow, and the precipices formidable even by day, but the soldiers, animated by their heroic commander, triumphed over these difficulties ; and when mornino- dawned, the marquis de Montcalm was astonished to learn that the British army occupied those heights which he had deemed inaccessible. A battle was now inevitable, and both generals prepared for the contest with equal courage. The battle was brief but fierce; the scale of victory was just beginning to turn in favour of the British, when Wolfe fell mortally wounded. This loss only roused the English regiments to fresh exertion, their bayonets broke the French lines, and a o 2"], [306, "292 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. body of Hiohlanders, charging with their broadswords, com pleted the confusion. The French fled in disorder ; the intellio-ence was brought to Wolfe, he collected his breath to exclaim, \" I die happy,\" and instantly expired (Sept. 13). The marquis de Montcalm fell in the same field ; he was not inferior to his rival in skill and bravery, nor did he meet death with less intrepidity. When told, after the battle, that his wounds were mortal, he exclaimed, \" So much the better : I shall not live to witness the surrender of Quebec.\" Five days after the battle, that city opened its gates to a British garrison, and this was soon followed by the complete subjugation of the Canadas, which have ever since remained subject to the crow-n of Great Britain. The success of the English in the East Indies, was scarcely less decisive than in America. Lally, the French general, possessed more courage than prudence, he engaged in enterprises beyond his means, and especially wasted his limited resources in .a vain attack on Madras. Colonel Coote, the commander of the English forces, was inferior to his adversaries in numerical strength, but he enjoyed ampler pecuniary resources, and was far superior to Lally, both as a general and a statesman. Coote and Lally came to an engagement at Wandewash (Jan. 21, 1760), in which the French were completely overthrown, and .their influence in the Camatic destroyed. During the campaign, Admiral Pococke defeated a French fleet off the coast of Ceylon ; .the English, in consequence, became masters of the Indian seas, .and began to form reasonable expectations of driving their rivals ifrom Hindustan. A Dutch armament arrived in Bengal, under suspicious circumstances, but Clive ordered that it should be immediately attacked by land and sea * ; the Dutch were forced to surrender, and ample apologies were made by the authorities of Holland for this infraction of treaties.

Admiral Boscawen pursued a squadron from Toulon, that tried to slip unnoticed through the Straits of Gibraltar, overtook it off Cape Lagos, on the coast of Portugal (August 18th), destroyed two ships of the line and captured two more. A still more important triumph was obtained by Sir Edward Hawke, between Belleisle and Quiberon (Nov. 20th). Conflans, the French admiral, takino- advantage of the gales that drove the blockading squad rons off the coast, put to sea, but was soon overtaken by Hawke. Conflans, unwilling to hazard a battle, sought shelter among the rocks and shallows of his own coast. Hawke unhesitatingly encountered the perils of a stormy sea and a lee shore ; he gained a decisive victory, destroying four ships of the line, and compell ing another to strike her colours. A tempestuous night alone saved the French fleet from destruction. Though this victory delivered the English from all fears of the invasion, some alarm was excited by the enterprises of Commodore Thurot, who sailed from Dunkirk with five frigates, and hovered round the coasts of North Britain. Having failed to make any impression on Scotland, he entered the Irish Sea, and landing at Carrick fergus, stormed and pillaged that town*. Having heard the news of Conflans' defeat, he steered homewards, but was swiftly pursued by a squadron under Commodore Elliot, and overtaken near the Isle of Man (Feb. 28th, 1760). After a fierce engage ment, Thurot was killed and all his vessels forced to surrender. Vigorous preparations were made by all parties for the main tenance of the war in Germany, although the people of England had become weary of continental connexions, and the French finances had fallen into a state of lamentable disorder (a. d. \u2022 An interesting example of humanity softened the horrors of war during the attack on Carrickfergus. While the French and the garrison were engaged in the streets, a beautiful child, unconscious of its danger, ran between both parties. A. French grenadier, moved with compassion, threw down his musket, rushed into the midst of the fire, took up the child, and having placed it in safety, returned to his companions, who with loud shouts applauded the heroic deed."], [308, "294 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. 1760). The conduct of the people of France to their sovereign was, indeed, truly generous ; the principal nobility and gentry sent their plate to the treasury to be coined for the public service; an army of nearly one hundred thousand men was assembled in Westphalia, under the duke de Broglio, while an inferior army was formed upon the Rhine, under Count St. Germain. Prince Ferdinand could not have coped with such an overwhelming force, had not the French generals quarrelled with each other. Several battles were fought, but they were all more or less indecisive ; and rarely has there been a campaign in which such numerous and well-appointed armies were opposed that produced so few memorable events. The king of Prussia resolved to act on the defensive in Saxony, while his brother Henry opposed the Russians and Austrians in Silesia. But his plans were deranged by the enterprise of Marshal Laudohn, who surrounded the Prussian general Fouquet, slew three thousand of his army, and compelled the remainder to surrender at discretion. Frederic attempted to retrieve his affairs by a sudden advance on Dresden, but he failed to capture the city ; his brother, Prince Henry, was more fortunate in raising the siege of Breslau, which Laudohn had invested after his victory. But Frederic's ruin seemed unavoid able, as the Russians were advancing with overwhelming forces, and he was himself surrounded by three Austrian armies at Lignitz. Count Daun marched to storm the Prussian camp, in full confidence of victory, but, to his astonishment, he found it deserted, Frederic having marched that very night to meet the army of Marshal Laudohn, who was eagerly pressing forward to share, as he fondly believed, in assured victory. The heights of Pfaffendorff, judiciously protected by a formidable array of artillery, prevented Daun from marching to the assistance of his colleague ; Laudohn was completely defeated, and the Austrian grand army driven from Silesia. But this victory did not prevent the success of the enemy in other quarters ; the Russians being joined by a considerable body of Austrians, under General Lascy, pushed forward through Brandenburgh, and made them selves masters of Berlin. They levied a heavy contribution on the city, and destroyed its arsenals, founderies, and public works."], [309, "THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR. 295 The Prussians were equally unfortunate in Saxony, but Frederic resolved to run every risk to recover a country that had hitherto supplied the chief support to his armies. Daun, equally convinced of the importance of Saxony, protected the electorate with a force of seventy thousand men, advantageously posted in a fortified camp near Torgau. Frederic, with only fifty thousand men, resolved to attack the Austrians in their en trenchments, and to stake his life and crown on the hazard of the engagement (Nov. 3rd). The battle was furious, but the ardour of the Prussians, who felt that they fought for the very existence of their country, was irresistible. Daun was borne from the field severely wounded ; the Austrians were broken by desperate charges, and night alone saved them from total ruin. The result of this glorious victory was, that Frederic recovered all Saxony except Dresden, and compelled the Russians, Austrians, and Swedes, to evacuate his dominions. The Canadian war was not terminated by the capture of Quebec ; the French had still formidable forces in the country, and they made a vigorous effort to recover that city. They were baffled by the intrepidity of General Murray ; and General Amherst, soon after having obtained re-inforcements from Eng land, advanced to Montreal, and compelled the entire French army to capitulate. The savage tribes of Indians, who had been induced by French gold to attack the British settlements, were now severely chastised, and compelled to make the most humi liating submissions. Not less complete was the success of the English arms in India ; Pondicherry and Mahie were reduced by Colonel Coote, the French power in the East completely subverted, and the Enolish rendered masters of the commerce of the vast peninsula of Hindustan. These important acquisitions made the English very impatient of the German war ; they complained of the inactivity of the navy, and asserted that the French islands in the West Indies, more valuable to a commercial people than half the German empire, might have been gained with far less risk and loss than attended the protection of the useless electorate of Hanover. In the midst of these disputes, George II. died suddenly, in the seventy-seventh year of his age (Oct. 25). He"], [310, "296 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM was succeeded by his grandson, George III., a young prince in his twenty-third year, who had hitherto taken no active part in public life. The death of George II. produced little change in European politics ; but that of the peaceful Spanish monarch, Ferdinand VI. (a. d. 1759), led to some important results. His successor, Charles III., was king of the Two Sicilies, and by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, it had been agreed, that on his accession to the throne of Spain, his former kingdom should devolve to Don Philip, duke of Parma and Placentia, and that these duchies should be resigned to the empire. By the mediation of France with Austria, Charles was enabled to procure the Neapolitan throne for his third son Ferdinand, while Philip was permitted to retain Parma and Placentia. Grateful for such a benefit, Charles signed the family compact, which bound the Bourbon princes to afford each other mutual assistance, and secretly prepared to join France in the war against Great Britain. The haughty conduct of the English diplomatists, which was not unjustly offensive to Spanish pride, greatly contributed to strengthen the resolution of the court of Madrid, especially as the naval superiority of the English menaced the communica tions of Spain with her American colonies. Negociations for peace were commenced by the courts of France and Great Britain soon after the accession of George III., but with little sincerity on either side (a. d. 1761). Mr. Pitt was firmly resolved to humble the house of Bourbon ; the duke de Choiscul, the French minister, relied on the secret promises of Spanish aid, and thus it was impossible to arrange preli minaries. The war languished in Germany : Prince Ferdinand succeeded in protecting Hanover, but he could not prevent the French from ravaging Westphalia and East Friesland. The king of Prussia, exhausted even by his victories, was forced to act on the defensive ; though he lost no battle, he had the morti fication to see the Russians make themselves masters of Colberg, and the Austrians surprise Schweidnitz. The possession of these important places enabled the Russians to establish their winter-quarters in Pomerania, and the Austrians in Silesia. On sea, the honour of the British flag was maintained in several"], [311, "THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR. 297 actions between single ships and small squadrons. The island of Belleisle, on the coast of France, was captured by a British armament, but at a very disproportionate cost of blood and treasure. This languid campaign seemed to prove that all parties were weary of the war, and negotiations were resumed. In their progress, Mr. Pitt discovered the intimate connexion that had been formed between the courts of Versailles and Madrid ; and he proposed to anticipate the hostile designs of the latter, by seizing the plate-fleet, laden with the treasures of Spanish America. But the colleagues of Mr. Pitt, already dissatisfied with his imperious manners, refused to adopt such bold measures, and he instantly resigned the seals of office. The king, anxious to introduce his favourite, the earl of Bute, into the cabinet, adopted the opinions of the majority of his council, and accepted the resignation. Fierce political disputes arose, whose effects were felt throughout Europe ; the hopes of the French court were raised, and the German allies of Britain were greatly dispirited. But the new ministry showed no want of alacrity in main tainino the honour of the country. One of their earliest measures was a declaration of war against Spain, the conduct of the court of Madrid having amply justified Mr. Pitt's anticipations of its hostile designs (a.d. 1762). The superiority of the British navy over the combined fleets of France and Spain, hindered these powers from making any attempt at colonial conquests ; but they believed themselves equally superior by land, and therefore resolved to attack Britain through the side of its ancient ally, Portugal. Few kingdoms had sunk into such a state of degradation as Portugal at this period. Trusting to the protection of England, and enriched by the treasures of Brazil, the court of Lisbon reposed in ignorance and indolence ; its fortresses were neglected, its army mouldering away, its subjects destitute of martial spirit. The earthquake that laid Lisbon in ruins was followed by a dangerous conspiracy against the life of Joseph, the reign ing sovereign. This monarch, less superstitious than most Portuguese kings, had banished the Jesuits from his court, and 03"], [312, "298 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. had resented with spirit the encroachments of his nobles. Some of the dissatisfied Jesuits and nobles formed a plot to murder the king, and he was dangerously wounded by assassins while on his road from his country-seat to Lisbon. The principal conspirators were arrested and punished by cruel deaths ; and all the Jesuits banished from the kingdom (a.d. 1759). But the nobles continued discontented; the pope and the clergy resented the expulsion of the Jesuits, while the superstitious Portuguese seemed ready to renounce their allegiance to a sovereign who had incurred the resentment of the Church. Such was Joseph's situation, when the ministers of France and Spain presented a joint demand that he should instantly renounce his alliance with Britain, under pain of incurring their resentment, and allowing him only four days to deliberate on his answer. Joseph at once returned a spirited refusal to such an insolent memorial, and the Spanish army crossed the frontiers. An auxiliary British force of eight thousand men was sent to Portugal, together with a large supply of arms and ammunition. Joseph entrusted the command of his army to the count de la Lippe, who had already distinguished himself in Germany. The skill of this commander, and the valour of the British officers, compelled the Spaniards to evacuate the kingdom, with loss and disgrace, before the close of the campaign. The French hoped that the invasion of Portugal would facili tate the progress of their arms in Germany; but Prince Fer dinand, and the marquis of Granby, not only protected Hanover, but recovered the greater part of Hesse. An unex pected event delivered the king of Prussia from the ruin that seemed to threaten him at the close of the last campaign. Elizabeth, empress of Russia, died, and was succeeded by her nephew Peter III., who entertained a romantic admiration of Frederic. The new emperor not only put an end to hostilities, but entered into alliance with the Prussian monarch ; and Europe saw with astonishment the unprecedented spectacle of an army marching off from its former allies to the camp of its enemies. Sweden followed the example of Russia in concluding peace ; and Frederic, taking advantage of these favourable circumstances, recovered Schweidnitz and drove the Austrians from Silesia."], [313, "THE SEVEN YEARS* WAR 299 A new revolution in Russia compelled the Prussian king to halt in his victorious career. The reforms of Peter III. had given offence to a great body of his subjects ; he was dethroned by his wife, who usurped the throne, with the title of Catherine II. Peter died in prison a few days after his deposition, but it has not been ascertained w-hether he was the victim of disease or violence. Catherine did not renew the w-ar against Prussia, as had been at first expected, but she withdrew her forces, and resolved to observe a strict neutrality. Frederic's victories had in the mean time so seriously alarmed the Austrians, that they consented to a cessation of hostilities for Silesia and Saxony. This impolitic truce laid Bohemia open to Frederic : one division of his army advanced to the very gates of Prague and destroyed a valuable magazine ; another laid the greater part of Egra in ashes, while detachments ravaged Franconia, and even Siiabia. The princes of the empire hasted to conclude treaties of neutra lity, and the war was left to be decided by the powers of Prussia and Austria, between which the contest had begun. In the mean time the English conquered the chief islands that the French still retained in the West Indies, Martinique, St. Lucie, Grenada, and St. Vincent ; while the Spaniards suffered the more severe loss of Havannah, the capital of Cuba, and the large fleet that lay in its harbour. Nor was this the least alarming of the consequences that resulted to the court of Madrid from its unwise interference ; an armament from Madras, under the command of Admiral Cornish and General Draper, captured Manilla, and the fall of this city involved the fate of the whole range of the Philippine islands. France and Spain, heartily tired of a war which threatened ruin to the colonies of both, became desirous of peace, and they found the earl of Bute, who now ruled the British cabinet, equally anxious to terminate the war. Indeed, so anxious was that minister to avoid a continuance of hostilities, that he not only stopped the career of colonial conquest, but consented to sacrifice several acquisitions that Britain had already made. Still the British nation gained by the war, the whole of Canada and part of Louisiana, the chief settlements on the western coast of Africa, and a decided superiority in India ; had the war"], [314, "300 MERCANTILE AND COLONIAL SYSTEM. lasted another year, had even the fair claims of Britain's position been supported by her negociators, these gains would have been more extensive and more secure. Contrary to all expectation, the preliminaries were sanctioned by a majority of the British parliament, and soon after the definite treaty was signed at Paris (Feb. 10, 1763). The king of Prussia and the empress of Austria, deserted by their respective allies, agreed to a reconciliation about the same time, on the basis of a restitu tion of conquests and an oblivion of injuries. The result of the continental war was, that Prussia aud Austria became the principal European powers, France lost her political pre-eminence when united to the empire, and England abandoned her influence in the European system, maintaining an intimate relation only with Portugal and Holland. Britain by the colonial war obtained complete maritime supremacy ; she commanded the entire commerce of North America and Hin dustan, and had a decided superiority in the West Indian trade. But during the seven years' war a question arose which led to very important discussions ; France, unable to maintain a commercial intercourse with her colonies, opened the trade to neutral powers ; England declared this traffic illegal, and relying on her naval superiority, seized neutral vessels and neutral property bound to hostile ports. The return of peace put an end to the dispute for a season, but it became the subject of angry controversy in every future war. The internal condition of England improved rapidly during the contest by the exten sion of the funding system ; the pecuniary affairs of the govern ment became intimately connected with those of the nation ; by far the greater part of the loans required for the war was raised at home, so the increase of the national debt more closely united the rulers and the people in the bonds of a common interest. This altered state of things scarcely- excited notice, though it was the chief source of the permanence and stability displayed by the British government when revolutionary move ments threatened to subvert the other dynasties of Europe."], [315, "301 CHAPTER VII. THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. Section I. \u2014 Change in the Relations of the Catholic Poicers to the Holy See \u2014 Suppression of the order of Jesuits \u2014 Dismemberment of Poland. No country had suffered so severely as France during the late war ; the finances had long been in confusion, ,and the profligate expenditure of a demoralized court aggravated the indignation produced by national distress. Louis XV., though not destitute of abilities, was the slave of his sensual appetites ; ruled by his mistresses, and other unworthy favourites, he connived at glaring abuses, and sanctioned the grossest acts of tyranny and rapacity. A spirit of opposition spread through the kingdom, several of the parliaments refused to register the edicts for the continuance of war-taxes, and others remonstrated in a tone of censure to which the French monarchs had been long unaccus tomed. This unusual liberty of the parliaments had been in some degree fostered by the court itself; the king permitted these bodies to set bounds to ecclesiastical tyranny, and to suppress the order of the Jesuits in France (a. d. 1762) ; and their spirit was further increased by the intrigues of the duke de Choiseul, who persuaded the king to allow the Parisian parliament to pass sentence on Lally, the unfortunate com mander of the French in India, whose only crime was failure under circumstances that rendered success impossible. Popular discontent was at the same time rapidly spreading in Spain, where the reforms of the prime minister, Squillace, offended the obstinate prejudices of an ignorant and bigoted nation. Charles III. yielded to the clamours of his subjects and dismissed the minister, but he firmly resolved to take vengeance on the Jesuits, who were supposed to have secretly instigated the insurrection. A reforming minister in Portugal maintained"], [316, "302 THE AGE OP REVOLUTIONS. his post in spite of opposition ; the marquis of Pombal ruled the land with iron sway, and confident in the rectitude of his inten tions, scorned all opposition. But though he removed all impe diments, including the higher order of nobility and the society of Jesuits, his reforms took no root in the land, and the institutions which he established by force perished when that force was taken away. The enmity of Pombal and Choiseul to the Jesuits was felt in the Spanish cabinet ; the king was indignant at their share in the late disturbances, his minister, Count d'Aranda, regarded the order as hostile to all existing governments. Both took their measures with profound secrecy (a. d. 1767)- The houses of the Jesuits in Madrid were surrounded at night, and the inmates commanded to set out instantly for the coast. An edict was then issued for the banishment of the regulars of that com munity from Spain and its colonies, and the confiscation of their temporalities. The Jesuits in Mexico and Peru were similarly seized ; and in Paraguay, where they had established an almost independent empire, they were suddenly deposed and trans ported to Europe. The king of Naples and the duke of Parma followed the example of the court of Spain, in spite of the urgent remonstrances of Pope Clement XIII. ; they also placed new restrictions on the pontiff's jurisdiction in their states, and when Clement made a vigorous effort to support the ancient privileges of the Holy See, he found himself opposed to all the Italian powers, except the king of Sardinia, to the remonstrances of Spain and Portugal, and the active hostility of France. While these disputes between the catholic powers and the head of their church proved that the supremacy of the papacy no longer existed, but in name, the struggles of a small insular people to maintain their national independence excited general sympathy. The Genoese transferred their nominal claims over the island of Corsica to the crown of France, and Choiseul sent a large army to occupy this new acquisition. But the Cor sicans, justly enraged at the transfer of their allegiance without the formality of asking their consent, boldly flew to arms, and under the command of the heroic Paoli, prepared for an obstinate resistance. Had the British ministry interfered, the result of"], [317, "303 AFFAIRS OF FRANCE. the contest would have been very doubtful ; but Paoli could not resist the entire force of France, he was driven by the vast superiority of numbers from post to post, until every strong place had yielded to the invaders, when he cut his way through the enemy, and embarked for Leghorn (a. d. 1769). The island submitted to Louis, but many of the Corsicans long continued to harass the French by a guerilla war in their mountain fastnesses. Choiseul, finding his influence with Louis XV. on the decline, sought to strengthen it by cementing the alliance between the courts of Paris and Vienna. He effected a marriage between the king's grandson and heir and Marie Antoinette, daughter of the empress dowager. These ill-omened nuptials were cele brated with extraordinary splendour during a season of great public distress ; during the festivities a fatal accident cast a shade of melancholy over all parties ; some confusion arose in the crowd of spectators, and nearly two hundred persons lost their lives in the tumult. Choiseul involved the king in a quarrel with the parliaments, which precipitated the fall of that able minister; the king reluctantly consented to abandon the new forms of jurisdiction which were proposed, and allow the old courts to resume their functions. This unfortunate and dis honourable proceeding completed the abasement of France; it was notorious that the duke de Choiseul owed his disgrace to the intrigues of the king's profligate mistress * ; and whatever may have been the faults of that minister, he would certainly never have permitted the influence of his country to sink so low as it did during the administration of his successor, the duke d'Aguillon. While France was thus declining, the Russian empire was rapidly acquiring a preponderating influence in eastern Europe. The empress Catherine procured the throne of Poland for one of her favourites, Stanislaus Augustus (a. d. 1765), having sent a Russian army to overawe the diet, when it assembled to choose a sovereign. Frederic of Prussia, anxious to remedy the calamities which the seven years' war had brought upon his country, did not venture to oppose the schemes of the ambitious * Madame du Barri. She was subsequently one of the victims of the French revolution."], [318, "304 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. czarina ; on the contrary, he was gained over by some commer cial concessions to aid her projects with all his influence. The new sovereign of Poland, opposed by a licentious aristocracy and a bigoted people, was unable to remedy the disorders of the state, or control the events that soon furnished a pretext for the interference of his powerful neighbours. Poland had long been agitated by religious disputes ; the oppressions of the catholics compelled the dissidents, as the dissenting sects were called, to seek foreign protection, those of the Greek church appealed to the empress of Russia, while the Lutherans sought aid from the kings of Prussia and Denmark. Catherine, with great prompti tude, sent an army to enforce the claims of the dissidents, and paying little regard to the remonstrances of Stanislaus, acted as if Poland had been one of her own provinces. The. catholic lords formed a confederacy to maintain the purity of their religion, and the independence of their country, but they were unable to compete with the overwhelming forces of Russia; Cracow, where they attempted to make a stand, was taken by storm, the fugitives were pursued beyond the Turkish frontiers, and the country that had afforded them refuge was cruelly devastated. Mustapha III. was more peacefully inclined than most of the sultans that have filled the throne of Constantinople, but he felt that the power which Russia was acquiring in Poland would be dangerous to the security of his northern provinces, he was indignant at the violation of his dominions, and he was secretly instigated by the French court. The king of Prussia vainly remonstrated with the sultan* ; Mustapha had formed an extravagant estimate of his military resources, and he is said to have been animated by a personal dislike of Catherine. The war was commenced by the Turks (a. d. 1769) ; their irregular troops entered Southern Russia, and committed the most frightful ravages; but when they hazarded a regular engagement at Choczim, they suffered a severe defeat. Catherine prepared to strike a more decisive blow against the Turkish power; she * Frederic, who loved to indulge in sarcasm, said that a war between the Russians and Turks would be a contest between the one-eyed and the blind."], [319, "305 INCREASING POWER OF RUSSIA. sent a fleet from the Baltic round to the Mediterranean, to support an insurrection which her emissaries had excited in Southern Greece (a. d. 1770). The insurgents, aided by a Russian force, at first gained some advantages, but on the first reverse they were abandoned by their allies to the brutal retali ations of their Turkish masters. Soon after, the Turkish fleet of fifteen ships of the line was burned by a Russian squadron in the bay of Chesme, with the exception of a single vessel that was captured. This was followed by the defeat of the grand Ottoman army near the Pruth, the capture of Bender, Aker man, and Ismail, and the occupation of the entire province of Bessarabia. Stanislaus was forced to join in the war against the Turks, though he knew that one of the chief causes of their taking up arms was to defend the independence of Poland. But Joseph, who had succeeded his father in the German empire (a. d. 1765), began to dread the dangerous ambition of Russia ; and even his mother, Maria Theresa, began to court the friendship of her old rival, Frederic, as a counterpoise to the governing power .of the czarina. It was obviously the interest of the Northern states, Denmark and Sweden, to adopt a similar course of policy, but the govern ments of both countries were too deeply engaged by their domestic affairs to attend to the state of their foreign relations. Frederic V., one of the best monarchs that ever occupied the throne of Denmark, was succeeded by Christian V., a prince of weak intellect and dissipated habits (a.d. 1766). Soon after his accession, Christian married Caroline Matilda, one of the sisters of the king of England, and the engaging manners of this princess won her the favour of the Danish king and people. To maintain her ascendancy over the mind of her husband, Caroline favoured the ambition of Struensee, a foreign adventurer, who was raised to the office of prime minister, or rather sole ruler of Denmark. Struensee's administration was vigorous and useful, but his haughtiness gave great offence to the Danish nobles ; a conspiracy was formed against him, of which the king's step-mother and her son Frederic were the principal instigators, and it was resolved to involve the unfor tunate queen Caroline in his fate. Struensee and his friend"], [320, "306 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. Brandt were arrested at midnight, by virtue of an order which had been extorted from the imbecile Christian, they were in sulted with the mockery of a trial, and put to a cruel death. The queen was also arrested and sent a prisoner to Oronenberg Castle ; dread of British vengeance, however, saved her from personal violence, she was permitted to retire to Hanover, where the remainder of her life was spent in comparative ob scurity. The queen dowager having removed her rival, usurped the royal authority ; a young nobleman named Bernstorff was appointed prime minister, and the court of Copenhagen became remarkable for its subserviency to that of St. Petersburgh. Gustavus III., a young prince of great vigour and sagacity, ascended the Swedish throne on the death of his father, Adol phus Frederic (a.d. 1771); he had long formed a project for removing the restrictions which the senate had imposed on the royal authority after the death of Charles XII., and his efforts were seconded by the bulk of the nation, long weary of aristo cratic tyranny. The senate, suddenly surrounded by armed bands, was intimidated into assenting to the instrument of government which Gustavus had prepared, and a revolution which changed Sweden from one of the most limited into one of the most absolute monarchies of Europe, was effected without spilling a drop of blood. Dread of a counter-revolution, and the necessity of providing some remedy for the distress which pre vailed in Sweden, prevented Gustavus from interfering in the affairs of Poland, a country that had often occupied the anxious cares of his predecessors. Stanislaus was sincerely anxious to confer the blessings of tranquillity and good government on Poland; but all his judi cious measures were frustated by the Polish nobles, who clung to their tyrannous and absurd privileges, though they were known to be as pernicious to themselves as they were ruinous to the country. An attempt on the personal liberty- of the unhappy king gave Catherine a pretext for sending a Russian army into the country, and suggested to the Prussian king a scheme for the dismemberment of Poland. A treaty was con cluded between Austria, Russia, and Prussia, for dividing the Polish provinces between them ; their armies instantly occupied"], [321, "SUPPRESSION OF THE ORDER OF JESUITS. 307 their several shares ; and the diet, overawed by the united forces of the three powers, was forced to acquiesce in an arrangement that left Poland a merely nominal existence (a.d. 1773). The unhappy Stanislaus, reproached for calamities which it was not in his power to avert, could not avoid retorting on his accusers, and attributing the national calamities to the bigotry, the factious spirit, and the incessant contentions of the turbulent nobles. By the intervention of Prussia, a treaty was subse quently concluded betwTeen Russia and Turkey, by which the empress gained several important fortresses, a large acquisition of territory, and permission for her subjects to navigate the Black Sea (a.d. 1774). Great as these gains were, they were less valuable in themselves than as means for obtaining other objects of Catherine's secret ambition. Degraded as Louis XV. was, he could not receive without emotion, intelligence of events which showed the low ebb to which the influence of France was reduced. When informed of the partition of Poland, he could not refrain from exclaiming, \" Had Choiseul been still in the cabinet, this disgraceful trans action might have been averted.\" The duke d'Aguillon merited this reproach, but he resolved to atone for his negligence by gratifying the national hatred against the Jesuits, though he had long been suspected of secretly favouring that order. The death of Clement XIII. favoured his projects (a.d. 1769). Ganganelli, who succeeded to the papacy under the title of Clement XIV., felt that the time was for ever gone by when the extravagant claims of the pontiffs could be maintained, and he therefore sought a reconciliation with the catholic sovereigns by making reasonable concessions. After a long but not unjus tifiable delay, he issued a bull suppressing the order of Jesuits, and most of the catholic prelates, who had long been jealous of that fraternity, eagerly enforced the papal edict (a.d. 1773). Little opposition was made by the Jesuits to this decree, but an insurrection in Sicily and the deaths of Louis XV. and Pope Ganganelli (a. d. 1774) were attributed to their secret practices, though not a shadow of proof could be adduced to support such severe accusations. Indeed, it is notorious that Louis died of smallpox, and Ganganelli of a constitutional disease to which"], [322, "308 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. he had long been a martyr. Louis XVI., of whom his subjects had long been taught to form the most favourable expectations, ascended the throne of France ; Angelo Braschi was elected to the papacy, under the title of Pius VI., by the influence of the more bigoted cardinals, who believed that he would be a more zealous supporter of the Church than his predecessors. Section II. \u2014 History of England from the Peace of Paris to the commencement of the American War. When the British ministry concluded a separate treaty with France, they dissevered their country from its expensive con nexion with the Continent, but at the same time they diminished its influence in European politics. Extensive colonies, rapidly increasing commerce, and improving manufactures, afforded the nation ample amends for this loss ; but a spirit of faction began to appear in the national councils, which produced a pernicious influence on the growing prosperity of the nation. While there was any reason to apprehend danger from the partisans of the Llouse of Stuart, the Brunswick dynasty was necessarily thrown for support on the whigs, for the tories were from principle more or less disposed to favour the claims of the exiled house ; but when all fears from the Pretender had disappeared, the zeal which the tories had ever shown for the maintenance of the royal prerogative naturally recommended them to royal favour. Personal friendship induced George III. to introduce the earl of Bute into the cabinet ; his influence excited the jealousy of the whigs, who had long monopolized the favour of the king and the nation ; they accused him of an attachment to toryism, of partiality to his Scottish countrymen, and of having sacrificed the interests of the nation at the peace. Unable or unwilling to face popular clamour, the earl of Bute resigned his office, but it was believed he privately retained his influence in the cabinet, and thus no small portion of his unpopularity was inherited by his successors."], [323, "309 COMMENCEMENT OF TnE AMERICAN WAR. John Wilkes, member of parliament for Aylesbury, assailed the ministers with great bitterness in a paper called the North Briton. The 45th number of this periodical contained a fierce attack on the king's speech at the opening of the parliamentary session ; and the ministers, forgetting discretion in their rage, issued a general warrant against the authors, printers, and publishers of the libel. Wilkes was arrested, but was soon liberated, on pleading privilege of parliament. The House of Commons, in opposition to the legal authorities, voted that privilege of parliament did not extend to the case of libel ; but it subsequently joined with the Lords in voting the illegality of general warrants. Wilkes in the mean time quitted the country, and not appearing to take his trial, w-as outlawed. So much was the nation engrossed by this dispute between the govern ment and an individual, that little attention was paid to colonial affairs ; but during this period the East India Company acquired several rich districts in Bengal, and displayed a grasping ambi tion, which threatened the independence of the native powers. A more dangerous prospect was opened in the American states. The French being removed, and the Indians driven into the back woods, the colonies began to increase rapidly in wealth, and their prosperity suggested to Mr. Grenville a scheme for makino- them share in the burden of taxation. The late war had been undertaken principally for the security of the colonists, they had been almost exclusively the gainers by its successful termination, and it was therefore deemed equitable that they should pay a portion of the cost. But the Americans were not represented in the British parliament, and they, together with a large party in Britain, maintained that they could not be consti tutionally taxed without their ow-n consent. Mr. Grenville, supported by his royal master, disregarded opposition, and an act was passed, imposing stamp-duties on a multitude of articles (a. d. 1765). A congress of deputies from the principal states assembled in Philadelphia, and voted a series of spirited remon strances against the measures of government. The northern colonies, frequently called New England, took the lead; they had been, for the most part, founded by puritan exiles, driven from Britain by the heat of persecution; they brought with"], [324, "310 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. them, and transmitted to their successors, a stern spirit of inde pendence, that necessarily led them to contemplate the establish ment of a republic. The dispute seemed to be allayed by a change in the British ministry ; the marquis of Rockingham, much against the king's will, repealed the obnoxious Stamp Act ; but he was forced to assert, in strong terms, the right of the king and parliament to enact laws, binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever. The marquis of Rockingham was soon obliged to give way to Mr. Pitt, who had been created earl of Chatham ; but the cabinet constructed by this once popular minister had no principle of union, and soon fell to pieces. The appointment of Lord North to the chancellorship of the exchequer, aggravated party ani mosities (a. d. 1767) ; the new minister was suspected of hostility to the American claims, and had taken a prominent part against Wilkes. That demagogue returned to England ; he was chosen member for the county of Middlesex at the general election, after which he surrendered himself to justice, obtained the reversal of his outlawry, and was sentenced to imprisonment for the libel he had published. When parlia ment met, it was supposed that Wilkes would take his seat for Middlesex, and a crowd assembled to escort him to the House ; some rioting occurred, the military were called out, and a scuffle ensued, in which some lives were lost. Wilkes stigmatized the employment of the soldiers on this occasion in the most unmea sured terms ; the ministers took advantage of this second libel to procure his expulsion from the House of Commons, but the electors of Middlesex re-elected him without any hesitation. The Commons resolved that an expelled member was incapable of sitting in the parliament that had passed such a sentence upon him, and issued a writ for a new election. Once more Wilkes was unanimously chosen, and once more the Commons refused to admit him. A new election was held, and Wilkes was returned by a great majority over Colonel Luttrell, the ministerial candidate. The House of Commons persevered in its declaration of Wilkes's incapacity, and resolved that Colonel Luttrell should be the sitting member. In their anxiety to crush a worthless individual, the ministers"], [325, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE AMERICAN WAR. 311 had now involved themselves in a contest on an important point of constitutional law, with all the constituencies of the nation. A fierce opposition was raised against them in England, and this not a little encouraged the Americans to persevere in their resistance. The resignation of the duke of Grafton, who wished to con ciliate the colonies, the removal of Earl Camden, who disapproved of the decision respecting the Middlesex election, and the appointment of Lord North as premier, added to the exasperation of parties (a.d. 1770). The imposition of a light duty on tea kept alive the dispute with America, while the concessions made to the court of Spain, in a dispute respecting the Falkland islands, were represented as a deliberate sacrifice of the honour of the country. The only beneficial result from these disputes was, the indirect license given to the publication of the parlia mentary debates, which had hitherto been deemed a breach of privilege. The Commons sent a messenger to arrest some printers and publishers, but the execution of their orders was opposed by the civic magistrates, Crosby, Oliver, and Wilkes. The two former were sent to the Tower ; but Wilkes refused to attend, unless permitted to take his seat for Middlesex, and the Com mons gave up the point by adjourning over the day on which he had been summoned to appear. Since that time the debates have been regularly published in the newspapers. The abuses in the government of the dominions of the East India Company having attracted considerable attention, a law was passed for bringing the affairs of that commercial association in some degree under the control of government ; but to reconcile the company to such interference, a loan was granted on favour able terms ; and also permission to export teas without payment of duty. A quantity of tea was shipped for Boston, and Lord North hoped that the low price of the commodity would induce the New-Englanders to pay the small duty charged on impor tation; but when the vessels arrived at Boston, they were boarded during the night by a party of the townsmen, and the cargoes thrown into the sea. This outrage, followed by other acts of defiance, gave such offence in England, that acts were passed for closing the port of Boston, and altering the consti-"], [326, "312 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. tution of the colony of Massachusetts (a. D. 1774). It was hoped that the other colonies would be warnedby this example ; but on the contrary, they encouraged the people of Massachusetts in their disobedience, and signed agreements against the impor tation of British merchandize, until the Boston Port Bill should be repealed, and the grievances of the colonies redressed. But though the colonists acted firmly, they showed the greatest anxiety for reconciliation ; they prepared addresses to the govern ment and their fellow-subjects, and they sent a memorial to the king, couched in terms equally spirited and respectful. The address to his majesty was not received, as it had emanated from an illegal assembly ; and the determination evinced by the new parliament, which met in 1775, to support ministerial measures, defeated all hopes of an accommodation. The mer chants and citizens of London, dreading the injury which would be brought on their trade by a contest with the colonies, sup ported the claims of the provincials ; but their connexion with the notorious Wilkes rendered the civic authorities distasteful to the court, and their remonstrances were disregarded. Blood was first shed at Lexington, where a party of American militia being ordered to disperse by a body of royal troops, showed symptoms of a refractory spirit, which led to a brief conflict. The British detachment, however, advanced to Con cord, in order to destroy some military stores which the provin cials had collected, but it was attacked on its return, and would have been' totally destroyed, had not fresh troops arrived to cover the retreat. These skirmishes were the signal for war; the colonial militia and volunteers blockaded the British garrison in Boston, intercepting its provisions and cutting off foraging parties. Not contented with thus harassing their enemies, the provincials fortified an eminence called Bunkcr's-hUl, from which they could open a formidable cannonade on the town. General Gage sent two thousand men to drive the Americans from the post, and a fierce contest ensued, in which the colonial militia proved itself able to compete with the regular army. The British finally succeeded, but their success was purchased by such a heavy loss, that General Gage resolved to confine himself to defensive operations. General Washington, whom the congress"], [327, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE AMERICAN WAR. 313 had chosen to be their commander, kept Boston closely block aded. The congress had not yet laid aside all hopes of peace, though they sent an army into Canada, commanded by Generals Montgomery and Arnold, to gain that colony over to the common cause. The Canadians, however, refused to join the other provincials ; Montgomery was killed, and Arnold, having failed in an attempt to storm Quebec, retreated with some precipitation. The continental powers, jealous of the maritime and com mercial prosperity of England, exulted in the contest thus unwisely provoked. Even the moderate king of France, though severely harassed by the disordered state of his finances, and the embarrassing disputes which had been raised by his grand father between the court and the parliaments, seemed disposed to favour the revolted colonies ; several of his ministers urged him to offer them support, but the opinion of Turgot, the wisest of the French cabinet, prevailed for a season ; he strenu ously condemned such interference as impolitic and unjust. Spain, involved in a disastrous war with the piratical states of Barbary, and in a less formidable dispute with Portugal, respecting the boundaries of their South American colonies, was slow to engage in fresh hostilities, and was resolved to imitate the example of France. The king of Prussia, indignant at the desertion of his interests in the peace of 1763, openly rejoiced in the embarrassments of the British ministry; and Catherine of Russia exulted in the hope of seeing the naval power most likely to oppose her ambitious schemes preparing to destroy what was believed to be the secret source of its strength. Under valuino- the power and the fortitude of the provincials, the king and his ministers resolved to force them into obedience, parlia ment seconded these views, and the great bulk of the people applauded their determination. It is useless to conceal that the American war was popular at its commencement. The vague notion of dominion over an entire continent flattered English pride, and the taxes which the ministers demanded, promised some alleviation to the public burdens. The colonial revolt was regarded by many as a rebellion, not against the British govern ment, but the British people, and the contest was generally p"], [328, "314 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. looked upon in England as an effort to establish, not the royal authority, but the supremacy of the nation. Section III. \u2014 The American War. Blood having once been shed, it was manifest that the dispute between Britain and her American colonies could only he decided by the sword. Both parties, therefore, prepared for the struggle, but apparently with some lingering hope of a restoration of peace. Mutual forbearance was exhibited by the hostUe generals, when the English were compelled to evacuate Boston ; Howe, the British commander, made no attempt to injure the town, and Washington permitted the royal army to retire unmolested. But the employment of German mercenaries, by the English ministry, completed the alienation of the colonists ; they resolved to separate themselves wholly from the mother country, and on the 4th of July, 1776, the congress published THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE THIRTEEN UNITED states. When this bold measure was adopted, the congress was destitute of money, ships, and allies ; its army was a raw militia, badly clothed and armed, while the English forces, greatly augmented, were preparing to seize New York. Neither did the first efforts of the new republicans open any flattering prospects of ultimate success ; the royalists defeated General Sullivan at Brooklyn, and took that commander prisoner ; they obliged Washington to abandon New York, subdued the province of New Jersey, and forced the congress to seek shelter in Maryland. Such success naturally inspired Howe with some contempt for the provincial forces ; he was ignorant of the patient watchfulness that marked the character of Washington, and he forgot the advantages that his adversaries derived from their superior local knowledge. Washington soon profited by the relaxed vigilance of his opponents ; seeing that the British forces were distributed in distant cantonments over too wide a space, he surprised a body of German mercenaries at Trenton, after which he drove the English garrison from Princeton, and recovered New Jersey,"], [329, "THE AMERICAN WAR. 315 The news of Howe's early success greatly gratified the English ministry ; a bold plan was formed for the total subjugation of the colonies, by sending an army under General Burgoyne, from Canada through the northern states, to co-operate with Howe in the south (a. d. 1777)- At first everything seemed favour able to the success of this project ; Sir William Howe defeated Washington at the battle of Brandywine, and became master of the important city of Philadelphia ; the Americans made an effort to retrieve their fortune by an attack upon German Town, but were repulsed with loss. In the mean time, Burgoyne, having reduced Ticonderago, commenced his march southwards, but found his progress impeded by a series of unexpected difficulties, arising partly from the nature of the country and partly from the vigilance of his enemies. Slow as his move ments necessarily were, those of the forces designed to co-operate with him were still more dilatory ; their leaders delayed their march to plunder and ravage the country, until the Canadian army was ruined. When Burgoyne reached Saratoga, he was surrounded by the American forces, under Generals Gates and Arnold; expecting every moment to receive the promised co operation of the southern forces, he made a spirited resistance ; but they had halted to burn the little town of \u00c6sopus, and before they resumed their march, Burgoyne and his soldiers were driven from their entrenchments, and forced to surrender prisoners of war. This disastrous termination of a campaign whose commence ment seemed so promising, did not abate the confidence of the British ministers or the British people. Conciliatory acts were, indeed, passed by the parliament, but before intelligence of this altered policy could be received in America, France had entered into a treaty, recognising the independence of the United States (a. d. 1778). There were already some in Britain who advocated this extreme measure ; the earl of Chatham vehemently opposed the dismemberment of the empire, but while addressing the Lords, he was struck down in a fit, and died within a few days. The nation mourned his loss, but it did not the less prepare vigorously to meet impending dangers. A declaration of war was issued against France, and a respectable fleet, commanded P 2"], [330, "316 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. by Admiral Keppel, sent to cruise in the Channel. Kcppel met and engaged the French fleet off Ushant, but being badly supported by Sir Hugh Palliser, the second in command, he was unable to make any use of the slight advantage he obtained. The co-operation of the French did not at first produce all the benefit to their cause that the Americans had anticipated. Sir Henry Clinton, who had succeeded Howe in the command of the British army, effected his retreat to New York in good order, and severely repulsed the Americans in an attempt to harass his rear. The provincial army sent to reduce Rhode Island was badly supported by the French admiral D'Estaing, and forced to abandon the enterprise. In consequence of this indecisive campaign, some hopes were formed of an accommoda tion, but the earl of Carlisle, and the other English commis sioners, found that the Americans would treat on no other basis than the acknowledgement of their independence, which the English government was not yet prepared to grant. The peace of the Continent was momentarily menaced by the efforts of the emperor Joseph to obtain possession of Bavaria, but the prompt interference of the king of Prussia, the remon strances of the empress Catherine, and the unwillingness of France to second the ambitious designs of Austria, compelled Joseph to relinquish his prey when it was almost within his grasp (a. d. 1779)- France alone, of the continental powers, had yet interfered in the American contest, but the intimate connexion between that country and Spain, led to a general belief that the latter would not long remain neutral. Nor was the expectation groundless ; the court of Madrid, after an insincere offer of mediation, threw off the mask, and openly prepared for active hostilities. Washington adopted a cautious defensive policy, by which his adversaries were more exhausted than by the loss of a battle. The English subdued Georgia, and made some progress in the Carolinas ; but the French captured several islands in the West Indies, and a Spanish fleet, for a time, rode triumphant in the Channel, and even insulted Plymouth. Serious riots in London tended more to lower the character of the English, among foreign nations, than these reverses. Some of the penal laws against the catholics having been repealed"], [331, "317 THE AMERICAN WAR. an association was formed by some ignorant fanatics for the protection of the protestant religion ; they stimulated the passions of the mob, and roused an immense multitude to acts of outrage. For several days, London was at the mercy of au infuriate populace ; some catholic chapels were burned, and many private houses destroyed. Tranquillity was at length restored by the interference of the military, and several of the rioters capitally punished. These disgraceful transactions alienated the court of Madrid at a time when it was disposed to negotiate, and the promise of the French to aid in the reduction of Gibraltar, confirmed the hostile dispositions of the Spaniards. The English had reduced all the French settlements in the East Indies in 1778, and humbled the Mahrattas; but a new and formidable enemy now appeared. Hyder Ali, a soldier of fortune, raised by chance to the throne of Seringapatam, resolved to drive the European intruders from Hindustan, and entered the Carnatic with overwhelming forces. The local government of Madras was unprepared for this event, and the resources at its command were wasted by the obstinacy and incapacity of the council. Owing to this mismanagement, the English forces, commanded by Baillie and Fletcher, were all either slain or taken by Hyder and his son Tippoo. The English arms were more successful in America ; Charles ton was taken by General Clinton and Admiral Arbuthnot ; three detachments were sent to complete the reduction of South Carolina, and one of these, commanded by Earl Comwallis, gained a brilliant victory near the town of Camden. But the Americans narrowly escaped a more serious danger ; Arnold, one of their most trusted generals, proved a traitor, and offered to surrender to the royalists the posts and troops with which he had been intrusted. Major Andre was sent from the British lines to arrange the conditions, but on his return he fell into the hands of the Americans, and was hanged as a spy, by too rigid an interpretation of the laws of war. Arnold narrowly escaped a similar fate; he took refuge on board an English vessel; the army he commanded proved faithful to the republic, and the alarm excited by the first discovery of his treason soon subsided. The maritime glory of England was ably maintained by Sir"], [332, "318 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. George Rodney ; he captured four Spanish ships of the line off Cape St. Vincent, drove two more on shore, and burned another ; thence proceeding to America, he thrice encountered the French fleet, under the count de Guichen, and though he obtained no decisive success, he prevented Washington from receiving naval aid in his meditated attack on New York. But the progress of the war now threatened to involve England in a new contest, with all the maritime powers, respecting the trade of neutral vessels. The empress of Russia took the lead in demanding freedom of trade for neutral vessels not laden with the munitions of war to all ports not actually blockaded ; she proposed that the northern powers should unite to support this right ; a confederacy, called the Armed Neutrality, was formed by Russia, Denmark, aud Sweden ; Holland promptly acceded to the league ; the courts of Vienna, Berlin, and Naples, adopted its principles ; the republic of Venice, and even Portugal, the oldest ally of England, joined the association. The British ministry temporized, they expected probably that the smothered jealousy between Austria and Prussia might lead to a war that would divert the attention of the continental powers, but these hopes were frustrated by the death of Maria Theresa, whose inveterate hatred of the Prussian monarch was not inherited by her successor. The conduct of the Dutch government had long been sus picious ; but proof was at length obtained of its having concluded a treaty with the American congress, and the remonstrances of the British minister were treated with disdain. War was instantly declared, and several of the Dutch colonies in the South American seas were subdued by the English forces. Nor was this the only calamity that befell the Dutch republic ; no sooner had the emperor Joseph succeeded to the ample inherit ance of Maria Theresa, than he commenced a series of important reforms, amongst which was included the dismantling- of the barrier towns in the Netherlands, which had been fortified at a vast expense to save Holland from the encroachments of France (a. d. 1781). A Dutch fleet, under Zoutman, was defeated by Admiral Parker, at the Doggers' Bank ; but the English had less success in the American seas, where Sir Samuel Hood was"], [333, "THE AMERICAN WAR. 319 reduced to inactivity by the superior force of Count de Grasse. The French admiral would not hazard a decisive engagement, but he sailed to aid General Washington in his course of operations for finishing the war by one decisive blow. The progress of the British forces, under Lord Cornwallis, in Virginia and the Carolinas, had raised great expectations of triumph in England, and had proportionably depressed the Americans. Washington having secured the co-operation of the French fleet, resolved to direct his whole force against the southern invading army, while he led his adversaries to believe that his design was to attack New York. Sir Henry Clinton was completely deceived; anxious to protect New York, he left Earl Cornwallis without assistance in Virginia, to contend against the united forces of the French and the Americans. Cornwallis, on the approach of the enemies, fortified himself in York-town, but he was unable to contend against the great disparity of force arrayed against him, and after a more vigorous resistance than could have been expected under the circumstances, he was forced to capitulate. This was the second British army that had been forced to surrender, and the disaster led to a general feeling in England, that any further protraction of the contest would be hopeless (a.d. 1782). The ministers, indeed, seemed at first resolved to continue the war, but they could no longer . command a parliamentary majority, and were forced to resign. A new ministry, formed by the marquis of Rockingham and Mr. Fox, commenced negotiations for peace, without at all relaxing in their efforts to support the war ; but before the results of the change could be fully developed, the ministry was dissolved by the death of the marquis. But ere this event produced any effect on the political aspect of affairs, two signal triumphs shed lustre on the arms of Britain. Admiral Rodney gained a decisive victory over the French fleet, under Count de Grasse, between the islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe ; and General Elliott, who had long been besieged in Gibraltar, defeated the formidable attack of the combined French and Spanish forces on that fortress, and burned, by showers of red- hot balls, the floating batteries, which the besiegers had fondly believed irresistible. In the East Indies, Sir Eyre Coote partly"], [334, "320 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. retrieved the fortunes of the company ; he recovered the Carnatic, and totally routed Hyder's army at Porto Novo (a. d. 1781) ; and again at Pollalore. All the Dutch settlements were captured (a. d. 1782), but this success was interrupted by the defeat of Colonel Braithwaite, whose forces were surprised, sur rounded, and cut to pieces by Tippoo and an auxiliary French force under M. Lally. Several indecisive engagements took place between Suffrein and Hughes, the French and English admirals, in the Indian seas ; and the operations of the British by land were impeded by the jealousies of the civil and military authorities (a.d. 1783). The death of Hyder, and the restora tion of peace between France and England, induced Tippoo to listen to terms of accommodation, and the English terminated this most unfortunate and disgraceful war, by submitting to humiliations from the son of Hyder, which greatly diminished the respect that had hitherto been paid to their name in Asia. The changes of ministry in England protracted the negotia tions for peace. The earl of Shelburne succeeded the marquis of Rockingham ; but he was forced to yield to the overwhelming parliamentary strength of Lord North and Mr. Fox, who formed an unexpected coalition. The independence of America was recognised by the signature of preliminaries at Versailles (Nov. 30, 1782) ; little difficulty was found in arranging terms with France and Spain ; but the English wished to gain some compensation for their losses from Holland, and this circumstance occasioned a delay in the final arrangement of the treaty. No war of modern times has produced such important conse quences as that which led to the establishment of the American republic. A state of Europeans, unconnected with the political system of Europe, taking an active share in the general commerce of the world, liberated by its position from the necessity of maintaining a standing army, or meddling in cabinet policy, was certain to increase rapidly in wealth and power. The vast tracts of valuable but unoccupied land belonging to the United States, invited hosts of emigrants from every part of Europe, and their wants encouraged an active commerce. But the Americans wanted capital, and they traded most with that country which gave the longest credit; the commerce with"], [335, "321 THE AMERICAN WAR. England, instead of being destroyed by the war of independence, increased most rapidly, and English trade was never more prosperous than in the period that succeeded the loss of the colonies ; its progress was accelerated by the sudden decline of the trade of Holland, the greater part of which, we might almost say the whole, passed into the hands of the English. The Canadas and Nova Scotia were retained by England, and they shared in the rising prosperity of America ; the West India islands, emancipated from unwise commercial restrictions, were rapidly improving; but several negro insurrections, and destructive hurricanes, crushed for a season the hope of the advantages that had been expected from these possessions. Section IV. \u2014 The British Empire in India. The British empire in India was, as we have already stated, founded on the ruins of the empire of Delhi. The French were the first who aimed at acquiring sovereignty by interfering in the contests of the local governors who had established their independence : they gained a decided superiority in the Carnatic, and on the Coromandel coast, until the naval supre macy of England, in the seven years' war, intercepted their communications, and enabled their rivals to seize all their settlements. It was soon discovered that Coromandel cost more than it was worth, and that the territorial acquisitions most desirable were the countries round the Ganges. Under the government of Lord Clive, the English obtained the sove reignty of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, on the condition of paying twelve lacs of rupees annually to the emperor of Delhi. No sooner had the company acquired the sovereignty of this rich and opulent country, than an opposition of interest arose between the directors at home and their officers in India. The former were anxious to augment their commercial dividends by the territorial revenues, the latter were as obstinate in applying the surplus income to their own advantage. The want of control over the subordinate authorities in India led to most calamitous results ; the officers of the company established monopolies in P3"], [336, "322 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. all the principal branches of domestic trade, rendered property insecure, by arbitrarily changing the tenure of land, and per verted the administration of justice to protect their avarice. The injustice with which the native princes were treated, roused a formidable enemy to the English in Hyder Ali, sultan of Mysore ; and had he been supported by European aid as effectively as he might have been, the company's empire in Hindustan would soon have ended. Some improvements were made in 1 774, by concentrating the power of the three presi dencies in the governor-general and council of Bengal, and the establishment of a supreme court of judicature. But Warren Hastings, the first governor-general, by a series of oppressions and extortions, provoked a second war with Hyder and the Mahratta states, the general results of which have been stated in the preceding chapter. Notwithstanding the fortunate termination of the Mysorean and Mahratta wars, and the extension of the company's territory in Bengal, by the capture of Negapatam from the Dutch, the aspect of affairs was very gloomy and threatening. All the exac tions of the company did not enable it to fulfil its engagements w-ith the government ; and its affairs were considered as fast ap proaching bankruptcy. It had also been found very inconvenient to have a mercantile association existing as a state within the state, and all parties agreed that the company ought to be placed more directly under the control of the government. Under the administration of the marquis of Rockingham, Mr. Fox had taken the lead in arranging the affairs of Ireland. That country had been left unprotected during the late war; the inhabitants, menaced by invasion, armed in their own defence, and the volunteers thus raised, resolved, while they had the power, to secure the legislative independence of their country. The prudence of their leaders averted the horrors of a civil war, which would probably have ended in the separation of the islands, but they could not long have restrained the impatience of their followers, had not the Rockingham adminis tration showed early its desire to comply with their demands. The legislative independence of Ireland was acknowledged (a. v. 1782), and a federal union of the two governments"], [337, "323 THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN INDIA. arranged, which promised to produce permanent advantages to both countries. His success in Ireland induced Mr. Fox to prepare a measure for regulating the complicated affairs of India ; and a bill was introduced, on whose success he staked the existence of the coalition ministry. The principle of Mr. Fox's measure was to place the whole civil and military government of India under a board of nine members, chosen for four years, and not removable without an address from either house of parliament. Such a board would manifestly be an independent authority in the state ; and it was said that its design was to make the power of a party rival that of the king. When the bill had passed the Commons, his majesty, through Earl Temple, intimated to the peers his hostility to the measure, and the Lords rejected it by a considerable majority. A new ministry was formed under the auspices of Mr. Pitt, second son to the great earl of Chatham ; and as it was impossible to resist the strength of the coalition in the House of Commons, the parliament was dissolved at the earliest moment that the state of public business would permit (a. d. 1784). The success of this measure surpassed the expectations of the new minister ; the nation had been disgusted by the coalition of parties, that had been so long and so bitterly opposed to each other as those of Mr. Fox and Lord North, their friends were n most places beaten by the supporters of the new cabinet; and Mr. Pitt found himself firmly established in the plenitude of power. A new bill was framed for the government of India, which trans ferred to the crown the influence which Mr. Fox had designed to entrust to parliamentary commissioners ; but some share of power, and the whole management of commercial affairs, was allowed to remain with the court of directors. The most important branch of commerce monopolized by the company was the tea trade with China, and this was thrown completely into their hands, by a reduction of the duty, which removed all temptation to smuggling. This change in the government of India was followed by the memorable impeachment of Mr. Hastings, whose trial lasted several years. It ended in the acquittal of that gentleman, at least of intentional error ; but his fortune and his health were"], [338, "324 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. ruined by the protracted prosecution. A wise selection of rulers greatly improved the condition of the British empire in India ; under the administration of Lord Cornwallis, the situation of the natives was greatly ameliorated ; but the seeds of corruption, arising from ancient misgovernment and internal wars, could not be wholly eradicated. The great extension of the British colonies gave a fresh stimulus to the spirit of maritime discovery, and the English penetrated into the remotest seas, stopping only where nature had interposed impenetrable barriers of ice. The three voyages of Captain Cook awakened a spirit of enterprise scarcely inferior to that which had been roused by the discoveries of Columbus. The islands of the South Pacific Ocean became soon as well known as those of the Mediterranean Sea, and their natural productions srieedily formed articles of trade. Cook himself suggested the expediency of forming a settlement on the coast of New Holland ; in less than half a century this colony has risen into great importance as an agricultural community; it promises, at no very distant day, to outgrow the fostering care of the mother country, to afford her a rich reward, and become one of her most flourishing descendants. From the period of Mr. Pitt's accession to power, until the commencement of the French revolution, there was little beyond the strife of parties remarkable in the domestic history of Eng land. The illness of the king (a. d. 1787), gave indeed alarming proof that the federal union of the English and Irish legislatures was by no means sufficient to secure the permanent connexion of the two countries ; for, while the British parliament adopted a restricted regency, the Irish offered the entire royal power to the prince of Wales. The speedy recovery of the king averted the evils that might have resulted from so marked a discrepancy, but from that time Mr. Pitt seems to have determined on his plan for uniting the two legislatures. The chief parliamentary struggles were for a repeal of the disqualifying laws that affected the Dissenters, and the abolition of the infamous Slave Trade ; but the success of both these measures was reserved for later times."], [339, "REFORMS OF THE EMPEROR JOSEPH. 325 Section V. \u2014 History of Europe, from the end of the American War to the commencement of the French Revolution. During the progress of the American war a gradual improve ment in the science of government began to be manifested in the European states. Many of the German princes began to moderate the stern exercise of their despotic authority, to reform their expenditure and military establishments, and to adopt new institutions suited to the advanced state of civilization. The emperor Joseph was the most enterprising of the royal reformers; his measures for regulating the Church involved him in a contest with Pope Pius VI., who hated and dreaded innovation, and was bigotedly attached to the ancient pretensions of the Romish See. Persuaded that his personal influence would be sufficient to dissuade Joseph from pursuing his course of change, the pontiff undertook an expensive journey to Vienna, but the emperor only gave him an abundance of compliments, and persevered in his resolutions. His failure covered the pontiff with ridicule, especially as he had to endure similar disappoint ments in his negotiations with the courts of Russia and Prussia. Joseph was willing to join the empress Catherine in the dismem berment of Turkey, and permitted that princess to seize the Crimea; but the principal Western powers still dreaded the aggrandizement of Austria, and the threat of their confederacy saved the Ottoman empire. The king of Prussia was foremost in checking the encroachments of the emperor; he secretly instigated the Dutch to refuse the free navigation of the Scheldt to the ships of the Austrian Netherlands, and he planned a confederacy for maintaining the integrity of the Germanic states. Frederic died when he had completed the consolidation of a kingdom which his conquests had nearly doubled (a. d. 1786); he was succeeded by his nephew Frederic William, whose attention was early directed to the affairs of Holland. The success of the Americans induced many of the Dutch to aim at restoring their old republican constitution, and abridging or destroying the power of the stadtholder, which had become in all but name monarchical. The French secretly encouraged the opponents of the prince of Orange, hoping to obtain from"], [340, "326 the age of revolutions. the popular party an addition to their East Indian colonies, or at least such a union of interests as would counterpoise British ascendancy in Asia ; but the new king of Prussia, whose sister was married to the stadtholder, resolved to prevent any change, and the English ambassador vigorously exerted himself to coun teract the intrigues of the French. An insult offered to the princess of Orange brought matters to a crisis ; Frederic William immediately sent an army to redress his sister's wrongs, the republicans, deserted by France, made but a feeble resistance, and the stadtholder was restored to all his former authority. The disordered state of the French finances was the cause of this desertion of their party by the ministers of Louis ; through mere jealousy of England, they had involved their country in the American war, and had thus increased the confusion in which the prodigality of the preceding reign had sunk the treasury. Minister after minister had attempted to palliate the evil, but M. de Calonne, who owed his elevation to the unwise partiality of the queen, Marie Antoinette, aggravated the disorder by a series of measures formed without prudence, and supported with obstinacy. Opposed by the parliaments, Calonne recom mended the king to convene an assembly of the Notables, or persons selected from the privileged orders (a. d. 1787) ; but these orders had hitherto paid far less than their fair proportion of the imposts, and an equitable system of taxation could not be expected from such an interested body. Nccker, a Swiss banker, who had been for a short time the French minister of finance, joined in the opposition to Calonne, and it must be confessed that he demonstrated the total inadequacy of the proposed measures to remedy the decline of public credit. Louis dismissed Calonne, but he would not gratify his subjects by recalling Necker to the cabinet ; and he dismissed the Notables, whose uncomplying disposition rendered all hopes of aid from that assembly fruitless. But the derangement of the finances was not the only evil that the French court suffered from its interference in the American war ; the officers and soldiers who had fought for liberty in one hemisphere became dissatisfied with despotism in the other. A general desire for the establishment of a free constitution, like"], [341, "327 ABOLITION OF TORTURE. that of England, was diffused through the nation, and some more ardent spirits began to speculate on a republic. The connexion of the court with Austria was the cause of much secret discontent ; the decline of the influence and the power of France was traced to its unfortunate alliance with the court of Vienna during the seven years' war, and the queen, who was naturally inclined to perpetuate this unpopular union, became an object of suspicion and dislike. It was mortifying to find that France no longer held the balance of power on the con tinent ; that she could not save Turkey from the aggressions of the ambitious Catherine, nor protect the republican party in Holland from punishment for acts done in her service. While France was thus disturbed, the progress of reform in other states was unimpeded ; the rulers of Spain and Portugal improved their kingdoms by institutions for the protection of trade, and by placing checks on the exorbitant powers of the clergy. They joined in an effort to chastise the piratical powers in the Mediterranean, but the strength of the Algerine capital frustrated the attempt. The emperor Joseph and his brother Leopold, grand duke of Tuscany, distinguished themselves by enacting new and salutary codes of law ; they abolished the use of torture to extort confessions, and they greatly limited the number of offences to which the penalty of death was affixed. Their example was followed by the empress Catherine, whose code was the greatest blessing that her glorious reign conferred on Russia ; and even the sultan evinced a desire to improve the institutions of Turkey. But the course of events in France soon inspired all the sovereigns of Europe with a horror of innovation. After the dismissal of the Notables, M. de Brienne, archbishop of Toulouse, had become minister of finance, and he soon involved himself in a dispute with the parliaments, by refusing to produce the accounts, w-hich they insisted on examining before registering any new edicts of taxation. The great object of the parliament was to maintain the immunities of the privileged orders; the minister justly recommended a less partial system, when his opponents, yielding to temporary irritation, demanded the con vocation of the States-General. The nobles and the clergy joined"], [342, "328 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. in the demand, without any expectation of its being regarded, but merely to annoy the court ; the people, however, took up the matter in earnest, and determined to enforce compliance. Various schemes were tried by the archbishop to overcome this powerful opposition, but all his plans were disconcerted by the obstinacy of the parliaments, and the king, finding every expe dient fail, consented to recall Necker (a. d. 1788). At the same time, a solemn promise was given for the speedy assembly of the States-General, a body that had not been convened since the year 1614. Before the assembling of this legislative body, it was necessary to determine the number of representatives that should be sent by each of the three orders, the nobles, the clergy, and the people ; the majority of the Notables voted that an equal number of deputies should be sent by the respective classes, but it was subsequently determined that the representatives of the third estate should equal in number those of the nobles and clergy conjoined. The king declared that the three estates should form separate chambers, but this very important matter was not so definitely fixed as to prevent future discussion. On the 5th of May, 1789, the States-General met at Versailles, and the democratic party, confident in its strength, demanded that the three orders should sit and vote together. After a short struggle, the court was compelled to concede this vital point, and the united bodies took the name of the National Assembly. A spirit of insubordination began to appear in Paris, caused in some degree by the pressure of famine ; artful and ambitious men fanned the rising flame, and directed the popular indignation against the king and his family. The arms in the Hospital of Invalids were seized by the mob, and the insurgents immediately proceeded to attack the Bastile, or state-prison of Paris. After a brief resistance, the governor, having an insufficient garrison, capitulated, but the conditions were not observed by the infuriate multitude ; the governor was torn to pieces, and many of the soldiers inhumanly massacred. Louis, greatly alarmed, tried by every means to conciliate his subjects, he removed the regular troops from Paris and Versailles, entrusting the defence of the capital to a body of civic militia, called the National"], [343, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 329 Guards. The command of this new force was entrusted to the marquis de la Fayette, who had acquired great popularity by his liberal sentiments, and his services to the cause of freedom in the American war. But all the king's concessions failed to conciliate the democratic, or rather, as we may henceforth call it, the republican party ; relying on the support of the Parisian populace, the leaders of this band resolved that the legislature should be removed to the capital, and a mob was secretly insti gated to make the demand. A crowd of the lowest rabble, accompanied by some of the national guards, proceeded to Versailles, the palace was violently entered, several of its defenders slain, and the king compelled instantly to set out for Paris, a prisoner in the hands of a licentious crowd, whose insults and indecencies were revolting to human nature. This atrocious outrage may fairly be regarded as the com mencement of the French Revolution; thenceforth the royal authority was an empty name, and all the ancient forms of government set aside ; visionaries indulged in speculations on a new order of things, ardent patriots hoped to establish a consti tution more perfect than the world had yet witnessed, but the base and the depraved sought to gain their own selfish ends by stimulating popular violence ; and the last class was the only one whose expectations were realized. Section V. \u2014 The French Revolution. From the moment that Louis XVI. was brought a prisoner to his capital, the ancient constitution of France was overthrown ; the monarchy continued to exist only in name, and the abolition of feudal rights, the extinction of hereditary titles, and the secularization of ecclesiastical property, established popular sove reignty on the ruins of the ancient structure. Several German princes, who had possessions in Alsace, protested against these violent changes, but the popular rulers would not listen to any proposal of a compromise, and thus the leaders of the revolution were embroiled with the empire in the very outset of their"], [344, "330 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. career. A club, called from its place of meeting the Jacobin Association, was formed by the leading democrats, and from this body denunciations were issued against all who were believed favourable to the ancient institutions of the country. Through the machinations of the jacobins, popular hatred was directed against the court, and violent tumults excited in various parts of France. Infinitely more dangerous to the repose of Europe were the emigrations of the nobles, who were dissatisfied with the revolution ; instead of remaining at home and organiz ing a constitutional resistance, they resolved to seek the restora tion of the old government, with all its abuses, by the intervention of foreign powers. A meeting and conference took place at Pilnitz, between the emperor of Germany, the king of Prussia, and the elector of Saxony ; the count d'Artois, brother to the French monarch, and head of the emigrants, came uninvited, and he engaged the sovereigns to issue a vague declaration in favour of the rights of kings. Louis, wearied by the violence of the jacobins, the licentiousness of the Parisian mob, and the disappointments he was daily forced to meet, resolved to escape from the captivity in which he was detained, and seek refuge on the frontiers. He fled from Paris, accompanied by his queen and children, but was unfortunately discovered at Varennes, seized, and brought back a prisoner to his capital. This failure exposed the royal family to suspicions of which the jacobins took advantage ; but the more moderate of the patriots were for a time sufficiently powerful to restrain their violence ; and after a long deliberation, they prepared a constitutional code, which was tendered to the king for acceptance. The readiness with which Louis assented to this instrument of government, and his frank communication of his satisfaction with the arrangement to his ambassadors at the different European courts, for a time restored his popularity. The emperor Leopold notified to the other powers that all danger of war was averted, and the external and internal tranquillity of France seemed to be assured. But the constitution, thus established, could not be permanent; it was itself defective ; and the minds of the French people, once animated by the desire of change, could not rest satisfied with any fixed form of government. The assembly by which it had"], [345, "THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 331 been framed was dissolved, and a new legislative body chosen, according to the system recently established, and in this assembly the more violent partisans of democracy had more influence than in the preceding. It was their great object to involve the kingdom in foreign war ; and the suspicious preceedings of the emigrants, their intrigues in the German courts, and the avowed determination of the emperor to maintain the feudal rights of the German princes in Alsace, furnished plausible pretexts for the commencement of hostilities. The death of the emperor Leopold accelerated a rupture ; his successor, Francis II., con tinued to make alarming military preparations, and on his refusal to give any satisfactory explanation, Louis was compelled to declare war against him (a.d. 1792). But the strife of parties in the royal cabinet and the National Assembly, led to such confusion in the councils of the French, that their armies, though superior in number, were defeated with loss and disgrace ; while the jacobins, whose intrigues were the real cause of these misfortunes, ascribed them to royalist treachery, and to the influence that Austrian councils possessed over the court from its connexion with the queen. These malignant slanders, indus triously circulated, and generally believed, stimulated the Parisian mob to disgraceful acts of violence and disorder, against which La Fayette and the friends of rational liberty protested in vain. A new incident gave fresh strength to the jacobin party; Frederic William, king of Prussia, engaged to co-operate w-ith the emperor Francis to restore the royal authority in France, their united forces were placed under the command of the duke of Brunswick ; and this prince issued a sanguinary and insulting manifesto, which had the effect of uniting all the French factions in the defence of their common country. A declaration issued soon after by the emigrant brothers and relatives of Louis, in which the revolution was bitterly con demned, proved even more injurious to the unfortunate king ; scarcely did intelligence of the publication reach Paris, when the palace was attacked by an infuriate mob, the Swiss guards ruthlessly massacred, and Louis, with his family, forced to seek shelter in the hall of the National Assembly. The deputies"], [346, "332 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. protected his person, but they suspended his regal functions, and committed him a prisoner to a building called the Temple, from having been once a monastery of the knights of that order. La Fayette was equally surprised and indignant at these outrages of the jacobins ; he tried to keep the army firm in its allegiance ; but wanting either the energy or the interest neces- sary at such a crisis, he fled into the Netherlands, when he was seized and imprisoned by the Austrians for his former opposition to the royal power. He was succeeded in the command of the army by Dumouriez, who made energetic preparations to resist the coming invasion. Confident in their strength, the allied armies entered France with the proudest anticipations, and their rapid progress in the beginning seemed to promise the most decisive results. To diminish the number of their internal enemies, Robespierre, Murat, and other chiefs of the jacobins, planned the massacre of all the suspected persons confined in the prisons of Paris, and this diabolical plot was executed by the licentious populace. Similar horrors were perpetrated in other parts of France ; a reign of terror was established, and no man dared to remonstrate against these shocking excesses. In the mean time the invaders had met with unexpected reverses ; trusting to the representations of the emigrants, that the revo- lution had been the work of a few agitators, not of the nation, and that there was a general reaction in favour of royalty, the allies had advanced, without providing adequate stores, and when they received a check at Valmy, their camp was attacked by famine and disease ; they were soon compelled to retreat, and to purchase an inglorious security by resigning the fortresses they had occupied. Dumouriez iiursued the Austrians into the Netherlands, and gained a decisive victory, which encouraged the Belgians to throw off the imperial yoke ; Flanders and Brabant were soon in possession of the victors, and their arms had made considerable progress in the reduction of Luxemburg. The Convention, as the National Assembly began to be called, having made their own country a republic, resolved to extend the revolution into other states ; they offered their alliance to every nation that desired to recover its liberties, and they ordered the ancient constitutions of all the countries occupied by"], [347, "333 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. French troops to be subverted. As the republican arms had conquered Savoy, and were fast gaining ground in Germany, the adoption of such a decree was virtually a declaration of war against all the kings of Europe. The jacobins, aided by the Parisian mob, and still more by the cowardice and indecision of their opponents, were now masters of the Convention, and the first use they made of their power was to bring the unfortunate king to trial, on the ridiculous charge of his having engaged in a conspiracy for the subversion of freedom. Louis defended himself with great spirit and energy, but his judges were predetermined on his conviction : six hundred and eighty-three deputies pronounced him guilty of treason against the sovereignty of the -nation, while there were only thirty-seven who took a more favourable view of his conduct. A motion for an appeal to the people was rejected ; but the sentence of death was passed by a very inconsiderable majority, and this probably induced the jacobins to hasten the execution. On the 21st of January, 1793, the unfortunate Louis was guillotined in his capital city; and the severity of his fate was aggravated by the insults of his cruel executioners. This judicial murder excited general indignation throughout Europe ; Chauvelin, the French ambassador, was dismissed from the British court, and many persons in England, who had hitherto applauded the efforts of the French people, became vehement opposers of revolutionary principles. A similar result was produced in Holland, where the government had been justly alarmed by the progress of the French in the Netherlands. The Convention did not wait to be attacked ; a vote was passed that the republic was at war with the king of England and the stadtholder of Holland, by which artful phraseology it was intended to draw a marked distinction between the sovereign and the people of both countries. Spain was soon after added to the enemies of France, and the new republic had to contend against a coalition of all the leading powers of Europe. None of the allies threatened more loudly than the empress Catherine ; she had just concluded a successful war against Turkey, in which her general Suwaroff had won a large addition of territory for his mistress ; and the power of Russia in the Black Sea was"], [348, "334 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. secured ; she had also triumphed over the king of Sweden, more, however, by the insubordination of her rival's officers than by the valour of her own troops. Poland was in every thing but name subjected to Russia, and the empress was secretly maturing a plan to blot that country from the list of nations. As the coalition against the French republic was regarded as a war in defence of the rights of kings, it was intended that a king should be placed at the head of the allied armies ; and Gustavus, who had subverted the free constitution of Sweden offered his services ; but while he was preparing for the expedition, a con spiracy was formed against him by his discontented nobles, and he was murdered at a masked ball by Ankarstrom, an officer who believed himself personally injured by the king (1792). After the death of Gustavus, the insincerity of Catherine became more manifest, she issued violent proclamations against the French, but carefully abstained from active hostility- ; indeed it was manifestly her purpose to involve the continental powers in a war, which would prevent them from watching too jealously the aggrandizement of Russia. The English and Prussians, deeming the defence of Holland a matter of primary importance, combined to check the progress of Dumouriez, who had overrun Dutch Brabant, with little opposition (1793). But the progress of the Austrians, on the side of Germany, stopped the French in their career of conquest. Dumouriez quitted Holland to defend Louvain, but he suffered a complete defeat at Neer-winden, by which his soldiers were so discouraged, that they deserted in great numbers. Dumouriez, finding himself suspected by the two great parties which divided the republic, and weary of the disorganized state of the French government, entered into negotiations with the allied generals, and arrested the deputies sent by the Convention to watch his movements. But the army did not share the anti-revolutionary feelings of Dumouriez, and he was forced to seek shelter in the Austrian camp. Custine, the successor of Dumouriez, was unable to check the progress of the allied armies ; being reinforced by a British forca under the duke of York, they captured the important fortress of Valenciennes, and seemed to have opened a way to Paris. The"], [349, "335 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. revolutionary government punished Custine's failure by a public execution, and employed the terrors of the guillotine as an incen tive to patriotism. But the separation of the allied forces was more servicable to the cause of the Convention than the cruelties of the \" Committee of Public Safety,\" to which the supreme power in France was intrusted. Austria, Prussia, and England, had separate interests, in the pursuit of which the common cause wag forgotten ; the imperialists laid siege to Le Quesnoi, while the English and Dutch proceeded to invest Dunkirk. The duke of York attacked Dunkirk with great spirit, but not receiving the support, by sea, that he had expected, and the Hanoverian force that covered his operations having been routed by Houchard, he was obliged to raise the siege and abandon the greater portion of his artillery and military stores. The Austrians were for a time more successful, but when Roche, the defender of Dunkirk, was promoted to the command of the republican armies, they were driven from all their conquests in Alsace, and forced to seek shelter within the imperial frontiers. In Italy, the French maintained their hold of Savoy, but they experienced some severe reverses on the Spanish frontier. The revolutionary excitement produced the most dreadful effects beyond the Atlantic ; the coloured population in the French division of St. Domingo took arms to force the whites to grant them equal privileges; their claims were supported by the three deputies sent by the Convention to regulate the affairs of the colony, the negroes were seduced, by offers of liberty, to revolt against their masters, and St. Domingo, which had been one of the most flourishing islands in the West Indies, was devastated by a civil war, scarcely to be paralleled for its sanguinary fury and the wanton destruction of life and property. The wars of Southern and Western Europe permitted CatheT rine of Russia to accomplish the favourite object of her policy, the dismemberment of Poland. Austria and Prussia joined in this iniquitous scheme, for the purpose of sharing the plunder, but the Poles made a gallant struggle to maintain their independence. Kosciusko, who had served in America, under Washington, was the chief of the patriots, and his"], [350, "336 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. heroic efforts protracted a struggle which from the first was hopeless. Kosciusko, severely wounded, fell into the hands of his enemies, Warsaw was stormed by the brutal Suwaroff, and the kingdom of Poland, erased from the list of nations, was divided between the three confederates (1795). The king of Prussia, more anxious to secure his new acquisitions than to support the objects of the coalition, made peace with the French, and offered to mediate between the republic and Austria. Scarcely had the Austrians been driven from France, when that country was convulsed by civil war (1793). The jacobins having, by the aid of the Parisian populace, triumphed over the rival faction in the Convention, mercilessly proscribed their political adversaries as traitors, and after a mockery of trial, hurried them to execution. Among the victims to their fury was the unfortunate queen of France, Marie Antoinette, but death was to her not a punishment but a release from suffering. The tyranny of the jacobins provoked formidable insurrections in the south of France, and encouraged the royalists of La Vendee to take up arms in the cause of their church and their king. Nothing could exceed the fury of the jacobins when they heard of these revolts ; severe decrees were passed against the cities which had resisted their authority, but no place was so cruelly punished as Lyons, which had continued for four months in a state of insurrection. After having endured a furious bombardment, it was forced to surrender at discretion ; five deputies, of whom Collot and Fouche were the chief, received a commission from the Convention to punish the Lyonnese revolters by the summary process of military law, and about four thou- sand victims were shot or guillotined after the mockery of trial before this savage tribunal. But, in the midst of their butcheries, the jacobins did not neglect the military defence of their country ; a decree of the Convention declared, that all the French were soldiers, and a levy of the population, en masse, was ordered. To support such numerous armies, private property was seized and paid for in promissory notes, called assignats, whose value was speedily depreciated, a circumstance which ruined public credit in France. Toulon having revolted, an English garrison, strengthened by"], [351, "337 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. Spanish and Neapolitan detachments, occupied that important sea-port. It was soon besieged by the troops of the Convention ; the artillery of the besiegers was directed by a young Corsican, Napoleon Buonaparte, who had risen by his merits from an inferior station. Owing to his exertions, the English soon found the place untenable ; they evacuated Toulon, without loss, after having destroyed the arsenal and shipping, but they abandoned the inhabitants to the fury of the conquerors, who punished their revolt with indiscriminate severity. In the Netherlands and Germany, the French, under Pichc gru and Jourdan, gained many important advantages over the imperialists and their allies; but though many battles were fought, nothing of any consequence was effected in the early part of the campaign (1794). A more important event was the downfall of the sanguinary faction which had so long deluged France with the blood of its best citizens ; Robespierre's enormi ties were too numerous and too shocking to be borne, even by many of the jacobin party ; a conspiracy was formed against him ; the Convention was induced to resume its authority, and order his arrest, and after a brief struggle, he and his accomplices were hurried before the revolutionary tribunal, which they had themselves organized, and sent to the scaffold. This revolution did not produce the beneficial results that had been expected ; Robespierre's successors were little better than himself, and they were confirmed in their hostility to Britain by the recent defeat of their navy. Lord Howe, who had been distinguished as a naval commander in the two preceding wars, encountered a French fleet of rather superior force (June 1st), and having broke the enemy's line, took six ships of war and sunk two. This success revived the declining spirits of the English nation, discourao-ed by the ill-success of the war in Holland. Corsica was soon after annexed to the dominions of England, but the French were victorious on the Spanish frontier, and Holland was completely subdued by Pichegru and Moreau. The prince of Orange and the English forces escaped by sea ; the Dutch abolished the office of stadtholder, and adopted a new form of government, similar to that of the French republic. If there were any in Holland who expected to derive advantage from <i"], [352, "338 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. this revolution, they were grievously disappointed ; the French despised their new confederates, and treated them as a conquered people, while the English seized the colonies and destroyed the remains of the once unparalleled commerce of Holland. The alarm which the French revolution excited in England, led the government to prosecute some enthusiastic advocates of reform in parliament for high treason ; three of them were brought to trial and acquitted, upon which the prosecutions of the others were abandoned. There were few in the country anxious to make a change in the established institutions, the crimes and follies of the French jacobins had rendered innovation unpopular, and many who had hitherto been in opposition to the court tendered their aid to the minister; the most remark able of these converts was the eloquent Burke, whose denuncia tions of French principles produced a powerful effect on the national mind. The dismemberment of Poland, and the desertion of the coalition by the king of Prussia, gave great dissatisfaction to the British parliament, and the character of our faithless ally was made the theme of severe and not unmerited censure. He had accepted a large subsidy from England, and employed the money, lavishly granted him, against the Polanders instead of the French. But the defection of Prussia did not dishearten the English or the Austrians, who w-ere encouraged to continue the war by the distracted state of France. In Paris, the Conven- tion, partially succeeded in throwing off the yoke of the jacobins, but the city was frequently endangered by their machinations and the insurrections of the ferocious populace which supported them. The royalist war was renewed in La Vendee, and the South of France continued discontented. But the allies profited little by these commotions : the Spaniards, completely humbled, were forced to make peace with the republicans ; the Austrians barely maintained their ground in Italy, and success was evenly balanced on the side of Germany. But Great Britain main tained its supremacy at sea ; Admiral Cornwallis compelled a fleet of very superior force to retire, and Lord Bridport, with ten sail of the line, attacked twelve of the enemy, three of which were compelled to strike their colours. The French"], [353, "THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 339 were deprived of Martinique, Guadaloupe, and St. Lucie, in the West Indies, and their reluctant allies, the Dutch, lost their settlements at the Cape of Good Hope, and in the island of Ceylon. The Convention, by an attempt to perpetuate its authority, provoked a formidable insurrection in Paris ; Buonaparte had a considerable share in subduing the revolters, more than two thousand of whom were mercilessly slaughtered. Soon after wards, France had a new constitution, consisting of a legislative assembly, an upper house, called the Council of Ancients, aud a directory of five members intrusted with the executive functions of government. The directors soon began to limit the powers of the legislative body, and the new constitution was found to be a delusion. But an approach had been made to regular government, and the war was carried on with fresh vigour by the Directory (a. d. 1796). Marshals Jourdan and Moreau made successful irruptions into Germany, but they encountered a formidable antogonist in the archduke Charles of Austria. He stopped the invaders in their mid career of victory, completely routed Jourdan at Kornach, and then suddenly marching against Moreau, he nearly succeeded in surprising and overwhelming that general. Moreau's celebrated retreat was more honourable to his abilities than the most brilliant victory ; he led his forces through the Black Forest, from position to position, often compelled to yield his ground, but never thrown into confusion, until he safely crossed the Rhine with all his artillery and baggage. The campaign in Italy, where the French were commanded by Napoleon Buonaparte, was more eventful. The king of Sardinia, completely routed and cut off from his communications with the Austrians, was forced to purchase a dishonourable peace from the republic, by the cession of his most important fortresses. Napoleon then led his forces against the Austrians, forced, but with great loss, a passage over the bridge of Lodi, and gained possession of Milan and the principal cities of Lom bardy. The victors made a harsh use of their triumph, the unfortunate Lombards were treated with great cruelty, the duke of Tuscany was compelled to exclude the English from the port Q2"], [354, "340 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. of Leo-horn, and the pope was forced to purchase the forbearance of the republicans by ceding to them Bologna, and several other towns, paying a heavy ransom, and sending three hundred precious manuscripts and pictures to enrich the national museum at Paris. The dukes of Modena and Parma were subjected to similar exactions, but the king of Naples had providently made a truce with the French before they approached his frontiers. Mantua, the last strong-hold of the Austrians in Italy, was closely besieged, but the court of Vienna made vigorous prepa rations for its relief. Marshal Wurmser twice pushed forward aoainst the French, but was each time defeated with great loss, a calamity owing to his unwisely dividing his forces. Alvinzi, who succeeded to the command of the Austrians, committed the same fault, and was compelled to retire ; Mantua, however, was still obstinately defended, but the garrison ceased to entertain sanguine hopes of success. In the mean time, the Corsicans grew weary of their con nexion with Great Britain, drove the English from the island, and placed themselves under the protection of France. Ireland was exposed to the horrors of an invasion ; a formidable squadron having a large body of troops on board appeared in Bantry Bay. Hoche, who had acquired considerable fame by his suppression of the insurrection in La Vendee, commanded the expedition, and, could he have effected a landing, the safety of the British empire would have been perilled ; but a violent storm dispersed the ships, most of which were subsequently either sunk or captured. The death of the empress Catherine inspired the English minister with a hope of gaining more effective assistance from Russia ; but her successor, the emperor Paul, disregarded all the solicitations addressed to him by the courts of London and Vienna. A new enemy appeared against England ; the Spanish govern ment, always jealous of British naval power, and overawed by the French Directory, entered into alliance with the republic, and began to increase its navy (1797). At this moment, when the existence of England depended on its sailors, a formidable mutiny broke out in the fleet at Spithead, the officers were suspended from their authority and dismissed from their ships ;"], [355, "341 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. the malcontents blockaded the mouth of the Thames, and com mitted several acts of depredation. Fortunately the sailors grew alarmed themselves and hastened to return to their allegiance ; a few of the ringleaders were hanged, but the great body of the revolters was conciliated by an act of amnesty. The war in Italy was not discontinued during the winter ; Alvinzi made a desperate effort to retrieve the fortunes of Austria, but he was again defeated, and Mantua soon capitu lated. Having very severely punished the pope, for his attach ment to the imperial interests, Napoleon resolved to carry the war into the hereditary states of Austria. The territory of Friuli was quickly subdued, and a great part of the Tyrol occupied by the French ; the archduke Charles made a bold defence, but the emperor Francis, terrified by the advance of Hoche and Moreau in Germany, sued for peace, in spite of the remonstrances of his English allies. While the terms of pacifi cation were under discussion, Napoleon subverted the ancient constitutions of Genoa and Venice, and made both republics virtually dependent on France. Spain suffered severely in the war she had so rashly com menced. Admiral Jervis encountered a Spanish fleet of very superior force off Cape St. Vincent, and by a dexterous man\u0153uvre cut off nine of their ships from the line, so that he could engage the rest on more equal terms. Four ships of the line were taken in this brilliant engagement, to the success of which Nelson, who was now commencing his brilliant career, mainly contributed. The Spaniards lost also the valuable island of Trinidad, but an attack on Teneriffe was unsuccessful. The Dutch, too, were punished for their alliance with France. Three ships of the line and four frigates were taken by the British, after an unsuccessful attempt to recover the Cape. But they suffered a more severe loss on their own coast ; an English squadron, commanded by Admiral Duncan, got between their ships and the shore, and took eleven out of fifteen sail of the line. Two of the prizes, however, in consequence of the diffi culties of the navigation, were abandoned. A new revolution in France invested the Directory with supreme power, and their opponents were banished to the"], [356, "342 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. unhealthy swamps of Guiana, where they were treated with great rigour. Negotiations for peace were commenced, but those with England were broken off abruptly by the extravagant demands of the French plenipotentiaries. This did not prevent the conclusion of a treaty between the republic and Austria, when the emperor was remunerated for the loss of Mantua by the cession of Venice, which he meanly accepted, and the frontiers of France were extended to the Rhine. Great Britain was now the only power at war with France, and the Directory prepared a large army for its invasion. This threat produced a noble display of patriotism throughout the country, volunteer associations for defence were formed, and every man was ready- to act as a soldier. But while the British navy rode triumphant in the Channel, the menace of invasion was an idle boast, and Buonaparte only used it as a pretext to cover his ulterior designs. While the French were modelling, at their pleasure, the governments of Italy, Switzerland, and Holland, Napoleon planned an expedition to Egypt, with the hope of rendering the French influence as predominant in the East as it was in Western Europe (1798). Convoyed by afleet, under Admiral Brueys, he sailed first to Malta, which was betrayed by the French knights. A garrison was left to secure the forts of this important island, the rest of the, expedition escaping the vigilance of the English fleet, safely reached Egypt, and having effected a landing, took Alexandria by storm. The Mameluke Beys, who were then masters of the country, led their brilliant cavalry to check the progress of the invaders; but these undisciplined warriors were unable to break the firm squares of the French infantry, and they were almost annihilated in the battle of Embaba. But the hopes inspired by such success were soon dashed by the ruin of the French fleet. After a long search, Admiral Nelson discovered Brueys, in the Bay of Aboukir, and imme diately formed a bold plan of action. He led a part of his fleet between the French and the shore, so as to place his enemies between two fires. The victory was complete, nine sail of the line were captured, L'Oricnt, a ship of uncommon size, blew up with the greater part of her crew ; another ship of the line and a frigate were burned by their respective captains."], [357, "343 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. But Great Britain was not equally fortunate in other quarters, an armament sent against the Belgic coast signally failed, and the island of St. Domingo was evacuated by the British troops. Ireland was distracted by an insurrection, planned by some enthusiastic admirers of French principles, but put into execution by an ignorant peasantry, whose excesses their leaders were unable to control. Many acts of atrocity were committed by the insurgents, and the conduct of the royal army was frequently very disgraceful. The insurrection was finally quelled ; but scarcely was tranquillity restored, when a small party of French landed in Connaught, and through the cowardice of the troops first sent to oppose them, penetrated into the heart of the country. Lord Cornwallis, who had just been appointed lord lieutenant, soon overtook the French, and forced them to surrender. Judi ciously tempering severity with clemency, he conciliated the discontented ; and Sir John Warren, by capturing the greater part of a French fleet, averted the dangers of a future invasion. The victory of Nelson at the Nile produced a powerful effect throughout Europe. The sultan made preparations for a vigorous defence of his dominions ; the Russians sent an arma ment into the Mediterranean, and captured the Ionian Islands, which the French had wrested from the Venetians; the king of Naples took arms to recover the Roman territories for the pope ; and the emperor of Austria yielded to the suggestions of Mr. Pitt, and commenced hostilities. The French were not daunted by this powerful coalition, they easily repelled the Neapolitans, but they found a more formid able foe in the Russians, who entered Italy under the command of Suwaroff, and being there joined by the Austrians, gained several important advantages in spite of Marshals Moreau and Macdonald. But these successes were so dearly purchased, that the allies resolved to try a new plan of operations. Suwaroff undertook to drive the French from Switzerland; Kray and Melas were to direct the Piedmontese and Austrian troops in Italy ; while the archduke Charles protected Germany with all the forces of the empire. Victory in general favoured the allied powers ; the French lost all their posts in Italy except Genoa, and that was closely besieged ; Suwaroff made rapid progress"], [358, "344 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. in Switzerland; and in Germany the French arms suffered several but not very important reverses. In the mean time Napoleon invaded Syria ; but being foiled at Acre, chiefly through the heroic exertions of Sir Sydney Smith, he returned to Egypt, and having provided for the security of that country, secretly embarked for France. He escaped the vigilance of the English cruisers, and arrived at Paris just as the Directory was indulging in extravagant joy for the defeat of the joint invasion of Holland by the English and Russians. It had been confidently asserted that the Dutch were anxious to throw off the yoke of France, but these representations were proved to be fallacious ; and the duke of York, who commanded the English forces, was compelled to purchase a safe retreat by restoring eight thousand French prisoners without ransom or exchange. Buonaparte soon perceived that the French people had grown weary of the Directory ; trusting to his popularity with the army, he drove the legislative council from their chamber at the point of the bayonet, and formed a new constitution, by which the executive power was entrusted to three consuls, of whom he was the chief. The First Consul, in every thing but name a monarch, attempted to commence negotiations, the English ministers repulsed him rather harshly, and preparations were made for a decisive campaign. An important and necessary change was made in the consti- tution of the British empire (a. d. 1800). Some difficulties had arisen from the existence of indejjendent legislatures in England and Ireland ; the two parliaments had abeady divided differently on the important question of the regency, and there was reason to fear that some future discrepancy might lead to the dismem- berment of the empire. To prevent such an evil, it was resolved that the two legislatures should form one imperial parliament, and the terms of union were warmly canvassed in both countries. The measure was' very unpopular in Ireland, and when first proposed, was rejected by the parliament ; but, during the recess, the minister found means to increase the number of his sup- porters, and in the following session the Act of Union was passed by considerable majorities. It was expected that the First Consul would attempt the"], [359, "THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. 345 invasion of England or Ireland, but Napoleon was too well aware of his naval weakness to undertake such a hazardous enterprise. He formed a daring plan of a campaign in Italy, and led his army like Hannibal over the Alps. The Austrians could scarcely have been more surprised if an army had fallen from the clouds, than they were by the appearance of the French columns descending from Mount St. Bernard ; but, encouraged by their recent acquisition of Genoa, they prepared to make a vigorous resistance. The battle of Montebello, in which the French had the advantage, was the prelude to the decisive battle of Marenoo. The Austrians commenced the fight with unusual spirit ; both wings of their opponents were beaten, and the centre shaken, but some fresh divisions arriving to the support of the French at the last moment of the crisis, Napoleon pierced the lines of the imperialists, which were too much extended, and Murat's furious charge completed the rout of the Austrians. So disheartened was the imperial general Melas, that he pur chased a truce by resigning Genoa, and the principal fortresses in Piedmont and the Milanese, to the conquerors. The influence of the British cabinet, and some slight successes in Germany, induced the emperor Francis to continue the war ; but his rising hopes were crushed by the battle of Hohenlinden, in which the French and Bavarians under Moreau completely defeated the imperialists, and opened a passage into Upper Austria. The emperor, alarmed for his hereditary dominions, consented to a truce, and this was soon followed by the treaty of Luneville, which annihilated for a season the Austrian influence in Italy. Scarcely had Great Britain lost one ally when she was threatened with the active hostility of another. The Russian emperor, Paul, had been chosen patron of the order of St. John of Jerusalem; and when the English, after having reduced Malta by blockade, refused to restore the island to the degenerate knights, the chivalrous potentate ordered the British ships in the Russian ports to be detained, and prevailed upon Sweden and Denmark to unite with him in an armed neutrality (1801). In the mean time, Mr. Pitt, who had so long presided over the councils of Great Britain, resigned his office as premier. When he was ur\u00b0ing forward the great measure of the Union with Q3"], [360, "346 THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS. Ireland, he had endeavoured to conciliate the catholics of that country by a promise of his aid in procuring a repeal of the laws which excluded them from parliament and office ; but the king's repugnance to catholic emancipation was invincible, and Mr. Pitt retired from the cabinet. Mr. Addington, his successor, had scarcely been installed, when the gratifying intelligence was received of a great triumph obtained by the British navy in the Baltic. When Mr. Pitt received intelligence of the armed neutrality, he sent a large fleet into the northern seas, under the command of Sir Hyde Parker and Lord Nelson. The latter, with twelve sail of the line and some small vessels, attacked the Danish fleet, moored in a formidable position, before their capital, and, after a desperate contest, took or destroyed every Danish ship that had a share in the engagement. The Danes were humbled by this loss, but they were still more disheartened by the death of the Russian emperor Paul, who was the founder and head of the northern confederacy. This jiotentate's inca pacity provoked the indignation of the nobles and the people, and he was murdered by a party of conspirators, who placed his son Alexander upon the throne. The young prince concluded a treaty with the British on equitable terms, and the other northern powers imitated his example. A British army, under Sir Ralph Abercrombie, had been sent to drive the French from Egypt, and it succeeded in this object, but with the loss of its gallant commander. Some naval enter prises were less successful ; and as there was now a stable govern ment in France, the English minister consented to commence negotiations for peace. The terms were soon arranged ; France retained her acquisitions in Germany and the Netherlands, and her supremacy in Holland, Switzerland, and Italy. England consented to resign Malta to the knights, to make the Ionian Islands an independent republic, and to restore all her colonial conquests except Ceylon and Trinidad. The treaty was signed at Amiens, and for a short time Europe was deceived with a hope of continued tranquillity. During this war the maritime and commercial supremacy of England had been completely established, and her colonial empire in India extended and secured. When the French"], [361, "THE FRENCH REVOLUTION; 347 invaded Egypt, Tippoo, the sultan of Mj-sore, inheriting his father's hostility to the English, meditated an attack on the company's territories, but ho was anticipated by the vigour of the carl of Mornington, the governor-general, who, instead of waiting for an attack, invaded Mysore. Seringapatam, Tippoo's capital, was taken by storm, and that unfortunate prince fell in the assault. This conquest made the British power supreme in Southern India, and led to the establishment of the company's paramount authority over the whole peninsula of Hindustan. France had gained a vast accession of territory, but the freedom which the French had taken arms to defend was no more. The revolution, whose progress had been so strongly marked by savage crime and cruel suffering, was now fast finding its consummation in a military despotism, more arbitrary and crushing than the iron rule even of the feudal monarchs ; but the French, weary of the many vicissitudes that their government had undergone, submitted to a change that promised future stability, and consoled themselves with dreams of glory for the loss of freedom."], [362, "348 CHAPTER VIIL THE FRENCH EMPIRE. Section I. \u2014 Renewal of the War between England and France. When peace was restored, Napoleon directed all his energies to consolidate the power he had acquired. Permission was granted to those whom the violence of the revolution had driven from their country, to return, on certain conditions; Christianity, abolished in the madness of the preceding convulsions, was restored, and arrangements were made with the pope for the future government of the Gallican church ; and finally the con sular power was conferred upon Napoleon for life, while a repre sentative constitution preserved for the nation a mere shadow of freedom. His interference in foreign states was less honourable, he moulded the Italian and Ligurian republics at his pleasure ; but the Swiss proving more refractory, Marshal Ney entered their territory with a large army, to enforce submission to the impe rious dictates of the First Consul. The British ministers remon strated against this interference, but they could uot prevent the French from extending their influence in Germany and Italy, as well as the Swiss cantons. Napoleon was less successful in his efforts to recover the island of Hispaniola, or St. Domingo. A large French army was sent to the island, and the proceedings of its commanders were marked by gross cruelty and treachery ; but these abominable means failed to crush the spirit of the insurgent negroes, and the unfortunate colony was exposed to all the horrors of a servile war. Great Britain did not interfere in this contest, the example of a successful revolt of slaves was deemed of dangerous consequence to our West India islands, and the reduction of St. Domingo was desired rather than deprecated."], [363, "WAR BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE. 349 But the encroachments of France on the independence of the neighbouring states, and the determination of England to retain the island of Malta, gave rise to angry discussions, which, it was soon obvious, would only terminate in a renewal of hostilities (1803). The English commenced the war by issuing letters of marque, authorizing the seizure of French vessels ; Napoleon retaliated, by seizing the persons of all the British whom pleasure or busi ness had induced to visit France during the brief interval of peace. The threats of invasion were renewed, but the English people evinced a spirit of loyalty, which quelled all fear of danger. In Ireland an unmeaning insurrection was raised by two enthusiasts, Russell and Emmett, but it was suppressed almost the instant it exploded, and a few of the leaders were capitally punished. Hanover, however, was occupied by a French army, and the Dutch republic joined in the war against Britain. On the other hand, the English conquered the French islands of St. Lucie and Tobago, and the Dutch settlements of Demerara and Essequebo. In Asia, the English broke the dangerous power of the Mahrattas, who were supposed, at the instigation of the French, to have formed plans for the subver sion of the company's power. The earl of Mornington, who had recently been created marquis of Wellesley, disconcerted their schemes by his vigour and promptitude ; and the formidable Scindiah was forced to purchase peace by the cession of a large portion of his dominions. The king of Kandi, who had assailed the British power in Ceylon, was also subdued, and our colonial empire in Asia was thus at once enlarged and secured. The French colonial power was at the same time nearly annihilated ; the island of St. Domingo was wrested from them by the insur gent blacks, and erected into an independent state, under its ancient Indian name of Hayti. These results might have been reasonably anticipated, for without a navy it was impossible for France to retain its colonies. Mr. Pitt had retired from office just before the conclusion of the peace, his friends became anxious that he should return to the administration on the renewal of war ; and Mr. Addington was forced to yield to their superior influence (1804). The"], [364, "350 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. premier encountered many difficulties in constructing a cabinet, and had to resist a more formidable opposition in parliament than he had been accustomed to meet. While Mr. Pitt w-as labouring to strengthen his ministry, Napoleon was more successfully engaged in securing the supreme power in France. He accused his rivals, Moreau and Pichegru, of having plotted his destruction, in conjunction with Georges, a royalist leader, and charged the English ministers with having hired assassins to destroy him. A more atrocious crime was the murder of the most amiable of the Bourbon princes. The young duke d'Enghien was unjustifiably seized in the neutral territory of Baden, hurried to the castle of Vincennes, and shot by the sentence of a court martial, contrary to all forms of law, as well as principles of justice. Immediately after the peipetration of this ruthless deed, Napoleon obtained the title of emperor from his servile senate ; the dignity was declared hereditary in his family, and the principal powers of Europe, with the exception of Great Britain, recognised the new sovereign. The emperor of Russia was anxious to avenge the fate of the duke d'Enghien, his remonstrances against the usurpations of Napoleon were very warm, but none of the other continental sovereigns seconded his zeal, and the storm, which threatened to burst forth, soon subsided. Having no ally on the continent, England had no means of employing her military strength, and the operations of the war were confined to a few naval enter prises. Napoleon offered terms of peace ; but the British minister, relying on the probable co-operation of Russia, refused to negotiate (1805). At the same time war was commenced against Spain, by sending out a squadron to intercept the Plate fleet, laden with the treasures of Spanish America. This attempt was made before hostilities were formally declared ; but the British minister justified it by referring to the intimate con nexion that had been formed between the courts of Paris and Madrid. Mr. Pitt's conduct was approved by large parlia mentary majorities ; but he received a harsh proof of the decline of his influence, in the impeachment of his friend Lord Melville, for official delinquency. When the charge was made in the House of Commons, Mr. Pitt vindicated the conduct of Lord"], [365, "WAR BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE. 351 Melville; but, notwithstanding the minister's exertions, the impeachment was carried by the casting vote of the speaker. But the premier was more successful in his foreign policy ; the emperor of Russia concluded a treaty with England for restrain ing the ambition of France, and Napoleon's encroachments in Italy induced Austria to accede to the league. Napoleon, at the request of the constituted authorities of the Italian republic, assumed the title of king of Italy ; and in the cathedral of Milan placed upon his head the ancient iron crown of the Lombard monarchs, and with less ceremony, annexed the territories of the Ligurian republic to the French empire. The Austrian emperor vainly remonstrated ; and at length relying on the aid of the Russians, published a declaration of war. Unfortunately Francis commenced hostilities by an action as unjustifiable as any of which he accused Napoleon. The elector of Bavaria, whose son was in the French capital, declared himself neutral, upon which the Austrian troops entered his dominions, treated them as a conquered country, and compelled him to seek refuge in Franconia. Napoleon eagerly seized the opportunity of branding his enemies as the aggressors in the contest, and declaring himself the protector of the liberties of Europe. The naval war was maintained by Great Britain with equal vigour and success. The French and Spanish fleets having formed a junction, sailed for the West Indies, but they were soon pursued by Lord Nelson, the terror of whose name induced them to return to Europe. Off Ferrol they encountered an inferior squadron, under Sir Robert Calder, and lost two of their ships, but the rest reached the bay of Cadiz, where they were strongly reinforced. Lord Nelson, with twenty-seven sail of the line appeared off the coast, and the French admiral Villeneuve, relying on his vast superiority of force, resolved to hazard an engagement. The allied fleets of France and Spain, amounting to thirty-three ships of the line, besides frigates and corvettes, appeared near Cape Trafalgar, ranged in order of battle, Nelson gave immediate orders for an attack, and the English fleet advancing in two divisions, soon broke through the adverse line. In the heat of the engagement, the heroic British commander"], [366, "352 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. fell mortally wounded ; but he lived to know that his plans had been crowned with success, twelve of the enemies' ships having struck before he expired. A dreadful storm, which arose just after the battle closed, prevented the English from retaining all the fruits of their victory ; but four prizes reached Gibraltar, fifteen French and Spanish vessels were destroyed or sunk ; out of the fourteen which fled, six were wrecked, and four taken at a later period by Sir Robert Strachan. The joy which so brilliant a victory diffused throughout England was chastened by grief for the loss of the gallant Nelson ; he was honourably interred at the public expense, and monuments were erected to his memory by a grateful nation. Napoleon consoled himself for his losses at sea by the prospect of gaining some decisive advantage over the Austrians before they could be joined by their Russian auxiliaries. He treated with contempt the threats of Gustavus, king of Sweden ; and it must be confessed that the pompous boasts of that eccentric monarch, combined with his vacillating conduct, did not entitle him to much respect. The French army crossed the Rhine, and disregarding the neutrality of the king of Prussia, passed through the Franconian territories of that monarch, and having passed the Danube, began to menace the rear of the Austrians. In spite of the remonstrances of the archduke Charles, the cabinet of Vienna had entrusted the chief command of their armies to General Mack, whose talents and fidelity were both suspicious. Mack in a short time permitted himself to be surrounded by the French at Ulm ; he had ample means for a protracted defence, having twenty thousand men under his command, but through cowardice or incapacity, he consented to a capitulation, by which he and his soldiers became prisoners of war. Intelligence of the battle of Trafalgar came to abate Napoleon's triumph, while the courage of Francis was revived by the arrival of the Russian auxiliaries. The French, flushing forward, made themselves masters of Vienna ; but the Russians, encouraged by the presence of their emperor, though they had been severely harassed in Moravia, showed so much spirit, that the allies resolved to hazard an engagement. In the beginning of December, the hostile armies met near the village of Austerlitz; Kutusoff, who"], [367, "353 WAR BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE. directed the movements of the allies, injudiciously extended his lines, with the intention of outflanking the French ; Napoleon at once saw and took advantage of the error, he separated the enemies' central divisions from those of both wings, and pouring his columns through the gaps, overwhelmed his foes in detail. After a desperate resistance, the Russians were forced to retreat; a large body attempted to escape over a frozen lake, but the French artillery poured a storm of shot from a neighbouring eminence, which broke the ice around the fugitives, and the greater part of them perished in the waters. This severe defeat humbled the emperor Francis ; he accepted peace on the terms dictated by the conqueror, but the emperor Alexander refused to be a party to the treaty, and returned to his own country. During these transactions, the selfish conduct of the king of Prussia was as injurious to the allies as it was ultimately ruinous to himself. On the violation of his Franconian territories, he had taken arms, and entered into treaties with Great Britain and Russia ; but Napoleon, aware that the prompt movement of a third power might disconcert all his plans, contrived to keep awake the ancient jealousy between the sovereigns of Austria and Prussia, and he finally won the tacit approbation of the latter power by offering Hanover as a bribe. Thus the Prussian sovereio-n was induced to favour the alarming extension of French power by a share of the plunder of his own allies. The battle of Austerlitz was a fatal blow to Mr. Pitt ; he had been the chief agent in forming the coalition \u2014 he had loudly and boldly prognosticated its success, and had despised the warnings of his political adversaries ; the failure of all his hopes proved too much for his shattered constitution, and he died at the commencement of the parliamentary session (1806). His parliamentary friends procured him a splendid funeral, and the payment of his debts at the national cost, and a monument was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey."], [368, "354 TOE FRENCH EMPIRE. Section II. \u2014 Progress of Napoleon's Power. While Napoleon was establishing his supremacy over the con tinent of Europe, the marquis of Wellesley was further extending and securing the British empire in India, by humbling the Mahratta powers. Jesswunt Holkar, a formidable chief, made a vigorous resistance, but he soon found that his soldiers could not cope with the disciplined troops of the company, and was forced to beg a peace. He obtained better terms than he could have expected from the marquis Cornwallis, who succeeded the marquis of Wellesley, for the court of directors had found that conquests were very expensive, and that every new acquisition of territory became an additional source of expense. At this time the English nation generally took little interest in the affairs of India ; men's minds were more occupied by the change of ministry consequent on the death of Mr. Pitt. It was generally desired that as large a share of the talent of the country as possible, without reference to party, should be included in the new administration; and Lord Grenville, to whom the arrangements were confided, overcame the king's reluctance to Mr. Fox, and made that gentleman one of the secretaries of state. The first measures of the ministers won them a considerable share of public favour ; Lord Henry Petty introduced order into the financial accounts, which were in such a state of confusion as to afford protection to fraud and peculation ; Mr. Fox pro posed and carried the abolition of the infamous slave trade, which had been so long a disgrace to England and to Christianity. The acquittal of Lord Melville, by the House of Peers, was received with some surprise; but the ministers appear to have acted impartially in avoiding any interference that might influence the result of an official investigation. The war was still prosecuted with great vigour ; the Dutch colony of the Cape was subdued, and a small force under Sir Home Popham and General Beresford, captured the important city of Buenos Ayres in South America. The Provincials, how ever, disappointed in the hope of obtaining freedom and inde pendence by British aid, took up arms, and the conquerors of"], [369, "PROGRESS OF NAPOLEON'S POWER. 355 Buenos Ayres were forced to capitulate, while a British arma ment was on its way to maintain the supposed conquest. Hastening to secure the reward of his perfidy, the king of Prussia occupied Hanover, ceding to the French the duchy of Cleves, and some other districts, as a reward for yielding him the electorate. Gustavus of Sweden joined the British court in remonstrating against this proceeding ; but as that monarch's actions were not very consistent with his menaces, the Prussians treated him with contempt. An ally of Britain was about the same time driven from his dominions. During the Austrian war, the king of Naples, encouraged by .the withdrawal of the French troops from his territories, and, instigated by his queen, an Austrian princess, received an army- of Russians and English into his capital. Napoleon, provoked by this unexpected war, declared that the Bourbon dynasty had ceased to reign in Naples, and assembled an army to execute his threats, just as the Russian and English forces were withdrawn. The invaders scarcely encountered any resistance, except in Calabria, where the peasants made a brief stand. The king of Naples fled to Sicily, and Napoleon conferred the vacant throne on his brother, Joseph Buonaparte. The peasants in Calabria and the Abruzzi, har rassed the French by desultory attacks ; and they were supported by Sir Sydney Smith, who commanded the British naval force on the Sicilian station. The queen of Naples and Sir Sydney Smith prevailed on Sir John Stuart, the commander of the British force in Sicily, to transport his troops into Calabria; the natives did not join the invaders in such force as had been expected, and they would have immediately returned, had not an opportunity- offered of engaging the French general Regnier. The armies met at Maida, and the French, though greatly superior in number, were completely defeated. But the victory had no result except to raise the character of the British army, which had been for some time depressed. The French poured large bodies of soldiers into Calabria, and in a short time estab lished their authority over the whole of the south of Italy. Havino- procured the throne of Naples for his brother Joseph, Napoleon resolved to place his brother Louis on that of Holland. The Dutch submitted to the change without remonstrance,"], [370, "356 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. though their country thus became a mere province of France ; but they consoled themselves by reflecting on the mild character of their new sovereign, who was sincerely anxious to promote the prosperity of his subjects. His efforts were, however, con trolled by his imperial brother, who was ambitious of becoming the arbiter of Europe, and rendering everything subservient to the military sway of France. Still Napoleon professed an anxious desire for peace, and made overtures to Mr. Fox, for whose character he professed and probably felt the highest vene ration. The negotiations were broken off by the refusal of the French to admit the Russians to a share of the treaty, and by Napoleon's perseverance in retaining power inconsistent with the independence of the other European states. While the subject was under discussion, Mr. Fox died, and was succeeded in office by Mr. (afterwards carl) Grey : the conferences were continued, but M. Talleyrand, who was the representative of France, insinuated that the change in the British cabinet blighted the hope of restoring tranquillity to Europe. The frustration of this negotiation led to a new war ; during the conferences, Napoleon's agents averred that the restoration of Hanover would not be refused ; the king of Prussia was indig nant at the readiness with which his pretended friend sacrificed his interests ; Hanover had been the reward of subserviency, if not treachery, and he now found that he retained the bribe by a very insecure tenure. A more justifiable ground of indignation was the opposition which Napoleon gave to the efforts of the Prussians, in forming an association, which might counterbalance the confederation of the Rhine, an alliance that transferred to France the supremacy over Germany, that had formerly- belonged to the house of Austria ; finally, it was more than suspected that Napoleon had offered to win the favour of the Russian emperor at the expense of his Prussian ally. Frederic William was further stimulated by his queen and his subjects; the Germans generally were enraged by the military tyranny of the French, especially by the judicial murder of two booksellers, who were shot pursuant to the sentence of a court-martial for circu lating libels against Napoleon. Anger is an evil councillor to nations as well as individuals ;"], [371, "PROGRESS OF NAPOLEON'S POWER. 357 yielding to the suggestions of indignation rather than prudence, the king of Prussia commenced hostilities before his own arrange ments were complete, or his allies ready to give him effective assistance ; and he intrusted the command of his army to the duke of Brunswick, who possessed the personal bravery of a soldier, but not the prudence and abilities requisite for a general. Louis, the king's cousin, impetuously advancing to seek the French, encountered a vastly superior force ; he was defeated and slain, a calamity that greatly dispirited the Prussian army. This was only the preliminary to the fatal battle of Jena ; the Prussians, injudiciously posted, and badly commanded, were routed with great slaughter, and what was even worse than defeat, a dispute arose between them and their Saxon allies, which induced the latter to conclude a separate peace with Napoleon. The success of the French was uninterrupted, Berlin opened its gates to the conquerors, and the division of the Prussian army, which had been long preserved unbroken by the heroic exertions of Marshal Blucher, was forced to \" capitulate. The fugitive king still preserved his courage, relying on the approaching aid of his Russian ally. Napoleon's forces advanced into Poland, where they were joined by many of the inhabitants, who were taught to hope that the French emperor would restore the independence of their native country ; but he was incapable of such o-enerous policy, and in after-life he lamented too late that he sacrificed the hopes of a brave and grateful people to the temporary gain of selfish ambition. The Russians successfully eno-ao-ed the French at Pultusk, but they were unable to retain their advantages, and were forced gradually to retreat. Encourao-ed by his rapid success, Nopoleon resolved to crush, if possible, the commercial prosperity of Great Britain ; he issued a series of edicts from Berlin, declaring the British islands in a state of blockade, and excluding British manufactures from all the continental ports. Every country that refused obedience to these decrees was threatened with immediate vengeance, and Portuoal, so long the faithful ally of England, was marked out as the first victim (1807). Great indignation was excited throughout Britain by. the French emperor's adoption of this unparalleled system ; but it proved eventually more injurious to"], [372, "358 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. himself than to his enemies, British manufactures and colonial produce were smuggled to the Continent in various ways, and Napoleon was finally compelled to connive at the illicit traffic. But the menaces of the French had roused the spirit of the English people, and complaints were made of the want of vigour and success with which the war was supported. A second expe dition against Buenos Ayres, under General Whitelocke, dis gracefully failed, though it must be confessed that the hatred of the Spanish Provincials to the English, as strangers and heretics, would probably have prevented any permanent success in South America. An armament sent against Constantinople, to gratify our Russian ally, by enforcing his demands on Turkey, was equally unsuccessful ; and an attempt to occupy Egypt, badly contrived, and worse executed, terminated in loss and disgrace. But the ministers might have overcome the unpopularity occa sioned by these failures, had they not displeased the king by introducing a bill for opening the highest dignities of the army and navy to Roman catholics. His majesty entertained religious objections to the measures, he demanded that the cabinet should not only abandon it for the present, but give a promise that it should not be proposed at any future period. The ministers refused to give a pledge which they regarded as unconstitutional, and resigned their offices. A new administration was formed under the auspices of the duke of Portland and Mr. Perceval, an appeal was made to the country by a dissolution of parlia ment, and the tide of popular prejudice ran so strong against the preceding cabinet, that many, if not most of its supporters, were rejected by the electors. Russia vigorously maintained the war against Turkey, and gained some important advantages. The Turks, enraged by their losses, directed their vengeance against Sultan Selim, whose ' no attempts to introduce European reforms had offended their inve terate prejudices. The Janissaries deposed their unfortunate sovereign, and raised his cousin Mustapha to the throne ; but this revolution did not change the fortune of the war, for the Russians soon after gained a signal naval victory off the island of Tenedos. But the Turkish war did not divert the attention of Alexander"], [373, "PROGRESS OF NArOLEON's POWER. 359 from the more important object of checking French ambition. Military operations were renewed during the winter, and a sanguinary battle at Eylau, in which each army lost more than twenty thousand men, led to no decisive result. In some minor engagements the allies had the advantage, but their gains were more than outbalanced by the loss of Dantzic, which, after an obstinate resistance, surrendered to the French. Napoleon, on the fall of Dantzic, hastened to terminate the war by the decisive battle of Friedland ; the Russians fought with great bravery, but their generals were inferior in ability and experience to those of the enemy, and they were completely defeated. Koningsberg was surrendered immediately after this battle, and the existence of the Prussian monarchy now depended on the discretion or moderation of the conquerors. An armistice having been con cluded, Napoleon sought a personal interview with the Russian emperor, and arrangements were soon made for a conference of the two potentates on a raft in the river- Niemen. In this and some subsequent interviews, Buonaparte won over the emperor Alex ander to his interests, by stimulating that monarch's ambition for eastern conquest, and promises of support. Peace was restored by the treaty of Tilsit, all sacrifices were made at the expense of the Prussian monarch, by whose distress even his Russian ally did not refuse to profit ; and w-hen Frederic ventured to remonstrate, he was contemptuously informed that he owed the preservation of the miserable remnant of his kingdom to Napoleon's personal friendship for Alexander. The eccentric king of Sweden refused to be included in this pacification, but he was unable to prevent the French from occupying Stralsund and the island of Rugen. Terms were arranged for a peace between Russia and Turkey, but so many points remained open for dispute, that it was manifest war would be renewed at no distant period. The king of Prussia was forced not only to accede to the Berlin decrees, and exclude British manufactures and colonial produce from his dominions, but had also to receive French garrisons into his principal fortresses, and these troops treated the unfortunate Germans with such arrogance and cruelty, that they were almost reduced to despair. Napoleon's power had now nearly touched the"], [374, "360 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. summit of its greatness, and had he been contented with what he had already acquired, it might have been permanent, but his restless ambition hurried him soon into an unprincipled contest, which terminated in his overthrow. Section III. \u2014 The French Invasion of Spain. After the treaty of Tilsit it was generally believed that Napo leon would endeavour to enforce the Berlin decrees by excluding the British from the navigation of the Sound, and that he would probably avail himself of the Danish navy to execute his old project of an invasion. To prevent such an enterprise, a powerful armament was sent against Denmark, which had hitherto remained neutral in the contest. An imperious demand for the instant surrender of the Danish fleet and naval stores, to be retained as a deposit by the English until the conclusion of the war, being peremptorily rejected, the Danes were briskly attacked by land and sea. After Copenhagen had been furiously bom barded for four days, the Danish court was constrained to submit to the demands of the British, and the fleet was removed, while the indignant people could scarcely be prevented from avenging the national insult even by the presence of a superior force. The attack of Denmark furnished the Russian emperor with a pretext for fulfilling the promises he made to Napoleon at Tilsit, and breaking off his connexion with Great Britain. He complained in strong language of the disregard which England had ever shown for the rights of neutral powers, and the unscru pulous use that had been made of our naval supremacy, and many of the maritime states seconded his remonstrances. A second fleet was saved from the grasp of the enemy by a less unjustifiable proceeding than the attack on Denmark. Napoleon issued one of his imperious edicts, that \" The house of Braganza had ceased to reign,\" and to enforce it, sent an army to occupy Portugal. The prince regent of that country, at the instigation of the British, sailed with the Portuguese fleet for Rio Janeiro, where he resolved to hold his court until peace was restored."], [375, "361 FRENCH INVASION OF SPAIN. As a retaliation for the Berlin decrees, the British government issued orders in council, restraining the trade of neutrals with France, and all countries subservient to its power. Against these regulations the government of the United States of America protested loudly, and their rem onstrances assumed a very angry character, which threatened speedy hostilities. An attack made on an American frigate, whose captain refused to submit to having his ship searched by an English vessel of inferior force, was resented as a national insult ; a proclamation was issued, excluding all armed British ships from the harbours and waters of the United States ; and an embargo was laid on British commerce. While the policy of the orders in council, and the proffered mediation of Austria, to effect the restoration of tranquillity, were warmly discussed in the British parliament, events were occurring in Spain which gave the war an entirely new character and direction. The annals of the world could scarcely supply a parallel to the picture of degradation which the Spanish court presented at this period. Charles, the imbecile king, was the dupe of a faithless wife, and an unprincipled minister ; this unworthy favourite had been raised, by the queen's partiality, from an humble station to the highest rank ; Godoy, Prince of the Peace, as he was called, had neither abilities for the high office with which he was invested, nor strength of mind to support his elevation ; he excluded Ferdinand, the heir apparent, from all share in the government, and thus provoked the resentment of a prince who was as ambitious of power as he was unfit to possess it. But Ferdinand's evil dispositions were as yet unknown to the Spaniards, and when Godoy attempted to ruin him by an accusation of treason, the people showed such dis content that Charles was forced to consent to his son's liberation. Napoleon won Godoy's support by proposing a partition of the Peninsula, part of which should be assigned to the royal minion, as an independent sovereignty, and he thus obtained the means of pouring a large body of troops into Spain, and occupying the principal fortresses. Charles, intimidated by these proceedings, meditated flight to Spanish America, but finally resolved to R"], [376, "362 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. resign his crown to Ferdinand (1808). By the intrigues of the French, Charles was induced to disavow his abdication, while Ferdinand was led to expect a recognition of his royal title from the emperor Napoleon. Deluded by such representa tions, he proceeded to Bayonne, where he was contemptuously informed that \" the Bourbons had ceased to reign ;\" and on his refusal to resign his claims for the petty kingdom of Etruria, he was guarded as a prisoner. A fierce riot in Madrid, occasioned by preparations for the removal of the Spanish princes to France, was cruelly punished by Murat, who massacred multitudes of the unarmed populace. Soon after, Charles, accompanied by his queen, proceeded to Bayonne, and formally abdicated his crown in favour of Napoleon ; Ferdinand, daunted by intelligence of the massacre at Madrid, pursued the same course ; and the French emperor summoned his brother Joseph from the throne of Naples to occupy that of Spain. The Neapolitan kingdom was given to Murat, whose eminent services to the French emperor were not overpaid even by the splendid donation of a crown. Many of the Spanish nobles tamely acquiesced in this arrangement, but the great bulk of the nation rejected the intruding sovereign, and preparations to maintain Spanish independence were made in the principal provinces. Andalusia took the lead, Ferdinand VII. was proclaimed in Sevdle, war declared against Napoleon, and a junta or council chosen to direct the affairs of the government. A French squadron, which had been stationed in the bay of Cadiz, was forced to surrender to a Spanish flotilla, but this would not have happened if the port had not been at the same time blockaded by the British fleet. In every province not occupied by French troops, the adult population offered military service to the different juntas; the English sent large supplies of arms and ammunition, and released all their Spanish prisoners of war, a seasonable rein forcement to the patriotic armies. In their first contests with the invaders, the Spaniards obtained considerable success ; Marshal Moncey was repulsed from Valencia with great loss ; and Marshal Dupont, with eight thousand men, was forced to surrender to the patriot general, Castanos (July 20th). On the"], [377, "FRENCn INVASION OF SPAIN. 363 very day that this unfavourable event occurred, the intrusive monarch made his triumphal entry into Madrid. Joseph Buonaparte, however, had neither the firmness nor courage of his brother Napoleon ; the moment he heard of Dupont's sur render, he plundered the treasury and the royal palaces of their most valuable contents, and fled to Burgos. A bold example of Spanish heroism directed the attention of all Europe to the struggle in the Peninsula. The citizens of Saragossa, distrusting the fidelity of the captain-general of Arragon, deposed him, and chose for their leader Don Joseph Palafox, a nobleman of dauntless courage, though destitute of military experience. Their city was almost destitute of defences, they had only a mere handful of regular soldiers in the garrison, and they had a very- limited supply of arms and ammunition. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, they sternly refused to admit the French, and prepared for a desperate resistance. All classes were animated with the same spirit ; the monks manu factured gunpowder and prepared cartridges, the women shared the toil of raising fortifications, even the children lent their feeble aid in such labour as was not beyond their strength. It is not wonderful that the French soldiers were daunted by such a heroic population ; after a long and sanguinary contest they abandoned the siege, leaving Saragossa in ruins, but immortalized by the patriotic courage that had enabled its undisciplined citizens to triumph over a regular army. The spirit of resistance soon extended to Portugal ; the people of Oporto rose in a body, seized and imprisoned all the French they could find, and formed a junta under the superintendence of the bishop. A British force, commanded by Sir Arthur Wellesley, stimulated and protected these patriotic exertions. A French division, posted at Roleia to terrify the insurgents, was driven from its position by the allied forces, and the north of Portugal delivered from the invaders. Marshal Junot col lected all the forces at his disposal to drive back the English ; he found Sir Arthur Wellesley at Vimiera, and immediately attacked his lines (August 21st). After a brief but vigorous struggle, the French were defeated and driven in confusion towards Lisbon. Scarcely had the victory been won, when Sir R 2"], [378, "364 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. Arthur Wellesley was superseded by Sir Hew Dalrymple, who concluded a convention with Junot, for the evacuation of Portu gal, on terms that were generally regarded as too favourable to the French, after their recent defeat. While Napoleon was pursuing his ambitious designs against Spain, Alexander of Russia was engaged in a war with Sweden, undertaken in an equally unjust and aggressive spirit. The English sent an army under Sir John Moore, to assist their ally, but that general refusing to submit to the dictates of the eccentric or perhaps the insane Gustavus, soon returned home. Though the Swedes fought with great courage they were unable to resist the overwhelming force of the Russians, especially as the limited resources of Sweden were wasted by Gustavus in senseless and impracticable enterprises. At length, the Swedes grew weary of a sovereign whose conduct threatened the ruin of their country ; he was arrested by some of his officers, deposed, and the crown transferred to the duke of Sudermania, who took the title of Charles XIII. (a. d. 1809). The new monarch was forced to purchase peace from Russia, by the cession of Finland, and the exclusion of British vessels from the ports of Sweden. The Spaniards soon found that a central government was necessary to the success of their operations ; the different juntas, therefore, chose deputies who formed a supreme junta for the general conduct of the war. The marquis de la Romana, who had commanded a large body of Spaniards employed by the French in Holstein, was enabled to return home with his troops, by British aid, and take a share in the defence of his country. But the want of concert among the Spanish leaders, and of discipline among the soldiers, rendered them unable to cope with the French ; they were severely defeated at Durango, Reynosa, and Tudela, and Napoleon soon appeared in Spain, at the head of one hundred and fifty thousand men (1808). A very exaggerated notion of the capabilities of the Spaniards appears to have been formed by the English ministers. They ordered Sir John Moore to advance with the British forces in Portugal, to the aid of the patriot armies, but do not seem to have sufficiently investigated the obstacles by which his march was impeded. When Sir John Moore entered Spain, he found"], [379, "365 FRENCH INVASION OF SPAIN. that the French were everywhere victorious, and that it was hopeless to expect such active co-operation from the Spaniards as would enable him to turn the scale. After some hesitation, finding himself in danger of being surrounded, he retired rather precipitately into Gallicia. The English soldiers, in their retreat, displayed great courage whenever they were attacked by the enemy ; but, in other respects, their conduct was so disorderly that it was stigmatized by the general himself as disgraceful. At length, a halt was made at Corunna, where the troops remained until the transports, prepared for their embarkation, could arrive from Vigo. In this position they were attacked by the French ; but the English soldiers, though dispirited by their late retreat and worn down by fatigue, compelled the enemy to retire. Sir John Moore was mortally wounded in this battle, and was buried on the field. The embarkation of the army was very feebly resisted, and though the British gained no honour by the campaign, its conclusion impressed the enemy with greater respect for English patience and valour than they had previously been accustomed to entertain. At the beginning of the year 1809, the possession of Spain seemed assured to Napoleon, but neither the Spaniards nor the British despaired of final success. The English parliament readily voted the necessary supplies for the defence of Spain and Portugal, and reinforcements were sent to the Peninsula. About the same time, his royal highness the duke of York was accused of having connived at some abuses in the command of the army ; he was acquitted by a great majority of the House of Commons, but he deemed it prudent to resign his situation, and Sir David Dundas was appointed commander-in-chief. Austria once more resolved to try the hazards of war ; the emperor Francis was induced to take this precipitate step by the harsh remonstrances and menaces of Napoleon ; taking advantage of the absence of the large body of French troops employed in Spain, the archduke Charles entered Bavaria and took possession of Munich. But the rapid measures of Buona parte baffled the Austrian calculations, he speedily collected a large army and defeated the archduke at Eckmuhl, so severely, that he was compelled to cross the Danube. Vienna was thus"], [380, "366 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. opened to the conquerors, and Napoleon took possession of that capital. The archduke was still undismayed, he attacked the French in their positions at Asperne and Essling ; the battle w-as very sanguinary and obstinate, it terminated to the advantage of the Austrians, but they had suffered such severe loss that they were unable to profit by their victory. The failure of the archduke John, in Italy, more than counterbalanced the success of the .Austrians at Asperne, and was the chief cause of their final overthrow at Wagram (July 5th). It would be impossible to describe within reasonable limits the various conflicts that terminated in this result ; suffice it to say, that the Austrians were driven from all their positions, forced to retreat in confu sion, and only saved from total ruin by an armistice. The Tyrolcse and Voralbergers had been transferred to the king of Bavaria by the treaty of Presburg, but their national privileges and immunities had been guaranteed by the articles of pacification. But Maximilian Joseph was as regardless of a compact as his master Napoleon ; he violated the Tyrolese con stitution without scruple, crushed the peasants with severe taxes, and punished remonstrances as seditious. The Tyrolese seized the opportunity of the Austrian war to raise the standard of revolt ; success attended their early operations, and the Bavari ans were expelled from the principal towns. A French army entered the country and laid it waste with fire and sword, but the Tyrolese, animated by a heroic peasant named Hoffer, expelled the invaders once more, and secured a brief interval of tranquillity. When the total defeat of the Austrians at Wagram compelled the emperor Francis to accept peace on any terms, the Tyrolese were assailed by overwhelming forces ; they made a desperate resistance, but the French and Bavarian columns penetrated their fastnesses, desolated the land with fire and sword, and punished the leading patriots as rebels. Hoffer was taken prisoner and put to death by the sentence of a court martial ; Mayer, another gallant chieftain, shared the same fate, and the green hills of Tyrol were again subjected to Bavarian tyranny. Several efforts were made in Germany to shake off the French yoke; Schill, who commanded a regiment in the Prussian"], [381, "367 FRENCH INVASION OF SPAIN. service, collected a considerable force and harassed the French detachments in Saxony and Westphalia, but he was defeated and slain by some Dutch and Danish troops, near Stralsund. The duke of Brunswick made a bold effort to recover his here ditary dominions, but after the overthrow of the Austrians he despaired of success, and sought refuge in England. The arch duke Ferdinand invaded Saxony, while Napoleon's brother Jerome trembled for the security of his Westphalian throne, in consequence of the progress of General Kienmayer. But the success of Napoleon in Austria frustrated the exertions of the patriots in the north of Germany, especially as no effort was made to send them support from England. The attention of the British ministry was occupied by an expedition of a very different nature, for which the most ample preparations were made. A fleet of thirty-seven sail of the line, twenty-nine ships of inferior rate, besides small craft, and an army of forty thousand men, were sent to the island of Walcheren, on the coast of Holland. After many delays, the fort of Flushing was besieged and taken ; but Antwerp, which was the great object of attack, had, in the mean time, been secured, and the commanders despaired of success. Soon after wards the pestilential climate of Walcheren spread disease through the British army and navy; the greater part of the forces returned to England; the progress of the disease soon rendered the removal of the remainder necessary, and the only result of this costly armament was the destruction of the fortifi cations of Flushing. Their naval successes in some degree consoled the English for this disappointment ; Lord Cochrane destroyed four vessels, forming part of a French squadron, in Basque-roads, and irreparably injured several others; Lord Collingwood was similarly successful in the Mediterranean, and the French were deprived of their remaining colonies in the West Indies. Some European islands, especially those called the Ionian, were added to the British dominions, a proceeding which gave some offence to the new sultan of Turkey, Mahmoud II., who had been elevated to the throne on the deposition of his cousin Selim and his half-brother Mustapha. But the progress of the"], [382, "368 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. Russian arms induced Mahmoud to court an alliance with Great Britain, and jealousy of the same power inclined the Persian shah to renew his former friendly connexions with England. Though the Russian emperor did not join Napoleon in the war against Austria, he received a share of the provinces which Francis was forced to resign, in order to purchase peace. But though the Austrian emperor was compelled to make many great and painful sacrifices, he obtained more favourable condi tions than had been anticipated ; and Napoleon received general praise for the moderation with which he used his victory. The secret cause of this affected generosity was subsequently revealed, and proved that it resulted from a plan for more effectually securing his despotism over Europe. After the retreat of the British from Corunna, the French seemed to have permanently secured possession of Spain. Though the marquis de la Romana and the duke del Infantado held out against the invaders, yet Saragossa was taken, in spite of the heroic resistance of its inhabitants ; and Soult having invaded Portugal, made himself master of Oporto. Victor also advanced towards the same country, and, on his march, overthrew the Spanish army of Estremadura. But Oporto w-as soon recovered by a British force, under Sir Arthur Wellesley, and the removal of a large body of the French to take part in the Austrian war revived the courage of the Spaniards. Sir Arthur Wellesley, believing it possible to strike an important blow before the French grand army could be reinforced, boldly, and perhaps rashly advanced into Spain. He was attacked at Talavera (July 28th), by the united forces of Jourdan, Victor, and Sebastiani, who were rather the masters than the servants of the nominal king, Joseph Buonaparte. British valour has rarely been more nobly displayed than in this engagement; the French were beaten back at every point, and had the Spaniards displayed the same courage and zeal as their allies, the retreat might have been changed into a total rout. The misconduct of the Spaniards indeed, deprived the English of the chief fruits of their victory ; they were soon compelled to act only on the defensive, and to retreat slowly towards the frontiers of Portugal. Nor were the patriots more successful in other quarters ; they did not, how-"], [383, "FRENCH INVASION OF SPAIN. 369 ever, despair, and the supreme junta published a spirited pro clamation, animating the national courage, and convoking an assembly of the cortes or estates of the realm, to form a fixed constitutional government. The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the king's accession diffused joy through England. About the same time, the death of the duke of Portland, and some dissensions in the cabinet, led to a partial change in the ministry. Mr. Perceval was appointed premier, and several angry debates ensued in both Houses of Parliament. The opponents of the ministry failed in procuring a condemnation of the Walcheren expedition ; but, during the discussion, party spirit raged with great violence, and Sir Francis Burdett, having assailed the privileges of the House of Commons in very unmeasured terms, was ordered to be committed to the Tower. He declared his intention to resist the warrant, but was arrested and conveyed to the Tower by a military force. The soldiers, on their return, were assaulted by the mob, and a riot ensued in which several lives were lost. At the close of the session, the popular baronet was liberated, as a matter of course ; he brought actions for what he regarded as an illegal arrest, against the speaker and the serjeant-at-arms, but the court of King's Bench disallowed his claims and supported the privileges of the House of Commons. These ebullitions of party violence did not weaken the British cabinet, though they induced the enemies of England to believe the country on the verge of a convulsion. France was apparently tranquil, and Napoleon revealed the secret of his moderation at Vienna, by procuring a divorce from the empress Josephine, the faithful companion of his former fortunes, and offering his hand to the archduchess Maria Louisa, daughter of the emperor Francis (a. d. 1810). This marriage, which seemed permanently to establish Buonaparte's power, became eventually the principal cause of his ruin, for it alarmed all the Northern powers, and especially the Russians, who justly feared that Napoleon, secured by the Austrian alliance, would strive to make himself absolute master of Europe. His arbitrary conduct to Holland justified these suspicions ; he removed his brother r 3"], [384, "370 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. from the throne of that country, and annexed it as a province to France. The disputes respecting the trade of neutrals, between Eng land and America, began to assume a very hostile aspect, and it was feared that war could not long be delayed. But public attention was diverted from this subject to the struggle in Portugal, where Sir Arthur Wellesley, who had recently been created Lord Wellington, nobly sustained the honour of the English arms. The French army, strongly reinforced, was placed under the command of Massena, prince of Essling ; the fortresses of Astorga, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Almeida, were captured; Lord Wellington retired slowly before a superior force, and Massena flattered himself that he would soon obtain possession of Lisbon. His presumption was first checked at Busaco, where the British made a stand and inflicted a severe check on their assailants ; but the hopes of the French were completely- destroyed when they saw Lord Wellington take up his position in the formidable fines of Torres Vedras. Not daring to advance, and ashamed to retreat, Massena remained for more than a month watching his cautious adversary, and losing thousands of his men by disease or desertion. He at length retreated to Santarem, but though he received a large reinforcement, he did not venture to resume offensive operations. A desultory war was maintained in Spain ; the patriot armies were usually defeated in regular engagements, but the invaders were severely harassed by the incessant attacks of the guerilla parties; convoys were intercepted, stragglers cut off, and outposts exposed to constant danger. Cadiz, the residence of the supreme junta and the seat of government, was besieged, but the strength of its works and the ease with which relief was obtained by sea, prevented the French from making any progress in its reduction. The cortes assembled in this city and framed a form of constitutional government, which, however, had many violent opponents among the higher orders of the nobility and clergy. Most of the French and Dutch colonies in the Indian seas were subdued, under the direction of Lord Minto, the governor general of India, a nobleman whose judicious administration of"], [385, "FRENCH INVASION OF SPAIN, 371 affairs in the East, not only extended the British dominions in the East, but suppressed a dangerous mutiny in the presidency of Madras, occasioned by the adoption of economical regula tions, which curtailed the allowances made to officers in the Company's service. In the north of Europe, little of moment, in war, occurred ; the Danes and Russians had some trivial naval engagements with English vessels ; but Sweden was the theatre of a most extraordinary revolution, which, for a time, added her to the enemies of England. The crown prince died suddenly, not without some suspicion of poison, and the Swedish senate tendered the succession to Charles John Bemadotte, one of Napoleon s most celebrated marshals, who had won their favour by the leniency and prudence he displayed some years before in the North of Germany. Bemadotte accepted the offer, to the secret annoyance of Napoleon, who had long been jealous of his mditary fame and independent spirit. Civilized Europe might now be said to be arrayed against Great Britain, but the spirit of its inhabitants did not sink. Its sovereign, afflicted by grief for the loss of his favourite daughter, was seized by the disease under which he had formerly suffered, and fell into a state of mental derangement, from which he never afterwards recovered (a. d. 1811). The prince of Wales was appointed regent, under restrictions similar to those proposed by Mr. Pitt in 1789, but these were subsequently removed when it was found that he intended steadily to pursue his father's system of policy. It was not long before Lord Wellington reaped the fruits of his prudent arrangements for the defence of Portugal. Massena was forced to retreat from Santarem, but before he evacuated the country, he ravaged it in the most frightful manner, destroying many noble monuments of architecture in mere wantonness. The British parliament voted the sum of one hundred thousand pounds for the relief of the Portuguese, and a liberal subscription for the same purpose was formed by private liberality. Almeida was the only town in Portugal retained by the French; it was blockaded by the allies, and Massena's efforts to relieve it led to the battle of Fuentes d'Onor. The"], [386, "372 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. engagement was severe, but British valour triumphed ; the o-arrison of Almeida, disheartened by the defeat of their country men, evacuated the place, and Portugal was delivered from the presence of an enemy. The liberation of Spain was a more difficult task, and it was rendered still more so by the surrender of Badajoz to Marshal Soult, after a very brief and ineffective defence. Lord Welling ton sent Sir William Beresford to recover this important place, but the advance of the French from Seville, compelled that general to raise the siege. The united forces of the British and Spanish encountered the French at Albuera, and gained an important victory; Badajoz was once more invested, but the approach of Soult on one side and Marmont on the other, induced Lord Wellington to retire beyond the Tagus. But in his anxiety to save Badajoz, Soult had so much weakened the force which blockaded Cadiz, that the Spaniards resolved to hazard an expedition against the invading armies in Andalusia. General La Pena, aided by the British lieutenant-general, Graham, undertook to direct these operations, and great hopes were entertained of success. But though Graham obtained a brilliant victory at Barossa, over Marshal Victor, no efforts were made to follow up his success. In the other Spanish pro vinces, the patriotic armies were still more unfortunate ; Mina, indeed, from his mountains, threatened and harassed the invaders, but the other Spanish leaders showed themselves equally deficient in courage and conduct. Neither did all the expected advantages result from the assembling of the cortes ; they prepared, indeed, a constitutional code, which, however, was scarcely suited to the Spanish people, but they maintained the onerous restrictions on the colonial trade, and thus gave deep offence to the South American provinces, and drove them to organize plans for self-government. In other quarters the war was more favourable to British interests; the island of Java was wrested from the Dutch; several flotillas were destroyed by English frigates in the Italian seas, and an attempt made by the Danes to recover the island of Anholt, in the Baltic, was defeated by the gallant garrison. Sweden could scarcely be said to be at war with"], [387, "373 FRENCH INVASION OF SPAIN. Great Britain ; Bemadotte soon discovered that subserviency to France was inconsistent with the interests of his adopted country, and he secretly entered into negotiations with the Russian emperor for restoring their mutual independence. But Alexander wras still too deeply engaged in pursuing the favourite policy of the czars, and establishing the supremacy of Russia on both sides of the Black Sea, at the expense of Turkey and Persia. His success w-as far from answering his expectations ; the wild tribes of the Caucasus severely harassed the invaders of Asiatic Turkey ; and though Kutusoff was more successful on the European side, his acquisitions were obtained by a very disproportionate expenditure of blood and treasure. The dis organized state of the Turkish provinces prevented the sultan from effectively defending his dominions ; in most of them a military aristocracy had usurped the chief power of the state, and in Egypt especially, the Mameluke Beys acted as inde pendent princes. Mohammed Ali, pacha of Egypt, finding that the beys would not submit to his power, and fearing the hazards of civil war, invited them to a banquet, where they were all ruthlessly massacred. The sultan applauded this perfidy, but ere long he found Mohammed Ali a more dangerous subject than the turbulent lords whom he had removed. The mental disease of George III. shewed no symptoms of improvement, and as the time approached when the restrictions imposed on the authority of the prince regent would expire, some anxiety was felt about the probable fate of the ministry. But the prince-regent had become reconciled to the cabinet, and after a faint effort to gain the support of Lords Grey and Grenville, it was resolved that no change should be made in the government (1812). At a later period in the year, negotiations were resumed, in consequence of the murder of Mr. Perceval ; the premier was shot in the lobby of the House of Commons, by Bellingham, a merchant, who believed that the ministers had shown indifference to his fancied claims on the Russian government. After some delay, the old cabinet was re-con structed, under the auspices of the earl of Liverpool, and the plans for forming a united administration were abandoned. Lord William Bentinck, the British minister in Sicily,"], [388, "374 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. strenuously exerted himself to remedy the evils which the imbecility of the king and the tyranny of the queen had intro duced into the government of that island. He succeeded in procuring the establishment of a constitution similar to that of Britain; and the island began to enjoy peace and prosjierity in a greater degree than had been experienced for several centuries. A change in the Spanish constitution revived the courage of the nation ; a new regency, the promulgation of the constitu tional code, and various reforms in the different branches of the administration, gave fresh spirit to the Spaniards, and inspired hopes of final success. Lord Wellington opened the campaign with the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo ; the capture of this important fortress w-as followed by that of Badajoz, but the victors suffered severe loss at both places. Wellington, who had been created an earl for these exploits, next marched against Marmont, and took the important city of Salamanca. Marmont, strengthened by large reinforcements, hoped not only to defeat the British, but to intercept their retreat. As he extended his lines for this purpose, Wellington seized the favourable opportunity, and, pouring his whole force on the weakened divisions, gained the most complete victory that the allies had yet won in the Peninsula. Indeed if the Spaniards had displayed the same energv as the British and the Portuguese, Marmont's entire army would have been ruined. Stfll the immediate results of the battle of Salamanca were very great ; Madrid was evacuated by the intrusive king Joseph ; the blockade of Cadiz was raised; and the city of Seville was taken by Colonel Skerret and the Spanish general La Cruz. The failure of the British at the siege of Burgos, the want of concert in the Spanish councils, and the great reinforcements received by the French, compelled Wellington to resign the fruits of his victory; he retired leisurely to the frontiers of Portugal, and firmly waited an opportunity for renewing his efforts. But events in other parts of the globe were producing the most important results in favour of Spanish independence ; the South American colonies, alarmed by an earthquake which was superstitiously believed to be a visitation of Providence,"], [389, "375 FRENCH INVASION OF SPAIN. returned to their allegiance, and the Russian emperor prepared to measure his strength with the colossal power of Napoleon. Section IV. \u2014 The Russian War. No long time after the conclusion of the peace of Tilsit, Alex ander began to doubt the prudence of the compact he had made with the French emperor, and the subsequent marriage of Napoleon to an Austrian princess gave him fresh grounds of alarm. The Austrian emperor, however, was not very sincerely attached to his son-in-law ; Napoleon had given his infant son the title of king of Rome, a very plain intimation of his design to retain his hold on Italy. The interests of his subjects, many of whom were almost ruined by the suspension of the trade with Great Britain, compelled Alexander to seek for some relaxation of the restrictive system established by the Berlin decrees, but Napoleon would not abandon his favourite policy, and the discus sions between the courts of St. Petersburgh and Paris began to assume an angry and even hostile tone. Both parties, however, professed an anxious desire for peace, and Napoleon even made overtures to the British government ; but as he refused to restore Spain to its legitimate sovereign, or to withdraw his troops from Prussia, negotiations were fruitless, and both sides prepared for war. Alexander entered into alliance with Sweden and England ; Napoleon arrayed under his banners the military strength of western and southern Europe. But the selfishness of the French emperor in the very outset deprived him of his best security for success ; to secure the aid of Austria, he refused to restore the independence of Poland, and thus lost the hearts of a brave and enthusiastic race of warriors, who would have power fully aided his advance, or effectually covered his retreat. Trust ing to the vast number of his victorious legions, Napoleon crossed the Niemen, routed a division of Cossacks at Kowno, and directed his march to the capital of Lithuania. The Rus sians retired before the French deliberately, wasting the country as they retreated. Several sharp battles were fought without"], [390, "376 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. any important result ; but the hopes of the Russians were raised by the conclusion of a treaty with the Turks, which enabled them to direct all their energies to repel the invaders. Napoleon with his main body directed his march towards Moscow, while a large division of his forces menaced the road to St. Petersburgh. The Russians repelled the latter, but the main force of the invaders advanced to Smolensko, which was justly regarded as the bulwark of Moscow. A dreadful battle was fought under the walls of Smolensko ; it terminated in favour of the French, but they purchased their victory very dearly, and the Russians made an orderly retreat. Kutusoff now assumed the command of the Russians, and resolved to hazard another battle for the protection of Moscow ; he fixed upon a position near the village of Borodino, and there firmly awaited the enemy. The battle was furious and san guinary, nearly seventy thousand of the combatants fell without giving to either side a decisive victory. The Russians indeed maintained their ground; but the French having been joined by new reinforcements, Kutusoff was forced to retreat and abandon Moscow to its fate. This ancient capital of the czars is revered by the Russians, as Jerusalem was by the Jews, they give it the fond name of Mother Moscow, and regard it as the sanctuary of their nation. But when the invaders approached, the citizens resolved not only to abandon their beloved metropolis, but to consign it to the flames. Napoleon entered Moscow, and took up his residence in the Kremlin, the ancient palace of the czars ; but while he was holding a council, fires broke out in various parts of the city, and though many of the incendiaries were shot, it was found impossible to check the conflagration. When the greater part of the city was destroyed, its stores consumed, and all supplies cut off, Napoleon found himself in a very embarrassing position. With great reluctance he gave orders for a retreat, and the French obeyed with so much preci pitation, that they were unable to complete the demolition of Moscow. Before the fugitives had proceeded far on their route, they began to experience the horrors of a Russian winter; thousands became the victims of cold and hunger, while their pursuers taking courage from their calamities, harassed them"], [391, "377 THE RUSSIAN WAR. severely at every step. It had been Napoleon's intention to make a stand at Smolensko, but the magnitude of his losses, the disorganized state of his army, and the increasing want of pro visions, rendered such a course impossible. Once more the French had to undertake a perilous march, amid the rigours of the severest winter ever known, pursued by enraged enemies, deprived of food, of clothing, and of shelter. Language fails to describe the horrors of such a retreat ; every hour added to the miseries of the sufferers ; they lost the discipline of soldiers, and almost the semblance of men. The passage of the Borodino was one of the most terrific scenes recorded in history ; in their eagerness to place the river between themselves and their pur suers, the French rushed in a disorderly crowd over the bridges, under a heavy fire of artillery from the heights behind them. Eight thousand were killed or drowned in this calamitous passage, and long before all had crossed over, Napoleon ordered the bridges to be set on fire, abandoning twelve thousand of his followers to the mercy of the irritated Russians. Napoleon at length resolved to provide for his personal security, and fled to Paris, where indeed some revolutionary attempts rendered his presence necessary ; the miserable remnant of his once mighty host found a precarious shelter in Poland. In the mean time Great Britain was engaged in active hostilities with the United States. The Americans twice invaded Canada, but were defeated ; they were more successful at sea, where the superiority of their frigates in size and weight of metal to the British vessels of the same denomination, secured their victory in some engagements between single ships. But this war attracted comparatively but little attention; every mind was too deeply occupied with the great struggle on the Continent of Europe. The domestic affairs of England, though of importance, did not divert attention from the contest with Napoleon. An unfortunate publicity was given to the discords between the prince regent and his consort ; a bill for emancipating the Catholics was rejected, after having passed several stages, in the House of Commons, and the charter of the East India Company was renewed for twenty years. Notwithstanding his"], [392, "378 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. recent reverses, Napoleon found that he still possessed the con fidence of the French nation, a large conscription was ordered to supply the losses of the late campaign ; and the emperor having provided for the internal security of his dominions, hasted to the north of Europe, where he had to encounter the hostility of a new enemy. It was with great reluctance that the king of Prussia sent an army to serve under Napoleon, and the officers and soldiers of the contingent were far from being anxious for the success of the cause in which they were engaged. During the retreat, one Prussian corps separated itself from the division to which it was attached, and concluded a convention of neutrality; as the Russians advanced, the Prussian monarch took courage to assert his independence, and he entered into alliance with Alexander. But notwithstanding his recent losses, Napoleon had assembled an army numerically superior to those of his adversaries; in three sanguinary battles the French gained the advantage, but they were unable to obtain a decided victory; and Napoleon, alarmed by the magnitude of his losses, and the obstinacy of his enemies, consented to an armistice. During the truce the British government encouraged the allies by large subsidies, and the aid of Sweden was purchased not only by money, but by a promise to aid that power in the acquisition of Norway. But what was of far greater importance, the emperor of Austria was induced to abandon the cause of his son-in-law, and take au active part in the confederation for restraining the power of France. Napoleon, establishing his head-quarters at Dresden, com menced a series of vigorous operations against his several foes. They were at first successful ; but the tide of fortune turned ; several of his divisions were defeated, the Bavarians joined the allies, and at length the baffled emperor retired to Leipsic. Under the walls of this ancient city the battle was fought which decided the fate of Europe (Oct. 18). While the result of the engagement was yet undecided, the Saxon troops in the French service deserted in a body to the allies, and the position thus abandoned was immediately- occupied by the Swedish forces. Napoleon's soldiers, driven from their fines in every direction,"], [393, "THE RUSSIAN WAR. 379 were compelled to seek shelter in Leipsic, but, as the city was incapable of defence, a further retreat became necessary. The French emperor gave the requisite orders, but did not wait to see them executed ; the evacuation of the city was not completed when the allies forced an entrance ; the French, entangled in the streets, suffered very severely, and many were drowned aa they crowded over the narrow bridge, which was their only path of safety. The bridge was blown up before the whole of the fugitives could pass, and this obstruction of the retreat swelled the number of the slain and the captives. The battle of Leipsic liberated Germany ; Napoleon fled to France ; his followers were severely harassed in their retreat, especially as the Bavarians made a vigorous effort to intercept them at Hanau ; their sufferings were very great, and multitudes were made prisoners by the allied armies, as they advanced to the Rhine. Bemadotte was naturally reluctant to join in the meditated invasion of France, but he undertook the task of expelling the enemy from the circle of Lower Saxony. At his approach, the Hanoverians eagerly seized the opportunity of delivering themselves from a foreign yoke, and returning onGe more under the paternal government of the Guelphs. The flame of independence spread to Holland, and kindled even the cold bosoms of the Dutch. Insurrections broke out in the principal towns, the hereditary claims of the house of Orange were rapturously acknowledged, and when the stadtholder arrived from England, he found the Hollanders eager, not only to acknowledge his former power, but to extend it by conferring on him the title of royalty. Whde the allies were thus triumphant in Germany, Wellington was now o-loriously occupied in the liberation of Spain. Early in the spring, he concentrated his forces near Ciudad Rodrigo, and by a series of able movements, compelled the French not only to abandon their positions on the Douro, but to retire beyond the Ebro. Marshal Jourdan, who exercised the real authority, for Joseph was king only in name, resolved to make one vigorous effort for the maintenance of the French power, and chose a strong position near Vittoria as the theatre of a decisive engagement. The allied army advanced with an eager-"], [394, "380 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. ness that ensured success ; the heights that protected the hostile lines were successively stormed, and at length the French were forced to retreat in such disorder, that they abandoned their artillery, baggage, and military chest. In the east of Spain the allies were less successful ; Sir John Murray, on the approach of Marshal Suchet, abandoned the siege of Tarragona with unne cessary precipitation ; but the arrival of Lord William Bentinck prevented the enemy from profiting by this partial success. When the news of the battle of Vittoria reached Napoleon, he sent Marshal Soult from Germany to take the command of the army in Spain, where Pampeluna and St. Sebastian had been invested by Wellington, now raised to the dignity of marquis. Soult's operations were vigorous, but unsuccessful ; his forces were unable to make any impression on the British lines, and so severe was their repulse, that they fled to their own frontiers. St. Sebastian was soon after taken by storm, but not without a very severe loss to the conquerors, and the British now prepared to invade France. The allies crossed the Bidassoa, and advanced slowly but steadily towards Bayonne ; Soult showed great courage and talent in his arrangements, but his efforts were foiled by the superior valour of the British soldiers, and two regiments of Dutch and Germans quitting his lines, went over to the camp of the allies. Spain was now free, but the efforts of the enlightened portion of the cortes to secure its future happiness by the estab lishment of a constitutional government were frustrated by the interested opposition of the clergy, and the ignorant bigotry of the people. The war between Great Britain and the United States con tinued to be maintained with the obstinacy that characterizes the quarrels between \" foes who once were friends ;\" but it was not productive of any important event. The Americans were unsuccessful in their repeated invasions of Canada, but they established their naval superiority on the lakes, while the honour of the British flag was nobly maintained in the engagement between the frigates Chesapeak and Shannon. The memorable year 1814 opened with the invasion of France ; the Russian, Prussian, and Austrian armies forced an entrance"], [395, "381 THE RUSSIAN WAR. through the eastern frontiers, while Wellington was making an alarming progress on the western side. Never, in the hours of his greatest success, did Napoleon display more promptitude and ability ; but he had beaten his enemies into the art of conquering, and even partial success was injurious, because it inspired hopes which prevented him from embracing the proffered opportunities of negotiation. Several furious but indecisive battles were fought ; the allied armies had moved at too great a distance from each other, and it was not until they had suffered severely for their error, that they learned the necessity of a combined plan of operations. But in other quarters the success of the allies was more decided ; Bemadotte completed the liberation of the north of Germany, and not only intimidated the Danish court into an abandonment of the French alliance, but enforced its consent to the transfer of Norway ; thence he marched to the Netherlands, where the allies had made considerable progress, though General Graham had been baffled, with much loss, in an attempt to surprise Bergen-op-Zoom. But Napoleon was much more alarmed by the progress of Wellington in the south-west of France. The English general having driven the French from their posts, crossed the Adour, and invested the citadel of Bayonne. As he advanced, the old partisans of the Bourbons began to revive, the exiled family was proclaimed, and the white flag hoisted, at Bourdeaux. More mortifying was the defection of Murat ; eager to secure his crown, the king of Naples entered into a secret treaty with Austria, and lent his aid in the expulsion of the French from Italy. But in the mean time the fate of France was decided ; Napo leon moved his main army eastwards, hoping to intimidate the allies into a retreat, by threatening their communications. Blucher and Prince Schwartzenberg immediately decided on marching to Paris, and having defeated the forces of Marmont and Mortier, who guarded the road, soon came in sight of that metropolis. The outworks that defended Paris were stormed, and the intimidated citizens hastened to secure their persons and property by a capitulation. The allied sovereigns, Frederic and Alexander, made a triumphant entry into the city (March 31), and were hailed as liberators by the fickle populace."], [396, "382 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. When Napoleon heard that the Austrians had effected a junction with the Prussians, he hasted back to defend his capital, but before he reached Fontainbleau the capitulation had been signed, and a provisional government installed, without any regard to his authority. On the 2d of April he was formally deposed ; and on the 6th of the same month, Louis XVIII. was invited to ascend the throne of his ancestors. A constitutional charter was framed for the protection of the French people, and Napoleon was promised the sovereignty of the island of Elba, and a pension. Before intelligence of these events was received in the south, a sanguinary battle had been fought between the armies of Soult and Wellington at Toulouse, which ended in the complete discomfiture of the former; but the British general sincerely lamented a triumph which had been purchased by a useless expenditure of human life. On the 3d of May Louis XVIII. returned from his tedious exile, and landed at Calais. The preliminaries of a general peace were signed at Paris ; and it was arranged that the details and the adjustment of the claims of the different European princes should be referred to a future convocation at Vienna. Section V. \u2014 History of Europe from the dethronement of Napoleon to the conclusion of the treaty of Vienna. Before his final overthrow, Napoleon liberated the captive Ferdinand, well aware that Spain would have little reason to rejoice in the restoration of such a sovereign. No sooner had he obtained his freedom than he annulled all the proceedings of the cortes, re-established the old despotism with all its abuses, and even revived the horrors of the inquisition. Several of those who had most strenuously resisted the French invasion were punished by imprisonment or exile, their attachment to consti tutional freedom being deemed to outweigh their former services. The allies could not be blamed for the perfidy and tyranny of Ferdinand, but they incurred just censure by aiding in the forcible annexation of Norway to Sweden, against the earnest"], [397, "ESCAPE of NAPOLEON FROM ELBA. 383 remonstrances of the inhabitants, and they displayed little policy in uniting Belgium to Holland, for the countries were opposed to each other in their religious creeds and commercial interests. The American war was protracted more in a spirit of revenue than sound policy ; a sanguinary but indecisive struggle took place in Canada ; an English armament captured Washington, the capital of the United States, and destroyed the public build ings ; but similar attacks on Baltimore and New Orleans were repulsed with great loss. Peace was at length concluded at Ghent, and we may confidently hope that hostilities will never again be renewed between two nations so closely united by the ties of language, religion, and blood. Before this war was terminated, the emperor Alexander, and Frederic, king of Prussia, accompanied by their most distinguished marshals and statesmen, personally visited England, and were received with great enthusiasm. But the convulsion produced in the commercial world by the sudden transition from war to peace, was necessarily followed by numerous bankruptcies and great distress, which threw a shade of gloom over the general joy. The conduct of Louis XVIII. immediately after his accession to the throne, was calculated to win popularity ; but the estab lishment of a censorship over the press, his anxiety to restore the power and influence of the clergy, and to remunerate the loyal emigrants who had shared the calamities of his exile, gave general offence, and revived the courage of the friends of Napoleon. A secret conspiracy was formed for restoring the emperor, and he, dreading that the allied powers, whose plenipotentiaries were assembled at Vienna, would remove him from Elba to a place of greater security, resolved to make a bold effort for the recovery of his throne. Accompanied only by 1100 men, he landed at Frejus (March 1, 1815), and advanced into the interior of the country. At first he received little encouragement ; but being joined by the garrison of Grenoble, and supported by secret promises of aid from other divisions of the army, he proceeded to Lyons, where he held his court. Louis made a spirited appeal to the loyalty of the French nation ; but Marshal Ney havino- set the example of defection, all the soldiery declared in"], [398, "384 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. favour of the emperor; and Louis, compelled to abandon is kingdom, sought safety in Ghent. Though the allied powers had shown a great want of vigi lance and caution in not preventing, as they easily might have done, the escape of Napoleon, they were not for a moment unde termined in resolving on the course of action rendered necessary by that event. A proclamation was issued by the congress of Vienna, denouncing him as the common enemy of Europe, and excluding him from the pale of civil and social relations. A treaty was concluded, by which each of the four powers, Russia, Prussia, Austria, and England, engaged to maintain an army of 150,000 men until they had rendered Napoleon incapable of disturbing the tranquillity of Europe ; and the Prussians and the English at once began to assemble their forces on the northern frontier of France. Napoleon, disappointed in his hope of procuring the acquies cence of the allied powers in his usurpation, prepared boldly to meet the danger by which he was menaced. He gratified the vanity of the Parisians by the splendid ceremonial of proclaim ing a new constitution in the Champ de Mars, and at the same time he made the most vigorous exertions to recruit his armies and supply his military stores. In a short time, far shorter than had been anticipated, his troops were ready for action, and instead of waiting for the attack of his enemies, he resolved to become the aggressor. The first brunt of the war fell on the Prussians, who were driven from their advanced posts. Blucher immediately concentrated his forces at Ligny; while the duke of Wellington, with the British and subsidiary troops, occupied a parallel position at Quatre Bras. The main body of the French attacked the Prussian lines, and after a sanguinary battle compelled Blucher to abandon Ligny (June 16) ; but his retreat was effected in good order, and in a very few hours his troops were ready to renew the fight. In the mean time the British had defeated the enemy at Quatre Bras, but the retreat of the Prussians rendered a corresponding movement necessary on their part ; and Wellington led his army to the memorable position of Waterloo. Flushed by his recent victory over the Prussians, Napoleon,"], [399, "BATTLE OF WATERLOO. 385 on the morning of the 18th of June, appeared in front of the English position, and commenced an attack, in full assurance of success. His first effort was directed against Hougoumont, a post which protected the English right ; but after a murderous conflict, the French were baffled, and the place maintained. The emperor's next effort was to turn the left wing so as to intercept the communication with the Prussians, but this still more signally failed ; Sir Thomas Picton's division, though with_ the loss of their brave commander, repulsed the French infantry, while the Scotch Grays, aided by a corps of dragoons, routed the French cavalry, particularly the cuirassiers, who fondly deemed themselves invincible. A third great effort was made against the centre, and at first some advantages were gained. The French seized the farm of La Haye Sainte, which covered the position, and poured masses of cavalry and infantry on the British lines. But Wellington, forming his troops in hollow squares, maintained a steady resistance, and the efforts of the baffled assailants gradually relaxed. At this moment the Prussian troops began to appear on the right flank of the French, and to take a share in the encasement. Napoleon now mustered his guard for one decisive effort, but did not, as was expected, place himself at their head. The imperial guard advanced under a perfect storm of artillery and musketry from the British lines, which had been gradually advanced after the defeat of the former attacks. They attempted to deploy, under this formidable fire, but their lines were shaken, and they began to fall into confusion. Wellington seized the decisive moment to charge ; the effect was instantaneous, not a sinole French soldier remained to cross a bayonet ; and as the British pressed forward, the retreat was soon a perfect rout. As the English were too much fatigued to pursue the fugitives, that duty devolved upon the Prussians, and they executed it with the vigour of men who felt that they had the wrongs of their country to avenge. Out of the entire French army not more than forty thousand men could again be embodied. Napoleon continued his melancholy flight to Paris, where he soon found that his reign was at an end. He abdicated the crown in favour of his son, but while his resignation was received, s"], [400, "386 THE FRENCH EMPIRE. the acknowledgement of Napoleon II. was evaded. He lino-ered so long in the hope of some favourable change, that his opportunities of escape were cut off, and he was forced to seek refuge on board a British man-of-war. After some discussion respecting his destination, it was resolved that he should be imprisoned for life, in the island of St. Helena ; and to this rock, in the Atlantic Ocean, he was sent, with a small train of attendants. Murat's fate was still more calamitous; no sooner had he heard of Napoleon's landing in France, than he renounced his alliance with Austria, and endeavoured to unite all the Italians in a league against that power. His efforts completely failed ; his forces were routed at Ferrara, the cowardly Neopolitans could not be induced to make any effective resistance, and, finally, he fled, disguised, from his kingdom. His restless ambition induced him, with only thirty followers, to make an effort to recover his dominions; he landed on the Calabrian coast, but was made a prisoner, and shot by sentence of a court-martial. After the victory at Waterloo, the Prussians and the British advanced towards Paris, without encountering any serious opposition. The two legislative chambers were reluctant to restore the king, at least unconditionally, but their appeal to the nation was disregarded, and, on the nearer approach of the allies, a convention was concluded by which Louis was restored. A few of Napoleon's most strenuous supporters were excluded from the act of amnesty ; Ney and Labedoyere were shot, but Lavalette escaped by the aid of his wife and some British officers. The future peace of Europe now depended on the Congress of Vienna, but the decrees of this body were guided more by the convenience of sovereigns than the wishes of nations. The ancient republics of Venice and Genoa were abolished, the territories of the former were given to Austria, while the latter was assigned to the king of Sardinia ; Poland was annexed to the territories of Russia, and the king of Prussia's dominions were enlarged at the expense of the king of Saxony. When these arrangements were completed, the sovereigns of Austria,"], [401, "387 THE HOLY ALLIANCE. Russia, and Prussia, entered into a solemn compact called the Holy Alliance ; the professed object of the treaty was to preserve the peace of Europe, on the principles which God, in his revelation, has pointed out as the source of tranquillity and prosperity. But the contracting parties understood by these principles the maintenance of despotic power, and made their engagement a pretext for resisting the efforts made subsequently, by several nations, to establish constitutional freedom. S 2"], [402, "388 CHAPTER XL HISTORY OF THE PEACE. Section I. \u2014 State of Europe at the close of the War. When the sanguinary and expensive wars arising out of the French revolution terminated, the different nations of Europe that shared in the contest, were so enfeebled and harassed, that they sunk at once into inactive repose. But the transition from war to peace made such a- complete change in all commercial transactions, that credit was shaken, trade injured, manufactures checked, and thousands suddenly deprived of employment. These evils were more sensibly felt in England than in any other country ; for while the tide of war swept over every other European state, England, protected by her insular situation, enjoyed internal tranquillity, and was enabled to sell with profit not only her manufactures, but her agricultural produce, to less favoured countries. Peace permitted the people of the Continent to supply themselves with many of the articles which they had previously been forced to import ; and the jealousy with which the continental sovereigns began to regard the commercial prosperity of England, induced them to encourage native manu factures ; hence the demand for British goods and produce suddenly slackened, and distress was felt by every portion of the community. Several serious riots occurred in the agricul tural districts ; but still more alarming symptoms of dissatisfac tion were displayed in the metropolis, where meetings were held under pretence of procuring a reform in the constitution, but which threatened to end in revolution. Several strong restrictive statutes were passed by parliament, and energetic, if not severe, measures adopted by the government ; it was not, however, until the commercial crisis had passed over, and the embarrass-"], [403, "389 STATE OF EUROPE AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR. ments of transition disappeared, that the public tranquillity was restored. There were not, however, wanting more cheering occurrences which relieved the gloom ; the piratical states of Algiers were humbled ; Lord Exmouth, with a united squadron of English and Dutch, attacked the city of Algiers, destroyed its fortifica tions, and compelled the Dey to abolish Christian slavery (1816). Great joy was also diffused by the marriage of the Princess Charlotte, the pride and the hope of England, to Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg. But the expectations of the nation were fatally disappointed ; the princess died on the 6th of November, 181 7, after having been delivered of a dead child. The national sorrow was general and profound, and there never was an occasion in which the British nation showed greater regret for the loss of an individual. But this was only the beginning of a series of deaths in the royal family ; Queen Charlotte died during the ensuing year, she was soon followed to the grave by the duke of Kent, and, finally, the aged monarch George III., without having enjoyed one lucid interval, during his long illness, sunk quietly into the tomb. France, much to the surprise of the neighbouring states, enjoyed the blessings of tranquillity under the mild and conciliatory government of Louis XVIII. The revolution, and its consequent wars, had given the chief property of the country, and consequently the elements of political power, to the middle classes of society ; their interests could only be secured by the preservation of peace, and they became zealous royalists, because they regarded the monarchy as the surest pledge for the maintenance of public order. Some of them carried their zeal o such extravagant lengths that they provoked resistance, and the king was forced to interfere, to prevent the ill consequences that were likely to result from the indiscretion of those who claimed to be his best friends. The united kingdom of the Netherlands, though apparently tranquil, was secretly shaken by the national antipathy between the Belo-ians and the Dutch. Gratitude induced the sovereign to accede to the Holy Alliance, a circumstance which gave great offence to many of his subjects, especially in Flanders, where a"], [404, "390 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. republican spirit, fostered by municipal institutions, had pre vailed from the time of the Middle Ages. Great disappointment was felt, in Germany, by the delay or refusal of the constitutions, w-hich the several states had been taught to expect during the war of independence. But the principal sovereigns, especially the emperor of Austria and the king of Prussia, alarmed by the remembrance of the calamities that political innovations had produced in France, steadily opposed every change in the forms of government, but, at the same time, zealously laboured to secure to their subjects the benefit of a just and enlightened administration. Spain was far more unfortunate; the imbecile Ferdinand was the^ tool of the courtiers and the priests ; at their instigation he revived the ancient principles of despotism and bigotry, pun ishing with remorseless severity every expression of liberal sentiments in politics or religion. The arbitrary conduct of the court was not the only cause of the misery that prevailed in the Peninsula ; the South American colonies, which had long been regarded as the chief and almost the only source of the small share of commercial prosperity which the Spaniards retained, openly revolted and raised the standard of independence. Ferdinand made some faint efforts to subdue the insurgents, but he was badly supported by his subjects, and the troops he had assembled refused to embark. Finally, the liberals having gained over a great portion of the army, compelled the king to establish a democratic constitution, by w\"hich the royal power was almost annihilated (1820). Similar revolutions took place in Portugal, Naples, and Piedmont ; alarm seized the minds of the European sovereigns, and they secretly combined to check popular movements. But experience soon proved that those who had framed the Spanish constitution were ignorant of the wants and wishes of the Spanish people ; Louis XVIIL, alarmed for the safety of France by the revolutionary move ments in Spain, sent an army, under the command of the duke of Angouleme to restore the royal authority ; the invaders encountered no effective opposition ; the cortes fled before them to Cadiz, and when the French approached that city they permitted the king to resume his former despotic authority (1823)."], [405, "STATE OF EUROPE AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR. 391 The revolutions of Naples and Piedmont ended similarly ; the liberals laid down their arms on the approach of the Austrian armies, and the new constitutions were abolished. The accession of Charles John Bemadotte, to the crown of Sweden, made no change in the politics of the northern nations ; his right of inheritance had been solemnly recognized by the allied sovereigns, at the Congress of Vienna, and his conduct as crown-prince had taught the Swedes to respect and love the monarch they had chosen. Even the Norwegians became reconciled to their fate, and learned to console themselves for the loss of national independence by the blessings that result from paternal government. No sooner was peace restored between Great Britain and the United States than the old feelings of friendship and kindred revived between the two countries, and the leading statesmen, in both, showed an earnest desire to have former animosities buried in oblivion. But far different were the feelings between Spain and her revolted colonies ; the South American states vigorously maintained their struggle for independence, and finally succeeded. The English government delayed acknow ledging these republics until the duke of Angouleme had crossed the Pyrenees, when consuls were sent out to the chief states, and commercial treaties formed with their governments. From this rapid sketch, it will be seen that throughout the greater part of the civilized world there was a stmggle between the principles of monarchy and democracy, and that even Eng land, though it had long enjoyed the blessings of a free constitu tion, was not wholly exempt from the agitation. Section II. \u2014 History of England during the reign of George IV. George IV. had so long reigned under the title of regent, that no political change was expected when he assumed the royal dionity. Indeed, his formal accession attracted little notice until the unfortunate results of his marriage revived all the"], [406, "392 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. violence of party animosity. The queen had resided for some years on the Continent ; reports very unfavourable to her character and conduct were circulated, and the ministers, be lieving that she had behaved unworthily, refused her the title of queen, and omitted her name in the Liturgy. Stung by these insults, she refused every offer of compromise and came to England, where her cause was warmly espoused by the multitude. \" A Bill of Pains and Penalties,\" annulling her marriage and depriving her of her dignities, was introduced into the House of Lords, and a public investigation was com menced, which led to the most revolting disclosures. After a long struggle, the ministers, unable to overcome the conscientious scruples to the divorce entertained by many of their warmest supporters, abandoned the measure, and the queen's friends celebrated her escape as an acquittal. But her popularity- sank as rapidly as it had risen ; the king would not permit her to partake in the honours of the coronation, and as her appeals to the nation produced little effect, she sunk under the sense of her degradation, and soon ended her unhappy fife. Her funeral wras marked by a disgraceful riot ; the mob determined that her remains should be paraded through the city, and triumphed over the troops that tried to carry the hearse by a different route. The death of Napoleon soon followed ; during the earlier part of his residence in St. Helena, he seems to have entertained some hope of making his escape, and his friends were indefati gable in contriving plans for his liberation. But when project after project failed, he yielded to despair ; the anguish of his mind accelerated the progress of hereditary disease, and he died of a cancer in the stomach. His body was buried at St. Helena, with military honours. The king, to gratify his subjects, paid a visit to Ireland, to Scotland, and to Hanover; he was received everywhere with the greatest enthusiasm, but the results of these visits were not so permanent as might have been anticipated. In Ireland, the violence of party burst forth with renewed violence after his majesty's departure, and agrarian outrages were so numerous that it became necessary to enact severe coercive laws. While"], [407, "393 REIGN OF GEORGE IV. the king was in Scotland, the marquis of Londonderry, who had long been the ministerial leader in the House of Com mons, committed suicide ; he was succeeded by Mr. Canning, who was generally believe:! to be more favourable to liberal measures and opinions than his predecessor. During a long period little of importance occurred in Britain ; the emancipation of the catholics, the removal of restrictions on trade, and the condition of the slaves in the West Indian colonies, frequently engaged the attention of the legislature, but no change was made in any of the laws except those that fettered commerce. The wars with the Burmese in Asia, and the Ashantees on the African coast, were sanguinary ; but they terminated favourably to the British interests, and contributed greatly to secure our colonies in these two divisions of the globe. The accumulation of wealth, during the peace, led to a number of wild and ruinous speculations, which must ever render the year 1825 fatally memorable in the commercial annals of Britain. The most extraordinary projects for realizing fortunes were pro posed, and joint-stock companies formed for their accomplish ment ; but in a short time their fallacious nature was exposed, and thousands, who had invested their money in shares, were totally ruined. This was, however, but a transient calamity; the alarm pro duced by repeated bankruptcies subsided, and commercial credit was restored. It may even be said that the panic produced some beneficial effects, by directing attention to those branches of trade best suited to the condition of the country. Ireland did not, like England, return to a state of tranquillity; the catholics, irritated by the delay of emancipation, formed an association for enforcing their claims. This body assembled in Dublin, but it had active agents throughout the country ; the catholic priests especially exerted themselves to forward the objects of the association, and their interference added religious rancour to political animosity. In three out of the four pro vinces into which Ireland is divided, the power usually exercised by the Irish aristocracy at elections was crumbled into dust by the new confederacy, and the popular party returned most of the members. Such a state of things excited just alarm, especially s3"], [408, "394 HISTORY OF TOE PEACE. as the Catholic Association had adopted all the forms of a legis ative assembly, and showed some inclination to interfere with the functions of government. The cabinet was divided on the subject ; Mr. Canning and his friends were disposed to conciliate the catholics by the concession of their claims, but the premier (the earl of Liverpool) and many others believed such a proceeding inconsistent with the Protestant Constitution as established by the Revolution of 1688. Soon after Mr. Canning's accession to power, the attention of all Europe was excited by an event which seemed to prove that England had not only deserted the principles of the Holy Alliance, hut was about to take her position at the head of a more liberal political system. On the death of John VI., king of Portugal, March 10, 1826, the crown devolved to his eldest son, Don Pedro, who reigned, with the title of emperor, over the old Portuguese colonies in Brazil. Compelled to choose between his empire and his kingdom, Pedro selected the former ; but he sent to Portugal a constitutional charter, and a formal resignation of the crown in favour of his daughter Donna Maria. Pedro's brother, Don Miguel, the queen dowager, and the most bigoted portion of the clergy, laboured to frustrate this arrangement, and their machinations were encouraged by the French and Spanish cabinets. Several Portuguese regiments were induced to desert across the frontier and proclaim Don Miguel absolute king. As the Spanish government notoriously supplied the rebels with military stores aud arms, the Portuguese minister applied to the British government for aid, and a message was sent to both houses of parliament, calling on them to aid in maintaining the independence of Portugal. Mr. Canning intro- duced the subject in the House of Commons, describing the situation and policy of Great Britain, placed as a mediator between the conflicting opinions that convulsed Europe, and such was the effect of his eloquence, that only four persons in a full house could be got to oppose the address. A British arma ment was sent to the Tagus : its effect was instantaneous and decisive. The French diplomatic agent was recalled, the Spanish cabinet forced to desist from its intrigues, and Portugal restored to temporary tranquillity."], [409, "395 REIGN OF GEORGE IV. The death of the duke of York, followed soon after by that of the earl of Liverpool, rendered it necessary to make some important change in the cabinet. The ministry had hitherto consisted of parties nicely balanced, under a nominal leader, and was held together solely by the temporizing and conciliatory policy of the earl of Liverpool ; his death rendered it necessary to adopt some decisive system. A majority of the House of Commons, and the greater part of the manufacturing and monied interests, favoured the pretensions of Mr. Canning ; but he was opposed by the most powerful portion of the aristocracy, and many of his secret enemies possessed the confidence of the king. After a long struggle, Mr. Canning received his Majesty's com mands to form an administration, upon which six of his colleagues simultaneously resigned. The struggle of parties was fiercely maintained during the session, but soon after its close, Mr. Canning sank under the mental fatigue of the contest, and died generally lamented. Lord Goderich succeeded to the office of premier ; his cabinet was torn by internal dissensions, and was at the same time powerfully assailed. The battle of Navarino, to which we shall recur in the next section, completed the premier's embar rassment, and the ministry was dissolved before the meeting of parliament. A new administration was formed, under the auspices of the duke of Wellington, in which several of Mr. Cannino's friends were included ; but they were soon forced to resign on account of the numerous political differences between them and their colleagues. The duke of Wellington's cabinet had been formed at the instigation of the most influential part of the aristocracy, to check the progress of innovation, and stop the progress of those measures which were supposed to threaten the supremacy, if not the safety of the Established Church, But in the very first year of its existence, the ministry was forced to consent to the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts; a measure which tended to give fresh vigour to the efforts made by the Irish catholics to procure emancipation. They acted with unex pected vio-our ; a vacancy having occurred in the representation of the county of Clare, Mr. O'Connell, a catholic barrister, offered"], [410, "396 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. himself as a candidate, in spite of the disqualifying laws, and was elected by a triumphant majority. The government was now in a strange dilemma; the temper of the times forbade their returning to the old system of penal laws, and to allow things to remain in their present situation would be virtually to resign the government of Ireland to the Catholic Association. The difficulty was not diminished by the partisans of protestant ascendancy, who formed themselves into Brunswick clubs, and rivalled their adversaries in violent language. At length, in the beginning of 1 829, it was declared that emancipation should be conceded ; a bill for the removal of the restricting statutes affecting the catholics was brought Do a into parliament ; and as it was supported by the whole weight of ministerial influence, it was carried through both houses by large majorities. From this time forward the interest of most public questions was absorbed in the alarming indisposition of the king. The disease by which he was attacked, ossification of the heart, w7as incurable ; but his life was protracted by the skill of his medical attendants. He expired on the 26th of June, 1830 ; and was succeeded by his brother, the duke of Clarence, under the title of William IV. An impartial character of George IV. cannot be drawn while so many of those who acted with and under him are still alive ; but it may be safely said that his errors arose from the peculiarities of his position, while to himself alone belong all the merits of his many brilliant and noble qualities. Section III. \u2014 General History of Europe, from the overthrow of the Spanish Constitution, to the French Revolution of 1830. When Ferdinand was restored to power by the intervention of a French army, he began to persecute the chief supporters of the late constitution, and paid little heed to the remonstrances of his deliverers. He readily submitted to the occupation of his garrisons by French troops, but he would not listen to any lessons of moderation from the cabinet cf Paris. The death of"], [411, "THE GREEK REVOLUTION. 397 Louis XVIII., and the peaceful accession of Charles X., gave fresh courage to the court of Madrid, for Charles was believed to be as much under the influence of a bigoted priesthood as Fer dinand himself. But it was forgotten that the French nation would not, like the Spaniards, long submit to ecclesiastical domination ; Charles X. had not been more than a few months on the throne, when his conduct produced evident signs of discontent among his subjects. A sanguinary contest in the East of Europe must now engage our attention; the Greeks, who had been for many centuries the wretched slaves of the Turks, had never forgotten the fame of their ancestors, and frequently meditated resistance to the ferocious tyranny under which they suffered. Their hopes were secretly encouraged by the sovereigns of Russia, who merely used them as tools to create a diversion in the Turkish wars, and then on the return of peace abandoned them to the ven geance of their irritated task-masters. They hoped for some change in their condition from the Congress of Vienna, but being disappointed, they formed a secret association, called the Het\u00e6ria, by which they engaged with each other to strike for freedom, whenever an opportunity should offer. In 1817, Czerni George, a Servian chieftain, made a feeble effort to raise a revolt, but he was betrayed by a pretended friend, and executed. Four years later Alexander Ypselanti placed himself at the head of some insurgents in Moldavia, but he was overwhelmed by superior forces, and compelled to seek refuge in the Austrian dominions, where he was thrown into prison. The Turks, enraged by this revolt, in which they pretended that all the Greeks were implicated, commenced a horrible series of persecutions and massacres, which drove the Greeks to take arms in their own defence. In the Morea they gained several advantao-es, but they showed that they were as barbarous as their oppressors, by murdering the entire population of Tripo lizza. The struggle, thus commenced, was continued with savao-e fury on both sides. The Greeks frequently triumphed by sea ; but on land they suffered several reverses, chiefly in consequence of the unskilfulness and mutual jealousies of their leaders. Much interest was excited by this struggle in every"], [412, "398 HISTORY OF TOE PEACE. part of Christendom, and several adventurous spirits tendered their aid in defence of Grecian independence. The most dis tinguished of these volunteers was the great English poet Lord Byron, who took five hundred men into his pay ; but before he could take any effective measures, he fell a victim to a rheumatic fever. It was expected that the emperor Alexander would have taken some step to protect the Greeks, but he died prematurely while engaged in a survey of his southern provinces. Unable to quell the insurgents of the Morea by his own strength, Sultan Mahmoud sought the aid of his powerful vassal, Mohammed Ali, pacha of Egypt. This provincial governor, who had acted for some time more like an independent sove reign than a vassal, readily sent his son, Ibrahim Pacha, with a formidable army, into the Morea, and his progress was so great that the cause of the Greeks seemed to be hopeless. But the European powers had now resolved to interfere in behalf of their Christian brethren, and put an end to a sanguinary contest which, during six years, had proved ruinous to the commerce of the Levant. A treaty was concluded at London between the Russian, French, and English governments, by which it was stipulated that Greece should enjoy a qualified independence under the sovereignty of Turkey ; and that if the sultan refused compliance, measures of hostility should be adopted to enforce his consent. The Austrian cabinet not only refused to act in concert with the other powers, but secretly urged the court of Constantinople to reject the proffered compromise. But the sultan, eager for the destruction of the revolters, needed not to be urged farther by the court of Vienna; he peremptorily rejected the proposals of the allies, and made the most vigorous exertions to complete the subjugation of Greece. A powerful Egyptian squadron entered the harbour of Navarino ; and when the unfavourable answer of the Turkish government was known, the allied fleets blockaded the Egyptians. At the same time a large- Russian army was collected on the frontiers, and two Russian ships of war a]3peared in the Hellespont, but the snltau continued obsti nate, and set every remonstrance at defiance. Sir Edward Codrington, the commander of the allied squadrons, concluded"], [413, "399 BATTLE OF NAVARINO. au armistice with Ibrahim Pacha, the Egyptian admiral; it was flagrantly violated by the latter in every particular, and the allies entered the harbour of Navarino, resolved to enforce its stipulations. A shot fired by a Turkish ship at an English boat brought on a general engagement, which ended in the utter annihilation of the Egyptian armament. So far was the intelli gence of this decisive proceeding from intimidating the sultan, that it seemed rather to confirm his obstinacy; after many ineffectual efforts to change his resolution, the ambassadors of France, England, and Russia, demanded their passports, and quitted Constantinople, a proceeding which was of course tanta mount to a declaration of war. In Russia and in France the victory of Navarino was regarded as a national triumph ; in England it only increased the embar rassments of Lord Goderich's distracted cabinet, the members of which were at variance on almost every point of policy, foreign and domestic. Finding themselves unable to determine in what manner the event should be noticed in the king's speech, the ministers resigned their situations before the meeting of parlia ment, and the task of forming a new administration was in trusted to the duke of Wellington. Many of Mr. Canning's friends remained in office under the duke of Wellin o-ton, and thus tacitly passed a censure on their former course of policy. In the king's speech, the battle of Navarino was called, what it really was, \" an untoward event ;\" but the phrase led to a general, though groundless suspicion, that the cause of Turkey was likely to find more favour with the new cabinet than that of Greece, and this circumstance tended greatly to precipitate the war between Russia and Turkey. In the House of Commons the ministers suffered a remarkable defeat ; Lord John Russell's motion for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts was carried by so large a majority, that the ministers deemed it prudent to abstain from further opposition, and the measure thus sanctioned passed both houses with little difficulty. It was expected that the same favour would be shown to the Roman catholics which had been extended to the other dissenters, but the Lords rejected a bill for that purpose ; and soon after, the removal of Mr. Huskisson, and the rest of Mr. Canning's friends,"], [414, "400 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. from office, seemed to prove that the ministers were resolved to maintain the protestant character of the British constitution inviolate. While England remained tranquil, fierce contentions arose in Ireland, which seemed to threaten dangerous consequences, scarcely short of the calamities of civil war. The leaders of the Roman catholics, with more discretion than they usually exhi bited, suspended the meetings of their association during Mr. Can ning's administration, convinced that agitation might embarrass their friends without advancing their cause. Distrusting not the intentions but the firmness of Lord Goderich, they resumed their meetings after he became premier ; but when the reins of power were intrusted to the duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel, the pledged opponents of their claims, they laid aside every semblance of moderation, employing every means which the constitution would permit, and some of a very doubtful cha racter, to harass and oppose the ministry and its supporters. Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald having been appointed to office, vacated his seat for the county of Clare ; and, as he was deservedly popular, no doubt was entertained of his re-election. The Catholic Association, however, resolved that he should be opposed, as the supporter of the duke of Wellington ; and Mr. O'Connell, the head of that body, came forward as a rival can didate, pledging his professional reputation, that if elected, he could legally take his seat. It is not easy to explain how any lawyer could venture to give such a pledge, but the peasantry of Ireland would have believed much greater absurdities on the same authority ; the freeholders of Clare, organized by their priests, and by itinerant orators sent down for the purpose, crowded to the poll to vote for the popular candidate, and, after a brief contest, Mr. Fitzgerald resigned, and Mr. O'Connell was duly elected. The effect of this struggle was electrical ; the Roman catholics prepared to follow up their victory by issuing a schedule of pledges to be proposed in future to every candidate for an Irish county or borough ; on the other hand, the sup porters of protestant ascendancy formed themselves into Bruns wick clubs, in which they rivalled the violence and intemperance of their opponents. During the greater part of the autumn of"], [415, "REVOLUTION IN PORTUGAL. 401 1828, nothing but the catholic question was heard in public or private discussions throughout Great Britain. Signs of an approaching convulsion were also discernible in France; the administration of M. de Villele was driven out because it had lent itself to the despotic designs of the court, and the bigoted intentions of the Church : the heads of the Romish priesthood in France seem indeed to have mistaken the century, and to have regulated their conduct by the principles of the dark ages, instead of consulting the growing spirit and intelligence of the nation. The new ministers forced upon the king by the triumph of the popular party, prose ssed moderate principles, and possessed a very moderate share of abilities. They were driven by the majority of the chambers to make larger additions to the popular privileges tha n they intended ; and in their foreign relations they were compelled to adopt a very different course of policy from their predecessors. They sent an armament to the Morea to enforce the surrender of the fortresses still retained by the Turks and Egyptians ; they recalled the French army of occupation from Spain, and they recognised the independence of the South American States. A revolution of a very different character took place in Portu gal. When Don Pedro resigned the throne of that kingdom in favour of his daughter, Donna Maria de Gloria, he appointed his brother Don Miguel regent, reasonably hoping that he might thus secure his daughter's rights, and the constitutional privileges which he had given to the Portuguese. Before quitting Vienna to assume the reins of power, Don Miguel took an oath of fidelity to the charter ; when he visited England, on his way to Portugal, he repeated his protestations of attachment to the constitution, and the rights of his niece, so warmly, that the British statesmen, assured of his fidelity, consented to withdraw their troops from Lisbon. Unfortunately, after his return, Don Miguel resigned himself to the guidance of the queen mother, an unprincipled woman, who seemed to think that a bigoted zeal for what she believed to be the cause of religion would atone for every other crime. At her instigation, he induced the fanatic rabble, by means of an artful priesthood, to proclaim him abso lute king, and to denounce the charter as inconsistent with the"], [416, "402 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. purity of the Roman faith. The friends of the constitution organized a resistance at Oporto and in the island of Madeira, but their efforts were badly directed and worse supported. They were finally defeated aud driven into exile, while Don Miguel commenced a bitter persecution against all who had been con spicuous for their advocacy of liberal opinions. The principal pow-ers of Europe manifested their detestation of such treachery by withdrawing their ambassadors from the court of Lisbon. England and France were not unconcerned spectators of the great contest between Russia and Turkey, though they did not directly interfere. The campaign appeared to be unfavourable to Russia, for, though Varna was taken by the treachery of its governor, the Russians w-ere forced to raise the siege of Shumlah, and retire with some precipitation. But they were more suc cessful in Asia, where the true strength of the Turkish empire lay ; they conquered a great part of ancient Armenia, and thus laid the foundation of decisive success in the ensuing campaign. Early in the year 1829, the public mind was agitated by rumours that the ministers had succeeded in extorting from the king a reluctant assent to the important measure usually called Catholic Emancipation. The supporters of protestant ascendancy at first discredited the report ; but when the measure was announced in the king's speech, they expressed their indignation in no measured terms. They were particularly violent against Mr., now Sir Robert Peel, who had long been their favourite, as he was their most eloquent champion. That gentleman having resolved to give the constituency of Oxford an oppor tunity of expressing their opinions respecting his change of principles, resigned his seat, but he faded in procuring his re-election. The first measure introduced into the House of Commons was a bill for the suppression of the Catholic Asso ciation ; it was not opposed, because the friends of the catholics deemed the law necessary to the success of the more important measure of emancipation, and every reasonable man in the empire was weary of the blustering and vituperation which formed the staple of the oratory of the Irish agitators. The debates on the emancipation bill occupied the greater part of the session ; it passed both houses of parliament by larger majo-"], [417, "WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND TURKEY. 403 rities than had been anticipated, and finally received the royal assent. Soon after, Mr. O'Connell appeared to claim his seat for Clare, and was of course rejected; a new writ was issued, and he was elected a second time without opposition. Tranquillity was not restored to Ireland as had been expected ; the irritation of Mr. O'Connell at his exclusion, and the indignation of the leaders of the Orange party at their recent defeat, became the sources of fresh disunion, and in some instances of collisions, which did not terminate without bloodshed. Popular discontent was greatly increased in France by the formation of a new ministry, under Prince Polignac, who was a zealous supporter of the monarchical and ecclesiastical power. In every part of France a formidable opposition was organized, remonstrances were sent to the king, which were contemptuously disregarded, and appeals were made to popular passions and prejudices, which seemed to threaten very dangerous conse quences. Polignac thought that by gratifying the national vanity of the French, and indulging their passion for military glory, he might be able to divert their attention from domestic politics, and he therefore took advantage of the outrages perpe trated by the dey of Algiers to declare war against that barba rous potentate. In the mean time Turkey narrowly escaped being blotted from the map of Europe. The Russians opened the campaign by surprising Sizopoli and laying siege to Silistria. The grand vizier advanced to the relief of the fortress, but he was surprised on his march by Marshal Diebitsch and defeated. In this battle the Turks behaved so courageously that the Russians almost despaired of success, and made an attempt to open negotiations. Their offers were rejected, the vizier trusting to his impregnable position at Shumlah, remained quietly in his intrenchments, while the Russians pressed forward the siege of Sdistria. That city surrendered on the last day of June, but it was the middle of July before Diebitsch could concentrate his forces for the bold enterprise which decided the fortune of the war. Having masked Shumlah with one division of his forces, he forced a passage through the defiles of the Balkan, and took Aidos by storm. The vizier, alarmed by this unexpected movement,"], [418, "404 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. determined to remove his quarters to Salamno. He was encountered by Diebitsch on his march, and irretrievably defeated. The very soldiers who had so recently fought the Russians for seventeen hours, now scarcely withstood them for as many minutes ; they fled at the first onset, abandoning arms, ammu nition, artillery, and baggage. Adrianople, the second city in the Turkish empire, was captured without firing a shot ; Stam boul itself must have fallen had not the sultan consented to the terms of peace dictated by the conquerors. He signed a treaty on the 1 4th of September, by which he recognised the indepen dence of Greece, and granted to Russia very considerable advan tages, and a guarantee for the payment of the expenses of the war. Greece indeed was already virtually free ; the French expedition had recovered the fortresses of the Morea from the Turks and Egyptians, while the Greeks themselves had gained considerable advantages in the north. It was resolved that the final destinies of the country should be arranged by a congress of the great powers in London ; the crown of Greece was first offered to Prince Leopold, the relict of the late Princess Charlotte, but after a long negotiation, he rejected it, and it was finally bestowed on Prince Otho, the son of the king of Bavaria. The early part of the year 1830 was marked by few events of importance in England, the interest of all other public matters having been absorbed in the alarming indisposition of the king. After enduring the agonies of an incurable disease with great fortitude, George IV. expired on the 26th of June, and was succeeded by his brother the duke of Clarence. Rarely has a new monarch at once gained such popularity as William IV. in the first week after his accession. Unlike his predecessor, his habits were economical, and his manners familiar. He took a pleasure in exhibiting himself to the people, and proving that he shared in their tastes and amusements. No immediate change was made in the ministry ; but, as the new monarch was intimately connected with several leaders of the whig party, it was generally supposed that the exclusive system which had been maintained by his father and brother Would be abandoned for the future. Indeed it had been generally expected that a coalition would have been effected between the duke of"], [419, "CAPTURE OF ALGIERS. 405 Wellington and the whigs, after catholic emancipation had been granted, but such hopes were abandoned when parliament met after the demise of the crown. In the debate on the address, the minister was violently assailed by the whigs, and by the old supporters of protestant ascendancy ; the language of the orators was so bitter and personal that no reconciliation could be effected, but the king did not share in the hostility directed against his minister. The cabinet of Polignac was still more virulently assailed in France ; indeed the ferocity and violence of the attacks to which it was subjected have no parallel in the political struggles of constitutional governments. One half of the topics selected by the prince's opponents, as themes of invective, were downright falsehoods, and many of them were so exquisitely absurd, that they seemed invented for the special purpose of measuring the extent of popular credulity. Polignac defied the storm, or rather he furnished his adversaries with just grounds for con tinued hostility. When the chambers assembled, the royal speech was a direct attack on the first principles of contitutional government, and it concluded with a threat which was notori ously impotent, and therefore ridiculous. The debate that ensued was very animated, and ended in the adoption of a very uncourtly address, by a majority of forty votes. A change of ministry was now the only means by which the French monarch could reconcile himself to the nation ; but Charles X., with characteristic obstinacy, resolved to retain his cabinet, trusting that the success of the expedition against Algiers, by o-ratifying the military vanity of the French, might restore his popularity. Every possible means were taken to ensure the reduction of Algiers, and they were completely successful. The city was taken after a slight resistance, the dey was sent a prisoner to Italy, and his vast treasures remained at the disposal of the conquerors. Polignac took advantage of the crisis, and dissolved the chambers, but, with the same infatuation which seems to have directed all his movements, he, at the same time, dismissed the only two moderate members of the cabinet, and supplied their places by the most unpopular men in France. The elections left"], [420, "406 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. the ministry in a miserable minority, and matters were conse quently brought to a crisis. Polignac and his colleagues had to adopt some decisive course, and they boldly resolved to subvert the constitution. On the morning of the 26th of July, three ordinances were published, by which the Charter of the nation's liberties w-as virtually annihilated. The first dissolved the Chamber of Deputies before it assembled ; the second changed the law of elections and disfranchised the great body of the electors ; and the third subjected the press to new and severe restrictions. It was late in the day before intelligence of these events was generally circulated through Paris, and the news, at first, seemed to excite astonishment rather than indignation ; the ministers passed the day in quiet at their hotels, receiving the visits of their friends and congratulating themselves upon the delusive tranquillity. But their opponents were not inactive ; expresses were sent to summon all the deputies of their party within reach, and those who had already arrived in Paris held a private meeting to concert measures of resistance. The principal journalists acted with still greater promptitude, they prepared and published a protest against the restrictions on the press, whose daring language would probably have exposed them to the penalties of treason had the contest terminated differently. On the morning of the 27th, few of the journals appeared, for the publication of those which were not sanctioned by the minister of the interior was prohibited by the police. The printers, thus suddenly deprived of employment, formed a body of vindictive rioters, and their numbers were increased by the closing of several large factories in the suburbs of Paris. The proprietors of two journals printed their papers in defiance of the ordinance, and the first disturbance was occasioned by the police forcing an entrance into their establishments, breaking the presses, scattering the types, and rendering the machinery unserviceable. So little was an insurrection anticipated, that Charles X., accompanied by the dauphin, went on a hunting match to Rambouillet ; and his ministers neglected the ordinary precaution of strengthening the garrison of the capital. It was only on the morning of the 27th, that Marmont received his"], [421, "FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1830. 407 appointment as military governor of Paris, and it was not till after four in the afternoon that orders were given to put the troops under arms. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening, some detach ments of troops were sent to the aid of the police ; this was the signal for commencing the contest, several smart skirmishes took place between the citizens and the soldiers, in which the latter were generally successful, so that Marmont wrote a letter to the king, congratulating him on the suppression of the riots, while the ministers issued their last ordinance, declaring Paris in a state of siege. When night closed in, the citizens destroyed every lamp in the city, thus securing the protection of darkness for their preparations to renew the struggle. On the morning of the 28th, Marmont was astonished to find the citizens prepared for war. They were in possession of the arsenal and the powder magazine, they had procured arms from the shops of the gunsmiths, the theatres, and the police stations, and had erected barricades across the principal streets. It was noon before Marmont had resolved how to act, and he then divided his troops into four columns, which he unwisely separated, so as to prevent their acting in concert. After a series of murderous conflicts, which lasted the whole day, the troops were beaten at every point, and when they returned to their barracks no provision was made for their refreshment, while every family in Paris vied in supplying the insurgents with everything they needed. Marmont's representations to the infatuated king of the danger of the crisis, failed to produce any effect, and the contest was renewed on the third day. But two regiments of the line havino- gone over to the insurgents in a body, the populace, thus strengthened, took the Louvre by assault, and soon compelled the troops that remained faithful to the royal cause, either to lay down their arms or evacuate Paris. The revolution was now complete ; a provisional government was appointed by the members of the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, and Charles X. deserted by his friends, and abandoned even by his servants, was dismissed to contemptuous exile by the national commis sioners. Finally, the duke of Orleans was chosen lieutenant-"], [422, "408 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. general of the kingdom, and, on the assembling of the chambers, was elevated to the throne by the title of Louis Philippe L, king of the French. Section IV. \u2014 History of Europe during the reign of William IV. There were many enthusiastic young men in France anxious to establish a republic, but the great body of the nation had too vivid a remembrance of the horrors of the first revolution to favour such a project. Louis Philippe was looked upon by the middle classes as the pledge of secured liberty and restored tranquillity, and they were satisfied when the constitutional rights of the people were extended, by some modifications of the charter, and by a total separation of the church from the state. But the new monarch was far from finding his revolutionary throne a bed of roses ; his sovereignty, indeed, wras recognised by all the European powers except Russia, whose acknowledge ment of a king, elected by the people, was reluctant and ungracious; at home, however, there were dangers on every side of him, which taxed to the utmost all his firmness and all his talent. His success would have been doubtful but for the efficient support he received from the national guard, whose organization was rapidly completed in Paris and the provinces. This civic body repressed the riots of the workmen and artisans, broke up the meetings of revolutionary clubs, and frustrated the attempts of republican fanatics, without incurring the odium which would have been attached to the exertions of the police and military. The severest test to which the stability of the new government in Paris was exposed, arose from the trials of the ministers who had signed the fatal ordinances. Louis Philippe made no effort to seize these delinquents, and would probably have been rejoiced at their escape ; four of them were, however, arrested by some zealous patriots, at a distance from Paris, as they were endeavouring to escape under the protection of false passports; the government had no option, but was forced to"], [423, "409 REIGN OF WILLIAM IV. send them for trial before the Chamber of Peers. The partisans of anarchy took advantage of the popular excitement to raise formidable riots, which might have terminated in a new and sanguinary revolution, but for the zeal and firmness of the national guard. After an impartial trial, Polignac and his com panions were condemned to perpetual imprisonment and civil death, and were quickly removed from the capital to a distant prison. Tranquillity was re-established on the morning of the third day after the trial, and the citizens of Paris demonstrated the extent of their late alarms by the brilliant illuminations with which they celebrated the restoration of order. The excitement produced by the French revolution was felt throughout Europe, but nowhere did it produce such effect as in Belgium, whose compulsory union with Holland was one of the most unwise arrangements of the Congress of Vienna. The Dutch and Flemings differed in language, in habits, and in religion ; their commercial interests were opposed, their national antipathies were ancient and inveterate. In the midst of the anxieties produced by the events in Paris, the Dutch ministers continued to goad the Belgians by restrictive laws, and at length drove them into open revolt. On the night of the 25th of Auo-ust, a formidable riot began in Brussels; the Dutch autho rities and garrison, after having exhibited the most flagrant proofs of incapacity and cowardice, were driven out, and a provisional government installed in the city. The king of Holland hesitated between concession and the employment of force ; he adopted a middle course of policy, and sent his sons to redress grievances, and an army to enforce the royal authority- ; at the same time, he convoked the States-General. The Dutch princes were received with such coolness at Brussels, that they returned to the army; soon after, Prince Frederick, having learned that the patriots were divided among themselves, led the royal troops to Brussels, and at the same time published an amnesty, but, unfortunately, with such sweeping exceptions, that it should rather be called an edict of proscription. For four days, the Dutch and Belgians contested the possession of the city with equal want of skill and courage, but with somewhat more of energy on the part of the insurgents. Finally, the Dutch were T"], [424, "410 HISTORY of the peace. driven out, the proposals of mediation made by the prince of Orano-e were rejected by both parties, and Belgium became an independent state. After many tedious discussions and negotia tions, Leopold, prince of Saxe Coburg, was chosen king of this new power, and he conciliated the affections of his subjects by marrying the daughter of the king of the French. There were several insurrectionary movements in Germany ; the duke of Brunswick was deposed by his subjects, and the sovereignty transferred to his brother ; the king of Saxony was forced to resign in favour of his nephew, and the elector of Hesse was compelled to grant a constitutional charter. Abor tive efforts were made to restore constitutional governments in Spain and Portugal ; and the insurrectionary movements in Switzerland were promptly suppressed by the concession of the just and necessary reforms demanded by the people. Poland was the last country to catch the flame of revolt ; the Poles shook off the yoke of Russia, and, with more courage than prudence, proclaimed their ancient independence. Even in England, the political excitement of the time pro duced some dangerous appearances ; the rick-burnings in Kent and some of the southern counties were perilous signs of popular discontent; but the personal attachment of the nation to the king, and the prudent measures of the government, prevented any efforts to accomplish a revolution. When parliament assem bled, the debates were more than usually animated ; the duke of Wellington took an early opportunity of declaring himself opposed to any change in the representative system, and this declaration, which was wholly unexpected, filled parliament with astonishment, and the popular party with indignation. The king had been invited to dine with the lord-mayor of London, on the 9th of November, and his ministers, of course, were expected to accompany him. All the preparations were com plete, when a city magistrate having heard that some persons intended to insult and perhaps injure the duke of Wellington, in consequence of his late unpopular speech, wrote to his grace, recommending him to come with an escort. The riots in Paris and Brussels were too recent not to alarm the ministers, and they resolved that the king's visit to the city should be post-"], [425, "411 REIGN OF WILLIAM IV. poned. The announcement of this resolution produced a general panic, the funds fell four per cent, in one day, and for several hours the city of London was in a state of the greatest anxiety and alarm. But when it was found that no substantial grounds for apprehension existed, the ministers were overwhelmed with a storm of indignant ridicule, which was scarcely merited, for there can be little doubt of the propriety of removing the pretexts for a tumultuous assembly in the long nights of November. But the effect of this strange occurrence was fatal to a tottering ministry; the House of Commons, by a majority of twenty-nine, declared its want of confidence in the cabinet, and the duke of Wellington and his colleagues immediately resigned their offices. A new ministry was formed, under the auspices of Earl Grey, composed of the whig opposition, and the party commonly called Mr. Canning's friends. Early in 1831, the new premier declared that \"ministers had succeeded in framing a measure of reform, which they were persuaded would prove efficient, without exceedino- the bounds of that wise moderation with which such a measure should be accompanied.\" On the 1st of March, the ministerial plan was introduced to the House of Commons by Lord John Russell, and from that moment to its final success it almost wholly engrossed the attention of the country. The debate, on its introduction, lasted the unprecedented number of seven niohts ; the discussion on the second reading was shorter, but more animated; it was carried only by a majority of one. Ministers were subsequently defeated on two divisions, and, at their instigation, the king hastily dissolved the parliament. Rarely has an election taken place amid so much popular enthusiasm ; ardent supporters of the ministerial measure were returned by nearly- all the large constituencies, and so great was the popular triumph, that many reformers became alarmed at their own success, and thought that when the people could return such a decisive majority of popular representatives, there could be no predominant necessity for strengthening the demo cratic element of the British constitution. In the new parliament, the second reading of the Reform Bill was carried, after a debate of three nights, in the lower house, T 2"], [426, "412 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. by a majority of 136, which of course decided the fate of the measure in the Commons. After undergoing a very minute and tedious scrutiny in committee, it was sent up to the Lords, and, after a debate of five nights, rejected by a majority of 41. Great was the popular disappointment, but the promptitude with which the House of Commons, on the motion of Lord Ebrington, passed a vote of confidence in ministers, and pledged itself to persevere with the measure of reform, calmed the agitation in the metropolis and the greater part of the country. Some serious riots, however, occurred at Derby and Nottingham, which were not suppressed until considerable mischief was done ; Bristol suffered still more severely from the excesses of a licentious mob, whose fury was not checked until many lives were lost, and a great amount of valuable property wantonly destroyed. While the excitement respecting the Reform Bill was at the highest, a new pestilential disease was imported into the country. It was called the Asiatic cholera, because it first appeared in India, whence it gradually extended in a north-western direction to Europe. Its ravages in Great Britain were not, by any means, so great as they had been in some parts of the Continent, yet they were very destructive ; they were met by a bold and generous offer of service from the physicians throughout the empire, and their conduct, while the pestilence prevailed, reflected the highest honour on the character of the medical profession in Great Britain. The Poles, after a most heroic resistance, were forced to succumb to the gigantic power of Russia ; their downfall, indeed, was precipitated by treachery and internal discord, but unless they had been very efficiently aided by the other nations of Europe, their success, under any circumstances, would have been hopeless. The French were generally dissatisfied with their government, for not having interfered in behalf of Poland ; the republicans took advantage of their discontent to excite formi dable riots, which were not suppressed without great difficulty ; the insurgents held possession of the city of Lyons for several days, but the excesses they committed tended to strengthen the government, by showing that it was the interest of every man who valued the security of life and property to unite in the"], [427, "REIGN OF WILLIAM IV. 413 support of the monarchy. Spain and Portugal continued under the iron rule of Ferdinand and Don Miguel, whose thrones were strengthened, rather than endangered, by the faint efforts of the constitutionalists. But an event beyond the Atlantic was fraught with dangerous results to Don Miguel ; his brother, Don Pedro, the liberal emperor of Brazil, was deposed by his subjects, who were too ignorant and too bigoted to appreciate the views of their enlightened sovereign ; Don Pedro returned to Europe, and instantly prepared to make a vigorous effort for establishing the right of his daughter to the throne of Portugal. A new Reform Bill was introduced into the House of Com mons immediately after the assembling of parliament ; it passed there with little opposition, and was sent up to the House of Lords. As no change had been made in the constitution of that body, great anxiety was felt respecting the fate of the measure ; but some peers, who had formerly opposed it, became anxious for a compromise, and the second reading was carried by a majority- of nine. But these new allies of the ministry were resolved to make important alterations in the character of the measure, and when the bill went into committee the ministers found themselves in a minority. Earl Grey proposed to the king the creation of a sufficient number of peers to turn the scale, but his majesty refused to proceed to such extremities, and all the members of the cabinet resigned. The duke of Welling ton received, through Lord Lyndhurst, his majesty's commands to form a new administration, and he undertook the task in the face of the greatest difficulties that it had ever been the fate of a British statesman to encounter. The nation was plunged into an extraordinary and dangerous state of excitement ; the House of Commons, by a majority of eighty, virtually pledged itself to the support of the late ministry ; addresses to the crown were sent from various popular bodies, which were by no means dis tino-uished by moderation of tone or language ; associations were formed to secure the success of the Reform Measure, and the country seemed brought to the verge of a revolution. Under such circumstances, the duke of Wellington saw that success was hopeless, he resigned the commission with which he had been intrusted, and advised his majesty to renew his communications"], [428, "414 niSTORY OF THE PEACE. with his former advisers. Earl Grey returned to office ; a secret compact was made that no new peers should be created if the Reform Bill were suffered to pass ; and the measure having been rapidly hurried through the remaining stages, received the royal assent on the 7th of June. The Irish and Scotch Reform Bills attracted comparatively but little notice ; a law for enforcing the collection of tithes in Ireland was more vigorously opposed, and the ignorant peasants of Ireland were encouraged by their advocates to resist the payment of the impost. In France, the government had to contend against the machi nations of the friends of the ancient monarchy and the partisans of a republic. A Carlist insurrection was raised in the South of France, and the funeral of General Lamarque became the signal for republican riots in Paris. The king, supported by the army and the bulk of the middle classes, soon restored order in the capital ; the capture of the duchess de Berri put an end to the hopeless struggle in the South of France, and the subsequent career of the unfortunate princess covered her supporters with ridicule. Still the life of Louis Philippe was more than once attempted by fanatical republicans, but the great body of the French continue to manifest a lively interest in his preservation. Don Pedro resolved to maintain the rights of his daughter to the Portuguese crown, organized an army of volunteer adventu rers, both French and English, with which he proceeded to Portugal and took possession of Oporto. There was no general insurrection in his favour, as had been fondly anticipated, and he was soon blockaded by the Miguelites. The contest for several months continued to be doubtful, or rather seemed likely to terminate in the expulsion of Pedro, until the Miguelite fleet was destroyed by Admiral Napier ; soon after which event, Lisbon was taken by the Pedroites, and Miguel was driven into hopeless exile. His partisans expected that he would have been supported by the Spanish monarch, but though Ferdinand retained his bigoted adherence to despotic principles, his domestic circumstances led him to sympathize with the feelings of Don Pedro. His only children were daughters, and to secure the succession of the elder, he abolished the Salic Law, which had been introduced into Spain by the Bourbon dynasty. This"], [429, "415 REIGN OF WILLIAM IV. change naturally gave offence to the partisans of the king's brother, Don Carlos, who was a great favourite with the priests and monks ; a dangerous conspiracy in his favour, was detected and punished, but the crimes of the Carlists could not reconcile Ferdinand to the constitutionalists. Immediately after the expulsion of Miguel, Donna Maria da Gloria was crowned queen of Portugal. Don Pedro did not long survive her elevation ; he died September 24th, 1834. In the winter of the same year, Donna Maria married the prince of Leuchtenberg, who died on the 28th of the following March. She chose for her second husband Prince Ferdinand of Saxe Coburg, cousin to the queen of Great Britain. Portugal is recovering very slowly from the effects of the late civil wars, and Don Miguel has still many warm partisans among the bigoted priests and peasants. Several disturbances in the Papal States gave the French a pretext for seizing the citadel of Ancona, which gave just grounds of offence to Austria. But neither party wished to hazard the perils of war. The pope excommunicated all the liberals in his dominions, but was mortified to find that ecclesiastical censures, once so formidable, were now ridiculous. When the French evacuated Ancona, he was obliged to hire a body of Swiss troops for his personal protection, and the pay of these mercenaries almost ruined his treasury. To such a low estate is the papal power now reduced, which was once supreme in Europe, and exercised unlimited sway over the consciences and conduct of potentates and nations. When the emperor of Russia had re-established his dominion over Poland, he prepared to extend his influence over the South of Europe, where circumstances were occurring favourable to his plans of aggrandizement. Mohammed Ali, pacha of Egypt, virtually threw off his allegiance, and sent his son Ibrahim Pacha, with a powerful army, to invade Syria. The ruler of Eo-ypt, like the sultan, had strenuously exerted himself to intro duce the improvements of European discipline into his army and navy ; he succeeded better than his rival, because the Arabs and Egyptians were less bigoted in their attachment to ancient prejudices and institutions than the Turks. Ibrahim bore down all opposition by the superior training of his forces ; Syria was"], [430, "416 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. subdued with little difficulty, and a march through Anatolia, against Constantinople itself, would have presented no insuper able difficulties to the victorious Egyptians. Unable to defend himself by his own resources, the sultan was forced to seek the protection of Russia ; an army and navy were sent to his assist ance, Ibrahim was forced to halt in the midst of his career, and soon after, peace was restored by the mediation of the European powers. The first parliament chosen under the Reform Bill con tained a great number of new members, most of whom were partisans of the administration. But though the ministers had a large majority in the House of Commons, they were the weaker party in the Lords, and it required more than ordinary skill and moderation to prevent a collision between the two branches of the legislature. One of the first subjects to which the attention of parliament was directed, was the state of Ireland, in which a spirit of insubordination and violence had risen to the most fearful height, rendering life and property insecure, and threatening the most fatal consequences if not promptly and effectually repressed. A Coercion Bill, containing some very severe enactments, was introduced into the House of Lords, where it met but little opposition. In the lower house, how ever, it was fiercely assailed by Mr. O'Connell and a large body of Irish members, who were indebted for their seats to his powerful influence. Several of the most obnoxious clauses were modified, and the measure was finally carried. Ministers were equally successful with a bill for regulating the Irish church and diminishing the number of its bishops. But measures of still greater importance soon occupied the attention of parliament ; the charter of the Bank of England was renewed, on terms advantageous to the country; the East India Company was deprived of its exclusive commercial privileges, and the trade to Hindustan and China thrown open, but the company was per mitted to retain its territorial sovereignty. Finally, a plan was adopted for the abolition of West India slavery ; the service of the negro was changed into apprenticeship for a limited period, and a compensation of twenty millions was voted to the planters. There was a very active though not a very large section of the"], [431, "REIGN OF WILLIAM IV. 417 House of Commons dissatisfied with the limited extent of change produced by the Reform Bill; they demanded much greater innovations, and they succeeded in exciting feelings of discontent in the lower classes of the community. Popular discontent was not confined to England, it was general throughout Europe, but fortunately no serious efforts were made to disturb the public tranquillity. The second session of the Reformed Parliament was rendered memorable by the passing of an act for altering the administra tion of the Poor Laws, which was very fiercely attacked outside the walls of parliament. It was, however, generally supported by the leading men of all parties ; though its enactment greatly weakened the popularity of the ministers. The cabinet was itself divided respecting the policy to be pursued towards Ireland, and the dissensions respecting the regulation of the church, and the renewal of the Coercion Bill in that country, arose to such a height, that several of the ministry resigned. Lord Melbourne succeeded Earl Grey as premier, but it was generally believed that the king was by no means pleased with the change ; and that on the Irish church question, he was far from being satisfied with the line of conduct pursued by his ministers. In the month of November, the death of Earl Spencer removed Lord Althorp, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to the House of Lords, and rendered some new modifications necessary. The kino- took advantage of the opportunity to dismiss the ministers, an express was sent to summon Sir Robert Peel from the Continent, to assume the office of Premier ; and the duke of Wellington, who had administered the government in the interim, was appointed Foreign Secretary. Parliament was im mediately dissolved, and the three kingdoms were agitated by a violent explosion of party spirit. A tithe-affray in Ireland, which ended with the loss of life, supplied the opponents of the ministry with a pretext for rousing the passions of the peasantry in that country, and of this they availed themselves so effectually, that the ministerial candidates were defeated in almost every election. While the country was anxiously waiting the result of the approaching struggle between the rival political parties, both Houses of Parliament were accidentally burned to the 13"], [432, "418 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. ground, but the national archives were fortunately rescued from the destructive clement. When the parliament met in the spring of 1835, the weakness of the ministers in the House of Commons became apparent ; they were beaten on the choice of a speaker, and several questions of minor importance ; at length, a resolution was carried by which it was determined that a portion of the revenues of the Irish church should be devoted to secular purposes, upon which Sir Robert Peel resigned, and the Melbourne cabinet was restored. The first measure of the reinstated ministers was a bill for the Reformation of the English Corporations, which passed into a law ; but a similar measure for Ireland was rejected by the House of Lords, and the two houses could not agree on the principles for regulating the Irish church. Indeed the Melbourne cabinet, reluctantly received by the court, opposed by a large majority in the House of Lords, and by a formidable minority in the House of Commons, was so fettered that it had scarcely sufficient strength to conduct the ordinary operations of government, much less effect any great legislative change. The country, however, enjoyed great tranquillity, and its prosperity was evinced by the outlay of a vast amount of capital on railways and other improvements of the internal com munications of the country. The death of Ferdinand (Sept. 29th, 1833,) brought the affairs of Spain to a crisis. His widow, Maria Christina, assumed the regency in the name of her daughter, and the Carlists raised the standard of revolt, though at first with little prospect of success. Don Carlos narrowly escaped being taken prisoner in Portugal, by seeking refuge on board an English ship of war. He came to London, where he was vainly urged to resign his claim to the Spanish crown, and he soon after quitted England in disguise, and joined his adherents in Navarre, who had become very formidable, under the guidance of a daring chief named Zumalacarregui, and a priest named Merino. A quadri partite treaty was signed by the representatives of Spain, Portugal, England, and France, by which it was agreed that France should guard the frontiers, England the northern ports, and Portugal aid the queen of Spain with a body of troops if necessary. Notwithstanding these arrangements, the Carlists"], [433, "419 REIGN OF WILLIAM IV. were generally successful, and, at length, the court of Madrid applied to England for direct assistance. This was refused, but permission w-as given to raise an auxiliary legion of ten thousand men in the United Kingdom, the command of which was intrusted to Colonel Evans. But the effect produced by this force was far inferior to what had been expected ; in the dilapi dated state of the Spanish finances, it was found difficult to supply the legion with pay, provisions, and the munitions of war. A revolution at Madrid, which rendered the form of government very democratic, alienated the king of the French from the cause of the Spanish queen, and the war lingered, as it still does, without any prospect of restored tranquillity. At the end of its second year of service, the British legion was dis banded, and the Spanish government and its auxiliary force parted with feelings of mutual dissatisfaction. The people of England generally felt little interest in the affairs of Spain ; public attention was principally directed to the state of Ireland and Canada. The great Irish questions discussed in parliament, were the reform of the corporations, the regula tion of tithes, and the establishment of a provision for the poor, but the different views taken by the majorities in the Houses of Commons and Lords, prevented the conclusion of any final arrangements. In Canada, the descendants of the old French settlers, for the most part bigoted and ignorant, viewed with great dissatisfaction the superiority to which the English settlers had attained, in consequence of their knowledge, spirit and enterprise ; they attributed this pre-eminence to the partiality of the government, and, instigated by designing demagogues, clamoured for constitutional changes, little short of a recognition of their independence. Their demands were refused, and the deluded Canadians were persuaded to hazard a revolt ; but it is to be hoped that the conviction of their inferiority will lead them to early submission, and that they will try rather to raise themselves in the scale of civilization, than to gratify their pride and prejudice by vainly endeavouring to remove their British competitors. But all disputes about foreign and domestic policy were of inferior importance to the commercial distress produced by the"], [434, "420 HISTORY OF THE PEACE. failure of the banks in America. For a few weeks, the prospect of affairs seemed very gloomy, but the crisis passed over with less injury than had been anticipated, and trade resumed its wonted superiority. Just as commercial prosperity was reviving, the announcement of the king's illness filled the whole nation with anxiety; it was soon known that the disease was mortal, and on the 20th of June, William IV. resigned his earthly crown, universally and deservedly regretted by his subjects. He was succeeded by his niece, Victoria Alexandrina, daughter of the late duke of Kent, to whom we, in common with the rest of her subjects, wish a long and a happy reign."], [435, "421 CHAPTER XII. PRESENT STATE AND PROSPECTS OF CIVILIZATION. Europe may be said to possess three types of civilization, the Latin, the Teutonic, and the Sclavonic ; to the Latin division belong France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy ; in these nations the Roman Catholic religion prevails, antiquated forms are viewed with reverence, and the desire for change is dormant. This is less the case in France than in the more southern countries, because the French have a greater mixture of German blood, and from their position are more exposed to external influences. But notwithstanding the great political changes produced by the revolutions, adherence to ancient custom in almost every branch of industry and commerce is still manifest in France. The Latin nations are remarkable for vivid imaginations, for great attention to refinements of language, and for a literature marked rather by delicacy of fancy than depth of thought. They have been ever eminent in the abstract sciences, and ever backward in their practical application; this is particularly remarkable in their political history ; they have at various times devised countless constitutions, but looking to ideal perfection rather than actual circumstances, they have rarely produced one which would work for any length of time. The Latin races generally have lost much of their importance ; when first the New World was discovered it seemed likely, through Spain and Portuo-al, to become their heritage ; but they have been forced to yield to the superior energies of the Teutonic families. France still spreads its system of civilization in Northern Africa, but without any decisive success ; but, from the circumstances of its position, it must always have a commanding influence in the Levant and the ancient provinces of Turkey. Austria is more"], [436, "422 PRESENT STATE AND PROSPECTS Teutonic than France, and more Latin than England; \"it has often contended with France for supremacy over the Latin races, and it may be regarded as the natural counterpoise to the French power. The Austrian empire being composed of many various tribes and races, its policy is generally pacific, and its object always to prevent political innovation; but it is not a foe to internal improvements or administrative reforms ; and though the Italian and other dependant provinces may have cause to complain, the government of the hereditary states of Austria is remarkable for equity and mildness. To the Teutonic race belong England, Germany, Holland, and the Northern powers. In religion they are chiefly protestants ; and leaving out all consideration of doctrines, they may be described as preferring a simple, if not severe form of devotion, to the gorgeous solemnities of the Latin Church ; they are a thoughtful rather thau an imaginative people, and their literature is more remarkable for intensity of feeling than for play of fancy or harmony of words. In the sciences they are pre-eminently practical ; indeed they are not so much original inventors as actual workers out of the inventions of others. Their political institutions have all a tendency to secure a considerable share of personal freedom, and they differ chiefly from the constitutions of the Latin nations in inculcating a high respect for the rights of individuals, and preferring them to the interests of the mass. Hence the Teutonic races have learned the valuable lesson of self-dependence, and hence their colonies have been more pros perous and permanent than those of the Latin races. In every crisis of novelty or difficulty, the French and the Spanish settlers sought aid or advice from the parent government, while the English and German colonists looked only to themselves. England is unquestionably at the head of the Teutonic races ; its political influence, its commerce, its language, and its lite rature, have girdled the globe. Its institutions have taken deep root in the new w-orld, for the constitution of the United States is thoroughly English in its essential principles, and the day does not appear to be distant when its system of civilization will exercise a decisive influence in Southern Asia. From its insular position, England seems destined by nature to be the mediator"], [437, "423 OF CIVILIZATION. between the Continental powers, for it can rarely have any direct interest in their quarrels. The political divisions of Germany, and their conflicting inte rests, have not destroyed all feelings of nationality, though they have in a great measure rendered the Germans stationary. It is true indeed that many German colonies have been established in America and the steppes of Tartary, but the former have been absorbed by the English population, as the latter must eventually be by that of Russia. Prussia is the chief power in Northern Germany ; raised into eminence by military prowess, it must for a long time depend chiefly upon its army for continuance ; and it wdl be exposed to the jealousy of France, on account of its Rhenish provinces, and to that of Austria from its being the head of Protestant, as the latter power is of Catholic Germany. Holland and Belgium may be reckoned among the Teutonic nations ; neither possesses any great political importance, nor are they likely to take any leading part in any future develop ments of humanity. The same may be said of Switzerland, and the states of Southern Germany. The Northern powers will probably again become of more weight in the European states system than they are at present. The internal condition of Denmark and Sweden is rapidly improving, and their command of that great inland sea, the Baltic, must foster the growth of their navigation and their commerce. Between the Teutonic and the Sclavonic races there was a mixed nation, whose dismemberment has been very injurious to the maintenance of the balance of power in Europe, though its restoration is scarcely to be hoped. Poland, though essentially- Sclavonic, had still a sufficient share of Teutonic feelings and institutions to keep it distinct from Russia. But the form of its political constitution rendered it a constant source of discord to its neighbours, while Poland itself was continually harassed by civil wars. The animosity which still exists between the Poles and Russians must prevent the latter from any active inter ference in the affairs of Western Europe, but an insurrection should be encouraged by the Western powers. It is exceedingly probable, that if Napoleon had proclaimed the independence of Poland, his campaign in 1812 would have had a very different termination."], [438, "424 PRESENT STATE AND PROSPECTS Russia has risen from total barbarism to high political rank in little more than a century. Its civilization is still very imperfect, for the old Sclavonic forms of savage life do not well amalgamate with the refinements of Western Europe. The inconsistent mixture has rendered the Russian government a restless power, and almost forced upon it plans of territorial aggrandizement. But the vast extent of the Russian empire is a serious impediment to its internal improvement, and no real loss would result from its abandoning several of the remoter provinces. The present tendency of Russia is towards the South. Its agri cultural and commercial colonies in the Crimea, the steppes of Southern Russia, and along the coasts of the Black Sea, are rapidly rising in population, prosperity, and importance ; and the possession of the country between the Black Sea and the Caspian, must ensure to these settlers a decisive superiority in the trade with Central Asia. But these establishments, now so flourishing, would be completely ruined, were Russia to gain possession of Turkey ; the steppes would be deserted for the fertile fields of Thrace, and the prosperous ports of the Black Sea would be abandoned for those of the \u00c6gean. It is the interest of Russia to secure, but not to enlarge her southern frontiers; and the statesmen of that country are not ignorant that three such capitals as St. Petersburgh, Moscow, and Con stantinople, could not long continue under one emperor. Turkey is in the most anomalous condition of any country in the world ; the Turks do not constitute one-fourth of the popu lation, they regard themselves not so much inhabitants as a garrison in the country, and seem to think that they have only encamped in Europe. The military prowess by which they gained the Greek empire has long since disappeared, and their power now exists only on sufferance. It is true that the present sultan has strenuously exerted himself to introduce the principles of enlightened government, but he cannot amalgamate races disunited by centuries of oppression on the one hand, and treasured wrongs on the other. Exposed to the machinations of his bigoted subjects and rebellious pachas, the sultan must rely for protection on Russia ; favourably disposed as France and England are towards him, they are too distant to afford him aid"], [439, "425 OF CIVILIZATION. in case of any sudden emergency. A Russian armament would reach Constantinople from Sebastepol or Odessa, before the fact of its being required could be known in Paris or London. It is pro bable that the death of the sultan will compel the European powers to interfere in the affairs of Turkey as they did in those of Greece, otherwise the Turks will endeavour to re-establish their bar barous ascendancy, and revenge their present humiliation by ruthless massacres. Passing over the new kingdom of Greece as a country whose prospects are yet too unsettled for comment, let us turn our attention to Asia, with the western part of which Egypt may be considered as identified. It seems very probable that Egypt and Syria will form an independent state, and that both will rapidly receive the elements of civilization through the medium of commerce. Both the routes to India, by the Euphrates and the Red Sea, offer advantages which cannot long be overlooked ; and if they are neglected by England, they will be occupied by some other power. The great increase of steamers in the Mediterranean has not only produced a sensible effect on the commerce of the Levant, but also on the overland trade by caravans through Irak, Arabia, and Persia ; and Damascus is now the centre of an active European commerce, though only seven years ago no Christian dare be seen within its walls. Both Arabia and Persia must long continue depressed from the effects of misgovernment and civil wars ; but the ruler of the latter country is not insensible to the evils of his condition, and is sincerely anxious for improvement. The Imam of Muscat is also zealous for reform, but the circumstances of Eastern Arabia are very unfavourable to his good intentions. India, lono- subject to British government, has been only recently opened to British enterprise and British improvements. Unfortunately it is a country containing many distinct races, widely differing in language and religion, and, consequently, the adoption of a uniform system for their moral elevation is very difficult, if not impossible. Such a state of things renders the continuance of the British power in India absolutely essential to the prosperity, and almost to the salvation of the country. The people of Hindustan require to be protected against themselves."], [440, "426 PRESENT STATE AND PROSPECTS But the progress of education, and the intermixture of European settlers, will prepare the way for an appreciation of the value of just and equal laws, and the blessings of good government; feelings which indeed are very rapidly extending their influence throughout the Peninsula. There is every ground to hope that the English in India will prove not less worthy than the English in America, and that they will, under Providence, become the means of working out the moral regeneration of Asia. The Indo-Chinese nations have not for a long time engaged any share of the public attention ; but since the Burmese war they have been gradually coming within the pale of civilization. Greater anxiety is felt respecting the mighty empire of China, whose rulers are no longer able to maintain their ancient system of exclusion. Russia presses closely on their north-w-estem frontiers; the English settlements touch their southern boun daries. The necessities of trade compel the Chinese junks to traffic at the European settlements in the Indian archipelago, and Chinese colonists are settled under British protection in Australia. Under such circumstances, the interdiction of inter course is clearly nugatory; no government could enforce it; much less a government so weak and corrupt as that of China. The utmost that the Chinese authorities can effect is to change the course of trade, which would only injure themselves, but to stop the trade itself is utterly impossible. On the coast of North America, opposite China, the United States and Russia must soon meet as rivals in colonization. It is not easy to foresee how their respective pretensions will be arranged, when the increase of population shall have rendered the acquisition of territory an object with either party. But the trade of the Pacific will be too valuable to the citizens of the States to be tamely abandoned, and Russia has no chance of being equally interested in that traffic, while its Eastern colonies are separated from the parent state by the w-astes of Siberia. The United States have rapidly increased in political power, but their rulers have been unscrupulous in the use of means for its acquisition. The rights of the native Indians have been ostentatiously disregarded, and a course of policy adopted towards the Red men, compared with which their extirpation would be"], [441, "427 OF CIVILIZATION. almost an act of mercy. But a still deeper plague-spot on the social system of America arises from the system of negro slavery in the Southern States. It has already produced feelings of alienation between the Northern and Southern States ; while in the latter it is the cause of increasing evils, the least of which are insecurity of life and property. It has been the barbarous policy of the Southern planters not merely to discourage, but to punish every effort to civilize the slaves ; consequently, were an insur rection to break out, they would reap the bitter fruits of their barbarous policy, by meeting the unmitigated ferocity of savage vengeance. The approaching abolition of negro slavery in the British West Indies must force a change of system on the Ame ricans ; but whether it will be effected with or without bloodshed, is a question of which we dare not attempt the solution. It must, however, be remembered that the vices of the slave form the least portion of the evils of slavery ; infinitely worse and more degrading are the vices entailed on the master ; the sufferer may be rescued from the scourge, but the moral depravation of his tyrant is generally incurable. Like the Turks in Europe, the planters in America will not resign the sweets of oppression until they are forcibly wrested from their hands. The South American States seem to have fallen into almost hopeless confusion, nor is it easy to see how order is to arise out of the chaos. We are not, however, of those who believe that the o-emis of civilization will become extinct; perhaps it is neces sary that nations should have experience of anarchy as well as despotism, before they are fitted to appreciate the blessings of rational liberty. While France is making a feeble impression on the north of Africa, Eno-land is producing much more decisive effects in the south of that continent. The colony at the Cape is rapidly increasing in extent and population ; but at the same time its advancement has been attended with very questionable advantages to the natives. It is so much easier to dispossess savages than to civilize them, that most European colonists have adopted the former course, and it is as yet a controverted point, whether barbarous tribes can be improved by close contact with a civi lized people. On the western coast of Africa, the power of Great"], [442, "428 PRESENT STATE AND PROSPECTS OF CIVILIZATION. Britain is honourably exercised in checking the abominations of the slave trade ; but it will be impossible to put an end to this detestable traffic until slavery itself is abolished. So long as the wretches engaged in it can find a market, they will encounter all hazards in pursuit of gain ; but when it ceases to be profitable, the trade will of course be abandoned. Australia is beginning to be studded with British colonies; and those recently formed are not as of yore penal settlements, which have been proved by experience to be costly and mis chievous. This vast island, which deserves rather to be called a continent, will for many ages supply abundance of land to emigrants, while\"the increasing importance of the South Pacific trade will bring commerce to its shores. Through the exertions of English and American missionaries, the blessings of Chris tianity and civilization are rapidly spreading through the islands of Polynesia ; and this division of the globe, scarcely known until the last century, promises soon to rival Europe in the arts and advantages of social life. This rapid sketch of the present condition of the world offers much matter for serious contemplation ; especially it suggests the hope that a time is coming when wars will cease, and when nations will learn that it is as much their interest as that of individuals to live in harmony. It also shows us that Provi dence has assigned to England a high and noble destiny \u2014 that of being the herald of civilization, and its only firm basis, true religion, to the ends of the earth. Let us hope that such an important trust will not be delegated to our country in vain, and that its name will be hallowed in the memory of countless generations by the experience of the blessings it conferred, and the privileges it secured."], [443, "429 CHAPTER XIII. HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. In order to avoid frequent interruptions in the course of the narrative, it has been deemed advisable to reserve the account of the principal European colonies for the close of the volume, and thus to bring before the reader one of the most remarkable features in modem history. Colonies were indeed established in ancient times, and in the preceding volume of the Manual we have given a full account of those founded by the Greeks and Carthaginians; but the discovery of a new world gave an extraordinary impulse to emigration, and produced one of the most striking series of events in the annals of mankind. The subject naturally divides itself into two great parts \u2014 the Euro pean colonies in the Western, and those in the Eastern world ; and to the former we shall first direct our attention. The Establishment of the Spaniards in America. Immediately after the discovery of America, the first Spanish colony was established in Hispaniola, better known by the more modem name of St. Domingo. The queen Isabella had given strict orders to protect the Indians, and had issued a proclama tion prohibiting the Spaniards from compelling them to work. The natives, who considered exemption from toil as supreme felicity, resisted every attempt to induce them to labour for hire, and so many Spaniards fell victims to the diseases peculiar to the climate, that hands were wanting to work the mines or till the soil. A system of compulsory labour was therefore adopted almost by necessity, and it- was soon extended, until the Indians"], [444, "430 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. were reduced to hopeless slavery. The mines of Hispaniola, when first discovered, were exceedingly productive, and the riches acquired by the early adventurers attracted fresh crowds of greedy but enterprising settlers to its shores. The hardships to which the Indians were subjected rapidly decreased their numbers, and in the same proportion diminished the profits of the adventurers. It was therefore resolved to seek new settle ments ; the island of Puerto Rico was annexed to the Spanish dominions, arid its unfortunate inhabitants were subjected to the same cruel tyranny as the natives of Hispaniola. The island of Cuba was next conquered ; though it is seven hundred miles in length, and was then densely populated, such was the unwarlike character of the inhabitants, that three hundred Spaniards were sufficient for its total subjugation. More important conquests were opened by the intrepidity of Balboa, who had founded a small settlement on the Isthmus of Darien. Having learned from an Indian cazique that there existed a very wealthy kingdom on the borders of a great ocean, he sent to Hispaniola for reinforcements, and proceeded through the dangerous defiles and rocky chains which traverse the isthmus towards the frontiers of the unknown golden region. At length he reached the top of a mountain, which commanded a view of the wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean, and lifting up his hands to heaven, returned thanks to God for having made him the instrument of a discovery so honourable to his country and to himself. He received such information respecting the strength of the nation, whose fame had induced him to under take this perilous journey, that he deemed it prudent to lead back his followers, but he first obtained from the neighbouring caziqucs a greater amount of treasure than had yet been obtained by any Spanish expedition in the New World. In the mean time the cruelties with which the Indians were treated roused the sympathies of the missionaries, who had been sent out for their conversion. Las Casas, especially, appealed not only to his sovereign, but to all Christian Europe ; and such was the effect of his eloquence, that a change of system was promised. Unfortunately, Las Casas, in his anxiety to relieve one suffering race, inflicted equal misery on another ; he proposed that negroes"], [445, "THE SPANIARDS IN AMERICA. 431 should be imported from Africa to do the work of the Indians, and thus laid the foundation of the infamous slave trade, which still continues to outrage humanity. At length the Spaniards began to prepare an expedition for establishing their empire on the American continent ; an arma ment was organized in Cuba, and the command intrusted to Fernando Cortez, a commander possessing great skill and bravery, but avaricious and cruel even beyond the general average of his countrymen at that period. On the 2d of April, 1519, this bold adventurer entered the harbour of St. Juan de Uloa, on the coast of Yucatan. By means of a female captive, he was enabled to open communications with the natives ; and they, instead of opposing the entrance of these fatal guests into their country, assisted them in all their operations with an alacrity of which they too soon had reason to repent. The Mexicans had attained a pretty high degree of civilization ; they had a regular government, a system of law, and an established priest hood ; they recorded events by a species of picture-writing, not so perfect as the Egyptian system of hieroglyphics, but which, nevertheless, admitted more minuteness and particularity than is generally imagined ; their architectural structures were re markable for their strength and beauty ; they had advanced so far in science as to construct a pretty accurate calendar; and they possessed considerable skill, not only in the useful, but also in the ornamental arts of life. Cortez saw that such a nation must be treated differently from the rude savages in the islands, he therefore concealed his real intentions, and merely demanded to be introduced to the sovereign of the country, the emperor Montezuma. The Indian caziques were unwilling to admit strangers pos sessed of such formidable weapons as muskets and artillery into the interior of their country ; and Montezuma, who was of a weak and cowardly disposition, was still more reluctant to receive a visit from strangers, of whose prowess he had received an exaggerated description. He therefore resolved to temporize, and sent ambassadors to Cortez, with rich presents, declining the proposed interview. But these magnificent gifts served only to increase the rapacity of the Spaniards ; Cortez resolved"], [446, "432 niSTORY OF COLONIZATION. to temporize ; he changed his camp into a permanent settlement, which subsequently grew into the city of Vera Cruz, and patiently watched from his entrenchments the course of events. He had not long continvied in this position, when he received an embassy from the Zempoallans, a tribe which had been long discontented with the government of Montezuma. He imme diately entered into a close alliance with these disaffected sub jects, sent an embassy to Spain to procure a ratification of his powers, and set fire to his fleet, in order that his companions, deprived of all hope of escape, should look for safety only in victory. Having completed his preparations, he marched through an unknown country to subdue a mighty empire, with a force amounting to five hundred foot, fifteen horsemen, and six pieces of artillery. His first hostile encounter was with the Tlascalans, the most warlike race in Mexico ; their country was a republic, under the protection of the empire, and they fought with the fury of men animated by a love of freedom. But nothing could resist the superiority which their fire-arms gave the Spaniards; the Tlascalans, after several/lefeats, yielded themselves as vassals to the crown of Spain, and engaged to assist Cortez in all his future operations. Aided by six thousand of these new allies, he advanced to Cholula, a town of great importance, where, by Montezuma's order, he was received with open professions of friendship, while plans were secretly devised for his destruction: Cortez discovered the plot, and punished it by the massacre of six thousand of the citizens ; the rest were so terrified, that, at the command of the Spaniard, they returned to their usual occupations, and treated with the utmost respect the men whose hands were stained with the blood of their countrymen. From Cholula Cortez advanced towards the city of Mexico, and had almost reached its gates before the feeble Montezuma had determined whether he should receive him as a friend or as an cnemv. After some hesitation, Montezuma went forth to meet Cortez, with all the magnificence of barbarous parade, and granted the Spaniards a lodging in the capital. But notwithstanding his apparent triumph, the situation of Cortez was one of extraordinary danger and perplexity. He was in a city surrounded by a lake, the bridges and causeways"], [447, "433 THE SPANIARDS IN AMERICA. of which might easily be broken ; and his little band, \"thus cut off from all communication with its allies, must then have fallen victims to superior numbers. To avert this danger, he adopted the bold resolution of seizing Montezuma as a hostage for his safety, and he actually brought him a prisoner to the Spanish quarters. Under pretence of gratifying the monarch's curiosity to see the structure of European vessels, the Spaniards built two brigantines, and launched them on the lake, thus securing to themselves the means of retreat in case of any reverse of fortune. But danger impended over Cortez from an unexpected quarter ; the governor of Cuba, anxious to share in the plunder of Mexico, of whose wealth, great as it really was, he had received very exaggerated statements, sent a new armament, under the com mand of Narvaez, to deprive the conqueror of the fruits of his victory-. Cortez, leaving a small garrison in Mexico, marched against Narvaez, and by a series of prudent operations, not only overcame him, but induced his followers to enlist under his own banners. This reinforcement was particularly valuable at a time when the Mexicans, weary of Spanish cruelty and tyranny, had resolved to make the most desperate efforts for expelling the invaders. Scarcely had Cortez returned to Mexico, when his quarters were attacked with desperate fury ; and though thousands of the assailants were slain, fresh thousands eagerly hurried forward to take their place. At length Cortez brought out Montezuma in his royal robes on the ramparts, trusting that his influence over his subjects would induce them to suspend hostilities. But the unfortunate emperor was mortally wounded by a missile flung by one of his own subjects ; and Cortez, having done everything which prudence and valour could dictate, was forced to abandon the capital. The Spaniards suffered severely in this calamitous retreat, they lost their artillery, ammunition, and bao-o-age, together with the greater part of the treasure for which they had encountered so many perils. A splendid victory at Otumba over the Mexicans, who attempted to intercept them, restored the confidence of the Spaniards, and they reached the friendly territories of the Tlascalans in safety. Having collected some reinforcements, and by judicious arts revived the courage u"], [448, "434 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. of his men, Cortez once more advanced towards Mexico, and, halting on the borders of the lake, he began to build some bri gantines, in order to attack the city by water. While thus engaged, he succeeded in detaching many of the neighbouring cities from their allegiance to the new emperor Guatimozin, and having obtained some fresh troops from Hispaniola, he prepared for a vigorous siege, by launching his brigantines on the lake. Guatimozin made a gallant resistance, and repulsed the Spaniards in an attempt to take the city by storm ; but being unable to resist the slower operations of European tactics, he attempted to escape over the lake, when his canoe was intercepted by a brigantine, and the unfortunate emperor remained a prisoner. As soon as the fate of their sovereign was known, the resistance of the Mexicans ceased, and all the provinces of the empire imitated the example of the capital. Guatimozin was cruelly tortured to extort a confession of concealed treasure, and his unfortunate subjects became the slaves of their rapacious conquerors. Cortez himself was treated with gross ingratitude by his sovereign, whose dominions he had enlarged by the conquest of an empire, and he died in comparative obscurity. The discovery of a passage round the South American con tinent into the Pacific Ocean, by Magellan, and the establish ment of a colony at Panama, soon after Balboa had ascertained the nature of the Isthmus, incited the Spanish adventurers to undertake new conquests. Pizarro, one of the most enterprising men that ever visited the New World, having with great difficulty prepared a small armament, landed in Peru (a. d. 1531), and though at first disappointed by the barren appearance of the coast, he found so much treasure at Coague as to convince him that the accounts which Balboa had received of the riches of the country were not exaggerated. When the Spaniards first appeared in Peru, the nation was divided by a civil war between the sons of the late Inca, or sovereign ; Huascar, the elder, was dethroned by his brother Atahualpa, and detained in captivity, while his partisans were secretly maturing plans for his restora tion. Pizarro advanced into the country with the professed design of acting as mediator, but with the perfidious purpose of seizing Atahualpa as Cortez had the unfortunate Montezuma."], [449, "435 THE SPANIARDS IN AMERICA. He prepared for the execution of his scheme with the same deliberation, and with as little compunction, as if he had been engaged in the most honourable transaction. When the Spaniards approached the capital, the Inca was easily persuaded to consent to an interview ; and he visited the invaders with a barbarous magnificence, and ostentatious display of wealth, which inflamed the cupidity of the Spaniards, almost beyond the power of restraint. When Atahualpa reached the Spanish camp, he was addressed by Valverde, the chaplain to the expedition, in a long, and what must to the Inca have appeared an incomprehensible, discourse. The priest, after a brief notice of the mysteries of creation and redemption, proceeded to explain the doctrine of the pope's supremacy. He then dwelt upon the grant which Pope Alexander had made to the crown of Spain, and by virtue of it called upo i Atahualpa at once to embrace Christianity, and acknowledg j himself a vassal of the Spanish monarch. The Inca, completely puzzled, demanded where Valverde had learned such wonderful things ? \" In this book,\" replied the priest, pre senting the monarch with his breviary.. The Inca took the book, turned over the leaves, and then put it to his ear. \" This tells me nothing !\" he exclaimed, flinging the breviary on the ground. \" Blasphemy! blasphemy !\" exclaimed Aralverde \u2014 \" To arms, to arms, my Christian brethren ! avenge the pro fanation of God's word by the polluted hands of infidels.\" This solemn farce appears to have been preconcerted ; Val verde's words were the signal to \" cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.\" Ere he had concluded, the trumpets sounded a charge ; a dreadful fire of artillery and musketry was opened on the defenceless Peruvians ; and, in the midst of their surprise and consternation, they were charged by the cavalry, whose appear ance to men who had never before beheld a horse, seemed some thing supernatural. Atahualpa was taken prisoner and conveyed to the Spanish camp, while the invaders satiated themselves with the rich spoils of the field. The unfortunate Inca attempted to procure his liberation by the payment of an enormous ransom, but Pizarro, after receiving the gold, resolved to deprive the credulous monarch of life. He was brought to trial under the most iniquitous pretences, and sentenced to be burned alive; U 2"], [450, "436 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. but on his consenting to receive baptism from Valverde, .his sentence was so far mitigated that he was first strangled at the stake. The Spaniards quarrelled among themselves about the division of the spoils ; the Peruvians took advantage of their discord to raise formidable insurrections, and the new kingdom seemed likely to be lost almost as soon as it was gained. Pizarro himself was murdered by Almagro, the son of one of his old companions, whom he had put to death for treason, and but for the arrival of Vara de Castro, who had been sent as governor from Spain, the confusion produced by- this crime would probably have been without a remedy. De Castro conquered Almagro, and by his judicious measures restored tranquillity to the dis tracted province. Fresh disturbances were excited by the ambition of Gonzalo Pizarro, and it was not until more than a quarter of a century after its conquest that the royal authority was firmly established in Pern. Chili was subsequently annexed to the Spanish dominions, but the efforts made for its conquest were desultory and separated by long intervals, so that over a great part of the country the sovereignty of Spain was merely nominal. There is nothing very material in the early history of the other Spanish colonies ; and we shall now direct our attention to the establishment of the Portuguese empire in Brazil. Portuguese Colonies in South America. Brazil was accidentally discovered by a Portuguese admiral bound to the East Indies (a.d. 1501); but no settlement was made in the country for nearly half a century. At length the king of Portugal, envious of the wealth acquired by the Spaniards, sent out a small body of colonists, who founded St. Salvador (a. d. 1549). When the Portuguese first arrived in the country, the natives were divided into contending states and factions, which enabled the invaders to render the whole an easy prey by balancing cautiously between the contending interests. The Brazilians were indeed far lower in the scale of civilization than"], [451, "437 THE PORTUGUESE IN SOUTH AMERICA. the Peruvians or Mexicans ; they fought singly with great intrepidity, and were skilful in the use of bows, darts, wooden clubs and shields ; but they knew not how to man\u0153uvre in a body, and hence they were always routed in an encounter with Europeans. The facility with which the Portuguese made them selves masters of this rich country excited the cupidity of other powers, and their settlements were successively attacked by the French, the Portuguese, and the Dutch. The latter, indeed, almost succeeded in their enterprise, but they were finally expelled, and Brazil continued to be the most valuable possession of the Portuguese, until it imitated the other American states by the assertion of independence. Paraguay cannot, with propriety be reckoned among the colonies of Spain or Portugal ; it was first brought under sub jection by the Jesuits, whose allegiance to the Spanish crown was only nominal. The first Indians who became converts, were instructed by the missionaries in the arts of social life ; their countrymen, perceiving the advantages they derived from the change, soon began to imitate their example ; and in a very short time the Jesuits were complete masters of the country. To perpetuate their dominion, they carefully excluded all foreigners, and infused into the minds of their subjects a suspicious hatred of Europeans, which is not yet eradicated. Indeed, since the era of its independence, foreigners are as rigidly prohibited from entering Paraguay as they were when the whole resources of the country were monopolized by the Jesuits. The English in America. England had shared in the ardour for discovery which the successful enterprise of Columbus diffused throughout Europe. Newfoundland was visited by Sebastian Cabot, in the reign of Henry VII. ; and two unsuccessful voyages were made to the Southern Seas, by the same navigator, in the reign of Henry VIIL But the object which long continued to be the favourite one of the English adventurers, was the discovery of a passage"], [452, "438 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. through the Northern Seas to India and China. Sir Hugh Willoughby, and Richard Chancellor, hoped that this might be attained by sailing to the north-east; the latter reached Archangel, a port then unknown in Western Europe, and though he failed in his principal object, he laid the foundation of an active commerce between Great Britain and Russia. The Com pany of Merchant Adventurers, incorporated by Edward VI., were indefatigable in their efforts to open new courses of trade, by encouraging maritime and inland discovery ; while their navigators penetrated to Nova Zembla and the river Oby, several of their factors accompanied some Russian caravans into Persia, by the route of Astrachan and the Caspian Sea ; and the accounts which they published on their return, first gave British mer chants accurate intelligence concerning the state of the remote regions of the East. These enterprises were renewed under the reign of Elizabeth ; a commercial treaty was concluded with the shah of Persia, and such information obtained respecting India, as greatly increased the national ardour for opening a communi cation with that country by sea. But every effort to discover a North-west or North-east passage failed ; Martin Frobisher, like every navigator from his days to those of Sir John Ross, found the seas blockaded with fields of ice, through which no opening could be made. This disappointment might have damped the spirit of the English, but for the successful enterprise of Sir Francis Drake, who circumnavigated the globe with a small squadron, and returned home with an account of many important discoveries in the Pacific Ocean. War with Spain rendered this information peculiarly important ; and the English resolved to attack their enemies through their colonies, and thus cut off the sources of the wealth which rendered Philip II. formidable to Europe. Sir Humphry Gilbert, of Compton, in Devonshire, was the first who attempted to found an English colony in America ; he obtained a charter from Queen Elizabeth (June 11, 1578). The first efforts of the adventurers were baffled by a series of unfor tunate accidents; the settlers in Virginia, as the colony was called in honour of the maiden queen, were either forced to return, or perished by famine ; and at the close of Elizabeth's"], [453, "439 THE ENGLISH IN AMERICA. reign there was not a single Englishman resident in America. Two companies were incorporated by James I. for colonizing Northern America ; Newport, who led the settlers to Virginia, had the good fortune to discover the bay of the Chesapeak, and the Powhatan, or James' River, and in this favourable position he founded James' Town, which soon became a thriving settlement. Its rising prosperity was checked by disputes between the ruling powers, and by the unfortunate captivity of Governor Smith, who was taken prisoner by the Indians. These barbarians were about to put their captive to death by torture, when his life was saved by the interference of Pocahuntas, the daughter of the Indian chief, and Smith was restored to the colony, which, during his absence, had been brought to the brink of ruin. Pocahuntas subsequently became a Christian, and married an Englishman, named Rolfe ; and most of the respect able families in Virginia claim to be descended more or less directly from the Indian heroine. But fresh calamities awaited the colony ; the settlers aban doned agricultural pursuits to search for gold mines, and this folly produced a famine which threatened utter ruin. The settlement was on the point of being abandoned, when Lord Delaware arrived from England with provisions and reinforce ments. Thenceforward its improvement was progressive, and the cultivation of tobacco became more profitable to the Vir ginians than the mines of Peru to the Spanish Americans. Unfortunately, the arrival of a Dutch vessel, laden with negroes, in James' River, introduced the slave-trade into the colony, and the greater part of the labour still continues to be performed by servile hands. The Virginians adhered to the royal cause with desperate fidelity in the war between Charles I. and his parliament, for which they were severely punished by Cromwell. Charles II so far from rewarding their loyalty, not only continued, but increased the restrictions which the Protector had imposed upon them, and thus provoked a formidable insurrection, which was not suppressed without great difficulty. From that period to the revolutionary war in 1776, Virginia continued to enjoy tranquillity ; and as most of the settlers were descended from"], [454, "440 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. cavaliers, the colony was considered one of the most loyal subject to the British crown. The first attempts to settle a colony in a more northern part of America, subsequently called New England, were very unfor tunate. At length some puritans, dissatisfied with the English form of church government, emigrated to the New World, and landed in Massachusetts Bay (September 6, 1620). They were soon joined by fresh bands of their brethren from the parent country, who sought in the wilds for a freedom of worship which was denied them at home. Fortunately for them the Indians surrounding their frontiers were sw-ept away by the small-pox, and thus the colonists were enabled to extend their frontiers without being exposed to the horrors of war. Though the puritans had emigrated, as they asserted, because they felt their consciences restricted in England, they were far from per mitting freedom of opinion in their new settlements. Disputed points of doctrine gave rise to fierce dissensions, and the minority was driven into the wilderness. The expelled sectarians founded the colonies of Providence, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, to which New Hampshire and Maine were subsequently added, but rather through a spirit of enterprise than religious discord. The extension of their settlements exposed the English to new dangers. Though the Indian tribes round Massachusetts bay were feeble and unwarlike, the colonies of Providence and Connecticut were encircled by powerful and martial nations, of which the most considerable were the Naragansets and the Pequods. Fortunately, however, these nations were divided by ancient animosities ; the Pequods, attempting the expulsion of the English, were defeated; but the conquerors sullied their victory by mercilessly- exterminating the whole tribe. Warned by this example, the Naragansets entered into amicable relations with the English, which were indeed frequently interrupted by mutual jealousies, but were maintained notwithstanding until the indignities offered to king Philip, the head of the Wam panoag tribe, drove that powerful chieftain into open war (a. d. 1675). Philip successfully inspired all the Indian tribes with a passion for independence, and displayed considerable abilities both as a general and a statesman. He defeated several parties"], [455, "441 THE ENGLISH IN AMERICA. of the English ; and though frequently routed in his turn, he easily repaired his losses by inviting volunteers from distant tribes. But his followers were not all animated by the same spirit ; his place of refuge was betrayed by one of his favourites to an English party ; he was surprised and slain. The war lingered for some months after his death, but the superiority of the English was firmly established ; and though the Indians were at many subsequent periods induced to take up arms by the French, they were never able to give any important check to the growing prosperity of the English colonies. The country which constitutes the state of New York is said to have been discovered by an Englishman, Captain Hudson, who sold his right to the Dutch. Notwithstanding the remon strances of the court of England, the Dutch settled themselves in the country, and founded the town of New Amsterdam. The colony continued to flourish until the first Dutch war in the reign of Charles II., when it was conquered by the English, who changed the name of the capital to New York, which it still retains. New Jersey was at the same time added to the English colonies ; but there is nothing remarkable in the history of either, previous to the war of independence (a. d. 1776). Canada was the first colony established by the French in Canada; but the early settlers suffered so many misfortunes, that the country was several times on the point of being aban doned. It began, however, to prosper after the foundation of Quebec, by Champlain (a. d. 1608), and the formation of a new colony at Montreal. The contests of the French with the Iroquois and the Hurons, were less perilous than those of the New Englanders with the Pequods and Naragansets, but they were less ably conducted, and more injurious to the prosperity of the colony. At a much later period, the French colonized Louisiana (a. d. 1686), with the hope of securing the fertile countries watered by the Mississippi. The settlement was more valued by the government than Canada, because it was supposed to contain mines of gold, and for the same reason possession of it was equally coveted by the English and the Spaniards. Having two colonies, one at the northern and the other at the southern T/3"], [456, "442 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. extremity of the British settlements, the French government prepared to connect them by a chain of forts, which would have completely hemmed in the English. A furious war ensued between the two nations in the back woods, which ended in the complete overthrow of the French. Canada and Louisiana were ceded to England by the peace of 1763; but the latter was joined to the United States, while the former still continues under British government. In the history of the other colonies there is nothing of sufficient importance to deserve a place in this summary. Most of those colonies are now independent states, and must for the future occupy a conspicuous position in Modern History; and, among the best guides to a correct estimate of their future career, is a knowledge of the circumstances attending their foundation. Colonization of the West Indies. We have already mentioned the settlement of the Spaniards in Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, and shall now briefly give a brief sketch of the colonization of the other principal islands. Barbadoes, one of the earliest English settlements, was totally uninhabited when the English took possession of it (a. d. 1623). Its prosperity first began to attract notice when some of the Dutch, who were expelled from Brazil by the Portuguese, intro duced the manufacture of sugar, and the cultivation of the cane, from which that useful article is extracted. Negroes were not imported as slaves until about the year 1630 ; previous to which time the planters are said to have been frequently guilty of kidnapping the Caribs. The negroes multiplied so fast that they frequently conspired to massacre all the white inhabitants, and take possession of the island, but their plots were discovered and punished with remorseless severity. St. Lucia was first settled by the English (a. d. 1637), but the colonists were soon massacred by the Caribs, after which it was seized by the French, who are said to have instigated the revolt of the native tribes. The island frequently changed masters in the wars between France and England, but it now"], [457, "443 THE WEST INDIES. belongs to the latter power. St. Vincent and the Grenadine islands were similarly contested, and now belong to England. Martinico and Guadaloupe were colonized by the French, in the beginning of the seventeenth century. Their prosperity received very severe checks in the frequent wars between France and England. At the late treaty of peace they were restored to France. The other Caribbee islands are possessed by the Dutch, the Danes, and the English, but the largest share belongs to the English. Antigua is, perhaps, the most flourishing of these islands, but there is nothing remarkable in its history. Tobago was colonized by the Dutch, conjointly with the Courlanders (a. d. 1632). It was wrested from them by the French, who subsequently ceded it to the English (a. d. 1737)- The Bahama islands, though discovered by Columbus, were completely neglected until they were accidentally visited by an Englishman named Sayle (a. d. 1667), who was driven to seek shelter among them by stress of weather. The account which he gave of their climate and productions, on his return home, induced some spirited adventurers to combine for their coloniza tion. The early settlers suffered very severely from hurricanes and the hostility of the Spaniards, but they triumphed over these calamities, and laid the foundation of communities which are now flourishing and prosperous. The Bermudas or Summer Islands were discovered but never colonized by the Spaniards. An Englishman named May was shipwrecked on one of them ; he and his companions built a vessel of the native cedar, and returned to Europe, where they published a very exaggerated account of the beauty and fertility of these islands, which gave rise to many poetic fictions. A colony was planted on St. George's island, by the Virginia com pany, but it narrowly escaped destruction in its infancy, from a very singular visitation. Some rats, imported in European vessels, multiplied so prodigiously that they covered the ground and built nests in the trees. Their devastations were continued durino- five years, when they suddenly disappeared, but from what cause is uncertain. Since that period, the prosperity of these islands has been uninterrupted. Jamaica was discovered by Columbus, and soon after colonized"], [458, "444 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. by the Spaniards, who massacred the greater part of the native inhabitants. As there were no mines in the island, it was neglected by the Spaniards, and was easily wrested from them by a British armament, under the command of Penn and Venables, during the protectorate of Cromwell. The position of Jamaica afforded many facilities for attacking the Spanish settlements, and it was, therefore, the great rendezvous of the formidable combination of pirates called the Buccaneers. This confraternity was composed of adventurers from various nations, and the Spanish ships and colonies were their chief objects of attack. They were not, however, very scrupulous in ascertain ing to what nation any richly laden vessel belonged; and, to prevent any discovery of their crimes, they generally massacred the crews. Morgan was their most noted leader ; he conquered Panama, and several other rich towns belonging to the crown of Spain ; and having by his continued successes gained the command of a large force, appears to have meditated the estab lishment of an independent sovereignty. Subsequently, he abandoned his piracies, submitted to the English government and received the honour of knighthood. The buccaneers being no longer protected in Jamaica, removed to the French settle ment in Hispaniola, and long continued to be the terror of the American seas. Jamaica has often been harassed by negro insurrections, but since the mountains have been opened by roads, the insurgents, deprived of any place of shelter, have found themselves unable to make considerable stand. Hispaniola, or St. Domingo, after having been long an object of contention between the French, Spaniards, and English, is now an independent negro state, and has resumed its old native name of Hayti. The Portuguese in India. The colonies we have just described owe their origin to the discoveries of Columbus ; we must now direct our attention to those in the opposite division of the globe, which were conse quent on the discovery of a passage round the Cape of Good"], [459, "THE PORTUGUESE IN INDIA. 445 Hope, by Vasco de Gama. The first enterprises of the Portu guese, when a way was opened for them to Hindustan, were limited to securing their commerce ; but under the guidance of the illustrious Albuquerque, they procured a grant of ground from one of the native sovereigns, and founded a strong fortress. The Mohammedans, who had hitherto engrossed the entire commerce of India, formed a league to expel the intruders, in which they were encouraged by the Venetians, who purchased Indian spices and other goods from the Arabs, with which they supplied the principal markets of Europe. This enterprise was defeated, and soon after Don Alphonzo Albuquerque laid the foundation of the future supremacy of the Portuguese by reducing Goa, which, in 1559, became the seat of government, and was also erected into an archbishop's see by the pope. This was the first commencement of territorial acquisition by European powers in India, a system strongly deprecated by Vasco de Gama, and which it is impossible to defend on any principles of national justice. Albuquerque defended himself by declaring that it would be impossible for Portugal to command the trade unless it shared in the empire of India, a pretext whose obvious weakness it is not necessary to expose. Albuquerque also sub dued the city of Malacca, and the island of Ormuz, in the Persian Gulph. The efforts of his successors were principally directed to the maintenance of Albuquerque's acquisitions, and to checking the progress of the Turks, who, after the conquest of Egypt, made several attempts to establish themselves on the coast of Malabar. Had they succeeded, it is probable that the Christians would never have occupied India, for the Mussulmans spread over the Peninsula would have united to support a power equally favourable to their religious prejudices and their temporal interests. In about sixty years, the Portuguese had established an empire in the East, whose extent and power were truly wonderful. On one side, their authority extended as far as the utmost limits of the coast of Persia, and over all the islands in the Persian Gulph ; some of the Arabian princes were their tributaries, others their allies, and through the entire Arabian peninsula, none dared to confess themselves their enemies. In the Red Sea, they were the only power that"], [460, "446 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. commanded respect, and they had considerable influence over the emperor of Abyssinia and the rulers of Eastern Africa. They possessed the whole coast of Malabar, from Cape Ramoz to Cape Comorin ; they were masters also of the Coromandel coast, the Bay of Bengal, the city, fortress, and peninsula of Malacca. The potent island of Ceylon, the islands of Sunda, and the Moluccas paid them tribute ; and they had obtained a settlement in China, and a free trade with the islands of Japan. The ruin of this empire arose chiefly from the union of Portugal with Spain (a. d. 1580). Immediately after that event, Philip II. issued an edict, prohibiting the Dutch from trading with Lisbon, and thus compelled them to seek for the spices and wares of India in other quarters. The enterprising republicans were then hardy and necessitous, and had every thing to hope and nothing to lose ; the Portuguese, on the other hand, were divided in their counsels, depraved in their manners, and detested by their subjects and neighbours. The Dutch first established themselves in some distant islands, from whence, being joined by new settlers from home, partly by force of arms and partly by taking advantage of the errors committed by the Portuguese, they finally supplanted them everywhere, and effectually stripped them of their dominions in far less time than they had acquired them. The most remarkable of the Portuguese settlements was the island of Ormuz ; it is nothing more than a salt and barren rock in the Persian Gulph, destitute of water, save where rain, which rarely falls, is collected in natural or artificial cavities ; but its commodious situation rendered it the most flourishing commer cial mart in the Eastern Seas. Its roadstead was frequented by shipping from all parts of the Indies, from the coasts of Africa, Egypt, and Arabia, while it possessed an extensive caravan trade with the interior of Asia, through the opposite ports of Persia. The wealth, the splendour, and the concourse of traders at Ormuz, during its flourishing condition, gave the world a memorable example of the almost omnipotent power of com merce ; in the trading seasons, w-hich lasted from January to March, and from the end of August to the beginning of Novem ber, not only was there an unparalleled activity of traffic, but a"], [461, "THE PORTUGUESE IN INDIA. 447 display of luxury and magnificence which seemed to realize the extravagances of fiction. The salt dust of the streets was concealed and kept down by neat mats and rich carpets ; canvass awnings were extended from the roofs of the houses to exclude the scorching rays of the sun ; the rooms next the street were opened like shops, adorned with Indian cabinets and piles of porcelain, intermixed with odoriferous dwarf trees and shrubs, set in gilded vases, elegantly adorned with figures. Camels laden with water skins stood at the corner of every street, while the richest wines of Persia, the most costly perfumes, and the choicest delicacies of Asia, were poured forth in lavish profusion. The Portuguese, in the insolence of prosperity, provoked the hostility of Shah Abbas, the most powerful of the Persian monarchs, and quarrelled with the English, just as they were beginning to obtain consideration in the East. A league was formed between Shah Abbas and the English; their united forces assailed Ormuz (a. d. 1622), it was taken with little difficulty, and the value of its plunder was estimated at two mdlions. Thenceforward, the trade of Ormuz rapidly declined ; its merchants transferred their capital and enterprise to other quarters, the very materials of its splendid edifices were taken away by the Dutch ships as ballast, and it soon relapsed into its original condition of a barren and desolate rock. Scarce the smallest remains are now left to vindicate the records of history, or to prove that this was once the flourishing capital of extensive commerce, and the principal magazine of the East. The Spaniards in the East Indies. We have before stated that the object of the first voyage of Columbus was to discover a western passage to the East Indies, and this project was not forgotten by the Spaniards, even after a new world had been opened to their ambition. After the discovery of the passage round the extremity of South America, by Magellan, they prepared to occupy some of the Moluccas, but were prevented by the papal division of newly-discovered"], [462, "448 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. countries between them and the Portuguese. But when Portu gal w-as united to Spain, under Philip II., Lopez de Legaspi resolved to form a settlement in a valuable cluster of these islands, which he called the Philippines, in honour of his sovereign. The city of Manilla was speedily built and fortified ; scarcely were its defences complete, when it was attacked by the native islanders, instigated by the Chinese, who appear to have been, at some remote period, masters of the country. With some difficulty, the insurrection was suppressed ; but more formidable rivals soon appeared; the Dutch occupied the most valuable of the Moluccas, and the Spanish court seriously contemplated the abandonment of the Philippine Islands. But though these settlements have been frequently attacked both by the Dutch and English, they have been preserved to the crown of Spain, and are now almost the only remnant of the extensive colonial empire once possessed by that monarchy. The Dutch in the East Indies. It was the intolerable cruelty of the Spanish government that drove the Dutch to revolt; and the incurable bigotry of Philip II. prevented the insurgents from ever seeking an accom modation. But the same sanguinary and short-sighted policy laid the foundation of the future prosperity of Holland, and enabled the Dutch to attain, in a very short period, an unrivalled ascendancy in commerce. To check the growing spirit of freedom in the Netherlands, the Spaniards destroyed the trade of Antwerp, discouraged every effort made for its restoration, and thus drove its merchants to increase the establishments and the trade of Amsterdam. Desirous of humbling the Portuguese, Philip's ministers laid the most vexatious restraints on the commerce of Lisbon, and thus compelled the Dutch, whose subsistence almost wholly depended on the carrying-trade to seek out means for the direct importation of Indian commodities. It was still hoped that a north-east passage to the Indian seas might be discovered, and three fruitless expeditions were sent"], [463, "THE DUTCH IN THE EAST INDIES. 449 out on this hopeless inquiry. In the mean time, Cornelius Houtman, who had been made prisoner by the Spaniards at Lisbon, obtained such information from the Portuguese respect ing the course of their voyages round the Cape of Good Hope, that on his escape to Amsterdam, he induced some of the leading merchants to form a company for sending him out with an expedition, and a fleet, well provided, sailed from the Texel, (a. d. 1595). The Spaniards first attempted to defeat the enterprises of the Dutch by main force, but being soon convinced of their inferiority at sea to the hardy republicans, they sent emissaries to the principal Eastern sovereigns, describing the new adventurers as pirates. But the Dutch admiral, Heem skirk, having captured a rich Portuguese vessel, on her way from Macao, treated his prisoners w-ith so much generosity, that letters of thanks were addressed to him from the principal Spanish authorities in the East; these letters he produced in every port at which he touched, and thus satisfactorily refuted the calumnies which had been heaped upon his nation. A company was soon incorporated in Holland for managing the Indian trade; and the rest of the subjects of the United Pro vinces were prohibited from trading with Asia, either by the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn. They first occupied the Moluccas or Spice Islands, from which they were driven by the Spaniards, but soon retrieved their losses. Ere long, the Dutch and English East India Companies, excited by mutual jealousy, began to assail each other's possessions. The island of Java was the chief object of their mutual ambition; after a long straggle, the Dutch prevailed, and immediately secured their acquisition by building the city of Batavia. Soon afterwards, all the English merchants resident at Amboyna were massacred, and, by this act of treachery the Dutch succeeded in securing, for a long time, the monopoly of the spice trade. They also wrested the Japanese trade from the Portuguese, and continue even now to be the only Europeans admitted to trade with the empire of Japan. The next great object of the Dutch was to gain possession of the island of Ceylon, from which they not only expelled the Portuguese, but reduced the native princes under their domi-"], [464, "450 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. nion, and thus gained the monopoly of the cinnamon trade. They long kept possession of this valuable island, but during the wars of the French revolution, it was wrested from them by the English, under whose power it still continues. The influence of the Jesuits, at the court of Pekin, baffled all the efforts of the Dutch to open a trade with the Chinese empire ; but they succeeded in establishing a flourishing settle ment on the island of Formosa, which opened to them a lucrative traffic with the Indo-Chinese nations. But soon after the conquest of China by the Mantchew Tartars, the Forrno sans, joined by a large army from China, besieged the Dutch settlement and compelled the garrison to surrender. Since that period, Formosa has been annexed to the empire of China, and is no longer visited by Europeans. The Dutch adopted a more exclusive system of policy than the Spaniards or Portuguese, and this was the principal cause of the ruin of the empire they had acquired. Their harsh conduct to the natives produced frequent civil wars or insurrections, which greatly weakened their settlements. In Java especially, their dominion was maintained only by an enormous expendi ture of blood and treasure ; and as other European nations began gradually to obtain a share in the spice trade, the Dutch East India Company found the profits of its monopoly rapidly diminishing. During the wars of the French revolution, most of the Dutch colonies were occupied by the English, but some of them were restored at the general peace. England, however, kept the two of greatest importance, the Cape of Good Hope and the island of Ceylon ; but Holland still possesses the island of Java, and the monopoly of the trade with Japan. The Danes in the East Indies. An association was formed at Copenhagen for opening a trade with the East Indies (a. d. 1612), in consequence of the riches which so lucrative a branch of commerce seemed to have brought into the neighbouring nations. A small expedition was sent"], [465, "451 THE DANES IN THE EAST INDIES. out to the Coromandel coast, where the adventurers were hospitably received by the rajah of Tanjore, from whom they received permission to establish a settlement at Tranquebar. Many circumstances contributed to check the prosperity of the Danish East India Company, but none more than the pertina cious jealousy of the Dutch, who excluded them from the most profitable branches of trade. But though the Danes did not attain to any remarkable eminence in East Indian commerce, they were honourably distinguished by their zeal for the propa gation of the Christian religion; and, notwithstanding their limited means, they have succeeded in diffusing the principles of true religion through a considerable portion of the South of India. The French in the East Indies. Maritime affairs were long neglected in France ; and though Francis I. and Henry III. issued edicts, exhorting their subjects to undertake long voyages, yet either a want of enterprise in the people, or the inability of the government to afford pecuniary assistance, prevented any effort being made meriting notice. After some attempts to form an association of merchants, productive of little advantage, an East India Company was formed (a. d. 1615), but meeting with some misfortunes, the members resolved to abandon the Indian trade, and to direct their attention to the establishment of a settlement in the island of Madagascar. Towards the close of the seventeenth century, the French purchased the town of Pondicherry, from the king of Visapur, and began to form a settlement there with every reasonable prospect of success. It was, however, wrested from them by the Dutch (a. d. 1693), but was subsequently restored by the treaty of Ryswick (a. d. 1697). Thenceforward, the prosperity of the colony progressively increased, and the subse quent acquisition from the Dutch of the islands called the Isles of France and Bourbon, but previously the Mauritius and the Mascarenhas, led the French to hope that they might acquire an important share in Eastern commerce. A new career of ambi-"], [466, "452 HISTORY of colonization. tion was opened to them by the sanguinary struggles which arose between the new states formed out of the fragments of the empire of Delhi ; M. Dupleix, the governor of Pondicherry, hoped, by embroiling the natives with each other, to obtain territorial acquisitions, as the price of his assistance to some of the combatants. The English adopted the same course of policy, and thus the ancient hostility between the two nations extended its influence to India, and led to a long series of wars, which ended in the almost total expulsion of the French from the Peninsula. The English in India. A hundred years have not elapsed since the possessions of the British East India Company were limited to three settlements of narrow extent, inhabited by a few hundred Europeans, who were scarcely able to defend themselves against pirates and banditti, much less compete with the power of the native princes. Now this association of merchants, from its court in Leadenhall-street, rules over an empire containing a hundred millions of subjects, raises a tribute of more than three millions annually, possesses an army of more than two hundred thousand rank and file, has princes for its servants, and emperors pensioners on its bounty. Calcutta from a miserable village has become the metropolis of the East ; Bombay possesses more trade than Tyre, in the days of its glory ; and Madras, in spite of its perilous surf, rivals the commercial prosperity of Carthage. There is no parallel to such a career in the annals of the world : conquerors, indeed, have acquired a more extensive dominion in a shorter space of time, but they failed to establish a permanent empire ; after a few years, the traces of their tempestuous passage were as completely effaced as the track of a vessel in the waves of the ocean. In the preceding chapters, we have incidentally noticed the progress of the Company's empire in its relation to the general politics of Europe, but it is of importance to mark more"], [467, "THE ENGLISH IN INDIA. 453 definitely the successive steps by which such vast acquisitions have been won and secured. The history of the East India Company, indeed, has more than ordinary claims on our attention ; it is intimately connected with our national character and national welfare, and all must desire to know whether our Eastern empire has advanced the great cause of civilization, and whether our domination is likely to endure, or to meet at some time or other a precipitate overthrow. The London Company for trading with the East Indies, was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth (a.d. 1600), and remained without a rival for nearly a century, when the necessities of the state led to the formation of the English Company (a. d. 1698) ; it was soon found that the rivalry between these bodies was prejudicial to the interests of both, and at the recommendation of his majesty King William III., the two companies agreed to form one association, to be designated, \" The United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies.\" The first English settlement of importance was Bantam, in the island of Java; hut in 1658, they obtained a grant of land on the Coromandel coast, near Madras, where they erected a stronghold, Fort St. George. In 1668, the island of Bombay, ceded by the crown of Portugal to Charles II., as part of the dowry of the Infanta Catherine, was granted by the king, and appointed the capital of the British settlements in India. Bengal was not at first estimated at its true value, but towards the close of the seventeenth century (a. d. 1698) the English had a settlement at Calcutta, the French at Chandernagore, and the Dutch at Chinsura, all situated on the river Hooghly. An embassy was sent to the court of Delhi with presents; fortunately one of its members was an eminent physician, and his professional aid was required by the Emperor Ferrokshir. In gratitude for the services of Dr. Hamilton, Ferrokshir granted valuable firmans or patents of privileges to the Company, which gave them great advantages over their European rivals. The viceroy of Bengal, jealous of the privileges granted to the English, advanced against Calcutta, took the town, and confined one hundred and forty- six in a dungeon called the Black Hole, so narrow and confined that only twenty-three of the captives survived till the morning."], [468, "454 HISTORY of colonization. Colonel Clive, who had already given proofs of his military talents in the Madras presidency, was sent into Bengal. He soon recovered Calcutta, and took Chandernagore from the French. Finding that the viceroy of Bengal, Suraj-u-Dowlah, was obstinate in his opposition to the Company's interest, Clive adopted the bold resolution of deposing him without waiting for, or indeed asking, the emperor's sanction, although the Company was at peace with the court of Delhi. Acting promptly on this determination, Clive attacked the Viceroy's troops at Plassey (June 23rd, 1757), and gained a decisive victory. Suraj-u- Dowlah was deposed, and his post given by the conquerors to Jaffier Ali Khan. After Clive's return to England, the government of Calcutta was intrusted to a council, of which Mr.Vansittart was appointed president. The rapidity with which the English had acquired supremacy in Bengal, inspired them with feelings of contemp tuous superiority, which involved them in angry disputes with the new viceroy. At length, the council of Calcutta, induced by a bribe of 200,000/., resolved to depose Jaffier, and confer the viceroyship on Cossim Ali Khan. But Cossim was soon as odious as his predecessor. The servants of the East India Company claimed an exemption from all duties on commerce, and thus ruined the native merchants. Cossim, after many remonstrances to the council of Calcutta, abolished the transit duties altogether ; and this act of justice to his own subjects, though extorted by necessity, was loudly exclaimed against as an infringement of his engagements with the Company, and two agents were sent to demand the repeal of the decree. While negotiations were pending, the English resident seized the citadel of Patna, and though it was immediately retaken by Cossim Ali, his rage was so excited by what he regarded a deliberate act of treachery, that he put all the English prisoners to death. War was instantly declared, Cossim Ali was defeated and deposed, and Jaffier Khan was once more declared viceroy of Bengal. It is not known at what price Jaffier purchased his restoration, but he did not long enjoy it ; he died a few months before Clive, who had been recently elevated to the peerage, returned as governor-general to Calcutta."], [469, "455 THE ENGLISH IN INDIA. Lord Clive found the affairs of the presidency in a deplorable condition : the troops, goaded to madness by the insolence and rapacity of their officers, were in open mutiny; the fertile province of Bengal was \" marred to a wilderness\" by the most corrupt of all the corrupt bodies ever intrusted with its destinies; friendly native powers were estranged by systematic extortion ; hostile princes were confirmed in their enmity by witnessing such excesses of profligacy and peculation ; and, to complete his lordship's difficulties, his proceedings were controlled by a subordinate committee, wholly unused to subordination. Clive's zeal, in reforming such crying abuses, procured him a host of enemies, whose resistance was encouraged by their friends and patrons in the Court of Directors at home. The first outbreak of opposition was a general mutiny of the military officers, sup ported by a large subscription from the civilians in Calcutta. Through a defect in the Mutiny Act, the governor-general was not able to sentence any of the criminals to death, not even those who were found guilty of planning his assassination. Sir Robert Fletcher, the general in command of the army, was subsequently proved to be the instigator of the whole plot, and having been convicted by a court-martial, he was cashiered. But it must be added, that this very officer was subsequently appointed commander-in-chief of the army of Madras, where he headed the mutinous opposition by which Lord Pigot was removed from that government. Another of the mutineers, sent home by Clive, on charges that affected his life, obtained a very high appointment in the civil service of Bengal, by his party interest in the Court of Directors. Clive's firmness restored order in Calcutta ; and soon after, the substitution of British rule for the native viceroyalties in Bengal, removed the chief source of intrigue and peculation. But, in the mean time, the presidency at Madras was brought to the brink of ruin by the arms of Hyder Ali, whose abilities had raised him from the rank of a private soldier to that of an independent sovereign. After a protracted war, Sir Eyre Coote retrieved all the losses of the English, and, on the death of Hyder, concluded a treaty with his son Tippoo, on terms very advantageous to the.Company."], [470, "456 niSTORY OF COLONIZATION. The charters granted at various times to the Company only secured to it the exclusive right of trade ; when, therefore, it began to make territorial acquisitions, it became a serious constitutional question whether the British crown did not pos sess an inherent right to all provinces conquered by its subjects. The ministers, and especially Lord North, already embarrassed by the American war, were unwilling to attempt the decision of a matter encumbered with so many difficulties ; but the right of the British parliament to interfere in the affairs of India was virtually asserted by passing various acts of regulation, and the establishment of a custom of time-bargains with the Company, which were in fact mere expedients to escape, from difficulties becoming more complicated every hour. The administration of Mr. Warren Hastings greatly extended the Company's territories, and rendered its influence paramount in Northern India ; but the means which he employed were not always consistent with European notions of equity; and the disputes which arose between him and his council, fixed the attention of the British parliament and the British nation on the affairs of India. Mr. Fox, who was then in power, introduced a bill for transferring the government of India from the Court of Directors to a parliamentary committee, but the measure was frustrated by the reluctance of the king and the dismissal of the ministry. We have already noticed the impeachment of Mr. Hastings, and his acquittal, after a trial of unparalleled duration, by the House of Lords. At length an important change was made in the government of India, by the establishment of a Board of Control, according to a plan proposed by Mr. Pitt (a. d. 1784). The principal object of the new measure was to secure the obedience and responsibility of the Company's servants to the authorities in England, and to remedy the most glaring abuses of patronage by the Court of Directors. This measure, though not so stringent as it was originally intended to be, produced very beneficial effects, and introduced a system of subordination in which the presidencies had long been deficient. Lord Cornwallis was sent out as governor-general, under the new system ; he exerted himself to remedy some of the most"], [471, "457 TOE ENGLISH IN INDIA. flagrant abuses in the administration, and, though opposed by a majority of the supreme court at Calcutta, he partially succeeded. He soon began to look with suspicion on the ambitious projects of Tippoo Sultan, who had inherited his father Hyder's hostility to the English. Tippoo's intrigues were secretly encouraged by the French government, for sufficiently obvious reasons. The French had been the first to try the plan of acquiring territorial possessions, by interference in native wars, often excited by themselves ; and they had been completely defeated, while the English had as completely succeeded. Anger at this failure, too high an estimate of the injury which the British power had received from the loss of the American colonies, and a confident belief that our empire in the East was as insecure as it had proved in the West, were popular feelings in France, and were just as rife in the court of Versailles as they were at a later period in the jacobin clubs of Paris. The danger which Lord Cornwallis anticipated seemed more formidable to Mr. Pitt than to the Court of Directors, and led to a serious dispute between the ministry and the Company. The premier, through the Board of Control, insisted on sending regular British troops to India, and compelling the Company to pay for their support. This was regarded by the Court of Directors as an indirect effort on the part of the crown to grasp the patronage of the Indian army, and was of course strenuously resisted. Mr. Pitt settled the matter, by forcing through parliament, with all the influence at his command, an act of explanation ; but he had the morti fication to encounter a fierce opposition from many who were generally his staunchest supporters. The war with Tippoo, which rendered the English authority supreme from the river Krishna to Cape Comorin, soon followed. Lord Cornwallis havino- brought it to a prosperous termination, returned home, and was succeeded by Sir John Shore,- afterwards Lord Teignmouth. Durino- Sir John Shore's peaceful administration, the organi zation of the internal government of India was considerably improved ; but its most remarkable events were the interference of the Eno-lish, as armed arbitrators, in the disputed succession to the throne of Oude ; and the commencement of discontents, x"], [472, "458 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. almost amounting to mutinies, among the officers of the Indian army, in consequence of the reduction of their field allowances by the Court of Directors. The latter subject soon became one of increasing annoyance and even danger ; but the calamities which it threatened were fortunately averted by judicious measures of conciliation. Lord Mornington, afterwards marquis of Wellesley, was next appointed governor-general. His first efforts were directed to lessen the growing influence of the French in Hindustan ; finding Tippoo indisposed to form new engagements with the British government, war was declared against him, which, as we have already stated, ended in the defeat and death of that turbulent monarch. A subsequent war w-ith the Mahratta powers com pletely established British supremacy in India, and made the Company supreme in the Peninsula. But notwithstanding his brilliant services, the marquis of Wellesley was thwarted in many important points of policy by the Court of Directors. The chief of these were the emjdoyment of India-built ships, the establishment of a college for the education of civil servants at Calcutta, and the patronage of certain appointments, which the Court wished to reserve for its favourites. This last differ ence led to very angry remonstrances, both from the marquis of Wellesley and Lord Clive, who was governor of Madras. Lord Clive resigned his situation ; and on quitting Madras, addressed a spirited remonstrance to the Court of Directors, in which the inefficiency, insubordination, and delinquency of many of their servants, were directly traced to the abuse of patronage, and to the encouragement which the idle and the dissolute, possessing interest with the court, received from authority superior to the local government. Lord Wellesley, supported by the Board of Control, retained his place in defiance of the court, and, by his successful management of the Mahratta war, bore down all opposition. The great extent of country gained in the Mahratta w-ar gave rise to serious embarassments after the marquis of Wellesley had returned to Europe ; his successor, Lord Cornwallis, died before completing the requisite arrangements, and Sir George Barlow, who acted as vice-governor, adopted a line of policy directly"], [473, "THE ENGLISH IN INDIA. 459 contrary to that which had received the sanction of his prede cessor. This change led to an angry controversy with the English ministers (Lord Grenville and Mr. Fox), respecting the appointment of a successor to the marquis of Cornwallis. The ministers nominated Lord Lauderdale to the vacant office, the Court of Directors insisted that Sir George Barlow should retain his power. After a very long negotiation, both parties agreed to withdraw the rival candidates, and they finally concurred in selecting Lord Minto as governor-general. When Lord Minto reached Madras, his attention was directed to certain transactions in that presidency, too important to be omitted even in this brief outline of Indian history. Lord William Bentinck succeeded Lord Clive (afterwards earl of Powis) in the government of Madras, and, like his predecessor, was involved in serious disputes with the local council and the subordinate servants of the Company. In the midst of these discussions, a dangerous mutiny of the native Indian army at Vellore furnished a pretext for recalling the obnoxious governor with something like censure. In the Indian army no native could attain the rank of a commissioned officer ; many of the sepoys were Mohammedans, and they could not forget how very recently the entire Peninsula of India was their own ; the deposed dynasty of Mysore, including Tippoo's family and several of his ministers, were on the spot to aggravate these feelings of natural discontent ; and the fakirs, or preaching friars of Mohamme danism, lent their aid to fan the flame. A regulation respecting the head-dress of the troops was the pretext for revolt; though the shape of the sepoy turban had no more connexion with the real cause of the mutiny, than the colour of the roses with the rival claims of the houses of York and Lancaster. The insur rection was suppressed, and the leniency which Lord William Bentinck was disposed to show towards the mutineers, gave great displeasure to many influential persons, and though it was sanctioned by Lord Minto, Lord W. Bentinck returned home. When Lord Minto reached Calcutta (a. d. 1809), he prepared to adopt a system of policy, which had long been a favourite scheme with the Court of Directors, and indeed with the great majority of the people of England. This was simply to intro- X 2"], [474, "460 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. duce the European principle of a balance of power into India ; \u2014 no plan could be more excellent in theory, but it was impossible to reduce it to practice, for no materials existed in the disor ganized governments of India, from which such a system could be constructed. The Company had ever opposed the coloniza tion of India by Europeans, and had therefore rather occupied than possessed its successive acquisitions ; with the exception of its hired servants (and not all of them), there was not a single individual interested in maintaining its sway ; its soldiers were mere mercenaries, its subjects utterly indifferent to the con tinuance of its sway. In pursuit of this favourite but hopeless project, the establishment of a balance of power, Lord Minto committed many serious errors, but his administration was on the whole very beneficial to England, especially as he was among the first to appreciate the value of the Indian Archipelago, with which our commerce is so rapidly increasing, both in extent and importance. His prudence terminated a very serious dispute between the civil and military authorities at Madras, which had nearly produced the most calamitous results ; he tried the expe riment of neutral policy with greater success than could have attended such a system in less able hands ; and when he at length perceived that \" the balance of power\" was inapplicable to the state of society in India, he acknowledged the change in his opinions with a manly candour which is too rarely met with among modern statesmen. The earl of Moira, afterwards marquis of Hastings, succeeded Lord Minto in the government. He was forced to abandon the neutral line of policy, by which the Goorkas, or wild tribes of the mountains of Nepaul, had been encouraged to encroach upon the territories both of the British and their allies. War was declared ; the Goorkas proved more formidable enemies than the Company's troops had yet encountered, but they were finally overcome, and the provinces ceded by the Nepaulese as the price of peace brought the English dominions into close contact with the frontiers of the Chinese empire. In the mean time Central India was devastated by ferocious bands of -freebooters, known by the same of Pindarries, and extensive combinations were formed for their suppression. The treachery and duplicity"], [475, "461 THE ENGLISH IN INDIA. of several of the native powers on this occasion compelled the marquis of Hastings to demand from them considerable cessions of territory ; and, at the conclusion of the war, the Company felt itself bound to retain these acquisitions, not only as essential to its own interests, but to those of the native inhabitants. Of greater importance than all these provinces was the establish ment of a British settlement at Singapore (a. d. 1819), by which its present share in the lucrative commerce of the Indian Archi pelago was secured to Great Britain. The earl of Amherst, who had previously been sent on an embassy to China, was the next governor-general (a. d. 1823). In a few months after his arrival, he found himself constrained to adopt active measures for repressing the insults and encroach ments of the Burmese. The war was one of more than ordinary difficulty, but it finally terminated to the advantage of the British, who obtained possession of many new and valuable provinces. Scarcely less important was the capture of Bhurt pore, a fortress fondly believed impregnable by the natives of Hindustan (a. d. 1826) ; its conquest therefore tended not a little to increase that general sense of British superiority on which the security of our Indian empire mainly depends. Earl Amherst was succeeded by Lord W. Bentinck, whose generally peaceful administration is principally remarkable for a series of financial reforms in every department of the government. But the expiration of the Company's charter, and the arrange ments for its renewal, led to a total change of system (a. d. 1833). The Company was deprived of its exclusive right of trade ; the commerce with India and China was opened freely to all British subjects ; the political government of Hindustan was continued to the Company for twenty years, but all its other rights and possessions were ceded to the nation for an annuity of six hundred and thirty thousand pounds, secured by a guarantee fund of two millions sterling. From this brief sketch of Indian history, it is manifest that the lust of conquest was not the cause of the extension of the Company's dominions, and that almost every departure from the pacific system was caused either by the ambition or the perfidy of the native Indian powers. It remains only to say,"], [476, "462 HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. that the attention of statesmen is now earnestly directed to the establishment of a system for consolidating the British dominions in India, and securing them against aggression, by developing their internal resources, and winning from the inhabitants a reasonable allegiance, founded upon gratitude for experienced protection and acknowledged benefits."], [477, "463 CHAPTER XIV. GENERAL VIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. Section I. \u2014 The Nature of Civilization, as an object of Historical Inquiry. Notwithstanding the great diversity in the history of the various nations of Europe, and the changes in kingdoms and empires which, as the tables, at the end of this chapter will show, give a different aspect to every century, there is one series of facts by which all these vicissitudes are connected, and that series is the progress of civilization. To this, the most general, as well as' the most important topic in the history of mankind, we invariably refer all other facts in the history of an age or a nation. Institutions, commercial relations, wars, and the details of government are investigated, not so much for their own sake, as for the purpose of determining how far they have contributed to human improvement, and whether they have assisted or retarded the advance of civilization. Let us then inquire what is the nature of this important fact, by which all others are estimated and judged, and let us then apply it to the events recorded in the preceding pages, that we may be able to profit by the lessons w-hich it is the proper business of history to inculcate. Civilization simply means the progressive improvement of men in civil life, and it thus includes two distinct parts, a better organization of society, and the moral elevation of the individual man. The difference between the two may be easily exempli fied ; when Moses, by the Divine command, gave a body of laws to the chosen people of God, he raised them far above the"], [478, "464 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. nations by which they were surrounded, because their social relations were fixed and determined, because laws devised by infinite wisdom organized the form of their society. On the other hand, when Christianity was preached by our Redeemer, it proposed no organic change in the social state, but it ameliorated and purified the inner man : its operations were directed to man's belief, to his sentiments and to his impulses, \u2014 he became a new creature morally and intellectually. Hence we see that the outward progress of civilization, that is, the improve ment of the social relations is the more striking in its appearance and the more immediate in its effects ; but that the second form of civilization, that which results from the moral elevation of the individual mind, is far more beneficial and more lasting. Another and an equally important consideration suggests itself; few changes have been made in social institutions without confusion and bloodshed, and on many occasions, the evils conse quent on the revolution have been greater than those which that revolution was designed to remove, \u2014 but the moral improvement of man is a peaceful movement, working its way silently but surely, and bringing no ills in its train to depreciate the blessings it confers. These two forms of civilization, so far from being incon sistent with each other, are always found to co-operate. The establishment of a representative form of government in England not only improved the relations of the different ranks of society, but formed habits of thought in the minds of individuals, which led them to free inquiry, and prepared them for rejecting the yoke which the papacy had imposed on the national intellect ; and, on the other hand, the moral improvement resulting from the reformed doctrines enabled British statesmen so to improve our social institutions that they became a model for the rest of Europe. It is in this connexion that we can most distinctly trace the Providence which rules over the moral destinies of mankind ; for on a close inspection we discover that improve ment is never lost. Vast intervals of time may separate the two great facts of civilization; centuries, for instance, elapsed before the moral regeneration of man by Christianity exercised its legitimate influence on the social state, \u2014 nevertheless, it did"], [479, "465 NATURE OF CIVILIZATION. succeed, and it rescued Europe from the brutal despotism of Asia or the barbarous anarchy of Africa. It must also be observed, that the moral improvement of humanity is superior to the improvement of the social state, not only in permanence and efficacy, but also in importance. Insti tutions rise, wither and decay ; all forms of society, empires, monarchies and republics have their appointed destiny, but when they have disappeared, man still remains behind, invested with the faculties by which he raises himself above the con siderations of this transitory world and contemplates the mysteries of futurity and eternity. But the history of humanity thus contemplated is more properly the duty of the philosopher than the historian ; in the following pages we must confine ourselves chiefly to the effects of civilization on the outward forms of society, and we shall commence by seeking its germs in the condition of Europe at the time when the fall of the Roman empire made a complete revolution both in its political and social state. In all ancient forms of civilization, and in those which still prevail in Asia, the most remarkable characteristic is their unity. In ancient Egypt as in ancient India, the constitution of government and the minute usages of private life were based upon religion ; in ancient Persia as in modern China, despotism prescribed all the forms of public life, and permitted no deviation from them ; in Greece the republics were either pure aristocra cies or pure democracies; aud the power of the Roman empire was based on the simple principle of force. From this circum stance it followed, that almost every ancient state was more or less a tyranny ; for republics punished dissent as severely as despotic monarchies ; whatever principle prevailed, it prohibited the manifestation and action of any other to which it was opposed. But with the civilization of modem Europe the case is far different ; the elements which in ancient times existed separately, present themselves to us mixed and blended together ; possessing in different ages and countries different degrees of liberty, of influence, and of abundance. We have seen in the preceding pages, monarchies allied with republics, aristocratic cantons confederated with pure democracies, and in our own x 3"], [480, "466 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. country, three different forms of government combined in one harmonious whole ; the church, the state, the nobles, and the commons modifying and limiting each other, but even in the combat of political strife rarely if ever seeking the extinction of its adversary. The same diversity is exhibited in the public mind of modern Europe, and is particularly remarkable in its literature, which may be regarded as the expression of mind. In single departments of literature, such as epic or dramatic poetry and the fine arts, the ancients have left us examples which cannot be surpassed in modern times ; but on the other hand, European civilization taken as a whole is incomparably more rich than any other, because it had advanced in countless different directions at the same time. Before entering on the consideration of the European system, it is necessary to cast a glance at the system of the Roman empire by which it was preceded. In the first volume of this Manual, we have shown that Rome was originally a munici pality ; and that the extension of its empire was nothing but the conquest and foundation of a great number of cities. Such an empire could only be held together by the compressive force of despotism, and this necessity was so evident, that we find every where after the reign of Augustus, a deep respect for the majesty of the Roman empire, which was regarded as inviolable and sacred. When that majesty became despicable under such feeble emperors as Arcadius and Honorius, the municipal spirit began to acquire fresh strength, and it produced an isolation and want of unity which greatly facilitated the overthrow of the empire by the barbarians. It is now time to direct our attention to another principle which was growing up while that of imperial majesty declined, which succeeded to its influence, and which became the source of the future pre-eminence of modern Europe. That principle was Christianity, not existing as a simple creed, but in the organized form of an established church. Humanly speaking, and viewing only the natural consequences of events, it is evident on the slightest consideration, that to the existence of the Christian church as au establishment in the fifth century, modern Europe is indebted for the maintenance of"], [481, "467 NATURE OF CIVILIZATION. religion and the preservation of those elements of civilization which survived the ravages of the Northern pagans. In a recent account of the fall of an avalanche in Switzerland, it is said that the spire of the church, rising above the mass of snow, showed the spot where the village stood, and directed the labours of those who cleared away the superincumbent mass ; just so the Christian church in the fifth century rose above the hosts of the barbarians, and afforded a centre round which the survivors might rally when the tide of the destroyers had swept past. But when the Northern hordes overthrew the might of the Roman empire and removed so many ancient institutions, they also introduced a new principle into European civilization, utterly unknown to the ancient world. This principle was the feeling of personal independence, the assertion of individual liberty. In every- ancient form of government, whether a monarchy or a republic, we find the same principle established, that the state was everything and the individual nothing; the Germanic tribes, on the other hand, cared little for the interest of their society, but asserted everywhere the freedom- of individual action. Even when Christianity taught them to have some feeling of unity, they declared their determination to maintain personal freedom in a phrase which has descended to our times in the form of a vulgar proverb, \" Every man for himself, and God for us all.\" From this feeling of personal independence another element of civilization w-as derived, which became of great importance in the earlier stages of European society ; this was the sentiment of military patronage, the personal attachment of the soldier to his leader ; the warriors of Greece and Rome fought for their city or their state, \u2014 the German fought for his general, and served as a friend rather than a subject. When the Germanic tribes became stationary, this relationship was changed into that of lord and vassal, and it thus easily degenerated into the feudal system. Thus in the very first origin of European civilization, we find the characteristics of its diversity strongly marked. We discover three distinct states of society: the old municipalities remaining"], [482, "468 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. from the Roman empire ; the ecclesiastical society, constituting an oro-anized and united body; and the society of the barbarians ; all founded on different principles, and all inspiring different sentiments. So long as fresh hordes continued to come from the deserts, like wave after wave, the barbarous element predomi nated and prevented the organization of society; but when .these invasions ceased, the Christian church presented a model of re on lar o-ovemment, and inculcated a reverence for order, which tauo-ht the necessity of similarly establishing political constitu tions. In these we shall find the Germanic element most prevalent at their first formation ; it was then victorious over all Europe, and it stamped on the new institutions the mark and impress of its triumph. Section II. \u2014 Organization of European Society. When the great movement of the successive barbarous invasions terminated, the conquerors began to settle on the lands which they had acquired by their swords ; the hordes became sta tionary, the limits of property were fixed, and the relations between man and man were no longer subject to the vicissitudes of force or chance. With a fixed residence man naturally acquired new ideas and sentiments ; he began to attach himself to the localities he inhabited, the relations he formed, the domains which he hoped to transmit to his children ; he learned to value the house which was ere long to become his castle, and to attach importance to the huts of his slaves and vassals, which hereafter might form a village. Thus individual independence was ex changed for the independence of little societies, linked together by a species of confederation, which left to each its separate rights and interests. In this confederacy a certain subordination of services and of rights was loosely established, and the whole formed what is usually called the feudal system. Such a system was required by the state of society, and the proof of its necessity is the universality of its adoption. Even the elements most contrary to this system were forced to accommodate themselves"], [483, "ORGANIZATION OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY. 469 to it ; churches and cities became lords and vassals ; royalty itself was only a superior lordship. Everything was given in fief, not only- lands, but the right of fisheries in rivers, of cutting timber in forests, of receiving baptismal fees in the church, and levying market dues in the city. But this uniformity- was more apparent than real; the church retained its theocratic spirit, royalty its monarchical principle, and the municipalities their love of democracy, and all struggled separately against the common yoke of feudalism. The feudal system produced a remarkable change in the territorial distribution of the population. We have seen that under the systems of Greece and Rome the cities were not only predominant, but that the rural population possessed no impor tance whatever. The great proprietors lived in cities, because citizens alone were members of a state, and largo tracts of land remained the property of the community, that is of the sove reign population of the metropolis. But after feudalism was established, the landed proprietors lived isolated on their respec tive estates, their habitations were separated from each other by wide intervals ; public property was changed into private pro perty, and public life into private life. Hence the feudal lord acquired high ideas of his self-importance, a pride of birth and station belonging to him individually, and not, as was the case in the ancient aristocracies, derived from his being a member of a patrician body. A still more important result was the force given to the ties of family and the relations of domestic life. Surrounded only by inferiors, the feudal lord could find few com panions but his wife and his children ; hence home became his place of pride, and, as a necessary consequence, women were elevated to a rank in the social system which they had never attained in the most civilized states of antiquity. But as the lord felt that his importance rested on his fief, he in some measure identified the fief with himself, and took every precaution to secure the succession for his family; hence the principle of inheritance was never more strictly maintained than under the feudal system. To the vassals, on the other hand, feudalism was essentially an oppressive and vicious system. There was nothing in common,"], [484, "470 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. nothino- which could constitute a moral tie between the possessor of the fief and the serfs by whom it was cultivated. The culti vators were as much the property of the lord as the land itself ; he gave what laws and levied what taxes he pleased, punished at his discretion, and could even sell his vassals as cattle. Hence arises the intense hatred with which the feudal system has been ever regarded by the peasants of Europe, and the readiness they have so often manifested to exchange its yoke for that of the most rigorous despotism. The tenure by which a fief was held was the performance of certain specified duties and services to the state ; the relation between the sovereign and his feudal lords, and between the lord and his vassals, implied protection on the one hand, and the fulfilment of duty on the other. Hence the system necessarily inculcated principles of fidelity, devotedness, and loyalty to obligations, which had a tendency to develop themselves in insti tutions. Feudal rights were strictly defined, and various juris dictions established to enforce them, but there was no guarantee for the enforcement of judicial decrees, because the sovereign was without authority, and the influence of public opinion scarcely existed. From these considerations it follows that feudalism exercised a great, and, on the whole, a salutary- influence over the intel lectual development of man considered as an individual, because it inspired energetic sentiments and created moral necessities. On the contrary, in the social point of view, it could neither establish legal order nor political guarantees ; it was therefore opposed to the interests of the king and of the people, and we shall see that it gradually yielded to the efforts of both. The rival of feudalism, in its influence over the human mind and the state of society, from the fifth to the twelfth century, was the Christian church. It had one decisive advantage over every other system of the period, the completeness of its organi zation ; the municipalities had fallen into ruin, royalty was little more than a name, feudalism was a complete chaos, but the Christian church had a fixed and definite form; it alone combined the two great elements of influence, which are, energy, and order. It stood between the people and the feudal lords, and controlled"], [485, "ORGANIZATION OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY. 471 while it connected both. In the Church, as it was then constituted, two principles prevailed, \u2014 first, the nomination of the inferior clergy by their superiors, and, secondly, the election of the supe rior by the inferiors. In the ordination of priests, for instance, the power of selecting fit candidates for the priestly office was entrusted to the bishops; on the other hand, bishops were generally elected by the chapters, abbots by their monks, and the pope by the college of cardinals. These principles were often opposed to each other ; the former eventually triumphed, and thus led to all the abuses of the papacy. But while the principle of election prevailed, the Church was the most popular society, the most accessible, the most open to talent and to honourable ambition. But its constitution was not wholly without fault, for it prohibited the exercise of reason in matters of faith, and its authorities arrogated to themselves the right of proscribing and punishing what they regarded as errors of belief. The great blessing conferred by the Church on humanity was, that it controlled the temporal power when that power was possessed by barbarians ; but this blessing was lost, or rather changed into a curse, when the rulers of the Church summoned the secular arm to aid in the persecution of heretics. Gregory VII., better known by his conventual name Hilde brand, was the first who attempted to emancipate the Church from the yoke of feudalism, and to raise it to the rank of an independent power. He was in his day a reformer, because the abuses which existed in the collation of ecclesiastical benefices as temporal fiefs were fast bringing religion into disrepute. His design was to establish popery as an intellectual supremacy, and the plan succeeded so long as learning was confined exclusively to the Church. But when a spirit of examination arose in the schools and the cloisters, the Church, in its anxiety to maintain exclusive possession of knowledge, placed itself in opposition to the growth of intelligence, and was thus engaged in a contest with the very principle by which Gregory VII. designed to secure its perpetual domination. While the spirit of free inquiry was growing up within the pale of the ecclesiastical institutions themselves, a political move ment of a different nature introduced important modifications"], [486, "472 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. into the feudal system : this was the establishment of munici palities or corporations in the chief mercantile cities. It is very singular that these two advances, apparently similar in their nature, were for ages directly opposed to each other. Heretics were nowhere more bitterly persecuted than in the free cities, and municipal institutions had no opponents more virulent than the writers who advocated freedom of inquiry and of thought. The municipalities generally originated in associations for self-defence ; the extortions of the feudal lords, their open robberies on the high roads, in which princes, prelates, and even ladies joined, compelled merchants and traders to combine for their mutual protection. This was in fact an insurrection against the feudal tyrants, and the associations or corporations generally levied war in the capacity of sovereigns. The charters which they subsequently obtained were to all intents and purposes treaties of peace ; which the contracting parties were too ready to violate whenever it suited their interests. In no small degree were the characteristics of the feudal system maintained in the municipalities. They were as local as the fiefs, and though many circumstances brought them into more immediate contact with the royal authority, yet the cities, like the feudal lords, always regarded their individual interests as far more important than those of the nation. But the struggle between the lords and the citizens tended greatly to raise the moral character of the latter, and eventually to inspire those large views which can alone produce benefit to the community. In the twelfth century the citizen merchant had his cuirass on his breast, his pike in his hand, his faculties always on the alert to maintain those privileges by which alone his property was secured. His life was nearly as perilous and warlike as that of the feudal lords against whom he fought, and he thus acquired a manliness and energy of character, such as could not be expected from the traders of more modern and peaceful times. But we should make a very gross error if we regarded the municipalities of the twelfth century as perfect or in all cases beneficial institutions. Their interior organization rested on two simple principles, \u2014 a general assembly- of the inhabitants, and an arbitrary administration of the government. But the inhabitants"], [487, "ORGANIZATION OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY. 473 of the municipal towns were for the most part as ignorant, brutal, and ferocious as the serfs iu the country ; and in a very short time, life and property were exposed to as much danger in the cities as in the open fields ; hence the higher classes of the merchants in most continental countries became so afraid of the tyranny of the lower classes, that they generally sought alliance with the kings or the nobles. Many circumstances contributed to avert such a consummation in England, but none more than the wars of the Roses, w-hich greatly weakened the monarchy, and mowed down the flower of the aristocracy. Royalty was an element of European civilization, the latest to receive its full development, but the most influential in its effects, for it became the key-stone of the whole system. This institu tion grew up to its proper height between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, and to appreciate its growth, we must look at the circumstances of the period. The great series of events which first demands our attention is the crusades, and we must examine carefully the character of these wars. The first great feature in the crusades is their universality ; all Europe shared in these wars; they were the first event which gave to all Christian nations a community- of feelings and of interest, and thus they created Christendom. Although the Franks were the chief leaders in the first crusades, they were joined by numerous volunteers from Italy, Germany, Spain, and England*. But the second and third crusade were still more decisively European enterprises, \u2014 every Christian nation took a share in them. But their universality did not destroy their nationality; every class in every country felt a lively \u2022 \" England (the pope's pack-horse in that age, which seldom rested in the stable when there was any work to be done) sent many brave men under Robert, duke of Normandy, as Beauchamp, and others whose names are lost. Neither surely did the Irishmen's feet stick fast in their bogs, though we find no particular mention of their achievements.\" \u2014 Fuller. Robert of Gloucester gives the following curious muster-roll of the nations which supplied warriors to the Crusades. There were men, he says, Of Normandy, of Denmark, of Norway, of Bretagne, Of Wales and of Ireland, of Gascony and Spain, Of Provence and of Saxony, and of Allemagne, Of Scotland and of Greece, of Rome and Aquitam."], [488, "474 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. interest in these wars; they produced a public opinion, by which they were afterwards maintained. But the crusades soon enlarged the views of those who engaged in the strife ; even wars have the effect of introducing enemies to the acquaintance of each other, and when the Chris tians had opportunities of investigating the character of the Mussulmans, they ceased to regard them as idolaters and infidels, whose extermination was an act of duty towards God. The increase of commerce during those wars tended greatly to diminish the ardour for adventure and military enterprise which led the earlier warriors to enlist themselves under the banner of the cross. Fanaticism was burned out by the heat of its own fire, and human activity was turned into new spheres of action. The crusades, in short, dispelled the ignorance in which they originated, and broke the mental thraldom which the papacy had established. These wars also produced a remarkable change in the feudal constitution : the small fiefs either wholly disappeared or were rendered dependent on the great fiefs ; and in the same way the smaller municipalities were absorbed in general confederations of large trading communities, and thus society began to assume a permanent form, and mutual interests were proved to be of more importance than isolated and individual gain. The business of government was at once simplified by this transformation of the elements of society, and all the varied and clashing materials we have described were reduced to two \u2014 the rulers on one side and the people on the other. This definite condition of European society was formed between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries ; wo have already seen how directly the crusades tended to produce this desirable change, and we have now to examine the growth of royalty, which materially aided the transformation, and finally gave it stability. The institution of monarchy has been found to exist in all ages and nations ; even republics, when they were not in a state of complete anarchy, were subject to some sort of kingly control under another name. Hence it follows that monarchy is a constitution resulting from the very nature of society ; and, when we consider it more attentively, we find that it results from the feelings"], [489, "ORGANIZATION OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY. 475 which all men entertain towards the sovereignty of justice. The necessity for such a sovereign power is more deeply felt in an age of anarchy, because then the abuses resulting from the violence of parties, and the unregulated will of individuals, are more glaring and more injurious. Hence monarchs are always found to have gained most power immediately after a period of anarchy. The despotism of Augustus C\u00e6sar arose from the civil wars between Julius C\u00e6sar and Pompey; the contests for the French crow-n between the Plantagenets and the House of Valois led to the supremacy of royalty in France, and the wars of the Roses were the source of the almost absolute sovereignty exercised by the Tudor family in England. Des cending to more modern times, we see the civil wars of England followed by the usurpation of Cromwell, the French revolution terminating in the accession of Napoleon to absolute power,\"and Louis Philippe exercising a more despotic authority in several instances than the unfortunate monarch for whom he was sub stituted. Monarchy also is an eminently conservative institu tion ; republics are proverbially of short duration, and when attacked either from without or within, their dissolution is certain : the despotic power of the sovereigns alone saved the Roman world from anarchy and from ruin. But the Eastern or Byzantine empire gives us the best example of the conservative force of royalty. No republic, of which we have either heard or read, could have resisted, for a quarter of a century, the operation of any of the single causes which, during a thousand years, combined for its destruction. Externally surrounded by foes superior in number, in discipline, and in valour, it seemed as if its safety was guaranteed by cowardice, and its security confirmed by defeat. Internally were at work all the causes which usually effect the destruction of states; perfidy and profligacy triumphant in the palace ; ferocious bigotry, based at once on enthusiasm and hypocrisy, ruling the church; civil dissensions, equally senseless and bloody, distracting the state ; complete demoralization pervading every rank of society from the palace to the cottage,\u2014 such were the elements of ruin, not antagonized but combined, whose destructive energies slumbered not during ten centuries, and were yet resisted during that long"], [490, "476 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. lapse of ages by an empire, which to call feeble were sadly to overrate its strength. The crusaders who visited Constantinople on their way to Palestine, could not help being struck by this forcible example of the institution of monarchy, alone and unaided, preventing the total dissolution of society. They brought home with them opinions of royalty quite different from those which had hitherto prevailed in Western Europe ; for the barbarous monarchy of the Germans was elective, and even after the right of inheritance had been established by custom and convenience, some form of election was preserved. In the Gothic monarchies a religious element was introduced ; the kings were regarded as the des cendants of the national gods or heroes, and therefore as possess ing an inherent divine right to the throne. But in whatever way monarchy was regarded, it was practically found to be the only remedy for the evils resulting from the disorganized state of society; men felt the want of a power somewhere, which would restrain both their neighbours and themselves ; in fact, they wanted a king, who could occupy the post of chief magis trate in the country. We have now seen the elements from which European civili zation was formed, we have perceived that they were inde pendent of each other, and have shown that the struggle between them compelled men to inquire out the best means of securing social order and establishing public tranquillity. Section III. \u2014 The Form of European Civilization. The feudal nobility, the clergy, and the municipalities, long resisted the tendency of circumstances to fuse them into one mass, and place them as portions of the people in their due relation to the sovereign power. They all failed in their great object, but each was more or less successful in different countries, and the contest has left distinctive traces in almost every European country. In Germany the feudal nobles maintained the form of independent existence ; in Spain, the Church pre served a power paramount to that of the state ; and in England,"], [491, "THE FORM OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. 477 the municipalities exercised a remarkable influence over the government, by returning members to the House of Commons. All of these struggled against monarchy, and against each other ; and it will be now necessary to look at the circumstances of the contests. The Church was foremost in the assertion of its exclusive claims ; and it had many seeming advantages which at first promised a triumph to the ecclesiastical body. But it had to encounter obstacles w-hich rendered permanent success impossible, and the first of these was Christianity itself. The religion of the Gospel was connected with no fixed political form \u2014 it aimed to subdue the mind, not the body, and, consequently, though the clergy, acquired considerable wealth and influence, they never possessed what could properly be called power, meaning by that word direct government. There were always Church and State, but the church was never the state. The feudal nobles were also inveterate enemies of ecclesiastical usurpation ; and as they met it in every direction, the popes found their plan of a theocracy sternly opposed in every part of Christendom. But even an abuse of the Church, which was devised to extend its influence, was a serious impediment to the acquisition of political power. Wherever theocracy has succeeded, the clero-y has been a hereditary caste, but the court of Rome imposed celibacy upon its ministers, and was thus compelled to get recruits from every class of society. Men could not lose all their ancient feelings when they became priests, \u2014 those who were ordained from the ranks of the nobles, the citizens, and the peasants, retained sympathies with the class from which they sprung, and opposed to the interests of that in which they were enrolled. Romanists frequently boast of the unity of the Church before the Reformation ; there never was a more absurd assertion. Never was there a society more torn by civil dissen sions than the ecclesiastical body during the middle ages. Heresies and schisms were rising every day, councils and synods battled with each other, and with the popes ; rival heads of the Church poured out anathemas on the pretensions and supporters of their opponents ; in fact, had not Christianity been of Divine origin, it must have been destroyed by the crimes and follies of its ministers."], [492, "478 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. The municipalities of Italy and the South of France were quite unable to perpetuate, much less extend their republican organization ; they wanted political unity, which was the cause why the Church so long maintained its claims to supremacy, and of course they fell before the superior force of kings and emperors. The Albigensian war was not simply a crusade against heretics, \u2014 it was also a contest between the feudal organization of the North and the republican constitution of the South. Modern European society properly commences in the fifteenth century; during its progress the principle of centralization was first developed. A comparison between that and the preceding centuries, in the tables at the end of this chapter, will show how much had been effected towards preventing the changes in the outward form of nations, and their geographical boundaries. But equally great was the change within every European state ; classes and localities no longer attended solely to their exclusive interests, but began to comprehend the meaning of the interests of the community. In this age, for the first time, we find leagues formed for the maintenance of the balance of power, and from this period we find that the most important portions of European history are the records of its diplomacy-. Wars, negotiations, and alliances, are the leading features of our details, a clear proof that the independent powers of the nobles, the clergy, and the people, were absorbed in the royal preroga tive, that is to say, in the central power. It is singular that in the Church as well as in the State, the central power of the popes similarly triumphed over that of the national churches and the general councils. So great was the necessity for some reformation, that it was attempted in two different shapes at the same moment. Within the Church, the bishops, at the councils of Basil and Constance, attempted some timid and feeble alterations ; without the Church, a far bolder and more effectual change was undertaken by John Huss and Jerome of Prague. The two systems of reform were hostile to each other, and the papacy triumphed over both. It was a fatal victory, for if the moderate reforms proposed by the councils had been adopted, it is exceedingly probable that the"], [493, "THE FORM OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. 479 efforts for a more extensive popular reform would never have been renewed. But the papacy remained obstinate and blind, at the very moment that intelligence was everywhere making the most rapid progress. The fall of Constantinople, which spread the learning of Greece over Western Europe, the discovery of America and the passage round the Cape of Good Hope, the general use of gunpowder and the mariner's compass in Europe, the invention of printing, and the art of paper-making, and other similar events, gave to this age a grandeur and activity which in the next were to be directed against the papacy, because it was the most obstinate power in its resistance to change. Early in the sixteenth century, the spirit of popular reform, which had been checked by the destruction of Huss and the overthrow of his followers, burst forth with resistless strength. Martin Luther (a.d. 1520) publicly burned Pope Leo's bull in Wittemberg, and thus formally proclaimed war against the Romish church. From this period to the treaty of Westphalia (a. d. 1648), religion seemed on the point of banishing diplomacy from the earth. It is no small proof of the Providence that superintends the moral government of mankind, to observe that the period of this great struggle was precisely that in which it could be least injurious to civilization. At an earlier period, the Church would probably have triumphed ; at a later, religion itself might have suffered in the contest, as it notoriously did in France during the first Revolution. The more we examine the point, the more we see that the hand of God may be traced as distinctly in the moral as in the physical world. In the first place, the wars of religion were not unconnected with politics ; they were intimately joined with the struggle for superiority between Charles V. and Francis I., and subsequently with the rivalry between the kings of France and the emperors of Austria. The wars of the League in France were in a great degree caused by the efforts of the feudal aristocracy to recover the inde pendence which the crown had wrested from its great vassals ; the revolution of Holland was directed against the tyranny- as well as the bigotry of Philip II ; the revolutions in Sweden and Prussia, and the civil wars of England between Charles I. and"], [494, "480 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. his parliament, are all strongly marked by the mixture of political with religious motives, in which the former were generally the more powerful, and the latter those which were the more openly avowed. From this struggle a new principle was elicited, the freedom of thought, the right of investigation, a principle at the first reprobated as strenuously by the reformers as by their adversaries, but which triumphed in spite of both, and rendered the age one of the most memorable in the annals of the human race. It was the age of Shakspeare, of Bacon, and of Milton, the age when the greatest advances were made in every department of knowledge. We have now seen the two great principles which resulted from the varied struggles of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\u2014 first, the centralization of power, or pure monarchy ; and, second, the spirit of free inquiry. Both triumphed at the expense of the papacy, and the latter would have utterly destroyed it, only that the heads and defenders of the Romish church knew their own objects, and were agreed upon the end and aim of their actions, while the reformers had not made up their minds as to what they would substitute for the Romish church, and were besides hopelessly divided amongst themselves. The popes seized the opportunity of entering into alliance with the spirit of pure monarchy, and thenceforward popery and arbitrary power were united against the spirit of free inquiry. It was impossible to avoid a collision, and England was the scene of the battle. Charles II., a Romanist in his heart and the pensioner of Louis XIV., the great champion both of popery and despotism, was fortunately a weak voluptuary, else the popular favour which he had acquired by his captivating manners might probably have enabled him to destroy the civil and religious liberties of this country. James II., more bigoted and more imprudent, provoked the nation to revolt, he was compelled to abdicate, and while the Protestant religion was secured by one series of laws, the liberties of the people were confirmed by another. We should sadly underrate the importance of the revolution of 1688, if we supposed that its influence was confined to England ; on the contrary, its effects were felt in every quarter of"], [495, "481 FORM OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. Europe, and it roused the principal nations to resist the project of Louis XIV., for establishing not only pure but universal monarchy. During the reigns of Charles II. and James II. England belonged to Louis ; after the Revolution it took its proper place at the head of the confederacy, and in the front of the battle for defending the civil and religious liberty of Christendom. At the commencement of the seventeenth century, we find England and France at the head of European civilization ; the former as the representative of constitutional monarchy, the latter the champion of pure despotism. They were forced into hostile collision and England triumphed, but the spirit of free inquiry gained a still more decided victory, which it fearfully abused. Europe was inundated by a flood of scepticism ; every principle of religion and of government was questioned, insulted, and scorned. Creeds, institutions, and the very organization of society, were assailed by infidels, who called themselves philo sophers, but whose philosophy was simply to destroy every thing and to establish nothing. The revolution through which England had passed with honour and safety, was, therefore, to take place in France, under circumstances which could not fail to produce the most frightful results. The pages of the pre ceding history contain the details of this terrible convulsion, from the effects of which Europe has scarcely yet recovered. But this event has not been unproductive of beneficial conse quences to civilization ; it has taught the world the benefit of fixed institutions ; it has shown that the true mode of correcting abuses is to renovate, not to destroy. The lesson was wanting which would instruct mankind to dread the despotism of any single principle of government, and to show that the tyranny of a mob is to the full as pernicious and iniquitous as the tyranny of a single despot or a body of nobles. The principle that the true and only security for a system of good government, depends upon a system of checks and balances, all held in their places by a central force, has not yet produced its full influence in Europe, but there is no doubt that its influence is extending widely and rapidly. Internally we find that political changes are effected with far less violence than accompanied similar convulsions in Y"], [496, "482 PROGRESS OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION. the last century ; and externally, the disputes between nations are more frequently adjusted by diplomacy and negotiation than by war. Section IV. \u2014 Concluding Remarks. The history of civilization immediately directs our attention to the Providential government of human affairs ; we cannot com prehend the whole course of Providence in the moral administra tion of the world, because \" the end is not yet,\" and, therefore, only a limited portion comes under our observation. But even in that limited part, we can see manifest evidence of a Divinity \"that shapes our ends.\" Every principle which has formed part of European civilization has predominated successively, and has failed to establish itself permanently whenever its supporters have tried to establish it alone. Exclusiveness is, therefore, the \"reat falsehood in all the opinions by' which social life has been at different periods regulated ; and this at once appears when we examine separately the elements to which attention was directed in the preceding sections. While this exclusiveness at once proves that the devices of unaided human wisdom are insufficient to secure the social progress of mankind, it directly shows us that what men have believed to be their own, was mysteriously directed to effect purposes which the inventors never designed. Let us take for examples, the Crusades, and the Celibacy of the Romish clergy. When Europe, in its first burst of enthusiasm, was thrown upon Asia, when bigotry and fanati cism raged from one end of Christendom to the other, directing its fury against Jews and heretics at home, and against Mussul mans abroad, it might have appeared to a calm observer, were it possible for such an one to be found at the period, that the ferocity of intolerance thus fanned into a flame must have gone on with increasing violence until every feeling of humanity was involved in the general conflagration. But the direct contrary proved to be the fact ; these wars actually commenced the formation of a mild and tolerant spirit in the breasts of Christians,"], [497, "CONCLUDING REMARKS. 483 and had a powerful effect in softening the horrors of war, by the introduction of humanity to captives and mildness to the vanquished. The literature of every age is a very fair criterion of the state of public feeling in that age. If, with this principle in view, we compare the writers contemporary with the first and last Crusade, we shall be struck by the amazing diversity between their sentiments, and rules of judgment. The former describe the Mohammedans as infidels, beasts, devils, enemies of God, whose extermination was a religious duty, and they record pretended miracles by which they suppose it to have been indicated, that the Crusaders were summoned by God, like the Israelites in the days of Moses, to exterminate the impious wretches who had seized on the Holy Land, the rightful heritage of their Lord. The historians of later times speak of these wars as purely political, and do full justice to the character of their adversaries, not unfrequently preferring the conduct of the Mohammedans, especially in their humanity to their captives, to that of the Christians ; indeed, William of Tyre gives as flattering a portraiture of the illustrious Saladin, as he would if he had been the most devoted of that hero's followers. This wondrous change, so unlike what would have been expected before-hand, is one for which mere philosophy is insufficient to account, and with humble reverence we recognise it as a proof that God works in a mysterious way His wonders to perform ; And it also illustrates another important tmth : Mere human wit is sure to err And scan His works in vain : God is his own interpreter And He will make it plain. In the same way, while the celibacy of the Romish clergy tended greatly to extend and secure the influence of the Romish clero-y, it contributed in a still more powerful degree to prevent the popes from acquiring political power and crushing national independence. Had the Romish priesthood in the age between Gregory VII. and Boniface VIIL been an hereditary caste, like the priests of ancient Egypt or modern India, humanly speaking, Y 2"], [498, "484 CONCLUDING REMARKS. it is probable that the popes would have succeeded in establish ing their spiritual tyranny over Europe. We cannot better conclude these remarks than with a few extracts from the works of the Rev. Dr. Miller, who was the first to direct attention to this philosophic view of Divine Pro vidence superintending human affairs : \u2014 \" The works of material creation, though ' they have neither speech nor language,' yet utter voices which proclaim to reflect ing minds the glory of their Maker. Can it be supposed that the beings to whom these voices are addressed, should themselves, in their moral and political order, present no manifestations of the attributes of God ? Must it be believed that the Almighty, when he had impressed on mere matter, the character of his perfections, abandoned his intelligent creatures to their own errors, contenting himself with some occasional interposition, when those errors had become extreme? As this is not agreeable to analogy, so neither is it conformable to the lessons of the sacred Scriptures. In them we are assured that an event the most unimportant, the fall of a sparrow, does not happen without the knowledge and permission of our heavenly Father ; and we have received this assurance, not as a merely speculative communication, concerning the Divine government, but that we may apply it to our own conduct, and rely with confidence on the Divine protection. This conclusion receives an additional confirmation from the absurdity of the opposite opinion : if a harmony of action, tending to the general improvement, has been demonstrated in the very numerous and various transactions of thirteen centuries of the history of the world, can it be imagined that this harmony should have been the result of the independent agencies of a vast multitude of weak, ignorant, and corrupt creatures, living in different ages, and in remote and nnconnected countries ? This supposition would require that weakness and ignorance should, without the possibility of a concerted plan, and without the superintendence of a controlling power, have steadily and consistently operated to the attainment of an end to which only the wisdom and power of a supreme ruler could be adequate ; and that not only the imperfect virtue, but even the positive viciousness of man, should have uniformly"], [499, "485 CONCLUDING REMARKS. laboured for the accomplishment of a purpose worthy of infinite goodness. \" This is the system which it has been proposed to establish for the moral as for the material world ; the system of a God and of his providence. It has been shown that, diversified and complicated as the transactions of thirteen centuries have been, they all admit of being reduced to one great system of action, the unity of which must prove the control of a presiding Deity, as the combination of the planetary system glorifies its Author. In one respect indeed, the view of the moral world discovers even a more glorious revelation of the attributes of God. The planet revolves for ever in its appointed orbit ; and the noblest triumph of mechanical philosophy is, to have ascertained that the perturbations of its course are all compensated within deter mined periods, and its movements exempted from decay. But man, weak and erring though he be, is still progressive in his moral nature. He does not move round for ever in one unvary ing path of moral action. The combinations of his history exhibit not only the unity of the material system, but also the continually advancing improvement belonging to a being of a higher order. \" The oreat poet\"'1\" of antiquity has painted, in a glowing colour ino-, the radiant splendour which, in a calm and moonlight night, bursts on the baffled gaze, and brings into a sudden day the woods and promontories. It is thus that the system here pro posed would pour a light from heaven upon the dark and As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night ! O'er Heaven's clear azure spreads her sacred light, When not a breath disturbs the pure serene, And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene ; Around her throne the vivid planets roll, And stars unnumbered gild the glowing pole ; O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed, And tip with silver every mountain's head ; Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise, A flood of glory bursts from all the skies : The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight, Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.

As the shepherd of the poet rejoiced at the glory which struck his corporeal view, so might we exult at the removal of that distant gloom, which must enfold all the concerns of the sublunar world, if no persuasion of a providential government illuminate the moral prospect. Cheered, however, by this persuasion, we may calmly hold our allotted station, confiding in the protection of an all-gracious Being, as we must be assured that by all the vicissitudes of our agitated world, the purposes of goodness must be eventually accomplished, for ' The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.'\""], [501, "487 CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF BRITISH ACQUISITIONS IN INDIA.
