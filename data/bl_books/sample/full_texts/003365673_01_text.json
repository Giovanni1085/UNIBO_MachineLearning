In the history of both, that of their country is involved; the events that mark the annals of both are the epochs of the national annals ; nor can the character of the one, or the topography of the other, be delineated, but in connexion with the most important national institutions and affairs. The Metropolis of Scotland is inferior to none of the cities of Europe in associations of this kind: \u2014 which, let the ample use of them by the magic pen of the Author of Waverley, testify. She has still her royal Holyrood ; her temples of religion, of benevolence, and of science, forming a sort of pano ramic history of all the civil and ecclesiastical changes through which the country has passed : \u2014 of her kingly races ; her martyrs and reformers; her princely merchants; and her noble triumphs as a school of literature and medicine."], [14, "IV PREFACE. No other of our national capitals has equal pretensions to natural beauty or picturesque site. London struggles into health and beauty, like a giant putting forth the maturity of his strength, as it overcomes the natural disadvantages of its comparatively low situation, and buries its marshy neighbour hood beneath the cellars of extending streets\u2014 every striking feature of its panorama being a triumph of art. Dublin pre sents altogether a sea or harbour view: its scenic beauties, though great, are those of the bay, not of the metropolis. But Edinburgh owes at least as much to nature as to art, and is one ofthe few large collections of the works of man in full ac cordance with the scenery around : one whose situation may be supposed to have been selected with a happy prescience of what art would add and ages accumulate ; and in whose striking features every monument of human greatness mingles with a magnificence yet more unquestionable and enduring. It will be our business, in the following work, to do justice to each of the claims of the Scottish Metropolis on the attention of the British traveller, merchant, or antiquary. Its architec ture is as various as the natural scenery that surrounds it. We have a really New and Old Town ; and, occupying the two ex tremities of the latter, the two most remarkable monuments of Scottish history, the Castle and Holyrood House: the noble intervening street is rarely equalled in grandeur. This is not the place to dwell on particular objects ; but who that has sym pathised with the ecclesiastical struggles of England or Scot land in the sixteenth century, can forget the High Kirk of Edinburgh and of Knox, or the prolonged contests between Popery and the Presbytery\u2014 the Presbytery and Episcopacy of"], [15, "PREFACE. V which it may be said to have been the centre and fountain ? In the same neighbourhood, as if to remind us of the more peaceful current of modern times, and the advantages of long-settled liberty, the Bank of Scotland rears its elegant front, a monu ment of commercial opulence. Even the relics of the ancient gates or Ports found in this part of the city assist us, according to Maitland, in ascertaining its origin, i. e. in the protection afforded by the Castle; and it is highly important, that the artist should be called to aid the historian, in perpetuating some of these remains, as they are fast falling into decay. The New Town, and the Modern Improvements, together with the noble works, which, in the form of bridges, connect the New and Old Town, and which yield as specimens of elegant and substantial architecture, to no other erections of the kind, will be found to receive our particular attention. And here public and private edifices of the most splendid description crowd on our notice : the convenience of a rectangular distri bution of the buildings, uniting with the elegance of the en curved street and the circus ; and the regular outline of the whole finely contrasted with the crowded and shapeless masses of the Old Town and the bold ruggedness of the natural scenery.

EDINBURGH, the metropolis of Scotland, and often the seat of political and civil war fares a city of singular aspect and character, both as respects its natural and its artificial features. Originating in a time of domestic feuds and political discord, the Lord of the Soil raised his castellum, or mansion, on a lofty, craggy hill that sprung abruptly out of a valley, and which was intended rather as a place of security against a foe, than as a home of pleasantry or comfort. His vassals speedily gathered around him under the walls and shelter of the Castle, and raised their dwellings, in which personal security was more consulted than domestic accommodation, or the conveniences of social life. Congregated in a compact mass, the town thus arose round the baronial castle, and as new settlers came in, they seem rather to have raised their original houses in height, than to have extended them in number over the unoccupied grounds. Edinburgh has no resem blance to a Roman station, nor does it owe its origin to monastic institutions. The situation and natural features of the place are at once peculiar and remarkable ; and the original town, as well as its modern additions and improvements, are almost equally singular. A wild, irregular, and irriguous surface, deep valleys, with lofty and craggy hills, are the component parts of the landscape, whilst high, solid, and spacious houses, in narrow streets, constitute the Old Town; and large squares, terraces, and wide streets, with houses and public buildings of enriched architecture, characterise the New Town. Edinburgh has thus three boldly marked and distinctive features; whilst numerous other peculiarities serve to make up its portrait. Language alone, however apposite and forcible, can never convey full and clear information respecting the infi nitely varied features of nature, or the diversified combinations of buildings. Aided by the faithful delineations of the artist, precise and clear ideas may be formed, and a satis factory knowledge be thus obtained of remote countries. By these united powers we hope to impart to foreigners, and to all strangers, as well as to the denizens of Scotland, authentic and accurate accounts and delineations of the scenic and architectural charac teristics of Edinburgh and of the adjacent country. C"], [22, "EDINBURGH. 4 The Etymology of Edinburgh is involved in considerable obscurity : yet it has been generally supposed that the fortress gave its name to the town, and not the latter to the former. The oldest name we can now trace to the rock on which the Castle is raised, is Maidun, which the Latin Chroniclers render literally, Castrum Puellarum, and in the charters of Malcolm the Fourth, (who died in 1165,) it is called indifferently Castrum-Puellarum, or Oppidum Puellarum. It is, however, generally sup posed, that the Saxon name of Edinburgh was conferred by Edwin, king of Northumbria, who began his reign in 617 ; and having overrun great part of the Pictish territories, founded the fortress, and gave his own name to this place, which was then the principal burgh in the kingdom, and from that time assumed the appellation of Edwine' s-burgh, and Edine 's-burgh. Others affirm, that the earliest mention of Edinburgh occurs in the Chronicon Pictorum about the year 955, when it was resigned by the English to the Scots under the name of Edin. It is, however, certain, that King David the First, in his charter to the Abbey of Holyrood, dated 1128, styles the town \"Burgo meo de Edwins burgh;\" and amongst other liberties granted to the Canons, empowered them to erect a borough between the Church of Holyrood and the town. Hence the foundation of that part of Edinburgh, now called the Canon-gate. Although a parliament was held in this town by Alexander n. in 1215, yet it was not until after 1456 when parliaments were held there regularly, and the Scottish kings, encouraged by the strength and security of its Castle, were gradually induced to remove their seat of residence from Scone, that it assumed the name and character of a capital.* The charter of Robert Bruce in 1329, Which recognises the ancient privileges of the inhabitants, and confers upon them the town of Leith, with its harbours, &c, is the oldest document now extant granted to this place, which was at that time an unwalled town, thinly inhabited, and comparatively of little importance. To this grant, Robert III., in 1335, added the singular privilege of erecting houses within the Castle, provided the citizens, availing themselves of this protection, should be persons of \"good fame.\" Henry the Sixth of England, with his family, having been compelled to seek refuge in Scotland, in 1461, was so kindly received by the inhabitants of Edinburgh, that he granted them liberty to trade to all the ports of England, under the same restrictions as the citizens of London. This charter was never confirmed, and was therefore productive of little benefit. The principal liberties, however, were granted to the citizens by James III. of Scotland, in 1482, in gratitude for the part they had taken in the contentions between him and his nobles : amongst various other privileges conferred by this monarch, the Pro- * The fatal stone, as it is called, on which the Scottish kings were seated at the time of their coronation, is said to have been brought from Ireland by King Fergus, who placed it in Argyle, whence it was remoTed to Scone, and there remained until the time of Edward the First, who, having subdued Scotland, caused the Inauguration Stone, toge ther with all the public jewels, &c, to be conveyed to Westminster. This curious relic of antiquity is still preserved in the Abbey church, and placed beneath the seat of a fine carved chair, which is used as the coronatisn throne of the Kings of England. See Brayley's \" History, &c, of Westminster Abbey Church.\" Vol. II. p. 182."], [23, "EDINBURGH. 5 vost was made hereditary high sheriff within the town, and the town-council was empow ered to make bye-laws for the government thereof. The incorporated trades were at the same time presented with a flag, or banner, since called the ' Blue Blanket,' and kept by the Convener of the trades, for the time being. During the contest for power^ in the minority of James the Fifth, the Earl of Arran and Cardinal Beaton, displeased at the influence gained by the Earl of Angus by his marriage with the Queen Dowager, assaulted him in 1515, near the Netherbow-Port in Edinburgh, when upwards of two hundred and fifty men were slain. This conflict was afterwards distinguished by the name of \" Clean the Causeway.\" In 1542, Edinburgh was plundered and many of its houses burnt by the English forces under the Earl of Harewood, but these were very soon rebuilt. About this time the progress of the Reformation occasioned numerous disturbances in the town ; several of the Scottish barons embraced the reformed doctrines, and, urged by the eloquence of John Knox, formed themselves into a sort of class, knoAvn by the name of the Congrega tio7i, and shortly made themselves masters of the principal toAvns in Scotland. They arrived at Edinburgh in 1559, when, by the advice of Knox, all the statues and ornaments of St. Giles's church were destroyed, and the edifice itself was appropriated to the minis trations of the reformers ; but Queen Mary having in the mean time seized the town, the church was newly consecrated, and the Catholic rites re-established. In August 1561, Mary, Queen of Scots, arrived at Leith from France, to take possession of the throne of Scotland, and on the first of September made her public entry into Edinburgh, where she was received with every demonstration of welcome and regard : but the inhabitants very shortly afterwards openly expressed their dislike to the religion of their sovereign; nor were they long restrained from interrupting the service of the mass, and wreaking their vengeance on the priest, who officiated. About this period, the town-council substituted on their banner the thistle, to the exclusion of the figure of St. Giles, which had long been their emblem ; and such was their inveterate hatred to popery, that they refused to admit any one to a municipal office who was not of the reformed religion. On the 9th of March, 1566, Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, was murdered at Holyrood House ; and on the 15th of May, in the following year, the Scottish Queen was married to Bothwell, which shortly after occasioned her imprisonment in the castle of Lockleven. After Mary's retreat into England, Edinburgh suffered much from the divided interests of the different factions, who, for nearly two years, carried on a kind of predatory war ; but Earl Morton, who Avas Regent during the minority of Prince James, having obtained the assistance of the English Queen, besieged the castle, which he compelled to surrender, and having hung the leaders of the opposing faction at the cross of Edinburgh, expelled the remains of Mary's party in Scotland. James having arrived at years of maturity, endeavoured to compose the family feuds among the nobles, whom he invited to an entertainment at the palace of Holyrood, and there obtained their promise to bury their dissensions in oblivion."], [24, "6 EDINBURGH. In 1592, the Presbyterian church-government was established by a solemn act of the legislature; but though James had been induced to grant this boon to his sub jects, yet mutual distrust prevailed between him and the clergy, which, in the sequel, led to consequences nearly fatal to the supremacy of the Scottish capital. On the Sunday previous to his departure to take possession of the English throne, in 1603, he repaired to the church of St. Giles, in Edinburgh, and there took a formal leave of his northern subjects. In 1609, he granted to the provost of the toAvn the privilege of having a sword of state carried before him, and to the magistrates the liberty of wearing gowns on public occasions. In 1627, King Charles the First presented the town with a new sword and gown, to be worn at the times appointed by his father, James VI. : and ten years afterwards, Edinburgh was appointed the seat of a diocese, in which the Three Lothians, and part of Berwickshire, were included. The church of St. Giles was at the same time constituted a Cathedral : but such was the hatred of the people to this form of religion, that great disturbances were created; nor was any attempt again made to establish episcopacy until 1661, in the reign of Charles the Second, the consequences of which was a ruinous civil war, and all the evils attendant on intes tine commotion. From this time, the only events of importance, which we have space to enumerate, are \u2014 the union of the two kingdoms in 1707, which has been attended with so many benefits to Scotland; the rebellion in 17*45; and the visit of our present gracious sovereign to that place in 1822. Municipal Establishments. \u2014 Edinburgh is governed by a town-council of thirty three members, composed of merchants and tradesmen, who have the direction of all public affairs within the jurisdiction of the city. Of these, the chief magistrate is the Lord Provost, whose office is equivalent to that of the lord mayor of London. He is hereditary high sheriff, coroner, and admiral, within the town and liberties, as well as the harbour and road-stead, of Leith. He is also president of the convention of royal burghs. His allowance from the city for supporting the dignity of his office is eight hundred pounds per annum. There are four other magistrates, called Baillies, as also an officer with the title of Dean-of-guild, whose duty it is to superintend the erection of public and all other buildings. These, together with a treasurer, chamberlain, three merchant and two trades' counsellors, and the fourteen deacons of the incorporated trades, and seven members of the foregoing year, complete the magistracy by which the city is governed. The lord provost is the lord-lieutenant of the city, and the four baillies are justices of peace, ex officio, within the liberties. The magistrates of Edin burgh, also, as superiors of the suburbs of the Canongate, the Eastern and Western Ports burgh, and the toAvn of Leith, have the appointment of baron-baillies for these districts. In their official capacity, the provost and baillies are robed in scarlet, with gold chains, and the rest of the members of the council in black gowns. The principal part of the town-council is chosen from the Merchants' Company, who were incorporated by a charter from King Charles the Second, in the year 1681, before"], [25, "EDINBURGH. 7 which period the magistrates were elected solely from the Guildry, or Corporation of Merchants, to the exclusion of persons belonging to the incorporated trades : this was however, in a great measure remedied by an act of parliament, in the reign of James HI., whereby each of the trades was empowered to choose one of its number to vote in the election of officers for the government of the city. The fourteen incorporated trades are, 1. The Surgeons, who have a hall for their meetings in Surgeons-Square, together with a theatre for dissections, and a small museum ; 2. The Goldsmiths, whose hall is situated in South Bridge Street ; 3. Skinners, the hall of whose corpora tion is in Skinners Close ; 4. Furriers; 5. Hammermen; 6 and 7. Wrights and Masons, whose hall of meeting is called St. Marys chapel, and is situated in Burnets Close; 8. Tailors; 9. Bakers; 10. Fleshers ; 11. Cordiners, or Cordivainers ; 12. Weavers; 13. Waukers ; and 14. Bonnet-makers. The Candle-makers is also an incorporated trade, but has not the privilege of sending a member to the Common, or Town Council: to this body are attached four advocates under the name of Assessors, who render advice and assistance in deliberations on difficult, or contested cases. The Town Courts are four in number, viz. the Criminal Court, in which are tried all criminal causes occurring within the city and liberties; the Bailie Court, for the trial of all causes for debt and civil trespass within the city; the Ten Merk Court, for the recovery of debts not exceeding ten merks, Scots, or Ils. If d. sterling, except servants' wages, which may be recovered to any amount ; and the Dean of Guild Court, having cognizance of all the buildings erected within the jurisdiction of the city, none of which can be built without a license from the Dean, who has also the regulation of weights and measures, and sees that no tradesmen exercise their profession unless they be freemen. The Prisons of Edinburgh are three, viz. the Neiv Jail, the Canongate Tolbooth, and the Bridewell. In enumerating the various political and civil establishments, we must not forget to mention the house in which the Scottish parliaments were formerly held, and which is now appropriated to the accommodation of the courts of Session, Justiciary, and Exchequer, as also to the Jury and Consistorial Courts. The places of justice not already mentioned, are the Court of Admiralty, the Commissary Court, Lyon Court, the Sheriff' Court, Court of the Justice of Peace, the Neiv County Hall, and Convention of Royal Burghs. These, together with the College and Register Office, to which may be added the Exchange, Boards of Custom and of Excise, and the Post Office, are the prin cipal public edifices. Description. \u2014 The buildings of Edinburgh are dispersed over a very irregular surface of ground, and placed partly in valleys, and partly on the tops and sloping sides of hills. In the middle of the Old Town they are mostly arranged on the sides of narrow streets, are very high, and constructed without the least regard to symmetry, beauty, or domestic comforts. The NeAV Town is as unlike its ancestor, as if belonging to another country, climate, or class of inhabitants ; for whilst the former has no preten sions to beauty, or eATen architectural design, \u2014 the latter is systematic, laid out with some D"], [26, "EDINBURGH. 8 regard to general effect, and according to an uniform and well-digested plan. It also exhibits several specimens of good architecture in its public buildings and private houses, that emulate the classical models of Italy. This may be inferred from the names of Sir William Chambers, and of the Adams's, who gave the designs for some of these edifices. Wide streets, laid out at right angles with each other, and terminated occasionally by spacious and handsome squares, give an air of beauty, and even of grandeur, to parts of this newly-formed district. In these features it may be said to resemble the famed city of Washington, in America. Built on an eminence, about 200 feet above the level of the sea, and considerably above the Old Town, it not only commands varied and extensive prospects, but is seen towering above the Ioav grounds in the vicinity. At its western side the surface shelves abruptly to a small river called the Water of Leith; whilst near the eastern extremity, is a lofty, craggy, insulated eminence, called the Calton Hill. \u2014 More detailed accounts of this district will be given hereafter, in noticing the prints which represent its buildings and natural features. The present extent of Edinburgh may be said to comprise an area measuring about two miles and a quarter from east to west, by one mile and three-quarters from north to south, whilst its circuit is estimated at eight miles. A large portion of this space is occupied by gardens, fields, the Calton Hill, Kings Meadow, Salisbury Craigs, with Arthurs Seat, the meadows of Hope Park, the gardens and pleasure grounds of Holyrood House, &c. The relative heights of different parts of the town, above the level of the sea, &c. are as follows : \u2014 Arthurs Seat, 822 feet ; the Cat Nick, on Salisbury Craigs, 550 feet; the Castle Rock, 443 feet; the Calton Hill, 343 feet; St. Leonard's Hill, 285 feet ; and Princes Street, 212 feet. Edinburgh contains thirteen parishes, and, according to the census of 1821, a popu lation of 138,235, which shews an increase since 1811, of 35,248 persons. This includes the town of Leith. Its general site may be described as three eminences, the central part being a high narrow ridge upon' which the Old Toivn is built, and at the western extremity of which, on a lofty, isolated rock, elevated on three sides from a level plain, stands the Castle. The scenery by which Edinburgh is surrounded, is of the most romantic and diversified character. It is bounded on the east by a lofty rocky hill called Arthurs Seat, Salisbury Craigs, and the Calton Hill ; on the south by the hills of Braid, Pentland, and Corstorphine, which may be said to form a beautiful screen of eminences rising about three miles from the town; on the north side, hoAvever, the ground gently declines to the Frith of Forth. The hill on which the Old Town is placed, is separated from the other districts by two valleys, one formerly a marsh, called the North Loch, but now drained, and connected with the New Town by the North Bridge, the length of which is 1125 feet ; and also by an immense earthen mound, composed almost entirely of materials excavated from the foundation of the houses in the New Town, since the year 1783. The buildings to the south are connected, independently of other communi cations, by another bridge of twenty-two arches, which is now the principal line of con-"], [27, "EDINBURGH. 9 nection between the two districts. The principal thoroughfare in the Old Town is the High-street, at the east end of Avhich, and in that part called the Palace-yard, stands Holy rood House, formerly the principal abode of the Scottish kings, and now the residence and property of the Duke of Hamilton. An Abbey was founded on this site by David the Ist, in 1128, which, in the 16th century, became a royal palace. The precincts of this demesne, embracing a circuit of three miles, including the Kings Park, Arthurs Seat, and Salisbury Craigs, afford a sanctuary for debtors. At the western extremity of the High street is the Castle, forming a most striking contrast to the Abbey in point of situation ; for no two edifices in the same town can be more dissimilar in position and general features \u2014 the one being on a high, precipitous, insulated rock \u2014 the other seated in a vale, sur rounded by hills. The High-street of Edinburgh has been compared to the backbone of a herring, the Castle forming its head, Holyrood House its tail, and the numerous narrow lanes, or wynds, as here called, diverging from either side, the ribs. Its entire length, from the Castle Gate to the Palace Gate, is 5570 feet ; and, unless we except the High-street, in Oxford, is perhaps not equalled in picturesque character by any street in Europe. A narrow lane, at a short distance, eastward, winds round the Castle to the South, and is terminated by an oblong square, called the Grass-Market, formerly the place for public executions; and as criminals, in London, were heretofore conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, so the same sad procession was made in Edinburgh from the Tolbooth to this place. It may now be compared to the noted markets of Smithfield and the Haymarket, in London. To the west of the Grass-Market extends a narrow street called Portsburgh, or West Port, from one of the gates of the town having formerly been placed at this extremity. A crooked lane, called the West-Bow, leads from the north-east corner of the Grass- Market to that portion of the High-street denominated the Lawn Market, from being the place appropriated to the sale of that kind of article. The Northern district of Edinburgh, generally called the New Town, was first projected in 1752, but as the magistrates were at that time unable to procure an extension of the royalty, the design was postponed until the year 1767, when an act of parliament Avas obtained, by which they were empowered to effect this important object. It was at first proposed to make a canal through the North Loch, and to lay out the northern bank in terraces : this process was partially adopted ; and was carrying into effect when Provost Drummond devised a scheme for draining the Loch, and occupying the hollow by throwing across the North-Bridge, and thereby forming a communication with a large level space of ground, the property of Heriot's Hospital. This plan was acted upon, and the New Town was, contrary to every prediction on the subject, built and occu pied, to a considerable extent, within forty years from its commencement. The district may be considered as consisting of two parts, the one begun in 1767 and now completed ; and the other, the additional buildings erected to the north, east, and west of the former. The principal avenue in the New Town is George-street, which extends through the centre, and is terminated at the east end by St. Andrew's Square, in"], [28, "EDINBURGH. 10 the centre of which, stands a handsome column, erected to the memory of the late Lord Melville. At the west end of the same street is another quadrangular area, called Char lotte Square, surrounded by large and respectable mansions. In a recess on the eastern side of St. Andrew's Square, is the Royal Bank, formerly the Excise Office, a handsome building, designed by Sir William Chambers ; close to which is situated the British Linen Bank. On the west side of Charlotte Square, is St. George's Church, forming the terminating object of George-street. Parallel to this street, are Queen-street, Princes street, and York Place ; at the eastern end of the former is St. Paul's Chapel, built by a subscription of the members of the Scottish Episcopal Church, from a design by Archi bald Elliot, Esq. At the western termination of Princes-street is St. John's Chapel, a light building, also erected by subscription : and at the eastern end of the same street stands the Theatre, immediately opposite to which is the Register Office, erected from a design by Mr. Robert Adam, the foundation-stone of which was laid on the 7th of June, 1774. There are also two other longitudinal streets, named Thistle- street, and Rose-street, the former running between Queen-street and George-street, and the latter between Princes- street and George- street. From Princes -street the new approach to the city commences by Regent-Bridge, the foundation-stone of which, together with that of the new Jail, were laid on the 19th of September, 1815, by Sir John Marjoribanks; the work was begun in August 1816, and finished in March 1819. On the south side of the Bridge, to the west of the arch, is the Stamp Office; and immediately to the east, on the same side, is the New Post Office. At the extremity of the north side, the Incorporations of Calton have erected a hand some Hall for their public meetings. In the Calton burial ground, is a large cir cular monument raised to the memory of David Hume, the eminent historian. Imme diately to the east of the felons' Jail is the Bridewell : and still more eastward is the Jail for debtors : nearly facing which, on a lofty eminence, stands the Monument erected to the memory of Lord Nelson; and further north is the NeAv Observatory, founded by Sir George Mackenzie on the 25th of April, 1818. The similarity of the Calton Hill to the romantic eminence of the Acropolis of Athens, has caused it to be chosen for the site of a National Monument, the foundation-stone of which was laid during his Majesty's visit to Edinburgh on the 27th of August, 1822 ; the Parthenon of Athens having been adopted as a model. Churches. \u2014 The. religious edifices of Edinburgh, though numerous, do not present to the architectural critic much to admire or praise. The oldest are neither remarkable for antiquity, nor for the rich and interesting styles which distinguish the Abbey of Melross, or the Chapel at Roslyn. The Chapel to Holyrood Palace, exhibits some curious features in the enriched pointed style ; and the Church of St. Giles, though very large, has little pretensions to architectural interest or beauty. As most of these edifices will be repre sented and described in subsequent parts of this work, we forbear to make further remarks here, excepting merely to enumerate them."], [29, "KEW TKON STEEPLE, HIGH STREET, EDINBURGH LORD MELVILLE'S ilOSn\u0152XT.

In addition to these, there are, in the New Town, the churches of St. George and St. Andrew ; with six chapels-of-ease, and numerous places of worship for dis senters, amounting in the whole, within the city of Edinburgh and town of Leith, to sixty-eight. Charitable Institctions. \u2014 These are exceedingly numerous, but the most important are the Royal Infirmary \u2014 the Public Dispensary \u2014 the Lying-in Hospital \u2014 the Lunatic Asylum \u2014 Heriot's Hospital, Watson's Hospital, Gillespie's Hospital, the Charity Work house, Merchant Maiden Hospital, Trades Maiden Hospital, Orphan Hospital, Trinity Hospital, the Asylum for the Blind, the Institution for the Education of Deaf and Dumb Children, and the Magdalen Asylum. Literary Establishments. \u2014 Although the inhabitants of Edinburgh have long been famed for their scientific and classical acquirements, yet it had not a regular University until the year 1582, when a Charter was granted by James VI., and the College was opened for the reception of students in the following year : teachers of philosophy and divinity had, however, been established here long before that time. For a considerable period, little else was taught in this University besides the dead languages, the divinity and philosophy of the schools, and some branches of mathematics, then in general use ; it was not until the year 1721 that the school of medicine, which has since risen to such eminence, was first founded. The different branches of education now taught in this University are, Literature and Philosophy, Theology, Law, and Medicine. The number of students who attended the different classes in 1828, was upwards of 2300. The University Museum, consisting of a series of medals, pictures, and busts, the remarkable arms, clothing, and ornaments of foreign countries, together with a collection of mathematical, philosophical, and surgical instruments, OAves its foundation to Sir Andrew Balfour, to whom Edinburgh is also indebted for the establishment of a Botanical Garden. The Library of the University is valuable and extensive : it is entitled to demand a copy of every book entered at Stationers' Hall : the number of volumes at present in the Library amounts to upwards of 50,000. Besides the University, there are many academies, and lecture-rooms for classical and medical instruction, and for the acquirement of general knowledge, not already mentioned. Among the public institutions and buildings, the most eminent are the Royal High School, founded in 1578, at which nearly eight hundred scholars annually attend ; the Royal Society, the Wernerian Natural History Society, the Society of Antiquaries, the Speculative Society, the Royal Medical and Physical Societies, the Caledonian Horticultural Society, the Scottish Academy, the Royal Institution, the Advocate's Library, and the Library of the Writers to the Signet, the Highland Society of Scotland, the Observatory, and Astronomical Society, and many other Public Establishments. As the Illustrations in this work will include Views of most of the Buildings belonging to these Societies, we shall have occasion to record some particu- E"], [34, "EDINBURGH. 12 lars of the History of each, as well as describe the Edifices themselves, in subsequent pages. There are three subjects belonging to the general History of Edinburgh, which it will be proper to notice in this place, because they appertain to the whole City, and are not confined to one building, or to any one place. These are, the Printing Business, and Publications \u2014 the fine Arts \u2014 and the progress and present state of Music. The first of these may date its origin in 1507, about thirty-six years after Printing had been practised at Westminster, and when W. Chapman, a merchant, and A. Miller, were authorized to set up a press, by a grant under the privy-seal. In 1537, another printer commenced business, and specimens from the presses of both are preserved in the Advocate's library. It was about eighty years, before the number of printers had increased to six. On the estab lishment of the University in 1582, a new era arose in the literature of the city. This Insti tution had its own printer and types, and consequently executed the \" theses,\" and other works, destined for its particular classes. Early in the 17th century, the printers were also the booksellers, and, of course, were neither very skilful nor scientific. English printers were invited to Edinburgh about that time : but the demand for books had so much increased toAvards the end of the century, that many were sent to Holland, and the Low Countries, to be executed for the Scottish capital. After the union of the kingdoms, in 1707, and under the names of Freebairn, Watson, and Basket, the royal printers of Scot land, a great advance was made in the art. The celebrated Ruddiman established a press here in 1715, and by uniting learning, skill, and industry, gave popularity and increased value to the publications which he turned out. (See Chalmer's \" Life of Thomas Ruddiman,\" a very interesting volume.*) In conjunction with James Davidson, he was appointed printer to the University, in 1728. From that time to the end of the last century, we do not meet with any distinguished names or events belonging to this subject. A new and brilliant era now arose, when the skill and practical knowledge of a Ballantine, united with the superlative talents and rapid writing of a Scott, produced a succession of new works, which at once astonished and delighted the reading world. Although the greater part of the books from Mr. Ballantine' s press may be regarded in the second or even third class of the typogaphical art, he has turned out some to rival those of a Whittingham ; and all are distinguished by a carefulness of reading and execution, which seems almost incompatible with the rapidity of workmanship. The establishment of \"The Edinburgh Review,\" in October, 1802, though common in printing and paper, was uncommon in its writings. Powerful, commanding, and original, it soon attracted unprecedented popularity, and directed the notice and inquiries of the literary world, to the nest where it was hatched, fledged, and brought to maturity. The great numbers that have been printed of this quarterly publication, and the still greater quantities Avorked of Sir Walter Scott's * In 1508, there was only one printing establishment in Edinburgh : in 1763 there were six : in 1790 they had increased to twenty-one : in 1824 they had further risen to forty-four : and in 1829, to about fifty."], [35, "EDINBURGH. 13 \" Novels,\" &c. has given employment to numerous persons in the various departments of the printing trade; and has also occasioned a corresponding increase in the manufactory of paper, ink, presses, and other objects connected with the business. Hence, Ave see the amazing and incalculable influence of well-exerted talents. Whilst the government is deriving large revenues from the paper, advertisement, and other duties, exacted from the books of a popular author, the merchant and tradesman are augmenting their business and incomes : and if tens of thousands of readers are not permanently improved and benefited by the writings, they must possess either shallow heads, or callous hearts, or both united. Another periodical work demands notice in this place, for the popula rity it has attained by the powerful wit, satire, and irony, which pervade its pages. This is Blackwood's \"Edinburgh Magazine,\" which was commenced in 1817, and has continued to appear monthly ever since. The following list of Periodical Publications now printed in Edinburgh, will sheAv the present state of the press, in its annual, quarterly, monthly, and more frequent productions. Annuals \u2014 Edinburgh Annual Register, Edinburgh Almanack, Edinburgh Directory. Quarterly \u2014 The Edinburgh Review, Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, begun in 1805, The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, begun 1818, The Edinburgh Journal of Science. Monthly \u2014 The Scots' Magazine, begun in 1739, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, The Edinburgh Christian Instructor, The Christian Herald, The Scottish Missionary Register, The Farmer's Magazine, begun in 1800. Newspapers \u2014 published either thrice, twice, or once a week : The Edinburgh Evening Courant, The Caledonian Mercury, The Edinburgh Observer, The Edinburgh Gazette, Edinburgh Advertiser, Edinburgh Star, The Scotsman, Weekly Journal, Weekly Chronicle, The Independent, Edinburgh Times, The Edinburgh Evening Post, The Edinburgh and Leith Advertiser, and The Edinburgh Literary Gazette. The Fine Arts of Edinburgh, strictly speaking, are still in their infancy. Men of talent have lived and flourished in the city, but the attractive influence of London has taken away nearly the whole number. Fashion and Wealth are the parents of luxury, and the higher species of art can only find support where that prevails. It is not wonder ful, therefore, that the Metropolis is the focus where all the rays of genius converge \u2014 where they congregate, shine, and dazzle the eye of the spectator. The Artists of Edin burgh have made three or four attempts to found an Academy for the promotion of Art ; but have experienced many obstacles and difficulties in carrying their plans into effect. The Royal Institution, similar in plan and principle to that of London, was formed in 1808, and made four exhibitions, in York Place, when it was broken up. In 1824, some gentlemen, attached to the Arts, again assembled, revived the Society, and invited the professional Artists to join them. This compact continued only one year, when the Artists seceded, and soon established a new association, under the title of \" The Scottish Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture.\" Adopting the plan and objects of"], [36, "EDINBURGH. 14 the Royal Academy of London, they arranged their laivs, drew up a charter, and peti tioned the Secretary of State for Royal sanction. Mr. Peel, by the advice of the Lord Advocate of Scotland, rejected the petition. In a subsequent page we shall have occa sion to advert to this subject again. The Academy opened its first exhibition in February, 1827, with 264 pictures, and 18 works of sculpture; its second exhibition, in 1828, con tained 309 pictures and 16 pieces of sculpture. In 1829, a third exhibition is before the public. Thus it may be said, that Edinburgh has now a School of Art, and we cannot doubt that emulation and application will bring to light and patronage many sons of genius. A feAV names may be here recorded, of painters, either natives or denizens of Edinburgh, whose works are an honour to themselves and to their country. The first of any note was George Jamesone, called the Scottish Vandyke; \"to which honourable title,\" says Bryan, \" he had a double pretension, not only for having surpassed all his country men as a portrait painter, but from his pictures being sometimes attributed to that master.\"* From having studied under Rubens, who was also the master of Vandyke, it is reasonable to believe there were points of resemblance between these rivals and con temporaries. He painted portraits in oil, and in miniature, and also produced some historical and landscape pictures. King Charles I. sat to him for his portrait. Some of his paintings are preserved in the Colleges of Aberdeen, his native place. One of his pupils, Alexander, married his sister, and succeeded him in perpetuating likenesses of some of the principal personages of the city. One of his best works is a full-length portrait of Sir George Mackenzie, King's Advocate. Scougal, in the reigns of Charles I. and James II. painted many of the contemporary eminent personages of Edinburgh. His pictures bear great resemblance to those of Sir Peter Lely, in style of colouring and in draperies. The long gallery of Holyrood-house is adorned with a series of portraits of all the Scottish Kings, from the supposed founders of the Monarchy downwards, by De-Witt, a Flemish painter. Many of these are, of course, fancy heads, but they are executed in a bold and free style. The pictures of Nicholas Mude, a Frenchman, who settled here about 1690, are remarkably like many by Rubens. Some are to be seen in the house of Drumlanrig. Patronized by the Duke of Queensberry, John Baptiste Medina settled in Edinburgh, where he received the honour of knighthood from that nobleman, and was employed in painting many portraits, some of which are preserved in the Surgeons' Hall. The names of William Aikman, Richard Wait, George Marshall, and John Alexander, were justly noted at the commencement of the eighteenth century, at Edinburgh ; and many of their pictures are found in the city, and at the mansions in its neighbourhood. Allan Ramsey, son of the Scottish poet, followed these in time, but seems to have surpassed them in fame. Visiting Italy, France, and London, he acquired much knowledge of his art, and left many works of merit behind him. Among them are portraits of King George IH. and his Queen. James Norris, and John his son, were both artists of note about this time, and many of their landscapes are to be seen in some of the old * Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, 2. vols. quarto."], [37, "EDINBURGH. 15 houses of the city. The foundation of a Gallery, or Academy, at Glasgow, by Robert and Andrew Foulis, was a memorable epoch in the history of the arts, as respected their career in Scotland. Though these two worthy and meritorious printers failed in their laudable inten tions, they gave birth to inquiry, and roused a latent spirit, which may be traced onwards to the present time. David Allan, the two Runcimans, Jacob Moore, and Gavin Hamilton, were artists, who either immediately sprung out of the Glasgow school, or were materially indebted to it. Alexander Runciman was the first master of an academy in Edinburgh, expressly formed for the study of drawing. David Allan succeeded him, and John Graham was his successor. The latter had to contest the appointment with nine other candidates, and each was required to send five different specimens of his works, for the scrutiny and decision of Mr. West, and other Members of the Royal Academy, in London. Such a race was arduous, but the conquest was the more glorious. On Graham's appointment, the trustees of the Scotch Academy provided him with a collection of casts from many celebrated antique statues. From this School have emanated many of the sons of talent, who are now living to adorn our own age, and whose meritorious works will descend to future times with accu mulating honours. Among these, it gives us much pleasure to notice the names of David Wilkie, R. A. Patrick Gibson, William Allan, David Thomson, Alexander Fraser, William Sheriff, John Burnett, and William Lizars. William Scoular, sculptor, though not so much known as most of the artists just named, has evinced considerable talent in busts and groups. The names of Raeburn, Nasmyth, Wilson, Williams,* and Nicholson, justly rank among the pictoral worthies of the city. By works that have excited the admiration of their contemporaries, they have secured to themselves, and to the places of their nativity, that perpetuity of fame which is the best incentive and reAvard to men of emulous minds. \" Genius, like Egypt's monarchs, timely wise, Constructs its own memorial ere it dies ; Leaves its best image in its works enshrined, And makes a Mausoleum of mankind.\" Shee's \"Rhymes on Art. Progress and present State of Music. However inferior and subordinate in every respect may be the art of Music to that of either of her sister arts \u2014 Painting, Architecture, and Sculpture \u2014 she is a lady of high fashion, dignity, and self- con sequence. She arrogates much distinction in the temple of Fame, and refers to the poets of ancient Greece, for testimonies of her miraculous powers in the old world. She also appeals to history, and points out the names of Mozart, Handel, Weiber, and others, as some of her favourite and influential sons of modern times. Nursed and reared in places of refinement and luxury, she can be appreciated only by persons, and in states, which are advanced in refinement and wealth. We do not learn that musical entertainments were encouraged in Edinburgh before the middle of the seventeenth century, and then only of moderate description. * The very interesting Series of finely executed Engravings of \" Views of Greece,\" from drawings by Mr.Williams. is an honour to the Artists engaged, and to the City where they are executed. F"], [38, "EDINBURGH. 16 According to a paper in the first volume of the \" Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,\" a \" grand Concert of Music\" was proposed to be performed on St. Cecilia's day, 1695, when the orchestra mustered thirty performers. Only eleven of them were professional persons, and the other nineteen were amateurs of fashion. In 1728, a Musical Society was instituted in Edinburgh for weekly concerts ; and this not only gave encouragement to the science, but created amateurs and professors. At first this Society assembled in St.Mary's Chapel, but, increasing in number and property, \" The Gentleman's Concert,\" as then called, built a Hall in 1762, in imitation of the Opera Theatre at Paris. Mr. Robert Mylne, the architect of Blackfriars' Bridge, London, was engaged to design the building. The great music-room was of an oval form, lighted from the centre of a concave elliptical dome ; and the seats were arranged amphitheatrically, to accommodate an auditory of about five hundred persons. For some years this was strictly a private society, and visitors were admitted by complimentary tickets ; but at length declining, the Hall was sold to a congregation of Baptists. In 1812, it Avas again destined to change its name and application ; and was then used as a Hall for the Masonic Meetings of the Grand Lodge. It now bears the name of the Freemasons' Hall. Subscription concerts succeeded the dissolution of \" The Gentlemen's Concerts,\" which were held at the Assembly-rooms in George-street, and at Corri's rooms. In the year 1814, a number of respectable gentlemen of the city and county, proposed a Musical Festival at Edinburgh, and obtained a liberal subscription for the purpose. It commenced on the 31st of October, 1815, and the performances were continued for the week. The novelty and notoriety thus excited, caused an unprecedented influx of visitors into the city. The great hall of the Parliament House was fitted up for the morning concerts, whilst those of the evening were held at Corri's room. The receipts not only paid for all expenses, but enabled the managers to distribute \u00a31500 among the charities of the city. In 1819, another musical festival of a similar kind, and of nearly the like success, was held here ; and a third in October, 1824, which was not so successful as either of the former. It is stated that only \u00a3700 were collected. Among the places of public amusement in Edinburgh, may be enumerated the Patent Theatre; the Caledonian Theatre, erected for equestrian entertainments, but now fitted up for the performance of such melo-dramas, harlequinades, &c. as may be played without a regu lar patent; the Assembly Rooms, established in 1710, but reconstructed in George-street, New Town, in 1787 ; the Riding School, or Royal Academy for Equestrian Exercises ; and the Royal Company of Archers, who have a hall at the east end of the Meadow Walk. This Society is said to have been instituted in the reign of James I. by commissioners appointed to enforce the practice of archery. Having selected a number of the best bowmen, they were appointed a body guard for the defence of the royal person. The present company claim to exercise this privilege within six miles of the capital, and did exercise it on the visit of his present Majesty to Edinburgh in 1824. They presented to the King a pair of barbed arroAvs, the reddendo, or service, paid to the crown for the grant of their privileges. Among"], [39, "EDINBURGH. 17 the various prizes annually shot for by the Royal Company of Archers, are, a sum given by his Majesty, and expended by the winner in the purchase of a piece of plate ; silver arrows given by the city of Edinburgh, by the towns of Musselburgh, Peebles, Selkirk, and Stirling ; and a prize established by the late Earl of Hopetoun, in commemoration of the royal visit. Another amusement almost peculiar to Scotland is the Golf, a game of remote anti quity, and usually played on the links, or downs, of Edinburgh and Leith. It consists in driving a small hard ball with a bat or club loaded with lead, into holes at about a quarter of a mile distant from each other ; and the player who conveys the ball into these holes in succession, with the fewest strokes, is the winner. In 1744, the town-council gave a silver bat to be played for annually by the Company of Golfers, which had been then recently established ; but three other companies, or clubs, have since been formed. Ecclesiastical History. \u2014 Before the commencement of the sixteenth century, the Roman Catholic religion, which had been previously universal throughout the greater part of civilized Europe, Avas generally exercised by the people of Edinburgh ; a religion which was promoted and increased at this place by the authority and example of the Augustine Canons of Holyrood, the Dominican Friars of St. Cuthbert's, and the inmates of other religious houses within the precincts of the town. But the power of the first monastery, which had for centuries directed and controlled the religious opinions of the surrounding population, was at length compelled to yield to the daring measures of state policy, and to the overAvhelming tide of popular opinion. The cause of the Reformation, which had been for some time advancing in England, gradually approached Scotland ; several of the barons, urged on by the fanatical eloquence of John Knox, who now began to make public harangues against Popery, embraced the reformed doctrines ; and for the defence of their neAvly acquired tenets, formed themselves into an association termed the Covenant. Under the sanction of the neAV religion, they committed the grossest excesses ; the Catholics were robbed and insulted, their places of worship deserted and destroyed, their priests and monks expelled from their homes, and dispersed, and the effigy of St. Giles, the tutelar saint of the town, was burnt as an heretical object of abomination. Nor were these disturbances diminished by the accession of Queen Mary, in 1561 ; the populace paid so little respect to the religion of their sovereign, that she was publicly insulted, and the ornaments of her chapel at Holyrood destroyed by the indignant multitude. In 1564, an assembly of the church, convened at Edinburgh, petitioned the Queen for the abolishment of Popery and the papal jurisdiction \u2014 that she would herself adopt the Protestant faith \u2014 that provision should be made for the support of the ministry \u2014 and that no bishopric, abbacy, or other benefice, having more than one church annexed thereto, should be holden by any one person. To this the Queen answered, \" that she knew not of any impiety in the mass; and refused to change her religion, or to relinquish the ecclesiastical patronage attached to the crown.\" In July of the same year she married Darnley, Avho, to ingratiate himself with the populace, Avent to St. Giles's church to hear a sermon ; but Knox, doubting his sincerity, reproved"], [40, "EDINBURGH. 18 him in the face of the congregation ; for which, having been cited before the Queen and her council, he said, \" that as the King for her pleasure had gone to mass, and dishonoured the Lord God; so should he, in his justice, make her the instrument of his ruin.\" For this offence he was prohibited to preach. In December following, an assembly of the church expostulated with the Queen in reference to the above-mentioned determination, but Avith little success ; for they gained only a small supply for the provision of ministers. An augmentation of this stipend was granted to the Scottish clergy in the ensuing year, and accepted by them, under a protest that it should not preclude their right to tithes. At an assembly convened at Edinburgh in July, 1566, when many of the Scottish noblemen were present, it was agreed, among other things, that the subscribing barons \" should convene themselves in arms for the rooting out of idolatry, especially the blasphemous mass, without exception of place or persons.\" The reformers having thus gained the ascendancy, held numerous assemblies, wherein ordinances were made for the regulation of their church ; and much as they differed from the Catholics on other points, they readily concurred Avith them in asserting its independence of civil jurisdiction. To this intent, petitions were presented in February, 1569, to the Regent and Council, who, although jealous of the encroachments of the clergy, found it politic to accede to their request ; commissioners were therefore appointed to treat Avith the assembly of the church, when, after much discussion, it was agreed, amongst other things, that the archbishoprics and bishoprics then void should be given to the best qualified of the ministry \u2014 that spiritual jurisdiction should be exercised by the bishops in their respective dioceses \u2014 and that all benefices of cure under prelacies should be dispensed to actual ministers, ordained by the bishops of the diocese : but although so much was conceded by the commissioners, it was not until some time afterwards that the establishment and regulation of the Presbyterian church was finally settled ; and an ecclesiastical court, termed a Presbytery, for the discussion of appeals from sessions, the punishment of Popery and Quakerism, and the examination of those entering holy orders, was established. Charles I. desirous of fixing Episcopacy in Scotland, constituted Edinburgh the seat of a diocese about the year 1633, and included the shires of Edinburgh, Linlithgow, and Berwick, the constabulary of Haddington, and the balliary of Lauderdale. William Forbes, D.D. one of the preachers in Edinburgh, and previously principal of the Marischal College, Aberdeen, was appointed bishop ; and dying in the following year, was succeeded by David Lindsay, bishop of Brichen : but such was the hatred of the Covenanters to episcopal government, that upon the first reading of the book of Common Prayer in Edinburgh, July, 1637, he was dragged from the pulpit, and narrowly escaped with life. No other bishop was appointed until 1662, when Charles II., contrary to his promise made to the Presbytery, and to the terms of his coronation oath, rescinded the acts past in favour of the Presbytery in 1633, and raised to the see of Edinburgh, George Wishart, D.D. This clergyman had been a preacher at Leith, but having been plundered and imprisoned by the Covenanters, he at length escaped, and in 1646 went abroad, where he probably remained until the Restoration. On his death,"], [41, ""], [42, "I-,, \u25a0 \u201e \u201e, \u2014 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0- . ~:-*i ;-.-. f.i 37 - Eyjhao] 1S1TI HA \"... - \u25a0\u25a0 KEia. 3\u00a3"], [43, "EDINBURGH. 19 in 1670, the bishopric was conferred on Alexander Young, archdeacon of St. AndreAvs, in whose time, owing to the penalties enforced on such persons as did not acknoAvledge the episcopal authority, and other grievances to Avhich the Scotch were subject during the weak reign of Charles the Second, the western counties rebelled and Avere joined by the Presbyterians of Edinburgh, who sheAved the firmest determination to maintain their civil and religious liberties. We do not find that any other bishop was afterwards appointed. The established clergy connected with Edinburgh in 1825, amounted to twenty-five, including three in Leith, two in the Canongate, and two in the parish of St. Cuthbert. The city and its dependencies are divided into sixteen parishes, and contain the same number of churches ; of these parishes, nine are termed collegiate charges, from having two minis ters joined in the discharge of the clerical duties. There are also seven chapels of ease, \u2014 two in the Canongate, one in the Old Town, two in the South district, one at Stockbridge, one at Leith, and an eighth, in which the service is performed in Gaelic. The total number of places of worship is seventy, viz. Established Church, 18; Chapels of Ease, 9; Scottish Episcopal Church, 7 ; Cameronians, 1 ; United Associate Synod of the Secession Church, 9 ; Associate Synod, 1 ; Original Burgher, 1 ; Original Anti-burgher, 1 ; Relief, 6 ; Inde pendents, 3; Baptists, 4; Methodists, 2 ; Roman Catholics, 2; Glassites, Society of Friends, Bereans, Unitarians, New Jerusalem Temple, and Jewish Synagogue, one each. Commerce. \u2014 Every nation and people, from the earliest ages, have maintained some kind of commercial intercourse with each other : the trade of Edinburgh may therefore be considered as coeval with the town itself; and although we cannot ascertain when the latter commenced a mercantile connexion with foreign countries, we find that in the thirteenth century it formed part of an establishment denominated the Four Burglis, Avhose province it Avas to regulate, and take cognizance of, all matters connected with trade and the customs of the burghs. It is, however, conjectured that the foreign trade of Edinburgh can be traced no higher than 1329, when its inhabitants bought of Robert Logan, of Restalrig, tlie port and mills of Leith,* which were confirmed to them by King Robert the First, in the same year; but having neglected to acquire a right of way to and from their harbour, they made little use of it until 1398, when they purchased all the paths and passages within the lands of Restalrig, with power to lade and unlade ships in the water of Leith. From that time commerce appears to have increased, and various regulations were progressively made for its improvement. In 1425, it was enacted that no person should visit foreign nations as a merchant, who had not three serplaiths of wool, or possessed goods of equal value: duties were imposed upon exported cloths and salmon, and also upon English merchandise, imported. At that time the merchants of Edinburgh traded chiefly to England and Flanders, but shortly afterwards extended their traffic to Norway, Denmark, and Sweden ; * See p. 4, where it has been inadvertently stated that the toun of Leith passed by this grant. G"], [44, "20 EDINBURGH. and it is particularly commanded by an act of the Scottish parliament, in 1426 that the merchants returning from abroad should bring with them harness, (armour,) arms &c. Notwithstanding this increasing intercourse with distant countries, the Edinburghers Avere apparently much inferior to the English in their manufactures ; for we find that, in 1430, King James the First, of Scotland, employed two citizens of London, to ship, for his own use, twenty tuns of wine, twelve bows, four dozen yards of cloth of different colours, and twelve yards of scarlet, twenty yards of red worsted, eight dozen pewter vessels, tAvelve hundred wooden cups, some saddles, portmanteaus, and many other inferior articles. In succeeding years, various statutes were enacted, forbidding any person to convey money out of the kingdom, and compelling every merchant to render to the King's Mint, at Edinburgh, a certain quantity of bullion for all goods exported. We learn that, in 1437, these exports consisted chiefly of wool, wool-fells, and hides : and that the imports were mercery, haberdashery, and various other articles for domestic uses. In 1485, the merchants of Edinburgh, jealous of the increasing prosperity of the inha- bitants of Leith, (who were more advantageously situated for the purposes of commerce than themselves,) passed an act, forbidding any tradesman of the former town to enter into partnership with an inhabitant of Leith, under a penalty of 40s. Scots, and the loss of freedom, for one year. Three years previously, the merchants of Edinburgh agreed to repay to Edward the Fourth, of England, the sums which had been advanced by him to James the Second, on account of the intended marriage between their infant children : this circumstance, probably, induced the contemporary historian of Croyland to call Edinburgh an opulent town. From this time Edinburgh continued to improve with a slow and gradual progress ; and, on the annexation of Berwick to England, its suburb, Leith, became the chief port of Scotland. After the battle of Pinkie, in September, 1549, the English found in the harbour thirteen ships, and such a quantity of wine that it could not be conveyed away The accession of James the Sixth to the throne of England in 1603, was highly detri- mental tc the commercial interests of Edinburgh ; as it occasioned the removal ofthe court nobility, and gentry, and consequently a smaller expenditure of money, and a decreased demand for necessaries. In 1656, Leith possessed three vessels, of two hundred and fifty tons, and eleven, of twenty tons; but the incorporation of the Merchant's Company, in 1681, added considerably to the number; and these have been again much increased by the augmentation of trade occasioned by the Union in 1707, previous to which' England exercised the most mischievous influence over the traffic and industry of Scotland. By prohibitory laws, she excluded the produce of that country; and bv the worst artifices, she checked the footing which the Scotch were anxious to take, whether in their commercial intercourse with foreign powers, or in their colonial enterprises \" The manufactures of Edinburgh and Leith are remarkable for their variety The inhabitants are extensively engaged in the distillation of spirituous liquors ; in the Aveaving of linen, kerseymeres, and shaAvls; in the printing of calico and cloth; and in"], [45, "injSiav Pqhlisaed.

In addition to these, great numbers of persons are employed in iron foundries and glass-houses, near the city, to which may be added the numerous paper mills, and printing establishments ; as also, the manufactories of sail-cloth and cordage, and the refining houses and saw-mills on the water of Leith. Customs and Manners. \u2014 The early inhabitants of Edinburgh differed little from those of other countries ; their chief pursuits were, war and the chase ; they lived in huts constructed under the walls of the castle, and, in return for the protection afforded them by its possessor, furnished him with necessaries for his household. Their dress was similar to that of the ancient Britons, and the targe and lance, their only weapons, were of the rudest workmanship. After the Norman conquest of England, and the consequent intercourse with that duchy, the government of Edinburgh was conducted upon the principles of the Normans ; a spirit of chivalry was introduced, and with it, a gradual refinement in the manners of the inhabitants. The nobility vied with their southern neighbours : their dress was splendid ; their retainers numerous ; and their tournaments, and other amusements, conducted on the grandest scale. But the lower classes were wretchedly dressed, fed, and lodged, and were at the same time in a most abject state of servitude. Nor did the burghers and more wealthy inhabitants enjoy much greater advan tages : ready money they had none, and commerce was confined to a select feAv. They had therefore neither means nor inclination to enlarge or improve their town, which increased so gradually, that in the fourteenth century it could not afford sufficient accommodation for the retinue attendant upon a French embassy. At that time the houses were about twenty feet high, small, gloomy, and inconvenient ; their furniture rude and scanty ; their dishes, spoons, and drinking cups, were of wood : silver was rarely seen, and even pewter was accounted costly. In the succeeding century so little progress had the Edinburghers made in the cultivation of the arts, that the king was obliged to send to London for his clothing, household furniture, and other necessaries, although the rage for dress had become so prevalent, that sumptuary laws were required for its restraint. An English writer, who visited Edinburgh in 1598, says, that at the house of a knight, where he dined, the table Avas more than half furnished with great platters of porridge, each having a little piece of sodden meat. He further informs us, that the servants sat down to dinner at the same table, and adds, \" I observed no art of cookery, or furniture of household stuff, but rather rude neglect of both.\" The habits of the men were wholly French, while the women had adopted the costume of the Germans ; but the last sumptuary act, passed in 1631, gives us the best idea of the dress then worn by the Edinburghers. It provided, that none but noblemen, lords of parliament, prelates, privy counsellors, and other officers, should wear cloth of gold or silver, velvets, satins, or other silk stuffs ; or have gold and silver lace on their clothes ; and such persons only as had 6000 marks, or else fourscore chalder of victual, yearly, were to have heralds, trumpeters, and minstrels. It also provided, that those persons permitted to wear silk apparel, should have no embroi-"], [48, "EDINBURGH. 22 dery thereon, nor lace, except a plain lace of silk on the seams and edges, with embroi dered belts and hat-bands : and the same to be cut out on a single taffeta only. Foreign damasks, table-linen, cambrics, lawns, and tiffanies, Avere restricted to the persons above-mentioned, as Avere also, pearls and precious stones. The number of mourning suits in great families was limited, and alteration in the fashion of clothes was forbidden. Husbandmen and labourers were to dress in gray, blue, white, and self-black cloth, of Scottish make : and neither wet or dry confections were to be used at weddings, christen ings, or feasts, unless of fruits indigenous to Scotland. Towards the beginning of the seventeenth century fraudulent bankruptcies were so common, that the Court of Session ordered the magistrates of the city to erect a stone pillory near the Market Cross, Avith a seat on the top of it, on which Avere to be placed, \" all dyvours (insolvent debtors) quha sail sit thereon ane mercat-day, from ten houres in the morning, quill ane hour after dinner.\" Night robberies and riots were also of frequent occurrence. The appearance of the houses was so mean, that in 1621 it Avas enacted, by Parliament, that they should in future be covered with tiles, slate, or lead, instead of thatch or boards. In 1637, the ladies of Edinburgh gave great offence to the magistrates by wearing plaids; and an act was passed for abolishing this practice. In 1660 was licensed the first stage coach between Edinburgh and Leith, and in the same year it was provided, that all houses be thenceforth erected of stone, instead of wood, which had been previously used. In the time of James the Seventh persons were not allowed to appear in the streets during divine service, dancing was not permitted, and various absurd punishments for fornication were inflicted. It was not uncommon for persons to be prosecuted on sus picion of witchcraft, and ten women were actually burnt for that offence, in 1678. The commencement of the eighteenth century is memorable for the Union between the two kingdoms, an event which effected an entire change in the manners and habits of the citizens of Edinburgh ; the increase of traffic brought with it additional wealth, and wealth its usual concomitants, luxury and profusion ; music, dancing, and theatrical amusements, were soon introduced, spacious houses were erected, and every exertion was made to improve the city.

It is intended, in the first place, to allude to the exterior and distant prospects of Edinburgh, with its scenic features : secondly, to elucidate the closer views, or interior of the streets, in which several objects are shewn in unison with each other : and, thirdly, to give a more detailed and critical account of those buildings which are singly represented, or delineated in a more close detail.

Account of the Picturesque Features of Edinburgh and its Environs, as displayed in the accompanying Engravings ; also of its Street-Scenery, and the Public and Private Edifices with which it is adorned. There is not, perhaps, a city in Europe that offers to the lover of picturesque scenery, and to the historian, a more interesting series of subjects for the pencil and pen than Edinburgh. It is not surprising, therefore, that it has attracted the attention of the artist and the author in an eminent degree : and that, besides many separate prints which have been published, illustrative of its general features, and of particular scenes, several embellished works have been produced on the subject. The field still appears so fertile, and offers such a succession of crops, that new labourers approach it, and seek profit, or fame, by trying fresh experiments. They calculate on remuneration for their labours and skill, either by better or cheaper productions, or in the union of the two. On the latter basis, the proprietors of the present publication rest their claims ; persuaded, that if they succeed in rendering it moderate in price, and respectable in execution, a liberal patronage will be the result. The accompanying series of Engravings, with the corresponding descriptions, will be so arranged and connected as to impart to the stranger the clearest information of the peculiarities and characteristics of the Old and New Town of Edinburgh, and of the Scenery by which it is surrounded. As the prints are not numbered, we have adopted the same title for the heading of every article, or distinct subject, as is engraved on the plate beneath each respective view."], [54, "EDINBURGH. 26 EDINBURGH, FROM CRAIGLEITH. It has been truly observed, that for situation, and for the durability of its building materials, few cities have equal advantages to Edinburgh ; and there is, perhaps, no toAvn, of which the general and distant effects are more picturesque and striking. The View before us fully justifies this remark. In the distance, rising immediately above the Old Town, is seen the outline of a rocky eminence, denominated Salisbury Craigs, surmounted by the lofty summit of Arthur's Seat. On that side of the city nearest the beholder, is a level tract of land, which declines gradually to the Firth of Forth. Occupying the apex of a peninsular rock, are the varied buildings of the Castle, among which, the warehouse looking facade of the new barracks constitutes a striking, though not very appropriate feature. Immediately under the rock is the spire of St. Cuthbert's, and the tower of St. John's churches; and near them, the cupola of St. George's rises above the neighbour ing buildings of the New Town, by which it is surrounded. Among the clustered rows of lofty houses in Old Edinburgh, the prominent edifices are the churches of St. Giles and the Tron ; whilst to the left are seen the spire of the modern church of St. Andrew, and the column erected to the memory of the late Lord Melville. At the extremity of the print to the left, are shewn, situated on the Calton Hill, a cenotaph column, or tower, to Lord Nelson, and another building, called the \"National Monument,\" commemorative of the visit of his present Majesty to the northern Metropolis in 1822. EDINBURGH, FROM THE CALTON HILL. The point from which this View is taken is peculiarly adapted to shew the characteristic features of the City. Standing on the lofty eminence of the Calton, the spectator com mands a most extended and diversified prospect over the Old and New Town, as well as the distant country, bounded on the right by a portion of the lofty range of the Pentland Hills. Near the centre, are the houses forming Waterloo-Place, and its continuation, Prince's-street ; and to the left, in this, as in every other View of Edinburgh, forming a conspicuous feature, is the Castle rising from its rocky base. Under it stands a circular building for the exhibition of Panoramas, &c. ; and on the hill, more to the left, is the Bank of Scotland. The immediate foreground is occupied by the buildings of the new"], [55, "Urarai V,- Tio I. Shepherd Engraved V.- -/.'. Tomhleson JEBIXTBITJE&\u00e6, FIE&M CIEAHSILIIITSE. Drawn hy Tho.

Behind it is the range of houses forming the avenue to the North Bridge, and at the end of Hanover-street, towards the centre of the View, stands the Royal Institution, with the buildings of the Old Town, in the distance, to the left, and those of the New Town, on the right : among which latter, the only pro minent object is the Register Office. Conspicuous in the scene is the earthen mound, or raised, artificial road, which forms one of the lines of communication between the Old and the New Town. This is a modern work, and though neither an object of beauty, of science, or of art, is of great public accommodation and convenience. \" This huge deformity, of lumpish length,\" extend ing from Hanover- street in the New Town, to Bank-street in the Old, owes its origin to a tradesman, named Boyd, who raised some planks across the north loch, for the pur pose of obtaining a nearer line of communication \u2014 from the former to the latter parts of the town. The excavated materials which were dug to lay the foundations of neAV build ings, were ordered to be thrown into this place, and, gradually accumulating, soon formed a large and substantial bank. Although its precise contents and measurements cannot be accurately ascertained, it may be calculated at 720 feet in length, 160 in breadth, and 78 feet in height. Its solid contents are estimated at two millions of cart loads, or seven thousand entire yards of earth. I"], [58, "EDINBURGH. 28 PART OF THE OLD TOWN, FROM PRINCES STREET. This Engraving represents one of the singular scenes which is commanded from the terrace-like eminence of Princes-street : and also serves to delineate the peculiar loftiness and arrangement of the houses of the Old Town. Some of these consist of several floors, or flats, as they are here termed. From the inequality of surface on which these dwellings are raised, great variety and diversity are produced. Unlike the tame uniformity and monotonous insipidity of many London streets, here the houses exhibit an endless change in their perpendicular and horizontal lines. The base of one mass is often on a level with the chimneys of another : and thus, whilst some families are living apparently in the clouds, others are destined to dwell beneath the surface of the earth. In the fore-ground of this Print, is a clustered group of old houses, which form a striking contrast to the neighbouring modern buildings. Above them is seen the North Bridge, and in the loch, or valley, by which the Old and New Towns are divided, are the Public Shambles. From the loch, the houses are irregularly dispersed over the side and summit of the hill, and above them is seen the spire of the Tron Church. Immediately beyond the buildings, to the east, is displayed the abrupt face of Salisbury Craigs, which form a sort of amphitheatrical wall of rock. Between this, and the summit, or seat, is a narrow valley, or hollow, from one end of which is obtained a fine view of the Forth, and the interesting country, as well as the high grounds, on the opposite coast. From the summit, the view is still more extensive, diversified, and impressive ; parts of twelve counties may be descried in the panorama it commands. As these rocks form conspicuous features in the scenery of Edinburgh and its vicinity, it may be remarked that Maitland, and other writers, conjecture that Arthur's Seat is a corruption of the Gaelic Ard-na-said, \" the height of arrows,\" and \" no spot,\" says Maitland, \" is fitter for the exercise of archery, than this.\" Arnot is of opinion, that it obtained its name from Prince Arthur, who in the sixth century defeated the Saxons in this neighbourhood. It is, however, generally believed that Salisbury Craigs are so called from the Earl of Salisbury, who attended Edward the Third in an expedition against the Scots, and encamped on this eminence.

Thus occupied, and thus formed, it is not surprising that cleanliness is neglected, and that many slovenly and even filthy habits and customs have ensued. These public stairs remain for years unwashed and uncleansed, and all kinds of domestic slops and offensive filth are thrown from the windows into the streets. Formerly these nuisances were so prevalent, that Edinburgh was shunned by English travellers. The spirit of improvement has visited the city ; and in all modern alterations, and neAV erec tions, not only private comfort, but public accommodation, is consulted. In the annexed View, the back of the Royal Exchange forms a conspicuous feature at the left hand. The number of windows give it a sort of hospital or warehouse appear ance. It is mostly occupied by the council chambers, and their dependent offices. This building will be described in a subsequent page, to accompany a View, representing its principal front. Near the bottom of the print, at the edge of the loch, is a building appropriated to the Sessional School ; to the right of which, is an edifice of lofty dimen sions, used for the Bank of Scotland. The summit of St. Giles's tower is seen beyond the ridge of houses, whilst part of the loch is shewn in the foreground. This valley, although now drained, and partially laid out in gardens and pleasure grounds, was, there is every reason to believe, originally filled with water, by means of an embankment near the bottom of the Leith-wynd ; some small rivulets, issuing from the foot of the Castle rock, might have thus been thrown back into the dell, at the base of the fortress."], [62, "EDINBURGH. 30 THE WEST-BOW, FROM THE LAWN MARKET. The West-Bow is a narrow winding lane, leading by a steep and difficult ascent from the Grass-market to the Lawn-market, which forms a continuation ofthe High-street; and, until the erection of the South bridge, was the only passage by which a wheel-carriage could attain that part of the city from the south. It derives its name either from the curved direction which it assumes, or from having formerly contained the western boAV, or o*ate, of the city.* FeAV parts of Edinburgh are of remote antiquity, but this street may rank amongst the more ancient ; one of its houses is said to have been raised previous to the commencement of the sixteenth century. Near one end of the street are several nests of dwellings, or lands, as here caUed, each marked with a cross placed on the chimneys, or in front of the gables. These, having been erected upon ground originally forming part of the possessions of the Knights Templars, and becoming subsequently annexed to the barony of Drem, had an independent jurisdiction, and Avere consequently inhabited by artificers and tradesmen, who had not been admitted to the freedom of the city. This proved a source of contention with the civic authorities, until the jurisdiction was finally abolished by \" the Act of 1784.\" The Bow was formerly inhabited chiefly by white smiths, whose families were so accustomed to the clatter of hammers, that it is said they could not sleep on Sunday mornings, for want of the usual accompaniment. In the time of the Covenanters, the matrons of the Bow, who Avere distinguished for their religious zeal, were termed, by the Cavaliers and Jacobites, the \" Bow-head Saints,\" and the \" Godly Plants of the Bow-head.\" This street also contains the house in which formerly dwelt one Mitchell, a white-smith, \" a curious mixture of madness, knavery, absurdity, and something like humour, who published various lucubrations under the title of 'the Finclarian Doctor.' \" \u2014 Provincial Antiquities of Scotland, vol. ii. 104. The over-hanging stories and lookern windows of the buildings, by which the Lawn market and the West-BoAv are connected, as represented in the accompanying Engraving, have a picturesque appearance, when delineated on paper ; but few persons will regret their removal, to make room for modern improvements. SAINT MARY'S WYND, FROM THE PLEASANCE. The term Wynd is probably derived from the Anglo-Saxon windan, to turn, and in Edinburgh, as in other parts of Scotland, signifies a lane leading from a main street, and of sufficient width to admit the passage of a carriage. Saint Mary's Wynd, so called from its proximity to a religious house dedicated to that saint, is a lane of communication * One of the gate-houses, or arched entrances, to the city of Lincoln, is to this day denominated the Stone-Bow."], [63, "llrawr, \"by 31 o. \u25a0ST, MAWS WYi\u00bb,-' m PMEASANCE.

This street was anciently closed on the south, by a gate called St. Mary's-tvynd Port, which was destroyed about the middle of the last century. Near the head of the Wynd, on the west side, there Avas formerly a Convent and a Chapel for Cistercian Nuns, and an Hospital dedicated to the Virgin Mary. When, or by whom, this house was founded, is unknown. Its revenues appear to have been small, for in 1499 the Town Council ordered all alms, oblations, &c. to be applied to the relief of the beads-women by whom it was inhabited : and further ordained, that each of the better class of citizens should, under penalty of forty pence, collect alms daily, for their better support. Out of the sums thus raised, the chap lain was to receiA-e a yearly salary of ten pounds, Scotch currency. \u2014 No vestiges of this building now remain. The Pleasance, whence the annexed View is taken, is a long narrow street, communi cating with the main road to Dalkeith. It derives its name from a Nunnery which was formerly established near this place, and dedicated to St. Mary de Placentia : but the date of its erection, and the name of its founder, are unascertained. Previous to the commencement of the seventeenth century, owing to thc high price of building ground, and the habit which the inhabitants of Edinburgh had acquired, of living above each other in separate floors of the same house, it had been customary to raise the buildings to a very dangerous height ; it was therefore enacted by the Scottish parliament in 1698, that no new house facing a public street should exceed five stories in altitude; but as this law applies only to the front of a building, it not unfrequently happens that, from the inequality of ground, the back part consists of eight, ten, or even more floors : but it is generally understood, that if a house falls, it cannot be rebuilt of the same height. As many of the dwellings in St. Mary's Wynd are considerably above the prescribed standard, and others are below it, their disproportionate elevation, coupled with the singularity of their projecting roofs and embattled gables, give a truly picturesque character to the street ; although the effect is much diminished by its dirty appearance, and the mean uses to which the houses are appropriated. K"], [66, "EDINBURGH. 32 The CANON-GATE, looking West. With the exception of the Castle, and the Palace of Holy-Rood, there is, perhaps, no portion of the City of Edinburgh more interesting to the antiquary, than that called the Canon-gate. Its origin is carried back by record to the early part of the twelfth century, when David the First, who had recently endowed the Church of the Holy Cross, granted to the Canons of that house, permission to erect a Burgh between their Church and the Nether-Bow. It was formerly denominated the Herbargeire (or Hospitium) of the Monastery, but has since acquired its present appellation. In this part of the town, the retainers and visitors of the monks of Holy-Rood were lodged and entertained for cen turies \u2014 here, in after-ages, the ambassadors and envoys to the Court of Edinburgh took up their abode \u2014 and these very houses, in times comparatively modern, Avere the town residences and hotels of the nobility of Scotland, and formed, in fact, the Court-end of the City. The Canon-gate comprehends within its limits most of the eastern part of old Edinburgh, and had formerly a separate jurisdiction, with magistrates appointed by the Canons of Holy-Rood, to whom its inhabitants were subject, and to whose Church, until the erection of their present place of worship in 1688, they mostly resorted. This district is now termed a Burgh of Barony, and is governed by the Town Council, Avho appoint to the magistrac)', certain persons of their own body. These are denominated Baron Bailies, and have the power of holding courts, and of deciding petty causes. The build ing, in which their business is transacted, is called the Canon-gate Tolbooth. At that end of the street nearest to Holy-Rood House, stood formerly a Stone Cross, denominated the Girth, which marked the bounds of the sanctuary. The houses represented in the Engraving, are chiefly remarkable for their irregular appearance ; but their lofty stories, and diversified outlines, contrast strongly with the new designs, and long unbroken fronts, of the modern streets of Edinburgh. In one of the buildings, on the right hand of the Print, it is said, that Gay, the poet, resided, and wrote some of those works which became so popular. ST.

This part of Edinburgh was formerly called the Land market, but is now corruptly termed the Lawn-market. The principal object in the View is Saint Giles's Church, at one time a cathedral, the lower portion of whicli, was formerly obscured by the Lucken-booths, a range of sheds. Various alterations and improvements, in the architectural features of this building, have been recently determined upon. It is not ascertained when, or by whom, this church was founded: certainly not by its legendary patron, St. Giles. From a taxation of the Deanery of Linlithgow, in the reign of David the First, it appears that the \" Eccles. Sci Egidii de Edin.\" was then valued at twenty-six marks, yearly. It is again mentioned in 1359, when certain lands were granted by David the Second, to a priest officiating at the altar of Saint Catharine, in this church : in 1387, a contract, still extant, was made between the magistrates of Edinburgh and certain stone-masons, who agreed \" to make and voute fyve Chapells on the south syde of the Paryce Kyrke, fra the west Gavyl lyand and rynan doun Est, on to the grete Pyler of the Stepyl voutyt on the same Maner by the Masounys as the vout abovye Sanct Stevinys Auter standand on the north syde of the Parys Auter of the Abbay of the Haly-rude Houss.\" Seven years afterwards, the south aisles were added. In the reign of James the Second, a Mr. Preston, of Gourton, bequeathed to the Church, an arm of its patron saint : in return for which, the civic authorities, in 1454, granted to his heirs the privilege of carrying it in all public processions ; a privilege which they enjoyed until the Reformation. In 1462, the choir is stated to have been rebuilt; and in 1466, the edifice was converted into a Collegiate Church, the ministers and officers of which, chiefly derived their emoluments from the numerous chaplainries and altarages with which it was endoAved. After the Reformation, its revenues, ornaments, and relics, were appropriated to the common use of the inhabitants ; it was divided into distinct places of worship, and Presbyterian ministers were appointed to officiate in each. Here the celebrated John Knox displayed his fanatical eloquence ; here James the Sixth of Scotland delivered his farewell speech, to his subjects; and within these walls were held the numerous convocations, by which Presbyterianism was finally established in Scotland. The Church consists of a nave and ailes, a choir, transept, and central tower, surmounted by clustered pinnacles, and flying ribs resembling an imperial crown. The interior is divided into four several churches, the names of which have been already enumerated. In the back ground is displayed the tower of the Tron Church, as repaired after the late fire ; and to the right of the View is seen a portion of the County-Hall, and some of the lofty buildings on one side of the LaAvn-Market."], [72, "EDINBURGH. 34 GEORGE STREET, ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH, and LORD MELVILLE'S MONUMENT. This street forms the principal longitudinal line of communication in the original New Town, which it divides into two nearly equal parts, and is itself intersected, at regular intervals, by Hanover-street, Frederick-street, and Castle-street. It is terminated to the east by Saint Andrew's Square, and to the west by Charlotte Square. The public build ings which it contains are, Saint Andrew's Church, on the north side ; the Physician's Hall, nearly opposite, on the south ; and the Assembly Rooms, on the same side, more to the west. For regularity and uniformity of design, this street is not surpassed by any other in the northern Metropolis ; \" but although otherwise handsome, it is rendered comparatively mean by its extreme breadth of roadway, extending between two rows of low houses, Avith broad slated roofs, unbroken and undignified by occasional projections or elevations.\"* In a recent work, called \" Modern Athens,\" George street is described as \" the most gloomy and melancholy that can well be imagined.\" It is, however, pro posed to diversify its appearance, by the erection of statues at the points where it is crossed by Hanover and Frederick streets, and also in Charlotte Square. The principal object represented in the accompanying Print is Saint Andrew's Church, known by its fine tapering spire, and a bold portico, supported by Corinthian columns. In the distance is displayed part of Saint Andrew's Square ; in the centre of which, forming a pleasing termination to the street, is the column raised to commemorate the late Lord Melville ; whilst in the back ground is seen the \" Royal Bank of Scotland.\" WATERLOO PLACE, THE NATIONAL, AND NELSON'S MONUMENTS. There is no portion of the New Town of Edinburgh more worthy of graphic illustration than that represented in the. annexed Engraving.

Nelson's Monu ment, a lofty castellated toAver, in the New Town, as the castle in the Old, is one of th* most prominent features; and in this view forms a pleasing termination to the street, although the proximity of the neighbouring building, called the National Monument, certainly detracts from its character and consequence.

In traversing this, the specta tor views in succession, the endless range of streets which compose the New ToAvn, bounded by the Corstorphine Hills ; \u2014 the Firth of Forth, with the distant mountains ; \u2014 the Town and Harbour of Leith ; \u2014 Musselburgh Bay, terminated by North Berwick Law ; \u2014 Arthur's Seat, and Salisbury Craigs, with Holy-Rood House in the plain beneath; \u2014 and lastly, the darkened and irregular masses of the Old Toavii, skirted and guarded on one side by the ancient Citadel. The houses of Waterloo Place are built upon several small arches, and one of larger dimensions, which bear the name of the Regent Bridge. This crosses the low Calton, and connects the Hill with the ridge upon which the New Town is chiefly built. The Act of Parliament authorizing the erection of this bridge, and the formation of the road from Princes Street to the Calton, which may be deemed one of the most important of the recent improvements of Edinburgh, was passed in 1814. We shall have occasion to notice, and give some account of, this structure in a subsequent page, in referring to a VieAV of it. At the point of junction between Princes Street and Waterloo Place, is the Register Office, which was built to preserve the Records of Scotland. Previous to its erection, these national archives were in a state of disorder and decay ; but are now arranged, and care fully guarded from further injury. A small portion of this building is seen to the left of the annexed Print. On the north side of the street is the Waterloo Hotel, the largest and most splendid establishment of the kind in Edinburgh : amongst other apartments, is a coffee-room 80 feet by 40 ; and a dining-room of equal dimensions. The expense of its erection was about \u00a330,000. More to the east, on the same side, is the Hall for the public meetings of the Incorporations of the Calton; opposite to which, are the New Prison and the Calton Burying-ground. Near the latter, stands the General Post Office, surmounted by the royal arms : and more to the west, the Stamp Office. The Theatre Royal, partially represented in the accompanying Engraving, is marked by its portico, and by statues of Shakespeare, and the Muses of Tragedy and Comedy, placed as acroters to the roof-pedi ment, and its lateral copings. Situated in such a respectable street, and in connexion, as it is, with several handsome public buildings, this theatre makes a very poor and mean appearance externally, although the interior is fitted up with some degree of attention to richness of effect. L"], [76, "EDINBURGH. 36 THE JAIL-GOVERNOR'S HOUSE. This VieAV is intended to exhibit the peculiarities of that portion of the Old Town of Edinburgh, lying between the Calton Hill and the North Bridge. In the distance, to the left is seen the outline of part of the Castle, and the rock on which it stands : whilst the central division of the Print is occupied by the Bridge, and the houses forming a line of communication with Princes-street. Among the group of old houses, on the east side of the former, is a mean-looking place of worship, called Lady Glenorchy' s Chapel, and an edifice now termed the College Kirk, but which was originally a collegiate church, dedi cated to the Holy Trinity, and founded, in 1452, by Mary of Gueldres, consort of King James the Second. More to the right, is the spire, and part of the roof, of the Orphan Hospital, noticed by that eminent and amiable philanthropist, Howard, as one of the most useful charities in Europe. These buildings will be hereafter separately described. The principal and most interesting object represented in the Engraving, is a castellated edifice, called \" The Jail-Governor's House,\" overhanging one of the precipitous sides of the Calton Hill, and overlooking the various departments of the New Prison. This building was founded, together with the Jail, in 1815, from the designs, and under the superintendence, of Mr. Elliot, the architect, who has carried into execution many of the modern improvements of Edinburgh. Romantically seated on the ledge of a rocky hill, its embattled turrets, parapets, and other architectural features, present an appearance at once imposing and picturesque. It contains apartments for the governor, or captain of the jail, as here termed, and a Committee-room for the use of the Commissioners, in whom the government of the prison is vested. It has been objected by some persons, that this structure abounds too much in the caprices of the Gothic style of architecture. \" But, surely,\" observes Sir Walter Scott, in the \" Provincial Antiquities of Scotland,\" vol. i. p. 84, \" if the Gothic style can be any where adopted with propriety, the jail of a metropolis, built on the very verge of a precipice, and overhanging the buildings beneath like an ancient citadel, is the most appropriate subject for the purpose.\" THE STONE QUARRIES, CRAIGLEITH. Edinburgh, like Bath and some few other cities, is advantageously situated in regard to building materials. London has no quarries in its neighbourhood, and cannot, there fore, command a supply of stone for the erection of its houses ; but as the substratum consists of fine clay, the inhabitants, from an early time to the present, have manufac tured it into bricks for building ; and have thus converted the soil beneath their feet, to substantial and even handsome edifices over their heads, for the use and luxuries of civilized society.

The hill, at one end of which these excavations are made, is composed, almost to the surface, of free-stone of a very white appearance, and of solid texture. Hence have been obtained blocks of immense size, which are susceptible of great delicacy of sculpture, as exemplified in the capitals of the columns in Waterloo Place, and in other parts of modern Edinburgh. The View of the City, seen in the distance, is similar to that already described as taken from Craigleith: the Castle-rock, Arthur's Seat, and the Calton Hill, being the most conspicuous objects. The Quarries, here represented, are not the only sources from which materials for the construction of the numerous public and private buildings which have recently been erected in and near Edinburgh, have been obtained. Stones of various kinds and qualities, and adapted to particular uses, are to be found in almost every direction. The basaltic masses of Salisbury Craigs, and the adjacent heights, afford durable materials for repairing the streets and highways of the Metropolis : and also present numerous geological specimens for the amusement and study of the mineralogist and the lapidary. The enormous quarry at Gilmerton, between three and four miles from the city, not only affords large quantities of limestone, which is chiefly used for architectural purposes, but, from the peculiarity of its nature, is an object of great interest and curiosity. In digging stone from this vast subterranean cavern, it has been found more profitable to keep near the surface, than to proceed deep into the earth : the cut, or chasm, formed by this method of working advance^ obliquely for nearly the distance of a mile up the side of a long ridge or hill : and as daylight is admitted through the apertures by which the stone is conveyed to the surface, no place affords better opportunities for the examination of the various strata of which this district is formed. In addition to the Quarries of Craigleith, Salisbury Craigs, and Gilmerton, another, situated at Hailes, three miles west of the Castle, affords free-stone of a different quality to that of Craigleith. It consists of thin natural lamina, or layers, divided by a stratum of soil, or softer stone, and is chiefly used for pavements, and for the stairs of houses. Possessing such advantages, both in the beauty of situation, and in the stone obtained from the above-mentioned sources, Edinburgh has the means of vying in architectural embellishments with any other city in the United Kingdom. Much has already been done towards its improvement; and although the want of originality in some of the modern buildings detracts from their merit, others have been erected which do equal credit to the taste and sound judgment of the architects by whom they were designed."], [80, "EDINBURGH. 38 THE NORTH BRIDGE, CALTON HILL, &c. FROM THE BANK OF SCOTLAND. This noble Bridge, and admirable design for connecting the two portions of Edinburgh, naturally divided by the North Loch, is perhaps no where seen to greater advantage than from the station whence the accompanying View was taken. The Print also displays part of the Calton, and the buildings recently erected upon it. Among these are the Old and New Observatories, forming a group on the Hill, to the left; near the centre is the Cenotaph erected to the late celebrated Professor, Playfair; to the right of which, stands Nelson's columnal tower, having behind it the \"National Monument.\" On the lower part of the hill is another range or mass of modern buildings, composed of the New Jail, the Gover nor's House, and the Bridewell. The foreground, to the left, is formed by some of the houses of the New Town, whilst in the opposite side of the View are some of the buildings of the more ancient part of the city, connected by the Bridge, under, and to the Avest of which, is a spacious Market-place for fish and vegetables. The first stone of the North Bridge was laid on the 21st of October, 1763, by Provost Drummond, who had projected and recommended the plan of forming a road from the Old Town, to a district which was to be laid out for new buildings. The mud was then removed from the loch, but nothing further done until August, 1765, when Mr. William Mylne, brother to the architect of Blackfriars'-bridge, London, gave designs, and contracted to com plete the work before Martinmas, 1769, for the sum of \u00a310,140. The undertaking was scarcely finished, when an accident occurred, by which several lives Avere lost. The hill against which the south end of the bridge abutted, is very steep, and consisted in a great part of earth, which had been dug from the foundation of houses, and throAvn down the declivity towards the loch. Of this, the architect was not aware, and had neglected to go deep enough for a sound footing. He had also failed to build the piers to a sufficient height, and was therefore obliged to place an immense mass of earth upon the arches, in order to raise the bridge to its requisite level. The result was, that the side walls and abutments at the south end, burst, and some of the vaults gave way : other parts were pulled down, and rebuilt with chain bars; the superincumbent earth was removed, and its place sup plied by small arches constructed between the larger ones ; an arch of relief was thrown over that to the south, which had been shattered; and the whole was strengthened by but tresses and counterparts, at an additional expense of \u00a38000. The Bridge is 1125 feet in length, from High Street to Princes Street; in breadth between the parapets 40 feet; and at each end 50 feet. It consists of three large arches, and several small ones concealed from sight; having also arched passages through the lateral abutments. The span of each ofthe large arches is 72 feet; the smaller ones 20 feet, each; the thickness of the piers 13 feet and a half; total length of piers and arches 310 feet; and the height from the base of the piers to the top of the parapet 68 feet."], [81, "by SXacy.

The Royal Institution, an elevation of which is represented in the annexed Engravino*, was constructed at the joint expense, and for the mutual accommodation, of the members of the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and the Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland. Before the building is described, it may be deemed expe dient to give a short history of those literary and scientific bodies, who have apartments for their respective uses within its walls. We have no account of any literary society established in Edinburgh previous to the year 1718, when the Masters of the High School, and Mr. Thomas Ruddiman, the celebrated grammarian, founded an Institution for improving the members in classical knowledge, \" without meddling with the affairs of Church or State.\" The society was afterwards joined by Henry Home, (Lord Kames,) Archibald Murray, James Cochrane, and other members of the Scottish bar, with George Wishart, a minister of Edinburgh. This association was succeeded, in 1731, by a\" Society for the Improvement of Medical Knoivledge.\" Having collected a mass of papers, they published Essays and Observations on the various branches of Medicine and Surgery. Their Transactions, in five volumes, octavo, under the title of \" Medical Essays, Observations,\" &c. have passed through several editions, in various languages. In 1739, the celebrated Mr. Maclaurin, Professor of Mathematics in the University of Edinburgh, recommended that the society should extend its views to subjects of philosophy and general literature. The Institution Avas accord ingly remodelled, a set of laws was drawn up, the number of its members Avas increased, and they were distinguished, from that time, by the title of \" The Society for Improving Arts and Sciences;\" or more generally, by the appellation of the \" Philosophical Society of Edinburgh.\" They chose for their president, James, Earl of Morton, afterwards President of the Royal Society of London : Sir John Clerk, of Pennycuick, one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and Dr. John Clerk, were elected Vice-Presidents, and Mr. Maclaurin and Dr. Plummer, at the same time, Avere appointed Secretaries. A few years afterwards, the meetings of the Society were interrupted for a considerable space of time by the disorders of the country, in the rebellion of 1745 ; and no sooner Avas public tranquillity re-established, than it suffered a severe loss by the death of Mr. Maclaurin, whose comprehensive genius, and ardour in the pursuits of science, peculiarly qualified him for conducting the business of such an Institution. The meetings of the society were, howeA'er, reneAved about the year 1752 ; and the new secretaries, Mr. David Hume, the historian, and Dr. Alexander Monro, junior, were directed to arrange, and prepare for the press, such papers as were judged worthy of being submitted to the public eye. In the year 1754, by the exertions of Mr. Allan Ramsay, son of the celebrated Scottish poet of that name, an association termed \" The Select Society,\" Avas formed, for the promotion of philosophical inquiry, and for the improvement of its members in M"], [84, "EDINBURGH. 40 oratory. This society at first consisted of fifteen persons, appointed by Mr. Ramsay and his friends ; but, in 1/57, their number amounted to one hundred and thirty, including all the literati of Edinburgh and its vicinity. These Avere increased both in number and respectability in succeeding years, and among them were many persons eminent for their learning and scientific acquirements. Owing to the death of members, and various other causes, the Philosophical Society appears to have languished for some time previous to the year 1777, when its meetings became more frequent ; and from the uncommon zeal and distinguished abilities of Lord Kames, Avho was at that time elected its president, the business was conducted with reneAved activity and success. About the end of the year 1782, in a meeting of the Professors of the University of Edinburgh, many of whom were likewise members of the Philosophical Society, and warmly attached to its interests, a scheme was proposed by the Rev. Doctor Robertson, Principal of the University, for the establishment of a neAv society on a more extended plan, and after the model of some of the foreign academies, whicli have for their object, the cultivation of every branch of science, erudition, and taste. The measure was adopted, and application was made to parliament for a charter, which was procured in the ensuing year. By this charter the members were incorporated by the name of \" The Royal Society of Edinburgh,\" and vested with various privileges. The first general meeting was held on the 23d of June, 1783, when, amongst other resolutions, it was agreed, that all persons who had been members of the Philosophical, should be considered Fellows of the Royal Society. The members are divided into two distinct classes ; one of which, denominated The Physical Class, has charge of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, Natural History, and Avhatever relates to the improvement of Arts and Manufactures : the other, termed The Literary Class, has cognizance of Literature, Philology, History, Antiquities, and Speculative Philosophy. The former of these met, for the first time, on the 4th of November, 1783, when Dr. William Cullen, Professor of Medicine, was appointed to take the chair. The latter held their first meeting on the 17th of the same month, when the Rev. Dr. Robertson, Principal of the University, was appointed president. The Royal Society consists of ordinary and honorary members ; the latter distinction being restricted to persons residing out of Great Britain and Ireland. Their general business is transacted by a president, two vice presidents, with a council of twelve members, and a secretary and treasurer. It is pro vided by the charter of the Institution, that all objects of natural history presented to the Society, be deposited in the Museum of the University of Edinburgh : and that all remains of antiquity, public records, or ancient manuscripts, be preserved in the Library of the Faculty of Advocates in the same City. The Society published the first volume of their Transactions in 1788 ; and have since given other volumes to the public at various intervals. The present President is Sir Walter Scott. The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, whose meetings are also held in the rooms of the Royal Institution, was first projected by the Earl of Buchan, in 1780 ; and Avas incor-"], [85, "EDINBURGH. 41 porated by royal charter on the 29th March, 1783. It has a museum, which contains a large and curious collection of coins, charters, ancient armour, &c.

The Society published the first volume of their Transactions in 1792. \" The Royal Institution,\" or Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, who also have accommodations in the building represented in the annexed print, was founded on the 1st of February, 1819, and opened an Exhibition of Paintings by ancient masters, on the 11th of March, in the same year. Various attempts had been previously made for the establishment of an Academy of Scottish Artists, in Edinburgh, but had failed. In March, 1824, the Directors of the Society being desirous of establishing a more intimate connexion with the body of Professional Artists in Scotland, requested several gentlemen of acknowledged talent to have their names enrolled as Associated Artists of the Institution, previously to application being made for a royal charter. A meeting was held in the following November, when Lord Meadowbank, one of the Com mittee of Directors, addressed the Associated Artists in explanation of the objects of the Institution, and requested them to offer any suggestions which they deemed likely to advance the interests of the Society, and the encouragement of the Fine Arts. In January 1825, previously to an annual general meeting of the Institution, the Associated Artists requested to know whether they were entitled to vote in the election of Directors, &c. After some discussion it was decided, \" That no artist should be capable of being elected on any Committee, or of voting as a Governor, while he continued to be a professional artist.\" Some dissatisfaction was afterwards manifested by that body : a char ter of incorporation, obtained in 1827, and the by-laws subsequently made for the regulation of the Society, have now defined the province and duties of the respective members. The Roy al Institution, or building wherein the above-mentioned learned bodies transact their business, and where the exhibitions of paintings are now held, occupies the southern extremity of Hanover-street, and, as previously stated, was constructed at the joint expense of the public societies who are accommodated in its rooms. Owing to the inse curity of the ground upon which it stands, it was considered necessary to lay the founda tions upon piles; the cost for driving which, amounted to \u00a31600. It was commenced in 1825 from the designs of Mr. Playfair. The architecture is of the Doric order, and the front is adorned with a noble portico supported by eight columns. Its shape is that of a parallelogram of about ninety feet by eighty, and the expense of its erection was upwards of \u00a320,000."], [86, "EDINBURGH. 42 ST. GEORGES CHAPEL, YORK-PLACE. - The singular building represented in the annexed Engraving is situated on the south side of the western continuation of Queen-street, called York-Place. This forms a portion of the second New Town, as it may be termed, being an addition to the original plan of 1767. The street is wide and open, but the houses are neither remarkable for their size or for tlieir architectural embellishments ; and the only public building it contains, besides the one here delineated, is St. Paul's Chapel, a modern-gothic building, which will be described in a subsequent page. St. George's Chapel was erected in 1794, from the designs of the late Mr. Robert Adam, who appears, in this instance, to have left his Roman forms, and fanciful ornaments, for something which might then have been considered Gothic, or ecclesiastical. The main building is a regular octagon, having in front a square porch, flanked by covered passages, which form a sort of screen to the Chapel. The architecture cannot be considered to belong to any regular order, as windows of the earliest pointed style are placed in juxta position with those of the nineteenth century ; and ornaments of the time of Henry VIII. are contrasted with pinnacles, battlements, and other members, which, however original, are neither beautiful nor in very good taste. The interior of the building is neatly fitted up : the pulpit and reading-desk occupy the two southern angles, and have the altar behind them. It contains six hundred and fifty sittings, and cost \u00a32200. ST. GEORGE'S CHURCH, AND WEST SIDE OF CHARLOTTE SQUARE. The Square, a portion of which is represented in the accompanying Print, forms the western termination of George-street, and was constructed from the designs of the late Mr. Robert Adam, who is said to have exerted the fullest effort of his talents in rendering it worthy of the residence of the aristocracy of Scotland. In this he has in a great measure succeeded ; and had his designs for the Church, which is the chief ornament in this quadrangular mass of buildings, been adopted, few squares in this kingdom would have rivalled this, in architectural composition and effect. A profusion of embellishment, as was the common fault of Mr. Adam, is displayed, and is rendered the more conspicuous from the tameness and monotonous appearance of the houses in the neighbouring streets. So strictly did the magistrates, and trustees appointed for carrying into effect the improvements of the New Town, adhere to Mr. Adam's elevations in the erection of the houses, that one gentleman, who had constructed a dwelling on the east side of the Square, from the designs of another architect, was compelled to pull it down, and re-erect it according to the original design ; although, in the opinion of competent judges, the front was much better than any of the adjacent buildings.

Mr. Adam's design was taken partly from the west front of St. Paul's Cathedral, London; but was rejected on account of the expense attending its execution, and a building, made up from the shreds and patches of his, was \"put together in as cheap and thrifty a manner as seceder's heart could wish;\" thus destroying the unity of that gentleman's plan. The first stone was laid by William Calder, Esq. Lord Provost of Edinburgh, assisted by Mr. Reid, the architect, on the 14th of May, 1811, when a glass case, containing some coins, a plan of the building, and other papers, was there deposited. It was completed in 1814, at an expense of \u00a333,000, and affords accommodation for about 1600 persons. The building, as seen from the Square, consists of a recessed vestibule, supported by Ionic columns, elevated on steps, and surmounted by a balustrade. The vestibule is flanked by wings of a plain and massive style of architecture ; and from behind it, on a basement 48 feet square, rises a dome, with a lantern and cross, in imitation of that of St. Paul's Church, London. The total length of the facade towards the Square is 112 feet; the breadth of the steps, 68 feet; the height of the columns, 35 ; and the summit of the cross from the ground, 160 feet. The extreme width of the Church is 128 feet. Mr. Adam's estimate was \u00a326,000. \"This Church,\" observes a critical and discriminating writer in the Scots Magazine for October, 1813, \" may, perhaps, be said to belong to the Italian, the lowest specimen of the Roman school; although, speaking ingenuously, it resembles nothing of any authority ever seen or heard of in time past. In place of a portico with a projecting flight of steps, (as designed by Mr. Adam,) we have a vestibule, the columns of which are nearly on a level with the fronts of the wings, where there is seen only a small window in the centre of a circular-headed recess. Above the cornice, most enormous pedestals are erected, to receive the ends of the balustrade above the entablature of the columns, exhi biting nothing but a mere mass of stone, and possessing no greater claims to admiration, than could be given with facility, and very little ingenuity, to the face of Craigleith quarry, by cutting it regularly, and excavating a small opening in the centre.\" The vestibule is supported by four columns, and two pilasters, of the Ionic order. To these it has been objected, that the extreme columns and pilasters are too close to each other, that the abaci of the capitals are too large, the capitals themselves nearly one-third too small for the height of the pillars, which are also too high for their diameter, and that the effect of the intercolumniations is injured by the disparity of space between the central columns and those on each side. To these objections it has been added, that the architect has totally omitted the architrave and fascia of the entablature. The dome by which the building is surmounted, is also considered too large for the facade, N"], [90, "EDINBURGH. 44 THE NEW BRIDEWELL, SALISBURY CRAIGS, AND ARTHUR'S SEAT, FROM CALTON HILL. The edifice which forms the principal feature in the annexed Engraving, was con structed from the designs and under the superintendence of the late Mr. Robert Adam. The foundation-stone was laid by the Earl of Morton, as Grand Master-Mason of Scot land, on the 30th of November, 1791, when the current coins, an almanack, newspapers, and a plate containing an inscription, were deposited beneath it. It is stated that this was the first building of the name constructed in Edinburgh, and as it was commenced at a time when the public mind was much agitated, and the architecture assuming a fortress-like appearance, the people were suspicious that it would form a sort of bastile, and be used for secret and tyrannic purposes. It was completed for the reception of prisoners in 1796, at the expense of the City and County, with an additional grant from Government of \u00a35000. The west front consists of a body with two projecting wings, and a central building also advanced before the main edifice. The upper part is embattled, and the angles are adorned with ornaments resembling small watch-turrets. The roof of the central portion of the Bridewell is fiat, but the wings have embattled gables surmounted by Grosses. The back part of the prison, which contains the working apartments, forms a semicircle, and will be described hereafter, when the internal arrangement will be also explained.* It is surrounded by a strong wall, and has, in front, a lodge for the porter and turnkeys. Previous to the erection of the Bridewell, Edinburgh contained another edifice of the same nature, under the name of the House of Correction, which was projected in 1632, and erected shortly afterwards, that, as expressed in the act of council, \"vertew might thereby be advanced, vice supprest, and ydele people compellit to betake themselffs to sum vertew and industrie.\" Salisbury Craigs and Arthur's Seat, which form the back ground of the View, have been so frequently noticed in the preceding pages, that further mention of them will be unnecessary. THE NEW JAIL, FROM CALTON HILL. The increase of the population of Edinburgh, and consequent augmentation of crime, coupled with the inconvenience and dilapidated state of the Old, or High-street, Tolbooth, and that of the Canongate, caused the magistrates of the city to construct a prison, which should be better adapted to secure the persons, and preserve the health, of the culprits confined within its walls. Much discussion arose before the site of the intended structure was determined upon. Forrester's Wynd, a narrow lane, was first proposed, and an Act * To the east of the Bridewell, another prison, for debtors, is now building."], [91, "\u25a0- ' \u2014 \u25a0\u2014 , , =11 \u25a0 ' ':oricrd . - by Vf.

Owing, however, to the unfitness of the situation, the want of air, and extent of airing-ground, (unless acquired at an immense expense,) the plan was abandoned. The south side of Princes-street was then recommended, but the inhabitants of that part of the city raised objections ; and other persons considered, that the exhalations arising from the North Loch, near which the back of the intended building would have approached, must be detrimental to the health of the prisoners. It was at length decided, that the Calton Hill was the fittest spot for the erection of the proposed edifice, not only on account of the salubrity of the air, but because the ground was public property, and little expense would be incurred in the purchase. Early in the year 1814, the above-mentioned Act was repealed ; and by another, then procured, the commissioners appointed for carrying into effect the improvements of Edinburgh, were authorized to treat with the city for the land required. A site to the west of the Bridewell having been selected, the foundation-stone was laid in September, 1815, and the building was completed in the same month, two years afterwards ; when those persons who had been previously confined in the Canon gate Tolbooth, were lodged in it, and the former was no longer used as a place of confinement. The New Jail, as represented in the accompanying Print, has a castellated character, although it is not in conformity to the military architecture of any distinct period. It consists of three several compartments. The ground floor is appropriated to the use of, and occupied by, six distinct classes of criminals : \u2014 women-prisoners, debtors, untried men, and the remaining three by female convicts ; having also an infirmary. A portion of the second story of the building contains the night-cells, which are ranged on each side of long passages. The central division includes the Chapel, which is indicated in the Print by three pointed windows. The lower part is divided into separate boxes for felons ; and the Gallery is appropriated to debtors. There are also four rooms used as Infirmaries. The total number of cells in both stories is fifty-four. Each class of prisoners has a distinct open arcade for exercise, and also a court-yard. These connect at one point, where there is placed an octangular watch-house, overlooking the whole ; and that is again surmounted by the governor's house, which has been already described. The building is surrounded by a massive wall, about twenty feet high ; and is entered by an embattled gate, or lodge, which affords accommodation for the turnkeys ; and has on the top a platform for the execution of criminals. Owing to the number of illiterate young persons, of both sexes, committed to this prison, a School has been instituted for their education ; and a modification of the London plan of prison dicipline has been adopted with success."], [94, "EDINBURGH. 46 THE ROYAL BANK, ST. ANDREW'S SQUARE. The house now occupied by the establishment of the Royal Bank was originally built at the expense, and for the residence of, Sir Lawrence Dundas, for many years the representa tive ofthe City of Edinburgh in parliament, and grandfather ofthe present Lord of that name. It was sold to Government at the commencement of the last century, together with the feu of two pieces of building-ground, in York Place, for the sum of \u00a310,000 ; and was, until lately, occupied by the Board of Excise ; but it has recently been purchased by its present occupiers for \u00a333,000, thus shewing the vast increase in the value of property in the New Town within the last few years. The Bank is situated in a recess on the east side of St. Andrew's Square, of which it forms one of the chief ornaments. It is a square building, three stories high. In the front is a rusticated basement, from which rise four pilasters with Corinthian capitals, supporting an entablature and pediment : on the tympanum of the latter are sculptured the armorial bearings of the first proprietor of the building. The cornice is richly ornamented. When first established by charter in May, 17275 the stock of the Royal Bank amounted to about \u00a3111,000 sterling, which was part of the equivalent money given to Scotland at the Union. That sum, however, having been found insufficient, another charter was procured in 1738, by which the directors were authorized to increase their stock to \u00a3150,000; and they were subsequently empowered to raise the amount to \u00a31,000,000. Their present stock, however, is said to be upwards of one million and a half, sterling. The business of the Company is transacted by a governor, deputy-governor, directors, and extraordinary directors. No person can be elected governor, without holding shares to the amount of \u00a32000; or deputy-governor, unless possessing \u00a31500 stock. The directors must hold \u00a31000 each, and the extraordinary directors half that sum. THE ROYAL EXCHANGE, HIGH-STREET, is situated on the north side of the street above-named, nearly opposite to St. Giles's Church ; and is remarkable as being either the first, or among the very earliest, of the modern buildings of Edinburgh. Early in the year 1733, the town-council were authorized to contract for the purchase of the decayed old houses which formerly stood on the site of this edifice ; and on the 13th of September, in the same year, the foundation-stone was laid by George Drummond, Esq. Grand Master of the Freemasons of Scotland. The contract not having been finally settled, the building was not commenced until the 13th of June, 1754. It was completed in 1761, at an expense of \u00a330,000."], [95, "Drawn by Tho H Shepherd EDINBURGH mple os the \"Muses, Fmsbury Square lotion Dra\u2122 T^ T1..H.

This principal part of the building forms what may be most properly called the Exchange, being that in which the chief business is transacted. Pillars and arches, forming a piazza, support a platform with balustrades, on the south front facing the court; and four Corinthian pillars rising from this platform, sustain a pediment, on which are the arms of the City of Edinburgh. The ground-floor under the piazza is laid out in shops, and the upper rooms ara approached by a hanging staircase ; these rooms are above twenty in number, chiefly occupied by the Board of Customs ; and some of them have lately been fitted up as offices and chambers for the Town Council. Two wings extend southward from the ends of this side of the building, which are carried forward 131 feet; and, measured from the outer front of the northern depart ment, will amount to 182 feet from north to south. A light colonnade forms the line of the southern side, above which is a platform with pilasters and vases ; the entry to the court is under the colonnade, through the central arch ; all the other arches are filled up with brick-work, and the enclosed spaces are occupied as shops. The court, surrounded by these buildings, measures 96 feet from north to south, including the piazza ; and 86 from east to west. It is somewhat remarkable, that although the north front is of hewn stone, of more than 100 feet square, there is not a rent or crack perceivable in any part of it. The south-west angle of the Exchange is occupied by the offices of the trustees for the improvement of the munufactures of Scotland, and of its fisheries. The money funded for these national purposes, is derived from the equivalent money paid by England on account of the Union ; and the interest of it is distributed in premiums to such as distinguish themselves, by discoveries, or improvements in useful arts ; or by introducing new and more advantageous manufacturing processes. It is a singular circumstance, that, with such superior accommodations as this spacious erection affords, the ancient custom of transacting business in the open street should yet continue. An effort was some time since made, to remove the meeting-place of the merchants into the more convenient and appropriate station of the court of the Exchange, but the attempt was unsuccessful. So difficult it is to overcome established prejudices, and confirmed habits. o"], [98, "EDINBURGH. 48 THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL. This magnificent structure, from its situation as well as its utility, is, perhaps, one of the greatest ornaments to the City of Edinburgh. It is built on the Calton Hill, at the north side of the Regent's Road, which forms one of the finest approaches to the City ; the solid rock being cut away, to make room for its erection. Our Engraving is taken from the Canongate Churchyard, that being the only situation whence the eye can include the whole range of Edinburgh at one view, the road in front being much too narrow to take in such an extensive building to advantage. The Calton Hill rising majestically behind, with Nelson's and the National Monuments on its summit, together with the old houses in the foreground, which are principally occupied as Foundries, form a pleasing contrast with this elegant structure. The ceremony of laying the first stone took place on the 28th of July, 1825, by Viscount Lord Glenorchy, Grand Master of the Masons in Scotland, attended by many Noblemen, Magistrates, and other Officers * of the City, in the presence of an immense multitude. The building is composed of a centre and two wings, together with two smaller buildings, or lodges : the centre is a portico of six columns of the Grecian Doric, to which the wings are joined by a colonnade of the same order : it contains five class-rooms, a common hall, library, writing-school, &c. and cost upwards of \u00a317,000, and was built from the design of Mr. Hamilton, architect : it is highly creditable to his taste, and well adapted to the purposes of this useful institution. CUSTOM-HOUSE, LEITH. This building, which is very capacious and extensive, and includes the Excise-office, was erected in 1812, and cost upwards of \u00a312,000. Commodious Docks, contiguous to it, and which the rapidly increasing trade of the port of Leith had long demanded, have been constructed, in which the shipping may float during any state ofthe tide. \" Various plans,\" says a recent writer on the subject, \" had been proposed at different times to effect this object, which at length induced the Magistrates and Council of Edinburgh to obtain an act of Parliament, in 1778, empowering them to borrow \u00a330,000 for the purpose of con structing a Basin, or Wet Dock, of seven English acres, above the dam of the Saw-mills at Leith ; a Lock at Sheriff-brae ; and a Canal of Communication between the Lock and Basin. This plan, however, was ultimately abandoned, and application was again made to Parliament, to empower the Magistrates to borrow \u00a3160,000,. to construct an extensive range of Docks, stretching from the North Pier of Leith to Newhaven, with an entrance at each of these places.\" \"The Eastern Wet Dock, next to the tide-harbour of Leith, was began in 1800, and completed in 1806; and the Middle Dock was finished about eight years afterwards.

A Lighthouse, with reflectory lamps, is erected at the mouth of the harbour; and another, with a revolving light, on the small island of IncKkeith, in the middle of the Frith of Forth, about four miles from Leith.\" THE CASTLE. Edinburgh Castle is a highly picturesque and interesting object, occupying the top of an eminence which rises 300 feet from the level of the sea. This fortress is inaccessible on all sides, except that from the town on the east : its lofty towers and massive walls are ingrafted into the solid rock, and enclose a space of more than six acres. The entrance is defended by iron palisades, bordering a broad and deep fosse, over which is a drawbridge ; and the gate to which it leads is defended by a battery on each side, mounting three or four guns. A half-moon, formed from a projection of the rock, mounts a battery of cannon, carrying balls of twelve pounds. Beyond these are two gate-ways ; the first of great strength, with two portcullises. Beyond the second gate-way, on the right, is a battery, mounting twelve and eighteen-pounders ; on the opposite side is a mortar, with some guns ; and in front is a half-moon battery, a chapel, a parade for exercise, and a number of houses forming a square, used as barracks for the officers. There are also extensive barracks for the accommodation of 1000 men ; a bomb-proof powder magazine ; the grand arsenal, of capacity to contain 8000 stand of arms ; with other apartments which would hold full 22,000 more : the whole convenience admitting of 30,000 stand of arms ; and additional barracks have been erected behind the governor's house. A nobleman is generally appointed governor, whose place is worth about \u00a31000 a year; and his deputy, who resides in the Castle, receives \u00a3500. The other officers are, a fort-major, master gunner, store-keeper, and chaplain. A company of invalids, generally accompanied by about 500 men, are left to defend the Castle. It is, however, capable of fully accommodating 1000, which number has some times been kept in it. This place is strongly fortified by nature ; yet, even previous to the invention of artillery, it was not found impregnable, much less could it withstand the attack of a modern army ; for no part of the building is bomb-proof, except the powder magazine. The history of this fortress cannot be traced to its origin, but recorded facts prove it to be of high antiquity. The widow of Malcolm Canmore died here in 1093, a few days after her husband was slain. The queen's body was conveyed through a postern gate on the western side, and buried in Dunfermline church; and her children escaped at the same time, whilst Donald Bane, ignorant of this secret passage, was besieging the opposite"], [104, "EDINBURGH. 50 side of the Castle. It is mentioned in a charter of David I. in 1128, and in 1174 it was surrendered to the English, as the price of the liberation of the Scottish king, William I. surnamed the Lion, who had been taken prisoner at Alnwick. On William's marriage with the cousin of King Henry, it was restored. The English held it in the time of Edward I. but it was recovered from them by Randolph, the nephew of Robert Bruce, in 1313. During this reign, it was destroyed by Bruce, to hinder the English from taking posses sion of it. It was rebuilt, and given up to Edward, by Baliol; but was soon after taken from the English by Sir William Ramsay. Falling again into their hands, it was regained by Sir William Douglas. Chancellor Crichton, in the reign of James IL, shut himself up in it, and defied the power of the king. In 1573, the brave Kirkaldy held the Castle for thirty-three days, against the united efforts of the English and Scottish forces, till the mutiny of his garrison obliged him to surrender. In the reign of James VI. it was held by the Earl of Morton, till a reconciliation with his sovereign took place. It was besieged by Cromwell in 1650, but held out two months, when it surrendered honourably. At the Revolution, it was held by the Duke of Gordon. for James II. It resisted the efforts of the rebels in 1715, and was vainly attempted to be taken from the royalists in 1745. THE INTERIOR QUADRANGLE OF THE CASTLE. This ancient building has sometimes been the palace, at other times the prison, of princes ; and is rendered interesting by its history being most intimately connected with that of the country. The Parliament-house was on the south side of the court, repre sented in the View ; the northern division was occupied by the royal gardens, the stables, and inferior offices ; and the great state-rooms were on the side towards the City, which is eastward. The following Inscription, in a room at the angle towards the south-east, points out the birth-place of King James the Sixth : \u2014 Lord Jesu Chryst, that crownit was with thornes, Preserve the birth quhais Badzie heir is borne ; And send her sonne successive to reign still, Lang in this realme, if that it be thy will.

We also learn, from the appearance of dates inscribed on the walls, that these apartments were repaired at different times, up to the year 1616. In the year 1707, the regalia of Scotland were deposited in a room in this part of the Castle ; but having never afterwards been exhibited, were reported to have been secretly conveyed to London ; which was generally believed, till the year 1818, during the regency of his present Majesty, when a commission was appointed, consisting of some of the"], [105, ""], [106, "Drawn by Tlo E Shepherd Engraved by T.

The sceptre is of hexagonal form, and double-gilt, the stem two feet, and the handle ten inches in length. The sword of state measures five feet, of which the handle and pommel of gilt-silver occupy fifteen inches ; the traverse is also of the same materials, and is seventeen inches and a half in length. There was also found an official rod, of silver, but it could not be ascertained for what particular purpose it was intended. A secret passage was found in one of the royal apartments, which is continued through the wall to the Grass-market in the City : the intended use of this passage is unknown ; and the current report, that it was contrived by Queen Mary, to convey secret intelligence to her Catholic friends during her imprisonment here, is by no means supported by historical evidence. The fatal cannon which caused the death of James II. at the siege of Roxburgh, used to lie near the inner gate of the Castle ; it was manufactured in Flanders, at a place called Mons, and on that account was called Mons Meg. This singular piece of ordnance is strengthened by numerous hoops of iron ; it is fourteen feet in length, its diameter two feet three inches and a half. The bore, calculated to receive a ball of only inferior magni tude at the breech, expands towards the apex, where its diameter is twenty inches. HOLYROOD PALACE. This is the only Royal Palace in Scotland, that has not fallen into ruins ; it is of ancient origin, probably having been first built soon after the Abbey of the same name, to which it lies contiguous, and which was erected by David the First, early in the twelfth century. A royal establishment has certainly existed here since the time of Robert Bruce, and it is recorded of James the Fifth, that in the spring of 1525 he built a \" fair Palace, with three towers, in the Abbey of Holyrood House.\" These three towers are yet seen, and are in the north-west part of the building, with the name of James inscribed upon them. The English having destroyed the ancient edifice, it was rebuilt, and remained a superb and extensive pile, consisting of five courts, till Cromwell's army again reduced it to ruins. Some time after the Restoration, the present erection was planned by Sir William Bruce, and built under the direction of Robert Mylne. It is a handsome and stately quadrangular building, enclosing a square of 230 feet in the inside, surrounded by P"], [108, "EDINBURGH. 52 piazza. The western front consists of two double towers, joined by a beautiful building of two stories ; above which, is a double balustrade. The gateway of the grand entrance is in the centre, and is decorated with double columns of the Doric order ; below the entablature of these appear the royal arms of Scotland ; and above a double balustrade, an octagonal turret rises, upon the top of whicli is placed an imperial crown. The double balustrades, and a flat roof, distinguish this from the other sides of the building ; which are also three stories in height. A pediment, enclosing the arms assumed by Scotland since the Union, is placed in the centre of the eastern side, opposite the grand entrance. On the south side, a large staircase conducts to the state-rooms ; and the great gallery on the north is 150 by 27J feet ; and decorated with Portraits of one hundred and eleven Scottish kings, painted by De Witt. The soldiers quartered here, after the defeat of the Royalists in 1745, greatly damaged and defaced these national paintings. During the French Revolution, two Princes, Counts Angouleme and Artois, resided here, and had mass performed in the gallery, till their departure in 1799. The Duke of Hamilton, as Hereditary Keeper of the Palace, possesses apartments here : in one of these, Queen Mary's bed, ornamented with crimson damask, bordered with green fringes, is yet seen, but in a very decayed state : there are also some chairs covered with crimson velvet. Strangers are also shown a portion of the wainscot, which, turning on hinges, communi cates with a secret passage leading to the rooms below. Lord Darnley, and the conspira tors, rushed in through this passage, to murder the unhappy Rizzio ; and large dark coloured spots on the floor, are said to have been occasioned by his blood. In a room assigned to Lord Dunmore, is a fine painting, by Vandyke, of Charles the First and his Queen in their hunting costume. Some rooms above the royal apartments are occupied by the Duke of Argyle, as heritable Master of the Household. The singular privilege of affording an asylum to insolvent debtors, is yet allowed to extend as far as the limits of the environs of the Castle, including within this sanctuary, a field called St. Anne's Yards, the extensive enclosure called the King's Park, the Duke's Walk, Arthur's Seat, Salisbury Craigs, and St. Leonard's Hill. HOUSE OF JOHN KNOX. This ancient building is in no respect to be admired on account of its architectural peculiarities, which, if they belong to any definable order or species, must be arranged with those which no person of taste or judgment can approve. A pulpit, in which is an effigy of the individual of whose fame this plain building has been made to participate, ornaments one of its angles, and this circumstance is of itself sufficient to excite a considerable degree of interest in the minds of those who are in any degree acquainted with the character and history of this celebrated reformer. Mr. John Knox was born in 1505, at Gifford, near Haddington, his ancestors, originally proprietors of the lands of Knock in Renfrew, derived their name from the family estate."], [109, "EDINBURGH. 53 The lands of Craigend afterwards came into their possession, and the castle of Ranfurly, belonging to that estate, was for a long time their place of residence. He received his education at the college of St. Andrews \u2014 took the degree of A.M. \u2014 and became a public teacher early in life, strictly conforming to the established Catholic church, till the new doctrines of Luther were introduced into Scotland by a Black friar, of the name of Guial liarn, by whose preaching, and the conversation of the famous Wishart, he was persuaded to renounce the ancient faith, and to become a zealous advocate for the Reformation. Being appointed tutor to the sons of the lairds of Ormistoun and Lang Niddery, and proceeding to instruct them in the principles of the Protestant religion, he was, on that account, subjected to a violent persecution, and obliged to seek shelter in the castle of St. Andrew's, from the rage of the Bishop of that diocese : in this retreat he was accompanied by his pupils. He had not long remained in this situation, before the castle was besieged by twenty-one French galleys, when it was taken, and Knox remained on board a galley two years. Regaining his liberty in 1549, and proceeding towards his native country, he procured a license to preach, and an appointment, first at Berwick, and afterwards at Newcastle. It is generally understood, that in 1552 he was made Chaplain to Edward the Sixth, and certainly known that he received an annual pension of \u00a340, and was offered the living of Allhallows, in London. This he rejected, because he could not conform to the English liturgy. On the accession of Mary of England, he retired to Geneva, and afterwards removing to Frankfort, preached to the English exiles ; who, requiring him to read the liturgy, he again went to Geneva, and in 1555 returned to his native country, to assist in promoting the Reformation, which had made considerable progress during his absence. On his return, he went from place to place, with zealous fervency exhorting the people ; and addressed a letter to the queen-regent, earnestly entreating her attention to the defence of Protestantism. In 1556, agreeably to the request of the Calvinists of Geneva, he returned to that city. Immediately on his departure from Scotland he received a summons ; and, on his non-appearance, was condemned to suffer death for heresy, and his effigy burnt at the cross in Edinburgh. He some time after this published his \" First Blast against the monstrous Regiment of Women,\" and returned to Scotland in 1559, resuming his labours in the great work of reformation with unceasing ardency and zeal. On Queen Mary's arrival from France, in 1561, the fatal contest commenced between that unfortunate princess and her Protestant subjects ; and it can neither be denied nor excused, that, on this occasion, Mr. Knox conducted himself toward his sovereign with an insulting and unauthorized freedom of speech, altogether unbecom ing his office as a Christian minister, his character as a respectable citizen, and, particu larly, as a subject of the sovereign whom he insulted. The violence of opposition between the contending parties drove him from Edinburgh in 1571, but he returned, and died there, in November, 1572, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Giles. Dr. Robertson has given a sketch of his character: \" Zeal, intrepidity, disinterestedness, were virtues which he possessed in an eminent degree. He was acquainted, too, with the learning"], [110, "54 EDINBURGH. cultivated in that age ; and excelled in that species of eloquence which is calculated to rouse and to inflame. His maxims, however, were too severe, and the impetuosity of his temper excessive. Rigid and uncomplying, he showed no indulgence to the infirmities of others. Regardless of the distinctions of rank and character, he uttered his admonitions with an acrimony and vehemence more apt to irritate than to reclaim ; and this often betrayed him into indecent expressions with respect to Queen Mary's person and conduct. Those very qualities, however, which now render his character less amiable, fitted him to be the instrument of Providence for advancing the Reformation among a fierce people ; and enabled him to face dangers, and to surmount opposition, from which a person of a more gentle spirit would have been apt to shrink back. By an unwearied application to study and business, as well as by the frequency and fervour of his public discourses, he had worn out a constitution naturally strong. During a lingering illness, he discovered the utmost fortitude, and met the approach of death with a magnanimity inseparable from his character. He was constantly employed in acts of devotion, and comforted himself with those prospects of immortality, which not only preserve good men from desponding, but fill them with exultation in their last moments. The Earl of Morton, who was present at his funeral, pronounced his eulogium in few words, the more honour able for Knox, as they came from one whom he had often censured with peculiar severity \u2014 \"Here lies he who never feared the face of man.\" THE REGISTER OFFICE. King Edward the First, thinking he had reduced Scotland to subjection, and wishing, if it had been possible, to destroy all remembrance of its name as a nation, abrogated its ancient laws \u2014 altered its religious worship \u2014 destroyed every historical record that fell into his hands \u2014 and carried away, into England, not only all the books and writings he could find, but the learned men, and the teachers of learning ; with the rude stone-chair of Scoone, which might serve to remind a degraded people of an ancient race of kings ; in tending not to leave a relic, by which a patriotic feeling might be awakened in generous minds. All the national records which had been collected, som Edward to Charles the First, were also seized by Cromwell, and sent to the Tower of London. Part of these were returned at the Restoration ; when one of the ships, in which they were deposited, was wrecked. These unfortunate occurrences have rendered the early part of the national history obscure and imperfect. In the year 1765, a representation was made by the lord register of Scotland, of the want of convenient apartments for the arrangement and preservation of the national records ; and a grant was obtained from the king, of \u00a312,000, out of the forfeited estates ; which, accumulating in interest till 1774, was appropriated to the building of this im portant public edifice, the foundation-stone of which was laid in that year, on the 27th of June, with the usual ceremonies, by Lord Frederick Campbell, lord register, Mr. Mont-"], [111, "1 I Ii\u2122 tj I7.o H Sh\u00abp_ \u2014 \u2014 ,- ._ . , 1 THE REGIS . ._ Er i :, 5 i __u Tiy Tho .

The undertaking was not completed till 1783, nine years after its commencement ; and though the records were then removed, yet some time previous, in the same year, the following remarks appeared in one of the public prints : \u2014 \" The public records of Scotland are kept in a dungeon, though a most magnificent building has been erected for their reception ; but hitherto it has been unfinished, and only occu pied by pigeons. Edinburgh may, indeed, boast of having the most magnificent pigeon house in Europe.\" This building, designed by Mr. Robert Adams, is considered to be the most beautiful work of that eminent architect. It is at the eastern extremity of Princes-street, and was originally proposed to form a square of 200 feet on each side ; but the present erection is only one half of it, consisting of one side, and half-sides forming two wings ; which, being abundantly sufficient for the intended purpose, leaves the probability of its future enlarge ment very questionable. The front of two hundred feet ranges from east to west, with a dome in the centre, fifty feet in diameter, and eighty feet high. The breadth of the building is one hundred and twenty feet. The dome is lighted by a window, with copper frame-work, fifteen feet in diameter, and encloses a statue of George the Third, by the honourable Mrs. Darner. In the middle of the front, four Corinthian pilasters support a pediment, which bears the arms of Great Britain on the tympanum. A turret at each end projects a little beyond the rest of the building, with an elegant Venetian window in front, and a cupola on the top, surrounded by a stone balustrade. A Corinthian entablature, of delicate workmanship, extends along the whole of the fronts. Q"], [114, "EDINBURGH. 56 THE GRASS MARKET, LOOKING WEST. The Grass Market is a spacious street, or rather oblong quadrangle of houses, lying immediately to the south of, and overlooked by, the Castle Hill. It is the western portion (if the southern of the two deep valleys, which diverge from the precipitous rock on which the castle is built; and, after separating to a considerable distance, again gradualry approach, and ultimately re-unite, at the Palace of Holyrood \u2014 including between them the High Street and its numerous Closes, which composed the whole of the more ancient part of the city. The Grass Market was known in former days, by the rather unclassical appellation of \"the Sheep Flechts.\" Its spacious area has long afforded a market-place for corn and cattle. It has lately, however, been shorn of half its glories \u2014 the sheep-market having been trans ferred to an area to the west of it, till then unknown to fame \u2014 the appropriation of it to the exchange of the \" woolly people\" being, as far as we know, the one great circumstance calculated to give it a name, whereby it may be known to future generations. Not so the Grass Market. Still celebrated as a place of bustle and of life \u2014 it was, at no distant period, renowned also as a place of death. It was the chosen site of the gallows, the former locality of which is still marked out by a peculiar arrangement of the pavement at its eastern extremity. Here was the place of martyrdom, of which Cuddie Headrig is described, in the Tales of my Landlord, to have entertained so peculiar a horror. Here, too, it was that Captain Porteous was sacrificed to the fury of the mob in 1736, \u2014 a circum stance which has led to the ample consecration, both of the street and of the event, in the pages of the Heart of Mid Lothian. On the north, the Grass Market communicates with the Castle Hill, by a kind of tube of houses, denominated the Castle Wynd. At the top of this tunnel, and reclining on the Steep slope of the Hill \u2014 hanging, like Mahomet's coffin, half way between heaven and earth, stands a small building, occupied until lately as a Gaelic chapel. For such a purpose its situation was peculiarly incommodious. To a lowlander, indeed, the penance implied in reaching it, either by the steep ascent from the Grass Market, or by the nearly plummet path from the top of the Hill, is far from being small. Before it was secularized, however, the church-going Highlanders were periodically seen bounding up or down to it, as the case might be, with the facility and alpine consequence of goats. To them, its situation in the fastnesses appeared to be a high recommendation. Opposite to the Castle Wynd, on the south side of the Grass Market, is a narrow and somewhat steep street, denominated Heriot's Bridge, which gives entrance to the grounds and to the front gateway of Heriot's Hospital, to be afterwards noticed. This entrance was, in former times, achieved by a structure, known, in the language of the day, by a name of a Bridge, which took its rise from the very middle of the Grass Market. It is described by Maitland to have been \"a very great nuisance;\" and he appears to have had"], [115, ": . \u2014 M\\ ' ==^- \u2022 Drawn VyTllo H Shepherd Engraved by J 3UB CASTHaB, F1ROK\u0152 Tfflffi!

But although the Bridge be entirely gone, the name remains, as the distinctive appellation of a street where no bridge is to be seen. It is this permanence of names, when the substances have perished, which sets antiquarians so often by the ears. The buildings in the Grass Market are in no way remarkable. The Corn Market situated at its western extremity, more distinguished by its internal dealings than its outward beauties is the only public edifice it contains, unless two \"wells\" for supply ing the inhabitants with water, can be regarded in that light. THE CASTLE FROM THE VENNEL. The Fennel is a steep and narrow street, connecting the western extremity of the Grass Market with the elevated ground formerly known by the name of High Riggs, to the south. The view of the Castle from this position is peculiarly striking. The rock, as seen from it, is high, and nearly perpendicular, \u2014 and the ancient part of the fortress appears rising from the very edge of the precipice, forming, as it were, an artificial and turreted prolongation of the rock itself. The modern buildings on the hill, known by the name of the New Barracks, which exhibit a style of architecture altogether incongruous with that of their veteran associate, and seem, in such a position, to solicit for themselves the appellation of Granaries, are fortunately but little seen from this point of view. By the abrupt termination of the High Street, in the Castle rock, all accessible direct communication by it with the country and suburbs to the south, has been hitherto entirely precluded. The \"George the Fourth's\" Bridge, however, now in the course of being constructed, will remedy the inconvenience which this circumstance has long occasioned. The foundation-stone of this structure was laid in the month of August, 1827. A bottle pf coins, the various newspapers of the day, and Lothian's Plan of Edinburgh, were entombed on the occasion, with all the solemn ceremonies used and observed in like cases. The only open work of the Bridge is a single arch, not yet completed, stretching from the Castle-rock, in a south-westerly direction, to the high ground to the south, spanning the street which winds round the base of the rock, the situation, in former days, of the \"King's stables,\" as the name which part of it still retains \u2014 although no hoof of the royal stud has left its impression there, for at least two centuries past. The communication between the arch and the High Street is formed by an elevated terrace, supported on the south by a strong inclined bulwark of"], [118, "EDINBURG I stones duly earthed and turfed, winding round the steep and romantic portion of tl rock, exhibited in the drawing. The approach to the City by this road will be peculiar grand. The towering precipice, holding up the ancient walls of the Castle on tl very extremity of its jutting cliffs, will form a parapet of no ordinary magnificence. EAST END OF BRIDEWEL Where multitudes of men are, Houses of Correction must needs be. It would seei that a House of this kind, situated in the immediate vicinity of the Holy Well i St. Bride, or Bridget, in Fleet Street, London, came gradually to usurp the name of tl Saint. The works done in the house began probably to outrival, in magnitude ar otherwise, the deeds performed, under the name of miracles, at the Well \u2014 a circun stance which might seem to shew that a holy influence had passed from the one to tl other, and that the Saint had been transferred from the water to the House of Coi rection. The house, at all events, came to be known by the appellation of Bridewell a name which has been extended pretty generally to houses of a similar description i other parts of the kingdom. The want of such a house seems to have been felt at a pretty early period in tl Scottish metropolis. \"Edinburgh,\" says Maitland, \"being become, as it were, tl common receptacle for strolling poor, lazy beggars, idle vagrants, and common pro titutes, who crowded hither from all parts of the kingdom, wherefore it was, in the ye 1632, judged necessary to erect a House of Correction, for employing and punishir these disorderly persons, and pests of mankind.\" The superintendence of such ; establishment being new to the then Provost and Bailies, the act of Council erectir and endowing it, narrates that these worthy persons, deeply impressed with their utt ignorance of the subject, \"had brocht hame ane certain strangeir expert therein, si trying for some Tyme, if thereby Vertew micht be advancit, Vyce 6uppressit and yd: people compellit to betake themselfis to sum Vertew and Industrie. The house intended to accomplish these great objects, was at first situated, as we ha' already had occasion to observe, in \"St. Paul's Work,\" at the foot of Leith Wynd. Aft an intermediate transfer, the present building was erected in the year 1791, under tl name of Bridewell. It is of what may be denominated the Bastile order of architectur and was designed by the late celebrated Robert Adam. The expense attending its erectii was defrayed by a county and city assessment, aided by a government grant of \u00a3500 The body of the building is of a semicircular form, and the walls are perforated with kind of loop-hole windows.

By a kind of Venetian screen-work, the tenants of each cage are prevented from seeing what is passing in the others \u2014 while all of them are overlooked, from the window of a dark apartment towards the centre of the curve, from which the governor, or his deputy, without being themselves very visible, can see at a glance what is doing in all parts of the house. The tread-mill has been lately introduced, and the old and more hardened offenders are now very effectually compelled to take steps, for supporting themselves in the establish ment. For ever climbing, without advancing in altitude, the labours of Sisyphus, and of the daughters of Danaus, are very painfully realized in their movements. So lar their occupation may be considered classical \u2014 \" Volvitur Ixion, et se sequiturque fugitque.\" But the wheel of Ixion does not appear to have been of the tread-mill description. The quality of the house-diet is inversely as the degree of labour \u2014 the highest labour commanding always the lowest fare. Great attention is paid to the cleanliness of the prisoners. When an entrant has passed through the required extent of ablution, and been thereby raised to the requisite degree of purity, an account is, in favourable cases, opened with him. Labour to a certain modified extent is required of him, the value of any surplus exertion being entered to his credit, and given to him on his departure. The moral and intellectual improvement of the inmates are not lost sight of. The house includes a chapel, in which service is regularly performed. \" The schoolmaster too is abroad\" in the establishment, \u2014 and the voice of the Shuttle and of the Pedagogue are frequently heard together. The plan of the house, unfortunately, does not admit of sufficient attention being paid to the proper classification of the prisoners. Visitors are admitted by orders from the magistrates, and are expected to leave a small donation, in aid of the funds. The general expenses of the establishment are defrayed by a county and city assessment.

NELSON'S MONUMENT, Is erected on a precipitous rock, on the Calton Hill. It terminates the view from Prince's Street to the east, and overlooks the new London-road, which winds round a splendid terrace on the hill, immediately below it. It is in the form of a tower, of considerable height, and including an attic within a castellated battlement. It rises from a broad expanded base, containing a number of rooms, originally intended to give accommo dation to a few disabled seamen.

The Column is surrounded by a small shrubbery. Over its doorway are the Nelson crest, and the stern of the San Josef.

The eating-rooms are appropriately furnished \u2014 and a Letter, in the hand-writing of Nelson, is among the number of their illustrative relics. ASSEMBLY ROOMS. The first Public Assemblies in Edinburgh were in the year 1710, and they remained under the management of private individuals till 1746, in which year, Messrs. Gavin Hamilton, and James Stirling, wishing to dignify this institution, by rendering it con tributary to the purposes of benevolence, as well as public amusement, called a meeting of gentlemen, who, after deliberating on the subject, adopted the following resolutions. First, that all things relating to the management of the assembly, (dancing excepted,) be under the direction of seven gentlemen, to meet occasionally to treat of the affairs of the institution. Second, that the management of dancing, and what relates thereto, be under the direction of seven directoresses, (ladies of distinction,) alternately to act by agreement among themselves ; and each lady, on her night of management, to be dis tinguished by a golden badge, whereon is engraven a Pelican feeding her young, with the motto, \"Charity;\" and on the reverse, the figure ofa woman, representing Charity leaning on a shield, charged with the arms of Edinburgh, and a Child reclining on her knee; the motto, \"Edinburgh!\" Mr. Hugh Clerk, on this occasion, agreed to discharge, gratuitously, the duties of treasurer. The Assembly-rooms occupy a building of considerable elegance, the front of which has recently been ornamented by an arcade and pediment. Among the internal con veniences, which are in a high degree elegant, and well suited to answer the purposes of the institution, is a Ball-room, 92 feet in length, in width 42, and in height 40 feet. On the ground-floor is the Supper-room, of the same length and breadth as the ball-room, but not rising to an equal height ; besides these, there are six rooms, each 18 feet square ; two halls, 32 by 18 feet, with convenient kitchen, and cellars of capacious dimensions. A Saloon, lighted by a cupola, whose diameter is 22 feet, with an ornamental screen of columns : a tea-room, two card-rooms, retiring-rooms, waiting-rooms, and the musician's apartments, occupy the remainder of the building, and at either end a covered way conducts to a spacious enclosure, for the reception of carriages and sedan-chairs. Maitland, the antiquarian, who wrote about the time of the commencement of these assemblies, remarks, that on these occasions, \" the beauty of the ladies, their address, and performances, are no where to be outdone ;\" and no one will be made to believe, that the Caledonian ladies of our time, are in any degree less amiable and attractive than their ancestors."], [123, ""], [124, "\u2022 __T MA2BIEI3 8 ,'ITAJL, ILAUmigTOFT __1E.

A great charitable endowment is frequently but a great post mortem act of repentance for an uncharitable life. It is often the last, and not the least, unjust deed of some incurable miser, who entails by it continued poverty on those whom nature called on him to provide for ; that he may, if possible, acquire, when dead, a reputation of which he was altogether unworthy while living. What is esteemed virtue, indeed, is too often but the growth of necessity ; and a charitable institution is, in many cases, but a fund fallen back upon the world from the dying and still covetous grasp of one who quits it, only because he lacks the power any longer to hold it ; and whom Charity herself in vain implores to bestow otherwise the wealth with which he profanes her name. The Merchant Maiden Hospital had its origin in different principles. It was founded in 1695, by the voluntary contribution of the living, and appropriated to the maintenance and education of the daughters of decayed merchant burgesses of Edinburgh. The chief contributor was Mrs. Mary Erskine, who purchased the original house and garden grounds near Bristo Part for \u00a312,000 Scots, and who farther enriched the Institution by a legacy at her death. The old building having become inconvenient, the present one was erected from a design by Mr. Burn, on a large vacant space of ground in the neigh bourhood of the Meadows on the south side of the City, entered by Launceston Lane. The foundation-stone was laid in the beginning of the year 1816, and the whole finished at an expense of about \u00a312,000. The building is of Grecian character, 180 feet long by about 60 in depth. It presents a circular projection behind, and a four-columned portico in front, taken from that of the Ionic temple on the Ilyssus. The windows of the basement story, which are partially hid by an artificial elevation of the ground in front, are arched, and by appearing to support a massy basement for the central portico and the lateral pilasters, relieve the whole building, giving to it an air of lightness which would otherwise have been incompatible with its extent. The basement story is occupied by the kitchen, washing-house, laundry, and their appendages. It contains also the dining-room for the girls. The principal floor, besides a school-room, 52 feet by 26, and other two, 42 feet by 25 each, contains a chapel, and a spacious room for the meeting of the Governors of the Institution. The second floor is occupied by the sleeping apartments, and includes separate hospital-rooms for the sick. The highest floor consists of a series of rooms extending the whole length ofthe building, used for drying clothes during the winter months. The number of girls in the establishment is generally about eighty. They are admitted between the ages of seven and eleven, and go out at seventeen. Besides needle-work, they are instructed in English, Arithmetic, Writing, French, and Geography. On quitting the house, each girl receives a valedictory donation of \u00a39. 6s. 8d. The revenue of the Hospital is about \u00a33,000 per annum."], [126, "EDINBURGH. 62 PHYSICIANS' HALL. The Royal College of Physicians was incorporated in 1681, by a charter of King Charles II., ratified by parliament in 1685. At the time of its institution, Edinburgh, according to Maitland, had become the prey of \" foreign impostors, quacks, empirics, and illiterate persons, both men and women, who, without the least knowledge of that learned science, audaciously presumed to practise as physicians, not only to the scandal of that noble art, but to the great danger and destruction of the health and lives of his Majesty's subjects.\" The extermination of these male and female characters was one great motive for the institution of the College. By its erection charter, the extent of ils jurisdiction is defined : and within the prescribed boundaries it is invested with the power of punishing by fine all who presume to practise without its leave. It is also empowered to authorise occasional circuits among the brethren of the Apothecary Craft, with a view to the periodical inspection of their drugs and medicines, and the solemn condemnation and casting forth into the streets of such as should be found bad and useless. To give them leisure to attend on their patients, the members of the College are exempted, by their charter, from sundry duties, which were, and still are, required of other loyal citizens : inter alia, they are relieved from serving on juries. The Hall, in which they meet to deliberate on the mysteries of their profession, and to legislate for the medical good of the community, was erected in 1775, on the south side of the eastern extremity of George's-street, immediately opposite to St. Andrew's church, and recedes a little from the street, on which the church encroaches. It is a handsome building of chaste Grecian architecture, and measures above 80 feet in length by above 60 in depth.

The angles of the nave are marked exter nally by four handsome octagonal embattled towers. The south wall, which fronts the street, is buttressed and adorned with a row of Gothic turrets, with crockets, connected with each other by a close embattlement. Above, and parallel to these, and marking the southern limit of the nave, is a range of similar turrets, united by open embattled work.

Ichabod may be written on its walls, for a great glory has departed from it. A lesser, however, remains.; and although laws are no longer manufactured, they are now retailed, within it, to all who have cash and courage enough to buy them. The original building, although intended for a national purpose, was erected at the sole expense of the inhabitants of Edinburgh. If the motive for this apparent liberality were not to be inquired into, the act might seem decidedly patriotic. But, alas for patriotism, when light is let in upon it ! \u2014 the hidden key to its mysteries is then gene rally discovered, and the secret and previously invisible mechanism, by which the ultimate movement, under the name of patriotism, is connected with the great wheel of self-interest, becomes detected and exposed. The inhabitants of Edinburgh erected the Parliament House from no abstract love of country. Far from it. They were threatened with a migration of the great Council, unless better accommodations were provided for its members ; and of two evils they chose what seemed to be the least ; a species of option, in many cases more shortly and conveniently expressed bythe word \"patriotism.\" The building was finished in 1640, at an expense of \u00a311,000. The National Conven tion, for whose meetings it was intended, was first known by the appellation of \" Parlia- S"], [130, "EDINBURGH. 64 ment\" in the reign of Robert I. The name was imported from England during the Bruce and Baliol competition. At that era the assembly consisted of the bishops, mitred abbots and priors, earls, lesser barons, and commons. In the reign of James I. the lesser barons were \" relieved\" from attendance in the great Council, and admitted to the \" pri vilege\" of electing a certain number of their body, as knights of the respective shires, to represent them. The duty of representation was considered very burdensome, and the electors were obliged to defray the expenses of their parliamentary apostles. How differently these matters are viewed now ! On the first and last days of the sitting of parliament was \" a very stately and pompous cavalcade,\" called \" the riding of the parliament.\" In the morning, the regalia, consisting of the crown, sword, and sceptre, were carried from the Castle to Holyrood House, and the members, having there mounted their horses, \" richly accoutred with velvet foot-cloths and sumptuous trappings,\" hied them solemnly to the scene of their deliberations. At the time of the Union, the parliament consisted of ten dukes, three marquisses, seventy-five earls, seventeen viscounts, fifty-two lords, ninety knights of shires, and sixty seven burgesses \u2014 in all three hundred and fourteen. Scotland is now represented in the British parliament by sixteen peers and forty-five commoners. The Drawing does not represent the Parliament House as it was, when really occupied as such. The older structure has been veneered and faced up, to suit the taste of modern times. It now affords accommodation to the different courts of justice. Of these the principal is the Court of Session, the supreme civil judicature of Scotland, which was originally held in the High Council House, or New Tolbooth, more popularly known by the name of the \" Heart of Mid Lothian.\" It was established by James V. in 1532, on the model of the parliament of Paris. As originally projected, it was composed, as it still is, of fifteen judges, entitled \" Lords.\" But the king had it then in his power to appoint at his pleasure any number of additional unsalaried judges, under the designation of \" Extraordinary Lords,\" to sit and vote with their salaried brethren, on particular occa sions. This power, which manifestly admitted of great abuse, was relinquished in the reign of George I. The court, as modelled by James, came in place of an ambulatory committee of parliament, including \" Lords of \" his Majesty's \" Council.\" The name of \" Lords of Council,\" originated by this circumstance, was retained when the judges ceased to have any pretension to so lofty a title. They are accordingly still designated \" Lords of Council and Session,\" as well as \" Senators of the College of Justice;\" an imposing and dignified appellation, bestowed on them at the erection of the court. The constitution of the court was ratified both by Parliament and by the Pope. Half the barons were pro moted to ecclesiastics. The Abbot of Cambuskenneth was the first president, and bore judicial sway over seven lay and an equal number of clerical judges. After the Reformation, the clergy were declared to be ineligible to the office. The parish minister of St. Cuth bert was the last who had the honour of a seat on the bench."], [131, "EDINBURGH. 65 The Scottish parliament, which, we have seen, had its \" riding\" days, does not seem to have monopolized the glories of horsemanship. On the contrary, the judges of the Court of Session were, at one time, not only allowed to have each his fiery Pegasus, but were expressly required, under pain of the royal displeasure, to proceed solemnly to court upon all occasions on richly caparisoned chargers; and that without any regard to the nature or extent of their attainments in equestrian science. It was enacted by Charles I. \"That no Lord of the Sessioun sail repair to Sessiounis-house at any tyme hereafter better accom panied than with his ordinair houshold servants, and that he come thither in a seamlie manner, on his horse, with a foot-cloath; and that under the pane of being censured as a contemnor of our auctoritie.\" Whether the judges as a body had found.it more difficult to preserve their uprightness on horseback than on the bench, does not precisely appear ; but certain it is that, for some cogent reason or other, they regarded with perfect horror the cavalry movement which had thus been imposed on them. So instant and clamorous had been their appeal for the requisite redress, that the \" riding act\" was very speedily abolished. To a stranger who has perambulated the spacious and magnificent streets of the modern city, the reason, or \" finding,\" on which the propriety of the abrogation is founded, must appear not a little curious. It affords an admirable picture of Edinburgh at the time. Glancing repeatedly at the \" riding\" order, the \" unhorsing\" act proceeds \u2014 \" Anent the article bearing that the Lords of Counsell and Sessioun sail repair to the Session-house in a seamlie manner on horse, with thair foote-clothis, findis that many of the Lordis of Sessioun hes thair duellingis verie near the Session-house, and some of thame duellis in narrow cloissis whair thair is not ane convenient passage for horse, and the calsay being dangerous to be redden upoun, it is thairfore not thocht convenient that they sail be tyed to this necessitie of ryding.\" Besides the Court of Session, the Parliament House gives accommodation to the Justiciary or Supreme Criminal Court of Scotland, and to the Jewry and Exchequer Courts. The building occupies the west and part of the south sides of the Parliament Close or Square. The north side is formed by the cathedral church of St. Giles. The east and remaining part of the south sides were until lately the situation of houses remarkable for their height, and for the terrible fires of which they have, at different periods, been the subjects. Those consumed in the conflagration of 1700, are said to have included fifteen floors. Their successors, which were consumed in the great fires of 1824, that threatened the entire destruction of the old city, wanted only a floor or two of this tremendous elevation. Buildings intended for the better accommodation of some of the courts are at present in course of being erected on their site. They are to be of the same description of architecture with the Parliament House, with which, indeed, they are to be united into one continuous semicircular range of building. As it now stands, the Parlia ment House is in the form of an oblong quadrant, with open arcades of plain Grecian architecture, surmounted by the figures of four sphynxes. The only part of it which remains in its original condition is the Great Hall, now denominated the \" Outer House,\""], [132, "66 EDINBURGH. in which, prior to the Union, the Scottish parliament held its sittings. It is above 120 feet long, and nearly 50 in breadth. Its roof is of oak, arched somewhat after the fashion of that of Westminster Hall, and elegantly finished. The floor and side-benches are ofthe same material. At its northern extremity is a statue of the late Lord Viscount Melville, executed by Chantrey, and erected in 1818. In the centre of the great south window, which is of stained glass, and in no way remarkable for the excellence of its proportions, is an emblematical representation of Justice, holding in her hand, not the poetical balance, but something like the patent steel-y*ard. She is very perilously poised on an inverted pyramid, and withal so distressingly placed, that, had the artist not been a Scotchman, it might have been supposed that he intended, figuratively, to insinuate that the goddess had no very safe or desirable footing in the court below. It was in the Hall we are describing that the city banquet was given to his present Majesty, on the occasion of his visit to Edinburgh in the year 1822. Through its eastern wall is the entrance to the first, and immediately opposite to it, in the western wall, that to the second division of the Court of Session. The room occupied by the first division was in former days the Privy Council Room. Prior to 1808, it was the chamber in which the undivided court of fifteen judges daily assembled. Immediately behind the president's chair is a statue of the late Lord President Blair, by Chantrey, erected in 1818. The Court Room of the second division was built in 1808. Behind the bench, in a niche in the wall, is a beautiful statue of Lord President Farlus, by Roubiliac, transferred from the Outer House, where it was erected at the expense of the Faculty of Advocates. Underneath the Outer House is the older part of the Advocate's Library, to be after wards noticed. In Maitland's time, the contents of this lower apartment were of a more miscellaneous, if not more interesting description. Thc-y-e; says he, during the summer months, are deposited \" the public lamps belonging to the city, consisting of one hundred in number; the public theatre or stage, which is occasionally erected at the market cross, to accommodate the magistrates on all public rejoicings ; the machine, denominated the Maiden, for decollating state criminals ; and the common gallows, which is occasionally erected in the grass market.\" ABBOTSFORD, THE SEAT OF SIR WALTER SCOTT, BART. Abbotsford is situated on a rising ground, overhanging the bank of the Tweed, about three miles to the west of Melrose, and at an equal distance from Selkirk. It is approached by a very short avenue from the road, by which it is overlooked. It is surrounded by young but thriving plantations, not laid out by a tasteless ancestor, but grown \" to order\" of the present occupant. These are traversed in all directions by broad riding ways, commanding, at different points, the most picturesque views. The ravines by which the property is intersected are rich in waterfalls, which, here and there, send murmurs into the wild-wood that might turn the thoughts, even of the dullest rogue, to poetry.

A stranger finds it difficult to believe that all which so enchants him is the work of one, and that a still living man. And yet, twenty years ago, there was no promise of the existing beauties of Abbotsford. A little farm, \" Oustead,\" ycleped \" Cartley Hall,\" surrounded by comparatively bare and unwooded sheep-pasture, was all that then addressed the eye, where there is, now, so much of the freshness and the glory of woodland. Disowned by all \" the orders,\" the mansion house of Abbotsford is a heresy in building. It is an order by itself; the first, and destined probably to be the last, of its race. It is entirely a creature of the Poet's own fancy. Built piecemeal \u2014 by cantos as it were \u2014 and without regularity of design, it seems like a building in a state of unequal vegetation. Had any other than Sir Walter Scott been the designer, criticism might have lifted up her porcupine's quill against it, and written down some of its singular com binations and proportions as whimsical or grotesque. The Hall of the Mansion-house is a most picturesque apartment. Its walls are panelled with curiously carved and dark oak, obtained from one of the royal palaces. The roof presents a series of pointed arches of the same material, and exhibits sixteen shields of arms, richly blazoned, containing the heraldic history of the Poet's family. The floor of the hall is lozenged with black and white marble, and its contents, in curious suits of armour, cuirasses of all shades and dimensions, helmets, lances, swords, rapiers, stirrups, spurs, et hoc genus omne, transcend all ready computation. Almost every article, however, is connected with some appropriate legend, which gives it an interesting and important individuality. An adjoining apartment, which extends quite across the house, lighted by a -window at each extremity, contains a similar but more valuable collection of rarities. Among these are Rob Roy's gun, duly initiated ; Hofer's blunderbuss, the gift of the late Sir Humphry Davy to the Poet; a magnificent sword, presented by King Charles I. to the famous Montrose ; and a pair of pistols, once the property of Buonaparte. Here too is a collection of the ancient Scottish instruments of torture, including the identical \" thum bikins\" applied to Cardinal Carstairs, and the \" iron crown,\" by which Wishart, the martyr, was restained from giving voice to his agony at the stake. The dining and drawing rooms, both very elegant apartments, are amply stored with pictures of various interest and value. Inter alia is the head of Queen Mary in a charger, painted by Amias Conrood, the day after the tragedy of Fotheringay, and presented some time ago to Sir Walter by a Prussian nobleman, in whose possession it had all along been. In the same room is a portrait of the Poet's great-grandfather, the same who allowed his beard to grow whithersoever it would, after the execution of Charles I. in perpetuam memoriam of that bloody event. In the portrait, this somewhat singular testimony of the old cavalier's attachment to the person of his royal master, is represented as having attained to a very imposing longitude. T"], [136, "EDINBURGH. 68 Ir. a beautiful breakfast parlour, copiously furnished with poetry and romance, is a painting of Fast Castle, by Thomson, the supposed Wolf's Crag ofthe Bride of Lammer maar. A portrait of Dryden, by Sir Peter Lely, appears among many others in the drawing room. Of the Library we might discourse through many pages; but here we can give but a glimpse of its multiplied glories. It is a splendid apartment of very ample dimensions. The roof is of richly carved oak, of a Melrose pattern, we believe. The bookcases, which are of the same material, contain a collection of great extent and value. It includes a magnificent set of Mountfaucon in folio, a present to Sir Walter from his Majesty George IV. It contains also presentation copies of the works of all the most celebrated living authors, inscribed to him in many languages. A curious collection of books, papers, and manuscripts, relating to the two rebellions, and another of treatises on the black art, are deposited in a wired and locked department of the shelving. In a corner of the room, supported on a beautiful stand, appears the rich but gloomy present of Lord Byron \u2014 a silver urn, filled with human bones from the Pir\u00e6us. A bust of Shak speare, and a portrait by Allan, of Sir Walter's son, are also among the notabilia of the apartment. Beyond, and communicating with the Library, is the Sanctum sanctorum \u2014 the very presence-chamber of the Muses. It is clearly a desobligeant among apartments. Its sitting establishment is generally limited to two chairs ; one, we presume, is for the magician himself, and the other, for the inspiring genius, if it should happen that she should at any time be condescending enough to put on the veil of humanity, and come into the presence of her \" childe.\" But we must desist from an attempt to describe what must be seen to be duly appre ciated. The Mansion of Abbotsford, without and within, is altogether sui generis. Any account, either of it, or of its inmate, must fall far short of the reality. The subject, however, is an inspiring one, and our readers, we are persuaded, will forgive us for breaking a little from the usual jog-trot of our architectural paces, to endeavour to give them some idea of a place destined to enduring fame."], [137, "EDINBURGH. 69 MELROSE ABBEY. This exquisitely beautiful ruin, which lingers, like a creation of some distant enchantment, in a land of things that claim no kindred with it now, is one of the most perfect of the many magnificent edifices that fell sacrifices to the fury of the Reformers. Melrose Abbey was one of the many splendid erections of David I. It was built in 1136, dedicated to St. Mary, and appropriated to the use of a body of Cistercian monks. The Church \u2014 the only part of the building which remains \u2014 is nearly 290 feet in length, by about 160 in its greatest breadth. Decay has been most busy with the western part of it. On its eastern walls time \" hath leant his hand, but broke his scythe.\" Its beauty seems to have awed its spoiler. The oriel window, and that above the south entrance, are nearly entire, and perfect in beauty \u2014 and their \" slender shafts of shapely stone\" are so gracefully and airily enwreathed, that, in our moonlight imaginings, we might almost think \" Some fairy's hand 'Twixt poplars straight the osier wand, In many a freakish knot hath twined ; Then framed a spell, where the work was done, And changed the willow-wreathes to stone.\" Some of the light and lofty pillars, which once held up a noble roof over the sculptured magnificence of the rich interior, still remain ; and though the stately solemnities of a pompous worship have long been unknown in the place, and they who worshipped have been mingled for centuries with the dust, time has given to the grey ruin \"a spirit's feeling,\" which the unbroken walls possessed not, and to the crannying wind a far more glorious and hallowing music than ever pealed through the lofty aisles of the fabric in the days of its unruined pride. It would be vain to attempt to enumerate the particular beauties of \"fair Melrose.\" He only can understand and feel them, who has read them in the scroll of ruin, by the pale light of the moon, ' When the broken arches are dark in night, And each shafted oriel glimmers white ; When the cold light's uncertain shower Streams on the ruin'd central tower ; When buttress and buttress, alternately, Seem framed of ebon aDd ivory.\""], [138, "EDINBURGH. 70 HERIOT'S HOSPITAL, FROM THE CASTLE HILL. This beautiful structure stands on a rising ground, immediately south of and over lookino* the Grass-market. The person whose name it bears, was the son of a gold smith in Edinburgh, and himself afterwards jeweller; first to the Queen of James VI. and thereafter to his Majesty himself. As a citizen of Edinburgh, he seems to have been held in considerable esteem. The honours of Deacon of the Incorporation of Goldsmiths were more than once conferred upon him. On the accession of King James to the throne of England, Heriot migrated to London, and there, under the patronage of his royal master, speedily realized a considerable fortune. In the year 1623 he made a settlement of his affairs, by which, after leaving a great variety of legacies to his friends, and acquit ting a number of his debtors of his claims against them, he bequeathed the free residue of his property to the magistrates and ministers of Edinburgh, for the endowment of an Hospital for the \" maintenance, relief, and bringing up,\" of poor and fatherless boys, freemen's sons of the town. Doctor Balcauquel, Dean of Rochester, was one of the three trustees appointed to see the settlement carried into effect. He had a particular charge of the Hospital department of the trust, being specially appointed to go per sonally to Edinburgh to confer with the magistrates and ministers on the subject, and to take all necessary steps for having the charitable intentions of his friend carried into full effect. Heriot died in 1624, and in 1628 the building of the Hospital was commenced. Its progress, however, was for some time interrupted by the civil war. After a considerable interval, operations were resumed upon it in 1642, and continued till 1650, when Crom well took possession of it as an hospital for his sick and wounded soldiers. It continued in this kind of occupation for about eight years, when General Monk, on the earnest request* of the governors, agreed on certain conditions to evacuate it. In the year 1659 it was opened for the purposes of the charity, 30 boys being then admitted into it. It was not, however, till the year 1660, that the building was fully completed. It was understood to have cost, in all, the sum of \u00a327,000 ; a fact which seems to have raised the indignation of Maitland in no ordinary degree. \" By their imprudent and unjusti fiable conduct,\" says he, alluding to Heriot's trustees, \"they erected a fabric so sump tuous, at the expense of twenty years' labour, and above \u00a327,000 sterling, charge, that it probably excelled every structure of its kind then upon earth, and was a work fitter for the ancient Romans, than the petty feoffees in trust for so small a fund ; and more proper for the residence of a great king, than the habitation of a few poor and needy orphans : for till this time the vanity of man was not got to such a height of extrava gance as to erect palaces for beggars.\" The framing of the statutes and regulations of the charity was confided by Heriot to his friend Doctor Balcauquel ; and the Doctor, in the execution of this task, seems to"], [139, "Draw., by Tl.o H Shepherd Engraved by W Tombleson. teus i&tonws \u00a9f xt.@>:uir - u@<s>m cihafeil, E D I N B i: I; i il Jbnes.cr.

The included court is a square of 94 feet. The plan was furnished by Doctor Balcauquel, and is understood to have been designed by Inigo Jones. The Doctor is said to have presided over the design, so far as to require that no two windows of the house should exhibit the same kind of ornament; and the architect seems to have taxed his ingenuity, so to comply with the injunction of his employer, as to make the required differences as little observable as possible. Over the gateway which looks to the north is a spire and clock, and the corners of the building are ornamented with turrets. The south side includes an elegant Chapel, 61 feet long by 22 in breadth. In a niche on the north side, and looking into the court, is a statue of Heriot, of whom there is also a portrait in the council-room. The grounds around the house have recently been much improved, and a porter's lodge erected, in a style of architecture to correspond with that of the Hospital itself. RUINS OF HOLYROOD CHAPEL. This Chapel was originally a magnificent structure of the English or pointed style of architecture. Its west front has been compared with Melrose Abbey, Ely, and York Cathedrals. The highly enriched windows which lighted the rood-loft are universally admired. The columns, mouldings, and sculptures of the west door, are executed in the boldest style of alto-relievo, and exhibit various grotesque devices, the whole elegantly designed and executed. Immediately above the door is a small square stone, having this inscription : \" He shall build ane house for my name, and I will stablish his throne for ever.\" The north side of the building is ornamented with buttresses, enriched with canopied niches and pinnacles ; this was the work of Abbot Crauford, in the time of James HI. The south side of the church is likewise adorned with buttresses, but differing from those of the north. At the east end is the great window, the tracery of which was thrown down by a storm in 1795, but has since been replaced. The belfry is a small tower on the north-west corner of the Abbey church, and contains a finely executed statue of Lord Belhaven. On the compartments behind are various Latin inscriptions. IT"], [142, "EDINBURGH. 72 THE THEATRE. This building, which presents a very plain appearance, when contrasted with the other public edifices of the city, is situated at the north end of the north bridge, nearly opposite to the Register Office. On the centre of the north front, over the principal entrance, is a statue of Shakspeare, supported at each extremity by the Tragic and Comic Muse. Though the outside, however, presents no prepossessing appearance, the inside of the house is elegantly fitted up. This building was opened for exhibi tions in December, 1769. The prices of admission at that time were three shillings for the boxes and pit, two shillings for the first gallery, and one shilling for the second or upper gallery. The house at these prices could hold with ease about \u00a3140. The box-seats were afterwards raised to four shillings, and subsequently in 1815 to five shillings ; but the prices of the seats in the other parts of the house still remain at the old rate. The patent for the Theatre is in the name of trustees as formerly, and was acquired by the late Mr. Henry Siddons, in 1809. ST. JOHN'S CHAPEL, ST. CUTHBERT'S CHURCH, &c. St. John's is a beautiful Episcopalian Chapel, situated at the western extremity of Prince's-street. It was founded in 1816, and finished in 1818, at an expense of about \u00a315,000. It was designed by Mr. William Burn, and exhibits a specimen of the florid description of Gothic architecture. It is 1 13 feet in length, by 62 in breadth. On the west it is terminated by a slightly projecting and elegant tower, 120 feet in height, surmounted by turrets. Through this tower is the principal entrance, by a beautifully arched Gothic door. The north and south walls of the Chapel are richly buttressed, and are terminated by a cornice and battlement; each of the compartments between the buttresses, with the exception of the two eastmost, being occupied by a window. The inner walls, which are divided and ornamented in a similar manner with the outer ones, are terminated by rows of small Gothic turrets. The windows between the but tresses in them are of stained glass. The great eastern window, which is 30 feet in height, is of Birmingham construction. Below the Chapel on the south side is a range of arched burial vaults, and there is a cemetery on the east of it. The Chapel has no gallery, and the roof is supported by two rows of light and elegant Gothic columns. A little to the south of St. John's Chapel, which occupies the fore-ground of the plate, is St. Cuthbert's, or the West Church ; the parish church of the most populous"], [143, "Drawn \"by The . H.

It was built about 40 years ago, on the same spot which had been occupied, for centuries before, by the former church of the same name. CATHOLIC CHAPEL. This small Chapel is situated in Braughton- street, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Caledonian theatre. It was built in 1813, from a design by Mr. Gillespie. Much of the architectural ornament, however, exhibited on Mr. Gillespie's plan was dispensed with, on account of the insufficiency of the building fund. As it stands, the Chapel cost \u00a38,000. In consequence of its proximity to the surrounding buildings, the eastern front is the only portion of it which comes prominently into view. It is ornamented with two central pinnacles, 70 feet in height. The Chapel possesses a fine organ, and above the altar is a beautiful painting of a Dead Saviour, by Vandyke, presented to the Chapel by the Daughter of Sir George Chalmers. Within the walls, the Chapel is 110 feet in length, by 57 in breadth. VEGETABLE AND FISH MARKET. The Gallery of the Rainbow Coffee House afforded to our artist an opportunity of presenting a truly picturesque view of the above Market, which is held under the arches of the North Bridge. It is surrounded by covered stalls, principally occupied by venders of salmon, trout, &c. The fish-women from Newhaven and Fisher-row, here assemble, and form rows in the centre of the Market, and a scene of bustle and activity prevails during the busy time, which is highly amusing to the passing stranger. The Vegetable and Fruit Markets occupy a part of the same area, and supply all the varieties of the season in great abundance. The quantity of gooseberries and strawberies sold during the short period these fruits are in season, is particularly great; the latter being estimated at upwards of 100,000 Scottish, or 400,000 English pints. THE NEW OBSERVATORY, CALTON HILL, was founded in 1818, by Sir George Mackenzie, Vice-President, in the absence of Professor Playfair, from a design by W. H. Playfair, Esq. The building presents the form of a cross of sixty-two feet, with four projecting pediments of twenty-eight feet each, sup ported by six Doric columns, fronting the four points of the compass ; a dome, thirteen feet in diameter, forms the centre of the building, under which is a conical pillar of solid masonry, six feet in diameter at the base, and nineteen feet in height, intended for the astronomical circle ; to the east, piers are formed for the transit instrument and astro nomical clock ; with others in the western end, for the mural circle and clock ; the whole"], [152, "EDINBURGH. 74 being founded on the solid rock : for the accommodation of the observer, is a small gallery, encircling the central pillar, and in the northern side of the building is a room constructed for the same purpose. BANK OF SCOTLAND. This building was designed by the late Mr. Richard Crighton, and presents on its south front rather an elegant object. The situation is at the head of the eastern mound, the dead wall on the northern side, where the declivity is greatest, being covered by a stone screen or curtain, with a balustrade. The basement in front is rusticated, and a range of Corinthian pilasters decorate the second story. There are four projections to this front; and over the door, in the recess formed in the centre, is a Venetian window, ornamented with two Corinthian columns, surmounted with the arms of the Bank. NEW COUNTY HALL, AND ADVOCATE'S LIBRARY. The former of these buildings, in which are held the County Meetings, stands at the western extremity of the New Library Rooms of the Advocates, and writers to the signet, and is nearly a copy of that fine specimen of antiquity, the temple of Erychtheus in the Acropolis of Athens. Sir William Rae, when sheriff of the county, was so taken with a model of the original which he saw at Paris, that he recommended it urgently to the commissioners ; and Mr. Archibald Elliot, the architect, who, prior to this, had furnished a design in the Doric, having investigated the fragments among the Elgin marbles, pro ceeded to carry the object into effect ; in which he adhered strictly to the proportions and such parts of the original temple, as was consistent with a modern building designed for a wholly different purpose. In front of the principal entrance to the building, four large fluted Ionic columns sup port a pediment ; and two similar ones ornament the north end, fronting the Lawn Market. The length of the eastern front is rather more than 102 feet, and the northern about 57. The principal floor of the interior comprises a Hall, 50 by 27 feet, a Court room, 44 feet by 30, a Committee-room, &c; in the other floors are various offices relating to the business of the Sheriff. The building was commenced in 1816, and completed in 1819, at a total expense of \u00a315,000. In the Hall, a fine statue of the Lord Chief Baron Dundas, executed by Chantry, and considered inferior to none of the productions of that celebrated sculptor, has been recently erected. The Advocate's Library extends along the range of buildings, forming the southern side of the square, composed by the County Hall and St. Giles's Church ; it is divided into two distinct departments, one of which, comprising nine apartments, is under the Parliament House, with which it communicates.

The books, which include many of great value and rarity, as well as manuscripts, range in presses between and behind the pillars, and a gallery, at the height of 20 feet, extends along the whole : all the furniture is most splendid, and \u00a312,000 is stated to have been the cost of this room alone. MORAY PLACE, AND AINSLIE PLACE. Moray Place is built in the form of a polygon. Its houses are of a very splendid character, and embrace every description of domestic accommodation. By Great Stuart street it communicates, on the west, with Ainslie-place, built in the form of an ellipsis, the northern part of which we have delineated. To the west, this ellipse communicates with Randolph Crescent, which it divides into two quadrants. These, with a variety of streets opening into them in different directions, have all been recently built on ground belonging to the Earl of Moray. The designs, which were furnished by Mr. Gillespie, architect, are eminently beautiful ; and the splen dour and great accommodation of the houses, aided, perhaps, by the aristocratical distinc tion of the ground on which they have been erected, have procured for them a very distinguished population. THE ROYAL CIRCUS. The Royal Circus, designed by Mr. Playfair, is built in the form of a double crescent, or circle of houses. From the great inequality of the ground on which it is erected, the southern crescent stands much higher than the northern. This, which in other circum stances might have appeared a blemish, cannot be so considered in the present instance. It enhances the singular and picturesque grouping of the elegant streets which lead and look into the circus, and harmonizes so well with their variety, both in architecture and situation, as to make the blemish \u2014 if it must be so called \u2014 which it attaches to one of a multitude of objects, essential to the general beauty of the whole. In the immediate neighbourhood of the circus is situated, THE NEW EDINBURGH ACADEMY. This building was erected by subscription. A number of gentlemen, chiefly resident in the New Town, impressed with the inconvenience of the thin locality of the High School, and withal, perhaps, desiring to have their children separated from those of more X"], [160, "EDINBURGH. 76 plebeian extraction, resolved to have a new academy, the management of which should be under their own absolute control. The requisite materiel was soon provided, and the resolution carried into full effect. The building is situated at the northern extremity of the New Town. It was designed by Mr. William Burn, and cost above \u00a312,000. Exte riority it is a handsome structure, illustrated by a beautiful portico, supported by Grecian Doric columns ; and its interior arrangements are, in every respect, well adapted to the purposes intended to be served by it. The institution is superintended by a board of directors. Its teaching establishment, besides a rector and four masters, as in the case of the High School, includes an English and a French master, and a teacher of writing and arithmetic. The class fees are considerably higher than those of the rival institution, and the children of subscribers have a preferable right of admission to it \u2014 two circumstances materially contributing to secure a select body of disciples. THE NEW JOHN WATSON'S HOSPITAL. This charity originated in a bequest, in 1759, hy Mr. John Watson, writer to the signet, of the reversion of his fortune, for the endowment of a foundling hospital. Under the management of the office-bearers of the society of writers to the signet, the reversion thus bequeathed \u2014 originally a comparatively small sum \u2014 had accumulated, a few years since, to nearly \u00a3100,000. It was then thought time to apply the money to some such charitable purpose as Mr. Watson had contemplated. The expediency of a foundling hospital, to which it had been destined, having been considered as, at least, problematical \u2014 an act of parliament was applied for and obtained, authorizing the fund to be applied in the endowment of a hospital for the maintenance and education of destitute children. The branches of education taught in the institution are English, arithmetic, and writing. The building, which was designed by Mr. William Burn, is of Grecian architecture, and is adorned with an elegant hexastyle portico, supported by Grecian Doric fluted columns. STOCK-BRIDGE, WATER OF LEITH. The view here given is taken from a point a little below St. Bernard's Well. The bridge represented on the drawing, and another at a short distance beyond it, connect Edinburgh proper with its north-west suburb of Stock -bridge. Within these few years that suburb has received a great accession of elegant streets, erected on the property of the late Sir Henry Raeburn, the portrait painter. The little \" New Town,\" which has thus been originated, is separated from its greater neighbour by the wooded ravine through which the Water of Leith works its noisy way, when it has water enough to supply a heavy lead-mill, and a surplus to be less profitably, but more poetically, employed in tum bling over the rocks of its often dried-up channel."], [161, "THE EJEW EBIIJBWIIMJTE AC 3 [rrawn by Tho.

The inhabitants owe its existence, for such a puspose, entirely to the enterprising spirit of a single individual \u2014 Captain Carnegie ; and its elegance and admirable adaptation to its object, to Mr. Archibald Scott, architect. It is well worthy of a visit. ST. BERNARD'S WELL. This is a circular structure, in the form of a kind of open temple, supported by ten pillars over a now mutilated statue of Hygeia, the goddess of health. It was erected by Lord Gardenstone, in the year 1790, in grateful remembrance of the benefit received by him from drinking of the mineral spring which it encloses. The water of the spring is of the sulphureous order, and of excellent medicinal quality. Its virtue, however, does not now attract so many worshippers to the temple as it was wont to do. The novelty of the thing \u2014 no insignificant element in the wonder-workings of all mineral waters \u2014 has passed away ; and the miraculous properties of the beverage are now, therefore, less observed. The well overhangs the Water of Leith, and has its foundation in the very bed of the river. The situation is romantic ; and when the river is full, and sweeping on over the shelving rocks, which here give it a rough and noisy welcome, the scene is truly beautiful. Its freshness is of more avail to the valetudinarian, of healthful mind, than a hecatomb of his tumblers of \" sulphur and water,\" to the hoar hypochondriacal pilgrim of Hygeia, who can hurry along the woody banks of the brawling stream merely to go down into the well to drink. A few hundred yards up the river a very splendid bridge is in the course of erection, to connect its opposite banks. It is entirely the work of a few spirited individuals, who look for remuneration in the expected extension of the town in that direction. The bridge is from a design by Mr. Telford. It is to consist of four arches \u2014 the arches supporting the foot-pavements being distinct from and flatter than the arch ofthe road-way. The parapet wall of the middle arch is to be one hundred feet above the bed of the river. The views from it will be strikingly picturesque. REGENT MURRAY'S HOUSE, GARDEN, &c. On the south side of the street, in the Cannongate, stands the ancient mansion, once the residence of James Stewart, prior of St. Andrew's, who was, in 1561, created Earl of Murray, by Queen Mary, and who became a very conspicuous character towards the latter part of her turbulent reign. The Queen, considering him as a leader and head of the Reformers, allowed him to hold a high rank in public affairs, and found it convenient to consult him very frequently in matters of doubt and difficulty. On the Queen's arrival at Edinburgh, in 1567, covered with disgrace on account of the murder of Darnley, she resigned the crown, and the Earl of Murray was appointed regent."], [168, "EDINBURGH. 78 His attachment to the cause of the Reformation produced him many enemies, and per haps led to his base murder, three years after he had been appointed to that high office, by one of the family of Hamilton. Historians have represented his character in the most favourable light. One designates him as the \" good regent,\" and another says, \" above all his virtues, which were not a few, he shined in piety towards God.\" The mansion, which is the subject of our Engraving, was some time ago used as a linen hall, but is at present chiefly occupied by Mr. Ballantine, the celebrated printer ; it has several splendid apartments, and behind is a spacious garden, with a very curious bower in the south-west corner of the highest parterre and immediately behind the house, formed of several old and picturesque elm stumps, whose branches have met, and are completely incorporated together. This, tradition states, was a favourite spot with Queen Mary, and where she would very frequently sit, to contemplate and read. In an old building, now converted into a summer-house, on the east side of the lowermost level of the garden, the Act of Union of the two kingdoms is said to have been signed; and in another part of the garden, adjacent to what was originally used as the Regent's levee room, is a beautiful and very remarkable thorn tree, supposed to have been planted by the Queen herself. Evident vestiges of former grandeur may still be traced in the garden and back parts of the premises. RUINS OF ST. ANTHONY'S CHAPEL. This picturesque ruin stands on an elevated station, about a quarter of a mile from the Palace of Holyrood and on the north side of Arthur's Seat ; commanding a view over Leith, the frith of Forth, and the county of Fife. This situation appears to have been chosen, with an intention of attracting the notice of seamen coming up that frith ; who, in cases of danger, might be induced to make vows to its tutelar saint. The Chapel was originally a beautiful Gothic building, forty-three feet long, eighteen broad, and eighteen in height. At the west-end was a tower, nineteen feet square, and, as is supposed, before its fall, about forty feet high ; the doors, windows, and roof were Gothic, the last consisting of three compartments. A handsome stone seat projected from the eastern side, but the whole has become greatly dilapidated. By whom, or at what time, this Chapel was built, is not known. METHODIST CHAPEL. This elegant structure, erected in 1814, stands in Nicholson's Square, and is about 80 feet in length by 60 wide. The cost, including the Minister's House and Schools attached, is estimated at upwards of \u00a35000. The situation combines a number of objects, all calculated to set off the building to advantage, and to render the general effect pictu resque and pleasing; such as the shrubberies ofthe adjacent gardens, the square, with its plantations, enclosure, &c."], [169, ";!IER-ffl\u00a9irj\u00a7E IK KECEHT JSUI&RAT'S GAMSEN, WEIEHE THE UHIOFT '\u00a9 HII?<SB@M\u00a7 WAS SIGM .Drawn, by Xto Tf.Sbephera.

The style of the building is Gothic, of an oblong form, and the architect employed was Mr. Burn. It has three projections in front, and the whole of the angles are orna mented with turrets. The centre projection is elevated above the rest of the building, and the effect of the whole is very elegant : \u2014 a short distance from the Hospital is the School-house, a neat and commodious erection. On the site of this Hospital formerly stood a very ancient castellated building, called Wryte's House. TRADE'S MAIDEN HOSPITAL. The Corporations of Edinburgh, excited by the good example of the Company of Merchants, became desirous to establish, for the daughters of their decayed members, an institution similar to the one founded by that body, under the title of \"Merchant's Maiden Hospital ;\" when a contribution was accordingly made among the different companies of artificers in Edinburgh, and a hospital was fitted up about the year 1704, destined for the education and support of decayed trades-burgesses. This establishment was ratified in parliament, by an act similar to that incorporating the governors of the \" Merchant's Maiden Hospital;\" and Mrs. Mary Erskine, the benefi cent foundress of the above-mentioned, extended her charity in so liberal a manner to that destined for the daughters of tradesmen, that its governors voted her joint-foundress of this hospital also, and gave other testimonies of gratitude for her bounty. HERMITAGE OF BRAID. About two miles from Edinburgh, south of the Borough-moor, stands the above Hermitage, the beautiful and retired residence of Mr. Gordon. It is buried in a close valley, between two ranges of low and irregular hills, and surrounded with wood ; the small rivulet, called Braid Burn, meanders through the middle of the Vale in which it stands. About a mile to the north-east from this Hermitage, stands the House of Grange, a turreted mansion, formerly the seat of the well-known military commander, William Y"], [178, "EDINBURGH. 80 Kirkaldy. In this house, too, the celebrated historian, Dr. Robertson, spent the latter part of his life. MARCHISTON TOWER. Maitland, in his \" History of Edinburgh,\" gives the following account of this Tower. \" Although the Wright's Mansion House appears to be above three hundred and sixty years standing, yet I take the house of Marchiston, by the manner of its con struction, to be of much ancienter date ; but what adds chiefly to its fame is, its once having been the seat of the most celebrated John Lord Napier, Baron of Marchiston, who, by his admirable and most useful discovery of the Logarithms, has raised to himself and country an everlasting monument of honour.\" This tower, although its appearance carries very little of the fortress, was (according to Crawford,) in the beginning of June, a. d. 1572, during the disputes between the loyalists and associates, attacked by the latter, who' marched out with the best part of their strength, and two pieces of ordnance, to batter it, and make a diversion. This occasioned the raising of the siege of Nidderie Seaton. A.D. 1573, Marchiston is mentioned by the same author, as being used for a prison by Drury, the English general, sent to the assistance of Morton the regent. Marchiston Tower was lately the property of the Lord Napier; who re sided in it. CRAIGMILLAR CASTLE. These picturesque ruins are situated upon a rocky eminence, about three miles south of Edinburgh. By the arms of Scotland being originally placed over the entrance, the Castle appears to have been a royal residence, but we have not been able to discover by whom it was built, nor can we give any satisfactory detail of the events that have hap pened within its walls. This probably arises from the records, and other papers of a public nature respecting Scotland, being lost in their conveyance by sea from London to Edinburgh, to which place they were ordered to be restored by Charles II. having been brought from thence by Edward I. and Oliver Cromwell. We are told that this Castle, with that of Roslin, and the palace of Holyrood House, were burnt by the army that Henry VIH. sent into Scotland, to seek revenge on the inhabitants of Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, for their having frustrated the intended marriage between his son Edward and the young Queen of Scots. ' Many of the Scottish princes are said to have been confined here at times by their turbulent and unruly subjects; and it is likewise said, that Queen Mary, and her husband, Lord Darnley, used to resort thither for the use of a bath, and that the queen remained here three weeks in 1556."], [179, "TABOIf'&ATE CHUJ3RCH.

The ruins of this Palace are situated upon a rising ground, on the south side of the Lake, or Lyn, from whence the town of Linlithgow receives its name. Edward I. built a castle upon this spot, where he chiefly resided during one winter; but in 1307, the year in which this prince died, it was taken and demolished by a Scotsman, whose name was Binny; yet the place appears to have been again in the possession of the English during the reign of Edward III. It is not known by whom the present edifice was erected ; but it is evident from its remains, that it was much improved, and considerably ornamented, by James V. who made it one of his places of residence ; since which time it has remained a royal palace, and was kept in repair till the year 1746, when, at the time it was in the possession of the king's troops, the inner part of it was accidentally destroyed by fire, and has not since been restored. The Engraving exhibits one side of the remains of this Palace ; the whole of which is of a quadrangular form. Mr. Pennant, in his \"Tour of Scotland,\" has given the following particulars respecting this Palace and its decorations : the inside is much embellished with sculpture : over an inner gate are niches, in former times containing the statues of a pope and cardinal, erected, as tradition says, by James V. in compliment to his Holiness, for a present of a consecrated sword and helmet. On an outward gate, detached from the building, are the ensigns of the four orders of Knighthood, borne by his majesty, viz. the garter, the thistle, the Holy Ghost, and the golden fleece. The quadrangle within is extremely handsome, one side of which is more modern than the other, having been built by James VI. the pediments over the windows are neatly carved, and dated 1619. In one of the other sides there is a room ninety-five feet long, thirty feet six inches wide, and thirty-three feet high, at one end of which there is a gallery, probably for music. Narrow galleries run quite round the old part, to preserve the communication with the rooms, in one of which the unfortunate Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots was born. ROSLIN CASTLE. The Village of Roslin is about seven miles south of Edinburgh, and, from its romantic scenery, as well as the beautiful ruins of its Castle and Chapel, it has ever been a favourite excursion with the citizens of the metropolis. The ruins of the castle, the ancient seat of the St. Clairs, (or Sinclairs,) stand on a peninsulated rock, and are"], [184, "82 EDINBURGH. accessible only by a bridge. It is uncertain when this castle was built. About the year 1100, William de Sancto Clero, son of Waldernus Compte de Clair, who came to England with William the Conqueror, obtained from Malcolm Canmore a great part of the lands and barony of Roslin. It might probaWy be built about that time. In histon** little or no mention of this castle occurs till the year 1455, when we read of Sir James Hamilton being confined in it by James II. It was burnt down in 1544, by the English forces, under the Earl of Hertford. In 1650, it surrendered to General Monk. The modern part of the castle was rebuilt in the year 1563. The other parts of the castle present only a ruin of great magnitude ; large masses of the walls, which are of immense thickness, having here and there fallen down. The access to the castle is by a narrow bridge, over a deep natural ravine, the sides of which are solid rock. Roslin Castle gives its name to a beautiful Scottish song. TRINITY COLLEGE CHURCH. This Church, which consists only of a choir and transept, stands at the east end of the north loch, and is a good specimen of English architecture ; the windows at the east end of the choir are of great height, and have a magnificent appearance. It is probable, that a central tower was contemplated in the original design, the work being considerably raised in that part, though it is now terminated by gable-ends, and a plain sloping roof; the west end of the Church likewise bears every mark of an unfinished design. This College, with its appurtenances, was given, in 1567, by the regent Murray, to Sir Simon Preston, provost of Edinburgh, who generously conferred it on the city; for which grant, the common council made most grateful acknowledgments. A complete repair of the Church of Trinity College has since taken place. The seats and galleries, which had become very ruinous, are removed, and an entirely new arrange ment of the former has been accomplished. The pulpit, which is constructed with orna ments corresponding with the general character of the building, is placed in the centre of the west side of the transept, opposite the eastern windows ; and from this point the Church presents one of the finest models of Gothic architecture in Scotland. THE CHAPEL OF EASE, ST. CUTHBERT'S, Is situated on the west side of Cross Causeway, nearly a mile from the mother church of St. Cuthbert. Its principal front entrance is on the north-east, on which side there is a small projecting tower, surmounted with a belfry and a low spire; the windows are of a very common character, and give no indications of a place devoted to public worship.

Its height is, however, surpassed by Benevis, Benlawers, and some other mountains ; but the difference is more than com pensated by the magnificence of its insulated situation with respect to the neighbouring hills. The view from the summit is truly picturesque and extensive. On the north-east side is the source of the river Forth, here an inconsiderable stream, but very soon augmented to a river, by the numerous streams which join its waters as it passes through the valley. Ben-Lomond is chiefly composed of granite, interspersed with immense masses of quartz. Considerable quantities of micaceous schistus are found even at the top, and many rocks near the base of the mountain are entirely composed of that mineral. From the number of rare plants it possesses, Ben-Lomond affords a fertile field for the botanist. LOCH-LEVEN CASTLE. Loch-Leven Castle, Kinrosshire, stands in an island measuring about eight English acres, which island is situated nearly in the middle of a loch or lake, about twelve miles in circumference, and in many places twenty-four fathoms deep. It is not known when this castle was built. It occurs in history as early as the year 1335, when it was be sieged by Sir John de Sterling The following account of that siege is in substance given by Fordun. In the year 1315, in the midst of Lent, Sir John de Sterling, a soldier in the King of England's ser vice, with a great number of Anglefied Scots, among whom were Michael de Arnot, Michael and David de Wemys, and Richard de Melville, Knights, with many others who had embraced the English party, assembled to besiege the Castle of Loch-Leven; and reconnoitring the borders of the lake, and seeing that the Castle would not be easily taken, established their quarters at Kinross, surrounding the church with a fortress. Alan de Vipont was then the governor of the Castle, and had with him James Lambyn, a citizen of St. Andrews, and many other brave and robust Scotchmen. The siege for a while went on in the ordinary manner ; but the besiegers gaining little ground, had recourse to stratagem, and, in order to overflow the Castle and drown the garrison, con structed a strong and high dam, with turf and hard-rammed earth across the recess of the water of Leven, where it empties itself : at this work the neighbouring people, women as well as men, worked incessantly ; they also, by channels cut in the earth, drew down the waters of Leven to the town of Kinross. The festival of the blessed Margaret, Queen of Scotland, approaching, which was annually celebrated at Dunfermline, Sir John de Sterling thought it necessary, for form sake, Z"], [190, "EDINBURGH. 84 to attend, taking several of his people with him ; the remainder he disposed in the best manner for carrying on the siege ; but the blessed St. Servanus, the protector of the Islanders, is said to have inspired, them with the following mode of defence. The governor and garrison informed of Sterling's absence, and being in want of victuals, firing, and all other necessaries, secretly detached four valiant men in a light boat, and provided with proper instruments, to destroy the dam. They got out on the east side of the Castle, unperceived by the besiegers, and after labouring almost the whole night, despairing of accomplishing their purpose, had determined to desist ; but one of them suggesting that they should persist a little longer, and that he would promise them help from the faith he had in St. Servanus, resuming their work, the water began to ooze through the dam by drops, which they observing, in haste returned to their boat, and regained the Castle, carrying the joyful news to their comrades, who were thereby filled with courage. The water continued by degrees to widen the breach, and within the space of two hours ran out with great impetuosity; it having been more than a month in collecting. And such was its fury, that it swept away, not only the tents, sheds, booths, and cottages of the English, and of those lodged on the banks of the lake, carrying their horses and harness to the sea, but also tore up and carried away the banks themselves of even great districts. It being now quite day, the garrison of the Castle unanimously, as had been previously settled, embarked themselves with warlike instruments for the fort, which the soldiers there observing, and being under great astonishment, quickly sallied forth to meet them, when many of each party were wounded with arrows. The English at length, though with difficulty, were obliged to fly; on which the Scots joyfully entered the fort, and obtained a considerable booty, besides provisions, all which were conveyed away with them. The news of this event having been carried to John de Sterling, he bound himself by oath not to retire from the Castle till he had completely demolished it, and punished the garrison with death. The affairs of the English, however, became depressed, and in a short time the Scotch were delivered from their yoke, under which they had been so severely oppressed. John de Sterling, seeing it was not for his interest to persevere, and having, as a note suggests, made a sort of treaty of peace with the garrison of the Castle, disgracefully retired home, not without the stain of perjury. It is remarkable that Fordun here makes this defence a kind of miracle performed by St. Servanus, as tutelar saint of the isle; but this is not the island in which St. Servanus's monastery formerly stood, and it does not appear he was protector of any other. Maitland, who places this event in the year 1334, doubts the truth of the story, and offers several substantial arguments in support of his opinion. It is said this Castle was anciently a royal residence. It was granted by King Robert the Third, to Douglas, thence probably styled Lord of Loch-Leven ; but what makes this Castle the most remarkable is, that it was the prison wherein the unfortunate Queen Mary"], [191, ""], [192, "iJ-yrae Drmm by T.

The Castle consists of a rectangular wall, enclosing a small area, flanked by little towers, some of them round, with some ruined walls, said to be those of the chapel and apartment where Queen Mary was confined. The keep is a square tower, and stands in the north-east angle of the area ; in it is a dungeon, with a vaulted room above. The chief entrance is through a gate in the north side. THE PENTLAND HILLS, &c. This range of mountains is situated four miles south of the Scottish metropolis, in Edin burghshire, extending about ten miles from south-west to north-east ; presenting a fine picturesque boundary to the extensive and beautiful scenery by which they are surrounded. The following singular events, connected with what is termed \" the Battle of the Pentland Hills,\" give an interest to this place in Scottish history. An indigent old man, unable to discharge the fines of the church, was bound and extended on the ground, to be conveyed to prison ; but the peasants, moved with sudden indignation at this cruel treatment, disarmed the soldiers, in order to procure his release. Despair, and the apprehension of an indiscriminate punishment, increased their number; and after securing the soldiers in the neighbourhood, they surprised Sir James Turner, who remained at Dumfries with a slender guard. He had no mercy to expect from their rage; on examining his instructions, however, his severities appeared so mild, that his life was preserved. Their numbers were still inconsiderable ; but, by the influence of some ejected clergy, they were augmented to two thousand on their arrival at Lanark. There they renewed the covenant, after a solemn fast ; and, in a public declaration, professed that their allegiance to the king was undiminished, protested that their recourse to defensive arms was to remove the oppressions under which they suffered, and demanded that their beloved presbytery should be re-established, and their ministers restored. Their com manders were Wallace and Learmont, two obscure officers, for the principal gentlemen were still imprisoned ; but the spirit of the country was subdued by oppression, and in a fatiguing march towards the capital, instead of acquiring strength, they were deserted by half their number in a single night. Rothes, a few days previous to the insurrection, had departed for court, and the government remained in the hands of Sharp, whose consternation was extreme. Dalziel, the general, collected his forces at Glasgow, pursued the Whigs, as the insurgents were denominated, who approached within a few miles of the capital; but the gates were secured, and protected by cannon. The neighbouring gentlemen were summoned to its defence \u2022 the lawyers and principal inhabitants were embodied ; and, as all egress from the city was prohibited, the Whigs were disappointed of the expected aid of their friends, and they listened to an insidious cessation of arms, till almost surprised ; but the proclamation,"], [194, "EDINBURGH. 86 requiring them to disperse, contained no offer of indemnity or pardon. Their numbers were reduced to eight hundred, dispirited and exhausted by want, disappointment, and fatigue. On attempting to return by the Pentland Hills, they were overtaken by Dalziel, whom they repulsed, at first, in different attacks ; but, at sunset, their ranks were lost, or broken by the cavalry, and they were overpowered and dispersed. Not above fifty were killed, nor more than one hundred and thirty taken in the pursuit, the rest being preserved by the darkness of the night, by the fatigue of the king's troops, and by the compassion of the gentlemen who composed the cavalry, for their unhappy countrymen, whom oppres sion had rendered mad and desperate, but whose behaviour during the insurrection was inoffensive and mild. The inhabitants in the vicinity were less merciful, and many of the fugitives were intercepted and slain. This affair took place on the 28th of Novem ber, 1666. INTERIOR OF THE ADVOCATES' LIBRARY. This splendid Library is one hundred and forty feet long, and forty-two feet wide, with an elliptical arched ceiling, very richly panelled, twenty-eight feet high. The ceiling is supported by twenty-four fluted columns and thirty-six pilasters of the Corinthian order, eighteen feet and a half high, with an entablature richly ornamented. The centre compartment is formed by spandrils into a dome, with a large cupola. The dome is enriched by paintings, executed by Mr. Stothard, of Apollo and the Muses ; the celebrated historians, poets, mathematicians, &c. painted as large as life. The book-presses are formed in piers, supporting a gallery running along both sides and end of the room behind the columns. The apartment is lighted by windows on the south side and centre cupola. The floor is of oak, and the whole has a very imposing effect. SOUTH BRIDGE. This Bridge is composed of nineteen arches, of various sizes, the whole of which are concealed, except the one over the Cowgate. It runs in a line with the North Bridge, both of which intersect the High Street. From the regularity of the buildings, which have been raised on this artificial foundation, the largeness and splendour of the shops, and the great thoroughfare, this street may be considered, at once, the most compact, busy, and elegant of the Old Town. The foundation stone of this Bridge was laid on the first of August, 1785 ; and, by an opera tion of astonishing celerity, the whole was completed, and the street opened for carriages in March, 1788, In digging the foundation of the central pier of the Bridge, which was no less than twenty-two feet deep, many coins of Edward I., IL, and III. were found."], [195, "- \u2014 \u2014 T_a.Shq_a. ~~ ~ ~ SOUTH BR1DGK, FRO M T K E C OWG AT E . \"W.

It has been remarked, that, on this occasion, the ground sold higher in Edinburgh than perhaps ever was known in any city, not even excepting Rome during its most flourishing times. Some of the areas sold at the rate of \u00a396,000 per statute acre, others at \u00a3109,000 per ditto ; while some even reached the incredible and enormous sum of \u00a3150,000 per acre. HIGH SCHOOL WYND. This is a narrow lane, leading from the archiepiscopal palace in the Cowgate to Infir mary street. The fronts of the houses are mostly of wood, affording one of the best specimens of the ancient style of building in Edinburgh. Arnot observes, \"From confine ment in space, as well as imitation of their old allies the French, (for the city of Paris seems to have been the model of Edinburgh,) the houses were piled to an enormous height, some of them amounting to twelve stories; these were denominated lands. The access to the separate lodgings, in these high piles, was by a common stair, exposed to every incon venience, arising from filth, steepness, darkness, and danger from fire; and such, in a good measure, is the situation of the Old Town to this hour.\" LADY YESTER'S CHURCH. This church stands nearly opposite to the Royal Infirmary, in a street which runs to the eastward from the South Bridge. It owes its origin and its name to the piety of Mar garet Ker, Lady Yester, who in the year 1647 gave to the citizens of Edinburgh a consi derable sum of money, to build a place of worship, and maintain a minister to officiate in it. The original building, founded in consequence of this donation, was not remarkable for elegance of architecture ; but it was taken down in 1803, and a new church erected on its site, which was opened for public worship in the following year. The new church is built, with a considerable share of taste, in imitation of the ancient Gothic manner, aod proves no small ornament to this part of the city. COWGATE, &c. This street, situated in the valley on the south, runs in a parallel direction to the High Street, varying from ten to twenty feet in breadth. \" The citizens of Edinburgh,\" observes a writer, \" it seems, became extremely fond of having their houses without the Royalty \u2014 a passion which still adheres to their successors. Accordingly, the town-wall was hardly built, ere a street, spacious for those times, sprung up \u2014 the Cowgate. We 2A"], [200, "EDINBURGH. 88 are informed by a writer of the sixteenth century, that the nobility, the senators of the college of justice, and persons of the first distinction, then had their residence in the Cow gate. But the fatal overthrow on the field of Flodden, and the consternation with which it overwhelmed the citizens of Edinburgh, made those who had withdrawn beyond the Royalty, extremely anxious to have a fortified wall, to defend them from the incursions of the English.\" This wall, commencing at the south-east part of the rock on which the Castle stands, descends thence, in an oblique direction, to the West Port ; it then ascends part of the hill on the opposite side, and afterwards takes an easterly direction to the Bristow and Potter-row Ports, continuing to the Pleasance. Its direction here becomes northerly as far as the Cowgate Port, and, ascending St. Mary's Wynd, joins the Old Town Wall, somewhat southward of the Nether-bow Port. The ground on which the buildings of the Infirmary, the High School, and the University are erected, is included within the circuit of this wall, and remains of it are still to be seen contiguous to these erections. The buildings in the Cowgate are lofty, although of less elevation than those of the High-Street. On the north, the valley, (except that part running eastward, and where it joins the Calton Hill,) is, for some extent, laid out as a garden. NEW POST OFFICE, WATERLOO PLACE. The building formely appropriated to the business of the Post Office, was situated at the extremity of the western range of buildings on the North Bridge. This being found too small and very inconvenient, a new Post Office has been erected in Waterloo Place, with extensive accommodations for conducting this important branch of the public business. Besides this, places are appointed in different convenient parts of the city, for the recep tion of letters, of which the General Post Office has the superintendence. EXCISE OFFICE, DRUMMOND PLACE. The building formerly occupied as an office by the Board of Excise, stands in a recess, on the eastern side of St. Andrew's Square, and was erected from a design by Sir William Chambers : it was occupied as a residence by the late Sir Lawrence Dundas, many years the representative of the City of Edinburgh, and grandfather of the present Lord, of that name. This handsome and commanding edifice was purchased by Government at the sum of \u00a310,000, and continued for a length of time to be appropriated to the above mentioned purpose : but the Excise establishment having been considerably reduced, it was deter mined to remove the business to less expensive premises, and this building was disposed of to the Royal Bank for \u00a333,000. The present Excise Office is situated in Drummond Place, and, although very inferior to the old, is well adapted to all the purposes for which it is intended."], [201, "_OBY <\u00a9FF]JX_5 WAT_\u201e_.\u00a9\u00a9 P__,C_a XDINBV3.GB..

The Palace of Dalkeith is a magnificent structure. It stands on a knoll, over looking the confluence of the north and south branches of the river Esk. The approach to the house and the banks of the river are adorned with plantations. For many ages, antecedent to the erection of the present edifice, there had stood on this spot a castle of considerable strength, the residence of the family of Morton. Dalkeith Palace, as represented in the annexed Engraving, was built about the beginning of the last century, by Anne, Duchess of Buccleuch, widow of the unfortunate James, Duke of Monmouth, natural son of Charles II. It consists of a front adorned with columns of the Corinthian order, and a double wing at each end. The great Court between the Palace and the Park is very spacious, environed with balustrades of iron, between pillars of freestone. And from the gate of the Court there is an Avenue through the Park, directly south, of a mile long ; and round the Palace a Terrace, which, on the north, where the front of the Palace is 120 feet wide, overlooks a precipice to the river, as at Windsor. On the east side is a natural amphitheatre, in the bot tom of which is a flower-garden, and, round the side, evergreen slopes. You enter the Palace by a great Hall paved with stone. To the left of the Hall is the great Staircase supported by pillars of marble, and every step curiously inlaid with walnut-tree wood. At the top of the staircase is a noble room, forty feet long, and thirty high and broad. There is also a great room to the north of the Hall. The walls of most of the rooms are adorned with many very valuable family Portraits. The offices join the town of Dalkeith, which is a royal burgh, large and well-built. The estate of Dalkeith has been held by the Buccleuch family ever since the year 1642. The Park, which abounds in woods, particularly antique oaks, con sists of about 800 Scotch acres, and is surrounded by a high wall. The rivers North and South Esk run through the Park, and unite their streams about half a mile below the house. His late Majesty George IV. took up his residence at Dalkeith Palace upon his visit to Scotland. The noble family of Scott is very ancient, and was of great importance on the borders. The first of the family ennobled was in the reign of James VI., to recompense his signal merit under Maurice, Prince of Orange, in 1606. The son of this nobleman, named Walter, was created Earl of Buccleuch in 1619. Walter, the second Earl, who died in 1651, left two daughters, Mary and Anne. Mary dying without issue, the title of Countess of Buccleuch devolved on her only sister, Anne, afterwards married to James, Duke of Monmouth, and who thereupon adopted the surname of Scott. In 1673, the Duke and Duchess were created Earl and Countess of Dalkeith, Baron and Baroness Whitechurch and Eskdale, with remainder to the heirs of their bodies. Upon the Duke's unfor tunate decease, the English honours became forfeited, but the attainder did not effect the peerages enjoyed by the Duchess in her own right, being Duchess of Buccleuch by creation, and Countess of Buccleuch by descent from her ances tor, the first Earl. Upon her death in February, 1732, she was succeeded in her titles by her grandson Francis, the second Duke \u2014 who, dying in April, 1751, was succeeded by his grandson Henry, the third Duke* \u2014 on whose decease, January, 1812, the honours descended to his eldest son, Charles Wil liam Henry. This nobleman died at Lisbon, in April, 1819, and was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Walter Francis, the present and fifth Duke of Buc cleuch, and third Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry. \u2014 Motto : Amo. \u2022 Upon the death of the Duke of Queensberry, without issue, in 1810, Henry Duke of Buccleuch, added to his other titles, Duke of Queensberry, Marquess of Dumfrieshire, Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar, Viscount Nith, Thortholwold and Ros6, Lord Douglas, of Kinmont, Middlebri, and Dornock. 1."], [206, "$cntcuift, fflifcUofbim ; THE SEAT OF SIR GEORGE CLERK, BART. M. P. Penicuik has long been one of the principal attractions in the environs of the Northern Metropolis, for its very beautiful situation and extensive ornamented grounds ; or on account of the fine collection of pictures, and the classical feast which the interior presents. The House is situated in a parish of the same name, about ten miles from Edinburgh, and two from the village of Penicuik, about six hundred and sixty feet above the level of the sea. The Park and Grounds surrounding the House, adorned with plantations of various ages, amount to about a thousand acres ; \u2014 the estate being altogether about eight thousand acres. The river Esk, and a number of tributary streams, each forming distinct glens or dales, and separated by heights covered with the richest foliage, render the park most picturesque and beautifully diversified. These streams either flow into each other, or into the Esk, before that river passes the House, which it leaves with considerably augmented waters at about the distance of a quarter of a mile ; winding in a very graceful manner, and seen occasionally, from the windows, glancing through the boughs of its richly wooded banks. Besides the very venerable trees that surround the Mansion, and adorn the wide level space in front of it, there are several hundred acres of wood within the boundaries of the park, to which the proprietor is yearly making additions. There are three fine lakes, the banks and islands of which are ornamented with evergreens, forming most delightful walks, while the pleasures of the parterre are sus pended by the winter frosts. From the portico in front of the house, as seen in our plate, there is a good view of the esplanade before the building, with its scattered trees, bounded by a fine bank, over which the tower and flag-staff rise ; and to the left are the beau tiful colonnade and spire of the stables, both excellent objects, and beyond them the Pentland hills covered with flocks ; from the eastern windows the vista of an aged lime avenue is seen, to which succeeds the broken wooded character of the den of the Esk, terminated by a handsome obelisk, erected to the memory of Allan Ramsay, who was a friend and protegee of the family ; and who laid the scene of his celebrated Gentle Shepherd in the immediate vicinity of Penicuik. The views from the House are much improved by several ruins of ancient towers and castles, three of which are within the park, and seen from the windows : viz. Brunstain, which belonged to the Crichtons ; Outershill, to the Prestons, the former possessors of Penicuik ; and a hunting seat of Oliver St. Clair, Baron of Rosslyn, on an elevated site on the southern bank of the Esk. Penicuik House was erected by Sir James Clerk, in 1760, from his own plans. Having lived much in Italy, and made architecture his particular study, no pro fessional architect was employed in any part of the building ; and numerous ornaments of the grounds mark the sound judgment and correct taste of that accomplished gentleman. The building is an oblong square, of considerable length, and fronts the north, on which side is a fine portico of eight Ionic columns, twenty feet in height, raised on arches, to which two broad flights of steps, adorned with a stone balustrade on either side, conduct, and thence lead immediately to the principal floor. In the tympanum of the pediment, is the shield and crest of the family of Clerk ; surmounted by the badge of a Baronet of Nova Scotia. The ceiling is painted in fresco by Runciman, and represents sacrifices to the heathen deities ; it is admirably executed in relief, and closely resembles sculpture. On each side of the entrance are fine statues of the Dacian captives, from the antique ; and over the door is inscribed, in Roman 2"], [207, "characters, non domo dominus sed domino domus honestanda es.* The Hall is thirty-two feet by thirty, and very lofty. Beautiful white marble statues of the Piping Faun, Apollo, and Flora, are placed in niches : besides these, there is a number of fine remains of Roman sculpture, brought from the station at Middleby, in Dumfriesshire, a possession of this family, and likewise a profu sion of antique pedestals, vases, busts, bronzes, &c, forming a most interesting and valuable collection. Besides the Hall of entrance and several spacious bed rooms, there are on the principal floor five large and elegant rooms, viz. Ossian's Hall, small Drawing-room, eighteen feet square ; dining-room, forty-five feet long, looking toward the north ; breakfast-parlour, twenty-four feet by eigh teen ; and ante-chamber, eighteen feet square : the library, thirty-seven feet by twenty-five, is on the second floor, and a great number of bed-rooms on that and the third story. Tlie Great Drawing- Room, or Ossian's Hall, thirty-seven feet by twenty five, is so called from the roof being wholly occupied with paintings, the sub jects of which are selected from the poems of Ossian, and executed in a mas terly style by Runciman ; the figures all the size of life. In the centre is Ossian playing on the harp to the ancient inhabitants of Caledonia ; allegorical figures in the angles of the ceiling represent the Tay, Spey, Clyde, and Tweed, the principal rivers of Scotland. Along the sides of the roof are the following subjects : The Fall of Young Oscar, the Death of Oscar, the Death of Aggan decca, Hunting Piece from Cathloda, Gekhosa mourning over Lamderg, Oina Morul serenading Ossian, Cormac attacking a Spirit, Cairbar's Murder of Cor mac, Scandinavian Wizards, and Fingal encountering a Spirit. \u2014 The principal Pictures in this and all the apartments are given in the accompanying list. Besides the paintings, there is at Penicuik one of the finest collections of rare and valuable prints to be met with in the kingdom ; a number of fine original sketches by Vandyck, Raffaelle, Guido Rheni, Medina, &c, and an extensive well-selected Library, abounding with rare books, the accumulation of many generations of accomplished literary possessors of the Mansion. There are two handsome staircases, which ascend to the second or bed-room floor from vestibules leading off the Hall of Entrance : the arched roof of the left ascent is painted with emblematical figures of the seasons and signs of the Zodiac ; and that of the right, represents the landing, marriage, nuptial feast, and apotheosis of Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Malcolm III. or Canmore, by Runciman. The Flag-tower, which forms a fine object in the view, and appears to great advantage in many of the drives and walks of the Park, was erected by Sir James Clerk, and over its entrance are the words tibi sit prudentia turris 1750 : there is a staircase leading to the top, whioh commands a grand view of almost the whole counties of East and Mid Lothian, with the wide expanse of the Frith of Forth, the distant shores and hills of Fife, the Bass-rock, Inch keith, Isle of May, &c, forming a prospect almost unequalled for variety, rich ness, and extent. The Clock Spire is one hundred and twenty feet high, and of correct and beautiful proportions. Near it is an exact model of the cele brated Arthur's Oven, or Temple of Terminus, in Stirlingshire, the only Roman temple in Britain. Previous to its demolition, Sir James Clerk had its measurement and proportions accurately copied in his Court of Offices. Penicuik, Lasswade, and the other extensive properties in Mid-Lothian, belonging to Sir George Clerk, have been upwards of two centuries in posses sion of his family. He has been several times returned Member of Parliament for the County, and was in 1819 appointed one of the Lords of the Board of Admiralty. He married Maria Law, niece of Lord Ellenborough. Sir George Clerk is the sixth Baronet, his ancestor having been raised to that dignity by Charles II. in 1679. * During the heat of the French Revolution, a committee met at the village, each of whom fixed upon what was to fall to his share. There accordingly appear the words, David Harper, his house, written in black chalk, on the side of the door of this seat, which it would appear this man had appro priated to himself. 3"], [208, "4 \u2022Hist of tfj-e principal Picturrsi at Pntiruik.

This venerable pile is situated in the parish of Fyvie, and in that district of Aberdeenshire called Formartine, which gives the title of Viscount to the Earl of Aberdeen; about twenty-six miles north of the town of Aberdeen, upon the right of the turnpike road leading from thence to Inverness by Turiff and Banff. The Castle is turreted, and at present consists of only two sides of a square of one hundred and fifty feet in length each ; which, although of great antiquity, is quite entire, and in the most thorough state of repair. It is handsomely and suitably furnished, and contains a large collection of paint ings, comprehending works of the old masters, as well as those of the more modern artists. At what period the present edifice was built, is not exactly known ; but, as the South-east Tower has, past all memory, been called \" Preston's Tower,\" there is no doubt that it must have been in existence in the fourteenth century, when Sir Henry Preston was the proprietor, he having obtained a grant of the estate, in part of the ransom of Ralph, or Ranulph de Percy, whom he had taken prisoner at the battle of Otterburn, as stated in \" Pinkerton's History of Scotland,\" under the house of Stuart, \" Douglas's Peerage,\" &c. &c. The other two sides of the square above referred to, which it is believed were much more ancient, having become ruinous, were taken down by General Gordon, the father of the present proprietor. In former times, the Castle appears to have been a place of considerable strength, adapted to the mode of warfare then in use ; and prior to the period when Sir Henry Preston acquired the right to it, as before-mentioned, it is said to have sustained a siege, and to have been successfully defended by the Lady of Sir James Lindsay, of Crawford, against her nephew, Robert de Keith, who was ultimately obliged to raise the siege, and to retire towards Baurty, where he was met by Sir James, the lady's husband, and totally defeated, with the slaughter of fifty of his followers. It may further be observed, that the entrance in front of the Castle is secured by an ancient iron gate, of curious workmanship ; that in the lower part of the South-west Tower, there is an arched room, or chamber, to which there is no access, having neither door nor window, and which was possibly the place of confinement ; and that the communication from the present Entrance Hall to the upper chambers, is by a lofty spiral stone staircase, upwards of twenty-four feet wide, revolving round a massive pillar, or newel, ornamented with the armorial bearings of former proprietors, and other devices. 2. 1"], [212, "2 FYVIE CASTLE. The Park, which surrounds the Castle, and is skirted all round with wood, partly natural and partly planted, is extensive. The river Ythan enters it at the east, and, flowing in a circuitous direction until it reaches the Castle, then winds round the base of it, in its course, at the depth of about fifty feet. On the other hand, at a considerable distance to the west, under a high sloping bank, there is a lake, or large piece of water, visible from the Castle, which adds much interest to the beauty of the scenery. The Grounds, which in various places rise in gentle swells, are interspersed with clumps and belts of plantation, and scattered trees, distributed with much taste ; and as the hills in the adjacent country, beyond the Park, are also well wooded, the whole forms a grand and picturesque landscape in every direction."], [213, "JBvnmf &i)tvXtttmf)ivt, THE SEAT OF ALEXANDER IRVINE, ESQ The name of Irwin, Irwyn, Irving or Irvine, appears to have been of long standing in the south and south-west of Scotland. One of that name acquired the lands of Bonshaw, in Dumfriesshire, which his descendants still possess. King Robert Bruce, when he came from England, to recover his kingdom from Edward I., carried with him, from Bonshaw, William de Irwin, a son of that family, made him his armour-bearer, and gave him his own device, or arms, when Earl of Carrick \u2014 viz. argent, three bunches of holly leaves, three in each, two and one ; Crest, a bunch of holly leaves ; Supporters, two savages with batons, and wreathed ; motto, Sub sole, sub umbra virens. He granted him the Forest of Drom or Drum, in Aberdeenshire, by charter under the great seal. A lineal descendant of William, Alexander Irvine of Drum, had a command in the Lowland forces, at the battle of Harlaw, 1411, where he and M'Lean of Dowart, ancestor of M'Lean of Coll, having fought in single combat, were both killed. M'Lean was Lieutenant-general under Donald, Lord of the Isles. Their successors afterwards exchanged swords, as a token that no feud or ani mosity existed between the families. The above mentioned Alexander is cele brated in the old ballad of \" the Battle of the Harlaw :\" \u2014 \" Gude Sir Alexandr Irving, The much renounit Laird of Drum, Nane in his days were better sene,- Quhen they were semblit all and sum, To praise him we sud not be riumm, For valor, wit, and worthiness ; To end his days he there did cum, Quhois ransom is remeidyless.\" There appears to have existed an ancient feud between the Keiths, hereditary great marshals of Scotland, and the Irvines of Drum. Tradition relates that the states of Scotland enjoined a matrimonial alliance between the families, in order to suppress it, but that Irvine could never bring himself to complete the union. When about to engage with the Highland army, he made a vow to do so, if he returned ; but, if he should fall, he requested of his brother, who accompanied him, that he should marry the lady. His brother, who afterwards took the name of Alexander, returned safe, and completed the alliance. He was one of the commissioners sent by the states of Scotland to treat of the ransom of King James I. and was knighted by him in 1424. His son, Alexander Irvine, Esq. who succeeded him, married the daughter of Abernethy, Lord Saltoun. His brother distinguished himself at the battle of Brechin, 1452. Alexander, the seventh in descent, obtained a gift of nonentry to the estate of Forglen \" on account of Drum, his said son, and their, friends, their good and thankful service done to the king, (James V.) in searching, and taking, and bringing his rebels to justice.\" He married Elizabeth Ogilvie, daughter of the Laird of Finlater, and was killed at the battle of Pinkie (1547), during his father's lifetime. His son, Alexander Irvine, Esq. who succeeded his grandfather, married Lady Elizabeth Keith, daughter of William, earl marshal. The House was built in 1619, by his son, Alexander Irvine, Esq. as appears by the dates over the windows, with his initials, and those of Lady Marion Douglas, daughter of the Earl of Buchan, his wife. It is fully as commodious as buildings erected in those times generally are. The tower is of much older, but uncertain date. From its corresponding in almost every respect with edifices erected during, i or even before the thirteenth century, and from there being no document respecting it in the family archives, it is probable that the tower existed before the estate came into the possession of this family, and that it was one of those forts generally found in royal chases. It is in perfect repair, and inhabited. The only singularity in its architecture is the rounding of the corners. The height is seventy feet. It is divided into three chambers by Gothic arches, each becoming more pointed, so that the uppermost has very little pressure against the walls. The lowest is partly under ground, and has 3"], [214, "4 drum, aberdeenshire. served as a prison. In it is a well. The walls of this part are twelve feet thick; in the second division they are ten. Both in this chamber, and in the upper most, are recesses, in the thickness of the walls, which evidently have served for bed-rooms. The Stairs are likewise in the wall at the angle of the building. Each of the two upper apartments have been subdivided by wooden floors, sup ported by stone trusses. The above mentioned Alexander Irvine, Esq. founded four bursaries of philosophy, and two of divinity, in the Marischal College ; and four in the Grammar School of Aberdeen, still presented by the family. His lady endowed a Hospital for burgesses' widows and daughters of Aberdeen. Sir Alexander Irvine, Knt. son of the preceding, was sheriff principal of Aberdeen. He married Magdalen, daughter of Sir John Scrimzeour, constable of Dundee. He and his son, Alexander, who succeeded him, sustained very great losses in consequence of the civil wars in the time of Charles I. and II. having been strenuously engaged in the royal cause. A spirited letter of his to the presbytery of Aberdeen, occasioned by a threat of excommunication, is to be found in \" Whitelocke's Memorials.\" His son, Robert, died in prison in Edinburgh, where he himself and his eldest son were long confined ; the latter having sentence of death passed on him, the execution of which was stopped in consequence of the Marquess of Montrose's victory at Kilsyth. Sir Alexander Irvine, Knt. obtained a patent from Charles I. creating him Earl of Aberdeen, which the breaking out of the rebellion prevented from passing the seals. After the restoration, the peerage was again offered to his son, but declined then, on his part. He married Lady Mary Gordon, daughter of George, Marquess of Huntly. In 1663 he executed an entail, in form of a procuratory of resignation of his estate holding of the crown, including the baronies of Drum and Cromar, and some other lands, for new infeofment, \" to himself and the heirs male of his body, whom failing, to the heirs of taillie, to be contained in any writing under his hand.\" In consequence of this procuratory, King Charles II. granted a charter under the great seal, containing a novodamus of the whole estate holding of the crown. The various turns of fortune which the family experienced, from having taken an active part in the public events which agitated the country, as well as in the more private feuds, then so prevalent and destructive ; the same principle, which dictated their warm adherence to the cause of the unfortunate Charles, induced them to support his descendants ; and they had the consolation to come out of the various struggles without taint, and without forfeiture. The present proprietor, Alexander Irvine, Esq. is both heir of entail and heir of line. Drum is situated on the river Dee, ten miles west of Aberdeen, on the slope of a hill, (as the name, which is derived from the Gaelic, denotes,) and enjoys an extensive prospect to the east and south. The annexed view represents the back part of the building, originally the entrance was on this side, through an archway, leading into an open court ; but it has been twice altered since, the House gaining each time in convenience. Very extensive alterations and improvements in the interior have been made within the last thirty years, in order to keep pace with modern ideas of comfort and elegance. The Grounds, which are of considerable extent, rise in bold swells, and have a^ largeness of character, which assimilates well with the style of the building. They have also been essentially enlarged and improved within the last thirty years. Formerly the Garden enclosed two sides of the House, according to the taste of the seventeenth century ; but it was removed to a moderate distance, and the space which it occupied laid out in shrubbery and lawn. There is a good deal of fine timber in the grounds, principally oak, elm, and ash, probably coeval with the House ; and large plantations of birch, larch, and Scotch firs on the estate. We beg to make our acknowledgments to Hugh Irvine, Esq. for the loan of a Drawing of Drum, from which ours was made, as well as for his assistance in this very interesting description."], [215, ""], [216, "CASTLE TOW ABB).

The old Castle of Toward, in the district of Cowal, from which this View is taken, stands a little to the south-east of the present building, and was once the seat of the Lamonts, of Lamont, formerly the most considerable family in this part of the county. The ruins of the old Castle are evidence of a large structure. Here the unfortunate Queen Mary of Scotland dined on the 29th of July, 1563, as appears from her Itinerary. Castle Toward was attacked in June, 1646, by a body of Campbells, who waged a long and cruel warfare with the Lamonts. After a six weeks' siege it surrendered by capitulation, to which little attention was paid ; the prisoners were hanged, and the Castle burned. Since that, it does not appear to have been inhabited. This Estate, and the adjoining lands of Achinwilline, on which the present Castle stands, were bought some years since by Kirkman Finlay, Esq., of Glasgow, who represented that city in the parliament which met in 1812, and by whom this building was erected in 1821, from a design of Mr. David Hamilton. The View of the Frith of Clyde, from the House and Grounds, is singularly grand and beautiful. Rothesay, in the Island of Bute, which gave the title of Duke to the eldest son of the King of Scotland, stands immediately opposite, at the distance of about three miles. Its situation at the bottom of the beautiful bay of the same name, which has been compared to the bay of Naples, is rendered peculiarly grand by the noble background it possesses, in the hills of the island of Arran. The interest of such a scene is increased by the appearance of the old Castle of Rothesay, once the residence of Robert III. father of James I. of Scotland ; it is a building of great extent, and affords, even in its present state of moul dering decay, a proof of no very contemptible knowledge of architecture at that remote period. It is amusing to speculate on the state and manners of the people of this dis trict at that time, and to compare their privations with the comforts and con veniences of the present day. In the time of King Robert, the means of communication with his residence \u25a0were so difficult and uncertain, that he was considered as having almost renounced the sovereignty ; and the kingdom was, with little reference to him, governed by his brother, the Duke of Albany. At present the intercourse, by steam-boats, with the city of Glasgow, the towns of Greenock, Port Glasgow, and Dumbarton, on the one side \u2014 and with Lochgilhead, Inverary, and Cambletown, on the other \u2014 is so great and constant, that six or eight of these vessels are to be seen in the harbour every day, affording a conveyance to the neighbouring country, the most easy, quick, and economical that can be found in the empire. The sail from Glasgow to Inverary, through what is called the Kyles or Straits of Bute, has long been celebrated as one of great beauty. The Island of Bute, separated from the district of Cowal by a narrow channel, is considered to be the Montpellier of Scotland, and is very little visited by severe frost or snow. The thermometer, in the season of the hardest frost, stands generally eight or ten degrees higher than at Largs, on the opposite shore of the Frith of Clyde, in the county of Ayr. 3."], [218, "2 ftttfccrarg \u00c6aatie, Slrgslfeiiir*, Jk B- THE SEAT OF TUB DUKE OF ARGYLL. In the south-western part of North Britain, Inverary Castle forms the principal attraction of visitors.. Its situation, remarkable for beauty and grandeur in the midst of a spacious area surrounded by lofty hills covered with wood, having in front Loch Fyne, spreading into the form of a deep semicircular bay, was fixed upon by the noble and ancient family of Campbell as their chief place of resi dence, early in the fourteenth century. It was here that Queen Mary honoured the Earl of Argyll by a visit, in the year 1563. This ancient castle was taken down about the year 1770. The spacious castellated Mansion represented in our view was founded by Archibald, Duke of Argyll, in 1745 ; but the rebellion breaking out that year, retarded its completion; the building was, however, resumed, and finished within a few years from that time. It is built of lapis ollaris, or pot-stone, of a grey sombre hue, which is soft under friction, but admits of a fine polish, and is capable of resisting the effects of the weather equal to the hardest marble ; the stone was brought from the opposite shore of Loch Fyne. The Castle is a large square building, flanked on each angle with a circular tower; the centre rising to a height sufficient to give light from above to the large hall. The principal entrance is from the west, leading into the grand Hall, which is hung round with the weapons and armour ofthe Highlanders, arranged with care and taste, and is surrounded by a gallery, containing an organ ; this gallery communicates with the principal chambers. The Hall in every respect is made to correspond with the character o'f the architecture adopted on the exterior ; but the grand Staircase, and other portions of the building, though magnificent, and designed with skill, are wholly in the modern taste. The great Drawing Room is a noble apartment, hung with tapestry, and ornamented in a most superb manner. The turrets at the angles of the building are adapted as small libraries or private parlours. The remaining chambers are numerous, and are arranged in a manner equally elegant and com modious, containing many fine specimens of art, among which are several inte resting portraits connected with the history of this ancient family : one, of the unfortunate Marquess of Argyll, who was beheaded May 27th, 1661 ; and also a portrait of his son, Archibald, the ninth Earl of Argyll, who was likewise beheaded at the cross of Edinburgh, June 30th, 1685, in consequence of sen tences, which will leave a lasting stain upon the memory of those who inflicted them ; portraits of the late Duke of Argyll, and of Lord Frederick Campbell, both by Gainsborough ; Douglas, sixth Duke of Hamilton, by Battoni ; several landscapes representing the romantic scenery of the neighbourhood, by Nasmyth and Williams ; some fine drawings by De Croc ; and a numerous collection of prints by the best masters. The Park is extensive ; it is adorned with fine old trees, and is watered by the river Aray, a rapid stream, which falls into the lake or arm of the sea ; and, within the pleasure-grounds, is crossed by a handsome bridge. The shores of Loch Fyne are beautifully indented with a variety of peninsul\u00e6, and its waters stored with excellent fish. The hill of Dunicoick rises almost perpendicular to the height of 750 feet behind the house : it is richly covered with wood, except ing where the rock projects through the trees, and increases its grandeur. It is surmounted by a small square tower, remarkable for its extensive prospect over a tract for which nature has done much, and the successive possessors of the estate have not been sparing of labour or expense in improvement. The Mar quess of Argyll, in the time of King Charles I. began the plantations which now adorn the scene ; and his descendants have carried on his plans.

The House stands on a fine bank near the Loch of Lindores, a beautiful piece of water, about a mile in length, and three-quarters of a mile in breadth, finely skirted with thriving plantations, and abounding with trout and other fish. The grounds imme diately surrounding the building are very highly ornamented with shrubberies and young wood, which seem to suit the soil and climate remarkably well. The House covers a great extent of ground, and is extremely well-proportioned and beautiful. The Entrance Hall is twenty feet by* twenty, lighted from the roof of the Tower by a fine stained glass window, and ornamented with beautiful cornices and embellishments, in imitation of stone. The principal Dining-room is forty feet in length, and the other public rooms are large and splendid. The plans have not yet been entirely completed, but, when finished, this House will combine the most excellent domestic arrange ments, with considerable extent, and very great chasteness and beauty of external appearance. Newburgh, was, at an early period, erected into a borough of regality, under the Abbot of Lindores ; and in the year 1631, after that abbacy was erected into a temporal lordship, Charles I. granted a charter to the town, with many immunities and privileges, all of which it still enjoys, except that of sending a member to parliament, and a delegate to the convention of boroughs. At the north-east extremity of the parish, adjoining to that of Abdie, are the ruins of the ancient Abbey of Lindores, near the lake. Besides the remains of the Abbey, the parish of Newburgh contains two ancient crosses, called the Cross of Mugdrum, and Cross of Macduff, both of which have been covered with Runic characters."], [222, "6 aSaliurme fflQwcffffift#f>ivti THE SEAT OF MAJOR-GENERAL BALFOUR. This elegant Grecian Mansion is situated in the parish of Markinch, a few miles from the county town of Cupar. It stands in the centre of an extensive lawn, beautifully diversified by undu lating ground, and clothed with fine old trees, and with plantations of different ages. The building is of considerable size, and has been greatly augmented by the present proprietor, from the designs of Mr. Crichton of Edinburgh. The annexed view exhibits two fronts, both of which are of modern erection. The entrance is under a handsome portico, of the Ionic order, and conducts to the Hall, which measures twenty-five feet in length by twenty-two in width. The Saloon, which is entered from this immediately, and which extends in the same direction, is sixty-eight feet long by fifteen wide; and at the opposite extremity is the principal staircase. On either side of the Hall, but entered from the Saloon, are the Dining-room and Drawing-room, each thirty-three feet by twenty-two ; and communicating with the Drawing-room is the Library, and the Billiard-room \u2014 the former thirty-one feet by twenty-two, and the latter twenty-five feet by twenty.

This delightful residence is situated about forty miles from the southern frontier of Scotland. The greater part of this country, and of that district in particular which surrounds The Haining, is known as the Forest of Ettricke, whose beau tiful and romantic scenery, and interesting and almost chivalric history, are immortalized by ancient as well as by modern minstrels. Abounding in hills, lakes, and rivers, and (formerly) in impenetrable forests of the noblest oak, well peopled with the stag and wild boar, the royal James here found the amplest opportunity of gratifying his enthusiastic love of the chase, and fixed his hunt ing seat at Newark, a castle on the Yarrow water, a few miles above Selkirk, now the property, and close to Bowhill, the beautiful and favourite seat, of the Duke of Buccleugh. The Haining has been above a century and a half in the possession of the Pringles of Clifton, but, though their usual and favourite residence, is not the chief or family seat, which is Clifton, in the adjoining county of Roxburgh, and from which, according to the universal custom with every family of any importance in Scotland, and as is also the case in many parts of the continent, their distinctive appellation is derived. Like most of the Border families, this is of a very great antiquity, and boasts of an alliance with the Douglas's, (now represented by the Douglas's of Caverse) and the Murrays, formerly powerful barons. The counties of Selkirk and Roxburgh have been represented by various members of this family, and of it was Lord Alemoor, one of the most eminent scholars and distinguished judges of the Scottish bench, whose father, Lord Haining, was also a senator of the college of justice. The House has been rebuilt about thirty years, and has lately been enlarged and improved under the direction of Mr. Elliot, an architect, whose taste and genius has so many splendid memorials in the public buildings with which Edinburgh is adorned. It is a pure Grecian building, and of the enriched Ionic order. The stone employed is a beautiful and highly polished freestone, of a pale lead colour. The portico on the north, and the semi-circular colonnade on the south or lake front, are justly admired. The Grounds are somewhat in the formal terraced style, which, however, accords well with the Italian-looking sweet scenery which the view of the Lake presents. The House stands on a green terrace, whose base is washed by this beautiful natural Lake ; and the surface of the Park, which rises on each side, is uncommonly diversified and"], [226, "5 THE HAINING. lovely.

Duff House, the principal seat of James Duff, Earl of Fife, is most delight fully situated on the banks of the river Deveron, in the immediate vicinity of the town of Banff. It is a modern structure, built of the Edinburgh sandstone, from the architectural designs of the celebrated Adams. The general form is quadrangular, with a square tower at each corner. The whole of this elegant mansion is executed in the most classic taste of Roman architecture ; fluted semi-columns of the Corinthian and Composite orders support cornices that are adorned with the most elaborate and beautiful carvings, and embellished above by statues, and vases highly ornamented. Duff House contains many elegant apartments, which are embellished by a profusion of paintings, particularly portraits. Among these are two fine heads of Charles I. and his Queen ; several by Sir Joshua Reynolds, by Rubens, Sir Peter Lely, Zucehero, Kneller, and other eminent masters. The Library is a spacious room, nearly seventy feet in length, and extending the whole breadth of the building. The books are numerous and well selected. It is furnished also with many portfolios of the choicest prints. In a small apartment adjoining is a cabinet of Roman and British coins and medals. \" The Earl of Fife's park and plantations are upwards of fourteen miles in circumference. The park is bounded by the two bridges of Banff and Alva, and contains, within its circuit, a part of two counties and four parishes. The pleasure-grounds are laid out with much taste and elegance : the walks are of great extent and variety, some winding beautifully along the banks of the Deveron, and others leading off, in different directions, to wide and distant plantations. On a mount in the park formerly stood a chapel belonging to a convent of Carmelites, with ground consecrated as a burying- place. Here many human bones were found, and, by the care of the late Lord Fife, deposited in a large and beautiful urn elevated on a pedestal, and placed on the spot. On the same eminence, overhanging the river, his Lordship built an elegant mausoleum. It is of Gothic architecture, and surrounded by a shrubbery, and forms a strik ing ornament to the park : the windows are of painted glass, in casements of stone ; and in front are placed two beautiful statues of Faith and Hope.\" Among the monuments in the mausoleum is one of curious sculpture and great antiquity, sacred to the memory of John Duff, of Muldarot, an ancestor of Lord Fife. It was brought thither a few years ago, together with the ashes of the deceased, from the family burying-place in the church of Cullen. In this monument is rudely sculptured the figure of a warrior, in a full coat of armour, with this inscription : \u2014 \" Hic jacet Johannes Duf, de Muldavat, et Baldavi. Obiit, 2 Julii, 1404.\" The family of Duff, or Macduff, is of great antiquity in Scotland. Macduff, Thane of Fife, one of the most powerful subjects in Scotland, excited a formidable revolt against the usurper Macbeth, in the year 1056, which terminated in the defeat and death of Macbeth, at Lunfanan, in Aberdeenshire, 5th December that year, and the restoration of King Malcolm III. to the throne of his ancestors.\u2014 Besides other privileges, he was, by his sovereign, created Earl of Fife. By the forfeiture of Murdac, Duke of Albany, 1425, the title of Earl of Fife was vested in the crown, until it was revived in 1759, in the person of William Duff, Lord Braco of Kilbryde, who derived his descent from the ancient Earls of Fife. James Duff, the second Earl of Fife, born in 1T29, was a nobleman of highly independent character, and whose memory claims the respect of the present age, and the gratitude of posterity. He greatly increased his extensive property by several purchases of land in the north of Scotland, and embellished the face of the country by plantations, on a magnificent scale, covering no less than 14,000 acres of, till then barren and unproductive, land, for which he twice obtained the gold medal from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &c. His Lordship died at his house in Whitehall, London, 28th January, 1809, in his 80th year, and was buried in the mausoleum at Duff House. Leaving no issue, he was succeeded by his brother, the Hon. Alexander Duff, of Eight, in Aberdeenshire, a member of the Faculty of Advocates, who, in 1775, married Mary, eldest daughter of George Skene, of Skene ; and dying in April, 1811, was succeeded by his son James Duff, the present and fourth Earl of Fife, a nobleman who greatly distinguished himself in the army during the Peninsular war."], [230, "<\u00a3orfcoit <\u00a3astle, Mantt&ftivt : THE SEAT OF THE DUKE OF GORDON. Ox the banks of the Spey, near Fochabers, surrounded by beautiful plantations, stands Gordon Castle, the magnificent residence of the Duke of Gordon. The castle was originally built by George, second Earl of Huntly, and altered and enlarged in every succeeding age. It has, of late years, been almost rebuilt by the present duke, in all the elegant magnificence of modern architecture : it extends in front to the length of 568 feet from east to west ; being, however, of different depth, the breaks make a variety of light and shade, which takes off the appearance of excess in uniformity. The body of the building is of four stories ; and in its southern front stands the tower, entire, of the original castle, by much ingenuity making a part ofthe modern mansion, and rising many feet above it. The wings are magnificent pavilions of two lofty stories, connected by galleries of two lower stories ; and beyond the pavilions, buildings are extended equally to either hand, of one floor and an attic story. The whole of this vast edifice, externally, is of white free-stone, cut in the most elegant manner, and finished all around by a rich cornice, and a handsome battlement. The hall is embellished by a copy of the Apollo Belvidere, and of the Venus de Medicis, beautifully executed of statuary marble by Harwood. Here also, by the same ingenious statuary, are busts of Homer, Caracalla, M. Aurelius, Faus tina, and a Vestal. At the bottom of the great staircase are busts of Julius C\u00e6sar, Cicero, and Seneca, on marble pedestals. With these last stands a bust of Cosmo the Third, Duke of Tuscany \u2014 connected with the family of Gordon. The first floor contains the dining-room, drawing-room, breakfast-room, the state bed-chamber, and dressing-room, and several other elegant apartments. The side-board is within the recess of the dining-room, separated by lofty Corinthian columns of Scagliola, in imitation of verd-antique marble. In this room are copies, by Angelica Kauffman, of Venus and Adonis, and of Danae, by Titian ; of Abraham and Hagar, of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, by Guercino ; of Dido and St. Cecilia, by Domenichino ; besides several portraits. In the draw ing-room is a portrait of the Duke of Gordon, by Raeburn; and of the Duchess, by Sir J. Reynolds; and some beautiful screens executed by the ladies. In the breakfast room is a copy, by A. Kauffman, of the celebrated St. Peter and St. Paul, the masterpiece of Guido Rheni, esteemed the most valuable in the Lam piori palace, at Bologna, and one ofthe best paintings in the world. The library is in the third, and the music room in the fourth floor, both directly over the dining-room, and ofthe same dimensions. The library contains several thousand volumes, and is furnished with geographical and astronomical instruments. There is a folio manuscript of the Vulgate Bible, and two MS. Missals, elegantly illuminated. There is also a MS. of Bernard Gordon's Lillium Medicin\u0153, with the date 1319, and the names of the copiers at the end. The most remarkable pictures at Gordon Castle, are a full-length of James the Sixth, by Mytens. At the time of the Revolution, the mob had taken it out of Holyrood House, and were kicking it about the streets, when the chancellor, the Earl of Finlater, happening to pass by, redeemed it out of their hands.

The drive through the Pleasure Grounds, entering at the East Lodge, and going out at the West, is about four miles. The approach to the Castle is over a very beautiful Gothic bridge, about two hundred yards long, having at each end of it an arch to pass under. The Grounds towards the Sea have the appearance of being protected by a regular Fortification, and are so, in fact, by a Battery of fourteen heavy guns. To the north-east of the Castle are extensive walls, with embrasures extending some hundred yards, built on rocks many hundred feet high ; the effect of which is singular and grand. The Ter races in front of the Castle are covered with the most beautiful climbers : there are also myrtles, eighteen feet high. The Gardens are of great extent, the Kitchen Garden consisting of about six acres, and the Flower Gardens and Shrubberies very beautiful and judiciously laid out. The Conservatories and Forcing Houses are numerous, and of every description. About a mile from the House is a fresh-water Lake, which is covered with every species of wild fowl ; upon the borders of it, is a beautiful Poultry Cottage, and Houses for the accommodation of every sort of bird, of which there is preserved a fine and rare collection. The house for small birds alone, built of stone, is seventy feet long. The Coast presents a beautiful mass of rocks, intermixed with wood growing close to the edge of the sea. From the Castle, the Frith appears to be bounded on all sides by the most magnificent mountains. Opposite to it, is the island of Arran, about eighteen miles from the main land; further west, is Ailsa, an island of singular conical form, abounding in sea-fowl, and belonging to the Earl of Cassilis. The islands of Bute, Cumray, and Cantire, &c, and some of the high lands of Ireland, are also visible in clear weather. The remains of Turnberry Castle and Park, once the residence of King Robert the Bruce, from one of whose daughters the family of Cassilis inherit extensive property by marriage, is within three miles of Culzean Castle, and belongs to the Earl of Cassilis; and near the town of Maybole is a very old building called the College, the area of which is the ancient burial-place of the family.

This ancient and hereditary seat of the chieftains of the Macdonalds of Slate, has lately been rebuilt in a spacious and commodious manner by the present nobleman, under the direction, and from the designs, of Mr. Gillespie. No expense has been spared in completing the edifice, which may vie for extent and elegance with any mansion in this part of Great Britain. His Lordship appears not to have been unmindful of the necessary combination of architecture with the scenery in which it is placed, and has shewn his taste by the selection of a style admi rably adapted to the romantic wildness of the adjacent country, and indicative of the feudal potency of the progenitors of the family. It stands in the parish of Slate, in the south-eastern part of the island of Skye, one of the largest of the Hebrides, on a gentle elevation, near the sea, and opposite the main land. A house, however elegant in its decoration, if con structed upon the principles of classical architecture, must have lost its due effect in such a situation, backed by mountains whose lofty summits are covered with snow. Other hills of less elevation slope towards the sea, at the base of which stands Armidale, a castellated structure, having its grand entrance on the south ; each of the Fronts, shewn in our Views, are of irregular design, tower rising above tower, and connected by embattled walls of various heights. The principal apartments are on the east, and receive their light from windows mullioned with stone after the ancient style. Whenever his Lordship resides here, a degree of hospitality is exercised, which accords with the character of an ancient chief. The tenants, even on the most distant estates, on a late occasion, when the rents were reduced, testified in every possible way their attachment and high respect for his Lordship. The sea-coast is bold and rocky, and the Channel which separates the island from the main land of Scotland, is constantly enlivened by a variety of small vessels, chiefly employed in fishing, as well as by others of larger dimensions, which find a safe and commodious Harbour at Ornassay, a few miles distant from Armidale. At the Ferry of Glenelly, at the northern extremity of the Channel, the sea is not more than half a mile broad between the island and the nearest part of Inverness-shire on the main land. The Isle of Skye is a part of the Northern Highlands, and its extreme length is about sixty miles, its breadth about forty. The country is generally moun tainous, and some of the hills are so lofty as to be covered with snow on their tops all the year round. Their sides afford excellent pasturage for numerous flocks of sheep. The valleys are fertile, and the land towards the sea is level and arable, producing good crops. The cattle here are highly esteemed. The whole island is well watered by rivulets, abounding with trout and salmon : there are also a number of fresh- water lakes, well stored with trout and eels. A part of the island belongs to the Laird of Macleod, the rest is the property of Lord Macdonald, who also holds possession of North Uist, an island of the Hebrides, about twenty miles long, and about eighteen broad. Lord Macdonald is still acknowledged as the Chieftain of the Clan of the Macdonalds of Slate, and his Lordship, in the Gaelic language, is denominated, Mac Connel nan Eilan, by way of pre-eminence. The Clan wear a tuft of heath in their bonnets, as a badge of distinction, and used the \" Slogan Craig-na-fioch\" as a war-cry, during their feudal animosities. The present nobleman is lineally descended from Alexander Macdonald, Earl of Ross, successor and representative of the Macdonalds of the Isles, an aspiring family, who waged frequent wars with the kings of Scotland, and who acted as sovereigns themselves, obliging most of the Clans to swear fealty to them. Donald, who succeeded to this independent principality about 1380, married Mary Lesley, daughter of the Earl of Ross, and by her came the Earldom of o"], [238, "ARMIDALE, INVERNESS-SHIRE. Ross to the Macdonalds of Slate. After his succession, he was called Mac donald, Lord of the Isles, and Earl of Ross. Many families in the Western Islands hold their estates by grants from the Lords of the Isles, who conveyed them in charters extremely short, but suffi ciently binding, as in the following instance, which is, however, divested of the spirit and rhythm of the original: \" I Donald, Chief of the Macdonalds, give, here in my Castle, a Right to Mackay to Kilmahumag from this day till to-morrow, and so on for ever.\" The chieftains of this powerful family acted as sovereign and independent princes in their own country, and were sometimes treated as such by the kings of England and France. They were extremely formidable to the kings of Scotland, whom they frequently offended by their haughty conduct, but were at length reduced to submission by superior force. Sir Donald Macdonald, the sixteenth generation of this ancient family, was a loyal adherent of the unfortunate Charles I., who rewarded his services by creating him a Baronet, the 14th of July, 1625. In his patent of creation was inserted this remarkable clause : \" That he shall have precedency of all the for mer Baronets, Sir Robert Gordon only excepted.\" He died in 1645, at a time when he was actively engaged in the royal cause. His son, Sir James Mac donald, of Slate, the second Baronet, having assisted King Charles II. on his march into England, in 1651, retired, after the ruin of the royal cause, to his seat in the Isle of Skye. He is described as a man of abilities, great interest amongst his people, and of good intelligence abroad ; he died in 1678, and was succeeded by his son, Sir Donald, the third Baronet, who married the Lady Mary, daughter of Robert, Earl of Morton, by whom he had Sir Donald Mac donald, his successor, who attached himself to the interest of the Stuarts in 1715, and died in 1718, leaving an only son, who died unmarried in 1720. His uncle, Sir James Macdonald, of Oransay, succeeded him as the sixth Baronet, and died at Torres in 1723. His son, Sir Alexander Macdonald, of Slate, the seventh Baronet, succeeded, and was almost the only person of consideration, in the Western Isles, who did not join the Pretender's standard in 1745, and was of course in high favour with the Duke of Cumberland, who honoured him with his correspondence and friendly assurances of regard. He died suddenly, at Bernera, on his way to London, in November, 1 746, at the early age of thirty-six, leaving three sons, Sir James, Sir Alexander, and Sir Archibald. Sir James, the eldest son, the eighth Baronet, died at Rome, when on his travels, \u00e6t. twenty-five, in the year 1766; when Sir Alexander Macdonald succeeded as ninth Baronet, and was subsequently created Lord Macdonald of Slate. The youngest, Sir Archibald, was educated for the Bar, and became Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1793, which he resigned in 1813, when he was created a Baronet. Sir Alexander, the second son, who succeeded his brother as Lord Macdonald, originally held a commission in the FootGuards, and married Elizabeth Diana, the eldest daughter of Godfrey Bosville, Esq., of Gunthwaite, in Yorkshire, by Diana, eldest daughter of Sir William Wentworth, Bart., of Bretton, by whom he had Alexander Wentworth, the present nobleman, and General the Honor able Godfrey Macdonald, who, upon the death of his uncle, the late Colonel William Bosville, took the name of .Bosville, and succeeded to the estates of Gunthwaite and Thorpe Hall, in Yorkshire. Lord Macdonald having no chil dren, he is the presumptive heir to the title. The Macdonalds are known by the designation of Clan Coila, and bear, for ensign, a hand in armour, holding a cross crosslet fitche\" ; the reason assigned for which is, that one of their ancestors distin guished himself in propagating the Christian religion in Ireland, and civilizing the people.

It stands on a bank, pleasantly sloping south towards the Clyde, which river winds round the property for several miles, and is surrounded by very fine old timber. The estate of Carstairs originally belonged to a branch of the family of Lockhart, of Lee, and was sold by Sir George Lockhart, Bart., about the year 1760, to the late Mr. Fullerton, from whose son, Robert Fullerton, Esq. Governor of Prince of Wales Island, it was purchased, a few years ago, by the present proprietor, Henry Monteith, Esq. The former Mansion was above two hundred years old ; and having fallen into a state of complete decay, the present building has been erected on its site, from designs, and under the superintendence, of Mr. Burn, architect, Edinburgh. It is in the Tudor style of architecture, according to the taste displayed during the reign of Henry the Seventh. The designs for the House were selected from the best and most perfect examples of that period, and a Court of Stable Offices has been attached in a more simple form, but in a correspond ing style. The outer Hall is entered from the carriage porch, seen in the north-west view, and opens into a Gallery, eighty feet long, terminated by a very hand some staircase.

The family of Hay, of Drummelzier, is a younger branch of the noble family of Tweeddale in East Lothian. The first of this branch was the Honourable William Hay, second son of John, first Earl of Tweeddale, by Lady Margaret Montgomerie, daughter of Alexander, sixth Earl of Eglinton. He married the Honourable Elizabeth Seton, only daughter of Alexander, Viscount of Kingston, and was the great-grandfather of the present representative of this family, who married Miss Garston, daughter of Major Garston, by whom he has two daughters : one of his brothers was killed at the battle of Waterloo. William Hay, Esq. of Drummelzier, the proprietor of Dunse Castle, is Convener of the county of Berwick. The Barony and Castle of Drummelzier, which is now a ruin, are situated on the banks of the Tweed, at a great distance from Dunse Castle, that has long been the principal family residence. Dunse Castle is a large and venerable building : that portion of it particu larly, which forms the right side of our south-western view, is of so great antiquity as to have been a border fortress in the ages of our first Christian Scottish monarchs. When it was determined by the proprietor that an addi tion should be made, in preference to removing wholly the strong hold of his gallant feudal ancestors, the character of the new part was so planned as to harmonize in an admirable manner with the style of the old building. In pre serving this, Mr. Gillespie, the architect, has succeeded almost beyond prece dent ; and the Castle now presents, with its numerous irregular heights and projections, and with its lofty Towers, the appearance of strength, dignity, and durability, so suitable to its situation, its history, and to the hereditary respect in which its possessors have been held for many generations. The whole build ing is of a beautiful cream-coloured stone ; the ornaments, all carved in the same, are remarkably well executed. Placed on an elevated situation in a well -cultivated country, and backed by extensive forests of old and young wood, this Seat has the command of many beautiful and interesting prospects : the Park is large, clothed with much old wood, and greatly embellished by a fine piece of water about a mile in length, which separates the hill of Dunse Law from the Castle, and is one of the greatest ornaments of the view from that side of the building. The plantations consist, of about seven hundred acres, covering all the heights to the north and east of the house, and, when full-grown, will produce a rich and grand effect. A venerable straight avenue of lime-trees leads to the arched gateway, the usual entrance from the town of Dunse, about half a mile distant, the vista of which, terminated by the pointed arch, has a fine appearance from the oriel window of the dining-room : a second, but much longer avenue, intersecting the other at"], [246, "4 DUNSE CASTLE, BERWICKSHIRE. right angles, and stretching down the park for a considerable way, is to be the principal approach from the south and west, the gateway to which is not yet erected. The Gardens and Shrubberies are of great extent, and occupy the ground to the north-west of the Castle : the Green-houses and Hot-houses are upwards of four hundred feet in length. An excellent kennel, where Mr. Hay keeps an admirable pack of fox-hounds, is situated near the western extremity of the Park. Within, there is little of the regular arrangement of modern houses : the mas sive walls, solid oak-doors and panels, and heavy stone mullions of the windows, preserve the appearance of antiquity which might be expected from a view of the exterior. The grand Staircase is sixty feet in height, and ascends directly from the Hall of Entrance and Porch, leading to the principal floor : the niches and canopies are of the finest stone sculptured work. Here is a very handsome Vestibule supported by rich columns and pointed arches, from which the public rooms enter. Their proportions are \u2014 Drawing-room, forty-two feet by twenty four ; Dining room, forty feet by twenty-three ; Parlour, twenty-four feet by twenty ; a beautiful Boudoir, looking towards the lake, of fourteen feet by six ; and small Book-room, twenty feet square : the wood- work of all the rooms is of dark carved oak of the finest workmanship, and the roofs are richly adorned with bold mouldings. There is a Cloister of forty feet in length, terminated by a beautiful stained glass window of armorial bearings and other devices : the great mullioned window of the Staircase is about twenty-five feet high : the Library, which is on the floor above the other public rooms, is forty-four feet by twenty-four, lighted by a fine projecting oriel of stained glass. There are about thirty-six bed-rooms, and the Kitchen and servants' accommodation is most extensive, and admirably arranged. A large court of offices, containing distinct stables for carriage and riding horses, hunters, &c. is connected with the Castle to the north.

Ross Priory is situated on the southern shore of Loch Lomond, about nine miles from the county town of Dumbarton, and twenty from Cullenden, in Perthshire. The Mansion'was built at two different periods. The old house was erected in 1693, and consisted of a high-roofed building, with projecting wings. In 1812, the wings were taken away, and a large addition made to the body of the House, in the Gothic style, from a design of Gillespie. The House is entered by a massive Gothic staircase, leading to a hall, on both sides of which are the principal rooms; three of them are thirty -two feet by twenty-two. In the Dining-room are some good family portraits ; and a fine painting of Algernon Percy, by Vandyck ; also, an excellent original picture of the cele brated John, Duke of Lauderdale, K. G. and his Duchess. The situation of Ross Priory is well adapted for the ancient style of building. The approach is through an avenue of fine old oaks, nearly three quarters of a mile in length. There is, also, within the grounds, and on the banks of the Lake, another avenue, upwards of a mile and a half in length, the finest trees of which are beech. The House, being situated on a point which extends a considerable way into the Lake, commands different views of Loch Lomond from three sides. That towards the north is much the grandest, having the wooded islands in the fore ground, and a lofty range of distant mountains, the highest of which is Ben Lomond. Behind the House is the Garden, coeval with the oldest part of the building. It is still surrounded and intersected with high yew hedges, according to the taste of that period when the Mansion was originally built; some of these have attained an uncommon size, being upwards of eight feet broad. At a short distance from the House, upon a point of land, formed on one side by a small picturesque bay, and on the other by a stream falling into the Lake, is situated the Family Burial-place, surrounded by dark and lofty pines, and fine old chestnuts.

This noble Mansion was commenced in the year 1803, about a hundred yards west from the old House, which was burnt to the ground in the beginning of the previous year. The design was given by Bonomi, and is in the best style of Italian architecture : the splendid portico of Ionic columns, represented in the view, forms a covered entrance for carriages ; the southern front of the building is embellished with a large bow, round which are columns of equal size, and of the same order, as those here seen. The whole edifice constitutes, perhaps, the most chaste and correct specimen of its style in the kingdom, and its magnitude gives great dignity and splendour to the building. From the circular tower there is a most extensive, varied, and delightful prospect. The interior is arranged with a degree of elegance seldom surpassed : the Vestibule and Gallery are about one hundred and eighty feet in length ; the principal public rooms, thirty-six by twenty- two feet ; of these there are six or seven on the first floor, besides Billiard-room, Entrance-hall, and minor Apartments ; but the whole is not yet completed. The surrounding scenery, of which Roseneath forms a distinguished orna ment, consists of fine arms of the sea stretching up into the land in every direction, and many headlands, together with wooded banks, fringing the coast. The House stands on a rising ground, having the sea only a hundred yards from the south front : a rich wood of lofty trees surrounds it on the west and part of the north sides, and, to the eastward, are extensive gardens and pleasure grounds. The view from the southern windows embraces very fine wooded scenery, varied by peeps of the sea, and a range of distant blue mountains merging into the horizon, of a grand and broken outline. We have already taken some notice of the family of Campbell in our description of Inverary Castle. The present, and sixth Duke of Argyll, resides principally at his seats in England or at Inverary Castle; his Grace married the daughter of George Villiers, fourth Earl of Jersey: and his Grace's only brother, Lord John Campbell, married, in 1820, Miss Glassell, of Long Niddry, in East Lothian. Roseneath is the most westerly parish of the ancient shire of Lenox, now Dumbartonshire, being a Peninsula, nearly in the form of a parallelogram, about seven miles long and two broad, formed by Loch Long, an arm of the sea, on the west, by the Frith of Clyde on the south, by Loch Gair on the east, and united on the land side to the parish of Row. Its surface exhibits a con tinued ridge of rising ground, without hill or mountain, although some parts are rocky. The soil is various, and, on the coast, well cultivated ; but the higher grounds are covered with heath. The coast is partly sandy, partly rocky, and abounds with fish.

Kenmount possesses a remarkably romantic situation, on the summit of a woody eminence, a considerable rivulet winding at its base, and surrounded on every side by a landscape, resembling that introduced in the grand and striking productions of that excellent painter, Salvator Rosa. This beautiful spot is on what is termed the Scottish Border in that division of the county which, lying on the banks of the river Annan, is called Annandale, and stands on the right of the great road leading from Annan to Dumfries. Kenmount was an ancient seat of the family of Douglas, of Kilhead ; but since the accession to the Marquessate, it has been enlarged, and a superior style of elegance and accommodation imparted to the apartments : a degree of boldness and originality is also exhibited in the design of the exterior, executed under the direction of Robert Smirke, Esq., a gentleman whose talents have placed him in the foremost rank in his profession. The elevation is modern, entered by a portico of the Doric order ; but when viewed in some points, it has the aspect and solidity of an ancient castle, towering above a most luxuriant wood of every different tint : it commands to the north a rich and open country, with a back-ground of lofty hills ; on the south, the broad bosom of the Solway Frith stretches itself to the coast of Cumberland on the opposite shore, forming a grand termination to the beautiful and romantic scene. From the almost continual warfare, which formerly subsisted between the two rival nations of North and South Britain, the borders of each were conti nually exposed to the incursions of the opposite foe ; hence agriculture became neglected, as yielding too precarious a produce : flocks and herds then formed the chief source of their wealth, the means of their subsistence, and the chief object of their pursuit. Different views are now entei tained by the wealthy proprietors of the estates in this part of the kingdom ; and no spot has more benefited by the change of sentiment, than the stewarty of Annandale, which now displays a rich and fertile aspect. . No family in the united kingdom can boast a higher descent than that of the noble Marquess, the possessor of Kenmount. The Douglases have not only formed alliances with the first families of Europe, but matched no less than eleven times with the royal house of Scotland, and can count, not only Dukes of that kingdom, but of Turenne, Counts of Longueville, Marshals of France, &c. This noble house became conspicuous in Scotland about the year 770; and the progenitor, having obtained a great victory for his sovereign, was rewarded with the lands of Douglas, in the county of Lanark, whence originated the name. From the elder branch descended William de Douglas, created Lord de Douglas by Malcolm Canmore, in 1057 5 and from him sprung William Lord Douglas, who lost his life, A. D. 1415, at the battle of Agincourt : he was the ancestor of the Dukes of Queensberry, and of the present Marquess, who is lineally descended from Sir William Douglas, of Kilhead, created a Baronet in 1668, the second son of William, first Earl of Queensberry : his Lordship was married, in 1803, to Lady Caroline, daughter of the Duke of Buccleuch.

The estate is in a high state of cultivation : its surface is beautifully diversified with lofty swelling knolls, level meadows, and woody eminences, being almost enveloped in natural wood, a circumstance not uncommon in this part of the country ; the hills in the neighbourhood afford pasture to innumerable sheep and black cattle, and have a verdant aspect. An inexhaustible quarry of limestone, discovered on the estate about the year 1795, has proved very beneficial to agriculture ; the use of it, as manure, being of the most material advantage, it has been the means of directing the attention of the landholders to cultivation rather than to pasturage. The river Nith, which gives name to the district, is a considerable stream, taking its rise in Ayrshire, and, continuing a winding course towards the south east, receives, within a few miles of Barjarg, the tributary waters of the Scarr and Cairn, and falls into the Solway Frith below Dumfries, where its estuary forms the harbour. It is celebrated for the excellence of its trout, and, near the sea, abounds with salmon. A few miles distant is the ruin of Eccles, near which is a memorial erected to one of the Percys, slain in an engagement with the rival family of Douglas ; the slaughter in this battle was so dreadful, that tradition records that a streamlet in its vicinity ran with blood for twenty-four hours. Closeburn Castle, another ruin, is considered the oldest remain of the kind in the south of Scotland.

The front has an extremely handsome appearance ; the outline being much varied by the different heights and projections of the towers and embattled walls. The apartments are suitable to the extent of the housej and some of them are particularly worthy of examination, for their beauty and proportions. There are several excellent family portraits preserved at Wishaw ; one of Sir James Balfour, Lord Lyon, king of arms in the reign of King Charles I., by Vandyck, is reckoned a very valuable painting. There is also a picture of John, Lord Belhaven, who, in the reign of Queen Anne, made so strenuous an opposition to the treaty of Union. The territorial possessions of this family, in the county of Lanark, are very ancient. The Peerage of Belhaven and Stenton was conferred on Sir John Hamilton, of Biel, in the county of Haddington, by Charles I., in 1647- The patent was surrendered to the Second Charles, in 1695, and regranted by his Majesty, with further remainders.

The Mouse, a very romantic stream, falls into the Clyde a little below Lanark, between Lee and that town. The celebrated rocks, called the Cartland Craigs, are upon this river ; and over it, at that spot, a bridge has recently been erected from a design by Mr. Telford. The height from the bed of the river to the parapet, is one hundred and twenty-five feet ; the rocks, however, are of much greater elevation, and may be termed the grandest to be seen in this country. The alterations at Lee Place, which give it a castellated appearauce, were commenced by Sir Charles Lockhart, Bart, a few years ago, from the designs of Mr. Gillespie Graham, an architect, who has the merit of introducing the Gothic style into this country, in a greater degree of purity.and perfection than had previously been exhibited. The Hall, in the centre of the building, rises to the full height of the tower, and is lighted by twelve windows. The adjoining suite of the principal rooms is extremely handsome, and they are all spacious and well-proportioned.

Taymouth, formerly called Balloch, was acquired by Sir Colin Campbell, of Glenurquhay, Knight of Rhodes, about the year 1480; from him is lineally descended the present Peer, whose ancestor was created Earl of Breadalbane and Holland, by King Charles II. , in 1677- Sir Colin was younger son of Sir Duncan Campbell, of Lochow ; and from Archibald, the eldest son, is descended the family of the Duke of Argyll, chief of the name of Campbell. Balloch Castle was built by Colin, sixth Laird of Glenurquhay, who died in it, April 7th, 1583. \u2014 No part of the old fabric remained, except the wings, which were lately removed. The present mansion is originally a design of Elliot, (architect of the Regent's bridge, &c.) since greatly altered and improved by the taste of Lord Breadalbarte. It was commenced about the beginning of this century, and consists of a great quadrangle, with a circular tower at each corner, and a large and lofty lantern tower in the centre. To this building an eastern wing, extending 180 feet, con taining the offices, has recently been added ; and the western one is to contain the library, conservatory, and family apartments. The front of the whole edifice will extend upwards of 430 feet. Our View represents the front of the eastern wing, and the side of the main body of the building. An arched cloister goes round the exterior of three sides, and the stone tracery and ornaments are exe cuted with great lightness and beauty. On entering, the visitor passes through a hall, the lowness of which tends to increase the effect produced by the Grand Staircase, to which he immediately proceeds, rising to the full height of the central tower, and embellished in the richest style of florid Gothic architecture, copied from Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster. This superb stair is lighted from above by long pointed windows in the upper part of the tower ; and below, open galleries lead to the rooms in the higher stories. The stair in the centre leads, by two divisions, to the landing-place, from whence the door of the great Drawing-room opens in the middle : at the one end of the landing-place is the door of the Ante-chamber, which connects the small Drawing-room with the Baronial-hall. The door at the opposite end leads to the interior staircase, con ducting to the galleries and rooms above, and to a smaller ante-room, forming a communication between the Dining-room and great Drawing-room. The win dows in the centre tower are filled with stained glass, representing various parts of the family armorial bearings, taken from ancient authorities. Their softened tint is particularly beautiful, reflecting various colours on the rich ornaments, and harmonizing with the dignity and grand features of the lofty edifice. The suit of state apartments is extensive, and magnificently furnished ; some of the public rooms are of great size. The Baronial-hall is a very splendid apartment : at one end is a large mullioned window, representing, in stained glass, the present Earl and Countess, in the centre ; and, in the different side compartments, the effigies of the successive Knights and Barons of Glenur quhay, descended from Sir Colin, each having painted on his shield his own proper heraldic bearings. Other devices, in the same style, occupy the small divisions in the upper part ; all of which are taken from an illuminated manu script, on vellum, in Lord Breadalbane's possession, containing an account of several successive proprietors of the family, and representations of each.

The first Earl died in and the third and late Earl, in his 86th Taymouth is situated in a delightful valley of the Highlands, and is, perhaps, the grandest residence in Scotland. The deer-park is very extensive, and is covered with fine old trees, particularly the celebrated avenue of majestic limes, nearly a mile in length, the vista of which is like the regular and continued arches of a Gothic cathedral. At the village of Kenmore, a mile from Taymouth, commences Loch Tay, extending nearly sixteen miles : on the north trunk of the Lake rises Ben Lawers, 4050 feet above the level of the sea, and Ben More, nearly the same height, both the property of this noble family. Lord Breadalbane's estate is about 100 miles in length ; and before the abo lition of heritable jurisdiction, the power of the family was immense, as the valleys are very fertile and populous. In 1819, Taymouth was visited by Prince Leopold, who was received with a royal salute from the fort ; and Lord Breadalbane having summoned part of his vassals to appear before him, in honour of the illustrious visitor, about two thousand men assembled before the Castle, instill Highland costume, and, after going through various evolutions, formed into detachments, and retired by dif ferent avenues to the sound of their respective pibrochs. It was truly an inter esting and magnificent spectacle ; and it must have been a proud sight to Lord Breadalbane to see his clansmen gathering around him before the seat of his ancestors ; not assembling, as in their days, for war and carnage, but in more auspicious times, full of joy and peace, calling down blessings on a mild and generous chieftain. Lord Breadalbane married, in 1793, Mary, daughter and heiress of David Gavin, of Laughton, in Berwickshire, by Lady Elizabeth Maitland, sister of James, the present and eighth Earl of Lauder dale, K.T. Their only son, John Viscount Glenorchy, married, in November 1821, Eliza, eldest daughter of George Baillie, Esq., of Jerviswoode and Mellerstain, in Berwickshire, grandson, in the male line, of Charles Lord Binning, eldest son of the sixth Earl of Haddington.

This romantic retreat is situated about sixteen miles from Dunkeld, near the centre of the county of Perth, and at no great distance from the river Tumel, which flows through the most splendid and picturesque scenery of Scotland, and presents in this vicinity some of the most beautiful combinations of wood, rock, and water. The proprietor of this estate has clothed many of the hills, formerly bare, with thriving plantations of oak and larch, which, with the native birch and hazel, form a delightful variety of foliage : he has not planted less than two or three millions of trees. The House, which our view represents, is a modern building, erected about twenty years ago, at some distance from the old seat of the family, which had been accidentally burnt. There was originally intended to have been a much larger building, situated nearer the river, for which the present house was to have formed the court of offices ; but the idea having been abandoned, it was completed as a dwelling-house, and its appearance harmonizes extremely well with the romantic scenery that surrounds it on every side. The celebrated Pass of Killicrankie, the scene of the battle in which Lord Dundee fell, is within a short distance of Bonskeid : the river Garry unites with the Tumel at the foot of the Pass, and a fine fall of the latter river forms a dis tinguished feature in the grounds. We extract the following highly descriptive paragraph from the Guide to the Scenery of Dunkeld and Blair Athol : \" A walk by the side of the Garry, entering from a gate near the end of the bridge, leads to this cascade. If the visitor returns to the same point, he should take a new path to the left, which conducts over a wooded eminence, displaying a most magnificent and unexpected view of the Pass of Killicrankie. But from the fall of the Tumel he has another choice of walk, which he should by no means neglect. This is the course of the river upwards to the House of Bon skeid ; presenting a continued succession, for nearly two miles, of river scenery of an uncommon and new character. The rocky and brawling bed of the Tumel is here, in itself, beautiful throughout, and often disposed so as to form pictu resque rapids, with bold and precipitous deep banks, formed of rocks and wood intermixed, and in a state of the highest natural ornament. The whole is enclosed, on both sides, within these wild and romantic woods, where ancient and fine trees often overhang the water, so as to produce frequent and marked changes of character ; while some distant glimpse of the impending rocky and wooded mountains, or the descent of their picturesque declivities to the river's margin, adds to the general variety, so as to produce a succession of landscapes, of characters strongly marked, and not less strongly distinguished from each other. Where an occasional glimpse of that battlemented house is caught, its effect is extremely striking, and adds considerably to the interest of this wild scenery.\" Bonskeid has long belonged to the present family of Stewart, and has received valuable additions, by the purchase of contiguous estates, since it came into the possession of the present proprietor. His ancestor, Alex. Steivart de Bonskeid, is designated frater germanus Nigelli Stewart de Fothergill et Garth, an. 1494, in a charter, existing. Nigellus was illegitimately descended of Alexander, Earl of Buchan, fourth son of King Robert II. : the Earl is buried in the choir of the cathedral church of Dunkeld; and over his tomb is a recumbent figure in armour, rudely cut in stone, and bearing the legend, Hic jacet Dominus Alex.

This beautiful residence, which combines so many natural advantages of situa tion with the embellishments of art and taste, is situated in the upper part of Strathearn, not far from the village of Crieff. There is probably no distance in Scotland, of equal length, which presents greater variety and beauty of scenery, than the twelve miles which separate Crieff and the foot of Loch Erne at Saint Fillans : the rapid Erne flows near the road the greater part of the way, and from its banks the hills rise in picturesque and broken outlines, for the most part covered with wood, and appearing at every turn in some new and beautiful combination. The situation of Ochtertyre commands the most delightful and extensive prospect of the splendid scenery to which allusion has been made. The rich verdure of the Park, with the Lake and ruined Tower, form a fine contrast with the deep shadows of the remoter forest, leading the eye to the magni ficent termination of the western prospect, formed by the towering mountains of Ben Vorlich and Stuck-na-chroan. The deer park and domain of Ochtertyre comprise a very great extent of ground, beautifully diversified, covered with woods of ancient growth, and intersected by drives and walks of very consi derable length : the first alone consists of about twenty-five miles. The river Turret, a mountain stream, forms the north and east boundary of the grounds, from which the Grampian mountains stretch towards Breadalbane. The house of Ochtertyre was erected by the late Sir William Murray, about forty years since, and is a commodious and excellent family mansion ; contain ing some spacious apartments, and various portraits of the ancestry of the family. Its unpretending style of architecture certainly does not fully cor respond with what the beauty of the adjacent scenery might justly merit ; but the owner has rather deferred the improvements, which a short period at any time can effect, and has very greatly improved the park and grounds by plantations and other decorations of nature, which time only can mature. In the hollow, immediately below the house, is a beautiful sheet of water, called the Loch of Monzievaird, on the bank of which stands a ruined tower or keep, the remains of a very ancient fortress, supposed to have been built in the thirteenth century, by the powerful family of Cummin of Badenoch. In the first charter of Ochtertyre, to the Murray family, dated in 1467, this build ing is described, Antiquum Fortalicium. This ancient family derives its origin from the noble house of Tullibardine, now represented by the Duke of Athol. Patrick, third son of Sir David Murray, sixth Baron of Tullibardine, acquired the estate of Ochtertyre, and died in 1476. \u2014 The dignity of a Baronet of Nova Scotia was granted by King Charles IL, in 1673, to William Murray of Ochtertyre, the sixth in descent from the above Patrick. The present proprietor is the thirteenth in descent, in the direct male line, from the first possessor of the estate. He married, in 1794, the Lady Mary Hope, daughter of John, Earl of Hopetoun ; by whom he has a numerous family. Sir Patrick is one of the Barons of the Scottish Court of Exchequer, and was for two parliaments the representative of the city of Edinburgh. His brother, the Right Honourable Sir George Murray, G.C.B., is justly celebrated in the military annals of the country ; the distinguished merit which marked his services in the Peninsular war, while discharging the arduous duties of Quarter-Master-General, is well known, and fully appreciated by the nation."], [267, ""], [268, "jMIBEISTLE, fifesb I * \u2014 \u2014 = \u25a0 . -. ______=__==___=^=====_==______ _=_=___ , I!

Donibristle is situated five miles from North Queensferry, close to the Frith of Forth, the large arm of the sea which separates Fifeshire from the shores of the Lothians. The House has been erected at various periods : the oldest part was the residence of the Abbots of the neighbouring priory of St. Colme, situated on Inch Colme, now in the possession of this noble family, which, with its beautiful ecclesiastical ruins, forms a fine object from Donibristle. The House was modernized, and very much improved, by the late Earl of Moray, and, though plain, is a most convenient family residence. The large Drawing room may be particularly mentioned, as an apartment of the most elegant description and correct proportions, about fifty feet in length, and thirty high ; commanding a delightful prospect of the Frith, ever enlivened by the vessels that crowd its surface ; and, during stormy weather, exhibiting many scenes of sublimity and grandeur. In the Dining-room, besides family portraits, there is a fine full-length portrait by Vandyck, of King Charles I. with the Duke of Hamilton holding his horse. The Park of Donibristle is of great extent, and finely wooded ; the surface is undulating and much varied, and the finest views of the Frith and surrounding country are obtained from different stations in the Grounds. The romantic metropolis of Scotland, seen on the opposite side of the Frith, at the distance of eight or nine miles, is a most splendid object, from its bold and commanding situation, and beautiful irregularity of outline ; the whiteness of the new parts of the town, contrasted with the dark and antique character of the old, the latter in general greatly obscured by smoke, and the venerable Castle, towering over the lower buildings, forms an unrivalled termination of the prospect to the south east; while the lofty ridge of the Pentland Hills forms a fine background to the rich shores of Mid Lothian, which lie more directly opposite to Donibristle. The approach from the east gate, at Aberdour, is about three miles in length, and commands delightful views ofthe richly wooded shores of the Frith: the Park of Dalmeny, belonging to the Earl of Roseberry, on the opposite side, embellishes the prospect ; while the domains of Dundas and Hopetoun adorn the distance. The title of Earl of Moray, formerly in the houses of Randolph and Dunbar, was granted in 1561, by Queen Mary to her brother, the Regent of Scotland, who was the first Earl of the present family of Stuart. That gallant and unfortunate nobleman was assassinated at Linlithgow by Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh,in 1570; a fact commemorated by one of our greatest poets, in the beautiful ballad of Cadyow. The Earl left two daughters, the eldest of whom Lady Elizabeth, married Lord Doune (who became second Earl of Moray) descended in the male line from Robert, Duke of Albany, Regent of Scotland, third son of King Robert II. The present, and eleventh Earl of Moray of the family of Stuart, is lineally descended, in the direct line of male succession, from the above marriage of the Regent's daughter, Lady Elizabeth. His father, Francis, tenth Earl, married the Honourable Jane Gray, daughter of John, twelfth Lord Gray. \u2014 The Earl of Moray is Lord Lieutenant of the county of Elgin, or Moray, where his seat of Darnaway Castle is situated. His Lordship married, first, in 1795, Lucy second daughter of General Scott, of Balcombie, (sister of the Duchess of Portland, and Mrs. Canning) by whom he has two sons, Francis, Viscount Doune, and the Honourable John Stuart. His Lordship married, secondly, in 1801, his cousin, Margaret Jane, eldest daughter of Sir Philip Ainslie, of Pilton, by whom he has the Hon.

Our view represents the magnificence of the surrounding mountains : the lofty Schichallion towers, to the height of four thousand feet, directly opposite the castle ; and the other possessions of the family are partly seen beyond, till concealed by the woods \u2014 but, in fact, stretching from the centre of the island, almost to the Atlantic shores. The extreme length of the estate of Strowan is nearly fifty miles, part of which, the Sleisgarrow, Rannoch, and Glenerrochy, are thickly peopled, from whence the chiefs have, on many occasions, brought out several hundred Robertsons ready for active service. The inhabitants are a brave, free, and warlike people ; and still wear the tartan kilt, the ancient national costume, which shews, to the greatest advantage, the gracefulness and manly strength of their form. The late Duncan Robertson, of Strowan, married a daughter of William, second lord Nairne, son of John, Marquis of Athol, and of lady Amelia, Anne, Sophia Stanley, daughter of James, seventh earl of Derby. Their son is the present chief, and their only daughter was married to her cousin, Laurence Oliphant, Esq. of Gask.

The grandson of the above Laurence Oliphant, Esq., is the representative of that illustrious and ancient family. The present proprietor of the estate of Strowan, was restored to the inherit ance of his ancestors about thirty years ago ; and, in the beginning of this century, the present mansion, Mount Alexander, was commenced. It had been so named by his predecessor, the poet Strowan, whose favourite residence it had long been. The style of the building is simply that of a massive square tower, from which extensive wings stretch out. The two principal public rooms are thirty feet by twenty, and there is a great number of spacious bed rooms. The pictures principally consist of family portraits. The view is not deficient in representing the sublimity of the surrounding scenery : the mountain torrent, just escaped from its parent Loch Rannoch, roars past the castle, dashing over an infinite succession of rocky obstructions. Near the western extremity of Loch Rannoch, and fifteen miles from Mount Alexander, is the usual residence of the present chief. 10."], [274, "2 &ttmt Halaee, Pnrtfjslnre ; THE RESIDENCE OF THE EARL OF MANSFIELD. The palace of Scone is situated on the banks of the Tay, about two miles from the city of Perth. It was a favourite residence of the Scottish monarchs ; and the abbey was the scene of their coronations for many ages : the celebrated stone on which they sat, was carried from Scone by Edward I. of England, and is still preserved in the coronation chair in Westminster Abbey. For a full and very interesting account of this regal memorial, see \" Neale's History of Westminster Abbey.\" At the Reformation, the palace and abbey of Scone were destroyed ; but the former was restored about the commencement of the seventeenth century. In it king Charles II. was crowned in 1651, ten years before his coronation at Westminster : and here James VIII. (Chevalier de St. George) was also crowned in 1715, when he attempted to recover the throne of his ancestors. Since these times, Scone has not been the scene of royal pageantry ; and in 1803 the old palace was removed by the present earl, who has erected in its stead a splendid mansion, designed by Mr. Atkinson, which was finished in 1806. The length of its east and west fronts is two hundred and twenty feet ; and the north and south sides extend one hundred and thirty. The great Entrance is in the east part, and the visitor will be highly gratified with a view of the noble proportions and splendid decorations of many of its apartments ; particularly the Saloons, the Dining-room, the Great Drawing room, the Library, and Music-room, in which are many rare curiosities, and valuable paintings \u2014 but of these we can only particularize the portraits of King Charles I. by Vandyck; the Marquess of Montrose; the great Lord Mans field, by Sir J. Reynolds ; the present Earl and his Countess, by Sir T. Law rence ; and one of the late Earl, his Lordship's father. The great Stair leads to the bed-rooms above, some of which are splendidly furnished. The state bed is of crimson damask, with the full royal arms of Britain embroidered in gold at the top and head. This bed was presented by George III. to the late earl. In an adjoining room is a bed in which queen Mary slept, worked by herself ; and in another, one which was used by her son, James VI.: in these apartments there are several curious portraits of the royal house of Stuart. In the cloister between the gallery and corridor, are full length portraits of George III. and queen Charlotte, by Ramsay ; and some ancient coats of arms cut in stone, and built into the wall. \u2014 Scone contains about one hundred and twenty-five rooms ; and it is said that ninety of these are bed-rooms. In the Library is the woolsack used by the Lord Chief Justice Mansfield in the House of Lords. The situation of Scone is magnificent.

This Castle is situated close to the city of Brechin, on the north bank of the river Esk. The building is of considerable antiquity, but has been erected at different times, and contains many handsome apartments. The situation is truly grand, and the views from the windows are beautifully varied. Most of the trees are of an uncommon size. It was long the favourite residence of the Maules, Earls of Panmure, whose lineal representative is the present possessor. Sir Peter de Maulia, the direct ancestor of this noble family, married Christian, daughter and sole heiress of Sir William de Valoniis, Lord Great Chamberlain of Scotland, who died in 1254. His descendant, Patrick Maule, was created Lord Maule of Brechin and Navar, and Earl of Panmure, by King Charles I., August 3rd, 1646. He attended his majesty in all his battles ; was confined in Carisbrooke Castle ; and, after the king's death, was fined ten thousand pounds by Oliver Cromwell for his loyalty to his unfortunate sovereign. James, the fourth Earl, having appeared in arms for the House of Stuart in 1715, was outlawed, and his title forfeited. His nephew and successor William, was, in 1743, created Earl of Panmure, of Forth, in the county of Wexford, in Ireland ; and, on his death, in 1782, George, eighth Earl of Dalhousie, succeeded to the immense entailed estates of his uncle, the Earl of Panmure. From him they descended to his second son, the Hon. William Ramsay, in virtue of Lord Panmure's entail. Brechin Castle is large, and is built on the brink of a perpendicular rock overhanging the Esk, a little to the south of the town. It underwent a long siege in 1303, against the English army under Edward I., and, notwithstanding every effort of that monarch, it held out for twenty days, till the brave Governor, Sir Thomas Maule, was killed by a stone thrown from an engine ; when the place immediately surrendered. Brechin is a royal borough, and was formerly a bishopric, founded in 1150 by David I., and very richly endowed ; the Cathedral of the Diocese, though sadly mutilated, still remains. The town is prettily situated, and the country around is highly cultivated, and considerably diversified. It is eight miles from Montrose. Another chief seat of the family is at Panmure, near the Castle of that name, about ten or twelve miles from Brechin. Most of the Family Portraits are preserved at Panmure House. The present possessor is next brother of Lieutenant-General George, present and ninth Earl of Dalhousie, G. C. B. Governor-General of British America, a nobleman deservedly distinguished in his country's service. His Lordship is one of the most extensive landed proprietors in the north of Scotland. He is said to possess twenty-five thousand cultivated acres, the annual value of which, at reduced prices, averages nearly two pounds per acre. He long represented the County of Angus in Parliament, but was, at the Coronation of his Majesty, William IV., raised to his present dignity, thereby reviving the ancient name of Panmure, by which this family were originally distinguished. 3"], [278, "4 \u00a3ortacf)g \u0152astle, \u00a9r, dFovUr$t)ivt ; THE SEAT OF THE EARL OF AIRLEY.

The old garden is curious, and the trees in the immediate vicinity of Cortachy are of considerable size and beauty. The old Castle has received various alterations under the direction of the present noble proprietor; and some of the interior improvements are not yet completed. The number of apartments in the mansion is about forty. The dining and drawing rooms are twenty-five feet square, and very high in the ceiling. There are many family portraits at Cortachy ; and among them one of David, Lord Ogilvy, who was attainted for adhering to the House of Stuart, in 1745. Several of the portraits are by Jamieson. The grounds around Cortachy are highly embellished, and there are various handsome bridges in the approach to the house. Lord Airley has several other seats in this county. His brother, the Hon. Donald Ogilvy, is proprietor of the estates of Balnaboth, in Angus, and Balbegno, in Kincardineshire, both of large extent. Cluny Castle, on an island in a lake of the same name,' near Dunkeld, in Perthshire, is a seat of Lord Ogilvy ; and was the birth-place of the Admirable Crichton.

The Mansion of Ardgowan was built by Sir John Shaw Stewart, uncle of the present proprietor, at the beginning of this century, from a design by Cairn cross. It stands near an ancient tower, which formed part of the old House, and indeed is the only part of it now in existence. The present House is a handsome square building with wings, containing a Saloon, thirty feet square, leading to the principal Staircase, which is spacious and handsomely orna mented: there are, besides, on the First Floor, four principal rooms, and three suites of Bed-rooms, each having two Dressing-rooms ; the Second Floor con tains a large Sitting-room, and a number of Bed-rooms ; the third is wholly laid out in Bed-rooms. The Billiard-room is on the Ground Floor, and opens upon the lawn. The whole forms a most commodious family residence. Ardgowan is in the parish of Innerkip, and six miles south-west of Greenock. The situation of the House is truly magnificent. Elevated on a beautiful terrace overhanging the Frith of Clyde, it commands a most extensive marine prospect, enlivened by numerous vessels passing to and from Glasgow and the other ports of the Clyde ; adding to the finest natural objects, the activity of commerce and enterprising mercantile spirit \u2014 which must be a subject of exultation to every patriotic mind. There are many fine views from the vicinity of Ardgowan, but much the finest is that represented in the copper-plate, where the magnifi cent broken outline of the mountains of Arran is contrasted with the pastoral features of Bute and the Cumbrays, and all embraced in one grand prospect. The meaning of Arran is said to be high ground, which corresponds with the character of the whole island : the highest point is the mountain of Goatfell, three thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea, and meaning, in the Gaelic language, the hill of wind. Its fine peaked and alpine character is viewed from Ardgowan to peculiar advantage ; and at some times, when partially obscured by the mists or light clouds floating round its summit, these rugged and picturesque points seem to pierce the skies, and present a prospect of un rivalled grandeur. The present family have been several centuries in possession of the estate of Ardgowan : their original ancestor was Sir John Stewart, of Blackhall, a natural son of King Robert III., the great-grandson of the celebrated hero King Robert Bruce. By matrimonial alliance, they succeeded to the estates of Greenock, &c. in the possession of the ancient family of Shaw of Sauchie, represented by the present Baronet ; and the name of Shaw is now borne in addition to that of Stewart. Sir Michael Shaw Stewart has done much, by planting, &c, for the improvement and embellishment of his very extensive estates. He married Catherine, daughter of Sir William Maxwell, Bart., of Springkell, and has a numerous family. The eldest son bears the surname of Nicolson, in terms of the entail of the estate of Carnock in Stirlingshire, of which he is possessed. Sir Michael is the fifth Baronet of his family. In 1822, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff of the county of Renfrew, on the resignation of Lord Blantyre. 11."], [282, "2 Mgtljstoootr, Ucnfrnusfmc : THE SEAT OF ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL, ESQ.

The vale of Stratherne extends from Loch Erne on the north-west, along the course of the river Erne eastward, until it joins the estuary of the Tay near Abernethy : thus comprising a district about thirty miles in length, watered by many tributary streams of the Erne, and sheltered by the Grampian moun tains on the north and west, and by the Ochill hills on the south. Most parts of this tract of country are uncommonly rich and valuable, more particularly near the banks of the rivers ; and the high grounds are for the most part covered with woods and pasturage. The whole vale is filled with the seats of nobility and gentry. Stratherne was formerly an Earldom, enjoyed by the powerful family of Moray. In 1799, Prince Edward was created Duke of Kent and Stratherne, by his royal Father ; but the titles became extinct on his death in 1820. Abercairney Abbey forms a splendid feature in the middle part of Stratherne, and is a principal attraction to the environs of Crieff. It is a very rich and chaste specimen of ancient florid architecture, originally designed by Crichton, assisted by the cultivated taste of the proprietor : the late additions and com pletion of the plans are from the designs of Messrs. Dicksons of Edinburgh, Mr. Crichton's successors. The View gives such a correct representation of the south and west sides of the Mansion, as to supersede the necessity of par ticular description. On the right are the carriage stables, with an open cloister without the screen wall, and the lofty Clock-tower ; to the left, a magnificent Conservatory extends from the great Gallery. The Porch is particularly hand some ; and the stone of which the house is built is of a light gray colour, uniting durability with beauty \u2014 so tastefully exhibited in the design and execu tion of this superb fabric. The interior is arranged on a most convenient plan, and is likewise calcu lated to convey a great idea of magnificence. On entering, must be remarked the fine antique furniture of the hall, the high-backed ebony chairs, the massive slabs of oak, marble, and stone ; and the armorial banners of this ancient family, Barons of Drumsargath, often firmly defended in the field of battle, and now hanging undisturbed in the Mansion of the representative of their gallant pos sessors. To the left is a Cloister, or Gallery, one hundred and fifteen feet in length, with rich architectural ornaments, and splendid windows of stained glass. From the Cloister the principal apartments enter, consisting of great and small Drawing-rooms, (the first fifty feet long, the other twenty-two feet square ;) and the Library, which enters from the end of the gallery, and is in length forty feet by twenty-seven ; from this there is a communication to the Conservatory, which is sixty-two feet by twenty-two, forming a suite of ninety feet. The Dining-room, forty feet by twenty-three, is on the right of the Hall of Entrance. Dispersed in the various rooms, are some of the finest Pictures, Statues, and Busts ; and in the Library there is a valuable collection of Books. The Park is extensive, and luxuriantly interspersed with wood : besides a fine lake near the old house, it is watered by a stream called the Pow. The extensive estates in Perthshire, of which Abercairney Abbey is the chief seat, have been about six centuries in the possession of this family. Mr. Moray is the fifteenth in descent from the first proprietor, and claims to be head of the puissant house of Moray, or Murray ; of which the Duke of Atholl, the Earls of Dunmore and Mansfield, the first Earl of Dysart, Lord Elibank, and many Nova Scotia Baronets, are descended."], [286, "4 J&osstc Priorg, WtvtMivt \\ THE SEAT OF LORD KINNAIRD.

The present Mansion was erected by Lord Kinnaird, after designs by William At kinson, Esq., an architect who has been much employed in this part of North Britain. The building is in the pointed style of architecture, which has ob tained for it the name of Priory, and is two stories in height, presenting a con siderable degree of variety in its front, a peculiar feature in which is the two spires surmounting the centre towers, producing a very pleasing effect from the point whence our view is taken. The principal apartments correspond in their ornamental decoration with the style adopted on the exterior of the Mansion : they are numerous and well arranged, all of large dimensions, and of elegant proportions. The Entrance-Hall, twenty-five feet long, leads to the Grand Staircase, fifteen feet wide, above which the ceiling is groined in two very rich compartments. The other rooms en suite, consist of a handsome Dining-room, a Drawing-room, and Billiard room; also a very elegant Library, to which much attention has been paid in the decoration : all the cases for books are constructed in the pointed style, and the room commands particular attention from the noble extent of its dimensions; in length it is fifty feet, by twenty-four feet in width ; the ceiling is groined, and displays some very rich tracery, in two principal divisions, and is in height about eighteen feet six inches ; at the end of the room is access, nineteen feet wide, and about eight feet six inches in depth, which is not included in the above admeasurement. The whole building is of free stone, procured from quarries on the estate, which also abounds in wood and fine orchards.

From the grounds are to be seen various magnifi cent views of the Tay, winding majestically round the richly-wooded eminence on which the House stands. An ancient avenue of limes leads to the lawn before the mansion. Adjoining is a curious evergreen garden, made soon after the restoration of Charles II. , where \u2014 \" Grove nods to grove, each alley has its brother, And half the platform just reflects the other.\" The House is large, and was built at different periods.

A little to the north of the house, among the dark firs on the right hand of the view, stands the family burial-place, formerly a Roman Catholic chapel, where is a handsome monument, from an Italian model, erected in memory of a Sir Thomas Stewart, in the seventeenth century, by his only son. The estate of Murthly was bought by Sir William Stewart, Gentleman of the Bedchamber to James VI., upwards of 200 years ago. Sir Thomas (elder bro ther of Sir William, by whom he was succeeded in the estate of Grandtully) was one of the commissioners appointed by Queen Mary to treat with Queen Elizabeth, A.D. 1568. The estate of Grandtully was given to Alexander, imme diate ancestor of this family, in 1414. His father, the Lord of Lorn, was fourth in descent from Alexander, High Steward of Scotland, who died in 1283, and whose grandson was King Robert the Second. Tradition affirms the descent of the Lord High Stewards from kings ; it is certain, however, that kings are descended from them. In 1683, king Charles II. granted the dignity of Baronet of Nova Scotia to the Grandtully family. Sir John, grandfather of the present Sir George, was an officer in the Swedish service ; and married, secondly, Lady Jane, only sister of the Duke of Douglas. Their son, the present Lord Douglas, of Douglas, is the heir, and lineal representative, of that illustrious house. There are many curious letters and grants from James VI. to Sir William Stewart, at Murthly, together with a great collection of charters and valuable papers, from the commencement of the fifteenth century.

This venerable residence is situated in the Carse of Gowrie, which extends from the eastern extremity of the county to the city of Perth, and which being remarkably well sheltered on the north by the range of the Seidlaw hills, and having the advantage of the estuary of the Tay washing its southern side, forms a district of great beauty and fertility, so highly cultivated as to resemble a continued garden. The Castle is about a mile from the village of Longforgar, which, though it now contains nearly five hundred inhabitants, was in all proba bility originally occupied by the retainers of the Barons of Castle Huntly. The situation is extremely grand and imposing, being on the point of an abrupt and isolated rock, rising in the midst of a vast plain, to which it slopes gradually in an eastern direction, but towards the south and west is perfectly perpendicular. It was built for a place of defence in 1452, by Andrew, second Lord Gray, who called it Castellum de Huntly, in honour of his lady, a daughter of the noble House of Gordon ; and remained in the family of Gray until 1615, when the estate was purchased by Patrick, first Earl of Strathmore and King horn, who changed the name to Castle Lyon, the surname of his own family. From 1615 to 1777 the estate remained in the possession of the Earls of Strath more, when it Avas sold to the late George Paterson, Esq. who married in 1776 the Honourable Anne Gray, daughter of John, twelfth Lord Gray, and their son is the present proprietor ; being thus lineally descended from the founder of the Castle, and many generations of its noble possessors. The late Mr. Paterson restored the original name of Huntly. The walls of Castle Huntly are of prodigious thickness, in many places ten, and in some fourteen feet, and all composed of very large massive stones. A modern addition, in character, has been made to the east front of the old build ing, which, however, does not appear in the view : the embrasures and turrets were likewise renewed by the late Mr. Paterson. The principal rooms are spacious and elegant ; and there is a number of excellent bedrooms. The greatest height of the building is a hundred and sixteen feet from the ground. It is impossible to do justice by description to the magnificent and extensive view which the battlements of Castle Huntly command : the eye is first arrested by the rich groves of venerable trees which are immediately around the House, and occupy the near parts of the Park ; and wandering from their deep shades, embraces a grand prospect of the Frith of Tay for nearly twenty miles in length, and beautifully enlivened and diversified by vessels gliding to and from the ocean ; the hills of Fife, and the seats of noblemen and gentlemen in that county and in Perthshire, occupying the principal points of a richly wooded and cultivated country. Many of the old avenues in the Park have been pre served, and exhibit a pleasing unison of character between the Castle and its ornamented environs : there are some good statues on raised pedestals near the House, and a very fine ancient Gateway, built by Patrick, Earl of Strathmore, in the seventeenth century.

DRUMMOND, OF STRAGEATH. Aberuchill Castle is situated in the mountainous district of Upper Stratherne, in Perthshire, about two miles west from the village of Comrie, and four miles from Loch Erne. It faces the east, and stands upon elevated ground, backed with oak woods and fir plantations, and surmounted with high hills covered with heath. In front runs an avenue of fine old trees, extending to the length of a quarter of a mile, and terminated by a woody eminence. It was chiefly built by a cadet of the Breadalbane family, Colin Campbell, with whose heirs it remained, until the Drummonds, of Strageath, the present proprietors, came into possession of it. The old part of the House, which is partly hid by an addition since made, is of the turreted style of architecture which prevailed some centuries ago, and bears date 1602. It was anciently a place of strength, and was evidently built as a strong hold of protection for life and property against the numerous freebooters who infested the vicinity. The walls are nearly four feet in thickness, and all the windows, which are small and strong framed, were originally furnished with iron stanchions. The principal entrance which was then from the east, and is now blocked up by the addition, was doubly secured by a door, studded with large iron nails, and a ponderous iron gate curiously constructed. The grass-plot in front of the building was formerly enclosed by a wall, and served as a yard where the proprietor's cattle were kept during the night, secure from depredation. The proprietors were always at enmity with the Clan M'Gregor, so notorious for the ravages they committed, and who, living in the neighbouring mountains, infested the peaceful inhabitants of the low grounds with their unceasing and lawless depredations. One of the proprietors, Sir Colin Campbell, was ranger of the forest of Glenartney, which these highland marauders principally frequented ; and, after that unfortunate clan was proscribed by Government, was employed as one of the principal agents for apprehending, and bringing them to justice. For this purpose, bloodhounds were trained, and employed to track out these unhappy people to their fastnesses, who were in this manner hunted down and persecuted with unrelenting cruelty. Such as were taken alive were thrown into a dungeon of the castle, where many of them, no doubt, met the fate which their lawless lives, and the merciless spirit of the times, must have taught them to expect. These circumstances gave rise to the belief, still prevalent among the country people of the neigh bourhood, that the castle was haunted. Aberuchill was sold, some years ago, by Sir James Campbell, of Aberuchill and Kilbryde, to the late James Drummond, Esq. of Strageath, whose son is the present proprietor. The estate abounds with beautiful scenery and sine prospects. The low grounds are tolerably fertile and well cultivated, and the higher afford good sheep pasturage, and shelter for game. Wood of all kinds, particularly oak, grows remarkably well ; some Spanish chesnut-trees in the avenue, measure from twelve to thirteen feet in circumference. There is a cascade, not far distant from the castle, formed by a mountain stream, which waters the lawn, and, when swollen by heavy rains, presents a very grand and imposing object. 13."], [298, "2 Mt&Qtxnk, ; TRE SEAT OF STEUART MENZIES, ESQ. Meggernie is situated in Glen Lyon, a small and romantic valley of Perth shire, which reaches almost to the confines of Argyllshire. The House is placed in a singularly sequestered part of the country, being nearly sixteen miles distant from any gentleman's residence. A fine straight avenue of more than a mile in length forms the approach to Meggernie from the east, which makes a grand sweep before the house at a little distance, and approaches after turning at the opposite side. The mansion stands clear in a beautiful lawn scattered with very fine trees. It is a place of considerable antiquity, and its neighbourhood has often been the scene of con flicts amongst the Highland clans. The House is one of those ancient piles constructed in times of danger, when strength was the great object ; the walls are accordingly of immense thickness, and the doors defended by inner iron grat ings of prodigious size and weight ; the dungeon is excavated from below the foundations, and adorned with hooks, on which the finishing stroke of the law, or rather of the voluntas of barbarous and despotic chiefs, has frequently been executed. It is surprising to find so much excellent accommodation, and even elegance, in the public rooms, as the interior of Meggernie presents, considering the times in which it was built, and the grand object of safety which the founders must have kept in view. Many portraits, both of the Menzies' branch and of the Steuarts of Cardney, adorn the walls ; likewise good portraits of the present Mr. and Mrs. Menzies. The proprietor is descended in the male line from Sir John Steuart, of Card ney, son of King Robert II. from whose eldest son he is fourteenth in descent. From the second son of Sir John, the family of Steuart, of Dalguise in Atholl, is descended. By the female side, Mr. Menzies possesses the estates of Meg gernie and Culdares, and is a branch of the family of Menzies of Castle Menzies, chief of the name."], [299, ""], [300, "SUJLIDIEE\u00ae C1ST1E, i!

Culdees was built about the beginning of the present century, from the designs of Mr. Gillespie, of Edinburgh. The principal apartments are very large, and the interior arrangements do great credit to the ingenuity and judg ment of the architect. The square tower over the porch is occupied by the hall and staircase, lighted by a large Gothic window. The drawing-room is thirty feet diameter in the circular tower, and the dining-room is on the right, forty feet in length : there is also on the first floor a billiard-room and library ; all the apartments are ornamented in the purest style of our ancient pointed architecture, with richly carved decorations. This residence is in the south-western part of Stratherne ; it is situated on a well-wooded height, and commands a rich and varied prospect in almost every direction. The fine pastoral stream of the Erne flows under the towers, at a short distance, and forms some beautiful bends, which are seen to the greatest advantage from Culdees. Numerous splendid seats are observed in every direc tion, occupying the rich parts of the Strath, and on the north is the splendid outline of the Grampians, rearing their lofty summits over each other to a great height, and forming a shelter of no common nature to the luxuriant valley beneath. The family of Drummawhance have long possessed both that estate and Cul dees ; they appear to have a common ancestor with the families of Drummon dernoch, Comrie, Strageath, Keltie, &c. viz. Sir Malcolm Drummond of that Ilk, who died about 1470, in the reign of James III."], [302, "\u00c6algutec, Wtvfb&iiivt ; THE SEAT OF JOHN STEUART, ESQ. Dalguise is situated in that district of Atholl which occupies the western bank of the Tay, from its confluence with the Tumel at Logierait, to the city of Dunkeld. It is usually known by the designation of the Bishopric, having been the property of the bishops of the see of Dunkeld from a period of the most remote antiquity, and indeed from time immemorial. Sheltered by the lofty Grampian mountains, most of which were then covered with impenetrable forests, and enjoying the advantage of the greatest British river flowing through and fertilizing the wide plains on its banks, it is not surprising, that of all the environs of Dunkeld, this favoured district should have been the choice of its bishops, for their private possession. In later times, the woods had become far more scanty, and, excepting some copse-wood, and a few old avenues and scattered trees surrounding the ancient seats of the landlords, the general aspect of Atholl was excessively bare. That reproach is, happily, now removed ; for, by the active improvement of the representative of the noble family of Atholl, and of the other proprietors, added to the bold features bestowed on it by nature, this country presents a rich and grand prospect, which has excited the admiration of every visitor, and which is acknowledged not to be surpassed in the kingdom. The progenitor of the present family, possessing the barony of Dalguise, was Sir John Steuart, of Cardney, Lord of Dowallie, son of King Robert II., by Mariotta, daughter of John de Cardennie, or Cardney, of Ilk, in Perthshire. He married Jane, daughter of Sir John Drummond, of Stobhall, and sister of Annabella, queen of Robert III. His first charters appear to be dated in the year 1382, when he inherited, by his mother, the barony of Cardney, and other lands. His eldest son carried on the family of Steuart of Cardney and Arntully, which flourished with respectability in Perthshire for about four centuries, until the estate was sold to Charles Steuart, Esq. of Dalguise, in 1792, and the name of Menzies assumed by the heir, who succeeded to the estates of Culdares and Meggernie Castle, in Glen lyon. The second son of Sir John Steuart obtained possession of Dalguise in the year 1443, in consequence, it is supposed, of the exertions of his uncle, Robert de Cardney, who was Bishop of Dunkeld about that period, and to whom the venerable cathedral owed much of its ancient splendour and decoration. From Sir John Steuart, the present proprietor is the thirteenth in descent, in the direct male line. In the reigns of James VI. and Charles I., John Steuart, the sixth of this family, was chamberlain to several successive bishops of Dunkeld. He married a daughter of William Steuart, of Kinnaird and Tullimett, of the house of Rosythe, in the county of Fife. His books of accounts and papers, connected with the office of chamberlain, are still in existence. His great-grandson was engaged in one of the last dreadful acts of feudal animosity which took place between rival clans.* The late Charles Steuart, Esq., of Cardney and Dalguise, father of the present proprietor, married first, Grace, daughter of Robert Steuart, Esq., of Ballechin ; and secondly, Amelia Anne Sophia, daughter of Laurence Oliphant, Esq., of Gask, male heir and representative of the Lords Oliphant. This title was conferred upon the family in 1458, by James II. ; but Mr. Oliphant having been engaged on behalf of the House of Stuart, in 1745, was prevented by attainder from assuming the title and dignities of his ancestors. * In the year 1685, the Campbells of Argyll having invaded Atholl, and done great injury to the inhabitants of that country, and their property, the Marquess of Atholl commissioned Charles Steuart of Ballechin, and, jointly under him, Robert Hemyng of Moness, and his grandson John Steuart of Dalguise, then about twenty years of age, to march a strong body of the Steuarts of Atholl into Argyllshire, and to be revenged upon their ancient enemies. The commission is still extant, and its terms are those of almost regal authority, directing the disposal of the property ofthe conquered. Tradition reports, that, while the Atholl men were at Inverary, they accidentally discovered a plot of the Campbells to destroy them by stratagem. However this may have been, it is certain that the next day eighteen gentlemen of the name of Campbell were seized and executed by the Steuarts, and a monument erected, to perpetuate the remembrance of this lawless act of cruelty. 4"], [303, ""], [304, "BUTFMOIRIS JPAB.S\u00a3, STIRLINGSHIRE 1J1TI (CASTILE.

The annexed view, taken from the south-west, shews the entrance porch, on the west, and the south, or principal front of the edifice, upon a raised terrace, with the river and distant scenery in the county of Clackmannan. The centre divi sion of the front consists of a large quadrangular tower, with a varied line of building on each side, having octagonal turrets upon the angles. This front is adorned by two large bower windows, having the light divided by perpendicular mullions ; the other windows have square-cornered labels over them : between the upper and lower windows of the projecting bowers are quatrefoils, charged with shields ; and above, within panels, is a beautiful strawberry-leaf ornament ; the parapet over the bower windows, rises in pointed gables, surmounted by finials. The porch is formed by three pointed arches, with windows in the same character to the room above it ; beyond the porch, on the west side, is a large octagonal turret. A crenellated parapet surrounds the whole building, and rich clusters of ornamented chimneys rise above it. The turrets and varied lines of the parapets give the building a most picturesque appearance, as seen amid the trees of the park. The hall of entrance is of an octagonal form, and opens upon a corridor, leading to the dining-room, drawing-room, and library, upon the south front. The dining-room and drawing-room are of the same dimensions, thirty-six feet long by twenty-four wide ; the latter has a bower window both on the south and east. The library in the centre of this front is . a noble room, forty-two feet in length, by twenty-four in width. Private apartments occupy the east front, and the domestic offices the north, beyond which are stables, &c. The park is very richly wooded, and well stocked with deer : every part admits of the most beautiful views of the country ; Stirling castle, the windings of the Forth, and the town of Alloa, all interesting objects, agreeably diversify the scene. Lord Charles Murray, second son of John, Marquess of Athol, and brother of John, Duke of Athol, was created Earl of Dunmore, Viscount Fincastle, and Baron Murray of Blair, 16th August, 1686; and, soon after the accession.of Queen Anne, he was made one of the Lords of the privy council, and consti tuted Captain of Blackness Castle in 1/0/. His lordship died in 1710, when his eldest son, James, became the second Earl of Dunmore, but, dying soon after, was succeeded by his brother, John, third Earl of Dunmore, who was colonel of the third regiment of Guards, and was elected one of the sixteen peers of Scotland, in 1713 ; dying without issue in 1752, he was succeeded by his brother William, fourth Earl of Dunmore, who married the daughter of Lord William Murray, afterwards Lord Nairn; and at his death, in 1756, was succeeded by his son, John, fifth Earl of Dunmore, from 1761 to 1784, one of the sixteen peers of Scotland. His lordship married Charlotte, daughter of the Earl of Galloway; and at his death, in 1809, was succeeded by his son, George, the sixth Earl of Dunmore, who married Susan, daughter of Archibald, Duke of Hamilton. 14."], [306, "2 mm \u20acmtltf &tirZina*Wrc ; THE SEAT OF THOMAS GRAHAM STIRLING, ESQ. Airth Castle is situated in a parish of the same name, on the southern bank of the majestic Firth of Forth. The large square Tower, on the left of our View, was built previous to the battle of Falkirk, in 1298. Blind Harry, in his History of Sir William Wallace, mentions, that the priest of Dunipace, tbe uncle of tbat great hero, was confined here in a wet dungeon ; and tbat the English garrison was routed, and their prisoner rescued from confinement, by the intrepid daring of his gallant nephew. In commemoration of that event, this part of the building has always borne the name of Wallace's Tower. The eastern tower and turret are also very ancient ; they were united to Wallace's Tower by the south front, which is represented in the engraving, in the reign of James VI., when an addition was also made to the north. Over the old entrance was the date 1581, with tbe arms of the families of Bruce and Elphinstone, to whom the mansion formerly belonged. The old part of the building is in the form of the letter V : but in 1807 the north wing was united to Wallace's Tower by a castellated front, designed by D. Hamilton, of Glasgow ; the centre of this building is seen over the ancient wing in our view. The Entrance Hall conducts to a Saloon in the angle of the old building, to which the principal rooms enter. The Dining-room is in the modern part of the house, but the Drawing-rooms occupy the south wing of the old building. From the windows are beautiful views of the grounds around the house, with the highly cultivated Carse of Falkirk in the distance. The walls in the west tower are built with stones of vast size, together with sea-sand and shells. From the battlements of the east tower the prospect is particularly magnificent. Far to the east is seen the Castle of Edinburgh, while that of Stirling is about eight miles to tbe westward. On the north-east, the Forth expands to a great breadth, and is constantly crowded with vessels. Its shores on both sides are decorated with splendid mansions and extensive woods and lawns. The ancient Tower of Clackmannan stands amid some aged trees on a rising ground, directly to the north. It was formerly the chief seat of the Bruces, but is now the property of Lord Dundas. On the margin of the Forth, farther to the west, is the town of Alloa. The spire of the church, upwards of two hundred feet in height, is an imposing object through all the country. The venerable ruin of Alloa Tower stands to the east of the town, and was built nearly seven hundred years ago, being the only remaining part of a large pile, which was unfortunately burned about the beginning of the present century. In the Park is an immense number of trees of vast size. Alloa is the property of John Francis Erskine, Earl of Mar; and has been the residence of that great family for many ages. On the north-east is the modern mansion of Tulliallan, situated immediately about the bank of the Forth, which was built by Admiral Lord Viscount Keith, G. C. B. K. C, who died there in March, 1823, aged 76. In the castle of Airth there are three fine original portraits of celebrated persons: the great Marquess of Montrose, K. G. ; the Admirable Crichton; and Graham of Claverhouse,Viscount Dundee, with whose death at Killicrankie, in 1689, though in the moment of victory, fell the fortunes of James II. of England. The Church, now a ruin, adjoins the Castle, as is seen in the view. It is an ancient structure, and was repaired in 1591. It belonged to the Abbey of Holy rood in 1128 ; and in the time of episcopacy was under the bishops of Edinburgh. In one of the aisles is a handsome marble monument of the family of Bruce. Five miles on tbe south are the celebrated Carron Iron-works. In the neighbouring parish of Dunipace are the remains of the Torwood ; and the wreck of an oak is still seen, wherein Sir William Wallace was concealed, and which is said to have measured twelve feet in diameter."], [307, ""], [308, "Beam-by WBeO*.

Airthrey Castle is seated on an eminence at the distance of two miles from the town of Stirling, on the left of the road to Kinross. It was erected about the year 1780, by Mr. Haldane, in the castellated style, well suited to the romantic scenery around. The grounds are richly wooded, contain much fine old timber, and command the most beautiful prospects, particularly of Stirling Castle, and the valley of the Forth, one of the most important rivers in North Britain. Through this valley, the river winds in a manner scarcely to be described ; it seems as if unwilling to leave the fruitful and delightful country through which it runs, and as if wishing to prolong the term of its stay by lengthening its course. Its meanders are so extensive and frequent as to form a great many beautiful peninsul\u00e6, on one of which, immediately opposite to the Castle of Stirling, stands the ruinous Tower of the Abbey of Cambus kenneth, formerly one of the richest religious houses in the kingdom. The scenery by these objects is rendered truly interesting to the beholder ; fertile fields, various mansions, and pleasure-grounds, almost insulated by the turns of the river, the white sails of the vessels appearing in every direction ; all increase the beauty of the scene. Some idea may be formed of the windings of this noble river, when it is mentioned that by land the distance from Stirling to Alloa is only six miles, while by water it is not less than twenty-four. The possessor of Airthrey is the elder brother of the late Sir Ralph Aber crombie, whose destiny it was to fall in the moment of victory, near Alexandria, on 21st March, 1801. His memory will be recorded in the annals of his country\u2014 will be sacred to every British soldier, and embalmed in the recol lection of a grateful posterity.

Kilgraston is situated in the valley of Stratherne, not far from the confluence of the rivers Erne and Tay, and five miles from the city of Perth. The sur rounding country is remarkable for its extreme fertility, and beauty of scenery, the whole valley being filled with the seats and parks of the principal nobility and gentry of the country. The mansion is pleasantly situated in a well wooded park of considerable extent, surrounded by bold and picturesque hills. The architecture of Kilgraston was chiefly designed by the late Francis Grant, Esq., the father of the present proprietor, and the front elevation is correctly represented in the plate. The public rooms, which are on the first floor, look ing towards the south and west, form a suite of five apartments, entered from a spacious Saloon, round the upper part of which is a Gallery, lighted by a cupola, forming the communication to the Bed-rooms. The Dining-room and family apartments are likewise on the first floor. The home grounds at Kilgraston are laid out in beautiful shrubberies and flower gardens, kept in the best order, and the rides on the neighbouring heights command most extensive and beautiful views. The much frequented watering place of Pitcaithly is situated on this estate, at the distance of about a mile from the house. \u2022 The family of Grant, of Kilgraston, is originally of Glenloch, in Strathspay, which was their ancient residence. This estate was purchased by John Grant, Esq., about the middle of the 17th century. The Earl of Seafield, formerly Sir Lewis Grant, of Grant (who succeeded to the earldom in right of his grand mother, Lady Margaret Ogilvie) is the undoubted head of this most ancient and distinguished name. John Grant, Esq. married a sister of Sir William M'Leod Bannatyne, Baronet, a Judge of the Court of Session, and, dying with out issue, was succeeded in his estates by his brother, the late Francis Grant, Esq., who married Ann, daughter of the late Robert Oliphant, Esq., of Rossie, in the county of Perth. John Grant, Esq., the present proprietor, eldest son of the preceding marriage, married, in 1820, the Honourable Margaret Gray, second daughter of Francis, 15th Lord Gray, who died in 1821, leaving an only daughter. Mr. Grant married, secondly, in 1828, the Lady Lucy Bruce, third daughter of the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine.

This castle was built by John Urquhart, of Craigfintry, which was the proper name of the Barony, early in the seventeenth century, between 1604 and 1607. The founder, who was also ancestor of the Urquharts, of Meldrum and Byth, was a gentleman of some note in the troublesome times in which he lived, and is mentioned repeatedly by different historians. He twice had the guardianship of the elder branches of his family, during tho minorities of his nephew, and grand-nephew, the celebrated Sir Thomas Urquhart, and was generally known by the name of the Tutor of Cromarty. As such, he is in the list of chiefs and heads of families, who were ordered to find security for the good conduct of their respective clans, by an act of parliament, in 1587. He died at Craigstone Castle, Nov. 8, 1631, and was buried in the place of interment for the family, in the church of King Edward, in this county. There are few old houses in the north of Scotland, that unite so much comfort with that intricacy, or rather disregard of plan, which characterized the style of building in use when it was erected. The Drawing-room is particularly elegant, being thirty feet long, by twenty-one feet broad, and seventeen high; it is orna mented by some grotesque carving in wood, as well as many valuable pictures. The accommodation is ample. Over a great niche in the front of the House, is a project ing gallery, highly enriched with architectural ornament, and a series of figures, principally of warriors, cut in relievo. The Grounds in the immediate vicinity of the Castle partake of a certain degree of formality, well suited to the character of the building; a style which it were to be wished oftener accompanied edifices of this period, as harmonizing more intimately with the structures, than the open undulating lawns, which of late have been formed at the expense of many a noble terrace. This formality is, however, soon lost in agreeable swells and wooded banks, particularly those of a glen, or valley, extending about a mile from the Castle, round which a drive has been formed. In the principal apartments is a considerable number of Pictures, of which may be mentioned four portraits of the last exiled princes of the Stuart family, Earl Marischal, and Captain John Urquhart of Craigstone, by Trevisani, who enjoyed a considerable reputation in Rome. There is likewise a portrait of Madame Cam pioni, in the character of Minerva, by the same artist. These were painted about the year 1736. Three by Jamieson, an artist born in Aberdeen, who studied along with Vandyck, under Rubens, and attained a degree of excellence only inferior to his fellow-pupil. Having confined himself principally to portrait, and practised entirely in Scotland, his name is little known in England. He was called the Scot tish Vandyck. Those by him, are Sir Alexander Fraser, of Philorth; General David Leslie, the covenanter; and Dr. Forbes, the first Bishop of Edinburgh. There are several by Vernet, an excellent portrait by an artist unknown, some good copies of celebrated pictures, and many family portraits. The library is extensive and well chosen, and contains a collection of books in the Spanish language, made by Captain Urquhart, who was in the naval service of that country. There is like wise a cabinet of coins and medals, of considerable value. The Family of Urchard, or, as it is now written, Urquhart, is of very old standing in the north of Scotland. According to Sir George Mackenzie, \" the chief of this name was Urquhart, of Cromarty. The first of the family was a brother of Ocho nocher, (who slew the bear,) predecessor of the Lord Forbes; and, having in keep ing the castle of Urquhart, on Loch Ness, took his surname from that place.\" The arms of the family is Or, three boars' heads erased, gules. The heritable sheriffship of the shire of Cromarty was granted by king Robert Bruce, anno 1316, to Hugh, Earl of Ross, who soon afterwards transferred it to William de Urquhart, in whose family it continued till the estate was sold to the Viscount of Tarbet, afterwards Earl of Cromarty, in 1685. 15."], [314, "2 ewtlt ffivwtv, mttttttnttix* ; THE SEAT OF COLONEL FRASER.

Castle Fraser was formerly the baronial residence of the Lords Fraser, and preserves an interesting and venerable character in the peculiarity of its archi tecture, as contrasted with the more modern seats of the nobility. It is con sidered to be one of the best specimens extant of the turreted mansions, of which there are so many still in Scotland, and particularly in Aberdeenshire, being in complete repair, and furnishing an interesting memorial of the national style at an early period, when the situation of the country demanded that every baron should fortify his residence according to his rank and consequence, calling in the aid of turreted bulwarks and crenellated ramparts, to enable the owner to resist the frequent attacks of his powerful adversaries. The exact period of the foundation of Castle Fraser cannot now, it is supposed, be correctly ascer tained ; but a tablet in the house records, that additions were made to the Castle in the fourteenth century, during the reign of Robert Bruce. The earliest date now to be found on the exterior walls, is 1576, when it probably underwent a repair in the time of James VI. of Scotland. Additions were also made by Andrew, the first Lord Fraser, in the reign of Charles I. In our view is represented the North-front. The royal arms, with supporters, appear above the arms of the family of Fraser; three f rases, or strawberry leaves, in richly sculptured compartments. The supporters of this branch of the family were a falcon and a heron, and the motto, All my hope is in God. Andrew Fraser, of Muchill, in Aberdeenshire, son and heir of Andrew Fraser, by Elizabeth, daughter of Robert, Earl of Buchan, was created Lord Fraser, by Charles I. 19th June, 1633 ; his wife was Anne, daughter of James, Lord Balmerino. His lordship dying in 1636, Andrew, his son, succeeded to his estate and honour. He married a lady of the house of Hadden, of Gleneagles, by whom he had Andrew, his successor, third Lord Fraser, who died in 1674, leaving by Margaret, daughter of Hugh, Lord Lovat, Charles, fourth Lord Fraser, who married Mary, daughter of James, Earl of Buchan, but had no issue, when the title became extinct at his death in 1716. Castle Fraser is dis tinguished from the generality of buildings of the same kind, by a noble circular tower, about a hundred feet high, which for its proportion is much admired : the upper part of this building is surrounded by balustrades, and is girt with a bold cornice of granite, above which are resemblances of cannon, executed in stone.

The entrance is on the south side of the building ; but the principal views are from the public rooms in the north and east sides ; they are of the grandest description, and embrace an extensive prospect of the Firth of Forth, together with numerous seats, villages, and towns, on the coasts of Fifeshire and Midlothian.

It is extremely well planned, and combines much domestic comfort with a considerable degree of architectural ornament and splendour. The Cloister, from which the principal suite of rooms branch off, is of large dimensions, and richly decorated. The old castle of Dundas, of nearly eight hundred years standing, now forms one side of the interior court of the building, but nearly detached from it ; and, notwithstanding its immense antiquity, still remains in perfect preservation. .rV\u00abrV*\u201e ''mb.

The following is one of the legends engraved on the fountain : \u2014 \" In memory of Himself, in remembrance to Posterity, and for an entertain ment to Friends and to Strangers who visit his Mansion, Sir Walter Dundas, having at a great expense cleared the ground of stones and of rocks which deformed it, in the 6lst year of his age, and in 1623 year of Christ, for the adornment of his country, and for the honour of his family, erected, furnished, and ornamented this Fountain, this Dial, and this Garden. The fountain is defended by that Castle. A company of divinities guard the dial, and the garden is surrounded with turrets, with walls, with walks, and with terraces.\" The family of Dundas have been in possession of this estate from the remotest antiquity. James Dundas, Esq., the present representative of the family, is the son of George Dundas, Esq., by Christian, daughter of Sir William Stirling, Baronet, of Ardock, in Perthshire ; he married Mary, daughter of Admiral Viscount Duncan, and has a numerous family.

Dalmeny has been recently erected by the present Earl of Rosebery, from the designs, and under the superintendence, of William Wilkins, Esq., an architect, of whose taste we cannot speak too highly. The Mansion presents an example of the splendid and much-decorated style in use during the reign of James IV. of Scotland : the small turrets, highly enriched with a variety of tracery, form conspicuous objects ; ornamented pannels, with shields, are profusely distributed around the building ; other compartments bear armorial insignia : the whole displaying a most curious example of the taste of former times, and forming a fine contrast to the regularity of Italian architecture, which has prevailed for the last two centuries, but is now rapidly on the decline, being superseded by works produced from the researches in Greece, or among the antiquities of our country. The Hall is entered from the Portal shewn in the annexed View, through a Vestibule. It is richly ornamented in the Gothic style ; the pendants and timber-work of the ceiling produce a picturesque and pleasing effect, and here the principal staircase is placed. From the Hall, a Cloister extends the whole length of the suite of principal apartments ; the vaulted ceiling of which is enriched with ribs and tracery in appropriate forms. The windows are of ancient stained glass, in single subjects, of brilliant colour and excellent design. The rooms are calculated more for comfort and convenience than show. The Library, which it is proposed to make the common living-room, contains an excellent collection of modern authors, arranged around the room in wainscot cases of a novel and handsome construction. This room is 37 feet long, by 30 wide, including the large oval window in the centre of the side opposite the fire place, and it is connected with a Drawing-room 36 feet long, by 30 wide. The Breakfast-room separates the latter from a Dining-room of somewhat greater dimensions. Considerable skill has been shewn in the arrangement of a compact and convenient suite of private apartments, distinct from the main body of the house ; which look upon a retired garden. The Offices are very extensive, no expense having been spared to render them applicable to all the requisites of a large establishment. This beautiful Park, anciently named Barnbougle, is situated in a parish of the same name, in the eastern part of the county of Linlithgow, and on the borders of that noble estuary, the Frith of Forth ; and is laid out with Planta tions formed in the very best taste, and in such a manner as to improve the soil, the more elevated spots being covered with trees, and exhibiting the face of the country in its most beautiful aspects : the shore of the Forth here suddenly rises into a ridge, adorned by culture and plantations, from the sum mit of which a succession of views may be met with, which are scarcely to be equalled in any quarter of the globe. The Forth is every where seen ; its shores, covered with a regular and variegated scenery, consisting of gentle ascents and declivities, interspersed with numerous mansions, exhibiting a great proportion of rich and pleasing territory : it takes the appearance of a great lake, a noble river, or a broad sea, according to the points of view in which it is seen, and assumes a singular variety of aspects ; hills, promontories, winding bays, lofty shores, and cultivated fields, bordering upon this fine expanse of water. This noble family derives its name from the lands of Primrose, in the county of Fife; of which family was descended Archibald Primrose, created a baronet by King Charles II. ; he died, leaving two sons, of whom Archibald, the younger, was first created Viscount Rosebery in 1700, and afterwards Earl of Rosebery, Viscount Inverkeithing, Lord Dalmeny and Primrose, April 10, 1703"], [319, ""], [320, "ILLY I ld_.

In the valley of Strathtay, about thirty miles from Perth, and deeply embosomed amongst aged trees, stands the venerable and ivy-mantled Castle of Grandtully. No description can afford an adequate idea of the beauties of Strathtay ; and although the view here given shews the tops of some lofty mountains, one of which, to the right of the Castle, is Farragon, 2884 feet above the level of the sea, yet it does not represent the pastoral and softer features of the lower grounds; huge rocks, and misshapen swells of heath, form the upper parts of the hills; lower down, the sides are clothed with thick and luxuriant copse-woods; next to this, is a wide plain, adjoining to the Tay, which is here a large and deep stream, winding its majestic course through these fields ; sometimes seen through the woods, and frequently hid by the thickness of the embowering foliage. In the approaches to Grandtully Castle, the trees are disposed in straight avenues, and some of them are remarkable for height and size. A moat surrounds the Building and Gardens, to which there was formerly access by a drawbridge and portal; but the water having been drained off, a mound has been formed across part of the moat, and only the watch-towers of the Gateway remain : in these are loop-holes for shooting arrows, and places of observation, &c, marking the insecurity of the times in which the Castle was built. The age of this building is about four hundred years ; the thickness of many of the walls is so great, that large closets are formed in them. The Watch tower contains a window to each of the four points. A great part of the Castle is covered with luxuriant ivy, and the rest of the walls are of a dark stone, and seemingly mouldering to decay. Sir George Stewart, the proprietor, resides mostly at Murthly, near the foot of Birnam Hill, on another part of the estate, twenty miles to the south. The interior of the Castle contains little worthy of particular notice. The inner door is of iron, and the fire-place of the large Drawing-room is between twelve and fifteen feet wide. The estate of Grandtully has been above four hundred years in the possession of this family, and from time immemorial has been the property of their ancestors of the House of Stewart. 16."], [322, "2 Hatoers, lltrtttfirirt ; THE SEAT OF THE HON. DAVID ROBERTSON WILLIAMSON EWART, OF BALGRAY. This estate and place belonged for some centuries to a branch of the Breadal bane family, who became afterwards Earls of Loudon, in Ayrshire. It was sold, in 17793 to Mr. Drummond, banker in London, who, in 1784, disposed ofthe whole to the late General Archibald Robertson, of the Royal Engineers. At his death, in 1813, the whole devolved on his niece, Miss Boyd Robertson, who, by her mother, is the lineal descendant of the famous Zachariah Boyd, and Bishop Boyd, of Glasgow. In 1814, she married her second cousin, David Williamson, a Judge of the Court of Session, by the title of Lord Balgray. The house was built in 1738, from a design of the late William Adam; the then possessor, Colonel Campbell, was killed at the battle of Fontenoy, and slept only one night in his new house. Various alterations have been made by the present proprietors : the entrance has been changed from the south to the north, and a handsome pediment of Ionic columns has been added to the south front, with a colonnade on each side, from the designs of Mr. Richard Crichton, late architect in Edinburgh. The South Front and situation of Lawers is faith fully delineated in the accompanying View. The house is by no means regular, having been built at different times ; but on the whole the building has a pleasing effect. The interior is commodious, and admirably finished. The large Draw ing-room is well proportioned, and is fitted up in the Grecian style, with great purity and elegance. The entrance was formerly through a broad avenue, a mile in length, of very large- sized trees: this avenue is still preserved; but the entrance is now from the Cries and Comrie road, which intersects the adjoining parks. From the Lodge at the eastern entrance is a beautiful avenue of old beech-trees. Another handsome Lodge is placed at the west entrance, about a mile further, nearer Comrie ; and the approach winds at the foot of most romantic rocks covered with wood. The road on which these entrances are placed is extremely beautiful, especially when the view opens upon the village of Comrie \u2014 the hills at the Castle of Aberuchil, mostly covered with copse, and surmounted by the higher chain of Grampians in the neighbourhood of Dunira, and the mountains at the top of Loch-Earne. On the summit of one of the hills near Dunira, the seat of Lord Melville, is a handsome monument lately erected in memory of the first Viscount. Behind the House of Lawers rises a magnificent bank of wood, affording every shelter, and forming one of the chief ornaments of the place. The river Earne, which issues from the east end of a lake of the same name, flows to the south of the House.

Craigend is situated in the parish of Strathblane, in the western extremity of the county of Stirling, about eleven miles north of the city of Glasgow. The Castle stands in a Park of about a hundred acres, interspersed with groupes, and single trees of considerable age, and deep masses and belts of fine thriving young plantations. The former mansion on -Craigend, built by the late Mr. Smith, had been intended to be considerably enlarged by his son, the present proprietor, and an addition, designed by his relative, James Smith, Esq. of Jordan-hill, F.R.S., was begun ; but, after the erection had gone some length, it was found more suitable to pull down the old house entirely, and the present building was completed according to plans furnished by Mr. Alexander Ramsay, architect and builder, Edinburgh, preserving as much as possible the internal arrangement as designed by Mr. Smith. The Entrance-hall is very spacious and lofty, being thirty feet high, and leads to the Dining and Drawing rooms, Library, Billiard-room, and Con servatory; all of which are upon the first floor, and are large and well proportioned. From the front of the Mansion is a view of Mugdock-Loch, the extreme ends of which are hid by the trees and coppice-wood which skirt the banks ; and, as there are three small islands in it covered with natural wood, the effect is very pleasing. \u2014 On the north-west bank of this Loch stands the old Castle of Mugdock, the property of His Grace the Duke of Montrose, and the ancient residence of that noble family, which, being surrounded by very fine old trees of various kinds, renders the landscape at once beautiful and picturesque. The Avenue enters the Park about half a mile to the east, and (after passing through the young plantations, and along the north bank of the Loch, imme diately at the foot of a precipice overhung with oaks, &c.) forms a gently rising approach to the house. There is a beautiful octagon Tower erected by the present prprietor upon the summit of a bank on the north side of Mugdock Loch, which forms a fine object from the house, and commands a very extensive view. From it are seen the beautiful straths of the Blane and Endrick, terminated by Ben-lomond, and the lofty mountains on the west side of Loch Lomond ; also the whole of the middle and lower Wards of Lanarkshire, and part of the counties of Stirling, Linlithgow, Edinburgh, Renfrew, Ayr, Dumbarton, and Perth."], [326, "UtirtmitamPlace, \u00a3tirlutgstnre ; THE SEAT OF THE DUKE OF MONTROSE, K.G. Situated at the foot of the Grampian Hills, about 18 miles from Glasgow, this venerable mansion, of one of the most ancient families in the kingdom, has been considerably enlarged, under the direction of the present noble proprietor, by Mr. Playfair, the architect also of Bothwell and Melville Castles. Extent is the principal character of the building ; the decorations of architecture would, most probably, appear trifling in the vicinity of the terrific mountains, which rear their lofty summits to the west of the house : the front, which occupies near 300 feet in length, is grand and uniform. Many of the apartments are noble. Among the family portraits, which are in the Dining-room and Book-room, is one of the first Marquis of Montrose, by Vandyck, and others by W. Aikman, a Scotch painter of considerable eminence. The Charter-room contains family papers and title-deeds, of very ancient dates, relating to many noble families connected with the house of Montrose. Numerous visitors, during the summer months, attracted by the romantic scenery of the Highlands, and the sports afforded by the roebuck, black-cock, ptarmigan, and moor-game, enjoy the hospitality of the noble owner of Buchanan-Place ; the highly interesting andpicturesque situation of which, has afforded great scope for the superior talents of the present Duchess of Montrose and her accomplished daughters. Several large views, by the noble artists, adorn the town residence of the family ; and the scenery of the immediate neighbourhood has been the theme of Sir Walter Scott, in his much admired poem of, \"The Lady of the Lake.\" The Deer- Park is on Inch-Mirrin, an island of the adjoining lake, two miles long and one wide, embellished with fine old oaks, whose roots stretch into the water : near the ruins of an ancient castle, formerly the residence of the Dukes of Lennox, is a pleasure-lodge, where his Grace dines when he visits the park. His barge, on these occasions, is rowed by Highlanders in their ancient dress, long prohibited by law, but restored to them through the exertions of the pre sent Duke of Montrose. Here is also a house for the keeper. Loch Lomond, the finest and most beautiful of all the Scottish lakes, encir cled with lofty mountains and woods, is diversified with numerous islands, the principal of which are the property of his Grace. Inch-Caillach, was once the site of the parish church of Buchanan, and is still used as a burial-place. Inch-Fad and Inch-Cruin have a tenant upon each, with arable and pasture ground. In the fore-ground of the view, is seen the river Endrick, one of the prin cipal streams that feed the lake ; flowing in beautiful curves through the fertile haughs or flats of the parish of Buchanan. The highest mountain in the view is Ben Lomond, which is wholly the property of the Duke of Montrose, and the most lofty in this part of the country ; its form is conical, the summit covered with snow during a con siderable part of the year.

Crathes is finely situated on the north bank of the river Dee, surrounded on all sides by woods, most of the trees in the vicinity of the Castle being also remarkable for their size. The principal part of the house is old ; but consider able additions, as represented in our View, were made about the middle of the last century, and the interior was fitted up some years ago, with all possible attention to the ancient character of the building. The Dining-room, or Baronial Hall, on the second story, is thirty-three feet in length, and eighteen feet six inches in width ; the roof is arched and groined; the height of the Hall to the spring of the arch is ten feet two inches, and seventeen feet four inches and a half to the centre of the roof ; a large mullioned window at the end, looks to the front of the mansion. The walls are stone colour. In this room hangs an original portrait of Gilbert Burnett, Bishop of Salisbury, in his robes, a three-quarter length picture, by Sir Godfrey Kneller. The bishop was a cadet of this family, his father being the fourth son of Alex ander Burnett, of Leys, the brother of Sir Thomas Burnett, the first Baronet ; and the picture is much esteemed, independent of its value as a portrait. There are several excellent family portraits at this seat, the most curious of which is one on panel, of an ancestor of Sir Robert Burnett ; the dress is of the period of Charles the First's reign. The Gardens attached to Crathes are suitable to the antiquity of the building, while the woods in the vicinity abound in romantic scenery. This mansion is situated about fifteen miles west from the city of Aberdeen, and very near the border of the county. Among the hills rising from the south bank of the Dee, and directly opposite to Crathes, stands the ancient castle of Tilwhilly, belong ing to a branch of the noble family of Morton ; of this family, Dr. Douglas, the late bishop of Salisbury, was a descendant. It is a singular circumstance, that two Presbyterian families, on the opposite banks of the river, whose estates joined each other, should have given, in the same century, two celebrated bishops of the see of Salisbury, distinguished by their writings, and by the maintenance of religious tenets differing from those of their respective families. The Dee, which flows immediately below the house, a pretty large river, rises amongst the Grampian mountains, in the western part of Aberdeenshire, and waters in its course the magnificent valley of Brae-Mar. It is crossed by several splendid bridges ; one of seven arches, near Aberdeen, is very ancient. The banks of this river afford a succession of most sublime scenery ; and the neigh bourhood of Crathes, though less alpine in its immediate vicinity, is distin guished for the boldness of its general feature, and the peculiar richness and fertility of the soil. The family of Burnett of Leys, chief of the name, is of great and undoubted antiquity. Robert de Burnard is witness to the foundation charter of the abbey of Kelso, by king David I., anno 1128. Alexander Burnard, the immediate ancestor of this family, flourished in the reign of king Robert Bruce, and obtained from that prince charters of various lands in Aberdeenshire, A.D. 1324. His great-grandson, Robert, who lived about the beginning of the fifteenth century, is the first who is designated of Leys, which has continued the title of this family ever since. Sir Thomas Burnett, twelfth in descent from the above mentioned Alexander Burnard, received the honour of knighthood from king James VI., and was afterwards created a Baronet of Nova Scotia by king Charles I., in 1626. 17-"], [330, "2 &rfmtImott i^ouse, l&mcartrmcsinre ; THE SEAT OF VISCOUNT ARBUTHNOTT. The family of Arbuthnott was ennobled by Charles I. in 1651, in the person of Sir Robert Arbuthnott of that Ilk, who married a daughter of the first Earl of Southesk. Long previous to that period, the ancestors of the Viscount had been in possession of the extensive estates in Kincardineshire now held by his Lordship, and many of them made a distinguished figure in the great military and political events of Scottish history. The surname is originally local, as was usual in those ages of remote antiquity in which the founders of this ancient family flourished : it is taken from the lands of the same name, but was fre quently spelled Aberbothenoth, until the reign of King David II. in the fourteenth century. The situation of the mansion is extremely picturesque, and much has been done by nature to render it a most delightful residence. The Bervie, a clear and beautifully winding stream, flows through a sheltered valley, at the foot of the old hanging gardens which occupy the sloping bank from the house to the river, and are formed into a succession of very beautiful terraces : there is a noble avenue of very large beech-trees leading to the lawn in front of the house ; and the handsome bridge lately erected, seen on the left of the view, forms a fine object in the park. The valley of the Bervie, of which this seat forms a most distinguished ornament, is richly clothed with a profusion of young wood, intermixed with trees of venerable growth : it is generally allowed to be one of the most beautiful valleys in the county. Although the principal seat of the family of Arbuthnott for many centuries, the exterior of the house does not now present any appearance of the residence of feudal barons ; and has been so much altered by successive proprietors, that it at present contains few features to mark its ancient and baronial character. The oldest part of the building, however, bears date of the beginning of the fifteenth century, while a considerable part, with richly-ornamented ceilings, is not more modern than the reign of Charles I. : the modern part was built in the year 17*54, and, it may be regretted, caused the removal of the remains of the square tower, and the other appendages of the old baronial castle. The hand some dining-hall, of about forty feet in length, is adorned with a fine full-length portrait of Robert first Viscount of Arbuthnott, and various other portraits of the family connections. The rest of the apartments, which are very numerous, are spacious and handsome, and hung with many family portraits, and others by old masters. The Church of Arbuthnott, situated at a short distance from the house, contains the family mausoleum, in which there is a recumbent full-length figure in stone, of Hugo de Aberbothenoth, surnamed Blundus, or le Blond, from the flaxen colour of his hair, who died in the thirteenth century. It is still in good preservation, and the arms of the Baron, with those of his wife, are distinctly to be traced. The bearings of the family of Arbuthnott are at present nearly the same as on this very curious monument, and the three chevrons mark the lady to have been a daughter of the family of Morville, Constables of Scotland. The present representative of the ancient and noble house of Arbuthnott is the eighth Viscount ; and the twenty-third Baron in a direct descent from Hugo de Aberbothenoth, who flourished in the reign of King William the Lion, in the middle of the twelfth century. His Lordship married, in 1805, Lady Margaret Ogilvy* daughter of Walter, sixth Earl of Airly, and has a numerous family : he is Lord Lieutenant of the county of Kincardine, and one of the representatives of the peerage of Scotland in the British Parliament.

A confirmation charter of the lands of Kincardine was granted to Sir Patrick Graham, by Alexander the Third, in 1285. It is likewise mentioned in a charter to William, first Earl of Montrose, 3d March, 1504. \u2014 Close to the ruin is a remarkably old yew-tree, of uncommon size, which apparently has braved many a wintry tempest : it overhangs the river Ruthren, into which, tradition relates, were thrown all the valuables when the Castle was besieged and taken by the Parliamentary army, in 1644, when it was defended by the celebrated Marquis of Montrose, who was in arms for King Charles the First ; it has never since been repaired. By its vestiges, it appears to have been very large and strong, some of its remaining walls are fifteen feet thick. The pre sent Castle, which was built in the year 1806, stands in the middle of a beau tiful and extensive wood, having a commanding view of the deep glen under neath, through which runs the little river Ruthren, well stocked with trout. Each side of the Castle will present a different kind of architecture, according to the original plan ; but it is not yet finished. The avenue leading to it is a mile in length, winding through the wood, in some parts along a deep and shaded glen, affording a most romantic and pic turesque scene, which to the north is terminated by a bold and swelling ridge of the Ochil hills. The view from the gardener's house is peculiarly striking ; it is situated in a deep ravine, and surrounded on almost every side by high banks and crags, whose sides are clothed with the most beautiful natural wood ; it presents to the eye one of the most enchanting scenes imaginable, whilst the whole is enlivened by a number of little cascades, rushing with impetuosity from the adjoining scene. Besides various other sorts of game, with which the property abounds, the roebuck is also found, and even the pheasant thrives in this northern clime.

Such is a general outline of the neighbouring scenery: the Park, and near vicinity of Gask, is amply clothed with the finest old timber, and some trees, particularly beech and chesnut, have reached a most uncommon size. This property has been more than six centuries in the possession of the Lords Oliphant and their ancestors, of whom the present proprietor is the lineal repre sentative. It was erected into a Barony by charter of King David II. dated 1365, in favour of Sir Walter Oliphant, and Elizabeth Bruce his wife, daughter of King Robert Bruce, and by this charter the family still enjoys some valuable and peculiar privileges. The descendant of Sir Walter was created a Lord of Parliament by James II. in 1438, by the title of Baron Oliphant. Until the abolition of Heritable Jurisdictions in Scotland, these Barons had the power of life and death over their numerous tenantry and vassals. In later years, the family has been noted for its faithful adherence to the cause of the exiled House of Stuart. Gask was visited by Prince Charles Edward, and his father, both in 1715 and 1745, and the grandfather of Mr. Oliphant was created an earl by the latter. After the battle of Culloden, the estates were forfeited; but, by the most powerful interest being used, the half, which is now in their possession, was restored. The House was designed by Crichton, and commenced at the beginning of this century: its plan is simple and elegant, consisting of a large square building, with wings connected by colonnades of pillars, and forming altogether a front of considerable extent. The portico, at the entrance, consists of four fine Ionic columns, supporting an architrave and a balcony, which opens from the Music-room above. On the right and left of the Hall are the Dining-room, Library, and large Drawing-room, about thirty feet in length, and well propor tioned: the principal Staircase is lighted from the roof, and handsomely adorned with Grecian entablatures and cornices : the Billiard-room is under the pillars, which connect the right wing with the House. There is a number of very good family portraits in Gask, and a fine original painting of Prince Charles, which was presented by him to the family. That Prince, likewise, left here his High land Bonnet, White Cockade and Spurs, together with his Star and Garter, and other relics, which are carefully preserved. The Garden is coeval with the old House, and is laid out in the Dutch taste ; and at the foot of it, approached by a dark and solejnn avenue of Limes called the Thicket, is the family mausoleum, deeply surrounded with foliage : there are some old monumental fragments here, but from the influence of the weather and other causes, they are now extremely difficult to decipher."], [335, ""], [336, "Drawn \"by- J.

Thurso Castle is one of the most northern seats in the United Kingdom, being situated on the shore of Thurso Bay, at the entrance of the Pentland Firth, and directly opposite to the Orkney Isles. It was long regarded as one of the chief residences of the ancient Earls of Caithness, but the present mansion was erected by George, Earl of Caithness, about the year 1660, and came into possession of that branch of the Sinclair family which now owns it, in 1718. Though the Castle is old, its walls are so substantial, that it may be considered a most comfortable habitation ; the three principal Towers contain staircases, one of them leading to the Library, which is stored with a large collection of ancient literature, as well as of the theology of the last century. In the Dining-room and Drawing-rooms there are a great number of family portraits, Some of which are considered to possess merit, particu larly those of Lady Janet Sinclair, mother ofthe present Sir John Sinclair, Bart.; John, Earl of Sutherland ; Elizabeth, Countess of Sutherland ; Alexander Brodie, Esq. of Brodie, Lyon King of Arms ; and Sir George Sinclair, of Clyth, who formerly repre sented this county. The neighbouring districts are rich and highly cultivated, and it is greatly to the credit of this remote region, that of the eighty-six counties in Great Britain, it stands the highest for increased population, comparing the census of 1821 with that taken in 1811. The town of Thurso, about half a mile west from the Castle, is a very ancient Borough of Barony, of which Sir John Sinclair is superior. It contains about two thousand inhabit ants, and, by its daily mail coaches and regular trading vessels, keeps up a constant communication with all parts ofthe kingdom. The surname of Sinclair, or De Sancto Claro, which was originally Norman, is one of the most illustrious in Scotland. Walderness, Count de St. Clere, married Helena, cousin-german of William the Conqueror, and accompanied that prince to England in 1066. William de Sancto Claro, his son, who came to Scotland in the reign of Mal colm Canmore, obtained a grant of the Lands and Barony of Roslin, in Mid-Lothian, and from him all the Sinclairs in Scotland are descended. The family of Sinclair of Ulbster is one of the most ancient and respectable of the name ; it is sprung from that of the Earls of Caithness, and has possessed the estate of Ulbster in an uninterrupted succession for upwards of two centuries, has formed many noble alliances, and has at different times represented the County of Caithness in Par liament, both before and since the Union. The name of Sir John Sinclair, the present owner of Thurso Castle, is most deservedly well known ; he was born at the family mansion in 1754. To his unremitting exertions the countiy is greatly indebted, giving rise to that spirit of improvement, which within the short space of a few years has produced so great a change in its aspect. He was the founder of the Board of Agriculture, and he was at the head of the Society for the improvement of British wool. He suggested the plan of issuing Exchequer Bills, by which the credit ofthe country was maintained at a very critical period, fie raised two battalions of Fencibles, for the service of Great Britain and Ireland. By his works on Scottish husbandry, he taught English farmers an improved system of cultivation ; and, above all, in his Statistical Account of Scotland, he has, without the aid of public autho rity, and assisted only by the clergy, individually exhibited a better picture of his native country than any government has been able to produce. Sir John Sinclair has been twice married \u2014 first in 1776, to Sarah, only daughter and heiress of Alex. Maitland, Esq., of Stoke Newington, Middlesex, nearly related to the Earl of Lauderdale, by whom he had only two daughters, Hannah and Janet, the latter of whom married Sir James Colquhoun, of Luss ; secondly, in 1788, to Diana, eldest daughter of Alexander, Lord Macdonald, by whom he has twelve children.

This Residence is beautifully situated on the banks of the river Girvan in the south ern district of Ayrshire, Carrick, thirteen miles south of Ayre. It was purchased by the present family towards the end of the last century, from the family of Whiteford, who had acquired it in Charles the Second's time, from the old possessors, the Kennedys of Blairquhan, a principal branch of the family of Kennedy, Earls of Cassilis, from which the present proprietor is also maternally descended, his grandmother, Anne Kennedy, being sister and coheiress with her only sister, Elizabeth, Lady Cathcart, of Carlton, to David, tenth Earl of Cassilis. The former Mansion, the remains of which were taken down to make room for the present edifice, was an irregular building of large size ; and, at the period when it was erected, a great part about the year 1570, in the reign of Queen Mary, of con siderable magnificence. The most ancient part was said by tradition to have been built by the M'Quirters, and supposed to be of remote antiquity. All that remained of it was a square Tower of great strength and thickness, which bore the name of M'Quirter Tower. The building had become a total ruin, when removed by the present pro prietor. Near the site are many fine old trees, particularly two sycamores of great age and size, called the Dool Trees of Blairquhan ; being, it is supposed, the place of execution in the times of feudal power. The present elegant Mansion has been lately built from the design, and under the inspection, of William Burn, Esq., of Edinburgh ; it is a correct specimen of the archi tecture of Henry VII. 's time, and its general effect is very striking and splendid. At the entrance, carriages drive under a very beautiful Porch of the Tudor style. Through the entrance Hall we are conducted into a lofty Saloon, about sixty feet in height, which communicates with the principal Staircase, all of which are richly deco rated in the style of the building, with ornamental oak tracery and plaster work. Some curious sculptured stone-work, as windows, mouldings, &c, of the ancient Mansion, was carefully preserved on pulling it down, and has been disposed around the inside of the Kitchen-court with very happy effect, so as to give the whole the character of an ancient building, without exhibiting any incongruity with the exterior. The Grounds lying beautifully on both sides of the river Girvan, which winds for nearly four miles through Blairquhan, have been embellished with great taste by the present proprietor; and the river flows amongst extensive plantations and old trees, through a fine length of Park, under the windows of the principal apartments. The approach, which is entered by a handsome Bridge and Lodge, also from the designs of William Burn, Esq., has been conducted up the river for about two miles and a half, and winds through rocky and well-wooded banks of the most romantic description, till it comes in sight of the House, at the distance of about half a mile, and presents a sudden prospect of the Mansion and the adjacent grounds, peculiarly fine and striking ; and in approaching the Castle, the road passes through an avenue of lofty lime-trees. Sir James Hunter Blair, Baronet, of Dunskey and Robertland, the father of the present proprietor, descended from the very ancient family of Hunter of Hunterstone, in Ayrshire ; was twice elected Member of Parliament for the City of Edinburgh, in 1781 and 1784. He married, in 1770, Jane, daughter and heiress of John Blair, Esq., of Dunskey, in VVigtonshire, by Anne Kennedy, of Culzean, formerly mentioned. He was created a Baronet in 1786. The present Baronet is Vice-Lieutenant and Convener of the County of Ayr, and married, in 1813, Dorothea, second daughter of Edward Hay Mac Kenzie, Esq., brother of George, seventh Marquis of Tweedale, by the Honourable Maria Murray, daughter of George, sixth Lord Elibank.

That ancient family lived there at least as early as the fourteenth century ; for several charters granted by them are still extant, dated at the Castle of Balloch, betwixt the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In the wreck of their fortunes, it was sold in 1650, and was parcelled out amongst several small proprietors ; and from their successors it was purchased, about thirty years ago, by the present owner, whose paternal estate is adjacent. No part of the old Castle remains ; the moat which surrounded it is, however, quite entire ; it was supplied with water from Loch Lomond, being situated near the spot where the river Leven issues from the Lake. The moat encloses a mound of earth of about an acre in extent, in digging into which, some years ago, a quantity of building rubbish was found ; and the remains of a causeway leading to it, and of a drawbridge across it, were also discovered. The present House is situated upon a rising ground, a short distance to the north of the site of the old Castle, upon the east bank of the Lake, and about a quarter of a mile distant from it. It was built in 1809, from the plans, and under the superintendence, of Mr. Lugar, of London, architect ; and is allowed to be a very good specimen of the modern Castle-gothic. The Grounds are laid out with taste, and the view from the Terrace and from the Drawing-room is very fine ; commanding, to the westward, Loch Lomond, its opposite banks studded with gentlemen's seats, and, to the south, the beautiful vale of Leven, bounded by the Castle of Dumbarton.

This principal and princely seat of the Roxburghe family, anciently called Floors, mean ing a terrace overlooking a plain, is most delightfully situated on a gentle rise, in the immediate vicinity of the rivers Tiviot and Tweed ; the latter of which winds, in a beau tiful curve, through the Park directly in front of the House, and receives the waters of the Tiviot, within view; and above the adjacent town of Kelso, their united streams are seen rushing through the elegant and classical bridge of five arches, constructed by the late John Rennie, the architect of Waterloo bridge, to which it bears a resemblance. On the south front of the Mansion, is a prospect of eight or nine miles over Tiviotdale, a rich and productive valley, rendered familiar by the poems of Sir Walter Scott, and bounded at length by the towering eminences of the Cheviot Hills, in Northumberland. In this Park, King James II. , of Scotland, was killed, in 1460, by the bursting ofa cannon, while superintending the siege of the Castle opposite. The fact is com memorated, and the spot marked, by a holly-tree enclosed with rails. King James III., his successor, was proclaimed, and crowned in military pomp, at the neighbouring town of Kelso, a few days after the occurrence. The House is a magnificent building, erected, in 1718, by John, first Duke of Rox burghe, from a plan and under the direction of Sir John Vanbrugh, and contains numerous and spacious apartments, well adapted to the high rank of the possessor. Among the decorations of the interior are portraits by the hand of the celebrated masters, viz. Van dyck, Lely, Reynolds, Ramsay, Batoni, Raeburn, &c. ; of which we much regret the want of an exact list. The first of this ancient and noble family that was advanced to the peerage was Sir Robert Ker, of Cessford, who having accompanied King James to England, was by him created, in 1604, Lord Ker of Cessford, and Earl of Roxburghe in 1616; he also received from that monarch a grant of the then dissolved monastery of Kelso, which had been founded by King David for Cistercian monks. The anxiety shewn by the present Duke, in the preservation of this beautiful ruin, is deserving of much commendation. James, the fifth Earl of this family, in the reign of Queen Anne, was advanced to the titles of Duke of Roxburghe, Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford, by patent, in 1707. His son Robert, the second Duke, was created, in 1722, a peer of England, by the title of Earl and Baron Ker of Wakefield ; he dying in 1755, left John, third Duke, his suc cessor, a nobleman distinguished for his accomplishments and rare library of old English literature, curious in many articles, but in the department of the drama unrivalled. At the sale of this collection, in 1812, was instituted a literary society, well known by the name of the Roxburghe Club \u2014 denominated in honour of the noble collector. His Grace, dying unmarried, in 1804, the English honours became extinct: William Lord Bellenden, the next heir, succeeded as fourth Duke of this title ; he also died with- out issue in 1805, leaving a widow, now Duchess Dowager of Roxburghe, who after his death, married the Honourable John Tollemache, brother to Lord Huntingtower. Her Grace, when in Scotland, resides at Broxmouth, another seat of the family in Hadding tonshire. Sir James Innes of Innes, Bart., of an ancient family, eminent in their origin and con nexion, whose pedigree of thirty descents is regularly deduced from the early period of 1153, claimed the honours and estates of the Dukedom of Roxburghe, as descendant of an intermarriage with the noble House of Ker ; and after an expensive contest succeeded to the title in 1812, by decision of the House of Lords and Court of Session in his favour. His Grace was one ofthe sixteen representative peers for Scotland, and has been twice married; first, in 1789, to Mary, sister of Sir Cecil Wray, Bart., who died in 1807.

The estate of Kinfauns was anciently a possession of the family of Charteris, to whom it belonged for several centuries. Sir Thomas de Longueville, or Charteris, a native of France, and of a considerable family in that kingdom, is understood to have been the first proprietor of the estate, of the name of Charteris, having received a royal grant from King Robert, about the year 1314, of these lands. It is reported, by tradition, that, when at the Court of Philip IV., in the end of the thirteenth century, Sir Thomas had a dispute with a French nobleman, and killed him in the king's presence ; and that he escaped from France, but was refused pardon. Having, for several years, infested the seas as a pirate, Sir William Wallace encountered and took him prisoner, about 1301, when, by his intercession, pardon was procured : he accompanied Wallace on his return to Scotland, aided in his principal exploits, and continued ever after his adherent and friend. He appears to have proved equally faithful to Bruce, who rewarded his bravery and services by the grant above noticed. Lord Gray still preserves the sword of Sir Thomas Charteris, which is of great size, made to be used by both hands, and must now be more than 500 years old. About the middle of the seventeenth centmy, the Hon. Alexander Carnegie, a younger son of David, Earl of Northesk, married the daughter of Sir William Blair, of Kinfauns, a Cadet of the ancient family of Blair, of Balthayock ; and their descendant, Miss Blair, married, in 1741, John Lord Gray, father of the present proprietor \u2014 by which marriage this estate came into the possession of the noble family of Gray. The old Castle of Kinfauns, lately removed, was a building of very great age. The present edifice was commenced in 1820, from designs by Smirke, and is situated a little higher, amidst trees of the most luxuriant growth, whose great size denotes their antiquity. The style of architecture very properly adopted, is the castellated, of a simple and imposing character, exceedingly well suited to its elevated site, and to the grandeur of the surrounding scenery. The building stands on a raised terrace, forty feet in width, with circular bastions pro jecting at the corners ; the East, or entrance front, extends two hundred and twenty feet, and the Southern, one hundred and twenty-eight ; the height of the flag-tower is eighty-four feet, its dimensions fifty- two 'by thirty-two. On entering from the covered carriage-way, a vestibule, lighted with stained glass, leads by a broad flight of steps to the Hall of Entrance, twenty-eight feet by twenty, communicating with the Gallery, eighty-two feet in length, from which most of the principal rooms enter. In the centre of the gallery'is a iarge three sided projection, each compartment occupied by a handsome pointed window of stained glass \u2014 the width is here twenty-five feet. The principal rooms occupy the East and South fronts of the Castle, commanding a most delightful prospect of the river, and a great extent of the surrounding fertile country. Among the numerous curiosities at Kinfauns Castle, one ancient relic deserves particular notice ; it is a dish of very curious workmanship, of copper, richly gilt, containing a figure, holding on his head a small tray with a bit of silver ore in it; several other minerals are scattered in the dish. \u2014 The following lines were written at Kinfauns by Sir Walter Scott, the first verse being a literal translation, in the Scottish dialect, of a German motto, engraved round the dish; the other two verses are in compliment to Lord Gray's family : \u2014 The aim speaks stalworth heart and hand, The copper, wealth and wide command ; The silver, rank and noble name, The gold, true worth and spotless fame.

Castle Forbes, the principal residence of James Ochoncar Forbes, Lord Forbes, premier Baron of Scotland, is situated on a gentle eminence on the banks of the Don. Here the river flows in an easy serpentine course; the mountain of Benachie rises to an Alpine height immediately at the back of the castle, and with the purple bloom of the heath, flowers, and the grey rocks appearing through, yields a picturesque contrast with the lively green of the thriving plantations, and the many rural beauties of the country in front of this noble mansion, where gentlemen's seats, and well- cultivated farms, set off the fainter tints of the blue misty mountains which terminate the scene. The castle was built by the present noble proprietor, and though in the style of an ancient baronial mansion, is, nevertheless, at once an elegant and majestic edifice, the higher parts of which, towering through the surrounding trees, present an image of grandeur to the country. The worthy nobleman, whose seat is here described, is the chief of the ancient family of Forbes ; who derive their appellation from an estate of that name in the county of Aberdeen, which was granted by Alexander II. , King of Scotland, about 1230, to an ancestor of the present peer, who is the seventeenth Lord Forbes. His Lordship was born 7th of March, 1765, and was twenty-six years an officer in the Coldstream regiment of foot-guards, of which he had an ensigncy in 1781, lieutenancy in 1786, a company in 1793, and was senior captain in that regiment, when he was promoted to the command of the third garrison battalion in 1807- He had the rank of major-general in 1802; suc ceeded his father, 1804 ; was chosen one of the sixteen representatives of the Scottish peerage, at the general election in 1806 ; and re-chosen 1807- He was appointed second in command of the troops in the Mediterranean, March, 1808, with the rank of lieutenant-general; and the same year sailed for Sicily; was constituted colonel of the ninety-fourth regiment of foot, 14th April, 1809 ; and of the 54th regiment of'foot, 23d September, 1809. His Lordship married at Crailing, 2d June, 1792, Elizabeth, eldest daughter and heiress of Walter Hunter, Esq., of Polmood in the county of Peebles, and Crailing in the county of Roxburgh, by Lady Caroline Mackenzie, fourth daughter of George, Earl of Cromarty ; and has a numerous issue. It may be proper to mention, that the castle, which is just completed, is built of light-coloured granite, the prevailing rock in this district ; and also that the public apartments, which are large, and of elegant proportions, are tastefully furnished and ornamented with a variety of pictures, among which the old family portraits, in their antique dresses, exhibit an amusing contrast with the costume and character of the present generation.

The View of Mingarry Castjle represents its position on the sea-coast of Ardnamurchan, which is such, that in the days of its strength it must have commanded the entrance of the Sound of Mull, as well as that of Loch Sunart. The ruins have not that magnitude which we usually associate with the idea of a castle. The structure is ofa triangular form, with the corners rounded off; and a house, with a few windows in front, occupies nearly its whole breadth. There are a few huts in its vicinity. The irregular form of the castle originated in the necessity of adapting it to the projecting angles of the rocky eminence on which it stands. It is exhibited in the present Plate as beheld by a spectator looking from the north-west down the Sound of Mull. The island of that name, and its lofty mountain, Ben Taillich, are visible in the distance. The range of mountains that extend up the shores of Loch Sunart are finely broken, and have a very picturesque effect. The account given of this castle by Sir Walter Scott, in his notes to \" The Lord of the Isles,\" is as follows : \" It was anciently the residence of the Mac- Ians, a clan of Macdonalds, descended from Ian or John, a grandson of Angus Og, lord of the isles. The last time that Mingarry was of military importance, occurs in the celebrated Leabhar-dearg, or red book of Clanronald, a MS. re nowned in the Ossianic controversy. Allaster Macdonald, commonly called Colquitto, who commanded the Irish auxiliaries sent over by the earl of Antrim during the great civil war to the assistance of Montrose, began his enterprise in 1644 by taking the castles of Kinloch-Alline and Mingarry, the last of which made considerable resistance, as might, from the strength of the situation, be expected. In the mean while, Allaster Macdonald's ships, which had brought him over, were attacked in Loch Eisord, in Skye, by an armament sent round by the covenanting parliament, and his own vessel was taken. This circum stance is said chiefly to have induced him to continue in Scotland, where there seemed little prospect of raising an army in behalf of the king. He had no sooner moved eastward to join Montrose, a junction which he effected in the braes of Athole, than the marquis of Argyle besieged the Castle of Mingarry, but without success. Among other warriors and chiefs whom Argyle sum moned to his castle on this occasion was John of Moidart, the captain of Clan ronald. Clanronald appeared; but, far from yielding effectual assistance to Argyle, he took the opportunity of being in arms, to lay in waste the district of Sunart, then belonging to the adherents of Argyle, and sent part of the spoil to relieve the castle of Mingarry. Thus the castle was maintained, until re lieved by Allaster Macdonald, (Colquitto,) who had been detached for the pur pose by Montrose.\" These particulars, connected with the memorable successes of Montrose, are stated to have remained hitherto unknown to Scottish his torians, and are cited from the relation of an eye-witness. 20."], [354, "2 Suntrune Castle, tx& Crinan. argla&fre : THE SEAT OF NEILL MALCOLM, ESQ. Duntrune Castle is the property of Neill Malcolm, Esq. to whom it has descended through a long line of ancestry. His father made some improve ments, which have certainly rendered it a very comfortable residence. The castle stands on a rock of small elevation, the base of which is washed on one side by the sea. The scenery around it partakes little of the ruggedness of either the Hebridean or the Highland landscape. The Crinan canal commences at Loch Gilp, a branch of Loch Fyne, at Ardris haig, and runs on the western side of the loch to near Oakfield, a distance of about two miles, from thence to Cairnbaan, a distance of about two miles more, where it crosses the road leading from Inverary through Loch Gilp Head to Bellanoch, and to the ferry across the sound of Jura to the islands of Jura and Ila. From Cairnbaan the canal runs along the eastern side of the road to Bella noch, a distance of about three miles more; from thence, under the high cliffs of rock on the western side of Loch Crinan, cutting through the skirts of the rocks, in some parts, at the depth of from forty to fifty feet, till it comes to Portree, where it enters into the bay of Crinan on its western side, a farther distance of about two miles from Bellanoch, making the whole length nine miles, from Loch Gilp to Loch Crinan. At the entrance of the canal from Loch Gilp there is an extensive stone pier to protect vessels either entering or coming out of the sea-lock from the south erly winds, which, when blowing hard, send a heavy sea up Loch Fyne and into Loch Gilp : within the sea-lock there is a commodious basin for vessels to remain in. From the basin there are three locks within a short distance, rising, with the rise of the sea-lock, about twenty-six feet. The canal then runs on the same level to Cairnbaan, where there are four locks rising into the summit-level about thirty-five feet. The summit-level runs to Dell, a distance of little more than half a mile, where there are five locks in a short distance, the last at Dunarary, locking down together about forty-five feet. From Dunarary the canal runs on the same level to Portree, where there is a lock into the basin of about ten feet fall. From this basin, which is not so extensive as the one at Ardrishaig, there is a sea-lock into Loch Crinan, falling about seven feet. This lock stands in deep water; the entrance is well sheltered by nature, and needs no pier for its protection. The length of the locks between the gates is ninety-six feet, the width twenty-four feet, and the depth of water in the canal twelve feet. The general line of the canal runs from south-east to north-west, but its direction is usually termed east and west. It is for the greatest part cut through rock ; in many places to a great depth, and at enormous cost. The great accommodation which this canal affords consists in passing vessels from Loch Gilp to Loch Crinan, by which they avoid the long and dangerous navigation round the Mull of Cantyre, and save in distance, from the Clyde to the bay of Crinan, upwards of sixty miles. It also affords a short and safe passage for small boats to and from the fisheries of cod, ling, and herring, on the western coast, which could not with safety navigate round the Mull of Cantyre. The number of these boats and of small vessels under 12 tons burden, passing the canal in the course of a year, was about 600 ; and about 700 vessels from 12 to 120 tons, with various cargoes. The number of vessels to and from the herring fisheries on the western coast, in moderate seasons, was about 700 annually. These were taken on an average of the years 1809 and 1810; but the tonnage dues being very low, did not amount to more than about \u00a31650 on the average, per annum."], [355, ""], [356, "M^UJ^T _ _HTAl__.

The Isle of Bute, together with that of Arran, and the isles of Great and Little Cumbrae and Inchmarnock, constitutes the county of Bute. It is separated from the district of Cowal, in Argyleshire, by a long and very narrow channel. The extent of the isle of Bute, from north to south, is about eighteen miles ; its greatest breadth, from east to west, is about five miles, but its area is indented by several deep bays. The northern parts are rocky and barren ; the more fertile tracts lie to the southward, and those which are under cultivation produce abundance of barley, oats, and potatoes. The soil is considered by agriculturists as capable of being turned to the highest account of any in all the Hebrides. The union of two incongruous employments, farming and fish ing, tended to retard the improvement of these advantages. When the late Earl of Bute came to his estate, he took measures to establish a distinction between them, so that each individual, according to his choice, might devote his sole attention either to one or the other ; in consequence of which arrange ment, and the encouragement that his lordship gave to agriculture, the island soon assumed a more flourishing aspect. Much lime is calcined here, both for private use and for exportation. Great quantities of slate are also found. The populous districts of the west of Scot land afford a ready market for these and other products of the island. There are regular packets from Rothsay, and a ferry-boat once a week from Scoulay to the Largs. In coasting southward from Rothsay, the view here given of Mount Stuart presents itself at such a distance from the shore, as to comprise, within the angle of vision, the remote mountains of Arran, whose high and rugged peaks form a remarkable contrast with the level ground on this part of the intervening island.

The ruins of ancient fortifications in this vicinity are vestiges of the feudal grandeur by which it was once distinguished. In describing those of the Castle of Dunolly, of which a view is here given, it may be allowable to cite the account given of it by Sir Walter Scott, in a note to the first canto of his \" Lord of the Isles.\" After relating the reverses which deprived the house of Macdougal of a great portion of their possessions, he observes, that the castle of Dunolly, near Oban, with its dependencies, was the principal part of what remained to them, with their right of chieftainship over the families of their name and blood. These they continued to enjoy until the year 1715, when the representative incurred the penalty of forfeiture for his accession to the insur rection of that period ; thus losing the remains of his inheritance, to replace upon the throne the descendants of those princes whose accession his ancestors had opposed at the expense of their feudal grandeur. The estate was, however, restored about 1745, to the father of the present proprietor, whom family experience had taught the hazard of interfering with the established govern ment, and who remained quiet upon that occasion. He therefore regained his property when many of the highland chiefs lost theirs. \" Nothing can be more wildly beautiful than the situation of Dunoily. The ruins are situated upon a bold and precipitous promontory overhanging Loch Etive, and distant about a mile from the village and port of Oban. The prin cipal part which remains is the donjon or keep ; but fragments of other build ings, overgrown with ivy, attest that it had been once a place of importance, as large apparently as Artornish or Dunstaffnage. These fragments inclose a court-yard, of which the keep probably formed one side ; the entrance being by a steep ascent, from the neck of the isthmus, formerly cut across by a moat, and defended doubtless by outworks and a drawbridge Beneath the castle stands the present mansion of the family, having on the one hand Loch Etive with its islands and mountains ; on the other, two romantic eminences covered with copse-wood. There are other accompaniments suited to the scene ; in particular, a huge upright pillar, or detached fragment of that sort of rock called plum-pudding stone, upon the shore, about a quarter of a mile from the castle. It is called Clach-na-can, or the Dog's Pillar, because Fingal is said to have used it as a stake to which he bound his celebrated dog Bran. Others say, that when the Lord of the Isles came upon a visit to the Lord of Lorn, the dogs brought for his sport were kept beside this pillar. Upon the whole, a more delightful and romantic spot can scarcely be conceived ; and it receives a moral interest from the considerations attached to the residence of a family once powerful enough to confront and defeat Robert Bruce, and now sunk into the shade of private life. It is at present possessed by Patrick Macdougal, Esq. the lineal and undisputed representative of the ancient lords of Lorn. The heir of Dunolly fell in Spain, fighting under the Duke of Wellington \u2014 a death well becoming his ancestry.\""], [359, ""], [360, ". AILILX, PERTHSHIRE I 5' EM 'GASH HL.E, S ondnn."], [361, "dFasfcallg, THE SEAT OF ARCHIBALD BUTLER, ESQ For an account of this interesting residence, we are indebted to Dr. Macculloch's Guide to Dunkeld and Blair, which describes, in the following passages, the beautiful scenery of Faskally and its vicinity : \u2014 \" On the right-hand, the skirts of Ben Vrackie soon begin to impend over the road, rocky and wooded : till, at length, plunging among the woods of Faskally, all external objects are shut out, and the attention, which had almost become wearied by a continued succession of scenery so splendid, is relieved by a space-of what becomes in effect a forest road. Emerging from this, the opener grounds of Faskally now come into view, wild and strange, and romantic ; picturesque in the common acceptation of the term, yet rarely so disposed as to admit of being forced into a picture. The characters of the hills are extremely peculiar, as well as ornamented and wild ; the outlines being unusually rugged and abrupt, yet never inelegant ; and the faces being every where chequered and broken, even from the summit to the river below, by precipices and projecting rocks, interspersed with scattered *rees, or more continuous patches of wood. A chaotic, yet pleasing confusion, dissimilar to any thing elsewhere in Highland scenery, stamps the peculiar cnaracter on this place ; yet this is somewhat relieved, while it is advantageously contrasted by the flat green meadows below, and by the richer and larger wood that skirts the course of the river, and ornaments the lower grounds.\" The House of Faskally, represented in the View, was erected by the grand father of the present proprietor. It is a plain but commodious family mansion. The late Colonel Butler, of Faskally, married Vere, only daughter of Sir Robert Menzies, of Menzies, Baronet, by whom he had only one child, the present Archibald Butler, Esq. The village of Pitlochry, situated some miles south of Faskally, is an older possession of this family than their principal seat, and has belonged to Mr. Butler's predecessors for a considerable time. The magni ficent scenery of the Pass of Killikranky commences immediately after passing Faskally, and continues along the road to Blair for some miles. Near the upper end of the Pass was fought the battle of 1689, in which Lord Dundee was killed ; and a large and rude fragment of stone, placed on end, is supposed to mark the spot where he fell. Of this, Dr. Macculloch says, \" The history of a ferocious action harmonizes ill with these scenes of beauty and peace. He who views the smiling and lovely landscape around, would wish to forget that they were ever ravaged by war, or contaminated by civil discord. I will not assist in recalling to mind that which can only give pain ; and should myself be well pleased to think that this monumental stone had belonged to Fingal, or any other visionary personage, whose existence, or not, concerns us as little as that of the Pre-Adamites.\" 21."], [362, "2 ,jFmga0ii \u00c6aatlt, Pertfrsfnre; THE SEAT OF SIR PATRICK MURRAY THREIPLAND, BART. Fingask Castle is beautifully situated on what are called the Braes of the Carse, commanding an extensive prospect over the rich and fertile vale of the Carse of Gowrie, which here, surrounded by cultivated hills, opens in one vast amphitheatre, with the river Tay rolling through it for upwards of fourteen miles, till it is lost to the sight in the bay of St. Andrew's. This forms one of the grandest views of which the place can boast ; as with the naked eye may be distinctly seen the town of Dundee, and the adjacent country for many miles, bounded in the distance by the sea and the sloping Sidla Hills. Besides these objects, which partake so much of the sublime, there are others of the most genuine and native beauty, which, from the peculiar happiness of the situation, are thrown together in fine contrast. The grounds are tastefully laid out with extensive walks and rides. In the Shrubberies, the Arbutus flowers and fruits in perfection ; and the Passiflora, or Passion-flower, grows luxuriantly in the open air. The Castle, which is built on the brink of a deep glen amidst wooded eminences, in one part, bears as old a date as 1194. The View given in our Plate exhibits two sides of this ancient Mansion, with the tasteful alternation of square and pointed windows. The roof is surrounded by an embrasured parapet. But the most curious external feature of this building is the principal entrance door, strongly studded with large nails ; the upper part having a cymatic form. An old coat of arms, rudely cut in stone, is placed over this door. The Castle was used as a place of strength, and stood a siege, in 1642, during the civil war, in Oliver Cromwell's time ; and as such, commanded one of the passes from the low grounds to the country above. Here the Chevalier St. George, the son of James II. , slept in January, 1716, on his way from Glammis to Scone, where he was proclaimed king ; and, in consequence of the Threipland family's attachment then, and afterwards, to the cause of the unfortunate House of Stuart, the Castle was completely ransacked, in 1746, by the Government troops, who demolished its fortalices, and razed a greater portion of the building to the ground. There are several valuable original portraits of the Stuart family, with other paintings, at Fingask Castle."], [363, ""], [364, "ry J P Beds. 1 I'SITIS, ' Hnabnnr\" Srmjrre Lnnrl\u2122! &.MM2S CASTILE,"], [365, "<\u00a3lammt0 (\u00c6agtU, dFoxfax^ixt; THE SEAT OF THE EARL OF STRATHMORE AND KINGHORN. The Castle of Glammis is situated nearly in the centre of the great valley which gives the title of Earl to its noble possessors. This is one of the most venerable and picturesque edifices in the kingdom ; and its appearance is rendered still more interesting to the lover of antiquity, since a vitiated and ignoble taste has consigned so many of our most splendid baronial residences to de struction. Glammis Castle fronts the south. Its walls are built of a reddish grey freestone, abundant in this part of the country. Part of the Castle is of great and unknown antiquity, and in the central Tower, King Malcolm the Second died in 1033, having received his death-wound in the neighbouring village. The circular Tower in the centre was built by the first Earl, in 1606, as appears from an inscription over the door way. Immediately over the entrance is the full royal arms in stone of King James the Seventh, in whose reign the Castle was enlarged and beautified by the third Earl of Strathmore. The central Tower contains a spacious spiral staircase, one end of the steps resting on a light hollow pillar, continued to the highest story. The Stairs, from the entrance to the top of the House, consist of 143 steps, of which the great Stairs, where five people can mount abreast, are eighty-six, each of one stone. To the left of the Staircase, and entered by steps projecting into the room, with balustrades, is the Stone Hall, a vaulted apartment, nearly 70 feet in length, and about 25 in breadth. At the sides of the win dows are several curious little rooms, cut out of the solid wall, which is about 12 feet in thickness. Adjoining the Stone Hall is the Library, and at the south end is a room, 45 feet in length and two stories high, intended for a Drawing-room by the late Earl. Above the Stone Hall is the Great Hall, ofthe same dimensions. The arched ceiling is about 30 feet in height, containing heraldic devices of the family in stucco. This mag nificent apartment was finished in 1621. It is lighted by two large windows, one look ing into the back court, at the end of the room, and another in the side looking to the front ofthe House ; each about 12 feet deep, and nearly the same in breadth. The fire place is on the side of the room near the window, and is upwards of 12 feet wide ; above it is some fine rich stucco work, extending to the roof; and within it stand two ancient gilded lions, nearly four feet high. Adjoining the Hall is the Chapel ; the sides and roof are of panelled oak, with curi ously executed paintings of the Apostles, and scenes from the New Testament ; the account of each representation, and the names of the several figures, being inscribed beneath. A door in the side of the end window ofthe Hall leads to the Great Drawing room, 60 feet by 30, and 24 in height ; a modern room, built by some of the later Earls. Near the Great Hall rs Lord Strathmore's Bed-chamber; the bed is of yellow damask, surmounted by a coronet. In an Indian chest are various court dresses of ancient fashion. The Breakfast-room is wainscoted, and hung with curious tapestry, together with some ancient paintings. In an upper floor is King Malcolm's Room. The roof is of ancient stucco, and above the fire-place is the royal arms. It appears to have been finished nearly at the same time with the Hall. \u2014 The other furniture is, with great good taste, quite modern. In some of the Bed-rooms are antique beds, adorned with velvet, and bearing the arms of the Earls of Strathmore. The room called Earl Patrick's Room is on the fourth floor. The bed is worked, and very ancient in its appearance ; the carved chairs are all gilded, and have crimson velvet cushions. The Great Kitchen, under the Drawing-room, is 60 feet by 30, and 30 feet high, lighted by four large pointed windows, and contains eight fire-places. The view from the summit is splendid and extensive. The country around is highly cultivated ; and the seats of the neighbouring proprietors, together with the spires of towns and villages, give an interest and richness to the prospect, which is bounded by the Grampian mountains on the north and west. 3"], [366, "Huttortis, JFoxfox&iiixt; THE SEAT OF GILBERT LAING MEASON, ESQ This Mansion is situated on the rising ground which forms the northern boundary of the fertile and beautiful Vale of Strathmore, seventy miles west of the county town, Forfar. The building, lately erected under the direction of Mr. Archibald Elliot, is a commodious family house ; the material is free-stone, that abounds in the valley. The interior is finished in a handsome, but not florid Gothic style. In the ground floor is comprised the living rooms, con sisting of a dining room, 30 feet long, by 21 feet broad ; library, 27 by 24 ; two drawing rooms, 30 by 21, and 21 by 16 feet. These rooms are well connected, and form the east and west sides, and south front, of the building. The dining room has a groined ceiling, those of the other rooms have spandril fans in the corners, and a corresponding drop in the centre. The Gothic staircase hall, in particular, does great credit to the taste of the architect. The grounds are extensive, and the house, placed on an elevated situation, commands fine views of the vale, yet is well sheltered by the extended woods to the north, west, and east. The approach to the house from the west, is carried in a direct line, for upwards of a mile, along a closely-wooded bank. The approach from the south, winds through an open grove of nearly the same length. The whole domain has the advantage of being well sheltered from the cold northern winds, that sometimes blow from the elevated range of mountains called the Grampians. It is no trifling encouragement to the planters of larch wood, to be informed, that the greater part of the wood employed in this man sion is of that fir, thinned out of the surrounding woods, and planted not more than forty-five years ago. The larchwood on this estate thrives alike well on good deep arable land, on a dry rocky bank of free-stone, on cool moorish ground, and on a gravelly soil. In the neighbourhood of Lindertis are many interesting objects to the admirers of picturesque scenery : such as the grand fall of the river Isla, or the Reekie Lynn ; the tremendous chasm, through which the Isla rushes, called the Slough of Auchrannie ; the castle of Airley, a roman tic seat of the earl of Airley ; and the venerable castle of Glammis, belonging to the earl of Strathmore, whose extensive and well-managed woods adorn the vale. Strathmore, or the Great Vale, is one of the most fertile districts in Scotland, extending above thirty miles in length, and seven miles in breadth. There is no part in the kingdom, in which the drilled turnip culture is carried on in greater perfection, and consequently the winter stall-feeding of cattle. The farms are large, the farm-buildings of the most approved and commodious arrangements, and the country in general well enclosed and wooded. For beauty, the vale is deficient alone in a fine river or lake ; as its only stream is the Dean, of inconsiderable size, which flows through the vale from the lake of Forfar till it joins the river Isla.
