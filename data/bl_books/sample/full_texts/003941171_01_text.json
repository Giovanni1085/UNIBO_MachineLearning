When from his bosom rose the scaly brood Of Sprites and Mermen, o'er the water popping, And, in fantastic gambols, springing, flopping, Diving, and splashing, till tormented Plane With foam and phosphorus seemed to splash and shine ; Then one white figure, all in white arrayed, Swam right ashore, and for the forest made.
